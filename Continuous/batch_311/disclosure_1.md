## Dynamic Scene Importance with Multi-Modal Affect Analysis

**Concept:** Extend scene importance ranking beyond textual analysis of closed captions to incorporate *affective* cues derived from both the closed captions *and* the videoâ€™s audio track. This creates a more nuanced and potentially accurate assessment of scene significance, capturing emotional impact alongside narrative content.

**Specs:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

1.  **Input:** Video content with associated closed captioning and audio track.
2.  **Closed Captioning Processing:** Extract text from closed captions. Perform standard NLP preprocessing (tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, stop word removal).
3.  **Audio Processing:**
    *   Extract audio features:  Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), pitch, energy, and spectral centroid.
    *   Voice Activity Detection (VAD): Identify segments containing speech.
4.  **Synchronization:**  Align closed caption and audio data to individual scenes (scene change detection as per patent claim 7).

**II. Affect Analysis Modules:**

1.  **Textual Affect Analysis:**
    *   Employ a pre-trained sentiment analysis model (e.g., VADER, BERT-based) to determine sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) for each caption segment *within a scene*.
    *   Expand beyond simple polarity to detect more granular emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, etc.) using an emotion detection model.
2.  **Acoustic Affect Analysis:**
    *   Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, Deep Neural Network) to map acoustic features (MFCCs, pitch, energy) to emotional states. Training data: labeled audio segments representing various emotions.  Model outputs: probability scores for each emotional state.
    *   Account for speaker identification (if possible) to differentiate emotional expression between characters.

**III. Scene Importance Scoring:**

1.  **Feature Vector Construction:**  For each scene, create a feature vector comprising:
    *   Average sentiment score (from textual analysis).
    *   Probabilities for each emotional state (from both textual and acoustic analysis).
    *   Total dialog length (as in patent claim 8).
    *   Presence/Intensity of Non-Dialog sounds (e.g., music, sound effects - classify & quantify).
    *   Performer Prominence scores (as per patent claims 13-15, integrated from closed captioning data).
2.  **Weighted Summation/Machine Learning Model:**
    *   **Option A (Weighted Summation):** Assign weights to each feature based on their estimated contribution to scene importance (weights may be determined empirically or through A/B testing). Calculate a final importance score for each scene.
    *   **Option B (Machine Learning Model):** Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict scene importance based on the feature vector.  Training data: videos with human-labeled scene importance scores.
3.  **Normalization:** Normalize scene importance scores to a consistent range (e.g., 0-1).
4.  **Ranking:** Rank scenes based on their normalized importance scores.

**IV. System Architecture:**

1.  **Modular Design:**  Implement each module (data acquisition, affect analysis, scoring) as a separate, reusable component.
2.  **API Integration:** Provide an API for accessing the scene importance ranking functionality.
3.  **Scalability:** Design the system to handle large volumes of video content.

**Pseudocode (Scene Importance Scoring):**

```python
def calculate_scene_importance(scene_data):
  # scene_data contains:
  #  - text_sentiment: average sentiment score
  #  - text_emotions: dictionary of emotion probabilities
  #  - audio_emotions: dictionary of emotion probabilities
  #  - dialog_length: total length of dialog in the scene
  #  - non_dialog_intensity: intensity of non-dialog sounds
  #  - performer_prominence: performer prominence score

  # Feature vector construction
  feature_vector = [
    text_sentiment,
    *text_emotions.values(),
    *audio_emotions.values(),
    dialog_length,
    non_dialog_intensity,
    performer_prominence
  ]

  # Weighted Summation (Option A)
  weights = [0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1] # Example weights
  importance_score = sum([w * f for w, f in zip(weights, feature_vector)])

  # Machine Learning Model (Option B)
  # importance_score = trained_model.predict([feature_vector])[0]

  return importance_score
