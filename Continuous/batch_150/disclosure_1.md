## Personalized "Serendipity Engine" - Proactive Item Discovery

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive search refinement to proactively suggest items a user *didn't know* they wanted, based on nuanced preference modeling and "adjacent" item discovery. This goes beyond collaborative filtering suggesting "people who bought this also bought..." towards anticipating latent needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User Purchase History (explicit)
    *   Browsing History (explicit)
    *   "Dwell Time" - Time spent viewing specific item details (implicit)
    *   Social Media Activity (opt-in, if available) – likes, shares, comments related to items/categories.
    *   Item Metadata – detailed descriptions, tags, attributes (existing).
    *   "Concept Graphs" - automatically generated knowledge graphs linking items based on attributes and semantic relationships. (New – see Implementation Details)

*   **Preference Modeling:**
    *   **Multi-Dimensional Vectors:** Represent user preferences as vectors spanning multiple dimensions (e.g., price, brand, style, function, emotion).  Weights assigned to each dimension based on explicit/implicit signals.
    *   **"Preference Decay":** Preferences degrade over time. Recent interactions carry more weight.
    *   **"Contextual Preferences":**  Infer preferences based on time of day, location (if permission granted), weather, etc.

*   **"Serendipity Engine" Core:**
    *   **Concept Graph Traversal:** Given a user's preference vector, identify "adjacent" concepts within the Concept Graph.  Adjacency determined by semantic similarity and/or graph distance.
    *   **"Novelty Filter":**  Exclude items the user has already seen or purchased (or those too similar to previously seen items).
    *   **"Surprise Factor":**  Score potential recommendations based on how "unexpected" they are given the user's established preferences. Higher surprise scores are favored, but balanced with relevance.
    *   **"Latent Need Inference":**  Identify patterns in user behavior that suggest unmet needs. Example: User consistently views hiking boots, but never purchases. Engine infers a potential need for hiking socks, waterproof spray, or a backpack.

*   **UI Integration:**
    *   **"Discovery Feed":** A dedicated feed presenting proactively recommended items, with explanations for *why* the item was suggested ("Based on your recent views of outdoor gear, we think you might like…").
    *   **"Latent Need Alerts":**  Gentle notifications suggesting items that address inferred needs ("Looks like you're planning a hike. Don't forget waterproof socks!").
    *   **"Serendipity Slider":**  Allow users to adjust the "surprise factor" of recommendations, from "safe" (highly relevant) to "wild" (completely unexpected).

**Implementation Details (Concept Graphs):**

1.  **Knowledge Extraction:** Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract key attributes and relationships from item descriptions, reviews, and other text sources.
2.  **Entity Linking:**  Identify and link entities (e.g., brands, materials, activities) to a pre-defined ontology or knowledge base (e.g., Wikidata).
3.  **Graph Construction:** Create a graph where nodes represent entities and edges represent relationships between them.
4.  **Relationship Weighting:** Assign weights to edges based on the strength of the relationship (e.g., frequency of co-occurrence in item descriptions).

**Pseudocode (Simplified "Serendipity Engine" Recommendation):**

```
function recommend_serendipity(user_id):
  user_preferences = get_user_preferences(user_id)
  concept_graph = load_concept_graph()
  adjacent_concepts = find_adjacent_concepts(concept_graph, user_preferences)
  potential_items = get_items_from_concepts(adjacent_concepts)
  filtered_items = filter_seen_items(potential_items, user_id)
  scored_items = score_serendipity(filtered_items, user_preferences)
  recommended_items = get_top_n_items(scored_items, 10)
  return recommended_items
```
