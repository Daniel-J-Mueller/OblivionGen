## Dynamic Component Assembly Visualization

**Concept:** Extend the component-level rating system to incorporate a dynamic, interactive assembly visualization. Instead of simply rating individual components, users can virtually assemble the product themselves, receiving feedback on component compatibility and potential issues *before* purchase or during a repair process.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** A hierarchical component graph. Each component node contains:
    *   Component ID (matching the existing system)
    *   3D Model Data (accessible via URL or embedded)
    *   Connection Points (defined by coordinates & connector type)
    *   Compatibility Rules (list of acceptable connecting components/types)
    *   Assembly Instructions (step-by-step guidance, potentially video)
    *   User Ratings (existing system integration)
*   **User Interface:** A 3D viewport displaying the partially/fully assembled product.
    *   Component Palette: Displays available components. Filtering by category/rating.
    *   Assembly Stage Indicator: Visual progress bar showing assembly completion.
    *   Highlighting: Selected components & valid connection points highlighted. Invalid connections visually rejected (e.g., red outline).
    *   Error Messaging: Clear, concise error messages for invalid connections.
    *   "Ghost" Components: Display translucent "ghost" components indicating potential locations/orientations.
*   **Interaction:**
    1.  User selects a component from the palette.
    2.  Component is added to the 3D viewport, initially floating near the existing assembly.
    3.  User manipulates the component (rotation, translation) to align with a connection point.
    4.  System validates the connection based on compatibility rules.
    5.  Successful connection: Component snaps into place, visually locking. Assembly stage increments. User rating for that component becomes accessible/editable.
    6.  Failed connection: Visual rejection & error message.
*   **Backend Logic:**
    *   Assembly Validation Engine: Executes compatibility rules.
    *   Assembly State Management: Tracks component placement & connections. Serializes/deserializes the assembly state for persistence.
    *   User Data Integration: Links assembly sessions to user profiles.
*   **Pseudocode (Validation Engine):**

```
function validateConnection(componentA, componentB, connectionPointA, connectionPointB):
    compatibility = lookupCompatibility(componentA.connectorType, componentB.connectorType)
    if compatibility == "Compatible":
        // Check for spatial conflicts (e.g., overlap)
        if not hasSpatialConflict(componentA, componentB, connectionPointA, connectionPointB):
            return "Valid"
        else:
            return "Spatial Conflict"
    else:
        return "Incompatible"
```

*   **Future Considerations:**
    *   Augmented Reality Integration: Overlay virtual assembly instructions onto the real product.
    *   AI-Powered Assembly Assistance: Automatically suggest the next assembly step or identify potential errors.
    *   User-Generated Assembly Guides: Allow users to create and share their own assembly guides.
    *   Integration with parts ordering systems: Direct links to purchase replacement parts.
