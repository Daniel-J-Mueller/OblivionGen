## Dynamic Schema Augmentation via Generative Pre-training

**Concept:** Expand the metadata schema used by the S2S model *during* query processing, using a generative pre-trained model to predict relevant schema elements based on the NLQ and initial candidate datasets. This allows for more nuanced understanding of the data and improved intent representation, especially for datasets with sparse or poorly defined metadata.

**Specs:**

1.  **Generative Schema Model:**
    *   Model Type: Large Language Model (LLM) – fine-tuned for schema prediction.  Consider a model like GPT-3 or a smaller, specialized model.
    *   Training Data:  A corpus of dataset schemas, data descriptions, and NLQs associated with those datasets.  Focus on datasets with rich metadata *and* those with minimal metadata to teach the model to "fill in the gaps."
    *   Input:  The NLQ, the initial candidate dataset schemas (column names, data types), and potentially a small sample of data from those datasets.
    *   Output: A ranked list of predicted schema augmentations.  These augmentations include:
        *   New column names (with inferred data types)
        *   Semantic tags for existing columns (e.g., “city”, “product category”, “date”)
        *   Relationships between columns (e.g., “foreign key”, “calculated field”)
        *   Potential values for categorical columns (e.g., top 5 most frequent values)

2.  **Integration with Existing Pipeline:**
    *   **Augmentation Stage:**  Insert a new stage into the query processing pipeline *after* the initial lexical query and *before* the S2S model.
    *   **Schema Scoring:**  Score each predicted schema augmentation based on:
        *   Model confidence score (from the generative model)
        *   Relevance to the NLQ (using semantic similarity metrics)
        *   Consistency with existing data (data type checks, value range validation)
    *   **Schema Filtering:**  Apply a threshold to select the top-N ranked schema augmentations.  The threshold should be configurable.
    *   **Schema Injection:**  Merge the selected schema augmentations into the existing candidate dataset schemas.  Handle potential naming conflicts (e.g., by appending a suffix).

3.  **S2S Model Adaptation:**
    *   The S2S model should be able to process schemas with dynamically added elements.  This may require retraining the model on a dataset that includes schemas with varying numbers of columns and metadata tags.
    *   Consider adding special tokens to the input sequence to indicate dynamically added schema elements.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function process_query(NLQ, candidate_datasets):
  # Existing pipeline steps (lexical query, etc.)
  ...

  # Dynamic Schema Augmentation
  predicted_augmentations = generate_schema_augmentations(NLQ, candidate_datasets)
  scored_augmentations = score_augmentations(predicted_augmentations, NLQ, candidate_datasets)
  selected_augmentations = filter_augmentations(scored_augmentations, threshold)
  augmented_datasets = merge_augmentations(candidate_datasets, selected_augmentations)

  # Pass augmented datasets to the S2S model
  IR = generate_intent_representation(NLQ, augmented_datasets)

  # Rest of the pipeline (visualization, etc.)
  ...
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy of intent representation.
*   Ability to handle datasets with sparse or poorly defined metadata.
*   Discovery of hidden relationships between data elements.
*   Enhanced user experience through more relevant and accurate visualizations.
