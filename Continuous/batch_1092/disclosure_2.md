**Distributed Temporal Data Shards with Proof-of-Location**

**Concept:** Leverage the bitmap/MAC keying scheme to build a system for distributed, temporally-aware data sharding *without* relying on centralized clocks or authorities. Instead, proof-of-location (PoL) derived from network latency establishes shard ownership and validity.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Sharding:** The data table is horizontally partitioned into shards based on a hash of a primary key column. Shard assignment is consistent.
2.  **Temporal Bitmap Generation:**  Instead of generating a static bitmap, a *temporal* bitmap is generated. Each bitmap represents rows matching a value *within a specific time window*.  Time windows are short (e.g., 1 second) to enable fine-grained temporal slicing.
3.  **MAC Generation – Location Aware:** The MAC is expanded to include network location information – specifically, the measured round-trip time (RTT) from the generating node to a set of geographically diverse reference nodes.  The RTT values, *quantized* and added to the MAC tuple (table name, column ID, value, RTT_NorthAmerica, RTT_Europe, RTT_Asia), create a unique MAC per location/time.
4.  **Shard Ownership & Proof-of-Location:**  Each shard is assigned a “location profile” – a set of expected RTT ranges to the reference nodes.  A node attempting to access a shard must generate the MAC (including its measured RTTs), and if the generated MAC matches the shard’s profile (within tolerance), it is granted access.  This is the “Proof-of-Location.”
5.  **Distributed Storage:** Shards (encrypted bitmaps and corresponding data segments) are stored on a distributed key-value store (e.g., Cassandra, ScyllaDB).
6.  **Bitmap Compaction & Merging:** Roaring Bitmaps are used for efficient storage and merging.  Periodic compaction merges temporal bitmaps within a rolling window to optimize query performance.
7.  **Query Processing:** Queries specify a time range. The system identifies the relevant temporal bitmaps, fetches the corresponding shards, and processes the data. The MAC is re-generated during query processing to ensure the validity of the data.

**Pseudocode (Shard Access):**

```
function accessShard(shardKey, value, timestamp):
  // Get shard location profile (expected RTT ranges)
  profile = getShardProfile(shardKey)

  // Measure RTT to reference nodes
  rtts = measureRTTs()  // Returns {RTT_NA, RTT_EU, RTT_AS}

  // Generate MAC
  mac = generateMAC(table_name, column_id, value, rtts)

  // Compare MAC with shard's MAC
  if (mac == shardMAC):
    // Access granted
    return getShardData(shardKey)
  else:
    // Access denied
    throw Error("Invalid shard access")
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Byzantine Fault Tolerance:** Incorporate techniques to mitigate malicious nodes providing incorrect RTTs.
*   **Dynamic Shard Assignment:** Adapt shard assignments based on network conditions and node availability.
*   **Data Replication:** Replicate shards across multiple nodes for increased availability and fault tolerance.
