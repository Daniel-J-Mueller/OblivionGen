## Adaptive Traffic Shunting with Predictive Behavioral Analysis

**Specification:** A system for dynamic network traffic redirection based on predicted behavioral anomalies, integrating with existing packet encapsulation techniques.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of solely reacting to suspicious traffic *after* analysis, proactively shunt potentially anomalous traffic to dedicated analysis pipelines *before* full payload inspection, utilizing a lightweight prediction model.

**Components:**

1.  **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical network traffic data. This model predicts the likelihood of a packet stream deviating from established behavioral norms.  Features used for prediction:
    *   Source/Destination IP address pairs
    *   Port numbers
    *   Packet inter-arrival times
    *   Packet sizes
    *   Flow duration (estimated)
    *   Time of day/week

2.  **Shunt Controller:** A module residing on the network switch (or a dedicated appliance). It receives predictions from the Prediction Engine.  Based on a configurable risk threshold, the Shunt Controller decides whether to encapsulate and redirect a packet stream.

3.  **Dynamic Encapsulation Module:**  This module handles packet encapsulation for redirection. It’s an enhanced version of the encapsulation described in the reference patent, but with key differences:
    *   **Variable Encapsulation:** Not all packets in a potentially anomalous stream are immediately encapsulated. Initial packets are flagged and monitored. If subsequent packets confirm the anomaly (based on further prediction engine output or preliminary analysis), full encapsulation is initiated.  This minimizes overhead for legitimate traffic incorrectly flagged.
    *   **Metadata Enrichment:** Encapsulated packets include *prediction scores* from the Prediction Engine and preliminary metadata derived from the initial packet analysis (e.g., flags indicating initial anomaly indicators).

4.  **Analysis Pipeline:** A dedicated set of analysis hosts optimized for processing pre-filtered and enriched traffic. This allows for faster and more focused analysis.

**Pseudocode – Shunt Controller:**

```
function process_packet(packet):
  prediction_score = PredictionEngine.predict(packet)

  if prediction_score > risk_threshold:
    # Initial Anomaly - Flag & Monitor
    flag_packet(packet, prediction_score)
    monitor_flow(packet) # Track subsequent packets in this flow

    # Wait for confirmation (e.g., 3 subsequent packets also show high scores)
    if confirmation_reached():
      # Full Encapsulation
      encapsulated_packet = DynamicEncapsulationModule.encapsulate(packet, prediction_score)
      send_to_analysis_host(encapsulated_packet)
  else:
    # Normal Traffic - Process as usual
    process_normal_traffic(packet)
```

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing network switches can be adapted with FPGA or dedicated ASIC for the Shunt Controller and Dynamic Encapsulation Module. Dedicated analysis hosts with high-performance CPUs and memory.
*   **Software:** Prediction Engine implemented using a machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Shunt Controller and Dynamic Encapsulation Module implemented in C++ or Rust for performance.
*   **Network Integration:** Compatible with existing network protocols (TCP/IP, UDP).
*   **Scalability:**  The system should be able to handle high-volume network traffic without performance degradation. Distributed architecture for the Prediction Engine and Analysis Pipeline.

**Novelty:** This system shifts from *reactive* to *proactive* threat detection by predicting potentially anomalous traffic *before* full inspection.  Variable encapsulation minimizes overhead, and metadata enrichment accelerates analysis. It's a layer above the standard 'split and inspect' model, adding a predictive element to filter traffic more efficiently.
