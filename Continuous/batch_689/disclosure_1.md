# 10623476

## API Orchestration with Predictive Pre-fetching & Dynamic Payload Shaping

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive API Prefetcher & Payload Shaper (PAPSh)
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Moderate - can be implemented on existing endpoint management infrastructure. Benefits from dedicated caching layer (SSD recommended).
*   **Software Requirements:** Integration with existing API mapping definitions (as per patent 10623476). Machine learning library (TensorFlow, PyTorch). Real-time data streaming capability (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

**Innovation Description:**

Extend the existing API mapping system with a proactive component that *predicts* API call sequences and prefetches results, coupled with a system that dynamically shapes payloads based on the client's network conditions and device capabilities.

**Detailed Functionality:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiling:** PAPSh monitors API call patterns associated with each user/application. This data is used to build behavioral profiles, identifying frequently occurring API sequences (e.g., API A -> API B -> API C).

2.  **Predictive Prefetching:** Based on the behavioral profiles, PAPSh proactively fetches results for likely subsequent API calls. These results are cached, reducing latency for future requests.  The prediction model is continuously refined using real-time data.

3.  **Dynamic Payload Shaping:** PAPSh analyzes the client's network conditions (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) and device capabilities (screen size, processing power).  It then dynamically shapes the payloads returned from the backend APIs.

    *   **Compression:** Higher compression ratios for low-bandwidth connections.
    *   **Image/Video Resolution:** Downscaling images/videos for smaller screens or slower connections.
    *   **Data Filtering:** Returning only the necessary data fields for the client's current task.
    *   **Serialization Format:** Switching between JSON, Protocol Buffers, or other formats based on network conditions.

4.  **API Mapping Integration:** The existing API mapping definitions are extended with new parameters:

    *   `prefetch_probability`: A value (0-1) indicating the probability of prefetching the backend API result.
    *   `payload_shaping_profile`: A profile ID specifying the payload shaping rules to apply.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// API Execution Flow (Modified)
function executeProxyAPI(proxyAPIRequest) {

  backendAPI = determineBackendAPI(proxyAPIRequest);

  // Check if prefetching is enabled
  if (apiMapping.prefetch_probability > 0 && !isPrefetched(backendAPI)) {
    prefetchBackendAPI(backendAPI);
  }

  // Fetch result (from cache if available)
  result = fetchBackendAPIResult(backendAPI);

  // Apply payload shaping
  shapedResult = shapePayload(result, apiMapping.payload_shaping_profile, clientNetworkInfo);

  return shapedResult;
}

function shapePayload(result, profileID, clientNetworkInfo) {
  // Load payload shaping rules from profileID
  rules = loadPayloadShapingRules(profileID);

  // Apply rules based on clientNetworkInfo
  shapedResult = applyShapingRules(result, rules, clientNetworkInfo);

  return shapedResult;
}

function applyShapingRules(result, rules, clientNetworkInfo) {
  // Example rules:
  // - If bandwidth < 1 Mbps, compress images by 50%
  // - If screen size < 600px, reduce image resolution
  // - If CPU usage > 80%, reduce data fields

  // ... implementation details ...

  return shapedResult;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Latency:** Prefetching minimizes delays for frequently accessed APIs.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Dynamic payload shaping optimizes performance for various network conditions and devices.
*   **Reduced Bandwidth Consumption:** Smaller payloads conserve bandwidth.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** Offloading some processing to the endpoint management system can improve backend API scalability.
