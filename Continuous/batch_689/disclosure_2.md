## Dynamic Interface Grouping & Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the multipath routing concept beyond static groups to *dynamically* form and dissolve interface groupings based on real-time link quality *prediction*, not just congestion reaction. This moves beyond simply diverting traffic *after* congestion occurs to proactively shaping traffic flow based on anticipated bottlenecks.

**Specs:**

*   **Link Quality Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Historical and real-time link metrics (latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization).  Data is collected *per interface*.
    *   Algorithm:  A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict short-term (e.g., 50-100ms) link quality for each interface.  The LSTM should be trained *offline* with extensive datasets simulating varied network traffic patterns and failure scenarios. Online adaptation of weights should be limited to prevent instability.
    *   Output: A 'quality score' (0-100) for each interface, representing predicted performance.

*   **Dynamic Group Formation Logic:**
    *   Input:  Quality scores from the Link Quality Prediction Module.
    *   Algorithm: A clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) operates on interface quality scores.  The algorithm aims to create groups of interfaces with *similar* predicted performance.  The number of clusters (groups) is dynamically adjusted based on network load. Higher load = more groups.  A minimum group size threshold prevents the creation of excessively small groups.
    *   Output: A continuously updated mapping of interfaces to dynamic groups.

*   **Intelligent Hash Function with Group Awareness:**
    *   Function: A hash function that incorporates both the destination address AND the dynamic group ID of the interface.
    *   Implementation: The destination address is used as the primary hash key.  The dynamic group ID is used as a secondary key, influencing the hash output. This ensures that flows are distributed *across* dynamic groups, leveraging interfaces with similar predicted performance.
    *   Output: A hash value used to select the output interface.

*   **Flow Steering Table:**
    *   Data Structure: A table mapping destination address prefixes to dynamic group IDs. This allows for coarse-grained steering of traffic to particular groups.
    *   Update Mechanism: Updated by a central control plane (e.g., SDN controller) based on network-wide policies and real-time performance data.

**Pseudocode (Flow Steering Logic):**

```
function select_output_interface(packet):
  destination_address = packet.destination_address
  prefix_match = longest_prefix_match(destination_address, flow_steering_table)

  if prefix_match:
    dynamic_group_id = flow_steering_table[prefix_match]
    // Select interface within the dynamic group
    interface = select_interface_within_group(dynamic_group_id)
    return interface
  else:
    // No specific steering rule - use default hash-based steering
    hash_value = hash(packet.destination_address)
    interface = select_interface_by_hash(hash_value)
    return interface

function select_interface_by_hash(hash_value):
  // Distribute hash value across interfaces in the current hash range
  return interface_array[hash_value % interface_array.length]

function select_interface_within_group(dynamic_group_id):
    //Select interface within the dynamic group using a secondary hash function
    secondary_hash = hash(packet.destination_address) % dynamic_group_id.interface_count
    return dynamic_group_id.interfaces[secondary_hash]

```

**Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Load Balancing:**  Shifts traffic *before* congestion occurs, improving overall network performance.
*   **Adaptive to Dynamic Network Conditions:**  Constantly adjusts to changing link quality, providing a robust and resilient network.
*   **Granular Control:** Allows for fine-grained steering of traffic based on both destination address and network conditions.
*   **Potential for Integration with AI-Powered Network Optimization:** Provides a rich dataset of network performance data for machine learning algorithms.
