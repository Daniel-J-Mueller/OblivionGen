## Dynamic Memory Partitioning & Predictive Scrubbing

**Concept:** Adapt the memory scrubbing system to dynamically partition memory based on access patterns and *predict* potential errors *before* they occur, focusing scrubbing resources on high-risk areas.  This moves beyond reactive correction to proactive maintenance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Monitor (APM):** Dedicated hardware module integrated with the memory controller. Monitors read/write access patterns to each memory region in real-time.  Outputs statistical data (frequency, recency, type of access) to the Predictive Error Engine (PEE).
*   **Predictive Error Engine (PEE):** A dedicated processing unit (FPGA or specialized ASIC). Receives data from the APM.  Employs machine learning algorithms (trained offline with historical data & system logs) to predict the probability of errors occurring in specific memory regions.  Outputs a “Risk Score” for each memory partition.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning Module (DPM):** Software/firmware module interfacing with the memory controller. Allows for real-time creation, resizing, and relocation of memory partitions.  Driven by the Risk Scores from the PEE.
*   **Enhanced Memory Controller:** Existing memory controller extended with DMA redirection capabilities.  Can redirect DMA requests to different memory partitions based on DPM instructions.

**2. Software/Firmware:**

*   **Risk Score Algorithm:** Machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, Gradient Boosted Trees) trained on historical memory error data, access patterns, temperature sensors, voltage levels, and system logs. Outputs a Risk Score (0-100) for each memory partition.  Must be retrainable online.
*   **Partitioning Policy Engine:** Logic determining how to adjust partition sizes and relocate data based on Risk Scores. Rules may include:
    *   If Risk Score > Threshold_High:  Shrink partition, move data to a different memory bank, initiate aggressive scrubbing.
    *   If Risk Score > Threshold_Medium:  Increase scrubbing frequency.
    *   If Risk Score < Threshold_Low:  Reduce scrubbing frequency, potentially put partition into a low-power mode.
*   **DMA Redirection Service:** Handles redirection of DMA requests based on partition assignments. Minimizes performance impact.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  The APM monitors memory access patterns in real-time.
2.  The APM transmits access pattern data to the PEE.
3.  The PEE calculates Risk Scores for each memory partition.
4.  The Partitioning Policy Engine evaluates Risk Scores and determines necessary partition adjustments.
5.  The DPM reconfigures memory partitions dynamically, moving data as needed.
6.  The Enhanced Memory Controller redirects DMA requests to the appropriate partitions.
7.  Memory scrubbing frequency is adjusted per partition based on Risk Score.
8.  System logs and access pattern data are continuously collected to retrain the Risk Score Algorithm.

**4. Pseudocode (Partitioning Policy Engine):**

```
function adjust_partitions(risk_scores, current_partitions) {
  for each partition in current_partitions {
    if (risk_scores[partition.id] > THRESHOLD_HIGH) {
      shrink_partition(partition);
      move_data(partition, safe_location());
      increase_scrubbing(safe_location());
    } else if (risk_scores[partition.id] > THRESHOLD_MEDIUM) {
      increase_scrubbing(partition);
    } else {
      decrease_scrubbing(partition);
    }
  }
}

function safe_location() {
  // Logic to identify a low-risk memory location
  // Consider memory bank health, temperature, and recent activity
  return best_available_location;
}
```

**5. Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced frequency of uncorrectable errors.
*   Improved system reliability.
*   Optimized memory scrubbing resource allocation.
*   Extended memory lifespan.
*   Proactive error prevention.
