## Dynamic Policy Inheritance via Ephemeral Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the access control framework to allow resource instances to *temporarily* inherit permissions from parent resources or roles, not through static policy assignment, but via short-lived, dynamically generated credentials. This creates a fine-grained, time-boxed permission escalation system.

**Specs:**

**1. Credential Generation Service (CGS):**

*   **Input:** Resource Identifier (RID) of requesting resource, Parent RID (or Role identifier), Requested Action(s), Time-to-Live (TTL) in seconds.
*   **Process:**
    *   Validate requesting resource's access to request credentials on behalf of the parent/role.
    *   Generate a cryptographically signed, ephemeral credential (EC) containing:
        *   RID of requesting resource.
        *   RID of parent/role.
        *   List of allowed actions.
        *   TTL.
        *   Digital signature verifiable by the access control service.
    *   Return EC to requesting resource.

**2. Encapsulation Layer Modification:**

*   When a resource attempts to establish a connection, it checks if it possesses a valid EC for the target resource/action.
*   If a valid EC exists:
    *   The EC is included (or referenced via a unique ID) in the encapsulated packet alongside standard source/destination information.
*   If no EC exists, standard policy evaluation proceeds as before.

**3. Access Control Service Enhancement:**

*   Upon receiving a packet:
    *   If an EC is present:
        *   Verify the EC's signature and TTL.
        *   If valid, *immediately* grant access based on the permissions within the EC, bypassing the standard policy lookup.
        *   If invalid or expired, fall back to standard policy evaluation.
    *   If no EC is present, proceed with standard policy evaluation.

**4. Policy Definition Update:**

*   Introduce a new policy directive: `allow_credential_request(ResourceID, Action)`.  This allows a resource to specify which actions it is allowed to request credentials for on behalf of its children.

**Pseudocode (Encapsulation Layer):**

```
function encapsulatePacket(sourceRID, targetRID, action, packetData):
  credential = getCredential(targetRID, action) // Retrieve from local cache or credential manager

  if credential != null and credential.isValid():
    encapsulatedPacket = createEncapsulatedPacket(sourceRID, targetRID, action, packetData, credential)
    return encapsulatedPacket
  else:
    // Standard policy evaluation
    policyResult = accessControlService.evaluatePolicy(sourceRID, targetRID, action)
    if policyResult == ALLOW:
      encapsulatedPacket = createEncapsulatedPacket(sourceRID, targetRID, action, packetData)
      return encapsulatedPacket
    else:
      dropPacket()
      return null
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Just-In-Time Access:** Grant temporary elevated privileges for specific tasks without modifying base policies.
*   **Delegated Permissions:** Allow resources to temporarily act on behalf of others, with limited scope.
*   **Dynamic Scaling:**  Automatically grant permissions to new instances spun up within a resource group, based on pre-defined roles and TTLs.
*   **Automated Remediation:**  Allow a monitoring service to temporarily gain access to correct misconfigurations.

**Novelty:** The combination of ephemeral credentials *integrated directly into the encapsulation layer* and the policy-driven request mechanism creates a highly flexible and auditable access control system that moves beyond static rule sets.  It's a dynamic permission escalation model, not just a static policy enforcement system.
