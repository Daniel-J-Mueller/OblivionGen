## Adaptive Replication Granularity

**Concept:** Expand upon the tiered replication concept by introducing *dynamic* data subsetting based on real-time data change frequency and target database capacity/priority. Instead of pre-defined subsets, the system intelligently determines *which* elements to replicate at any given moment, optimizing for speed, resource usage, and data consistency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Change Monitoring Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors the source database for data changes (inserts, updates, deletes).
*   **Output:** Generates a “Change Event Stream” – a time-ordered list of modified data elements, including timestamps, element identifiers, and change type.
*   **Algorithm:** Uses database transaction logs or change data capture (CDC) mechanisms.

**2. Granularity Assessment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Change Event Stream, Target Database Profiles (capacity, priority, replication lag tolerance), Historical Change Frequency Data.
*   **Function:** Analyzes change frequency for each data element.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Maintains a rolling window of change events for each element.
    *   Calculates change frequency (events/time unit).
    *   Applies a thresholding mechanism.  Elements exceeding a high frequency threshold are considered “hot” and warrant immediate replication. Elements below a low threshold are considered “cold” and can be deferred or aggregated.
    *   Considers target database capacity and priority. Higher-priority databases receive “hot” data first, while lower-priority databases may receive aggregated or deferred data.
*   **Output:**  “Replication Granularity Profile” – a list of data elements with associated replication priorities (Immediate, Deferred, Aggregated) and target database assignments.

**3. Dynamic Replication Scheduler:**

*   **Input:** Replication Granularity Profile, Network Resource Availability, Target Database Status.
*   **Function:**  Schedules replication tasks based on priorities and resource constraints.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Prioritizes “Immediate” replication tasks.
    *   For “Deferred” and “Aggregated” tasks, applies a queuing mechanism that considers network bandwidth, target database load, and replication lag tolerance.
    *   Employs a "sliding window" approach to batch updates, minimizing network overhead.
*   **Output:** Replication Task List – a prioritized list of replication tasks with associated data elements and target databases.

**4. Metadata Enhancement:**

*   Expand metadata table to include:
    *   Replication Granularity Level (Immediate, Deferred, Aggregated)
    *   Last Replication Timestamp
    *   Replication Status (Pending, In Progress, Completed, Failed)
    *   Change Frequency Score

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Change Monitoring Module
function monitorDatabaseChanges() {
  // Capture database transaction logs or use CDC
  changeEvents = getChangeEvents();
  return changeEvents;
}

// Granularity Assessment Engine
function assessGranularity(changeEvents, targetDatabaseProfiles, historicalData) {
  for each event in changeEvents {
    elementId = event.elementId;
    changeFrequency = calculateChangeFrequency(elementId, historicalData);
    priority = determinePriority(changeFrequency, targetDatabaseProfiles);
    replicationProfile[elementId] = { priority: priority, targetDatabase: selectTarget(priority) };
  }
  return replicationProfile;
}

// Dynamic Replication Scheduler
function scheduleReplication(replicationProfile, networkResources, targetDatabaseStatus) {
  taskQueue = [];
  for each element in replicationProfile {
    if (element.priority == "Immediate") {
      createReplicationTask(element.elementId, element.targetDatabase);
      addTaskToQueue(taskQueue, replicationTask);
    } else if (element.priority == "Deferred") {
      // Apply queuing logic based on network resources and database status
      // Batch updates to minimize overhead
    }
  }
  return taskQueue;
}
```

**Novelty:**

This adaptive granularity approach moves beyond static data subsetting to a dynamic, context-aware system that optimizes replication based on real-time data characteristics and resource constraints. This offers significant advantages in terms of performance, scalability, and resource utilization compared to traditional tiered replication methods.
