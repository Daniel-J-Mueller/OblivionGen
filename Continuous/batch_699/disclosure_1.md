## Dynamic Actor Affinity Scoring & Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Extend the existing actor migration logic by introducing a dynamic affinity scoring system that *predicts* communication patterns, rather than reacting to observed frequency. This system aims to proactively position actors based on anticipated interaction, minimizing latency before communication even begins.

**Specifications:**

**1. Affinity Score Components:**

*   **Historical Interaction:** (Weight: 20%) -  Average message rate between actors over a rolling window (e.g., last hour, day).  This mirrors existing functionality but serves as a baseline.
*   **Semantic Similarity:** (Weight: 40%) - Analyze actor message payloads (where applicable and with appropriate privacy considerations) using NLP techniques to determine semantic similarity. Higher similarity implies a stronger potential for interaction.  This requires a configurable “similarity threshold” to filter noise.
*   **Workflow Dependency:** (Weight: 30%) –  A configurable workflow graph that defines actor dependencies.  Actors involved in sequential or parallel tasks within the workflow receive higher affinity scores. This allows system-level optimization based on business logic.  Workflow definitions are external and dynamically loaded.
*   **Predictive Modeling (Future Enhancement):** Incorporate a time-series forecasting model trained on historical interaction data to *predict* future communication patterns. This is a long-term goal.

**2. Affinity Score Calculation:**

`AffinityScore(ActorA, ActorB) = (HistoricalInteractionWeight * HistoricalInteractionScore) + (SemanticSimilarityWeight * SemanticSimilarityScore) + (WorkflowDependencyWeight * WorkflowDependencyScore)`

Where each individual score is normalized between 0 and 1.

**3. Migration Trigger:**

*   A migration is triggered when the `AffinityScore(ActorA, ActorB)` exceeds a configurable threshold *and* a cost-benefit analysis (described below) justifies the migration.

**4. Cost-Benefit Analysis:**

*   **Cost:**  The overhead of migrating the actor (e.g., serialization/deserialization, network transfer).
*   **Benefit:**  Estimated reduction in latency due to closer proximity to the target actor.  Calculated based on network topology and estimated message frequency.
*   A migration proceeds only if `Benefit > Cost`.

**5. Dynamic Network Topology Awareness:**

*   The system must be aware of the underlying network topology (e.g., rack locations, network bandwidth, latency).  This information is obtained through a dedicated network discovery service.

**6. Pseudocode: Migration Decision Loop**

```
For each ActorA in the System:
  For each other ActorB in the System:
    affinityScore = CalculateAffinityScore(ActorA, ActorB)
    If affinityScore > migrationThreshold:
      migrationCost = CalculateMigrationCost(ActorA)
      migrationBenefit = CalculateMigrationBenefit(ActorA, ActorB)
      If migrationBenefit > migrationCost:
        DetermineBestDestinationServer(ActorA, ActorB) // Considers network topology, server load, etc.
        InitiateActorMigration(ActorA, DestinationServer)
```

**7. Server Load Balancing Integration:**

*   The `DetermineBestDestinationServer` function must integrate with a server load balancing service to ensure that the destination server is not overloaded.

**8. Monitoring & Feedback:**

*   Monitor the performance of migrated actors (latency, throughput) to refine the affinity scoring model and migration thresholds.
*   Implement an automated feedback loop to adjust parameters based on observed performance.
