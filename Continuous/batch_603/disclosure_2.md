## Dynamic Acoustic Zoning with Predictive Handoff

**Concept:** Expand on the multi-device awareness to create dynamically shifting "acoustic zones" within an environment. Instead of simply prioritizing one device as primary, intelligently route audio processing (wake word detection, intent recognition, audio playback) *between* devices based on user location, ambient noise, and predicted movement.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each device (speaker, microphone array, smart display) needs a wideband microphone and a low-power ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for precise indoor positioning (alternative: Bluetooth AoA/AoD for cost reduction, but lower precision).
    *   Increased on-board processing for acoustic event detection and directional audio analysis.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Zone Mapping Module:**  Creates a dynamic map of the environment, dividing it into acoustic zones. Zones are defined by physical boundaries (walls, furniture) and adjusted based on ongoing acoustic analysis (sound reflections, noise sources).  UWB/Bluetooth data is fused with acoustic data to refine zone boundaries and user position.
    *   **User Tracking Module:** Continuously estimates user location within the environment using sensor fusion (UWB/Bluetooth, microphone array direction-of-arrival estimation, optional camera-based tracking). Kalman filtering or similar techniques applied for smoothing and prediction.
    *   **Acoustic Beamforming and Steering:** Implement advanced beamforming algorithms to direct audio input to the appropriate device based on user location. Dynamically steer audio beams to suppress noise and improve speech recognition.
    *   **Predictive Handoff Algorithm:**  This is the core innovation.  Based on user movement prediction (historical data, real-time tracking), the system *proactively* transfers audio processing tasks from one device to another *before* the user physically moves into the new zone.  Algorithm considers:
        *   User velocity and direction.
        *   Distance to zone boundaries.
        *   Processing load on each device.
        *   Network latency between devices.
    *   **Distributed Audio Processing:** Offload computationally intensive tasks (wake word detection, natural language understanding) to the device with the most available processing power or the most favorable acoustic environment.
    *   **Wake-on-Proximity:** Instead of always listening, devices can enter a low-power sleep mode and "wake up" only when a user is detected within their acoustic zone.
    *   **Zone-Specific Profiles:** Allow users to customize the acoustic experience within each zone (e.g., preferred volume, music genre, news sources).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Handoff):**

```
FUNCTION PredictiveHandoff(userLocation, userVelocity, zoneMap, deviceStatus)

  // Calculate time-to-boundary for each adjacent zone
  FOR each adjacentZone IN zoneMap
    timeToBoundary[adjacentZone] = CalculateTimeToBoundary(userLocation, userVelocity, adjacentZone)
  ENDFOR

  // Determine the "target" zone with the shortest time-to-boundary
  targetZone = FindMin(timeToBoundary)

  // Evaluate device status in targetZone
  IF deviceStatus[targetZone].processingLoad > threshold OR deviceStatus[targetZone].signalStrength < threshold
    // If targetZone device is overloaded or has poor signal, prioritize another zone
    alternateZone = FindAlternateZone(targetZone, deviceStatus)
  ELSE
    alternateZone = targetZone
  ENDIF

  // Calculate handover time
  handoverTime = EstimateHandoverTime(userVelocity, networkLatency)

  // Initiate handover IF handoverTime < timeToBoundary[alternateZone]
  IF handoverTime < timeToBoundary[alternateZone]
    TransferAudioProcessing(currentDevice, alternateDevice)
    AdjustBeamforming(alternateDevice, userLocation)
  ENDIF

ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Seamless acoustic experience as users move throughout the environment.
*   Improved speech recognition accuracy.
*   Reduced latency.
*   Lower power consumption.
*   Enhanced privacy (selective listening).
