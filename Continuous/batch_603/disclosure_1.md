## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Multi-Device Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Extend the in-ear beamforming system to not just isolate and process audio, but *reconstruct* a localized 3D acoustic scene for the user, enhancing spatial awareness and enabling advanced AR/VR applications or personalized soundscapes. This builds on the existing microphone array by leveraging inter-device communication and advanced signal processing.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   In-ear audio devices (minimum two) â€“ each equipped with the existing three-microphone array (external x2, in-canal x1).
    *   Ultra-wideband (UWB) or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) direction finding module in each device for precise inter-device localization (cm-level accuracy).
    *   Dedicated co-processor in each device for real-time signal processing and inter-device communication.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Phase Coherence Mapping:** Utilize the UWB/BLE data to establish precise relative positions between the two (or more) in-ear devices.  Calculate phase differences in the received audio signals across the devices. High phase coherence indicates a common sound source.
    *   **Source Localization:** Employ Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and/or beamforming techniques to estimate the 3D location of dominant sound sources. The system will calculate the location relative to the user's head.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Reconstruction:**  Create a point cloud representing the acoustic environment. Each point represents a sound source with associated amplitude and frequency information. This point cloud will update in real-time.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering:** Render the reconstructed acoustic scene using Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) personalized to the user (potentially learned through initial calibration).  This creates a realistic 3D soundscape.
    *   **Sound Source Tagging and Filtering:**  Implement a machine learning model that identifies and tags sound sources (e.g., speech, music, vehicle noise).  Allow the user to filter or prioritize specific sound sources.
    *   **AR/VR Integration:**  Output the reconstructed acoustic scene data to an AR/VR headset for seamless integration with visual environments.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Scene Reconstruction):**

```
//Device A (left ear), Device B (right ear)
//Each device receives audio data from its microphones

//1. Localization (UWB/BLE)
deviceA_position = get_position_deviceA()
deviceB_position = get_position_deviceB()

//2. Audio Processing (Device A & B - parallel)
audio_data_A = process_audio(mic_array_A) //Beamforming, noise reduction
audio_data_B = process_audio(mic_array_B)

//3. Cross-Correlation (Centralized or Distributed)
cross_correlation_result = calculate_cross_correlation(audio_data_A, audio_data_B, deviceA_position, deviceB_position)

//4. Source Localization (Based on cross-correlation peaks)
source_location = estimate_source_location(cross_correlation_result)

//5. Acoustic Scene Point Cloud Update
acoustic_scene.add_point(source_location, amplitude, frequency)

//6. Spatial Audio Rendering (on each device)
rendered_audio = render_3D_sound(acoustic_scene, user_head_orientation, HRTF)

//Output rendered_audio to earbuds
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced situational awareness for cyclists/pedestrians.
*   Immersive AR/VR experiences with realistic spatial audio.
*   Personalized soundscapes for relaxation/focus.
*   Assistive listening devices for individuals with hearing impairments.
*   Advanced teleconferencing/communication systems.
