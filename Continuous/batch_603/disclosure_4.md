## Robotic Swarm Choreography via Predictive Imitation

**System Specifications:**

*   **Robotic Platform:** Modular, multi-legged robots (6-8 legs) with onboard processing and communication. Each robot equipped with depth cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs). Payload capacity: 500g.
*   **Central Control:** Distributed network, no single point of failure. Communication via 60GHz millimeter wave for low latency.
*   **Data Acquisition:**  High-resolution (4K) multi-camera system capturing human demonstrations of complex manipulation tasks (e.g., assembling a small device, preparing a simple meal).  Captures both visual data *and* full-body motion capture of the demonstrator.
*   **AI Core:** Hierarchical reinforcement learning architecture. 
    *   **Level 1 (Individual Robot Control):**  Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs) trained to predict immediate robot actions (joint velocities, foot placements) based on visual input and internal state (IMU data). CRNNs trained using imitation learning from the demonstration data.
    *   **Level 2 (Swarm Coordination):**  Graph Neural Network (GNN) predicting collective swarm behavior based on the predicted actions of individual robots and the overall task goals.  The GNN learns *inter-robot* dependencies.  The GNN outputs desired “formation vectors” for each robot, influencing its Level 1 CRNN.
    *    **Level 3 (Predictive Interference):** A separate predictive model which *estimates the future states* of all robots in the swarm, based on current actions and predicted trajectories. This model is used for *collision avoidance and interference mitigation*. The output of this model feeds into both Level 1 and Level 2, adjusting actions and formations to prevent collisions *before* they happen.
*   **Reward Function:** Multi-objective:
    *   Task Completion:  Based on proximity to desired end state.
    *   Collision Avoidance:  High negative reward for collisions.
    *   Energy Efficiency:  Minimize joint movement and power consumption.
    *   Formation Cohesion:  Reward robots for maintaining a desired relative spacing and orientation.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Demonstration Phase:** A human demonstrator performs the desired task, recording both visual and motion capture data.
2.  **Model Training:**  Data is used to train the CRNNs, GNN, and Predictive Interference Model.
3.  **Swarm Deployment:** Robots are deployed into the environment.
4.  **Task Execution:**
    *   The GNN receives high-level task goals.
    *   The GNN generates desired formation vectors for each robot.
    *   Each robot’s CRNN receives visual input and the formation vector.
    *   The CRNN predicts immediate actions.
    *   The Predictive Interference Model *anticipates* potential collisions and adjusts actions *before* they occur.
    *   The process repeats iteratively, achieving complex coordinated behavior.

**Pseudocode (Simplified - Predictive Interference Component):**

```python
# Given: current_robot_states (list of robot positions, velocities), 
#       predicted_robot_actions (list of actions predicted by CRNNs)

def predict_future_states(current_robot_states, predicted_robot_actions, time_horizon):
  # Simulate robot motion over time_horizon 
  future_states = []
  for t in range(time_horizon):
    new_states = simulate_motion(current_robot_states, predicted_robot_actions)
    future_states.append(new_states)
    current_robot_states = new_states
  return future_states

def detect_collisions(future_states):
  # Check for collisions between robots in future_states
  collision_pairs = []
  for t in range(len(future_states)):
    for i in range(len(future_states[t])):
      for j in range(i+1, len(future_states[t])):
        if distance(future_states[t][i], future_states[t][j]) < collision_threshold:
          collision_pairs.append((i, j, t))
  return collision_pairs

def adjust_actions(predicted_robot_actions, collision_pairs):
  # Modify predicted_robot_actions to avoid collisions
  for i, j, t in collision_pairs:
    # Apply a repulsive force to the actions of robots i and j
    predicted_robot_actions[i] = apply_repulsive_force(predicted_robot_actions[i], future_states[t][j])
    predicted_robot_actions[j] = apply_repulsive_force(predicted_robot_actions[j], future_states[t][i])
  return predicted_robot_actions
```

**Innovation:** This system focuses on *proactive* collision avoidance through predictive modeling, rather than reactive collision response. The swarm learns to anticipate interference and adjusts its behavior *before* collisions occur, enabling more complex and robust coordinated actions.  The emphasis is on learning *collective* behavior and preemptively resolving potential issues.
