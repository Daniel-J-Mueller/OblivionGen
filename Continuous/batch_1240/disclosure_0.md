## Dynamic Lexicon Morphing with Contextual Embedding

**Concept:** Expand upon the multi-lingual pronunciation prediction by introducing a system that dynamically alters lexicon entries *during* speech recognition based on real-time contextual embeddings derived from the *entire* utterance, not just the isolated word. This moves beyond static hybrid pronunciations to fluid, adaptive phoneme representation.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Embedding Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio stream (from microphone) & Initial lexicon (containing potential pronunciations, language origins, scores).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a deep learning model (Transformer architecture preferred) trained on a massive multilingual speech corpus.
    *   The model generates contextual embeddings for *each* audio frame, capturing phonetic and semantic information *relative* to the entire utterance.
    *   The model outputs a dynamic ‘context vector’ representing the overarching linguistic environment.
*   **Output:**  Dynamic Context Vector.

**2. Lexicon Morphing Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Initial Lexicon entry for a target word (including base pronunciations, language scores), Dynamic Context Vector.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each potential pronunciation within the lexicon entry:
        *   Calculate a ‘compatibility score’ between the pronunciation's phoneme sequence and the Dynamic Context Vector. (Dot product or similar similarity metric).
        *   Adjust the pronunciation’s score in the lexicon *in real-time* based on this compatibility. Higher compatibility = increased score.
        *   Potentially *morph* the phoneme sequence itself.  For example, if the context vector suggests a particular phonetic assimilation (e.g., 'nt' becoming 'n' in casual speech), apply a slight phonetic shift to the pronunciation. This utilizes a pre-trained phonetic transition model.
*   **Output:**  Morphing Lexicon entry (adjusted scores, potentially modified phoneme sequences).

**3. ASR Integration:**

*   Standard ASR pipeline, but with the following modification:
    *   Prior to decoding each word, the Lexicon Morphing Engine adjusts the lexicon entry.
    *   The ASR decoder utilizes the dynamically adjusted lexicon to perform recognition.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
lexicon = load_lexicon()
context_model = load_pretrained_context_model()

// Real-time processing loop
while (audio_available()):
    audio_frame = get_audio_frame()
    context_vector = context_model.process(audio_frame)

    for word in recognized_words:
        lexicon_entry = lexicon[word]
        for pronunciation in lexicon_entry.pronunciations:
            compatibility_score = dot_product(pronunciation.phonemes, context_vector)
            pronunciation.score += compatibility_score * weight_factor //weight factor tuned during training
            // Optionally morph pronunciation based on phonetic transition model
            modified_phonemes = phonetic_transition_model.apply(pronunciation.phonemes, context_vector)
            pronunciation.phonemes = modified_phonemes

        //Update lexicon with morphing values

    //Perform speech recognition using updated lexicon
    recognized_text = asr_decoder.decode(audio_frame, lexicon)
    output_text = recognized_text
```

**Training:**

*   Train the context model on a large, diverse multilingual speech corpus.
*   Train the phonetic transition model on a corpus of speech with labeled phonetic variations.
*   Fine-tune the weight factor and other parameters using a reinforcement learning approach. Reward the system for accurate recognition and natural-sounding pronunciations.
