## Adaptive Shard Prefetching & Reconstruction

**Specification:** Implement a system for predicting data access patterns within sharded data streams, prefetching shard segments, and reconstructing records *before* a retrieval request completes. This leverages a probabilistic model trained on historical access data and incorporates a ‘reconstruction buffer’ to smooth out latency.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Historian:** Logs record requests, noting shard IDs, record offsets, and access timestamps.
*   **Probabilistic Model (PM):** A machine learning model (e.g., Markov Model, LSTM) trained on data from the Access Pattern Historian. The PM predicts the likelihood of accessing specific shards and records given a sequence of recent requests.
*   **Prefetch Engine:** Monitors incoming requests and consults the PM. Based on predictions, initiates asynchronous prefetching of relevant shard segments. Prefetching prioritizes segments with high predicted probability.
*   **Reconstruction Buffer:** A circular buffer that stores partially reconstructed records. When a shard segment is prefetched, the system attempts to assemble complete records within the buffer.
*   **Record Assembler:** Extracts records from prefetched shard segments and stores them (or portions thereof) in the Reconstruction Buffer. Handles record delimiters to ensure correct assembly.
*   **Request Handler:** Receives retrieval requests. Before accessing storage, checks if the requested record is present in the Reconstruction Buffer. If found, the record is immediately returned. If not, the Request Handler processes the request normally (accessing storage).

**Pseudocode (Request Handling):**

```
function handle_request(request_id, record_offset):
  record = check_reconstruction_buffer(record_offset)
  if record != null:
    return record
  else:
    record = retrieve_from_storage(record_offset)
    prefetch_engine.trigger_prefetch(record_offset) //trigger prefetch of nearby data
    return record
```

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Engine):**

```
function trigger_prefetch(record_offset):
  predicted_shards = probabilistic_model.predict_next_shards(record_offset)
  for shard_id in predicted_shards:
    if shard_id not in prefetched_shards:
      asynchronously fetch shard_id from storage
      upon completion:
        record_assembler.assemble_records(shard_id)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PrefetchedShards`: A set to track which shards have been prefetched.
*   `ReconstructionBufferEntry`: Contains record data and metadata (record offset, shard ID).
*   `ProbabilisticModel`: A trained ML model for predicting shard access.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The size of the Reconstruction Buffer should be configurable to balance memory usage and hit rate.
*   The Probabilistic Model should be retrained periodically to adapt to changing access patterns.
*   Consider using a cache-aware prefetching strategy to minimize storage I/O.
*   This system can be extended to support multi-level prefetching (prefetching prefetched segments).
*   The PM could be trained on access patterns of entire datasets, or on a per-user basis.
*   Error handling for asynchronous prefetching needs to be considered.
