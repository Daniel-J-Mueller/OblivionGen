## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Command Filtering

**Concept:** Expand the idea of identifying a user profile via voice to dynamically create and adjust “acoustic zones” within a space, coupled with personalized command filtering. This goes beyond simply selecting *which* device responds, and aims to tailor the *interpretation* of commands based on location and user profile.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of spatially distributed, low-power microphones (beyond existing voice-enabled devices). Density: 1 microphone per 100 sq ft minimum.
    *   Edge computing module(s) capable of real-time audio processing (speaker recognition, direction-of-arrival estimation, noise reduction).
    *   Existing voice-enabled devices (smart speakers, etc.) act as actuators – executing commands.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:** Continuously builds a real-time map of the acoustic environment. Uses microphone array data to identify sound sources, reflections, and ambient noise. Generates an "acoustic heat map" indicating sound intensity and direction.
    *   **Zone Definition & Management:**
        *   Allows users to define zones (e.g., "Living Room", "Kitchen", "Office") through a UI.
        *   Automatic zone creation based on room geometry and acoustic characteristics (e.g., identifying distinct spaces separated by walls).
        *   Dynamic zone adjustment based on user location (determined via voice triangulation or other positioning methods).
    *   **User Profile Integration:**
        *   Seamless integration with existing user profiles (as per the patent).
        *   Expansion of user profiles to include:
            *   Preferred command syntax (e.g., “Turn on the lights” vs. “Lights on”).
            *   Command prioritization (e.g., user prioritizes music playback over other commands).
            *   Device preferences (e.g., user prefers a specific speaker for music).
    *   **Command Interpretation & Routing:**
        *   Incoming audio is processed to identify the user profile *and* their location.
        *   Based on the user profile and location, the system:
            *   Filters commands – ignoring commands that are irrelevant to the user's context.
            *   Adapts command syntax – interpreting commands according to the user’s preferred style.
            *   Routes the command to the appropriate device *and* configures the device accordingly (e.g., adjusts volume, selects a specific playlist).
    *   **Beacon Integration:** (as in the patent) – Utilizes RFID/Bluetooth beacons for improved user localization within zones.

**Pseudocode (Command Processing):**

```
function processCommand(audioSignal) {
  userProfile = identifyUser(audioSignal);
  location = determineLocation(audioSignal, userProfile);
  zone = identifyZone(location);

  filteredCommand = filterCommand(command, userProfile, zone);

  if (filteredCommand != null) {
    adaptedCommand = adaptCommandSyntax(filteredCommand, userProfile);
    targetDevice = selectTargetDevice(adaptedCommand, zone);
    executeCommand(adaptedCommand, targetDevice);
  }
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   Dynamic Acoustic Zoning – Goes beyond static room definitions.
*   Personalized Command Filtering – Reduces ambiguity and improves accuracy.
*   Adaptive Command Syntax – Tailors voice interaction to individual preferences.
*   Context-Aware Command Routing – Ensures commands are executed on the correct device, with the correct settings.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart Homes – Create a truly personalized and intuitive living experience.
*   Offices – Improve productivity and collaboration.
*   Retail – Enhance customer engagement and create targeted promotions.
*   Accessibility – Assist individuals with disabilities.
