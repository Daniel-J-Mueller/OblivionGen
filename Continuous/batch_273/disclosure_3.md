## Personalized "Content Mood" Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the completion rate analysis to incorporate *emotional* response data derived from viewer biometrics, creating a "content mood" profile. This allows for filtering supplementary content not just by *whether* someone finishes it, but *how they feel* while watching, and presenting content aligned with their current emotional state.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Data Input:**
    *   Integrate with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers) or webcam-based emotion recognition software.
    *   Capture data points: heart rate variability (HRV), facial expressions (micro-expressions), skin conductance (galvanic skin response), pupil dilation.
    *   Data transmission via secure API.

2.  **Emotional State Algorithm:**
    *   Develop machine learning model (RNN/LSTM) trained on labeled biometric data corresponding to core emotional states (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral, engaged, bored).
    *   Real-time analysis of biometric input to determine viewer's current emotional state with confidence score.
    *   Emotional state output: Vector of probabilities for each core emotion (e.g., \[joy: 0.1, sadness: 0.05, anger: 0.02, engaged: 0.7, bored: 0.13]).

3.  **Supplementary Content "Mood Tagging":**
    *   Analyze supplementary content (video clips, ads, articles) using computer vision and natural language processing.
    *   Extract features indicating emotional tone: music, color palette, spoken word sentiment, visual imagery.
    *   Assign each piece of supplementary content a "mood vector" representing its dominant emotional characteristics.

4.  **Filtering & Presentation Logic:**

    ```pseudocode
    function select_supplementary_content(viewer, content_item, biometric_data):
      viewer_emotion = analyze_biometric_data(biometric_data)
      potential_content = get_potential_supplementary_content(content_item)
      filtered_content = []

      for content in potential_content:
        content_mood = get_content_mood(content)
        similarity_score = cosine_similarity(viewer_emotion, content_mood)

        if similarity_score > threshold:
          filtered_content.append(content)

      if filtered_content is empty:
        # Fallback to completion rate-based filtering
        filtered_content = completion_rate_filter(potential_content, viewer)

      return select_best_content(filtered_content)
    ```

5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Implement reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust the similarity threshold based on user feedback (explicit ratings, watch time, biometric responses).
    *   Aim to maximize user engagement and minimize negative emotional responses.

6.  **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   Data anonymization and encryption.
    *   User consent for biometric data collection.
    *   Option to opt-out of biometric analysis.
    *   Data retention policies.

7. **'Emotional Abandonment' Metric:** Track when a user's biometric data indicates a *negative shift* in emotional state during supplementary content viewing, even if they finish it. Use this as a signal for content filtering and improvement.
