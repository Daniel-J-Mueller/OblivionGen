## Vehicle Zone Health & Predictive Maintenance System

**Concept:** Expand the vehicle's internal communication network to incorporate predictive maintenance diagnostics delivered *through* the existing relay system, focusing on zone-level health rather than individual ECU status. This shifts the focus from simply relaying sensor data to actively managing system wellbeing.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Zone Health Score (ZHS):** Each vehicle zone controller calculates a ZHS based on data relayed through it. ZHS incorporates:
    *   Sensor data anomaly detection (deviation from baseline).
    *   Communication latency/loss within the zone.
    *   ECU self-diagnostic reporting.
    *   Power consumption patterns.
2.  **ZHS Relay & Aggregation:** ZHS values are packaged as low-priority messages and relayed through the existing system. A central “Health Management Unit” (HMU) aggregates ZHS from all zones.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** The HMU employs machine learning models trained on historical ZHS data, vehicle usage, and environmental factors. These models predict potential component failures *before* they occur, based on subtle shifts in ZHS.
4.  **Adaptive Relay Priority:** The system dynamically adjusts relay priority based on ZHS. Critical health data (e.g., imminent failure warnings) preempts lower-priority sensor data.  This is achieved through modification of ethernet frame headers.
5.  **HMU Pseudocode:**

```
// HMU Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Receive ZHS messages from all zones
  message = receiveMessage()

  // Update zone health data
  zoneHealthData[message.zoneID] = message.ZHS

  // Run predictive models
  predictedFailures = runPredictiveModels(zoneHealthData)

  // If failures predicted:
  if (predictedFailures != null) {
    // Generate maintenance alerts
    generateAlert(predictedFailures)

    //Adjust relay priority for critical zones
    adjustRelayPriority(predictedFailures)
  }

  // Process regular sensor data
  processSensorData()
}
```

6.  **Relay Agent Modification:** Relay agents are updated to recognize and prioritize ZHS messages, and to report communication statistics for ZHS calculation. Add a function that measures end to end latency of messages to the health management unit.
7.  **Security:** ZHS messages and predictive alerts are digitally signed by the zone controllers and the HMU, respectively, to prevent spoofing. Use a tiered cryptographic key scheme.
8.  **Data Storage:** Historical ZHS data and predictive models are stored in a secure cloud-based repository for ongoing model refinement and fleet-wide analysis.
9.  **Software Updates:** Over-the-air (OTA) updates are used to deploy new predictive models and security patches.
10. **Integration with Existing Systems:** Seamless integration with vehicle diagnostics, infotainment, and telematics systems.
