## Dynamic Graph Partitioning based on Acoustic Event Density

**Concept:** Extend the load balancing approach by dynamically partitioning the speech recognition graph *itself* based on real-time acoustic event density within the audio stream. Instead of simply shifting active nodes between servers, different portions of the graph are assigned to different servers based on which areas are currently "hot" (receiving high probability acoustic matches).

**Specs:**

*   **Acoustic Event Density Map (AEDM):** A real-time map generated from the incoming audio features. This map represents the probability distribution of acoustic events across the feature space.  Higher density regions indicate areas where the audio is more likely to match the model.
*   **Graph Partitioning Algorithm:** An algorithm to dynamically partition the speech recognition graph into subgraphs. The partitioning prioritizes minimizing the communication cost between subgraphs, while maximizing the balance of computational load.  Partitioning should consider the AEDM, assigning portions of the graph with high AEDM values to servers with available resources.
*   **Server Resource Monitoring:**  Each server continuously reports its available resources (CPU, memory, GPU) and current workload.
*   **Partition Migration Protocol:**  A protocol for migrating partitions between servers.  This protocol minimizes disruption to the speech recognition process. It would involve transferring necessary graph data and active node states.
*   **Inter-Server Communication:**  A low-latency communication channel between servers for exchanging graph data, active node states, and partial recognition results.

**Pseudocode (Partitioning Algorithm):**

```
function partitionGraph(graph, AEDM, serverList):
  partitions = []
  serverLoad = [0] * len(serverList) //Initialize server loads

  // Calculate node weights based on AEDM
  nodeWeights = {}
  for node in graph.nodes:
    nodeWeights[node] = AEDM.getValue(node.featureVector)

  // Greedy assignment of nodes to servers
  while graph.nodes:
    bestNode = None
    bestServer = None
    maxWeight = -1

    for node in graph.nodes:
      for i in range(len(serverList)):
        if serverList[i].availableResources() > node.resourceCost():
          weight = nodeWeights[node]
          if weight > maxWeight:
            maxWeight = weight
            bestNode = node
            bestServer = i

    if bestNode is not None:
      partitions.append((bestServer, bestNode))
      serverList[bestServer].assignWorkload(bestNode.resourceCost())
      graph.removeNode(bestNode)
    else:
      //No server available, implement fallback (e.g., queue, reduce precision)
      break

  return partitions
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Predictive Partitioning:** Use machine learning to predict future acoustic event density based on past data.  This allows for proactive graph partitioning, improving response time.
*   **Dynamic Graph Restructuring:**  Instead of fixed graph partitions, allow for dynamic restructuring of the graph based on the current acoustic context. This could involve merging or splitting partitions on the fly.
*   **Hierarchical Partitioning:** Use a hierarchical partitioning scheme, where the graph is divided into multiple levels of partitions. This allows for fine-grained control over load balancing.
*   **Server Specialization:**  Assign different servers to different types of graph processing (e.g., acoustic modeling, language modeling).
*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Extend the system to handle multi-modal input (e.g., speech and vision). This would require partitioning the graph based on both acoustic and visual features.
