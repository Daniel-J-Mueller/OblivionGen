## Dynamic Satellite Constellation Swarming for Enhanced Resilience

**Concept:** Instead of rigidly scheduled handovers between predetermined satellites, implement a dynamic “swarming” behavior where multiple satellites compete to establish and maintain communication links with user terminals. This creates redundancy and resilience against satellite failure or interference.

**Specs:**

*   **User Terminal (UT) Beaconing:** UT continuously broadcasts a signal containing its location, signal strength metrics of current satellite link (if any), and desired service level (bandwidth, latency).
*   **Satellite Listening & Bidding:** All satellites within range listen for UT beacons. Each satellite calculates a "bid score" based on:
    *   Signal path loss (distance, obstacles)
    *   Available bandwidth
    *   Current load
    *   Predicted future position relative to UT (orbital data)
    *   Cost of switching resources (power, processing)
*   **Central Auctioneer (Cloud-Based):** A central system receives bid scores from multiple satellites for each UT. It runs an auction (e.g., Vickrey auction) to select the ‘winning’ satellite. The winning satellite is assigned the communication link.
*   **Dynamic Link Re-evaluation:**  The auction process repeats periodically (e.g., every 5-15 seconds) or triggered by significant events (satellite failure, UT mobility, signal degradation). This ensures optimal link selection based on real-time conditions.
*   **Predictive Swarming:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to *predict* UT movement and proactively adjust satellite bidding strategies.  The system pre-calculates optimal satellite handoff candidates *before* the current link degrades.
*   **Resource Allocation Protocol:** A protocol for allocating and deallocating communication resources on both the satellite and UT sides during link transitions. This minimizes disruption and ensures seamless handover.

**Pseudocode (UT side):**

```
// Initialization
location = getCurrentLocation();
desiredBandwidth = getDesiredBandwidth();

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Broadcast Beacon
    broadcastBeacon(location, signalStrength, desiredBandwidth);

    // Listen for Allocation Grant
    if (allocationGrantReceived) {
        // Establish Communication Link with Winning Satellite
        establishLink(winningSatellite);
        break;
    }

    // Update Location
    location = getCurrentLocation();

    delay(100ms);
}
```

**Pseudocode (Satellite side):**

```
// Initialization
orbitalData = getOrbitalData();

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Listen for UT Beacons
    beacons = listenForBeacons();

    for each beacon in beacons {
        // Calculate Bid Score
        bidScore = calculateBidScore(beacon, orbitalData);

        // Send Bid to Auctioneer
        sendBidToAuctioneer(beacon, bidScore);
    }

    // Receive Allocation Grant from Auctioneer
    if (allocationGrantReceived) {
        // Allocate Communication Resources
        allocateResources(UT);
        break;
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This shifts from a *planned* handover to a *competitive* allocation.  Rather than the network dictating which satellite a UT connects to, the UT dynamically chooses the best connection based on a real-time auction. This inherently builds in redundancy and resilience.
