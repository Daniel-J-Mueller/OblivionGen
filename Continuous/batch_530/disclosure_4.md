## Adaptive Temporal Resolution for Keyword Spotting

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the temporal resolution of feature vector generation based on detected audio characteristics, optimizing for both speed and accuracy in keyword spotting. The system will detect periods of high acoustic change, indicative of potential keyword boundaries or rapid articulation, and increase temporal resolution during those periods. Conversely, during periods of relative acoustic stability, temporal resolution will decrease, reducing computational load.

**Specifications:**

**1. Acoustic Change Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data stream.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Calculate short-time energy (STE) for overlapping windows.
    *   Calculate zero-crossing rate (ZCR) for overlapping windows.
    *   Calculate the spectral flux (rate of change in the magnitude spectrum) for overlapping windows.
    *   Compute a combined change score by weighting STE, ZCR, and spectral flux. Weights are dynamically adjusted using a moving average.
*   **Output:** Time-series of acoustic change scores, indicating periods of high or low acoustic activity.

**2. Temporal Resolution Controller:**

*   **Input:** Acoustic change score time-series.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Define thresholds for "high change" and "low change" acoustic activity.  These thresholds may be initially determined empirically and refined through machine learning.
    *   Implement a state machine with three states:
        *   **High Resolution:**  Feature vectors generated every *N1* milliseconds (e.g., 10ms).
        *   **Medium Resolution:** Feature vectors generated every *N2* milliseconds (e.g., 25ms).
        *   **Low Resolution:** Feature vectors generated every *N3* milliseconds (e.g., 50ms).
    *   State transitions are triggered by the acoustic change score exceeding (or falling below) defined thresholds.  Hysteresis is applied to prevent rapid state switching.
*   **Output:** Control signal indicating the desired temporal resolution for feature vector generation.

**3. Feature Vector Generator:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data, temporal resolution control signal.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Extract acoustic features (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms) from overlapping windows of the audio data.
    *   The window length and hop size are determined by the current temporal resolution setting.
    *   Apply feature scaling and normalization.
*   **Output:** Sequence of feature vectors.

**4. Keyword Spotting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Sequence of feature vectors.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Utilize a keyword spotting model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Deep Neural Network) to detect the presence of the keyword. The model training will need to account for the variable temporal resolutions.
*   **Output:** Keyword detection confidence score.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Resolution Controller):**

```
state = MEDIUM_RESOLUTION
threshold_high = 0.8
threshold_low = 0.2
hysteresis = 0.1

while (audio_stream_active):
  change_score = acoustic_change_detection(audio_stream)

  if (change_score > threshold_high):
    state = HIGH_RESOLUTION
  elif (change_score < threshold_low):
    state = LOW_RESOLUTION
  else:
    # Maintain current state
    pass

  set_feature_vector_resolution(state)

  # Update thresholds based on a moving average of change scores
  threshold_high = threshold_high + hysteresis
  threshold_low = threshold_low - hysteresis
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Computational Load:** Lowering temporal resolution during periods of relative acoustic stability significantly reduces the number of feature vectors that need to be processed.
*   **Improved Accuracy:** Increasing temporal resolution during periods of rapid acoustic change allows for more precise detection of keyword boundaries and articulations.
*   **Adaptive Performance:** The system dynamically adjusts to varying audio characteristics, providing optimal performance in different environments.
*   **Energy Efficiency:** Reduced computational load translates to lower energy consumption, particularly important for battery-powered devices.
