## Temporal Data Sharding with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the commit log/batch update system to incorporate temporal data sharding combined with a predictive pre-fetch mechanism. The system doesn’t just batch update *all* committed data, but shards it across multiple batch-updated data stores (let's call them 'temporal slices') based on a rolling time window. Furthermore, it predicts future query patterns and proactively prefetches relevant slices *before* the query arrives.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on mitigating slow commit log searches by offloading to batch-updated stores. This builds on that concept by acknowledging that *not all* historical data is equally relevant to current queries.  By sharding temporally and prefetching, we drastically reduce search scope and latency. This is applicable to real-time analytics, customer 360 views, and fraud detection scenarios.

**System Specs:**

*   **Temporal Shard Creation:**
    *   Define a rolling time window (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, 1 week – configurable).
    *   Each time window becomes a 'temporal slice'.
    *   Commit log entries are tagged with a timestamp.
    *   A 'Shard Manager' component is responsible for writing entries to the appropriate temporal slice based on the timestamp.
    *   Slices are stored in separate, optimized batch-updated data stores (could be different database technologies tailored to the slice’s data).

*   **Query Interception & Routing:**
    *   All queries pass through a 'Query Router'.
    *   The Query Router analyzes the query to determine the relevant time range.
    *   It routes the query to the appropriate temporal slice(s). If the time range spans multiple slices, the query is parallelized across them.

*   **Predictive Prefetch:**
    *   A 'Query Pattern Analyzer' monitors query history to identify common patterns (e.g., daily reports, weekly analytics).
    *   Based on these patterns, the Query Pattern Analyzer predicts which temporal slices will be needed in the near future.
    *   A 'Prefetcher' component proactively loads these slices into a fast, in-memory cache *before* the corresponding queries arrive.
    *   Cache eviction policies (LRU, LFU) should be configurable.

*   **Data Synchronization:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to synchronize data across temporal slices (e.g., for corrections or updates). This could involve a 'change data capture' (CDC) system.

**Pseudocode (Prefetcher Component):**

```
function prefetch_slices():
  query_patterns = QueryPatternAnalyzer.get_patterns()
  future_time_ranges = calculate_future_ranges(query_patterns)
  required_slices = determine_slices_for_ranges(future_time_ranges)

  for slice in required_slices:
    if slice not in in_memory_cache:
      load_slice_from_storage(slice)
      add_slice_to_cache(slice)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `TemporalSlice`: Object representing a time window and its corresponding data store. Attributes: `start_time`, `end_time`, `data_store_location`.
*   `QueryPattern`: Object representing a recurring query. Attributes: `pattern_id`, `time_range`, `query_string`.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Horizontal scaling of data stores for each temporal slice.
*   Distributed caching layer for pre-fetched slices.
*   Asynchronous data synchronization.

**Novelty:** The combination of temporal sharding, predictive pre-fetching, and the use of specialized data stores for each slice creates a significant performance advantage over traditional batch-update systems. It anticipates query needs, minimizing search latency and improving overall system responsiveness.
