## Modular, Self-Configuring Display Stack with Integrated Haptics

**Concept:** A display assembly composed of stacked, individually addressable micro-LED tiles, bonded to a silicon substrate with integrated haptic feedback emitters directly beneath each tile. The silicon substrate facilitates power and data delivery, alongside control of haptic elements, and incorporates a flexible interconnect scheme to allow reconfiguration of the display's physical shape.

**Specifications:**

*   **Display Tile:**
    *   Micro-LED pitch: 50μm - 100μm (scalable)
    *   Tile Size: 1cm x 1cm (modular, scalable in both dimensions)
    *   Tile Communication: Direct data line to silicon substrate, utilizing a high-speed serial protocol (e.g., MIPI).
    *   Tile Power: Individual power regulation per tile, managed by the silicon substrate.
*   **Silicon Substrate:**
    *   Material: High-purity silicon with embedded routing layers.
    *   Dimensions: Scalable, designed to accommodate a variety of display sizes.
    *   Routing: Dense, multi-layer routing for power and data distribution.
    *   Haptic Integration: Piezoelectric or electrostatic haptic emitters positioned directly beneath each display tile. Emitters are individually addressable.
    *   Interconnect: Flexible polyimide interconnects extending from the silicon substrate to allow for bending/folding of the display stack without fracturing connections.
    *   Edge Connectors: Castellated contacts for connection to external processing/power.
    *   Control IC: Dedicated IC embedded within the substrate for managing haptic feedback, power delivery and data routing.
*   **Adhesive Layer:**
    *   Optically clear, thermally conductive adhesive for bonding display tiles to the silicon substrate. Low-outgassing.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   API for controlling individual display tiles and haptic emitters.
    *   Calibration routines to compensate for variations in tile brightness and haptic response.
    *   Dynamic tiling algorithm to handle display reconfiguration.
    *   Low-level drivers for communication with the control IC.
*   **Haptic Control:**
    *   Variable frequency/amplitude control for each haptic emitter.
    *   Waveform generation for complex tactile effects.
    *   Integration with on-screen visuals for synchronized feedback (e.g., feeling textures, button presses).

**Pseudocode (Display Reconfiguration):**

```
function reconfigure_display(new_shape, tile_map):
  // new_shape: Desired 3D shape of the display
  // tile_map: Mapping of physical tile locations to logical display coordinates

  calculate_tile_positions(new_shape) // Determine physical locations for each tile
  update_tile_map(tile_map, calculated_positions) // Create updated mapping

  for each tile in tile_map:
    // Adjust data routing to new physical location
    route_data(tile.physical_location, tile.logical_location)

    // Adjust power delivery to new physical location
    deliver_power(tile.physical_location)

    // Recalibrate haptic emitter based on new location
    calibrate_haptic_emitter(tile.physical_location)
  end for

  update_display_drivers(tile_map) // Apply updated configuration to display drivers

  return success
end function
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Foldable/rollable displays
*   Adaptive user interfaces (e.g., haptic buttons that change shape)
*   VR/AR headsets with advanced tactile feedback
*   Conformable displays for wearable devices
*   Interactive surfaces for gaming and entertainment.
