## Adaptive Event Contextualization via Multi-Modal Fusion

**Concept:** Extend event extraction beyond textual analysis by incorporating visual and auditory data to enrich event context and disambiguate ambiguous triggers.  The system will dynamically adapt its weighting of modalities based on confidence scores derived from each source.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Pre-processing:**

*   **Textual Input:** Standard text document as per the base patent.
*   **Visual Input:**  Accept image/video streams associated with the document (e.g., security camera footage related to an incident report, images in a news article).  Utilize object detection and scene recognition models (YOLOv8, CLIP) to identify key objects and scenes.
*   **Auditory Input:** Accept audio streams (e.g., 911 calls, meeting recordings). Utilize speech-to-text conversion, emotion recognition, and keyword spotting.
*   **Synchronization:** Implement a time-stamping and synchronization mechanism to align visual, auditory, and textual data streams. This assumes some temporal relationship exists â€“ potentially looser association for historical data.

**2. Multi-Modal Feature Extraction:**

*   **Textual Features:** Utilize the pre-trained encoder from the base patent.
*   **Visual Features:** Extract feature vectors from identified objects and scenes using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs).  Spatial relationships between objects are encoded as graph structures.
*   **Auditory Features:** Extract feature vectors from speech-to-text output, emotion analysis, and identified keywords.

**3. Confidence Scoring & Adaptive Weighting:**

*   **Modality Confidence:**  Each modality (text, visual, auditory) receives a confidence score based on data quality, model certainty, and relevance to the document.
    *   *Text*: Based on language model perplexity, sentence structure analysis.
    *   *Visual*: Based on object detection confidence scores, scene recognition certainty.
    *   *Auditory*: Based on speech-to-text accuracy, keyword spotting confidence, emotion recognition certainty.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Implement an attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of each modality to the overall event representation.  The weights are determined by the modality confidence scores.
    *   `weight_text = confidence_text / (confidence_text + confidence_visual + confidence_auditory)`
    *   `weight_visual = confidence_visual / (confidence_text + confidence_visual + confidence_auditory)`
    *   `weight_auditory = confidence_auditory / (confidence_text + confidence_visual + confidence_auditory)`
*   **Fusion Layer:** A fusion layer combines the weighted feature vectors from each modality into a unified event representation. This could be a simple concatenation or a more complex attention-based mechanism.

**4. Event Extraction & Semantic Role Labeling:**

*   Utilize the machine learning models from the base patent, but now trained on the multi-modal event representations.
*   Semantic role labeling is performed on the fused representation, identifying event triggers, entities, and their relationships.

**5. Output Generation:**

*   Generate an output indicating the event groups, entity groups, and assigned semantic roles, enriched with information from the visual and auditory data.
*   Include confidence scores for each identified event and entity, reflecting the contribution of each modality.
*   Provide visual highlights (bounding boxes, object labels) and audio annotations (timestamps, keywords) to support the output.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def extract_event(document, image_stream, audio_stream):
    # 1. Data Ingestion & Pre-processing
    text_features = encode_text(document)
    visual_features, visual_confidence = process_visual(image_stream)
    auditory_features, auditory_confidence = process_auditory(audio_stream)

    # 2. Calculate Weights
    total_confidence = visual_confidence + auditory_confidence + 1 # Prevent division by zero. Text is assumed to be 'present'.
    weight_text = 1 / total_confidence
    weight_visual = visual_confidence / total_confidence
    weight_auditory = auditory_confidence / total_confidence

    # 3. Fusion
    fused_features = (weight_text * text_features) + (weight_visual * visual_features) + (weight_auditory * auditory_features)

    # 4. Event Extraction
    event_groups, entity_groups, semantic_roles = extract_events_from_features(fused_features)

    # 5. Output
    output = {
        "event_groups": event_groups,
        "entity_groups": entity_groups,
        "semantic_roles": semantic_roles,
        "confidence": calculate_overall_confidence(event_groups, entity_groups, semantic_roles, weight_text, weight_visual, weight_auditory)
    }
    return output
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Populate a knowledge graph with extracted events and entities, leveraging the multi-modal information.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify anomalous events based on deviations from expected patterns.
*   **Real-Time Processing:** Enable real-time event extraction from live video and audio streams.
