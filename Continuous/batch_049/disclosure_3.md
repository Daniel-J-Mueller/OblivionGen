**Dynamic DNS Blackholing with AI-Driven Reputation Scoring**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the described DNS request routing by integrating real-time AI-driven reputation scoring of source IP addresses. Instead of *only* distributing DNS servers across network address zones to mitigate attacks, proactively *blackhole* requests originating from IPs flagged as malicious *before* they reach the authoritative DNS servers.

**II. Components:**

*   **Reputation Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on diverse threat intelligence feeds (abuse databases, botnet trackers, compromised host lists) and real-time traffic analysis.  Features should include: IP age, ASN reputation, geolocation anomalies, historical DNS query patterns (e.g., high query rate, unusual record types), and entropy of DNS query names.  Output: a reputation score (0-100, higher is worse).
*   **Traffic Interceptor:** Positioned *before* the DNS server farm.  Intercepts all incoming DNS requests.
*   **Scoring Module:**  Applies the Reputation Engineâ€™s model to the source IP address of each intercepted request.
*   **Blackhole Module:**  Configurable threshold for the reputation score. If a request's source IP exceeds the threshold:
    *   Drop the request (silent discard).
    *   Redirect to a "sinkhole" DNS server that returns a benign NXDOMAIN response (to avoid disrupting legitimate users while gathering more data on the attacker).
    *   Log the event (source IP, timestamp, reputation score, action taken).
*   **Adaptive Learning Loop:**  Feedback mechanism to refine the Reputation Engine's model.
    *   Monitor DNS server logs for legitimate false positives (IPs incorrectly flagged as malicious).
    *   Manually override blackhole decisions for verified legitimate traffic.
    *   Retrain the model periodically with the updated dataset.

**III.  Pseudocode (Traffic Interceptor):**

```
function process_dns_request(request):
  source_ip = request.source_ip
  reputation_score = ReputationEngine.score(source_ip)

  if reputation_score > BLACKHOLE_THRESHOLD:
    log_event(source_ip, reputation_score, "Blackholed")
    if USE_SINKHOLE:
      response = SinkholeServer.respond(request)
    else:
      // Drop Request
      return null
    return response
  else:
    // Forward Request to DNS Server Farm
    response = DNS_Server_Farm.respond(request)
    return response

```

**IV. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `BLACKHOLE_THRESHOLD`: Integer, adjustable reputation score threshold for blackholing.
*   `USE_SINKHOLE`: Boolean, enables/disables sinkhole redirection.
*   `SINKHOLE_IP`: IP Address of the sinkhole DNS server.
*   `REPUTATION_MODEL_UPDATE_FREQUENCY`: Time interval for retraining the reputation model.
*   `LOGGING_LEVEL`: Verbosity of logging.

**V.  Scalability & Deployment:**

*   Deploy the Traffic Interceptor as a highly available cluster using load balancing.
*   Use a distributed caching layer (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to store reputation scores and reduce latency.
*   Integrate with existing SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems for threat analysis.
