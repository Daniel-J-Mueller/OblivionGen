## Autonomous Device Swarm Acoustic Mapping & Localization

**Concept:** Extend the beamforming and autonomous movement principles to a *swarm* of small, coordinated devices for creating real-time, high-resolution acoustic maps of environments, and simultaneously localizing sound sources within those maps – even those obscured by obstacles.

**Specifications:**

*   **Device Dimensions:** Each device: 5cm x 5cm x 2cm (approximate). Designed for maneuverability in confined spaces.
*   **Locomotion:** Miniature tracked or spherical drive system for all-terrain movement.
*   **Microphone Array:** 8-element circular microphone array, high sensitivity, wide frequency response.
*   **Loudspeaker:** Miniature broadband loudspeaker for calibration and directed acoustic signaling.
*   **Processing Unit:** Low-power ARM Cortex-A72 processor with dedicated DSP co-processor.
*   **Communication:** UWB (Ultra-Wideband) for precise inter-device ranging and communication, WiFi for external data transmission.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable solid-state battery, inductive charging.
*   **Swarm Size:** Configurable, 5-50 devices.

**Mapping & Localization Algorithm:**

1.  **Initial Calibration:** Devices broadcast calibration signals, allowing each device to estimate its relative position to its neighbors using UWB ranging.
2.  **Acoustic Beaconing:** One device acts as a “master” initiating acoustic beaconing. It emits a known signal.
3.  **Beamforming & Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA):** Each device in the swarm utilizes beamforming (similar to the patent, but optimized for short-range, multi-device operation) to determine the direction of arrival of the beacon signal. TDoA calculations estimate the distance to the beacon.
4.  **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM):** A distributed SLAM algorithm merges the TDoA data from all devices to create a 3D acoustic map of the environment. The map represents sound reflection characteristics (intensity, frequency) at various locations.
5.  **Dynamic Source Localization:**  When a new sound source appears, the swarm reconfigures its beamforming patterns to focus on the source.  TDoA combined with the acoustic map allows pinpointing the source’s location, even if it’s hidden behind obstacles (sound waves diffract/reflect, and the swarm utilizes map data to compensate).
6.  **Adaptive Swarm Formation:** The swarm adjusts its formation based on the environment and the target sound source. Devices can cluster around areas of high acoustic activity or spread out to cover a larger area.
7.  **Acoustic “Fingerprinting”:** The swarm generates an “acoustic fingerprint” of the environment, capturing its unique sound reflection patterns. This fingerprint can be used for object recognition or anomaly detection.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Swarm Coordination):**

```
// Device Initialization
init_mic_array()
init_speaker()
init_uwb_communication()
init_SLAM_algorithm()

// Main Loop
while(true) {
  // Receive messages from neighbors (UWB) - position updates, data requests
  receive_messages()

  // Perform Beamforming (Target and Null)
  target_audio = beamform(mic_data, target_direction)
  null_audio = beamform(mic_data, null_direction)

  // Calculate TDoA
  tdoa = calculate_tdoa(target_audio, null_audio)

  // Update SLAM map
  update_map(tdoa, position)

  // Send data to neighbors (UWB) - TDoA, map updates
  send_data()

  // Receive commands from central controller (WiFi) - target direction, swarm formation
  receive_commands()
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Search and Rescue:** Locate trapped individuals in collapsed buildings or disaster areas.
*   **Security:** Detect and localize intruders in complex environments.
*   **Industrial Monitoring:** Identify malfunctioning equipment by analyzing acoustic signatures.
*   **Environmental Monitoring:** Map soundscapes and track noise pollution sources.
*   **Augmented Reality:** Create immersive audio experiences that adapt to the user’s surroundings.
