## Dynamic Security Context Propagation via Intermediate Language Transformation

**Specification:** A system for automatically injecting and propagating security context information throughout compiled code, leveraging intermediate language (IL) transformation *before* final code generation. This expands upon the concept of static security classifications within the source code by enabling runtime-derived security policies to be woven into the code's execution path.

**Core Innovation:** Rather than relying solely on compile-time security classifications, this system monitors and dynamically adjusts security constraints *during* compilation. It allows for policies to be applied and propagated *through* function calls and data flows within the IL, ensuring that all code operates within the correct security boundaries.

**System Components:**

1.  **Security Policy Engine (SPE):**  A runtime component responsible for determining the appropriate security policy based on factors such as user identity, data sensitivity, and environmental conditions. Outputs a security context object (SCO) containing permissions and constraints.
2.  **IL Transformation Module (ITM):** The core component.  Operates on the IL representation of the compiled code. Receives the SCO from the SPE.
3.  **Context Injection Points (CIP):** Designated locations within the IL where security context is injected. These points are strategically positioned at function entry/exit, data access points, and inter-process communication boundaries.
4.  **Runtime Security Monitor (RSM):**  A lightweight runtime component that validates security context during execution, verifying that all operations adhere to the defined policies.

**Operation:**

1.  Source code is compiled into IL.
2.  The ITM intercepts the IL.
3.  The SPE determines the appropriate SCO based on the current execution environment.
4.  The ITM injects the SCO at pre-defined CIPs within the IL, modifying the code's execution path. This includes:
    *   Adding checks to ensure that data access complies with the SCO's permissions.
    *   Modifying function call parameters to include the SCO, allowing functions to inherit the context.
    *   Wrapping critical sections of code with SCO-aware locks.
5.  The modified IL is compiled into machine code.
6.  The RSM monitors the execution of the compiled code, validating that the SCO is properly propagated and that all operations adhere to the defined policies.

**Pseudocode (Illustrative):**

```
// Within ITM, during IL transformation:

function injectSecurityContext(ilCode, securityContext):
  // Locate function entry points
  for each functionEntry in ilCode.functionEntries:
    // Add code to push securityContext onto stack
    ilCode.insertInstruction(functionEntry, "push", securityContext)

  // Locate data access points
  for each dataAccess in ilCode.dataAccessPoints:
    // Add code to check permissions
    ilCode.insertInstruction(dataAccess, "checkPermission", securityContext, dataAccess.resource)

  return ilCode
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Dynamic security context propagation provides a more robust and adaptable security model than static classifications.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** The system enables fine-grained control over security policies, allowing for precise control over data access and execution privileges.
*   **Adaptability:** The system can adapt to changing security requirements and environmental conditions.
*   **Reduced Complexity:** Automation of security policy enforcement simplifies application development and reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities.
