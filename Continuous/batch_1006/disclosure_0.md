## Dynamic Aesthetic Drift & Personalization

**Concept:** Extend the system to actively *shift* aesthetic attributes of recommended items *over time* based on inferred user aesthetic evolution. The current system identifies complementary items; this builds on that to proactively influence and refine user taste.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Aesthetic Trajectory Modeling:**
    *   Introduce a ‘User Aesthetic Profile’ (UAP) stored per user. This profile isn't static; it’s a time-series of aesthetic attribute preferences (e.g., line type, mass, color palettes extracted from images the user interacts with).
    *   Implement a ‘drift rate’ parameter within the UAP. This represents the user’s openness to new aesthetic styles. High drift = faster aesthetic change; low drift = strong preference stability.
    *   UAP updates based on user interactions (likes, purchases, saves) *and* time spent viewing items. Viewing duration is weighted higher for passive aesthetic assimilation.

2.  **Predictive Aesthetic Shift:**
    *   Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a large dataset of user aesthetic evolution patterns. Input: UAP history. Output: Predicted aesthetic attribute shifts for the next time period.
    *   RNN predictions aren't *imposed* on recommendations; they’re used to bias the attribute extraction model.

3.  **Biased Attribute Extraction:**
    *   Modify the attribute extraction model to accept a ‘bias vector’ representing the predicted aesthetic shift.
    *   The bias vector subtly alters attribute scores during item analysis. For example, if the RNN predicts a shift towards ‘curved lines’, the attribute extraction model slightly boosts the ‘curved line’ score for potential recommendations.

4.  **Exploration/Exploitation Balance:**
    *   Introduce an ‘aesthetic exploration rate’ parameter. This controls the extent to which recommendations deviate from the user’s current aesthetic preferences. High rate = more adventurous recommendations; low rate = safer, familiar options.
    *   The aesthetic exploration rate dynamically adjusts based on user engagement. Decreased engagement = decreased exploration; increased engagement = increased exploration.

5.  **System Architecture:**

    ```pseudocode
    function generate_recommendations(user_id):
      user_aesthetic_profile = load_user_profile(user_id)
      predicted_aesthetic_shift = predict_shift(user_aesthetic_profile)
      candidate_items = fetch_items(user_category_preferences)
      for item in candidate_items:
        item_attributes = extract_attributes(item.image)
        biased_attributes = apply_bias(item_attributes, predicted_aesthetic_shift)
        item.score = calculate_compatibility(user_profile, biased_attributes)
      sorted_recommendations = sort_items(recommendations)
      return sorted_recommendations
    ```

6. **Long-Term Aesthetic ‘Seeding’**: The system could also intentionally expose users to subtle aesthetic ‘seeds’ – items with attributes slightly outside their current preferences, but aligned with potential future shifts, to proactively shape taste over time.
