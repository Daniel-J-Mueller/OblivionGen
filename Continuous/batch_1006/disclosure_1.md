## Autonomous Package Sorting Drone Network

**System Overview:** A network of autonomous drones operating within a geographically defined delivery zone (e.g., a city, large campus). These drones collaborate to dynamically sort packages *in-flight* based on destination, leveraging the existing tag/reader system for identification and proximity data.

**Core Innovation:** Moving beyond simply *confirming* package grouping, this system actively *creates* optimal delivery groupings mid-flight, drastically reducing last-mile delivery times and costs.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Delivery Drones:** Small, electrically powered drones equipped with:
    *   Secure package holding mechanism (capable of holding packages of varying sizes).
    *   Short-range radio transceiver (compatible with existing package tags).
    *   GPS and inertial measurement unit (IMU) for precise location tracking.
    *   Collision avoidance system (LiDAR/radar/camera based).
    *   High-bandwidth communication module (for drone-to-drone and drone-to-base station communication).
    *   Onboard processing unit (edge computing capable).
*   **Base Stations:** Strategically positioned throughout the delivery zone. Equipped with:
    *   High-bandwidth communication infrastructure.
    *   Drone charging/maintenance facilities.
    *   Real-time package tracking and routing software.
*   **Existing Package Tags:** Leveraging the existing system for package identification.

**Software Components:**

*   **Dynamic Routing Algorithm:** A distributed algorithm running on both the base stations and drones, responsible for:
    *   Real-time package tracking based on tag data.
    *   Calculating optimal delivery routes based on package destinations and drone availability.
    *   Dynamically assigning packages to drones based on proximity and route efficiency.
    *   Coordinating drone movements to avoid collisions and maintain safe separation.
*   **Package Assignment Protocol (PAP):** This protocol governs how packages are transferred between drones *in-flight*.  Based on tag readings:
    *   Drone A scans the tags of packages on Drone B.
    *   If Drone A determines a package is closer to its route/destination, it requests the package.
    *   Drone B confirms transfer and initiates a secure, automated transfer mechanism (e.g., a robotic arm).
*   **Conflict Resolution System:**  Handles situations where multiple drones attempt to transfer the same package. Utilizes a priority system based on route efficiency and estimated delivery time.

**Pseudocode (Package Assignment Protocol):**

```
Drone A:
  While (in_flight):
    Scan nearby drones for package tags
    For each package tag:
      package_id = tag.package_id
      destination = get_package_destination(package_id)
      distance_to_destination_a = calculate_distance(current_location, destination)
      distance_to_destination_b = calculate_distance(drone_b.current_location, destination)
      If (distance_to_destination_a < distance_to_destination_b):
        request_package_transfer(drone_b, package_id)
        If (transfer_approved):
          initiate_package_transfer()
        Else:
          continue

Drone B:
  While (in_flight):
    Listen for package transfer requests
    If (request_received):
      package_id = request.package_id
      If (package_onboard(package_id)):
        approve_transfer()
        initiate_package_handover()
```

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  Packages are initially loaded onto drones at a central distribution center.
2.  Drones begin their routes, continuously scanning for other drones and package tags.
3.  The PAP algorithm identifies opportunities to optimize delivery routes by transferring packages between drones.
4.  Drones coordinate package transfers mid-flight, seamlessly re-routing packages to their final destinations.
5.  Drones deliver packages directly to customers or designated drop-off locations.
