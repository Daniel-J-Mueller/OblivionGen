## Dynamic Emotional Cue Integration for Video Summarization

**Concept:** Expand beyond object/face detection to incorporate dynamic emotional analysis of subjects within video frames, then weight summarization priority based on detected emotional *change* rather than static presence. The system should actively identify instances of emotional transition to prioritize these moments in the summary, creating a more compelling and narratively driven output.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Video data, audio data.
*   **Components:**
    *   Facial Expression Recognition (FER) engine: Real-time analysis of facial micro-expressions to detect base emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, neutral).  Output: Emotion probability vector per face detected in each frame.
    *   Voice Tone Analysis (VTA) engine:  Analysis of audio data to detect emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral, anxious, etc.). Output: Emotion probability vector for audio segment.
    *   Body Language Analysis (BLA) engine: Uses pose estimation (skeleton tracking) to infer emotional state based on posture, gestures and movement patterns. Output: Emotion probability vector for detected bodies.
*   **Integration:**  Each engine provides an emotion vector. These vectors are then fused using a weighted averaging algorithm (weights tunable per emotion, scenario). Output: Consolidated emotion vector per subject (face/body) in each frame.

**2.  Emotional Change Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Consolidated emotion vectors (from Module 1), timestamped video frame data.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Calculate the "Emotional Delta" (ED) for each subject per frame. ED is defined as the Euclidean distance between the emotion vector of the current frame and the emotion vector of the *previous* frame where the subject was reliably detected.
    *   Smoothing Filter: Apply a moving average filter to the ED time series to reduce noise and highlight significant changes.
    *   Thresholding:  Apply an adaptive threshold to the smoothed ED time series.  A 'spike' above the threshold indicates a significant emotional transition.
*   **Output:**  Timestamped list of 'Emotional Transition Events' (ETE), each containing: Subject ID, Start Frame, End Frame, Emotion Before, Emotion After.

**3.  Summarization Priority Weighting:**

*   **Input:** Video data, ETE list (from Module 2), existing object/face priority metrics (from original patent).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Establish a base priority score for each frame based on existing object/face detection metrics.
    *   Apply an "Emotional Amplification Factor" (EAF) to frames containing ETEs. EAF is calculated based on:
        *   Magnitude of emotional change (difference between Emotion Before and Emotion After).
        *   The ‘importance’ of the emotion (e.g., a shift to anger might have a higher weight than a shift to mild surprise).
        *   The duration of the emotional transition.
    *   The final priority score is calculated as:  `Priority = Base Priority + (EAF * Weighting Factor)` where Weighting Factor is a tunable parameter to control the relative influence of emotional data.
*   **Output:**  Timestamped, weighted list of video frames sorted by priority.

**4.  Summary Generation:**

*   Input: Weighted frame list.
*   Algorithm: Select top N frames based on priority to create a condensed video summary. Include transitional frames to ensure narrative coherence.
*   Output: Condensed video summary.



**Pseudocode for Emotional Delta Calculation:**

```
function CalculateEmotionalDelta(current_emotion_vector, previous_emotion_vector):
  if previous_emotion_vector is NULL:
    return 0 // No previous data
  delta = EuclideanDistance(current_emotion_vector, previous_emotion_vector)
  return delta
```
