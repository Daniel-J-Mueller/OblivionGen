**Adaptive Dependency Shifting & Predictive Failover Zones**

**Concept:** Expand upon the failover workflow concept by not just reacting to cell state, but *predicting* potential failures and proactively shifting dependencies *before* a full failover is required. Introduce the concept of “Predictive Failover Zones” – regions identified as statistically likely to experience disruptions based on historical data, geographical factors, or external threat intelligence.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** System ingests real-time telemetry data from each cell (CPU load, memory usage, network latency, error rates, etc.). Also ingests external data: weather patterns, geopolitical events, known network outages.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Employ time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict potential disruptions in each zone. Assign a "Risk Score" to each zone.
*   **Dynamic Dependency Weights:**  Instead of binary (active/standby) dependency, assign *weights* to dependencies.  A higher weight means more traffic/requests are routed through that cell.
*   **Proactive Dependency Shifting:** Based on Risk Scores and Dependency Weights:
    *   If a zone’s Risk Score exceeds a threshold, *gradually* decrease the Dependency Weight for that zone.
    *   Simultaneously increase Dependency Weights for lower-risk zones.
    *   This shifting should happen *before* any actual failure occurs, distributing load proactively.
*   **Workflow Integration:**  Integrate this proactive shifting into the existing failover workflow. The workflow should:
    *   Monitor Risk Scores continuously.
    *   Trigger Dependency Weight adjustments based on configurable thresholds.
    *   If a zone *does* fail, the existing failover process is still triggered, but the impact is minimized due to the pre-shifted load.
*   **Automated Learning:** The system continuously learns from past events. If a predicted failure *doesn't* happen, the prediction model is adjusted to reduce false positives. If a failure *does* happen despite the mitigation, the model learns to improve future predictions.

**Pseudocode (Dependency Weight Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_dependency_weights(zone, current_weight, risk_score, adjustment_rate):
  if risk_score > HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD:
    new_weight = current_weight - adjustment_rate
    if new_weight < MINIMUM_WEIGHT:
      new_weight = MINIMUM_WEIGHT
  elif risk_score < LOW_RISK_THRESHOLD:
    new_weight = current_weight + adjustment_rate
    if new_weight > MAXIMUM_WEIGHT:
      new_weight = MAXIMUM_WEIGHT
  else:
    new_weight = current_weight  // No adjustment

  return new_weight
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ZoneData`: {`zone_id`, `risk_score`, `dependency_weight`, `telemetry_data`}
*   `DependencyMap`: {`application_id`, `cell_id`, `zone_id`, `dependency_weight`}

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   Requires robust telemetry collection infrastructure.
*   Needs careful tuning of thresholds and adjustment rates to avoid unnecessary traffic shifts.
*   The learning component needs sufficient historical data to be effective.
