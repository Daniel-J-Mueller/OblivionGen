## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Distributed Micro-Robotic Swarms

**Concept:** Expand the directional audio capture beyond a single device, utilizing a swarm of tiny, wirelessly networked robots equipped with microphones and limited mobility to create a dynamically adjustable, distributed microphone array. This enables far more accurate acoustic scene reconstruction and source localization, especially in complex or dynamic environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Robotic Unit (Singular):**
    *   **Dimensions:** 15mm diameter, 8mm height.
    *   **Locomotion:** Miniature piezo-electric actuators for limited, short-range movement (sliding/vibrating). No wheels or legs. Surface dependent.
    *   **Microphone:** MEMS microphone with frequency response 20Hz-20kHz.
    *   **Processing:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller.
    *   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh networking.
    *   **Power:** Rechargeable solid-state battery (approx. 30-minute runtime per charge). Wireless charging capability (inductive).
    *   **Material:** Lightweight polymer composite.
    *   **Sensors:** Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for orientation and movement tracking.
*   **Swarm Size:** 20-100 units. Scalable based on environment size and reconstruction detail.
*   **Base Station:** Connects to a host device (computer, smartphone) via USB or Wi-Fi. Handles swarm coordination, data aggregation, and processing.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Swarm Coordination Algorithm:** Decentralized, bio-inspired algorithm (e.g., particle swarm optimization) for dynamic array configuration. Robots adjust position based on signal strength and acoustic environment mapping.
    *   **Beamforming & Sound Source Localization:** Advanced beamforming algorithms adapted for non-uniform array geometries. Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and/or Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Mapping:** Algorithm to generate a 3D acoustic map of the environment, visualizing sound sources and their intensities.
    *   **Data Fusion:** Combines microphone data from all robotic units, filtering noise and enhancing signal clarity.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  Robotic units are deployed within the target environment.
    2.  Base station initiates swarm coordination.
    3.  Robots self-organize into an optimized array configuration, maximizing coverage and signal capture.
    4.  Base station receives and processes audio data from all robots.
    5.  Software generates a 3D acoustic scene map and localized sound sources.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Coordination):**

```
// Each robot executes this code

function coordinate_swarm():
  while True:
    // Measure signal strength from a central audio source (if known)
    signal_strength = measure_signal()

    // Estimate location of other robots (using BLE beaconing and triangulation)
    nearby_robots = detect_nearby_robots()

    // Calculate a "desirability score" based on:
    // 1. Signal strength
    // 2. Distance from other robots (avoid clustering)
    // 3. Coverage of the target area
    desirability_score = calculate_desirability(signal_strength, nearby_robots)

    // Move slightly in the direction of increasing desirability
    move(desirability_gradient())

    // Update location and broadcast to nearby robots
    broadcast_location()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Environmental sound monitoring.
*   Acoustic surveillance.
*   Enhanced audio recording for virtual/augmented reality.
*   Real-time source separation and noise cancellation.
*   Robotics and AI applications (sound-based navigation, object recognition).
