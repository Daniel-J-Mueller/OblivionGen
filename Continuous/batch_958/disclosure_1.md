## Adaptive Content Segmentation with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the proxy server's content separation capability by dynamically segmenting network content *within* a single request, identifying critical vs. non-critical elements, and applying differentiated security/trust policies.  Combine this with a predictive prefetching system to anticipate user needs and streamline delivery.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Segmentation Engine:** Integrated into the proxy server. Analyzes HTTP responses (and potentially WebSocket streams) to identify distinct content blocks (images, scripts, CSS, data chunks).  Utilizes a combination of:
    *   **Heuristic Analysis:** Based on file extensions, Content-Type headers, and common web development patterns.
    *   **Machine Learning Model:** Trained to identify semantic content blocks – e.g., core page content vs. advertisement blocks. The model’s training data will include labeled web pages and user interaction patterns.
*   **Trust Level Assignment:** Each content segment receives a trust level based on:
    *   **Source Domain/Subdomain:** Matches proxy configuration rules for secured/unsecured portions.
    *   **Content Type:**  Scripts and executable code receive higher scrutiny. Static assets (images, CSS) may receive lower scrutiny, depending on configuration.
    *   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Content triggering unexpected browser behavior (popups, redirects) receives a low trust level.
*   **Differentiated Routing:**  Based on trust level:
    *   **High Trust:** Routed through the secured network path (behind the firewall), subject to organization security supervision.
    *   **Low Trust:**  Routed through the untrusted network path, managed by the customer.
    *   **Mixed Content Handling:** The system flags mixed content scenarios (e.g., secure page loading untrusted scripts).  Options: block untrusted content, prompt the user, or transparently downgrade the entire page to an untrusted connection.
*   **Predictive Prefetching:**  Based on user browsing history and AI-driven predictions:
    *   **Content Anticipation:**  The system anticipates likely subsequent requests (e.g., images on the next page, data for a specific feature).
    *   **Prefetching Strategy:** Based on content trust level. High-trust content is prefetched across the secure path. Low-trust content is prefetched across the untrusted path.
    *   **Adaptive Prefetching:** The prefetching algorithm dynamically adjusts based on network conditions, user behavior, and resource availability.
*   **Caching Layer:**  A multi-tiered caching system optimized for segmented content.
    *   **Tier 1: In-Memory Cache:** Stores frequently accessed, low-latency segments.
    *   **Tier 2: SSD Cache:**  Stores larger, less frequently accessed segments.
    *   **Tier 3: Disk Cache:** Stores archival content.

**Pseudocode (Content Segmentation Engine):**

```
function segmentContent(response):
  segments = []
  contentType = response.contentType
  url = response.url
  
  if contentType == "text/html":
    dom = parseHTML(response.body)
    
    for element in dom.querySelectorAll("*"):
      if element.hasAttribute("src") or element.hasAttribute("href"):
        segment = {
          "url": resolveURL(element.getAttribute("src") or element.getAttribute("href")),
          "contentType": detectContentType(segment.url),
          "data": fetchContent(segment.url)
        }
        segments.append(segment)
  else:
    segments.append({"url": url, "contentType": contentType, "data": response.body})
    
  return segments

function detectContentType(url):
  // Use MIME type detection library
  return mimeType
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security: Granular control over content trust levels.
*   Improved performance: Predictive prefetching and optimized caching.
*   Reduced bandwidth costs: Efficient delivery of content.
*   Flexibility: Adaptable to evolving web technologies and security threats.
