## Dynamic Subgraph Merging with Predictive Cache Prefetching

**Specification:** A system for dynamically merging and splitting neural network subgraphs at runtime based on observed execution patterns and predictive cache prefetching.

**Core Concept:** The initial patent focuses on static allocation. This builds on that by introducing runtime adaptability, focusing on merging frequently co-executed subgraphs to reduce inter-processing unit communication overhead *and* prefetching weights based on predicted execution paths.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Inference Accelerator with multiple Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and on-board caches (as in the base patent).
*   A dedicated “Subgraph Manager” unit – a small, specialized processor core running alongside the TPUs.  This handles subgraph merging/splitting and prefetching.
*   Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) integrated with each TPU, tracking execution times, data access patterns, and inter-TPU communication.
*   Fast, low-latency inter-TPU communication fabric.

**Software Components:**

*   **Neural Network Compiler Enhancement:** The existing compiler is modified to generate a dependency graph representing the entire neural network, but *not* a fixed partitioning. It produces a set of potentially executable subgraphs, with annotations indicating dependency relationships.
*   **Subgraph Manager Runtime:** The core of the dynamic system. It monitors TPU performance using PMU data, identifies frequently co-executed subgraphs, and dynamically merges them into larger subgraphs.
*   **Predictive Cache Prefetcher:** Uses a lightweight recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical execution data to predict the next subgraph to be executed.  This prediction is used to prefetch weights into the caches of the relevant TPUs *before* they are needed.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning Algorithm:** Algorithm to decide when to merge/split subgraphs. It considers the following metrics:
    *   Communication Overhead: Cost of transferring data between TPUs.
    *   Cache Hit Rate: Efficiency of utilizing on-board caches.
    *   TPU Utilization: Load balancing across TPUs.
    *   Merge/Split Cost: Time required to re-partition the network.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Compilation:** The neural network compiler generates a dependency graph and a set of potential subgraphs.  It distributes a minimal set of subgraphs to the TPUs based on initial load balancing.
2.  **Runtime Monitoring:** The PMUs continuously monitor TPU performance and data access patterns.
3.  **Subgraph Analysis:** The Subgraph Manager analyzes PMU data to identify frequently co-executed subgraphs.  It uses the Dynamic Partitioning Algorithm to determine if merging these subgraphs would reduce communication overhead and improve cache hit rates.
4.  **Dynamic Merging/Splitting:** If a merge is beneficial, the Subgraph Manager re-partitions the network, combining the relevant subgraphs and distributing the merged subgraph to the appropriate TPUs.  Conversely, if a large subgraph creates a bottleneck, it can be split into smaller subgraphs.
5.  **Predictive Prefetching:** The Predictive Cache Prefetcher uses the RNN to predict the next subgraph to be executed. It instructs the system to prefetch the weights for that subgraph into the caches of the relevant TPUs.
6.  **Continuous Optimization:** Steps 3-5 are repeated continuously, allowing the system to adapt to changing workloads and optimize performance in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Subgraph Manager Runtime - Simplified):**

```
function monitor_execution():
  for each TPU in TPUs:
    data = TPU.read_PMU_data()
    store_execution_history(data)

function analyze_subgraphs():
  execution_history = retrieve_execution_history()
  co_executed_subgraphs = find_frequent_co_executions(execution_history)
  for subgraph1, subgraph2 in co_executed_subgraphs:
    merge_cost = calculate_merge_cost(subgraph1, subgraph2)
    communication_reduction = calculate_communication_reduction(subgraph1, subgraph2)
    if communication_reduction > merge_cost:
      merge_subgraphs(subgraph1, subgraph2)

function predict_next_subgraph():
  input_data = current_execution_state()
  predicted_subgraph = RNN.predict(input_data)
  prefetch_weights(predicted_subgraph)

loop:
  monitor_execution()
  analyze_subgraphs()
  predict_next_subgraph()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced inter-TPU communication overhead.
*   Improved cache hit rates.
*   Enhanced load balancing.
*   Adaptability to dynamic workloads.
*   Increased overall inference performance.
