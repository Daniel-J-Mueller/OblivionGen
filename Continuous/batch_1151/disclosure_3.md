## Modular Accessory Ecosystem with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Expand the accessory attachment mechanism beyond simple physical connection to create a modular, interactive ecosystem. Leverage the potential for electrical conductivity described in the patent to integrate haptic feedback and data transfer into accessory connections.

**Specs:**

**1. Accessory Mount Core:**

*   **Dimensions:** Scalable, standardized base module (e.g., 50mm x 20mm x 5mm) with multiple connection points.
*   **Material:** Durable, lightweight polymer composite.
*   **Connection Interface:** Retain the hook-and-slot engagement as described in the provided patent but augment with a multi-pin conductive connector integrated into each hook. Minimum of 5 pins: Ground, Power (3.3V/5V selectable), Data (I2C/SPI), Haptic Control 1, Haptic Control 2.
*   **Mounting:** Standardized mounting points on the base for integrating various accessory modules.

**2. Accessory Modules (Examples):**

*   **Haptic Grip:** Module containing miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motors. Connected to the Haptic Control pins on the mount. Allows for customizable vibration patterns to indicate notifications, provide game feedback, or enhance user experience.  Software control via connected device.
*   **Mini Display Module:** Small OLED or micro-LED display module. Connected via I2C/SPI for data transfer.  Displays customizable information (battery level, notifications, context-sensitive data).
*   **Environmental Sensor Module:** Contains temperature, humidity, and ambient light sensors. Transmits data via I2C/SPI. Can be used for contextual awareness or environmental monitoring.
*   **Button/Control Module:** Contains programmable buttons or a small joystick/trackpad. Transmits input data via I2C/SPI.  Offers customizable control options for connected devices.
*   **Wireless Charging Module:** Receives power wirelessly and provides power to the attached electronic device.

**3. Electronic Device Integration:**

*   **Software API:** Develop a software API (SDK) allowing developers to access data from accessory modules and control haptic feedback.
*   **Power Management:** Implement a power management system to efficiently distribute power between the electronic device, accessory mount, and attached modules.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Define a standardized communication protocol (e.g., USB-PD with custom accessory profile) for data transfer and device recognition.

**4. Implementation Pseudocode (Example - Haptic Feedback Control):**

```
// Electronic Device Code

function handleNotification(notificationType) {
  if (accessoryMount.isConnected()) {
    // Select haptic pattern based on notification type
    hapticPattern = getHapticPattern(notificationType);

    // Send haptic command to accessory mount
    accessoryMount.playHapticPattern(hapticPattern);
  }
}

function getHapticPattern(notificationType) {
  switch (notificationType) {
    case "email":
      return [0, 50, 50, 0]; // Short, double tap
    case "sms":
      return [0, 100, 50, 100]; // Longer tap with pause
    case "call":
      return [0, 200, 200, 0]; // Sustained vibration
    default:
      return [0, 50, 0]; // Default single tap
  }
}
```

**5. System Architecture:**

*   Electronic Device <-> USB-C/PD Port <-> Accessory Mount (Hook/Slot + Conductive Pins) <-> Accessory Module(s)
*   Accessory Modules communicate with Accessory Mount via I2C/SPI.
*   Accessory Mount communicates with Electronic Device via USB-PD data lines.
*   Electronic Device software manages data transfer and accessory control.
