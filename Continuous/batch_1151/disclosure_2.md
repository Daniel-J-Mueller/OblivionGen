## Dynamic Haptic Input Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the input identification system to include haptic feedback and dynamically map source device actions to specific haptic outputs on the sink device. This moves beyond simple identification and allows for a more intuitive and immersive user experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Sink Device: Equipped with an array of localized haptic actuators (vibration motors, piezoelectric elements, etc.) covering the primary interaction surface (screen, remote, console controller).  Actuator density: Minimum 20 actuators/100cm².
    *   Source Device:  Contains a miniature directional microphone array capable of localized sound source detection (accuracy within 5 degrees).  Alternatively, a low-power radar/LiDAR module for gesture/position tracking.
    *   Communication: Low-latency wireless communication channel (e.g., Wi-Fi 6, UWB) between source and sink.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initial Mapping Phase:**
        *   Source device initiates a "Haptic Probe" sequence.
        *   Sink device cycles through individual haptic actuators, briefly activating each one.
        *   Source device’s microphone array/radar/LiDAR tracks the direction of the activated haptic output.
        *   A ‘haptic map’ is generated, associating each actuator's physical location with its identifier.
    2.  **Dynamic Action Mapping:**
        *   When a user interacts with the source device (e.g., swipes on a touchscreen, presses a button), the source device sends both command data *and* a "haptic trigger" signal to the sink.
        *   The sink device analyzes the command data to determine the appropriate action.
        *   Based on the *location* of the user’s interaction on the source device (detected via touchscreen coordinates, button position, or gesture tracking) and the generated haptic map, the sink device activates the corresponding actuator(s) to provide localized haptic feedback.
    3.  **Adaptive Learning:**
        *   The system continuously monitors user interaction and adjusts the haptic mapping over time.
        *   If a user consistently overrides the automatically assigned haptic feedback, the system learns the preferred mapping.
        *   This learning process may employ a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to optimize the haptic experience.
    4.  **Calibration Routine:**
        *   A guided calibration sequence allows the user to fine-tune the haptic mapping.
        *   This may involve tracing patterns on the source device and associating them with specific haptic outputs on the sink.

*   **Pseudocode (Sink Device - Receiving & Processing):**

```
function process_input(command_data, haptic_trigger) {
  if (haptic_trigger == TRUE) {
    haptic_location = determine_haptic_location(command_data); //Algorithm based on command
    activate_haptic_actuator(haptic_location);
  }
  execute_command(command_data); //Normal command execution
}

function determine_haptic_location(command_data) {
  //Based on the command_data, determine which actuator to activate
  //Example: If command_data indicates a swipe from left to right, activate actuators
  //along the right edge of the screen.
  //Use the haptic_map to translate location to actuator ID
  return actuator_ID;
}

function activate_haptic_actuator(actuator_ID) {
  //Activate the specified actuator for a predefined duration/intensity
  //Utilize PWM or similar control method for precise control
}
```

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   Gaming: Feeling impacts, textures, and environmental effects localized to specific areas of the screen.
    *   Navigation:  Haptic cues guiding the user along a route.
    *   Accessibility: Providing tactile feedback for visually impaired users.
    *   Remote Control:  Feeling the selection of icons on a TV screen through the remote itself.
