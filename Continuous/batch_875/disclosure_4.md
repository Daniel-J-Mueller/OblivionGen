## Dynamic Contextual Layering for In-Store Navigation & Recommendation

**Concept:** Expand the list ordering model to incorporate real-time contextual data beyond just item check-off timestamps. Create a layered system where recommendations aren't just based on *what* people buy together, but *when*, *where* in the store, *how* they’re interacting with displays, and even *predicted intent* based on dwell time.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Layer:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from:
    *   Mobile device location (Bluetooth beacons, WiFi triangulation, UWB). Precision to within 30cm.
    *   In-store cameras (Computer vision – dwell time analysis, facial expression analysis (sentiment – limited and anonymized), item interaction detection).
    *   RFID/NFC tags on displays/products.
    *   Point-of-Sale (POS) data (real-time sales, purchase history).
*   **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Anonymization and aggregation of all sensor data to protect user privacy.
    *   Timestamp synchronization across all sensors.
    *   Normalization of data to a common scale.

**2. Contextual Feature Engineering:**

*   **Spatial Context:**
    *   *Zone Identification*: Divide store into zones (e.g., “Dairy,” “Produce,” “Snacks”).
    *   *Proximity*: Calculate distance to items, displays, and other users.
    *   *Path Analysis*: Track user movement patterns within the store.
*   **Temporal Context:**
    *   *Time of Day*: Capture shopping behavior based on time.
    *   *Day of Week*: Identify weekly trends.
    *   *Seasonal Effects*: Account for seasonal shopping patterns.
*   **Behavioral Context:**
    *   *Dwell Time*: Measure time spent near items/displays.
    *   *Gaze Tracking*: (Camera-based) Estimate what users are looking at.
    *   *Item Interaction*: Detect if a user picks up, examines, or replaces an item.
    *   *Emotional State*: (Camera-based – sentiment analysis) Estimate user’s emotional state. (Highly limited and anonymized)

**3. Layered List Ordering Model:**

*   **Base Layer:**  Existing list ordering model (Markov Chain or HMM) using historical item check-off timestamps.
*   **Contextual Layers:** Multiple layers, each representing a different context (Spatial, Temporal, Behavioral).  Each layer is a separate list ordering model trained on data specific to that context.
*   **Weighting Mechanism:**  A dynamic weighting algorithm that adjusts the influence of each layer based on the current context. (e.g., Spatial layer heavily weighted when a user is in the “Baking” aisle).
*   **Model Fusion:**  Combine the outputs of all layers using a weighted averaging or ensemble learning technique.

**4. Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Real-time Recommendation:** Generate recommendations based on the fused model output.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update the recommendations based on user interactions and changes in context.
*   **Personalization:**  Incorporate user purchase history and preferences into the recommendation engine.
*   **Multi-Modal Output:** Deliver recommendations via:
    *   Mobile App (Push Notifications, In-App Messages).
    *   In-Store Digital Displays.
    *   Augmented Reality (AR) overlays on mobile devices.

**Pseudocode (Weighting Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_layer_weights(current_context):
  // current_context contains:
  //   - location (store zone)
  //   - time_of_day
  //   - user_behavior (dwell time, item interaction)

  spatial_weight =  function(location) // higher weight in relevant zones
  temporal_weight = function(time_of_day) // peak hour weighting
  behavioral_weight = function(dwell_time, item_interaction) // dwell time + item interaction

  total_weight = spatial_weight + temporal_weight + behavioral_weight

  spatial_weight_normalized = spatial_weight / total_weight
  temporal_weight_normalized = temporal_weight / total_weight
  behavioral_weight_normalized = behavioral_weight / total_weight

  return [spatial_weight_normalized, temporal_weight_normalized, behavioral_weight_normalized]
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Edge computing devices within the store to process sensor data in real-time.
*   High-bandwidth wireless network connectivity.
*   Computer vision cameras with sufficient resolution and frame rate.
*   Bluetooth beacons/UWB transceivers for accurate indoor positioning.
