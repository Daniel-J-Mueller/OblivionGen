## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Adaptive Authentication

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic authentication scheme to incorporate real-time trust scoring based on behavioral biometrics and environmental factors. This allows for a tiered authentication approach, reducing friction for trusted users while increasing security for potentially compromised accounts.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Component:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Behavioral Biometrics:** Keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, scrolling speed, touch pressure (if applicable).
    *   **Environmental Factors:** IP address geolocation, device type, browser fingerprint, time of day, network characteristics (e.g., cellular vs. WiFi).
    *   **Historical Data:**  Previous successful/failed authentication attempts, transaction history, user profile information.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** A weighted scoring algorithm (e.g., using a Bayesian network or machine learning model) to combine data from the sources above. Weights dynamically adjusted based on observed patterns and anomalies.
*   **Trust Levels:**  Defined trust levels (e.g., Low, Medium, High) based on the calculated trust score.  Levels re-evaluated continuously.

**2. Adaptive Authentication Flow:**

*   **Initial Assessment:** Upon service request, calculate the userâ€™s current trust score.
*   **Tiered Authentication:**
    *   **High Trust:** No further authentication required. Service granted. (Minimal friction).
    *   **Medium Trust:**  Step-up authentication required:
        *   Push notification to registered device for approval.
        *   Low-friction biometric scan (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition).
        *   Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP).
    *   **Low Trust:** Strong authentication required:
        *   Multi-factor authentication (MFA) involving a combination of TOTP, SMS verification, and potentially knowledge-based questions.
        *   Real-time fraud analysis based on transaction details.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  The authentication tier is dynamically adjusted based on the current trust score and any detected anomalies.
*   **Behavioral Learning:** The system learns from user behavior to refine the trust score and authentication tiers over time.

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Client-Side Data Collection:**  JavaScript SDK embedded within client applications to collect behavioral biometrics and environmental factors. Privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., data anonymization, differential privacy) employed.
*   **Server-Side Processing:** Dedicated server component responsible for calculating trust scores, managing authentication tiers, and handling authentication requests.
*   **API Integration:** RESTful API for integrating with existing applications and services.
*   **Data Storage:** Secure database for storing trust scores, user profiles, and authentication history.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function processServiceRequest(request, user):
  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(user, request)

  if trustScore > HIGH_TRUST_THRESHOLD:
    grantAccess(request)
    return

  if trustScore > MEDIUM_TRUST_THRESHOLD:
    performMediumTierAuthentication(request, user)
    if authenticationSuccessful:
      grantAccess(request)
    else:
      requestDenied()
  else:
    performStrongTierAuthentication(request, user)
    if authenticationSuccessful:
      grantAccess(request)
    else:
      requestDenied()
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simply *adapting* to a new authentication scheme, and *proactively* assessing user trustworthiness in real-time. This shifts the focus from verifying identity to continuously evaluating risk, leading to a more seamless and secure user experience.
