## Adaptive Pre-Fetch Based on Predicted Abandonment Probability

**Concept:** Enhance user experience by proactively pre-fetching subsequent multimedia segments *not* based on continuous playback, but on a dynamically calculated abandonment probability. This system anticipates likely stream termination points and pre-loads content accordingly, minimizing buffering *during* abandonment rather than attempting uninterrupted playback.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Abandonment Probability Engine (APE):**
    *   **Input:** Real-time stream metrics (bitrate, latency, packet loss, buffering events), user behavior data (historical abandonment rates, content preferences, device type, time of day), and abandonment metadata from the existing system (location, content type, encoding format).
    *   **Process:** APE utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical abandonment data. The LSTM learns temporal dependencies in the input data to predict the probability of abandonment within a sliding window (e.g., the next 5-10 seconds). Feature importance analysis highlights key drivers of abandonment.
    *   **Output:** A continuous abandonment probability score (0.0 - 1.0) for each stream.

*   **Module 2: Prefetch Controller (PC):**
    *   **Input:** Abandonment probability score from APE, current segment index, segment duration, available bandwidth, and a 'prefetch horizon' parameter (configurable – e.g., prefetch up to 3 segments ahead).
    *   **Process:**
        1.  **Thresholding:** PC applies a configurable abandonment probability threshold. If the probability exceeds the threshold, prefetching is triggered.
        2.  **Segment Selection:** PC identifies the next N segments (based on the prefetch horizon).
        3.  **Bandwidth Allocation:** PC dynamically allocates bandwidth for prefetching, prioritizing streams with higher abandonment probabilities and available bandwidth. Utilizes a weighted fair queuing algorithm.
        4.  **Prefetch Request:** PC issues requests for the selected segments to the content delivery network (CDN).
    *   **Output:** Prefetch requests.

*   **Module 3: Adaptive Bitrate Selection (ABS):**
    *   **Input:** Predicted abandonment probability, current bitrate, available bandwidth, and content characteristics.
    *   **Process:** If the abandonment probability is high, ABS proactively *reduces* the bitrate of pre-fetched segments. This minimizes the amount of data transferred and further reduces buffering risk during abandonment, prioritizing a smoother stop over continued playback.  The bitrate reduction is based on a configurable scale.
    *   **Output:** Bitrate selection for pre-fetched segments.

*   **Integration:**
    *   Integrate APE, PC, and ABS into the existing media player and CDN infrastructure.
    *   Implement a feedback loop: Monitor actual abandonment events and use this data to retrain the LSTM model in APE, improving prediction accuracy.
    *   Provide a dashboard for monitoring abandonment rates, prefetch performance, and system health.

**Pseudocode (PC Module):**

```
function control_prefetch(abandonment_probability, current_segment_index, segment_duration, available_bandwidth, prefetch_horizon):
  if abandonment_probability > abandonment_threshold:
    next_segments = get_next_segments(current_segment_index, prefetch_horizon)
    for segment in next_segments:
      target_bitrate = determine_target_bitrate(segment, available_bandwidth, abandonment_probability)
      prefetch_segment(segment, target_bitrate)
  else:
    //Continue standard playback/prefetch behavior
    pass
