## Adaptive Notification 'Bubbles' - Spatial Audio & Visual Convergence

**Concept:** Extend the contextual notification system to incorporate spatial positioning *and* a dynamic visual “bubble” system layered onto the user’s environment (using AR/VR capable devices, or even projecting onto surfaces). Notifications aren't just *delivered* to devices, they *manifest* in the user's physical space, anchored to the source or subject of the notification.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:** AR/VR headset/glasses *or* wide-angle projection system capable of mapping surfaces, microphone array for spatial audio, access to device location services. Base system must include access to the existing contextual awareness system (patent 8823507)
*   **Software Components:**
    *   *Spatial Notification Manager:* Core component responsible for processing notifications and translating them into spatial audio/visual cues. Interfaces with the contextual awareness system.
    *   *Environment Mapping Module:* Utilizes camera feeds/depth sensors to create a dynamic 3D map of the user’s environment.  This map is continuously updated to account for movement and changes.
    *   *Audio Spatializer:*  Renders audio cues in 3D space, positioning them relative to the notification's source/subject within the environment map.
    *   *Visual Bubble Renderer:* Creates and manages visual "bubbles" (holographic projections, or surface projections) that represent notifications.  Bubble size, color, and animation are determined by notification priority and type.
    *   *Contextual Prioritization Engine:*  Adjusts notification behavior based on user activity, location, and environmental factors.

**Operation:**

1.  **Notification Received:** The Spatial Notification Manager receives a notification (email, calendar event, social media update, etc.).
2.  **Contextual Analysis:** The manager queries the contextual awareness system (from the base patent) for information about the user and their devices.
3.  **Spatial Mapping & Source Determination:** Based on the notification content, the system determines the relevant spatial location. For example:
    *   *Email from 'John':* The system attempts to determine John's last known location (if shared) and projects the notification bubble near that location. If no location is available, it projects the bubble relative to the user's current heading.
    *   *Calendar Event – Meeting at 'Conference Room A':* The system projects a bubble directly onto the door of Conference Room A.
    *   *Social Media Update – Photo tagged with 'Eiffel Tower':* The system can attempt to project a small, stylized representation of the Eiffel Tower, with the notification attached, relative to the user’s view.
4.  **Audio-Visual Rendering:** The system renders both an audio and visual notification.
    *   *Audio:*  A spatially localized sound is emitted from the notification's projected location. Sound intensity and type are dependent on priority.
    *   *Visual:*  A dynamic bubble appears at the projected location. Bubble appearance changes with priority (e.g., flashing red for urgent, subtle glow for low priority). Bubbles can be interactive, allowing the user to dismiss or expand the notification with gestures.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously adjusts bubble position and audio levels as the user moves and the environment changes.  Occlusion detection prevents bubbles from being hidden behind objects.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function processNotification(notification):
  context = getContextualInformation()
  sourceLocation = determineSourceLocation(notification, context)

  if sourceLocation == null:
    sourceLocation = getUserHeading()

  bubble = createBubble(notification.priority, notification.type)
  bubble.setPosition(sourceLocation)

  sound = createSpatialSound(notification.priority, notification.type)
  sound.setPosition(sourceLocation)
  sound.play()

  bubble.show()

  //Continuous update loop:
  while (notification.isVisible()):
    bubble.adjustPosition(userPosition, environmentMap)
    sound.adjustVolume(distanceToUser)

```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Collaborative Notifications:** Multiple users in the same space can see and interact with shared notifications.
*   **Personalized Bubble Themes:** Users can customize the appearance of their notification bubbles.
*   **AI-Powered Content Summarization:** Bubbles can display concise summaries of long-form content.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:**  Combine visual and auditory cues with haptic vibrations.
