**Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction for Proactive Device Control**

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of monitoring audio output to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene *before* content is fully output, enabling proactive control of connected devices beyond simple operational status checks. This goes beyond verifying a device *is* playing something, and delves into *what* is being played, and *how* it impacts the surrounding environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Acoustic Scene Database & Feature Extraction:**

*   Establish a database of acoustic scenes categorized by content type (music, speech, movie soundtrack, ambient sound) and environmental characteristics (room size, material composition, background noise).
*   Implement real-time audio feature extraction:
    *   Spectral centroid, bandwidth, roll-off.
    *   Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs).
    *   Onset detection (for rhythm and musical structure).
    *   Sound event detection (classification of distinct sounds – e.g., speech, dog bark, car horn).
*   Develop an algorithm to create a ‘scene signature’ – a vector representation of the extracted features.

**2. Predictive Modeling & Anomaly Detection:**

*   Train a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) to predict future acoustic scene signatures based on a short history of observed audio data.  Input: Sequence of scene signatures. Output: Predicted scene signature for the next time step.
*   Implement an anomaly detection system. This system compares the predicted acoustic scene signature with the actually observed signature.  Large deviations indicate unexpected audio content or environmental changes.
*   Define ‘confidence thresholds’ for anomaly detection.  A high confidence level triggers a proactive response.

**3. Proactive Device Control Logic:**

*   **Lighting Control:**  If the predicted scene signature indicates a movie soundtrack with a high dynamic range (bass, explosions), proactively dim lights and activate ambient lighting to enhance the cinematic experience.
*   **HVAC Adjustment:** If the predicted scene signature indicates a live concert recording, proactively adjust the HVAC system to compensate for anticipated increased body heat from ‘dancing’.
*   **Smart Speaker Integration:** If the predicted scene signature indicates a phone call or voice assistant interaction, proactively reduce volume on other connected speakers.
*   **Security System Integration:** If the predicted scene signature indicates breaking glass (detected through sound event detection), proactively activate security cameras and send alerts.
*   **Noise Cancellation Adjustment:** Based on the reconstructed acoustic scene, adaptively adjust the noise cancellation profile of headphones or smart speakers to optimize sound quality.
*   **Volume Normalization:** Proactively normalize the volume level of different audio sources to provide a consistent listening experience.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Edge Processing:** Implement initial audio feature extraction on the requesting device (e.g., smart speaker, phone) to minimize latency.
*   **Cloud Processing:** Send extracted features to a cloud-based server for predictive modeling and anomaly detection.
*   **API Integration:** Provide an API for third-party device manufacturers to integrate with the system.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detectAnomaly(currentFeatures, predictedFeatures):
  difference = calculateDifference(currentFeatures, predictedFeatures)  // Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, etc.
  anomalyScore = normalize(difference) // Scale difference to a 0-1 range

  if anomalyScore > anomalyThreshold:
    return True  // Anomaly detected
  else:
    return False // No anomaly
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply verifying device operation to *anticipating* the audio experience and proactively adapting the surrounding environment. It combines acoustic scene reconstruction with predictive modeling and intelligent device control to create a more immersive and personalized audio experience.  Current systems primarily react to audio output; this system *prepares* for it.
