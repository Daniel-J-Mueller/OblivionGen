**Modular Cable Spine with Integrated Environmental Sensing**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple cable retention to create a 'smart' cable management system that monitors environmental factors alongside organizing cables. This utilizes the semi-rigid channel concept but adds integrated sensors and modular connection points.

**Specs:**

*   **Base Unit:** Semi-rigid spine constructed from a recyclable thermoplastic elastomer (TPE). Dimensions: 1” x 0.5” x variable length (modular segments). Internal channel dimensions: 0.4” diameter.
*   **Modular Segments:** 6” length segments, connectable end-to-end via a dovetail joint with integrated locking mechanism (small button press releases the lock).  Each segment contains:
    *   **Sensor Bay:** Recessed area for sensor module. Standardized connector (6-pin, low voltage).
    *   **Cable Channels:** Four parallel cable channels running the length of the segment.
    *   **Mounting Points:** Integrated mounting points (standard VESA pattern) on top and bottom surfaces.
*   **Sensor Modules (Interchangeable):**
    *   **Temperature/Humidity Sensor:** Measures ambient temperature and humidity. Outputs data via the 6-pin connector.
    *   **Air Quality Sensor:** Detects volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and particulate matter (PM2.5). Outputs data via the 6-pin connector.
    *   **Motion Sensor:** Detects movement near the cable spine (for security or automation applications). Outputs data via the 6-pin connector.
    *   **Power/Data Hub Module:** Provides power and data connectivity to connected devices. (USB-C, Ethernet).
*   **End Caps:** Semi-rigid end caps with smooth rounded edges. Available in various colors.
*   **Cable Retention Clips:** Small, removable clips that snap into slots within the cable channels to secure individual cables.
*   **Mounting System:** Options include:
    *   **Adhesive Mounts:** Double-sided adhesive strips for mounting to smooth surfaces.
    *   **Screw Mounts:** Screws for mounting to walls or other surfaces.
    *   **Magnetic Mounts:** Strong magnets for mounting to metal surfaces.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for transmitting sensor data to a smartphone or computer. Optional Wi-Fi connectivity for integration with a smart home system.

**Pseudocode (Data Handling):**

```
//Sensor Data Acquisition
function readSensorData(sensorModule):
  data = sensorModule.getData()
  return data

//Data Transmission (BLE)
function transmitData(data):
  BLE.send(data)

//Data Processing (App/Computer)
function processData(data):
  //Parse sensor data
  temperature = data.temperature
  humidity = data.humidity
  airQuality = data.airQuality

  //Log data to database/file
  logData(temperature, humidity, airQuality)

  //Trigger alerts based on thresholds
  if temperature > 80:
    sendAlert("High temperature detected")
  end if
end function
```

**Refinement notes:**

*   The modular design allows for customized cable management solutions.
*   Integrated sensors provide valuable environmental data.
*   The communication protocol enables remote monitoring and control.
*   The system is adaptable to a wide range of applications (home, office, data centers).
*   Material choice prioritizes recyclability and durability.
