## Variable Geometry Ducted Fan with Asymmetric Blade Pitch Control

**Concept:** A ducted fan propulsion system incorporating independently controllable pitch for each fan blade, coupled with a novel duct geometry designed to maximize thrust vectoring and efficiency across a broad range of operating conditions. This expands beyond simple thrust reversal to enable asymmetric lift generation and highly responsive maneuvering.

**Specifications:**

**1. Fan & Duct Geometry:**

*   **Duct Shape:** Non-circular, ellipsoidal duct cross-section. Major axis variable via internal actuators (see section 3). This allows for dynamic alteration of the effective 'wing' area, optimizing lift/drag ratio. Duct material: Carbon fiber composite with integrated strain sensors.
*   **Blade Count:** 8-12 blades. Optimized for low-noise and high-efficiency cruise, but capable of rapid pitch change. Blade Material: Carbon fiber composite with internal wiring for individual blade control.
*   **Blade Root Attachment:**  Flexible, vibration-damping mounts at the blade root. Each mount houses a miniature brushless DC motor coupled to a precision ball screw. This ensures smooth and precise pitch control, minimizing stress on the blades and hub.
*   **Hub Construction:**  Lightweight aluminum alloy with internal channels for wiring and coolant circulation. Hub houses the main control electronics and interfaces with the actuator network.

**2. Pitch Control System:**

*   **Actuation:** Each blade's pitch is independently controlled by a miniature brushless DC motor driving a precision ball screw.  Closed-loop control via Hall-effect sensors monitoring blade pitch angle.
*   **Control Algorithm:** A predictive control algorithm adjusts individual blade pitch based on airspeed, angle of attack, yaw rate, and desired thrust vector. Prioritizes minimizing turbulence and maximizing efficiency.
*   **Pitch Range:**  +/- 45 degrees. Allows for both thrust reversal and asymmetric lift generation.
*   **Power Supply:** Redundant power distribution system with battery backup.

**3. Duct Actuation System:**

*   **Actuators:** Four linear actuators positioned around the duct circumference. Controlled by the central flight control system.
*   **Movement:** Actuators dynamically alter the major axis of the ellipsoidal duct.
    *   **Increased Major Axis:** Increases effective wing area, maximizing lift at low speeds.
    *   **Decreased Major Axis:**  Reduces drag at high speeds, improving efficiency.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Strain gauges integrated into the duct structure monitor deformation and provide feedback to the control system.

**4. Control System Architecture:**

*   **Central Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded system with real-time operating system.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated inertial measurement unit (IMU), GPS, airspeed sensor, and duct strain sensors.
*   **Communication:** CAN bus interface for communication between control system, actuators, and sensors.
*   **Software:** PID control loops for pitch and duct actuation. Predictive control algorithm for thrust vectoring and efficiency optimization.

**Pseudocode for Thrust Vectoring Algorithm:**

```
// Inputs: Desired Thrust Vector (X, Y, Z), Airspeed, Angle of Attack, Yaw Rate
// Outputs: Individual Blade Pitch Angles (P1, P2, ..., Pn)

function CalculateBladePitchAngles(desiredThrustX, desiredThrustY, desiredThrustZ, airspeed, angleOfAttack, yawRate) {

  // Calculate ideal collective pitch based on desired thrust magnitude
  collectivePitch = CalculateCollectivePitch(desiredThrustMagnitude, airspeed);

  // Calculate cyclic pitch adjustments to vector thrust
  cyclicPitchX = CalculateCyclicPitch(desiredThrustX, airspeed);
  cyclicPitchY = CalculateCyclicPitch(desiredThrustY, airspeed);

  // Apply individual blade pitch adjustments based on cyclic pitch and blade position
  for (i = 0; i < numberOfBlades; i++) {
    bladeAngle = (360 / numberOfBlades) * i;
    P[i] = collectivePitch + cyclicPitchX * cos(bladeAngle) + cyclicPitchY * sin(bladeAngle);
  }

  // Limit pitch angles to maximum and minimum values
  for (i = 0; i < numberOfBlades; i++) {
    P[i] = constrain(P[i], minPitchAngle, maxPitchAngle);
  }

  return P;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Advanced UAVs requiring highly agile maneuvering
*   Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft
*   Compact propulsion systems for urban air mobility
*   Underwater propulsion systems with enhanced maneuverability.
