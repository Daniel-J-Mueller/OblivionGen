## Adaptive Emotional State Tagging for Multi-Modal Contact Review

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple quality scoring of customer service interactions to automatically tag emotional states *within* the interaction, not just overall satisfaction. This allows for more granular training and identification of agent skills (or weaknesses) related to handling specific customer emotional states.  The system would utilize multi-modal input – voice analysis, text analysis (for chat/email), and potentially even video analysis (facial expressions) – to dynamically tag segments of the interaction with emotional labels.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw contact data (audio, text, video – optional).
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   Audio: Noise reduction, speech-to-text conversion.
    *   Text: Tokenization, stemming/lemmatization, removal of stop words.
    *   Video: Facial detection, landmark extraction (if enabled).
*   **Output:** Cleaned, standardized data streams for each modality.

**2. Emotional State Analysis Engine:**

*   **Components:**
    *   **Voice Emotion Recognition (VER):**  Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks) trained on large datasets of emotional speech. Outputs probability scores for various emotions (e.g., anger, frustration, happiness, sadness, neutrality).
    *   **Text Emotion Analysis (TEA):**  Employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., sentiment analysis, emotion lexicon matching, transformer models) to determine emotional tone and intensity in text. Outputs probability scores for various emotions.
    *   **Video Emotion Recognition (VER – Optional):**  Uses computer vision models to analyze facial expressions and infer emotional states. Outputs probability scores.
*   **Fusion Logic:** A weighted average or more complex model (e.g., Bayesian network) combines emotion scores from each modality to generate a unified emotion profile for each short segment (e.g., 5-10 seconds) of the interaction. Weights can be dynamically adjusted based on data quality and modality reliability.
*   **Output:** Time-series data of emotion labels (e.g., "frustration: 0.8", "neutral: 0.2") associated with specific timestamps in the interaction.

**3. Contact Segmentation & Tagging Module:**

*   **Algorithm:** Sliding window approach. A window of fixed duration moves across the interaction.  Within each window:
    *   Calculate the dominant emotion based on the emotion profile.
    *   If the dominant emotion exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 0.7 probability), tag the window with that emotion.
    *   If no emotion exceeds the threshold, tag the window as “neutral” or “mixed”.
*   **Output:** Contact data with time-aligned emotion tags.  For example:
    *   0:00-0:05 – Neutral
    *   0:05-0:10 – Frustration (0.85)
    *   0:10-0:15 – Resolution (0.7)
    *   0:15-0:20 – Neutral

**4. Review & Analysis Interface:**

*   **Visualization:** Display the contact timeline with emotion tags highlighted.  Allow reviewers to quickly jump to segments tagged with specific emotions.
*   **Filtering:**  Enable reviewers to filter contacts based on emotion tags (e.g., show all contacts with high levels of customer frustration).
*   **Agent Performance Metrics:** Generate metrics on agent performance related to handling different emotional states (e.g., average resolution time for frustrated customers, success rate in de-escalating angry customers).
*   **Training Recommendations:** Suggest personalized training modules for agents based on their performance in handling specific emotional states.



**Pseudocode (Contact Segmentation & Tagging):**

```python
def segment_and_tag(emotion_profile, window_size, threshold):
  tagged_segments = []
  for i in range(0, len(emotion_profile) - window_size, window_size):
    window = emotion_profile[i:i+window_size]
    dominant_emotion = max(window, key=lambda x: x[1]) # Find emotion with highest probability
    if dominant_emotion[1] > threshold:
      tagged_segments.append((i/window_size, dominant_emotion[0], dominant_emotion[1])) # Time, Emotion, Probability
    else:
      tagged_segments.append((i/window_size, "Neutral", 0.0))
  return tagged_segments
```

This allows a much richer understanding of the customer interaction than just overall satisfaction and provides a basis for more targeted agent training.
