## Haptic Control & Biofeedback Integration

**Core Concept:** Augment the voice assistant with localized haptic feedback on the control knob, dynamically linked to biofeedback sensors, creating a multi-sensory control experience that enhances user awareness & accessibility.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Suite:** Integrated sensors (heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, muscle tension) in the housing, making contact with the userâ€™s hand during operation. Alternative: Wearable integration via Bluetooth.
*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or piezoelectric elements embedded within the control knob, capable of creating localized vibrations, textures, and directional forces. Array density: 32+ actuators.
*   **Real-time Data Processing:** Dedicated processor core within the assistant, managing biofeedback data acquisition, signal processing (noise reduction, feature extraction), and mapping to haptic patterns.
*   **Adaptive Haptic Profiles:** Machine learning algorithm that analyzes user biofeedback data *during* interaction (not just pre-defined profiles). Goal: To dynamically adjust haptic feedback to optimize user comfort, focus, and information conveyance.
*   **Multi-Modal Cueing:** Haptic feedback synchronized with visual cues on the light indicator *and* audio prompts, creating a cohesive sensory experience.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Focus Assist:** Algorithm analyzes HRV. If focus drops (indicated by decreased HRV coherence), a subtle, rhythmic haptic pulse is delivered to the control knob, acting as a gentle nudge to refocus attention. Intensity and frequency adjust based on biofeedback.
2.  **Emotional State Awareness:** GSR data correlated with emotional states. Haptic patterns change to reflect identified emotions (e.g., calm = slow, gentle vibrations; stressed = rapid, irregular pulses).  User can opt-in for emotion feedback.
3.  **Accessibility Enhancement:** For visually impaired users, haptic feedback provides directional cues. Rotating the knob elicits corresponding vibrations to indicate menu options or functions.  Vibration intensity proportional to selection priority.
4.  **Precision Control:**  During complex tasks (e.g., volume control, fast-forwarding), the haptic feedback provides a 'virtual detent' sensation, allowing for precise control even without visual feedback. Fine vibration 'clicks' mark incremental adjustments.
5.  **Call/Notification Prioritization:**  Different haptic patterns distinguish call sources/priorities.  Emergency contacts trigger distinct, urgent vibrations.  Customizable patterns for individual contacts.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Haptic Adjustment):**

```
// Input: Biofeedback Data (HRV, GSR), Current User Task, User Preferences
function adjustHaptics(bioData, task, preferences) {

    // Normalize Biofeedback Signals
    normalizedHRV = normalize(bioData.HRV)
    normalizedGSR = normalize(bioData.GSR)

    // Calculate Focus Score (Weighted combination of HRV and GSR)
    focusScore = (0.7 * normalizedHRV) + (0.3 * normalizedGSR)

    // Determine Base Haptic Pattern (based on Task)
    if (task == "Volume Control") {
        basePattern = "Continuous Vibration"
    } else if (task == "Navigation") {
        basePattern = "Directional Pulses"
    } else {
        basePattern = "Default Rhythm"
    }

    // Adjust Haptic Parameters based on Focus Score
    if (focusScore < 0.4) { // Low Focus
        intensity = 0.8 // Increase intensity
        frequency = 0.6 // Increase frequency
        pattern = "Urgent Pulse" // Switch to attention-grabbing pattern
    } else if (focusScore > 0.7) { // High Focus
        intensity = 0.2 // Reduce intensity
        frequency = 0.4 // Slow down frequency
        pattern = basePattern // Return to base pattern
    } else {
        intensity = 0.5
        frequency = 0.5
        pattern = basePattern
    }

    // Apply User Preferences (e.g., preferred vibration patterns)
    finalPattern = applyPreferences(finalPattern, preferences)

    // Send Haptic Commands to Actuator Array
    sendHapticCommand(finalPattern, intensity, frequency)
}
