## Temporal-Contextual Audio Embedding for Event Anticipation

**Concept:** Extend the subsampling/upsampling process to create a richer temporal embedding of audio events, focusing on *anticipation* rather than just detection. Instead of solely scoring frames *after* they occur, this system aims to predict potential events based on preceding audio context.

**Specifications:**

**1. Multi-Scale Temporal Context Network (MSTCN):**

*   **Input:** Raw audio waveform.
*   **Layers:**
    *   **Convolutional Feature Extraction:** Initial layers to extract fundamental audio features (MFCCs, spectrograms, etc.).
    *   **Parallel Recurrent Streams:** Three bi-directional recurrent neural networks (Bi-LSTMs or GRUs) operating in parallel, each with a different temporal receptive field:
        *   **Short-Range Stream:** Captures immediate audio transitions (e.g., 50ms window).
        *   **Mid-Range Stream:** Captures contextual information within a moderate timeframe (e.g., 250ms window).
        *   **Long-Range Stream:** Captures broader audio scene context (e.g., 1 second window).
    *   **Temporal Attention Mechanism:** An attention layer weighting the outputs of each recurrent stream based on their relevance to potential event anticipation. This prioritizes features from the most informative temporal scales.
    *   **Fusion Layer:** Concatenates the weighted outputs of the recurrent streams, creating a unified temporal embedding.
*   **Output:** A high-dimensional temporal embedding representing the audio context.

**2. Predictive Event Scoring Module (PESM):**

*   **Input:** Temporal embedding from MSTCN.
*   **Layers:**
    *   **Future Frame Prediction:** A decoder network (e.g., another LSTM or Transformer) trained to predict the *next* N audio frames based on the current temporal embedding. This prediction is not for perfect reconstruction, but to capture the likely evolution of the audio scene.
    *   **Prediction Error Calculation:** Compare the predicted frames with the actual subsequent audio frames. Calculate a prediction error metric (e.g., Mean Squared Error, perceptual loss).
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Treat significant prediction errors as anomalies indicating a potential event. Employ an anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., autoencoder, one-class SVM) to threshold the error and generate an event likelihood score.
*   **Output:** An event likelihood score indicating the probability of an event occurring in the near future.

**3. Dynamic Time Warping for Contextual Alignment:**

*   **Implementation:** Employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to align the temporal embedding with a library of known audio event patterns.
*   **Function:**  Instead of simply scoring the likelihood of an event, DTW can identify *which* event is most likely to occur based on the current audio context. This provides a more nuanced understanding of the audio scene.
*   **Integration:** Use the DTW alignment score as an additional feature in the PESM, further refining the event likelihood score.

**Pseudocode (Event Scoring):**

```
function score_event(audio_waveform):
  temporal_embedding = MSTCN(audio_waveform)
  predicted_frames = predict_next_frames(temporal_embedding)
  error = calculate_prediction_error(predicted_frames, actual_frames)
  anomaly_score = anomaly_detector(error)
  dtw_score = DTW(temporal_embedding, event_library)
  event_likelihood = combine(anomaly_score, dtw_score)  # weighted sum or other fusion technique
  return event_likelihood
```

**Novelty:** This system diverges from simple event detection by focusing on *predicting* events based on learned temporal patterns. The multi-scale approach captures both immediate transitions and broader contextual information. The predictive element enables proactive responses and enhanced situational awareness.
