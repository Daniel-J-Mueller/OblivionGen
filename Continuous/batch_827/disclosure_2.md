## Modular Docking Station with Integrated Biofeedback & Environmental Control

**Concept:** A docking station that goes beyond simply charging devices. It incorporates biofeedback sensors and localized environmental controls to create a personalized "focus zone" for the user while their devices charge.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Module:**
   - Dimensions: 150mm x 150mm x 50mm (Base unit)
   - Materials: Anodized Aluminum with a soft-touch, matte finish.
   - Connectivity: USB-C (x3 - Power Delivery 3.1), USB-A (x2 - 3.2 Gen 1), Wireless Charging Pad (Qi standard - 15W)
   - Internal Power Supply: 120W GaN-based power supply for efficiency.

**2. Biofeedback Module (Attachable):**
   - Sensors:
     - EEG Sensor (Single-channel, forehead-based for focus/relaxation detection).
     - Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Sensor (Photoplethysmography - finger clip or earlobe sensor).
     - Skin Conductance Sensor (GSR - hand rest).
   - Data Processing: Integrated microcontroller (ESP32) for sensor data acquisition and basic analysis.  Data transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
   - User Interface: Small OLED display on module showing real-time focus/relaxation score.
   - Mounting: Magnetic attachment to the core module.

**3. Environmental Control Module (Attachable):**
   - Air Purification: HEPA filter and activated carbon filter for removing particulates and odors.
   - Aromatherapy Diffuser: Ultrasonic diffuser compatible with essential oil blends. Reservoir capacity: 20ml.
   - Ambient Lighting: RGB LED strip with adjustable brightness and color temperature. Controllable via software/app.
   - Noise Cancellation: Small, directional speaker emitting white noise/pink noise/binaural beats.
   - Mounting: Magnetic attachment to core module.

**4. Software/App Integration:**
   - Mobile App (iOS/Android):
     - Real-time biofeedback data visualization.
     - Customizable focus/relaxation profiles.
     - Control of ambient lighting, aromatherapy, and noise cancellation.
     - Integration with music streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music) for curated focus playlists.
     - Scheduling: Ability to schedule focus sessions with automated environmental adjustments.
   - Open API: Allow third-party developers to integrate with the biofeedback data and control the environmental settings.

**5. Advanced Features (Future Iterations):**
   - **AI-Powered Personalization:** Machine learning algorithms to analyze biofeedback data and automatically adjust environmental settings for optimal focus and relaxation.
   - **Haptic Feedback:** Subtle vibrations in the docking station to provide gentle reminders to maintain focus or relax.
   - **Brainwave Entrainment:**  Use of audio-visual stimulation to guide brainwave activity for specific mental states.
   - **Biometric Authentication:** Use of HRV or EEG data for secure device unlocking or access control.



**Pseudocode (Biofeedback Data Processing):**

```
// Initialize sensors (EEG, HRV, GSR)

loop {
  readEEGData()
  readHRVData()
  readGSRData()

  // Process EEG data (e.g., detect alpha/beta wave activity)
  alphaActivity = calculateAlphaActivity(eegData)
  betaActivity = calculateBetaActivity(eegData)

  // Process HRV data (calculate RMSSD, SDNN)
  rmssd = calculateRMSSD(hrvData)
  sdnn = calculateSDNN(hrvData)

  // Process GSR data (calculate skin conductance level)
  scl = calculateSkinConductanceLevel(gsrData)

  // Calculate focus/relaxation score
  focusScore = (betaActivity * 0.6) + (rmssd * 0.2) + (scl * 0.2)
  relaxationScore = (alphaActivity * 0.6) + (sdnn * 0.2) + (scl * 0.2)

  // Display scores on OLED display
  displayFocusScore(focusScore)
  displayRelaxationScore(relaxationScore)

  // Send data to mobile app via BLE
  sendDataToApp(focusScore, relaxationScore, eegData, hrvData, gsrData)

  delay(100ms)
}
