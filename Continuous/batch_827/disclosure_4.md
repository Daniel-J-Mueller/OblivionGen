## Dynamic Stowage Zone Assignment & Robotic Swarm Integration

**Concept:** Expand the proximity-based guidance to include dynamically assigned stowage zones, managed by a robotic swarm. Instead of simply illuminating bins, the system assigns an associate a temporary “zone” within the storage facility. This zone is optimized based on item type, associate skill, current congestion, and robotic availability.

**Specs:**

*   **Zone Definition:** Storage facility segmented into logical “zones” (e.g., A1-A10, B1-B10). Each zone contains multiple bins. Zones are dynamic – their boundaries and contents can shift based on real-time data.
*   **Associate Skill Profile:** System maintains a profile for each associate, tracking speed, accuracy, and preferred item types.
*   **Robotic Swarm:** A fleet of small, mobile robots (30-50) operates within the facility. These robots are not for item retrieval, but for *zone conditioning*.
*   **Zone Conditioning:** Robots proactively prepare zones for associates. This includes:
    *   **Light Guidance:** Illuminate bins within the assigned zone, as in the base patent.
    *   **Obstacle Removal:** Clear obstructions around bins (boxes, misplaced items).
    *   **Bin Status Reporting:** Confirm bin capacity and compatibility (using sensors).
    *   **Weight Distribution Monitoring:**  Assess total weight within bins and flag potential overloads.
*   **Real-Time Optimization:** A central AI engine continuously optimizes zone assignments based on:
    *   **Item Flow:** Predicts incoming item types and volumes.
    *   **Associate Availability:** Tracks associate location and workload.
    *   **Robotic Status:** Monitors robot battery life, location, and task completion.
    *   **Congestion Mapping:** Identifies and avoids congested areas.
*   **Heuristic Algorithm (Zone Assignment):**
    1.  `IF new item received:`
    2.  `Determine item characteristics (size, weight, compatibility).`
    3.  `Query available zones for capacity and compatibility.`
    4.  `Calculate a "fitness score" for each zone based on:`
        *   `Associate Skill Match (higher score for preferred item type)`
        *   `Zone Capacity (available space)`
        *   `Zone Congestion (lower score for high congestion)`
        *   `Robotic Proximity (lower score if robot is already conditioning the zone)`
    5.  `Assign item to zone with highest fitness score.`
    6.  `Dispatch robotic swarm to condition the assigned zone (clear obstructions, verify capacity, etc.).`
    7.  `Illuminated guidance for associate.`
*   **Accessibility Factor:**  Calculated as: `(Distance to zone center) * (1 - (Obstruction Density))`
*   **Associate Interface:** Augmented reality glasses display:
    *   Assigned Zone boundaries
    *   Optimal path to zone
    *   Illuminated bin guidance
    *   Real-time alerts (e.g., overloaded bin, obstructed path)
    *   Robot status within zone (e.g. “Zone being prepared”)
*   **Data Logging:** Track associate performance within assigned zones, robotic efficiency, and overall system throughput.  Use this data to refine the heuristic algorithm and optimize zone assignments.
