## Dynamic Item ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization

**Concept:** Extend the comparative analysis beyond simple A vs. B vs. C. Instead, model a dynamic ‘ecosystem’ of related items, visualizing how user choices ripple through potential purchases.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Input:** Utilize existing user activity data (views, purchases, session data) *plus* item metadata (categories, tags, associated products - think "customers who bought this also bought…"). Incorporate external data sources – social media sentiment, review scores, trending searches.

2.  **Ecosystem Graph Construction:**
    *   Each item is a node in a directed graph.
    *   Edge weight represents the probability of transitioning from one item to another based on user behavior. (e.g. viewing item A *increases* the probability of viewing/purchasing item B).  This goes beyond simple co-viewing – factor in *sequential* views.
    *   Node color/size represents item popularity/revenue.
    *   Edges can be categorized (e.g., “complementary”, “substitute”, “often viewed together”).

3.  **Visualization Engine:**
    *   Interactive force-directed graph displayed on a web page or app.
    *   User can select a 'seed' item.
    *   Algorithm calculates and highlights the 'ecosystem' around the seed item (e.g., top 10-20 most influential nodes).
    *   Users can adjust parameters:  "depth" (how many degrees of separation from the seed item), "influence threshold" (minimum edge weight to display), filter by category/price/rating.

4.  **‘Choice Ripple’ Simulation:**
    *   User ‘selects’ an item (simulating a purchase).
    *   Algorithm simulates how this choice affects the ‘ecosystem’.
    *   Nodes ‘shift’ based on predicted changes in influence. Edges ‘thicken’ or ‘thin’ based on predicted changes in transition probability.
    *   Visual representation of ‘winners’ and ‘losers’ as a result of the choice.

5.  **Personalized Ecosystems:**
    *   Ecosystem graph is built *specifically* for each user, based on their browsing/purchase history.
    *   Algorithm adapts over time, learning user preferences.

**Pseudocode (Simplified ‘Choice Ripple’ Simulation):**

```
function simulateChoiceRipple(user, seedItem, selectedItem):
  ecosystemGraph = buildEcosystemGraph(user) //based on history & external data

  //increase weight of edges leading to selectedItem
  for each node in ecosystemGraph:
    if node is connected to selectedItem:
      edgeWeight = edgeWeight * rippleFactor //rippleFactor > 1

  //decrease weight of edges leading to competing items (items in same category, similar function)
  for each competingItem in findCompetingItems(selectedItem):
    for each node in ecosystemGraph:
        if node is connected to competingItem:
            edgeWeight = edgeWeight * dampenFactor //dampenFactor < 1

  //re-calculate node influence based on adjusted edge weights
  nodeInfluence = calculateNodeInfluence(ecosystemGraph)

  //return updated ecosystemGraph with visual cues for changes
```

**Potential UI Elements:**

*   Search bar to explore different seed items.
*   Filters to refine the ecosystem visualization.
*   Tooltips with detailed item information.
*   "What if?" scenarios to simulate the impact of different choices.
*   Option to save/share personalized ecosystems.
