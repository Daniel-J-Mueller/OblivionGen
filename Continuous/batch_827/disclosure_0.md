**Battery Swelling Predictive Algorithm & Haptic Feedback System**

**Concept:** Leveraging micro-strain gauges *within* the battery cells themselves, alongside the dimensional change detection of the housing, to predict swelling *before* it becomes significant and trigger a tiered haptic feedback system. This goes beyond simply *detecting* swelling to *anticipating* it.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Type:** Piezoelectric micro-strain gauges (approx. 1mm x 1mm x 0.2mm) embedded *directly* onto the exterior casing of each individual battery cell *during* cell manufacturing. These gauges measure minute changes in cell expansion/contraction.
*   **Gauge Placement:** Minimum of three gauges per cell – one center, two opposing edges.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Dedicated low-power analog-to-digital converter (ADC) chip integrated into the battery pack’s BMS (Battery Management System). Sampling rate: 10 Hz per gauge.
*   **Algorithm:** A Kalman filter-based predictive algorithm running on the BMS microcontroller.  Input data: micro-strain gauge readings, cell temperature (existing BMS data), charge/discharge cycles (existing BMS data). Output: Predicted swelling rate (mm/cycle).

    ```pseudocode
    function predictSwelling(microStrainData, temp, cycles):
      // Initialize Kalman filter parameters (state transition matrix, measurement matrix, process noise covariance, measurement noise covariance)
      // These would be empirically determined for the specific battery chemistry and cell design
      kalmanFilter.initialize(batteryChemistry, cellDesign)
      
      // Predict next state based on current state and process model
      predictedState = kalmanFilter.predict(currentState)
      
      // Update state based on measurements from micro-strain gauges and temperature sensors
      currentState = kalmanFilter.update(predictedState, microStrainData, temp)
      
      // Calculate swelling rate based on change in state (predicted cell expansion)
      swellingRate = calculateSwellingRate(currentState)
      
      return swellingRate
    ```

*   **Haptic Feedback System:**  Multiple vibration motors strategically placed on the device housing (e.g., around the battery compartment).  Intensity and pattern of vibration correspond to predicted swelling rate.

    *   **Level 1 (Green):**  Low swelling rate (predicted swelling < 0.1mm/100 cycles).  Very subtle, rhythmic pulse.  Informative, "all is well".
    *   **Level 2 (Yellow):**  Moderate swelling rate (0.1mm - 0.3mm/100 cycles).  More noticeable, intermittent vibration.  Warning.
    *   **Level 3 (Red):**  High swelling rate (> 0.3mm/100 cycles).  Rapid, continuous vibration.  Urgent.  Device should be powered down and inspected.

*   **Data Logging:** All micro-strain gauge data, predicted swelling rates, and haptic feedback events logged to the BMS for long-term analysis and predictive maintenance.

*   **Power Budget:** The micro-strain gauges and data acquisition system must operate on minimal power – ideally drawing less than 50mW total during active data collection.

**Novelty:** Existing dimensional change detection focuses on *after* swelling has begun. This system aims to *predict* it, giving users time to react and preventing potential safety hazards. The tiered haptic feedback provides a non-intrusive, intuitive way to communicate battery health.  The integration of micro-strain gauges *within* the cells, not just relying on housing deformation, provides a more accurate and sensitive measurement.
