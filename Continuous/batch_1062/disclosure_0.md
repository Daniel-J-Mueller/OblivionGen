## Dynamic Sentiment-Filtered Knowledge Graph for Proactive Content Generation

**Concept:** Leverage the core idea of separating indexed content from the full data source, but instead of just keywords and statistics, build a dynamic knowledge graph representing relationships *without* overt sentiment. This graph then proactively generates content variations based on inferred user intent, layering in sentiment only at the final presentation stage.

**Specs:**

**1. Knowledge Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Source:** Corpus of customer reviews (like in the patent), product descriptions, forum posts – any data regarding the item.
*   **Extraction Engine:**  A Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline that extracts entities (nouns, proper nouns, technical terms), relationships between entities (verb phrases representing actions or connections), and attributes. *Crucially, sentiment analysis is performed but discarded at this stage*.  The engine outputs triples: (Entity1, Relationship, Entity2).
*   **Neutralization Process:**  Adjectives and adverbs directly expressing sentiment are removed or replaced with neutral equivalents. E.g., "Excellent battery life" becomes "Battery life is long".  This ensures the core graph represents factual relationships, not opinions. Use a lexicon-based approach initially, expanded with machine learning for nuanced cases.
*   **Graph Database:** Store the triples in a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune). This allows efficient traversal and querying of relationships.

**2. Intent Inference Module:**

*   **User Query Analysis:** Analyze user search queries or browsing behavior to infer their intent.  Use techniques like:
    *   **Keyword Extraction:** Identify key concepts in the query.
    *   **Topic Modeling:** Determine the overarching theme of the query.
    *   **Entity Recognition:** Identify specific entities mentioned in the query.
*   **Intent Classification:** Classify the user’s intent into predefined categories (e.g., “feature comparison”, “problem solving”, “buying guide”).
*   **Graph Traversal Plan:** Based on the inferred intent, generate a plan for traversing the knowledge graph to retrieve relevant information.  This plan specifies the starting entity, the desired relationships to follow, and the depth of the traversal.

**3. Dynamic Content Generation:**

*   **Information Retrieval:** Execute the graph traversal plan to retrieve a set of related entities and relationships.
*   **Contextualization:**  Combine the retrieved information into a coherent narrative.  This involves:
    *   **Sentence Construction:** Generate sentences describing the relationships between entities. Use templated sentences initially, expanded with a generative language model (GPT-3, etc.) for more natural language.
    *   **Relevance Ranking:** Rank the generated sentences based on their relevance to the user’s query.
*   **Sentiment Layering:** *Only at this stage*, apply sentiment analysis to the original source data associated with the retrieved entities.  Select sentiment-laden phrases or quotes that align with the user’s inferred emotional state (e.g., positive sentiment for a user looking for recommendations, negative sentiment for a user reporting a problem). Inject these phrases into the generated content to add emotional resonance.

**4. Presentation & A/B Testing:**

*   **Content Delivery:** Present the dynamically generated content to the user.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Continuously A/B test different sentiment layering strategies and content generation templates to optimize for user engagement and conversion rates.



**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
def generate_content(user_query, knowledge_graph):
  intent = infer_intent(user_query)
  relevant_entities = traverse_graph(knowledge_graph, intent)
  generated_text = build_contextual_narrative(relevant_entities)
  sentiment_phrases = get_sentiment_phrases(relevant_entities, user_query)
  final_content = inject_sentiment(generated_text, sentiment_phrases)
  return final_content
```

**Novelty:**

This approach differs from the patent by shifting from simple keyword promotion to a structured, relationship-driven knowledge graph. By separating factual information from sentiment and injecting it dynamically, the system can tailor content to individual user needs and emotional states in a more sophisticated way. This enables proactive content generation that anticipates user intent and delivers a personalized experience.
