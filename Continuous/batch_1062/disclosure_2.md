## Dynamic Data Masking via Behavioral Analysis

**Specification:** Implement a system for granular data access control that dynamically masks sensitive data *based on user behavior* rather than predefined rules. This extends the existing permissions framework by adding a layer of adaptive security.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Profiler:** A module that continuously monitors user interactions with the database. This includes query patterns (tables accessed, columns selected, filters applied), access times, frequency of access, and data modification operations. This data is used to create a baseline behavioral profile for each user or user group.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** This engine compares current user behavior against their baseline profile. Statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, outlier detection) and potentially machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) are used to identify anomalous behavior.
*   **Dynamic Masking Service:**  Based on the anomaly score generated by the Anomaly Detection Engine, this service applies data masking techniques in *real-time*. Masking can include:
    *   **Column-level redaction:** Completely hiding specific columns.
    *   **Row-level filtering:**  Omitting entire rows.
    *   **Data substitution:** Replacing sensitive data with placeholder values.
    *   **Data generalization:** Aggregating or rounding data.
*   **Policy Engine:**  A configurable policy engine allows administrators to define the *severity thresholds* for anomalies and the corresponding masking actions.  This allows for fine-grained control over the system's sensitivity. Policies are structured around user groups/roles, data sensitivity classifications and masking techniques.
*   **Auditing and Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all access attempts, anomaly detections, and masking actions.  This is essential for security monitoring and compliance.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On User Query:

anomaly_score = BehavioralProfiler.calculate_anomaly(user_id, query);

if (anomaly_score > policy.threshold) {
    masked_query = DynamicMaskingService.apply_masking(query, anomaly_score, policy);
    execute_query(masked_query);
} else {
    execute_query(query);
}

// Behavioral Profiler:
function calculate_anomaly(user_id, query):
    baseline_profile = get_baseline_profile(user_id)
    deviation = calculate_deviation(query, baseline_profile)
    anomaly_score = function(deviation) // Using a statistical function or ML model
    return anomaly_score
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User submits a query to the database.
2.  The Behavioral Profiler analyzes the query and compares it to the user's baseline profile.
3.  The Anomaly Detection Engine calculates an anomaly score.
4.  The Policy Engine determines whether masking is required based on the anomaly score and predefined policies.
5.  The Dynamic Masking Service applies the appropriate masking techniques to the query.
6.  The modified query is executed against the database.
7.  All actions are logged for auditing purposes.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system can learn from user behavior over time to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Incorporate additional contextual information (e.g., time of day, location, device) into the anomaly detection process.
*   **Integration with Threat Intelligence Feeds:**  Leverage external threat intelligence data to identify malicious activity.
*   **AI-Driven Masking:** Utilize machine learning models to automatically determine the optimal masking techniques for different types of sensitive data.
