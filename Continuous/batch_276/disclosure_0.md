## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Query Routing

**Concept:** This system builds upon the idea of multiple database formats but introduces *dynamic* sharding based on predicted query patterns and resource availability. Instead of simply selecting a format based on a single query, the system learns a customer's query behavior *over time* and proactively shards data across multiple storage engines, optimizing not for a single query, but for the *cumulative* performance of all expected queries.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component: Predictive Query Router (PQR)**: A machine learning model trained on historical query data (customer ID, query type, frequency, data accessed, time of day, etc.). The PQR predicts the *next* most likely query type for a given customer.
*   **Sharding Engine:** Responsible for physically distributing data across different storage engines (e.g., relational, document, graph).  Data is *not* duplicated entirely. Instead, a 'metadata layer' maps logical data to physical shards.
*   **Storage Engine Pool:** A configurable collection of various database technologies.  Each engine has associated resource monitoring (CPU, memory, I/O).
*   **Metadata Layer:** A key-value store mapping logical data identifiers to physical shard locations (storage engine ID, specific data block/segment).
*   **Dynamic Re-Sharding:** The system periodically (or in response to significant query pattern shifts) re-shards data. Re-sharding prioritizes minimizing the predicted latency for future queries based on PQR output and available storage resources.
*   **Resource-Aware Routing:**  When a query arrives, the PQR predicts the query type.  The system then consults the metadata layer.  However, *before* executing the query against the identified shard, it checks the resource availability of that shardâ€™s storage engine. If the engine is overloaded, the system *rewrites* the query (if possible) to utilize an alternative shard with sufficient resources.
*   **Query Rewrite Engine**: Allows for basic query translation across storage engine types (e.g., converting a SQL JOIN into a graph traversal for a graph database). Focus is on semantic equivalence, not 1:1 translation.
*   **Monitoring & Feedback Loop**: Performance metrics (query latency, throughput, resource utilization) are collected and fed back into the PQR model to refine its predictions.

**Pseudocode (Query Routing):**

```
function routeQuery(customerID, query):
  predictedQueryType = PQR.predict(customerID, query)
  metadata = MetadataLayer.lookup(query, customerID) // Returns shard location

  if metadata == null:
    // Handle case where data isn't sharded - default to primary shard
    shardLocation = primaryShard
  else:
    shardLocation = metadata.shardLocation

  resourceStatus = StorageEnginePool.getResourceStatus(shardLocation)

  if resourceStatus.cpuUsage > threshold or resourceStatus.memoryUsage > threshold:
    rewrittenQuery = QueryRewriteEngine.rewrite(query, shardLocation)
    if rewrittenQuery != null:
      alternativeShard = findAlternativeShard(rewrittenQuery)
      if alternativeShard != null:
        shardLocation = alternativeShard
      else:
        // Fallback to primary shard if rewrite fails
        shardLocation = primaryShard

  executeQuery(query, shardLocation)
```

**Novelty**: This system moves beyond static format selection to proactive, predictive sharding and resource-aware routing, allowing for truly dynamic optimization of database performance based on anticipated query patterns. The rewrite engine, though basic, adds flexibility. While existing systems might shard based on data content, this system shards based on *predicted access patterns*.
