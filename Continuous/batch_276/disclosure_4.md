## Predictive Subdomain Takeover Mitigation via Behavioral Analysis

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Behavioral Baseline Generator:**  Analyzes historical DNS resolution patterns, HTTP response characteristics (TLS handshake details, header structures, content types), and API response data for each monitored subdomain.  Creates a ‘digital fingerprint’ encompassing these elements.  Data retention policy configurable (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days).
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:**  Compares current DNS/HTTP/API responses to the established baseline.  Employs statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, moving averages, machine learning algorithms - Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify deviations indicating potential takeover attempts.  Configurable sensitivity levels.
*   **Reputation Service Interface:** Queries external threat intelligence feeds (e.g., blocklists, abuse databases) to assess the reputation of any newly observed IP addresses or content sources associated with a subdomain.
*   **Automated Verification Module:**  Upon anomaly detection, initiates a series of automated tests:
    *   **DNS Consistency Check:** Verifies that the current DNS resolution aligns with the authorized DNS records.
    *   **Content Verification:**  Fetches and compares current content with a known-good snapshot (if available).
    *   **API Authentication Test:** Attempts to authenticate with the API using known credentials (if applicable).
*   **Dynamic Mitigation Policy Engine:**  Based on the severity of the anomaly and configured policies, automatically triggers one or more mitigation actions:
    *   **DNS TTL Reduction:**  Shortens the DNS TTL to accelerate propagation of corrective DNS updates.
    *   **Traffic Redirection:** Redirects traffic to a safe fallback page or server.
    *   **Alert Escalation:** Notifies security personnel via email, SMS, or other channels.
    *   **Automated DNS Record Update:** (with appropriate authorization controls) updates DNS records to point to safe infrastructure.

**II. Data Flow & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   User provides list of subdomains to monitor.
    *   Behavioral Baseline Generator collects historical data for each subdomain.

2.  **Monitoring Loop (runs periodically):**
    *   For each subdomain:
        *   Resolve DNS record.
        *   Fetch HTTP response (if applicable).
        *   Send API request (if applicable).

3.  **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Compare current DNS/HTTP/API responses to the baseline.
    *   If significant deviation detected:
        *   Query Reputation Service.
        *   If Reputation Service indicates malicious activity:
            *   Trigger high-severity alert.
            *   Initiate automated mitigation.
        *   Otherwise:
            *   Log anomaly for further investigation.
            *   Adjust sensitivity levels.

4.  **Automated Mitigation (Pseudocode):**

```
function mitigate_takeover(subdomain, anomaly_type, severity):
  if severity == "high":
    reduce_dns_ttl(subdomain, 60)  //Shorten TTL to 60 seconds
    redirect_traffic(subdomain, "safe_fallback_page")
    escalate_alert("subdomain takeover detected - high severity")
  elif severity == "medium":
    log_anomaly(subdomain, anomaly_type)
    adjust_sensitivity(subdomain, "increase")
  else:
    //Low severity, log and monitor
    log_anomaly(subdomain, anomaly_type)

  if anomaly_type == "DNS_MISMATCH":
      update_dns_record(subdomain, "safe_ip_address")
```

**III.  System Architecture:**

*   Deployed as a distributed microservice architecture.
*   Scalable using containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes).
*   Data stored in a time-series database for efficient analysis.
*   API-driven for integration with existing security tools.
*   Utilizes message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication.

**IV.  Novel Aspects:**

This system goes beyond simple resource existence checks. It utilizes behavioral analysis to detect subtle anomalies indicative of takeover attempts, enabling proactive mitigation before a full compromise occurs. The dynamic mitigation policy engine allows for automated responses tailored to the specific threat level and context.
