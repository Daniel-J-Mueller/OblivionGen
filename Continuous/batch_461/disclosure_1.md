## Adaptive Persona Weaving for Multi-Turn Dialog

**Concept:** Extend the speechlet handoff concept to incorporate dynamic persona creation and refinement *during* the dialog session, leveraging contextual data and user interaction to build increasingly accurate and engaging conversational experiences.  Instead of simply routing to a component based on action, the system constructs a “persona” representing the current dialog state and utilizes this persona to influence component selection and response generation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Persona Data Structure:**  A JSON-based object containing:
    *   `user_profile_data`:  (Existing) User demographics, preferences, history.
    *   `dialog_history`:  A rolling window of previous user utterances and system responses (textual representation).
    *   `contextual_tags`:  Tags extracted from the current utterance and dialog history (e.g., 'weather', 'restaurant_booking', 'technical_support').  These can be generated via NLP (NER, topic modeling).
    *   `sentiment_score`:  Real-time sentiment analysis of the user's current utterance.
    *   `persona_vector`: A high dimensional vector embedding representing the cumulative persona (updated with each turn).  This is the core “identity” of the current dialog state.
    *   `component_affinity`: A vector indicating the suitability of each available speechlet/component for the current persona.

2.  **Persona Weaver Service:**  A dedicated microservice responsible for:
    *   Receiving raw user input and existing Persona Data.
    *   Performing NLP to extract contextual tags and sentiment.
    *   Updating the `persona_vector` based on the current interaction (using a recurrent neural network or similar time-series model).  The learning rate would need to be carefully tuned.
    *   Calculating the `component_affinity` vector.
    *   Returning the updated Persona Data.

3.  **Component Selection Algorithm:**  Modify the existing component selection process to:
    *   Receive the Persona Data *in addition to* the user's natural language understanding (NLU) results.
    *   Calculate a “compatibility score” between the current Persona Data and each available component, using a dot product (or similar metric) between the Persona Data’s `persona_vector` and each component’s registered `component_vector`.  Components would register `component_vectors` indicating their expertise.
    *   Select the component with the highest compatibility score.  If scores are tied, use existing ranking data as a tiebreaker.

4.  **Response Modulation:**
    *   Each component *receives* the Persona Data along with the user input.
    *   Components utilize the Persona Data to personalize their responses (e.g., adjusting tone, vocabulary, level of detail).
    *   Components can *contribute* to the Persona Data (e.g., adding new contextual tags, refining the sentiment score) before passing it on to the next component.

**Pseudocode (Component Selection):**

```
function selectComponent(nluResults, personaData):
  componentList = getAvailableComponents()
  compatibilityScores = []

  for component in componentList:
    compatibilityScore = dotProduct(personaData.persona_vector, component.component_vector)
    compatibilityScores.append(compatibilityScore)

  bestComponentIndex = argmax(compatibilityScores)
  selectedComponent = componentList[bestComponentIndex]

  return selectedComponent
```

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond simply routing actions to components. It creates a dynamic, evolving representation of the dialog state that influences component selection and response generation. It allows for more personalized and engaging conversational experiences, adapting to the user's evolving needs and preferences.
