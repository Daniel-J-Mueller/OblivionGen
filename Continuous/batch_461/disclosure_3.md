## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Interactive Narrative

**Concept:** Expand beyond predicting sentiment *towards* content and actively *shape* content based on real-time, granular emotional responses, creating a truly dynamic and personalized narrative experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Emotional Input Layer:** Captures multi-modal emotional data. This includes:
    *   Facial expression analysis (via camera).
    *   Voice tone & inflection analysis (microphone).
    *   Biometric data (heart rate variability, skin conductance - wearable sensors).
    *   Behavioral data (mouse movements, gaze tracking, interaction choices).
    *   Textual input analysis (sentiment analysis of typed responses).
*   **Emotional Feature Extraction & Fusion:** Combines the above data streams into a unified emotional signature.  Utilizes a weighted average approach, with weights dynamically adjusted based on individual user calibration (see Section 3).
*   **Emotional Resonance Map (ERM):** A multi-dimensional data structure that tracks the user’s emotional state over time, specifically linked to *narrative segments* (defined below). The ERM isn’t just sentiment – it stores intensity levels for a range of emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, etc.).
*   **Narrative Segmentation Engine:** Divides the interactive narrative into discrete segments (scenes, dialogue exchanges, gameplay moments) – roughly 5-15 seconds in duration.
*   **Dynamic Narrative Adjustment Engine:**  The core component. This uses the ERM to:
    *   **Select the next narrative segment:** Based on maximizing “emotional engagement” – a weighted combination of desired emotional states (e.g., a scene that will increase joy *without* triggering fear).
    *   **Modify existing narrative segments:** Alter dialogue, pacing, sound effects, visual elements, or even gameplay mechanics *within* a segment, based on the user’s real-time emotional response.
    *   **Branch the narrative:**  Initiate entirely new narrative paths based on cumulative emotional data – creating a genuinely personalized story.

**2. Algorithm – Dynamic Narrative Selection:**

```pseudocode
// Input:  Current ERM, List of potential narrative segments (with emotional profiles)
// Output: Selected narrative segment

function selectSegment(ERM, segmentList):
  bestSegment = null
  maxEngagementScore = -Infinity

  for each segment in segmentList:
    // Calculate engagement score based on:
    // 1. Emotional Alignment:  How well the segment’s emotional profile matches the user’s current emotional state (ERM)
    // 2. Emotional Contrast:  The potential to shift the user’s emotional state in a desired direction (e.g., alleviate negative emotions, intensify positive ones)
    // 3. Novelty:  A bonus for segments that haven't been shown recently
    engagementScore = calculateEngagementScore(ERM, segment)

    if engagementScore > maxEngagementScore:
      maxEngagementScore = engagementScore
      bestSegment = segment

  return bestSegment
```

**3. User Calibration & Personalization:**

*   **Initial Calibration Phase:**  The system presents a series of pre-defined stimuli (video clips, audio cues, interactive scenarios) and measures the user’s physiological and behavioral responses. This establishes a baseline mapping between emotional expression and internal emotional state for *that individual*. This calibration is used to weight the different emotional input streams and improve accuracy.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously refines the user’s emotional profile over time, based on their ongoing responses to the narrative. This allows the system to learn individual nuances in emotional expression and improve the personalization of the experience.

**4.  Implementation Notes:**

*   **Emotional Profiles:** Each narrative segment will be assigned an “emotional profile” – a vector representing the expected emotional response elicited by that segment. This can be determined through user testing or through automated analysis of content.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Requires a camera, microphone, and potentially biometric sensors (e.g., heart rate monitor, skin conductance sensor).
*   **Content Creation Tools:** Develop tools to allow content creators to easily define emotional profiles for narrative segments and to create branching narrative paths.
