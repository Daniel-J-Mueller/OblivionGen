## Adaptive Session Contextualization

**Concept:** Extend the multi-site session management to dynamically adjust security and data sharing based on *context* â€“ not just site, but user behavior, network conditions, and inferred risk.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Gathering Module:**

*   **Input:** Standard session data (site, cookies, etc.), network connection type (public Wi-Fi, private network), device posture (rooted/jailbroken, OS version), geolocation (coarse-grained), user interaction patterns (typing speed, mouse movements, time spent on page, scrolling behavior).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time analysis of input data.
    *   Risk scoring based on weighted factors (e.g., public Wi-Fi + fast typing + accessing financial site = high risk).
    *   Behavioral profiling - establish baseline user behavior. Deviations trigger increased scrutiny.
*   **Output:**  Contextual Risk Score, Behavioral Anomaly Flag, Network Condition Indicator.

**2. Adaptive Security Policy Engine:**

*   **Input:** Contextual Risk Score, Behavioral Anomaly Flag, Network Condition Indicator, User-Defined Security Preferences (e.g., "Always require 2FA for banking").
*   **Processing:**
    *   Rule-based engine to determine security actions. Example rules:
        *   If Risk Score > 80 AND Site = Banking, require 2FA.
        *   If Network Condition = Public Wi-Fi AND Site = Email, disable auto-login.
        *   If Behavioral Anomaly Flag = True, trigger CAPTCHA.
    *   Dynamic adjustment of session cookies: shorter lifespan on risky networks.
    *   Data masking/redaction based on context (e.g., hide account numbers on public Wi-Fi).
*   **Output:** Security Action List (e.g., 2FA prompt, cookie modification, data masking).

**3.  Session Context Propagation Module:**

*   **Input:** Security Action List, Existing Session Data.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Modify session cookies/local storage with flags indicating current security context.
    *   Communicate security context to websites via custom HTTP headers (e.g., `X-Security-Context: High`).  Websites *can* optionally respect this header to further tailor their behavior.
    *   Local data encryption/decryption using keys derived from context.
*   **Output:** Modified Session Data, Encrypted/Decrypted Data.

**4.  User Interface Integration:**

*   **Visual Indicators:** Display a security context icon in the browser (e.g., green = safe, yellow = cautious, red = risky).
*   **Contextual Warnings:**  Inform the user about potential risks and suggested actions.
*   **Policy Customization:** Allow users to define their own security preferences.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Security Policy Engine):**

```
function determineSecurityActions(riskScore, anomalyFlag, networkCondition, userPreferences) {
  actions = []

  if (riskScore > 80 && site == "banking") {
    actions.push("require2FA()")
  }

  if (networkCondition == "publicWifi" && site == "email") {
    actions.push("disableAutoLogin()")
  }

  if (anomalyFlag == true) {
    actions.push("triggerCaptcha()")
  }

  // Apply user preferences
  if (userPreferences.alwaysRequire2FAForBanking) {
    actions.push("require2FA()")
  }

  return actions
}
```

This system extends the original patent by adding a layer of *dynamic* security based on real-time context, providing a significantly more robust and user-centric approach to multi-site session management. It moves beyond simply logging in/out to actively *adapting* security based on the situation.
