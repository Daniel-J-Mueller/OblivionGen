## Dynamic Resource Pre-fetching Based on Predicted User Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the consolidation optimization to *proactively* fetch consolidated resources *before* the user explicitly requests them, based on predicted interaction. This moves beyond reactive consolidation to anticipatory optimization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Interaction Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data (mouse movements, scroll position, gaze tracking, keyboard input, time spent on page sections, click patterns, historical data, contextual data (time of day, location, device)).
*   **Processing:** Employ a machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory network) trained on user behavior to predict the probability of a user interacting with specific content sections within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 2 seconds).  Model outputs a “heat map” of predicted interaction probability across the page.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of content sections with associated interaction probabilities.

**2. Resource Dependency Graph:**

*   A system-maintained graph representing the dependencies between content sections and their embedded resources (images, scripts, CSS).  This graph is built dynamically as the page is rendered.
*   Nodes represent content sections.
*   Edges represent resource dependencies.
*   Edge weights indicate resource size and loading priority (determined by CSS specificity, HTML ordering, etc.).

**3. Predictive Consolidation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Interaction prediction heatmap, resource dependency graph, current resource loading state.
*   **Processing:**
    1.  Identify content sections with high interaction probability (above a configurable threshold).
    2.  Traverse the resource dependency graph to identify the embedded resources required by those sections.
    3.  Determine optimal consolidation configurations (as per the original patent’s logic) for those resources.
    4.  Prioritize consolidation configurations based on predicted interaction probability *and* resource size (smaller, high-probability resources are prioritized).
    5.  Initiate pre-fetching of consolidated resources *before* the user interacts with the corresponding content section.
*   **Output:** A prioritized queue of pre-fetch requests for consolidated resources.

**4. Prefetching Mechanism:**

*   Utilize HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 to parallelize pre-fetch requests.
*   Implement a caching mechanism to avoid redundant pre-fetching.
*   Adjust pre-fetching aggressiveness based on network conditions and device capabilities.
*   Track pre-fetch hit rate to evaluate prediction accuracy and optimize the system.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (page is loaded) {
  interaction_heatmap = predict_user_interaction()
  resource_graph = build_resource_dependency_graph()
  prioritized_consolidation_queue = prioritize_consolidation(interaction_heatmap, resource_graph)

  for (consolidation_request in prioritized_consolidation_queue) {
    if (resource not already cached) {
      prefetch_resource(consolidation_request)
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `InteractionHeatmap`: 2D array representing interaction probability for each page region.
*   `ResourceDependencyGraph`: Adjacency list/matrix representing resource dependencies.
*   `ConsolidationRequest`:  Object containing:
    *   `resource_ids`: List of resource IDs to consolidate.
    *   `consolidation_type`: Type of consolidation (e.g., CSS sprite, bundled script).
    *   `priority`: Priority score based on prediction and size.
