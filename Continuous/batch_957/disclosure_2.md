## Dynamic Input Profile Generation & Adaptive Thresholding

**Concept:** Instead of relying solely on reference outputs from a fixed training dataset, continuously build a ‘profile’ of expected input distributions *during* runtime. This allows for adaptation to evolving input characteristics and reduces false positives/negatives stemming from dataset shift.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Runtime Input Profiler (RIP)
*   **Hardware Integration:** Implemented as a co-processor or dedicated logic within the neural network processor. Requires access to input data *before* it reaches the core computation units.
*   **Data Storage:**  A rolling buffer or probabilistic data structure (e.g., HyperLogLog) to store statistical summaries of recent inputs.  Storage capacity is configurable.
*   **Statistical Summaries:** 
    *   Mean & Standard Deviation (per input feature/channel).
    *   Quantiles (e.g., 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th percentiles).
    *   Histogram-based distribution approximation.
*   **Adaptive Threshold Calculation:** 
    *   Thresholds are *not* fixed multiples of the training dataset's standard deviation.
    *   Instead, thresholds are calculated *dynamically* based on the RIP’s statistical summaries of *recent* inputs.
    *   Formula: `Threshold = Mean + (Multiplier * DynamicStandardDeviation)` where `DynamicStandardDeviation` is derived from the RIP’s rolling buffer, and `Multiplier` is configurable.
*   **Outlier Detection:** 
    *   For each input feature, calculate the Z-score (or similar) based on the dynamically calculated mean and standard deviation.
    *   Flag as outlier if Z-score exceeds a configurable threshold.
*   **Layer-Specific Profiling:** Maintain separate profiles for each layer of the neural network, allowing adaptation to layer-specific input characteristics.
*   **Profile Update Frequency:**  Configurable.  Trade-off between responsiveness to changes and computational overhead.
*   **Profile Decay:** Implement a decay mechanism to give more weight to recent inputs, mitigating the impact of outdated data.  Exponential decay is recommended.
*   **Action Integration:** Connect the outlier detection results to the existing improper input handling mechanisms (e.g., notification, suspension of computation).

**Pseudocode (Outlier Detection within a Layer):**

```
function detect_outliers(input_data, layer_profile, multiplier, threshold):
    # input_data: Input tensor for the current layer
    # layer_profile: Statistical profile for the layer (Mean, StdDev)
    # multiplier: Configurable multiplier for standard deviation
    # threshold:  Z-score threshold

    for each feature in input_data:
        mean = layer_profile.mean[feature]
        std_dev = layer_profile.std_dev[feature]

        z_score = (feature - mean) / std_dev

        if abs(z_score) > threshold:
            mark_as_outlier(feature)  # Flag outlier

    return outlier_count()
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Hardware acceleration of statistical calculations (mean, standard deviation, quantiles).
*   Efficient memory management for the rolling buffers/probabilistic data structures.
*   Low-latency access to profile data during inference.
*   Configuration interface for adjusting parameters (multiplier, decay rate, profile update frequency).
