## Adaptive Sensor Fusion with Environmental Context

**Core Concept:** Extend inertial sensor fusion by dynamically weighting sensor data based on detected environmental factors and predicted user activity, creating a more robust and accurate orientation estimate.

**Specification:**

**1. Environmental Sensor Integration:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate data streams from the following:
    *   Barometer (altitude/atmospheric pressure)
    *   Microphone (ambient noise level, identifying specific sounds like vehicle movement)
    *   Ambient Light Sensor (illumination levels)
    *   Optional: Magnetometer (local magnetic field disturbances)
*   **Data Processing:**  Implement a module to process raw sensor data into contextual features:
    *   **Altitude/Pressure:**  Categorize environment (indoor/outdoor, stationary/moving vehicle – elevation change rate).
    *   **Noise Level:** Detect dominant noise sources (traffic, footsteps, silence) indicating movement type and environment.
    *   **Illumination:** Classify lighting conditions (bright sunlight, indoor lighting, darkness) impacting visual odometry and potential disturbances.

**2. Activity Prediction Module:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) – LSTM or GRU – on a dataset of sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, environmental sensors) labeled with user activity (walking, running, driving, stationary, etc.).
*   **Real-Time Prediction:** Utilize the trained model to predict user activity based on the current sensor data stream.  Output a probability distribution across activity classes.

**3. Adaptive Weighting Algorithm:**

*   **Weight Matrix:** Define a weight matrix where each row represents an activity class and each column corresponds to a sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope, barometer, etc.).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Based on the predicted activity probabilities, calculate a weighted average of the sensor weights. This effectively emphasizes the most relevant sensors for the current context.
    *   Example: If the predicted activity is "driving," increase the weight of the gyroscope (for accurate turn rate) and barometer (for altitude changes). Decrease the weight of the accelerometer (less reliable due to vehicle vibrations).
    *   Introduce a 'sensor jitter offset constant' for each sensor, dynamically adjusted based on the estimated noise characteristics *within the current context*.
*   **Kalman Filter Integration:**  Integrate the adaptive weighting algorithm within the Kalman filter framework of the existing inertial sensor fusion system. The adaptive weights modify the process noise covariance matrix, effectively tuning the filter's sensitivity to each sensor.

**4.  Contextual Calibration:**

*   **Automated Calibration:** Implement an automated calibration routine that triggers based on detected environmental changes.
*   **Procedure:**  When a significant environmental change is detected (e.g., transition from indoors to outdoors, start/stop of vehicle movement), the system executes a short calibration sequence. This involves collecting sensor data while the device is known to be stationary or in a well-defined orientation, and adjusting sensor biases and scales accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Weighting Algorithm within Kalman Filter):**

```
// Input: Kalman Filter State, Sensor Readings (Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Barometer),
//        Predicted Activity Probabilities, Current Sensor Weights

function adaptive_kalman_filter(kf_state, accel_reading, gyro_reading, baro_reading, activity_probs, sensor_weights) {

  // Calculate weighted average of sensor weights based on activity probabilities
  weighted_sensor_weights = calculate_weighted_average(activity_probs, sensor_weights);

  // Adjust process noise covariance matrix (Q) based on weighted sensor weights
  Q = adjust_covariance_matrix(Q, weighted_sensor_weights);

  // Apply standard Kalman Filter update step using adjusted Q
  kf_state = kalman_filter_update(kf_state, accel_reading, gyro_reading, baro_reading, Q);

  return kf_state;
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing inertial measurement unit (IMU) – accelerometer and gyroscope.
*   Barometer.
*   Ambient Light Sensor.
*   Microphone.
*   Processor capable of running the RNN and Kalman filter in real-time.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training and running the RNN.
*   Kalman filter implementation.
*   Sensor data processing and fusion algorithms.
*   Operating system and drivers for the sensors.
