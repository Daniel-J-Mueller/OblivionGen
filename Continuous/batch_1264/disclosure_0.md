## Dynamic Device ID Allocation & Behavioral Biometrics Integration

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *allowing* duplicate device IDs to actively *managing* and dynamically allocating them based on edge device behavioral biometrics, creating a 'digital fingerprint' for authentication and anomaly detection, going beyond just network access.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Creation Module:**

*   **Data Input:** Collect data streams from edge devices: radio signal strength variability, transmission frequency patterns, data packet size distributions, inter-transmission timings, CPU/memory usage (if accessible), and potentially sensor data if available (temperature, acceleration).
*   **Feature Extraction:** Employ statistical analysis and machine learning (e.g., autoencoders, recurrent neural networks) to extract key features representing the device's operational ‘signature’.  This includes statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness) of the data streams, and patterns discovered via the ML models.
*   **Profile Storage:** Store the extracted features as a behavioral profile associated with the Device ID. Profiles should be versioned to track changes over time. Encryption at rest and in transit is mandatory.

**2. Dynamic ID Allocation Engine:**

*   **ID Pool:** Maintain a pool of potentially duplicate Device IDs.
*   **Allocation Logic:** When a new device requests registration:
    *   Check for existing Device ID matches.
    *   If a match is found, initiate a behavioral biometric comparison.
    *   **Biometric Comparison:**  Real-time data streams from the new device are compared against the stored behavioral profile associated with the matching ID.
    *   **Similarity Score:** Calculate a similarity score (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) representing the degree of match.
    *   **Thresholding:**
        *   If the similarity score exceeds a defined threshold (configurable per client network), provision the new device with the existing ID.
        *   If the score falls below the threshold, assign a new, unique ID.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:**  Employ a feedback loop to adjust the similarity threshold based on network conditions, device type, and historical data.

**3. Anomaly Detection Module:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the behavioral characteristics of registered devices.
*   **Deviation Analysis:**  Detect deviations from the stored behavioral profile (e.g., using statistical process control or anomaly detection algorithms).
*   **Alerting:** Generate alerts when significant deviations are detected, potentially indicating compromised devices or malicious activity.

**4. Roaming Device Handling:**

*   **Temporary ID Assignment:** When a roaming device is detected (indicated via network signaling), assign a temporary ID derived from the original ID and a unique roaming identifier.
*   **Biometric Validation on Roaming:** Perform biometric validation using the original stored profile before granting full network access. This prevents malicious devices from spoofing roaming credentials.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION registerDevice(deviceID, dataStream):
  existingDevice = lookupDeviceByID(deviceID)

  IF existingDevice != NULL:
    similarityScore = compareDataStream(dataStream, existingDevice.behavioralProfile)

    IF similarityScore > threshold:
      //Provision device with existing ID
      addDeviceToNetwork(deviceID, dataStream)
      RETURN SUCCESS

    ELSE:
      //Assign new ID
      newID = generateUniqueID()
      addDeviceToNetwork(newID, dataStream)
      RETURN SUCCESS

  ELSE:
    //New Device
    newID = generateUniqueID()
    addDeviceToNetwork(newID, dataStream)
    saveBehavioralProfile(newID, dataStream) // store dataStream as the baseline profile
    RETURN SUCCESS

FUNCTION detectAnomaly(deviceID, currentDataStream):
  existingProfile = lookupBehavioralProfile(deviceID)
  deviationScore = calculateDeviation(currentDataStream, existingProfile)
  IF deviationScore > anomalyThreshold:
    generateAlert(deviceID, deviationScore)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge devices must be capable of providing data streams for behavioral analysis.
*   The provider network requires sufficient processing power and storage to manage behavioral profiles and perform real-time analysis.
*   Secure communication channels are essential to protect behavioral data.
