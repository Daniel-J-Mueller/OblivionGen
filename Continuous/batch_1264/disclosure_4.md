## Dynamic Persona Injection via Latent Space Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the existing latent space representation of dialog to incorporate and dynamically blend distinct “personas” into the agent’s responses. This goes beyond simple rule-based persona switching; it allows for gradual morphing between personas *during* a conversation, creating more nuanced and believable interactions.

**Specs:**

1.  **Persona Embeddings:** Create a library of pre-trained persona embeddings. Each embedding represents a distinct persona (e.g., “helpful technician,” “sarcastic friend,” “formal professor”). These embeddings are generated using a large language model trained on text representative of each persona. The dimensionality of these persona embeddings should match the dimensionality of the latent space used in the existing seq2seq model.

2.  **Persona Control Vector:** Introduce a "Persona Control Vector" (PCV) that exists alongside the standard vector obtained from the encoder/decoder. The PCV is a weighted sum of the pre-trained persona embeddings.  The weights in the PCV determine the degree to which each persona influences the agent’s response.

3.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Implement a mechanism for dynamically adjusting the weights in the PCV *during* the conversation. This can be achieved using:

    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze the user’s utterance to detect sentiment (positive, negative, neutral). Adjust the PCV weights based on the detected sentiment. For example, a negative sentiment might increase the weight of a “sympathetic” persona.
    *   **Topic Modeling:**  Identify the topics discussed in the conversation. Adjust the PCV weights based on the identified topics. For example, a technical topic might increase the weight of a “knowledgeable expert” persona.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Train an RL agent to optimize the PCV weights based on user feedback (explicit ratings or implicit signals like conversation length and user engagement). The reward function should encourage responses that lead to positive user outcomes.

4.  **Vector Fusion:**  Combine the standard vector from the encoder/decoder with the PCV *before* generating the response. This can be done using a simple element-wise addition or a more complex learned fusion mechanism (e.g., a neural network layer).

5.  **Pseudocode (Response Generation):**

    ```
    // Input: User utterance, Encoder/Decoder vector (latent_vector)
    //       Pre-trained persona embeddings (persona_embeddings)

    // 1. Analyze User Utterance (Sentiment & Topics)
    sentiment = analyze_sentiment(user_utterance)
    topics = analyze_topics(user_utterance)

    // 2. Calculate Persona Control Vector (PCV)
    pcv = calculate_pcv(persona_embeddings, sentiment, topics)

    // 3. Fuse Vectors
    fused_vector = latent_vector + pcv  // Or use a learned fusion layer

    // 4. Generate Response
    response = decode_response(fused_vector)

    return response
    ```

6.  **Training Data Augmentation:** Augment the training data by creating variations of existing dialogs with different personas. This will help the model learn to effectively blend personas and generate appropriate responses.

7.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluate the system using metrics that measure the naturalness, coherence, and appropriateness of the agent’s responses.  Also, assess the agent’s ability to adapt its persona to the user’s needs and the context of the conversation.
