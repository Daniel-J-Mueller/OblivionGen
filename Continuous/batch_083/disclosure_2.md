## Autonomous Swarm Docking & Inventory Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand the robotic capabilities beyond individual tote movement to incorporate a "swarm" of smaller, specialized robots operating *within* the barge system to perform real-time inventory adjustments, damage assessment, and pre-sortation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Robot Designation:** “Scout” Units – Approximately 15cm cubed, lightweight (under 500g).
*   **Locomotion:** Micro-suction cups *and* retractable micro-spikes for vertical/incline movement on tote surfaces and barge flooring. Internal gyroscopic stabilization.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution miniature camera (RGB + Depth).
    *   RFID reader (short-range).
    *   Weight sensor (precision to 10g).
    *   Temperature sensor.
    *   Miniature barcode scanner.
*   **Communication:** Mesh networking via ultra-wideband (UWB) radio.  Each Scout unit acts as a repeater to extend coverage across the barge and storage system.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging via inductive pads embedded in barge flooring and storage grid locations.  Battery life > 4 hours continuous operation.
*   **Deployment/Retrieval:** Dedicated “Scout Ports” integrated into the barge drive unit (the larger “first robotic drive unit” in the provided patent) and strategically located within storage levels.
*   **Software/Control:**
    *   **Swarm Algorithm:** Decentralized, behavior-based swarm intelligence.  Scout units operate autonomously but coordinate via local communication.
    *   **Task Assignment:**  Controller assigns high-level tasks (e.g., “verify inventory on barge 3,” “inspect tote 742 for damage”).
    *   **Path Planning:** Scouts navigate using a combination of pre-mapped barge/storage layouts and real-time sensor data (obstacle avoidance).
    *   **Data Fusion:** Controller aggregates data from all Scout units to create a comprehensive, real-time view of inventory status and potential issues.
    *   **Predictive Maintenance:**  Algorithm identifies totes likely to fail based on detected damage patterns.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  Controller determines a need for inventory adjustment or damage assessment on a specific barge.
2.  Controller deploys a swarm (e.g., 10-20) of Scout units from the barge drive unit’s Scout Ports.
3.  Scout units fan out across the barge, utilizing their suction cups/spikes to traverse tote surfaces and barge flooring.
4.  Each Scout unit scans tote RFID tags, verifies contents against the database, and captures visual/weight/temperature data.
5.  Scout units identify damaged or mislabeled totes. They tag the affected totes with a visual marker (e.g., a small, adhesive flag).
6.  Scout units transmit data to the controller.
7.  Controller updates the inventory database and generates reports.
8.  Controller instructs the larger robotic systems to address any identified issues (e.g., reroute damaged totes to repair stations).
9.  Once complete, Scout units return to their Scout Ports for recharging and maintenance.



**Pseudocode (Simplified Swarm Navigation):**

```
// Scout Unit Code

while (true) {

  receive task from Controller;

  if (task == "NavigateToTote") {
    targetToteID = task.toteID;
    path = findShortestPath(currentLocation, targetToteID);
    followPath(path);
  }

  if (task == "ScanTote") {
    scanRFID();
    captureImage();
    measureWeight();
    transmitData();
  }

  // Obstacle Avoidance
  if (sensorDetectsObstacle()) {
    calculateNewPath();
  }

  // Communication with other Scouts
  broadcastLocation();
  receiveNeighboringScoutLocations();
}
```
