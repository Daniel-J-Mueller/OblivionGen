## Dynamic Forum 'Ecosystems' with Sentiment-Based Branching

**Concept:** Expand the forum creation beyond search string variations to incorporate *real-time* sentiment analysis of forum posts and dynamically branch discussions into sub-forums based on prevailing emotional tones. This moves beyond keyword-driven forums to *emotionally-driven* forum ecosystems.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Sentiment Analysis Engine:**

*   **Input:** All forum posts.
*   **Processing:** Utilize a multi-layered sentiment analysis model. 
    *   Layer 1: Basic Polarity (Positive/Negative/Neutral).
    *   Layer 2: Emotion Classification (Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust). Utilize a pre-trained model fine-tuned on forum-specific language.
    *   Layer 3:  Intensity Scoring: Assign a numerical score (0-100) to each emotion, reflecting its strength in the post.
*   **Output:** A sentiment vector for each post:  `[Polarity, Joy_Intensity, Sadness_Intensity, Anger_Intensity, Fear_Intensity, Surprise_Intensity, Disgust_Intensity]`

**II. Dynamic Forum Branching Algorithm:**

1.  **Initial Forum Creation:**  Based on the original patent’s logic, a base forum is created for the search string (or keyword).
2.  **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor new posts within the base forum.
3.  **Sentiment Thresholds:** Define thresholds for each emotion (e.g., Anger > 70, Joy > 80).
4.  **Branch Creation Trigger:** If a post’s sentiment vector exceeds *any* of the defined thresholds:
    *   A new sub-forum is automatically created. 
    *   The sub-forum title is dynamically generated:
        *   If Anger > Threshold:  "Discussion: [Original Search String] - Concerns & Issues"
        *   If Joy > Threshold: "Discussion: [Original Search String] - Positive Experiences"
        *   Etc.
    *   The triggering post is automatically moved to the newly created sub-forum.
5.  **Post Routing:** New posts are *automatically routed* to the most appropriate sub-forum based on their sentiment vector. 
    *   A simple algorithm: Calculate the Euclidean distance between the post’s sentiment vector and the ‘centroid’ (average sentiment vector) of each sub-forum. Route the post to the sub-forum with the closest centroid.
6.  **Centroid Recalculation:**  Periodically (e.g., every hour) recalculate the centroid of each sub-forum based on the accumulated sentiment of all posts within that sub-forum. This allows the forum ecosystem to adapt to changing discussion trends.

**III.  User Interface Integration:**

*   **Forum Visualization:** Display the forum ecosystem as a ‘sentiment map’ – a visual representation of the sub-forums, color-coded by the dominant emotion (e.g., Red = Anger, Green = Joy, Blue = Sadness).
*   **Sentiment Filters:** Allow users to filter posts by emotion (e.g., "Show me only posts with high levels of Joy").
*   **Emotion-Based Sorting:** Allow users to sort posts within a sub-forum by emotion intensity.

**IV. Technical Specifications:**

*   **Programming Languages:** Python (for sentiment analysis and backend logic), JavaScript (for UI integration).
*   **Sentiment Analysis Libraries:** Transformers (Hugging Face), NLTK, spaCy.
*   **Database:**  NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) to efficiently store sentiment vectors and forum data.
*   **API:** REST API for communication between the backend and the UI.
