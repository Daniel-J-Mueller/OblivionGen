## Adaptive Environmental Storytelling via Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the activity prediction concept by building a dynamic "environmental story" within a space, influencing device behavior not just on probability, but on inferred emotional state and narrative context. It’s about creating a responsive environment that feels *aware* and anticipates needs beyond simple functionality.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Sensor Array:**  Beyond audio (as in the provided patent), integrate:
    *   **Low-Resolution Visual Sensors:** (e.g., depth cameras, thermal cameras) – Detect presence, movement patterns, and potentially emotional cues (e.g., facial expressions, body language - processed locally for privacy).
    *   **Air Quality Sensors:** Detect changes in VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) – could indicate cooking, cleaning, or even stress levels (e.g., increased CO2).
    *   **Wearable Integration (Optional):**  Allow users to opt-in to share biometric data (heart rate, skin conductance) for more accurate emotional state analysis. *Privacy is paramount – data must be anonymized and user-controlled.*

2.  **Contextual Inference Engine:** This is the core of the system. It fuses data from all sensors using a Bayesian Network. This network models relationships between sensor data, user activity, and inferred emotional state.

    *   **State Variables:**
        *   `Activity`: (Cooking, Relaxing, Working, Entertaining, etc.)
        *   `EmotionalState`: (Happy, Sad, Stressed, Focused, Bored, etc.) – Categorical with confidence levels.
        *   `NarrativeContext`: (MorningRoutine, DinnerPreparation, MovieNight, etc.) – Derived from time of day, activity patterns, and potentially user calendar integration.

    *   **Bayesian Network Structure:** The network will define conditional probabilities.  For example:
        *   `P(EmotionalState = Stressed | Activity = Working, AirQuality = Poor)`
        *   `P(Activity = Cooking | Sound = Sizzling, Visual = MovementNearStove)`
        *   `P(NarrativeContext = DinnerPreparation | TimeOfDay = Evening, Activity = Cooking)`

3.  **Device Orchestration Engine:**  This engine translates inferred context into device commands. The goal isn’t just to react, but to *proactively* shape the environment.

**Pseudocode for Device Orchestration:**

```
function orchestrate(activity, emotionalState, narrativeContext):
  if narrativeContext == "MovieNight":
    dimLights()
    adjustTemperature(comfortLevel)
    activateSurroundSound()
  else if emotionalState == "Stressed":
    playCalmingMusic()
    activateAromatherapy(lavender)
    adjustLighting(warmColorTemperature)
  else if activity == "Cooking" and emotionalState == "Happy":
    playUpbeatMusic()
    adjustLighting(brightColorTemperature)
    offerRecipeSuggestions(basedOnIngredients)
  else if activity == "Working" and emotionalState == "Focused":
    minimizeDistractions()
    adjustTemperature(optimalForConcentration)
  else:
    // Default behavior: maintain comfortable environment
    maintainComfortLevels()
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Emotional State Integration:** Moves beyond activity prediction to understand *how* a user is feeling, allowing for more empathetic and personalized responses.
*   **Narrative Context Awareness:**  Recognizes broader situations to create richer and more immersive experiences.
*   **Proactive Environment Shaping:**  Doesn't just react to events, but anticipates needs and proactively adjusts the environment.
*   **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Combines data from a wide range of sensors to build a more complete and accurate picture of the environment and user state.
