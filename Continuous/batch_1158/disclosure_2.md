**Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Panoramic Image Exploration**

**Concept:** Expand the motion-based image viewing beyond visual adjustments to include localized haptic feedback. The system aims to provide a more immersive and intuitive experience, particularly for detailed panoramic images or 3D environments represented within the panorama.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Device with orientation sensors (gyroscope, accelerometer, compass) – as per the existing patent.
    *   Integrated array of micro-actuators embedded in the device’s casing or a dedicated accessory (glove, stylus). Actuator density: minimum 50 actuators per 10cm². Each actuator capable of independent, localized vibration/pressure.
    *   High-resolution depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or Stereo Vision) to create a rudimentary 3D map of the panoramic image content. (Optional, but recommended for enhanced realism).
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Panoramic Data Processing:**  The system receives the panoramic image data.
    2.  **Depth Map Generation:** (If depth sensor is present) Generate a depth map of the panoramic image. If no depth sensor, assign pseudo-depth based on image features (e.g., texture density, color gradients) and a pre-defined algorithm.
    3.  **Orientation Data Acquisition:** Continuously monitor device orientation (rotation, tilt) using integrated sensors.
    4.  **Image-to-Haptic Mapping:**  This is the core algorithm:
        *   Based on the device’s orientation, determine the ‘visible’ portion of the panoramic image.
        *   For each visible element (object, texture) within the visible portion, calculate the corresponding location on the device’s surface where haptic feedback should be applied. This calculation considers the depth of the element.  Elements further away receive less intense feedback.
        *   Feedback intensity modulated by element size, texture, and calculated distance.
        *   Smooth transitions between haptic feedback zones as the user rotates/tilts the device.
    5.  **Haptic Actuation:** Send signals to the micro-actuator array to create localized vibrations/pressure corresponding to the calculated haptic map.
    6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Adjust haptic feedback intensity and patterns based on user interaction (e.g., faster rotation = increased intensity, 'tapping' on the screen = highlight the corresponding haptic zone).
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (device_active) {
  orientation_data = get_orientation_data();
  visible_region = calculate_visible_region(orientation_data, panoramic_image);
  depth_map = generate_depth_map(visible_region); // Or use pseudo-depth algorithm

  for (each element in visible_region) {
    distance = depth_map[element];
    intensity = calculate_haptic_intensity(element, distance);

    haptic_location = map_element_to_actuator(element);
    actuate(haptic_location, intensity);
  }

  delay(frame_rate);
}
```

*   **Refinements:**
    *   **Material Simulation:**  Different materials within the panorama could trigger different haptic feedback patterns (e.g., rough texture = rapid, irregular vibration; smooth surface = gentle, sustained pressure).
    *   **Multi-User Haptics:** Expand the system to multiple users, allowing them to 'feel' the same panoramic environment simultaneously.
    *   **Haptic Navigation:** Use haptic feedback as a navigational aid, guiding the user to points of interest within the panorama.
    *   **Augmented Reality Integration**: Blend haptic feedback with visual AR overlays, enhancing the immersive experience.
