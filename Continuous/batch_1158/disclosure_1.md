## Query Block Provenance & Dynamic Hint Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the hint system to track the *origin* of query blocks and propagate hints dynamically based on provenance, allowing for more granular and automated optimization. This moves beyond static hint application to a system that *learns* how hints impact different query block lineages.

**Specification:**

**1. Provenance Metadata:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Each query block will have an associated `Provenance` object.
    ```
    class Provenance {
        String creator; // Identifier of the system/user that created the block (e.g., UI, automated query generator, another query block)
        int creationTimestamp;
        String originalQuery; // The source query that led to this block's creation (if applicable)
        List<Provenance> dependencies; // List of Provenance objects of blocks this block depends on.
        int blockId; //Unique identifier of the block
    }
    ```
*   **Integration:**  The query parser/optimizer will automatically populate the `Provenance` object for each query block during query decomposition.

**2. Dynamic Hint Propagation Rules:**

*   **Rule Definition:** A central repository (e.g., a database table, configuration file) will store dynamic hint propagation rules. Each rule will define:
    *   `creatorMatch`:  A pattern to match the `creator` field of a `Provenance` object.
    *   `hint`: The hint to apply.
    *   `propagationType`:  An enum indicating how the hint propagates (e.g., `ALL_DEPENDENTS`, `TOP_LEVEL_ONLY`, `LIMITED_DEPTH`).
    *   `condition`: Optional condition to evaluate before applying the hint.
*   **Propagation Engine:** A separate component that:
    1.  Traverses the query block tree.
    2.  For each block, retrieves applicable propagation rules based on the block's `Provenance`.
    3.  Applies the hints defined in the rules, respecting the `propagationType`.

**3.  Hint Overrides & Conflict Resolution:**

*   **Priority System:**  Establish a priority system for hints.  Explicitly defined hints (via the existing hint specification interface) will always override dynamically propagated hints.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Define rules for resolving conflicts when multiple propagation rules apply to the same query block. (e.g., last rule wins, specific rule takes precedence).

**4. Learning & Adaptation (AI integration - optional):**

*   **Performance Monitoring:**  Track the performance impact of dynamically applied hints.
*   **Rule Optimization:**  Use machine learning to optimize the propagation rules based on performance data. (e.g., Reinforcement Learning to learn optimal rule sets).



**Pseudocode Example (Propagation Engine):**

```
function propagateHints(queryBlock, ruleRepository):
  if queryBlock is null:
    return

  applicableRules = ruleRepository.getRules(queryBlock.provenance.creator)

  for rule in applicableRules:
    if rule.condition is null or evaluateCondition(rule.condition, queryBlock):
      applyHint(queryBlock, rule.hint)

      if rule.propagationType == "ALL_DEPENDENTS":
        for dependentBlock in queryBlock.dependencies:
          propagateHints(dependentBlock, ruleRepository)
      elif rule.propagationType == "LIMITED_DEPTH":
          // Apply to a certain depth of dependencies
          // Recursive depth-limited propagation

  //Propagate to dependencies if applicable

```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Optimize Queries Generated by Specific UI Components:** Apply hints tailored to queries originating from a particular UI element.
*   **Improve Performance of Automated Queries:**  Automatically tune queries generated by a scheduling system.
*   **Adapt to Data Distribution Changes:** Dynamically adjust hints based on data statistics.
