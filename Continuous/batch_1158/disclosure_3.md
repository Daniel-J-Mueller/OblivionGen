## Adaptive Log Granularity & Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** Implement a system capable of dynamically adjusting log entry granularity based on object modification patterns, coupled with a predictive prefetching mechanism for anticipating future object state requirements.

**Core Concept:** The provided patent focuses on log-structured storage with combined records. This inspires a system that *learns* how frequently different parts of an object change. Instead of a fixed granularity of logging, we adapt. Objects are conceptually divided into granular 'blocks'.  The system monitors modification frequencies for each block. Frequently changing blocks are logged with high granularity (detailed changes), while rarely changing blocks are logged at a coarser granularity (summarized changes, or even omitted from individual logs). 

**Components:**

1.  **Object Block Manager:** Responsible for dividing objects into logical blocks. Block size is configurable and potentially adaptable based on object type and observed modification patterns.

2.  **Modification Frequency Monitor:** Tracks the rate of change for each block over a sliding time window. Utilizes a decay factor to prioritize recent changes.

3.  **Dynamic Log Granularity Controller:**  Based on the modification frequency, this component determines the logging granularity for each block. 

    *   **High Frequency:** Full change details are logged.
    *   **Medium Frequency:** Differential changes are logged (deltas from a previous version).
    *   **Low Frequency:**  Summarized changes are logged (metadata about changes, but not the data itself). Alternatively, the block is excluded from the log entirely with the assumption that a full object restore can be performed from other sources (replication, snapshots).

4. **Predictive Prefetcher**: Based on access patterns and change histories, predicts which object blocks will be required in the near future and preemptively fetches/reconstructs them into memory or a faster storage tier.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Log Granularity Controller):**

```
function determineLogGranularity(blockID, frequencyData):
  if frequencyData.recentChangeCount > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    return GRANULARITY_FULL
  else if frequencyData.recentChangeCount > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    return GRANULARITY_DIFFERENTIAL
  else if frequencyData.recentChangeCount > LOW_THRESHOLD:
    return GRANULARITY_SUMMARY
  else:
    return GRANULARITY_NONE
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `BlockMetadata`: {`blockID`: integer, `recentChangeCount`: integer, `lastModifiedTimestamp`: timestamp}
*   `LogEntry`: {`blockID`: integer, `granularity`: enum, `changeData`: byte array}

**Interaction with Existing System:**

This system integrates with the existing log-structured storage by acting as a pre-processor for log entry creation.  The Dynamic Log Granularity Controller determines the appropriate granularity before the change data is written to the log.

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced Log Size:  Logging only the necessary details minimizes storage requirements.
*   Improved Performance:  Less data to write to the log improves write performance. Prefetching anticipates needs and reduces read latency.
*   Adaptive Behavior: The system automatically adjusts to changing workload patterns.
*   Scalability: Reduced log size improves scalability.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Machine Learning: Utilize machine learning to predict modification frequencies with greater accuracy.
*   Tiered Storage:  Store frequently accessed blocks in faster storage tiers.
*   Compression:  Apply compression techniques to reduce log size further.
*   Cross-Object Dependency Analysis: Analyze dependencies between objects to optimize prefetching and replication.
