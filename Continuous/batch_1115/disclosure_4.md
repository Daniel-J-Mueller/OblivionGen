## Modular Electrostatic Pre-Filter Array

**Concept:** A pre-filter system employing an array of individually addressable electrostatic charging plates positioned *before* the primary filter media. This system dynamically adjusts electrostatic attraction based on real-time particle detection, maximizing capture efficiency and extending the lifespan of the main filter.

**Specifications:**

*   **Array Configuration:** A grid of micro-fabricated electrostatic plates (ESP) arranged in a honeycomb structure. Plate dimensions: 5mm x 5mm x 1mm. Plate material: Aluminum nitride with a thin dielectric coating. Grid size: scalable, modular, configurable to room dimensions.
*   **Particle Detection:** Integrated optical particle counters (OPC) positioned *before* and *within* the ESP array. OPCs measure particle size and concentration in real-time. Resolution: 0.3 microns â€“ 10 microns. Sampling rate: 10Hz.
*   **Voltage Control System:** Each ESP is connected to an individual high-voltage power supply (0-10kV DC). A microcontroller manages the voltage applied to each plate based on OPC readings. Control Algorithm: Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control loop optimizing for particle capture and minimizing energy consumption.
*   **Zoning & Mapping:** The array is divided into zones (e.g., 10cm x 10cm). Data from OPCs within each zone is used to create a particle density map. The voltage applied to ESPs in high-density areas is increased, while voltage in low-density areas is decreased.
*   **Self-Cleaning Mechanism:** Periodic reversal of polarity on ESPs to dislodge accumulated particles. Frequency: Adjustable based on particle load. Duration: 10ms pulse.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wireless communication (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) for remote monitoring and control. Data logging of particle counts, voltage levels, and system performance.
*   **Power Requirements:** 24V DC, 5A (scalable with array size).
*   **Materials:** Lightweight, durable polymer housing. Electrostatic plates constructed from aluminum nitride for high thermal conductivity.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
// Initialize variables
float particleDensity[GRID_SIZE];
float voltage[GRID_SIZE];
float error;
float integral;
float derivative;
float Kp = 0.5; // Proportional gain
float Ki = 0.1; // Integral gain
float Kd = 0.2; // Derivative gain

// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Read particle density from OPCs
    for (int i = 0; i < GRID_SIZE; i++) {
        particleDensity[i] = readOPC(i);
    }

    // Calculate error
    error = particleDensity[i];

    // Calculate integral
    integral += error;

    // Calculate derivative
    derivative = error - previousError;

    // Calculate control signal
    controlSignal = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative;

    // Apply voltage to ESP
    voltage[i] = constrain(controlSignal, 0, 10);

    // Save previous error
    previousError = error;

    // Delay
    delay(100ms);
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond passive filtration by actively *attracting* and capturing particles, significantly improving efficiency and reducing the load on subsequent filter stages. The dynamic zoning and mapping capabilities allow for targeted particle removal, optimizing performance and minimizing energy consumption. The self-cleaning mechanism ensures long-term reliability and reduces maintenance requirements.
