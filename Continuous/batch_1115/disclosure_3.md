## Dynamic Spectrum Allocation via Swarm-Based Drone Network

**System Overview:**

A network of autonomous drones equipped with DFS-capable radios, acting as a distributed, mobile DFS server and relay network. This system dynamically maps radar signatures and allocates DFS channels in real-time, creating localized “safe” spectrum zones. It’s designed for rapidly changing environments (e.g., disaster relief, temporary events) where fixed infrastructure DFS solutions are impractical or insufficient.

**Drone Specifications:**

*   **Radio:** 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) with DFS support, programmable frequency hopping.
*   **Radar Sensor:** Millimeter-wave radar module for independent radar detection & signature analysis.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge TPU/Neural Engine for real-time spectrum analysis & machine learning.
*   **Communication:** Mesh networking capability (e.g., 802.11s) for drone-to-drone communication. Long range communication (e.g., 5G/satellite) for data uplink.
*   **Power:** High-density battery with rapid charging capability (wireless charging pads at base stations).
*   **Flight Control:** Autonomous flight with obstacle avoidance and geofencing.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Distributed DFS Server (DDSS):** Each drone runs a simplified DDSS instance responsible for local channel assessment & allocation.
2.  **Swarm Intelligence Algorithm:** A modified Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. Each drone represents a "particle" exploring the frequency spectrum.
    *   **Fitness Function:** Based on minimizing radar interference, maximizing channel bandwidth, and optimizing network connectivity.
    *   **Communication:** Drones share “best channel” data with neighbors, influencing each other's search patterns.
    *   **Leader Election:** A designated “leader” drone manages channel assignments to optimize global spectrum usage.
3.  **Radar Signature Database:** A cloud-based database for storing and analyzing radar signatures. Drones upload signature data to improve overall system accuracy.
4.  **User Interface:** A web-based dashboard for monitoring spectrum availability, drone locations, and network performance.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Deployment:** A swarm of drones is deployed to the target area.
2.  **Initial Scan:** Each drone performs a local DFS scan on available channels using its onboard radio and radar sensor.
3.  **Swarm Optimization:** The PSO algorithm guides the drones to explore the frequency spectrum, sharing data and optimizing channel allocation.
4.  **Dynamic Allocation:** The "leader" drone assigns optimal DFS channels to nearby devices (e.g., temporary Wi-Fi hotspots, emergency communication systems).
5.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Drones continuously monitor radar activity and adjust channel assignments in real-time to avoid interference.
6. **Beaconing:** Drones broadcast beacon signals containing allocated DFS channel information and RSSI values to client devices.

**Pseudocode (Channel Allocation):**

```
// Drone-side code
for each channel in available_channels:
  perform_cac(channel)
  if no_radar_detected:
    calculate_channel_quality(channel) // Based on interference, bandwidth
    update_swarm_knowledge(channel_quality, channel)
    
// Leader Drone Code
channels_data = collect_data_from_swarm()
best_channels = select_best_channels(channels_data) // Based on optimization criteria
assign_channels_to_devices(best_channels)
broadcast_channel_assignments()
```

**Novelty:** This system doesn't simply replicate existing DFS systems in a mobile form factor. It leverages swarm intelligence to perform *distributed* DFS, dramatically increasing the speed and accuracy of spectrum assessment in dynamic environments. The system effectively *creates* safe spectrum zones through active monitoring and adaptive channel allocation, rather than relying on static maps or pre-defined rules.
