## Adaptive Archival Granularity

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on archiving operation records. This builds on that by introducing *adaptive granularity* in what gets archived â€“ moving beyond just individual operation records to archive aggregated 'snapshots' of data state, triggered by predictive modeling of data access patterns. This lowers storage costs and dramatically speeds up restores/queries.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Access Model:**

*   **Input:** Historical data access logs (reads, writes, updates). Data store schema. Data object relationships.
*   **Process:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future data access frequency for each data object/key space. Incorporate seasonality (daily, weekly, monthly) and trend analysis.  The model outputs a "Access Score" for each object.
*   **Output:** Access Score per data object, updated at configurable intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).

**2. Adaptive Archival Trigger:**

*   **Thresholds:** Define configurable thresholds for the Access Score. (e.g. High Access: Score > 80, Medium Access: 40-80, Low Access: <40).
*   **Archival Policy:**
    *   **Low Access:** Trigger a full snapshot archive of associated data objects *and* a compaction of recent operation logs related to those objects.
    *   **Medium Access:** Trigger incremental archival of operation logs (e.g., archive logs older than X days)
    *   **High Access:** No automatic archival. Monitor continuously.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The thresholds are themselves dynamically adjusted based on overall system load and storage capacity.

**3. Snapshot Creation & Compaction:**

*   **Consistent Snapshot:** Utilize data store's native snapshotting capabilities to create a consistent point-in-time view of the data.
*   **Differential Archival:** Only archive changes *since* the last snapshot.
*   **Log Compaction:** Combine multiple operation records affecting the same data object into a single "delta" record for archival. This drastically reduces archive size.

**4. Restore/Query Mechanism:**

*   **Intelligent Tiering:** Archive data is stored in tiered storage (e.g., fast SSD, slower HDD, cloud storage) based on Access Score.
*   **Restore from Snapshot:** For large-scale restores, restore directly from the most recent snapshot.
*   **Apply Delta Logs:** Apply archived delta logs to the snapshot to bring the data up to the desired point in time.
*   **Direct Delta Access:** For small-scale queries, access archived delta logs directly without restoring the full snapshot.

**Pseudocode (Archival Trigger):**

```
function trigger_archival(data_object, access_score):
  if access_score < LOW_ACCESS_THRESHOLD:
    create_full_snapshot(data_object)
    compact_operation_logs(data_object)
    archive_snapshot_and_logs(data_object)
  elif access_score < MEDIUM_ACCESS_THRESHOLD:
    archive_old_operation_logs(data_object, age=X_DAYS)
  else:
    monitor_access_pattern(data_object)

```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AccessScoreTable`: Key: `data_object_id`, Value: `access_score` (updated by Predictive Access Model)
*   `ArchivalPolicy`: Configuration parameters (thresholds, age, storage tiers)
*   `DeltaLog`:  Data structure for compacted operation records.
