## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leverage the multi-device audio capture system to create a real-time, dynamic acoustic scene reconstruction, not just for voice capture, but for environmental awareness and augmented reality applications.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing earbud system (primary & secondary) with existing microphone arrays.
    *   Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in each earbud – 6DoF (3-axis accelerometer & gyroscope) for head/ear tracking.
    *   Edge processing capability within the primary earbud for preliminary data processing.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**

    1.  **Spatial Audio Mapping:**
        *   Utilize beamforming techniques with the combined microphone data from both earbuds to identify sound sources in 3D space.
        *   IMU data is fused with audio data to account for head movement and refine the spatial positioning of sound sources.  The system estimates the location and relative intensity of distinct sounds.
        *   Create a point cloud representation of the acoustic environment – a dynamic 3D map of sound sources.

    2.  **Semantic Sound Classification:**
        *   Employ machine learning models (trained on a diverse dataset) to classify identified sound sources. Categories: speech, traffic, music, environmental sounds (birds, wind, rain), specific object sounds (e.g., a door closing, a car horn).
        *   Semantic labels are assigned to each sound source in the acoustic scene map.

    3.  **Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Rendering:**
        *   Based on the 3D acoustic map and semantic labels, the system reconstructs a simplified "acoustic scene graph."
        *   This graph represents the spatial relationships between sound sources and allows for real-time rendering of the acoustic environment.

    4.  **Augmented Reality Integration:**
        *   The reconstructed acoustic scene can be overlaid onto a visual AR display (e.g., AR glasses, smartphone screen).
        *   Visual cues can be used to highlight specific sound sources or provide contextual information. For example, highlighting traffic sounds while navigating a city street.
        *   AR display visual elements should react to changes within the reconstructed scene.

*   **Pseudocode (Primary Earbud – Scene Reconstruction Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    // Capture Audio Data (Primary & Secondary Earbuds)
    audio_primary = capture_audio(primary_earbud)
    audio_secondary = capture_audio(secondary_earbud)

    // Capture IMU Data (Primary & Secondary Earbuds)
    imu_primary = capture_imu(primary_earbud)
    imu_secondary = capture_imu(secondary_earbud)

    // Beamforming & Source Localization
    sound_sources = localize_sound_sources(audio_primary, audio_secondary, imu_primary, imu_secondary)

    // Semantic Classification
    FOR EACH source IN sound_sources:
        source.label = classify_sound(source.audio)

    // Update Acoustic Scene Graph
    acoustic_scene_graph = update_scene_graph(sound_sources)

    // Transmit Scene Data (to AR device)
    transmit_data(acoustic_scene_graph)
ENDLOOP
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   **Enhanced Navigation:** Real-time auditory map of surroundings, highlighting points of interest or potential hazards.
    *   **Accessibility:** Providing richer auditory information for visually impaired users.
    *   **Gaming & Entertainment:** Creating immersive and realistic soundscapes.
    *   **Security & Surveillance:** Identifying and localizing sounds of interest (e.g., breaking glass, gunshots).
    *   **Environmental Monitoring:** Mapping sound pollution levels and identifying noise sources.
