## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Keyword Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the keyword detection system to create dynamic “acoustic zones” around a user and personalize keyword responses based on zone and user profile. This moves beyond simply *disabling* detection to proactively tailoring the system’s behavior based on context.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, ideally 6-8) integrated into the local device (e.g., smart speaker, headset).
    *   Low-latency processing unit capable of real-time audio analysis and zone determination.
    *   Optional:  Directional speaker array for localized audio output.

*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Zone Determination Module:**
        *   Utilizes microphone array data to pinpoint the user’s location within a defined space.
        *   Implements beamforming and source localization algorithms.
        *   Defines pre-set acoustic zones (e.g., "Personal Zone" - within 1 meter, "Conversation Zone" - 1-3 meters, "Broadcast Zone" - beyond 3 meters).
        *   Dynamically adjusts zone boundaries based on movement tracking (using optional camera/IMU data).
    *   **User Profile Manager:**
        *   Stores user-specific preferences:
            *   Preferred keywords/commands.
            *   Keyword sensitivity levels (per zone).
            *   Authorized/blocked keywords (per zone).
            *   Associated actions for each keyword.
        *   Supports multiple user profiles.
    *   **Adaptive Keyword Engine:**
        *   Receives audio data from microphone array.
        *   Determines user location and associated zone.
        *   Loads the appropriate user profile.
        *   Filters keywords based on zone and profile settings.
        *   Executes associated actions for detected keywords.
        *   Implements a "keyword veto" system:  allowing the user to explicitly reject a keyword interpretation.
    *   **Contextual Awareness Module:**
        *   Integrates data from other sensors (e.g., cameras, accelerometers, calendar) to refine contextual understanding.
        *   Example:  If a user is identified as being in a video conference (camera input), the system prioritizes voice commands relevant to the conference.

*   **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    // Main Loop
    while (true) {
      audioData = captureAudio();
      userZone = determineUserZone(audioData);
      userProfile = loadUserProfile(userZone);

      filteredKeywords = filterKeywords(audioData, userProfile);

      for (keyword in filteredKeywords) {
        action = userProfile.getAction(keyword);
        executeAction(action);
      }
    }

    //Function: determineUserZone(audioData)
    //Beamforming to identify the source of the audio signal.
    //Calculate user position based on signal arrival times at each microphone.
    //Assign user to the corresponding acoustic zone.
    //Return zone identifier

    //Function: filterKeywords(audioData, userProfile)
    //Recognize keywords using ASR (automatic speech recognition).
    //Check user profile for keyword sensitivity and blocking.
    //Return filtered list of keywords

    ```

*   **Innovation:** This system moves beyond simply avoiding false positives (disabling detection) to creating a proactive and personalized audio experience. The adaptive nature allows for dynamic adjustment of keyword sensitivity and functionality, tailored to the user's environment and preferences. The contextual awareness module further enhances the system's ability to understand and respond to the user's intent.
