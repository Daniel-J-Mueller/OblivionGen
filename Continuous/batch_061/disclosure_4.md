## Bistable Oscillator Array for True Randomness Amplification

**Concept:** Leverage a dense array of bistable cells (like those described in the provided patent) not as direct random number generators, but as chaotic oscillators.  The key is to *intentionally* introduce asymmetry and coupling between cells to create complex, unpredictable behavior.  Then, extract randomness not from individual cell outputs, but from the *collective* state of the array.

**Specifications:**

*   **Array Size:** 1024 bistable cells minimum. Scalable to 65536+ for increased entropy.
*   **Cell Architecture:** Based on the patent’s design, but with adjustable inverter strengths *within each cell*.  Each cell will have a digitally controlled resistor network (DCRN) in series with the inverters, altering their switching speed. Resolution of the DCRN: 256 steps.
*   **Inter-Cell Coupling:** Each cell is connected to its immediate neighbors (North, South, East, West – toroidal topology) via tunable capacitors. Capacitance range: 1pF – 100pF. Control: Digital, 12-bit resolution.
*   **Bias Control:** Global bias voltage applied to the entire array, adjustable from 0V – 3.3V.
*   **Readout Mechanism:** Dedicated readout circuitry for each cell.  Not simply a direct logic output. Instead, measure the *rate of oscillation* within each cell, using a high-precision timer/counter.
*   **Entropy Extraction:**  A dedicated processing unit (FPGA or ASIC) performs the following:
    1.  Collect oscillation rates from all cells.
    2.  Calculate the statistical variance of the oscillation rates.
    3.  Use the variance as a measure of entropy.
    4.  Generate a random number stream by quantizing the variance over time.  High variance = high entropy.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** The array’s coupling capacitance and cell bias are dynamically adjusted (using a microcontroller) based on a feedback loop that monitors the entropy rate.  The goal is to maximize the array’s unpredictability and maintain a consistent entropy output.
*   **Power Management:** Each cell has an individual power switch, allowing the system to selectively power on/off cells to reduce power consumption.
*   **Interface:** High-speed serial interface (e.g., PCIe) for transferring random number streams to a host computer.

**Pseudocode (Entropy Extraction):**

```
// Initialize array of oscillation rates (one per cell)
float oscillationRates[ARRAY_SIZE];

// Main loop
while (true) {

    // Measure oscillation rate for each cell
    for (int i = 0; i < ARRAY_SIZE; i++) {
        oscillationRates[i] = measureOscillationRate(cell[i]);
    }

    // Calculate the mean oscillation rate
    float meanRate = calculateMean(oscillationRates);

    // Calculate the standard deviation (variance)
    float stdDev = calculateStandardDeviation(oscillationRates, meanRate);

    // Quantize the standard deviation to generate a random number
    // (e.g., use an ADC to convert the standard deviation to a digital value)
    int randomNumber = quantize(stdDev);

    // Output the random number
    outputRandomNumber(randomNumber);

    // Dynamically adjust coupling/bias based on entropy rate (optional)
    adjustArrayParameters(stdDev);
}
```

**Novelty:** This isn’t simply using bistable cells as basic random number generators. It's creating a complex, coupled system designed for *chaotic* behavior. The entropy isn’t directly extracted from individual cells, but from the collective state of the array, leveraging the principles of dynamical systems.  This approach could potentially yield higher entropy rates and more unpredictable random number streams. The dynamic reconfiguration loop adds an adaptive element, optimizing the system for maximum randomness.
