## Dynamic Resource Mapping & Predictive Console Adjustment

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple search results *display* within the management console to proactively *adjust* the console's layout and highlighted resources *based on predictive analysis of the search query*. Instead of just showing *where* a resource is, the system anticipates *what* the user will likely do next and prepares the console accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Predictive Engine:** A machine learning model trained on user interaction data (search history, console navigation patterns, resource access frequency) to predict the user's intent based on partial or complete search queries.
*   **Dynamic Console Layout:** The management console is rendered as a series of configurable "tiles" or "panels." The predictive engine determines which tiles are most relevant to the likely user intent and adjusts their size, position, and highlighted elements accordingly.
*   **Resource Highlighting:** Within the dynamically adjusted console layout, specific resources (instances, databases, security groups, etc.) are visually highlighted (e.g., color change, bolding, animated icon) based on the predictive engineâ€™s assessment of their relevance to the search query.
*   **Proactive Data Fetching:**  Before the user even selects a resource, the system proactively fetches relevant data for the likely target resources and displays it in a preview panel within the adjusted console layout.  This reduces latency and speeds up common tasks.
*   **"Focus Mode":** Based on high-confidence predictions, the system can automatically enter a "Focus Mode" that hides all irrelevant console elements and presents only the predicted target resources and associated controls.
*    **Query Refinement Prompts**: When the system cannot confidently predict the user's intent, display a set of refinement prompts with suggested search terms or console actions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function handleSearchQuery(query) {
  prediction = predictiveEngine.predictIntent(query);

  if (prediction.confidence > threshold) {
    consoleLayout = dynamicLayoutManager.adjustLayout(prediction.relevantTiles);
    highlightedResources = prediction.highlightedResources;
    prefetchData(highlightedResources);
    enterFocusMode(highlightedResources);
  } else {
    displayRefinementPrompts(query);
  }
}

function prefetchData(resources) {
  for (resource in resources) {
    fetchResourceData(resource);
    displayResourceData(resource);
  }
}

function displayResourceData(resource) {
   // Display data in preview panel
}

function enterFocusMode(resources) {
   // Hide irrelevant elements
   // Show resources
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Console Tile:**  JSON object defining the size, position, and content of a console panel.
*   **Resource Metadata:** JSON object containing information about a cloud resource (name, type, status, tags, etc.).
*   **Prediction Object:** JSON object containing the predicted user intent, confidence score, list of relevant console tiles, and list of highlighted resources.

**Novelty:**

Existing search systems react to user input. This system *anticipates* it, fundamentally changing the interaction paradigm from reactive search to proactive assistance. It moves beyond simply *finding* resources to *preparing* the environment for their use. This has the potential to dramatically improve user productivity and reduce cognitive load.
