## Dynamic Dependency Inference via Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the tagging and visualization system to *infer* dependencies based on observed runtime behavior, rather than relying solely on static configuration or metadata. This creates a living, breathing architecture diagram that reflects actual system operation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Probe Deployment:**

*   **Component:** `RuntimeObserver`.
*   **Function:**  A lightweight agent deployed alongside each resource (VM, container, function, etc.).
*   **Data Collection:**  Monitors network traffic (ingress/egress), system calls (file access, API calls), and resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O).  Data is timestamped and associated with the resource ID.
*   **Filtering:** Configurable filters to reduce noise (e.g., ignore heartbeat signals).
*   **Output:** Streams aggregated behavioral data to a central `BehavioralAnalysisEngine`.

**2. Behavioral Analysis Engine:**

*   **Component:** `BehavioralAnalysisEngine`.
*   **Input:** Streams of behavioral data from `RuntimeObserver` agents.
*   **Analysis Techniques:**
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Identify resources that consistently interact with each other within defined time windows.  Strength of correlation determines dependency weight.
    *   **Causality Inference:** Employ time-series analysis (e.g., Granger causality) to identify potential causal relationships between resources. (Resource A's behavior *predicts* Resource B's behavior).
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Flag unusual interactions or behavior patterns that may indicate dependencies not captured by static configuration.
*   **Dependency Database:**  Maintains a dynamic dependency graph. Edges represent dependencies, weighted by strength/confidence derived from analysis.
*   **Tag Generation:** Automatically generates tags based on inferred dependencies. Tag Key: `inferred_dependency`. Tag Value: Target Resource ID, Dependency Strength (0-1).

**3. Visualization Integration:**

*   **Diagram Update:** The existing visualization system subscribes to updates from the Dependency Database.
*   **Dynamic Edge Creation:** New edges are created in the diagram to represent inferred dependencies. Edge thickness/color reflect dependency strength.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Users can toggle the display of inferred dependencies, filter by dependency strength, and explore the evidence supporting each inferred dependency (access logs, time-series data).
*   **Predictive Analysis:** Implement a "what-if" scenario analysis. Allow users to simulate the impact of removing or modifying a resource, highlighting potential cascading failures based on inferred dependencies.

**4.  Alerting & Remediation:**

*   **Dependency Drift Detection:** Monitor changes in inferred dependencies over time. Flag significant drifts as potential configuration errors or security breaches.
*   **Automated Tagging:** Automatically apply tags to resources based on identified dependencies, enabling automated policy enforcement and access control.

**Pseudocode (BehavioralAnalysisEngine â€“ Simplified):**

```
function analyze_behavior(resource_id, behavioral_data):
  # Correlation Analysis
  correlations = calculate_correlation(behavioral_data)
  for target_resource, correlation_score in correlations:
    if correlation_score > threshold:
      add_dependency(resource_id, target_resource, correlation_score)

  # Causality Inference
  causal_relationships = calculate_causality(behavioral_data)
  for target_resource, causality_score in causal_relationships:
    if causality_score > threshold:
      add_dependency(resource_id, target_resource, causality_score)

function add_dependency(source_resource, target_resource, strength):
  # Update Dependency Database
  dependency_graph.add_edge(source_resource, target_resource, weight=strength)
  # Generate Tag
  tag_key = "inferred_dependency"
  tag_value = target_resource + "," + str(strength)
  generate_tag(target_resource, tag_key, tag_value)
```

**Novelty:** This shifts the paradigm from static dependency definition to dynamic, behavior-driven dependency discovery. The system *learns* the architecture as it runs, providing a more accurate and resilient representation of the real system. This facilitates better troubleshooting, capacity planning, and security analysis.
