## Dynamic Glyph-Based Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend glyph pair analysis to 3D scene reconstruction, leveraging glyphs not just for text detection, but as feature points for environment mapping.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Glyph Feature Extraction (3D):**
    *   Expand existing 2D glyph feature extraction (height, stroke width, color) to include:
        *   **Depth Map Integration:** Utilize depth data (from LiDAR, stereo vision, or structured light) to calculate glyph depth.
        *   **Surface Normal Estimation:** Calculate surface normals at each glyph's location to determine surface orientation.
        *   **Glyph Cluster Analysis:** Identify clusters of glyphs that form larger, recognizable shapes. (e.g., a 'C' and a 'D' forming a partial circle)

2.  **Glyph Pair Score (3D):**
    *   Modify the glyph pair score to incorporate 3D feature similarity:
        *   **Depth Consistency:** Higher scores for glyph pairs with similar depths.
        *   **Surface Normal Alignment:** Higher scores for glyph pairs with aligned surface normals.
        *   **Geometric Relationship:** Score based on the relative position of glyphs - are they on the same plane, forming a curve, etc.?

3.  **Scene Point Cloud Generation:**
    *   Use the glyph pair scores to establish relationships between glyphs in 3D space.
    *   Each glyph becomes a point in a 3D point cloud.
    *   Glyph pair scores act as edge weights connecting these points.
    *   Apply graph optimization algorithms (e.g., bundle adjustment) to refine the point cloud and minimize reconstruction errors.

4.  **Semantic Scene Labelling:**
    *   Train a classifier to identify semantic categories of reconstructed objects based on glyph clusters and point cloud geometry.
    *   Example categories: “Sign”, “Wall”, “Furniture”, “Obstacle”.
    *   This provides a higher-level understanding of the scene beyond just text detection.

5.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**
    *   Implement a dynamic adaptation mechanism that refines the reconstruction as new glyphs are detected.
    *   Use a Kalman filter or similar algorithm to track glyph positions and update the point cloud in real-time.
    *   This ensures accurate and robust scene reconstruction even in dynamic environments.

**Pseudocode (Core Reconstruction Loop):**

```
function reconstructScene(image, depthMap):
    glyphs = detectGlyphs(image)
    glyphFeatures = extract3DFeatures(glyphs, depthMap)

    glyphPairs = generateGlyphPairs(glyphs)
    glyphPairScores = calculate3DScore(glyphPairs, glyphFeatures)

    pointCloud = initializePointCloud()

    for glyph in glyphs:
        addGlyphToPointCloud(pointCloud, glyph, glyphFeatures)

    for pair in glyphPairs:
        weight = glyphPairScores[pair]
        connectGlyphsInPointCloud(pointCloud, pair, weight)

    optimizedPointCloud = optimizePointCloud(pointCloud)  // Bundle adjustment or similar

    semanticLabels = classifyScene(optimizedPointCloud)

    return optimizedPointCloud, semanticLabels
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-resolution camera
*   Depth sensor (LiDAR, stereo vision, or structured light)
*   Powerful GPU for real-time processing
*   Deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
*   Graph optimization library (g2o, Ceres Solver)
