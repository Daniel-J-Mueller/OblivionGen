## Dynamic Key Sharding & Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the distributed key management to incorporate key *sharding* across storage nodes, coupled with *temporal access control* – limiting access to data based on time windows. This moves beyond simple distribution and introduces a dynamic, time-sensitive security layer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Sharding Module (KSM):**

*   **Function:** Responsible for breaking down permanent keys into 'key shares'.
*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) algorithm or similar cryptographic scheme. The threshold 'k' defines the minimum number of shares required to reconstruct the original key.
*   **Distribution:** KSM distributes key shares across a pre-defined set of storage nodes.  The selection of nodes considers network topology and node health.
*   **Reconstruction:** A dedicated 'Key Reconstruction Service' (KRS) running on the control plane reconstructs the key when access is requested, utilizing the shares from the appropriate storage nodes.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function shardKey(key, k, n): // key is the permanent key, k is the threshold, n is the total number of shares
        shares = generateShares(key, k, n) // Uses SSS or similar
        for each share in shares:
            sendShare(share, storageNode) // Distribute to storage nodes
        return shares
    ```

**2. Temporal Access Control (TAC) Layer:**

*   **Function:** Define time windows during which specific keys (or key shares) are valid.
*   **Data Structure:** Maintain a 'Temporal Key Map' (TKM) on each storage node. The TKM stores key shares along with associated start and end timestamps.
*   **Validation:** Before granting access, the storage node checks if the current timestamp falls within the valid time window for the requested key share.
*   **Rotation:** Keys are automatically rotated (new shares generated and distributed) at the end of the defined time window.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function validateKeyShare(keyShare, timestamp):
        if timestamp >= keyShare.startTime and timestamp <= keyShare.endTime:
            return true
        else:
            return false
    ```

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   Modify the Key Reconstruction Service (KRS) to retrieve key shares and validate their temporal validity before reconstructing the key.
*   Implement a 'Time Synchronization Protocol' (TSP) to ensure accurate timestamps across all storage nodes.  NTP or similar protocol can be used.
*   Extend the storage node's access control mechanism to incorporate TAC validation.
*   Add API endpoints to the control plane to allow users to define time windows for key access.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Control Plane:** Houses the KSM, KRS, TSP, and user API.
*   **Storage Nodes:** Store key shares, validate temporal access, and provide data access.
*   **Network:** Secure communication channel between control plane and storage nodes.

**5. Failure Handling:**

*   **Node Failure:** The KSM automatically re-shares key fragments to ensure redundancy. The threshold ‘k’ is chosen such that even with several node failures, the key can still be reconstructed.
*   **Network Partition:** Implement a consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft or Paxos) to ensure consistent key reconstruction across distributed storage nodes.
