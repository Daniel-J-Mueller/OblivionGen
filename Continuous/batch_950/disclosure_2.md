## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping for Personalized Sound Zones

**Concept:** Leverage multi-microphone arrays and beamforming not just for wake word detection and source localization, but to dynamically map the acoustic environment *and* personalize sound zones for individual users within that space. This goes beyond simple directionality; it creates localized “bubbles” of optimized audio.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Circular arrangement of at least 16 microphones distributed across the top surface of the device (cylindrical housing preferred, ~20cm diameter).  Microphones must have high signal-to-noise ratio and broad frequency response.
*   **Speaker Array:**  Multiple (minimum 4) small, full-range speakers positioned around the base of the device, angled upwards and outwards.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance multi-core processor with dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) for real-time audio processing.
*   **Storage:**  Non-volatile memory (SSD preferred) for storing acoustic maps, user profiles, and system data.
*   **User Identification:** Integrated camera or biometric sensor (optional) for user identification/authentication.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Acoustic Mapping Module:**
    *   Utilizes microphone array data to create a 3D acoustic map of the surrounding environment. This map identifies surfaces, obstacles, and potential sound reflections.
    *   Employs ray tracing and acoustic modeling techniques to simulate sound propagation within the space.
    *   Continuously updates the acoustic map in real-time to account for changes in the environment (e.g., moving furniture, people entering/leaving the room).
*   **User Profile Management:**
    *   Stores individual user preferences for sound characteristics (e.g., equalization, volume, spatialization).
    *   Includes a "comfort zone" parameter, defining the preferred listening area for each user.
*   **Beamforming & Sound Zone Creation:**
    *   Dynamic beamforming algorithm adjusts the direction and amplitude of sound beams emitted by the speaker array.
    *   Creates localized “sound zones” tailored to each identified user's comfort zone and audio preferences.
    *   Sound zones are non-overlapping, minimizing audio bleed between users.
*   **Adaptive Noise Cancellation:**
    *   Real-time analysis of ambient noise in each sound zone.
    *   Adaptive noise cancellation filters applied to each user's audio stream, reducing distractions.
*   **Pseudocode - Sound Zone Creation:**

```
FUNCTION CreateSoundZone(userID, positionX, positionY, audioStream)

  // Get user preferences from profile
  preferences = GetUserPreferences(userID)

  // Get acoustic map of the environment
  acousticMap = GetAcousticMap()

  // Calculate optimal speaker weights based on user position, preferences, and acoustic map
  speakerWeights = CalculateSpeakerWeights(positionX, positionY, preferences, acousticMap)

  // Apply speaker weights to the audio stream
  processedAudio = ApplySpeakerWeights(audioStream, speakerWeights)

  // Emit processed audio through speaker array
  EmitAudio(processedAudio)

END FUNCTION
```

**3. Operational Modes:**

*   **Single-User Mode:** Creates a personalized sound zone around a single identified user.
*   **Multi-User Mode:** Creates separate, non-overlapping sound zones for multiple identified users.  Prioritization can be set manually or automatically (e.g., based on voice activity).
*   **Ambient Mode:**  Distributes ambient sounds (e.g., music, nature sounds) evenly throughout the space.
*   **Spatial Audio Mode:** Employs spatial audio rendering techniques to create immersive sound experiences.

**4. Potential Applications:**

*   **Home Entertainment:** Personalized sound zones for individual family members watching movies or listening to music.
*   **Open Office Environments:**  Reduced noise distractions and improved speech privacy for employees.
*   **Educational Settings:** Targeted audio delivery for students in classrooms or lecture halls.
*   **Gaming:** Immersive spatial audio experiences for gamers.
