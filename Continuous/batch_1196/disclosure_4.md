## Adaptive Service Handover & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the patent’s focus on number porting and service activation to encompass a *proactive* handover system that anticipates user needs and pre-allocates resources *before* the user actively switches devices. This moves beyond simply porting a number *to* a new device, and into a system that dynamically manages service continuity across multiple devices *predictively*.

**System Specs:**

*   **Device Registry:** Each user maintains a registered device list within their account. Devices are categorized by usage type (primary, secondary, travel, etc.).
*   **Usage Pattern Analysis:** System monitors usage patterns across registered devices – call frequency, data consumption, application usage, location data (optional, user consent required).  This data informs a predictive model.
*   **Predictive Handover Engine:**
    *   The core of the system. Utilizes machine learning to predict when a user is likely to switch their primary device (based on usage patterns, calendar events, location – e.g., arriving at work, leaving on vacation).
    *   Triggers a pre-emptive handover sequence.
*   **Resource Pre-Allocation:**
    *   Based on the predicted handover, the system pre-allocates resources on the target device (e.g., ensuring sufficient data allowance, optimizing application settings).
    *   This pre-allocation occurs *before* the user explicitly initiates a switch.
*   **Seamless Service Transfer:**
    *   When the user *does* switch devices (or the system determines a switch has occurred), service transfer is nearly instantaneous.
    *   This is facilitated by the pre-allocated resources and pre-configured settings.
*   **Adaptive Number Handling:**
    *   Instead of simply porting a number, the system intelligently routes calls/messages to the most appropriate device based on context (location, activity, device capabilities).
    *   Example: Incoming calls during a work commute are routed to the user's car's Bluetooth system.
*   **User Interface:**  Provides a dashboard for managing registered devices, viewing usage patterns, and customizing handover preferences.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Handover Engine):**

```
function predict_handover(user_id):
  user_data = get_user_data(user_id)
  usage_patterns = analyze_usage(user_data)
  calendar_events = get_calendar_events(user_id)
  location_data = get_location_data(user_id) // optional

  // Machine Learning Model (trained on historical data)
  predicted_switch_time = ML_Model.predict(usage_patterns, calendar_events, location_data)

  if predicted_switch_time < threshold:
    target_device = determine_target_device(user_data)
    pre_allocate_resources(target_device)
    notify_user("Predicted device switch. Resources pre-allocated.")

  return predicted_switch_time

function determine_target_device(user_data):
  // Logic to determine the most likely target device
  // Based on context (location, activity, time of day)
  // Returns device ID

function pre_allocate_resources(device_id):
  // Allocates resources on the target device
  // (e.g., data allowance, application settings)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with IoT devices (e.g., smartwatches) to further refine predictive modeling.
*   Support for multiple user profiles on a single device.
*   Dynamic adjustment of resource allocation based on real-time network conditions.
*   Integration with enterprise mobility management (EMM) platforms for corporate device management.
