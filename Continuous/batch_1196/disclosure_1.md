## Dynamic Exclusion Weighting via Behavioral Clustering

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on re-inclusion based on forecasted sales. This builds on that by adding a layer of *behavioral* analysis of users referred from the comparison shopping network. Instead of simply forecasting *volume*, it predicts *type* of demand and adjusts exclusion weighting accordingly.

**Specs:**

1.  **User Behavioral Data Collection:**  Integrate a lightweight tracking mechanism *on the electronic commerce network site* for users arriving via the referral network. Capture data points including:
    *   Time spent browsing categories.
    *   Search terms used.
    *   Items viewed (without purchase).
    *   Items added to cart (even if abandoned).
    *   Purchase history (if any, after initial referral).
2.  **Behavioral Cluster Creation:** Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) to group users into distinct behavioral segments.  Key features for clustering: the data collected in step 1, and potentially demographic data if available.  Dynamically adjust cluster parameters (K in K-means, epsilon/minPts in DBSCAN) based on incoming data volume and variance.
3.  **Exclusion Weighting Matrix:** Create a matrix where rows represent items and columns represent behavioral clusters. Each cell in the matrix contains a 'weight' – a value indicating how sensitive that item’s exclusion should be to changes in demand from that specific cluster.
    *   High weight: Indicates strong dependence on that cluster for sales. Exclusion should be carefully reconsidered if demand from this cluster increases.
    *   Low weight: Indicates weak dependence. Exclusion can be maintained even with increased demand.
4.  **Dynamic Exclusion Rule Adjustment:**  Modify the existing exclusion rules to incorporate the exclusion weighting matrix.  Instead of a single forecasted sales threshold for re-inclusion, calculate a weighted average of forecasted sales *per cluster*.  The re-inclusion decision is based on whether this weighted average exceeds the threshold.
5.  **Real-time Weight Adjustment:**  Continuously update the exclusion weights based on real-time user behavior.  If a cluster exhibits a significant increase in interest in a previously excluded item, increase the corresponding weight. If interest declines, decrease the weight. Implement a smoothing factor to prevent erratic weight changes.
6.  **A/B Testing Framework:** Incorporate an A/B testing framework to compare the performance of the dynamic weighting system against the original system. Track metrics such as conversion rates, revenue, and customer engagement.

**Pseudocode (core logic within feed content control process):**

```
function determine_reintroduction(item, forecasted_sales, behavioral_clusters, exclusion_weight_matrix):
  total_weighted_sales = 0
  for cluster in behavioral_clusters:
    cluster_sales = forecasted_sales[cluster]
    weight = exclusion_weight_matrix[item][cluster]
    total_weighted_sales += cluster_sales * weight

  if total_weighted_sales > exclusion_threshold:
    return True // Reintroduce item to feed
  else:
    return False // Maintain exclusion

function update_exclusion_weights(item, behavioral_clusters, recent_behavior):
  for cluster in behavioral_clusters:
    cluster_interest = calculate_cluster_interest(cluster, recent_behavior, item)
    exclusion_weight_matrix[item][cluster] = adjust_weight(exclusion_weight_matrix[item][cluster], cluster_interest, smoothing_factor)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `exclusion_weight_matrix`:  Dictionary of Dictionaries. `matrix[item][cluster] = weight`
*   `behavioral_clusters`: List of cluster IDs.
*   `forecasted_sales`: Dictionary. `forecasted_sales[cluster] = sales_volume`
*   `recent_behavior`:  List of user interaction data points.
