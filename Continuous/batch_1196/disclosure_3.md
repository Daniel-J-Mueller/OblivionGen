## Dynamic Tunnel Composition with Policy-Driven Segment Routing

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple tunnel lookups to enable *dynamic* tunnel composition using Segment Routing (SR) principles, guided by fine-grained policies. This creates adaptable paths that respond to network conditions *and* application requirements in real-time, going beyond static tunnel definitions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Policy Engine Integration:**

*   **Policy Definition:**  Introduce a Policy Definition Language (PDL) allowing network administrators to define policies based on:
    *   Application type (e.g., video conferencing, database traffic).
    *   User groups.
    *   Time of day.
    *   Network conditions (latency, jitter, packet loss).
    *   Security requirements (encryption level, allowed paths).
*   **Policy Compilation:** A Policy Compiler translates PDL rules into a set of Segment Identifiers (SIDs).  These SIDs represent specific network segments (links, nodes, services – e.g., firewall, load balancer) that the traffic *should* traverse.

**2. Dynamic Path Computation (DPC) Module:**

*   **Input:** Receives network packet headers, forwarding route information, and the compiled policy (list of SIDs).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Initial Path:**  Based on the forwarding route, identify the initial next hop.
    2.  **SID Injection:**  The DPC module dynamically *injects* SIDs into the packet header (e.g., using MPLS or SRv6).  The order of SID injection dictates the path the packet will take.
    3.  **Path Validation:**  Before forwarding, the module validates that the constructed path is feasible and doesn’t violate any network constraints (e.g., blacklisted links).
    4.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** Continuously monitor network performance. If conditions degrade along the initial path, the module can *re-order* or *add/remove* SIDs on-the-fly to steer traffic to a better route.  This happens *without* requiring a full routing table update.

**3. Segment Identifier Database (SIDDB):**

*   A central database storing mappings between SIDs and corresponding network elements/services.
*   Allows for easy configuration and management of SR policies.
*   Supports hierarchical SIDs to represent complex service chains (e.g., a SID representing “firewall + load balancer”).

**4. Packet Format Extension:**

*   Extend packet headers to accommodate multiple SIDs (stacking). This enables the creation of complex paths with multiple segments.
*   Standardize a method for encoding and decoding SIDs in a portable way.

**Pseudocode (DPC Module):**

```
function compute_dynamic_path(packet, forwarding_route, policy):
  sid_stack = policy.get_sid_stack()
  next_hop = forwarding_route.get_next_hop()

  // Inject SIDs into packet header (prepend or append based on policy)
  for sid in sid_stack:
    packet.prepend_sid(sid)

  // Validate path (check for blacklisted links, etc.)
  if not validate_path(packet.sid_stack):
    //Fallback to default forwarding
    return forwarding_route.get_next_hop()

  return packet.sid_stack[0].get_next_hop() //First SID defines immediate next hop
```

**Novelty:**  This design moves beyond static tunnel lookups to create highly adaptable paths.  Combining policy-driven segment routing with dynamic path computation allows the network to respond intelligently to changing conditions and application needs in real time, offering a level of flexibility and control beyond existing solutions. The combination of *policy* and *dynamic path adjustment* is key.
