## Enhanced Reviewer “Trust Network” & Predictive Review Utility

**Concept:** Expand the “preferred reviewer” functionality into a dynamic, multi-layered “Trust Network” visualizing reviewer relationships & leveraging predictive modeling to surface potentially valuable, *unseen* reviews. 

**Specification:**

**I. Data Architecture – Trust Network Graph**

*   **Nodes:** Individual Reviewers, Items (Products).
*   **Edges:**
    *   “Follows” – User A designates User B as a preferred reviewer (existing functionality). Weight = 1.
    *   “Reviews” – User A reviews Item B. Weight = Review helpfulness score (existing).
    *   “Co-Reviews” – User A and User B both reviewed Item C. Weight = Correlation of rating scores (higher correlation = stronger weight).
    *   “Shared Preferences” –  Based on user's "Followed" network and items reviewed, calculate percentage overlap of preferred reviewers/items. Weight = Percentage overlap.
*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to store and query the network efficiently.

**II. Predictive Review Utility – “Hidden Gem” Algorithm**

1.  **User Profile Construction:**
    *   Gather user’s explicitly followed reviewers.
    *   Infer preferences from reviewed items (category, price range, brands).
    *   Analyze user’s interaction history (clicks, purchases, saved items).
2.  **“Hidden Gem” Identification:**
    *   For a target item, identify reviewers *not* explicitly followed by the user.
    *   Calculate a “Relevance Score” for each non-followed reviewer based on:
        *   **Proximity in Trust Network:** Shortest path distance to user’s followed reviewers. (Lower distance = higher relevance)
        *   **Co-Review Correlation:**  Correlation of ratings between the non-followed reviewer and the user's preferred reviewers on similar items.
        *   **Item Category Alignment:**  How frequently the reviewer reviews items in the same category as the target item.
    *   Sort reviewers by Relevance Score.
    *   Surface the top N reviewers and their reviews of the target item.  Mark as “Recommended based on your trusted network.”
3.  **Review Filtering/Prioritization:** Implement a tiered filtering system.  Reviews from high-Relevance reviewers are boosted in ranking. Reviews from reviewers with a strong negative or positive correlation to the user’s preferences are prominently displayed (potential “dealbreakers” or “must-haves”).

**III. User Interface (UI) Specifications:**

*   **Trust Network Visualization (Optional):**  Interactive visualization of the user's immediate Trust Network (followed reviewers) – expandable to show secondary connections.
*   **“Recommended Reviewers” Section:** Dedicated section on product pages displaying top recommended reviewers and snippets of their reviews.
*   **Review Filtering Controls:**  Options to filter reviews by "Recommended Reviewers," "Most Helpful," "Highest Rated," “Negative Feedback”, etc.
*   **Reviewer Profile Enhancement:** Display reviewer’s "Trust Score" (derived from network analysis) on their profile. Showcase reviewers who are highly connected within the Trust Network.

**IV. Pseudocode – “Hidden Gem” Algorithm (Simplified):**

```
function findHiddenGems(userID, itemID):
  userPreferences = getUserPreferences(userID)
  nonFollowedReviewers = getNonFollowedReviewers(userID)

  for reviewer in nonFollowedReviewers:
    relevanceScore = 0
    #Proximity in Trust Network
    pathDistance = getShortestPathDistance(userID, reviewer)
    relevanceScore += (1 / pathDistance)  #Higher score for closer connections

    #Co-Review Correlation
    correlation = calculateRatingCorrelation(userPreferences, reviewer, itemCategory)
    relevanceScore += correlation

    reviewer.relevanceScore = relevanceScore

  sortedReviewers = sort(reviewer by relevanceScore descending)

  return sortedReviewers // Return list of reviewers with their reviews
```

**V. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Trust Network Gamification:** Reward reviewers for building strong connections and providing helpful reviews.
*   **Personalized Review Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of reviews tailored to the user’s preferences, highlighting the most relevant information.
*   **Predictive Rating:**  Based on the user's Trust Network and reviewer ratings, predict how the user would rate the item.
