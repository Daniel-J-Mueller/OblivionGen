## Adaptive Attestation Profiles & Dynamic Trust Anchors

**Concept:** Extend the attestation process beyond simple component versioning to encompass runtime behavioral analysis and dynamically adjust trust levels based on observed behavior.

**Specification:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiling Module:**
    *   Integrated within the client computing device.
    *   Monitors key system calls, resource access patterns, and network activity of applications and system processes.
    *   Establishes baseline behavioral profiles for trusted software. These profiles are application-specific and consider expected resource utilization and communication patterns.
    *   Utilizes machine learning (anomaly detection algorithms) to identify deviations from established baseline profiles.

2.  **Dynamic Trust Anchor Adjustment:**
    *   Attestation reports now include not only component versioning but also a “Behavioral Trust Score” generated by the Behavioral Profiling Module.
    *   The service provider system incorporates a "Trust Policy Engine".
    *   The Trust Policy Engine evaluates the Behavioral Trust Score *in conjunction with* the traditional attestation data (component versions, TPM signatures).
    *   Based on this combined evaluation, the system dynamically adjusts the trust level assigned to the client device and applications.

3.  **Trust Level Granularity:**
    *   Implement a multi-tiered trust system (e.g., Full Trust, Limited Trust, No Trust).
    *   Limited Trust could restrict access to sensitive resources or require additional authentication factors.
    *   No Trust could result in complete denial of service.

4.  **Attestation Report Structure (Extended):**

```
{
  "client_id": "unique_client_identifier",
  "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp",
  "component_attestation": [
    {
      "component_name": "Operating System",
      "version": "10.15.7",
      "tpm_signature": "...",
      "behavioral_trust_score": 0.95
    },
    {
      "component_name": "Application X",
      "version": "2.3.1",
      "tpm_signature": "...",
      "behavioral_trust_score": 0.80
    }
  ],
  "system_health_metrics": {
    "cpu_utilization": "...",
    "memory_pressure": "...",
    "disk_iops": "..."
  }
}
```

5.  **Pseudocode (Trust Policy Engine - Service Provider):**

```
function evaluate_trust(attestation_report):
  trust_level = "Full Trust" // Default

  for component in attestation_report.component_attestation:
    if component.behavioral_trust_score < 0.7:
      trust_level = "Limited Trust"
      break

    if component.behavioral_trust_score < 0.5:
      trust_level = "No Trust"
      break

  //Consider system health metrics - e.g., high CPU usage triggers lower trust
  if attestation_report.system_health_metrics.cpu_utilization > 0.9:
      trust_level = "Limited Trust"

  return trust_level
```

6. **Sensor Fusion Integration:** Integrate data from onboard sensors (camera, microphone, accelerometer) for enhanced behavioral analysis. This allows for liveness detection and identification of potential malicious activity (e.g., automated agents attempting to bypass security).



**Rationale:** This approach moves beyond static attestation to a more dynamic and resilient security model. By continuously monitoring application behavior and adjusting trust levels accordingly, the system can adapt to evolving threats and mitigate the risk of compromised devices or malicious software. The addition of sensor data further strengthens the security posture by adding another layer of verification.
