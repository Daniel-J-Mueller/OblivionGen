## Dynamic Content ‘Layers’ & AI-Driven Storytelling

**Concept:** Expand the immersive multimedia view beyond simple media switching. Introduce layered content within the view, dynamically generated and controlled by AI based on user interaction and inferred preferences. Think of it as a ‘digital diorama’ around the product.

**Specs:**

1.  **Layer Definition:**  Define ‘layers’ as distinct, renderable elements within the immersive view. Layers can contain 3D models, animations, text, audio, video, interactive elements, and even real-time data feeds.  Layers are tagged with metadata defining their content type, interactivity level, and relevance criteria.

2.  **AI Content Engine:** Develop an AI engine that generates and manages these layers. The engine uses a combination of:
    *   **Product Knowledge Graph:** A database linking product features, benefits, use cases, and associated media.
    *   **User Preference Model:**  Built from user history (purchases, browsing, interactions) and real-time behavior.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:**  Data about the user’s location, time of day, and device.

3.  **Dynamic Layer Generation:**
    *   The AI engine selects and generates layers based on the user preference model, contextual awareness, and product knowledge graph.
    *   Layers are rendered in 3D space around the product, creating a dynamic and interactive environment.
    *   Example: For a bicycle, layers could include:
        *   Animated route suggestions based on user location and fitness level.
        *   A virtual mechanic demonstrating maintenance procedures.
        *   A community forum displaying user-submitted photos and ride reports.
        *   AR-overlay displaying weather forecasts & local cycling events.

4.  **Interactive Layer Control:**
    *   Users can manipulate layers using gestures, voice commands, or on-screen controls.
    *   Layers can be toggled on/off, zoomed in/out, rotated, and rearranged.
    *   Layers can trigger other layers, creating branching narratives and interactive experiences.

5.  **'Storytelling' Mode:**
    *   Implement a 'Storytelling' mode where the AI engine curates a sequence of layers to tell a story about the product.
    *   Stories could be based on user interests (e.g., adventure, sustainability, performance) or product features.

6.  **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   Adapt the existing immersive view rendering engine to support layered content.
    *   Utilize existing media controls and UI elements where possible.

**Pseudocode (Layer Management):**

```
// Layer Definition
Class Layer {
  String layerID;
  String contentType;  // Image, Video, 3DModel, etc.
  String metadata; // Tags, relevance criteria
  Function render() : RenderableObject;
}

// AI Content Engine
Class AIContentEngine {
  UserPreferenceModel userModel;
  ProductKnowledgeGraph productKG;

  Function generateLayers(ProductID productID) : List<Layer> {
    relevantLayers = [];
    for each layer in productKG.getLayersForProduct(productID) {
      if (userModel.isRelevant(layer.metadata)) {
        relevantLayers.add(layer);
      }
    }
    return relevantLayers;
  }
}

// Immersive View Renderer
Function renderImmersiveView(ProductID productID) {
  aiEngine = new AIContentEngine();
  layers = aiEngine.generateLayers(productID);
  renderProduct(productID); // Render the core product image
  for each layer in layers {
    renderLayer(layer); // Render each layer on top
  }
}
```

This extends beyond simply swapping media. It's about building dynamic, interactive experiences that adapt to the user and tell a story about the product, making the immersive view truly engaging.
