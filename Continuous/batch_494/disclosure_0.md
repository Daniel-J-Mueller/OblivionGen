## Adaptive Acoustic Spaces

**Concept:** Leveraging the speech-controlled device’s microphone array and spatial audio processing to dynamically create and modify acoustic spaces perceived by the user. This builds on the idea of escalating communication modes but shifts the focus from *how* communication happens to *where* it seems to happen.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing speech-controlled device with a multi-microphone array (minimum 4 mics) and spatial audio rendering capabilities. Additional hardware: low-latency spatial audio headphones/earbuds recommended, though integration with existing speakers is possible.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Spatial Mapping Engine:** Processes microphone array data to create a real-time 3D acoustic map of the environment. This includes identifying surfaces, distances to objects, and ambient noise profiles.
    *   **Acoustic Space Designer:** Allows the user (or a pre-programmed profile) to define virtual acoustic spaces.  These spaces are defined by parameters like:
        *   Room Size (virtual dimensions)
        *   Surface Material (e.g., “carpeted,” “stone,” “wooden”) - dictates reverb and reflection characteristics
        *   Sound Source Location (virtual position of the speaker)
        *   Ambient Soundscape (optional: adds background sounds like rain, café noise, etc.)
    *   **Audio Rendering Engine:**  Takes the audio input (speech, music, notifications) and renders it as if it’s emanating from the defined virtual acoustic space. This requires real-time head tracking (via device sensors or optional external sensors) to accurately position the sound in the user’s ears.
    *   **Contextual Adaptation Module:**  Dynamically adjusts the acoustic space based on user activity, time of day, and environmental factors.  For example:
        *   During a phone call:  Creates a focused “conference room” acoustic space to minimize distractions.
        *   During music playback:  Simulates a concert hall or intimate listening room.
        *   When receiving a notification:  Positions the notification sound as if it’s coming from the direction of the triggering event (e.g., a smart home device).
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Static Spaces:** User pre-defines and selects a static acoustic space.
    *   **Dynamic Adaptation:** System automatically adjusts the acoustic space based on context (as described above).
    *   **Spatial Communication:**  In multi-device scenarios (e.g., a conference call), the system simulates the spatial position of each participant, making it feel like they are physically present in the same room. Participants are assigned a spatial location based on their device positions or manually.
*   **Pseudocode (Contextual Adaptation Module):**

```
function adjustAcousticSpace(userActivity, timeOfDay, environment) {
    if (userActivity == "phoneCall") {
        acousticSpace = "conferenceRoom";
        reverbLevel = "high";
        soundSourcePosition = "front";
    } else if (userActivity == "musicPlayback") {
        if (musicGenre == "classical") {
            acousticSpace = "concertHall";
            reverbLevel = "veryHigh";
        } else {
            acousticSpace = "intimateListeningRoom";
            reverbLevel = "medium";
        }
    } else if (userActivity == "notification") {
        soundSourcePosition = directionOfTriggeringEvent; //Determined by device location or sensor data
        reverbLevel = "low";
    } else {
        acousticSpace = "default";
        reverbLevel = "medium";
    }

    applyAcousticSpaceSettings(acousticSpace, reverbLevel, soundSourcePosition);
}
```

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Capture:** Ability to capture the acoustic characteristics of a real-world environment (e.g., a living room) and replicate it virtually.
    *   **Personalized Acoustic Profiles:**  System learns the user’s preferred acoustic settings over time and automatically adjusts accordingly.
    *   **Integration with AR/VR:** Overlay virtual acoustic spaces onto the real world using AR/VR headsets.
