## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping & Projection

**Core Concept:** Expand the wireless entrance communication device to function as a localized acoustic mapping and projection system, enhancing both security and communication. Instead of *just* audio/video transmission, create a dynamic, interactive soundscape around the entrance.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microphone Array: Incorporate a circular array of at least 8 high-sensitivity microphones embedded within the device's housing. Beamforming and noise cancellation are essential.
    *   Miniature Projectors (2-4): Low-power, short-throw projectors capable of displaying simple visuals on nearby surfaces (door, wall, ground). Resolution: 640x480 minimum.
    *   Spatial Audio Driver: Dedicated hardware/firmware for processing and generating 3D audio output.
    *   Edge Processing Unit: On-device processing for acoustic mapping, object detection, and scene analysis. (Nvidia Jetson Nano or equivalent)
    *   Wireless Connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2
    *   Power: PoE (Power over Ethernet) or dedicated power supply.

*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Acoustic Mapping Algorithm:  Utilize a combination of microphone array data and machine learning to create a real-time 3D map of sound sources around the entrance. Include object identification (e.g., human voice, vehicle engine, animal sounds).
        *   Pseudocode:
            ```
            FUNCTION AcousticMap():
                INPUT: Microphone Array Data
                OUTPUT: 3D Sound Map (Object Locations, Sound Intensity)

                FOREACH Microphone in MicrophoneArray:
                    CAPTURE SoundData
                    CALCULATE TimeDifferenceOfArrival (TDOA)
                    ESTIMATE SourceDirection

                IDENTIFY SoundObjects (Voice, Vehicle, etc.) using ML model

                CREATE 3D Map:
                    For each SoundObject:
                        Position = EstimatedDirection + Distance
                        Intensity = SoundLevel
            ```

    *   Directional Audio Projection:  Project audio directly towards the identified sound source or specific areas.  This can be used for focused communication or to create a “sound barrier” to deter unwanted visitors.
        *   Pseudocode:
            ```
            FUNCTION ProjectAudio(AudioSource, TargetLocation):
                INPUT: AudioData, TargetCoordinates (X, Y, Z)
                OUTPUT: Spatialized Audio Projection

                CALCULATE DirectionVector (From Device to Target)
                APPLY Beamforming to AudioData (Focus Sound on DirectionVector)
                OUTPUT Spatialized Audio through Speakers
            ```

    *   Visual Cue Integration: Project simple visual cues (arrows, highlighted areas, text) on nearby surfaces to complement the audio projections.  For example, project an arrow pointing towards the sound source, or display a warning message if an unknown sound is detected.
    *   AI-Driven Event Detection:  Implement machine learning models to detect specific events based on acoustic signatures (e.g., breaking glass, shouting, car crash). Trigger alerts or automated responses (e.g., activate security cameras, notify authorities).
    *   User Interface: Mobile app for configuration, event logging, and remote control.

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   Standard Communication: Functions as a traditional wireless entrance communication device.
    *   Acoustic Mapping Mode: Continuously monitors and maps sound sources.
    *   Security Mode:  Detects and alerts to suspicious sounds.
    *   Interactive Mode:  Allows users to interact with sound sources through audio projections. (e.g. point to a delivery driver)

*   **Materials:** Weatherproof, durable materials (aluminum alloy, polycarbonate).  Sleek, minimalist design.
