## Dynamic Ruby Character Style Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the selective display of ruby characters to include dynamic adjustment of *style* based on user proficiency. Not simply *if* a ruby character is displayed, but *how* it is displayed. This allows for scaffolding language learning and caters to different learning styles.

**Specs:**

**1. Style Definitions:**

*   Define a range of ruby character styles:
    *   **Full:** Standard ruby character display (pronunciation above the kanji/logogram).
    *   **Faded:** Ruby character displayed with reduced opacity/contrast. Acts as a subtle hint without overwhelming the reader.
    *   **Simplified:** Ruby character displays only the core phonetic information – omitting tones or nuanced pronunciation details.
    *   **Color-Coded:** Ruby characters are displayed in colors correlating to phoneme groups or difficulty levels. (e.g., common sounds are green, difficult sounds are red).
    *   **Animated:** Ruby character "pulses" or briefly highlights on first encounter of the associated logogram in a section.
    *   **Hidden-Reveal:** Ruby character is initially obscured (e.g. with a blur) and is revealed with a tap or hover event.

**2. User Profile Integration:**

*   User profile stores:
    *   Reading Level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
    *   Preferred Learning Style (e.g., Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic)
    *   Specific Phoneme Difficulties (identified through assessment or user input)
    *   Optional “Hint Frequency” setting (how often hints are given, even at a higher proficiency level).

**3.  Dynamic Style Selection Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function selectRubyStyle(logogram, userProfile) {
  // Determine base style based on reading level
  if (userProfile.readingLevel == "Beginner") {
    baseStyle = "Full"
  } else if (userProfile.readingLevel == "Intermediate") {
    baseStyle = "Faded"
  } else {
    baseStyle = "None" // Or a minimal hint style
  }

  // Adjust style based on preferred learning style
  if (userProfile.learningStyle == "Visual") {
    style = baseStyle  // Visual learners benefit from direct display
  } else if (userProfile.learningStyle == "Auditory") {
    style = "Faded" // Subtle visual cue + encourage sounding out
  } else if (userProfile.learningStyle == "Kinesthetic") {
    style = "Hidden-Reveal" // Encourages active engagement/tapping
  }

  // Override based on phoneme difficulty
  if (userProfile.phonemeDifficulties.includes(getPhoneme(logogram))) {
    style = "Full" // Force full pronunciation guide for challenging sounds
  }
    
  // Apply hint frequency
  if (random() < userProfile.hintFrequency) {
      style = "Full"
  }

  return style
}
```

**4. Implementation Details:**

*   Electronic book format must support style overrides for ruby characters (e.g., using CSS-like styling within the ebook file).
*   Rendering engine must be able to apply the selected style to each ruby character dynamically.
*   User interface element for adjusting reading level, learning style, and phoneme difficulty preferences.
*   Optional: Integration with speech synthesis to provide audio pronunciation alongside the visual ruby character.
