## Dynamic Content ‘Lifespan’ Based on User Behavior Prediction

**System Overview:**

A predictive system that adjusts content TTL not solely on server load, but on predicted user re-request probability. The system analyzes user interaction data to anticipate whether a user is likely to request the same content again within a given timeframe. This proactive approach aims to optimize caching and reduce server load more effectively than a purely reactive, load-based TTL adjustment.

**Components:**

1.  **User Behavior Analyzer (UBA):**  A machine learning module that tracks user access patterns. Data points include:
    *   Content Requested
    *   Timestamp of Request
    *   User Identifier (anonymized/hashed)
    *   Device Type
    *   Geographic Location (coarse-grained)
    *   Referencing URL (where the user came from)

2.  **Prediction Engine (PE):** The core of the system. Uses the UBA output to predict the probability of a user requesting the same content within a configurable time window (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 hour). The PE employs a time-series forecasting model, potentially utilizing LSTM or Transformer networks.

3.  **Dynamic TTL Generator (DTLG):**  This module receives the predicted re-request probability from the PE and calculates a TTL value. It combines the probability with a server load factor (as in the provided patent) to derive the final TTL.

4.  **Content Delivery Network (CDN) Integration:**  The DTLG integrates directly with the CDN to set the TTL values for cached content.

**Pseudocode (DTLG):**

```
function calculateTTL(predictedReRequestProbability, serverLoadFactor, baseTTL):
    // baseTTL is a configurable default TTL (e.g., 60 seconds)

    // Normalize probability (0.0 - 1.0)
    normalizedProbability = predictedReRequestProbability

    // Scale TTL based on probability and server load
    ttlAdjustmentFactor = normalizedProbability * serverLoadFactor

    // Apply adjustment factor to base TTL
    adjustedTTL = baseTTL * (1 + ttlAdjustmentFactor)

    //Enforce minimum and maximum TTL values to prevent extremes.
    minTTL = 30 //seconds
    maxTTL = 3600 //seconds

    if adjustedTTL < minTTL:
        adjustedTTL = minTTL
    if adjustedTTL > maxTTL:
        adjustedTTL = maxTTL

    return adjustedTTL
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User requests content.
2.  Request passes through CDN.
3.  UBA logs request details.
4.  PE analyzes logged data and predicts re-request probability for that user/content combination.
5.  DTLG receives prediction and current server load.
6.  DTLG calculates adjusted TTL.
7.  CDN sets TTL for cached content.
8.  Content delivered to user.

**Scalability & Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Architecture:** UBA and PE must be horizontally scalable to handle large user bases.
*   **Data Privacy:**  User data must be anonymized/hashed to comply with privacy regulations.
*   **Cold Start Problem:**  For new users/content, a default TTL or a global load-based TTL can be used until sufficient data is collected.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Continuous A/B testing is crucial to optimize the prediction models and TTL adjustment algorithms.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor CDN cache hit ratios and server load to refine prediction models.
