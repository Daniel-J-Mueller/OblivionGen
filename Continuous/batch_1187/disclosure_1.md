## Adaptive Passcode Complexity & Behavioral Biometrics

**System Overview:** A dynamic passcode system that shifts complexity *and* incorporates subtle behavioral biometrics to both enhance security and reduce user frustration associated with forgotten passcodes. This moves beyond a single, static recovery process.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of *just* a support code reset, the system monitors user interaction patterns (typing speed, pressure, swipe angles, even subtle pauses) during passcode entry. If incorrect attempts are detected *and* the behavioral profile deviates significantly from the established norm, the system doesn’t immediately lock or offer a support code. It *increases* passcode complexity – adding a character, requiring a symbol, changing length – *in real-time* during the attempt. This is done transparently to the user.

**Specifications:**

*   **Behavioral Profile Creation:** Upon initial device setup *and* periodically during normal use, the system builds a baseline behavioral profile of the user’s passcode entry habits. This includes:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, velocity, pressure).
    *   Swipe patterns (if applicable – for gesture-based passcodes).
    *   Screen touch location and pressure variations.
*   **Dynamic Complexity Adjustment:**
    *   **Threshold Deviation:** A configurable deviation threshold is established. If a passcode attempt exhibits behavioral deviations exceeding this threshold *and* incorrect attempts are logged, the system modifies the passcode requirements *before* the user completes the attempt.
    *   **Complexity Levels:** The system maintains pre-defined complexity levels (e.g., 4-digit numeric, 6-character alphanumeric, 8-character alphanumeric with symbols).
    *   **Real-Time Modification:** As the user types, the system analyzes the behavioral data. If deviations are detected, the display provides subtle visual cues (e.g., a brief highlighting of the currently required character type – “Needs Symbol”).
    *   **Attempt Limit:** A limited number of ‘complexity adjustment’ attempts are allowed. After exceeding this limit (e.g., 3 attempts), the traditional support code mechanism is engaged.
*   **Support Code Integration:** If the support code is required, the behavioral data is also logged and sent to the support service. This serves as an additional authentication layer and helps identify potentially compromised accounts.
*   **Data Storage:** Behavioral data is stored locally on the device and optionally synced to a secure cloud server. Local storage ensures functionality even offline.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Pressure-sensitive screen (highly recommended).
    *   High-resolution digitizer (for accurate swipe/gesture tracking).
    *   Dedicated security enclave for storing behavioral data.

**Pseudocode (Complexity Adjustment Loop):**

```
function adjustComplexity(passcodeAttempt, behavioralData) {
  deviationScore = calculateDeviationScore(behavioralData);

  if (deviationScore > deviationThreshold && incorrectAttempts < maxAttempts) {
    complexityLevel++; // Increase complexity
    displayRequiredCharacterType(); // Highlight required type (symbol, number, etc.)
    requestAdditionalCharacter(complexityLevel); // Prompt user for next character
    incorrectAttempts++;
    return false; // Indicate attempt not complete
  } else {
    return true; // Indicate attempt potentially valid
  }
}

function calculateDeviationScore(behavioralData) {
  // Compare current behavioral data to established baseline
  // Use statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, machine learning)
  // Return a score representing the degree of deviation
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Adaptive Baseline:** The system could continuously refine the baseline behavioral profile, adapting to changes in the user’s typing habits over time.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Combine behavioral biometrics with other authentication factors (e.g., fingerprint scanning, facial recognition) for enhanced security.
*   **Threat Modeling:** Utilize behavioral data to identify potential threats, such as shoulder surfing or brute-force attacks.
