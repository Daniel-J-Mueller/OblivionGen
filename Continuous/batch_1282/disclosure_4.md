## Dynamic Behavioral Biometrics via Micro-Interaction Analysis

**Concept:** Augment the existing CAPTCHA approach with continuous, passive behavioral biometric data collection based on micro-interactions *during* website navigation, not just during explicit "challenge" moments. This shifts from 'prove you're not a bot' to 'continuously verify user authenticity'.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Capture Module:**
    *   Track mouse movements (speed, acceleration, jitter, path complexity) *across all* interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields, scrolling).
    *   Record keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, dwell time, error rate) *within* form fields.
    *   Monitor scrolling behavior (speed, pauses, patterns).
    *   Capture subtle touch gestures (pressure, swipe speed, multi-touch patterns) on touchscreen devices.
    *   Collect interaction timing data (time between clicks, keypresses, scrolls).
    *   All data collection is performed client-side (browser JavaScript) to minimize server load and maximize privacy.
2.  **Baseline Profile Creation:**
    *   Upon initial user interaction (account creation, first visit), a baseline behavioral profile is established.
    *   The profile is a multi-dimensional vector representing the userâ€™s typical interaction patterns.
    *   Baseline data is anonymized and stored securely on the server.
3.  **Real-Time Anomaly Detection:**
    *   As the user navigates the website, real-time interaction data is compared against their established baseline profile.
    *   A machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder, anomaly detection algorithm) identifies deviations from the baseline.
    *   Deviations are scored based on magnitude and frequency.
4.  **Dynamic Risk Assessment:**
    *   A risk score is calculated based on the accumulated anomaly scores.
    *   The risk score is continuously updated in real-time.
5.  **Adaptive Security Measures:**
    *   Based on the risk score, adaptive security measures are applied:
        *   **Low Risk:** No intervention.
        *   **Medium Risk:** Soft CAPTCHA (e.g., image selection, simple puzzle).  Reduced frequency of checks.
        *   **High Risk:** Traditional CAPTCHA. Increased frequency of checks. Potential account lockout.  Multi-factor authentication prompt.
6.  **Model Retraining:**
    *   The machine learning model is continuously retrained using aggregated and anonymized user data to improve accuracy and adapt to evolving behavioral patterns.
7. **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All data collection adheres to strict privacy standards (GDPR, CCPA).
    *   Users have the ability to opt-out of data collection (though this may reduce security).
    *   Data is anonymized and aggregated whenever possible.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function calculate_anomaly_score(current_interaction_data, user_profile) {
  // Calculate difference vector between current interaction and user profile
  difference_vector = current_interaction_data - user_profile

  // Calculate magnitude of difference vector
  magnitude = sqrt(sum(square(element) for element in difference_vector))

  // Apply a threshold to determine anomaly score
  if (magnitude > threshold) {
    anomaly_score = magnitude - threshold
  } else {
    anomaly_score = 0
  }

  return anomaly_score
}

function update_risk_score(previous_risk_score, new_anomaly_score) {
  // Apply a weighting factor to balance historical and current data
  weighting_factor = 0.7

  // Calculate new risk score
  new_risk_score = (weighting_factor * previous_risk_score) + ((1 - weighting_factor) * new_anomaly_score)

  return new_risk_score
}
```

**Novelty:** Shifts from discrete challenge-response to continuous behavioral authentication.  Focuses on subtle micro-interactions, making it more resistant to sophisticated bots that can solve traditional CAPTCHAs.  Adaptive security measures provide a seamless user experience.
