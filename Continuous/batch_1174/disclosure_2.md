**Dynamic Asset Mirroring with Predictive Redirection**

**Concept:** Expand upon the redirect functionality to proactively mirror assets across server fleets *before* deployment completion, anticipating access failures. Instead of simply redirecting when a server is unavailable, the system actively creates mirrored copies of assets on potentially 'healthier' servers *during* deployment, and intelligently redirects clients to these mirrored copies. This minimizes latency and eliminates the need for multiple redirect attempts.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** *Predictive Mirroring Service (PMS)* - a background service operating alongside the existing load balancing infrastructure.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Asset Dependency Graph (ADG)*: A graph representing the relationships between assets (e.g., images, scripts, CSS files). This allows for intelligent mirroring of entire web page dependencies.
    *   *Server Health Matrix (SHM)*: A real-time matrix tracking the health and deployment stage of each server in the fleet.
    *   *Mirroring Queue (MQ)*: A queue containing requests for asset mirroring.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Deployment Monitoring:** PMS continuously monitors the SHM for servers entering a deployment stage.
    2.  **Dependency Analysis:** Upon detecting a server undergoing deployment, PMS analyzes the ADG to identify affected assets.
    3.  **Proactive Mirroring:** PMS initiates mirroring requests for the identified assets to 'healthy' servers in the fleet.  Mirroring prioritizes servers with available capacity and low latency to the client (geo-DNS aware).
    4.  **Redirection Logic:** When a client requests an asset, the load balancer checks:
        *   If the primary server hosting the asset is healthy.
        *   If a mirrored copy exists on a 'healthier' server.
        *   If a mirrored copy exists, redirect the client to the mirrored copy.
        *   If no mirrored copy exists *and* the primary server is unavailable, follow the existing redirect logic (302 redirect to the same location).
*   **Pseudocode (Load Balancer Redirect Logic):**

```
function redirectRequest(request):
    primaryServer = request.getServer()
    asset = request.getAsset()

    if primaryServer.isHealthy():
        return serveAsset(asset)  # Serve directly

    mirroredServer = findMirroredAsset(asset)

    if mirroredServer != null and mirroredServer.isHealthy():
        return redirect(mirroredServer.getAddress())

    # Fallback to existing redirect logic
    return redirect(request.getLocation())
```

*   **Configuration:**
    *   *Mirroring Priority*: Configurable setting defining the priority of mirroring requests (e.g., high, medium, low).
    *   *Mirroring Capacity*:  Configurable limit on the number of concurrent mirroring requests per server.
    *   *Mirroring Threshold*:  Percentage of assets mirrored before deployment completion.
*   **Scalability:** The PMS should be horizontally scalable to handle large server fleets and high request volumes. Utilize a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous mirroring requests.
*   **Client-Side Caching:**  Leverage client-side caching mechanisms (e.g., HTTP caching headers) to reduce the number of requests for mirrored assets.
