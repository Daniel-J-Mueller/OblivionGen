## Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion with Probabilistic Reasoning

**Specification:** A system for automatically completing knowledge graphs by inferring missing facts based on temporal information and probabilistic reasoning. This builds upon the patent by adding proactive inference, rather than just reactive addition of facts *from* text.

**Core Concept:** Leverage temporal constraints and probabilistic models to predict likely future or missing past facts within the knowledge graph.  This allows the system to not only *learn* from textual sources but to *anticipate* and *model* changes within a domain.

**Components:**

1.  **Temporal Graph Database:**  Extends the existing knowledge base to explicitly store temporal information associated with each fact (start time, end time, uncertainty). This isn't just a timestamp, but a probability distribution over time.
2.  **Probabilistic Inference Engine:** Uses Bayesian Networks or Markov Models to represent relationships between entities, relations, and time. This engine calculates the probability of a fact being true given existing facts and temporal context.
3.  **Event Prediction Module:** Identifies potential future events based on temporal patterns and probabilistic forecasts.  For example, if 'Company A acquired Company B' at time T, and similar acquisitions historically lead to 'Executive X leaving' within 6-12 months, the system assigns a probability to 'Executive X leaving' within that timeframe.
4.  **Historical Fact Reconstruction Module:** Attempts to reconstruct missing historical facts based on current knowledge and temporal dependencies.  If 'Product Y was discontinued' at time T, and ‘Company Z manufactured Product Y’ at some earlier time, the system attempts to infer the approximate manufacturing period.
5.  **Confidence Scoring System:**  Assigns a confidence score to each inferred fact based on the strength of evidence, temporal proximity, and the reliability of the underlying probabilistic models. Facts below a certain threshold are flagged for human review.

**Pseudocode (Inference Process):**

```
function InferFact(entity1, relation, entity2, currentTime):
    // 1. Retrieve relevant historical facts and temporal information
    relevantFacts = GetRelevantFacts(entity1, relation, entity2)
    temporalData = GetTemporalData(relevantFacts)

    // 2. Build a Bayesian Network / Markov Model based on temporalData
    model = BuildProbabilisticModel(temporalData)

    // 3. Calculate the probability of the fact being true at currentTime
    probability = model.CalculateProbability(entity1, relation, entity2, currentTime)

    // 4. Assign a confidence score based on probability and other factors
    confidenceScore = CalculateConfidenceScore(probability, dataQuality, modelAccuracy)

    // 5. Return the inferred fact with its confidence score
    if confidenceScore > threshold:
        return Fact(entity1, relation, entity2, currentTime, confidenceScore)
    else:
        return null
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Fact:** (entity1, relation, entity2, startTime, endTime, confidenceScore)
*   **ProbabilisticModel:** Represents the relationships between entities, relations, and time using Bayesian Networks or Markov Models.
*   **TemporalData:** Stores historical data and temporal information associated with facts.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Anticipate equipment failures based on historical data and sensor readings.
*   **Financial Forecasting:** Predict market trends and investment opportunities.
*   **Supply Chain Optimization:** Identify potential disruptions and proactively adjust inventory levels.
*   **Scientific Discovery:**  Hypothesize new relationships and patterns based on existing knowledge.
