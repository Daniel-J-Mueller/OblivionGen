## Dynamic Aspect Ratio Correction via Environmental Context

**Core Concept:** Expand aspect ratio validation beyond facial feature analysis to incorporate environmental cues within the video itself, creating a dynamic, context-aware correction system. The patent focuses on detecting *if* an aspect ratio is wrong via faces. This moves to *understanding why* and correcting based on the scene.

**System Specifications:**

**1. Environmental Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Video stream.
*   **Process:** Utilize object detection and scene understanding AI models (e.g., YOLO, Detectron2, or similar) to identify prominent environmental features within each frame. Prioritize features with inherent dimensional characteristics:
    *   **Architectural Elements:** Doors, windows, staircases, standard building blocks.
    *   **Vehicles:** Cars, buses, trains (model-specific identification for known dimensions).
    *   **Street Furniture:** Traffic lights, street signs, bus stops (standardized sizes).
    *   **Sports Equipment:** Basketball hoops, soccer goals, tennis courts (known dimensions).
*   **Output:** List of detected objects with bounding boxes and confidence scores, coupled with pre-defined dimensional data (height, width, standard size ranges) for each object type.

**2. Dimensional Discrepancy Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Bounding box data from the Environmental Feature Extraction Module, pre-defined dimensional data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate the apparent dimensions of detected objects based on their bounding box size within the video frame.
    *   Compare the calculated dimensions to the known/expected dimensions for that object type.
    *   Calculate a “Dimensional Discrepancy Score” (DDS) for each object.  DDS = |Calculated Dimension - Expected Dimension| / Expected Dimension.
    *   Aggregate DDS scores across all detected objects in the frame (weighted by confidence score and object prominence).
*   **Output:**  An overall “Scene Aspect Ratio Deviation” (SARD) score for the frame.

**3. Dynamic Aspect Ratio Correction Engine:**

*   **Input:** SARD score, original video stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   If SARD exceeds a pre-defined threshold:
        *   Determine the most likely aspect ratio correction factor based on the dominant object types contributing to the high SARD. (e.g., If building elements consistently appear vertically compressed, apply a vertical stretch.)
        *   Apply a dynamic aspect ratio correction to the video stream in real-time. Utilize scaling, stretching, or shearing transformations.
    *   Implement a smoothing filter to prevent abrupt aspect ratio changes between frames.
    *   Optionally, utilize machine learning to refine the correction factors based on user feedback or ground truth data.
*   **Output:** Corrected video stream.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function correctAspectRatio(videoStream):
  for each frame in videoStream:
    objects = detectObjects(frame)
    totalDiscrepancy = 0
    for object in objects:
      calculatedDimension = calculateDimension(object.boundingBox)
      expectedDimension = getExpectedDimension(object.type)
      discrepancy = abs(calculatedDimension - expectedDimension) / expectedDimension
      totalDiscrepancy += discrepancy * object.confidence

    SARD = totalDiscrepancy / numberOfObjects

    if SARD > threshold:
      correctionFactor = calculateCorrectionFactor(SARD, dominantObjectTypes)
      correctedFrame = applyAspectRatioCorrection(frame, correctionFactor)
      output correctedFrame
    else:
      output frame
```

**Novelty:**

This system expands aspect ratio validation beyond human features to incorporate *environmental context*.  It moves from *detecting* errors to *understanding why* they exist and applying dynamic, scene-aware correction. This is particularly useful for archival footage, user-generated content, or videos with unclear provenance. The dynamic nature of the correction – adapting based on the scene – is a key differentiator.
