## Dynamic Contextual Wake-Up via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Augment the existing scheduled/unscheduled wake-up system with real-time biofeedback to anticipate user needs *before* scheduled events, and proactively adjust device state. This moves beyond simply responding to data transfer needs, to anticipating *why* the user might need data.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrated biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, potentially even subtle muscle tension via surface EMG) built into the mobile device chassis (grip, back panel). Data privacy is paramount – all processing is done locally on device unless explicitly user-authorized for external analysis.
*   **Biofeedback Data Processing:** On-device machine learning model (trained on anonymized datasets, customizable by user) to identify stress indicators, fatigue levels, or focus states.  Model output: a "cognitive load" score (0-100).
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** The system continually monitors cognitive load. It then projects future load based on learned patterns (time of day, location, calendar events – with user permission). This prediction feeds into a proactive wake-up system.
*   **Proactive Wake-Up Threshold:** A user-configurable threshold for “predicted cognitive load”. If the system predicts a load spike *before* any scheduled event, it initiates a short, targeted wake-up period.
*   **Targeted Data Prefetching:** During the proactive wake-up, the device prefetches data relevant to the *predicted* need. Example: high predicted load during commute = pre-download podcast episode; high predicted load during work meeting = pre-load presentation slides; high predicted load during exercise = start music playlist.  Prefetch is only performed if the device is connected to reliable Wi-Fi or cellular data.
*   **Wake-Up Duration:** Proactive wake-up periods are extremely short (seconds, not minutes), minimizing battery drain. The device returns to low-power mode immediately after prefetching the necessary data.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns from user behavior. If the user consistently overrides the proactive wake-up (e.g., ignores pre-downloaded content), the algorithm adjusts its thresholds and prediction models.
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Complete user control over biofeedback data collection and usage. Ability to disable biofeedback features entirely. Data is never shared without explicit consent.
*   **API:** Expose API for developers to integrate their apps with the biofeedback system. Developers can request specific data or trigger proactive wake-up actions based on app context.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Wake-Up Logic):**

```
// Main Loop
while (device is on) {
    biofeedbackData = getBiofeedbackData();
    cognitiveLoad = processBiofeedbackData(biofeedbackData);
    predictedCognitiveLoad = predictFutureCognitiveLoad(cognitiveLoad, time, location, calendarEvents);

    if (predictedCognitiveLoad > proactiveWakeUpThreshold) {
        //Initiate Proactive Wake-Up
        wakeUpDevice();
        prefetchData(predictedUserNeed());
        putDeviceToSleep();
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond passively reacting to data transfer needs, to *anticipating* user needs based on physiological signals. It blends scheduling with real-time biofeedback, creating a more intelligent and responsive device.  It is also a potential avenue to measure user 'flow' and optimize device states to minimize distraction.
