**Dynamic Property Graph Schemas with Automated Indexing & Type Inference**

**Specification:**

1.  **Core Concept:** Extend the described system to support *dynamic* property graphs where properties (and their associated data types) are not pre-defined. The system must infer data types *on ingestion* and automatically create/update indices accordingly.

2.  **Data Ingestion Pipeline:**

    *   Accept graph data in a flexible format (JSON, CSV, etc.).
    *   Initial Property Analysis: When a new property is encountered, the system samples a statistically significant number of values.
    *   Type Inference Engine: Employ a type inference algorithm (utilizing heuristics and potentially machine learning) to determine the most appropriate data type (Integer, Float, String, Boolean, Date, etc.).  The engine should also support complex types like Lists or Maps, if detected.
    *   Schema Update: Update a dynamic schema store with the new property and inferred data type.
    *   Index Creation:  Automatically create an index for the new property using the inferred data type.  Index type should be determined based on the data type (e.g., B-Tree for numeric types, Hash Index for strings).

3.  **Index Management:**

    *   Automated Updates: Continuously monitor incoming data for type inconsistencies. If a property’s data type changes significantly (e.g., a string property suddenly contains integers), the system should flag the issue, attempt to correct it (if possible), and update the index accordingly.
    *   Index Optimization: Implement a mechanism to analyze index usage patterns and optimize index types or structures for improved query performance.  This could involve automatically switching between B-Tree, Hash, or other index types based on query workloads.
    *   Versioning: Maintain a history of schema changes and index versions to support rollback and debugging.

4.  **Query Engine Integration:**

    *   Type-Aware Queries: The query engine should leverage the dynamic schema to perform type-safe queries. This prevents errors caused by incorrect data type comparisons.
    *   Dynamic Index Selection: The query optimizer should automatically select the appropriate index based on the query predicates and the property’s data type.
    *   Schema-on-Read:  The system should support "schema-on-read," meaning that the schema is applied at query time, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability.

5.  **Pseudocode – Type Inference Engine:**

```
function infer_data_type(property_values):
  sample_size = min(1000, len(property_values))
  sampled_values = random.sample(property_values, sample_size)

  integer_count = 0
  float_count = 0
  string_count = 0
  boolean_count = 0
  date_count = 0

  for value in sampled_values:
    try:
      int(value)
      integer_count += 1
    except ValueError:
      try:
        float(value)
        float_count += 1
      except ValueError:
        if isinstance(value, bool):
          boolean_count += 1
        elif is_date(value):
          date_count += 1
        else:
          string_count += 1

  type_counts = {
      "integer": integer_count,
      "float": float_count,
      "string": string_count,
      "boolean": boolean_count,
      "date": date_count
  }

  best_type = max(type_counts, key=type_counts.get)
  return best_type

function is_date(value):
  try:
    datetime.strptime(value, "%Y-%m-%d") # Example date format
    return True
  except ValueError:
    return False
```

6.  **Storage Considerations:**

    *   Utilize a flexible data storage format (e.g., document database or column-family store) that can accommodate schema changes without requiring major data migrations.
    *   Store the dynamic schema in a separate metadata store for easy access and modification.
    *   Implement data versioning to track schema changes and enable rollback to previous versions.
