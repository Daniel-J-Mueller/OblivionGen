## Personalized Recommendation "Echo" System

**Concept:** Extend the comparative A/B testing framework of the patent to create a dynamically adjusted recommendation “echo” – a system that anticipates user preference shifts *during* a session based on micro-interactions and subtly biases future recommendations accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Standard User Profile (as in patent - purchase history, demographics, etc.)
    *   Real-time User Activity: Clicks, dwell time on items, scrolling behavior, search queries *within* the current session.
    *   "Micro-Actions": Subtle user signals – mouse movements (hesitation over items), brief glances at items outside the main recommendation area (captured via eye-tracking if available, otherwise approximated via cursor position), slight page scrolling pauses.
*   **Core Module: "Preference Drift Detector":**
    *   Algorithm: Bayesian inference model.  Starts with a prior probability distribution reflecting the user’s long-term preferences.
    *   Real-time Update:  Each user action (standard & micro) incrementally updates the posterior probability distribution.  Larger weight given to recent actions.
    *   Drift Threshold:  A configurable threshold determines when a statistically significant shift in preference is detected.
*   **Recommendation Bias Engine:**
    *   Output: Modifies the scoring of candidate recommendations.  Increases the score for items aligning with detected preference drift, decreases score for items diverging.
    *   Bias Intensity: Dynamically adjusted.  Small bias for minor drift, larger bias for significant drift.  Bounded to prevent overly aggressive filtering.
    *   A/B Testing Integration: Continually A/B tests the performance of bias adjustments to refine the Bias Intensity algorithm.
*   **Recommendation Presentation:**
    *   Interleaved Presentation: Present recommendations from both the “control” (original) recommendation engine and the “test” (drift-adjusted) engine.
    *   Dynamic Weighting:  Adjust the proportion of recommendations from each engine based on the confidence in the detected drift.
*   **Pseudocode (Drift Detection & Bias Adjustment):**

```
// Initialize User Preference Model (Bayesian)
user_model = BayesianModel(user_profile)

// Main Loop (for each user action)
while (user is active) {
  action = get_user_action()

  // Update User Preference Model
  user_model.update(action)

  // Detect Preference Drift
  drift = user_model.detect_drift()

  if (drift > drift_threshold) {
    // Adjust Recommendation Scores
    candidate_recommendations = get_candidate_recommendations()
    for (recommendation in candidate_recommendations) {
      recommendation.score += drift_weight * (alignment(recommendation, user_model.current_preferences) - 0.5) // Scale alignment to -1 to +1
    }
  }

  // Get Top N Recommendations (using adjusted scores)
  recommendations = get_top_n(candidate_recommendations, n=10)

  // Display Recommendations (interleaved with control recommendations)
  display_recommendations(recommendations, control_recommendations)
}
```

*   **Additional Considerations:**
    *   Privacy: Anonymize micro-action data and provide users with control over data collection.
    *   Computational Cost: Optimize the Bayesian inference model for real-time performance.
    *   Cold Start: Utilize collaborative filtering or content-based filtering for new users or when limited data is available.
