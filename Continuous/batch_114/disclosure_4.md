## Predictive Windowing & Adaptive Aggregation

**Concept:** Enhance the streaming analytics system with predictive windowing and adaptive aggregation based on real-time data characteristics. Instead of fixed or sliding windows, the system *predicts* optimal window boundaries and *dynamically adjusts* aggregation functions based on incoming data patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Windowing Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream (with timestamps), Historical data (optional, for initial model training), Windowing prediction model.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilizes a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) trained on historical data (or initialized with a default model).
    *   Model predicts data volume/velocity changes within a defined prediction horizon.
    *   Based on predicted changes, dynamically adjusts window boundaries – windows can expand, contract, split, or merge.
    *   Prioritize windows with high entropy/variance, or those containing anomaly triggers.
    *   Output: Dynamic window definitions (start/end times, IDs) passed to Aggregation Control Module.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION predict_windows(data_stream, historical_data, prediction_horizon):
  // Load or train prediction model
  model = load_model(historical_data)

  // Predict data volume/velocity for prediction horizon
  predictions = model.predict(data_stream)

  // Calculate optimal window boundaries based on predictions
  window_definitions = calculate_window_boundaries(predictions)

  RETURN window_definitions
```

**2. Aggregation Control Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic window definitions, Data stream, Aggregation function library, Data characteristics.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyzes data characteristics *within each window* (e.g., data type distribution, value ranges, number of unique values).
    *   Selects the *most appropriate* aggregation function(s) from a pre-defined library *for that specific window*.
    *   Supports chained aggregation – multiple functions can be applied sequentially within a single window.
    *   Enables real-time adjustment of aggregation parameters (e.g., smoothing factors, threshold values).
    *   Output: Aggregated data for each window.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION select_aggregation_function(window_data, aggregation_library):
  // Analyze data characteristics within window
  data_characteristics = analyze_window_data(window_data)

  // Select aggregation function based on data characteristics
  selected_function = select_function_from_library(data_characteristics, aggregation_library)

  RETURN selected_function
```

**3. State Management Enhancement:**

*   Extend existing state management to store not only aggregation state but also metadata about the *applied aggregation function* for each window.
*   This allows for accurate reconstruction of results and debugging of aggregation logic.

**4.  System Integration:**

*   Integrate Predictive Windowing & Aggregation Control modules into the existing architecture.
*   Ensure compatibility with existing poller device and serverless function framework.
