**Personalized Synthetic Shopping Assistant with Proactive Intent Prediction**

**Concept:** Enhance the synthetic shopping session framework by integrating a proactive intent prediction module. Instead of *reacting* to synthetic utterances, the system will *anticipate* user needs based on learned behavioral patterns and contextual data. This moves beyond simple catalog queries to create a truly personalized and efficient shopping experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Module: Intent Prediction Engine (IPE)**
    *   Input: User profile data (purchase history, demographics, stated preferences), real-time contextual data (time of day, location – if permissible, trending products), synthetic session history.
    *   Process: A recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers trained on historical shopping session data (both real and synthetic). The RNN predicts the *next likely action* (intent) the user will take.  Output is a probability distribution over possible actions (e.g., “search for running shoes”, “add to cart”, “compare prices”, “read reviews”).
*   **Module: Synthetic Utterance Generator (SUG) - Modified**
    *   Input: Predicted intent from IPE, current product context, user profile.
    *   Process: The SUG now *proactively* generates a synthetic utterance representing the predicted intent. This utterance is then used as input to the catalog service. The generation process will prioritize natural language variations to avoid predictability and improve training data diversity.
    *   Output: Synthetic utterance.
*   **Catalog Service Interaction:**
    *   The catalog service receives both reactive utterances (user-initiated) and proactive utterances (IPE-generated).
    *   The catalog service logs the type of utterance (reactive/proactive) and the resulting action.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   The catalog service’s response to the proactive utterance is fed back to the IPE to refine the intent prediction model. This is a reinforcement learning process.
    *   If the catalog service determines the proactive utterance was inaccurate (e.g., no relevant results), a negative reward is assigned to the IPE, and the model adjusts accordingly.
*   **Data Augmentation:** The system will generate variations of both the initial user utterance and the proactive utterance, introducing minor changes in phrasing and vocabulary. This increases the diversity of the training data and improves the robustness of the catalog service.
*   **Performance Metrics:**
    *   **Proactive Accuracy:** Percentage of proactive utterances that result in a successful action (e.g., relevant product found, item added to cart).
    *   **Session Efficiency:** Reduction in the number of utterances required to complete a shopping task.
    *   **User Satisfaction:** (Measured through synthetic user modeling and A/B testing).
*   **Pseudocode (IPE):**

```
function predict_next_intent(user_profile, context, session_history):
    input_data = concatenate(user_profile, context, session_history)
    prediction = RNN(input_data)  // RNN with LSTM layers
    intent_probabilities = softmax(prediction)
    next_intent = argmax(intent_probabilities)
    return next_intent
```
*   **Scalability:** The IPE can be implemented as a distributed system to handle a large number of concurrent synthetic shopping sessions.
