**Biometric-Linked, Dynamically-Generated Shared Secrets & Temporal Access Control**

**Core Concept:** Replace static shared secrets with biometric-linked, dynamically generated secrets that expire after a short duration, combined with a temporal access control system. This drastically reduces the risk of compromised secrets and enables granular access control based on time and biometric confirmation.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Biometric Enrollment Module:**
    *   Supports multiple biometric modalities (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint).
    *   Securely stores biometric templates (hashed and salted) on a trusted hardware module (HSM).
*   **Dynamic Secret Generation Service:**
    *   Upon successful biometric authentication (against the HSM), generates a unique, high-entropy shared secret.
    *   Secret generation algorithm uses a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) seeded with biometric data (hash of the template) and a system-wide nonce.
    *   Secret has a limited Time-To-Live (TTL) â€“ configurable (e.g., 60 seconds to 5 minutes).
*   **Secure Communication Channels:**
    *   TLS 1.3 or higher for all communication between clients and services.
    *   End-to-end encryption using authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher suites.
*   **Access Control System:**
    *   Defines access policies based on:
        *   User Identity
        *   Biometric Confirmation
        *   Temporal Window (e.g., access only between 9 AM and 5 PM).
        *   Resource being accessed.
    *   Policy enforcement occurs *before* the one-time password (OTP) is generated.
*   **OTP Generation & Delivery:**
    *   If biometric authentication and access control policies are met, the server encrypts the OTP with the dynamically generated shared secret.
    *   Encrypted OTP is transmitted to the client device.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Client Request:** Client device initiates access request.
2.  **Biometric Authentication:** Client prompts user for biometric confirmation.
3.  **Template Transmission:** Client transmits biometric template to the server.
4.  **Template Verification:** Server verifies biometric template against the HSM.
5.  **Access Control Check:** Server evaluates access policies based on user identity, biometric confirmation, and time.
6.  **Dynamic Secret Generation:** If access is granted, the server generates a unique, high-entropy shared secret seeded with biometric data.
7.  **OTP Generation & Encryption:** The server generates an OTP and encrypts it using the dynamically generated shared secret.
8.  **Encrypted OTP Transmission:** The encrypted OTP is sent to the client.
9.  **OTP Decryption:** Client decrypts the OTP using the shared secret.
10. **Access Granted/Denied:** Client presents decrypted OTP (or a derived key) to the target service. Access is granted or denied based on OTP validation.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function authenticateAndGrantAccess(clientID, biometricTemplate):
    user = getUserByClientID(clientID)
    if not verifyBiometricTemplate(biometricTemplate, user.biometricTemplateHash):
        return ACCESS_DENIED

    if not checkAccessPolicies(user, currentTime):
        return ACCESS_DENIED

    sharedSecret = generateDynamicSharedSecret(user.biometricTemplateHash, systemNonce)
    otp = generateOneTimePassword()
    encryptedOTP = encrypt(otp, sharedSecret)

    return encryptedOTP, sharedSecret
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static shared secrets and OTPs by leveraging biometrics for dynamic secret generation and temporal access control. It increases security and enables more granular control over resource access. The combination of these factors creates a significant improvement over existing authentication methods.
