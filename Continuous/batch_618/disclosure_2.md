## Dynamic Constraint Relaxation via User Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the multi-objective ranking system to dynamically adjust constraint severity based on implicit and explicit user feedback, moving beyond a fixed upper bound. This introduces a 'preference learning' element into the ranking process.

**Specs:**

1.  **Feedback Signals:**
    *   **Explicit:** Implement a lightweight “preference slider” displayed *after* a ranking.  Users can indicate if the ranking prioritized "Relevance" or "Diversity" (or other defined secondary objectives) – a simple two-axis adjustment.
    *   **Implicit:** Track user dwell time on search results. Longer dwell times suggest higher satisfaction with a particular result *given* the ranking. Also track click-through rates.
2.  **Constraint Relaxation Function:**
    *   Introduce a ‘Relaxation Factor’ (RF) which modulates the constraint severity. RF ranges from 0.0 (fully relaxed – secondary objective entirely disregarded) to 1.0 (full constraint – original behavior).
    *   RF is updated after each search/feedback cycle.
    *   Update rule: `RF = base_RF + learning_rate * (user_preference - predicted_preference)`
        *   `base_RF` is a starting value (e.g., 0.8).
        *   `learning_rate` controls the speed of adaptation (e.g., 0.01).
        *   `user_preference` is a value derived from the explicit preference slider (0.0 to 1.0).
        *   `predicted_preference` is the system’s estimate of the user’s preference *based on* implicit feedback (dwell time, CTR) and a learned user profile.  This is the challenging part, requiring a separate model (e.g., a simple neural network).
3.  **Modified Optimization Problem:**
    *   The original optimization problem minimized the primary cost subject to a *fixed* constraint.
    *   Now, the constraint is multiplied by RF: `secondary_cost <= upper_bound * RF`.
    *   This allows the system to trade off primary objective performance for secondary objective satisfaction based on user preference.
4.  **Lagrangian Function Adaptation:**
    *   The Lagrangian function must be updated to reflect the modified constraint: `L = primary_cost + lambda * (secondary_cost - upper_bound * RF)`.

**Pseudocode (Updating the Model):**

```
function update_ranking_model(search_query, user_id, ranking_results, user_feedback):

    // 1. Get User Profile (if available)
    user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)

    // 2. Calculate User Preference from Feedback
    user_preference = calculate_user_preference(user_feedback, user_profile)

    // 3. Calculate Relaxation Factor
    RF = base_RF + learning_rate * (user_preference - predicted_preference)

    // 4. Modify Constraint
    modified_upper_bound = upper_bound * RF

    // 5. Calculate Lagrangian Function & Gradient (as before, using modified_upper_bound)

    // 6. Solve Optimization Problem (as before)

    // 7. Update Machine Learning Model (e.g., Gradient Boosting)

    // 8. Return Updated Model
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires a user interface component for gathering explicit feedback.
*   Requires a mechanism for storing user profiles and tracking implicit feedback.
*   Increased computational cost due to the dynamic constraint and preference learning.  This may require GPU acceleration.
*   The ‘predicted preference’ model could be hosted as a separate microservice.
