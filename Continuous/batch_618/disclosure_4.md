**Adaptive Entitlement Zones & Dynamic Permissioning**

**Concept:** Expanding on the proximity-based entitlement, introduce dynamically adjustable entitlement "zones" and permission levels tied to real-world locations and context.

**Specs:**

*   **Zone Definition:** Allow users to define geographical zones (radii, polygons, geofences) via a mobile application or web interface. Each zone will be associated with a specific permission level for a digital asset.
*   **Permission Levels:** Offer tiered permission levels. Examples:
    *   *View Only:* Access to view content, but not download or play.
    *   *Limited Play:* Access with a restricted play count or time limit.
    *   *Full Access:* Unrestricted access.
    *   *Family Mode:* Content filtering and restrictions.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate with location services, time of day, and potentially even environmental sensors (e.g., noise level, ambient light). Trigger permission level adjustments based on these factors. For example:
    *   "At home after 8 PM, grant full access to streaming service."
    *   "In a public space, limit volume and disable downloads."
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Implement a system for automatic permission level adjustments based on user behavior and predefined rules.  For instance, if a user repeatedly attempts to download content in a restricted zone, the system could temporarily revoke access.
*   **Entitlement "Hand-off"**: Allow a user to initiate a hand-off of their entitlement to another user within a defined zone.  (e.g. "My kids are in the car, enable access on their device").
*   **Shared Entitlement Pools:** Enable users to create "pools" of entitlement hours or play counts that can be shared among family members or friends.
*   **API Integration:**  Provide an API for developers to integrate adaptive entitlement functionality into their applications.

**Pseudocode (Permission Engine):**

```
FUNCTION evaluate_permission(user_id, asset_id, location, time, context)

  zones = get_zones_for_user(user_id)

  closest_zone = find_closest_zone(location, zones)

  base_permission = get_base_permission_for_asset(asset_id, user_id)

  IF closest_zone IS NOT NULL THEN
    adjusted_permission = apply_zone_rules(base_permission, closest_zone, time, context)
  ELSE
    adjusted_permission = base_permission // Default permission

  // Apply any additional global rules or restrictions
  final_permission = enforce_global_rules(adjusted_permission)

  RETURN final_permission
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION apply_zone_rules(base_permission, zone, time, context)
    IF zone.time_restrictions.is_active(time) THEN
        RETURN zone.time_permission
    END IF

    IF context.noise_level > zone.noise_threshold THEN
        RETURN zone.low_noise_permission
    END IF

    RETURN zone.default_permission
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Mobile app for zone definition and management.
*   Server-side entitlement engine.
*   Integration with location services (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons).
*   Secure storage of entitlement data and zone configurations.
*   Real-time event processing for location updates and context changes.
*   Secure communication protocols for data transmission.
