## Dynamic Sensory Augmentation based on Predicted Category

**Concept:** Extend the user experience beyond visual layout adjustments to incorporate dynamically adjusted *sensory* feedback – specifically, haptic and olfactory – based on predicted category. The existing system predicts categories; this builds on that prediction to engage more senses.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Integration:**
    *   Haptic Feedback Device: Integrated into user’s computing device (e.g., mouse, trackpad, wearable wristband, chair) capable of delivering variable intensity and texture simulations.
    *   Olfactory Diffuser: Miniature, localized olfactory diffuser integrated into the computing device or immediate surrounding environment (e.g., desk lamp, monitor base). Capable of emitting a range of pre-loaded scents. Must be digitally controlled and have rapid switching capabilities.

*   **Software Components:**
    *   Category-Sensory Mapping Database: A database linking predicted categories to specific haptic and olfactory profiles. Example:
        *   Apparel (Leather goods): Haptic – Rough, textured surface simulation. Olfactory – Leather scent.
        *   Books (Old/Antique): Haptic – Slightly rough, paper-like texture. Olfactory – Vanilla/Paper scent.
        *   Food (Citrus): Haptic – Smooth, slightly tacky. Olfactory – Citrus scent.
        *   Gardening: Haptic – Granular, earthy texture. Olfactory – Fresh cut grass/soil scent.
    *   Prediction Integration Module: Intercepts the category prediction from the existing system.
    *   Sensory Control Module: Translates predicted category into appropriate haptic and olfactory signals. Controls the hardware devices.
    *   User Preference Profiles: Allows users to customize sensory intensity levels and disable/enable certain sensory modalities.
    *   Adaptive Learning Engine: Uses user feedback (explicit ratings, dwell time, purchase behavior) to refine the category-sensory mappings over time.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
//On receiving category prediction from existing system:
Category = GetPredictedCategory()

//Retrieve sensory profile for category
SensoryProfile = GetSensoryProfile(Category)

//Adjust sensory output based on profile and user preferences:
HapticIntensity = SensoryProfile.HapticIntensity * UserPreferences.HapticIntensityScale
HapticTexture = SensoryProfile.HapticTexture

OlfactoryIntensity = SensoryProfile.OlfactoryIntensity * UserPreferences.OlfactoryIntensityScale
OlfactoryScent = SensoryProfile.OlfactoryScent

SetHapticDevice(Intensity = HapticIntensity, Texture = HapticTexture)
ActivateOlfactoryDiffuser(Scent = OlfactoryScent, Intensity = OlfactoryIntensity)

//Monitor user interaction and update sensory profile
OnUserInteraction(Event)
    //Collect data on user response
    UserData = CollectUserData(Event)

    //Update sensory profile based on user data (machine learning algorithm)
    UpdateSensoryProfile(SensoryProfile, UserData)
```

*   **System Architecture:** Existing system → Prediction Integration Module → Sensory Control Module → Haptic Device / Olfactory Diffuser
*   **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Integration with VR/AR environments for more immersive sensory experiences.
    *   Real-time generation of scents and textures based on product attributes (e.g., a specific type of wood for furniture).
    *   Personalized sensory experiences based on user biometric data (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance).
