## Dynamic Workflow Composition via Predictive Analysis

**Specification:** A system for proactively composing media processing workflows based on predicted user behavior and content characteristics. This builds upon the existing workflow injection capabilities by *anticipating* necessary modifications rather than reacting to explicit API calls.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Ingestion:** Collects user interaction data (viewing time, skip rates, resolution preferences, device type, geo-location) and content metadata (genre, actors, release date, source). This data is streamed into a feature store.

2.  **Predictive Model Training:** A machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or transformer) is trained on the historical behavioral and content data. The model predicts the probability of various workflow modifications being beneficial – e.g., the likelihood a user will benefit from a specific advertisement insertion, DRM level, or resolution upscale.  The model outputs a 'workflow modification score' for each potential modification.

3.  **Workflow Composition Engine:**
    *   Receives incoming media content and associated initial workflow.
    *   Queries the predictive model with content metadata as input.
    *   The model returns a ranked list of potential workflow modifications and associated scores.
    *   A threshold is applied to the scores. Modifications exceeding the threshold are *automatically* injected into the workflow.
    *   The composed workflow is then executed.

4.  **Feedback Loop:** User interaction data from the executed workflow is fed back into the feature store to retrain and refine the predictive model.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Composition Engine):**

```
function compose_workflow(media_content, initial_workflow):
  content_metadata = extract_metadata(media_content)
  modification_scores = predict_workflow_modifications(content_metadata) // Query ML Model

  modified_workflow = initial_workflow

  for modification, score in modification_scores:
    if score > threshold:
      inject_modification(modified_workflow, modification)

  return modified_workflow
```

**Potential Modifications (examples for ML model):**

*   **Advertisement Insertion:** Predict optimal ad frequency and placement.
*   **DRM Level:** Dynamically adjust DRM strength based on content sensitivity and user history.
*   **Resolution Upscaling:** Trigger upscale if the user’s device and viewing habits suggest it.
*   **Content Tagging:** Add dynamic metadata tags for personalized recommendations.
*   **Watermarking:** Apply unique, personalized watermarks.
*   **Error Correction:** Enable or disable aggressive error correction based on network conditions.
*   **Audio Normalization:** Dynamically adjust audio levels.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The ML model should be deployed as a microservice for independent scaling.
*   Caching should be implemented for frequently accessed content metadata.
*   The workflow injection mechanism should be optimized for low latency.
