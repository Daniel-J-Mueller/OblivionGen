## Dynamic Threshold Propagation with Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Expand the adaptive thresholding idea by introducing predictive scaling based on historical request patterns *across* all servers, rather than just pairwise comparison. This aims to proactively adjust thresholds *before* congestion, minimizing rejections and maximizing resource utilization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Global Request History Database:**

*   **Data Points:** Timestamp, Server ID, Request Queue Length, Request Processing Time, Request Type (categorized â€“ e.g., read, write, complex calculation).
*   **Storage:** Distributed time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) for scalability and efficient querying.
*   **Retention Policy:** 30-day rolling window.  Data aggregated into hourly summaries for long-term trend analysis.

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid approach:
    *   **Time Series Decomposition:**  Identify seasonality, trends, and residual noise in request volume.  (e.g., using STL decomposition)
    *   **Machine Learning Model (Recurrent Neural Network - LSTM):** Trained on historical data to predict future request volume per server, taking into account time of day, day of week, and request type.  Separate model per server initially, but with potential for model sharing based on similarity of request patterns.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** 5-minute granularity, predicting up to 15 minutes into the future.
*   **Update Frequency:** Model retrained daily with the latest data.

**3. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Logic:**

*   **Base Threshold:** Each server maintains a base queue threshold.
*   **Predicted Load Factor:** Calculate a predicted load factor for each server:  (Predicted Request Volume / Server Capacity).
*   **Threshold Adjustment Formula:**
    *   New Threshold = Base Threshold + (Base Threshold * Predicted Load Factor * Adjustment Factor).
    *   Adjustment Factor:  A configurable parameter (0.0 - 1.0) controlling the aggressiveness of the threshold adjustment.  Adjustable globally or per server.
*   **Smoothing:** Apply exponential smoothing to the adjusted threshold to prevent rapid fluctuations.
*   **Maximum Threshold:** Define a maximum threshold to prevent excessive resource allocation.

**4. Inter-Server Communication:**

*   **Protocol:**  gRPC or similar for efficient, bidirectional communication.
*   **Information Exchange:**
    *   Each server broadcasts its *predicted* request volume and adjusted threshold to a central coordination service.
    *   The coordination service aggregates this information and disseminates it to all servers.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitor actual request queue lengths and processing times.  Adjust the Adjustment Factor dynamically based on prediction accuracy. If predictions consistently underestimate load, increase the Adjustment Factor.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
// Initialization
baseThreshold = <configured value>
adjustmentFactor = <initial value>

// Every Prediction Interval (e.g., 1 minute)
predictedRequestVolume = PredictiveModel.predict()
adjustedThreshold = baseThreshold + (baseThreshold * predictedRequestVolume * adjustmentFactor)
adjustedThreshold = exponentialSmoothing(adjustedThreshold) // Prevent oscillations
adjustedThreshold = min(adjustedThreshold, maxThreshold) // Cap the threshold

broadcast(predictedRequestVolume, adjustedThreshold)

// On receiving threshold information from other servers:
updateGlobalLoadMap(serverID, adjustedThreshold)

// When a request arrives:
if (requestQueueLength > adjustedThreshold) {
    rejectRequest()
} else {
    processRequest()
}

// Continuous Monitoring:
calculatePredictionAccuracy()
adjustAdjustmentFactorBasedOnAccuracy()
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Integrate anomaly detection algorithms to identify unexpected spikes in request volume or server failures.
*   **Cost Optimization:**  Account for server costs when adjusting thresholds.  Balance performance with resource utilization.
*   **Prioritization:**  Implement request prioritization to ensure critical requests are processed even during periods of high load.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Conduct A/B testing to optimize the Adjustment Factor and other parameters.
