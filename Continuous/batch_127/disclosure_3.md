## Automated Directory Attribute Propagation & Dynamic Policy Adjustment

**Specification:** A system for proactively mirroring select user attributes across linked directories and dynamically adjusting access policies based on detected attribute changes.

**Core Concept:** Expanding on the cross-directory authentication, introduce a mechanism to not just *enable* access but to *contextualize* it. Instead of simply granting access based on group membership, the system will actively propagate a subset of user attributes (e.g., job title, security clearance, project assignments) from the contractor's directory to the first service's directory in near real-time.  This allows the first service to make more granular access control decisions *without* requiring full directory synchronization or maintaining redundant data. Additionally, define 'reaction' policies which define behavior triggered by specific attribute changes.

**Components:**

*   **Attribute Mirroring Engine:**  Responsible for identifying and replicating designated attributes. Configuration driven, allowing administrators to specify which attributes to mirror and the mirroring frequency.
*   **Reaction Policy Engine:** Defines rules that trigger actions based on attribute changes. Actions could include:
    *   Automatic group membership updates in the first directory.
    *   Dynamic adjustment of resource access permissions.
    *   Alerting and logging.
*   **Change Detection Module:** Monitors the contractor's directory for attribute changes.
*   **API Gateway:** Handles communication between the components and provides a secure interface for configuration and monitoring.
*   **Event Queue:**  Asynchronous communication to prevent delays in attribute propagation.

**Pseudocode (Reaction Policy):**

```
// Policy Definition (JSON format)
{
  "policy_id": "high_security_access",
  "trigger_attribute": "security_clearance",
  "trigger_value": "top_secret",
  "action_type": "group_add",
  "target_group": "restricted_access_group",
  "actor_directory": "contractor_directory"
}

//Execution Logic:
function handleAttributeChange(user_id, attribute_name, new_value, directory_source){
  //1. Retrieve matching policies.
  policies = getPolicies(attribute_name, new_value, directory_source);
  //2. For each policy:
  for each policy in policies:
    if policy.action_type == "group_add":
      addGroupMembership(user_id, policy.target_group);
    else if policy.action_type == "permission_update":
      updateResourcePermissions(user_id, policy.resource_id, policy.new_permissions);
    //… other action types
  end for
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Change Detection Module detects an attribute change in the contractor's directory.
2.  The change is sent to the Event Queue.
3.  The Attribute Mirroring Engine retrieves the changed attribute value.
4.  The Reaction Policy Engine evaluates active policies.
5.  If a policy is triggered, the corresponding action is executed in the first service's directory.
6.  All events are logged for auditing and monitoring.

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   Utilize a distributed message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for reliable event delivery.
*   Implement caching mechanisms to reduce load on directory servers.
*   Design the system to handle concurrent attribute changes.
*   Employ load balancing and redundancy to ensure high availability.

**Novelty:**

This system shifts from passive authentication to *active contextualization*.  It doesn’t just *allow* access; it *adjusts* access based on the current state of the user in their native directory, greatly improving security and simplifying access management.  This allows the first service to trust the contractor’s directory as a source of truth for specific attributes, avoiding the need for redundant data storage or complex synchronization processes.
