## Dynamic CDN Selection via Client-Reported Application-Level Metrics

**Specification:**

This system expands upon dynamic CDN selection by incorporating application-level performance metrics reported *directly* from client applications, augmenting traditional network metrics. The core idea is to move beyond simply optimizing for raw latency/throughput and to tailor CDN selection to the *specific* experience of the application running on the client.

**Components:**

1.  **Client SDK:** A lightweight SDK embedded within client applications (web browsers, mobile apps, etc.). This SDK will:
    *   Periodically measure application-specific metrics (e.g., time to first meaningful paint, frames per second in a game, transaction completion time, video buffering ratio, rendering time).
    *   Report these metrics, along with a network identifier (IP/ASN), to a metric aggregation service.
    *   Include a unique client ID for tracking consistency.
2.  **Metric Aggregation & Transformation Service:**
    *   Receives application-level and network-level metrics from clients.
    *   Aggregates metrics by CDN, location (derived from IP/ASN), application type, and potentially client device characteristics.
    *   Transforms raw metrics into a standardized “Application Experience Score” (AES). This score should be weighted based on the importance of each metric for the specific application type. (e.g. Gaming AES weights FPS heavily, e-commerce AES weights transaction time).
    *   Stores AES data in a time-series database.
3.  **DNS Resolution Service:** An enhanced DNS server that integrates with the Metric Aggregation Service.
    *   Receives DNS queries with network identifiers (IP/ASN).
    *   Queries the Metric Aggregation Service for the AES data corresponding to the client’s location, application type, and available CDNs.
    *   Selects the CDN with the highest AES for the given client.
    *   Returns the appropriate DNS record for the selected CDN.
4. **Application Type Classification:** The system will need to identify the application type. This could be done by examining the requesting domain or through specific headers in the DNS request.

**Pseudocode (DNS Resolution Service):**

```
function resolveDNSQuery(dnsQuery, networkIdentifier) {
  applicationType = identifyApplicationType(dnsQuery)
  location = resolveLocationFromNetworkIdentifier(networkIdentifier)

  cdnScores = metricAggregationService.getCdnScores(location, applicationType) // Returns a map of CDN -> AES

  bestCdn = findCdnWithHighestScore(cdnScores)

  return bestCdn.dnsRecord
}

function findCdnWithHighestScore(cdnScores) {
  bestCdn = null
  highestScore = -1

  for (cdn, score in cdnScores) {
    if (score > highestScore) {
      highestScore = score
      bestCdn = cdn
    }
  }

  return bestCdn
}
```

**Data Model:**

*   **Client Metric:** `{clientId, timestamp, networkIdentifier, applicationType, metricName, metricValue}`
*   **CDN Performance Data:** `{cdnId, location, applicationType, averageAES, latency, throughput, errorRate}`

**Novelty:**

Traditional CDN selection focuses on network-level metrics. This system actively incorporates application-level experience, allowing for a *far* more nuanced and user-centric optimization.  It moves beyond “fastest network” to “best experience for *this* application, on *this* device, in *this* location”.
