## Adaptive Sensory Substitution for Narrative Immersion

**Concept:** Extend spoiler prevention beyond text/visual/audio suppression to *actively substitute* sensory information with non-revealing equivalents, creating a personalized “safe” experience without outright blocking content. This is aimed at immersive media – VR/AR experiences, interactive fiction, games – where simple suppression isn’t enough.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** 'Sensory Firewall'. Operates as a middleware layer within the application/experience.
*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Accesses application's scene graph/asset loading pipeline.
    *   Monitors user gaze/focus (VR/AR) or interaction points (games/interactive fiction).
    *   Receives user profile data – previously accessed content (as defined in the provided patent), preferred sensory substitution modes, sensitivity levels.
*   **Spoiler Detection Engine:**
    *   Extends existing spoiler data analysis (alphanumeric, audio, image, video) to analyze 3D models, environmental lighting, and procedural generation parameters.
    *   Employs AI-driven object/event recognition to identify potentially revealing elements within the scene.
*   **Sensory Substitution Library:**
    *   Provides a library of non-revealing sensory equivalents:
        *   **Visual:**  Replace critical objects/characters with abstract shapes, color fields, or blurred representations. Replace textures with procedural noise. Modify lighting to flatten shadows and reduce detail.
        *   **Audio:**  Replace character dialogue with ambient sounds. Replace specific sound effects with generic equivalents. Alter pitch/tempo to obfuscate emotional cues.
        *   **Haptic (VR/AR):**  Replace detailed haptic feedback with broad vibration patterns. Substitute specific textures with uniform pressure.
        *   **Environmental:**  Modify weather effects (e.g., dense fog), introduce visual distortions (e.g., chromatic aberration), or adjust ambient lighting to obscure specific areas.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:**
    *   Based on user gaze/interaction, the Sensory Firewall dynamically swaps potentially revealing assets with their non-revealing equivalents in real-time.
    *   The level of substitution is determined by:
        *   User sensitivity level.
        *   Confidence of the spoiler detection engine.
        *   Contextual relevance (e.g., if the user is actively avoiding spoilers for a specific character, substitution is more aggressive).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function processScene(sceneGraph) {
  for each object in sceneGraph {
    if (spoilerDetectionEngine.isSpoiler(object)) {
      replacementObject = generateReplacementObject(object, userProfile);
      sceneGraph.replaceObject(object, replacementObject);
    }
  }
}

function generateReplacementObject(originalObject, userProfile) {
  switch (userProfile.preferredSubstitutionMode) {
    case "visual":
      return createAbstractShape(originalObject.boundingVolume);
    case "audio":
      return createAmbientSound(originalObject.audioProfile);
    case "haptic":
      return createUniformVibration(originalObject.hapticProfile);
    default:
      return createBlurredRepresentation(originalObject);
  }
}
```

**Additional Features:**

*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define their own substitution preferences (e.g., preferred colors, soundscapes, haptic patterns).
*   **Narrative Integration:**  Frame the substitution process as a deliberate aesthetic choice within the experience (e.g., the user character is wearing a visual filter, experiencing a sensory deprivation condition).
*   **Community Sharing:** Allow users to share their custom substitution profiles with others.
