## Dynamic Prism Array with Polarization Control

**Concept:** Expand the field of view *and* introduce selective light filtering via a dynamically adjustable prism array combined with polarization control layers.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) based prism array.  Individual prisms are hexagonal in cross-section, approximately 1mm diameter, with tilt/rotation controlled by integrated actuators.
*   **Array Configuration:**  Instead of static columns/rows, prisms are arranged in a hexagonal close-packed lattice, covering a circular area approximately 5cm diameter. This allows for more uniform light distribution and greater control over the expanded field of view.
*   **Prism Material:**  Bismuth Germanate (BGO) or similar high-refractive index material.  The material is crucial for achieving the desired light bending.
*   **Polarization Layers:** Two layers of switchable liquid crystal polarization film. One layer is positioned *before* the prism array (closest to the lens) and the other *after* (closest to the image sensor). Each pixel in these layers can independently switch between transmitting horizontal, vertical, or circular polarization.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated processor manages the MEMS actuators and polarization layers. The processor runs algorithms to optimize the field of view, correct for distortion, and perform selective light filtering.
*   **Algorithm Focus:** Three core algorithms:
    1.  **FOV Expansion & Correction:**  Analyzes scene data (from a preliminary image) and adjusts prism tilt/rotation to expand the field of view while minimizing geometric distortion.
    2.  **Selective Light Filtering:** Uses polarization control to filter specific wavelengths or polarization states, enhancing contrast, reducing glare, or identifying specific materials.
    3.  **Dynamic Focus Adjustment:**  Adjusts prism tilt/rotation to dynamically modify the focal plane, creating a pseudo-depth-of-field effect or focusing on objects at different distances.
*   **Power Requirements:**  Low-voltage DC power supply. Estimated power consumption: 5W (peak), 1W (idle).
*   **Communication Interface:**  USB-C for data transfer and control.  Support for standard image and video protocols.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm â€“ FOV Expansion & Correction):**

```
// Input: Raw image from camera, desired FOV angle
// Output: Prism tilt/rotation angles for each prism

function expandFOV(rawImage, desiredFOV):
  // 1. Feature Detection: Identify key features in the raw image (e.g., edges, corners).
  features = detectFeatures(rawImage)

  // 2. Distortion Mapping: Create a map of geometric distortion based on feature positions.
  distortionMap = createDistortionMap(features)

  // 3. Prism Optimization: For each prism in the array:
  for each prism in prismArray:
    // Calculate the required light bending angle to correct for distortion in the prism's area.
    requiredAngle = calculateBendingAngle(distortionMap, prism.position)

    // Adjust prism tilt/rotation to achieve the required angle.
    prism.tilt(requiredAngle)

  // 4. Refine Adjustment: Repeat steps 2-3 iteratively to minimize distortion and achieve the desired FOV.

  return prismArray
```

**Innovation:** This system goes beyond simply expanding the field of view. The combination of MEMS-controlled prisms and dynamic polarization control allows for *active* control over light, enabling selective filtering, distortion correction, and even pseudo-depth-of-field effects. This has applications in surveillance, scientific imaging, and augmented reality.
