## Electronic Device - Haptic Projection System

**Concept:** An electronic device incorporating localized haptic feedback *projected* onto the user’s skin via focused ultrasound, creating the illusion of textures, shapes, and even forces without physical contact. This expands beyond simple vibration; it aims for high-fidelity tactile experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Form Factor:** Sleek, handheld device roughly 150mm x 75mm x 10mm, with a smooth, curved surface. Material: Aluminum alloy with a matte finish.
*   **Ultrasound Array:** 64x64 phased array of micro-ultrasonic transducers (frequency range: 20kHz - 80kHz). Transducers are individually addressable. Array size: 50mm x 50mm.
*   **Focusing Mechanism:** Digital beamforming with real-time adjustment of phase and amplitude for each transducer. Minimum focal spot size: 2mm diameter.
*   **Depth Control:** Software-adjustable focal depth range: 2mm – 10mm.
*   **Haptic Resolution:** Target resolution of 100 “pixels” (focal points) across the 50mm x 50mm array.
*   **Power Source:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (3000mAh) providing 4 hours of continuous operation.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded ARM Cortex-A72 quad-core processor with dedicated DSP for ultrasound signal processing.
*   **Input Method:** Capacitive touch sensor for gesture control and menu navigation.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0 for wireless communication with other devices.
*   **Safety Features:** Automatic power shut-off if the device is held too close to the skin for extended periods. Real-time monitoring of ultrasound intensity to ensure safe exposure levels.

**Innovation Details:**

1.  **Haptic "Palette":** The device features a software-defined "haptic palette" allowing users to create and save custom tactile textures and sensations.  This isn't just vibration intensity.  The software allows specification of:
    *   Spatial frequency (how rapidly the texture changes across the focal array)
    *   Amplitude modulation (varying the ultrasound intensity over time to create dynamic effects)
    *   Phase modulation (introducing time delays to create the illusion of movement)

2.  **Dynamic Texture Mapping:**
    *   Input: A 2D image or 3D model.
    *   Process: The software analyzes the image/model and converts it into a series of ultrasound focal point instructions.  Brighter pixels/higher surfaces translate to higher ultrasound intensity. Edges and contours are emphasized through rapid spatial frequency changes.
    *   Output:  The phased array creates a dynamic tactile representation of the image/model projected onto the user’s skin.

3.  **Force Feedback Simulation:**
    *   By rapidly scanning the ultrasound focal points across a small area of the skin, the device creates the illusion of pressure and force.
    *   Algorithm:  A "virtual spring" model where the amount of "force" is determined by the distance between the virtual spring and the user's skin. The further the skin "moves", the stronger the ultrasound intensity.
    *   Use case: Simulating the feel of pressing buttons, interacting with virtual objects, or receiving impacts.

4.  **Multi-User Synchronization:**  The ability to synchronize multiple devices to create a shared haptic experience. For example, two users could "shake hands" virtually through coordinated ultrasound projection. Requires a low-latency communication protocol.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Texture Mapping):**

```
function generateHapticMap(image):
  height = image.height
  width = image.width
  hapticMap = empty array 64x64

  for x in range(width):
    for y in range(height):
      pixelValue = image.getPixel(x, y)

      // Normalize pixel value to ultrasound intensity (0-100%)
      intensity = pixelValue * 100

      // Map pixel coordinates to transducer array coordinates
      transducerX = int(x * 64 / width)
      transducerY = int(y * 64 / height)

      // Set ultrasound intensity for the corresponding transducer
      hapticMap[transducerX][transducerY] = intensity

  return hapticMap

function projectHapticMap(hapticMap):
  for x in range(64):
    for y in range(64):
      setTransducerIntensity(x, y, hapticMap[x][y])
```
