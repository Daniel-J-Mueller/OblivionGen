## Adaptive Data Tiling with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Enhance data access efficiency by dynamically adjusting data tiling sizes based on predicted computational needs *within* the processing array, coupled with a predictive prefetching mechanism that anticipates data requirements before they are explicitly requested. This builds on the row-wise data selection but introduces spatial and temporal adaptation.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Tiling Unit (DTU):**  A hardware module integrated into each row of the processing engine array. The DTU manages a local tile cache and dynamically adjusts tile size based on input feature map characteristics and computational load.
*   **Feature Map Analyzer (FMA):**  A small, dedicated processor that analyzes incoming feature maps for spatial redundancy and patterns (e.g., large homogenous regions, edges). It outputs a 'tiling profile' indicating optimal tile dimensions for the current feature map.
*   **Computational Load Monitor (CLM):** Monitors the activity of processing engines within each row.  It identifies areas of high or low computational load, signaling the DTU to adjust tile sizes – smaller tiles for areas with high variance, larger tiles for homogenous areas.
*   **Predictive Prefetch Engine (PPE):**  A hardware module that predicts future data requirements based on:
    *   The current tiling profile.
    *   The CLM data – anticipating data needs for areas that are about to become computationally active.
    *   A historical data access pattern database – leveraging previously observed patterns to anticipate future requests.
*   **Inter-Row Communication Network (IRCN):** A high-bandwidth network connecting DTUs across rows, facilitating data sharing and prefetching coordination.
*   **Memory Interface Enhancement:** The memory controller is modified to support streaming data requests based on the PPE's prefetch predictions.

**Pseudocode (DTU Operation):**

```
Function ProcessIncomingFeatureMap(featureMap, tilingProfile):
    tileWidth = tilingProfile.width
    tileHeight = tilingProfile.height

    For each tile in featureMap:
        Load tile into local cache
        // Adaptive sizing based on CLM input
        currentLoad = CLM.GetLoadForTile(tile)
        If currentLoad > threshold:
            tileWidth = tileWidth / 2
            tileHeight = tileHeight / 2
        End If

        Dispatch tile to processing engines in row
    End For
End Function

Function ReceivePrefetchRequest(tileData, tileID):
    Store tileData in local cache with tileID
End Function
```

**Operation:**

1.  The FMA analyzes incoming feature maps and generates a tiling profile.
2.  The DTU uses this profile to initially tile the data.
3.  The CLM monitors computational load within each row.  Based on this information, the DTU dynamically adjusts tile sizes *during* computation, optimizing data locality and reducing memory access latency.
4.  The PPE uses the tiling profile, CLM data, and historical access patterns to predict future data needs. It prefetches data to the DTU's local cache, reducing the time required to access data when it is requested by the processing engines.
5.  The IRCN facilitates data sharing between rows, enabling efficient prefetching and load balancing.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced memory access latency.
*   Improved data locality.
*   Increased computational throughput.
*   Enhanced energy efficiency.
*   Adaptability to diverse neural network architectures and datasets.
