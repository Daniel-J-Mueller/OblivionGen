## Adaptive Chunk Size & Priority Queue for Real-Time Video Analysis

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust video chunk size based on content complexity *and* prioritize analysis requests based on a scoring system incorporating requestor priority *and* estimated processing time. This moves beyond static chunking and simple FIFO queues.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Complexity Analyzer:** A lightweight, pre-processing module. It operates on each video segment *before* chunking, evaluating visual complexity (motion, scene changes, object density) and assigning a ‘complexity score’.
*   **Dynamic Chunking Module:** This module receives the video stream and the complexity score.  It employs the following logic:
    *   If complexity score < threshold_low:  Large chunk size (e.g., 5 seconds).  Faster processing, less overhead.
    *   If threshold_low <= complexity score <= threshold_high: Medium chunk size (e.g., 2 seconds).  Balanced approach.
    *   If complexity score > threshold_high: Small chunk size (e.g., 0.5 seconds).  High precision, more processing.
*   **Priority Queue:** A multi-level priority queue.  Each request is assigned a priority score calculated as: `Priority = (RequestorPriorityWeight * RequestorPriority) + (EstimatedProcessingTimeWeight * EstimatedProcessingTime)`.
    *   *RequestorPriority:*  A value assigned to each user/application submitting a request. Higher values indicate higher priority.
    *   *EstimatedProcessingTime:*  Estimated time to process the chunk, based on its size and the selected analysis actions.
*   **Request Scheduler:**  A module that selects requests from the priority queue and assigns them to available chunk processors.
*   **Aggregator:**  Combines the results from chunk processors.

**III. Pseudocode (Request Scheduler):**

```
function schedule_requests() {
  while (requests_in_queue()) {
    request = get_highest_priority_request()
    chunk = request.video_chunk
    analysis_actions = request.analysis_actions

    if (chunk_processor_available()) {
      processor = get_available_processor()
      send_chunk_to_processor(chunk, analysis_actions, processor)
    } else {
      //If no processor available, add request back to the queue (with adjusted priority)
      request.priority = request.priority * 0.95 // Demote slightly
      add_request_to_queue(request)
      sleep(0.1) // brief pause
    }
  }
}
```

**IV.  Novelty & Refinement:**

*   **Adaptive Chunking:**  Unlike the static chunking in the provided patent, this system dynamically adjusts chunk size to improve processing efficiency and accuracy.  More complex segments receive smaller chunks for detailed analysis, while simpler segments benefit from larger chunks.
*   **Priority Queue Scoring:**  The scoring system combines requestor priority with estimated processing time. This ensures that high-priority requests *and* quick-to-process requests are given preference.
*   **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:** Requests that cannot be immediately processed have their priority subtly reduced, preventing indefinite stalling and allowing newer requests to potentially jump ahead.
*   **Integration with Machine Learning:** The complexity analyzer can utilize a lightweight machine learning model to predict segment complexity, improving accuracy and automation.
*   **Potential for Real-Time Applications:** This system is designed for low-latency applications such as real-time video surveillance or live event analysis.
