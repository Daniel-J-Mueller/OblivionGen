## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Holography

**Concept:** Extend directional audio separation beyond simple source localization to reconstruct a full "acoustic hologram" of the surrounding environment, capturing not just *where* sounds originate, but also the reflections and reverberations that define the acoustic space. This goes beyond separating speech; it's about recreating the sonic environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 8, optimally 16+ microphones arranged in a spherical or hemispherical configuration. Higher density provides finer spatial resolution. Microphones should be phase-matched and calibrated.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Sample rate: 96kHz or higher. Bit depth: 24-bit or higher.  Synchronized data acquisition across all microphones is crucial.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance CPU/GPU cluster. Real-time processing is desirable, but a computationally intensive post-processing pipeline is acceptable for initial prototypes.
*   **Algorithm Core: Temporal Holography**
    1.  **Beamforming & Delay Estimation:**  Perform conventional beamforming to determine the Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) between each microphone pair for a given frequency band. Expand upon this by modeling sound as a wavefront and resolving phases.
    2.  **Wavefront Reconstruction:** Instead of simply assigning sound to a direction, model the sound as a wavefront propagating from a source. Use TDOA data to estimate the wavefrontâ€™s shape (curvature, amplitude, phase) at a grid of points in 3D space.
    3.  **Reflectivity Mapping:**  Analyze the reconstructed wavefronts to identify surfaces that contribute to reflections.  This requires identifying abrupt changes in wavefront direction and amplitude.  Employ a ray-tracing algorithm to simulate sound propagation and identify potential reflection points.
    4.  **Temporal Coherence Analysis:** Track the temporal coherence of the reconstructed wavefronts. This allows for the separation of direct sounds from reverberations and echoes. A coherence threshold will be defined to separate relevant data.
    5.  **Acoustic Scene Map Creation:**  Generate a 3D map of the acoustic environment, representing both direct sound sources and reflective surfaces. The map will include information about sound intensity, direction, and temporal coherence.
    6.  **Dynamic Map Updating:** Implement a Kalman filter or particle filter to dynamically update the acoustic scene map as the soundscape changes.
*   **Output:** 3D volumetric rendering of the acoustic scene. User interface for manipulating the viewpoint and visualizing the soundscape. Ability to isolate and enhance specific sound sources or reflections.
*   **Software/Libraries:**
    *   Python with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.
    *   Beamforming libraries (e.g., Pyroomacoustics).
    *   Ray-tracing libraries (e.g., Blender's ray-tracing engine).
    *   3D visualization libraries (e.g., Mayavi, VTK).
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Integration with computer vision to map visual objects to acoustic reflections.
    *   Use of machine learning to identify and classify acoustic events.
    *   Development of a personalized acoustic environment for virtual reality applications.
    *   Implement a method for reconstructing sound events occurring *behind* the microphone array using reflections.
    *   Multi-modal input: fuse audio and visual data for a more accurate reconstruction of the acoustic scene.
