## Haptic-Guided UI Element Anchoring & Projection

**Concept:** Expand the magnetic-force UI control to incorporate localized haptic feedback *and* a projection system that visually anchors UI elements to real-world surfaces, creating a mixed-reality interaction paradigm.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Device with accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer (as per the base patent).
    *   Miniature haptic actuators (piezoelectric or similar) arrayed around the deviceâ€™s edges, capable of generating localized vibrations.
    *   Low-power pico-projector capable of projecting a crisp, focused image onto nearby surfaces.  Resolution: 720p minimum. Luminosity: 50 Lumens minimum.
    *   Depth sensor (time-of-flight or structured light) to map nearby surfaces.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Surface Mapping Module:**  Utilizes the depth sensor to create a real-time mesh of surfaces within a defined radius (e.g., 1 meter).
    *   **Projection Calibration Module:** Automatically calibrates the projection system to account for surface angles and distortions. This module will utilize machine learning to improve mapping over time.
    *   **Haptic Force Mapping Module:**  Translates the simulated magnetic forces (from the base patent) into localized haptic feedback patterns. Stronger forces = stronger vibrations.  Different directions = different vibration locations.
    *   **UI Element Projection Module:**  Renders UI elements as 2D or 3D projections onto mapped surfaces. These projections are dynamically updated based on device movement and user interaction.
    *   **Interaction Module:**  Combines haptic feedback, projected UI elements, and device movement to create a seamless interaction experience.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Module):**

```
function handleDeviceMovement(accelerationX, accelerationY, accelerationZ):
    //Calculate simulated magnetic forces based on movement (as per original patent)
    forceX, forceY = calculateMagneticForces(accelerationX, accelerationY)

    //Translate forces into haptic patterns
    hapticPattern = generateHapticPattern(forceX, forceY)
    activateHapticActuators(hapticPattern)

    //Update UI element position based on forces and device movement
    newUIElementPosition = calculateNewUIElementPosition(UIElementPosition, forceX, forceY, deviceMovement)

    //Project UI element onto mapped surface at new position
    projectUIElement(newUIElementPosition, mappedSurface)
```

**Operation:**

1.  The depth sensor continuously maps the surrounding environment.
2.  The device detects physical movement.
3.  The system calculates simulated magnetic forces as in the original patent.
4.  These forces are translated into both haptic feedback (localized vibrations) *and* UI element position updates.
5.  The pico-projector projects the UI element onto the nearest mapped surface at the calculated position.
6.  The user experiences the UI element as if it were physically anchored to the real world, with haptic feedback reinforcing the sensation of force and movement.

**Novelty:**

This system combines the dynamic UI control of the original patent with haptic feedback and real-world projection to create a truly immersive and intuitive mixed-reality experience. It moves beyond simply controlling UI elements on a screen and allows users to interact with them as if they were tangible objects in their physical environment.
