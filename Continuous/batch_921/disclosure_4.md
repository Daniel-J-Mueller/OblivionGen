## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Behavioral Prediction

**Concept:** Extend resource utilization monitoring to *proactively* allocate resources based on predicted behavioral patterns of submitted code, rather than reacting to current usage. This moves beyond detection to preemptive security and optimized performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** Stream of resource utilization data (CPU, memory, network I/O, disk I/O) from executing user-submitted code.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network, Prophet) to predict future resource utilization patterns over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., next 5-10 seconds).  Model is trained on a dataset of known benign and malicious code behaviors.
    *   Calculate a “behavioral risk score” based on the deviation of predicted resource usage from established baseline patterns for benign code.  Higher deviation = higher risk.  This score will incorporate confidence intervals from the forecasting model.
    *   Maintain a running average of behavioral risk scores for each user account and each submitted task.
*   **Output:** Behavioral risk score, predicted resource utilization curve, user/task history.

**2. Dynamic Resource Allocator Module:**

*   **Input:** Behavioral risk score, predicted resource utilization curve, current resource allocation, available system resources, predefined security thresholds, performance optimization targets.
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on the behavioral risk score and predicted resource utilization, dynamically adjust resource allocation for the task.
        *   **High Risk:**  Restrict resource access (e.g., limit CPU cores, memory, network bandwidth).  Sandboxing features are enabled or enhanced. Consider terminating the task if the risk exceeds a critical threshold.
        *   **Moderate Risk:** Increase monitoring frequency.  Slightly reduce resource allocation.
        *   **Low Risk:** Allocate resources proactively based on the predicted utilization curve, optimizing for performance and minimizing latency.
    *   Implement a feedback loop: Monitor actual resource usage after allocation adjustments. Use this data to refine the forecasting model and allocation algorithms.
*   **Output:** Resource allocation configuration (CPU cores, memory limit, network bandwidth, disk I/O limits), monitoring configuration.

**3. Sandboxing Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Sandboxing configuration, behavioral risk score.
*   **Process:**
    *   Dynamically adjust the sandboxing restrictions based on the behavioral risk score.  For example:
        *   Disable network access entirely for high-risk tasks.
        *   Restrict access to sensitive system calls.
        *   Implement more aggressive memory protection.
*   **Output:** Sandboxing configuration.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Resource Allocator):**

```
function allocateResources(riskScore, predictedUtilization, currentAllocation, availableResources) {

  if (riskScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
    newAllocation = {
      cpuCores: 1,
      memoryLimit: 512MB,
      networkAccess: false
    }
  } else if (riskScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
    newAllocation = {
      cpuCores: currentAllocation.cpuCores * 0.75,
      memoryLimit: currentAllocation.memoryLimit * 0.75,
      networkAccess: true // but monitored
    }
  } else {
    // Proactive allocation based on predicted utilization
    newAllocation = {
      cpuCores: predictedUtilization.cpuCores,
      memoryLimit: predictedUtilization.memoryLimit,
      networkAccess: true
    }
  }

  // Check if resources are available
  if (newAllocation.cpuCores > availableResources.cpuCores) {
    newAllocation.cpuCores = availableResources.cpuCores
  }

  // Apply allocation
  applyResourceAllocation(newAllocation)

  return newAllocation
}
```

**Data Store Requirements:**

*   Historical resource utilization data for both benign and malicious code.
*   User account profiles (reputation scores, historical behavior).
*   Forecasting model parameters.
*   Allocation history.
*   Sandboxing configuration templates.
