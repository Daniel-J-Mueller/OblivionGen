## Decentralized Key Shard Management with Biometric Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the multi-factor key derivation approach by distributing key components (shards) across multiple devices – potentially user wearables, trusted hardware modules (TPMs), and edge computing nodes.  Combine this with biometric attestation to dynamically assemble and authorize key usage.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Key Shard Generation & Distribution Module:**
    *   Input: Master Key (initially held within a secure enclave). Data to be protected.
    *   Process:  Split the master key into *n* shards using a Secret Sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).  Distribute each shard to a different device/location. Metadata associating shards with specific data protection policies.
    *   Output: Shard Distribution Map – a record of which shard is on which device. Encrypted Shards.
*   **Component 2: Biometric Attestation Module (on each shard-holding device):**
    *   Input: Biometric scan (fingerprint, iris, voiceprint, etc.).  Challenge Request (from the Data Access Requestor).
    *   Process: Verify biometric against locally stored profile.  Generate a signed attestation token.  Encrypt the shard using a key derived from the attestation token.
    *   Output: Encrypted Shard, Attestation Token.
*   **Component 3: Key Reconstruction & Authorization Module (on a designated "coordinator" device):**
    *   Input: Data Access Request (identifying the data to be accessed). Coordinator Device ID.
    *   Process: Initiate requests to each shard-holding device, providing the Data Access Request and Coordinator Device ID.  Collect encrypted shards and attestation tokens. Verify attestation tokens against a trusted registry (ensuring the requesting device is authorized).  Reconstruct the master key from the decrypted shards. Derive the message encryption key.
    *   Output: Message Encryption Key.  Authorization Signal.
*   **Component 4:  Dynamic Shard Rotation:**
    *   Process: Implement a scheduled or event-triggered rotation of key shards. This could involve re-splitting the key, generating new shards, and distributing them to different devices, enhancing security against compromise.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  Periodically (or on compromise detection), initiate shard rotation.
        2.  Generate a new set of *n* shards using a different random seed.
        3.  Distribute shards to a potentially different set of devices.
        4.  Update the Shard Distribution Map.
        5.  Revoke access using the old shard distribution.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(dataAccessRequest, coordinatorID):
  shardResponses = []
  for each device in shardDistributionMap:
    response = device.requestShard(dataAccessRequest, coordinatorID)
    shardResponses.append(response)

  if length(shardResponses) < n:
    return error("Insufficient shards received")

  for each response in shardResponses:
    verifyAttestationToken(response.attestationToken) // check against trusted registry
    decryptShard(response.encryptedShard, attestationToken) // decrypt using attestation

  reconstructedKey = combineShards(decryptedShards) // Shamir's Secret Sharing reconstruction

  return reconstructedKey
```

**Edge Cases:**

*   Device unavailability (Shard Redundancy): Implement *k*-of-*n* threshold cryptography to tolerate device failures.
*   Biometric Spoofing: Integrate liveness detection mechanisms into the biometric attestation process.
*   Compromised Devices:  Utilize a reputation system for devices.  Reduce weighting of compromised devices in key reconstruction.
