## Dynamic Packet Shaping via Predictive Congestion Control

**Specification:** A system for proactive packet shaping based on learned network congestion patterns. This builds on the existing concept of packet policing but shifts from reactive dropping to *predictive* shaping, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Congestion Prediction Engine (CPE):** This module utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to analyze historical packet flow data (packet size, inter-arrival time, destination port, source IP) and predict future congestion levels on specific network paths.  The LSTM is trained offline on network telemetry and refined continuously via reinforcement learning based on observed performance.

2.  **Shaping Queue:** Instead of a simple FIFO queue, this employs multiple priority queues managed by the CPE. Packets are categorized based on predicted congestion and assigned to appropriate queues. Higher priority queues experience less shaping/delay.

3.  **Adaptive Shaping Function:** The CPE dynamically adjusts a shaping function applied to each queue. This function is *not* simply a drop probability. It allows for:
    *   **Delay Budgeting:**  Allocate a maximum permissible delay to each packet based on its priority and predicted congestion.
    *   **Packet Stretching/Shrinking:**  Slightly adjust the inter-arrival time of packets to smooth out bursts and prevent congestion.  This is done within acceptable latency limits.
    *   **Selective Replication:** For critical packets (e.g., VoIP signaling), duplicate the packet and send it via alternate paths if path congestion is predicted.

4.  **Telemetry Integration:** Continuous monitoring of network performance (latency, packet loss, throughput) feeds back into the CPE to refine its prediction models and shaping algorithms.

**Pseudocode (CPE â€“ Simplified):**

```
// Input: Packet information (size, arrival time, destination, source)
// Output: Shaping parameters (delay adjustment, priority level)

function predictCongestion(packetInfo, historicalData):
    // LSTM network predicts congestion level for the destination path
    congestionLevel = LSTM(packetInfo, historicalData)
    return congestionLevel

function determineShapingParameters(packetInfo, congestionLevel):
    if congestionLevel > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
        priority = LOW
        delayAdjustment = DELAY_INCREMENT  // Add delay
    else if congestionLevel > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
        priority = MEDIUM
        delayAdjustment = 0 // No delay
    else:
        priority = HIGH
        delayAdjustment = -DELAY_INCREMENT // Reduce delay (if possible)

    return priority, delayAdjustment

// Main processing loop
function processPacket(packet):
    congestionLevel = predictCongestion(packet, networkTelemetry)
    priority, delayAdjustment = determineShapingParameters(packet, congestionLevel)

    //Adjust packet delay based on delayAdjustment
    //Place packet into appropriate priority queue

    return
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   FPGA implementation is preferred for high throughput and low latency.  The LSTM network can be partially or fully implemented on the FPGA.
*   Dedicated hardware accelerators for LSTM calculations are crucial.
*   High-speed memory for storing historical data and network telemetry.

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond simply policing packet rates to *anticipating* congestion and proactively shaping traffic, resulting in improved network performance and reduced latency. The dynamic shaping function and predictive modeling represent significant advancements over traditional packet policing techniques. Replication offers an additional layer of robustness for critical applications.
