## Adaptive Security Perimeter - "Ghost Zone"

**Concept:** Extend the security system's awareness *beyond* the immediate entry point, creating a dynamic, adjustable “Ghost Zone” around the property. This leverages the A/V data not just for intrusion *detection* but for preemptive behavioral analysis and personalized threat assessment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing A/V devices (cameras) – must support object recognition/tracking.
    *   Existing sensor network (door/window sensors, motion detectors).
    *   Dedicated Edge Computing Unit – local processing for rapid response (optional – could be cloud-based, but latency is a concern).
    *   Low-power Bluetooth Beacons – strategically placed within the “Ghost Zone”.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Behavioral Baseline Module:**  AI-driven module that learns the typical movement patterns and presence of individuals *within* the defined “Ghost Zone”. This isn't just the property line, but an adjustable perimeter – 10ft, 20ft, 50ft, user-defined.  It differentiates between known residents, regular visitors (mail carrier, gardener), and anomalous activity.
    *   **Proximity Engine:**  Tracks Bluetooth beacon signals emitted by authorized user devices (smartphones, keyfobs). Creates a dynamic “safe zone” around users within the Ghost Zone.
    *   **Predictive Threat Assessment Module:** Combines behavioral data, proximity data, and A/V analysis to assess potential threats *before* an entry point is breached.  E.g., a person lingering near the property line for an extended period, exhibiting suspicious movements, while *not* identified as a known resident or within a safe zone.
    *   **Adaptive Alarm Logic:** Based on the threat assessment, the system can trigger various responses:
        *   **Tier 1 (Low Threat):**  Begin recording, send a notification to the user ("Suspicious activity detected near the property").
        *   **Tier 2 (Medium Threat):**  Activate external lighting, issue a verbal warning via a smart speaker ("You are being monitored."), notify security monitoring service.
        *   **Tier 3 (High Threat):**  Full alarm activation, contact law enforcement.
*   **Pseudocode (Predictive Threat Assessment):**

```
function assessThreat(person, location, time) {
  behavioralData = getBehavioralData(location, time);
  proximityData = getProximityData(person);

  if (person is knownResident() || person is withinProximityZone()) {
    return "No Threat";
  }

  if (behavioralData.movementPattern is anomalous() && behavioralData.dwellTime > threshold) {
    threatLevel = "Medium";
  } else {
    threatLevel = "Low";
  }

  if (person.carryingObject() && object.isWeapon()) {
    threatLevel = "High";
  }

  return threatLevel;
}

function getBehavioralData(location, time) {
  // Access historical movement data for the specified location and time.
  // Apply AI algorithms to identify anomalies.
  return behavioralData;
}

function getProximityData(person) {
  // Check for active Bluetooth beacon signals associated with the person.
  return proximityData;
}

```

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Adjustable “Ghost Zone” perimeter via mobile app.
    *   Visualization of detected individuals within the Ghost Zone.
    *   Customizable threat sensitivity levels.
    *   Event history log with A/V recordings.
