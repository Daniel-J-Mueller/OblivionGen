## Dynamic Harmonic Fingerprinting for Grid Resilience

**Concept:** Implement a system that actively learns and fingerprints harmonic profiles of power sources *before* a transfer switch event, then uses those fingerprints to predict potential issues *during* a transfer, going beyond simple voltage/current thresholding. This goes beyond identifying a *single* modified characteristic and creates a continuously updated profile of each power source.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution current and voltage sensors integrated into each power input of the automatic transfer switch. Sampling rate: >20kHz.
    *   Dedicated edge processing unit (FPGA or similar) capable of real-time Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and harmonic analysis.
    *   Secure storage (encrypted) for storing harmonic fingerprints – sufficient to hold profiles for at least 10 distinct sources.
    *   Communication interface (Ethernet/Wi-Fi) for data logging and remote monitoring/updates.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Baseline Harmonic Profile Generation:** Upon initial power-up, the system analyzes incoming power for a defined period (e.g., 24 hours) to establish a ‘baseline’ harmonic fingerprint. This includes identifying the amplitude and phase of significant harmonics (up to the 31st harmonic).
    *   **Dynamic Fingerprint Learning:** The system *continuously* monitors harmonic profiles, updating the baseline fingerprint using a weighted moving average. This adapts to gradual changes in the power source (e.g., load variations). The weighting favors recent data but retains historical context.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder) trained on the baseline fingerprints.  During operation, the model reconstructs the current harmonic profile.  Significant deviation between the actual profile and the reconstruction indicates an anomaly. Anomaly score thresholds will be configurable.
    *   **Predictive Analysis:**  If an anomaly is detected, the system begins a ‘predictive phase’. It analyzes the *rate of change* of the anomaly score. A rapidly increasing score suggests a potential issue that could impact the transfer switch.
    *   **Transfer Switch Control Integration:** During a transfer switch event, the system compares the real-time harmonic profile of the incoming source with the stored fingerprint. If a significant discrepancy is detected *before* the transfer is complete, the system can:
        *   Delay the transfer.
        *   Log a detailed diagnostic report.
        *   Initiate a controlled outage to prevent damage.
    *   **Data Logging & Reporting:** All harmonic data, anomaly scores, and transfer switch events are logged for historical analysis. Generate reports to identify trends and potential power quality issues.
    *   **Secure Communication Protocol:** Implement a secure communication protocol (e.g., TLS) for remote monitoring and software updates to prevent unauthorized access.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(current_harmonic_profile):
  // Load baseline harmonic profile
  baseline_profile = load_baseline_profile()

  // Calculate reconstruction error (e.g., using autoencoder)
  reconstruction_error = autoencoder.reconstruct(current_harmonic_profile)

  // Calculate anomaly score (based on reconstruction error)
  anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(reconstruction_error)

  // Check if anomaly score exceeds threshold
  if anomaly_score > anomaly_threshold:
    return True  // Anomaly detected
  else:
    return False // No anomaly detected
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems rely on static thresholds. This system *learns* the unique characteristics of each power source, allowing for more accurate anomaly detection and predictive analysis, significantly improving grid resilience.  The predictive aspect allows for proactive intervention *before* a potentially damaging transfer.
