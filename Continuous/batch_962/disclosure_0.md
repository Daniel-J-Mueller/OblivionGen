## Dynamic Content "Lifecycles" & Predictive Decay

**Concept:** Extend the system to not just prioritize *new* supplemental content, but to model and predict content "lifecycles" – how long content remains relevant/effective – and proactively adjust sourcing/bidding accordingly. This goes beyond simple date-of-creation weighting.

**Specs:**

*   **Lifecycle Profile Database:** A database storing lifecycle profiles for different item categories (or even specific keywords). Profiles define expected performance decay curves (e.g., initial high CTR, rapid decline after 72 hours, steady decline thereafter).  Profiles can be manually defined by marketing teams or learned through machine learning (see below).
*   **Real-Time Performance Monitoring:** Integrate real-time performance data (CTR, conversion rate, dwell time) for *each* piece of supplemental content.
*   **Predictive Decay Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained on historical performance data and lifecycle profiles. This engine predicts future performance of each supplemental content item.  Inputs: date of creation, item category, keywords, *current* performance metrics. Output: predicted performance score (e.g., on a scale of 0-100).
*   **Dynamic Bidding/Sourcing Algorithm:** Modify the existing sourcing algorithm to factor in the predicted performance score.  Higher predicted scores = higher priority/bids in the ad auction.  The algorithm dynamically adjusts bids to maximize ROI, factoring in the cost of the ad space vs. predicted revenue.
*   **Content "Refresh" Trigger:**  Based on predicted performance, automatically trigger a “refresh” – either replacing low-performing content with newer options or updating the existing content (e.g., changing ad creative, updating pricing).  This could be a rule-based system (e.g., “If predicted performance drops below 30, trigger refresh”) or a more sophisticated machine learning model.
*   **Automated Profile Learning:** Implement a system that automatically learns and refines lifecycle profiles based on observed performance data. This could involve clustering similar content items and identifying common decay patterns.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Bidding Adjustment):**

```
function adjustBid(supplementalContentItem, currentBid, predictedPerformanceScore):
  baseAdjustment = predictedPerformanceScore / 100 // Normalize score to a 0-1 range
  
  if supplementalContentItem.itemCategory == "HighDemand":
    adjustmentMultiplier = 1.5 // Increase bid for high-demand categories
  else:
    adjustmentMultiplier = 1.0
    
  adjustedBid = currentBid * (1 + baseAdjustment * adjustmentMultiplier)
  
  // Cap the bid to prevent runaway costs
  if adjustedBid > maxBidForCategory:
    adjustedBid = maxBidForCategory
    
  return adjustedBid
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `LifecycleProfile`:  {`itemCategory`: string, `decayCurve`: function, `averageLifespan`: integer}
*   `SupplementalContentItem`: {`id`: string, `itemCategory`: string, `dateCreated`: date, `currentPerformance`: float, `predictedPerformance`: float}
