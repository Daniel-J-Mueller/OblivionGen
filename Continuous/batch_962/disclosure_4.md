## Dynamic Sonic Texture Generation

**Concept:** Instead of solely focusing on loudness normalization, utilize the frequency band analysis to *generate* new sonic textures layered *under* the original audio. This creates an adaptive soundscape that responds to the input's characteristics, offering more than just volume control – it offers sonic augmentation.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Stereo or Multichannel audio signal.
*   **Frequency Band Split:** Utilize a filter bank (potentially a gammatone filter bank to more closely model human hearing) to divide the input signal into 32-64 frequency bands.
*   **Band Envelope Extraction:** For each band, calculate a smoothed envelope representing the energy over time.  Smoothing can be achieved with a short-time average or a median filter.
*   **Texture Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Employ a granular synthesis engine. Each frequency band’s envelope will control parameters of a granular stream.
    *   Granule density: Derived from the band envelope – higher energy = higher density.
    *   Granule duration:  Inverse relationship to the center frequency of the band – higher frequencies = shorter granules.
    *   Granule pitch: Randomly varied within a narrow range around the band's center frequency.
    *   Granule waveform:  Utilize a set of pre-recorded or procedurally generated waveforms (sine, sawtooth, square, noise) that are selected or blended based on the band’s spectral characteristics.  (e.g. high-frequency bands might favor noise grains, lower frequencies might blend sine and sawtooth).
*   **Spatialization:**  Pan each granular stream randomly within the stereo field (or across multiple channels) to create a wider, more immersive soundscape.
*   **Dynamic Mixing:**  Control the overall level of the synthesized texture layer based on the input signal’s loudness and dynamic range.  A lower input level might result in a more prominent texture layer, while a louder signal might subtly blend the two.
*   **Output:** Mixed audio signal (original input + synthesized texture).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: audio_signal
// Parameters: num_bands, filter_type, smoothing_window, texture_level

// 1. Frequency Band Split
band_signals = split_audio_into_bands(audio_signal, num_bands, filter_type)

// 2. Band Envelope Extraction
band_envelopes = calculate_band_envelopes(band_signals, smoothing_window)

// 3. Texture Synthesis
for each band in band_envelopes:
    grain_density = map(band_envelope, 0, max_envelope, min_grain_density, max_grain_density)
    grain_duration = calculate_grain_duration(band_center_frequency)
    grain_waveform = select_grain_waveform(band_spectral_characteristics)
    generate_grains(grain_density, grain_duration, grain_waveform)
    pan_grains_randomly()

// 4. Mixing
mixed_signal = mix(audio_signal, synthesized_texture, texture_level)

// Output: mixed_signal
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Adaptive sound design for games and virtual reality.
*   Enhancement of audiobooks and podcasts.
*   Creating immersive soundscapes for meditation and relaxation.
*   Generating unique musical textures.
