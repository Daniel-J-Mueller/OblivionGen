## Dynamic Code Context Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the client-side caching not just to code completion *information*, but to a constantly updated, dynamic representation of the *code context* itself. This goes beyond simple tokenization and allows the client to predictively load relevant information *before* the user even types, dramatically improving responsiveness and enabling features impossible with purely on-demand requests.

**Specs:**

1.  **Context Graph Generation:** The client, upon initial code load or file open, constructs a context graph representing the code's structure. Nodes represent code elements (variables, functions, classes, etc.), and edges represent relationships (calls, inheritance, scoping, etc.). This graph is built using token information *and* static analysis (where possible client-side) of the code.

2.  **Predictive Loading:**  As the user moves the cursor within the code, the client *predicts* the likely next code elements the user will interact with. This prediction is based on:
    *   Cursor position within the context graph.
    *   Code navigation history (where the user has recently been).
    *   Statistical analysis of common code patterns within the codebase (identified during a pre-indexing phase or gathered from telemetry).
    *   The type of element under the cursor (e.g., if the cursor is over a function call, predict the parameters).

3.  **Pre-Fetching & Caching:** Based on the prediction, the client initiates requests to the web service *before* the user types. This includes:
    *   Code completion information for the predicted elements.
    *   Documentation for the predicted elements.
    *   Definition locations for the predicted elements.
    *   Relevant code examples.

4.  **Cache Prioritization:** A priority queue manages the cache.  Items are prioritized based on:
    *   Prediction confidence (how likely the prediction is to be correct).
    *   Recency of access.
    *   Size of the item (smaller items are prioritized to minimize cache misses).

5.  **Context Diffing & Synchronization:**  A differential algorithm tracks changes to the context graph. Only the *differences* are transmitted to the web service, reducing network overhead. The web service maintains a canonical version of the context graph and provides updates to the client.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// On Code Load/File Open
contextGraph = buildContextGraph(code)
priorityQueue = initializePriorityQueue()

// On Cursor Movement
predictedElement = predictNextElement(contextGraph, cursorPosition, navigationHistory)

if (predictedElement not in cache) {
    requestInformation(predictedElement) // Asynchronously fetch from web service
}

updatePriorityQueue(predictedElement) // Adjust priority based on prediction confidence

// On Information Received from Web Service
cache[predictedElement] = information
updatePriorityQueue(predictedElement)
```

**Web Service Enhancements:**

*   API endpoint for requesting context information based on element identifiers (e.g., fully qualified name, line/column number).
*   Support for incremental updates to context information (diffs).
*   Mechanism for tracking code changes and invalidating cached context information.
