## Dynamic Document 'Breathing' & Affective Response

**Concept:** Expand the panel-based system to incorporate subtle, real-time visual ‘breathing’ effects and link these to detected user affective states (emotion). The system will dynamically alter panel sizes, opacity, and positioning *not* for navigation, but to create a subconscious emotional resonance with the user.

**Specs:**

**I. Affective State Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time video feed from user-facing camera, microphone audio.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Facial expression analysis (using pre-trained models for joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral).
    *   Voice tone analysis (pitch, cadence, intensity).
    *   Combined affective score (weighted average of facial and vocal analysis – configurable weighting).
    *   Output: Affective state (e.g., ‘Calm’, ‘Agitated’, ‘Focused’, ‘Distracted’) and confidence level.

**II. Dynamic Panel Modulation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Affective State from Module I, Current Document Structure (panel definitions, sizes, positions).
*   **Core Algorithm:** ‘Breathing’ algorithm based on affective state.  Pseudocode:

```
function modulate_panels(affective_state, confidence, panel_array):
  base_scale = 1.0
  base_opacity = 1.0
  pan_speed = 0.01

  if affective_state == "Calm" and confidence > 0.7:
    scale_factor = 1.0 + (sin(time * 0.5) * 0.02) # Gentle pulsing
    opacity_factor = 1.0
    pan_x = sin(time * 0.2) * pan_speed
    pan_y = cos(time * 0.2) * pan_speed
  elif affective_state == "Agitated" and confidence > 0.7:
    scale_factor = 0.95 + (sin(time * 0.8) * 0.05) #Faster, smaller pulsing
    opacity_factor = 0.8 + (cos(time * 0.4) * 0.2) #Subtle flicker
    pan_x = cos(time * 0.5) * pan_speed * 2
    pan_y = sin(time * 0.5) * pan_speed * 2
  elif affective_state == "Focused" and confidence > 0.7:
    scale_factor = 1.02 #Slight enlargement
    opacity_factor = 1.0
    pan_x = 0.0
    pan_y = 0.0
  else: #Default/Neutral
    scale_factor = 1.0
    opacity_factor = 1.0
    pan_x = 0.0
    pan_y = 0.0

  for panel in panel_array:
    panel.scale *= scale_factor
    panel.opacity *= opacity_factor
    panel.x += pan_x
    panel.y += pan_y
```

*   **Parameterization:**  Algorithm parameters (pulse frequency, amplitude, opacity variation, pan speed) are configurable per panel type (e.g., image panels might react differently than text panels).
*   **Smoothing:**  Implement a smoothing function to prevent abrupt changes in panel properties.

**III. System Integration:**

*   **Document Parser:**  The existing document parser must be modified to identify panel types and assign reactivity parameters.
*   **Rendering Engine:** The rendering engine must support dynamic scaling, opacity, and positioning of panels.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Implement caching and efficient rendering techniques to minimize performance impact.
*   **User Control:** Provide a user setting to enable/disable the affective response feature.



This expands on the idea of dynamic document presentation, not for usability, but for subconscious emotional effect. Imagine a document ‘breathing’ with the user, subtly shifting to create a more engaging and resonant experience. It's a move away from pure information delivery and towards emotional connection within the digital space.
