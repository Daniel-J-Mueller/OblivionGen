## Personalized Interactive Advertisement "Worlds"

**Concept:** Extend targeted advertising beyond simple replacement to create brief, interactive "worlds" within the broadcast media experience, tailored to user purchase history and browsing data. Instead of *replacing* an ad, momentarily *augment* the existing broadcast with a personalized interactive layer.

**Specs:**

*   **Trigger:** Upon detection of a regional advertisement (as per the patent's audio analysis), initiate a check against the user's profile (purchase history, browsing data from the linked e-commerce system).
*   **World Generation:** Based on profile data, dynamically generate a simplified 3D or 2.5D "world" â€“ a miniature scene relevant to the user's interests. Examples:
    *   User frequently purchases camping gear: Generate a miniature campsite scene.
    *   User browses cooking recipes: Generate a miniature kitchen scene.
    *   User purchases musical instruments: Generate a miniature stage or practice room.
*   **Interactive Elements:**  Populate the world with interactive elements directly linked to purchasable items.
    *   Camping scene: Tap a tent to view product details, tap a lantern to see similar items.
    *   Kitchen scene: Tap ingredients on a counter to view recipes using those ingredients, tap cookware to view product details.
*   **Integration:** Seamlessly overlay the interactive world onto the broadcast media.  The original broadcast content is dimmed or partially transparent during interaction. The user can 'exit' the world to resume full-screen playback.
*   **Duration:**  Limit interaction duration to 5-15 seconds to avoid disrupting the viewing experience.
*   **Input Method:**  Use remote control, mobile device touchscreen (via companion app), or voice commands to navigate and interact.
*   **Data Gathering:** Track user interactions within the worlds to refine targeting and world generation algorithms.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION handleRegionalAd(audioSignal):
  userProfile = getUserProfile()
  IF userProfile.purchaseHistory OR userProfile.browseHistory:
    worldType = determineWorldType(userProfile) // Based on history
    world = generateWorld(worldType, userProfile)
    overlayWorld(broadcastMedia, world)
    userInteraction = waitForUserInteraction(world, 5-15 seconds)
    IF userInteraction:
      displayProductDetails(userInteraction.selectedItem)
    removeWorld(broadcastMedia)
  ELSE:
    displayStandardRegionalAd()
  END
END

FUNCTION determineWorldType(userProfile):
  // Algorithm to prioritize world types based on purchase/browse frequency.
  // Example: If camping gear purchased more than cooking recipes, prioritize camping world.
  RETURN worldType
END

FUNCTION generateWorld(worldType, userProfile):
  // Procedurally generate a 3D/2.5D scene based on worldType and userProfile.
  // Populate with interactive elements linked to purchasable items.
  RETURN generatedWorld
END
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Networked storage system (as per patent)
*   E-commerce system integration
*   Real-time 3D/2.5D rendering engine (on client device or server)
*   Companion mobile app (optional, for enhanced interaction)
*   Speech recognition/voice command processing
*   User profile management system
*   Data analytics platform to track user interactions.
