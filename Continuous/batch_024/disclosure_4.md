## Dynamic Spectral Shifting for Display Cure & Calibration

**Concept:** Leveraging tunable photonic crystals or metamaterials to dynamically alter the spectral output of a light source *during* the photobleaching/cure process. This isnâ€™t simply filtering, but actively *shifting* wavelengths to optimize for specific ink responses or to counter individual pixel degradation profiles.

**Specifications:**

*   **Light Source:** Array of micro-LEDs emitting broad-spectrum light (200nm-700nm). LEDs are selectable individually.
*   **Spectral Shifter Layer:** A layer of dynamically tunable photonic crystals (or metamaterials) positioned between the LEDs and the display. Each crystal can alter the wavelengths that pass through it, controlled by an applied voltage. Resolution of spectral control: 5nm increments.
*   **Sensor Array:** High-resolution spectrometer coupled to each display unit. Measures the reflected light from the display after exposure to a set spectral output.
*   **Control System:** Embedded processor with AI/ML algorithms. Algorithms analyze spectral data from the sensor array, and control voltage applied to spectral shifter layer, modulating the output wavelengths.
*   **Calibration Phase:**
    1.  Initial broad-spectrum exposure (200nm-700nm) to establish baseline spectral response of the display.
    2.  Sensor array collects spectral data across the display surface.
    3.  AI algorithms analyze the data and identify areas with color gradients or uneven ink degradation.
    4.  Algorithm determines optimal spectral output for each region of the display. This output will maximize the bleaching/curing of defective ink, while minimizing change to working ink.
*   **Cure/Bleaching Phase:**
    1.  Control system dynamically adjusts the voltage applied to the spectral shifter layer. This creates a unique spectral output for each region of the display.
    2.  LEDs output light.
    3.  Sensor array monitors the spectral response of the display during the cure/bleaching process, providing feedback to the control system.
    4.  Control system adjusts spectral output in real-time, optimizing for consistent color and minimizing gradients.
*   **Hardware Considerations:**
    *   Photonic crystals/metamaterials must be robust enough to withstand repeated voltage adjustments and exposure to UV light.
    *   Control system must be capable of processing spectral data in real-time and generating precise voltage control signals.
    *   Calibration process must be automated and repeatable.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Calibration Phase
FOR each pixel in display:
    Emit broad-spectrum light at pixel
    Capture reflected light spectrum with sensor
    Analyze spectrum to determine ink degradation profile
    Store degradation profile for pixel

// Cure Phase
FOR each pixel in display:
    Retrieve stored degradation profile
    Calculate optimal spectral output based on profile
    Apply voltage to spectral shifter layer to achieve output
    Emit light at pixel
    Monitor reflected spectrum with sensor
    Adjust voltage in real-time to optimize for consistent color
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Dramatically reduced color gradients and improved display uniformity.
*   Extended display lifespan by precisely targeting and correcting ink degradation.
*   Adaptive calibration for different display models and ink formulations.
*   Potential for personalized display calibration based on user preferences.
