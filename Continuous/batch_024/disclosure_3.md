## Adaptive Propeller Geometry via Segmented Drive Shafts

**Concept:** The core idea stems from the patentâ€™s use of multiple motors driving a single shaft. Rather than redundancy focused on *failure*, this expands to *active adaptation* of propeller geometry during flight. This is achieved by segmenting the drive shaft and independently controlling each segment's rotational angle.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Drive Shaft Construction:** The drive shaft will be constructed of 3-5 segments, connected by universal joints allowing limited angular deviation. Segments will be made of a high-strength, lightweight material (carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite).
*   **Motor/Clutch Configuration:** Each shaft segment will be directly coupled to a dedicated brushless DC motor *without* one-way clutches. Precise encoder feedback will be essential.
*   **Control System:** A real-time control system will manage each motor, adjusting speed and relative angle of each shaft segment. This system will receive inputs from:
    *   **Flight Control Computer:**  Current airspeed, altitude, angle of attack, roll, pitch, yaw.
    *   **Airflow Sensors:** Miniature Pitot tubes or pressure sensors positioned along the propeller blade's span to determine local airflow characteristics.
    *   **Strain Gauges:** Integrated into each propeller blade to monitor stress distribution.
*   **Propeller Blade Design:** Blades will be designed to withstand potentially non-uniform loading arising from segmented shaft actuation. A slightly more flexible blade construction may be beneficial.
*   **Actuation Range:** Each segment will have an actuation range of +/- 5-10 degrees relative to its neighbors. This range is determined through CFD analysis to maximize performance gains without risking structural failure.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Adaptive Algorithm:** The control system will run a proprietary algorithm that maps flight conditions to optimal shaft segment angles. This algorithm will learn and refine performance over time via reinforcement learning.
    *   **Failure Mitigation:** In the event of motor failure, the control system will lock the affected segment, maintaining a stable, albeit reduced-efficiency, propeller configuration.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Adaptive Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustPropellerGeometry(flightData, airflowData, strainData):

  // Calculate target angles based on flight conditions
  targetAngles = CalculateTargetAngles(flightData)

  // Adjust angles based on local airflow and strain data
  FOR EACH segment:
    airflowCorrection = CalculateAirflowCorrection(airflowData, segment)
    strainCorrection = CalculateStrainCorrection(strainData, segment)
    segment.angle = targetAngles[segment] + airflowCorrection + strainCorrection

  // Apply actuation commands to motors
  FOR EACH segment:
    segment.motor.setSpeed(segment.angle)

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateTargetAngles(flightData):
  // Simplified example:
  IF flightData.airspeed > thresholdSpeed:
    angles = optimizeForHighSpeed()
  ELSE:
    angles = optimizeForLowSpeed()
  RETURN angles
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Aerodynamic Efficiency:**  Active blade shaping can optimize lift and reduce drag across a wider range of flight conditions.
*   **Enhanced Maneuverability:** Precise control of blade angles can enable faster and more precise control of aircraft attitude.
*   **Noise Reduction:**  Optimized blade shaping can reduce noise generated by the propeller.
*   **Increased Payload Capacity:** Improved efficiency translates to a higher payload capacity.
