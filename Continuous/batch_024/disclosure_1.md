## Personalized Deliverability ‘Shielding’ via Dynamic Content Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the predictive deliverability system to *actively* shield senders from predicted negative events by dynamically adjusting content within outbound emails *before* transmission, based on mailbox provider behavior. This isn’t about spam filtering avoidance; it’s about subtly altering content to stay *just* within acceptable parameters for a given provider, maximizing inbox placement.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Adjustment Engine (CAE):**

*   **Input:** Email content (text, HTML, attachments), Sender ID, Recipient Mailbox Provider (determined via email address domain).
*   **Process:**
    *   Consults a dynamic "Provider Sensitivity Profile" (PSP) – see section 2.
    *   Applies pre-defined content adjustment rules based on PSP data. These rules fall into categories:
        *   **Lexical Adjustments:** Substitute synonyms for flagged keywords (e.g., "free" -> "complimentary").  Maintain semantic meaning.
        *   **Image Manipulation:** Subtle alterations to image brightness, contrast, or saturation to avoid triggering visual spam filters.
        *   **Link Obfuscation:**  Dynamic shortening or masking of URLs.
        *   **HTML Structure Modification:**  Slight adjustments to HTML tags or attributes to conform to provider-specific preferences.
        *   **Attachment Modification:** Dynamic compression or resizing of attachments, or replacement with lower-resolution versions.
    *   Output: Modified email content.
*   **Prioritization:** Rules prioritized by predicted impact on deliverability *and* preservation of message intent.  A "Message Integrity Score" (MIS) tracks changes.

**2. Provider Sensitivity Profile (PSP):**

*   **Data Source:** Historical deliverability data (as in the original patent), augmented with:
    *   Real-time monitoring of provider-published content guidelines.
    *   Analysis of publicly accessible spam trap data.
    *   Machine learning models trained on provider-specific spam filter behavior.
*   **Data Structure:** A multi-layered profile:
    *   **Base Layer:** General sensitivities (e.g., high sensitivity to exclamation points).
    *   **Sender Layer:** Specific sensitivities related to the sender's reputation and content history.
    *   **Content Type Layer:**  Sensitivities related to specific content types (e.g., promotional emails vs. transactional emails).
    *   **Dynamic Layer:**  Real-time adjustments based on observed provider behavior.
*   **Update Frequency:** Dynamic layer updated hourly; other layers updated weekly.

**3.  Feedback Loop & A/B Testing:**

*   Implement A/B testing to evaluate the impact of content adjustments on deliverability and engagement metrics (open rates, click-through rates).
*   Continuously refine content adjustment rules and PSP data based on A/B testing results.
*   Monitor user complaints and unsubscribe rates to identify potential issues.

**Pseudocode (CAE core):**

```
function adjustContent(emailContent, senderID, recipientProvider):
  psp = loadProviderSensitivityProfile(recipientProvider, senderID)
  adjustedContent = emailContent
  for each rule in psp.rules:
    if rule.triggerCondition(adjustedContent):
      adjustedContent = rule.applyModification(adjustedContent)
      mis = calculateMessageIntegrityScore(adjustedContent, emailContent)
      if mis < rule.minimumAcceptableIntegrity:
        revertModification(adjustedContent, emailContent)  // Prevent excessive alteration
  return adjustedContent
```

**Novelty:** This isn't just about *predicting* deliverability; it’s about *actively influencing* it through dynamic content adjustment. It shifts the paradigm from reactive filtering to proactive shielding.  The PSP provides a granular, sender-specific approach, moving beyond broad-stroke spam filtering techniques.  The MIS ensures message integrity is maintained.
