## Secure Data Beacon & Recovery System

**Concept:** Expand upon the proximity detection aspect of the patent to create a system where storage devices actively broadcast a low-power, encrypted "heartbeat" signal. This signal isn't just for triggering destruction, but for continuous location tracking and data recovery in specific scenarios.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Module:** Each storage device integrates a miniature, low-power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon module. This module is paired with a unique encryption key.
*   **Signal Characteristics:** The beacon signal will transmit:
    *   Device ID
    *   Encryption Key ID
    *   Health Status (e.g., power level, error flags)
    *   Location Data (derived from a simple triangulation or RSSI based proximity estimate)
*   **Data Center Infrastructure:** Data center installs a network of BLE receivers strategically placed throughout the facility. Receivers continually scan for beacon signals.
*   **Central Management System (CMS):** A server application that:
    *   Maintains a database of all storage device IDs and their associated data.
    *   Processes beacon signals received by the BLE receivers.
    *   Tracks the location of each storage device in real-time.
    *   Monitors device health status.
    *   Can trigger data recovery procedures (described below).
*   **Data Recovery Modes:**
    *   **Lost Device Recovery:** If a device’s beacon signal is lost for a predefined period, CMS initiates a search using the last known location. If the device is located, a recovery process begins (potentially involving a specialized robotic arm).
    *   **Theft Detection:** If a device’s beacon signal moves outside of the data center’s perimeter, the system flags it as potentially stolen and initiates a lockdown procedure.
    *   **Proactive Data Migration:** If a device’s health status deteriorates (e.g., low power, increasing error rate), CMS automatically migrates the data to a redundant storage device before complete failure.
*   **Destruction Override & Confirmation:** The destruction mechanism (from the base patent) remains, but is integrated with the beacon system. Before initiating destruction, the system *confirms* the disconnection and loss of beacon signal. A final beacon transmission (if possible) could include a self-destruct confirmation code to prevent accidental activation.
*   **Internal Power Supply:**  Independent power supply (spring based or miniature battery) dedicated to beacon transmission *even during* power loss to the storage device, extending the time window for location tracking and recovery.

**Pseudocode (CMS – Beacon Signal Processing):**

```
function processBeaconSignal(signal) {
  deviceID = signal.deviceID
  encryptedData = signal.data
  
  if (deviceExists(deviceID)) {
    // Decrypt data using device's key
    decryptedData = decrypt(encryptedData, deviceID.key)
    
    // Update device location
    updateDeviceLocation(deviceID, decryptedData.location)
    
    // Check device health status
    if (decryptedData.healthStatus == "critical") {
      triggerDataMigration(deviceID)
    }
  } else {
    // Unknown device - log event
    logUnknownDevice(deviceID)
  }
}
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Multi-Beacon Triangulation:** Utilize multiple BLE receivers to improve location accuracy.
*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** Employ machine learning to identify unusual device behavior and predict potential failures.
*   **Secure Enclave:** Integrate a secure enclave within the storage device to protect encryption keys and sensitive data.
*   **Drone Integration:** Deploy drones equipped with BLE receivers to scan the data center for lost or stolen devices.
