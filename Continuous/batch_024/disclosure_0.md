## Adaptive Data Persistence Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of data persisted based on application behavior and predicted failure modes, moving beyond object/range-level persistence to a finer-grained, delta-based approach.

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **Failure Prediction Module:**  Utilizes machine learning algorithms analyzing application runtime data (memory access patterns, CPU utilization, I/O operations) to predict potential failure points *before* they occur.  Output: Probability map of data corruption for different memory regions.
*   **Granularity Controller:**  Manages persistence granularity based on the Failure Prediction Module's output, user-defined policies, and system resources.  Can switch between:
    *   *Full Object/Range Persistence:* As in the base patent.
    *   *Delta Persistence:* Only changed data blocks within an object/range are backed up.  Requires versioning and a robust delta reconstruction mechanism.
    *   *Critical Section Persistence:*  Specifically persists data within critical sections of code (e.g., database transactions) *while* they are executing, offering near real-time backup of the most sensitive data.
*   **Data Versioning System:**  Maintains multiple versions of delta-modified data blocks, enabling rollback to previous states or reconstruction of complete objects.  Uses a Merkle tree-like structure for efficient change tracking and integrity verification.
*   **Background Reconstruction Engine:**  In the event of a failure, reconstructs objects from persisted delta blocks and versioned data.  Optimized for parallel execution and efficient data retrieval from non-volatile storage.
*   **NV-DIMM Integration:** Leverages NV-DIMMs for both system memory and non-volatile storage, providing low-latency access to persisted data.

**II. Operational Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Application Startup
initialize Failure Prediction Module
initialize Granularity Controller
establish data versioning schema

// Runtime Monitoring Loop
while (application running) {
    data = monitor Application Memory Access
    failure_probability = Failure Prediction Module.predict(data)
    granularity = Granularity Controller.determineGranularity(failure_probability, system_resources)

    if (granularity == "Delta") {
        // Identify Changed Blocks
        changed_blocks = diff(current_data, last_persisted_data)
        // Persist Changed Blocks
        persist(changed_blocks, non_volatile_storage)
        // Update Last Persisted Data
        last_persisted_data = current_data
    } else if (granularity == "Critical Section") {
        // Within critical section:
        // Persist data *during* critical section execution
        persist(critical_section_data, non_volatile_storage)
    } else {
        // Full Object/Range Persistence (base case)
        persist(data, non_volatile_storage)
    }
}

// System Failure Recovery
reconstruct_data(non_volatile_storage, data_versioning_system)
restore_data_to_memory()
```

**III. Policy Configuration:**

*   **Application-Specific Policies:**  Allow developers to define persistence policies for individual applications, based on data criticality and performance requirements.
*   **Data Type Policies:**  Define persistence granularity based on the *type* of data being stored (e.g., critical financial transactions always use critical section persistence).
*   **Resource-Aware Policies:**  Dynamically adjust persistence granularity based on system resources (CPU, memory, NV-DIMM capacity).



**IV. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Prefetching:**  Anticipate future data access patterns and prefetch data from non-volatile storage to improve performance.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:**  Offload data comparison and delta calculation to dedicated hardware accelerators.
*    **Federated Persistence:** Distribute persisted data across multiple NV-DIMMs for increased redundancy and scalability.
