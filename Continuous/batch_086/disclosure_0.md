## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Input Mode

**Concept:** Extend the input mode detection to drive a dynamically adjustable haptic feedback system integrated into input devices (keyboard, mouse, trackpad). This system provides subtle physical cues to the user *corresponding* to the detected input mode, enhancing immersion and potentially assisting users with accessibility needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Integration:** Input devices (keyboard, mouse, trackpad) incorporate miniature haptic actuators (e.g., voice coil actuators, eccentric rotating mass motors). Actuator placement optimized for tactile feedback without hindering usability.
*   **Feedback Profiles:**  Define distinct haptic profiles for “Keyboard Mode” and “Pointer Mode.”
    *   *Keyboard Mode:*  Subtle rhythmic pulsing felt across the device surface. Amplitude and frequency are adjustable.
    *   *Pointer Mode:*  A “smoothness” profile.  Very subtle vibration damping to create a feeling of fluid movement, or small localized 'clicks' for precise actions.
*   **Detection Integration:** The existing input mode detection algorithm (from the patent) is modified to trigger haptic profile switching. A dedicated ‘haptic control’ module receives the classification data.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Implement a ‘comfort’ setting allowing users to adjust haptic intensity. The system also dynamically adjusts intensity based on user activity. If the user is rapidly switching between input methods, the haptic feedback is dampened or temporarily disabled to avoid distraction.
*   **Accessibility Features:**  Provide options for custom haptic profiles for users with visual impairments. Haptic cues could represent UI elements or actions. An option to *exaggerate* haptic feedback intensity for users who benefit from stronger tactile signals.
*   **User Profile Storage:** Store user-defined haptic profiles and comfort settings.
*   **API for Application Control:** An API allowing applications to override the default haptic profiles or trigger specific haptic cues. A game, for example, could provide unique haptic feedback for in-game events.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Control Module):**

```
// Input: classificationData (Keyboard/Pointer), userSettings
// Output: Actuator Control Signals

function applyHapticFeedback(classificationData, userSettings) {
  hapticProfile = userSettings.defaultProfile;

  if (classificationData == "Keyboard") {
    hapticProfile = userSettings.keyboardProfile;
  } else if (classificationData == "Pointer") {
    hapticProfile = userSettings.pointerProfile;
  }

  intensity = hapticProfile.intensity * userSettings.globalIntensity;
  frequency = hapticProfile.frequency;
  pattern = hapticProfile.pattern;

  // Apply intensity, frequency, and pattern to actuators
  controlActuators(intensity, frequency, pattern);
}

function controlActuators(intensity, frequency, pattern) {
    //Code to send signals to the haptic actuators
}

// In main loop of OS/application:
classificationData = getClassificationData();
applyHapticFeedback(classificationData, getUserSettings());
```
