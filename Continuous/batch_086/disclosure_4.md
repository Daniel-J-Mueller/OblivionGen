## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Augment beamformed audio selection with real-time acoustic scene composition, creating layered audio experiences tailored to detected environmental factors and user intent.  Rather than *selecting* a single beam, synthesize multiple beams weighted by their relevance to inferred acoustic events.

**Specs:**

*   **Acoustic Event Detection Module:**  A neural network trained to identify and classify acoustic events (e.g., speech, music, traffic, animal sounds, construction noise, water sounds, etc.) within each beamformed signal.  Output: a vector of probabilities representing the presence of each event type for each beam.

*   **Environmental Factor Inference:** Combine acoustic event detections with sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, GPS, time of day) to infer broader environmental factors (e.g., “busy street”, “quiet home”, “outdoor park”, “moving vehicle”). Output: a vector representing the confidence of various environmental contexts.

*   **User Intent Profiler:**  Maintain a user profile tracking typical behaviors (e.g., frequent phone calls during commute, music listening at home, podcast consumption during exercise). Utilize this profile to predict user intent based on current context. Output: probability distribution over possible user intents (e.g., "conversation", "music", "navigation", "ambient awareness").

*   **Acoustic Scene Composer:** This module dynamically weights and mixes signals from multiple beams based on the outputs of the Acoustic Event Detection, Environmental Factor Inference, and User Intent Profiler. The weights are determined by a learned mixing matrix.

    *   Mixing Matrix: A trainable neural network. Inputs: Acoustic Event Detections, Environmental Factor Inference, User Intent Profiler. Outputs: weight vector for each beam.
    *   Beam Mixing: Weighted sum of the beamformed audio signals using the output weights.
    *   Output: Synthesized audio signal.

*   **Adaptive Learning Loop:** Continuously refine the mixing matrix and event detection models based on user feedback (e.g., explicit ratings, implicit behavior like volume adjustments, muting).  Utilize reinforcement learning techniques to optimize for user satisfaction.

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Scene Composer):**

```
function ComposeScene(beam_signals, acoustic_events, environment_factors, user_intent):
    // acoustic_events: vector of event probabilities for each beam
    // environment_factors: confidence of various environmental contexts
    // user_intent: probability distribution over user intents

    // Input concatenation for Mixing Matrix
    input_vector = concatenate(acoustic_events, environment_factors, user_intent)

    // Mixing Matrix (Neural Network)
    beam_weights = MixingMatrix(input_vector)

    // Weighted Sum of Beamformed Signals
    composed_signal = 0
    for i in range(len(beam_signals)):
        composed_signal += beam_signals[i] * beam_weights[i]

    return composed_signal
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Multi-microphone array.
*   High-performance processor for real-time signal processing and neural network inference.
*   Dedicated memory for model storage and intermediate calculations.
*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Extensive training dataset of acoustic scenes and user behavior.
