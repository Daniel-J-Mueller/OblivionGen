## Dynamic Annotation Task Composition

**Concept:** Expand beyond pre-defined task types (image classification, bounding box, etc.) by allowing a data labeling service to *compose* annotation tasks dynamically based on model confidence and evolving dataset characteristics. Instead of a static task assigned to a dataset, the service evaluates data instances and intelligently chains multiple annotation steps, potentially involving different worker skillsets and tools.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Confidence Thresholding & Task Branching:**
    *   The data labeling service integrates with a continuously trained model (initially a basic classifier, continually refined with labeled data).
    *   Incoming data instances are evaluated by the model.
    *   If the model confidence exceeds a threshold (configurable per dataset/task), a simplified annotation task is assigned (e.g., “Confirm object presence”).
    *   If confidence is below the threshold, a more complex, multi-stage task is initiated.

2.  **Composable Annotation Stages:**
    *   Define a library of atomic annotation stages (e.g., “Object Detection,” “Semantic Segmentation,” “Attribute Tagging,” “Relationship Mapping”).
    *   Each stage is implemented as a modular service with a defined input/output schema.
    *   A "task composer" service allows administrators to define *recipes* - ordered sequences of annotation stages.
    *   Recipes can include conditional branching based on outputs of previous stages. (e.g. "If object detected, proceed to semantic segmentation. Otherwise, mark as 'unidentifiable'").

3.  **Dynamic Worker Assignment:**
    *   The system maintains worker profiles indicating skillsets (e.g., "bounding box expert," "text annotator," "medical image specialist").
    *   Each annotation stage in a composed task is assigned to a worker pool with the appropriate skills.
    *   Task decomposition ensures that each worker only handles a manageable sub-task.

4.  **Real-time Feedback & Task Refinement:**
    *   Monitor worker performance on each stage.
    *   Adjust confidence thresholds, task compositions, and worker assignments dynamically to optimize labeling speed and accuracy.
    *   Implement an active learning loop – incorporate newly labeled data into the model to refine confidence scores and improve task composition.

**Pseudocode (Task Composition Engine):**

```
function ComposeTask(data_instance, recipe_id):
  recipe = GetRecipe(recipe_id)
  model_confidence = EvaluateModel(data_instance)

  if model_confidence > recipe.confidence_threshold:
    task = SimpleConfirmationTask(data_instance)
    return task

  task_chain = []
  current_data = data_instance

  for stage in recipe.stages:
    if stage.condition == NULL or EvaluateCondition(current_data, stage.condition): # Condition evaluation
      worker_pool = GetWorkerPool(stage.skill_required)
      annotation = AssignTaskToWorker(worker_pool, stage, current_data)
      current_data = annotation.output # Propagate result
      task_chain.append(annotation)

  return task_chain
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Labeling Efficiency:** Focus human effort on challenging cases.
*   **Improved Accuracy:** Adapt to dataset characteristics.
*   **Greater Flexibility:** Easily create and deploy new annotation workflows.
*   **Reduced Cost:** Optimize worker utilization.
