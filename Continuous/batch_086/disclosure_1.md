## Dynamic Focal Point Adjustment via Biofeedback

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing stereo camera system (as per patent)
    *   Biometric sensor array: integrated into housing or worn as accessory. Includes:
        *   Electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors (frontal lobe focus)
        *   Electrooculogram (EOG) sensors (eye tracking/gaze detection)
        *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor (emotional state proxy)
    *   Micro-actuator system: Miniature motors controlling camera lens focus and/or slight camera angle adjustments.
    *   Real-time processing unit (integrated with existing processor).
*   **Software:**
    *   Biofeedback Data Acquisition Module: Processes raw biometric data. Noise filtering and artifact removal essential.
    *   Attention/Cognitive Load Algorithm:  Analyzes EEG data to determine user's attentional state and cognitive load.  Outputs attention score (0-100).
    *   Gaze Correlation Engine:  Correlates EOG data with visual features detected in the stereo camera feed. Identifies points of interest based on gaze.
    *   Predictive Focus Algorithm: Combines attention score, gaze correlation data, and depth information from the stereo cameras to predict optimal focal point.
    *   Micro-Actuator Control Module:  Translates the predicted focal point into commands for the micro-actuator system.
    *   Calibration Routine: Guided process for individual user calibration. Establishes baseline biometric signatures and maps them to desired focal adjustments.

**Operational Description:**

1.  User wears biometric sensor array (or device with integrated sensors).
2.  System continuously acquires biometric data (EEG, EOG, GSR).
3.  Attention/Cognitive Load Algorithm analyzes EEG data to assess user focus.
4.  Gaze Correlation Engine identifies where the user is looking within the camera's field of view.
5.  Predictive Focus Algorithm combines these data with depth information to determine the optimal focal point *before* the user consciously attempts to focus.
6.  Micro-Actuator Control Module adjusts camera focus/angle subtly to pre-emptively bring the predicted focal point into sharp relief.
7.  System continuously monitors biometric data and adapts focal adjustments in real-time.
8.  Calibration routine fine-tunes the system for individual user characteristics and environmental conditions.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Focus Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION PredictiveFocus(EEG_Data, EOG_Data, Depth_Map)

    // Calculate Attention Score
    AttentionScore = AnalyzeEEG(EEG_Data)

    // Identify Gaze Point
    GazePoint = AnalyzeEOG(EOG_Data)

    // Extract Depth at Gaze Point
    DepthValue = Depth_Map[GazePoint.x, GazePoint.y]

    // Calculate Focal Adjustment Value
    FocalAdjustment = (AttentionScore * 0.5) + (DepthValue * 0.5) //Weighted average. Tunable parameters.

    // Limit Focal Adjustment to Prevent Overshoot
    IF FocalAdjustment > MaxAdjustment THEN
        FocalAdjustment = MaxAdjustment
    ENDIF

    RETURN FocalAdjustment
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced AR/VR experiences.
*   Assistance for individuals with visual impairments.
*   Improved operator performance in demanding environments (e.g., surgery, piloting).
*   Biometric-driven camera control for content creation.
