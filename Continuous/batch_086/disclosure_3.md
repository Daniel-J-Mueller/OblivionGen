## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Zones

**Concept:** Extend the angle/distance-based input assignment to dynamically generate and modulate haptic feedback zones on the touchscreen. Rather than simply assigning a touch to a control, provide localized haptic cues that *guide* the user towards the intended target, and *adapt* to their touch patterns.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Haptic Zone Generation:**
    *   Based on the calculated angle and distance between successive touches (as per the source patent), define a series of concentric or elliptical haptic zones around the initial touch location. These zones represent probabilities of the user intending to interact with specific input controls.
    *   Each zone is assigned a haptic intensity level (vibration strength, texture change, etc.). Zones closer to likely targets (based on historical data or predicted user intent) receive higher intensity.
    *   The size and shape of the haptic zones are *dynamic*, adjusting based on user touch speed and accuracy. Faster, more accurate touches result in smaller, more focused zones. Slower, less accurate touches result in larger, more forgiving zones.

2.  **Haptic Modulation:**
    *   As the user’s finger moves across the screen, the haptic feedback changes in real-time.
    *   If the user’s finger enters a high-intensity haptic zone associated with a particular input control, the haptic feedback becomes stronger, providing a clear indication of the intended target.
    *   If the user moves *away* from a likely target, the haptic feedback weakens.
    *   Implement “sticky haptics” – a brief, localized haptic pulse when the user’s finger enters a zone, helping to anchor their attention.
    *   Vary haptic texture within zones to convey information. (e.g., a rough texture for “active” buttons, a smooth texture for informational displays).

3.  **Learning and Personalization:**
    *   Track user touch patterns (speed, accuracy, preferred controls, common errors) and use this data to refine the haptic zone generation and modulation algorithms.
    *   Create user profiles to store personalized haptic settings.
    *   Implement a “haptic learning mode” where the system provides exaggerated haptic feedback to help users learn the layout of the touchscreen.

4.  **System Components:**
    *   Touchscreen with haptic feedback capabilities (e.g., piezoelectric actuators, ultrasonic vibration).
    *   One or more processors.
    *   Memory for storing data and algorithms.
    *   Software modules for:
        *   Touch detection and tracking.
        *   Angle and distance calculation.
        *   Haptic zone generation.
        *   Haptic feedback control.
        *   User profile management.
        *   Machine learning algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Zone Generation):**

```
// Input:  firstTouchLocation (x, y), secondTouchLocation (x, y), historicalTouchData
// Output: HapticZoneArray (array of zones with intensity levels)

function generateHapticZones(firstTouchLocation, secondTouchLocation, historicalTouchData) {

  angle = calculateAngle(firstTouchLocation, secondTouchLocation)
  distance = calculateDistance(firstTouchLocation, secondTouchLocation)

  // Predict likely target controls based on angle, distance, and historical data
  likelyTargets = predictTargetControls(angle, distance, historicalTouchData)

  // Create zones around likely targets
  for each target in likelyTargets {
    zone = createZone(target.location, target.size)

    // Calculate intensity based on proximity, prediction confidence, and user preferences
    intensity = calculateIntensity(zone, angle, distance, userPreferences)

    zone.intensity = intensity
    HapticZoneArray.add(zone)
  }

  return HapticZoneArray
}
