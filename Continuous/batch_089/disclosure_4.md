## Adaptive Record Boundary Detection

**Specification:** A system to dynamically determine record boundaries within unstructured data streams, optimizing parsing efficiency based on observed data characteristics.

**Core Concept:** Instead of relying solely on pre-defined delimiters, the system learns common record boundary patterns *during* data ingestion, allowing it to intelligently predict and verify boundaries with increasing accuracy. This bypasses potential delimiter inconsistencies or missing delimiters, substantially improving robustness and parsing speed.

**Components:**

1.  **Boundary Pattern Analyzer:** Continuously monitors incoming data streams, identifying statistically significant character sequences or byte patterns that frequently precede or follow record boundaries.
2.  **Adaptive Boundary Model:** A dynamically updated model storing identified boundary patterns, their frequencies, and associated confidence levels. Utilizes a sliding window approach to prioritize recent data patterns.
3.  **Boundary Verification Engine:**  When a potential record boundary is detected (either through a delimiter or a predicted pattern), this engine verifies its validity using the Adaptive Boundary Model and a configurable confidence threshold.
4.  **Fallback Mechanism:**  If boundary verification fails, the system reverts to a pre-defined delimiter or a basic character-by-character search, ensuring data integrity.
5. **Confidence Weighting:** Boundary predictions are weighted based on data source, record type (if known), and the age of the pattern in the sliding window. More recent patterns from reliable sources have higher weight.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
slidingWindowSize = 10000 // Adjustable parameter
confidenceThreshold = 0.8 // Adjustable parameter
boundaryPatterns = {} // Dictionary to store boundary patterns

// Data Ingestion Loop
for each dataChunk in dataStream:
    for each potentialBoundary in dataChunk:
        pattern = extractPattern(potentialBoundary, patternLength) // Extract pattern around boundary
        if pattern in boundaryPatterns:
            boundaryPatterns[pattern].frequency += 1
            boundaryPatterns[pattern].age = 0 // Reset age
        else:
            boundaryPatterns[pattern] = {
                "frequency": 1,
                "age": slidingWindowSize // Initial age
            }

    // Age all patterns
    for pattern in boundaryPatterns:
        boundaryPatterns[pattern].age += 1

    // Prune old patterns
    remove patterns where boundaryPatterns[pattern].age > slidingWindowSize

    //Record Boundary Detection
    if delimiter found:
        record = split(dataChunk, delimiter)
    else:
        // Find potential boundaries based on pattern matching
        potentialBoundaries = findBoundaries(dataChunk, boundaryPatterns, confidenceThreshold)
        if potentialBoundaries:
            record = split(dataChunk, potentialBoundaries)
        else:
            record = dataChunk // No boundary found, process entire chunk

    processRecord(record)
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Replace the frequency-based model with a more sophisticated machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) to predict boundaries with higher accuracy.
*   **Data Source Awareness:** Incorporate data source information to prioritize boundary patterns specific to each source.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Automatically adjust the confidence threshold based on data characteristics and system performance.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze surrounding data to improve boundary prediction accuracy (e.g., identifying field separators within a record).
