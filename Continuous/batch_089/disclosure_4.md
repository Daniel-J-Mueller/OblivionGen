## Dynamic Sensor Weighting via Learned Attention Modulation

**Concept:** Extend the cross-modal transformer concept by introducing a dynamic weighting system for input sensor data *before* feature extraction. This goes beyond simply fusing features; it actively prioritizes relevant sensor streams based on environmental context *and* task demands.  The system learns to ‘listen’ more intently to sensors providing crucial information at a given moment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   Existing sensor suite (image sensors, LiDAR, radar, IMU – adaptable to various configurations).
*   Dedicated, low-latency processing unit (FPGA or similar) for pre-processing and attention modulation.
*   High-bandwidth communication bus between sensors, pre-processing unit, and main processing system.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Sensor Input Module:** Receives raw data streams from all sensors.
*   **Contextual Analysis Module:** Analyzes incoming data (using lightweight CNNs or similar) to identify environmental context (e.g., low light, heavy rain, dense foliage, urban canyon, open field).  Outputs a context vector.
*   **Task Demand Module:**  Receives high-level task instructions (e.g., obstacle avoidance, lane keeping, object recognition) and translates these into a task vector.
*   **Attention Modulation Network (AMN):** This is the core innovation.
    *   Input: Context vector, Task vector, Raw sensor data.
    *   Architecture:  A multi-layer perceptron (MLP) or small transformer network.
    *   Output: A per-sensor weighting factor (between 0 and 1).  These factors determine the contribution of each sensor's data to the overall fused input.
*   **Weighted Sensor Fusion Module:** Applies the weighting factors to the raw sensor data before feeding it to the existing cross-modal transformer.  This can be implemented as a simple multiplication of the sensor data by the corresponding weight, or a more sophisticated blending operation.
*   **Cross-Modal Transformer:**  Utilizes the weighted sensor data as input, performing feature extraction and fusion as described in the original patent.

**3. Training Procedure:**

*   **Dataset:** A large-scale, diverse dataset of sensor data collected in various environments and task scenarios.
*   **Loss Function:** A combination of:
    *   Task-specific loss (e.g., classification accuracy, regression error).
    *   Regularization term to prevent excessive weighting of any single sensor.
    *   Optional: Adversarial loss to encourage the AMN to learn robust and generalizable weighting strategies.
*   **Training:** End-to-end training of the AMN and cross-modal transformer.

**4. Pseudocode (AMN):**

```
function calculate_sensor_weights(context_vector, task_vector, sensor_data):
  # Concatenate context and task vectors
  combined_vector = concatenate(context_vector, task_vector)

  # Pass through MLP (or small transformer)
  weight_logits = MLP(combined_vector)  # Output size = number of sensors

  # Apply softmax to get probability distribution (weights)
  sensor_weights = softmax(weight_logits)

  # Apply weights to sensor data
  weighted_sensor_data = sensor_data * sensor_weights

  return weighted_sensor_data, sensor_weights
```

**5. Potential Applications:**

*   Autonomous vehicles: Adapt to changing weather conditions, lighting, and road surfaces.
*   Robotics: Enhance perception in cluttered or dynamic environments.
*   AR/VR: Improve tracking and scene understanding.
*   Surveillance: Adapt to different lighting conditions and target behaviors.
