## Personalized Affect-Driven Content Prioritization

**Concept:** Expand beyond object-focused filtering to incorporate real-time emotional state detection and use that data to dynamically prioritize supplemental content. The existing patent focuses on *what* a user is looking at. This builds on that by asking *how* they are feeling while looking at it.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Existing:** First and second client devices capable of displaying video and chat data (as per the base patent).
*   **Added:**
    *   **Facial Expression Analysis Camera:** High-resolution camera integrated into the first client device (or an external USB camera). Minimum 30 FPS.
    *   **Biometric Sensor Array:**  Integrated into the first client device. Includes:
        *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Sensor:**  Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor.
        *   **Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) Sensor:** Measures skin conductance.
    *   **Enhanced Processing Unit:**  Increased processing power on the first client device to handle real-time biometric data analysis and machine learning inference.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Affect Recognition Module:**
    *   **Facial Expression Analysis:** Utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) trained on large datasets of facial expressions (e.g., FER2013, AffectNet). Outputs probabilities for core emotions (Happiness, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Disgust, Neutral).
    *   **Physiological Signal Processing:**  Processes HRV and GSR data to derive metrics related to arousal and valence (positive/negative emotional states). Utilizes time-frequency analysis (e.g., Wavelet Transform) to extract relevant features.
    *   **Emotion Fusion Engine:** Combines facial expression probabilities and physiological metrics using a weighted averaging or machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) to estimate overall emotional state. Outputs a valence-arousal map.
*   **Content Prioritization Engine:**
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Performs sentiment analysis on supplemental content (chat messages, article snippets) to determine the emotional tone.
    *   **Contextual Matching:** Matches the user's current emotional state (valence-arousal map) with the sentiment of supplemental content. Prioritizes content that aligns with or complements the userâ€™s emotions.
    *   **Dynamic Filtering:** Filters supplemental content based on the prioritized list, ensuring that the user sees content relevant to their emotional state.
*   **User Profile Management:**
    *   Stores historical emotional data and content preferences.
    *   Adapts prioritization algorithms based on long-term user behavior.

**III. System Workflow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** The facial expression analysis camera and biometric sensor array continuously capture data from the first client device user.
2.  **Affect Recognition:** The Affect Recognition Module processes the captured data to estimate the user's current emotional state (valence-arousal map).
3.  **Content Analysis:** The Content Prioritization Engine analyzes the sentiment of supplemental content.
4.  **Prioritization & Filtering:** The Content Prioritization Engine matches the user's emotional state with the sentiment of supplemental content and prioritizes/filters accordingly.
5.  **Content Delivery:** The prioritized/filtered content is sent to the first client device for display.
6.  **User Profile Update:** User emotional data and content interactions are stored in the user profile for future personalization.

**IV. Pseudocode (Content Prioritization Engine):**

```
function prioritizeContent(userEmotion, contentList) {
  prioritizedList = []
  for each content in contentList {
    contentSentiment = analyzeSentiment(content)
    similarityScore = calculateEmotionSimilarity(userEmotion, contentSentiment)
    prioritizedList.push({content: content, score: similarityScore})
  }
  // Sort prioritizedList by score in descending order
  prioritizedList.sort(function(a, b) {
    return b.score - a.score
  })
  return prioritizedList
}

function calculateEmotionSimilarity(userEmotion, contentSentiment) {
  // Example: Simple distance metric (Euclidean distance in valence-arousal space)
  distance = sqrt(pow(userEmotion.valence - contentSentiment.valence, 2) +
                 pow(userEmotion.arousal - contentSentiment.arousal, 2))
  // Normalize distance to get a similarity score (higher is better)
  similarityScore = 1 / (1 + distance)
  return similarityScore
}
```

**V. Potential Applications:**

*   **Live Event Enhancement:** Prioritize chat messages and commentary based on the audience's emotional reactions during a sporting event or concert.
*   **Personalized News Feeds:** Filter news articles and social media posts based on the user's emotional state, providing content that is uplifting or informative depending on their needs.
*   **Educational Tools:** Adapt learning content based on the student's emotional engagement, providing support when they are frustrated or challenging them when they are bored.
