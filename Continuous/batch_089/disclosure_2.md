## Dynamic Environmental Mapping for Predictive Device State

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple user presence detection to create a dynamic environmental map that *predicts* user needs and proactively adjusts device state. This moves beyond reactive triggering to anticipatory adaptation.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Existing sensors (as per the patent): Proximity, touch, audio.
    *   **Added Sensors:** Low-resolution wide-angle camera (for object/scene recognition), Barometric pressure sensor, Temperature sensor, Ambient light sensor (expanded spectrum).
*   **Data Processing Unit (DPU):** Dedicated processor for sensor fusion and environmental map creation.
*   **Memory:** Solid-state storage for environmental map data, historical usage patterns, and learned preferences.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Mapping:** Upon device activation, the sensor suite begins capturing data to create a baseline environmental map. This map stores:
    *   Spatial layout (using camera and potentially LiDAR if added).
    *   Object identification (furniture, appliances, etc.).
    *   Ambient conditions (temperature, light, pressure).
    *   Audio profile (baseline noise levels, common sounds).

2.  **Behavioral Learning:** The DPU tracks user interactions and correlates them with the environmental map. This includes:
    *   Time of day and location.
    *   Activities (e.g., watching TV, reading, cooking).
    *   Device usage patterns (e.g., app launches, volume levels).
    *   User proximity to specific objects.

3.  **Predictive State Adjustment:** The DPU uses machine learning algorithms to predict user needs based on the environmental map, behavioral data, and time of day.  For example:
    *   **Scenario 1: Morning Routine:** User approaches kitchen (detected by proximity and object recognition). Device automatically turns on news/music streaming, displays weather forecast on screen, and adjusts lighting.
    *   **Scenario 2: Evening Relaxation:** User sits on couch (detected by proximity and object recognition). Device dims lights, turns on ambient music, and prompts for streaming service selection.
    *   **Scenario 3: Workspace Adaptation:** User approaches desk (detected by proximity and object recognition). Device activates work applications, adjusts screen brightness, and silences notifications.

4.  **Dynamic Map Updates:** The environmental map is continuously updated in real-time based on sensor input. Changes in room layout (e.g., moving furniture), object placement, or environmental conditions are reflected in the map.

**Pseudocode for Predictive Engine:**

```
function predictNextState(currentEnvironment, userHistory, currentTime) {
  // 1. Feature Extraction
  features = extractFeatures(currentEnvironment, userHistory, currentTime)

  // 2. Prediction
  predictedState = machineLearningModel.predict(features)

  // 3. State Transition
  transitionToState(predictedState)
}

function extractFeatures(environment, history, time) {
  features = []
  features.append(environment.location)
  features.append(environment.objectsPresent)
  features.append(history.recentActivities)
  features.append(time.timeOfDay)
  features.append(history.preferredSettings)
  return features
}

function transitionToState(newState) {
  if (newState == "Reading Mode") {
    dimLights()
    launchReadingApp()
    adjustScreenBrightness()
  } else if (newState == "Cooking Mode") {
    launchRecipeApp()
    displayRecipeInstructions()
  }
  //... other state transitions
}
```

**Power Management Considerations:**

*   Use low-power sensors whenever possible.
*   Implement aggressive power saving modes when the device is idle.
*   Dynamically adjust sensor sampling rates based on user activity and environmental conditions.
*   Utilize edge computing to perform data processing locally, reducing the need for cloud connectivity.

**Further Enhancements:**

*   Integrate with smart home systems to control lighting, temperature, and other devices.
*   Allow users to customize their preferred settings and create personalized routines.
*   Implement a privacy mode to disable data collection and personalization features.
*   Add support for voice control and gesture recognition.
