## Adaptive Acoustic Zones - Wearable Spatial Audio System

**System Overview:** A wearable system creating personalized, dynamically adjusting acoustic zones around the user, prioritizing relevant audio while actively suppressing distractions, extending beyond simple noise cancellation.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Wearable Unit:** A lightweight, modular unit integrating:
    *   High-resolution microphone array (minimum 8 microphones) - directional and omnidirectional.
    *   Bone conduction transducer – primary audio output.
    *   Miniature, high-bandwidth wireless communication module (Bluetooth 6.0 / Wi-Fi 6E).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 9-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer.
    *   Edge AI Processor – dedicated for real-time audio analysis and zone creation.
    *   Rechargeable battery.
*   **Optional Remote Sensors:** Distributed network of low-power acoustic sensors – placed in environments (office, home, vehicle) – providing environmental audio data.

**Software & Algorithms:**

1.  **Environmental Mapping:** The system builds a dynamic 3D acoustic map of the surrounding environment using data from:
    *   Wearable microphone array.
    *   Remote acoustic sensors (if available).
    *   IMU data – head orientation, movement, and proximity to surfaces.
2.  **Source Localization & Classification:** Real-time audio analysis (using the Edge AI Processor) identifies individual sound sources:
    *   **Beamforming:** Isolates specific audio sources through directional microphone processing.
    *   **Source Classification:** AI-driven identification of sound types – speech, music, alarms, mechanical noise, etc.
    *   **Semantic Analysis:** For speech – identifies keywords and context to determine relevance to the user.
3.  **Dynamic Zone Creation:** Based on source localization, classification, and user preferences, the system creates a series of virtual “acoustic zones”:
    *   **Priority Zone:** Focuses audio from relevant sources directly towards the user’s ears via bone conduction.
    *   **Attenuation Zone:** Suppresses distracting sounds by generating opposing sound waves (active noise cancellation). This is highly selective, targeting specific frequencies of unwanted sounds.
    *   **Transition Zones:** Smoothly blends audio between zones, preventing abrupt changes and creating a natural listening experience.
4.  **Predictive Audio Shaping:** Utilizes machine learning to anticipate sound events:
    *   **Movement Prediction:** Based on user movement and environment mapping, predicts upcoming sounds (e.g., approaching vehicle, closing door).
    *   **Event Anticipation:** Anticipates common sound events based on time of day, location, and user schedule.
5.  **User Interface:**
    *   Mobile app for customization of zones, preferences, and sound profiles.
    *   Voice control for on-the-fly adjustments.

**Pseudocode - Zone Adjustment Algorithm:**

```
// Input: Audio stream from microphone array
//        User profile (preferences, schedules, keywords)
//        Environmental map (source locations, types)

function adjustZones() {
  audioData = getAudioStream();
  userProfile = getUserProfile();
  environmentalMap = getEnvironmentalMap();

  // 1. Source Localization & Classification
  sources = analyzeAudio(audioData); // Returns array of sound sources (location, type, confidence)

  // 2. Relevance Filtering
  relevantSources = filterSources(sources, userProfile); // Filter based on user keywords, schedule, etc.

  // 3. Zone Creation & Adjustment
  for each source in relevantSources {
    createPriorityZone(source); // Focus audio from this source
  }

  for each source not in relevantSources {
    createAttenuationZone(source); // Suppress audio from this source
  }

  // 4. Dynamic Adjustment (based on user movement, environment changes)
  adjustZoneParameters(based on IMU data, environmental map, etc.);

  outputAudio = generateAudioStream(priorityZones, attenuationZones);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Communication:** Isolates speech in noisy environments, improving clarity and reducing listener fatigue.
*   **Increased Productivity:** Blocks out distractions in open offices or crowded spaces.
*   **Improved Safety:** Highlights critical sounds (alarms, warnings) while suppressing background noise.
*   **Immersive Audio Experiences:** Creates personalized soundscapes for entertainment and relaxation.
*   **Accessibility:** Assists individuals with hearing impairments by enhancing specific sounds.
