## Dynamic Data Masking with Contextual Access Control

**Specification:** Implement a system for granular data masking *during* query execution, adapting the masking level based on the querying user’s role *and* the specific data being requested, rather than relying on static masking rules.  This builds on the ‘protected range’ concept, but adds real-time dynamism.

**Components:**

*   **Context Engine:**  A service responsible for determining the appropriate masking level. It receives the user’s role/permissions, the table/field being queried, and the data *values* being requested (or a representative sample).
*   **Masking Profiles:** Define masking rules for each field. These rules can range from simple redaction to complex transformations (e.g., pseudonymization, data generalization, noise addition).  Crucially, profiles are *parameterized* allowing the Context Engine to adjust the masking strength.
*   **Query Interceptor:** Sits between the application and the database.  It intercepts queries, passes relevant information to the Context Engine, receives the masking profile parameters, and applies the masking *before* sending the query to the database.
*   **Secure Parameter Store:**  Holds the parameters for the masking profiles, encrypted and accessible only to the Context Engine.

**Workflow:**

1.  User submits a query.
2.  Query Interceptor intercepts the query and extracts relevant metadata (table, fields, potentially a sample of values).
3.  Query Interceptor sends a request to the Context Engine, including the user’s role/permissions and the query metadata.
4.  Context Engine determines the appropriate masking profile parameters based on the user's role, the queried data, and potentially external factors (e.g., data sensitivity level).
5.  Context Engine returns the parameters to the Query Interceptor.
6.  Query Interceptor *dynamically* modifies the query based on the parameters, effectively masking the data. This could involve:
    *   Replacing specific values with masked equivalents.
    *   Adding filtering conditions to exclude sensitive data.
    *   Applying transformations to the data.
7.  Modified query is sent to the database.
8.  Database returns the masked results.

**Pseudocode (Query Interceptor - Masking Logic):**

```
function applyMasking(query, userRole, maskingProfileParams) {
  // Parse query to identify fields being selected
  fields = parseQueryFields(query);

  for (field in fields) {
    if (field in maskingProfileParams) {
      maskingType = maskingProfileParams[field].type;
      maskingStrength = maskingProfileParams[field].strength;

      if (maskingType == "REDACTION") {
        // Replace field values with a placeholder (e.g., "XXXX")
        query = replaceFieldValue(query, field, "XXXX");
      } else if (maskingType == "PSEUDONYMIZATION") {
        // Apply a pseudonymous transformation based on the user’s ID or a salt
        // (Requires a secure hash function and key management)
        query = pseudonymizeFieldValue(query, field, userRole);
      } else if (maskingType == "GENERALIZATION") {
        // Round or bucket values to a coarser granularity
        query = generalizeFieldValue(query, field, maskingStrength);
      }
    }
  }
  return query;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MaskingProfile`:  { fieldName: { type: "REDACTION" | "PSEUDONYMIZATION" | "GENERALIZATION", strength: number } }
*   `UserRole`:  { roleName: string, permissions: array of string }

**Scalability & Security:**

*   Caching of masking profile parameters to reduce Context Engine load.
*   Secure storage of sensitive data (e.g., pseudonymous mapping keys) using hardware security modules (HSMs).
*   Auditing of all data masking operations.
