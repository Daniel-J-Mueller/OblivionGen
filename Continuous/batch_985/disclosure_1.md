## Electronic Device - Modular Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** A device incorporating a modular, dynamically reconfigurable haptic feedback system embedded within its casing. Users can physically customize the device's tactile response by swapping, adding, or repositioning haptic modules.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Form Factor:** Slab-style handheld device (similar dimensions to a smartphone, but with slightly increased thickness to accommodate modules).
*   **Casing Material:**  Polycarbonate with embedded conductive tracks. Tracks are exposed on the interior surface of the device casing.
*   **Haptic Modules:** Small, self-contained units (approx. 1cm x 1cm x 0.5cm). Each module contains:
    *   Miniature linear resonant actuator (LRA) or piezoelectric actuator.
    *   Microcontroller for individual module control.
    *   Magnetic base for attachment to the conductive tracks within the casing.
    *   Wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy) for configuration and control.
*   **Module Attachment:** Modules attach magnetically to designated zones within the device casing.  Conductive tracks provide power and data communication.
*   **Zoning:** The interior of the device casing is divided into discrete zones. Each zone corresponds to a specific area on the device’s exterior surface (e.g., sides, back, corners).
*   **Software Interface:**  Companion app allowing users to:
    *   Visually map haptic module locations within the device.
    *   Customize haptic feedback profiles per module (intensity, frequency, pattern).
    *   Assign haptic feedback to specific system events (notifications, touch input, game actions).
    *   Share/download custom haptic profiles.
*   **Power:** Modules draw power from the device's battery via the conductive tracks.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Device communicates with modules via a proprietary protocol over the conductive tracks.  Bluetooth is used for initial setup and advanced configuration.

**Pseudocode (Module Control):**

```
// Module Initialization
function initModule(moduleID, zoneID) {
  connectToDevice(zoneID);
  setModuleID(moduleID);
  setCommunicationProtocol(PROTOCOL_VERSION_1);
  requestFirmwareUpdate();
}

// Receive Command from Device
function receiveCommand(commandType, commandData) {
  switch (commandType) {
    case HAPTIC_PLAY:
      playHapticPattern(commandData.pattern);
      break;
    case HAPTIC_STOP:
      stopHapticPattern();
      break;
    case SET_INTENSITY:
      setIntensity(commandData.intensity);
      break;
    case SET_FREQUENCY:
      setFrequency(commandData.frequency);
      break;
    default:
      logError("Unknown command");
  }
}

// Play Haptic Pattern
function playHapticPattern(pattern) {
  // Decode pattern data
  // Activate actuator based on pattern data
}

// Stop Haptic Pattern
function stopHapticPattern() {
  // Deactivate actuator
}

// Set Intensity
function setIntensity(intensity) {
  // Adjust actuator power based on intensity
}

// Set Frequency
function setFrequency(frequency) {
  // Adjust actuator frequency
}
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

This design moves beyond fixed haptic feedback.  Users aren’t limited by pre-defined vibrations. The modularity allows for highly personalized and dynamic tactile experiences. Damage to a single haptic module would not render the entire system inoperable – the module could be easily replaced. Furthermore, the system could be expanded with future haptic technologies without requiring a complete device overhaul.
