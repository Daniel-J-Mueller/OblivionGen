## Dynamic Content Weight Prediction & Pre-emptive Optimization

**Concept:** Extend the latency/weight limiting system to *predict* potential weight/latency issues *before* deployment, leveraging machine learning models trained on historical data and content characteristics.  Instead of simply rejecting deployments exceeding thresholds, proactively optimize content *before* it's served.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module:** Continuously gather data on:
    *   Page weight & latency (existing system data)
    *   Content type (image, video, script, text - automated categorization)
    *   Content metadata (image resolution, video bitrate, script size, text length)
    *   User agent/device type (to model device-specific performance)
    *   Network conditions (estimated bandwidth, latency â€“ potentially via passive monitoring or user-reported data)
*   **ML Model Training:** Train a regression model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict page weight and latency based on the collected data. Separate models for different content types could improve accuracy. Continuous retraining with new data is crucial.
*   **Pre-Deployment Optimization Pipeline:**
    1.  When a page is requested for deployment, analyze its content.
    2.  Feed content characteristics into the trained ML model to *predict* page weight and latency.
    3.  If predicted values exceed defined thresholds, trigger an optimization pipeline:
        *   **Image Optimization:** Automated compression, resizing, format conversion (WebP).
        *   **Video Optimization:** Transcoding to lower bitrates/resolutions, adaptive streaming setup.
        *   **Script Minification/Bundling:**  Reduce script size and number of requests.
        *   **Lazy Loading:** Defer loading of non-critical content (images, videos) until they are visible in the viewport.
        *   **Content Delivery Network (CDN) integration:**  Dynamically route requests to the nearest CDN edge server.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Allow operators to define different thresholds based on user segments or device types.  A mobile user on a slow network might have stricter thresholds than a desktop user on a fast connection.
*   **Optimization Feedback Loop:**  Monitor the performance of optimized content and feed the data back into the ML model to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function deployPage(pageContent, userAgent, networkConditions):
  predictedWeight = MLModel.predictWeight(pageContent, userAgent, networkConditions)
  predictedLatency = MLModel.predictLatency(pageContent, userAgent, networkConditions)

  if predictedWeight > maxWeight or predictedLatency > maxLatency:
    optimizedContent = optimizeContent(pageContent, predictedWeight, predictedLatency)
    deploy(optimizedContent)
  else:
    deploy(pageContent)

function optimizeContent(pageContent, predictedWeight, predictedLatency):
  # Apply image optimization, video transcoding, script minification, etc.
  # Adjust optimization levels based on predicted weight/latency.
  optimizedContent = pageContent 
  # Placeholder for optimization logic
  return optimizedContent
```
