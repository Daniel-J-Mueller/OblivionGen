## Dynamic Spatial Audio Morphing with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** A system that dynamically adjusts spatial audio characteristics (direction, distance, reverberation) based on real-time biofeedback data from the user, creating an immersive and personalized audio experience that adapts to their emotional and physiological state. The core inspiration comes from the patent's focus on reconfigurable filter banks, but expands it beyond simple frequency separation to full spatial audio manipulation, and adds a biofeedback loop.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Multi-channel audio stream (minimum 5.1 surround).
    *   Biofeedback sensors: EEG (brainwave activity), GSR (galvanic skin response/sweat), heart rate variability (HRV).
    *   User profile data (optional): age, gender, preferred music genres, sensitivity levels.

*   **Processing Core: Bio-Spatial Audio Engine (BSAE)**
    *   **Biofeedback Analysis Module:**
        *   Real-time processing of biofeedback signals.
        *   Feature extraction: Identify key emotional/physiological states (e.g., relaxation, focus, excitement, stress).
        *   Mapping to Audio Parameters:  Develop a lookup table or machine learning model to map biofeedback features to spatial audio parameters (see Audio Parameter Control).
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:**
        *   Utilizes a higher-order Ambisonics (HOA) rendering system.  Minimum order: 3rd.
        *   Employ a reconfigurable filter bank, as in the original patent, but extended to apply to individual Ambisonic components (spherical harmonics).  Each filter bank handles a specific range of spherical harmonics, allowing for precise spectral shaping of the spatial audio field.
        *   Dynamic Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) Selection: Use HRTFs that dynamically adjust based on emotional state (e.g., wider spatial image for excitement, narrower for focus).
    *   **Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC):** Integrated AEC to reduce unwanted reflections and ensure accurate sound localization.

*   **Audio Parameter Control:**
    *   **Direction:** Dynamically pan sound sources based on biofeedback (e.g., calming sounds originating from a stable, centered position, energizing sounds sweeping across the soundscape).
    *   **Distance:** Adjust the perceived distance of sound sources to create a sense of intimacy or spaciousness (e.g., close proximity for relaxation, far away for vastness).
    *   **Reverberation:** Modulate reverberation time and density to simulate different acoustic environments (e.g., long, lush reverb for dreamlike states, short, dry reverb for focus).
    *   **Spectral Tilt:** Adjust the frequency balance of the soundscape to enhance certain emotions (e.g., emphasize low frequencies for grounding, emphasize high frequencies for alertness).
    *   **Ambisonic Component Filtering:** Individual filtering of HOA components using the reconfigurable filter bank to sculpt the spatial audio field.

*   **Output:**
    *   Multi-channel audio stream delivered to headphones or surround sound system.

**Pseudocode (BSAE Core):**

```
loop:
    bio_data = read_biofeedback_sensors()
    emotional_state = analyze_biofeedback(bio_data)

    // Retrieve appropriate audio parameters based on emotional state
    direction = lookup_table[emotional_state].direction
    distance = lookup_table[emotional_state].distance
    reverb = lookup_table[emotional_state].reverb
    spectral_tilt = lookup_table[emotional_state].spectral_tilt
    filter_config = lookup_table[emotional_state].filter_config

    //Render Spatial Audio
    audio_signal = load_audio_source()
    spatialized_signal = render_spatial_audio(audio_signal, direction, distance, reverb, spectral_tilt, filter_config)

    // Output to Audio Device
    play_audio(spatialized_signal)
```

**Further Refinements:**

*   **AI-Driven Parameter Optimization:** Employ machine learning algorithms to continuously refine the mapping between biofeedback data and audio parameters, personalizing the experience for each user.
*   **Adaptive Filtering:** Implement adaptive filters within the reconfigurable filter bank to automatically compensate for changes in the acoustic environment and user head movements.
*   **Haptic Integration:** Combine spatial audio with haptic feedback to create a more immersive and multi-sensory experience.
*   **Neural Correlates:** Conduct research to identify specific neural correlates of emotional states and use this information to refine the biofeedback analysis module.
