**Dynamic Document 'Heatmaps' & AI-Driven Proactive Editing Suggestions**

**Concept:** Expand the tracking of reading activity beyond simple metrics (page turns, dwell time) to generate a visual ‘heatmap’ overlay on the document indicating areas of high cognitive load for the reader. Then, use AI to *proactively* suggest edits to those areas, presented *directly* within the document editing interface.

**Specs:**

1.  **Reading Activity Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Eye-Tracking Integration (Optional):** If available (via webcam or external device), track gaze points and saccades.
    *   **Dwell Time Analysis:** Record time spent on each paragraph/section.
    *   **Scrolling Behavior:** Analyze scrolling speed and frequent backtracking.
    *   **Selection Analysis:** Track text selections, highlighting, and copying.
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** (If reader is also editing) – analyze pauses, corrections, and hesitations while typing.

2.  **Cognitive Load Calculation Engine:**
    *   Combine data from the Reading Activity Sensor Suite.
    *   Utilize algorithms to assign a "cognitive load score" to each section of the document.  Factors: High dwell time + frequent backtracking + many selections = high score.
    *   Implement a dynamic weighting system based on document type (e.g., technical manual vs. creative writing).

3.  **Heatmap Overlay:**
    *   Visually represent the cognitive load score on the document using a color gradient (e.g., green = low load, red = high load).
    *   Allow users to toggle the heatmap on/off.
    *   Provide adjustable heatmap sensitivity.

4.  **AI-Powered Editing Suggestions:**
    *   Train an AI model (Transformer-based language model) on a large corpus of well-written text.
    *   When a section of the document has a high cognitive load score:
        *   The AI model analyzes the section for clarity, conciseness, and complexity.
        *   Generate one or more suggested edits (e.g., rephrasing a sentence, breaking up a long paragraph, simplifying jargon).
        *   Display the suggestions *directly within the document*, similar to spellcheck or grammar check.  Highlight the problematic text and show the suggested replacement.
        *   Allow the user to accept, reject, or modify the suggestions.
        *   Provide a confidence score for each suggestion.
        *   Allow the user to customize the AI’s editing style (e.g., formal vs. informal, technical vs. layman's terms).

5.  **Collaborative Editing Integration:**
    *   Show which sections have high cognitive load for *different readers*.  This helps identify areas of confusion that may be specific to certain users.
    *   Allow multiple readers to provide feedback on AI suggestions.

**Pseudocode (AI Suggestion Generation):**

```
function generate_suggestion(text_section, cognitive_load_score):
  if cognitive_load_score > threshold:
    suggestion = AI_model.analyze(text_section)
    if suggestion.confidence > 0.7:
      return suggestion.replacement_text, suggestion.confidence
    else:
      return null, null
  else:
    return null, null

function display_suggestion(text_section, suggestion, confidence):
    highlight_text(text_section)
    display_popup(suggestion, confidence)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Suggestions:** Tailor the AI’s editing style to the individual reader's reading level and preferences.
*   **Real-Time Editing:** Generate suggestions as the reader is actively reading the document.
*   **Document Complexity Score:** Calculate an overall document complexity score to provide a quick assessment of readability.
*   **A/B Testing:** Allow users to A/B test different versions of the document with varying levels of AI-generated edits.
