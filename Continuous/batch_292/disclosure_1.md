## Dynamic Key Shard Distribution & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand upon the domain key concept by *sharding* domain keys into multiple parts distributed across the HSM fleet. Instead of a single HSM possessing the full domain key, a quorum of HSMs must collaborate to reconstruct it. This introduces a much higher level of security and resilience against compromise.

**Specifications:**

*   **Key Shard Generation:** The HSM Management Hub, upon domain creation, generates *n* key shards from the domain key using a robust secret sharing algorithm (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing). *n* is configurable and represents the total number of shares.
*   **Shard Distribution:** Each HSM within the domain’s subset receives *one* unique key shard. Distribution is authenticated and encrypted, leveraging the fleet key for initial transport.
*   **Key Reconstruction Protocol:**
    1.  An HSM needing to decrypt material encrypted with the domain key initiates a ‘Key Reconstruction Request’ to the HSM Management Hub.
    2.  The Hub identifies a sufficient quorum of HSMs (e.g., *k* out of *n*) possessing shards for the requested domain key.
    3.  The Hub directs the selected HSMs to respond to the request.
    4.  Each selected HSM signs its shard with its private key, then sends it directly to the requesting HSM.
    5.  The requesting HSM verifies the signatures.
    6.  The requesting HSM uses the received shards and the secret sharing algorithm to reconstruct the domain key.
*   **Threshold for Reconstruction:** The number of shards (*k*) required for reconstruction is configurable and lower than *n*. This provides resilience against loss or compromise of individual HSMs.
*   **Dynamic Shard Rotation:** Periodically (configurable interval), the HSM Management Hub triggers a shard rotation. New shards are generated, and the distribution is updated. Old shards are securely erased. This mitigates long-term compromise.
*   **Shard Backup & Recovery:** Designated ‘Backup HSMs’ maintain a minimal set of encrypted shards for disaster recovery. These encrypted shards are secured with the fleet key and require the participation of other HSMs to unlock.
*   **Fleet Key Integration**: All communications relating to shard distribution, reconstruction requests, and encrypted backups are protected using the fleet key.
*   **Hardware Enforced Quorum:** HSMs participating in reconstruction have hardware-enforced limits on shard usage. A shard cannot be used to reconstruct more than one domain key at a time, preventing replay attacks.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
// HSM requesting key reconstruction
RequestKeyReconstruction(domainID)

// HSM Management Hub receives request
ReceiveKeyReconstructionRequest(domainID)

// Hub determines quorum of HSMs holding shards
quorumHSMs = DetermineQuorum(domainID)

// Hub directs HSMs to respond
ForEach (hsm in quorumHSMs) {
    SendKeyShardRequest(hsm, domainID)
}

// Receiving HSMs send shards
ReceiveKeyShard(shard, domainID, signingHSM)

// Verify signature
isValid = VerifySignature(shard, signingHSM)

If (isValid) {
    AddShardToReconstructionSet(shard)
}

// Once enough shards are collected
If (shardCount >= k) {
    domainKey = ReconstructKey(shardSet)
    // Use domainKey to decrypt material
}
```
