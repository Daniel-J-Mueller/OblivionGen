## Dynamic Graph Materialization for Real-Time Data Fusion

**Specification:** A system for dynamically materializing transformation graphs based on incoming data characteristics and resource availability.

**Core Concept:** Extend the static transformation specification format to a dynamic system where the graph itself isn’t fully defined upfront. Instead, the system *builds* the graph at runtime based on data content, available execution engines, and current system load.

**Components:**

*   **Data Characterization Module:** Analyzes incoming data streams to identify data types, schema, relationships, and potential transformation needs. Outputs a “data profile.”
*   **Graph Construction Engine:** Uses the data profile, a registry of available execution engines (and their capabilities), and real-time resource monitoring (CPU, memory, network) to dynamically construct the transformation graph.  The engine employs a cost-based optimization algorithm to select the most efficient graph structure.
*   **Execution Engine Registry:**  An enhanced registry that includes *partial* transformation capabilities. An engine doesn't need to be able to perform *all* transformations; it only needs to register for specific transformation *fragments*.
*   **Transformation Fragment Library:** A repository of pre-built transformation components (fragments) designed to be assembled into larger graphs. These fragments can be combined and chained to achieve complex transformations.
*   **Dynamic Graph Executor:** Executes the dynamically constructed graph, leveraging the selected execution engines. It monitors performance and can dynamically re-optimize the graph if bottlenecks are detected.

**Pseudocode (Graph Construction Engine - Simplified):**

```pseudocode
function constructGraph(dataProfile, engineRegistry, resourceMonitor):
  graph = emptyGraph()
  producerNodes = createProducerNodes(dataProfile)
  graph.addNodes(producerNodes)

  consumerNodes = determineConsumerNeeds(dataProfile)
  graph.addNodes(consumerNodes)

  transformationTasks = generateTransformationTasks(producerNodes, consumerNodes)

  sortedTasks = sortTasksByCost(transformationTasks, engineRegistry, resourceMonitor)

  for task in sortedTasks:
    bestEngine = findBestEngineForTask(task, engineRegistry, resourceMonitor)
    if bestEngine != null:
      transformationNode = createTransformationNode(task, bestEngine)
      graph.addEdge(task.sourceNode, transformationNode, task.destinationNode)
    else:
      //Handle case where no suitable engine exists (e.g., error, bypass)
      log("No engine found for task: " + task.name)

  return graph
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DataProfile`:  Dictionary of data characteristics (e.g., `{"type": "JSON", "schema": {...}, "relationships": ["A->B", "B->C"]}`).
*   `TransformationTask`: Object representing a transformation requirement (`{"name": "FilterRecords", "sourceNode": nodeA, "destinationNode": nodeB, "parameters": {...}}`).
*   `EngineCapability`:  List of supported transformation fragments (`["FilterRecords", "DataNormalization", "SchemaConversion"]`).

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static graph definitions to a self-optimizing, data-driven approach.  It decouples transformation *requirements* from specific *implementations*, allowing for greater flexibility and adaptability. The use of transformation fragments enables a modular and extensible transformation architecture.
