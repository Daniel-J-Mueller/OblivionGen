## Adaptive Mesh Network with Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive transmission power concept to a mesh network, proactively anticipating client device movement and seamlessly handing off connections *before* signal degradation occurs. This goes beyond simply reducing transmission power when overloaded; it involves predictive routing and dynamic mesh reconfiguration.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Types:**
    *   *Core Nodes:* High processing power, wired backhaul connection where available, act as central controllers.
    *   *Edge Nodes:* Lower power, wireless backhaul, responsible for direct client connections.
*   **Client Profiling:** Each connected client device maintains a “movement profile” – a rolling window of RSSI data from neighboring nodes, combined with device type (smartphone, laptop, IoT device) to predict likely movement patterns.
*   **Predictive Handover Algorithm:**
    1.  **Movement Prediction:** Based on the movement profile, the system predicts the client's location in the next 5-10 seconds.
    2.  **Optimal Node Selection:** Identifies the edge node that will provide the strongest signal at the *predicted* location.
    3.  **Pre-Authentication & Data Pre-fetch:** The client pre-authenticates with the target node. Critical data (e.g., streaming video buffer, active game state) is pre-fetched to the target node.
    4.  **Seamless Switching:** The client's connection is switched to the target node *before* signal degradation occurs, creating a seamless handover experience.
*   **Dynamic Mesh Reconfiguration:** 
    *   Nodes monitor link quality and client load.
    *   If a node becomes overloaded or experiences link failure, the system dynamically adjusts routing paths and reconfigures the mesh network to distribute traffic.
    *   Utilizes a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft) to ensure consistent network state.
*   **Adaptive Transmission Power:** Retain the original patent's adaptive transmission power feature, but use it in conjunction with the predictive handover and dynamic mesh reconfiguration. Nodes can adjust transmission power based on local load, client proximity, and predicted movement.
*   **Node Communication Protocol:** A custom protocol optimized for low latency and high reliability. Uses a combination of UDP for real-time data and TCP for control signaling.
*   **Backhaul Integration:** The system supports multiple backhaul options, including wired Ethernet, wireless mesh, and cellular.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Handover):**

```
// Client movement profile data structure
struct MovementProfile {
  timestamp: DateTime
  nodeID: String
  RSSI: Integer
}

// Function to predict client location
function predictClientLocation(clientMovementProfile: List<MovementProfile>) {
  // Analyze movement profile data
  // Use machine learning model to predict future location
  return predictedLocation
}

// Function to determine optimal node
function determineOptimalNode(predictedLocation, availableNodes) {
  // Calculate signal strength and distance to each node
  // Select node with highest signal strength and lowest latency
  return optimalNode
}

// Function to perform handover
function performHandover(client, currentNode, optimalNode) {
  // Pre-authenticate client with optimalNode
  // Prefetch data to optimalNode
  // Switch client connection to optimalNode
  // Disconnect client from currentNode
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Gather client movement profiles
  // Predict client locations
  // Determine optimal nodes
  // If optimal node is different from current node:
  //   performHandover(client, currentNode, optimalNode)
  //   currentNode = optimalNode
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-powered route optimization:** Use machine learning to predict network congestion and optimize routing paths.
*   **Energy efficiency:** Implement power saving modes for edge nodes based on client activity.
*   **Security:** Integrate advanced encryption and authentication protocols to protect network traffic.
*   **Beamforming:** Utilize beamforming technology to focus signal energy towards client devices.
