## Dynamic Power Shaping via Predictive Load Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the pulsed power regulation system to *anticipate* load demands rather than simply reacting to them. This involves integrating a predictive model of the load’s power requirements, enabling proactive power delivery and minimizing transient responses.

**Specs:**

*   **Predictive Load Model:**
    *   Input: Historical load data (current, voltage, usage patterns), real-time sensor data, user-defined profiles (e.g., ‘gaming’, ‘video conferencing’, ‘standby’).
    *   Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, trained on representative load profiles.  Alternative: Kalman Filter for simpler, real-time prediction.
    *   Output: Predicted current and voltage waveforms for the next 10-100ms. Confidence intervals accompanying predictions.
*   **Power Converter Control Loop Enhancement:**
    *   Integration of predicted waveforms into the existing constant current/pulsed current regulation.
    *   Feedforward control based on predicted demand. Pre-emptive adjustment of input current to the power converter.
    *   Adaptive weighting between feedforward (prediction-based) and feedback (real-time measurement-based) control. Weighting adjusted based on prediction confidence.
*   **Energy Storage Optimization:**
    *   Utilize predicted power demands to optimize energy storage (battery) usage.
    *   Pre-charge/pre-discharge energy storage elements to meet anticipated peaks/valleys in demand.
    *   Implement a “power shaping” function, smoothing out the overall power profile to extend battery life and reduce stress on components.
*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   High-speed data acquisition system for capturing load parameters.
    *   Dedicated processor for running the predictive model and control algorithms (e.g., FPGA or dedicated DSP).
    *   Fast-switching power converter capable of responding to dynamic current adjustments.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
LoadModel = InitializeRNN(HistoricalData)
CurrentFeedback = InitializeFeedbackControl()

// Main Loop
While (DeviceActive) {
  // 1. Load Prediction
  PredictedPower = LoadModel.Predict(RealtimeData)
  Confidence = LoadModel.GetConfidence()

  // 2. Feedback Control (baseline regulation)
  FeedbackAdjustment = CurrentFeedback.CalculateAdjustment(MeasuredCurrent, TargetCurrent)

  // 3. Predictive Adjustment
  PredictiveAdjustment = (1 - Confidence) * FeedbackAdjustment + Confidence * PredictedPower.Adjustment

  // 4. Combined Adjustment
  TotalAdjustment = PredictiveAdjustment

  // 5. Apply Adjustment to Power Converter
  SetPowerConverterCurrent(Current + TotalAdjustment)

  // 6. Update Historical Data
  LoadModel.Update(MeasuredCurrent, MeasuredVoltage)
}
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Explore different RNN architectures and training methodologies to improve prediction accuracy.
*   Implement a dynamic confidence estimation algorithm to adjust the weighting between feedforward and feedback control.
*   Investigate the use of reinforcement learning to optimize the power shaping function for specific load profiles.
*   Consider adding a fault detection mechanism to identify and compensate for unexpected load changes.
