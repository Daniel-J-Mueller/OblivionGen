## Dynamic Resource Morphing based on Predicted Client Need

**Specification:** A system enabling the dynamic, pre-emptive ‘morphing’ of cloud resources (compute, storage, network) *before* a client application explicitly requests them, based on predicted need derived from client attribute sets, historical usage, and real-time telemetry. This goes beyond simple autoscaling by *changing the type* of resource allocated, not just its quantity.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Predictive Engine:** A machine learning model trained on:
    *   Client attribute sets (as defined in the patent).
    *   Historical resource usage patterns for each client.
    *   Real-time telemetry from client applications (CPU, memory, network I/O).
    *   External data sources (e.g., market trends, seasonal demand).
2.  **Resource Morphing Manager:**  This component translates the Predictive Engine’s output into specific resource allocation changes.  It manages the provisioning and decommissioning of resources, ensuring minimal disruption to client applications.
3.  **Resource Type Catalog:**  A centralized repository defining the available resource types, their capabilities, and associated costs.  This allows the system to select the *optimal* resource type for each client’s predicted needs.
4.  **Client Profile Manager:** Stores and updates the client attribute sets, historical usage data, and real-time telemetry information.

**Workflow:**

1.  The Client Profile Manager continuously collects and updates the client profile.
2.  The Predictive Engine analyzes the client profile and generates a resource need forecast.
3.  The Resource Morphing Manager selects the optimal resource type from the Resource Type Catalog.
4.  The Resource Morphing Manager provisions the new resources and seamlessly migrates the client application or relevant components.
5.  The system monitors the client application’s performance and adjusts the resource allocation as needed.
6.  Unused resources are decommissioned to minimize costs.

**Pseudocode (Resource Morphing Manager):**

```
function MorphResources(clientAccount, predictedResourceNeeds) {

  // 1. Determine Current Resources
  currentResources = GetClientResources(clientAccount);

  // 2. Calculate Resource Delta
  resourceDelta = CalculateResourceDifference(predictedResourceNeeds, currentResources);

  // 3. Identify Resource Types to Add/Remove
  resourceChanges = OptimizeResourceChanges(resourceDelta); // considers cost, performance, availability

  // 4. Provision New Resources
  for each resource in resourceChanges.additions {
    provisionResource(resource.type, resource.quantity);
  }

  // 5. Decommission Old Resources
  for each resource in resourceChanges.removals {
    decommissionResource(resource.id);
  }

  // 6. Migrate Application Components (if applicable)
  migrateComponents(resourceChanges);

  // 7. Update Client Profile
  updateClientProfile(clientAccount, newResourceAllocation);

  return success;
}
```

**Novelty:**  Existing autoscaling systems react to demand.  This system *anticipates* demand and proactively adjusts resources – not just in quantity, but in *type* –  optimizing for both performance and cost before the client even experiences a bottleneck.  This goes beyond standard 'schema extension' by actively *using* the client attribute set to drive preemptive resource management. This system enables *proactive* resource allocation.
