## Dynamic Relevance Sculpting

**Concept:** Extend user-suggested search attributes beyond keywords and relevance explanations to include *dynamic* adjustments to existing item attributes, essentially 'sculpting' the item's profile in real-time based on collective user input.

**Specification:**

**1. Attribute Vectors:**

*   Each item in the data store maintains a primary attribute vector (manufacturer/seller provided data).
*   Alongside, a ‘delta vector’ tracks modifications suggested by users.  This delta vector contains weighted adjustments to the primary attribute vector’s values.  Weights reflect confidence scores (as in the original patent) and user trustworthiness.

**2. Suggestion Types:**

*   **Additive:** User suggests a new attribute not present in the primary vector (e.g., "Excellent for travel" for a backpack).  This creates a new element in the delta vector.
*   **Modifying:** User adjusts an existing attribute's value (e.g., changes 'water resistance' from ‘moderate’ to ‘high’ for a jacket).  This updates the corresponding element in the delta vector.
*   **Negating:** User indicates an attribute is *not* applicable or inaccurate (e.g., “Not suitable for hiking” for a specific shoe model).  This creates a negative weight in the delta vector.

**3.  Real-time Profile Adjustment:**

*   Incoming search queries apply a ‘blend factor’ to the primary and delta vectors.  This factor is dynamically calculated based on:
    *   Query context (what is the user *really* looking for?).
    *   User history (past searches, purchases).
    *   Confidence in user suggestions for that specific item.

*   The blended vector then becomes the active attribute profile for that search, effectively reshaping how the item is presented in results.

**4.  Visualization Layer (User Interface):**

*   A 'relevance sculpting' interface allows users to see how their suggestions are changing the item's profile.
*   Users can view the primary attributes, the delta vector adjustments, and the blended profile.
*   This visualization promotes transparency and encourages further refinement of suggestions.

**5.  Pseudocode (Search Query Processing):**

```pseudocode
function process_search_query(query, user_history):
  item_results = search_database(query)

  for item in item_results:
    primary_attributes = item.primary_attributes
    delta_attributes = item.delta_attributes

    // Calculate blend factor
    blend_factor = calculate_blend_factor(query, user_history, item.confidence_scores)

    // Blend attributes
    blended_attributes = blend_attributes(primary_attributes, delta_attributes, blend_factor)

    // Apply blended attributes to search ranking
    item.ranking_score = calculate_ranking_score(query, blended_attributes)

  return sorted(item_results, key=lambda item: item.ranking_score, reverse=True)
```

**6. Data Structure (Item Representation):**

```
Item {
    item_id: INT,
    primary_attributes: Dictionary<String, Value>,
    delta_attributes: Dictionary<String, Value>,
    confidence_scores: Dictionary<String, FLOAT>,
    user_trust_levels: Dictionary<User_ID, FLOAT>
}
```

**7.  Scaling Considerations:**

*   Delta attribute calculations can be parallelized across multiple servers.
*   Caching frequently accessed blended attribute profiles reduces latency.
*   Periodic consolidation of delta attributes into the primary attributes (with appropriate versioning) optimizes storage.
