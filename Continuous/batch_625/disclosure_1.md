## Adaptive Experiment Stratification via Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on iterative refinement of test values. This design proposes *proactive* stratification of experiment participants based on predicted responsiveness to different experience configurations *before* experiment initiation. This aims to accelerate optimization and reduce the required user base.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Collects baseline user data: demographics, usage patterns within the application (frequency, features used, session length), device information (model, OS, network speed), and potentially external data (time of day, location - with user consent).
    *   Data is anonymized and securely stored.
2.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
    *   Employs machine learning models (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) trained on historical experiment data.  This historical data connects user attributes to their response to various experience configurations.
    *   The engine predicts a "Responsiveness Profile" for each new user. This profile estimates the user's likelihood of showing statistically significant improvement (or degradation) with specific test factors and values.  Output is a vector representing predicted response scores for each factor/value combination.
    *   Model is continuously retrained with new experiment data to improve accuracy.
3.  **Stratification Algorithm:**
    *   Based on predicted Responsiveness Profiles, users are stratified into groups likely to be most sensitive to specific test factors.
    *   The algorithm balances group sizes to ensure statistical power.
    *   Prioritization can be applied to factors/values deemed most critical based on business objectives.
4.  **Dynamic Allocation System:**
    *   Allocates experience configurations to user groups based on stratification.  Users most likely to respond to a particular configuration are assigned to test that variation.
    *   Allows for A/B/n testing alongside factor/value testing.
5.  **Experiment Control & Monitoring:**
    *   Standard experiment controls (randomization, blinding) are maintained.
    *   Monitors group performance in real-time, adjusting allocation dynamically if necessary to address imbalances or unexpected results.
6.  **Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// User joins experiment
user_data = collect_user_data()
responsiveness_profile = predict_responsiveness(user_data)

// Determine best stratification group
best_group = find_best_group(responsiveness_profile)

// Assign user to group and allocate experience configuration
assign_user_to_group(user, best_group)
config = allocate_experience_configuration(best_group)
apply_configuration(user, config)

// Real-time monitoring and adjustment
monitor_group_performance(best_group)
if (performance deviates significantly):
    adjust_allocation(best_group)
```

7.  **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   Scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
    *   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
    *   Data pipeline for processing and storing user data.
    *   API for integration with existing application and experiment management systems.

This design aims to shift from *reactive* optimization (iteratively refining based on observed data) to *proactive* optimization (targeting the right configurations to the right users from the outset). It acknowledges that not all users will respond equally to changes and seeks to maximize the efficiency of the experimentation process.
