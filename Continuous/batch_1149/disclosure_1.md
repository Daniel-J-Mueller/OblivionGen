## Adaptive Behavioral Drift Detection & Predictive Access Control

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on *detecting* anomalous behavior based on comparison to a prior state (data in a cookie). This expands on that idea by *predicting* behavioral drift and proactively adjusting access controls *before* anomalous activity is definitively identified. It moves from reactive security to predictive security.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Behavioral Profile Engine (BPE):** This component maintains a dynamic behavioral profile for each client. Unlike simple data comparison, the BPE utilizes time-series analysis & potentially, lightweight machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Kalman Filters) to establish *expected* behavioral ranges, not just past states. Factors included:
    *   Time of day/week access patterns
    *   Geographic location (inferred from IP, if permitted)
    *   Device type & browser fingerprint
    *   Navigation paths & resource requests (frequency, sequence)
    *   Interaction timing (e.g. time between clicks, form submissions)
*   **Drift Prediction Module (DPM):** Analyzes the BPE output in real-time. Uses statistical methods (e.g. change point detection) to identify *early signs* of behavioral deviation â€“ subtle shifts in the time-series data *before* they cross a defined anomaly threshold. Crucially, it doesn't simply flag deviations, it *projects* future behavioral states based on the identified drift.
*   **Adaptive Access Control (AAC) Layer:** Responds to drift predictions. Instead of binary "allow/deny", it implements granular, dynamic access adjustments:
    *   **Step-Up Authentication:**  Triggers multi-factor authentication (MFA) if drift prediction indicates a moderate risk.
    *   **Progressive Challenge:**  Presents increasingly complex challenges (e.g., CAPTCHA, knowledge-based questions) proportional to the predicted risk.
    *   **Resource Throttling:**  Limits access to sensitive resources if drift indicates potential data exfiltration.
    *   **Session Monitoring:**  Initiates enhanced logging and session recording for further analysis.

**II. System Architecture:**

1.  **Client Request:** Client sends request (HTTPS).
2.  **Initial Data Collection:** Server collects initial client data (IP, User-Agent, cookies).
3.  **BPE Profile Creation/Update:** BPE creates/updates client's behavioral profile.  This profile is stored as a time-series database record.
4.  **Real-Time Monitoring:** With each subsequent request:
    *   Request data is fed to the BPE.
    *   BPE compares current behavior to the profile.
    *   Data is passed to DPM.
    *   DPM performs drift prediction.
5.  **AAC Response:** DPM sends a risk score to the AAC layer. The AAC layer adjusts access control based on the score.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** AAC actions (e.g., MFA completion) are fed back to the BPE to refine the profile and improve prediction accuracy.

**III. Pseudocode (DPM - Drift Prediction Module):**

```
function predict_drift(client_profile, current_behavior):
  // client_profile:  Time-series data of past behavior
  // current_behavior: Data from current request

  // 1. Calculate deviation from expected behavior
  deviation = calculate_deviation(client_profile, current_behavior)

  // 2. Apply time-series analysis (e.g., Exponential Smoothing) to detect trends
  trend = detect_trend(deviation)

  // 3. Project future behavior based on trend
  predicted_behavior = project_behavior(trend)

  // 4. Calculate risk score based on predicted deviation
  risk_score = calculate_risk_score(predicted_behavior)

  return risk_score
```

**IV. Data Storage:**

*   **Client Profiles:** Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB).
*   **Drift Predictions:**  Redis (for low-latency access).
*   **Audit Logs:**  Centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Splunk).
