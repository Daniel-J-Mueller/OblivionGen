## Secure Data Streaming with Ephemeral Key Derivation

**Concept:** A system for secure, continuous data streaming where encryption keys are derived and refreshed frequently based on a combination of stream metadata, a shared secret, and a time-based component. This minimizes the impact of key compromise and enhances forward secrecy.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Data Source:** The entity generating the data stream (e.g., sensor, camera).
*   **Stream Controller:**  Manages stream metadata, key derivation parameters, and coordination between Data Source and Data Sink.
*   **Data Sink:** The entity receiving and decrypting the data stream.
*   **Secure Channel:**  Established between Stream Controller and Data Sink for initial secret exchange and parameter negotiation.

**2. Key Derivation Process:**

*   **Initial Secret:** A shared secret (e.g., derived from Diffie-Hellman key exchange) established between Data Sink and Stream Controller *before* stream initiation.
*   **Stream Metadata:** Includes a unique stream identifier, data type, and optional quality of service (QoS) parameters.
*   **Time Component:**  A high-resolution timestamp or counter incremented at a configurable rate (e.g., every 100ms, every frame).
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):** A robust KDF (e.g., HKDF-SHA256) that takes as input:
    *   Initial Secret
    *   Stream Metadata
    *   Time Component
    *   Optional: A salt value (unique per stream)
*   **Key Renewal Rate:** Configurable frequency at which a new key is derived. A higher rate increases security but also processing overhead.

**3. Data Transmission Process:**

1.  **Stream Initialization:** Data Source and Data Sink negotiate stream parameters (renewal rate, salt) via Stream Controller.
2.  **Key Generation (Data Source):** At each renewal interval, the Data Source uses the KDF with the current time component to generate a new encryption key.
3.  **Data Encryption (Data Source):** The Data Source encrypts data segments using the newly generated key and a symmetric encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-GCM).
4.  **Key & Ciphertext Transmission (Data Source):** The Data Source transmits the encrypted data segment alongside a hash of the key used for encryption.
5.  **Key Verification & Decryption (Data Sink):** The Data Sink independently generates the encryption key using the same KDF, stream metadata, and current time component. It verifies the received key hash against its own generated hash to ensure key synchronization. If verification passes, the Data Sink decrypts the data segment.
6.  **Time Synchronization:** Critical. Network Time Protocol (NTP) or Precision Time Protocol (PTP) must be used to synchronize clocks between Data Source and Data Sink.  A tolerance for clock skew must be established.

**4.  Pseudocode (Data Source):**

```
// Initialization
shared_secret = ObtainSharedSecret()
stream_metadata = ObtainStreamMetadata()
renewal_interval = ConfigureRenewalInterval()
last_renewal_time = CurrentTime()

loop:
  current_time = CurrentTime()
  if (current_time - last_renewal_time >= renewal_interval):
    key = HKDF_SHA256(shared_secret, stream_metadata, current_time)
    key_hash = SHA256(key)
    last_renewal_time = current_time

  data_segment = ObtainData()
  encrypted_data = AES_GCM_Encrypt(data_segment, key)
  Transmit(encrypted_data, key_hash)
```

**5. Considerations:**

*   **Clock Synchronization:**  A robust clock synchronization mechanism is paramount.
*   **Key Exchange:** The initial shared secret must be established securely.
*   **Metadata Integrity:**  Protect stream metadata from tampering.
*   **Computational Overhead:**  Frequent key derivation and encryption can be computationally intensive.  Optimize the KDF and encryption algorithm.
*   **Failure Handling:** Implement mechanisms to handle clock skew, key desynchronization, and network failures.  Consider using a rolling window of time to reduce the impact of clock drift.
