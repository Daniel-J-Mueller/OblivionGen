## Dynamic Resource Shadowing & Permission Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the automated role management to proactively ‘shadow’ dynamic resource creation and propagate necessary permissions *before* code execution even requests them. This anticipates resource needs, reducing latency and potential access errors.

**Specifications:**

*   **Resource Shadowing Agent:** A background process monitoring resource provisioning APIs (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes). It intercepts resource creation requests.
*   **Permission Inference Engine:** Upon detecting a new resource, the engine analyzes its type and associated attributes to *infer* the necessary permissions a code segment might require. This uses a knowledge base of resource types and common access patterns.
*   **Preemptive Role Update:** The system automatically updates the relevant role with the inferred permissions *before* the code segment attempts to access the resource.  This occurs as a separate transaction before the code segment execution begins.
*   **Temporary Permission Grant:** Grants are time-limited, expiring after a configurable period. This ensures permissions don't linger unnecessarily, bolstering security.
*   **Execution Monitoring & Adjustment:** During code execution, a monitor observes actual resource access. If the inferred permissions were insufficient, they are dynamically adjusted (with audit logging). If the inferred permissions were overly permissive, a report is generated highlighting the discrepancy for knowledge base refinement.

**Pseudocode (Role Manager Component - Modified):**

```
function analyzeCodeSegment(codeSegment):
  //Existing analysis to determine initial permissions
  initialPermissions = determinePermissions(codeSegment)

  //New - Monitor Resource Provisioning APIs
  resourceEvents = monitorResourceProvisioning()
  
  inferredPermissions = []
  for event in resourceEvents:
      resourceType = event.resourceType
      resourceAttributes = event.attributes
      permissions = inferPermissionsFromResource(resourceType, resourceAttributes)
      inferredPermissions.append(permissions)

  //Combine initial and inferred permissions
  combinedPermissions = mergePermissions(initialPermissions, inferredPermissions)

  //Apply and store permissions to role
  configureRole(role, combinedPermissions)
  return role

function inferPermissionsFromResource(resourceType, resourceAttributes):
  //Knowledge base lookup for resource type and attributes
  permissions = knowledgeBase.lookup(resourceType, resourceAttributes)
  return permissions

function monitorResourceProvisioning():
    //Subscribe to resource provisioning APIs.
    //Return events as they are detected.
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Knowledge Base:** A structured repository (e.g., graph database) storing resource types, attributes, and associated permission templates.
*   **Resource Event:** A data object containing information about a newly provisioned resource (type, attributes, provider, etc.).

**Considerations:**

*   Scalability of the resource monitoring system.
*   Accuracy of the permission inference engine – requires a robust and regularly updated knowledge base.
*   Handling of complex resource configurations and dependencies.
*   Integration with existing identity and access management systems.
