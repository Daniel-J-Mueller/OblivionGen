## Adaptive Authentication Zones â€“ Dynamic Key Restriction

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of key-use zones but introduce *dynamic* zones determined by real-time risk assessment and device/user behavior. Instead of static restrictions, authentication keys are provisioned and revoked based on an ongoing analysis of the authentication attempt.

**Specifications:**

**1. Risk Assessment Engine:**

*   **Input Data:** Device fingerprint (hardware/software configuration), geolocation, network characteristics (IP address, ISP), time of day, user behavior (typing speed, mouse movements, common access patterns), multi-factor authentication status (if applicable), historical authentication data for the user/device.
*   **Risk Scoring:** A machine learning model assigns a risk score to each authentication attempt.  The model is continuously trained on authenticated and fraudulent attempts to improve accuracy.  The score ranges from 0 (low risk) to 100 (high risk).
*   **Dynamic Zone Assignment:** Based on the risk score, the authentication attempt is assigned to a dynamic zone:
    *   **Zone 0 (Trusted):** Risk score < 20.  Uses standard authentication keys.
    *   **Zone 1 (Moderate):** Risk score 20-60.  Requires an additional layer of key derivation, potentially incorporating a time-limited token or a device-specific challenge.
    *   **Zone 2 (High):** Risk score 60-80.  Requires a significantly different key derivation path, potentially involving a hardware security module (HSM) on the authentication server or a challenge-response mechanism with a trusted third party.
    *   **Zone 3 (Critical):** Risk score > 80. Authentication is blocked and an alert is triggered.

**2. Key Provisioning & Derivation:**

*   **Base Keys:** The initial password/credential generates a set of base keys, similar to the existing patent.
*   **Dynamic Key Derivation Functions (KDFs):**  Each dynamic zone has a corresponding KDF. These KDFs incorporate zone-specific data (e.g., a zone identifier, a random nonce, a timestamp) along with the base keys and potentially device-specific information.
*   **Key Rotation:**  Keys are rotated frequently within each zone, minimizing the impact of a potential key compromise.  Rotation frequency is adjustable based on the risk level of the zone.
*   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):**  Critical zones utilize HSMs to securely store and manage the derived keys, providing an extra layer of protection.

**3. Authentication Flow:**

1.  User attempts authentication.
2.  Risk Assessment Engine analyzes the authentication attempt and assigns a dynamic zone.
3.  The system selects the appropriate KDF for the assigned zone.
4.  The KDF derives the authentication key based on the base keys, zone-specific data, and potentially device information.
5.  The derived key is used to verify the user's credentials.
6.  If authentication is successful, access is granted.

**4. Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function derive_key(base_keys, zone_id, device_info, timestamp) {
  if (zone_id == 0) {
    // Trusted Zone - Use standard key
    derived_key = base_keys.primary_key;
  } else if (zone_id == 1) {
    // Moderate Zone - Incorporate timestamp
    salt = hash(timestamp);
    derived_key = kdf(base_keys.secondary_key, salt);
  } else if (zone_id == 2) {
    // High Zone - Incorporate device info
    salt = hash(device_info);
    derived_key = kdf(base_keys.tertiary_key, salt);
  } else {
    // Critical Zone - Block Authentication
    return null;
  }
  return derived_key;
}
```

**5. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor authentication attempts and adjust zone assignments based on emerging threats.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Use machine learning to optimize the risk assessment model and KDFs based on historical data.
*   **Granular Access Control:** Combine dynamic authentication zones with granular access control policies to further enhance security.
