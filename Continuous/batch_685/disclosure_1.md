## Dynamic Contextual GUI Skins

**Concept:** A GUI that dynamically alters its visual “skin” – not just colors or icon sets, but fundamental layout and interactive element types – based on predicted user cognitive load and task complexity.

**Specs:**

**1. Cognitive Load Sensor Integration:**
   *   **Input:** Real-time data stream from non-invasive cognitive load sensors (e.g., EEG, eye-tracking, heart rate variability).  Sensor data processed to generate a 'Cognitive Load Index' (CLI) – a normalized value between 0 (low load) and 1 (high load).
   *   **Processing:**  CLI value fed into a ‘Skin Selection Algorithm’.

**2. Skin Profiles:**
   *   **Minimalist Skin (CLI < 0.3):**  Displays only essential information.  Uses high contrast, large icons, and simplified language. Interactive elements are large and widely spaced.  Animation and transitions are minimized. Focus on direct manipulation.
   *   **Standard Skin (0.3 <= CLI < 0.7):**  Balanced information density.  Uses standard icons, clear typography, and moderate animation.  Offers a mix of direct manipulation and menu-driven interactions.
   *   **Complex Skin (CLI >= 0.7):** High information density. Supports advanced visualizations and data overlays. Offers complex interactions and a wider range of options.  Employs tooltips and contextual help extensively.  Uses subtle animations to highlight important information.
   *   **Adaptive Skin (Dynamic):** Continuously adjusts GUI elements based on real-time CLI. Can combine aspects of the above skins.

**3. Skin Selection Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function selectSkin(CLI):
  if CLI < 0.3:
    return "Minimalist"
  else if CLI < 0.7:
    return "Standard"
  else:
    return "Complex"

function applySkin(skinName):
  // Load GUI configuration for specified skin
  config = loadGUIConfig(skinName)

  // Apply configuration to GUI elements
  foreach element in GUI:
    element.applyConfig(config[element.type])

function loadGUIConfig(skinName):
  // Load configuration file (JSON or similar) for specified skin
  // Configuration contains:
  //   - Layout information (positions, sizes)
  //   - Visual properties (colors, fonts, icons)
  //   - Interaction behaviors (menu options, tooltips)
  return config
```

**4. Dynamic Element Reconfiguration:**

   *   **Element Types:** The algorithm supports switching between element types (e.g., a button can become a slider, a text label can become a chart).
   *   **Layout Adjustment:**  The GUI layout engine automatically adjusts element positions and sizes when element types change.
   *   **Interaction Mapping:**  Interaction behaviors are dynamically mapped to the new element type.

**5. Task Complexity Integration:**

   *   **API Access:** The system accesses an API that provides information about the current task’s complexity (e.g., number of steps, data volume, required precision).
   *   **Complexity Weighting:** Task complexity is weighted and combined with the CLI value to fine-tune the skin selection process.
