## Dynamic Content Stitching with Predictive Pre-Encoding

**Concept:** Expand upon the bypass functionality by introducing a system that *predictively* pre-encodes content segments based on user viewing patterns, then dynamically stitches these pre-encoded segments into the output stream, minimizing on-the-fly encoding.

**Specifications:**

**1. User Profile & Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Monitor user viewing history (content ID, duration watched, time of day, device type, network conditions) to build a profile.  Supplement with collaborative filtering – identify users with similar viewing habits.
*   **Pattern Identification:** Employ time series analysis and machine learning (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks – RNNs) to predict the next content segment a user is likely to request.  Focus on predicting *sequences* of segments, not just single requests.  Include confidence scores for predictions.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** Define a prediction horizon (e.g., 5-10 seconds) to proactively prepare content.
*   **Adaptive Horizon:** Dynamically adjust the prediction horizon based on network conditions and prediction confidence. Lower confidence = shorter horizon.

**2. Pre-Encoding Engine:**

*   **Segment Library:** Maintain a library of pre-encoded content segments at multiple bitrates.
*   **Predictive Encoding:** Based on predictions from the User Profile & Prediction Module, proactively encode segments *before* they are requested. Prioritize segments with high prediction confidence.
*   **Bitrate Selection:** Select appropriate bitrates for pre-encoding based on predicted network conditions and user device capabilities.
*   **Dynamic Prioritization:** Implement a priority queue for pre-encoding requests, weighted by prediction confidence, network conditions, and available resources.
*   **Segment Caching:** Cache pre-encoded segments locally (on edge servers or user devices) to reduce latency.

**3. Dynamic Stitching Module:**

*   **Request Interception:** Intercept incoming content requests.
*   **Segment Availability Check:** Check if the requested segment is available in the pre-encoded segment library.
*   **Seamless Stitching:**
    *   If the segment is available, serve the pre-encoded segment directly.
    *   If the segment is *not* available, fall back to standard encoding on-demand.
    *   Implement seamless stitching between pre-encoded and on-demand segments to avoid visual artifacts.  This will require precise timestamp alignment and potentially frame blending.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** Monitor encoding performance and adjust pre-encoding priorities dynamically.  If on-demand encoding is consistently required for certain segments, increase the pre-encoding priority for those segments.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Stitching Module):**

```
function serve_segment(request):
  segment_id = request.segment_id
  available_segment = get_pre_encoded_segment(segment_id)

  if available_segment:
    return available_segment
  else:
    on_demand_segment = encode_segment_on_demand(request)
    # Track on-demand encoding for priority adjustment
    track_on_demand_encoding(segment_id)
    return on_demand_segment
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance CPUs/GPUs for encoding.
*   Large-capacity, low-latency storage for segment library.
*   Fast network connectivity.
*   Edge computing infrastructure to distribute pre-encoding and segment caching closer to users.
