## Adaptive Device Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the shadow account concept to create dynamic, context-aware “personas” for smart devices, influencing device behavior based on user activity and learned preferences *without* explicit user configuration. This moves beyond simple account association to proactive device adaptation.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Core:** A module residing on a central hub (e.g., smart speaker, home automation server) responsible for managing device personas.
*   **Persona Profiles:** Data structures defining device behavior for specific contexts. These include:
    *   *Activity Triggers:* Rules based on detected user activity (e.g., "watching movie," "cooking," "sleeping"). Detected via audio, video, device usage patterns.
    *   *Parameter Adjustments:* Values for controllable device parameters (e.g., brightness, volume, temperature, fan speed).
    *   *Automation Sequences:* Predefined sequences of actions for multiple devices.
    *   *Preference Weights:* Numeric values indicating the strength of different preferences within a context.
*   **Device Integration Layer:** Adapters allowing seamless communication with diverse smart devices and access to their controllable parameters.
*   **Learning Engine:** A machine learning model trained on user interaction data to refine persona profiles over time.
*   **Context Awareness Module:** Utilizes sensor data (audio, video, motion, environmental) to infer user activity and environmental conditions.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Shadow Account:** Device is acquired, connected to network. A shadow account is created as per the base patent.
2.  **Contextual Data Collection:** The Context Awareness Module monitors user activity and environment.
3.  **Persona Assignment:** Based on detected context, a relevant persona is selected for the device. Initially, a default persona is used.
4.  **Parameter Adjustment:** The device’s parameters are adjusted based on the selected persona’s settings.
5.  **User Feedback Loop:**  User overrides (manual adjustments) are recorded and used to refine the persona profile.  The Learning Engine weights these overrides more heavily than passive observation.
6.  **Dynamic Profile Creation:** The system detects new patterns of activity and learns to construct new personas on the fly.
7.  **Cross-Device Persona Synchronization:**  Personas are not limited to single devices.  A "movie night" persona can automatically dim lights, adjust temperature, and activate a sound system.

**Pseudocode (Learning Engine):**

```
function update_persona(device_id, context, user_override) {
    // Fetch current persona profile for device_id and context
    persona = get_persona(device_id, context)

    // Calculate a weighted average of the current settings and the user override
    weight = 0.7 // Baseline weight for existing persona
    if (user_override != null) {
        weight = 0.3 //Give more weight to user override
    }
    new_settings = (persona.settings * weight) + (user_override * (1 - weight))

    // Update the persona profile
    persona.settings = new_settings
    save_persona(persona)
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Central Hub (Smart Speaker, Home Automation Server) with sufficient processing power and memory.
*   Network connectivity (Wi-Fi, Ethernet).
*   Compatible smart devices.
*   Optional: Cameras and microphones for enhanced context awareness.

**Innovation:**

This system transcends simple account association by creating dynamic, adaptive device behavior based on learned user preferences. It moves beyond reactive control to proactive personalization.  The learning engine ensures the system continually refines its understanding of user needs. It's a move towards truly 'smart' homes that anticipate and respond to user behavior without explicit instruction.
