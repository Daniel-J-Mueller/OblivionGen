## Dynamic Communication Resonance Profiling

**System Overview:**

A system for establishing individualized ‘resonance profiles’ for users, predicting optimal communication timing and method beyond simple efficacy metrics (received/not received). It moves beyond assessing *if* a message is received to understanding *how* receptive the user is at a given time, maximizing cognitive impact.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Data Ingestion:**  Collect data streams beyond communication logs. Include:
    *   **Device Sensor Data:**  Accelerometer (activity level), Microphone (ambient noise/speech detection - indicating focus/distraction), Screen On/Off cycles, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi proximity (contextual location – office, home, commuting).
    *   **Application Usage:** Track application switching, duration of use (e.g., long focus in a coding IDE vs. rapid switching between social media apps).
    *   **Calendar Integration:** Scheduled meetings, travel time, potentially even estimated cognitive load based on meeting topic (NLP analysis of meeting titles/descriptions).
    *   **Biometric Data (Optional, with explicit user consent):** Heart rate variability (HRV) via wearables, potentially even basic facial expression analysis via camera (detecting stress/engagement levels – *highly sensitive data, requires robust privacy safeguards*).

2.  **Resonance Profile Construction:** Employ a time-series analysis engine (e.g., LSTM neural network) to learn individual user patterns. The model should predict a ‘resonance score’ ranging from 0-1. 

    *   **Feature Engineering:** Combine raw data streams into meaningful features. Examples:
        *   “Focus Duration”:  Time spent in a single application without switching.
        *   “Interruption Frequency”: Number of application switches per minute.
        *   “Contextual Noise Level”: Ambient noise level detected by microphone.
        *   “Movement Intensity”:  Accelerometer data processed to indicate activity level.
        *   “Scheduled Congestion”:  Upcoming meeting density within a time window.
    *   **Model Training:** Train individual resonance profiles for each user based on their historical data. Continuous learning is crucial – the model adapts to changing user behavior.

3.  **Dynamic Communication Scheduling:**  Integrate with existing communication channels (email, messaging, push notifications).

    *   **Prediction Engine:**  Before sending a message, the system predicts the recipient’s resonance score for different sending times (e.g., every 5 minutes over the next hour).
    *   **Optimal Time Selection:**  The message is scheduled to be delivered when the predicted resonance score is maximized.
    *   **Channel Adaptation:** If resonance is low *despite* optimal timing, the system can adapt the communication channel. (e.g., switch from email to a less intrusive push notification).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each user:
UserResonanceProfile = new ResonanceProfile()
UserResonanceProfile.loadHistoricalData() // Load multi-modal data streams
UserResonanceProfile.trainModel() // Train LSTM model to predict resonance score

// When sending a message to User:
predictedResonanceScores = UserResonanceProfile.predictResonance(timeWindow = 1 hour, interval = 5 minutes)
optimalTime = findMax(predictedResonanceScores)
sendMessage(message, User, optimalTime)

// If low resonance *despite* optimal time:
if (predictedResonance < threshold) {
    switchChannel(message, User, lessIntrusiveChannel)
}
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for storing sensor data and resonance scores.
*   Relational database for storing user profiles and communication logs.

**Privacy Considerations:**

*   **Explicit User Consent:** Obtain clear and informed consent before collecting any sensor data or biometric information.
*   **Data Anonymization:** Anonymize or pseudonymize data whenever possible.
*   **Data Encryption:** Encrypt data both in transit and at rest.
*   **Data Minimization:** Collect only the data that is necessary for the system to function.
*   **User Control:** Provide users with the ability to access, modify, and delete their data.
