## Dynamic Access ‘Shadowing’ and Predictive Privilege Escalation

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Access Shadow’ – a continuously updated record of user interactions *across all connected services*, not just within the document management system. This includes email, calendar, messaging, virtual compute resource usage (CPU/RAM allocation, software licenses), storage consumption, and any other quantifiable digital activity.
*   **Data Storage:** A time-series database optimized for high-volume ingestion and complex querying of user activity data.  Data retention policies configurable per user/group/document sensitivity.
*   **Privilege Escalation Engine:** A predictive model (potentially a recurrent neural network) trained on the Access Shadow data. This model predicts *future* access needs based on observed behavioral patterns.
*   **‘Just-In-Time’ Access Grants:**  Instead of explicitly granting full access, the system *temporarily* elevates privileges *only* when the predictive model indicates a high probability of legitimate need. These grants are logged and auditable.
*   **Confidence Threshold:**  A configurable parameter controlling the stringency of the privilege escalation. Higher confidence levels reduce false positives but may increase user friction.
*   **Real-Time Feedback Loop:**  User actions *during* the temporary privilege escalation are monitored and fed back into the predictive model to refine its accuracy.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  A separate model trained to identify unusual access patterns that may indicate malicious activity.

**Innovation Description:**

The current patent focuses on access control based on *static* attributes and immediate interactions. This system introduces a dynamic, predictive layer. It doesn’t just ask "What has this user done?", but "What is this user *likely* to need next?".

Imagine an engineer working on a complex project. They frequently access documents related to ‘module X’.  Based on the Access Shadow, the system observes they’ve recently started using a new data analysis tool, and calendar entries suggest a meeting about ‘module Y’.  *Before* the engineer even requests access to module Y documentation, the system *proactively* elevates their privileges, allowing them to seamlessly continue their work.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Privilege Escalation Logic):**

```
function escalatePrivilege(user, document):
  accessShadow = getUserAccessShadow(user)
  prediction = predictAccessNeed(user, document, accessShadow) // RNN model output

  if prediction.confidence > threshold:
    grantTemporaryPrivilege(user, document, prediction.suggestedOperation) // e.g., view, annotate, modify
    logPrivilegeEscalation(user, document, prediction.suggestedOperation)
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced User Productivity:** Reduced friction and wait times for access.
*   **Improved Security:** Proactive privilege escalation can reduce the attack surface by only granting access when demonstrably needed.
*   **Automated Access Management:**  Reduced administrative overhead.
*   **Behavioral Analytics:**  The Access Shadow data provides valuable insights into user workflows and potential security threats.

**Novelty:**

This differs from the provided patent by *proactively* granting access based on predicted needs rather than reactive assessment of current interactions. The focus is not on *what* the user is doing *now*, but *what they are likely to do next*. It creates a self-learning, adaptable access control system that anticipates user needs.
