## Adaptive Item Prioritization & “Serendipity Engine”

**Concept:** Extend the item delivery system to dynamically adjust item delivery priority based on inferred user context *and* introduce a “serendipity engine” that occasionally injects unexpected but potentially relevant items into the delivery stream. This moves beyond simply fulfilling requests to proactively shaping the user’s experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Contextual Data Input:** Integrate data feeds beyond the immediate ‘to-do list’ request. Incorporate:
    *   **Time of Day:** Adjust item type (e.g., news articles in the morning, relaxing audio in the evening).
    *   **Location (Optional/User Permission):**  Deliver location-relevant items (e.g., local event information).
    *   **Calendar Integration (Optional/User Permission):**  Deliver items related to upcoming appointments/meetings.
    *   **Device Sensor Data (Optional/User Permission):**  Motion, ambient light, and audio levels can indicate user activity/mood.
*   **User Profile Module:** Maintain a dynamic user profile based on:
    *   **Explicit Preferences:** User-selected categories, tags, interests.
    *   **Implicit Preferences:** Derived from item consumption history (dwell time, completion status, ratings, shares).
*   **Priority Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm to assign priority scores to available items. Factors include:
    *   **To-Do List Request:** Highest priority.
    *   **User Profile Match:** Higher score for items aligning with user interests.
    *   **Contextual Relevance:** Adjust score based on time of day, location, calendar, etc.
    *   **Serendipity Factor:** Introduce a small, random element to allow unexpected items to surface.
*   **Serendipity Engine:**
    *   **Content Database:** Maintain a database of "serendipity items" – items outside the user’s typical consumption patterns but potentially intriguing. This could include cross-category recommendations, articles from niche blogs, or experimental content.
    *   **Injection Rate:** Control the frequency of serendipity item injection (e.g., 5% of delivered items).
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor user response to serendipity items (dwell time, completion, explicit feedback) to refine the serendipity selection algorithm.
*   **Delivery Pipeline Modification:**
    *   Before delivering an item requested via the ‘to-do list’, the priority algorithm re-evaluates the delivery queue.
    *   The algorithm may *delay* a requested item slightly to insert a higher-priority item (contextual, serendipity).
    *   Users should have a setting to disable/adjust the “serendipity” feature.
*   **Pseudocode (Priority Algorithm):**

```
function calculatePriority(item, userProfile, context, serendipityFactor) {
  priority = 0;

  // To-Do List Request - Base Priority
  if (item is requested via to-do list) {
    priority += 100;
  }

  // User Profile Match
  profileMatchScore = calculateProfileMatchScore(item, userProfile);
  priority += profileMatchScore * 20;

  // Contextual Relevance
  contextScore = calculateContextScore(item, context);
  priority += contextScore * 10;

  // Serendipity Factor
  priority += random(0, serendipityFactor);

  return priority;
}

function calculateProfileMatchScore(item, userProfile) {
  // Implement logic to compare item categories/tags to user preferences
  // Return a score between 0 and 1
}

function calculateContextScore(item, context) {
  // Implement logic to assess item relevance based on time, location, calendar, etc.
  // Return a score between 0 and 1
}
```
