## Personalized Acoustic Scene Profiles

**Concept:** Leverage the caching mechanism described in the patent to create and store personalized acoustic scene profiles. The device doesn’t just cache *what* was said, but *where* it was said, and *how* it sounded.

**Specs:**

**1. Acoustic Fingerprinting Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously analyzes ambient audio using a microphone array (minimum 3 microphones for directional analysis).
*   **Parameters Captured:**
    *   Reverberation time (RT60) – Measures room acoustics.
    *   Noise floor (dB SPL) –  Captures the average ambient noise level.
    *   Dominant frequency ranges – Identifies prominent sound sources (e.g., HVAC hum, traffic noise).
    *   Directional audio analysis – Detects the origin of sound events.
*   **Output:**  A vector representing the current acoustic fingerprint.  This vector will be timestamped and associated with the user's utterance.

**2. Profile Generation & Storage:**

*   **Trigger:** When the device processes a user utterance *and* the acoustic fingerprint module is active.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Combine the current utterance data (as cached in the patent’s system) with the corresponding acoustic fingerprint vector.
    2.  Aggregate this data over time, creating a personalized acoustic scene profile for the user. This profile will be stored in the device’s memory, indexed by location (determined via GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation).  Multiple profiles can exist for different locations.
    3.  Apply a clustering algorithm to identify common acoustic patterns associated with specific intents.

**3. Predictive Acoustic Modeling:**

*   **Function:** When the device receives a new utterance, the system performs the following:
    1.  Determine the current location of the device.
    2.  Load the corresponding acoustic scene profile.
    3.  Compare the *current* acoustic fingerprint to the profile.
    4.  Adjust the ASR/NLU processing parameters based on the comparison.  For example:
        *   **High Noise:** Increase noise suppression, adjust beamforming direction.
        *   **High Reverberation:** Apply dereverberation algorithms, emphasize transient sounds.
        *   **Detected Sound Source (e.g., TV):**  Filter out frequencies associated with the TV.

**4. Adaptive Learning:**

*   **Feedback Mechanism:**  If the user corrects the device’s interpretation of an utterance, the system updates the acoustic scene profile to reflect the discrepancy.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously refines the acoustic scene profiles based on user interactions and environmental changes.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Acoustic Modeling):**

```
function processUtterance(audioData, locationData) {
  profile = loadAcousticProfile(locationData);
  currentFingerprint = analyzeAudio(audioData);
  difference = compareFingerprints(currentFingerprint, profile);

  if (difference > threshold) {
    // Adjust ASR/NLU parameters
    if (currentFingerprint.noiseLevel > profile.noiseLevel) {
      applyNoiseSuppression();
    }
    if (currentFingerprint.reverberation > profile.reverberation) {
      applyDereverberation();
    }
  }

  // Perform ASR/NLU processing
  intentData = performNLU(audioData);

  return intentData;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved accuracy in noisy environments (e.g., cars, offices, public spaces).
*   Hands-free control in challenging acoustic conditions.
*   Personalized audio experiences tailored to the user’s environment.
*   Smart home automation based on contextual awareness.
