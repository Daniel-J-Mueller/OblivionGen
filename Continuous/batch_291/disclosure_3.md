## Adaptive Entropy Sharding

**Concept:** Extend layered encryption by dynamically adjusting the size and structure of encrypted ‘shards’ based on real-time entropy analysis of the data being encrypted *and* the available computational resources. This moves beyond fixed-size layers to a more fluid, resilient system.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Entropy Engine:** Implement a real-time entropy analysis module. This module analyzes the input data stream to determine its complexity and redundancy. Output is a dynamic 'Entropy Score' (0.0 – 1.0) representing data randomness.

2.  **Resource Monitor:**  Continuously monitor available computational resources (CPU, GPU, memory) on the target system. Output a 'Resource Availability Score' (0.0 – 1.0).

3.  **Shard Generator:** Based on Entropy Score and Resource Availability Score, dynamically generate ‘shards’ of varying sizes and complexity. 
    *   High Entropy, High Resources: Small, highly encrypted shards with complex key derivation functions.
    *   Low Entropy, Low Resources: Larger shards with simpler encryption schemes.
    *   Mixed Conditions: Hybrid approach, adjusting shard size and encryption levels accordingly.

4.  **Layered Shard Distribution:** Instead of a single layered structure, distribute shards across multiple ‘entropy layers’. Each layer represents a different level of encryption complexity and redundancy.
    *   Layer 1 (Highest Security): Smallest shards, strongest encryption, highest redundancy.
    *   Layer N (Lowest Security): Largest shards, simplest encryption, lowest redundancy.

5.  **Key Derivation Function (KDF) Cascade:** Implement a cascading KDF. Each shard is encrypted with a unique key derived from the following:
    *   The original seed (from the base patent)
    *   Shard index
    *   Entropy Score (at the time of shard creation)
    *   Resource Availability Score (at the time of shard creation)
    *   Previous shard’s key (creating a dependency chain).

6.  **Decryption Process:** Decryption reverses the process. Shards are retrieved from entropy layers and decrypted using the KDF cascade. Dependency chains must be validated to ensure shard integrity.

**Pseudocode (Encryption):**

```
function encryptData(data, seed, layers):
    entropyScore = calculateEntropy(data)
    resourceScore = monitorResources()
    shardSize = determineShardSize(entropyScore, resourceScore)
    shards = splitDataIntoShards(data, shardSize)

    for i = 0 to length(shards) - 1:
        key = deriveKey(seed, i, entropyScore, resourceScore, previousKey)
        shards[i] = encryptShard(shards[i], key)

    storeShards(shards, layers)
    return shards
```

**Pseudocode (Decryption):**

```
function decryptData(layers):
    shards = retrieveShards(layers)
    for i = 0 to length(shards) - 1:
        key = deriveKey(seed, i, entropyScore, resourceScore, previousKey)
        shards[i] = decryptShard(shards[i], key)

    recombineShards(shards)
    return data
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Dynamic shard sizes and key derivation make it harder for attackers to target specific data segments.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Adjusts encryption complexity based on available resources.
*   **Increased Resilience:** Shard distribution across entropy layers creates redundancy and makes it harder to compromise all data.
*   **Adaptive to Data Characteristics:** Handles different data types and complexities more effectively.
