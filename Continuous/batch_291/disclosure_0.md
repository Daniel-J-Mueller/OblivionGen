## Autonomous Route Anomaly Attribution

**Concept:** Expand the static route detection beyond simple identification to *attribution* â€“ pinpointing the originating source of the misconfigured routes. This builds on the premise of detecting traffic following unexpected paths, but adds a layer of forensic analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Route Origin Probe (ROP):**  Deployed on border network devices (as in the provided patent) but actively queries neighboring autonomous systems (AS) for their routing configurations *related to* the prefixes being monitored.  This is done using a secure, authenticated protocol (potentially a customized extension to BGP). Frequency: Configurable, defaults to hourly.
*   **Component 2:  Route Deviation Database (RDDB):**  Stores a history of advertised prefixes, detected static routes, and the results of ROP queries.  This is a time-series database optimized for rapid correlation.
*   **Component 3: Anomaly Attribution Engine (AAE):**  The core logic.  When a static route is detected:
    1.  Query RDDB for recent advertised prefixes for the destination.
    2.  Query RDDB for ROP responses from neighboring ASs, specifically requesting their routing policies for the problematic prefix.
    3.  Compare the expected route (from advertised prefixes) with the actual route (detected static route) and the AS-reported routes.
    4.  Employ a Bayesian network or similar probabilistic model to *score* potential originating sources of the misconfiguration. Factors considered:
        *   AS's reported route vs. expected route.
        *   AS's historical rate of misconfiguration reports.
        *   Network topology and path lengths.
        *   Time since last configuration change in the suspected AS.
    5.  Output a ranked list of suspected ASs, with confidence scores.

**Pseudocode (AAE Core):**

```pseudocode
function attribute_static_route(static_route_destination, detected_path):
  advertised_prefixes = RDDB.get_advertised_prefixes(static_route_destination)
  neighbor_routes = RDDB.get_neighbor_routes(static_route_destination)

  # Calculate deviation scores. Higher = more deviation.
  deviation_score = calculate_deviation(advertised_prefixes, detected_path)

  suspect_scores = {}
  for AS in neighbor_routes:
    AS_route = neighbor_routes[AS]
    deviation_AS = calculate_deviation(AS_route, detected_path)

    # Incorporate historical data (e.g., past misconfig reports)
    historical_score = RDDB.get_historical_misconfig_score(AS)

    suspect_score = deviation_score + historical_score + calculate_topology_penalty(AS)
    suspect_scores[AS] = suspect_score

  # Sort ASs by suspect_score (descending)
  sorted_suspects = sort_by_value(suspect_scores)

  return sorted_suspects  # List of AS tuples: (AS Number, Suspect Score)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-bandwidth network interfaces on border devices.
*   Scalable time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB).
*   Distributed computing platform (e.g., Kubernetes) for AAE.
*   Secure communication protocols (TLS, SSH) for ROP and data transmission.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Faster root cause analysis of routing issues.
*   Proactive identification of misconfigured ASs.
*   Improved network stability and resilience.
*   Automated remediation workflows (e.g., alerts, automatic route filtering).
