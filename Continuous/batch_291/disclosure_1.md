## Adaptive Sketch Dimensionality with Bloom Filter Enhancement

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the dimensionality (vector size) of the sketches based on observed data density and integrate Bloom filters to refine identity matching within the sketch join process. This addresses potential accuracy limitations when dealing with highly variable data distributions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Adaptive Dimensionality Controller:**

*   **Input:** Real-time data stream from the private datasets during sketch creation.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor data density within defined value ranges (e.g., count of identities mapped to each value in the first/second set of values).
    *   Implement a threshold-based scaling function.  If density exceeds a high threshold, increase sketch dimensionality. If density falls below a low threshold, decrease dimensionality.  The scaling should be logarithmic to avoid drastic changes.
    *   The function should return a target dimensionality value.
*   **Output:** Target sketch dimensionality value.

**2. Bloom Filter Integration:**

*   **Phase 1: Sketch Creation:**
    *   During sketch creation (mapping identities to entries using the hash function), simultaneously insert these identities into a Bloom filter.
    *   The Bloom filter's size should be proportional to the sketch dimensionality and expected false positive rate.
*   **Phase 2: Sketch Joining:**
    *   Before computing the dot product (or equivalent join operation), query the Bloom filter with identities from the second sketch.
    *   If an identity is *not* found in the Bloom filter, it can be immediately excluded from the join operation, reducing computational load.
    *   Identities *found* in the Bloom filter proceed to the standard sketch join process.

**3.  Dynamic False Positive Rate Adjustment:**

*   Monitor the rate of false positives from the Bloom filter.
*   Adjust the Bloom filter size and hashing functions dynamically to minimize false positives without significantly increasing memory usage.
*   Employ multiple hash functions within the Bloom filter to reduce collisions.

**4. Pseudocode (Sketch Joining with Bloom Filter):**

```
function joinSketches(sketch1, sketch2, bloomFilter):
    result = 0
    for identity in sketch2.identities:
        if bloomFilter.contains(identity):
            hashValue = hashFunction(identity)
            result += sketch1.vector[hashValue] * sketch2.vector[hashValue]
    return result
```

**5.  System Components:**

*   **Data Density Monitor:** Monitors data streams, calculates density metrics.
*   **Dimensionality Controller:**  Implements the scaling function.
*   **Bloom Filter Manager:**  Creates, manages, and queries Bloom filters.
*   **Sketch Generator:**  Creates sketches with adjusted dimensionality and Bloom filter integration.
*   **Join Engine:** Performs the sketch join operation.

**6. Data Structures:**

*   **Sketch:**  Vector of configurable size, storing identity mappings.
*   **Bloom Filter:** Bit array with multiple hash functions.
*   **Density Metrics:**  Data structures to store data density measurements.
