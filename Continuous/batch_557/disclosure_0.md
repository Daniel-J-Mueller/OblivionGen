## Dynamic Fragment Assembly with Per-Region Encoding Profiles

**Concept:** Expand upon the fragment-based delivery described in the patent by introducing dynamically assembled fragments where encoding profiles *within* a fragment are adjusted based on real-time content analysis and client device capabilities.  This moves beyond simply delivering different resolution layers (like the enhancement layer frames) and allows for highly granular control over compression parameters *within* a single image.

**Specification:**

**1. Content Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw digital image data (from the source image files).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Scene Detection:** Identify distinct regions or objects within the image. Utilize object recognition (AI/ML models) to categorize content (text, graphics, faces, textures, etc.).
    *   **Complexity Assessment:** Quantify the visual complexity of each region (e.g., edge density, color variation, texture richness).
    *   **Semantic Importance:** Assign a semantic weight to each region based on its content type and context.  (e.g., facial regions are high importance, background textures are low importance).
*   **Output:** A region map indicating boundaries, content type, complexity score, and semantic weight for each region within the image.

**2. Encoding Profile Generator:**

*   **Input:** Region map, Client Device Capabilities (resolution, processing power, bandwidth, supported codecs, preferred quality settings).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Profile Selection:** Based on client device capabilities, select a base encoding profile (e.g., H.264 High Profile, H.265 Main 10).
    *   **Region-Specific Adjustments:**  For each region in the region map:
        *   **Quantization Parameter (QP) Adjustment:** Lower QP for high-importance, low-complexity regions (preserves detail). Higher QP for low-importance, high-complexity regions (reduces bitrate).
        *   **Lossy/Lossless Compression:**  Apply lossless compression to regions containing text or graphics (e.g., using a lossless mode within H.264/H.265). Use lossy compression for textures and photographic elements.
        *   **Intra/Inter Prediction:**  Adjust intra/inter prediction settings based on region motion characteristics (static regions favor intra prediction, dynamic regions favor inter prediction).
        *   **Adaptive Frame Rate:** Regions exhibiting minimal change can be encoded at a lower frame rate than dynamic areas.
*   **Output:** A per-region encoding profile map specifying compression parameters for each region.

**3. Fragment Assembly Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Digital image data, Per-Region Encoding Profile Map.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Region Encoding:** Encode each region of the image using its corresponding encoding profile.
    *   **Fragment Creation:** Assemble the encoded regions into fragments. Fragments can be tailored to specific display regions of the client device.  (e.g., a fragment for the top 1/4 of the screen, a fragment for the bottom 3/4).
    *   **Metadata Insertion:** Include metadata within each fragment indicating the encoding parameters used, the region boundaries, and fragment dependencies.
*   **Output:**  A stream of fragments, each containing encoded image data and associated metadata.

**4. Client-Side Fragment Decoder & Renderer:**

*   **Input:** Fragment stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Fragment Decoding:** Decode each fragment using the encoding parameters specified in the metadata.
    *   **Fragment Reassembly:**  Reassemble the decoded fragments into a complete image.
    *   **Image Rendering:**  Render the complete image on the client deviceâ€™s display.

**Pseudocode (Fragment Assembly Engine):**

```
function assemble_fragments(image, encoding_profiles):
  fragments = []
  region_index = 0
  for region in image.regions:
    encoded_region = encode(region, encoding_profiles[region_index])
    fragment = create_fragment(encoded_region, region.boundaries)
    add_metadata(fragment, encoding_profiles[region_index], region.boundaries)
    fragments.append(fragment)
    region_index += 1
  return fragments
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Optimized Bandwidth Usage:**  Significantly reduce bandwidth requirements by tailoring compression levels to content complexity and importance.
*   **Improved Image Quality:** Preserve critical details while reducing artifacts in less important regions.
*   **Adaptive Streaming:**  Dynamically adjust encoding profiles based on network conditions and client device capabilities.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:**  Deliver a visually appealing and responsive user experience even under challenging network conditions.
