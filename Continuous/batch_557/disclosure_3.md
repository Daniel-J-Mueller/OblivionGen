## Adaptive Timer Granularity Based on Task Priority

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the resolution of virtual timers based on the priority of the requesting task.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on injecting noise into timer values to mitigate resource contention. This inspires a refinement: instead of *adding* noise, *adjust* the inherent resolution of the timer itself, tailored to the taskâ€™s importance.  High-priority tasks receive fine-grained timers, while low-priority tasks operate on coarser scales, minimizing overhead and maximizing responsiveness where it matters most.

**Components:**

*   **Priority Assignment Module:**  A mechanism (OS-level or hypervisor-level) for assigning priority levels to tasks.  Levels can range from 0 (lowest) to N (highest).
*   **Granularity Map:** A lookup table mapping priority levels to timer resolutions. Example:
    *   Priority 0:  1ms resolution
    *   Priority 1:  100us resolution
    *   Priority 2:  10us resolution
    *   Priority 3+: 1us resolution
*   **Virtual Timer Module (VTM):** Modified to incorporate the Granularity Map. Upon receiving a timer request, the VTM first retrieves the priority of the requesting task. It then consults the Granularity Map to determine the appropriate timer resolution.
*   **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):**  A layer to interface with the underlying hardware timer(s). The HAL must support setting different timer resolutions (if possible) or emulate variable resolution through software-based techniques.

**Pseudocode (VTM):**

```
function get_virtual_timer_value(requesting_task):
    task_priority = PriorityAssignmentModule.get_priority(requesting_task)
    timer_resolution = GranularityMap.get_resolution(task_priority)
    
    hardware_timer_value = HAL.read_timer()
    
    // If hardware supports variable resolution:
    HAL.set_timer_resolution(timer_resolution)
    virtual_timer_value = hardware_timer_value 
    
    // If hardware does *not* support variable resolution:
    // Emulate variable resolution by scaling/rounding the hardware timer value:
    if timer_resolution == 1ms:
        virtual_timer_value = round(hardware_timer_value / 1000) * 1000
    elif timer_resolution == 100us:
        virtual_timer_value = round(hardware_timer_value / 100000) * 100000
    //... and so on
    
    return virtual_timer_value
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Granularity Map should be configurable, allowing administrators to tune the system based on workload characteristics.
*   The system must handle potential conflicts between tasks requesting different timer resolutions. A prioritization scheme should be implemented.
*   Consider using a hybrid approach: hardware-based variable resolution for critical tasks and software emulation for less sensitive tasks.
*   Power consumption should be considered, as finer-grained timers may consume more power.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved responsiveness for high-priority tasks.
*   Reduced overhead for low-priority tasks.
*   Better overall system performance.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing workloads.
