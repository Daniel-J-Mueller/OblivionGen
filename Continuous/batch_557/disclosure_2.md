**Secure Data ‘Chameleon’ – Adaptive Manifest & Device Identity**

**Concept:** Extend the core authentication process to dynamically alter the data *presented* on the storage device based on the validating entity – essentially, a data ‘chameleon’. This isn't about encryption, but about presenting different, yet valid, data sets depending on *who* is verifying the device.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Multi-Manifest Support:** The storage device will store multiple manifests, each associated with a unique 'verifier profile' (e.g., department, project, individual).  Each manifest details a specific data subset and associated validation keys.

2.  **Dynamic Data Partitioning:**  The storage device is logically partitioned. Each partition contains a different version of the data, tailored to a specific verifier profile.  

3.  **Verifier Profile Exchange:**  Prior to device connection, a secure channel establishes a verifier profile exchange. The receiving entity (transfer station) transmits its profile.

4.  **Manifest Selection & Validation:** The storage device, upon receiving the verifier profile, selects the corresponding manifest. It validates the received profile against the manifest’s authorized list. If validation succeeds, it uses the associated keys to unlock the relevant data partition.  If not, access is denied.

5.  **Data Presentation Layer:** A lightweight OS on the device manages the data partitions and presents the correct subset to the transfer station.  This layer is agnostic to the underlying data format.

6.  **Metadata ‘Fingerprinting’:**  Each partition has a metadata ‘fingerprint’ derived from its data and the manifest.  This fingerprint is checked during data transfer to verify data integrity *and* that the correct partition is being accessed.

7.  **Tamper Detection:** A hardware-based random number generator (RNG) seeds the metadata fingerprint. Any alteration to the data or manifest will invalidate the fingerprint, triggering a tamper alert.

**Pseudocode (Storage Device Firmware):**

```
FUNCTION handleConnection(verifierProfile):
    manifest = selectManifest(verifierProfile)
    IF manifest == NULL:
        denyAccess()
        RETURN

    IF verifyProfile(verifierProfile, manifest) == FALSE:
        denyAccess()
        RETURN

    dataPartition = getPartition(manifest)
    IF dataPartition == NULL:
        denyAccess()
        RETURN

    IF verifyDataIntegrity(dataPartition, manifest) == FALSE:
        denyAccess()
        RETURN

    presentData(dataPartition) // Deliver the authorized data subset

FUNCTION verifyDataIntegrity(partition, manifest):
    calculatedFingerprint = calculateMetadataFingerprint(partition)
    manifestFingerprint = readManifestFingerprint(manifest)

    IF calculatedFingerprint == manifestFingerprint:
        RETURN TRUE
    ELSE:
        RETURN FALSE
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Secure Element: Needed to store encryption keys and the RNG seed.
*   High-Speed Interface: Necessary for transferring data partitions quickly.
*   Tamper-Resistant Enclosure: To protect the secure element and RNG.
