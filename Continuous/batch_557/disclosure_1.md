## Dynamic Query Decomposition & Parallel Execution Across Heterogeneous Databases

**Concept:** Extend the query routing/rewriting capability to *decompose* complex queries into smaller, independent subqueries, then execute these subqueries in parallel across a *variety* of database types (SQL, NoSQL, graph databases, etc.), leveraging the strengths of each. The results are then reassembled to satisfy the original query.

**Specs:**

**1. Query Decomposition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Original user query (SQL, or a higher-level query language).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Dependency Graph Creation:** Analyze the query to identify independent clauses/subqueries. Build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent subqueries and edges represent dependencies (e.g., a subquery whose result is used as input to another).
    *   **Cost Estimation:** For each subquery, estimate execution cost on available database types.  Factors include data size, data distribution, indexing capabilities, and database-specific optimizations.  Use historical performance data and/or query profiling.
    *   **Subquery Assignment:** Assign each subquery to the “best” database type based on cost estimation.  Prioritize databases that natively support the subquery’s operations (e.g., graph database for graph traversals, document database for JSON processing).
    *   **Transformation:** Transform each subquery into the native query language of its assigned database.
*   **Output:** A set of transformed subqueries, each associated with its target database, and the dependency graph.

**2. Parallel Execution Manager:**

*   **Input:** Transformed subqueries, dependency graph, target databases.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Allocate resources (connections, threads, memory) on each target database.
    *   **Parallel Execution:** Execute the subqueries in parallel, respecting dependencies in the DAG. Use a task queue to manage execution.
    *   **Result Collection:** Collect results from each database.
    *   **Result Assembly:** Assemble the collected results to satisfy the original query. This may involve joining data from multiple sources, applying transformations, and aggregating results.
*   **Output:** Final result set.

**3. Metadata Catalog:**

*   **Database Profiles:** Store profiles for each available database, including capabilities, limitations, performance characteristics, and connection details.
*   **Data Mapping:** Maintain mappings between data elements and their locations across different databases.  This allows the system to identify which database contains the data needed for each subquery.
*   **Query Templates:** Store pre-optimized query templates for common operations on each database type.

**Pseudocode (Query Decomposition Engine):**

```
function decompose_query(query):
  dependency_graph = build_dependency_graph(query)
  for each node in dependency_graph:
    subquery = node.subquery
    best_database = select_best_database(subquery, available_databases)
    transformed_query = transform_query(subquery, best_database.query_language)
    node.assigned_database = best_database
    node.transformed_query = transformed_query
  return dependency_graph
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Performance Optimization:** Leveraging the strengths of different databases can significantly improve query performance.
*   **Scalability:** Distributing the workload across multiple databases can improve scalability.
*   **Flexibility:** The system can adapt to changing data volumes and query patterns.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Using the most cost-effective database for each operation can reduce overall costs.
