## Dynamic Contextual Auto-Replies – “LifeMode”

**Concept:** Extend auto-reply functionality beyond scheduled appointments to reflect a user’s *current activity* and dynamically adjust messaging based on detected context. This isn’t simply “out of office,” but a granular “LifeMode” system.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Access to device sensors (GPS, accelerometer, microphone) and potentially connected home/vehicle data.
*   **Activity Recognition:** AI-driven activity detection (driving, exercising, in a meeting, sleeping, actively engaged in a task – determined via sensor fusion).
*   **LifeMode Profiles:** User-definable profiles linking activities to auto-reply behaviors. (e.g., "Driving" – auto-reply with “I’m currently driving and will respond when I’m safely stopped.”; “Focused Work” – auto-reply with “I’m in deep work mode and will respond at the end of the hour.”)
*   **Contextual Reply Templates:**  Templates for each LifeMode, editable by the user.  Templates include variable insertion (e.g., “Expected return to inbox: [ETA from GPS]”).
*   **Priority Contact Exceptions:**  User-defined contact lists override LifeMode settings (urgent contacts *always* get a prompt response, even while driving).
*   **"Do Not Disturb" Integration:**  Seamless integration with existing DND settings – LifeMode can be a higher granularity layer on top.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  AI learns user response patterns to refine LifeMode suggestions and auto-reply content. (e.g., suggesting a more detailed reply for specific contacts.)
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Explicit user control over data shared for LifeMode functionality. Clear indicators showing when LifeMode is active and what data is being used.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
While (Device is ON) {
  Activity = DetectActivity(SensorData);
  LifeMode = GetLifeModeForActivity(Activity, UserPreferences);

  If (IncomingMessage) {
    PriorityContacts = GetPriorityContacts(UserPreferences);
    If (IsPriorityContact(IncomingMessage.Sender, PriorityContacts)) {
      DeliverMessageImmediately();
    } Else {
      If (LifeMode.IsActive) {
        AutoReply = GenerateAutoReply(LifeMode, IncomingMessage);
        SendAutoReply(AutoReply, IncomingMessage.Sender);
      } Else {
        DeliverMessage();
      }
    }
  }
}

// Function: GenerateAutoReply
Function GenerateAutoReply(LifeMode, IncomingMessage) {
  //Selects template based on LifeMode
  Template = LifeMode.Template;

  //Populates template variables (ETA, etc.)
  PopulateVariables(Template, LifeMode.Data);

  Return Template;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Dependencies:**

*   Modern smartphone/tablet with robust sensor suite.
*   Cloud-based AI engine for activity recognition and learning.
*   Secure data storage for user preferences and learned patterns.
*   Integration with existing email/messaging platforms.
