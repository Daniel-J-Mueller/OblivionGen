**Adaptive Swarm Health Monitoring & Predictive Relocation**

**Concept:** Extend the UAV’s prognostics beyond individual vehicle health to encompass a swarm-level health assessment, triggering *proactive relocation* of failing units *before* critical failure impacts mission success, and utilizing neighboring UAVs for redundant sensing & data validation. This moves from *predictive maintenance* to *predictive swarm adaptation*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Swarm Communication Protocol:**
    *   Frequency: Dedicated short-range data link (900 MHz or similar) optimized for low latency and high reliability within swarm range (e.g., 500m - 2km, scalable).
    *   Data Packets: Standardized format including: UAV ID, subsystem health status (failure probability, remaining useful life – RUL), sensor data summary, location (GPS), energy level, and request flags (e.g., ‘request assistance’, ‘report anomaly’).
    *   Topology: Dynamic mesh network. Each UAV maintains connections with 3-7 neighbors.
    *   Protocol: A lightweight, UDP-based protocol with optional acknowledgement for critical data.

2.  **Distributed Health Modeling:**
    *   Each UAV runs a local instance of the predictive models (as per the base patent).
    *   In addition, each UAV maintains a limited 'neighbor health model' - a probabilistic representation of the health of its immediate neighbors, derived from received data.
    *   Neighbor health models are updated continuously.
    *   Kalman filtering used to fuse local sensor data with neighbor reports, improving overall health estimation accuracy.

3.  **Failure Prediction & Risk Assessment:**
    *   Health models predict subsystem RUL for both the local UAV *and* its neighbors.
    *   A ‘Swarm Risk Score’ is calculated based on the combined RUL of all UAVs, weighted by their criticality to the mission. (e.g., a UAV performing a key data relay function has a higher weight).
    *   A threshold is set for the Swarm Risk Score.

4.  **Proactive Relocation Algorithm:**
    *   When the Swarm Risk Score exceeds the threshold, the algorithm triggers relocation of failing units.
    *   Relocation criteria:
        *   Identify UAVs with the lowest RUL and highest criticality.
        *   Determine suitable replacement UAVs within the swarm (sufficient energy, proximity, appropriate subsystems).
        *   Dynamically re-assign tasks from failing units to replacement units.
        *   Generate a relocation path (avoiding obstacles, optimizing energy consumption).
        *   Coordinate the handoff of tasks and data between UAVs.
    *   Relocation execution:
        *   Failing UAV transitions to a standby mode.
        *   Replacement UAV assumes the failing unit’s responsibilities.
        *   Failing UAV returns to a designated charging/maintenance station (if within range) or performs a controlled landing.

5.  **Redundant Sensing & Data Validation:**
    *   UAVs share raw sensor data with neighbors (compressed & prioritized based on relevance).
    *   Cross-validation of sensor readings: Each UAV compares its sensor data with that of its neighbors.
    *   Anomaly detection: Significant discrepancies trigger alerts and potentially recalibration of sensors.
    *   Sensor Fusion: Implement a distributed sensor fusion algorithm to combine data from multiple UAVs, improving accuracy and reliability.

6.  **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Increased onboard processing power (for sensor fusion, communication, and relocation planning).
    *   Enhanced communication range and bandwidth.
    *   Redundant power systems.
    *   Advanced navigation sensors (for precise positioning and obstacle avoidance).

**Pseudocode (Relocation Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION RelocateUnits(swarmRiskScore, swarm)

    IF swarmRiskScore > threshold THEN

        //Identify failing units
        failingUnits = SELECT units FROM swarm WHERE RUL < threshold2

        //Identify replacement units
        replacementUnits = SELECT units FROM swarm WHERE RUL > threshold3 AND proximity(failingUnit) < range

        //Assign tasks
        FOR EACH failingUnit IN failingUnits DO
            replacementUnit = SELECT bestReplacement(replacementUnits, failingUnit)
            reassignTasks(failingUnit, replacementUnit)
        END FOR

        //Generate relocation paths
        FOR EACH failingUnit IN failingUnits DO
            path = generateRelocationPath(failingUnit, baseStation)
            transmitPath(failingUnit, path)
        END FOR

        //Execute relocation
        FOR EACH failingUnit IN failingUnits DO
            executeRelocation(failingUnit, path)
        END FOR

    END IF

END FUNCTION

This system aims to move beyond simply predicting individual failures to actively managing swarm health, improving mission resilience and extending operational lifespan. It relies on real-time data sharing, distributed processing, and proactive adaptation.
