## Adaptive Workspace Illumination

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each viewer device (laptop, tablet, phone) must possess an ambient light sensor.
    *   Each viewer device must have controllable RGB backlighting, or a similar color-adjustable lighting system.
    *   A central network server (or distributed cloud service) capable of processing sensor data and issuing lighting control commands.
*   **Software:**
    *   Client application running on each viewer device.  This application:
        *   Reads ambient light sensor data.
        *   Reports sensor data and device ID to the central server.
        *   Receives lighting control commands from the central server.
        *   Adjusts device backlighting accordingly.
    *   Server application:
        *   Receives sensor data from all connected viewer devices.
        *   Calculates an aggregate "workspace mood" based on the average (or weighted average) of all ambient light readings.  Weighting could prioritize devices closer to a designated "primary" viewer.
        *   Maps the workspace mood to a color palette.  For example:
            *   Low average light = Blue/Purple (calming, focus)
            *   Medium average light = Green/Yellow (energizing)
            *   High average light = Orange/Red (urgent, collaborative)
        *   Issues lighting control commands to each viewer device, setting the backlighting to a color derived from the workspace mood palette.
        *   Allows manual override of the workspace mood by a designated "administrator" user.

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the concept of visual device differentiation to *environmental* differentiation. Instead of merely assigning colors to devices, it creates a coordinated lighting environment across the workspace. This leverages ambient light sensing to dynamically adjust the backlighting of each device, creating a unified "mood" or atmosphere. 

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function processSensorData(device_id, ambient_light_reading):
    sensor_data[device_id] = ambient_light_reading

    # Calculate average light level
    total_light = sum(sensor_data.values())
    average_light = total_light / len(sensor_data)

    # Map light level to a color
    if average_light < 30:
        workspace_color = "blue"
    elif average_light < 60:
        workspace_color = "green"
    else:
        workspace_color = "orange"

    # Send color command to all devices
    for device_id in sensor_data:
        sendLightingCommand(device_id, workspace_color)

function sendLightingCommand(device_id, color):
    # (Network communication to send lighting command to device)
    print(f"Sending color {color} to device {device_id}")
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Moods:** Allow users to define their preferred color palettes for specific tasks or moods.
*   **Content-Aware Lighting:**  Dynamically adjust lighting based on the content being displayed.  (e.g. Red for alerts, Blue for document review).
*   **Biometric Integration:** Incorporate biometric data (e.g. heart rate, eye tracking) to personalize the lighting environment even further.
*   **Spatial Awareness:**  Use device location data to create localized lighting zones.
