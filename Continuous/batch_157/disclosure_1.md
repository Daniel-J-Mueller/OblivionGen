## Adaptive DNS Prefetching with Predictive User Movement

**Concept:** Enhance DNS resolution speed and user experience by proactively prefetching DNS records based on predicted user movement patterns and application usage. This builds on the existing multi-address selection by adding a temporal and spatial dimension to prefetching.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Prediction Module:**

*   **Location Tracking (Opt-In):** When user grants permission, track approximate location via IP address or more precise methods (GPS â€“ device dependent). Frequency adjustable to balance accuracy vs. battery life.
*   **Movement Pattern Analysis:**  Utilize historical location data to identify common travel routes, frequently visited locations (home, work, gym, etc.), and travel speed.  Employ Kalman filters or Hidden Markov Models for movement prediction.
*   **Application Usage Monitoring:** Track application launch times and network activity.  Identify applications frequently used in specific locations or during certain times.
*   **DNS Request History:** Maintain a local cache of DNS requests along with timestamps and associated location/application data.

**2. Prefetching Engine:**

*   **Prediction Horizon:** Define a time window for prefetching (e.g., 5-30 minutes).
*   **Probability Scoring:** Assign a probability score to each potential DNS request based on:
    *   **Movement Prediction:** Probability of user being in a location requiring the DNS record.
    *   **Application Usage:** Probability of application launching.
    *   **Historical Data:** Frequency of previous requests.
*   **Prefetch Queue:** Maintain a prioritized queue of DNS requests based on probability scores.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Adjust prediction models and queue priorities based on real-time user behavior.
*   **Address Selection Integration:** Integrate with the existing multi-address selection logic to choose the optimal address for the prefetch.
*   **Thresholding:** Configure a threshold to limit the number of prefetch requests to avoid overwhelming the network.

**3. DNS Resolver Integration:**

*   **Intercept Prefetch Requests:**  The DNS resolver should identify and prioritize prefetch requests.
*   **Cache Optimization:** Ensure prefetched records are stored in a dedicated, fast-access cache.
*   **Time-to-Live (TTL) Management:**  Dynamically adjust TTLs for prefetched records based on user movement and application usage patterns. If the user deviates significantly from the predicted path, invalidate the prefetch.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function predict_dns_requests(user_location, app_usage, historical_data):
  potential_requests = []

  # Predict based on location
  for location in frequent_locations:
    if user_near(user_location, location):
      potential_requests.extend(dns_requests_at_location(location))

  # Predict based on app usage
  for app in running_apps:
    potential_requests.extend(dns_requests_for_app(app))

  #Combine and score
  scored_requests = score_requests(potential_requests, user_location, app_usage, historical_data)

  # Sort by score
  sorted_requests = sort_requests(scored_requests)

  return sorted_requests[:prefetch_limit] #Return top N requests

function score_requests(requests, user_location, app_usage, historical_data):
  for request in requests:
    score = 0
    score += location_probability(request, user_location) * location_weight
    score += app_usage_probability(request, app_usage) * app_weight
    score += historical_frequency(request, historical_data) * history_weight
    request.score = score
  return requests
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Client-side agent for data collection and prediction (requires user consent).
*   Backend server for data processing and model training.
*   Integration with existing DNS infrastructure.
*   Privacy controls to protect user data.
*   Low-power operation for mobile devices.
