## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Echo Mapping

**Concept:** Extend sound source localization beyond pinpointing sources to reconstructing a dynamic, localized acoustic ‘map’ of the environment, including echoes and reverberations, visualized as a time-evolving 3D point cloud. This moves beyond just *where* sounds originate to *how* sound propagates and interacts with surfaces, providing richer contextual information.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Utilize a dense array of miniature microphones (MEMS-based) distributed across a device (e.g., integrated into a mobile phone, robot, or dedicated room sensor). Minimum 64 microphones, optimally 256+ distributed non-uniformly to maximize spatial coverage and capture complex reflections.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuous, synchronized audio recording from all microphones at a sample rate of at least 96kHz. Data streamed to a processing unit (dedicated hardware accelerator or cloud-based server).
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   **Beamforming:** Apply advanced beamforming techniques (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, MVDR) to enhance signal-to-noise ratio and steer microphones towards potential sound sources.
    *   **Reflection Candidate Identification:** Employ the core correlation methodology of the provided patent, but *extend* it to identify not just direct sources, but *all* correlated signals arriving with a measurable time delay.  Crucially, utilize a higher correlation threshold to reduce false positives.
*   **Temporal Echo Mapping Algorithm:**
    1.  **Time-Delay Estimation:**  For each microphone pair, precisely estimate the Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) for correlated signals. Employ advanced TDoA estimation techniques robust to noise and multipath.
    2.  **3D Localization:** Use TDoA values from multiple microphone triplets to triangulate the 3D position of each sound source *and* each detected reflection.  Implement a robust outlier rejection mechanism to handle inaccurate TDoA estimates.
    3.  **Acoustic Material Classification (Optional):**  Analyze the frequency content and amplitude decay of detected reflections to infer the acoustic properties of the reflecting surface (e.g., hard, soft, absorbent). This could be achieved through machine learning models trained on a database of known material responses.
    4.  **Dynamic Point Cloud Generation:** Generate a dynamic 3D point cloud representing the acoustic scene. Each point in the cloud represents a sound source or reflection, with point color/size encoding attributes such as signal intensity, frequency, and estimated material properties.
    5.  **Temporal Smoothing and Tracking:** Implement a Kalman filter or particle filter to track the movement of sound sources and reflections over time, providing a smooth and coherent representation of the acoustic scene.
*   **Data Output:**
    *   **Real-time visualization:** Display the dynamic 3D point cloud on a graphical user interface.
    *   **Acoustic scene data:** Output the point cloud data in a standard format (e.g., point cloud library – PCL) for further analysis or integration with other applications.
    *   **Event Triggering:** Define custom events based on acoustic scene changes (e.g., detection of a sound reflection from a specific location).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialize microphone array and data acquisition
micArray = initializeMicrophoneArray()
dataStream = startDataStream(micArray)

while (true) {
  audioData = receiveAudioData(dataStream)
  correlatedSignals = identifyCorrelatedSignals(audioData) // Using patent’s core methodology + extension for all correlations

  for each (signal in correlatedSignals) {
    if (signal is directSource) {
      location = triangulateLocation(signal)
      addPointToPointCloud(location, signal.intensity, signal.frequency)
    } else {
      location = triangulateLocation(signal)
      addPointToPointCloud(location, signal.intensity, signal.frequency, signal.reflectionType)
    }
  }
  updatePointCloud()
  displayPointCloud()
}
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond static source localization to create a *dynamic* acoustic representation of the environment.  Existing localization systems typically focus solely on identifying *where* sounds originate, whereas this system aims to capture *how* sound propagates and interacts with surfaces, providing a richer understanding of the acoustic environment.  The inclusion of reflection type analysis and temporal tracking further enhances the system's capabilities. This is a foundational step to creating "acoustic maps" which could be used for immersive VR experiences, augmented reality, or environmental monitoring.
