## Dynamic Resource Composition via Predictive Labeling

**Specification:** A system for proactively composing API resources based on predicted user needs, leveraging a historical interaction model and dynamically generated labels.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of relying solely on explicit queries and pre-defined labels, this system predicts the likely next resource a user will need based on their current session and historical behavior, and *pre-fetches* and *pre-labels* that resource. This reduces latency and enables richer, more contextual API experiences.

**Components:**

1.  **Interaction History Database:** Stores user session data including requested resources, sequential access patterns, time spent on each resource, and any user-provided feedback (e.g., "helpful," "not relevant").

2.  **Predictive Model (PM):** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) trained on the Interaction History Database. Input: Current session data (resource sequence, time stamps). Output: Probability distribution over potential next resources.  The PM also predicts 'need-types' (e.g. 'data visualization', 'authentication', 'error handling').

3.  **Dynamic Label Generator (DLG):** Takes the predicted next resource and predicted 'need-type' as input. Generates temporary labels based on:
    *   **Content Analysis:** Scans the resource’s data structure for inherent properties (data types, field names, schema).
    *   **Need-Type Mapping:** Maps the ‘need-type’ to relevant labels (e.g., 'data visualization' -> ‘chart-compatible’, ‘table-data’).
    *   **Contextual Labels:** Based on current session – location, user role, time of day.

4.  **Pre-Fetch and Labeling Service:**  Responsible for pre-fetching the predicted resource and applying the dynamically generated labels. Stores these pre-labeled resources in a fast-access cache (e.g., Redis).

5.  **API Gateway Enhancement:** Modified API Gateway to prioritize serving pre-labeled resources from the cache when a request matches.  If a pre-labeled resource is not available, the gateway falls back to the normal API resource access flow.

**Pseudocode (API Gateway Logic):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  resourceId = request.resourceId
  
  cachedResource = cache.get(resourceId)
  
  if cachedResource != null:
    # Serve from cache
    return cachedResource
  else:
    # Normal API access flow
    resource = api.getResource(resourceId)

    # Predict next resource and pre-label (asynchronously)
    predictNextResource(request) 
    
    return resource

function predictNextResource(request):
  sessionId = request.sessionId
  resourceSequence = getResourceSequence(sessionId) 

  predictedResourceId = PM.predictNextResource(resourceSequence)
  
  if predictedResourceId != null:
    predictedResource = api.getResource(predictedResourceId)
    needType = PM.predictNeedType(resourceSequence)
    labels = DLG.generateLabels(predictedResource, needType)
    cache.put(predictedResourceId, predictedResource, labels)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Resource Metadata:**  `{ resourceId, dataSchema, contentTypes }`
*   **Cache Entry:** `{ resourceId, resourceData, labels }`
*   **Session Data:** `{ sessionId, resourceSequence, timestamps }`

**Novelty:**  The core difference from the original patent is a proactive approach. This system *anticipates* user needs and prepares resources in advance.  Instead of simply labeling existing resources based on links and content, it's creating a dynamic, predictive labeling system. It moves beyond simple categorization to contextual prediction, potentially creating an entirely new paradigm for API interactions.
