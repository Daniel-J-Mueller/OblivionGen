## Adaptive Log Shaping for Predictive Failure Analysis

**System Overview:** A proactive system for analyzing data replication group logs, shifting from reactive event streaming to predictive failure modeling. This builds *on* the event stream concept of the provided patent, but pivots towards anticipating issues *before* they manifest as events.

**Core Innovation:** Dynamic log shaping based on observed system state and predictive models. Instead of simply streaming all logs (even redundant or irrelevant ones), the system intelligently *transforms* the log data *before* it is streamed, creating specialized ‘views’ of the logs tailored for specific analysis tasks.

**Specifications:**

1.  **State Observer Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors key metrics from the data replication group nodes (CPU utilization, memory pressure, network latency, disk I/O, consensus protocol state, etc.).
    *   Employs a time-series database (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB) to store and analyze these metrics.
    *   Defines “health bands” for each metric – ranges indicating normal, warning, and critical states.

2.  **Predictive Model Training Pipeline:**
    *   Uses historical log data *and* state observer data to train machine learning models (e.g., LSTM networks, anomaly detection algorithms).
    *   Models predict the probability of specific failure modes (e.g., node crash, network partition, data corruption).
    *   The training process is automated and continuously retrained as new data becomes available.
    *   Models are versioned and A/B tested to optimize performance.

3.  **Log Shaping Engine:**
    *   The core of the innovation. This engine intercepts log data *before* it is streamed.
    *   Based on the output of the predictive models and the current system state, it dynamically transforms the logs.
    *   **Transformation Types:**
        *   **Log Filtering:**  Suppresses logs that are unlikely to be relevant to the current risk profile. (e.g. if the predictive model shows no risk of data corruption, filter logs related to checksum validation).
        *   **Log Aggregation:** Combines multiple related log entries into a single, higher-level event. (e.g., a series of slow read requests are aggregated into a single “read latency spike” event).
        *   **Log Enrichment:** Adds contextual information to log entries. (e.g., adding the predicted failure probability to each log entry).
        *   **Feature Extraction:** Extracts specific features from the logs and converts them into numerical data for use by machine learning algorithms. (e.g., the number of failed consensus attempts in a given time window).
    *   Transformation rules are defined using a declarative language (e.g., YAML) allowing for easy modification and customization.

4.  **Adaptive Event Stream:**
    *   The shaped logs are streamed to a downstream event processing system (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar).
    *   The event stream can be dynamically adjusted based on the current risk profile. (e.g., increasing the stream rate during periods of high risk).

**Pseudocode (Log Shaping Engine):**

```
function shape_log(log_entry, system_state, predictive_model):
  risk_profile = predictive_model.predict(system_state)

  if risk_profile.data_corruption_risk > threshold:
    enriched_log = add_checksum_validation_details(log_entry)
    return enriched_log

  if risk_profile.network_partition_risk > threshold:
    aggregated_log = aggregate_network_latency_events(log_entry)
    return aggregated_log

  if log_entry.type == "health_check":
    return None  # Drop health checks during normal operation

  return log_entry # Return the original log entry if no shaping is needed
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `SystemState`:  A data structure containing key system metrics (CPU, memory, network, consensus state).
*   `RiskProfile`: A data structure containing the probability of different failure modes.
*   `ShapingRule`:  A data structure defining how logs should be transformed based on system state and risk profile.
