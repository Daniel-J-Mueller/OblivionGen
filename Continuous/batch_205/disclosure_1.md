## Acoustic Holography for Dynamic Beamforming Calibration

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Concept:** Integrate a high-resolution acoustic holography system with the existing directional testing apparatus to create a dynamic, 3D map of the acoustic environment *during* testing. This will allow for precise calibration of beamforming algorithms and compensation for reflections and environmental noise.

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   **Holographic Sensor Array:** A dense array of miniature, calibrated microphones (minimum 64, ideally 256+) arranged on a hemispherical or spherical shell. This array will capture the complete wavefront of the test sound and ambient noise.
    *   **High-Speed Data Acquisition System:** Capable of simultaneously sampling all microphones in the array at a rate exceeding 100 kHz with at least 24-bit resolution.
    *   **Precision Positioning System:**  Integration with the existing linear and rotary actuators.  This ensures precise synchronization between the acoustic holography data acquisition and the physical positioning of the sound source and audio device.  Sub-millimeter accuracy required.
    *   **Real-Time Processing Unit:** A powerful GPU-accelerated computer capable of performing real-time acoustic holography reconstruction and beamforming calculations.
    *   **Environmental Control (Optional):**  An anechoic chamber or sound isolation enclosure to minimize external noise and reflections, maximizing the accuracy of the holographic reconstruction.

*   **Software & Algorithm Specifications:**
    *   **Acoustic Holography Reconstruction Algorithm:** Implement a Delay-and-Sum beamforming or MUSIC (Multiple Signal Classification) algorithm to reconstruct the 3D sound field from the microphone array data.  Adaptive filtering to suppress noise and reflections.
    *   **Dynamic Calibration Routine:** The system will perform the following steps at each actuator position:
        1.  Capture holographic data of the test sound emitted by the source.
        2.  Reconstruct the 3D sound field.
        3.  Identify and characterize reflections and ambient noise sources.
        4.  Calibrate the beamforming algorithm of the audio device based on the reconstructed sound field. This includes adjusting the weighting coefficients of the microphones to maximize signal-to-noise ratio and minimize distortion.
        5.  Record the calibrated beamforming coefficients along with the actuator position.
    *   **Data Visualization Tools:** Develop a 3D visualization interface to display the reconstructed sound field, identified reflections, and calibrated beamforming coefficients.
    *   **Automated Analysis:**  Implement algorithms to automatically analyze the calibration data and identify potential issues with the audio device or test setup.
    *   **Beamforming Algorithm Interface:** Design a flexible interface that allows integration with various beamforming algorithms.

*   **Operational Procedure:**

    1.  Place the audio device on the rotary actuator and position the sound source using the linear actuators.
    2.  Initiate the automated calibration routine.
    3.  The system will capture holographic data and calibrate the beamforming algorithm at each actuator position.
    4.  The calibrated beamforming coefficients will be recorded along with the actuator position.
    5.  Repeat the process for all desired actuator positions.
