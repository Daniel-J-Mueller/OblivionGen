## Dynamic Event-Specific Credential Chaining

**Concept:** Extend the event-specific credential generation to support chained credential requests, allowing a single triggering event to initiate a sequence of actions requiring progressively refined access permissions.

**Specification:**

1.  **Chained Policy Templates:**  Introduce a mechanism for defining chained policy templates. These templates aren't single policies but lists of policies. Each policy within the chain defines access for a specific stage of a workflow triggered by the initial event. 

    *   Template structure: `[{policy_id: "A", variables: […], next_stage: "B"}, {policy_id: "B", variables: […], next_stage: null}]` -  `next_stage` indicates the policy ID to request a credential for *after* the current stage is complete. `null` signifies the end of the chain.

2.  **Workflow Engine Integration:**  A workflow engine receives the initial event and retrieves the corresponding chained policy template.

3.  **Sequential Credential Generation:** 

    ```pseudocode
    function process_event(event_data):
      chained_template = get_chained_template(event_data.event_type)
      current_policy = chained_template[0]
      
      while current_policy != null:
        event_specific_policy = fill_variables(current_policy.variables, event_data)
        event_specific_credential = token_service.generate_credential(base_credential, event_specific_policy)
        
        # Execute action requiring the current credential
        action_result = execute_action(event_data, event_specific_credential)
        
        # Update event_data with action_result for next stage
        event_data.update(action_result)
        
        # Move to next policy in the chain
        current_policy = chained_template[current_policy.next_stage]

      return success
    ```

4.  **Dynamic Variable Propagation:**  The `event_data` object acts as a conduit for information between stages.  Variables derived from the results of one action (and included in the credential for that stage) can be used to populate variables in subsequent policies. This enables conditional access control based on intermediate results.

5. **Credential Expiration Synchronization:** Each chained credential will follow a defined expiration window, but the *entire* chain of credentials should expire as a single unit. This prevents a partially completed chain from creating security vulnerabilities.

6.  **Auditing:** Maintain a detailed audit trail of the entire chain, including the initial event, each credential generated, the actions performed using each credential, and the results of those actions.

**Example Use Case:**

A customer uploads a file.

*   **Stage 1 (Initial Upload):** Credential grants access to a temporary storage bucket.
*   **Stage 2 (Virus Scan):** After successful upload, the virus scan service uses the result to request a credential granting access to the virus scan database.
*   **Stage 3 (Data Transformation):** Based on the virus scan result, a data transformation service receives a credential permitting access to a data transformation pipeline.
*   **Stage 4 (Long-Term Storage):** Finally, a credential grants access to long-term storage with appropriate permissions based on data classification determined during transformation.
