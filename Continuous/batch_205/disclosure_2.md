**Personalized Search Experience with Dynamic Attribute Weighting**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** A system that dynamically adjusts the weighting of search attributes (both original item attributes *and* user-suggested attributes) based on real-time user interaction and implicit feedback signals. This goes beyond simply *including* user suggestions; it actively *learns* which suggestions are most valuable for *each individual user*.

**II. Components:**

*   **User Profile Module:** Stores user preferences, search history, explicit ratings (if provided), and implicit feedback data.
*   **Attribute Weighting Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., a reinforcement learning agent or a neural network) responsible for dynamically adjusting the weight of each attribute for a given user.  Initial weights are based on item attributes, then tuned.
*   **Search Index:**  Maintains the item data, including original attributes, user-suggested attributes, and the associated weights for each user.
*   **Interaction Tracking Module:** Captures user interactions such as:
    *   **Click-through rate (CTR):**  Which search results the user clicks on.
    *   **Dwell time:** How long the user spends on a particular result page.
    *   **Scroll depth:** How far down the results page the user scrolls.
    *   **"Helpful" feedback:** Users explicitly marking a suggestion as helpful.
    *   **"Not Helpful" feedback:**  Users marking a suggestion as unhelpful.
    *   **Purchase history:** If purchases are made after a search, this indicates relevant attributes.
*   **Suggestion Filtering & Trust Module:** A module to evaluate user-submitted suggestions based on source trust (user reputation) and content analysis (to detect prohibited content or low-quality suggestions).

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Search:** A user submits a search query.
2.  **Attribute Retrieval:** The system retrieves item data from the search index, including original attributes and user-suggested attributes.
3.  **Weight Application:** The Attribute Weighting Engine applies personalized weights to each attribute for the current user, based on their profile and historical interactions.
4.  **Ranking & Display:** The search results are ranked based on the weighted attributes and displayed to the user.
5.  **Interaction Tracking:** The Interaction Tracking Module captures the user's interactions with the search results.
6.  **Weight Adjustment:** The Attribute Weighting Engine uses the interaction data to adjust the attribute weights for the user, refining the personalization over time.

**IV. Pseudocode (Attribute Weighting Engine - Simplified):**

```
function calculate_weighted_score(item, user) {
  score = 0
  for each attribute in item.attributes {
    weight = get_attribute_weight(attribute, user)
    score += attribute.value * weight
  }
  return score
}

function get_attribute_weight(attribute, user) {
  // Initial weight based on attribute type (e.g., official attribute vs. user suggestion)
  weight = base_weight

  // Adjust weight based on user history
  if (user.clicked_on_items_with_attribute(attribute)) {
    weight += positive_adjustment
  }
  if (user.ignored_items_with_attribute(attribute)) {
    weight -= negative_adjustment
  }

  // Apply a trust factor for user-suggested attributes
  if (attribute.source == "user") {
    weight *= user_trust_factor(attribute.suggested_by)
  }

  // Apply smoothing to prevent drastic weight changes
  weight = smoothing_factor * weight + (1 - smoothing_factor) * previous_weight

  return weight
}
```

**V. Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simply *including* user-suggested attributes. It actively learns which attributes are *most valuable* for each individual user, creating a truly personalized search experience. The dynamic weighting ensures that the system adapts to the user's evolving preferences and provides increasingly relevant results over time.
