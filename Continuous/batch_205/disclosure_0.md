**Adaptive Frame Resonance System**

**Concept:** Exploit and actively control resonant frequencies within the multirotor frame to enhance yaw control and dampen unwanted vibrations. This moves beyond simple twisting and introduces a dynamic, tuned response.

**Specs:**

*   **Frame Material:** Carbon fiber composite with embedded piezoelectric actuators and sensors distributed across the front and rear frame sections. Piezoelectric material selection based on maximizing strain sensitivity and actuation force.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Six-axis inertial measurement unit (IMU) per frame section (front & rear) â€“ high bandwidth, low noise. Strain gauges integrated with piezoelectric sensors. Microphone array for acoustic resonance detection.
*   **Actuation System:** Piezoelectric actuators arranged in opposing pairs on each frame section. Each pair governs a specific resonant mode. Dedicated, fast-response amplifiers for each actuator.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Real-time FFT analysis of IMU and strain gauge data to identify dominant frame resonant frequencies.
    *   Acoustic resonance detection to confirm and refine frequency identification.
    *   Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm.
        *   State Variables: Frame section angles, angular velocities, piezoelectric actuator voltages.
        *   Cost Function: Minimize yaw error, minimize vibration amplitude, minimize actuator effort.
        *   Constraints: Actuator voltage limits, physical limits of frame section rotation.
    *   Yaw command integration: MPC adjusts actuator outputs to achieve desired yaw rate while simultaneously damping vibrations and maintaining stability.
*   **Power System:** Dedicated, high-current battery for piezoelectric actuators. Power management system to optimize efficiency and prevent overheating.
*   **Communication:** CAN bus for communication between flight controller, IMUs, strain gauges, and piezoelectric actuator drivers.

**Pseudocode (simplified MPC loop):**

```
loop:
  read IMU data (front & rear)
  read strain gauge data
  calculate frame resonant frequencies (FFT)
  calculate current frame state (angles, velocities)
  receive yaw command
  predict future frame state (based on current state and control inputs)
  calculate cost function (yaw error, vibration amplitude, actuator effort)
  optimize control inputs (piezoelectric actuator voltages) to minimize cost function
  apply optimized control inputs to piezoelectric actuators
  repeat
```

**Operational Details:**

1.  **Resonance Mapping:** During initial flight, the system automatically maps the frame's resonant frequencies.
2.  **Active Damping:** The piezoelectric actuators continuously counteract unwanted vibrations by generating opposing forces at the resonant frequencies.
3.  **Yaw Control:** When a yaw command is received, the MPC algorithm coordinates actuation of the piezoelectric actuators to induce a controlled twist between the front and rear frame sections. This creates a yaw moment while maintaining stability and minimizing vibrations.
4.  **Adaptive Tuning:** The MPC algorithm continuously adapts the control parameters based on flight conditions and pilot input to optimize performance.
