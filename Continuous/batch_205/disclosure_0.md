## Dynamic Conversation Contextualization via Multi-Modal Sentiment & Intent Mapping

**Concept:** Expand message grouping beyond sender affiliation to include real-time contextual understanding of *what* is being discussed within the group, allowing for dynamically adjusting conversation views and automated actions.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Modules:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input Processor:**
    *   Input: Text messages, audio (speech-to-text), image/video (object/scene recognition, facial expression analysis).
    *   Process: Integrates data streams, timestamps each element, performs preliminary cleaning/normalization.
*   **Sentiment & Intent Engine:**
    *   Model:  Hybrid approach – pre-trained large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on conversational data, combined with rule-based systems for specific intent detection (e.g., task assignment, meeting scheduling).
    *   Output: Sentiment score (positive, negative, neutral, mixed) for each message element.  Intent classification (question, statement, command, request, acknowledgement, etc.).  Confidence score for each classification.
*   **Context Vector Generator:**
    *   Process: Combines sentiment scores, intent classifications, and identified entities (people, places, things) into a dynamic context vector representing the current state of the conversation.  Uses a weighted averaging scheme – recent messages receive higher weight.  Keeps a rolling history of context vectors to track conversation evolution.
*   **Conversation View Manager:**
    *   Function: Dynamically adjusts the conversation view based on the current context vector.  Possible adjustments:
        *   **Priority Sorting:** Messages with negative sentiment or urgent intent are highlighted or moved to the top.
        *   **Topic Clustering:** Messages are grouped by topic (identified through entity extraction and semantic similarity).
        *   **Action Item Extraction:** Automatically identifies and lists action items based on intent and entity analysis.
        *   **Visual Emphasis:**  Displays relevant images/videos alongside messages based on content analysis.
*   **Automated Action Trigger:**
    *   Function: Executes pre-defined actions based on specific context vector patterns. Examples:
        *   **Escalation:**  If negative sentiment exceeds a threshold, notify a supervisor.
        *   **Scheduling:** If a meeting request is detected, prompt the user to confirm details.
        *   **Information Retrieval:**  Automatically search for relevant information based on keywords and entities.

**II. Data Structures:**

*   **Message Element:**
    *   `message_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `sender_id`: Sender’s identifier.
    *   `timestamp`: Message creation time.
    *   `content`: Message text/audio/image/video data.
    *   `sentiment_score`: Numerical value representing sentiment.
    *   `intent_classification`: String indicating identified intent.
    *   `entities`: List of identified entities (people, places, things).
*   **Context Vector:**
    *   `timestamp`:  Time corresponding to the vector.
    *   `average_sentiment`: Average sentiment score for messages within the time window.
    *   `dominant_intent`: Most frequent intent classification.
    *   `entity_frequency`: Counts of each identified entity.
    *   `vector_hash`: Unique identifier for the vector, allowing for caching and comparison.

**III. Pseudocode (Context Vector Generation):**

```pseudocode
function generateContextVector(messageList, timeWindow):
  contextVector = new ContextVector()
  contextVector.timestamp = currentTime
  totalSentiment = 0
  intentCounts = {}
  entityCounts = {}

  for message in messageList:
    if message.timestamp >= currentTime - timeWindow:
      totalSentiment += message.sentiment_score
      if message.intent_classification in intentCounts:
        intentCounts[message.intent_classification] += 1
      else:
        intentCounts[message.intent_classification] = 1

      for entity in message.entities:
        if entity in entityCounts:
          entityCounts[entity] += 1
        else:
          entityCounts[entity] = 1

  contextVector.average_sentiment = totalSentiment / len(messageList)
  contextVector.dominant_intent = findKeyWithMaxValue(intentCounts)
  contextVector.entity_frequency = entityCounts
  contextVector.vector_hash = hash(contextVector) # For caching/comparison

  return contextVector
```

**IV.  Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **User Profile Integration:** Incorporate user preferences and communication styles into context vector calculations.
*   **Proactive Assistance:**  Based on context, suggest relevant actions or provide helpful information.
*   **Cross-Platform Integration:** Extend functionality to other communication platforms (email, video conferencing).
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Implement robust privacy controls to protect user data and ensure responsible AI use.
