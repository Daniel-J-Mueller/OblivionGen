## Dynamic Application Resilience Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the anti-pattern detection system to include *resilience* scoring.  Instead of simply identifying problems, proactively assess how well an application can *recover* from failures. This builds on the existing application profile data gathering.

**Specification:**

**1. Resilience Profile Data Collection:**

*   Augment the existing application profile data collection to include:
    *   **Dependency Mapping:** Detailed graph of all external service/library dependencies (beyond just detection, *versioning* is critical).
    *   **Redundancy Configuration:**  Information on load balancing, replication, and failover mechanisms.  (e.g., number of instances, geographic distribution, failover policies)
    *   **Circuit Breaker Implementation:** Presence and configuration of circuit breakers for external service calls.
    *   **Timeout Configuration:** Timeouts configured for all external service calls and critical internal operations.
    *   **Retry Policies:**  Retry mechanisms and their parameters (backoff, max attempts).
    *   **Data Backup/Restore Procedures:** Details on backup frequency, retention, and restore testing. (This might require integration with existing infrastructure monitoring tools).
    *   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Configuration of monitoring systems and alerting thresholds for key metrics (latency, error rates, resource utilization).
*   Data collection method: Integrate with existing application performance monitoring (APM) tools and infrastructure monitoring tools. Automated discovery of configuration settings.

**2. Resilience Scoring Engine:**

*   Develop a scoring engine that evaluates the collected resilience profile data.
*   Scoring Criteria:
    *   **Dependency Risk:** High score if critical dependencies have single points of failure, lack redundancy, or are poorly monitored.
    *   **Failover Effectiveness:** Score based on the speed and reliability of failover mechanisms (measured through simulated failures - see testing section).
    *   **Circuit Breaker Health:**  Score based on the proper configuration and effectiveness of circuit breakers.
    *   **Timeout Appropriateness:** Score based on whether timeouts are appropriate for the expected latency of external services.
    *   **Retry Policy Effectiveness:** Score based on the appropriateness of retry policies for different types of failures.
    *   **Data Recovery Capability:** Score based on the frequency of backups, retention period, and success rate of restore tests.
    *   **Monitoring Coverage:** Score based on the completeness of monitoring coverage for key metrics.
*   Scoring Algorithm: Weighted sum of the individual scores. Weights can be adjusted based on the application’s criticality and risk tolerance. Output a single ‘Resilience Score’ (e.g., 0-100).

**3. Dynamic Assessment & Recommendations:**

*   Integrate the Resilience Score into the existing modernization assessment report.
*   Provide specific recommendations for improving the Resilience Score:
    *   Add redundancy to critical dependencies.
    *   Implement circuit breakers.
    *   Configure appropriate timeouts and retry policies.
    *   Improve monitoring coverage.
    *   Automate backup and restore procedures.
*   Prioritize recommendations based on their potential impact on the Resilience Score.

**4. Automated Resilience Testing:**

*   Develop a suite of automated tests to validate the Resilience Score.
*   Tests should simulate various failure scenarios:
    *   Dependency failures (network outages, service crashes).
    *   Resource exhaustion (CPU, memory, disk).
    *   Network latency and packet loss.
*   Measure key metrics during failure scenarios:
    *   Recovery time.
    *   Error rate.
    *   Throughput.
*   Use the test results to refine the Resilience Score and identify areas for improvement.

**Pseudocode (Resilience Scoring Engine):**

```
function calculateResilienceScore(applicationProfileData):
  dependencyRiskScore = calculateDependencyRisk(applicationProfileData)
  failoverEffectivenessScore = calculateFailoverEffectiveness(applicationProfileData)
  circuitBreakerHealthScore = calculateCircuitBreakerHealth(applicationProfileData)
  timeoutAppropriatenessScore = calculateTimeoutAppropriateness(applicationProfileData)
  retryPolicyEffectivenessScore = calculateRetryPolicyEffectiveness(applicationProfileData)
  dataRecoveryCapabilityScore = calculateDataRecoveryCapability(applicationProfileData)
  monitoringCoverageScore = calculateMonitoringCoverage(applicationProfileData)

  // Define weights (adjust as needed)
  dependencyWeight = 0.25
  failoverWeight = 0.20
  circuitBreakerWeight = 0.15
  timeoutWeight = 0.10
  retryWeight = 0.10
  dataWeight = 0.10
  monitoringWeight = 0.10

  resilienceScore = (dependencyWeight * dependencyRiskScore) +
                    (failoverWeight * failoverEffectivenessScore) +
                    (circuitBreakerWeight * circuitBreakerHealthScore) +
                    (timeoutWeight * timeoutAppropriatenessScore) +
                    (retryWeight * retryPolicyEffectivenessScore) +
                    (dataWeight * dataRecoveryCapabilityScore) +
                    (monitoringWeight * monitoringCoverageScore)

  return resilienceScore
