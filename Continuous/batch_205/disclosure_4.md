## Modular Sensory Substitution System

**Concept:** Expand the testing paradigm beyond simply *measuring* device outputs, to actively *substituting* sensory input to the device under test, and observing the device’s reaction. This facilitates testing of edge cases, robustness, and potentially even AI/ML model behavior within the device.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** A central processing unit (CPU) with high-bandwidth communication interfaces (USB4, Thunderbolt). This is the ‘brain’ of the system.
*   **Sensory Input Modules (interchangeable/modular):**
    *   **Visual Input Module:** High-resolution, high-framerate camera array capable of projecting arbitrary images/videos onto a projection screen, or directly onto the Device Under Test (DUT) if possible. Includes polarization control.
    *   **Auditory Input Module:** Array of high-fidelity speakers and microphones capable of generating complex soundscapes and analyzing responses. Supports directional audio.
    *   **Haptic Input Module:** Array of micro-actuators (vibrators, small pressure pads) to simulate tactile sensations on a surface the DUT might interact with.
    *   **Environmental Input Module:** Controls for temperature, humidity, airflow, and light intensity, impacting the DUT's environment.
    *   **Electromagnetic Input Module:**  Generates controlled electromagnetic fields (within safe limits) to test shielding and interference resilience.  Includes both broad spectrum and targeted frequencies.
*   **DUT Interface:**
    *   Universal mounting platform with adjustable height, rotation, and tilt.  Accommodates a wide variety of DUT sizes and shapes.
    *   Breakout box with customizable connectors for power, data, and signal access to the DUT.
    *   Force/torque sensors integrated into the mounting platform to measure DUT response to stimuli.
*   **Control Software:**
    *   Graphical User Interface (GUI) for configuring and controlling the system.
    *   Scripting engine (Python preferred) for automating test sequences.
    *   Real-time data acquisition and analysis tools.
    *   API for integration with existing test automation frameworks.
    *   AI-assisted test sequence generation: Software suggests sensory input sequences based on DUT type and desired test objectives.
*   **Synchronization Module:** Precise timing and synchronization between all modules (visual, auditory, haptic, environmental) ensuring accurate stimulus presentation and response measurement. Hardware-based time stamping is required.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```python
# Define DUT type and test objective
dut_type = "Smartphone"
test_objective = "Camera performance in low light"

# Load pre-defined test sequence or create custom sequence
test_sequence = load_test_sequence(dut_type, test_objective)

# Initialize all modules
initialize_modules()

# For each step in the test sequence
for step in test_sequence:
    # Configure sensory input modules
    configure_visual_module(step["visual_stimulus"])
    configure_auditory_module(step["auditory_stimulus"])
    configure_haptic_module(step["haptic_stimulus"])
    configure_environmental_module(step["environmental_conditions"])

    # Present stimulus to DUT
    present_stimulus()

    # Acquire data from DUT
    data = acquire_data()

    # Analyze data
    results = analyze_data(data)

    # Store results
    store_results(results)
```

**Novelty:**

Existing test setups primarily *measure* device outputs in response to defined inputs. This system actively *substitutes* sensory input, creating a closed-loop testing environment.  This allows for testing of complex scenarios, edge cases, and the overall robustness of the DUT’s sensory processing capabilities.  The modular design allows for easy expansion and customization, accommodating a wide range of DUTs and test scenarios.  The AI-assisted test sequence generation adds a layer of automation and intelligence, enabling more efficient and comprehensive testing.
