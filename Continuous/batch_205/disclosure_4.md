**Automated Environmental Mapping with Acoustic Triangulation & Dynamic Reference Points**

**Concept:** Expand upon precise coordinate determination within a space by integrating acoustic triangulation alongside the laser-based methods. Introduce the concept of *dynamic reference points* – small, mobile robotic units that self-position and contribute to the coordinate system, mitigating the need for fixed landmarks and enhancing adaptability.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Sensor Network:**
    *   Deploy a network of low-latency, high-accuracy microphones strategically within the room.
    *   Each microphone unit is networked and synchronized via a dedicated wireless protocol.
    *   Microphone units have known, fixed positions initially determined through laser measurement as in the parent patent.

2.  **Dynamic Reference Units (DRUs):**
    *   Small, mobile robotic units (approx. 10cm diameter, 5cm height).
    *   Each DRU equipped with:
        *   High-frequency ultrasonic emitter/receiver.
        *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer, gyroscope.
        *   Low-power processor for onboard calculations.
        *   Wireless communication module.
        *   Small wheel/track system for mobility.
        *   A retroreflective marker visible to laser scanner (for initial calibration).
    *   DRUs operate autonomously, navigating pre-defined paths or responding to commands.

3.  **Coordinate Determination Process:**

    *   **Initialization:** Laser scanner establishes initial coordinate system, defining room corners and calibrating the positions of fixed microphone units & DRUs (using retroreflective marker).
    *   **DRU Self-Positioning:** DRUs constantly emit ultrasonic pulses. Microphone network receives these pulses. Time-of-flight calculations determine the DRU’s position in 3D space. IMU data filters noise & improves accuracy.
    *   **Item/Reference Point Mapping:** Laser scanner & DRU network work in tandem:
        *   Laser scanner takes initial measurements to room corners, DRUs and the object.
        *   DRUs move to new locations, providing additional viewpoints. They measure distances to the object using their own ultrasonic sensors.
        *   Combined data (laser & ultrasonic) is fed into a Kalman filter for a robust, multi-sensor fusion.
    *   **Coordinate Calculation:**  The Kalman filter minimizes the following function:

        `Minimize: ∑ (||laser_measurement - calculated_measurement||² + ||ultrasonic_measurement - calculated_measurement||²) + regularization_term`

        *   `laser_measurement`: Measurements from the laser scanner (distances to corners, DRUs, item)
        *   `ultrasonic_measurement`: Measurements from DRUs (distances to item)
        *   `calculated_measurement`: Predicted measurements based on the estimated coordinates of the item, DRUs, and room corners.
        *   `regularization_term`: Penalty term to prevent over-fitting and enforce smoothness.

4.  **Software Architecture:**

    *   **Central Processing Unit:**  Dedicated server/computer handles data fusion, coordinate calculation, and DRU control.
    *   **DRU Control Module:**  Manages DRU paths, communication, and data acquisition.
    *   **Kalman Filter Implementation:**  Robust Kalman filter implementation for multi-sensor fusion.
    *   **API:**  Open API for integrating with other systems.

5.  **Pseudocode (Coordinate Calculation):**

    ```pseudocode
    // Initialization
    Initialize room corners (C) using laser scanner
    Initialize DRU positions (D) using laser scanner
    Initialize object position (O) to a random value

    // Main Loop
    While not converged:
        // Update DRU positions based on ultrasonic triangulation
        D = UltrasonicTriangulation(microphone_readings)

        // Calculate predicted measurements
        predicted_laser_measurements = CalculateLaserMeasurements(C, D, O)
        predicted_ultrasonic_measurements = CalculateUltrasonicMeasurements(D, O)

        // Calculate error
        error_laser = actual_laser_measurements - predicted_laser_measurements
        error_ultrasonic = actual_ultrasonic_measurements - predicted_ultrasonic_measurements

        // Calculate gradient
        gradient = CalculateGradient(error_laser, error_ultrasonic)

        // Update object position
        O = O + learning_rate * gradient

        // Check for convergence
        If norm(gradient) < threshold:
            Break

    Return O
    ```

6.  **Power Management:**
    *   DRUs powered by rechargeable batteries.
    *   Wireless charging stations strategically placed within the room.
