## Adaptive Frame Categorization & Predictive Power Cycling

**Concept:** The patent details power management transitions focusing on sequence numbers and awake/sleep states. This inspires a system that *predicts* network traffic based on frame categorization, allowing for more granular and aggressive power cycling, potentially minimizing latency when waking.

**Specification:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Frame Categorization Module:** Dedicated hardware block (FPGA/ASIC) for real-time packet classification. Supports custom categorization rules.
*   **Traffic Prediction Engine:** Small neural network (optimized for low power) running on a dedicated core or the main processor.
*   **Power Control Unit:** Hardware interface to control power to network interface card (NIC) components.
*   **Memory:**  Small buffer for storing traffic prediction data.

**2. Software/Firmware Components:**

*   **Frame Categorization Rules Engine:** Allows administrators to define frame categories based on various criteria (e.g., QoS markings, port numbers, application signatures, payload analysis â€“ limited scope for power efficiency).
*   **Traffic Prediction Model Trainer:**  Software tool to train the Traffic Prediction Engine using historical network traffic data.
*   **Adaptive Power Cycling Algorithm:** Core logic to manage power states based on predicted traffic.

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Frame Categorization:** Each incoming/outgoing frame is classified by the Frame Categorization Module. Categories include (but aren't limited to):
    *   **High Priority:** Real-time applications (VoIP, video conferencing).
    *   **Medium Priority:** Interactive applications (web browsing, email).
    *   **Low Priority:** Background applications (file transfers, software updates).
    *   **Silent Period:** No data transmission detected.
2.  **Traffic Prediction:** The Traffic Prediction Engine analyzes the stream of categorized frames. It predicts the probability of upcoming frames in each category within a defined time window (e.g., 100ms).
3.  **Adaptive Power Cycling:** Based on the prediction, the Adaptive Power Cycling Algorithm determines the optimal power state for the NIC.
    *   **High Probability of High/Medium Priority:** NIC remains fully powered on.
    *   **High Probability of Low Priority:** NIC enters a low-power state (e.g., partial power down of radio components).
    *   **High Probability of Silent Period:** NIC enters a deep sleep state.
4.  **Wake-up Optimization:** When the Traffic Prediction Engine anticipates an incoming frame:
    *   **Pre-Wake-up:** The NIC is gradually powered up *before* the expected frame arrival, minimizing wake-up latency.
    *   **Prioritization:** Incoming frames are prioritized based on their category, ensuring that high-priority traffic is processed immediately.

**4. Pseudocode (Adaptive Power Cycling Algorithm):**

```
// Variables:
//   predictedProbabilities: Array of probabilities for each frame category.
//   powerState: Current power state of the NIC (ON, LOW_POWER, SLEEP).
//   wakeUpLatency: Estimated time to fully power up the NIC.
//   threshold_high, threshold_low: Probability thresholds for triggering state changes.

function adaptPowerState() {
  if (predictedProbabilities[HIGH] > threshold_high) {
    if (powerState != ON) {
      powerState = ON;
      // Initiate pre-wake-up sequence if needed
    }
  } else if (predictedProbabilities[LOW] > threshold_low) {
    if (powerState != LOW_POWER) {
      powerState = LOW_POWER;
    }
  } else {
    if (powerState != SLEEP) {
      powerState = SLEEP;
    }
  }
}

// Called periodically to update the power state
// adaptPowerState();
```

**5. Enhancement - Dynamic Thresholds:**

The `threshold_high` and `threshold_low` values can be dynamically adjusted based on real-time network conditions (e.g., packet error rate, latency) and user preferences.  This would allow the system to adapt to changing network environments and provide a better user experience.
