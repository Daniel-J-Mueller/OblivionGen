## Adaptive Snapshot Granularity via Predictive Access Patterns

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically adjusting snapshot granularity based on predicted data access patterns. The existing patent focuses on consistent snapshots across the entire filesystem. This expands on that by introducing per-file, or even per-block, snapshotting determined by machine learning.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** A machine learning module that monitors file system access patterns. It tracks reads, writes, modification times, and access frequency for each file and block.
*   **Prediction Engine (PE):**  Utilizes the data from the APA to predict future access patterns.  The PE employs time-series forecasting models (e.g., LSTM networks, Prophet) to anticipate which files/blocks are likely to change or be accessed in the near future.
*   **Granularity Controller (GC):**  Based on the PE's predictions, the GC determines the appropriate snapshot granularity.  It can select from:
    *   **Full Snapshot:** As in the original patent – entire filesystem.
    *   **File-Level Snapshot:** Snapshot only files predicted to change.
    *   **Block-Level Snapshot:** Snapshot only blocks within files predicted to change.
    *   **Delta Snapshot:**  Only snapshots blocks that have changed since the last snapshot.
*   **Snapshot Scheduler:** Manages the timing and execution of snapshots based on GC’s decisions, utilizing a priority queue that weighs prediction confidence against snapshot overhead.
*   **Metadata Store:** Stores access pattern data, prediction models, and snapshot configurations.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Monitoring:** The APA continuously monitors file system access.
2.  **Prediction:** The PE analyzes the access data and predicts future changes.
3.  **Granularity Decision:** The GC determines the optimal snapshot granularity for the next snapshot cycle based on PE's predictions and system load.
4.  **Snapshot Execution:** The Snapshot Scheduler triggers the snapshot process.  The system implements the chosen granularity. For block-level snapshots, a bitmap indicates which blocks are included.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** Snapshot performance data (time, resources) is fed back into the ML model for refinement of prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Controller):**

```
function determine_granularity(predicted_changes, system_load) {

  if (predicted_changes.size() < threshold_small && system_load > threshold_high) {
    return GRANULARITY.FULL; // Full snapshot if minimal changes and high load
  } else if (predicted_changes.size() > threshold_large) {
    return GRANULARITY.BLOCK; // Block-level if many predicted changes
  } else {
    // Intermediate case - file-level or block
    confidence = predicted_changes.confidence_score();
    if (confidence > threshold_confidence) {
      return GRANULARITY.BLOCK;
    } else {
      return GRANULARITY.FILE;
    }
  }
}

// Data Structures
enum GRANULARITY { FULL, FILE, BLOCK };
class PredictedChanges {
  size();  // Returns the number of predicted changes
  confidence_score(); // Returns a confidence score for the predictions
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The ML models require initial training with representative data.
*   The choice of ML algorithms (LSTM, Prophet, etc.) will depend on the specific workload.
*   The threshold values (threshold\_small, threshold\_large, threshold\_confidence) need to be tuned for optimal performance.
*   A distributed snapshot mechanism might be required to handle very large filesystems.
*   Consider using a tiered storage system to optimize snapshot storage costs.
