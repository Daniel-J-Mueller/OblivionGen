## Adaptive Network 'Shadowing' with Predictive Failure Migration

**Concept:** Extend the failure location detection system with a predictive 'shadowing' capability. Instead of solely *reacting* to detected failures, proactively create 'shadow' paths mirroring critical traffic flows. These shadow paths utilize different network infrastructure (nodes/links) and are continuously monitored. If the primary path begins to degrade (as detected by the existing system), traffic is *migrated* to the shadow path *before* a complete failure occurs, minimizing disruption. This leverages the existing performance data collection but introduces a dynamic, proactive element.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Path Creation Module:**
    *   Input: Network topology map, current traffic flow data (source/destination pairs, bandwidth usage), performance data from existing system (packet transfer rates, loss, latency, jitter).
    *   Process:
        1.  Identify critical traffic flows (e.g., high bandwidth, real-time applications).
        2.  For each critical flow, algorithmically determine alternative paths through the network, avoiding shared nodes/links with the primary path where feasible. Employ a cost function that considers path length, bandwidth capacity, and current load.
        3.  Create ‘shadow’ paths. These aren’t necessarily active initially.
        4.  Assign a unique identifier to each shadow path.
*   **Performance Monitoring Expansion:**
    *   Existing performance monitoring infrastructure is extended to *also* monitor shadow paths, even when inactive. Minimal ‘heartbeat’ traffic is sent through shadow paths to gauge basic connectivity and latency.
    *   Performance data from shadow paths is stored alongside data from active paths.
    *   Establish baseline performance metrics for each shadow path.
*   **Predictive Failure Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Historical and real-time performance data for both active and shadow paths.
    *   Process:
        1.  Utilize a time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to predict future performance of the active path.
        2.  Compare predicted performance of the active path against the baseline performance of available shadow paths.
        3.  Define a ‘migration threshold’ – a predicted performance degradation level that triggers traffic migration. The threshold should be configurable based on the criticality of the traffic flow.
        4.  Implement hysteresis to prevent frequent oscillation between paths.
*   **Traffic Migration Module:**
    *   Input: Trigger signal from Predictive Failure Algorithm, source/destination information for traffic to migrate.
    *   Process:
        1.  Initiate traffic redirection from the active path to the selected shadow path. This may involve updating routing tables, modifying firewall rules, or signaling network devices.
        2.  Monitor the migration process to ensure smooth transition and verify connectivity.
        3.  Log the migration event and associated performance data.
*   **Self-Healing & Adaptation:**
    *   Continuously monitor the performance of both active and shadow paths after migration.
    *   If a shadow path experiences issues, revert to the original active path or identify a new shadow path.
    *   Dynamically adjust migration thresholds and shadow path selection algorithms based on historical performance data and network conditions.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Migration Trigger):**

```
function triggerMigration(activePath, shadowPaths) {
  predictedActivePerformance = predictPerformance(activePath);
  bestShadowPath = findBestShadowPath(shadowPaths);
  bestShadowPerformance = getPerformance(bestShadowPath);

  if (predictedActivePerformance < bestShadowPerformance - migrationThreshold) {
    migrateTraffic(activePath, bestShadowPath);
    logMigration(activePath, bestShadowPath);
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Machine learning models to predict failure points proactively based on network patterns.
*   Integration with Software Defined Networking (SDN) controllers for automated path management.
*   Adaptive migration thresholds based on application-specific requirements.
