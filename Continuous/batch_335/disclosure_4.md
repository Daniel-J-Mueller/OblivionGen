## Dynamic Layer Prioritization for E-Paper Displays

**Concept:** Expand upon the update area determination by introducing dynamic layer prioritization. Instead of simply unioning update areas, assign priority levels to layers (windows) and adjust update frequency/method based on these priorities. This minimizes perceived latency for critical information while conserving power.

**Specs:**

*   **Layer Priority System:** Implement a system where each window/layer is assigned a priority level (High, Medium, Low, Background). Priority is determined by application/system designation or user configuration.
*   **Update Frequency Modulation:** 
    *   High Priority Layers: Updates are triggered immediately upon change, utilizing the fastest available refresh method (potentially partial screen refresh or even a 'pulse' of specific pixels).
    *   Medium Priority Layers: Updates are batched and applied during standard update cycles, potentially with reduced refresh intensity (grayscale instead of full color).
    *   Low Priority Layers: Updates are delayed and consolidated with background refreshes, potentially using lower resolutions or grayscale.
    *   Background Layers: Updated only during full-screen refreshes or at very low frequency.
*   **Perceptual Weighting:** Assign 'perceptual weights' to different areas of the screen. Areas frequently viewed by the user (e.g., status bar) receive higher update priority.
*   **Adaptive Refresh Rate:** Dynamically adjust the overall refresh rate based on detected user activity. If the device is idle, reduce refresh rate significantly.
*   **Predictive Buffering:** Implement a predictive buffering system. For frequently changing elements (e.g., a scrolling news ticker), buffer several frames in advance.
*   **Hardware Implementation:**  Leverage dedicated hardware acceleration for layer blending and update area determination.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Global Variables
Layer[] layers;  // Array of layers, each with priority, content, and position
FrameBuffer frameBuffer;
DisplayController displayController;

// Function: DetermineUpdateAreas
function DetermineUpdateAreas(changes) {
    updateAreas = [];
    for each change in changes {
        layer = change.layer;
        area = change.area;
        priority = layer.priority;

        // Adjust update area based on priority
        if (priority == High) {
            // Immediate update, precise area
            updateAreas.add(area);
        } else if (priority == Medium) {
            // Batch update, potentially coarser area
            updateAreas.add(coarseArea(area));
        } else {
            // Delay update, consolidate with background refresh
            deferredUpdates.add(area);
        }
    }

    // Combine immediate and batched updates
    return updateAreas;
}

// Function: ApplyUpdates
function ApplyUpdates(updateAreas, deferredUpdates) {
    // Apply immediate updates
    frameBuffer.update(updateAreas);
    displayController.refresh(frameBuffer);

    // Process deferred updates during background refresh
    if (backgroundRefreshTriggered()) {
        frameBuffer.update(deferredUpdates);
        displayController.refresh(frameBuffer);
    }
}

// Function: Background Refresh
function BackgroundRefresh() {
    // Perform full-screen or partial refresh of low-priority layers
}
```

**Potential Hardware Components:**

*   Dedicated Layer Blending Engine
*   Priority Queue for Update Areas
*   Low-Power Memory for Buffered Frames
*   Adaptive Refresh Controller
*   Activity Detection Sensor (e.g., accelerometer)
