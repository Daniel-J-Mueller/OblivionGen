## Dynamic Aesthetic Drift & Personalization

**Concept:** Extend the aesthetic analysis beyond static item attributes to model *aesthetic drift* – how a user’s aesthetic preferences evolve over time – and proactively suggest collections that reflect this drift, even before the user explicitly signals a change in taste.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Modeling:**

1.  **Longitudinal User Interaction Logging:** System records *all* user interactions with presented item collections – not just selections ("likes" or purchases") but also dwell time on images, scrolling behavior within windows (indicating comparative evaluation), and the order in which items are viewed.
2.  **Aesthetic Feature Vector Evolution:** For each user, maintain a time-series of aesthetic feature vectors (derived from the "line type attribute" and potentially other aesthetic attributes identified in the patent) representing their expressed preferences. This is more than a simple average; it’s a rolling window of aesthetic preferences weighted by interaction data.  A Kalman filter or similar time-series model is used to predict future aesthetic drift.
3.  **Latent Aesthetic Space:** Utilize a variational autoencoder (VAE) or similar technique to map item aesthetic features and user preference vectors into a shared latent aesthetic space.  This allows for comparison of item and user aesthetics, and enables interpolation between aesthetics to suggest items subtly aligned with evolving preferences.

**II. Proactive Collection Generation:**

1.  **Drift Detection:**  Continuously monitor the user's aesthetic feature vector for significant deviations from their historical profile (using change point detection algorithms).
2.  **Collection Seeding:** When drift is detected, *seed* new collections with items that exhibit the *emerging* aesthetic characteristics (as reflected in the user's evolving aesthetic vector). This is *not* about finding items that perfectly match the current aesthetic, but rather about introducing items that nudge the user towards a refined taste.
3.  **Exploration/Exploitation Balancing:**  Implement a bandit algorithm (e.g., Thompson Sampling) to balance exploration (presenting items with uncertain aesthetic alignment) and exploitation (presenting items confidently predicted to match the user’s taste).  This prevents the system from becoming stuck in a filter bubble.
4.  **Collection Cohesion Modeling:**  Beyond individual item aesthetic alignment, model the *cohesion* of a collection based on how the aesthetic features of items complement each other. This ensures that collections feel curated and visually appealing, not just random assemblages.  A graph neural network (GNN) can represent the collection as a graph, with items as nodes and aesthetic similarity as edge weights.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Real-time Feature Extraction Pipeline:** Optimized pipeline for extracting aesthetic features from item images in real-time.  Utilizes GPU acceleration and model quantization for performance.
2.  **Distributed Training & Inference:**  Scalable architecture for training and deploying the aesthetic feature extraction models, user preference models, and collection cohesion models.  Utilizes Kubernetes and cloud-based machine learning services.
3.  **A/B Testing Framework:**  Robust A/B testing framework for evaluating the performance of different collection generation strategies and personalization algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Collection Generation):**

```python
def generate_collection(user_id, source_item):
  user_aesthetic_vector = get_user_aesthetic_vector(user_id)
  drift_detected, drift_magnitude = detect_aesthetic_drift(user_aesthetic_vector)

  if drift_detected:
    exploration_rate = min(1.0, drift_magnitude * 0.5) #Increase exploration with drift
  else:
    exploration_rate = 0.1 #Base exploration rate

  candidate_items = get_candidate_items(source_item.category)
  scored_items = []
  for item in candidate_items:
    item_aesthetic_vector = get_item_aesthetic_vector(item)
    similarity_score = calculate_similarity(user_aesthetic_vector, item_aesthetic_vector)
    #Add random noise to similarity score based on exploration rate.
    noise = random.gauss(0, exploration_rate * 0.2)
    final_score = similarity_score + noise
    scored_items.append((item, final_score))

  scored_items.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  selected_items = [item for item, score in scored_items[:5]] #Select top 5 items

  #Model Collection Cohesion. Refine selection further using GNN
  refined_collection = model_collection_cohesion(selected_items)

  return refined_collection
