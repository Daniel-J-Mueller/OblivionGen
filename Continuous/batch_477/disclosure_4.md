## Dynamic Audio Scene Generation

**Concept:** Extend the snippet functionality to allow users to *compose* short "scenes" of audio, layering multiple snippets (from songs, sound effects, spoken word) to create unique emotional or atmospheric moments, shareable as short-form audio content.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Scene Composition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Accepts multiple audio snippets (existing functionality from patent), user-defined scene duration (e.g., 5-15 seconds), and user-defined transition types (fade, crossfade, abrupt cut).
*   **Timeline Interface:**  A visual timeline editor within the messaging application. Users drag and drop audio snippets onto the timeline, adjusting their start/end points and positions.
*   **Layering:** Support for multiple audio layers (tracks).  Each layer can contain one or more snippets. Layers have individual volume control.
*   **Transition Effects:**  A library of pre-defined transition effects between snippets.  Users can adjust transition duration and parameters.
*   **Real-time Preview:**  Allows users to preview the composed scene in real-time as they edit.
*   **Scene Metadata:** Stores the composition details (snippets used, layer volumes, transition effects, duration) as scene metadata.

**2. Sound Effect & Spoken Word Integration:**

*   **Sound Effect Library:** Integrate a library of royalty-free sound effects (e.g., ambient sounds, impacts, whooshes). Categorize by mood/theme.
*   **Spoken Word Integration:**  Allow users to record short voice memos directly within the application, or import pre-recorded audio files.
*   **Text-to-Speech:**  Option to generate spoken word snippets from text input using a text-to-speech engine.  Allow users to select voice type/accent.

**3. AI-Assisted Scene Generation:**

*   **Mood/Theme Selection:**  Users select a desired mood or theme (e.g., "romantic," "energetic," "melancholy").
*   **AI Snippet Suggestion:** Based on the selected mood/theme, the AI suggests relevant audio snippets from the userâ€™s music library and sound effect library.
*   **AI Scene Composition:**  An "Auto-Compose" feature that automatically arranges suggested snippets into a basic scene structure, applying default transitions and volume levels.
*   **AI Parameter Adjustment:**  Allows users to adjust AI-generated parameters (e.g., tempo, key, mood intensity) to fine-tune the scene.
*   **AI-Driven Transitions**: Automatically create transitions based on mood shifts in the selected snippets.

**4. Sharing & Social Features:**

*   **Scene Export:**  Export scenes as short-form audio files (e.g., MP3, WAV).
*   **Scene Sharing:** Share scenes directly within the messaging application or to other social media platforms.
*   **Scene Remixing:** Allow other users to remix shared scenes, adding their own snippets and effects. (With appropriate attribution to the original creator.)
*   **Scene Library**: A library of publically available scenes which users can explore and remix.

**Pseudocode (AI Scene Composition):**

```
function composeScene(mood, theme, userSnippets) {
  suggestedSnippets = searchMusicLibrary(mood, theme);
  allSnippets = userSnippets + suggestedSnippets;

  //Basic arrangement - loop through snippets
  sceneTimeline = [];
  currentPosition = 0;

  for (snippet in allSnippets) {
    snippetDuration = getSnippetDuration(snippet);
    sceneTimeline.add(snippet, currentPosition, currentPosition + snippetDuration);
    currentPosition += snippetDuration + 0.5; // add a small gap
  }

  // Apply basic transitions (fade/crossfade)
  applyTransitions(sceneTimeline, "crossfade", 0.2);

  // AI Parameter Adjustment (volume leveling)
  levelVolumes(sceneTimeline);

  return sceneTimeline;
}
```
