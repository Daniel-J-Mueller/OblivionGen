## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Media Device Control

**Concept:** Extend remote control functionality beyond infrared/RF signaling by incorporating localized haptic feedback that *adapts* to the media being controlled and user interaction. This creates a more immersive and intuitive experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** "Haptic Node" – a small, wirelessly connected device (Bluetooth 5.x) that the user holds. This contains a miniature array of vibrotactile actuators capable of producing diverse textures and patterns.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** The existing RF interface receives commands from a central control hub (like the device in the patent). However, *before* transmitting the IR signal to the media device, the hub sends supplemental data to the Haptic Node.
*   **Supplemental Data:** This data includes:
    *   **Content Type:**  (e.g., Movie, Music, Game)
    *   **Contextual Information:** (e.g., Movie – Action Scene, Music – Bass Drop, Game – Explosion)
    *   **Interaction Type:** (e.g., Volume Increase, Channel Change, Menu Navigation)
*   **Haptic Node Processing:** The Haptic Node contains a processor that maps the received data to specific vibrotactile patterns. A library of pre-defined patterns exists, but the system also allows for dynamic pattern generation.
*   **Dynamic Pattern Generation:** A lightweight AI algorithm (running on the Haptic Node) analyzes the contextual information and generates unique vibrotactile patterns in real-time. This algorithm is trainable – allowing users to customize the haptic experience.
*   **User Customization:** Users can adjust haptic intensity, pattern complexity, and even define their own patterns through a companion app.
*   **Multi-Node Support:**  The system supports multiple Haptic Nodes, allowing for shared experiences (e.g., a family watching a movie together) or more complex interactions (e.g., a game where each hand controls a different aspect).

**Pseudocode (Haptic Node Processing):**

```
function process_data(content_type, context, interaction) {

  if (content_type == "Movie") {
    if (context == "Action Scene") {
      pattern = generate_rumble_pattern(intensity: 7, frequency: 20Hz);
    } else if (context == "Dialogue") {
      pattern = generate_subtle_pulse_pattern(intensity: 3, frequency: 5Hz);
    } else {
      pattern = default_movie_pattern();
    }
  } else if (content_type == "Music") {
    if (context == "Bass Drop") {
      pattern = generate_low_frequency_pulse(intensity: 10, frequency: 20Hz);
    } else {
      pattern = generate_beat_synchronized_pattern(frequency: calculate_BPM());
    }
  } else if (content_type == "Game") {
    // Game-specific logic based on event triggers
    if (event == "Explosion") {
      pattern = generate_high_frequency_burst(intensity: 8);
    }
  } else {
    pattern = default_pattern(); // Generic feedback for other content
  }

  // Apply user customization settings
  pattern.intensity = user_intensity_setting;
  pattern.complexity = user_complexity_setting;

  // Render pattern on vibrotactile actuators
  render_pattern(pattern);
}
```
