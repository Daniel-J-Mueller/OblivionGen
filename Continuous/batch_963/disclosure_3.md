## Adaptive Contextual Triggering for Multi-Modal Device Control

**Concept:** Expand upon the invocation phrase triggering to enable dynamic, context-aware control of *multiple* devices based on a combination of spoken command *and* ambient environmental data.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Network Integration:** System must interface with a local device network (WiFi, Bluetooth Mesh, Zigbee, etc.). Registered devices are categorized by type (lighting, HVAC, entertainment, security, etc.) and location (room-based tagging).
*   **Environmental Sensor Input:**  Integrate data streams from ambient sensors (temperature, light level, motion, sound) available on the control device *or* distributed across the network. 
*   **Contextual Rule Engine:** A rule engine processes sensor data and user speech to determine appropriate actions. Rules are structured as:
    *   `IF [sensor condition] AND [spoken phrase] THEN [device action]`
    *   Example: `IF [room = "living room" AND temperature > 75°F] AND [spoken phrase = "I'm warm"] THEN [HVAC setpoint = 72°F AND fan = auto]`
*   **Dynamic Rule Creation & Learning:**
    *   Initial set of pre-defined rules.
    *   User interface for creating custom rules via natural language or graphical interface.
    *   Machine learning component to learn user preferences and automatically suggest or create new rules based on observed behavior.
*   **Multi-Device Orchestration:**  System must be capable of controlling multiple devices simultaneously as part of a single action.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** All sensor data processing performed locally on the device whenever possible. Minimal data transmitted to the cloud, and only with explicit user consent. Data anonymization/encryption employed for cloud-based learning.

**Pseudocode - Rule Engine Processing:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessCommand(spokenPhrase, sensorData)

    // Extract relevant information from spoken phrase (intent, entities)
    intent = AnalyzeIntent(spokenPhrase)
    entities = ExtractEntities(spokenPhrase)

    // Filter rules based on intent and entities
    matchingRules = SELECT * FROM Rules WHERE Intent = intent AND Entities CONTAINS entities

    // Evaluate rules based on sensor data
    FOR EACH rule IN matchingRules
        IF EvaluateCondition(rule.Condition, sensorData) THEN
            ExecuteAction(rule.Action)
            RETURN // Execute the first matching rule
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR

    // No matching rule found - provide feedback to user
    DISPLAY "Sorry, I didn't understand that command."

ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION EvaluateCondition(condition, sensorData)
    // Parse condition string (e.g., "temperature > 75")
    // Retrieve relevant sensor values from sensorData
    // Evaluate the condition using the sensor values
    // RETURN True if the condition is met, False otherwise
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION ExecuteAction(action)
    // Parse action string (e.g., "HVAC setpoint = 72")
    // Identify the target device and action to perform
    // Send the command to the device
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Expansions:**

*   **Predictive Actions:** Proactively suggest actions based on learned behavior and anticipated needs.
*   **Personalized Environments:** Dynamically adjust device settings based on user identity and preferences.
*   **Integration with Calendar/Scheduling:** Trigger actions based on calendar events or scheduled routines.
*   **Biometric Input:** Incorporate biometric data (e.g., heart rate, skin temperature) to further refine contextual awareness.
