## Dynamic Inventory Prioritization & "Local Boost"

**Concept:** Expand the system to not only surface local vs. non-local inventory but to dynamically adjust product *ranking* within the displayed list based on predicted immediate local demand, potentially overriding standard search relevance. This creates a "Local Boost" effect, favoring items likely to be purchased *right now* within that delivery region.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:**
    *   Real-time sales data by region (down to zip code granularity).
    *   Historical sales data (daily, weekly, seasonal trends).
    *   External data feeds: Local events (concerts, sports games, weather events - driving demand for specific items - e.g., umbrellas, portable chargers).
    *   Social media trends (detecting spikes in interest for specific products locally).
*   **Demand Prediction Engine:**
    *   Time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict short-term demand (next hour, next few hours).
    *   Machine learning model trained on historical sales, external data, and potentially user browsing behavior (within privacy constraints) to refine demand predictions.
    *   Consideration of “impulse buy” potential – certain items benefit more from immediate visibility.
*   **Ranking Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   Base Rank: Standard search relevance score.
    *   Local Demand Multiplier: Calculated based on predicted demand. Higher predicted demand = Higher multiplier.
    *   Inventory Availability Factor:  Prioritize items with sufficient local stock.  Avoid showing items with very limited or no local availability even if demand is high.
    *   "Boost Threshold": Configurable parameter determining how aggressively local demand overrides search relevance.
    *   Final Rank = Base Rank * Local Demand Multiplier * Inventory Availability Factor

*   **UI/UX Integration:**
    *   Subtle visual cues to indicate “Local Boosted” items (e.g., a small leaf icon, “Popular Now” label).
    *   Option for users to toggle between “Relevance” and “Local Popularity” sorting.

**Pseudocode (Ranking Adjustment):**

```
function calculate_final_rank(product, search_query, location) {
  base_rank = calculate_base_rank(product, search_query); // Existing search relevance algorithm
  local_demand_multiplier = predict_local_demand(product, location);
  inventory_availability_factor = check_local_stock(product, location);

  final_rank = base_rank * local_demand_multiplier * inventory_availability_factor

  return final_rank
}

function predict_local_demand(product, location) {
  //Access real-time and historical sales data
  //Access external data sources (events, social media)
  //Apply time-series forecasting and machine learning model
  //Return a multiplier value (e.g., 0.5 - 2.0)
}

function check_local_stock(product, location) {
  //Check inventory levels at the local materials handling facility
  //Return a factor (e.g., 0.1 if low stock, 1.0 if sufficient stock)
}
```

**Engineer Notes:** Focus on scalability of the demand prediction engine.  Real-time data ingestion and processing will be critical. The algorithm needs to be easily configurable and adjustable to avoid unintended consequences (e.g., consistently showing the same few items).  A/B testing is essential to validate the effectiveness of the "Local Boost" feature.
