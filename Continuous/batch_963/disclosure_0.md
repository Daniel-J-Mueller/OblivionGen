## Adaptive Temporal Consistency with Learned Optical Flow

**Concept:** Enhance video quality not just frame-by-frame, but leveraging inter-frame coherence *dynamically* adjusted based on scene content. The existing patent focuses on using previous *generated* high-resolution frames. This expands on that concept, creating a more robust and adaptive system that estimates motion and warps previous frames for use as a stronger prior *before* applying the neural network enhancement.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Optical Flow Estimation.**
    *   Input: Current low-resolution frame, and previous frame (either enhanced or original).
    *   Process: Employ a learned optical flow network (e.g., PWC-Net, RAFT) to generate a dense optical flow field. This field represents the motion of each pixel between the two frames.
    *   Output: Dense optical flow field.

*   **Module 2: Prior Frame Warping & Blending.**
    *   Input:  Optical flow field, previous enhanced frame.
    *   Process: Warp the previous enhanced frame using the estimated optical flow.  This projects the previous frame onto the current frame's coordinate space, aligning moving objects and backgrounds. Implement a blending weight (alpha, range 0-1) that is *content-aware* (see Content Analysis Module).  Blend the warped previous frame with the current low-resolution frame using the alpha weight:  `BlendedFrame = alpha * WarpedPreviousFrame + (1 - alpha) * CurrentLowResFrame`.
    *   Output:  Blended frame, serving as a strong prior for the enhancement network.

*   **Module 3: Content Analysis.**
    *   Input: Current low-resolution frame.
    *   Process:  A lightweight CNN analyzes the frame to determine scene characteristics. Key metrics:
        *   **Motion Magnitude:** Estimate the average pixel displacement in the optical flow (derived from Module 1). Higher values indicate fast motion.
        *   **Texture Complexity:** Calculate a measure of texture density (e.g., using a Gabor filter bank).
        *   **Object Density:** Detect the number of salient objects in the frame (using a pre-trained object detector like YOLO).
    *   Output: A feature vector representing scene characteristics.

*   **Module 4: Alpha Weight Prediction Network.**
    *   Input: Feature vector from Module 3.
    *   Process: A small, fully connected neural network maps the feature vector to an optimal alpha weight value.  The network is trained to maximize perceptual quality based on a dataset of video sequences.
    *   Output: Alpha weight (float between 0 and 1).

*   **Module 5: Enhancement Network.**
    *   Input: Blended frame (from Module 2).
    *   Process: The existing enhancement network (as described in the patent) is applied to the blended frame.
    *   Output: Enhanced frame.

**Training Data:** A large dataset of video sequences with varying content, motion, and resolution.  Ground truth high-resolution frames are required for supervised training.  Loss function: A combination of L1 loss (pixel-wise difference) and a perceptual loss (e.g., using a pre-trained VGG network).

**Pseudocode:**

```
For each frame in video:

    optical_flow = estimate_optical_flow(current_frame, previous_enhanced_frame)
    warped_previous_frame = warp_frame(previous_enhanced_frame, optical_flow)
    scene_features = analyze_scene(current_frame)
    alpha = predict_alpha(scene_features)
    blended_frame = alpha * warped_previous_frame + (1 - alpha) * current_frame
    enhanced_frame = enhancement_network(blended_frame)
    previous_enhanced_frame = enhanced_frame
    Output enhanced_frame
```

**Novelty:**  Dynamically adjusts temporal consistency based on scene content, enabling more effective utilization of prior information and potentially reducing artifacts in fast-moving or complex scenes.  Moves beyond static blending and introduces learned blending weights based on scene analysis.
