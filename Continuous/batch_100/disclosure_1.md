## Adaptive Notification ‘Sculpting’ – Project: Chronos

**Concept:** Expand beyond hierarchical notification *presentation* to dynamically restructure the underlying data *before* presentation, effectively “sculpting” the information to match the user's current cognitive load and context. This goes beyond simply prioritizing; it alters the informational building blocks themselves.

**Specs:**

**1. Cognitive Load Assessment Module:**

*   **Input:** Continuous stream of user data –  device usage patterns (app switching frequency, duration per app), biometric data (heart rate variability via wearable integration), ambient sensor data (location, time of day, detected activity – walking, driving, meeting), and interaction data (voice command latency, screen touch pressure/speed).
*   **Processing:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict the user's current cognitive load on a scale of 1-10.  Higher scores indicate higher load. This prediction is updated in real-time.
*   **Output:** Cognitive Load Score (CLS).

**2.  Notification Data Abstraction Layer (NDAL):**

*   **Function:** Intercepts all incoming notification data *before* it reaches the presentation layer.  Normalizes data into a structured format (e.g., JSON) with standardized fields:  `entity`, `action`, `details`, `urgency`.
*   **Dynamic Detail Reduction:**  Based on CLS, NDAL selectively reduces the granularity of `details`. Levels:
    *   **CLS 1-3 (Low Load):**  Full details are retained.
    *   **CLS 4-6 (Medium Load):** Details are summarized. E.g., “New email from John Doe” instead of full subject line and snippet.  Complex data structures are flattened.
    *   **CLS 7-10 (High Load):** Details are stripped entirely, leaving only `entity` and `action`.  E.g., “New Email” – user must actively request details.
*   **Entity Consolidation:** NDAL identifies related entities.  E.g., multiple notifications from the same sender or about the same project are combined into a single notification with a count.

**3.  Adaptive Presentation Engine (APE):**

*   **Input:** Modified notification data from NDAL, CLS.
*   **Output:**  A dynamically generated notification payload suitable for audio, visual, or haptic presentation.
*   **Presentation Modes:**
    *   **Audio:**  Concise verbal summaries tailored to CLS. Prioritized information is spoken first.
    *   **Visual:**  Notifications displayed as a stack of cards, with the most relevant information on top.  Card size and detail level are adjusted based on CLS.
    *   **Haptic:**  Different vibration patterns used to signal urgency and information type.
*   **“Bloom” Functionality:** User can ‘bloom’ a simplified notification to reveal more detail – initiating a request to the source for the originally stripped details.

**4.  Learning and Personalization:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  Tracks user interaction with notifications (e.g., swipes, dismissals, ‘blooms’, ignored notifications).
*   **Reward Function:**  Rewards the agent for presenting information that the user engages with quickly and efficiently.
*   **Personalized CLS Thresholds:**  The agent learns the user’s individual sensitivity to cognitive load and adjusts the CLS thresholds accordingly.



**Pseudocode (NDAL - Detail Reduction):**

```
function reduce_details(notification, cls) {
  if (cls >= 1 && cls <= 3) {
    return notification; // No reduction
  } else if (cls >= 4 && cls <= 6) {
    notification.details = summarize(notification.details); // Apply summarization algorithm
    return notification;
  } else {
    notification.details = null; // Strip details
    return notification;
  }
}

function summarize(text) {
  // Implement summarization algorithm (e.g., using a pre-trained language model)
  // Return a shorter version of the text
}
```

This system isn’t just *presenting* information differently; it’s fundamentally changing the information itself based on the user’s current mental state.  It anticipates cognitive overload and preemptively simplifies the flow of information, potentially significantly improving user experience and reducing mental fatigue.
