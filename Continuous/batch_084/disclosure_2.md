## Personalized Search Result ‘Evolution’ – Temporal Preference Mapping

**System Overview:**

This system extends the event data tracking described in the patent to create a dynamic, evolving representation of a user’s search preferences *over time*. It doesn’t just record *that* a URL was visited, but *when* relative to other URLs, and integrates this data with the user's search query history. This allows for a far more nuanced understanding of user intent, going beyond simple "previously visited" indicators.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Temporal Preference Vector (TPV):**  For each user, maintain a vector representing their preference for different ‘content themes’ (determined through NLP analysis of visited URLs and search queries).  The vector's dimensions represent these themes (e.g., ‘AI’, ‘cooking’, ‘historical fiction’). Each dimension’s value represents the *rate of decay* of the user’s interest in that theme.  Higher values mean interest fades faster.

2.  **Decay Function:** A configurable function (exponential, logarithmic, etc.) used to model the decay of interest in a content theme.  This function considers the time since the last interaction with content from that theme.

3.  **Query-URL Theme Mapping:** A module to map both search queries and URLs to their dominant content themes. NLP techniques (topic modeling, keyword extraction) are used.

4.  **Search Result Re-Ranking Engine:**  This component intercepts search results *before* they are presented to the user. It re-ranks results based on the user’s TPV.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Event Data Ingestion:** The system continues to ingest event data (URL visits, search queries) as described in the patent.

2.  **Theme Extraction & Update:**
    *   For each event (URL visit, search query), extract the dominant content themes.
    *   Update the user’s TPV.  
        *   Increase the value of dimensions corresponding to relevant themes.
        *   Apply the Decay Function to *all* dimensions, reducing values over time. This effectively forgets older interests.
        *   The magnitude of the increase/decrease is configurable, allowing for calibration.

3.  **Search Query Processing:**
    *   When a user submits a search query, extract the dominant content themes.
    *   Calculate a ‘preference score’ for each search result URL based on the similarity between its themes and the user’s TPV.  URLs matching themes with high values in the TPV receive higher scores.

4.  **Search Result Re-Ranking:**
    *   Re-rank the search results based on the calculated preference scores.  Results with higher scores are presented higher in the results list.

**Pseudocode (Search Result Re-Ranking):**

```
function reRankSearchResults(searchQuery, searchResults, userTPV):
  for each url in searchResults:
    urlThemes = extractThemes(url)
    preferenceScore = 0
    for each theme in urlThemes:
      if theme exists in userTPV:
        preferenceScore += userTPV[theme] //Value from TPV
    url.score = preferenceScore
  searchResults.sort(by: url.score, descending: true)
  return searchResults
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   **Decay Function Type:** (exponential, logarithmic, linear)
*   **Decay Rate:** Controls how quickly interests fade.
*   **Theme Granularity:**  Controls the level of detail in theme extraction.
*   **TPV Dimension Count:**  Number of content themes represented in the TPV.
*   **Smoothing Factor:**  Prevents drastic changes in the TPV.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Cross-User Preference Modeling:**  Identify users with similar TPVs and leverage their preferences to improve search results for each other.
*   **Proactive Content Suggestion:**  Based on the user’s TPV, proactively suggest content they might be interested in.
*   **Personalized News Feed:**  Generate a personalized news feed based on the user’s evolving interests.
