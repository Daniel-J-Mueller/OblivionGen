## Dynamic Contextual Skill Stitching

**Concept:** Extend the error recovery mechanism to proactively "stitch" together skills based on inferred user context, *before* an explicit error occurs. This aims to anticipate user needs and streamline complex interactions.

**Specs:**

*   **Contextual Inference Engine:** A module that continuously monitors user interactions (speech, text, past behavior, time of day, location data - with appropriate permissions, of course) to build a dynamic user profile and predict likely intents *beyond* the immediate input. This is separate from the standard ASR/NLU pipeline.
*   **Skill Graph Database:** A knowledge base mapping skills to contextual factors.  Each skill node contains metadata like:
    *   Skill Description
    *   Activation Threshold (Contextual Score - see below)
    *   Dependencies (other skills that should be loaded concurrently)
    *   Output Formatting (how data should be presented to the user)
*   **Contextual Scoring:**  The Inference Engine assigns a "Contextual Score" to each skill based on the current user profile. This score represents the probability that the skill is relevant.  The score is calculated using a weighted sum of relevant contextual factors (e.g., location, time, past behavior, recently discussed topics).
*   **Proactive Skill Loading:**  When the Contextual Score of a skill exceeds a predefined threshold, the system *proactively* loads and initializes the skill, even before the user explicitly requests it.
*   **Seamless Handoff:** If the user's subsequent input aligns with the proactively loaded skill, the system seamlessly hands off the interaction without any delay or error recovery process.
*   **Skill Chain Management:**  If multiple skills are loaded, the system automatically manages the skill chain based on the userâ€™s interaction. This could involve chaining skills together to achieve a more complex task.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  The activation thresholds for each skill are dynamically adjusted based on user feedback and interaction patterns.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  userInput = receiveUserInput();
  userContext = buildUserContext(userInput, pastInteractions, location, time);

  // Calculate Contextual Scores for all Skills
  for each skill in skillGraph {
    skill.contextualScore = calculateContextualScore(skill, userContext);
  }

  // Load Skills with High Contextual Scores
  for each skill in skillGraph {
    if (skill.contextualScore > skill.activationThreshold) {
      loadSkill(skill);
    }
  }

  // Process User Input
  if (loadedSkills.contains(skillMatchingUserInput())) {
    handleUserInputWithLoadedSkill(userInput);
  } else {
    // Standard ASR/NLU Pipeline and Error Recovery (as in original patent)
    performASR(userInput);
    performNLU(textData);
    // ... Error Recovery if needed
  }
}

// Function: calculateContextualScore(skill, userContext)
//   - Returns a weighted sum of contextual factors relevant to the skill.
//   - Weights are learned through machine learning.

// Function: loadSkill(skill)
//   - Loads the skill's code and initializes it.
//   - Starts any necessary background processes.
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Commute Mode:** When the user is detected to be commuting, proactively load skills related to traffic updates, podcast playback, and hands-free calling.
*   **Cooking Mode:** When the user is in the kitchen and mentions ingredients, proactively load recipe skills and cooking timers.
*   **Shopping Mode:** When the user is near a store and has a history of purchases, proactively load relevant product information and offers.
