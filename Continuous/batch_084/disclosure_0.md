## Dynamic Patch Composition & Semantic Conflict Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the patch application process to not just *limit* disruption but to *actively compose* patches based on semantic understanding of the code, resolving conflicts *before* application, and providing a confidence score for the composition.

**Specification:**

**I. Semantic Graph Generation:**

1.  **Input:** Source code (pre-patch), proposed patch.
2.  **Process:** Utilize a static analysis tool (e.g., leveraging LLMs fine-tuned for code understanding) to construct a semantic graph of the source code and the patch. Nodes represent code constructs (functions, variables, classes, loops, conditional statements). Edges represent relationships (calls, data dependencies, inheritance).
3.  **Output:** Two semantic graphs: `G_source`, `G_patch`.  Graph nodes should contain metadata: type, scope, dependencies, and a generated semantic embedding vector.

**II. Conflict Detection & Quantification:**

1.  **Input:** `G_source`, `G_patch`.
2.  **Process:**
    *   **Node Similarity:**  Compute the cosine similarity between embedding vectors of nodes in `G_source` and `G_patch` to identify potentially conflicting changes.  A threshold (configurable) determines initial conflicts.
    *   **Dependency Analysis:**  Trace dependencies within both graphs.  If a node in `G_patch` modifies a dependency of a node in `G_source`, flag a conflict. Consider transitive dependencies.
    *   **Control Flow Analysis:** Compare control flow graphs derived from the semantic graphs.  Identify differing execution paths that could lead to unexpected behavior.
3.  **Output:** A Conflict Report: a list of identified conflicts, each with a severity score (based on dependency depth, control flow impact, and node similarity), and a description of the potential impact.

**III. Dynamic Patch Composition:**

1.  **Input:** `G_source`, `G_patch`, Conflict Report.
2.  **Process:**
    *   **Conflict Resolution Strategies:** Implement a set of automated conflict resolution strategies:
        *   **Code Fusion:**  If conflicting code segments have similar functionality, attempt to merge them into a single, coherent segment.
        *   **Code Reordering:**  Reorder code segments to minimize conflicts without altering functionality.
        *   **Conditional Application:** Apply the patch only under specific conditions (e.g., based on system configuration or feature flags).
        *   **Patch Decomposition:** Break down the patch into smaller, independent sub-patches that can be applied sequentially with reduced conflict potential.
    *   **Strategy Selection:** Utilize a reinforcement learning (RL) agent trained to select the optimal conflict resolution strategy based on the Conflict Report and code context. The reward function should prioritize minimizing runtime errors and maximizing code stability.
    *   **Composed Patch Generation:** Generate a new patch (`G_composed`) incorporating the selected conflict resolution strategy.

**IV. Confidence Scoring:**

1.  **Input:** `G_source`, `G_composed`.
2.  **Process:**
    *   **Differential Testing:**  Run a suite of automated tests on both the original code and the composed code.
    *   **Code Complexity Analysis:** Calculate code complexity metrics (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, lines of code) for both versions.
    *   **Semantic Similarity:** Calculate the semantic similarity between the original and composed code using techniques like sentence embeddings.
    *   **Confidence Score Calculation:** Combine the results of the differential testing, code complexity analysis, and semantic similarity into a single confidence score (ranging from 0 to 1).

**V. System Architecture:**

*   **Patch Composition Engine:**  Core component responsible for semantic graph generation, conflict detection, dynamic patch composition, and confidence scoring.
*   **Test Automation Framework:**  Provides a platform for running automated tests on the original and composed code.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  Trains and deploys the RL agent for selecting optimal conflict resolution strategies.
*   **API Interface:**  Provides a programmatic interface for integrating the patch composition engine into existing development workflows.



**Pseudocode (Simplified Conflict Resolution Strategy Selection):**

```pseudocode
function select_resolution_strategy(conflict_report, code_context, rl_agent):
    strategy = rl_agent.predict(conflict_report, code_context)
    return strategy

function apply_strategy(strategy, conflict_report, patch):
    if strategy == "code_fusion":
        return fuse_code(conflict_report, patch)
    elif strategy == "code_reordering":
        return reorder_code(conflict_report, patch)
    elif strategy == "conditional_application":
        return create_conditional_patch(conflict_report, patch)
    else:
        return patch // Default: Apply patch as is.
```
