## Adaptive Encoding with Perceptual Hash Synchronization

**Concept:** Extend synchronized encoding beyond simple timestamp alignment to incorporate perceptual hash synchronization. This ensures visual consistency *even with* encoding parameter differences, minimizing jarring transitions during encoder switching (e.g., failover, load balancing).

**Specs:**

**1. Perceptual Hash Generation Module:**

   *   **Input:** Raw video frame (YUV420p preferred).
   *   **Process:**
        1.  Downscale the frame to a fixed, low resolution (e.g., 64x48).
        2.  Convert to grayscale.
        3.  Apply a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to the grayscale image.
        4.  Retain only the lowest N DCT coefficients (e.g., N=10-20). These represent the most significant visual features.
        5.  Normalize the coefficients.
        6.  Generate a unique hash value (e.g., using SHA-256) from the normalized coefficients.
   *   **Output:** 64-bit Perceptual Hash.

**2. Synchronization Protocol Enhancement:**

   *   Existing timestamp synchronization protocol remains.
   *   **New:** Add “Perceptual Hash Exchange” message type.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  Encoder A (primary) generates a perceptual hash for each encoded frame.
        2.  Encoder A transmits the hash *along with* the timestamp via the synchronization protocol.
        3.  Encoder B (secondary) receives the hash and timestamp.
        4.  Encoder B calculates the perceptual hash of *its* currently processed frame.
        5.  Encoder B compares its hash to the received hash.
        6.  **Hash Difference Threshold:** Define a threshold (e.g., Hamming distance of 5 bits) to determine acceptable visual difference.
        7.  **Adaptive Encoding Adjustment:**
            *   If hash difference exceeds threshold:
                *   Adjust encoding parameters (quantization parameters, GOP structure) of Encoder B *before* encoding the current frame to minimize visual difference. This could involve subtly altering the QP values, or slightly adjusting the frame rate. The adjustment should be limited to prevent excessive artifacts.
            *   If hash difference is within the threshold, proceed with normal encoding.

**3. Encoder Parameter Negotiation:**

   *   Initial handshake to exchange supported encoding parameters (codec, resolution, bitrate, QP ranges).
   *   Establish a priority list of parameters for adjustment during hash mismatch. (e.g. QP > Frame Rate > Resolution)

**4.  Failover Mechanism Enhancement:**

    *    Upon failover, the secondary encoder immediately begins adjusting its encoding parameters based on the last received perceptual hash and timestamp from the primary.
    *    This ensures a seamless transition, avoiding jarring visual shifts during switchover.

**Pseudocode (Secondary Encoder):**

```
loop:
    receive (timestamp, perceptualHash) from Primary Encoder
    currentFrame = decode next frame
    currentPerceptualHash = generatePerceptualHash(currentFrame)
    hashDifference = calculateHashDifference(currentPerceptualHash, perceptualHash)
    if hashDifference > threshold:
        // Adjust encoding parameters based on priority list
        newQP = adjustQP(currentQP, hashDifference)
        setEncodingParameters(codec, resolution, bitrate, newQP)
    encodedFrame = encode(currentFrame)
    transmit(encodedFrame)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Encoding hardware with support for dynamic adjustment of quantization parameters.
*   Sufficient processing power to perform perceptual hash calculations in real-time.
*   Modified encoding software to incorporate perceptual hash exchange and adaptive encoding logic.
