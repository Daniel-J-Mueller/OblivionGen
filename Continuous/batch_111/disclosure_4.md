## Dynamic Difficulty & Contextual Question Generation

**System Overview:**

A system for layered account recovery employing dynamic question difficulty adjustment and contextually relevant question generation based on ongoing user behavior *and* external data streams. The core is shifting from static “security questions” to an adaptive ‘challenge’ system.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler:** Continuously monitors user activity: typing speed, common phrases, navigation patterns, time of day access, geolocation (optional, user consent required). This creates a baseline ‘behavioral fingerprint.’

2.  **External Context Engine:** Integrates with publicly available data (social media - optional, user consent required, news feeds, current events). Identifies context relevant to the user (e.g., recent travel, purchases, expressed interests).

3.  **Question Generator:**  The generator has multiple 'question types'. These types include:
    *   **Behavioral Challenges:**  "Recreate your typical typing rhythm for the phrase 'secure access'." (Analyzes keystroke dynamics). "Navigate to the section of the site you most frequently use." (Tracks navigation path).
    *   **Contextual Questions:** "You recently booked a flight to Denver. What airline did you use?" (Leverages external data). "Based on your recent browsing history, which of these products are you most likely to be interested in?" (Uses browsing data).
    *   **Knowledge-Based Questions:** Traditional security questions, but randomized and less predictable. (Used sparingly).
    *   **Image/Audio Recognition:**  "Identify the image you uploaded as your profile picture."  "Confirm the audio clip of your voice."

4.  **Difficulty Adjuster:** Modifies question difficulty based on:
    *   **User History:**  Success/failure rates on previous challenges.
    *   **Risk Level:**  Detected anomalies (e.g., unusual login location, suspicious activity).
    *   **Contextual Factors:** Increased difficulty if the user is accessing the account from a shared device or public network.

5.  **Trust Score Engine:** Similar to the patent's trust score but weighted heavily towards behavioral challenges.  Behavioral matches receive significantly higher score increases than knowledge-based question answers. 

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
UserBehaviorProfile = LoadUserProfile(UserID)
CurrentTrustScore = 0
ChallengeCount = 0
MaxChallengeCount = 5

// Account Recovery Sequence
while (CurrentTrustScore < TrustThreshold AND ChallengeCount < MaxChallengeCount) {

  // 1. Determine Challenge Type & Difficulty
  ChallengeType = SelectChallengeType(UserBehaviorProfile, RiskLevel) //(Behavioral, Contextual, Knowledge)
  Difficulty = AdjustDifficulty(ChallengeType, UserBehaviorProfile, RiskLevel)

  // 2. Generate Challenge
  Challenge = GenerateChallenge(ChallengeType, Difficulty)

  // 3. Present Challenge to User
  PresentChallenge(Challenge)

  // 4. Receive User Response
  UserResponse = GetUserResponse()

  // 5. Evaluate Response
  Accuracy = EvaluateResponse(UserResponse, Challenge)

  // 6. Update Trust Score
  TrustScoreDelta = Accuracy * DifficultyWeighting(ChallengeType)
  CurrentTrustScore += TrustScoreDelta

  // 7. Update UserBehaviorProfile (for future challenges)
  UpdateUserProfile(UserID, Challenge, Accuracy)

  ChallengeCount++
}

if (CurrentTrustScore >= TrustThreshold) {
  AllowAccountAccess()
} else {
  LockAccount() // Or escalate to alternative recovery methods (e.g., email verification)
}
```
