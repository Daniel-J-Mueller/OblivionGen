## Modular Rotary Conveyance with Active Tilt Control

**Concept:** Expand the core rotary conveyance mechanism to a fully modular system, incorporating individual carriage tilt control for optimized item placement and discharge. This moves beyond simply presenting a horizontal surface to actively managing the *orientation* of items within the tote during the process.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Modular Wheel Segments:** The primary rotary structure is constructed from interconnected wheel segments. Each segment is approximately 1 meter in arc length. This allows for scalability and customization of the overall rotary diameter. Segments connect via high-strength, quick-release magnetic couplings with integrated power/data pass-through.

*   **Individual Carriage Modules:** Each carriage is a self-contained module, approximately 60cm x 40cm, capable of supporting up to 25kg.  Each module contains:
    *   **Micro-Actuator Array:** An array of six miniature, high-torque servo motors (e.g., digital micro servos with integrated encoders) positioned at the four corners and midpoint of the carriage base. These actuators are responsible for precise tilt control – both rotational and angular.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  A 9-DOF IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) provides real-time orientation data to the control system.
    *   **Wireless Communication:**  Each carriage communicates wirelessly (e.g., 802.11ah/Zigbee) with the central control system.
    *   **Integrated Conveyor Segment:** Short, powered conveyor segment within each carriage – capable of localized item movement/discharge.
    *   **Power Supply:** Each carriage has a rechargeable battery pack (inductive charging) and a backup power connection from the wheel segment.

*   **Wheel Segment Integration:** Each wheel segment incorporates:
    *   **Magnetic Carriage Guides:**  Strong magnetic tracks guide carriage movement along the wheel arc.
    *   **Power/Data Bus:** Conductive pathways embedded within the wheel segment transfer power and data to the carriages.
    *   **Proximity Sensors:** Detect carriage presence and position along the arc.

*   **Central Control System:**
    *   **Real-time Kinematic (RTK) Positioning:**  Combines IMU data from each carriage with wheel segment proximity sensors to create a precise 3D model of carriage positions.
    *   **Trajectory Planning:**  Generates optimized carriage trajectories for item placement and discharge, considering item size, weight, and fragility.
    *   **Active Tilt Algorithm:**  Calculates and executes precise tilt commands for each carriage to maintain item stability during rotation and prevent slippage.
    *   **User Interface:**  Allows operators to define item profiles, set placement targets, and monitor system performance.
    *   **API Integration:** Enables seamless integration with warehouse management systems (WMS) and robotics platforms.

**Pseudocode for Active Tilt Algorithm:**

```
// Define item profile (size, weight, center of gravity)
ItemProfile item = getItemProfile(itemID);

// Read current carriage orientation (IMU data)
Orientation currentOrientation = getOrientation(carriageID);

// Calculate target orientation based on desired item placement
Orientation targetOrientation = calculateTargetOrientation(item, placementTarget);

// Calculate tilt corrections
TiltCorrections corrections = calculateTiltCorrections(currentOrientation, targetOrientation);

// Apply tilt corrections to servo motors
setServoAngles(corrections.frontLeft, corrections.frontRight, corrections.rearLeft, corrections.rearRight);

// Monitor item stability (accelerometer data)
if (itemIsUnstable()) {
    // Adjust tilt corrections
    // OR slow rotation speed
}
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Multi-Tiered Systems:** Stack multiple rotary layers on top of each other to increase throughput in a limited footprint.
*   **Integrated Robotic Arms:** Incorporate small robotic arms into each carriage for precise item manipulation.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:**  Allow the rotary system to dynamically reconfigure its shape and size based on demand.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Use sensor data to predict potential failures and schedule preventative maintenance.
