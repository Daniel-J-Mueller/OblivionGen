## Dynamic Risk Thresholding via Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Integrate behavioral biometrics – keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, scrolling speed – *into* the risk score calculation alongside traditional fraud checks.  Furthermore, *dynamically adjust* the risk thresholds based on contextual factors and transaction history.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data (keystroke timings, mouse coordinates/velocity/acceleration, scrolling behavior, touch input data if applicable).
*   **Processing:** Capture raw input data, filter noise, and calculate relevant features (e.g., average keystroke dwell time, mouse path complexity, scrolling rhythm).
*   **Output:** Feature vector representing user’s behavioral profile.
*   **Technology:** JavaScript event listeners (for web-based interfaces), native OS APIs for capturing input events. Data streamed to a backend analytics engine.

**2. Behavioral Profile Database:**

*   **Storage:** Time-series database optimized for storing and retrieving behavioral feature vectors.  User-specific profiles are maintained.
*   **Profile Creation:** Initial profile established after a "learning period" where baseline behavioral patterns are recorded.  Continuous updates to the profile with each transaction.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize statistical methods (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian Mixture Models) to identify deviations from the user’s established behavioral profile.  Calculate an "anomaly score" representing the degree of deviation.
*   **Privacy:** Implement anonymization and differential privacy techniques to protect user data.

**3. Dynamic Risk Scoring Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Automated fraud check results (from existing system).
    *   Anomaly score (from behavioral profile database).
    *   Transaction context:
        *   Transaction amount.
        *   Time of day.
        *   Geographic location.
        *   User’s historical transaction patterns.
        *   Seller’s reputation/history.
    *   Device fingerprinting data (browser, OS, hardware).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Weighted combination of multiple risk factors.  Weights are dynamically adjusted based on the transaction context. (e.g., a high-value transaction at an unusual time of day warrants higher weighting of behavioral anomalies).
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., Gradient Boosted Trees, Neural Network) trained to predict the probability of fraudulent activity.
    *   Real-time adjustment of risk thresholds based on overall system performance and feedback from manual reviews.
*   **Output:**  A comprehensive risk score.

**4. Adaptive Authentication Module:**

*   **Input:** Risk Score.
*   **Processing:**
    *   If Risk Score < Low Threshold:  Allow transaction without further authentication.
    *   If Low Threshold <= Risk Score < Medium Threshold:  Trigger step-up authentication (e.g., SMS OTP, biometrics).
    *   If Risk Score >= Medium Threshold:  Decline transaction and initiate manual review.
*   **Output:** Authentication decision.

**Pseudocode (Risk Scoring):**

```
function calculateRiskScore(fraudCheckScore, anomalyScore, transactionAmount, timeOfDay, userHistory) {

  // Define base weights
  let weightFraud = 0.4;
  let weightAnomaly = 0.3;
  let weightTransaction = 0.15;
  let weightUserHistory = 0.15;

  // Dynamic weight adjustment (example)
  if (timeOfDay == "late_night") {
    weightAnomaly += 0.1;
    weightFraud -= 0.05;
  }

  if (transactionAmount > high_value_threshold) {
    weightFraud += 0.1;
  }

  //Calculate weighted sum
  let riskScore = (weightFraud * fraudCheckScore) + (weightAnomaly * anomalyScore) + (weightTransaction * transactionAmount) + (weightUserHistory * userHistoryScore);

  return riskScore;
}
```

**Novelty:** This design goes beyond static risk scores by integrating *behavioral biometrics* and *dynamic weight adjustments*. It allows for a more nuanced assessment of risk, reducing false positives and improving fraud detection rates.  The system *learns* user behavior and adapts to changing patterns, providing a more robust defense against fraud.
