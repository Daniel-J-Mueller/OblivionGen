## Adaptive Network Topology Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend node status monitoring to *actively* reconstruct and optimize network topology in real-time based on observed communication pathway health. Rather than simply reporting status, the system dynamically reroutes traffic and adjusts network configurations to maintain optimal performance and resilience.

**Specs:**

**1. Topology Mapping Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw status data from the existing monitoring system (node status scores, transmission indications, timestamps, endpoint pairings). Additionally, a baseline network topology map (static configuration).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Link Health Calculation:**  Assign a ‘health score’ to each logical link between nodes, derived from the historical and recent status data.  Weight recent data more heavily. (See weighting function below).
    *   **Topology Graph Construction:** Create a dynamic graph representation of the network. Nodes are network endpoints/nodes. Edges represent communication links. Edge weights are the calculated link health scores.
    *   **Path Determination:** Utilize a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra’s, A*) to determine optimal paths between source and destination endpoints. Paths are determined *dynamically* based on current link health.
*   **Output:**  A dynamic routing table containing optimized paths for all (or a subset of) traffic flows.

**2. Adaptive Routing Agent:**

*   **Input:**  Dynamic routing table from Topology Mapping Module. Network traffic flows.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Traffic Interception:** Intercept network traffic (e.g., via software-defined networking (SDN) controller, virtual switch).
    *   **Path Enforcement:** Redirect traffic along the paths specified in the routing table.
    *   **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor performance metrics (latency, throughput, packet loss) *along* the enforced paths.
*   **Output:**  Successfully delivered network traffic. Performance data for feedback loop.

**3. Feedback and Adaptation Loop:**

*   **Process:**
    *   **Performance Data Collection:** Aggregate performance data from the Adaptive Routing Agent.
    *   **Topology Update:** Feed performance data *back* into the Topology Mapping Module.  If a path consistently performs poorly, the module *decreases* the weight of links along that path, encouraging alternative routes.
    *   **Automated Configuration:**  The system automatically adjusts network configuration (e.g., firewall rules, routing protocols) to reflect the updated topology.

**Weighting Function (Example):**

`LinkHealth = α * RecentStatus + (1 - α) * HistoricalAverage`

Where:

*   `RecentStatus` is the status score from the most recent status request.
*   `HistoricalAverage` is the average status score over a defined period.
*   `α` is a weighting factor (0 < α < 1), prioritizing recent data. A decaying exponential may also be used for historical smoothing.

**Pseudocode (Topology Mapping Module - Path Determination):**

```
FUNCTION FindOptimalPath(source, destination, topologyGraph):
  // topologyGraph is a weighted graph representing network topology
  // using Dijkstra's Algorithm
  distances = {}
  previous = {}
  for each node in topologyGraph:
    distances[node] = INFINITY
    previous[node] = NULL

  distances[source] = 0

  unvisitedNodes = all nodes in topologyGraph

  WHILE unvisitedNodes is not empty:
    currentNode = node in unvisitedNodes with smallest distance

    IF currentNode == destination:
      BREAK

    unvisitedNodes.remove(currentNode)

    FOR each neighbor in neighbors(currentNode):
      altPath = distances[currentNode] + weight(currentNode, neighbor)
      IF altPath < distances[neighbor]:
        distances[neighbor] = altPath
        previous[neighbor] = currentNode

  // Reconstruct path
  path = []
  currentNode = destination
  WHILE currentNode != NULL:
    path.insert(0, currentNode)
    currentNode = previous[currentNode]

  RETURN path
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Fault Tolerance:** Implement mechanisms to handle failures of individual nodes or links.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle large-scale networks.
*   **Security:** Ensure that the dynamic routing adjustments do not introduce security vulnerabilities.
