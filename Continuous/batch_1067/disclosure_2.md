**Project: Dynamic Proximity-Based Skill Exchange Network**

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing contact/information sharing paradigm to facilitate spontaneous, localized skill exchange. Leverage proximity data (building on travel plan features) and user-defined skill profiles to connect individuals capable of mutually beneficial assistance *in real-time*.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Skill Profile Module:**
    *   Users create detailed skill profiles, categorizing proficiency levels (beginner, intermediate, expert) in various domains (e.g., plumbing, coding, language translation, first aid).
    *   Skills are tagged with availability windows (e.g., evenings, weekends, specific hours).
    *   A ‘Willingness to Trade’ metric defines how open a user is to offering skills in exchange for assistance (high, medium, low).

2.  **Proximity & Availability Engine:**
    *   Continuously monitors user locations (with opt-in permission) via mobile device GPS.
    *   Identifies other users within a configurable radius (e.g., 100m, 500m, 1km).
    *   Filters potential matches based on overlapping skill needs *and* availability windows.

3.  **Dynamic Request/Offer System:**
    *   Users can broadcast ‘Requests’ for specific skills (e.g., “Need help fixing a leaky faucet – willing to trade language tutoring”).
    *   The system automatically identifies potential ‘Offers’ from nearby users whose skills match the request *and* who have indicated a willingness to trade.
    *   A streamlined interface allows for quick acceptance/rejection of offers.

4.  **Reputation & Verification Layer:**
    *   Post-exchange, users provide ratings and reviews of each other’s skills and reliability.
    *   Integration with identity verification services (optional) to enhance trust.
    *   A ‘Skill Validation’ feature allows users to request confirmation of skill levels from other verified users.

5.  **AI-Powered Skill Matching:**
    *   Leverage AI to analyze user skill profiles and identify implicit skills or interests.
    *   Proactively suggest potential skill exchanges based on user activity and location.
    *   Dynamic refinement of skill categories based on emerging trends and user input.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION FindSkillMatches(userLocation, userSkills, radius):
  nearbyUsers = GetUsersWithinRadius(userLocation, radius)
  matches = []

  FOR each nearbyUser IN nearbyUsers:
    IF nearbyUser.skills INTERSECTS userSkills AND
       nearbyUser.availability OVERLAPS userAvailability AND
       nearbyUser.willingnessToTrade >= userDesiredWillingness:
      matches.append(nearbyUser)

  RETURN matches
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Mobile Application (iOS and Android)
*   Secure Backend Server (Cloud-Based)
*   Location Services Integration (GPS)
*   Database for User Profiles, Skills, and Ratings
*   AI/Machine Learning Engine for Skill Matching
*   Payment Gateway Integration (optional, for paid skills)
*   Real-time Communication Module (Chat/Video Call)

**Potential Applications:**

*   Local community support networks
*   Emergency assistance during disasters
*   Upskilling and lifelong learning
*   Freelance work/gig economy
*   Travel assistance/language exchange
