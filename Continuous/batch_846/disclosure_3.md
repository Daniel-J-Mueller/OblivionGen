## Dynamic Table Partitioning with Predictive Power Gating

**Concept:** Extend the power-saving approach of selectively powering down table entries/buckets by introducing *dynamic* partitioning of the data table based on access patterns *predicted* by a lightweight machine learning model. Instead of simply gating based on configuration, the table physically rearranges itself to minimize active power domains.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Table Structure:** The core data table remains a bucketed structure. However, each bucket isn’t fixed in size or location. Buckets can merge, split, or migrate within the memory space.
*   **Access Pattern Prediction Module:** A small, on-chip machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a Markov model) continuously monitors access patterns to the data table. This module predicts which buckets are likely to be accessed in the near future.  Prediction horizon configurable via register.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning Engine:** This engine physically rearranges the data table based on the predictions from the Access Pattern Prediction Module. 
    *   **Merging:**  Frequently co-accessed buckets are merged into a single, larger bucket.
    *   **Splitting:**  Large buckets with low co-access are split into smaller buckets.
    *   **Migration:** Buckets predicted to be heavily accessed are migrated to memory locations closer to the processing logic, reducing access latency.
*   **Power Domain Granularity:** Power domains are associated with individual *dynamic* buckets, not fixed buckets. This allows finer-grained power control.
*   **Power Gating Policy:**
    *   **Active Buckets:** Buckets predicted to be accessed within a short timeframe remain powered on.
    *   **Idle Buckets:** Buckets predicted to be idle for a longer timeframe are powered down.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Thresholds for power gating are dynamically adjusted based on system load and temperature.
*   **Hardware Implementation:**
    *   **Memory Controller Modifications:** The memory controller must support dynamic bucket relocation and power domain control.
    *   **Dedicated Hardware Accelerator:** A dedicated hardware accelerator can speed up the dynamic partitioning process.
*   **Configuration Registers:**
    *   **Prediction Horizon:** Configures the time window for access pattern prediction.
    *   **Partitioning Granularity:** Controls the minimum and maximum bucket size.
    *   **Power Gating Thresholds:** Sets the thresholds for power gating.
    *   **Migration Priority:** Assigns priority to different types of data.
    *   **Model Update Frequency**: Configures how often the access pattern prediction model is updated.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Partitioning Engine):**

```
function PartitionTable():
  access_predictions = GetAccessPredictions()
  bucket_access_scores = CalculateBucketAccessScores(access_predictions)

  // Merge Buckets
  for each pair of buckets (b1, b2):
    if (coaccess_score(b1, b2) > merge_threshold):
      merge_buckets(b1, b2)

  // Split Buckets
  for each bucket b:
    if (bucket_size(b) > split_threshold and internal_coaccess(b) < split_threshold):
      split_bucket(b)

  // Migrate Buckets
  for each bucket b:
    target_location = FindOptimalLocation(b) //Based on access frequency
    if (current_location != target_location):
      migrate_bucket(b, target_location)

  UpdatePowerDomains() //Apply power gating based on current bucket state
```

**Novelty:** This system isn’t simply about gating existing buckets; it’s about *physically rearranging* the table to optimize power consumption. The combination of dynamic partitioning, access pattern prediction, and fine-grained power domains represents a significant advance over static approaches.
