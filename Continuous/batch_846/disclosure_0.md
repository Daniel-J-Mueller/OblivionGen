## Dynamic Notification ‘Mood’ Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend notification scheduling beyond time slots to incorporate real-time user ‘mood’ detection via device sensors & behavioral analysis, and dynamically adjust notification *style* (not just content) accordingly.  The system learns individual user responses to different stylistic approaches during varied emotional states.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Access data from device sensors – accelerometer (activity level/stress), microphone (tone/speech analysis – stress/emotion), camera (facial expression analysis – basic emotion detection), screen interaction (swipe speed/pressure – frustration/engagement). Privacy-focused – all analysis happens on-device; only aggregated ‘mood’ state is transmitted.
*   **Mood State Classification:** On-device ML model classifies user ‘mood’ into discrete states (e.g., Calm, Focused, Stressed, Frustrated, Bored, Engaged).  Model continually learns/adapts to individual user baseline.
*   **Notification Style Library:**  Pre-defined notification ‘styles’ beyond basic text/icon:
    *   **Calm:**  Soft color palettes, minimalist icons, gentle animations.
    *   **Focused:**  Concise text, high-contrast visuals, direct information.
    *   **Stressed:**  Short, actionable alerts, clear prioritization, limited visuals.
    *   **Frustrated:**  Humorous/empathetic messaging (optional – user preference), simplified options, avoidance of complex requests.
    *   **Bored:**  Engaging visuals, interactive elements, ‘discovery’ focused content.
    *   **Engaged:**  Dynamic/animated notifications, rich media content, expanded options.
*   **Dynamic Scheduling Algorithm:**  Modified from patent's time-slot approach.  Algorithm considers:
    *   Time of day.
    *   User’s calendar events (context).
    *   Current mood state.
    *   Notification priority.
    *   Historical user response to various styles *in similar mood states*.
*   **A/B Testing Loop:** Continuously A/B test different notification styles within each mood state, measuring user engagement (open rate, click-through rate, task completion). Results feed back into the algorithm to optimize style selection.
*   **User Control:**  Allow users to customize preferred notification styles for each mood state, or disable the ‘mood adjustment’ feature entirely.  Granular control over data sharing for mood detection.
*    **Privacy Safeguards:** All analysis is performed on-device. Only the resulting *mood state* (a generalized category) is sent to the server.  Raw sensor data is never transmitted.

**Pseudocode (Scheduling Algorithm Snippet):**

```pseudocode
function scheduleNotification(notification, user) {

  currentTime = getCurrentTime()
  userMood = getUserMood(user)
  priority = notification.priority

  //Determine Time Slot based on User Profile & Time
  timeSlot = getTimeSlot(user, currentTime)

  //Select Notification Style based on Mood & Priority
  style = selectNotificationStyle(userMood, priority)

  //Adjust Notification Content based on Style
  adjustedContent = applyStyleToContent(notification.content, style)

  //Schedule Notification for Time Slot
  scheduleNotificationAt(adjustedContent, timeSlot)
}

function selectNotificationStyle(mood, priority) {
  if (mood == "Stressed" && priority == "High") {
    return "MinimalistAlert"
  } else if (mood == "Bored" && priority == "Low") {
    return "EngagingDiscovery"
  } else {
    //Default Style based on User Preference & System Defaults
    return getUserPreferredStyle(mood)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond simply *when* to notify, to *how* to notify, adapting the notification experience to the user's emotional state in real-time.  Combines sensor data, behavioral analysis, and A/B testing to create a truly personalized and context-aware notification system.  Addresses the potential for notification fatigue by proactively adjusting the notification experience to minimize disruption and maximize engagement.
