**Publication-Specific Style & Tone Analysis for ILD Prediction**

**I. Specification**

This innovation expands on intentional linguistic deviation (ILD) detection by incorporating a publication-specific style and tone analysis component. The core idea is that intentional misspellings aren't just about *what* is misspelled, but *how* it fits within the writing style and tonal characteristics of the publication or author.

**II. Components & Functionality**

1.  **Stylometric Feature Extraction:**
    *   **Lexical Diversity:** Measure of vocabulary richness (Type-Token Ratio, Herdan’s Ratio).
    *   **Syntactic Complexity:**  Average sentence length, number of subordinate clauses, passive voice ratio.
    *   **Readability Scores:** Flesch Reading Ease, Gunning Fog Index, SMOG Index.
    *   **N-gram Analysis:** Frequency of word and character n-grams to capture stylistic patterns.

2.  **Tone/Sentiment Analysis:**
    *   Employ pre-trained sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, BERT-based) to assess the overall sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of the publication.
    *   Identify key emotional keywords and phrases.
    *   Measure the intensity of emotional language.

3.  **Publication Profile Creation:**
    *   For each publication or author, create a stylistic and tonal profile by analyzing a corpus of their past work.
    *   Store this profile as a vector of features representing their unique writing characteristics.

4.  **ILD Deviation Scoring:**
    *   When a potential misspelling is detected, analyze the surrounding context to extract the same stylometric and tonal features.
    *   Calculate a “deviation score” by comparing the features of the context with the publication's profile.  A large deviation score suggests the misspelling might be intentional, as it deviates from the established style.
    *   Deviation Score =  ∑ |ContextFeatureᵢ - ProfileFeatureᵢ|  (Sum of absolute differences for each feature)

5.  **ILD Prediction Model Integration:**
    *   The deviation score is integrated into the existing ILD prediction model as an additional feature.
    *   The model learns to weigh the deviation score alongside other indicators to improve the accuracy of ILD detection.

**III. Pseudocode**

```
FUNCTION AnalyzePublication(publicationCorpus)
    features = ExtractStylometricFeatures(publicationCorpus)
    tone = AnalyzeSentiment(publicationCorpus)
    publicationProfile = [features, tone]
    RETURN publicationProfile

FUNCTION AnalyzeDeviation(newText, publicationProfile)
    context = ExtractContext(newText) // Surrounding text of potential misspelling
    deviationFeatures = ExtractStylometricFeatures(context)
    deviationScore = CalculateDeviationScore(deviationFeatures, publicationProfile)
    RETURN deviationScore

FUNCTION PredictILD(misspelling, deviationScore, existingIndicators)
    // Existing ILD Prediction Model
    modelInput = [existingIndicators, deviationScore]
    ildProbability = model(modelInput)
    RETURN ildProbability
```
