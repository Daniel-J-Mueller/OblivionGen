## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Echo Mapping

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple de-reverberation to *reconstruct* the acoustic environment, not just the speech signal. This enables applications beyond clearer speech – spatial audio rendering, virtual reality integration, and even forensic audio analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+) with known spatial arrangement. High-resolution ADC. Dedicated processing unit (GPU/FPGA preferred).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Calibration Phase:**
        *   Emits a swept sine wave or broadband noise from a known location.
        *   Records the signal at each microphone.
        *   Creates an “Echo Map” – a 3D spatial representation of impulse responses within the room.  This uses ray tracing to model reflections. Store this in a volumetric grid.
        *   Utilizes a Bayesian approach to handle uncertainty in impulse response estimation.
    *   **Real-time Processing:**
        *   Receives audio signal from microphone array.
        *   Performs time-delay estimation (TDE) using cross-correlation or generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) to identify primary sound source location.
        *   Locates the source within the pre-built Echo Map.
        *   **Temporal Echo Mapping (TEM):** This is the core innovation. Instead of attempting to *remove* reverb, TEM isolates individual echoes within the signal.
            *   Deconvolve the received signal using estimated impulse responses from the Echo Map for the identified source location.
            *   Apply a temporal gate to each identified echo, extracting its time-domain waveform. This creates a stream of ‘echo objects’ – each representing a distinct reflection.
        *   **Spatial Audio Synthesis:**
            *   Synthesize virtual sound sources at the locations of each extracted echo.
            *   Apply appropriate delays, gains, and equalization based on the original impulse response.
            *   Render the synthesized soundscape using HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) processing.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Volumetric grid representing the Echo Map (3D array of impulse responses).
    *   Echo Object: Data structure containing:
        *   Time of arrival
        *   Spatial coordinates (x, y, z)
        *   Amplitude
        *   Impulse Response snippet
*   **Pseudocode (TEM Core):**

```
function extract_echoes(received_signal, echo_map, source_location):
  impulses = echo_map.get_impulses_at(source_location)
  echoes = []
  for impulse in impulses:
    deconvolved_signal = deconvolve(received_signal, impulse) // Wiener filter or similar
    echo_snippet = extract_echo_snippet(deconvolved_signal, impulse.time_of_arrival) //Temporal gating/filtering
    echoes.append(echo_snippet)
  return echoes
```

**Refinement:**

*   **Dynamic Echo Map Updates:**  Implement a mechanism to dynamically update the Echo Map based on changes in the environment (e.g., moving furniture).  Could use SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques.
*   **Source Separation Integration:**  Combine TEM with source separation algorithms to isolate individual speakers *and* reconstruct the acoustic environment.
*   **Material Identification:** Analyze the characteristics of the extracted echoes to infer the materials present in the room (e.g., hardwood, carpet, curtains).
*   **Forensic Applications:** TEM could be used to analyze audio recordings of crimes to reconstruct the scene and identify potential evidence.
