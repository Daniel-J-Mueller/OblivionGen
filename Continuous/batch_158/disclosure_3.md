## Temporal Data Shadowing with Predictive Reversion

**Concept:** Extend version metadata beyond simple creation/deletion times to include *predicted* future states of data objects. This allows for recovery not just to a past point, but to a *potential* future that was deemed likely at a given time.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Shadowing Agent:** A background process operating on each data object. It monitors data modifications and, using lightweight AI (time series forecasting, recurrent neural networks), predicts the object’s state at configurable intervals (e.g., every hour, day, week) into the future.
*   **Prediction Metadata:** Each prediction is stored as metadata alongside version data. This metadata includes:
    *   *Prediction Timestamp:* When the prediction was generated.
    *   *Horizon:* How far into the future the prediction applies.
    *   *Confidence Score:* A value representing the AI’s confidence in the prediction.
    *   *Predicted State:* A diff or snapshot of the predicted data object state.
*   **Recovery Policy Engine:** Allows administrators to define recovery policies based on predicted states. Examples:
    *   “If a data object’s predicted state shows a critical error within 24 hours, revert to the last predicted state with a confidence score above 90%.”
    *   “Automatically create a ‘safety net’ version based on the highest confidence prediction for the next week.”
*   **User Interface Enhancement:** Integrate a "Potential Futures" view into the existing GUI, displaying available predicted states for a selected data object with confidence scores and diffs.  Allow users to preview and select a predicted state for recovery.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Support pluggable prediction algorithms. Offer a range of algorithms from simple linear extrapolation to complex deep learning models, allowing administrators to choose the best fit for their data and performance requirements.

**Pseudocode (Recovery Process):**

```
function recover_data_object(object_id, target_time):
  // 1. Check for exact version match at target_time
  version = find_version(object_id, target_time)
  if version:
    return version.data

  // 2. Find closest prediction to target_time
  predictions = get_predictions(object_id, target_time)
  if predictions:
    best_prediction = select_best_prediction(predictions, target_time)  //Based on confidence & time proximity

    // Option to prompt user for confirmation before applying prediction
    if (user_confirms_prediction(best_prediction)):
        return best_prediction.predicted_data
    else:
        return error("Recovery cancelled")

  // 3. Fallback to standard version-based recovery
  return standard_version_recovery(object_id, target_time)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Proactive Error Prevention:** Recover from potential failures *before* they happen.
*   **Data Drift Mitigation:**  Prevent data corruption caused by unintended changes.
*   **Scenario Planning:**  Recover to a predicted state based on specific business scenarios.
*   **Improved Disaster Recovery:** Recover to a more accurate and up-to-date state after a disaster.
