**Dynamic Rule Generation via Generative AI & Physical Interaction Feedback**

**Core Concept:** Augment the existing rule-based system with a generative AI model that *learns* and refines rules based on user interaction with the augmented environment. This moves beyond static rule sets to a dynamic, adaptable system.

**Specs:**

*   **AI Model:** Utilize a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on a dataset of physical environments, object placements, and user feedback. The model learns to predict ‘plausible’ object placements given environmental context.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate depth sensors (LiDAR, time-of-flight) and IMUs into AR/VR devices. These capture real-time data about the user’s physical environment *and* their interaction with the augmented scene (e.g., reaching for a virtually placed object, walking around it).
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a multi-tiered feedback system:
    *   **Implicit Feedback:** Track user gaze, head movements, and body pose.  If the user consistently *avoids* a virtually placed object, that signals a negative preference.
    *   **Explicit Feedback:**  A simple "thumbs up/thumbs down" or sliding scale interface within the AR/VR experience allows users to directly rate object placements.
    *   **Collision Detection:**  Real-time collision detection between the user’s physical body and virtual objects provides strong negative feedback.
*   **Rule Refinement Loop:**
    1.  The AI model predicts a set of plausible object placements based on the current environment.
    2.  The system displays the top N predictions (perhaps with a low opacity to indicate ‘suggestion’).
    3.  The user interacts with the environment.
    4.  The feedback mechanism captures user preferences and interactions.
    5.  The AI model is retrained *in real-time* using the new feedback data.  This refines the rule set.
    6.  The cycle repeats.
*   **Rule Encoding:**  Rules are *not* stored as hardcoded “if/then” statements. Instead, they are represented as latent vectors within the AI model. This allows for more nuanced and adaptable rules.  A ‘rule extraction’ module can analyze these latent vectors to provide human-readable explanations of the learned rules (e.g., “objects are typically placed at least 1 meter away from doorways”).
*   **Multi-User Learning:** Aggregate feedback data from multiple users to create a shared, evolving rule set. This enables the system to learn best practices and cultural norms for object placement.

**Pseudocode (Rule Refinement):**

```
function refineRules(environmentData, userFeedback):
  # environmentData: Depth map, object detections, context information
  # userFeedback: Gaze data, body pose, explicit ratings, collision events

  # 1. Predict plausible placements using AI model
  placements = aiModel.predict(environmentData)

  # 2. Calculate a "reward" score for each placement based on user feedback
  reward = calculateReward(placements, userFeedback)

  # 3. Update AI model weights using reinforcement learning (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization)
  aiModel.update(reward)

  # 4. Extract human-readable rules from AI model (optional)
  rules = ruleExtractionModule.extract(aiModel)

  return rules
```

This system creates a continuously learning augmented reality experience, far exceeding the limitations of static, pre-defined rules. It adapts to individual preferences, learns from collective behavior, and ultimately creates a more natural and intuitive AR experience.
