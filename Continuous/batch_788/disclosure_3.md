## Dynamic Communication Context Profiles & Predictive Blocking

**Concept:** Extend the contextual awareness beyond vehicle/motion status to encompass *predictive* communication blocking based on learned user behavior and environmental factors. The system builds dynamic profiles associating contexts not just with *prohibition*, but with *predicted preference* for communication type (audio, video, text, silent).

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Second-order contextual data: beyond vehicle state, integrate data from wearable sensors (heart rate, stress levels), calendar appointments, location history, frequently contacted parties, time of day, ambient noise levels (detected via device microphones), and even social media activity (with user permission).
    *   User Feedback Loop: Implement explicit (ratings, thumbs up/down) and implicit (communication acceptance/rejection, duration of call, etc.) feedback mechanisms to refine preference predictions.
*   **Profile Generation:**
    *   Contextual Clustering: Employ machine learning (e.g., k-means, neural networks) to cluster contextual data points into "communication scenarios."
    *   Preference Mapping: Within each scenario, map preferred communication types (audio, video, text, silent) based on historical user behavior.  Assign confidence levels to these preferences.
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: Continuous updating of profiles based on new data. Introduce decay factors to reduce the influence of older data.
*   **Predictive Blocking/Routing:**
    *   Prior to establishing a communication session, the system assesses the current context and predicts the user’s preferred communication type.
    *   If the incoming communication type doesn't match the predicted preference:
        *   **Soft Block:** Route the communication to a different channel (e.g., text instead of voice).
        *   **Delayed Notification:** Delay notification of the communication until a more appropriate context is detected.
        *   **Intelligent Filtering:** Apply rules based on the caller ID – allowing certain contacts to bypass blocking rules or prioritize specific communication channels.
        *   **Context-Aware Prompts:**  Present the user with options: "Caller X is trying to reach you via video.  You’re currently in a meeting – would you like to accept as audio, text, or snooze?"
*   **API Integration:**
    *   Open API for third-party applications to access contextual data and contribute to profile generation (e.g., fitness trackers, smart home devices).
*   **Privacy Controls:**
    *   Granular user controls to manage data sharing and profile generation.  Options to opt out of specific data collection or disable contextual blocking entirely.



**Pseudocode (Predictive Blocking Logic):**

```
function determineCommunicationAction(incomingCall, userContext) {

  predictedPreference = getPredictedPreference(userContext);

  if (incomingCall.type == predictedPreference.type) {
    // Direct connection
    establishConnection(incomingCall);
    return;
  }

  if (predictedPreference.type == "silent") {
    // Suppress notification, log attempt
    logCommunicationAttempt(incomingCall, "suppressed");
    return;
  }

  if (incomingCall.type == "video" && predictedPreference.type == "audio") {
    // Prompt user to switch to audio
    displayPrompt("Incoming video call. Switch to audio?");
    // If user accepts, establish audio connection
  }

  if (incomingCall.type != predictedPreference.type) {
    // Route to alternate channel if available (text, voicemail)
    routeToAlternateChannel(incomingCall, predictedPreference.type);
  }
}

function getPredictedPreference(userContext) {
  // Query machine learning model with userContext data
  predictedPreference = mlModel.predict(userContext);
  return predictedPreference;
}
```
