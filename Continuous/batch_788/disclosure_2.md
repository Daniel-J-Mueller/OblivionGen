## Adaptive Snapshotting with Predictive Pruning

**Concept:** Extend the snapshotting mechanism to proactively identify and prune log records *before* they become candidates for garbage collection, based on predicted future data access patterns. This moves beyond reactive garbage collection triggered by snapshot creation to a more intelligent, predictive system.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Access Pattern Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical query logs, application workload data, data access metadata (timestamps, data pages accessed).
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict the probability of future access to specific data pages within a defined time window.  The model should incorporate seasonality (daily/weekly/monthly) and trend analysis.
*   **Output:**  A "heat map" of data page access probabilities, expressed as a score between 0 and 1 for each data page, representing the likelihood of access within the prediction window (configurable duration).

**2. Adaptive Snapshotting Engine:**

*   **Integration:** Integrate with the existing log-structured storage system.
*   **Snapshot Trigger:** Snapshots are initiated via API request (as in the existing patent).
*   **Log Record Evaluation:** Upon snapshot creation request:
    *   Access the Data Access Pattern Prediction Module to obtain access probabilities for all data pages affected by the log records since the last snapshot.
    *   Assign a "retention score" to each log record based on the access probabilities of the data pages it modifies.  A higher access probability contributes to a higher retention score.  The scoring function is configurable, allowing for fine-tuning of the retention policy.  Example:  `retention_score = sum(access_probabilities for page in affected_pages)`.
*   **Pruning Threshold:** A configurable pruning threshold determines which log records are eligible for immediate deletion. Log records with a retention score below the threshold are marked for deletion.
*   **Metadata Enhancement:**  Extend the existing metadata to include:
    *   `retention_score`: The retention score assigned to each log record.
    *   `pruned`: A boolean flag indicating whether the log record has been pruned.

**3. Background Pruning Process:**

*   **Continuous Monitoring:** A background process continuously monitors log records and their retention scores.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The retention scores are recalculated periodically (e.g., hourly) based on updated data access patterns.
*   **Proactive Deletion:** Log records with retention scores consistently below the pruning threshold are deleted.

**Pseudocode (Snapshot Creation):**

```
function CreateSnapshot(snapshot_id):
  // 1. Get affected log records since last snapshot
  affected_log_records = GetAffectedLogRecords(last_snapshot_id)

  // 2. Calculate retention scores for each log record
  for each log_record in affected_log_records:
    access_probabilities = GetAccessProbabilities(log_record.affected_pages)
    log_record.retention_score = sum(access_probabilities)

  // 3. Identify log records for pruning
  pruned_log_records = []
  for each log_record in affected_log_records:
    if log_record.retention_score < pruning_threshold:
      pruned_log_records.append(log_record)
      log_record.pruned = True //Mark as pruned

  // 4. Generate metadata (as in the existing patent, enhanced with retention_score and pruned flags)
  metadata = GenerateSnapshotMetadata(affected_log_records)

  // 5. Return snapshot ID and metadata
  return snapshot_id, metadata
```

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced storage overhead by proactively deleting unnecessary log records.
*   Improved performance by reducing the number of log records that need to be scanned during snapshot creation and restoration.
*   Adaptive retention policies that align with actual data access patterns.
*   Potential for cost savings in cloud environments where storage is billed based on usage.
