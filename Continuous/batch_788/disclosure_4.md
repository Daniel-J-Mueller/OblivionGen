## Dynamic Focal Plane Adjustment via Micro-Lens Array & AI Prediction

**Core Concept:** Implement a dynamically adjustable focal plane within the stereo camera system, not through physical lens movement, but by controlling a micro-lens array positioned *before* the image sensors.  Combine this with AI-driven depth prediction to proactively adjust the array for optimal focus *before* capture, especially for rapidly approaching or receding objects.

**Specifications:**

*   **Micro-Lens Array (MLA):**
    *   Resolution: 500x500 micro-lenses (minimum).  Each lens individually addressable.
    *   Material: Transparent polymer with controllable refractive index (e.g., via electro-wetting or liquid crystal technology).
    *   Actuation:  Individual MEMS-based actuators beneath each micro-lens to finely control its shape/refractive index.
    *   Response Time: < 1ms per micro-lens.
    *   Power Consumption:  < 10mW per micro-lens (average).
*   **Depth Prediction AI:**
    *   Model: Real-time instance segmentation and depth estimation network (e.g., Mask R-CNN with depth prediction head). Trained on diverse datasets of common objects and environments.
    *   Input: Continuous video stream from both cameras.
    *   Output: Per-pixel depth map and object segmentation masks. Confidence scores for each prediction.
    *   Processing: Dedicated onboard AI accelerator (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson or equivalent).
*   **Control System:**
    *   Algorithm: Predictive focusing algorithm.
        1.  AI predicts depth map & object segmentation.
        2.  Identify objects of interest (based on user selection or pre-defined criteria).
        3.  Calculate optimal MLA configuration to bring the object into sharp focus for *both* cameras.
        4.  Apply configuration to MLA.
        5.  Repeat in real-time.
    *   Feedback Loop: Monitor image sharpness (e.g., using Laplacian variance) and refine MLA configuration as needed.
    *   Communication: High-speed data link between AI accelerator, control system, and MLA driver circuitry.

**Pseudocode (Focus Adjustment Loop):**

```
LOOP:
  capture_stereo_images()
  depth_map, segmentation_masks = predict_depth_and_segment(stereo_images)

  FOR each object in segmentation_masks:
    distance = depth_map[object.bounding_box]  // Average depth within object's bounding box
    focal_length = camera.focal_length
    lens_adjustment = (focal_length * distance) / object_size //Initial approximation
    //refine lens_adjustment based on object position
    // refine lens_adjustment based on historical data of the object
    // refine lens_adjustment based on user settings.

    FOR each micro_lens in MLA_grid:
      IF micro_lens corresponds to object location in image:
        adjust_micro_lens(micro_lens, lens_adjustment)

  evaluate_image_sharpness() //Monitor sharpness and make fine adjustments.
  ENDLOOP
```

**Hardware Integration:**

*   MLA positioned directly in front of camera sensors.
*   Dedicated PCB for MLA driver circuitry and power regulation.
*   Thermal management system to dissipate heat from MLA and AI accelerator.
*   Enclosure designed to protect MLA from dust and moisture.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Autonomous navigation.
*   Robotics.
*   Augmented reality.
*   3D scanning.
*   High-speed photography.
