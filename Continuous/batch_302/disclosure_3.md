## Adaptive Bio-Resonance Wearable

**Concept:** A wearable device that subtly alters its physical form and emitted frequencies to resonate with the user's individual bio-signatures, enhancing well-being and potentially impacting mood/cognitive state. This goes beyond simple biofeedback; it *actively* attempts to harmonize with the wearer.

**Specs:**

*   **Core:** Flexible substrate composed of shape-memory polymers and embedded micro-actuators.  Actuators are piezoelectric, allowing for rapid, subtle form changes.
*   **Sensors:** Multi-modal sensor array including:
    *   Electrocardiogram (ECG) – continuous heart rate variability monitoring.
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) – measures sweat gland activity as a proxy for emotional arousal.
    *   Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) – monitors cerebral blood flow for cognitive state assessment.
    *   Micro-vibration sensors – capture subtle muscle tension/tremors.
*   **Resonance Engine (Software):**
    *   **Bio-Signature Acquisition:** Real-time data stream from all sensors.
    *   **Harmonic Analysis:**  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and wavelet analysis to identify dominant frequencies and patterns in the bio-signature data.  Focus on identifying resonant frequencies *specific* to the individual (not pre-programmed averages).
    *   **Actuation Mapping:**  Algorithm that translates analyzed frequencies into specific commands for the micro-actuators. The device *physically* shifts into a conformation designed to amplify or dampen these frequencies.
    *   **Frequency Emission:** Embedded micro-speakers capable of emitting ultra-low frequency (ULF) and binaural beats tailored to the individual's analyzed bio-signature.  These frequencies will be overlaid onto the physical resonance of the device.
*   **Form Factor:**  Modular band.  Core unit with interchangeable sections – different materials (varying densities/textures) for different resonant properties. Attachment via flexible bio-compatible adhesive.
*   **Power:**  Kinetic energy harvesting (motion) + inductive charging.

**Pseudocode (Resonance Engine – Simplified):**

```
// Data Input: ECG, EDA, NIRS, Vibration data (time-series)

FUNCTION analyzeBioSignature(data) {
  // FFT and Wavelet Analysis
  frequencySpectrum = FFT(data)
  waveletDecomposition = Wavelet(data)

  // Identify Dominant Frequencies
  dominantFrequencies = findPeaks(frequencySpectrum, threshold)
  individualResonanceProfile = buildProfile(dominantFrequencies, waveletDecomposition)

  RETURN individualResonanceProfile
}

FUNCTION calculateActuation(resonanceProfile) {
  actuationMap = {}

  FOR each frequency IN resonanceProfile {
    amplitude = frequency.amplitude
    // Mapping function – translates frequency amplitude into actuator commands
    actuatorCommand = mapFrequencyToActuator(frequency, amplitude)
    actuationMap[actuatorCommand.actuatorID] = actuatorCommand.position
  }
  RETURN actuationMap
}

FUNCTION emitFrequency(frequency) {
  // ULF/Binaural Beat Emission
  speaker.play(frequency)
}

// Main Loop
WHILE(deviceOn) {
  bioData = collectSensorData()
  resonanceProfile = analyzeBioSignature(bioData)
  actuationMap = calculateActuation(resonanceProfile)
  applyActuation(actuationMap)
  emitFrequency(resonanceProfile.dominantFrequency)
  delay(0.1 seconds)
}
```

**Potential Materials:**

*   Shape-Memory Alloys (Nitinol) - for larger, more pronounced form changes.
*   Conductive Polymers - for embedded heating elements (affecting skin temperature/conductivity).
*   Bio-compatible Hydrogels - for optimal skin contact and sensor performance.
