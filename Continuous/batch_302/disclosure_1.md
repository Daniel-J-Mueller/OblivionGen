# D1018630

## Camouflaged Acoustic Sensor Network – “Chameleon Ears”

**Concept:** Integrate the security camera form factor with a distributed acoustic sensor array, camouflaged to mimic natural elements. The camera housing isn't *just* a housing – it’s the central node of a network of miniature, bio-mimicking acoustic sensors.

**Specifications:**

*   **Central Node (Camera Housing):**
    *   Dimensions: Maintain approximate size/shape of existing D1018630.
    *   Material:  Bio-degradable polymer composite (PLA/PHA blend) with embedded fractal patterns for light diffusion and acoustic transparency. Color-shifting pigment based on environmental temperature.
    *   Camera: Standard HD/4K camera module integrated.
    *   Microprocessor: Low-power ARM Cortex-M7 processor.
    *   Communication: Wi-Fi 6E / Bluetooth 5.3.
    *   Power: Solar panel integration on top surface + internal rechargeable battery.

*   **Satellite Nodes (Acoustic Sensors):**
    *   Form Factor:  Small, leaf-shaped or pebble-shaped bio-mimicking units (approx. 2-5cm diameter).  Made from the same biodegradable polymer composite.
    *   Acoustic Sensor: MEMS microphone array (4-8 mics per node) with directional sensitivity.
    *   Communication: Ultra-wideband (UWB) for short-range, low-power communication with central node.  Range: up to 30 meters.
    *   Power: Kinetic energy harvesting (vibration from wind/movement) + miniature solar cells integrated into ‘leaf’ surface.
    *   Deployment: Nodes are scattered around the perimeter of the monitored area, camouflaged within foliage, rocks, or other natural features.  Wireless mesh network self-organizes.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Acoustic Event Detection:**  AI-powered sound classification (gunshots, breaking glass, human voices, animal sounds, vehicle engines).  Noise filtering and source localization algorithms.
    *   **Sensor Fusion:**  Combine visual data from the camera with acoustic data from the satellite nodes.  Improved accuracy and reduced false alarms.
    *   **Adaptive Camouflage:**  System analyzes surrounding environment (color, texture, lighting) and adjusts the color-shifting pigment in the central node and satellite nodes to blend in seamlessly.
    *   **Network Management:**  Self-healing mesh network. Nodes automatically reconnect if communication is disrupted.  Remote monitoring and configuration via mobile app or web interface.

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Event Detection):**

```
function analyze_sound(sound_data, node_location):
    # Apply FFT to sound_data to extract frequency spectrum
    spectrum = FFT(sound_data)

    # Feature extraction:  Calculate energy in different frequency bands
    features = extract_features(spectrum)

    # Load pre-trained AI model for sound classification
    model = load_model("sound_classification_model.h5")

    # Predict sound event
    prediction = model.predict([features])

    # If prediction confidence is high enough
    if prediction.confidence > threshold:
        event_type = prediction.event_type
        # Calculate direction of sound source based on node locations and sound arrival times
        direction = calculate_direction(node_location, sound_arrival_times)
        # Return event type and direction
        return event_type, direction
    else:
        return "unknown", "unknown"
```

**Novelty:**  Combines visual surveillance with a distributed, camouflaged acoustic sensor network.  The bio-mimicry and energy harvesting aspects contribute to a more discreet and sustainable security solution.  Emphasis on environmental blending rather than overt detection.
