## Dynamic Resource Grafting

**Concept:** Extend the dependency-aware deletion process to *live* stacks, enabling dynamic resource migration and 'grafting' between stacks without full deletion/re-provisioning. This addresses scenarios where resource ownership or association needs to change mid-operation, or where resources need to be seamlessly moved to different environments (e.g., scaling up/down, disaster recovery).

**Specifications:**

**1. Graft Interface:**

*   **Function:** `GraftResource(sourceStackID, targetStackID, resourceName, newParameters)`
*   **Inputs:**
    *   `sourceStackID`: ID of the stack containing the resource to be moved.
    *   `targetStackID`: ID of the stack the resource will be moved to.  Can be a new stack or an existing one.
    *   `resourceName`:  Name of the resource within the source stack to be moved.
    *   `newParameters`:  A dictionary of parameters to apply to the resource in the target stack. Allows for reconfiguration during the move.
*   **Output:** Success/Failure indicator, Error message (if applicable).

**2. Dependency Resolution Enhancement:**

*   Modify the dependency parser to identify *external* dependencies – dependencies between resources in *different* stacks. This is crucial for coordinating the graft process.
*   Augment the dependency graph with 'graftability' flags per resource. Some resources might be inherently un-graftable (e.g., due to state or licensing restrictions).

**3. Graft Execution Workflow:**

1.  **Validation:** Verify the graftability of the resource, and check for conflicting configurations between source and target stacks.
2.  **Pre-Graft Hooks (Source Stack):** Execute any necessary shutdown or data preservation hooks on the source stack resource.
3.  **State Transfer:** Based on resource type, perform a state transfer. This may involve:
    *   Data replication (databases)
    *   Session migration (load balancers)
    *   Snapshotting (volumes)
4.  **Resource Detachment (Source Stack):** Remove the resource from the source stack’s configuration.  The resource remains *running* but is no longer managed by the source stack.
5.  **Resource Attachment (Target Stack):** Add the resource to the target stack’s configuration, applying the `newParameters`.
6.  **Post-Graft Hooks (Target Stack):** Execute any necessary initialization or activation hooks on the target stack resource.
7.  **Verification:** Validate the successful transfer of state and functionality.
8.  **Update Dependency Graphs:** Update the dependency graphs of both stacks to reflect the change.

**4. Resource Types and Grafting Strategies:**

*   **Stateless:** Simply reconfigure the resource to point to the target stack.
*   **Stateful (Databases):** Implement asynchronous replication and failover.
*   **Load Balancers:** Update routing rules to direct traffic to the new resource.
*   **Volumes:** Implement snapshot-based migration or live volume replication.

**5. Pseudocode – `GraftResource` function:**

```pseudocode
function GraftResource(sourceStackID, targetStackID, resourceName, newParameters):
  dependencyGraph = GetDependencyGraph()
  resource = GetResource(sourceStackID, resourceName)

  if not resource.graftable:
    return Failure, "Resource not graftable"

  sourceDependencies = dependencyGraph.get_dependencies(resource)
  targetDependencies = dependencyGraph.get_dependencies(resource)

  //Validate dependencies - ensure target stack can handle dependencies

  //Execute Pre-Graft Hooks on source
  execute_pre_graft_hooks(resource)

  //Perform State Transfer (resource-specific)
  transfer_state(resource, sourceStackID, targetStackID)

  //Detach from source stack
  detach_from_stack(resource, sourceStackID)

  //Attach to target stack, applying newParameters
  attach_to_stack(resource, targetStackID, newParameters)

  //Execute Post-Graft Hooks on target
  execute_post_graft_hooks(resource)

  //Update Dependency Graphs
  update_dependency_graphs(sourceStackID, targetStackID, resource)

  return Success, "Resource grafted successfully"
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Flexibility:** Enables dynamic reconfiguration of infrastructure without downtime.
*   **Improved Resource Utilization:**  Allows resources to be seamlessly moved between applications and environments.
*   **Simplified Management:** Reduces the need for complex orchestration and redeployment procedures.
*   **Enhanced Disaster Recovery:** Facilitates rapid failover and recovery by allowing resources to be migrated to backup environments.
