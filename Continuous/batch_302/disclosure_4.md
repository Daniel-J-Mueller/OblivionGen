## Adaptive Session Resume with Predictive Content Prefetch

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the scope of resumed sessions based on inferred user intent and proactively prefetching content to minimize perceived latency.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely resuming the *last* visited product page, the system analyzes session data (time spent on pages, scroll depth, added-to-cart events, search queries) to infer a broader user “focus” during the original session. It then presents a curated set of related product pages *alongside* the last visited page, allowing the user to quickly jump to other areas of interest. Crucially, content for these predicted pages is pre-fetched in the background.

**Components:**

*   **Session Analyzer:**  A module responsible for processing historical session data.  It generates a "focus vector" representing the user’s likely areas of interest. This vector assigns weights to product categories, brands, price ranges, etc., based on engagement metrics.
*   **Prediction Engine:**  Utilizes the focus vector to identify a set of *N* most relevant product pages.  This engine can leverage collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach. A configurable "diversity parameter" prevents the selection of overly similar pages.
*   **Prefetch Manager:**  Proactively fetches content (images, descriptions, pricing) for the predicted pages *before* the user explicitly requests them.  This is done in the background, utilizing available network bandwidth. Prefetch requests are prioritized based on predicted user interaction probability.
*   **Resume UI Component:** Displays a carousel or grid of predicted product pages alongside the last visited page. Each page is visually represented with a thumbnail and brief description.  A "resume" button initiates the loading of the full page.
*   **Contextual Filtering:**  Filters predicted pages based on current device capabilities (screen size, processing power), network connectivity, and user preferences (e.g., location, language).

**Pseudocode (Resume UI Component):**

```
function displayResumeOptions(sessionData, predictedPages) {
  // Display last visited page thumbnail + "Resume" button
  displayPage(sessionData.lastVisitedPage, "Resume")

  // Create carousel/grid for predicted pages
  carousel = new Carousel()

  for (page in predictedPages) {
    thumbnail = generateThumbnail(page.imageUrl)
    description = page.shortDescription
    button = createButton(page.url, thumbnail, description)
    carousel.addButton(button)
  }

  // Render carousel below "Resume" button
  renderCarousel(carousel)
}

function generateThumbnail(imageUrl) {
  // Fetch image data
  // Resize image to thumbnail dimensions
  // Return thumbnail image data
}

function createButton(url, thumbnail, description) {
  // Create button element
  // Set button URL to 'url'
  // Set button image to 'thumbnail'
  // Set button text to 'description'
  // Return button element
}

function renderCarousel(carousel) {
  // Display carousel on screen
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **SessionData:** {lastVisitedPage: URL, focusVector: [categoryWeight1, categoryWeight2…]}
*   **PredictedPage:** {url: URL, imageUrl: URL, shortDescription: String}
*   **FocusVector:** Array of floating-point numbers representing category weights.

**Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** Ensure user data is handled responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be able to handle a large number of concurrent sessions.
*   **Resource Management:**  Prefetching should be done intelligently to avoid excessive bandwidth consumption and server load.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the prediction algorithm and UI design through A/B testing.
