**Dynamic Research Note ‘Ecosystem’ with Simulated User Profiles**

**Concept:** Expand the research note functionality into a simulated ecosystem where AI-driven ‘user profiles’ interact with research notes, providing dynamically generated comparative insights and ‘what-if’ scenarios.

**Specs:**

*   **Simulated User Profiles:** Generate diverse user profiles based on demographic data, purchase history (if available - opt-in), and stated preferences.  Each profile possesses a weighted ‘factor importance’ matrix (like in the patent), but also incorporates ‘brand affinity’, ‘price sensitivity’, and ‘feature preference’ scores.
*   **Note ‘Seeding’:**  Allow ‘seeding’ of research notes with initial data from product specifications, expert reviews (parsed from web sources), and competitor analysis.
*   **AI-Driven Comparison Generation:**  The system will use the simulated user profiles to ‘read’ existing research notes and *generate* additional comparative points. For example:  "Based on a user valuing 'battery life' and 'portability', this laptop excels, but the other prioritizes 'screen size' and 'processing power.'"  These generated comparisons are visually distinct from user-authored content.
*   **‘What-If’ Scenario Engine:**  Users can modify the ‘factor weights’ of a simulated user profile and instantly see how the ‘top picks’ shift within existing research notes. This allows exploration of how different priorities impact decisions.
*   **‘Ecosystem’ Visualization:** Display research notes as nodes in a connected graph, with links representing shared items or factors.  The strength of the link represents the frequency of co-comparison.  Allow filtering and exploration of this graph.
*   **Dynamic Factor Discovery:**  The system will monitor user-generated comparisons and suggest new factors to add to the comparison framework.  It uses natural language processing to identify recurring themes in user text.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function GenerateAIComparison(researchNote, userProfile):
  // Extract item data, factor data, comparative data from researchNote
  items = researchNote.getItems()
  factors = researchNote.getFactors()

  // Calculate scores for each item based on userProfile's factor weights
  itemScores = {}
  for item in items:
    score = 0
    for factor in factors:
      score += item.getValue(factor) * userProfile.getFactorWeight(factor)
    itemScores[item] = score

  // Identify top-scoring item
  topItem = max(itemScores, key=itemScores.get)

  // Generate comparative text
  comparisonText = "Based on a user prioritizing " + userProfile.getTopPriority() + ", " + topItem.getName() + " is the strongest contender. However, alternatives prioritize " + userProfile.getSecondPriority() + "."

  return comparisonText

function UpdateEcosystemGraph(researchNote):
  // Extract items from researchNote
  items = researchNote.getItems()

  // For each pair of items:
  for i in range(len(items)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(items)):
      item1 = items[i]
      item2 = items[j]

      // Increment link weight between item1 and item2 in the ecosystem graph
      ecosystemGraph.incrementLinkWeight(item1, item2)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational power for AI processing and graph visualization.
*   Utilizes NLP libraries for factor discovery and text generation.
*   Graph database for storing and querying the ecosystem graph.
*   Scalable cloud infrastructure.
