## Dynamic Computation Graph Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the event handler system to manage and optimize dynamically generated computation graphs. Instead of predefined computations triggered by data arrival, the system constructs graphs on-the-fly based on data characteristics and system load, distributing graph components across event handlers.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Graph Definition Language (GDL):** A lightweight, declarative language to define computation graphs.  Nodes represent computations, edges represent data flow, and node properties specify resource requirements (CPU, memory, GPU).  Example:

    ```gdL
    graph image_processing {
      node resize {
        type: "image_resize"
        width: 1024
        height: 768
        resources: { cpu: 2, memory: 1GB }
      }
      node denoise {
        type: "image_denoise"
        algorithm: "wavelet"
        resources: { gpu: 1, memory: 2GB }
      }
      edge input -> resize -> denoise -> output
    }
    ```

2.  **Graph Compiler & Scheduler:** A service responsible for:
    *   Parsing GDL definitions.
    *   Optimizing graph structure (e.g., common subexpression elimination, operation fusion).
    *   Scheduling graph nodes onto available event handlers based on resource availability and data dependencies.
    *   Generating execution plans for event handlers.

3.  **Event Handler Adaptability:** Event handlers must be capable of:
    *   Dynamically loading and executing computations specified in the execution plan.
    *   Receiving data from other event handlers (via the storage system).
    *   Returning results to other event handlers (via the storage system).
    *   Reporting resource usage and execution status.

4.  **Data Dependency Tracking:** The system needs a mechanism to track data dependencies between graph nodes. This can be achieved using a distributed hash table (DHT) where each data object is associated with the nodes that produce it and the nodes that consume it.

5.  **Dynamic Graph Construction API:** An API that allows applications to:
    *   Define computation graphs using the GDL.
    *   Submit graphs to the Graph Compiler & Scheduler.
    *   Retrieve results from the graph.

**Pseudocode (Graph Compiler & Scheduler):**

```
function compile_and_schedule_graph(graph_definition):
  graph = parse_graph_definition(graph_definition)
  optimized_graph = optimize_graph(graph)
  execution_plan = create_execution_plan(optimized_graph)

  for node in execution_plan:
    available_handler = find_available_handler(node.resource_requirements)
    if available_handler:
      deploy_computation(available_handler, node.computation)
      schedule_node_execution(available_handler, node)
    else:
      # Handle resource contention (e.g., queue node for later execution)
      queue_node_for_execution(node)

  return execution_plan
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond statically defined computations to a system that can adapt to changing workloads and data characteristics. Enables complex, data-driven pipelines where the computation graph itself is dynamic, creating a more flexible and efficient processing environment. The storage system acts as a communication fabric *and* a state manager for the graph, allowing for robust fault tolerance and scalability.
