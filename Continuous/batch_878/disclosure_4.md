## Dynamic Key Derivation via Biometric Attestation & Hardware Root of Trust

**Specification:** Implement a system where cryptographic keys aren't *transmitted* to physical nodes, but *derived* on-demand, authenticated by biometric data and secured by a Hardware Root of Trust (HRoT). This moves away from key distribution and towards ephemeral key generation, significantly boosting security and reducing attack surfaces.

**Components:**

*   **HRoT Module (Physical Node):**  A tamper-resistant module (e.g., TPM 2.0 or equivalent secure enclave) capable of attestation and secure key storage (key *material*, not the full key).
*   **Biometric Scanner (Physical Node):** Integrated biometric scanner (fingerprint, iris, facial recognition).  Data is *not* stored; it's used for a one-time challenge/response.
*   **Attestation Server:**  Central server responsible for verifying node identity and authorizing key derivation.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):** A robust KDF (e.g., HKDF with SHA-512) used to generate the session key.
*   **Virtual Network Manager:**  Software controlling the virtual network and interfacing with the Attestation Server.

**Process Flow:**

1.  **Node Boot & Attestation Request:**  Upon boot, the physical node initiates an attestation request to the Attestation Server. This request includes a cryptographic nonce generated by the HRoT.

2.  **Biometric Challenge:** The Attestation Server responds with a biometric challenge. This is a random number or pattern that the node must incorporate into the biometric scan.

3.  **Biometric Scan & Challenge Response:** The physical node prompts a user (or authorized system) for a biometric scan. The scan is processed to generate a biometric template. This template is combined with the received challenge and a local secret within the HRoT. This combined data is used to generate a signature or hash.

4.  **Attestation Verification:** The signature/hash is sent to the Attestation Server. The server verifies the biometric data against a trusted profile (or a one-time verification against user credentials).  If valid, the server confirms the node's identity.

5.  **Key Derivation Request:** Upon successful attestation, the Virtual Network Manager requests a key for a specific virtual network. This request includes a network identifier and a session identifier.

6.  **Key Material Provisioning:** The Attestation Server provides the physical node with a minimal amount of *key material* – a short, random string – specific to the requested virtual network.  This material is encrypted using a public key associated with the HRoT module.

7.  **Local Key Generation:** The HRoT module decrypts the key material.  The following values are combined as inputs to the KDF:
    *   Key Material
    *   Network Identifier
    *   Session Identifier
    *   A unique, locally-generated random nonce
    *   A timestamp

    The KDF outputs the session key for the virtual network.

8.  **Ephemeral Key Use:** The session key is used for encryption, decryption, and authentication of packets within the virtual network. The key is automatically discarded after a predefined session timeout.

**Pseudocode (HRoT Module):**

```
function generateSessionKey(keyMaterial, networkID, sessionID, localNonce, timestamp):
    combinedInput = keyMaterial + networkID + sessionID + localNonce + timestamp
    sessionKey = HKDF(combinedInput, SHA512) // Using HKDF with SHA512
    return sessionKey

function handleKeyRequest(encryptedKeyMaterial, networkID, sessionID):
    decryptedKeyMaterial = decrypt(encryptedKeyMaterial, privateKey) // HRoT private key
    localNonce = generateRandomNonce()
    sessionKey = generateSessionKey(decryptedKeyMaterial, networkID, sessionID, localNonce, currentTime())
    return sessionKey
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Biometric Spoofing:** Implement liveness detection and anti-spoofing measures for the biometric scanner.
*   **HRoT Compromise:** The HRoT module must be physically secure and tamper-resistant.
*   **Key Material Protection:** The key material provided by the Attestation Server must be encrypted and protected in transit.
*   **Session Timeout:**  Implement a strict session timeout to minimize the impact of key compromise.
*   **Attestation Server Security:** The Attestation Server is a critical component and must be highly secure.
