## Dynamic VRF Assignment via Beaconing

**Concept:** Extend the VRF concept to dynamically assign network traffic to VRFs based on beacon signals emitted by devices, creating a self-organizing, policy-driven network segmentation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Beaconing Devices:**

*   **Hardware:** Each device requiring VRF assignment (e.g., IoT sensors, user endpoints) will have a low-power beaconing module.
*   **Beacon Payload:** The beacon will contain:
    *   Device Identifier (unique ID)
    *   Policy Tag (integer or string representing a network access policy â€“ e.g., 'guest', 'security_critical', 'production')
    *   Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
*   **Beacon Frequency:** Configurable, ranging from several times per second to once per minute, depending on mobility and network responsiveness needs.

**2. VRF Router/Switch Enhancement:**

*   **Beacon Listener Module:** Dedicated hardware/software module to receive and decode beacon signals.
*   **Policy-to-VRF Mapping Table:** Configurable table mapping policy tags to VRF domains. Admin defines which policy maps to which VRF.
*   **Dynamic Flow Table Generation:** Based on the received beacon signals and the policy-to-VRF mapping, the router dynamically generates flow table entries. These entries dictate how traffic from the beaconing device is forwarded within the appropriate VRF.
*   **RSSI-Based VRF Prioritization:** If multiple VRFs are potentially applicable based on policy, RSSI can be used to prioritize VRF assignment. Stronger signals indicate closer proximity and potentially higher priority access.
*   **Security Considerations:** Beacon signal authentication to prevent spoofing. Encryption of the policy tag within the beacon.

**3. Operation:**

1.  A beaconing device transmits its beacon signal.
2.  VRF Routers/Switches receive the beacon.
3.  The router extracts the Device ID, Policy Tag, and RSSI.
4.  Using the Policy-to-VRF Mapping Table, the router determines the appropriate VRF domain.
5.  A flow table entry is dynamically created, associating the Device ID (or a derived identifier like MAC address) with the identified VRF.
6.  All subsequent traffic from the device is forwarded according to the VRF rules.
7.  The router can monitor beacon signals for changes in policy tag or signal strength and dynamically update the flow table accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Router Flow Table Update):**

```
function updateFlowTable(beacon):
  deviceID = beacon.deviceID
  policyTag = beacon.policyTag
  rssi = beacon.rssi

  vrfID = policyToVRFMap[policyTag] // Lookup VRF ID based on policy tag

  if vrfID is null:
    vrfID = defaultVRF // Assign to default VRF if policy is unknown

  // Prioritize VRF based on RSSI (if multiple VRFs applicable)
  // (Implementation detail - could involve weighting RSSI values)

  // Create/Update Flow Table Entry:
  flowEntry = FlowTable.get(deviceID)
  if flowEntry is null:
    flowEntry = new FlowTableEntry(deviceID, vrfID)
  else:
    flowEntry.vrfID = vrfID

  FlowTable.put(deviceID, flowEntry)
end function
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Simplified Network Segmentation:**  Eliminates the need for manual VRF configuration for each device.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:**  Policies can be changed centrally, and devices will automatically adapt.
*   **Scalability:**  Easily accommodates large numbers of devices.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Enforces access control based on dynamic policies.
