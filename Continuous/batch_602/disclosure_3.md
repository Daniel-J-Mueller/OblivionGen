## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Personalized Soundscapes

**System Overview:** A distributed audio system extending the multi-zone communication concept to dynamically create personalized acoustic environments within a vehicle or building. This goes beyond simple communication mixing; it aims to reshape the soundscape *for each occupant*, independent of communication sessions.

**Core Components:**

*   **Zone Definition:** System identifies and defines acoustic zones based on occupant location (using seat sensors, cameras, or user input). Zones are not necessarily fixed; they adapt to movement.
*   **Microphone Array:** A dense array of microphones distributed throughout the space.  These aren’t just for communication – they capture ambient sounds *and* individual occupant sounds (speech, humming, etc.).
*   **Sound Source Identification:** AI-powered sound source separation.  The system identifies *what* is making sound (music, speech, engine noise, external sounds) and *where* the sound is originating from.
*   **Personalized Audio Profiles:** Each occupant creates or the system infers a 'sound preference profile' – genres of music, preferred volume levels, preferred equalization, ‘do not disturb’ settings, etc.
*   **Acoustic Rendering Engine:**  The core of the system.  This engine dynamically mixes, filters, and spatializes audio to create a unique soundscape for each zone, based on occupant preferences, communication sessions, and ambient sounds.
*   **Beamforming Speakers:** Speakers capable of directing sound precisely to each zone, minimizing spillover and creating a more immersive experience.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Optionally, integrate haptic feedback (vibrations in seats) synchronized with the audio, further enhancing immersion or providing subtle alerts.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Communication Mode (inherited from the patent):** Functions as described in the original patent – mixing incoming/outgoing audio for communication sessions, but enhanced by personalized equalization and volume levels *per occupant zone*.
2.  **Personalized Ambiance Mode:**  Each occupant can select a pre-defined ‘soundscape’ (e.g., ‘Rainforest’, ‘Cafe’, ‘Concert Hall’) or create a custom one. The system adapts ambient sounds, music, and other audio elements to create the desired atmosphere *within their zone*.
3.  **Focus Mode:**  Actively cancels out distracting sounds *outside* of the occupant’s zone, while subtly amplifying sounds *within* their zone (e.g., a co-worker’s voice during a discussion). Uses active noise cancellation and beamforming.
4.  **Safety/Alert Mode:**  Prioritizes safety-critical alerts (e.g., emergency vehicle sirens, collision warnings) by ensuring they are clearly audible within the occupant’s zone, even if other audio is playing.  May use spatial audio to indicate the direction of the alert.

**Pseudocode - Acoustic Rendering Engine:**

```
// Input: Audio Streams (communication, ambient, music, etc.), Occupant Profiles, Zone Definitions
// Output: Audio Signals for each Beamforming Speaker

For Each Zone:
    ZoneAudio = Empty Audio Signal

    // Communication Audio
    If Zone is participating in a communication session:
        CommunicationAudio = Mix Incoming/Outgoing Audio (based on session)
        CommunicationAudio = Apply Equalization/Volume (from Occupant Profile)
        ZoneAudio = Add CommunicationAudio

    // Ambient/Music Audio
    If Occupant wants Ambient/Music:
        AmbientMusicAudio = Select/Generate Audio (based on Occupant Profile)
        AmbientMusicAudio = Apply Equalization/Volume (from Occupant Profile)
        ZoneAudio = Add AmbientMusicAudio

    // Noise Cancellation
    ExternalNoise = Capture Audio from Microphones outside Zone
    NoiseCancellationAudio = Apply Active Noise Cancellation to ExternalNoise
    ZoneAudio = Subtract NoiseCancellationAudio

    // Spatialization
    SpatializedAudio = Apply Beamforming to ZoneAudio (direct sound to Zone)

    // Output SpatializedAudio to Beamforming Speakers for Zone
End For
```

**Expansion Potential:**

*   Integration with biometric sensors (heart rate, brainwave activity) to dynamically adjust the soundscape based on occupant emotional state.
*   AI-powered music recommendation engine that learns occupant preferences and suggests new music.
*   Holographic audio projection – creating the illusion of sounds originating from specific points in space.
*   Contextual awareness – adjusting the soundscape based on location (e.g., quieter music in a library, more energetic music at a gym).
