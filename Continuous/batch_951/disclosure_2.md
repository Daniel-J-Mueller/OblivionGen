*   **Sensor Suite:** High-resolution RGB camera (minimum 48MP), LiDAR sensor (range: 50m, accuracy: ±2cm), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a short-range (1-5m) ultrasonic proximity sensor array.
*   **Communication:** 5GHz 802.11ac Wi-Fi for high-bandwidth data transfer to a base station. Ad-hoc mesh networking capability for inter-UAV communication.
*   **Power:** High-density LiPo battery (minimum 30min flight time under load). Wireless charging dock.
*   **Swarm Size:** Configurable, up to 20 UAVs per swarm.

**Innovation Description:**

A system where multiple miniaturized UAVs autonomously collaborate to create dynamic 3D reconstructions of environments in real-time.  Unlike simple photogrammetry or LiDAR mapping, this system focuses on *adaptive* mapping—the swarm dynamically adjusts its mapping strategy based on identified features and user-defined goals.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** A 'lead' UAV is designated (either manually or automatically based on battery level/processing power) and initiates the swarm. The lead receives high-level mission parameters (area to map, desired level of detail, specific objects of interest).
2.  **Exploration Phase:** The swarm disperses, utilizing a modified Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm.  Each UAV independently explores its assigned volume. The RRT algorithm is biased towards areas with high feature density (determined by onboard computer vision).
3.  **Data Fusion & Reconstruction:** Each UAV captures RGB images, LiDAR point clouds, and IMU data. This data is streamed back to the lead UAV (or a designated base station) in real-time via the mesh network.  A Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm is employed to fuse the data from all UAVs into a single, consistent 3D map.  This map is dynamically updated as the swarm continues to explore.
4.  **Adaptive Mapping:** The system incorporates a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to identify objects of interest (e.g., people, vehicles, specific structures). When an object of interest is detected, the swarm *automatically* adjusts its mapping strategy to focus on that object. This may involve:
    *   Increasing the density of UAVs in the vicinity of the object.
    *   Altering flight paths to capture more detailed imagery.
    *   Activating the ultrasonic proximity sensors to create a highly accurate 3D model of the object.
5.  **Output:** The final output is a textured 3D mesh that can be viewed, analyzed, or used for virtual reality/augmented reality applications.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Swarm Logic - per UAV):**

```
loop:
  senseEnvironment() // LiDAR, Camera, IMU
  data = processData() // Filter, Feature Extraction
  
  if(objectOfInterestDetected(data)):
    swarm.alertLeader(location, objectType)
    adjustFlightPath(targetObject)  //Move closer, circle, etc.
    increaseDataCaptureRate()
  else:
    exploreRandomly() //RRT Algorithm
    transmitData()
  end if
end loop
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Search and Rescue operations.
*   Automated inspection of infrastructure (bridges, power lines).
*   Construction site monitoring.
*   Crime scene reconstruction.
*   Disaster assessment.
*   Virtual tourism.
