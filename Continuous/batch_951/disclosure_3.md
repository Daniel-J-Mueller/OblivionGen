## Dynamic Network Topology Mapping & Predictive Flow Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand the multi-path routing concept by actively *mapping* the network topology in real-time and *predicting* future congestion based on observed data flow patterns, then preemptively adjusting data flows *before* congestion occurs. This moves beyond reactive path selection to proactive network optimization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Topology Mapping Agent (TMA):**

*   **Deployment:** Integrated into client and source devices (as in the patent) *and* strategically deployed on intermediate network nodes (routers, switches, proxies - requiring cooperation with network providers or dedicated hardware).
*   **Function:**  Each TMA actively probes the network beyond simple latency/loss measurements. It performs:
    *   **Trace Route Expansion:** Traditional trace routes identify path. TMA extends this to measure *capacity* of each hop (using techniques like packet burst analysis – sending varying packet sizes/rates and observing queuing behavior).
    *   **Neighbor Discovery:**  Identifies directly connected devices and their reported capacity.
    *   **Link Quality Assessment:** Measures signal strength, error rates (where applicable - wireless links), and bandwidth availability.
*   **Data Representation:** Creates a dynamic graph database representing the network topology. Nodes = devices. Edges = links with attributes: capacity, latency, loss, cost (if applicable), utilization.
*   **Data Synchronization:** TMAs periodically exchange topology information (full or delta updates) using a gossip protocol to ensure a consistent view of the network.

**2. Predictive Flow Adjustment (PFA) Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:** Utilizes the dynamic topology map from TMAs *and* historical data flow patterns (volume, time of day, destination).
*   **Prediction Model:** Employs a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future bandwidth demand on each network link.  Crucially, it incorporates external factors like scheduled events (e.g., software updates, backups) which influence network traffic.
*   **Flow Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   **Congestion Thresholds:** Defines acceptable congestion levels for each link.
    *   **Proactive Re-Routing:** When the prediction model forecasts congestion approaching the threshold, the PFA engine *preemptively* re-routes flows to alternative paths with sufficient capacity.  This happens *before* packet loss or increased latency is observed.
    *   **Flow Splitting:**  If no single alternative path can handle the entire flow, the PFA engine splits the flow across multiple paths (ECMP-like behavior, but dynamically determined).
    *   **Optimization Objective:** Minimizes overall network latency and packet loss, while considering path cost (if applicable) and fairness among users.

**3. Communication Protocol Enhancements:**

*   **Probe Packet Structure:**  Augment probe packets with unique identifiers and timestamps to track round-trip times accurately and correlate data from different TMAs.
*   **Topology Advertisement:** Define a standardized message format for exchanging topology information between TMAs.
*   **Flow Control Signaling:**  Implement a signaling mechanism to communicate flow adjustment decisions between PFA engines on different devices.

**Pseudocode (PFA Engine – Simplified):**

```
function predict_congestion(link, time_horizon):
  // Use time series model to predict bandwidth demand on 'link'
  predicted_demand = time_series_model.predict(link, time_horizon)
  return predicted_demand

function find_alternative_paths(source, destination, current_path):
  // Query topology map for paths from 'source' to 'destination'
  // Exclude 'current_path'
  // Filter paths based on available bandwidth and cost
  return alternative_paths

function adjust_flow(flow, current_path):
  predicted_congestion = predict_congestion(current_path, 5) // Predict for next 5 seconds
  if predicted_congestion > threshold:
    alternative_paths = find_alternative_paths(flow.source, flow.destination, current_path)
    if alternative_paths:
      best_path = select_best_path(alternative_paths) // Based on bandwidth, latency, cost
      re-route_flow(flow, best_path)
      log_re-route(flow, best_path)
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive congestion avoidance to *proactive* network optimization by combining real-time topology mapping, predictive modeling, and dynamic flow adjustment.  The inclusion of intermediate node participation and predictive modeling are key differentiators.
