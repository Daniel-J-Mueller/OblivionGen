## Dynamic Event Prediction & Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Extend the prediction capabilities of the patent to proactively trigger haptic feedback on a wearable device *before* an event occurs, providing a subtle, anticipatory cue to the user. This isn’t just notification *of* an upcoming event, but a pre-emptive sensory experience designed to enhance engagement and potentially even reaction time.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Core:** The existing video analysis pipeline (as described in the patent) serves as the foundation.
*   **Haptic Controller:** A dedicated hardware/software module responsible for translating predicted event data into haptic patterns. This module connects to wearable haptic devices (wristbands, gloves, etc.).
*   **Wearable Device:**  A device capable of delivering nuanced haptic feedback – varying intensity, frequency, and pattern. Multi-actuator support is preferred for complex patterns.
*   **User Profile Database:** Stores user preferences for haptic feedback – intensity levels, preferred patterns for different event types, and sensitivity settings.
*   **Real-time Communication:** Low-latency communication protocol between the video analysis system, haptic controller, and wearable device is crucial. UDP or similar protocols are preferred.

**II. Functional Breakdown:**

1.  **Event Prediction:** The video analysis pipeline identifies potential events with a confidence score and a time-to-occurrence estimate.

2.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:**
    *   The system maps event types to pre-defined or dynamically generated haptic patterns. Example: a fast-approaching object might trigger a rapidly increasing vibration intensity, while a player about to score might trigger a rhythmic pulsing.
    *   The time-to-occurrence estimate dictates the timing of the haptic pattern.  A ‘lead time’ parameter allows customization.
    *   User preferences are applied – adjusting intensity, pattern complexity, and even enabling/disabling haptic feedback for specific event types.

3.  **Haptic Feedback Delivery:**
    *   The haptic controller transmits the generated pattern to the wearable device.
    *   The wearable device delivers the haptic feedback to the user.
    *   Optional: Integration with other sensory modalities (e.g., subtle changes in ambient lighting) to enhance the effect.

**III. Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION GenerateHapticPattern(event_type, confidence_score, time_to_occurrence, user_profile):

  // Load default pattern for event_type from database
  pattern = LoadDefaultPattern(event_type)

  // Adjust pattern based on confidence score
  IF confidence_score > 0.8 THEN
    pattern.intensity = MAX_INTENSITY
  ELSE IF confidence_score > 0.5 THEN
    pattern.intensity = MEDIUM_INTENSITY
  ELSE
    pattern.intensity = LOW_INTENSITY

  //Adjust intensity based on user profile
  pattern.intensity = pattern.intensity * user_profile.haptic_intensity_multiplier

  //Adjust timing based on time_to_occurrence
  pattern.start_delay = time_to_occurrence * user_profile.haptic_lead_time_factor

  //Return adjusted pattern
  RETURN pattern
END FUNCTION
```

**IV. Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Wearable Device:**  High-density actuator arrays preferred for complex haptic patterns. Low power consumption is critical.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is suitable for wireless communication. Ultra-Wideband (UWB) offers lower latency but requires more power.
*   **Processing:** Dedicated co-processor on the wearable device can offload haptic pattern rendering from the main processor.

**V. Potential Applications:**

*   **Sports Viewing:** Enhance the immersive experience by providing subtle cues about upcoming plays.
*   **Gaming:** Increase reaction time and immersion in virtual reality games.
*   **Safety & Security:** Alert users to potential hazards in their environment (e.g., approaching vehicles, obstacles).
*   **Accessibility:** Provide tactile notifications for users with visual or auditory impairments.
