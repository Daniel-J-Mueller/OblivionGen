## Dynamic Dependency Injection for Chaos Engineering

**Concept:** Expand the idea of throttling downstream services *during* testing to a proactive system that injects controlled dependencies – even entirely simulated services – *before* and *during* test execution. This moves beyond simply *reducing* throughput to *altering* the dependency landscape itself, allowing for far more nuanced and realistic failure scenarios.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Profile Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** Graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) to model service dependencies. Nodes represent services; edges represent dependencies (synchronous/asynchronous, protocol, expected latency, data schema).
*   **Profile Creation:**  Automated discovery (via service mesh telemetry – Istio, Linkerd), manual configuration, or a combination.  Includes metadata for each dependency – version, criticality, known failure modes.
*   **Versioning:** Dependency profiles are versioned to allow rollback to known-good states and repeatable testing.

**2. Dependency Injection Engine:**

*   **Modes:**
    *   *Shadow Mode:* Intercepts calls to a real dependency and forwards them to a simulated dependency for observation.  No impact to production.
    *   *Mirror Mode:* Duplicates calls to both the real and simulated dependencies. Allows comparison of responses.
    *   *Replace Mode:*  Completely replaces the real dependency with a simulated one.  Used for full isolation.
    *   *Delay/Degrade Mode:*  Introduces latency or errors into the responses from the real dependency.
*   **Simulation Capabilities:**
    *   *Stubbing:*  Return pre-defined responses for specific requests.
    *   *Stateful Simulation:* Maintain internal state within the simulation to model complex behavior.
    *   *Fault Injection:* Simulate network errors, timeouts, incorrect data, etc.
    *   *Load Generation:*  Simulate high load on the dependency to test scalability.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:**  Ability to change dependency mappings on-the-fly during test execution.

**3. Test Orchestration Integration:**

*   **API:**  REST API for configuring dependency injection rules and triggering test scenarios.
*   **Integration with Test Frameworks:** Plugins for common test frameworks (JUnit, pytest, etc.) to simplify test setup and execution.
*   **Test Specification Language:** DSL for defining complex dependency injection scenarios.  Example:
    ```
    scenario "Order Processing Failure" {
      service "PaymentService" {
        replace with "PaymentServiceSim"
        fault "TimeoutError" probability 0.2
      }
      service "InventoryService" {
        delay 500ms
      }
    }
    ```

**4. Monitoring and Analytics:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Track the status of dependencies, injected simulations, and test execution.
*   **Performance Metrics:**  Collect metrics on response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
*   **Automated Analysis:** Identify anomalies and potential issues.



**Pseudocode - Dependency Injection Engine:**

```python
class DependencyInjector:
    def __init__(self, dependency_graph):
        self.dependency_graph = dependency_graph

    def inject(self, service_name, request, config):
        if config.get('mode') == 'replace':
            simulated_service = self.get_simulated_service(service_name)
            response = simulated_service.handle_request(request)
        elif config.get('mode') == 'delay':
            time.sleep(config.get('delay_ms') / 1000.0)
            # Forward to real service
        elif config.get('mode') == 'fault':
          if random.random() < config.get('probability'):
            raise Exception("Simulated Fault") #Simulate fault
          #Forward to real service
        else: #forward to real service
            response = self.get_real_service(service_name).handle_request(request)
        return response

    def get_simulated_service(self, service_name):
        #Implement logic to retrieve simulated service instance
        pass

    def get_real_service(self, service_name):
        #Implement logic to retrieve real service instance
        pass
```

This system moves beyond simply testing *how* a service handles failure, to *creating* failure in a controlled and reproducible way, across complex dependencies.  It opens the door to sophisticated chaos engineering scenarios and proactive resilience testing.
