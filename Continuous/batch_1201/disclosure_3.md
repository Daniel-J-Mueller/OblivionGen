## Device State Prediction & Pre-emptive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend device state analysis beyond simply *detecting* inaccuracies to *predicting* likely state transitions and pre-emptively allocating resources (bandwidth, processing power, energy) to support those anticipated states.

**Specifications:**

**1. State Transition Modeling:**

*   **Data Input:** Historical device state data (as per existing patent), real-time sensor data (network latency, CPU usage, memory consumption, battery level), application usage patterns, user behavior data (location, time of day, typical application sequences).
*   **Model:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model state transitions. LSTMs are well-suited for time-series data and can learn long-term dependencies.
*   **Output:**  A probability distribution over possible future device states for a defined prediction horizon (e.g., next 5 seconds, next minute).  Output includes not just the likely *state* (e.g., 'playing video', 'idle'), but also estimated resource requirements associated with that state.

**2. Resource Allocation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted state probability distribution (from Step 1), current resource availability (bandwidth, CPU, memory, battery), defined Quality of Service (QoS) profiles for different application types.
*   **Logic:** Implement a constraint satisfaction algorithm to allocate resources based on the predicted state probabilities and QoS requirements. The algorithm should prioritize critical applications and balance resource allocation to prevent bottlenecks.  Resource 'pre-staging' should be possible - allocating resources *before* the state transition actually occurs.
*   **Output:**  A resource allocation plan, specifying the amount of each resource to be allocated to each application.

**3. Dynamic Adjustment & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor actual device state and resource usage.
*   **Feedback:** Compare predicted state/resource usage with actual values. Use the difference (error) to refine the RNN model (Step 1) and resource allocation algorithm (Step 2) using reinforcement learning techniques.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The system should continuously adapt to changing device behavior and user patterns.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation):**

```
FUNCTION allocateResources(predictedStates, currentResources, qosProfiles):
  // predictedStates: Dictionary of {state: probability}
  // currentResources: Dictionary of {resource: availableAmount}
  // qosProfiles: Dictionary of {applicationType: {resource: minimumRequired}}

  allocationPlan = {}

  FOR EACH applicationType, qosProfile IN qosProfile:
    minResourceRequirements = qosProfile

    // Calculate weighted resource requirements based on predicted state probabilities
    weightedRequirements = {}
    FOR EACH state, probability IN predictedStates:
      weightedRequirements[state] = {}
      FOR EACH resource, requirement IN minResourceRequirements:
        weightedRequirements[state][resource] = probability * requirement

    // Sum weighted requirements across all states
    totalRequirements = {}
    FOR EACH resource IN totalRequirements:
      totalRequirements[resource] = 0
      FOR EACH state IN weightedRequirements:
        totalRequirements[resource] += weightedRequirements[state][resource]
  
    // Allocate resources based on total requirements and current availability
    FOR EACH resource IN totalRequirements:
      allocatedAmount = MIN(totalRequirements[resource], currentResources[resource])
      allocationPlan[applicationType][resource] = allocatedAmount
      currentResources[resource] -= allocatedAmount
  
  RETURN allocationPlan
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge computing capabilities are essential for real-time prediction and allocation.
*   Dedicated hardware acceleration (e.g., neural processing units) can improve performance.
*   Low-power design is crucial for battery-operated devices.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved video streaming quality.
*   Enhanced gaming performance.
*   Seamless augmented/virtual reality experiences.
*   Proactive energy management.
*   Optimized network bandwidth utilization.
