## Dynamic Spectrum Harvesting for E-Reader Power

**Concept:** Extend the photovoltaic harvesting concept beyond visible and near-infrared light by incorporating a micro-spectrum analyzer and tunable filters to capture and convert ambient radio frequency (RF) energy into usable power.

**Specifications:**

**1. RF Harvesting Module:**
    *   **Antenna Array:**  A miniature, multi-directional antenna array integrated into the e-reader bezel. Array to consist of 8-16 microstrip patch antennas, each tuned to a slightly different frequency band within the usable RF spectrum (e.g., 700 MHz â€“ 6 GHz).  Antenna material: flexible PCB with silver ink traces.
    *   **Micro-Spectrum Analyzer:** Integrated ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) performing real-time spectrum analysis of the received RF signals.  
        *   Resolution: 1 MHz bandwidth.
        *   Frequency Range: 700 MHz - 6 GHz.
        *   Dynamic Range: -100 dBm to +20 dBm.
    *   **Tunable Bandpass Filters:** Array of micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) tunable bandpass filters, corresponding to each antenna element.
        *   Q-factor: >50.
        *   Tunability Range: 100 MHz to 1 GHz.
        *   Switching Speed: <10 microseconds.
    *   **Rectifier Circuit:**  High-efficiency Schottky diode-based rectifier circuit for each filter output. Optimized for low input power levels.
    *   **DC-DC Boost Converter:** Integrated DC-DC boost converter to step up the rectified RF energy to a usable voltage level (3.3V - 5V).
    *   **Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT):** MPPT algorithm implemented in firmware to dynamically adjust filter settings and boost converter parameters for optimal energy harvesting.

**2. Integration with Existing System:**

*   **Photovoltaic Cell Enhancement:** The RF harvesting module's output is fed into the existing battery charge controller alongside the power generated by the photovoltaic cells.
*   **Light Guide Integration:**  Utilize existing light guide structure to disperse heat generated by RF harvesting module. Thin layer of thermally conductive epoxy between module and light guide.
*   **Firmware Control:**  Microcontroller firmware manages the RF harvesting module, performing spectrum analysis, tuning filters, controlling the boost converter, and implementing the MPPT algorithm.
*   **Power Management:** Firmware monitors battery charge levels and dynamically adjusts power allocation between photovoltaic cells and RF harvesting module.  Prioritize photovoltaic energy when available.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
