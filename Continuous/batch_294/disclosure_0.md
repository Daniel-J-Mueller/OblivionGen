## Dynamic Neural Network ‘Health’ Profiling & Adaptive Layer Pruning

**Concept:** Extend improper input detection beyond simple outlier identification to create a real-time ‘health profile’ of the neural network itself. This profile isn’t just about bad *inputs*, but about degradation or drift within the network’s weights and activations *over time*. Use this profile to dynamically prune layers or connections exhibiting the most significant deviation from expected behavior, essentially performing self-repair.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires integration with existing hardware circuits (as described in the patent) but adds a ‘profiling engine’ alongside the improper input detection circuit. This engine will consist of dedicated memory blocks for storing health metrics and a processing unit for real-time analysis.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `LayerHealth`: A structure containing:
        *   `MeanActivation`: Mean activation value for each layer.
        *   `StdDevActivation`: Standard deviation of activation values.
        *   `WeightEntropy`: Entropy of weight distribution within the layer.
        *   `GradientNorm`: Norm of the gradient during backpropagation.
        *   `DeviationScore`: A combined metric indicating overall health (calculated – see algorithm).
    *   `NetworkHealthProfile`: An array of `LayerHealth` structures, one for each layer in the network.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Baseline Profiling:** During initial training (or a calibration phase), establish a baseline `NetworkHealthProfile` using a representative dataset. Store these baseline values.
    2.  **Real-time Monitoring:** During inference:
        *   For each layer:
            *   Calculate `MeanActivation` and `StdDevActivation`.
            *   Calculate `WeightEntropy`.
            *   Calculate `GradientNorm` during backpropagation (if applicable, e.g., during fine-tuning or continual learning).
        *   Calculate `DeviationScore` for each layer using a weighted combination of the above metrics:

            `DeviationScore = w1 * (abs(MeanActivation - BaselineMeanActivation) / BaselineMeanActivation) + w2 * (abs(StdDevActivation - BaselineStdDevActivation) / BaselineStdDevActivation) + w3 * (abs(WeightEntropy - BaselineWeightEntropy) / BaselineWeightEntropy) + w4 * (GradientNorm - BaselineGradientNorm)`

            (Where `w1`, `w2`, `w3`, and `w4` are adjustable weights).
    3.  **Adaptive Pruning:**
        *   Define a `PruningThreshold` (adjustable).
        *   If `DeviationScore` for a layer exceeds `PruningThreshold`:
            *   Identify the weakest connections (e.g., those with the smallest weights) within that layer.
            *   Prune a percentage of those connections (adjustable – `PruningPercentage`).
            *   Retrain (or fine-tune) the pruned network to compensate for the removed connections.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `BaselineDataset`: Dataset used for establishing the initial `NetworkHealthProfile`.
    *   `ProfilingFrequency`: How often to calculate the `NetworkHealthProfile` metrics.
    *   `PruningThreshold`: Threshold for triggering layer pruning.
    *   `PruningPercentage`: Percentage of connections to prune.
    *   `WeightingFactors`: `w1`, `w2`, `w3`, and `w4` for calculating `DeviationScore`.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Robustness:** Dynamic pruning can mitigate the effects of weight drift and prevent catastrophic failure.
*   **Reduced Computational Cost:** Pruning can reduce the size and complexity of the network, leading to faster inference.
*   **Enhanced Adaptability:**  The network can adapt to changing data distributions and operating conditions.
*   **Self-Repairing Capabilities:** The system can automatically detect and correct problems within the network.
