## Dynamic Link Weighting for Contextual Navigation

**Concept:** Extend the link analysis beyond simple source/target positioning to incorporate contextual weighting based on content similarity between the linked content and surrounding text. This enables a more nuanced and 'smart' table of contents/navigation generation.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Embedding Module:**

*   **Input:** Electronic media item text.
*   **Process:** Utilize a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, Sentence Transformers) to generate dense vector embeddings for each paragraph/section of the electronic media item.  Store these embeddings in a lookup table keyed by section identifier.
*   **Output:** Vector embedding lookup table.

**2. Link Context Analyzer:**

*   **Input:** Electronic media item, link data (source position, target position), vector embedding lookup table.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each link, extract the text surrounding the source position (e.g., paragraph, section).
    *   Generate a vector embedding for the surrounding text.
    *   Retrieve the vector embedding of the target section.
    *   Calculate a cosine similarity score between the source context embedding and the target section embedding. This represents the contextual relevance of the link.
    *   Assign a 'contextual weight' to the link based on the cosine similarity.  A threshold can be applied to filter out irrelevant links.
*   **Output:**  Link data enriched with a 'contextual weight' attribute.

**3. Weighted Navigation Generation:**

*   **Input:** Link data with contextual weights, original link data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Modify the existing grouping and sub-grouping logic. Instead of solely relying on source positions and targeting/ordering rules, incorporate the 'contextual weight'.
    *   Links with higher contextual weights are prioritized during group formation and sub-group selection.  This could involve assigning a higher score to these links in the overall navigation structure.
    *   The positioning and title rules remain but are *modulated* by the contextual weight. A link satisfying a rule but having a low weight might be excluded or down-prioritized.
    *   Implement a ‘weight decay’ factor. Over time, less used links have their weights reduced, dynamically adjusting the navigation structure based on user interaction.

*   **Output:**  Enhanced navigation control file (NCX/NXC) with a dynamically adjusted table of contents and navigation structure.

**Pseudocode (Weighted Sub-group Selection):**

```
function selectSubGroups(links, orderingRule, targetingRule, weightThreshold):
  groups = groupLinksBySource(links)
  subGroups = []

  for group in groups:
    eligibleLinks = []
    for link in group:
      if link.contextualWeight >= weightThreshold and 
         satisfiesTargetingRule(link, group) and
         satisfiesOrderingRule(link, group):
        eligibleLinks.append(link)

    if len(eligibleLinks) > 0:
      subGroups.append(eligibleLinks)

  return subGroups
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   More relevant and intuitive navigation experience.
*   Adaptive navigation structure based on content and user interaction.
*   Improved accessibility for users with varying needs.
*   Potential to highlight key content based on contextual relevance.
