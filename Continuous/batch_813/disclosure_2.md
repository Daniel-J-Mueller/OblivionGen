## Dynamic Skill Composition via Predictive Decomposition

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual skill responses to orchestrate *composed* skill interactions based on predicted user intent *before* full utterance processing. This moves from reactive error handling to proactive skill assembly.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Intent Prediction Module:**  A lightweight neural network (separate from core dialog models) analyzes initial audio/ASR data (first 1-2 seconds) to predict *multiple* potential high-level user intents (e.g., “book a flight,” “play music,” “set a timer”).  Output is a probability distribution across these intents. This is separate from the entity recognition/action determination described in the provided patent.

2.  **Skill Dependency Graph:** Maintain a graph where nodes represent skills and edges define potential interactions/data dependencies.  Edges have associated costs (latency, resource usage) and confidence scores (how likely successful interaction is). The graph is dynamically updated based on usage patterns and performance.

3.  **Proactive Skill Chain Generation:**  Given the intent prediction distribution, the system searches the Skill Dependency Graph for potential skill chains that fulfill those intents. Multiple chains are generated, ranked by estimated cost and confidence.

4.  **Partial Utterance Forwarding:**  As the user continues speaking, partial utterances are forwarded to *multiple* skills in the candidate chains *simultaneously*. Skills begin pre-processing the input and generate preliminary responses or confirmations.

5.  **Dynamic Chain Pruning & Refinement:** Based on the preliminary responses from the skills, the system dynamically prunes unsuccessful chains and refines the remaining candidates.  Early failures avoid wasted processing. The system prioritizes the most promising chain as the user finishes speaking.

6.  **Contextual Blending:**  Responses from the selected chain are blended into a coherent dialog response, leveraging a natural language generation component.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initial processing
audioData = receiveAudio();
asrData = performASR(audioData);
intentPredictions = predictIntent(asrData); // Lightweight network

// Skill chain generation
candidateChains = generateSkillChains(intentPredictions, skillDependencyGraph);
rankedChains = rankSkillChains(candidateChains);

// Parallel Skill Execution
foreach chain in rankedChains:
    foreach skill in chain:
        skill.beginProcessing(asrData); // Initial processing with partial data

// Monitor Skill Progress & Prune
while (user is speaking):
    monitorSkillProgress();
    pruneUnsuccessfulChains();
    
// Final Selection & Response
selectedChain = getBestChain();
finalResponse = generateResponse(selectedChain.results);
sendResponse(finalResponse);
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond *reacting* to potential skill failures (as the provided patent describes) to *proactively* assembling and executing multiple potential skill chains *in parallel*. It's about anticipating user intent and optimizing skill execution *before* full utterance processing is complete. This could significantly reduce latency and improve dialog responsiveness.
