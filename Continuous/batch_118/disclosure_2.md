## Predictive Feature Flag Analytics & Automated Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the impact analysis to *proactively* predict the impact of feature flags *before* they are fully enabled, using live data and A/B testing results. Implement automated rollback based on these predictions exceeding defined thresholds.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time application telemetry (user behavior, performance metrics, error rates).
    *   A/B testing platform data (cohort performance, statistical significance).
    *   Code repository metadata (feature flag dependencies, related code changes).
    *   Existing impact analysis records (from the provided patent - used as a historical baseline).
*   **Prediction Model:**
    *   Utilize a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) trained on historical data correlated with feature flag changes.
    *   Input features: feature flag state, user segments, application metrics (latency, error rate, CPU usage), A/B test results.
    *   Output: Predicted impact on key performance indicators (KPIs) for varying levels of feature flag enablement (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 100%).
*   **Risk Assessment Engine:**
    *   Define configurable thresholds for predicted KPI degradation (e.g., “rollback if predicted latency increase > 20%”).
    *   Calculate a “risk score” based on predicted impact, threshold violations, and the criticality of the affected feature.
    *   Dynamically adjust thresholds based on user segment (e.g., higher sensitivity for premium users).
*   **Automated Rollback System:**
    *   If the risk score exceeds a defined level, automatically trigger a rollback of the feature flag to its previous state.
    *   Provide a notification to the development team with details of the rollback and the triggering factors.
    *   Log all rollback events for auditing and analysis.
*   **UI/Dashboard:**
    *   Real-time visualization of predicted impact on KPIs.
    *   Configurable risk thresholds and rollback triggers.
    *   Rollback history and audit logs.
    *   Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_impact(feature_flag, user_segment, telemetry_data, historical_data):
  # Train time-series forecasting model using historical data
  model = train_model(historical_data)
  # Predict KPI values based on current telemetry and feature flag state
  predicted_KPIs = model.predict(telemetry_data, feature_flag, user_segment)
  return predicted_KPIs

function assess_risk(predicted_KPIs, thresholds, criticality):
  # Calculate risk score based on KPI deviations and thresholds
  risk_score = calculate_risk_score(predicted_KPIs, thresholds, criticality)
  return risk_score

function trigger_rollback(feature_flag):
  # Disable feature flag and revert to previous state
  disable_feature_flag(feature_flag)
  # Log rollback event
  log_rollback_event(feature_flag)
  # Notify development team
  notify_team(feature_flag)

# Main Loop

    risk_score = assess_risk(predicted_KPIs)
    if risk_score > rollback_threshold:
      trigger_rollback(feature_flag)
