## Dynamic Treatment Pathway Generation via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Leverage the propensity binning and sequential training approach to *actively* design treatment pathways, rather than simply predicting outcomes. This shifts the paradigm from prediction to *prescription*.

**Specification:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Propensity Binning Module:** (As per patent) – Assigns users to propensity bins based on a propensity score.
*   **Sequential Training Module:** (As per patent) – Trains a machine learning model sequentially across propensity bins. This model predicts the outcome of a treatment *given* user features and aggregate metrics.
*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent:** This is the core addition.
    *   **State:** The current propensity bin of the user, the user’s feature vector, and the aggregate metric (e.g., average predicted outcome across prior bins).
    *   **Action:**  A ‘treatment adjustment’ – a modification to the treatment parameters. This could be a discrete set of options (e.g., increase dosage, switch to alternative therapy, offer support intervention) or a continuous parameter adjustment.
    *   **Reward:** The observed outcome after applying the treatment adjustment. This could be a clinically defined metric (e.g., symptom reduction, positive test result) or a business metric (e.g. retention rate, increased purchases).
    *   **Policy:** The RL agent’s strategy for selecting actions based on the current state. This is learned through interactions with the environment (the user population).
*   **Treatment Application Module:**  Implements the treatment adjustment selected by the RL agent.
*   **Outcome Monitoring Module:** Tracks the outcome of the treatment and provides feedback to the RL agent.

**II. Training Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Training:** Pre-train the sequential training model (as in the patent) to establish a baseline prediction of treatment outcomes.
2.  **RL Agent Initialization:** Initialize the RL agent with the pre-trained model as its initial policy.
3.  **Iterative Training:**
    *   Select a user from a specific propensity bin.
    *   Observe the user’s state.
    *   The RL agent selects a treatment adjustment action based on its current policy.
    *   The treatment adjustment is applied to the user.
    *   The outcome is observed.
    *   The RL agent receives a reward based on the outcome.
    *   The RL agent updates its policy using a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, Policy Gradient).
4.  **Model Refinement:** Periodically update the sequential training model with the data generated by the RL agent to improve its predictive accuracy.

**III. Pseudocode (RL Agent Policy Update):**

```
# Initialize Q-table (or Policy Network)
Q = {} # or PolicyNetwork()

# For each episode (user interaction)
for episode in range(num_episodes):

    # Observe current state (propensity bin, user features, aggregate metric)
    state = observe_state()

    # Select action (treatment adjustment) based on current policy (e.g., epsilon-greedy)
    action = select_action(state, Q, epsilon)

    # Apply action
    apply_treatment(action)

    # Observe reward (outcome)
    reward = observe_reward()

    # Update Q-table (or Policy Network)
    Q[state, action] = Q[state, action] + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * max(Q[next_state, :]) - Q[state, action])

    #next_state = observe_next_state()
```

**IV. Key Considerations:**

*   **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Balancing the need to explore new treatment adjustments with the need to exploit known effective treatments.
*   **Reward Function Design:** Defining a reward function that accurately reflects the desired treatment outcomes.
*   **Safety Constraints:** Implementing safety constraints to prevent the RL agent from recommending harmful treatments.
*   **Personalized Treatment Pathways:**  Generating individualized treatment pathways based on the user's specific characteristics.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment of Propensity Bins:** Refining the propensity binning process over time based on the data generated by the RL agent.
