## Real-Time Query Rewriting & Synthetic Data Generation

**Concept:** Extend the shadow database concept to a proactive, real-time query rewriting system combined with synthetic data generation to preemptively identify and address performance bottlenecks *before* they impact production.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Production Database:** Standard operational database.
*   **Shadow Database (Extended):** Maintains schema and metadata like the original patent, but also actively ingests a stream of production query *signatures* (parsed query structure, not the data itself).
*   **Query Signature Analyzer:** Component that analyzes incoming query signatures.  It looks for patterns indicative of potential performance problems (full table scans, inefficient joins, missing indexes, etc.).
*   **Synthetic Data Generator:**  Generates synthetic data *targeted* at the problematic query patterns. The generator leverages the schema and metadata of the shadow database, but creates data specifically designed to trigger and expose the predicted performance issues.  Data volume is configurable.
*   **Performance Test Engine:** Executes the production query (or a modified version suitable for the shadow database) against the shadow database *with* the synthetic data.
*   **Performance Metrics Collector:** Gathers execution time, resource usage, and other relevant performance metrics.
*   **Rewrite Rule Engine:** Based on performance analysis, generates and applies query rewrite rules.  These rules can be tested against the shadow database before being deployed to production.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Tracks performance trends, alerts engineers to potential problems, and provides recommendations for optimization.

**2. Data Flow:**

1.  Production query is intercepted (sampling can be employed to reduce overhead).
2.  Query signature is extracted.
3.  Query signature is analyzed.
4.  If a problematic pattern is detected:
    *   Synthetic data generation is triggered, creating data tailored to expose the issue.
    *   Performance test engine executes the query against the shadow database with synthetic data.
    *   Performance metrics are collected.
    *   Rewrite rule engine generates potential rewrite rules.
    *   Rewrite rules are tested against the shadow database.
    *   Validated rewrite rules are proposed for deployment to production.
5.  If no problematic pattern is detected, the query signature is logged for future analysis.

**3. Pseudocode (Rewrite Rule Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateRewriteRules(querySignature, performanceMetrics):
  IF performanceMetrics.executionTime > threshold AND performanceMetrics.fullTableScan:
    rule = "Add index on column X in table Y"
  ELSE IF performanceMetrics.joinCost > threshold AND performanceMetrics.missingJoinIndex:
    rule = "Add index on join columns in tables A and B"
  ELSE IF performanceMetrics.filterCost > threshold AND performanceMetrics.missingFilterIndex:
    rule = "Add index on filter column C in table D"
  ELSE:
    rule = NULL // No obvious rewrite rule
  RETURN rule
```

**4.  Synthetic Data Generation Details:**

*   **Data Skewing:** Generate data distributions that exaggerate potential skew problems (e.g., one value appearing far more frequently than others).
*   **Volume Control:**  Allow for adjusting the volume of synthetic data to simulate various load conditions.
*   **Relationship Modeling:**  Maintain referential integrity and relationship constraints within the synthetic data.
*   **Data Type Preservation:**  Ensure that synthetic data adheres to the data types and formats defined in the database schema.

**5. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `SamplingRate`: Percentage of production queries to intercept.
*   `PerformanceThreshold`: Thresholds for execution time, resource usage, and other metrics.
*   `DataSkewFactor`: Parameter controlling the degree of data skew in synthetic data.
*   `SyntheticDataVolume`: Amount of synthetic data to generate.
*   `RewriteRuleDeploymentPolicy`: Options for deploying rewrite rules to production (e.g., automatic, manual review, A/B testing).
