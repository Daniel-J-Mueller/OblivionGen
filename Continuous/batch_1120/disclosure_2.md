## Dynamic Dependency Graph Reconstruction with Real-Time Telemetry

**Specification:** A system for dynamically reconstructing and updating the dependency graph used for reliability estimation, incorporating real-time telemetry data from running application components.

**Rationale:** The existing patent focuses on a static or periodically updated dependency graph. Real-world applications exhibit dynamic behavior – components start/stop, communication paths change, and unexpected dependencies emerge. Capturing this runtime dynamism significantly improves the accuracy of reliability estimation.

**System Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Agent:**  Installed on each component of the ad hoc application.  Collects:
    *   Component status (available, degraded, unavailable)
    *   Incoming/Outgoing network connections (source/destination IP/Port)
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O)
    *   Error rates/exception logs
2.  **Central Telemetry Collector:** Aggregates telemetry data from all agents.
3.  **Dependency Inference Engine:** 
    *   Analyzes telemetry data to identify runtime dependencies. 
    *   Utilizes correlation analysis: if component A consistently exhibits increased resource utilization or error rates when component B is active/experiencing issues, infer a dependency.
    *   Network connection analysis: active connections infer dependencies.
    *   Employs a Bayesian network to represent the dependency graph and update probabilities based on observed telemetry.
4.  **Dynamic Graph Updater:** Modifies the existing dependency graph based on the output of the Dependency Inference Engine. Adds new dependencies, removes stale ones, and adjusts dependency weights.
5.  **Reliability Estimation Module:** Utilizes the dynamically updated dependency graph for calculating the reliability estimate, as described in the original patent, but incorporates the weightings.

**Pseudocode (Dependency Inference Engine - simplified):**

```
function inferDependencies(telemetryData, existingGraph):
  newDependencies = []
  for componentA in telemetryData.components:
    for componentB in telemetryData.components:
      if componentA != componentB:
        correlationScore = calculateCorrelation(componentA.resourceUsage, componentB.resourceUsage)
        connectionActive = checkConnectionActive(componentA.ip, componentB.ip)

        if correlationScore > threshold OR connectionActive:
          if dependencyExists(existingGraph, componentA, componentB) == False:
            newDependencies.append((componentA, componentB, correlationScore))

  return newDependencies
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Component:**  `{id, ip, status, resourceUsage (CPU%, Memory%, etc.), errorRate}`
*   **Dependency:** `{sourceComponentId, destinationComponentId, weight (0.0 - 1.0)}` – Weight represents the strength of the dependency.
*   **Dependency Graph:**  A directed graph represented as an adjacency list, where each edge has a weight.

**Implementation Details:**

*   The `threshold` in the pseudocode would be determined through experimentation and calibration.
*   The `calculateCorrelation` function could use Pearson correlation, cross-correlation, or other suitable metrics.
*   The weight of each dependency could be updated over time based on the frequency and strength of observed correlations.
*   Anomaly detection techniques could be used to identify unusual telemetry patterns that may indicate emerging dependencies or failures.
*   The system must be scalable to handle a large number of components and telemetry data.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   More accurate reliability estimates.
*   Improved ability to detect and mitigate failures.
*   Adaptive to changing application behavior.
*   Proactive identification of potential bottlenecks and dependencies.
*   Facilitates automated root cause analysis.
