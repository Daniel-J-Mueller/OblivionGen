## Dynamic Illumination Mapping for Liveness Detection

**Core Concept:** Enhance liveness detection by actively modulating illumination patterns *beyond* simple on/off, creating a dynamic ‘light fingerprint’ unique to a 3D face, and extremely difficult to replicate with 2D images or displays.

**Specs:**

*   **Illumination System:** An array of micro-LEDs (minimum 5x5) integrated into the device bezel. Each LED is individually addressable and capable of varying intensity and color temperature.
*   **Projection Pattern Generator:** Software module that generates a sequence of structured light patterns. These patterns aren’t static; they’re designed to dynamically move across the face and change in intensity over time. Examples include:
    *   Rotating gradients
    *   Moving stripes
    *   Pseudo-random noise patterns
    *   Color shifts within the visible spectrum.
*   **Camera System:** High-resolution camera capable of capturing rapid image sequences (minimum 60 fps).  Global shutter preferred to minimize distortion.
*   **Homography & Feature Tracking:** Algorithm to track facial features in real-time, establishing a 3D facial map based on the illumination distortion.
*   **Light Field Reconstruction:** Software module that reconstructs a simplified "light field" representation of the captured facial illumination. This doesn't need full light field data, just sufficient information to determine the 3D surface normal.
*   **Liveness Score:**  A score derived from the correlation between the reconstructed light field and a baseline model of "live" facial illumination.  High correlation indicates a likely live face; low correlation suggests a 2D representation.
*   **Adaptive Illumination:** Illumination pattern dynamically adjusts based on ambient lighting conditions and detected facial features.  For example, in low light, the patterns might be brighter and more frequent.

**Pseudocode (Liveness Check):**

```
FUNCTION CheckLiveness():
  // 1. Activate Illumination Array with Dynamic Pattern
  ActivateIllumination(Pattern = GenerateDynamicPattern())

  // 2. Capture Image Sequence
  ImageSequence = CaptureImageSequence(Frames = 30)

  // 3. Extract Facial Features
  FacialFeatures = DetectFacialFeatures(ImageSequence)

  // 4. Reconstruct Light Field
  LightField = ReconstructLightField(ImageSequence, FacialFeatures)

  // 5. Calculate Liveness Score
  LivenessScore = CalculateLivenessScore(LightField, BaselineModel)

  // 6. Determine Liveness
  IF LivenessScore > Threshold:
    RETURN True // Live Face
  ELSE:
    RETURN False // Potential Spoof
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This surpasses existing liveness detection by going beyond detecting static reflections or shadows. It actively *creates* a complex illumination profile unique to a 3D face, making it exponentially harder to spoof with 2D images or even high-resolution displays. It does not simply *detect* lack of 3D, it *requires* a valid 3D response to its illumination.
