## Adaptive Shard Migration Based on Read/Write Ratios

**Concept:** Dynamically redistribute data shards across replica groups not based on load, but on *read/write ratio*. Groups experiencing consistently high write ratios become "write-heavy," potentially impacting read latency. This system proactively migrates shards to replica groups with demonstrably lower write ratios, maintaining a balanced read experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Monitoring Agent:** Each replica node runs a monitoring agent collecting read/write operation counts for every shard it hosts.  Data is aggregated locally over a configurable time window (e.g., 5 minutes).
*   **Global Coordinator:** A centralized service (or distributed consensus system) receives aggregated read/write ratios from all monitoring agents. It maintains a global view of shard distribution and associated read/write performance.
*   **Shard Migration Trigger:** The Global Coordinator evaluates if a shard’s current replica group's average write ratio exceeds a defined threshold (configurable per shard type). A sustained exceedance initiates migration.
*   **Destination Selection:**  The Coordinator identifies replica groups hosting the same shard, with a write ratio *below* a pre-defined lower threshold, and adequate free capacity.  A scoring function prioritizes destinations – lower write ratio gets higher weight, followed by available space, and network latency to client clusters.
*   **Migration Process:**
    1.  **Read-Only Phase:**  The source replica group transitions to read-only mode for the shard.
    2.  **Data Transfer:** Data is streamed (using a robust protocol like rsync) from the source to the destination replica group.  Checksum verification ensures data integrity.
    3.  **Write Redirection:** Client requests are transparently redirected to the destination replica group.
    4.  **Verification & Cutover:** The destination replica group is confirmed to be fully synchronized.  The source group is fully decommissioned for that shard.
*   **Lease Integration:** Leverage the existing lease mechanism. Upon shard migration, the *new* master of the destination replica group establishes a lease. The old master's lease is invalidated.
*   **Failure Handling:**  If data transfer or cutover fails, the process rolls back, and the shard remains on the source replica group.  Alerting mechanisms are triggered.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   `shard_migration_enabled`: Global flag to enable/disable migration.
    *   `high_write_ratio_threshold`: Trigger for migration (e.g., 0.7).
    *   `low_write_ratio_threshold`:  Minimum acceptable write ratio for destination groups (e.g., 0.2).
    *   `migration_window`: Time window for read/write ratio calculation (e.g., 5 minutes).
    *   `max_migration_concurrent`:  Maximum number of concurrent migrations.

**Pseudocode (Global Coordinator):**

```
for each shard:
    for each replica group hosting shard:
        read_writes = get_read_write_stats(replica_group, shard, migration_window)
        write_ratio = read_writes.writes / (read_writes.reads + read_writes.writes)
        if write_ratio > high_write_ratio_threshold:
            eligible_destinations = find_eligible_destinations(shard, write_ratio)
            if eligible_destinations:
                best_destination = select_best_destination(eligible_destinations)
                initiate_migration(shard, best_destination)
```

**Potential Improvements:**

*   **Predictive Migration:** Employ machine learning to predict future write ratios and proactively migrate shards *before* performance degradation occurs.
*   **Cost-Aware Migration:** Incorporate network bandwidth costs and data transfer rates into the destination selection process.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust `high_write_ratio_threshold` and `low_write_ratio_threshold` based on overall system load and resource availability.
