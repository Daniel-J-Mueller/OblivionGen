## Dynamic Obstacle Mapping & Predictive Landing Zone Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand beyond static parcel data and elevation models to incorporate real-time, dynamic obstacle mapping using onboard UAV sensors *combined* with predictive modeling of transient obstacles (people, animals, moving vehicles). This creates a constantly updating ‘safe landing zone’ probability map, allowing the UAV to intelligently select and *adjust* its landing location *during descent*.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** UAV equipped with:
    *   LiDAR (for detailed terrain mapping and obstacle detection) - range >50m
    *   RGB Camera (for visual obstacle identification – people, animals, etc.)
    *   Thermal Camera (for identifying warm bodies obscured by foliage or in low light)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - for precise altitude and attitude control
*   **Data Fusion Module:**
    *   Real-time integration of LiDAR point clouds, camera imagery, and IMU data.
    *   Utilize computer vision algorithms (object detection, semantic segmentation) to identify and classify obstacles.
    *   Obstacle data tagged with confidence level, size, and estimated trajectory (based on short-term tracking).
*   **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Employ a Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm to forecast the future position of moving obstacles.
    *   Model obstacle behavior (e.g., pedestrian walking patterns, vehicle speeds).
    *   Assign probability scores to potential obstacle intrusions within the landing zone.
*   **Landing Zone Probability Map:**
    *   Grid-based map representing the landing zone.
    *   Each cell assigned a probability score based on:
        *   Static obstacle data (buildings, trees, etc.)
        *   Dynamic obstacle probability (predicted intrusions)
        *   Slope and terrain roughness
        *   Parcel boundaries (priority weighting)
*   **Dynamic Landing Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   During descent, continuously update the landing zone probability map.
    *   Algorithm searches for the cell(s) with the highest combined probability score (low obstacle risk, suitable terrain).
    *   UAV adjusts its descent path and landing target in real-time, guided by the optimal cell(s).
    *   Algorithm considers minimum safe distance from detected obstacles.
    *   Fail-safe mechanism: if no suitable landing zone can be identified, initiate emergency landing procedure (pre-designated safe zone).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Landing Adjustment):**

```
function adjustLanding(sensorData, parcelData, elevationData):
  //Create landing zone probability map
  probabilityMap = createProbabilityMap(parcelData, elevationData)

  //Update map with sensor data
  obstacles = detectObstacles(sensorData)
  probabilityMap = updateMapWithObstacles(probabilityMap, obstacles)

  //Predict obstacle movements
  predictedObstacles = predictObstacleMovement(obstacles)
  probabilityMap = updateMapWithPredictedObstacles(probabilityMap, predictedObstacles)

  //Find optimal landing zone cell
  optimalCell = findOptimalCell(probabilityMap)

  //Adjust descent path
  adjustDescentPath(optimalCell)

  return optimalCell
```

**Expansion Potential:**

*   Integration with external data sources (e.g., local weather reports, traffic conditions) to further refine landing zone assessment.
*   Multi-UAV coordination – utilize a swarm of UAVs to collaboratively map and assess landing zones, sharing data in real-time.
*   Machine learning – train the predictive modeling algorithms on large datasets of obstacle behavior to improve accuracy and robustness.
