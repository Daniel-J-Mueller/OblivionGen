## Dynamic Hardware Partitioning & Resource Re-Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the idea of isolating errant client logic with a system for *dynamic* partitioning of the programmable logic device itself, coupled with automated resource re-allocation to healthy client logic. This goes beyond simply disabling a section; it actively reshuffles resources to maintain uptime and potentially absorb the functionality of the failing partition.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** A single FPGA (or similar programmable logic device) is partitioned into configurable “slices.” Each slice is capable of operating as a fully functional unit, and contains essential routing and control logic. The number of slices is configurable at manufacturing time.
*   **Resource Types:** Identifiable resource blocks within the FPGA include:
    *   Logic Elements (LEs/LUTs)
    *   Block RAM
    *   DSP Slices
    *   Dedicated I/O Pins
    *   Clocking Resources
*   **Monitoring & Control:** A dedicated “Resource Manager” module (implemented in programmable logic, separate from client and shell logic) continuously monitors the health of each slice. Health metrics include:
    *   Temperature
    *   Power Consumption
    *   Error Rates (e.g., Hamming code failures in Block RAM)
    *   Performance Metrics (latency, throughput)
*   **Dynamic Re-Allocation Algorithm:** When the Resource Manager detects a failing slice, it initiates a re-allocation process:
    1.  **Isolation:** Immediately isolates the failing slice (as described in the original patent).
    2.  **Resource Inventory:** Identifies available resources in healthy slices.
    3.  **Function Mapping:** Analyzes the functionality of the isolated slice. Attempts to map this functionality onto available resources in healthy slices. This might involve partial or complete replication of logic.
    4.  **Re-Routing & Configuration:** Dynamically re-routes connections and reconfigures the healthy slices to accommodate the new functionality. This is performed using configurable interconnects within the FPGA.
    5.  **Virtualization Layer Adaptation:** Updates any virtualization layers (e.g., hypervisors) to reflect the new resource allocation. This ensures that client virtual machines continue to operate seamlessly.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A high-bandwidth, low-latency communication protocol (e.g., AXI or similar) connects the Resource Manager to all slices. This protocol is used for monitoring, configuration, and data transfer.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** The Resource Manager itself should be implemented with redundancy and fault tolerance. This could involve replicating the Resource Manager on multiple slices.
*   **Prioritization:** A system for prioritizing which client logic gets resources when contention occurs. This could be based on service level agreements (SLAs), criticality, or other factors.
*   **Configuration:**  The number of slices, resource allocation policies, and prioritization rules are configurable via software.

**Pseudocode (Resource Manager):**

```
while (true) {
  for each slice in FPGA {
    health_metrics = monitor_slice(slice);
    if (is_slice_failing(health_metrics)) {
      isolate_slice(slice);
      functionality = analyze_slice(slice);
      available_resources = get_available_resources();

      if (can_reallocate(functionality, available_resources)) {
        reallocate_resources(functionality, available_resources);
        update_virtualization_layer();
      } else {
        log_error("Insufficient resources to reallocate");
        // Potentially trigger failover to a redundant system
      }
    }
  }
  sleep(1ms); // Monitoring frequency
}
```

This system offers a significant improvement in resilience and availability. It moves beyond simply isolating failing logic to actively mitigating the impact of failures by re-allocating resources and maintaining service continuity. It lends itself to highly dynamic workloads where failures are frequent or unpredictable, such as in cloud environments or edge computing deployments.
