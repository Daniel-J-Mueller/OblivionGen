## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Content Exploration

**Concept:** Augment the head-tracked content zoom/scale system with localized haptic feedback delivered through a wearable device (glove, wristband, or integrated headset) to provide tactile confirmation of content boundaries and features as the user navigates.

**Specs:**

*   **Device:** Lightweight wearable with array of micro-actuators capable of delivering varied intensity and frequency tactile stimuli. Wireless communication with the computing device.
*   **Tracking Integration:** System receives real-time head pose data (from the patent’s core technology) *and* hand/finger tracking data (via integrated sensors or separate tracking system).
*   **Content Mapping:**
    *   The system analyzes displayed content to identify key features (edges, text blocks, interactive elements, object boundaries).
    *   These features are mapped to specific locations on the wearable device's actuator array.
*   **Haptic Response Logic:**
    *   **Boundary Definition:** When the user’s gaze or hand approaches a content boundary (determined by head/hand tracking and content analysis), actuators on the wearable corresponding to that boundary activate with increasing intensity.
    *   **Feature Highlighting:**  As the user focuses on a specific content feature (e.g., a button, a text label), actuators corresponding to that feature activate with a distinct pattern (e.g., a pulse, a vibration).
    *   **Scale Indication:** Vary haptic intensity/frequency based on current zoom level. Higher zoom = more focused/precise haptic feedback. Lower zoom = broader/diffuse feedback.
    *   **Contextual Haptics:** Integrate haptic cues related to the *type* of content being interacted with. (e.g. rough texture for a map, smooth for a polished surface, clicks for a button).
*   **User Calibration:**  System allows for individual user calibration to optimize haptic intensity, frequency, and actuator mapping for comfort and effectiveness.
*   **Software API:** Provide a software API for developers to integrate custom haptic feedback patterns and integrate with specific applications.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (HeadTrackingDataAvailable AND HandTrackingDataAvailable) {
    HeadPose = GetHeadPose();
    HandPosition = GetHandPosition();
    ContentFeatures = AnalyzeContent(DisplayedContent);

    // Determine relevant content features near hand/gaze
    RelevantFeatures = FilterFeatures(ContentFeatures, HandPosition, HeadPose);

    // Map features to actuators
    ActuatorMap = GenerateActuatorMap(RelevantFeatures);

    // Calculate haptic intensity based on zoom level
    ZoomLevel = GetZoomLevel();
    HapticIntensity = CalculateHapticIntensity(ZoomLevel);

    // Activate actuators
    ActivateActuators(ActuatorMap, HapticIntensity);
}

function CalculateHapticIntensity(ZoomLevel) {
    // Linear mapping between zoom level and intensity
    Intensity = Map(ZoomLevel, MinZoom, MaxZoom, MinIntensity, MaxIntensity);
    return Intensity;
}
```

**Innovation:** The combination of head-tracked content scaling with localized haptic feedback enhances the user's sense of presence and control within a digital environment. It provides an intuitive and multi-sensory method for exploring content, improving accessibility and usability. It moves past simply scaling, by adding a tactile 'feel' of the content.
