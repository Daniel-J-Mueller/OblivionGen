## Dynamic Environmental Soundscapes

**Concept:** Extend the audio filtering capability to proactively *replace* undesirable sounds with contextually appropriate, dynamically generated soundscapes. Instead of simply removing a barking dog, the system generates ambient outdoor sounds (birds chirping, gentle breeze) scaled to the removed sound's duration and volume.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Real-time audio stream from device microphone.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Undesirable Sound Detection:** Utilize existing ML model (from patent) to identify undesirable sounds.
    *   **Soundscape Generation:**
        *   **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze available data (time of day, location data, user preferences) to determine appropriate soundscape theme (e.g., forest, beach, city park).
        *   **Dynamic Sound Element Selection:** From a library of sound elements (individual bird calls, wave sounds, traffic ambience), select elements that match the detected undesirable sound's characteristics (duration, frequency).
        *   **Sound Synthesis:** Generate a soundscape by combining selected elements, adjusting volume and panning to mask the removed sound. Utilize procedural audio generation techniques for realism.
    *   **Audio Mixing:** Seamlessly blend generated soundscape with remaining audio stream, ensuring natural transition.
*   **Output:** Modified audio stream with undesirable sounds replaced by dynamically generated soundscapes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processAudio(audioStream):
  undesirableSound = detectUndesirableSound(audioStream)

  if undesirableSound:
    context = getContextData() // Time, Location, User Preference
    soundscapeTheme = chooseSoundscapeTheme(context)
    soundElements = selectSoundElements(soundscapeTheme, undesirableSound)
    generatedSoundscape = synthesizeSoundscape(soundElements, undesirableSound)
    modifiedAudio = mixAudio(audioStream, generatedSoundscape)
    return modifiedAudio
  else:
    return audioStream
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-quality microphone.
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time audio analysis and synthesis.
*   Storage for sound element library.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Machine learning library for undesirable sound detection.
*   Procedural audio generation engine.
*   Audio mixing and processing library.
*   Contextual data integration module.
