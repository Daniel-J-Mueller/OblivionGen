## Adaptive Resource Prefetching via Predictive Domain Switching

**Concept:** Extend the domain allocation monitoring to *proactively* prefetch embedded resources from alternative domains *before* a request is even initiated, based on predicted network conditions and domain performance. This minimizes latency by having resources locally cached or in transit before they're needed.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Performance Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical performance data (latency, bandwidth, error rates) per domain for various embedded resource types. Real-time network condition data (estimated bandwidth, packet loss) obtained via active probing or network APIs. User behavioral data (browsing history, device type, location).
*   **Processing:**  A time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) predicts future performance for each domain based on historical data and current network conditions. A ‘resource demand profile’ is constructed based on user behavioral data, anticipating future embedded resource requests.  A ‘cost function’ is defined, balancing prediction accuracy, network cost (bandwidth usage), and caching resources.
*   **Output:** A prioritized list of domains for each embedded resource type, indicating the predicted performance and estimated cost for prefetching.

**2. Prefetching Engine:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated by the Predictive Performance Module.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Selects the top N domains for each embedded resource type based on the prioritized list.
    2.  Initiates prefetch requests for a subset of embedded resources anticipated by the resource demand profile.
    3.  Prefetch requests are sent to the selected domains *concurrently*.
    4.  Responses are cached locally (browser cache, edge servers).
    5.  Monitors prefetch request success rates, latency, and bandwidth usage.
*   **Adaptive Adjustment:** The number of prefetched resources and the selection of domains are dynamically adjusted based on monitoring data and changes in network conditions.  A 'confidence score' is calculated for each domain based on prefetch success rates, affecting future domain selection.

**3. Request Interception & Redirection:**

*   **Process:** When a request for an embedded resource is initiated, the system intercepts the request.
*   **Check:** It checks if the resource is already available in the local cache or in transit from a prefetched request.
*   **Redirection:** If available, the request is served from the cache/in-transit data.  If not, the request is routed to the currently selected domain (potentially overriding the original request).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Predictive Performance Module
function predictDomainPerformance(resourceType, domain, historicalData, networkConditions):
  // Apply time-series forecasting model
  predictedLatency = model.predict(historicalData, networkConditions)
  return predictedLatency

function prioritizeDomains(resourceType, domainList, historicalData, networkConditions):
  domainScores = {}
  for domain in domainList:
    latency = predictDomainPerformance(resourceType, domain, historicalData, networkConditions)
    domainScores[domain] = 1 / latency // Higher score for lower latency
  sortedDomains = sort(domainScores, descending=True)
  return sortedDomains

// Prefetching Engine
function prefetchResources(resourceList, domainList):
  for resource in resourceList:
    for domain in domainList:
      issue_prefetch_request(resource, domain)

// Request Interception & Redirection
function interceptRequest(request):
  resource = request.resource
  if resource is cached:
    serve_from_cache(resource)
  else:
    domain = select_best_domain(resource)
    route_request(request, domain)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DomainPerformanceRecord`: Stores historical latency, bandwidth, and error rates for each domain and resource type.
*   `ResourceDemandProfile`: Stores predicted frequency of requests for each resource type based on user behavior.
*   `PrefetchQueue`: Stores pending prefetch requests.
*   `Cache`: Stores prefetched resources.
