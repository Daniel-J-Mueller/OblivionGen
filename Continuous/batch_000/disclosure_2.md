## Adaptive Stroke Width Mapping for Dynamic Script Recognition

**Concept:** Expand the stroke width analysis to encompass not just character *presence*, but dynamic script characteristics (calligraphy, handwriting styles). This moves beyond simple glyph identification towards understanding *how* a glyph is formed, enhancing recognition in challenging scenarios (damaged documents, artistic fonts).

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Image input (as per existing patent).
    *   High-resolution capture preferred – facilitates finer stroke analysis.
    *   Preprocessing: Noise reduction, contrast enhancement.

2.  **Scan Segment Generation:**
    *   Horizontal, vertical, and diagonal scan segments (as per existing patent).
    *   Adaptive segment density: Adjust segment spacing based on image resolution and suspected script complexity. Higher resolution/complexity = denser segments.

3.  **Stroke Width Variation Mapping:**
    *   Shortest segment determination (as per existing patent).
    *   Introduce *directional* stroke width analysis: Calculate shortest segments *separately* for each scan direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
    *   **Key Innovation: Stroke Width Gradient Calculation:** For each point within a potential glyph region, determine the *change* in shortest segment length across the three scan directions. This forms a 3D vector representing the stroke width gradient.

4.  **Feature Vector Creation:**
    *   Mean and standard deviation of shortest segment lengths (as per existing patent).
    *   Mean and standard deviation of stroke width gradients.
    *   Dominant gradient direction (vector magnitude and angle).
    *   Histogram of gradient angles – captures the distribution of stroke directions within the glyph.

5.  **Script Style Classification:**
    *   Train a machine learning model (SVM, neural network, random forest) on a dataset of script samples labeled with style characteristics (e.g., “italic”, “bold”, “calligraphic”, “handwritten”, “printed”).
    *   The feature vector generated in step 4 serves as input to the model.
    *   The model outputs a probability distribution over the script styles.

6.  **OCR Enhancement:**
    *   Use the predicted script style to adjust OCR parameters. For example:
        *   Calligraphic styles: prioritize features related to curves and flourishes.
        *   Italic styles: adjust character slant compensation.
        *   Handwritten styles: employ more robust noise filtering.

7.  **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   Implement a feedback loop where the OCR accuracy is monitored.
    *   If accuracy falls below a threshold, dynamically adjust the weighting of the script style features in the OCR process.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function process_image(image):
  potential_glyphs = detect_potential_glyphs(image)
  for glyph in potential_glyphs:
    scan_segments = generate_scan_segments(glyph)
    stroke_width_gradient = calculate_stroke_width_gradient(scan_segments)
    feature_vector = create_feature_vector(stroke_width_gradient)
    script_style = classify_script_style(feature_vector)
    adjust_ocr_parameters(script_style)
    perform_ocr(glyph)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-resolution image sensors for optimal data capture.
*   Parallel processing capabilities for accelerating scan segment generation and feature vector calculation.
*   Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for training and deploying the script style classification model.
*   Cloud-based storage for storing large datasets of script samples.
