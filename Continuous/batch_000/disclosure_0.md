## Secure Dynamic Attestation with Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic attestation process beyond a centralized code measurement service, leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials to create a more robust, tamper-proof, and privacy-preserving attestation system.

**Specifications:**

**1. DID Generation & Binding:**

*   Upon initial code deployment within the TEE, a DID is generated for the specific protected function.  This DID becomes the unique identifier for the function's identity.
*   The DID is cryptographically linked to the code's measurement (hash) and stored securely (potentially within the HSM itself or a distributed ledger).  This forms the function's "digital birth certificate."
*   Code updates trigger a *new* DID generation, ensuring that only the latest, verified code is attested.

**2. Verifiable Credential Issuance:**

*   The code measurement service, acting as a Verifiable Credential Issuer (VCI), issues a Verifiable Credential (VC) linked to the DID. 
*   The VC contains:
    *   The DID of the protected function.
    *   The code measurement (hash).
    *   Attestation date/time.
    *   Issuer signature.
*   The VC is stored in a secure, tamper-proof repository (e.g., a distributed ledger or a secure enclave).

**3. Dynamic Attestation Process:**

*   When a request is made to invoke the protected function, the requester (client) obtains the function’s DID.
*   The requester queries the secure repository for the latest VC associated with the DID.
*   The requester *verifies* the VC:
    *   Validates the issuer’s signature.
    *   Confirms the DID within the VC matches the requested function.
    *   Optionally, checks revocation lists to ensure the VC has not been invalidated.
*   The verified code measurement is then sent to the HSM to unlock the secret for the function.

**4. Revocation Mechanism:**

*   A mechanism for revoking VCs is crucial. This could involve:
    *   Issuing a revocation list.
    *   Utilizing a revocation registry on the distributed ledger.
    *   Employing a “status list” within the VC itself.

**5. Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
FUNCTION InvokeProtectedFunction(functionID):
  // Obtain DID associated with functionID
  DID = GetDID(functionID)

  // Retrieve VC from secure repository
  VC = GetVerifiableCredential(DID)

  // Verify VC
  IF VerifyVerifiableCredential(VC) == FALSE:
    RETURN Error: "Attestation Failed"

  // Extract code measurement from VC
  codeMeasurement = ExtractCodeMeasurement(VC)

  // Send code measurement to HSM
  secret = HSM.UnlockSecret(codeMeasurement)

  // Execute protected function with secret
  result = ExecuteProtectedFunction(secret)

  RETURN result
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Decentralized attestation removes the single point of failure of a centralized code measurement service.
*   **Increased Trust:** DIDs provide a verifiable identity for the protected function, increasing trust in its integrity.
*   **Improved Privacy:** Selective disclosure of credentials allows the function to prove its identity without revealing unnecessary information.
*   **Interoperability:** DIDs are a W3C standard, promoting interoperability across different platforms and ecosystems.
