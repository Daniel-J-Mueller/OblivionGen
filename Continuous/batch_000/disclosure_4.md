## Dynamic Coverage-Guided Mutation Testing with AI-Driven Constraint Synthesis

**Specification:** A system to automatically generate mutated versions of a Design Under Test (DUT) and intelligently guide mutation testing using formal coverage feedback *and* AI-synthesized constraints, going beyond simply maximizing coverage.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of random or simplistic mutation, leverage the formal solver (as in the provided patent) *and* an AI to create mutations designed to challenge specific, formally identified “weak spots” in the DUT’s behavior.  These weak spots aren't just uncovered areas, but areas identified as having low resilience to change.

**Components:**

1.  **Formal Coverage Engine (FCE):**  Utilizes the formal solver to determine coverage metrics (as in the patent) *and* calculates a “Resilience Score” for each coverage point. Resilience Score measures how many small changes to input values would *break* that coverage point.  Low scores indicate fragile behavior.  This utilizes the existing formal verification infrastructure.

2.  **AI Mutation Generator (AIMG):**  A neural network trained on a dataset of successful and unsuccessful mutations (determined by whether they *increased* test suite effectiveness).  Input to the AIMG includes:
    *   The DUT’s architecture (represented as a graph).
    *   The coverage point's Resilience Score.
    *   The current state of the test suite (which mutations have already been tried).
    *   Constraint information about the DUT (obtained through formal analysis or provided by a designer).

    The AIMG outputs a *mutation strategy*—a set of instructions for modifying the DUT's RTL.  This isn’t just a random bit flip, but a directed change.

3.  **Constraint Synthesis Module (CSM):** This is a crucial addition.  The CSM takes the low Resilience Score coverage point and, using formal analysis (potentially leveraging SMT solvers), *automatically generates* additional constraints that, if *violated* by a mutation, would be highly indicative of a serious bug. These constraints are *not* about functional correctness (those are already covered by the test suite); they target subtle behavioral issues.

4.  **Mutation Execution & Test Harness:** The mutation is applied to a copy of the DUT. The existing test suite *and* tests automatically generated to evaluate the synthesized constraints are run against the mutated DUT.

5.  **Feedback Loop:** Results (test failures, constraint violations, coverage changes) are fed back to the AIMG to refine its mutation strategies.

**Pseudocode (AIMG):**

```
function generate_mutation_strategy(dut_architecture, resilience_score, test_suite_state):
  // Neural Network input: dut_architecture, resilience_score, test_suite_state
  mutation_type = neural_network.predict(input)

  if mutation_type == "logic_gate_replacement":
    gate_to_replace = select_gate_with_high_fanout(dut_architecture)
    replacement_gate = select_similar_gate(gate_to_replace)
    mutation_instruction = "replace gate " + gate_to_replace + " with " + replacement_gate

  elif mutation_type == "signal_connection_rerouting":
    signal_to_reroute = select_signal_with_high_connectivity(dut_architecture)
    new_destination = select_unused_port(dut_architecture)
    mutation_instruction = "connect signal " + signal_to_reroute + " to port " + new_destination

  elif mutation_type == "state_transition_modification":
    state_to_modify = select_state_with_low_coverage(dut_architecture)
    new_transition = generate_new_transition(state_to_modify)
    mutation_instruction = "modify transition in state " + state_to_modify + " to " + new_transition

  else:
    mutation_instruction = "no mutation"

  return mutation_instruction
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Resilience Score:** Moves beyond simple coverage metrics to identify *fragile* behavior.
*   **AI-Driven Mutation:**  Intelligently generates mutations designed to exploit weak spots.
*   **Constraint Synthesis:** Automatically creates tests for subtle behavioral issues.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Continuously refines mutation strategies.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved bug detection rates.
*   Reduced test suite size.
*   Increased confidence in DUT correctness.
*   Automated generation of targeted test stimuli.
