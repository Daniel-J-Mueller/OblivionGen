## Dynamic Key Sharding with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of encrypting a larger key with a smaller key to a system where the larger key is *sharded* – broken into multiple pieces – and each piece is encrypted with a different instance of the smaller key. These instances are then rotated over time, and older, encrypted shards are allowed to decay in usefulness, creating a constantly shifting security landscape.

**Specs:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Key Sharding Module:** Responsible for dividing the large (asymmetric) key into *n* equal-sized shards. The number *n* is configurable.
*   **Symmetric Key Rotation Engine:** Manages the generation and rotation of symmetric keys used to encrypt each shard.  Symmetric keys will have an associated Time-To-Live (TTL) value.
*   **Shard Encryption/Decryption Unit:** Encrypts individual shards with their assigned symmetric key and decrypts them during retrieval.
*   **Persistent Storage (Fuse-Based):** Stores the primary, smaller symmetric key (the root key).
*   **Non-Volatile Storage (Flash/EEPROM):** Stores the encrypted shards and their associated TTL metadata.
*   **Decay Management System:** Monitors TTL values and removes/archives shards that have exceeded their lifespan.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Key Generation:** Generate the asymmetric key. Divide it into *n* equal shards.
2.  **Symmetric Key Creation & Assignment:** The Symmetric Key Rotation Engine generates *n* unique symmetric keys. Each key is assigned to a specific shard.
3.  **Shard Encryption & Storage:** The Shard Encryption/Decryption Unit encrypts each shard with its assigned symmetric key.  The encrypted shard and its associated TTL are stored in Flash/EEPROM.
4.  **Key Retrieval & Decryption:** To reconstruct the asymmetric key:
    *   The system retrieves all encrypted shards.
    *   For each shard, it retrieves the corresponding symmetric key’s metadata from Flash/EEPROM.
    *   The shard is decrypted using its symmetric key.
    *   All decrypted shards are concatenated to reconstruct the complete asymmetric key.
5.  **Symmetric Key Rotation:** At predetermined intervals, the Symmetric Key Rotation Engine generates new symmetric keys.  These new keys encrypt *new* copies of the shards. The old, encrypted shards are flagged for decay.
6.  **Decay Management:** The Decay Management System periodically scans Flash/EEPROM for expired shards.  Expired shards are either removed entirely or archived for auditing purposes.

**3. Pseudocode (Decryption Process):**

```
function decryptAsymmetricKey():
    shardCount = getShardCount()
    decryptedShards = []

    for i = 0 to shardCount - 1:
        encryptedShard = readEncryptedShard(i)
        symmetricKeyMetadata = readSymmetricKeyMetadata(i)

        if symmetricKeyMetadata.isValid():
            symmetricKey = deriveSymmetricKey(symmetricKeyMetadata)
            decryptedShard = decrypt(encryptedShard, symmetricKey)
            decryptedShards.append(decryptedShard)
        else:
            // Handle invalid shard (e.g., log error, attempt recovery)
            logError("Invalid shard detected")
            // Attempt to retrieve a more recent version, or signal failure

    if len(decryptedShards) == shardCount:
        reconstructedKey = concatenate(decryptedShards)
        return reconstructedKey
    else:
        // Handle incomplete key reconstruction
        return error("Key reconstruction failed")
```

**4. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `shardCount`: Number of shards to divide the key into.
*   `symmetricKeyTTL`:  Time-To-Live for symmetric keys (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).
*   `rotationInterval`: Frequency of symmetric key rotation.
*   `archiveRetentionPeriod`:  Length of time to retain archived shards.
*   `encryptionAlgorithm`: The encryption algorithm used for shard encryption (e.g., AES-256).

**Novelty:** This design introduces a temporal element to key security.  Rather than a single, static encryption layer, it employs a dynamic system where the encryption of key fragments is constantly changing.  This significantly increases the difficulty for attackers, as they must compromise multiple encryption layers within a limited timeframe to reconstruct the key. The decay mechanism ensures that even if an attacker gains access to encrypted shards, those shards will eventually become useless without the current symmetric keys.
