## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Relocation

**Concept:** Extend the keymap system to not just *locate* data, but proactively *shard* and *relocate* it based on predicted access patterns. This goes beyond simply mapping keys to storage nodes; it anticipates where data *should* be to minimize latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Access Engine (PAE):**

*   **Input:**  Object access logs (timestamps, keys, originating client IP/location).
*   **Processing:** Employs time-series analysis and machine learning (LSTM networks recommended) to predict future access patterns for each object key.  Generates a "heat map" representing predicted access frequency over time windows (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).
*   **Output:**  A “relocation score” for each object key.  Higher scores indicate higher predicted access frequency and therefore, a greater need for relocation.  Also outputs predicted access location (geographic, network topology).

**2. Shard Management Service (SMS):**

*   **Function:** Responsible for dividing objects into multiple shards. Initial shard size configurable.
*   **Trigger:**  PAE generates a relocation score exceeding a defined threshold.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Selects the object for sharding/relocation.
    2.  Creates new shards of the object (number of shards configurable, optimized by storage node capacity).
    3.  Initiates data replication to new shards on storage nodes predicted to be closest to accessing clients.
    4.  Updates keymap information to point to the new shards.
    5.  Initiates a gradual migration of client connections to the new shards to minimize disruption.

**3. Adaptive Keymap Coordination:**

*   Modified keymap coordinators receive relocation scores from PAE.
*   Keymap coordinators prioritize cache entries based on relocation score.  Higher score = higher cache priority.
*   During request handling, keymap coordinators consider not just the current location of the shard, but also the predicted access location.  If there’s a significant mismatch, the coordinator proactively redirects the client to the predicted optimal shard.

**4. Quorum-Based Validation & Synchronization:**

*   The existing quorum-based analysis is extended to consider shard health and accessibility.
*   If a shard fails or becomes inaccessible, the system utilizes the quorum data to automatically rebuild the shard from other replicas.
*   During synchronization, the system prioritizes transferring data to nodes predicted to have higher future access rates.

**Pseudocode (Keymap Coordinator – Request Handling):**

```
function handleRequest(key):
  // Fetch keymap info from cache
  keymapInfo = cache.get(key)

  if keymapInfo is null:
    // Fetch keymap info from managers (as before)
    keymapInfo = fetchKeymapInfo(key)
    cache.put(key, keymapInfo)

  shardLocation = keymapInfo.shardLocation
  relocationScore = keymapInfo.relocationScore
  predictedAccessLocation = keymapInfo.predictedAccessLocation

  // Check for relocation opportunity
  if relocationScore > relocationThreshold and
     distance(shardLocation, predictedAccessLocation) > distanceThreshold:

    // Redirect client to predicted optimal shard
    redirectClient(predictedAccessLocation)
    return

  // Otherwise, forward request to current shard
  forwardRequest(shardLocation)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `KeymapInfo`:  {`shardLocation`, `relocationScore`, `predictedAccessLocation`, `shardId`, `version` }
*   `ShardMetadata`: {`shardId`, `location`, `health`, `capacity`, `version`}

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   PAE can be horizontally scaled using a message queue (e.g., Kafka) for ingestion of access logs.
*   Keymap coordinators can be distributed using consistent hashing.
*   Shards are replicated across multiple storage nodes for fault tolerance.
