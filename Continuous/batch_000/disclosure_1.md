## Adaptive Compartment & Climate Control System

**Concept:** Expand the modularity of the bag beyond simple size adjustment and thermal isolation. Introduce actively controlled micro-climates *within* individual compartments, alongside automated organization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Structure:**

*   **Material:** Primarily high-density, recyclable polyethylene fabric with integrated conductive threading.
*   **Panel Configuration:** Six-panel design (front, back, left, right, bottom, top) with modular attachment points.
*   **Frame:** Embedded flexible polymer ribs providing structural support without rigidity. These ribs incorporate channels for airflow and wiring.

**2. Compartment System:**

*   **Dynamic Dividers:**  Replace static dividers with dynamically adjustable panels. These panels utilize shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators controlled by a small onboard microcontroller.
*   **Actuation:** SMA wires embedded within the divider panels contract or expand when heated, altering the panel’s shape and position. This allows compartments to reconfigure on demand.
*   **Compartment Count:**  Initial configuration supports 3-6 independently adjustable compartments.
*   **Size Adjustment:** Compartments can expand/contract in width, height, and depth via SMA actuation.

**3. Climate Control System:**

*   **Peltier Modules:** Miniature Peltier thermoelectric coolers/heaters integrated into each compartment wall.
*   **Temperature Sensors:** Multiple temperature sensors within each compartment for precise monitoring.
*   **Microcontroller Control:**  Microcontroller regulates Peltier module operation based on sensor readings and user input.
*   **Cooling/Heating Range:** 0°C – 60°C (32°F – 140°F).
*   **Power Source:** Rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery pack integrated into the bag.  Solar charging panel optional.

**4. Automated Organization System:**

*   **RFID Tagging:**  Option to attach RFID tags to food containers.
*   **Compartment Assignment:**  User assigns container types (hot, cold, delicate) to specific compartments via a mobile app.
*   **Automated Adjustment:** The system automatically adjusts compartment size and temperature based on assigned container type.
*   **Container Detection:** System detects if a container is present in a compartment. If not, the compartment enters a low-power standby mode.

**5. User Interface & Control:**

*   **Mobile App:** Companion mobile app for controlling all bag functions (temperature, compartment size, RFID assignments, battery status).
*   **Voice Control:** Integration with voice assistants (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa).
*   **Haptic Feedback:**  Subtle vibration patterns to indicate status updates.

**Pseudocode (Compartment Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION adjustCompartment(compartmentID, targetSize)
    READ currentSize from compartmentID
    CALCULATE adjustmentNeeded = targetSize - currentSize
    ACTIVATE SMA actuators in compartmentID
    IF adjustmentNeeded > 0 THEN
        CONTRACT SMA actuators until currentSize = targetSize
    ELSE IF adjustmentNeeded < 0 THEN
        EXPAND SMA actuators until currentSize = targetSize
    END IF
    UPDATE compartmentID size data
END FUNCTION
```

**Future Considerations:**

*   **Humidity Control:** Integrate miniature dehumidifiers/humidifiers for optimal food preservation.
*   **Air Purification:** Incorporate HEPA filters for removing odors and contaminants.
*   **Smart Tracking:** GPS tracking and location-based services.
*   **Wireless Charging:**  Implement wireless charging for mobile devices.
*   **Integration with Food Delivery Services:**  Direct integration with food ordering platforms.
