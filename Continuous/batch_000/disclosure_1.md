## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Echo Mapping

**Concept:** Expand beyond directional sound *source* localization to reconstruct a dynamic, spatial “echo map” of an environment. This isn't about finding where sounds *come from*, but building a temporary 3D model of the room based on how sounds *bounce* off surfaces. 

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Microphone array (existing in patent), GPU with ray tracing capabilities, storage for temporal echo data (SSD recommended).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Data Acquisition:** Capture raw audio data from the microphone array.
    *   **SRP Enhancement:** Modified Steered Response Power algorithm. Instead of maximizing power at a single azimuth/elevation, track the power *decay* over time for multiple potential reflection paths. This allows differentiation between direct sound and reflections.
    *   **Temporal Echo Database:**  A data structure (e.g., Octree or KD-Tree) to store reflection data. Each node stores:
        *   Reflection Timestamp (when the echo was detected)
        *   Estimated Reflection Point (x, y, z coordinates – initially approximate)
        *   Reflection Intensity (signal strength)
        *   Surface Material Estimate (based on frequency response of the reflection – see Material Estimation Module)
    *   **Material Estimation Module:** Analyze the frequency spectrum of each reflection to infer the surface material it bounced off of (e.g., wood, glass, carpet). This is critical for rendering and simulation. Trained machine learning model using known material spectral signatures.
    *   **Spatial Reconstruction Engine:** Utilize the Temporal Echo Database to reconstruct a 3D point cloud representing the room’s surfaces.  Employ Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques to refine the estimated reflection points and create a coherent map.
    *   **Rendering/Visualization Module:**  Render the reconstructed 3D map using ray tracing.  Materials are visualized based on the Material Estimation Module's output. Implement real-time rendering for interactive visualization.
*   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

    ```pseudocode
    //Initialization
    Create Temporal Echo Database
    Initialize SLAM Algorithm

    //Main Loop (for each audio frame)
    {
        //1. Acoustic Data Acquisition: Capture audio frame
        audio_frame = capture_audio()

        //2. Apply Modified SRP to identify candidate reflection paths
        candidate_reflections = apply_modified_SRP(audio_frame)

        //3. For each candidate reflection:
        for each reflection in candidate_reflections:
        {
            // Estimate reflection point using SRP results
            estimated_point = estimate_reflection_point(reflection)

            // Estimate surface material
            material = estimate_surface_material(reflection)

            // Add reflection data to Temporal Echo Database
            add_to_database(timestamp, estimated_point, reflection.intensity, material)

            // Update SLAM Algorithm with new data
            SLAM_update(estimated_point)
        }

        //4. Render reconstructed 3D map
        render_map(Temporal Echo Database, SLAM_map)
    }
    ```

*   **Data Storage Requirements:** High.  Consider compression techniques for long-duration recordings.

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Virtual/Augmented Reality:  Create realistic acoustic environments.
    *   Robotics/Navigation:  Enable robots to "see" around corners using sound.
    *   Security/Surveillance:  Detect and track movement in obscured areas.
    *   Acoustic Modeling:  Simulate sound propagation in complex environments.

This is more than simple direction finding. It's about building a dynamic, spatial model of an acoustic environment through the analysis of reflections. The system "learns" the room's geometry *passively* through sound, opening up a range of novel applications.
