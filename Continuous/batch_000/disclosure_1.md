## Adaptive Audio Scene Reconstruction for Immersive Environments

**Concept:** Leveraging multi-channel audio component separation and timing data, not just for distribution, but to *reconstruct* a 3D audio scene on the receiving device, independent of the original source's spatialization. This allows for dynamic, user-adjustable immersive experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel audio stream conforming to the component separation protocol outlined in the base patent (frequency-split components, timed delivery). Metadata indicating *intended* source direction (azimuth/elevation) for each component is *not* required.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP or integrated audio processing within the receiving device.
*   **Scene Database:** A pre-populated or dynamically generated database of acoustic impulse responses (IRs) for various virtual “rooms” or environments (e.g., concert hall, forest, small bedroom). IRs capture the acoustic characteristics of a space.
*   **Spatialization Engine:**  A real-time spatialization engine that applies the selected IR to each audio component based on *calculated* virtual source positions. These positions are *not* pre-defined but derived from component characteristics and user input.
*   **Component Analysis:** The DSP analyzes each incoming audio component (frequency bands) to infer its likely origin. This isn’t about identifying the *instrument* playing, but its virtual *location* within the reconstructed scene.
    *   High-frequency components are assumed to originate from closer, more direct sources.
    *   Low-frequency components are assumed to be more diffuse and originate from further away, or reflected surfaces.
    *   Spectral characteristics of components (e.g., brightness, harmonic content) influence probability weighting of origin location.
*   **Dynamic Scene Adjustment:** User interaction (e.g., head tracking, hand gestures) influences the scene reconstruction.
    *   Head Tracking: Changes the listener's virtual position within the scene, triggering real-time re-rendering of the audio with adjusted IRs.
    *   Gestural Control: Allows the user to "move" virtual sound sources within the reconstructed scene, altering the soundstage.  For example, a swipe could simulate moving a sound source closer or further away.
*   **Output:** Multi-channel audio output (stereo, 5.1, 7.1, ambisonics) representing the reconstructed 3D audio scene.
*   **Latency Management:**  Critical. Utilize the buffering mechanism described in the base patent to compensate for network latency. Implement adaptive buffering to prioritize real-time responsiveness.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Spatialization Engine):**

```
function spatialize_component(component_data, playback_time, virtual_position, room_ir):
  // Apply room impulse response to audio component
  convolved_signal = convolve(component_data, room_ir)

  // Apply delay based on virtual position (distance from listener)
  delay_samples = calculate_delay(virtual_position, speed_of_sound)
  delayed_signal = shift(convolved_signal, delay_samples)

  // Apply gain based on distance (inverse square law)
  distance = calculate_distance(virtual_position, listener_position)
  gain = 1.0 / (distance * distance)
  scaled_signal = scaled_signal * gain

  return scaled_signal
```

**Innovation:**  The core innovation is shifting from *transmitting* a spatialized audio mix to transmitting the *building blocks* of a spatialized experience. The receiving device *creates* the immersive environment, offering unparalleled user control and adaptation. This decouples the mixing process from the delivery process and allows for a dynamic, personalized listening experience.  It moves beyond simply hearing where sound *was* mixed to experiencing it *around* you, tailored to your location and preferences.
