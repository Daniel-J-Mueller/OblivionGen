## Dynamic Trust Level Adjustment via Biometric Drift

**Concept:** Expand on the trusted device concept by incorporating continuous biometric authentication and dynamically adjusting a device's trust level based on observed biometric drift. This goes beyond static trust assignments and introduces a layer of real-time behavioral analysis to enhance security.

**Specs:**

**1. Core System Components:**

*   **Biometric Data Acquisition Module:** Integrated into primary (mobile) devices. Captures continuous biometric data: keystroke dynamics, gait analysis (if mobile), subtle touchscreen interactions, microphone input analysis (voice stress, background noise patterns). Data is *not* stored long-term; only analyzed in rolling windows.
*   **Behavioral Baseline Generator:**  Upon initial user enrollment, establishes a baseline behavioral profile from collected biometric data. This baseline represents ‘normal’ behavior.
*   **Drift Detection Engine:** Constantly compares current biometric data streams to the established baseline. Uses anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Autoencoders) to identify deviations – ‘drift’ – from normal behavior.
*   **Dynamic Trust Level Adjuster:** Modifies the trust level assigned to the primary device based on the magnitude and frequency of detected biometric drift.  Higher drift = lower trust.
*   **Secondary Device Integration:**  Existing functionality (code presentation, authentication data transfer) remains. However, authentication success now requires both device identification *and* a satisfactory trust level score from the primary device.
*   **Adaptive Challenge System:** If trust levels fall below a threshold, triggers additional authentication challenges (e.g., multi-factor authentication prompts, security questions).
*   **Privacy Preservation Layer:** All biometric data is processed locally on the device, and only aggregated drift scores are transmitted to the server. Raw biometric data *never* leaves the device. Encryption & differential privacy techniques will be employed.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  User enrolls, establishing a behavioral baseline for their primary device.
2.  User attempts to access a resource via a secondary device.
3.  Secondary device displays a code.
4.  Primary device captures the code/authentication data.
5.  Drift Detection Engine analyzes biometric data *concurrently* with the authentication process.
6.  Dynamic Trust Level Adjuster adjusts the primary device's trust score.
7.  Network server assesses both device identification *and* trust score.
8.  If trust score is acceptable, authentication succeeds. If not, adaptive challenges are triggered.

**3. Pseudocode (Drift Detection & Trust Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
//Initialization
baseline_profile = create_baseline_biometric_profile(user_data)

//Continuous Monitoring Loop (executed on primary device)
while (device_active):
  current_biometric_data = capture_biometric_data()
  drift_score = calculate_drift_from_baseline(current_biometric_data, baseline_profile)

  //Trust Level Adjustment (Example: Simple linear scaling)
  trust_level = max(0, 1 - (drift_score * 0.5)) //Scale drift score to affect trust
  
  //Transmit trust_level to network server alongside authentication data
  transmit(trust_level, authentication_data)
```

**4. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Modern smartphones already possess necessary sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes, microphones, touchscreens).
*   Dedicated biometric processing units (NPUs) on mobile devices will accelerate drift detection.
*   Secure Enclaves for biometric data protection.

**5. Future Extensions:**

*   **Social Biometrics:** Incorporate data from user’s social network activity to refine behavioral profiles.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Adjust trust levels based on location, time of day, network environment.
*   **Federated Learning:** Train drift detection models across a fleet of devices without centralizing biometric data.
