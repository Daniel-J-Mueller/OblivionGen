## Adaptive Kernel Sparsity with Dynamic Re-tiling

**Concept:** Enhance transposed convolution performance by dynamically adjusting kernel sparsity *and* re-tiling strategies based on real-time activation patterns. The existing patent focuses on data movement and addressing, but doesn't explicitly address optimizing the computational graph itself. This idea aims to reduce FLOPs directly, adapting to varying input data characteristics.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Sparsity Control Unit (SCU):** A dedicated hardware module integrated within the neural network accelerator. This unit monitors activation data *during* convolution execution.
*   **Dynamic Re-tiling Engine (DRE):**  A hardware module capable of adjusting the tile size of both weight and input data on-the-fly. Must support non-square tile sizes.
*   **Fine-Grained Activation Monitor (FGAM):**  An array of comparators and counters within the systolic array to track the magnitude (or variance) of activations.
*   **Sparsity Mask Generator (SMG):** Generates dynamic sparsity masks for weights and activations.

**II. Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Activation Profiling:**  The FGAM continuously monitors activation magnitudes within tiles. A threshold is dynamically adjusted based on a running average of activation values.  Activations below the threshold are considered "inactive."
2.  **Sparsity Mask Generation:** The SMG creates a mask based on inactive activations.  Weights corresponding to inactive activations are masked out.
3.  **Dynamic Re-tiling:**
    *   The DRE analyzes activation patterns within tiles.
    *   If a tile exhibits high inactivity, the tile size is *increased* (coarser granularity) to reduce data transfer overhead.
    *   If a tile exhibits high activity, the tile size is *decreased* (finer granularity) to expose more parallelism and minimize wasted computation.  Non-square tile sizes can be used to optimize for specific layer geometries.
4.  **Sparse Convolution Execution:** The systolic array performs convolution using the generated sparsity masks and the dynamically adjusted tile sizes.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The FGAM, DRE, and SMG work in a continuous feedback loop, adapting to changing activation patterns throughout the convolution operation.

**III. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Inside systolic array execution loop for each tile:
function process_tile(weight_tile, input_tile, output_tile):
  activation_data = calculate_activations(weight_tile, input_tile)
  sparsity_mask = generate_sparsity_mask(activation_data, threshold)
  masked_weights = apply_mask(weight_tile, sparsity_mask)
  
  //Dynamic tiling adjustment based on activation statistics
  if (average(activation_data) < inactivity_threshold):
    tile_size = increase_tile_size(tile_size) //coarser
  else:
    tile_size = decrease_tile_size(tile_size) //finer

  output_tile = perform_convolution(masked_weights, input_tile, tile_size)
  return output_tile
```

**IV. Considerations:**

*   Overhead of dynamic mask generation and tile size adjustment must be minimized through hardware acceleration.
*   The `inactivity_threshold` must be carefully tuned to balance sparsity and accuracy.
*   Requires changes to the memory controller to support dynamic tile sizes.
*   Potentially beneficial for layers with sparse activations (e.g., ReLU-activated layers).
