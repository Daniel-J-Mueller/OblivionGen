## Dynamic Workflow Synthesis from Multi-Modal Event Data

**Specification:** A system for constructing and refining workflow descriptions not solely from log data, but integrating data from real-time sensor streams and user interaction events. This expands beyond post-execution analysis to *proactive* workflow adaptation.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Event Collector:** Accepts event streams from diverse sources:
    *   Traditional Log Data (as in the provided patent)
    *   Real-Time Sensor Data (e.g., system performance metrics, network latency, environmental sensors)
    *   User Interaction Data (e.g., GUI clicks, API calls, voice commands)
2.  **Contextual Event Embedding:**  Transforms raw event data into a unified vector space. This utilizes:
    *   **Time-Series Analysis:** Extracts temporal features from sensor data.
    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  Parses log messages and user input for semantic meaning.
    *   **Event Type Categorization:** Assigns each event to a predefined category (e.g., data access, calculation, user input).
3.  **Probabilistic Workflow Graph Builder:** Constructs a probabilistic workflow graph representing potential execution paths. 
    *   Nodes represent event types/categories.
    *   Edges represent probabilistic transitions between event types, weighted by the frequency of co-occurrence and contextual similarity (derived from embedded event vectors).
    *   Initial graph constructed from historical data.
4.  **Adaptive Graph Refinement Engine:**  Dynamically refines the workflow graph *during* execution.
    *   **Real-Time Feedback:** Incorporates incoming event data to adjust edge weights and node activations.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies deviations from expected workflow patterns using statistical analysis and machine learning.
    *   **Prediction Engine:** Predicts the most likely next event based on the current state of the graph and incoming data.
    *   **Graph Mutation:** Allows the graph to evolve – adding/removing nodes/edges – based on the prediction error.  A genetic algorithm can be employed here.
5.  **Workflow Description Generator:** Translates the refined workflow graph into an executable workflow description.  This description incorporates not only the sequence of events but also the contextual information (sensor data, user input) that influenced the execution path.
6.  **Execution Engine:** Executes the generated workflow description, leveraging the contextual information to optimize performance and adapt to changing conditions.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Graph Refinement Engine):**

```
function refine_graph(current_graph, incoming_event, sensor_data, user_input):
  // 1. Update Node Activations
  activate_node(current_graph, incoming_event)

  // 2. Calculate Edge Weights
  weight = calculate_edge_weight(current_graph, activated_node, next_possible_node, sensor_data, user_input)

  // 3. Update Graph
  update_edge_weight(current_graph, activated_node, next_possible_node, weight)

  // 4. Anomaly Detection
  anomaly_score = detect_anomaly(current_graph, incoming_event, sensor_data, user_input)

  // 5. Prediction
  predicted_next_event = predict_next_event(current_graph)

  // 6. Mutation (if anomaly_score > threshold)
  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    mutate_graph(current_graph, incoming_event, predicted_next_event)

  return current_graph
```

**Innovation:** This system goes beyond inferring workflows from *past* events. It learns and adapts *during* execution, incorporating real-time data to create highly dynamic and responsive workflows. This is particularly valuable in complex systems where conditions change frequently and predictable behavior is difficult to achieve.  The multi-modal input allows for a more nuanced understanding of the system's state and enables the creation of workflows that are truly context-aware.
