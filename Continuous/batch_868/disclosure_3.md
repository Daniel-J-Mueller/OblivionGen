## Dynamic Policy Orchestration via Federated Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the device policy framework to incorporate real-time device health and security posture, dynamically adjusting permissions based on federated attestation data from multiple trusted sources. This goes beyond static metadata and policy conditions, providing granular, context-aware access control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Attestation Broker Service:**

*   **Function:**  A central service responsible for collecting, validating, and aggregating attestation data from various sources.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Device-Native Attestation:** TPM/Secure Enclave reports on boot integrity, software versions, and cryptographic keys.
    *   **Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR):** Threat intelligence feeds indicating known vulnerabilities or malicious activity.
    *   **Network Access Control (NAC):**  Information on network compliance, patching levels, and firewall configurations.
    *   **Identity Provider (IdP):** User risk scores based on behavioral analytics and authentication history.
*   **Data Format:** Standardized attestation reports (e.g., SPIFFE/SPIRE) with verifiable signatures.
*   **API:** RESTful API for receiving attestation data and querying aggregated security posture.

**2. Policy Decision Point (PDP) Enhancement:**

*   **Integration:** Modify the existing PDP to consume attestation data from the Attestation Broker.
*   **Policy Language Extension:** Introduce new policy operators and functions for evaluating attestation claims. Examples:
    *   `attestation.verified_boot()`:  Returns true if the device has a verified boot chain.
    *   `attestation.vulnerability_score() < threshold`:  Checks if a device's vulnerability score is below a defined threshold.
    *   `attestation.compliance_status() == "compliant"`:  Verifies if the device meets specific compliance requirements.
*   **Dynamic Policy Assembly:**  PDP dynamically assembles policies based on real-time attestation data.  A device with a high vulnerability score might be granted limited access, while a compliant device receives full permissions.

**3. Device Agent Integration:**

*   **Attestation Reporting:** Install a lightweight agent on each device to collect and report attestation data to the Attestation Broker.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Agent receives updated policies from the PDP and enforces them locally.
*   **Local Caching:** Cache policies locally to minimize latency and ensure continued operation even during network outages.

**4. Pseudocode - PDP Policy Evaluation:**

```
function evaluatePolicy(request, deviceId) {
  // 1. Retrieve device metadata and policy document
  metadata = getDeviceMetadata(deviceId);
  policyDocument = getDevicePolicyDocument(deviceId);

  // 2. Retrieve attestation data from Attestation Broker
  attestationData = getAttestationData(deviceId);

  // 3. Evaluate policy conditions, incorporating attestation data
  // Example:
  if (attestationData.vulnerability_score() > 5 && policyDocument.resource == "sensitive_data") {
    return "deny";
  }

  // Evaluate existing policy conditions based on metadata
  // ...

  // If all conditions are met, return "allow"
  return "allow";
}
```

**5. Scalability & Resilience:**

*   **Distributed Attestation Broker:** Deploy multiple instances of the Attestation Broker in a high-availability cluster.
*   **Caching:** Implement aggressive caching at all levels (PDP, Device Agent) to reduce load and improve performance.
*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Use message queues (e.g., Kafka) for communication between components.

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond static policy enforcement towards a dynamic, risk-adaptive access control system. By integrating real-time device health and security posture, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface and improve their overall security posture. The federated attestation approach enables trust across heterogeneous environments and reduces reliance on single points of failure.
