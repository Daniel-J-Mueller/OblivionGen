## Dynamic Data Tiering with Predictive Prefetching & Autonomous Key Rotation

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of creating multiple encrypted volumes to introduce *dynamic* data tiering, predictive prefetching, and autonomous key rotation based on access patterns and data sensitivity. The system moves data blocks between storage tiers (e.g., fast NVMe, slower HDD, object storage) and dynamically adjusts encryption keys based on observed threats *and* predicted access.

**Specifications:**

**1. Tier Definitions & Policies:**

*   **Tier 0 (Hot):** NVMe/Fast SSD – High-performance, frequently accessed data.
*   **Tier 1 (Warm):** HDD/Slower SSD – Moderate access, larger datasets.
*   **Tier 2 (Cold):** Object Storage (e.g., S3) – Infrequent access, archival.
*   **Policy Engine:**  Configurable rules defining tier transitions based on:
    *   Access frequency (hits/second).
    *   Data sensitivity (assigned risk score).
    *   Storage cost.
    *   Predicted access (see Predictive Prefetching).

**2. Predictive Prefetching Module:**

*   **AI/ML Model:**  Trained on historical access patterns.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** Configurable time window for predicting future access.
*   **Prefetch Trigger:**  When predicted access probability exceeds a threshold, data is proactively moved to a faster tier.
*   **Prefetch Granularity:** Block-level prefetching.

**3. Autonomous Key Rotation System:**

*   **Threat Intelligence Feed:** Integration with external threat intelligence sources.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitors access patterns for suspicious behavior.
*   **Rotation Trigger:** Based on:
    *   Time-based intervals.
    *   Threat intelligence alerts.
    *   Anomaly detection events.
*   **Key Derivation:** Uses a key derivation function (KDF) to generate new keys from a master key and data-specific salt.
*   **Re-encryption:** Re-encrypts data blocks with the new key during periods of low activity.
*   **Key Versioning:** Maintains a history of key versions for auditability.
*   **Key Access Control:** Restricts access to encryption keys based on user roles and permissions.

**4. Transform Fleet Integration:**

*   **Extended Transform Instances:**  Modified to support tier transitions and key rotation.
*   **Data Movement Controller:**  Manages the movement of data blocks between tiers.
*   **Encryption/Decryption Orchestrator:**  Handles encryption and decryption operations during tier transitions and key rotations.

**5. System Architecture:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop - For each incoming Block Request
function HandleBlockRequest(block_id, user_id):
  // 1. Check Cache
  if block_id in cache:
    return cached_block

  // 2. Determine Current Tier
  tier = GetBlockTier(block_id)

  // 3. Access Data (Based on Tier)
  if tier == "Hot":
    data = ReadFromNVMe(block_id)
  else if tier == "Warm":
    data = ReadFromHDD(block_id)
  else:
    data = ReadFromObjectStorage(block_id)

  // 4. Decrypt Data
  key = GetEncryptionKey(block_id)
  decrypted_data = Decrypt(data, key)

  // 5. Predictive Prefetching (Background Task)
  PredictFutureAccess(block_id) //Analyze access to inform prefetching and tiering

  // 6. Autonomous Key Rotation (Background Task)
  if RotationTriggered(block_id):
    RotateKey(block_id) //Generate new key and re-encrypt data

  // 7. Return Data
  return decrypted_data

// Background Tasks
function PredictFutureAccess(block_id):
  // Utilize AI/ML model to predict future access patterns
  predicted_access = AIModel.Predict(block_id)
  if predicted_access > threshold:
    MoveToHotTier(block_id)

function RotateKey(block_id):
  // Generate new key and re-encrypt data
  new_key = KeyDerivationFunction(master_key, block_id)
  encrypted_data = Encrypt(data, new_key)
  StoreKey(block_id, new_key)
  UpdateKeyVersion(block_id)
```

**6.  Data Structures:**

*   **Block Metadata:** Contains information about each block, including:
    *   Block ID
    *   Current Tier
    *   Encryption Key ID
    *   Access Timestamp
    *   Access Count
*   **Tier Policy Table:** Defines rules for tier transitions.
*   **Key Management Database:** Stores encryption keys and metadata.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Optimized storage costs by leveraging different storage tiers.
*   Improved performance through predictive prefetching.
*   Enhanced security through autonomous key rotation.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing access patterns and threat landscape.
