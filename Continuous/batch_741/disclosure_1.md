## Adaptive Operation Graph Mutation for Predictive Authorization

**Concept:** Extend the directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach to authorization by introducing a mechanism for *mutating* the authorization graph based on observed authorization outcomes and predictive modeling. This allows the system to proactively adjust authorization policies and improve accuracy over time, rather than relying solely on static configurations.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Authorization Graph (AG):**  A directed acyclic graph representing the flow of authorization checks (service operations) for a given operation request.  (As defined in the provided patent).
*   **Mutation History (MH):**  A time-series database storing historical mutations applied to AGs, along with associated metadata (timestamp, user, operation, outcome – success/failure, confidence level).
*   **Predictive Model (PM):**  A machine learning model (e.g., Bayesian Network, Decision Tree, Neural Network) trained on the Mutation History and operational data.  The PM predicts the likelihood of authorization success/failure for a given operation request *before* the AG is fully traversed. It also suggests potential mutations to the AG.
*   **Confidence Score (CS):**  A numerical value representing the PM’s confidence in its prediction.

**2. Functional Components:**

*   **Authorization Engine (AE):**  Responsible for traversing the AG and invoking service operations for authorization.  (Existing component).
*   **Mutation Manager (MM):**  Monitors AE execution, collects outcome data (success/failure, time taken, resource usage), and interacts with the PM.
*   **Predictive Analyzer (PA):**  Hosts the PM and provides prediction/mutation suggestions to the MM.
*   **Graph Modifier (GM):**  Responsible for applying mutations to the AG.  Mutations can include:
    *   Adding new service operations to the graph.
    *   Removing existing service operations.
    *   Re-ordering service operations.
    *   Adjusting the weights/priorities of service operations.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Request Received:** A request for an operation is received.
2.  **AG Selection:** The appropriate AG is selected (based on the operation type).
3.  **Prediction Phase:**
    *   The PA receives request parameters and the current AG.
    *   The PA uses the PM to predict the authorization outcome and suggest potential AG mutations.
    *   The PA returns a prediction score (PS) and a mutation suggestion (MS) to the MM.
4.  **Mutation Application:**
    *   The MM evaluates the PS and MS.  If the PS is below a certain threshold *and* the MS has a sufficient confidence level, the MM instructs the GM to apply the mutation to the AG.
    *   The mutated AG is used for authorization.
5.  **Authorization Execution:**  The AE traverses the (potentially mutated) AG and invokes service operations for authorization.
6.  **Outcome Collection:**  The MM collects the authorization outcome (success/failure, metrics) and appends it to the MH.
7.  **Model Training:**  The PA periodically retrains the PM using the accumulated data in the MH.

**4. Pseudocode (Mutation Manager - Core Logic):**

```
function handleAuthorizationRequest(request, authorizationGraph) {
  prediction = predictiveAnalyzer.predict(request, authorizationGraph);
  if (prediction.confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD && prediction.mutation != null) {
    mutatedGraph = graphModifier.applyMutation(authorizationGraph, prediction.mutation);
    authorizationResult = authorizationEngine.authorize(request, mutatedGraph);
    mutationHistory.append(request, authorizationResult, prediction.mutation);
  } else {
    authorizationResult = authorizationEngine.authorize(request, authorizationGraph);
    mutationHistory.append(request, authorizationResult, null); // No mutation
  }
  return authorizationResult;
}
```

**5.  Advanced Considerations:**

*   **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Implement a mechanism to balance exploration (trying new mutations) with exploitation (using proven mutations).
*   **User Profiles:**  Incorporate user profiles into the PM to personalize authorization policies.
*   **Resource Awareness:** Integrate resource usage data into the PM to dynamically adjust authorization policies based on system load.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Use the PM to detect anomalous authorization requests and flag them for further investigation.
