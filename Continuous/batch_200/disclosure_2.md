## Adaptive Luminescence for Fabric Integration

**Concept:** Integrate the stowed reading light’s core functionality – focused, adjustable light – into fabric itself, creating “smart textiles” capable of providing localized illumination. This moves beyond a discrete light *within* a space to light *as* part of the material.

**Specs:**

1.  **Light Source:** Utilize micro-LEDs – ideally, flexible, stretchable versions – woven *directly* into the fabric structure. Density: 200 LEDs per square decimeter (adjustable).  LED size: 0.5mm x 0.5mm x 0.1mm. Color temperature adjustable via software control (2700K-6500K).

2.  **Power & Control:**
    *   Fabric-integrated conductive threads (silver-coated nylon) form the power grid. Threads must withstand at least 1000 bending cycles without breakage.
    *   A thin, flexible battery pack (LiPo, 3.7V, capacity adjustable based on fabric area) is integrated within the fabric’s lining or a dedicated pocket. Wireless charging capable.
    *   Microcontroller (ESP32 or similar) integrated, managing power distribution, LED control, and communication.
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity for smartphone/device control.
    *   Gesture control via capacitive sensors woven into the fabric (optional).

3.  **Fabric Integration:**
    *   LEDs and conductive threads are encapsulated in a flexible, transparent polymer coating for protection and diffusion. This coating *must* be breathable and washable.
    *   Fabric base material:  Polyester/Spandex blend for stretch and durability.
    *   LED/thread arrangement:  Warp and weft weaving pattern, allowing for directional illumination control.  Variable density zones possible.
    *   Fabric thickness: Maximum 2mm, maintaining a comfortable feel.

4.  **Illumination Control:**
    *   **Focusing Mechanism:**  Micro-lens array woven into the fabric above the LEDs. Individual lenses can be controlled via micro-actuators (piezoelectric or shape-memory alloy) to adjust beam direction and focus.  Lens pitch: 2mm.  Actuation range: +/- 15 degrees.
    *   **Dimming:** PWM control of LED current via microcontroller.
    *   **Zones:** Divide the fabric into independently controllable illumination zones. (e.g., a reading zone for a headrest, ambient light for the surrounding area).

5.  **Applications:**
    *   Aircraft cabin lighting.
    *   Automotive interior lighting.
    *   Smart clothing (jackets, hats, etc.).
    *   Adaptive furniture (chairs, headboards, etc.).
    *   Emergency lighting integrated into tents or blankets.

**Pseudocode (Zone Control):**

```
// Define zones (coordinates and LED IDs within each zone)
Zone readingZone = { x: 0, y: 0, width: 20, height: 10, leds: [1-200] };
Zone ambientZone = { x: 20, y: 0, width: 10, height: 10, leds: [201-300] };

// Function to set zone brightness
function setZoneBrightness(zone, brightness) {
  for each led in zone.leds {
    setLedBrightness(led, brightness);
  }
}

// Function to toggle zone on/off
function toggleZone(zone) {
  if (getZoneBrightness(zone) == 0) {
    setZoneBrightness(zone, 100); // Full brightness
  } else {
    setZoneBrightness(zone, 0); // Off
  }
}

//Example
toggleZone(readingZone);
```
