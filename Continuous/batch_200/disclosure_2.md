## Adaptive Content Stitching & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand beyond pre-selecting links to proactively *stitch together* content fragments anticipated to form a user’s complete browsing experience, and prefetches these fragments *before* the user initiates interaction. This system learns not just *what* users click, but *how* they navigate *within* a page and across linked pages, constructing likely content flows.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Collection Layer – “Behavioral DNA” Profiler:**

*   **Granular Interaction Logging:** Capture *all* user interactions – clicks, scrolls (speed & depth), mouse movements (dwell time on elements), form input (even partial), video engagement (watch time, pause/rewind), and time spent on each element.
*   **Session Reconstruction:**  Assemble complete user browsing sessions, including timestamps for all actions.
*   **“Behavioral DNA” Creation:**  For each user (or cohort), create a “Behavioral DNA” profile – a weighted graph representing the probability of transitioning from one interaction to another.  Weights are updated continuously based on real-time data.  Consider using a Markov Chain or Bayesian Network model.

**2. Predictive Content Stitcher:**

*   **Content Segmentation:** Break down web pages into logical content fragments (e.g., headers, sections, images, videos, forms).  Automated analysis should identify these segments; manual overrides provided.
*   **Flow Prediction:**  Given a user’s current state (page, scroll position, last interaction), use the “Behavioral DNA” to predict the most likely next content fragments the user will require.  This prediction should generate a *sequence* of content fragments, not just a single next page.
*   **Content Stitching Engine:** Assemble predicted content fragments into a “virtual page” that *anticipates* the user's needs. This isn't a single HTML file; it's a dynamic assembly of fragments served as needed. Utilize Web Components or a similar modular approach.

**3. Prefetching & Caching Layer:**

*   **Proactive Prefetching:** Based on flow prediction, proactively prefetch content fragments *before* the user interacts. Prioritize fragments with high probability and longer loading times.
*   **Tiered Caching:** Utilize a multi-tiered caching system:
    *   **Browser Cache:** Standard browser caching.
    *   **Edge Cache:** CDN caching for geographically distributed access.
    *   **Server-Side Cache:** In-memory cache for frequently accessed fragments.
*   **Dynamic Asset Prioritization:** Prioritize asset loading based on predicted user flow.

**4. Client-Side Orchestration:**

*   **"Virtual Scroll" Implementation:** Implement a "virtual scroll" technique that only renders content fragments as they come into view, minimizing initial load time and maximizing responsiveness.
*   **Fragment Delivery:** Deliver content fragments as they are needed, seamlessly integrating them into the user’s browsing experience.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a fallback mechanism to gracefully handle prediction failures or network issues. If a predicted fragment is unavailable, load it on demand.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predictNextFragments(user, currentState, depth = 3) {
  // currentState: { pageURL, scrollPosition, lastInteraction }
  // depth: How many fragments to predict ahead

  predictedFragments = []
  currentProbability = getProbability(user, currentState)

  for (i = 0; i < depth; i++) {
    nextFragment = findMostLikelyNextFragment(user, currentState) // Based on Behavioral DNA
    predictedFragments.push(nextFragment)
    currentState = nextFragment // Update state for next iteration
  }

  return predictedFragments
}

function findMostLikelyNextFragment(user, currentState) {
    // Query Behavioral DNA based on currentState
    // Return the fragment with the highest probability
}
```

**Novelty:** Current pre-fetching focuses on whole pages or individual assets. This system moves beyond that, predicting a *sequence* of content, effectively building a user’s complete browsing experience *before* they initiate it.  The "Behavioral DNA" and the dynamic fragment assembly are key differentiators.
