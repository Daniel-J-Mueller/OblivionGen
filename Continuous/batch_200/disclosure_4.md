## Adaptive Quorum Based on Network Topology & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Specification:** System Enhancement – Distributed Data Management

**Core Concept:**  Instead of solely relying on availability zone or data center counts for quorum determination, dynamically adjust the quorum based on real-time network topology, latency, and *predicted* node failure probabilities. This moves beyond simple geographic redundancy to a proactive, network-aware resilience model.

**Components:**

1.  **Network Topology Mapping Service (NTMS):**  A continuous monitoring service that discovers and maps the network topology between all nodes (master & slaves). This includes link bandwidth, latency, and congestion metrics. It utilizes active probing and passive monitoring of network traffic.

2.  **Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) Engine:**  Leverages machine learning models trained on historical node performance data (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network errors), system logs, and external factors (e.g., power grid status, weather patterns). This engine generates a ‘failure probability score’ for each node, updated continuously.  Models will require retraining periods.

3.  **Dynamic Quorum Calculator (DQC):**  The core logic. This module integrates data from the NTMS and PFA.  It calculates an optimal quorum size and node selection based on the following:
    *   **Network Partition Risk:** Prioritizes nodes in well-connected, low-latency subnets. Nodes identified as being at high risk of network isolation are *excluded* from quorum candidates.
    *   **Node Failure Probability:**  Nodes with higher failure probability scores are given lower weight in quorum selection.
    *   **Data Consistency Requirements:**  Allows administrators to configure consistency levels (e.g., strong consistency, eventual consistency). This influences the minimum quorum size.
    *   **Budgeting:** Provides a means to weigh costs/performance, and/or bandwidth limitations.
    *   **N-K+1 Adjustment:** Instead of a fixed N-K+1, the calculator dynamically updates K based on the risk assessment, prioritizing more reliable nodes.

**Pseudocode (DQC):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION CalculateDynamicQuorum(nodes, topologyData, failureProbabilities, consistencyLevel):

  // Filter out nodes with high failure probability
  filteredNodes = FilterNodes(nodes, failureProbabilities, threshold = 0.1) // Example: filter nodes > 10% failure probability

  // Rank nodes based on network connectivity (lowest latency first)
  rankedNodes = RankNodes(filteredNodes, topologyData)

  // Determine base quorum size based on consistency level
  baseQuorumSize = GetBaseQuorumSize(consistencyLevel)

  // Adjust quorum size based on network risk (e.g., high partition risk = larger quorum)
  networkRiskFactor = CalculateNetworkRiskFactor(topologyData)
  adjustedQuorumSize = baseQuorumSize * (1 + networkRiskFactor)

  // Select top 'adjustedQuorumSize' nodes from 'rankedNodes'
  quorumNodes = SelectTopNodes(rankedNodes, adjustedQuorumSize)

  RETURN quorumNodes
```

**System Interactions:**

*   Master node queries DQC for the current quorum nodes before initiating a write operation.
*   Master node uses the returned quorum nodes for acknowledgement verification.
*   Slaves report health status and performance metrics to the PFA engine.
*   NTMS continuously updates network topology information.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved resilience to network partitions and node failures.
*   Optimized performance by selecting the most reliable and responsive nodes.
*   Reduced latency by minimizing cross-subnet communication.
*   Adaptability to changing network conditions and node health.
