## Adaptive Content Reconstruction with Dynamic Fraction Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the fractional redundant distribution concept by introducing dynamic prioritization of data fractions based on real-time network conditions and user device capabilities. Instead of uniformly distributing fractions, the system analyzes network congestion, device processing power, and storage availability to intelligently prioritize delivery of the *most impactful* fractions first, maximizing perceived content quality and minimizing buffering.

**Specs:**

**1. Fraction Metadata & Impact Scoring:**

*   Each media content segment is divided into a predetermined number of fractions (e.g., 16, 32, 64).
*   Each fraction is tagged with metadata:
    *   **Spatial Priority:** Indicates the visual importance of the fraction (e.g., high for faces, action elements, low for background areas). This could be pre-calculated during encoding or dynamically determined using lightweight computer vision.
    *   **Temporal Priority:**  Indicates the temporal importance of the fraction (e.g., keyframes, motion vectors).
    *   **Redundancy Group:**  Identifies the redundancy group the fraction belongs to.
    *   **Size:** Data size of the fraction.
*   An "Impact Score" is calculated for each fraction: `Impact Score = Spatial Priority * Temporal Priority / Size`. This score represents the 'bang for the buck' of downloading a given fraction.

**2. User Device Profiling:**

*   The user device reports its capabilities:
    *   Processing Power (CPU/GPU)
    *   Available Storage
    *   Network Bandwidth (current & historical)
    *   Screen Resolution/Density
*   A "Device Profile" is created based on these parameters.

**3. Dynamic Fraction Prioritization Engine:**

*   On request for content:
    *   The system analyzes the User Device Profile and current network conditions.
    *   It calculates a "Download Priority" for each fraction: `Download Priority = Impact Score * Network Multiplier * Device Multiplier`.
        *   **Network Multiplier:**  Higher for fractions that can be downloaded quickly given the current bandwidth.
        *   **Device Multiplier:** Higher for fractions that can be efficiently processed/displayed by the device.
    *   Fractions are sorted based on their Download Priority.
*   The system requests fractions from peer devices in the prioritized order.

**4. Adaptive Reconstruction Algorithm:**

*   The user device receives fractions in the prioritized order.
*   The reconstruction algorithm prioritizes combining the highest priority fractions *first*.
*   The algorithm uses the redundancy groups to reconstruct missing or corrupted fractions as in the original patent.
*   The algorithm dynamically adjusts the reconstruction quality based on the number of available fractions and the user device capabilities.
*   If the reconstruction process fails to meet a quality threshold, the algorithm may request additional fractions with lower priorities.

**5.  Peer Selection Enhancement:**

*   The peer selection algorithm prioritizes peers with:
    *   Fractions that are currently highest priority for the requesting device.
    *   Higher bandwidth and lower latency connections.
    *   Sufficient processing power to handle fraction requests.

**Pseudocode (User Device - Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructContent(contentID):
  deviceProfile = getDeviceProfile()
  priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue()
  
  // Request initial set of high priority fractions
  requestFractions(contentID, priorityQueue) 

  while (content not fully reconstructed and timeout not reached):
    fraction = receiveFraction()
    if (fraction valid):
      addFractionToReconstructionBuffer(fraction)
      reconstructPartialContent() //Use redundancy groups
      updatePriorityQueue(fraction) //Request next fraction
    else:
      requestReplacementFraction(fraction) //Request from another peer
    
  displayReconstructedContent()
```

**Innovation Focus:** This extends the concept beyond simple redundancy to a dynamic, adaptive system that maximizes user experience by intelligently prioritizing content delivery based on real-time conditions and device capabilities.  It moves from a 'just in time' delivery model, to a 'smart just in time' delivery model.
