**Adaptive Fault Tolerance via Predictive Resource Migration**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** A system that *predicts* potential node failures based on observed resource stress and proactively migrates critical workloads *before* a fault occurs. This isn’t reactive fault *recovery*, it’s proactive fault *avoidance*. It leverages machine learning models trained on historical resource usage data (CPU, memory, I/O, network) across all nodes in the cluster.

**II. Components:**

*   **Resource Monitoring Agent (RMA):** Deployed on each node. Collects granular resource usage data (CPU cycles, memory allocation, disk I/O, network traffic, latency) and sends it to the Central Analytics Engine.
*   **Central Analytics Engine (CAE):** The heart of the predictive system.
    *   **ML Model:**  A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) trained on historical resource data. It predicts future resource usage for each node. Key metric: ‘Failure Probability Score’ (FPS).
    *   **FPS Thresholds:** Configurable thresholds.  High FPS triggers workload migration.
    *   **Workload Profiler:** Analyzes running workloads to determine dependencies and resource requirements.
*   **Workload Migration Manager (WMM):** Orchestrates the migration of workloads.
    *   **Destination Selector:** Identifies healthy nodes with sufficient resources.  Considers network proximity and data locality.
    *   **Migration Coordinator:** Manages the transfer of data and application state. Uses techniques like live migration or checkpoint/restart.
*   **Fault Injection Framework (FIF):** A testing component. Allows engineers to artificially induce node failures to validate the predictive and migration system.

**III. Operation:**

1.  **Data Collection:** RMAs continuously collect resource data.
2.  **Prediction:** CAE receives data, runs the ML model, and calculates FPS for each node.
3.  **Trigger Migration:** If FPS exceeds a configured threshold for a node:
    *   WMM activates.
    *   Workload Profiler analyzes running workloads on the target node.
    *   Destination Selector identifies healthy destination nodes.
    *   Migration Coordinator initiates workload migration. Workloads are moved to the destination nodes *before* the target node is likely to fail.
4.  **Post-Migration Monitoring:** The CAE continues to monitor the migrated workloads on the new nodes.
5.  **FIF Validation:** The FIF injects faults to validate the entire process.

**IV. Pseudocode (Workload Migration Manager):**

```pseudocode
function migrateWorkload(nodeID):
  workloads = getWorkloads(nodeID)
  destinationNode = selectDestinationNode(nodeID)

  for each workload in workloads:
    if workload.isStateful():
      checkpoint(workload) // Save workload state
      transferState(workload, destinationNode)
    else:
      restartWorkload(workload, destinationNode)

  markNodeAsUnhealthy(nodeID) // Preemptively isolate potentially failing node
  logMigrationEvent(nodeID, destinationNode)
```

**V. Novelty:**  Existing fault management systems are *reactive*. This system is *proactive*. It anticipates failures and prevents them, reducing downtime and improving system resilience. The use of time-series forecasting models specifically for fault prediction is also a key differentiator.
