## Dynamic Data Provenance & Attestation Layer

**Concept:** Expand the snapshot capability beyond simple data replication for disaster recovery or shared access. Implement a system that captures *provenance* data alongside each snapshot – not just *what* data existed, but *how* it came to be, including the compute environment, user actions, and dependencies.  Then, build an attestation layer *on top* of these provenance-rich snapshots.

**Specs:**

**1. Provenance Capture Module:**

*   **Instrumentation:** Inject code into all data-modifying operations (writes, updates, deletes) on the storage volume. This instrumentation captures:
    *   User ID initiating the change.
    *   Timestamp of the change.
    *   Process ID/Compute Node ID where the change originated.
    *   Specific data elements modified (block ranges, object IDs).
    *   Any relevant metadata associated with the change (e.g., application name, script executed).
    *   Hash of the code executed to make the change.
*   **Provenance Data Structure:** A hierarchical data structure (e.g., Merkle tree) is built to represent the provenance of each data block.  Each leaf node contains a hash of the data block and associated metadata.  Internal nodes represent aggregations of these hashes, providing a tamper-evident history of changes.
*   **Snapshot Integration:**  When a snapshot is created, *both* the data and the complete provenance tree are stored in the archival storage system.

**2. Attestation Engine:**

*   **Policy Definition:**  Allow administrators to define policies that specify acceptable conditions for data access. These policies can be based on:
    *   Data origin (e.g., "only allow access to data created by user X").
    *   Compute environment (e.g., "only allow access from compute nodes in region Y").
    *   Data lineage (e.g., "only allow access to data that has been validated by application Z").
*   **Policy Enforcement:**  Before granting access to a storage volume (or a portion thereof), the Attestation Engine evaluates the relevant policies against the provenance data associated with the requested data.
*   **Attestation Report:** Generate a detailed report outlining the reasons for granting or denying access. This report serves as an audit trail and provides evidence of compliance with security policies.

**3.  Dynamic Chunking & Isolation:**

*   **Granularity:** Instead of fixed-size chunks, use a dynamic chunking algorithm that considers data sensitivity and access patterns.  Sensitive data or data with strict access control requirements is isolated into smaller, more manageable chunks.
*   **Encryption & Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Apply separate encryption keys and ACLs to each chunk, providing granular control over data access.  The ACLs are informed by the Attestation Engine’s policy evaluation.
*   **Workflow Integration:** Integrate with existing workflow management systems to automatically apply appropriate access controls based on the stage of the workflow.

**Pseudocode (Attestation Engine Policy Evaluation):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(request, dataChunk, policy):
  provenanceData = getDataProvenance(dataChunk)
  if policy.origin == "user":
    if provenanceData.creator != policy.userID:
      return false
  if policy.environment == "region":
    if provenanceData.computeNode.region != policy.region:
      return false
  if policy.validationApp == "applicationZ":
    if not provenanceData.validatedBy(applicationZ):
      return false
  return true
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple data snapshots to create a *trusted data foundation*. By capturing provenance and building an attestation layer, the system can enforce fine-grained access control policies, ensuring data integrity and compliance. It shifts the focus from *where* data is stored to *how* data was created and *who* is authorized to access it.
