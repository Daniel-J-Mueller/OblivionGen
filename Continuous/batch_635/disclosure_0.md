## Hardware-Bound Dynamic Biometric Template Generation

**Concept:** Utilize the hardware secret within a secure enclave to generate and evolve biometric templates *dynamically* based on user interaction, rather than storing a static template. This dramatically increases security against template theft and replay attacks.

**Specs:**

1.  **Secure Enclave Integration:** Requires a hardware security module (HSM) or secure enclave (e.g., ARM TrustZone) containing a unique hardware secret.

2.  **Continuous Biometric Input:** System actively collects biometric data (fingerprint, voice, gait, facial features, etc.) during typical user operation.  This isn't a one-time enrollment, but a constant stream.

3.  **Hardware-Bound Transformation:** The hardware secret is used as a seed or key within a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-3, BLAKE2) to transform the incoming biometric stream into a constantly evolving "feature vector."  The feature vector isnâ€™t a static representation of the biometric; it's a rolling hash reflecting recent user interaction.

    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        function transform_biometric_data(biometric_data, hardware_secret, iteration_count):
            hashed_data = hardware_secret
            for i in range(iteration_count):
                hashed_data = SHA3(hashed_data + biometric_data)  // Concatenate and hash
                biometric_data = next_biometric_sample()  // Get the next sample
            return hashed_data
        ```

4.  **Bloom Filter Enhancement:** The generated feature vector is used to update a Bloom filter *locally within the secure enclave*. This filter stores representations of authorized user interactions.  The Bloom filter is *not* the primary authentication factor, but an auxiliary layer enhancing security.

5.  **Challenge-Response Authentication:** Authentication proceeds with a challenge-response system.

    *   The server sends a random challenge (e.g., a short phrase to speak, a specific gesture to perform, a series of keystrokes).
    *   The user performs the challenge.
    *   The biometric data captured during the challenge is processed by the hardware-bound transformation (step 3).
    *   The resulting feature vector is compared to the Bloom filter. A match indicates a likely authorized user.

6.  **Dynamic Bloom Filter Decay:** The Bloom filter entries decay over time based on a configurable decay rate.  This prevents stale data from compromising security.  The decay rate is also influenced by the hardware secret for further obfuscation.

7.  **Tamper Detection:** The system monitors the secure enclave for physical tampering. If tampering is detected, the hardware secret is zeroized, rendering the system unusable and preventing unauthorized access.

8.  **Entropy Harvesting:** Utilize the noise inherent in biometric sensors to seed a random number generator (RNG) within the secure enclave, providing additional entropy for cryptographic operations.
