## Dynamic Data Stream ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Scaling & Anomaly Detection

**Specification:** Implement a system for creating real-time ‘shadow’ data streams derived from existing, primary data streams. These shadow streams will be used for predictive scaling of processing resources and proactive anomaly detection *without* impacting the primary stream's processing.

**Components:**

*   **Shadow Stream Generator:** A module responsible for replicating data from the primary stream.  This replication isn’t 1:1. Instead, configurable parameters control *how* the data is mirrored.  Options include:
    *   **Sampling Rate:**  Mirror only a percentage of records.
    *   **Data Aggregation:** Aggregate records (e.g., average, sum) over configurable time windows *before* mirroring.
    *   **Feature Extraction:**  Apply feature extraction algorithms to the mirrored data (e.g., Fourier transforms, wavelet analysis) to highlight specific characteristics.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Operates on the shadow stream.  Utilizes time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future data volume, velocity, and characteristics.  Outputs scaling recommendations for the primary stream's processing resources.
*   **Anomaly Detection Module:**  Analyzes the shadow stream for deviations from established baseline behavior. Uses statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, moving averages) and machine learning algorithms (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) to identify potential anomalies.
*   **Resource Orchestrator:**  Receives scaling recommendations from the Prediction Engine and anomaly alerts from the Anomaly Detection Module.  Dynamically adjusts the allocation of processing resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) to the primary stream’s processing pipeline.
*   **Metadata Store:** Stores configurations for shadow stream generation (sampling rate, aggregation parameters, feature extraction algorithms), baseline data for anomaly detection, and historical scaling data.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Configuration:** Define shadow stream parameters (sampling rate, aggregation, feature extraction) for each primary stream based on its characteristics and criticality.
2.  **Data Replication:** The Shadow Stream Generator replicates data from the primary stream according to the configured parameters.
3.  **Prediction & Anomaly Detection:** The Prediction Engine and Anomaly Detection Module independently analyze the shadow stream.
4.  **Resource Adjustment:** The Resource Orchestrator receives output from both modules and dynamically adjusts processing resources for the primary stream.
5.  **Monitoring & Learning:** The system continuously monitors the performance of the primary stream and learns from past scaling decisions to improve future predictions.

**Pseudocode (Resource Orchestrator):**

```
function adjustResources(predictedVolume, anomalyScore):
  if anomalyScore > threshold:
    scaleUpResources(factor = highScaleFactor)
  else if predictedVolume > highVolumeThreshold:
    scaleUpResources(factor = moderateScaleFactor)
  else if predictedVolume < lowVolumeThreshold:
    scaleDownResources(factor = conservativeScaleFactor)
  else:
    maintainCurrentResources()
```

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   Use distributed streaming platforms (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar) for data replication and processing.
*   Implement redundancy and failover mechanisms for all components.
*   Use containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for deployment and scaling.
