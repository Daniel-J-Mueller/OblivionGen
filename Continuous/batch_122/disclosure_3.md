## Automated Drone-Based Composite Structure Inspection with Dynamic Baseline Generation

**Concept:** A fully automated system leveraging a swarm of drones equipped with multi-spectral thermographic sensors to inspect large composite structures (aircraft wings, wind turbine blades, boat hulls) *in situ*, generating and updating a dynamic baseline for defect detection. This moves beyond static reference images/data and accommodates environmental changes and component aging.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Drone Swarm:** Minimum of 5 drones operating in coordinated formation. Each drone equipped with:
    *   High-resolution multi-spectral thermographic camera (visible light, near-infrared, thermal).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and GPS for precise positioning and orientation.
    *   Collision avoidance system.
    *   Secure communication link to base station.
    *   Automated battery swapping/charging station.

*   **Base Station:**
    *   High-performance computing cluster for data processing and analysis.
    *   Real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS base station for precise drone positioning.
    *   Secure data storage and archiving.
    *   User interface for visualization and reporting.

*   **Software Stack:**
    *   **Drone Control Module:**  Manages drone swarm coordination, flight path planning, and sensor data acquisition. Uses a behavior-based robotics approach.
    *   **Data Preprocessing Module:** Performs image registration, noise reduction, and geometric correction on raw sensor data.
    *   **Dynamic Baseline Generation Module:**
        *   Initial Baseline:  A comprehensive thermal map of the structure is created during a 'golden' inspection (ideally during manufacturing or a known good state).
        *   Adaptive Baseline:  The baseline is continuously updated over time by averaging data from multiple inspections, weighted by data quality and confidence levels. Accounts for environmental factors (ambient temperature, solar radiation) and normal component aging. Bayesian filtering used to minimize the impact of outlier measurements.
    *   **Defect Detection Module:**
        *   Anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., machine learning models trained on baseline data) identify deviations from the dynamic baseline.
        *   Defect classification (e.g., delamination, cracking, impact damage) based on thermal signature analysis.
        *   Defect localization with sub-millimeter precision.
    *   **Reporting Module:** Generates interactive 3D visualizations of defects, with severity grading and recommended repair actions.

**Pseudocode (Defect Detection Module - Simplified):**

```
function detect_defects(current_thermal_image):
    // 1. Preprocess current image
    processed_image = preprocess(current_thermal_image)

    // 2. Compare to dynamic baseline
    difference_map = subtract(processed_image, dynamic_baseline)

    // 3. Apply anomaly detection threshold
    anomalous_regions = find_regions_above_threshold(difference_map, threshold)

    // 4. Classify anomalies
    for region in anomalous_regions:
        feature_vector = extract_features(region)
        defect_type = classify_defect(feature_vector, trained_model)
        defect_location = locate_defect(region, current_thermal_image)

        // Store defect details (type, location, severity)
        add_defect_to_report(defect_type, defect_location, severity)

    return defect_report
```

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Mission Planning:** Define inspection area, flight path, and data acquisition parameters.
2.  **Drone Deployment:**  Swarm of drones autonomously navigates to inspection area.
3.  **Data Acquisition:**  Drones systematically scan the structure, capturing multi-spectral thermographic data.
4.  **Data Transmission:**  Data is wirelessly transmitted to the base station in real-time.
5.  **Data Processing & Analysis:**  Dynamic baseline is updated, anomalies are detected, and defects are classified.
6.  **Report Generation:**  Interactive 3D visualization of defects with recommended repair actions.
7.  **Drone Return & Recharge:** Drones autonomously return to base for battery swap/recharge.
