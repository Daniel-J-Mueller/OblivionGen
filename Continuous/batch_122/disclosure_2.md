## Predictive Granularity Adjustment with User-Defined Importance

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** An AI-driven granularity adjustment module integrated into the computing hub (as described in the provided patent). This module *predicts* network connectivity fluctuations *before* they critically impact data transmission.
*   **User Interface:** A user-configurable “Importance Mapping” allows users to assign relative importance values to individual data streams or data *types* within the time series data. (e.g., Heart Rate = 10, Step Count = 5, Skin Temperature = 2)
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** A recurrent neural network (RNN), trained on historical network performance data *and* data stream importance values. The RNN outputs a “Granularity Factor” for each data stream. This factor modulates the downsampling rate *proactively*.
*   **Dynamic Downsampling:** Instead of simply downsampling *after* a connectivity issue, the system applies varying degrees of downsampling *beforehand*, based on the predicted network conditions *and* the user-defined importance values. High importance/predicted poor connectivity = minimal downsampling. Low importance/predicted good connectivity = aggressive downsampling.
*   **Data Buffering:**  A tiered buffer system.  High-importance data streams are buffered with higher priority and larger allocation sizes. Lower-importance data is allocated smaller, lower-priority buffer space. This influences the amount of ‘history’ retained even when downsampling occurs.
*   **Quality Tagging:** Expanded quality tagging system. Tags now include "Predictive Downsampling Level" and "Importance Value".
*    **Adaptive Learning:** The RNN continually retrains on the latest network data, user behavior (changes to importance mapping), and the effectiveness of predictive downsampling.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Computing Hub Initialization
Initialize Network Performance Monitor
Initialize User Importance Mapping (Default values or user-defined)
Initialize RNN Model (Pre-trained or trained locally)
Initialize Tiered Data Buffer

// Main Loop
While (Data Received from Device) {
    // 1. Predict Network Connectivity
    ConnectivityPrediction = RNN.Predict(HistoricalNetworkData, UserImportanceMapping)

    // 2. Calculate Granularity Factor for each Data Stream
    For Each DataStream in Data {
        GranularityFactor = CalculateGranularityFactor(ConnectivityPrediction, DataStream.Importance)
    }

    // 3. Apply Downsampling (proactively)
    DownsampledData = ApplyDownsampling(Data, GranularityFactor)

    // 4. Buffer Data
    BufferData(DownsampledData, DataStream.Importance)

    // 5. Transmit Data (prioritized by buffer)
    TransmitDataFromBuffer()
}

// Function: CalculateGranularityFactor
Input: ConnectivityPrediction (0.0 - 1.0, 1.0 = good), DataStream Importance (1-10)
Output: GranularityFactor (0.0 - 1.0, 1.0 = no downsampling)
    Factor = 1.0 - (ConnectivityPrediction * 0.2) + ((10 - DataStreamImportance) * 0.1)
    Return Clamp(Factor, 0.0, 1.0) // Ensure factor remains within bounds
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly improved data accuracy during periods of network instability.
*   User control over data fidelity.
*   Proactive network adaptation, reducing latency and data loss.
*   Potential for enhanced data analytics due to more consistent data streams.
