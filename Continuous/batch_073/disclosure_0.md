## Dynamic Product Bundling with Predictive Hesitation Modeling

**Concept:** Expand the reactive concession system into a proactive bundling system leveraging predictive modeling of buyer hesitation *before* explicit signals emerge. Instead of reacting to abandonment or comparison shopping, predict the likelihood of hesitation and preemptively offer a bundled price.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Collection:**
    *   Real-time tracking of user activity within the e-commerce system (page views, search queries, time spent on product pages, category browsing).
    *   Historical purchase data, including items purchased together, average order value, and customer demographics.
    *   External data feeds: social media trends, competitor pricing, seasonal demand (optional, for increased accuracy).

2.  **Hesitation Prediction Model:**
    *   Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, long short-term memory) to analyze user activity sequences and predict the probability of purchase hesitation.
    *   Key input features:
        *   Time spent on product page without adding to cart.
        *   Number of competing products viewed.
        *   Frequency of category switching.
        *   Search queries related to alternatives.
        *   Comparison of current product features to viewed alternatives.
    *   Model output: Hesitation Score (0.0 – 1.0, representing the likelihood of hesitation).

3.  **Dynamic Bundle Creation:**
    *   Based on the Hesitation Score and current product viewed, identify complementary products suitable for bundling.
    *   Bundle selection criteria:
        *   High co-purchase probability (based on historical data).
        *   Complementary functionality or use case.
        *   Positive correlation with the primary product (e.g., if viewing a camera, suggest a memory card and camera bag).
    *   Bundle Price Calculation:
        *   Determine the combined retail price of the bundle.
        *   Apply a dynamic discount based on the Hesitation Score – higher scores result in larger discounts.
        *   Ensure the bundled price is lower than purchasing the items individually.

4.  **Real-time Presentation & Alerting:**
    *   If Hesitation Score exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., 0.6), proactively display a “Special Offer” or “Complete Your Setup” banner on the product page.
    *   The banner showcases the bundled price and lists the included items.
    *   Alerting Mechanisms:
        *   On-screen popup.
        *   Email notification (if the user is logged in).
        *   Push notification (for mobile app users).

5.  **A/B Testing & Optimization:**
    *   Continuously A/B test different bundling strategies, discount levels, and alerting mechanisms to optimize performance.
    *   Key metrics:
        *   Conversion rate.
        *   Average order value.
        *   Bundle purchase rate.
        *   Customer lifetime value.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_hesitation(user_activity_sequence):
    # Input: User activity sequence (page views, search queries, etc.)
    # Output: Hesitation Score (0.0 – 1.0)
    model = load_hesitation_prediction_model()
    hesitation_score = model.predict(user_activity_sequence)
    return hesitation_score

function create_dynamic_bundle(product_id, hesitation_score):
    # Input: Product ID, Hesitation Score
    # Output: Bundle Details (list of product IDs, bundled price)
    candidate_bundles = find_candidate_bundles(product_id)
    best_bundle = select_best_bundle(candidate_bundles, hesitation_score)
    bundled_price = calculate_bundled_price(best_bundle)
    return best_bundle, bundled_price

function display_bundle_offer(user, product_id):
    # Input: User, Product ID
    # Output: Display bundle offer on product page
    hesitation_score = predict_hesitation(user.activity_sequence)
    if hesitation_score > 0.6:
        bundle, bundled_price = create_dynamic_bundle(product_id, hesitation_score)
        display_banner(bundle, bundled_price)
```
