## Temporal Graph Sharding with Predictive Pre-fetch

**Concept:** Extend the internal data format to natively support temporal data, then shard the graph based on time *and* predicted future query access patterns. This shifts from reactive query optimization to proactive data placement.

**Specs:**

*   **Internal Data Format Enhancement:**
    *   Add a `timestamp` field to each data element. This isn't just an insertion timestamp, but represents the time to which the data *relates*.  (e.g., a friendship established on 2023-10-27).
    *   Introduce a `validity_range` field (start_timestamp, end_timestamp). Allows for versioning and representing data that is only true within a specific time window.
    *   Each column now has a `temporal_resolution` setting (e.g., milliseconds, seconds, days).

*   **Temporal Sharding:**
    *   Graph data is partitioned not just by column, but also by time intervals. (e.g., data from 2023-10-01 to 2023-10-31 resides on shard X).  
    *   Shard boundaries can be fixed (calendar-based) or dynamic (based on data density/access patterns).
    *   Shards are *versioned* â€“ old shards are archived but remain accessible for historical queries.

*   **Predictive Prefetch Engine:**
    *   Utilize time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future query access patterns.
    *   The engine analyzes historical queries, seasonal trends, and external events (e.g., news, social media) to forecast data needs.
    *   Based on predictions, data is proactively pre-fetched from archive shards or remote storage and loaded into faster, in-memory shards.
    *   Prefetching is prioritized based on predicted query importance and resource availability.

*   **Query Execution Plan Adaptation:**
    *   Query parser identifies temporal constraints in queries.
    *   Execution plan generator determines the relevant shards based on time ranges.
    *   If data is pre-fetched, the query is routed to the in-memory shard.
    *   If data resides on archive shards, the query is routed to those shards, with potential caching of results in a faster tier.
    *   The system learns from query execution patterns to refine prediction models.

**Pseudocode (Query Execution):**

```
function executeQuery(query):
  temporalConstraints = parseTemporalConstraints(query)
  relevantShards = identifyShards(temporalConstraints)

  for shard in relevantShards:
    if shard.isPrefetched():
      results = shard.query(query)
      return results
    else:
      results = shard.query(query)
      cacheResults(results) //Cache to speed up next request
      return results

  return emptyResult // If no shards contain the data
```

**Novelty:** Current graph databases primarily focus on static data or basic temporal snapshots. This system actively anticipates future data needs based on predictive modeling, reducing latency and improving query performance for time-sensitive applications. The combination of temporal sharding *and* predictive pre-fetch is a unique approach to scaling graph databases for time-series data.
