## Personalized Constraint Relaxation via User Behavioral Modeling

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust constraint penalties in multi-objective ranking not based on fixed upper bounds or iteration counts, but based on real-time user behavior. The system learns how much a user *tolerates* violations of secondary objectives, and adjusts the penalty term accordingly. This moves beyond a purely algorithmic optimization to a user-centric optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Tracks user interactions with search results: clicks, dwell time, purchases, adds to cart, explicit ratings (thumbs up/down).
    *   Records query context: time of day, location (coarse), device type.
    *   Maintains a user profile storing preferences learned from interaction history.  Key preference indicator:  "Secondary Objective Tolerance" (SOT) – a value representing willingness to sacrifice the secondary objective for gains in the primary.
*   **SOT Estimation:**
    *   Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model user behavior over time. The RNN takes as input sequences of (query, search results, user interaction) tuples.
    *   The RNN’s output is a predicted SOT value for the current query. This value scales the penalty term in the Lagrangian function.
    *   Training Data: Large-scale user interaction logs.
    *   Loss Function:  A combination of prediction accuracy (e.g., predicting clicks) and a regularization term to encourage exploration of diverse results.
*   **Lagrangian Modification:**
    *   Original Lagrangian:  `L = Cost(Primary) + λ * Penalty(Secondary)`
    *   Modified Lagrangian: `L = Cost(Primary) + SOT * λ * Penalty(Secondary)`
    *   Where:
        *   `SOT` is the estimated Secondary Objective Tolerance from the RNN.
        *   `λ` is the original penalty weight.
*   **System Architecture:**
    1.  User submits a query.
    2.  Query & user ID are passed to the SOT Estimation Module.
    3.  SOT Estimation Module returns the user’s predicted SOT value.
    4.  The ranking engine calculates the Lagrangian with the adjusted penalty term.
    5.  Results are ranked and displayed.
    6.  User interaction data is captured and fed back into the SOT Estimation Module for continuous learning.
*   **Pseudocode (Ranking Engine):**

```
function rank_results(query, user_id, search_results):
    sot = estimate_sot(user_id, query)
    primary_cost = calculate_primary_cost(search_results)
    secondary_cost = calculate_secondary_cost(search_results)
    penalty = calculate_penalty(secondary_cost)
    lagrangian = primary_cost + sot * penalty
    ranked_results = optimize(lagrangian) # e.g., using gradient descent
    return ranked_results
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Standard server-grade hardware.
    *   GPU acceleration for RNN training and inference.
    *   Sufficient storage for user interaction logs and model weights.
