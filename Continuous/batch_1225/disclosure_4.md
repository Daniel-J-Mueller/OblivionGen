## Dynamic Network Shadowing & Anomaly Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the network reachability analysis to create a continuously updating “shadow” of the network’s *intended* state, comparing it to the *observed* state to predict potential anomalies *before* they manifest as security breaches or service disruptions. This builds upon the ability to model network configurations and reachability, adding a temporal dimension and predictive capability.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadow Network Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Network configuration data (as per the patent), real-time network traffic data (NetFlow, sFlow, packet capture summaries - *not* full packets for performance), system logs (firewall, IDS/IPS).
*   **Process:**
    *   Construct a graph representation of the network configuration. Nodes represent network devices/services, edges represent permitted communication paths. This is the “intended” network.
    *   Continuously ingest real-time traffic and log data.
    *   Map observed traffic onto the “intended” network graph.
    *   Maintain a second graph - the "observed" network. Edges represent *actual* communication.
    *   Implement a weighted edge system reflecting traffic volume and frequency.
*   **Output:** Two network graphs: "intended" and "observed", continuously updated.

**2. Anomaly Detection Engine:**

*   **Input:** "intended" and "observed" network graphs, historical traffic data.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Deviation Analysis:** Calculate the difference between the "intended" and "observed" graphs. Focus on:
        *   Unexpected edges in the "observed" graph (unauthorized communication).
        *   Missing edges in the "observed" graph (potential denial-of-service or service degradation).
        *   Significant changes in traffic volume/frequency on existing edges.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Employ time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) on historical traffic data to establish baseline patterns. Predict future traffic volumes for each edge.
    *   **Correlation Engine:** Identify correlations between deviations and predicted traffic patterns. For example, a sudden increase in unauthorized traffic *combined* with a predicted peak load could indicate a compromised device attempting to launch an attack.
*   **Output:** Anomaly scores, prioritized alerts with detailed information (source/destination IPs, ports, affected services, anomaly type, confidence level).

**3. Dynamic Rule Adaptation Module:**

*   **Input:** Anomaly alerts, network administrator input.
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on confirmed anomalies, automatically generate or suggest updates to network security policies (firewall rules, access control lists).
    *   Implement a feedback loop: Network administrator reviews suggested changes, approves/modifies, and applies. This continuously refines the system's accuracy and reduces false positives.
    *   Integrate with existing security orchestration and automation tools.
*   **Output:** Updated network security policies.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine - Simplified):**

```
function detect_anomalies(intended_graph, observed_graph, historical_data):
  deviation_score = calculate_graph_difference(intended_graph, observed_graph)
  predicted_traffic = predict_future_traffic(historical_data)
  anomaly_score = deviation_score + (1 - correlation(deviation_score, predicted_traffic)) // Penalize deviations that contradict predictions
  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    generate_alert(anomaly_score, source, destination, anomaly_type)
  return anomaly_score
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with multi-core processors and large memory.
*   Network traffic capture infrastructure (e.g., SPAN ports, network taps).
*   Data storage for historical traffic data.
*   Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Integration with existing network management and security tools.
