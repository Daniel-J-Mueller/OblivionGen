## Dynamic Application Template Composition via Conversational AI

**Specification:** A system enabling users to dynamically construct application templates *within* a messaging conversation using natural language instructions interpreted by an integrated conversational AI. This expands upon the idea of generating application templates from message content, moving beyond simple extraction to proactive, user-directed creation.

**Core Components:**

*   **Conversational AI Engine:**  A large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for template construction.  It understands user intent expressed in natural language.
*   **Template Library:** A repository of pre-built template *fragments* (e.g., address blocks, date pickers, signature fields, image upload areas, payment integration stubs). These are modular components.
*   **Real-time Template Preview:**  A visual rendering of the template being constructed, updating instantly with each user instruction. Displayed *within* the messaging interface.
*   **Contextual Awareness Module:** Leverages the existing contextual analysis from the provided patent, but *extends* it. It not only identifies the topic, but also infers *the purpose* of the potential application (e.g., expense report, service request, purchase order).
*   **API Integration Layer:** Connects to various backend services (e.g., CRM, accounting software, document storage) to populate template fields or initiate workflows.

**Workflow:**

1.  A user begins a message conversation.
2.  The system detects intent to create an application (e.g., user types “Let’s create a travel request form”).
3.  The Conversational AI engine engages, prompting the user with clarifying questions: “What information should this travel request form include?”
4.  User responds in natural language: "I need fields for destination, dates, estimated cost, and approval manager.”
5.  The AI engine:
    *   Identifies the required fields.
    *   Selects appropriate template fragments from the library (date pickers, text input fields, dropdown menus for manager selection).
    *   Arranges the fragments into a coherent template layout.
    *   Displays a real-time preview of the template within the messaging conversation.
6.  The user can refine the template through further natural language commands: "Add a section for flight details", “Make the cost field required”, "Change the approval manager dropdown to show only my direct reports".
7.  Once the user is satisfied, they can initiate the application process (e.g., pre-populate the template with data from the conversation, send it to relevant parties, trigger a workflow).

**Pseudocode (AI Engine - `process_user_instruction` function):**

```pseudocode
function process_user_instruction(user_input, current_template):
  intent = analyze_intent(user_input)

  if intent == "ADD_FIELD":
    field_type, field_label = extract_field_details(user_input)
    field_fragment = get_template_fragment(field_type)
    add_field_to_template(current_template, field_fragment, field_label)

  elif intent == "MODIFY_FIELD":
    field_name, modification_type, modification_value = extract_modification_details(user_input)
    modify_field_in_template(current_template, field_name, modification_type, modification_value)

  elif intent == "ADD_SECTION":
    section_label = extract_section_label(user_input)
    add_section_to_template(current_template, section_label)

  elif intent == "CONFIRM":
    return current_template # Finalize and return the template

  else:
    #Handle ambiguous or unsupported requests.  Prompt the user for clarification.
    return "I'm not sure I understand.  Could you please rephrase your request?"

  return current_template #Return the updated template
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Standard mobile device/computer processing capabilities.
*   Sufficient memory to host the LLM and template library (Cloud-based deployment is preferred).
*   Stable internet connection for cloud communication.
