## Dynamic Contextual Recommendation Augmentation – ‘Echo’

**Core Concept:** Extend the conversation mining beyond simple item *reference* to inferring *context* surrounding those references, and leverage that context to dynamically alter recommendation parameters *in real-time*.  Instead of just knowing *what* the user mentioned, understand *how* they mentioned it – their sentiment, the social situation, and the implied need.

**Specification:**

**1. Contextual Sentiment Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw conversation text from the second site (social networking site, forum, etc.).
*   **Process:**  Employ a multi-layered sentiment analysis model.
    *   **Layer 1: Basic Sentiment:** Detects positive, negative, or neutral sentiment toward the referenced catalog item. Standard lexicon-based and machine learning approaches.
    *   **Layer 2: Relational Sentiment:**  Identifies sentiment *towards* other entities mentioned in the same conversational segment (e.g., "My friend *loved* that gadget!").  This builds a social graph of sentiment.
    *   **Layer 3: Need Inference:**  Uses Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to infer the *reason* behind the mention. Is the user:
        *   Expressing desire ("I really want this...")?
        *   Seeking advice ("Does anyone know if this is good for…?")?
        *   Complaining about a problem the item might solve (“Ugh, my battery keeps dying…”) ?
        *   Giving a gift suggestion (“My mom would love this!”)?
*   **Output:** A structured data object containing:
    *   Item ID
    *   Basic Sentiment Score (-1 to +1)
    *   Relational Sentiment Scores (keyed by other entity IDs)
    *   Inferred Need Category (Desire, Advice, Problem, Gift)
    *   Confidence Score for Need Inference.

**2. Dynamic Recommendation Parameter Adjustment:**

*   **Input:** Structured Data from Contextual Sentiment Analysis Module, User Profile, Catalog Item Data.
*   **Process:**  Adjust Recommendation Algorithm parameters based on inferred context.
    *   **Desire:** Increase ‘boost’ factor for the referenced item; prioritize similar items with high ratings.
    *   **Advice:** Prioritize items with high customer review scores *and* detailed technical specifications. Surface comparison charts.
    *   **Problem:** Surface items specifically designed to solve the identified problem, even if unrelated to the originally referenced item. Offer bundled solutions (e.g., battery + charger).
    *   **Gift:** Prioritize items with high aesthetic appeal and positive gifting-related reviews. Suggest gift-wrapping options.
*   **Algorithm Parameter Table (Example):**

    | Need Category | Boost Factor | Similarity Weight | Review Weight | Technical Spec Weight |
    |---------------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|------------------------|
    | Desire        | 1.5          | 0.8               | 0.7            | 0.3                    |
    | Advice        | 1.2          | 0.6               | 0.9            | 0.8                    |
    | Problem       | 1.0          | 0.4               | 0.6            | 0.5                    |
    | Gift          | 1.3          | 0.7               | 0.8            | 0.4                    |

**3. Real-Time Recommendation Update:**

*   **Process:** Integrate the dynamic parameter adjustment into the existing recommendation service.  As the user continues to converse on the second site, the system continuously updates the recommendation parameters in near real-time.
*   **Implementation:**  A lightweight messaging queue (e.g., Kafka) can be used to stream contextual data from the Sentiment Analysis Module to the Recommendation Service.

**4.  'Echo' Visualization Layer (Optional):**

*   **Process:**  Display a small visual indicator on the recommendation page showing *why* an item is being recommended (e.g., "Recommended because you mentioned a similar item and expressed a desire for it"). This increases transparency and user trust.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Service):**

```
function generateRecommendations(userID):
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userID)
  catalogItems = getCatalogItems()

  //Get Realtime Contextual Info
  contextualData = getRealtimeContextualData(userID)

  //Adjust Recommendation Parameters
  recommendationParameters = getDefaultParameters()
  if (contextualData != null)
    recommendationParameters = adjustParameters(recommendationParameters, contextualData)

  //Generate Recommendations
  recommendations = generateRecommendationsUsingParameters(userProfile, catalogItems, recommendationParameters)
  return recommendations
```

**Novelty:**  The patent focuses on *identifying* references. This expands it to understanding the *context* surrounding those references and using that context to dynamically shape the recommendation process. The 'Echo' visualization layer adds a layer of transparency and user engagement not present in the original patent. This moves beyond simply knowing *what* the user is talking about, to *understanding* what they mean.
