## Personalized Acoustic Environments via Spatialized Wake-Word Detection

**Concept:** Extend wake-word detection beyond simple activation to create personalized acoustic environments. Instead of just responding to "Hey Siri," the system learns *where* a user typically is within a space (car, office, home) and tailors responses (and audio output) to that location, effectively creating zones of personalized audio.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, ideally 8+) distributed throughout the vehicle/space. These are *in addition* to existing microphone systems used for hands-free calling, etc.
    *   Spatial audio rendering engine (DSP or dedicated hardware).
    *   Processing unit capable of running machine learning models for localization and audio beamforming.
*   **Software:**
    *   **User Profiling Module:** Stores user voiceprints, preferred wake words, and learned location profiles. This can tie into existing user accounts.
    *   **Localization Engine:** Uses Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) or other spatial audio processing techniques on the wake word utterance to determine the user's approximate 3D position within the space. Machine learning models (e.g., neural networks) are used to improve accuracy based on environmental factors (noise, reflections).
    *   **Acoustic Zone Manager:** Divides the space into discrete acoustic zones.  Zones are configurable by the user (e.g., "driver seat," "passenger seat," "rear seats"). The Localization Engine maps the user’s determined position to an acoustic zone.
    *   **Spatial Audio Renderer:** Adjusts audio output (responses, music, notifications) to be *perceived* as originating from the user’s identified location. Uses beamforming or wave field synthesis to create the illusion of localized sound. This is crucial - the system doesn’t just *play* a sound, it directs it *toward* the user.
    *   **Adaptive Wake-Word Model:** The system continuously adapts the wake-word detection model based on the user’s location and environmental noise.  This prevents false positives and ensures reliable detection.
    *   **Contextual Awareness Module:** Integrates with other vehicle/device sensors (e.g., GPS, accelerometer, time of day) to refine localization and personalize the audio experience. Example: If the user is identified as being in the driver’s seat at 7 AM on a weekday, the system might prioritize news briefings over music recommendations.
*   **Pseudocode (Localization Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION localizeUser(audioData, microphoneArrayData):
    // 1. Feature Extraction: Extract acoustic features from audioData (e.g., MFCCs)
    features = extractFeatures(audioData)

    // 2. TDoA Calculation: Calculate Time Difference of Arrival for each microphone
    tdoaValues = calculateTDoA(features, microphoneArrayData)

    // 3. Position Estimation: Use TDoA values to estimate user’s 3D position
    estimatedPosition = estimatePosition(tdoaValues)

    // 4. Machine Learning Refinement: Use trained ML model to refine position based on environmental factors
    refinedPosition = refinePosition(estimatedPosition, environmentalFactors)

    RETURN refinedPosition
```

*   **User Interface:**
    *   App/Settings Panel: Allows users to define acoustic zones, customize audio preferences for each zone, and manage user profiles.
    *   Visual Feedback:  Provides visual confirmation of the user’s identified location (e.g., a 3D representation of the space with the user’s position highlighted).



**Novelty:**  This moves beyond simple wake-word detection as a trigger. It turns it into a spatially aware system that adapts the acoustic environment to the user’s position.  The combination of spatial localization, personalized audio, and context awareness creates a significantly more immersive and user-friendly experience. It's akin to a personal sound bubble that moves with the user.
