## Dynamic Compliance Zones & Adaptive Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the system to not simply *detect* uncovered body parts, but to dynamically define 'compliance zones' around a subject within a video frame and adapt scoring based on contextual understanding of the scene. This goes beyond simple detection to understanding *intent* and *context* – is the uncovered body part part of a medical examination, a sporting event, artistic expression, or a violation?

**Specs:**

*   **Module: Scene Context Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Video frame, existing uncovered body part detection scores.
    *   Processing: Employs object detection (e.g., recognizing hospital beds, sports equipment, art supplies) and activity recognition (e.g., medical examination, athletic competition, painting) to infer scene context. Leverages a pre-trained multi-modal model (image + audio analysis if available).
    *   Output: Contextual tags (e.g., "medical," "sport," "art," "public," "private"), Confidence score for each tag.

*   **Module: Dynamic Compliance Zone Generator:**
    *   Input: Video frame, Detected body parts (bounding boxes), Scene context tags, Confidence scores.
    *   Processing:
        1.  **Subject Tracking:** Implements a robust subject tracking algorithm (Kalman filter, DeepSORT) to maintain consistent subject identification across frames.
        2.  **Zone Creation:** Defines compliance zones *around* the tracked subject. These zones are not fixed; they adapt based on context.
            *   *Medical Context:*  Expands zones to allow for necessary exposure during examination.
            *   *Sport Context:* Expands zones based on typical athletic attire and movement.
            *   *Public/Private Context:* Adjusts zone size based on environmental cues (e.g., presence of other people, location – beach vs. hospital).
        3.  **Zone Mask Generation:** Generates a mask over the frame, highlighting the dynamic compliance zones.
    *   Output: Zone Mask, Zone Boundaries (coordinates).

*   **Module: Adaptive Scoring Engine:**
    *   Input: Uncovered body part detection scores, Zone Mask, Scene Context Tags, Zone Boundaries.
    *   Processing:
        1.  **Zone Intersection:** Determines the degree of overlap between detected uncovered body parts and the dynamic compliance zones.
        2.  **Contextual Weighting:** Applies weights to the detection scores based on the scene context tags. (e.g., a detected uncovered body part within a medical zone receives a significantly reduced score, while one outside receives a higher score).
        3.  **Exposure Level Analysis**: Analyzes the *degree* of exposure.  Is it a full reveal, partial, or obscured? The scoring reflects this granularity.  A fully obscured area might receive a minimal score.
        4.  **Intent Inference**: Attempts to infer intent.  Is the subject actively *trying* to be revealing, or is it an accidental exposure? (This is highly complex and relies on pose estimation and tracking).
        5.  **Final Score Calculation**:  Combines all factors to generate a final compliance score.
    *   Output: Adjusted Compliance Score.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Scoring Engine):**

```
function calculate_adjusted_score(detection_score, zone_overlap, context_weight, exposure_level, intent_score):
  adjusted_score = detection_score * (1 - zone_overlap) * context_weight * (1 - exposure_level) * (1-intent_score)
  return adjusted_score
```

**Novelty:**

Current systems focus solely on *detection*. This innovation introduces *contextual understanding* and *adaptive scoring*, moving beyond simple binary classification (compliant/non-compliant) to a more nuanced and accurate evaluation. It attempts to simulate human judgment, accounting for intent, context, and degree of exposure. This significantly reduces false positives and improves the usability of the system.
