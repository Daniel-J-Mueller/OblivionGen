## Dynamic Review Game Difficulty & Skill Trees

**Concept:** Expand the review game beyond simple scoring and rankings by introducing dynamic difficulty adjustment based on user skill, coupled with a skill tree system that allows users to specialize in reviewing certain types of products.

**Specifications:**

**1. Skill Tree & Review Specializations:**

*   **Categories:** Define product categories (e.g., Electronics, Books, Clothing, Home Goods).
*   **Skills:** Within each category, define specific review skills (e.g., "Technical Detail," "Comparative Analysis," "Style & Fit," "Durability Assessment").
*   **Skill Levels:** Each skill has multiple levels (e.g., Novice, Intermediate, Expert).
*   **XP Acquisition:** Users earn XP for writing reviews. XP is weighted based on review length, helpfulness votes, and the skill level relevant to the product category.
*   **Skill Unlocks:** XP unlocks higher skill levels, granting bonuses (see section 3).
*   **Skill Tree Visualization:** A user-facing interface displays the skill tree, current XP, and unlock requirements.

**2. Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:**

*   **Skill-Based Challenge:** The system assesses a user’s skill levels across various categories.
*   **Review Candidate Scoring:** Review candidates (items needing reviews) are assigned a "Difficulty Score" based on factors like:
    *   **Product Complexity:** More technical products have higher scores.
    *   **Review Depth Required:** Requests for reviews with specific criteria (e.g., "compare to competitor X") increase the score.
    *   **Existing Review Quality:** If existing reviews are poor, the difficulty increases (to encourage better submissions).
*   **Matching Algorithm:** The system matches users with review candidates where the Difficulty Score is proportional to the user’s combined skill level in relevant categories. This ensures a challenging but achievable experience.
*   **Adaptive Difficulty:**  If a user consistently receives high helpfulness votes, the Difficulty Score increases. If they struggle (low votes), it decreases.

**3. Bonuses & Rewards:**

*   **Skill-Based Bonuses:** Higher skill levels grant bonuses:
    *   **XP Multipliers:** Earn XP faster.
    *   **Review Point Boosts:**  Earn more points for each review.
    *   **Badge/Title Unlocks:**  Display accomplishments to other users.
    *   **Priority Review Access:** Get first access to highly sought-after review candidates.
*   **Challenge Rewards:** Successfully completing difficult reviews earns special badges, titles, or virtual rewards.
*   **"Master Reviewer" Status:** Users achieving high skill levels in multiple categories earn "Master Reviewer" status, granting significant benefits.

**Pseudocode (Matching Algorithm):**

```
function matchUserToReview(user, reviewCandidates):
  userSkillScore = calculateUserSkillScore(user)  //Weighted average of skill levels
  bestCandidate = null
  bestScoreDiff = infinity

  for each candidate in reviewCandidates:
    candidateDifficultyScore = calculateCandidateDifficultyScore(candidate)
    scoreDiff = abs(userSkillScore - candidateDifficultyScore)

    if scoreDiff < bestScoreDiff:
      bestScoreDiff = scoreDiff
      bestCandidate = candidate

  return bestCandidate
```

**User Interface Elements:**

*   Skill Tree Visualization (interactive map of skills and progress).
*   Review Candidate List (filtered by difficulty and user preferences).
*   Personalized Dashboard (displays progress, rankings, and rewards).
*   Badge/Title Showcase (visible to other users).
