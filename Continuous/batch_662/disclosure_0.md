## Session Drift Prediction & Pre-emptive Token Refresh

**Concept:** Instead of *reacting* to token validity based on tolerances, *predict* token drift and proactively refresh tokens before they fall outside acceptable parameters. This reduces latency and improves user experience by avoiding session interruptions.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Collection & Modeling:**

*   **Endpoint:** `/session_data` - Receives periodic (configurable interval – e.g., 5-30 seconds) telemetry data from the client.
*   **Telemetry Data:**
    *   `timestamp`: Current client time.
    *   `operation_count`: Current client operation count.
    *   `client_entropy`: A calculated value representing client-side randomness. This could include device motion data, network jitter, or other sources of variation. Crucially, *not* PII.
    *   `server_timestamp`: Server's current time (for clock skew measurement).
*   **Server-Side Model:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) is trained *per user session*. The model uses historical `timestamp` and `operation_count` data to predict future values.
*   **Clock Skew & Drift Calculation**:  Compute the clock skew (constant offset) and drift (rate of change) between the client's clock and the server's clock using the `timestamp` and `server_timestamp` data.

**2. Drift Prediction & Thresholds:**

*   **Prediction Horizon:** The model predicts `operation_count` and `timestamp` values for a configurable period (e.g., 30-60 seconds) into the future.
*   **Drift Calculation:**  The difference between the predicted values and the expected values (based on average session behavior) is calculated.  This represents the *drift*.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:**  Instead of fixed tolerance bands, dynamic thresholds are established *per session*, based on the user’s historical behavior and the current session's drift. Factors influencing the threshold:
    *   Session Age: Newer sessions have tighter thresholds.
    *   Drift Magnitude: Higher drift leads to wider thresholds.
    *   Operation Type: Some operations are more critical and require tighter security.
*    **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize an anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Isolation Forest) on the drift values to identify potential malicious activity (e.g., rapid operation count inflation).

**3. Proactive Token Refresh:**

*   **Refresh Trigger:** If the predicted drift exceeds the dynamic threshold *before* the token’s natural expiration, a token refresh is initiated.
*   **Refresh Mechanism:**  A background request is made to the `/token_refresh` endpoint.
*   **Token Rotation:**  New tokens are generated and provided to the client *before* the old token expires. The client seamlessly switches to the new token.
*   **Refresh Confirmation:** The client sends a confirmation to the server upon receiving the new token. This verifies the refresh was successful.

**4.  Server-Side Endpoints:**

*   `/session_data`: Receives telemetry data from the client.
*   `/token_refresh`: Issues new tokens based on a valid refresh request.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side - `/token_refresh` Endpoint):**

```
function handle_token_refresh(refresh_token, session_id):
  // Validate refresh token
  if not validate_refresh_token(refresh_token):
    return error("Invalid refresh token")

  // Fetch session data
  session = get_session(session_id)

  // Generate new tokens (access_token, refresh_token)
  new_access_token, new_refresh_token = generate_tokens(session)

  // Store new refresh token
  store_refresh_token(new_refresh_token, session_id)

  // Return new tokens
  return { "access_token": new_access_token, "refresh_token": new_refresh_token }
```

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Periodic Telemetry Sending):**

```
function send_session_data():
  timestamp = current_time()
  operation_count = get_operation_count()
  client_entropy = calculate_client_entropy()

  data = {
    "timestamp": timestamp,
    "operation_count": operation_count,
    "client_entropy": client_entropy
  }

  send_request("/session_data", data)
```

**Scalability Notes:**  This system requires a scalable time-series database to store session telemetry.  Consider using a distributed caching layer to store frequently accessed session data.
