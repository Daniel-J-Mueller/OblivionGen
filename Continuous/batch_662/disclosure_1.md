## Dynamic Load Balancing with Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Expand upon the ATSPSUâ€™s ability to switch between power sources by integrating predictive failure analysis and dynamic load balancing across multiple ATSPSU units within a server rack. This shifts from reactive switching to proactive distribution, minimizing downtime and optimizing power usage.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each ATSPSU unit equipped with a dedicated microcontroller (MCU) for local data collection and processing.
    *   High-speed communication bus (e.g., EtherCAT, TSN) connecting all ATSPSUs within a rack.
    *   Each ATSPSU has current and voltage sensors monitoring both AC input and DC output.
    *   Optional: Temperature sensors on critical components (PSU, ATS) for thermal monitoring.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Data Collection Module:** Each MCU collects real-time data: AC input voltage/current, DC output voltage/current, PSU/ATS temperatures, and internal diagnostic data.
    *   **Predictive Failure Model:** A machine learning model (pre-trained & periodically updated) residing on a central rack controller or distributed across ATSPSUs.  This model analyzes historical data (collected from all ATSPSUs) to predict potential PSU or ATS failures *before* they occur. Input features include:
        *   Voltage/Current trends
        *   Temperature fluctuations
        *   Diagnostic error logs
        *   Load profiles (time of day, application usage)
    *   **Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithm:**  Based on the predictive failure model, this algorithm intelligently redistributes load across healthy ATSPSUs. For example:
        *   If the model predicts a PSU failure in ATSPSU #1 within the next hour, the algorithm proactively shifts load from #1 to #2 and #3.
        *   Algorithm considers remaining battery capacity in each unit for optimized power allocation.
    *   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, real-time communication protocol (e.g., DDS) for exchanging data between ATSPSUs and the central controller.
    *   **Central Rack Controller:**  A dedicated controller (or integrated into existing rack management infrastructure) running the predictive model, load balancing algorithm, and providing a user interface for monitoring and configuration.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Load Balancing):**

```
// Within each ATSPSU MCU:
loop:
  read AC voltage/current, DC voltage/current, temperature
  send data to central controller
  receive load balancing commands from central controller
  adjust DC output current based on commands

// Within Central Controller:
loop:
  receive data from all ATSPSUs
  run Predictive Failure Model (input: historical & real-time data)
  // Predicts probability of failure for each PSU/ATS
  determine optimal load distribution (minimize risk, maximize efficiency)
  // Based on predicted failures, battery capacity, current load
  send load balancing commands to each ATSPSU MCU
  // Command format: Adjust_DC_Output(current_value)
  // Log data for model retraining
```

**Novelty:** This surpasses simple failover by *anticipating* failures and proactively distributing load, reducing downtime to zero in many cases and extending the lifespan of power components. The dynamic nature allows for optimized power usage and efficient resource allocation within the server rack.
