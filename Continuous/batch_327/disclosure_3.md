## Adaptive Data Shaping with Predictive Authorization

**Specification:**

This system extends the compute-less authorization concept by dynamically shaping the data returned to the client *before* authorization checks, based on predicted access patterns and client profiles. This minimizes data transfer and computation at the database level, streamlining authorization and improving response times.

**Components:**

1.  **Client Profiler:** A module that collects and analyzes client request history (endpoints accessed, data types requested, frequency, time of day, etc.). This creates a “client profile” predicting future data needs.
2.  **Data Shape Generator:** Utilizing the client profile, this component generates a “data shape” – a filter/projection specification dictating which fields/attributes from potential data sources should be included in the database query. 
3.  **Dynamic Query Builder:** Combines the authorization query (as defined in the original patent) *with* the data shape. This constructs a single, optimized database query that retrieves only the data needed for both authorization *and* the client's predicted use.
4.  **Authorization Engine (as per patent):** Operates on the minimized dataset to determine access.
5.  **Response Assembler:**  Formats and sends the authorized data to the client.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Query Builder):**

```
function buildDynamicQuery(clientIdentifier, apiRequest):
  clientProfile = getClientProfile(clientIdentifier)
  dataShape = generateDataShape(clientProfile, apiRequest)

  authorizationQuery = createAuthorizationQuery(clientIdentifier, apiRequest) //From original patent

  combinedQuery = mergeQueries(authorizationQuery, dataShape) //Combine using AND/OR logic.  Favor the data shape.

  return combinedQuery
```

**Data Shape Representation (Example - JSON):**

```json
{
  "table": "user_data",
  "fields": ["user_id", "username", "email"],
  "filters": [
    {"field": "status", "operator": "=", "value": "active"}
  ],
  "limit": 10
}
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  Client sends API request.
2.  Endpoint receives request.
3.  Client Profiler retrieves/updates client profile.
4.  Data Shape Generator creates a data shape based on profile and request.
5.  Dynamic Query Builder merges authorization query and data shape.
6.  Database executes combined query.
7.  Authorization Engine operates on returned data.
8.  Response Assembler sends authorized data to the client.

**Innovation Rationale:**

Traditional authorization checks often require retrieving large amounts of data from the database, even if the client only needs a small subset.  This system proactively minimizes data transfer and computation by shaping the query *before* authorization, reducing database load and improving response times.  The dynamic nature of the data shape adapts to individual client needs, optimizing performance over time. This also allows for a 'graceful degradation' of access – if authorization fails, the database has already limited the exposure of sensitive data.
