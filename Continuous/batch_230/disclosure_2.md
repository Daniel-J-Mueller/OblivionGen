## Automated Threat Modeling via Machine Image Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Expand the scanning process to *actively* analyze machine image behavior within a sandboxed environment to generate automated threat models, not just identify existing vulnerabilities. This moves beyond signature/rule-based detection and begins to predict potential attack vectors based on observed actions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Sandbox Environment:**

*   **Core:** A containerized environment (Docker, Kubernetes) providing isolated execution of machine images.
*   **Instrumentation:** Deep system call tracing, network traffic monitoring, file system activity logging, and memory access tracking *within* the containerized machine image.  Focus on capturing *sequences* of actions.
*   **Resource Limits:**  Configurable CPU, memory, network bandwidth limits to prevent runaway processes and control the analysis timeframe.
*   **API Interface:**  Expose an API for initiating sandbox executions, configuring resource limits, and retrieving analysis results.

**2.  Action Sequence Database & Threat Model Generation:**

*   **Data Structure:** A time-series database (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) optimized for storing and querying sequences of system calls, network events, and file system actions.  Each event tagged with a timestamp and originating process.
*   **Sequence Pattern Mining:** Employ algorithms like PrefixSpan or SPADE to discover frequent and statistically significant action sequences.  These sequences represent common "behaviors" of the machine image.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Use machine learning models (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) trained on "normal" behavior sequences to identify deviations that may indicate malicious activity.  The model should learn acceptable patterns, and deviations from those.
*   **Threat Modeling Engine:**  Map observed behavior sequences (and anomalies) to potential attack vectors based on a knowledge base of common exploits and vulnerabilities.  For example:
    *   A sequence of `connect()` system calls to external IPs, followed by `exec()` of a shell script, might be flagged as potential command-and-control activity.
    *   Repeated attempts to write to system directories without appropriate permissions could indicate privilege escalation attempts.
    *   Use of obfuscated code (identified via static analysis *within* the sandbox) combined with network connections could signal malware.
*   **Output:** Generate a structured threat model report detailing:
    *   Observed behavior sequences
    *   Identified anomalies
    *   Potential attack vectors
    *   Severity scoring (based on exploitability and impact)
    *   Mitigation recommendations

**3.  Integration with Scanning Service:**

*   **Scan Request Enhancement:** Modify the scan request API to include a flag indicating whether to perform behavioral analysis.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Receive scan request.
    2.  If behavioral analysis is enabled:
        *   Deploy machine image to behavioral sandbox.
        *   Monitor image for a pre-defined timeframe.
        *   Collect and analyze behavioral data.
        *   Generate threat model.
    3.  Combine results from traditional vulnerability scanning and behavioral analysis.
    4.  Provide a comprehensive scan report.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Behavioral Analysis Loop):**

```
function analyze_behavior(image):
  sandbox = create_sandbox(image)
  events = []
  start_time = current_time()

  while current_time() - start_time < max_analysis_time:
    event = sandbox.capture_event() # System call, network event, file access
    events.append(event)

  behavior_sequences = extract_sequences(events)
  anomalies = detect_anomalies(behavior_sequences)
  threat_model = generate_threat_model(anomalies)

  return threat_model
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond detecting known vulnerabilities. It aims to *predict* potential exploits based on how the machine image *behaves*.  It's a proactive security measure that can identify zero-day threats and sophisticated attacks that traditional scanning methods would miss. The focus on sequence analysis is key â€“ simply identifying individual malicious actions isn't enough; it's the *order* in which they occur that often reveals malicious intent.
