## Secure Attestation via Dynamic Root of Trust Provisioning

**Concept:** Extend the secure boot process to allow for dynamic updates *of* the root of trust itself, leveraging a hardware-isolated attestation service. This addresses scenarios where the initial root of trust (e.g., embedded key in a fuse) is compromised or needs to be rotated for enhanced security, or if the device needs to dynamically adapt to a changing security landscape.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Secure Attestation Unit (SAU):** A dedicated hardware module physically isolated from the main processor.  The SAU holds a *cryptographically unique* device identity (DID) and a corresponding private key. This key *never* leaves the SAU.  The SAU also includes a secure random number generator (RNG) and a hardware accelerator for cryptographic operations (SHA-256, ECDSA, etc.).
*   **Fuse-Based Memory:** Used to store a *bootstrap* root of trust – a small initial public key and metadata used to initiate secure communication with a remote Attestation Server. This bootstrap key is used *only* to establish a secure channel.
*   **Persistent Storage:** (e.g., eMMC, UFS) – For storing current certificate version indicators and key version indicators, as in the provided patent.  Also stores the Attestation Server’s public key.
*   **Processor:** Standard application processor with secure boot capabilities.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Secure Bootloader:** Modified to incorporate the attestation process.
*   **Attestation Client:**  Software running on the processor responsible for communicating with the SAU and the Attestation Server.
*   **Attestation Server:** A remote server responsible for verifying the device’s identity and providing updated root of trust information.

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Boot:** The processor boots using the standard secure boot process, verifying the integrity of the bootloader.
2.  **Attestation Request:** The bootloader initiates the attestation process by signaling the SAU.
3.  **SAU Signature:** The SAU generates a digitally signed attestation message containing its unique DID and a timestamp. This message is signed using the SAU’s private key.
4.  **Attestation Transmission:** The signed attestation message is transmitted to the Attestation Server via the processor.
5.  **Verification & Root of Trust Update:**
    *   The Attestation Server verifies the signature using the known SAU public key (provisioned during manufacturing or updated via a previous secure channel).
    *   If verification is successful, the Attestation Server determines if a root of trust update is required based on device policy, security alerts, or pre-defined schedules.
    *   If an update is required, the Attestation Server generates a new root of trust package – including a new public key, associated metadata, and a digital signature. This package is encrypted using the processor’s public key.
6.  **Secure Delivery & Installation:** The encrypted root of trust package is transmitted to the processor. The processor decrypts the package and securely installs the new root of trust information into the persistent storage. *This installation is protected by the existing, bootstrap root of trust.*
7.  **Root of Trust Rotation:** The processor utilizes the *new* root of trust for future attestation requests. The old root of trust is marked as invalid and can be overwritten.

**4. Pseudocode (Attestation Client – Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function performAttestation():
  // 1. Signal SAU to generate attestation message
  attestationMessage = SAU.generateAttestation()

  // 2. Transmit attestation message to Attestation Server
  serverResponse = sendToAttestationServer(attestationMessage)

  // 3. Check for errors
  if serverResponse.error:
    logError(serverResponse.errorMessage)
    return false

  // 4. Check for root of trust update
  if serverResponse.updateAvailable:
    encryptedRootOfTrustPackage = serverResponse.rootOfTrustPackage
    // 5. Decrypt package
    decryptedPackage = decryptWithProcessorPrivateKey(encryptedRootOfTrustPackage)
    // 6. Install updated root of trust
    installNewRootOfTrust(decryptedPackage)
    logInfo("Root of trust updated successfully.")

  return true
```

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   **SAU Tamper Resistance:** The SAU must be physically tamper-resistant to prevent attackers from extracting the private key.
*   **Secure Communication:** All communication between the processor and the Attestation Server must be encrypted using strong cryptographic protocols (e.g., TLS 1.3).
*   **Attestation Server Security:** The Attestation Server must be highly secure and protected from unauthorized access.
*   **Rollback Protection:** The system must implement rollback protection mechanisms to prevent attackers from downgrading to a previous, vulnerable root of trust.
