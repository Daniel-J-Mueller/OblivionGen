## Adaptive File Shadowing with Behavioral Heuristics

**Concept:** Augment static entropy analysis with dynamic behavioral profiling of file access patterns to preemptively create “shadow copies” *before* malicious encryption begins, and to identify anomalies indicative of ransomware activity with higher precision.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler Module:**
    *   **Data Collection:** Monitor file access patterns (read, write, execute, delete) for each file over a rolling time window (configurable – default 24 hours). Capture access frequency, size of data accessed, user/process initiating access, and time of day.
    *   **Baseline Creation:** Establish a baseline behavioral profile for each file based on collected data. This profile includes statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, percentiles) for access frequency, data size, and time-based access patterns.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Compare real-time file access patterns against the established baseline. Utilize statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, moving average) to identify deviations exceeding a predefined threshold. This threshold should be adaptive, adjusting based on file type and historical anomaly rates.

2.  **Adaptive Shadowing Engine:**
    *   **Shadow Copy Trigger:** Initiate a shadow copy *not* solely based on entropy changes, but on *combined* entropy change *and* behavioral anomalies.
    *   **Shadow Copy Granularity:** Support multiple shadow copy granularities – full file, block-level incremental, or changed block tracking (CBT). Granularity selection should be dynamic, based on file type, file size, and the severity of the detected anomaly.
    *   **Shadow Copy Storage:** Utilize a tiered storage approach – fast storage (SSD/NVMe) for recent/critical shadow copies, slower storage (HDD/cloud) for older/less critical copies.
    *   **Version Control:** Maintain a version history of shadow copies, allowing for rollback to previous versions.

3.  **Predictive Encryption Blocking:**
    *   **Correlation Engine:** Correlate behavioral anomalies with entropy changes and file modification patterns.
    *   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each file based on the correlation results.
    *   **Preemptive Blocking:** If the risk score exceeds a predefined threshold, proactively block further write access to the file. This can be achieved by virtualizing the file access and monitoring all write attempts, preventing malicious encryption.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// For each monitored file:
    Collect File Access Data (Read, Write, Execute, Delete)
    Establish Baseline Behavioral Profile
    
    // Real-time monitoring loop:
    Calculate Current Entropy Value
    Monitor File Access Patterns
    Detect Behavioral Anomalies
    
    Calculate Risk Score = (EntropyChangeWeight * EntropyChange) + (AnomalyWeight * AnomalyScore)
    
    If RiskScore > Threshold:
        Virtualize File Access
        Monitor Write Attempts
        If Write Attempt is deemed malicious (based on file type, data pattern, etc.):
            Block Write Attempt
            Rollback to last known good Shadow Copy
        Else:
            Allow Write Attempt
    Else:
        //Regular file access
        Continue Monitoring
```

*   Fast storage (SSD/NVMe) for recent shadow copies.
*   Network connectivity for cloud storage integration.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Operating system integration for file system monitoring.
*   Virtualization framework for file access control.
*   Machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection.
*   Cloud storage API integration (optional).
