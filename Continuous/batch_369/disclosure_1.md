## Adaptive Key Rotation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the key management system by integrating behavioral biometrics as an authorization factor *during* key rotation, creating a dynamic, trust-evolving system. This goes beyond simply verifying signatures; it verifies *how* a user/device interacts while authorizing a key change.

**Specification:**

1.  **Behavioral Profile Creation:**
    *   Each device (or user associated with a device) maintains a behavioral profile.
    *   Profile data includes: keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, touch screen pressure/speed variations, network traffic timing characteristics (inter-packet arrival times, burstiness), and CPU/Memory usage patterns during authorization attempts.
    *   Data is collected during initial setup and ongoing operation (with user/device consent and privacy safeguards). A rolling window of recent data is used for comparison.

2.  **Key Rotation Request:**
    *   Initiated by a designated device or operator (following existing quorum rules in the provided patent).
    *   The request includes a proposed new domain trust version and associated keys.

3.  **Behavioral Challenge:**
    *   Before a key rotation is authorized, the requesting device receives a behavioral challenge.
    *   The challenge isn't a static prompt. It dynamically adjusts based on the device’s typical activity. For example:
        *   If the device primarily uses a keyboard, the challenge might involve a specific typing task.
        *   If it's a touch-based device, a pattern-drawing task.
        *   If it's server-side, the challenge could involve simulating a specific network request pattern.

4.  **Behavioral Analysis & Scoring:**
    *   The device completes the challenge.
    *   A dedicated behavioral analysis module (either on the device or a trusted server) compares the device’s current behavior to its established behavioral profile.
    *   A behavioral score is calculated (e.g., 0-100).  Higher scores indicate a stronger match.

5.  **Adaptive Quorum Adjustment:**
    *   The behavioral score is used to *dynamically adjust* the required quorum for key rotation.
    *   *High Score (e.g., 90-100):* Lower the quorum requirement, accelerating key rotation. Implies a very high degree of confidence in the requester.
    *   *Medium Score (e.g., 60-89):* Maintain standard quorum rules.
    *   *Low Score (e.g., <60):* Increase quorum requirement or reject the request outright.  Indicates potential compromise or unauthorized attempt.  Initiate secondary authentication.

6.  **Key Rotation Execution:**
    *   If the quorum is met (adjusted or standard), the key rotation proceeds as defined in the original patent.
    *   The behavioral profile is updated with the latest data.

7.  **Token Extension:**
    *   The token generated after key rotation includes not just the new keys, but a timestamp reflecting the behavioral score at the time of authorization.
    *   This timestamp/score is included in subsequent trust validations.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function authorizeKeyRotation(request, device) {
  behavioralScore = analyzeBehavior(device, generateChallenge());

  adjustedQuorum = calculateAdjustedQuorum(behavioralScore);

  if (verifyQuorum(request, adjustedQuorum)) {
    // Execute key rotation
    newKeys = rotateKeys(request);
    token = generateToken(newKeys, behavioralScore);
    return token;
  } else {
    //Reject Request or initiate secondary Authentication
    return "Unauthorized";
  }
}

function analyzeBehavior(device, challenge) {
  // Capture device's response to the challenge
  response = device.respondTo(challenge);
  //Compare Response to established Profile
  score = compareToProfile(response);
  return score;
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated hardware security module (HSM) for storing behavioral profiles and performing analysis.
*   Secure enclave for capturing device behavior without exposing sensitive data.

**Privacy Considerations:**

*   Data minimization: collect only necessary behavioral data.
*   Anonymization: encrypt or hash behavioral data.
*   User consent: obtain explicit consent before collecting and using behavioral data.
*   Transparency: provide users with clear information about how their behavioral data is used.
