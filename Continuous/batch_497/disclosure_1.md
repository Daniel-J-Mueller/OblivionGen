## Dynamic Event Model Composition from Learned Behavioral Patterns

**Specification:** A system for composing event detector models dynamically by learning behavioral patterns from historical IoT data streams, and then assembling those patterns into complex, context-aware detectors.

**Core Concept:** Instead of manually defining state transitions and actions, the system *learns* common and exceptional behavioral sequences from data, and uses those learned sequences to build detectors. This moves beyond static model verification to adaptive, data-driven detection.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Pattern Miner:**
    *   **Input:** Historical IoT data streams (time-series data from various devices).
    *   **Process:** Employs sequence mining algorithms (e.g., PrefixSpan, GSP) to identify frequently occurring behavioral patterns. Patterns are represented as sequences of events (device states, values, alerts). Algorithms should identify both common patterns *and* statistically significant deviations from those patterns (anomaly detection).
    *   **Output:** A library of learned behavioral patterns, each associated with a confidence score and a description (human-readable label generated via NLP analysis of the patternâ€™s constituent events).

2.  **Pattern Composition Engine:**
    *   **Input:** A set of user-defined context parameters (e.g., location, time of day, user profile) and the library of learned behavioral patterns.
    *   **Process:** 
        *   Filters the pattern library based on the context parameters.
        *   Dynamically assembles a composite event detector model by chaining the filtered patterns.  This involves defining state transitions where the output of one pattern becomes the input to the next. 
        *   A 'fuzzy logic' layer allows for probabilistic transitions between patterns, handling uncertainty in the IoT data.
        *   A 'conflict resolution' module handles overlapping or contradictory patterns.
    *   **Output:** A deployable event detector model (represented as a state machine with associated actions).

3.  **Adaptive Model Refinement:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time IoT data and feedback from the deployed detector model.
    *   **Process:** Monitors the performance of the deployed detector.  If the detector triggers false positives or misses critical events, the system initiates a refinement loop:
        *   New data is added to the historical dataset.
        *   The Behavioral Pattern Miner is re-run.
        *   The Pattern Composition Engine generates a new detector model.
        *   The new model is deployed (potentially via A/B testing).

**Pseudocode (Pattern Composition Engine):**

```pseudocode
function compose_detector(context_parameters, pattern_library):
  filtered_patterns = filter_patterns(pattern_library, context_parameters)
  detector_model = new StateMachine()
  
  // Initial state: wait for first pattern to match
  initial_state = new State("Waiting")
  detector_model.add_state(initial_state)

  current_state = initial_state
  
  for pattern in filtered_patterns:
    new_state = new State(pattern.description)
    detector_model.add_state(new_state)
    
    // Create transition from current state to new state based on pattern match
    transition = new Transition(current_state, new_state, pattern.match_condition)
    detector_model.add_transition(transition)
    
    current_state = new_state

  // Add final state (e.g., Alert triggered)
  final_state = new State("Alert")
  detector_model.add_state(final_state)

  //Add transition from the last state to the alert state.
  transition = new Transition(current_state, final_state, "Pattern sequence complete.")
  detector_model.add_transition(transition)

  return detector_model
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems rely on *static* models defined by human experts. This system aims to create *dynamic*, *self-learning* detectors that adapt to changing conditions and optimize performance over time.  The combination of sequence mining, fuzzy logic, and adaptive refinement offers a more robust and intelligent approach to IoT event detection.
