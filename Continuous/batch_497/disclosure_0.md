## Predictive Crime Mapping & Dynamic Reward Allocation

**System Overview:** A localized, real-time crime prediction and reward system leveraging distributed A/V devices and a dynamic reward algorithm. This goes beyond simply reacting to reported incidents; it proactively anticipates potential crime hotspots and incentivizes preventative observation.

**Core Components:**

*   **Distributed Sensor Network:** Utilizing existing and new A/V devices (doorbells, security cameras, dashcams, smartphones) as a distributed sensor network.  These devices aren't just *reporting* incidents, they’re contributing to a predictive model.
*   **AI-Powered Predictive Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical crime data, real-time sensor input (motion detection, sound analysis, object recognition), and environmental factors (weather, time of day, proximity to known hotspots).  This engine generates a “risk map” showing areas with a heightened probability of criminal activity.
*   **Dynamic Reward Pool:** A digital “reward pool” funded by local businesses, insurance companies, or a municipal budget. The size of the reward is *not* fixed. It is dynamically adjusted based on the predicted risk level, the quality of the evidence captured, and the potential impact of preventing a crime.
*   **Gamified User Interface:** A mobile app that allows users to opt-in to participate.  Users are assigned “observation zones” based on their location and movement. The app displays a risk map, highlights areas needing observation, and provides real-time updates.
*   **Automated Reward Distribution:** A secure blockchain-based system for automated reward distribution. Rewards are issued immediately upon verification of evidence.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Risk Assessment:** The Predictive Engine continuously analyzes data to generate a risk map.
2.  **Zone Activation:**  When a zone’s risk level exceeds a threshold, the app activates observation requests to nearby users.
3.  **User Engagement:**  Users with the app open within an active zone receive a notification. The app encourages users to keep their A/V devices focused on the area.
4.  **Event Detection:**  A/V devices analyze footage for suspicious activity. The system prioritizes events based on AI-powered object recognition and anomaly detection.
5.  **Evidence Submission:** When potential suspicious activity is detected, the app prompts the user to submit the footage.
6.  **Reward Calculation:** The system calculates the reward based on the following factors:
    *   **Risk Level:** Higher risk zones generate higher rewards.
    *   **Evidence Quality:** Clear, unambiguous footage receives a higher reward.
    *   **Impact Prevention:** Preventing a crime (e.g., capturing footage that deters a potential burglar) generates a higher reward than simply capturing footage of a crime in progress.
7.  **Reward Distribution:** Rewards are instantly distributed to the user’s digital wallet.
8.  **Data Feedback Loop:** Data from successful interventions is fed back into the Predictive Engine to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Reward Calculation):**

```
function calculateReward(riskLevel, evidenceQuality, impactPrevention) {
  baseReward = 10  // Base reward in USD

  riskMultiplier = 1 + (riskLevel * 0.2)  // Higher risk = higher multiplier
  qualityMultiplier = 1 + (evidenceQuality * 0.1) // Better quality = higher multiplier
  impactMultiplier = 1 + (impactPrevention * 0.3) // Higher impact = higher multiplier

  calculatedReward = baseReward * riskMultiplier * qualityMultiplier * impactMultiplier

  return calculatedReward
}
```

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   Existing A/V Devices (doorbells, security cameras, dashcams, smartphones) - compatible with standard video/audio streaming protocols
*   Edge Computing Devices (optional) - for local video processing and anomaly detection.
*   Secure Blockchain Network - for reward distribution and data integrity.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond reactive crime reporting to proactive crime prevention. The dynamic reward algorithm incentivizes targeted observation in areas with a high probability of criminal activity, increasing the chances of deterring crime before it happens. The combination of distributed sensors, AI-powered prediction, and blockchain-based reward distribution creates a unique and potentially highly effective crime prevention system.
