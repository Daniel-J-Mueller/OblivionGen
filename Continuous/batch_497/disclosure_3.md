## Dynamic Payment Condition Stacking & Negotiation

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond static payment instruction sets to allow for dynamic condition stacking and real-time negotiation of payment terms *during* a transaction. The existing patent focuses on pre-defined rules. This aims for adaptable, in-flight adjustment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Condition Objects:**

*   Data Structure: `ConditionObject { condition_type (string), value (variant), operator (string, e.g., "==", ">=", "<=", "IN"), resolution_source (string, e.g., "provider_API", "recipient_API", "external_service"), timestamp (datetime) }`
*   Condition Types: Examples include: "recipient_stock_level", "weather_condition", "provider_performance_rating", "consumer_loyalty_score", "time_of_day", "competitor_pricing".
*   Resolution Source: Specifies how the condition's value is determined (API call, database lookup, external data feed).

**2. Payment Negotiation Engine:**

*   Input: Initial Payment Request (amount, recipient, provider), Provider Payment Instruction Set (base conditions), Recipient Payment Instruction Set (counter conditions).
*   Process:
    1.  Evaluate Base Conditions: Check conditions from the provider's instruction set.
    2.  Counter-Condition Introduction: The recipient can introduce *new* `ConditionObject`s to modify payment terms. These are prioritized based on pre-defined weighting (e.g., recipient urgency overrides provider stock level).
    3.  Dynamic Condition Stacking: Conditions are applied sequentially. Each evaluated condition may *change* the payment amount, delivery timeframe, or service level.
    4.  Real-time Valuation: Each condition evaluation is linked to a valuation function. This function determines how the condition impacts the overall payment.
    5.  Acceptance Threshold: A pre-defined threshold dictates the minimum acceptable payment change before requiring explicit user (consumer/provider) approval.
    6.  Negotiation Log: A detailed log of all condition evaluations and changes to the payment amount is recorded for auditing and dispute resolution.

**3. API Endpoints:**

*   `/negotiate_payment`: Accepts initial payment request, provider instruction set, recipient instruction set. Returns a dynamic payment offer with real-time adjustments.
*   `/add_condition`: Allows recipient to introduce new `ConditionObject`s during the negotiation process.
*   `/condition_resolution`: Provides a standardized interface for resolving condition values from various sources (APIs, databases).

**4. Data Flow:**

1.  Consumer initiates a transaction with a Retailer.
2.  The Retailer sends a Payment Request with its Payment Instruction Set to the Negotiation Engine.
3.  The Negotiation Engine receives the Payment Instruction Set and evaluates any initial conditions.
4.  The Negotiation Engine contacts the Consumer and the Provider via API.
5.  The Negotiation Engine contacts each Consumer's/Provider's API to dynamically evaluate Conditions.
6.  The Negotiation Engine dynamically adjusts the payment amount and delivers a counter-offer to the Consumer.
7.  The Consumer reviews and accepts the revised payment.
8.  The system facilitates the payment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function negotiatePayment(paymentRequest, providerInstructions, recipientInstructions) {
  dynamicPayment = paymentRequest.amount;
  conditionStack = [providerInstructions];

  for (condition in recipientInstructions) {
    conditionStack.push(condition);
  }

  for (condition in conditionStack) {
    conditionValue = resolveCondition(condition.resolution_source, condition.condition_type);

    if (condition.operator == "==" && conditionValue == condition.value) {
      dynamicPayment = adjustPayment(dynamicPayment, condition.adjustment_amount);
    } else if (condition.operator == ">=" && conditionValue >= condition.value) {
        dynamicPayment = adjustPayment(dynamicPayment, condition.adjustment_amount);
    }
    // ... other operators
  }
  return dynamicPayment;
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Dynamic Pricing:** Adjust prices based on real-time demand, competitor pricing, and consumer loyalty.
*   **Subscription Management:** Automatically adjust subscription fees based on usage patterns and service quality.
*   **Supply Chain Optimization:** Negotiate payment terms with suppliers based on delivery performance and material availability.
*   **Service Level Agreements:** Automatically adjust service fees based on actual service delivery metrics.
