## Adaptive Notification Projection

**Concept:** Extend location-based notifications beyond the device itself, projecting relevant information onto nearby surfaces using pico-projection or similar micro-display technology. This goes beyond simply changing the notification *on* the device; it creates augmented reality notifications in the user’s immediate environment.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integrated Pico-Projector: A miniature projector embedded within the mobile device, capable of projecting a visible image onto nearby surfaces. Resolution: Minimum 720p. Brightness: Adjustable, up to 50 lumens. Throw Ratio: Optimized for short-throw projection (0.8:1 or less).
    *   Environmental Sensor Suite: Includes ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, and potentially a basic depth sensor (time-of-flight or similar) to analyze the projection surface and adjust projection parameters.
    *   Calibration System: Internal mechanism (likely accelerometer/gyroscope + camera) to automatically calibrate the projection based on device orientation and surface detection.
*   **Software:**
    *   Location Awareness Module: Utilizes existing location data (GPS, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) to determine the user's current location.
    *   Surface Detection Algorithm: Analyzes the camera feed to identify suitable projection surfaces (walls, floors, tables). Prioritizes flat, matte surfaces.
    *   Content Adaptation Engine: Dynamically adjusts notification content based on the projection surface size, ambient lighting, and user preferences.
    *   Notification Prioritization Protocol: Ranks notifications based on urgency and relevance. High-priority notifications are projected first.
    *   Projection Control API: Enables third-party applications to create and manage projected notifications.
    *   User Interface: Allows users to customize projection settings (brightness, size, duration, enabled apps).
*   **Operational Logic:**

```pseudocode
// Main loop
while (device is active) {
  location = getLocation();
  notifications = getNotifications();

  // Filter notifications based on location/context
  relevantNotifications = filterNotifications(notifications, location);

  // Identify suitable projection surface
  surface = detectProjectionSurface();

  if (surface != null && relevantNotifications.size() > 0) {

    //Prioritize & queue notifications
    prioritizedQueue = prioritizeNotifications(relevantNotifications);
    
    for each (notification in prioritizedQueue) {
      // Adapt notification content for projection
      projectedContent = adaptContent(notification, surface);
      
      // Project content onto surface
      project(projectedContent, surface);
      
      // Wait for a specified duration or user interaction
      waitFor(duration or interaction);
      
      // Clear projection
      clearProjection();
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Use Cases:**

*   **Navigation:** Project turn-by-turn directions onto the road ahead.
*   **Smart Home:** Project smart home control panels onto nearby walls (e.g., lighting controls, thermostat settings).
*   **Reminders:** Project reminders onto surfaces where relevant objects are located (e.g., “Pick up milk” projected onto the refrigerator).
*   **Contextual Information:** Project information about nearby points of interest (e.g., restaurant menus, historical facts).
*   **Gaming:** Integrate projected notifications into augmented reality games.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Gesture Control:** Allow users to interact with projected notifications using hand gestures.
*   **Multi-Surface Projection:** Project notifications across multiple surfaces simultaneously.
*   **Dynamic Projection Mapping:** Adapt projected content to the shape and texture of the projection surface.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Implement mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to projected notifications.
*   **Integration with AR/VR Headsets:** Extend projected notifications into augmented and virtual reality environments.
