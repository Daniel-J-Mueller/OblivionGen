## Adaptive Authentication Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the layered authentication approach with a dynamic weighting system applied to each authentication layer’s success/failure. Instead of a strict pass/fail, layers contribute a ‘trust score’. A final access decision is based on the aggregate trust score exceeding a defined threshold. This allows for graceful degradation and more nuanced risk assessment.

**Specifications:**

*   **Components:**
    *   *Authentication Layer Modules (ALMs)*: Modular authentication checks (e.g., credential validation, geolocation, device fingerprinting, behavioral biometrics). Each ALM is assignable to one or more authentication tiers.
    *   *Trust Score Calculator (TSC)*: Aggregate trust score based on ALM outputs.
    *   *Policy Engine (PE)*: Configures ALM weights, tier assignments, and access thresholds.
    *   *Data Store*: Stores ALM results, historical trust scores, and policies.

*   **ALM Operation:**
    1.  ALM receives request data.
    2.  ALM performs authentication check.
    3.  ALM outputs a trust score (0.0 - 1.0) reflecting confidence in the request’s legitimacy.  Factors considered include:
        *   Strength of authentication method.
        *   Data source reliability.
        *   Anomaly detection.
    4.  ALM logs result and timestamp to Data Store.

*   **TSC Operation:**
    1.  Receives trust scores from all executed ALMs.
    2.  Applies weights configured in PE to each ALM's score.
    3.  Calculates a total trust score.
    4.  Compares total score to access threshold defined in PE.
    5.  Outputs access decision (grant/deny).

*   **PE Operation:**
    1.  Allows administrators to:
        *   Configure ALM weights (importance of each check). Weights are adjustable in real-time.
        *   Assign ALMs to authentication tiers. (e.g. Tier 1: Basic checks, Tier 2: Enhanced checks).
        *   Define access thresholds for each tier.
        *   Implement dynamic threshold adjustment based on observed risk levels (e.g., increased thresholds during peak attack times).
        *   Define automated escalation rules for suspicious activity.

*   **Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(ALM_Results, PE_Config) {
  totalScore = 0;
  for each ALM_Result in ALM_Results {
    ALM_Weight = PE_Config.getALMWeight(ALM_Result.ALM_ID);
    totalScore += ALM_Result.TrustScore * ALM_Weight;
  }
  return totalScore;
}

function authorizeRequest(ALM_Results, PE_Config) {
  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(ALM_Results, PE_Config);
  threshold = PE_Config.getAccessThreshold();
  if (trustScore >= threshold) {
    return "GRANT";
  } else {
    return "DENY";
  }
}
```

*   **Data Store Schema:**
    *   `ALM_Results`: (`Result_ID`, `ALM_ID`, `Timestamp`, `TrustScore`, `Request_ID`)
    *   `PE_Config`: (`Config_ID`, `ALM_Weight_<ALM_ID>`, `AccessThreshold`)
    *   `Request_ID`: Links results to specific requests.

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   *Behavioral Analysis*: Track user behavior and adjust trust scores based on deviations from normal patterns.
    *   *Threat Intelligence Integration*: Incorporate threat intelligence feeds to adjust weights for ALMs that assess known malicious sources.
    *   *Adaptive Learning*: Use machine learning to automatically adjust ALM weights and thresholds based on historical data and observed attack patterns.
