    *   LiDAR Scanners
    *   RFID Readers (Short-Range)
    *   Ultrasonic Sensors (Proximity/Obstacle Avoidance)
    *   Edge Computing Unit (Onboard Processing)
    *   Secure Wireless Communication (Mesh Network)
*   **Central Processing Unit (Server-Side):** High-Performance Computing Cluster
    *   Real-Time Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline
    *   3D Mapping & Reconstruction Software
    *   Object Recognition & Classification AI Models
    *   Inventory Database (Linked to Item IDs, Locations, & Quantities)
    *   Anomaly Detection Algorithms (For Missing/Misplaced Items)
*   **User Interface:** Real-Time Visual Dashboard
    *   Interactive 3D Map of Facility
    *   Item Search & Filtering
    *   Inventory Reports & Analytics
    *   Alerting System (For Low Stock, Discrepancies, etc.)

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Drone Deployment:** Drone swarm autonomously launches and navigates pre-defined flight paths within the facility. Paths can be dynamically adjusted based on real-time conditions.
2.  **Multi-Modal Data Capture:** Each drone simultaneously collects data from its sensors (RGB, Thermal, LiDAR, RFID, Ultrasonic).
3.  **Edge Processing:** Onboard edge computing units perform initial data filtering, compression, and feature extraction. This minimizes bandwidth requirements and processing load on the central server.
4.  **Data Fusion:** Raw data streams from all drones are transmitted to the central processing unit. The system utilizes data fusion algorithms to combine information from different sensors.
    *   **RGB & LiDAR:** Generate a high-resolution 3D map of the facility.
    *   **Thermal Imaging:** Detect temperature variations, potentially identifying mislabeled or damaged goods.
    *   **RFID Scanning:** Identify items with RFID tags and automatically update inventory levels.
    *   **Ultrasonic Sensors:** Refine the 3D map around obstacles and improve accuracy of item localization.
5.  **Inventory Mapping & Update:** The fused data is used to create a real-time 3D map of the facilityâ€™s inventory. Items are automatically identified, localized, and quantified. The inventory database is updated accordingly.
6.  **Anomaly Detection:** The system continuously monitors inventory levels and locations. Any discrepancies (e.g., missing items, misplaced goods) are flagged as anomalies.
7.  **User Interaction:** Users can access the real-time inventory map and data through the interactive dashboard. They can search for specific items, generate reports, and receive alerts about any anomalies.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
FUNCTION DetectAnomalies(inventory_data, expected_inventory) {
  FOR EACH item IN inventory_data {
    IF (item.quantity != expected_inventory[item.id]) {
      GENERATE ALERT("Quantity Discrepancy: " + item.id + " - Expected: " + expected_inventory[item.id] + " - Actual: " + item.quantity)
    }

    IF (item.location != expected_inventory[item.id].location) {
      GENERATE ALERT("Location Discrepancy: " + item.id + " - Expected: " + expected_inventory[item.id].location + " - Actual: " + item.location)
    }
  }
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Proactive Inventory Management:** Unlike current systems that rely on manual audits or periodic scans, this system provides continuous, real-time inventory monitoring.
*   **Multi-Modal Data Fusion:** Combining data from multiple sensors creates a more robust and accurate inventory map.
*   **Autonomous Operation:** Drone swarm eliminates the need for manual labor and reduces the risk of human error.
*   **Scalability:** The system can be easily scaled to accommodate facilities of any size.
*   **Thermal Imaging Application:** Utilizing thermal imaging to identify potentially damaged or improperly stored goods adds a unique layer of insight.
