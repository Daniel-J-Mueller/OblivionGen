## Adaptive Policy Mirroring & Distributed Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the secure proxy's policy enforcement to *mirror* policy configurations across interconnected proxies in a distributed network, combined with a dynamic trust scoring system for endpoints. This goes beyond simply resolving and authenticating addresses; it proactively shapes the security landscape *around* the traffic.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Policy Mirroring Engine (PME):** Resides within each secure proxy. Responsible for:
    *   Receiving and storing a 'base' policy set from a central authority (or designated primary proxy).
    *   Applying local modifications to the base policy set (e.g., region-specific rules, application-specific overrides).
    *   Propagating modified policies to neighboring proxies (defined by network topology or administrative grouping). Policy propagation uses a versioned, delta-based approach to minimize bandwidth usage.
*   **Distributed Trust Scoring System (DTSS):** Each proxy maintains a trust score for each endpoint it interacts with. This score is dynamically updated based on:
    *   Endpoint's historical behavior (e.g., adherence to policies, data integrity).
    *   Reputation data from external threat intelligence feeds.
    *   Peer assessments from neighboring proxies (sharing trust scores based on observed behavior).
*   **Behavioral Anomaly Detection (BAD):** A module integrated with both PME and DTSS. Monitors network traffic patterns and flags deviations from established baselines. These anomalies contribute to trust score adjustments and may trigger automated policy enforcement actions.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Policy Distribution:** The central authority distributes the base policy set to primary proxies. Primary proxies propagate to their connected neighbors.
2.  **Local Policy Adaptation:** Each proxy applies local modifications to the received policy, tailoring it to its specific environment.
3.  **Endpoint Interaction:** When an application requests access to a service, the secure proxy:
    *   Resolves the service’s network address.
    *   Consults its local DTSS to determine the endpoint's trust score.
    *   Applies a combined policy set based on the base policy, local modifications, and the endpoint’s trust score.  (e.g. low trust score = stricter policy enforcement).
4.  **Dynamic Trust Adjustment:** As the endpoint interacts with the network:
    *   BAD module monitors traffic patterns.
    *   Any anomalous behavior detected lowers the endpoint’s trust score.
    *   Positive behavior increases the trust score.
    *   Trust score changes propagate to neighboring proxies.
5. **Policy Recalibration**: Proxies utilize updated trust scores to dynamically alter active policies.

**III. Pseudocode (Policy Enforcement Engine):**

```
function enforcePolicy(request, endpointAddress) {
  policySet = getBasePolicy() + getLocalModifications()
  trustScore = getEndpointTrustScore(endpointAddress)

  //Policy weighting based on trust score.
  policyWeight = mapTrustScoreToWeight(trustScore)

  finalPolicy = applyWeighting(policySet, policyWeight)

  if (finalPolicy.matches(request)) {
    //Allow request
    log("Request allowed for " + endpointAddress)
    return true
  } else {
    //Block request
    log("Request blocked for " + endpointAddress)
    return false
  }
}

function mapTrustScoreToWeight(trustScore) {
    //Example mapping:
    if (trustScore > 0.8) {
        return 1.0  // Full policy enforcement
    } else if (trustScore > 0.5) {
        return 0.75 // Moderate enforcement
    } else {
        return 0.25 // Minimal enforcement
    }
}
```

**IV. Novelty & Potential:**

*   **Distributed Trust:** Moves beyond static whitelisting to a dynamic trust model that adapts to endpoint behavior.
*   **Proactive Security:** Shapes the security landscape *around* the traffic by influencing policy enforcement based on trust.
*   **Resilience:**  The distributed nature of the system enhances resilience against single points of failure.
* **Automated Learning**: Machine learning can be implemented to further refine the trust scoring algorithm, enabling the system to identify and adapt to previously unknown attack patterns.
