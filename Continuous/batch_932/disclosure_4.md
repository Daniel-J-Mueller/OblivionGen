## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Preview Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond scene/user preference based previews to generate previews dynamically tailored to a user’s *current* emotional state, inferred in real-time.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional State Inference Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time video feed of user (camera), audio input (microphone). Optional: Biometric data (heart rate variability, skin conductance - via wearable integration).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Facial expression analysis (using computer vision models – e.g., pre-trained CNNs for emotion recognition).
    *   Voice tone/prosody analysis (feature extraction – pitch, intensity, speech rate – coupled with emotion classification models).
    *   Biometric data correlation (if available - to refine emotion estimate).
    *   Output:  Emotion vector (e.g., representing valence/arousal/dominance, or discrete emotion probabilities – happiness, sadness, anger, fear, neutral).  Update rate: Minimum 10Hz.
*   **Hardware:** Edge TPU or equivalent for low-latency processing; dedicated camera/microphone input.

**2. Content Emotional Tagging Module:**

*   **Input:** Video content (frames/audio).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Scene analysis (object detection, action recognition, scene classification).
    *   Audio analysis (mood classification, musical key/tempo extraction).
    *   Emotion tagging: Assign emotion tags to segments of video (e.g., ‘joyful’, ‘suspenseful’, ‘melancholy’, ‘action-packed’) with associated confidence scores.  This requires a pre-trained model built on a large emotional-annotated video dataset.
    *   Output: Time-stamped emotion profile of video content.

**3. Preview Generation Engine:**

*   **Input:** User’s current emotional state (from Module 1), Video Content’s Emotional Profile (Module 2), User Preference data.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Emotional Alignment Score:** Calculate a score representing the alignment between user’s current emotion and the emotional profile of each video segment.  The scoring function should incorporate user preferences (e.g., some users may prefer content that *contrasts* their mood).
    *   **Preview Segment Selection:** Select video segments maximizing the Emotional Alignment Score, while adhering to constraints (preview length, desired scene diversity, story arc coherence). Use a dynamic programming approach to find the optimal segment combination.
    *   **Dynamic Editing:** Adjust segment transitions, music, and visual effects to enhance the emotional resonance of the preview.
    *   **Output:** Dynamically generated video preview tailored to user’s current emotional state.

**Pseudocode (Preview Generation Engine):**

```
function generate_preview(user_emotion, video_emotion_profile, user_preferences, preview_length):
  segments = []
  current_time = 0
  while current_time < video_length and len(segments) < max_segments:
    best_segment = null
    best_score = -infinity
    for segment in video_emotion_profile:
      if segment.start_time >= current_time:
        score = calculate_emotional_alignment_score(user_emotion, segment.emotion_tags) + user_preference_bonus(segment, user_preferences)
        if score > best_score:
          best_score = score
          best_segment = segment
    if best_segment != null:
      segments.append(best_segment)
      current_time = best_segment.end_time
    else:
      break # No suitable segment found

  # Dynamic Editing (adjust transitions, music, effects)

  return render_preview(segments)
```

**Hardware:** Dedicated GPU for rendering; high-bandwidth memory for rapid access to video data.

**Potential Applications:** Personalized advertising, emotionally intelligent content recommendation, adaptive entertainment experiences.
