## Dynamic Memory Partitioning via Reinforcement Learning

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to dynamically partition unified memory based on real-time neural network execution patterns.  Instead of pre-allocation or static partitioning, the RL agent observes memory access patterns and adjusts partition sizes for the neural network inference circuit, input processing circuit, and microprocessor circuit *during* execution.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Unified Memory Controller (UMC):**  Modified UMC capable of adjusting partition boundaries on the fly, based on signals from the RL Agent.  This requires a hardware abstraction layer.
*   **Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU):** Embedded PMU within the integrated circuit to collect real-time data on memory access patterns – read/write frequencies, bandwidth utilization, latency for each circuit (NN inference, input processing, microprocessor).
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  A dedicated hardware module or a software agent running on the microprocessor circuit.  The RL agent is trained (offline or online) to maximize overall system performance (throughput, latency, energy efficiency).
*   **State Space:**  The state space for the RL agent comprises the PMU data (memory access patterns for each circuit), current partition sizes, and potentially information about the input data (e.g., image complexity, audio characteristics).
*   **Action Space:** The action space consists of discrete adjustments to the partition sizes.  For example, the agent can increase or decrease the size of the NN inference circuit partition by a fixed percentage.  The granularity of these adjustments is a tunable parameter.
*   **Reward Function:**  The reward function is critical. It needs to balance competing objectives. A possible reward function: `Reward = Throughput – LatencyPenalty – EnergyPenalty`.  The penalties are weighted to reflect the desired trade-offs.
*   **Training Methodology:** The RL agent can be trained using various techniques (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks). Simulation is essential for initial training. Online learning can further fine-tune the agent's performance in specific deployment scenarios.

**III. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:**  The UMC is initialized with a default memory partition configuration.
2.  **Monitoring:** The PMU continuously monitors memory access patterns for each circuit.
3.  **State Observation:** The RL Agent observes the current state based on the PMU data.
4.  **Action Selection:** The RL Agent selects an action (adjust partition sizes) based on its current policy.
5.  **Partition Adjustment:** The UMC adjusts the memory partition boundaries according to the agent's action.
6.  **Reward Calculation:** The system calculates the reward based on the resulting performance metrics.
7.  **Policy Update:** The RL Agent updates its policy based on the reward.
8.  **Repeat Steps 3-7 continuously.**

**IV. Pseudocode (RL Agent):**

```python
# Initialize RL Agent (e.g., Q-Table or Neural Network)

while True:
  state = observe_state(PMU_data)
  action = select_action(state, RL_Agent)
  adjust_memory_partitions(action)
  reward = calculate_reward(performance_metrics)
  update_RL_Agent(reward, state, action)
```

**V. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Hierarchical RL:**  Use a hierarchical RL approach to decompose the partitioning problem into sub-problems.
*   **Multi-Agent RL:**  Employ multiple RL agents, each responsible for partitioning a specific memory bank.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**  Integrate a predictive model to anticipate future memory access patterns and proactively adjust partitions.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:**  Implement the RL agent in dedicated hardware to accelerate the learning and decision-making process.
