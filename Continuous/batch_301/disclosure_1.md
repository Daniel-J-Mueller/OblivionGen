## Dynamic Mood-Based Media Segmentation & Playback

**Concept:** Extend the time-synced text display concept to dynamically segment media (audio/video) based on detected emotional cues *within* the media itself, and allow the user to navigate and replay these segments. This goes beyond lyrics or subtitles – it aims to create a user experience centered around emotional impact.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Streaming audio/video data.
*   **Process:** Employ a real-time emotion detection AI (pre-trained model or custom-built). Detect primary emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral) with confidence scores.  This analysis happens *concurrently* with media playback.
*   **Output:** A time-series data stream of emotional states, with timestamps.  Format: `[timestamp, emotion, confidence]`.  Example: `[00:01.5, Joy, 0.85]`, `[00:02.2, Sadness, 0.6]`.

**2. Dynamic Segmentation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Emotional data stream.  User-defined sensitivity thresholds for each emotion (adjustable in settings).  Minimum segment duration (user adjustable).
*   **Process:**  Identify emotional 'peaks' – sustained periods of high confidence for a specific emotion exceeding the sensitivity threshold.  Create segments defined by the start and end times of these peaks.  Enforce minimum segment duration to avoid overly granular segmentation.
*   **Output:** A list of media segments, each defined by: `[start_time, end_time, emotion, peak_confidence]`.

**3. Visual Interface (Timeline & Emotional Waveform):**

*   **Timeline:** Standard media playback timeline.
*   **Emotional Waveform:** Display a visual representation of the emotional analysis *above* the timeline.  Each emotion is represented by a different color.  The height of the waveform indicates the peak confidence for that emotion at a given time.
*   **Segment Highlighting:**  Highlight detected segments on both the timeline and the emotional waveform.  Color-code segments based on the dominant emotion.
*   **Segment List:** Display a scrollable list of segments with segment start/end times, dominant emotion, and a short representative frame (for video) or waveform snippet (for audio).

**4. Navigation & Playback Controls:**

*   **Segment Selection:** User can select a segment from the segment list or by clicking on the highlighted segment on the timeline/waveform.
*   **Segment Looping:** Option to loop a selected segment continuously.
*   **Emotional Filtering:** User can filter the segment list to display only segments associated with specific emotions (e.g., "Show me all the joyful moments").
*   **Emotional 'Mix' Playback:**  Select multiple emotions and the system will create a playlist of segments that evoke those emotions.
*   **'Emotional Jump'**:  A button which will play a random segment associated with a user-selected emotion.
*   **Intensity Slider**:  An input to manipulate the segmentation thresholds, providing finer control over the creation of segments.

**Pseudocode (Segmentation Engine):**

```
function createSegments(emotionalData, sensitivityThresholds, minDuration):
  segments = []
  currentSegmentStart = null
  currentEmotion = null
  currentConfidence = 0

  for each dataPoint in emotionalData:
    timestamp = dataPoint.timestamp
    emotion = dataPoint.emotion
    confidence = dataPoint.confidence

    if confidence > sensitivityThresholds[emotion]:
      if currentSegmentStart == null:
        currentSegmentStart = timestamp
        currentEmotion = emotion

      currentConfidence = confidence

    else:
      if currentSegmentStart != null:
        segmentDuration = timestamp - currentSegmentStart
        if segmentDuration >= minDuration:
          segments.append([currentSegmentStart, timestamp, currentEmotion, currentConfidence])
        currentSegmentStart = null
        currentEmotion = null

  return segments
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Integration with online music/video services to automatically analyze content.
*   User profiles to store emotion preferences and sensitivity settings.
*   Ability to manually add/edit segments.
*   Exploration of different emotion detection algorithms for optimal accuracy.
*   A 'share' feature which would send a segment of the media, accompanied by a descriptive emotional label.
