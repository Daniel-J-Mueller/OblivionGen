## Dynamic Request Shaping with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *reacting* to load with prioritization. Proactively *shape* incoming requests based on predicted service capacity and client-defined value metrics, moving beyond droppability and deadlines to influence request *complexity* itself.

**Specifications:**

**1. Request Profile Definition:**

*   **Complexity Score:** Introduce a "Complexity Score" field in incoming requests.  Clients specify (within defined limits) how computationally expensive or resource intensive a request may be. Lower scores indicate simpler requests.  This is *in addition* to droppability and deadlines.
*   **Value Metric:** Allow clients to assign a "Value Metric" (e.g., revenue impact, user satisfaction, critical path dependency) to each request.  This isn’t a hard requirement, but incentivizes clients to provide data for better load balancing.
*   **Negotiation Protocol:** Implement a lightweight negotiation protocol. If a client submits a request with a high Complexity Score during a predicted overload, the service can *request* the client reduce the score (e.g., by submitting a simplified version of the request, omitting optional features).
*   **Client-Side Adaptation Library:** Provide a client-side library to facilitate request simplification and adaptation based on service feedback.

**2. Predictive Load Balancing Engine:**

*   **Time Series Analysis:**  Utilize historical load data to build a time-series model for predicting future service capacity.
*   **Capacity Forecasting:** Forecast service capacity at various granularities (e.g., per minute, per hour).
*   **Request Shaping Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that dynamically adjusts request acceptance and complexity based on predicted capacity, request Value Metrics, Complexity Scores, deadlines, and droppability.  Algorithm key steps:
    *   **Capacity Buffer:** Maintain a ‘Capacity Buffer’ reflecting remaining capacity.
    *   **Acceptance Threshold:**  Establish an ‘Acceptance Threshold’ based on the Capacity Buffer and predicted load.
    *   **Request Evaluation:** For each incoming request:
        *   Calculate a ‘Priority Score’ based on Value Metric, Deadline, Droppability, and Complexity Score.
        *   If Priority Score exceeds the Acceptance Threshold, accept the request at the specified Complexity Score.
        *   If Priority Score is below the Acceptance Threshold:
            *   Initiate Negotiation Protocol.
            *   Request client reduce Complexity Score.
            *   If client agrees, accept the request at the reduced Complexity Score.
            *   If client declines, drop the request (if droppable) or reject it (if deadline cannot be met).

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Load Balancing Proxy:** Deploy a Load Balancing Proxy in front of the service. The proxy handles request acceptance, complexity negotiation, and forwarding to the service.
*   **Prediction Service:** Implement a dedicated Prediction Service responsible for forecasting service capacity.
*   **API Integration:** Expose APIs for clients to submit requests with Complexity Scores and Value Metrics.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement robust monitoring and alerting to track prediction accuracy, negotiation rates, and system performance.

**Pseudocode (Load Balancing Proxy – Request Handling):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  priorityScore = calculatePriorityScore(request)
  if (predictedCapacity > currentLoad):
    acceptRequest(request)
  else:
    if (priorityScore > acceptanceThreshold):
      acceptRequest(request)
    else:
      complexityReductionSuccessful = requestNegotiation(request)
      if (complexityReductionSuccessful):
        acceptRequest(request)
      else:
        if (request.droppable):
          dropRequest(request)
        else:
          rejectRequest(request)
```

This system shifts from simply *handling* overload to *preventing* it through proactive shaping of demand, allowing services to offer more predictable performance and maximize overall value.
