## Adaptive Data Sharding & Predictive Pre-Aggregation

**Concept:** Extend the zero-setup querying by introducing dynamic data sharding based on query patterns and *predictive* pre-aggregation. The system anticipates common pivot queries and proactively pre-aggregates data slices *before* the query is even received. This moves beyond simply querying un-aggregated data to actively preparing for likely queries, minimizing latency and resource consumption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Query Pattern Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Stream of incoming pivot queries (metadata: metric types, dimensions, time ranges).
*   **Process:**
    *   Real-time frequency analysis of metric/dimension combinations.
    *   Identification of recurring query 'signatures'.
    *   Time-series analysis to detect seasonality and predict future query patterns.
    *   Utilize a sliding window to capture short-term trends.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted pivot queries, associated confidence scores, and recommended pre-aggregation strategies.

**2. Adaptive Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted pivot queries (from Query Pattern Analysis), raw monitoring data stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   Dynamically partitions data based on frequently queried dimensions.
    *   Shards are distributed across storage nodes for parallel access.
    *   Sharding strategy adjusts in real-time based on predicted query patterns.
    *   Utilize consistent hashing to minimize data movement during re-sharding.
*   **Output:** Sharded monitoring data stored across distributed storage.

**3. Predictive Pre-Aggregation Service:**

*   **Input:** Predicted pivot queries, sharded monitoring data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Proactively pre-aggregates data slices corresponding to predicted queries.
    *   Stores pre-aggregated results in a dedicated cache tier (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
    *   Utilizes a multi-level cache:
        *   L1: In-memory cache for frequently accessed aggregations.
        *   L2: Disk-based cache for less frequent aggregations.
    *   Employs a 'time-to-live' (TTL) mechanism for pre-aggregated results based on data staleness and query prediction confidence.
*   **Output:** Pre-aggregated results stored in a cache.

**4. Optimized Query Execution Engine:**

*   **Input:** Pivot query, pre-aggregated cache, sharded monitoring data.
*   **Process:**
    *   First, check if pre-aggregated results exist for the query.
    *   If results are found in the cache, return them immediately.
    *   If results are not found, execute the query against the sharded data.
    *   During query execution, update the pre-aggregation cache with the newly computed results.
*   **Output:** Query results.

**Pseudocode (Query Execution Engine):**

```
function executePivotQuery(query):
  cachedResults = getPreAggregatedResults(query)
  if cachedResults != null:
    return cachedResults
  else:
    results = executeQueryAgainstShards(query)
    storePreAggregatedResults(query, results)
    return results
```

**Data Format:**

*   Raw Monitoring Data: List of key-value pairs (as described in the patent).
*   Pre-Aggregated Results: Data structures optimized for the specific aggregation type (e.g., sums, averages, counts).

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   Sharding enables horizontal scalability.
*   Replication ensures data resilience.
*   Caching reduces load on storage systems.
