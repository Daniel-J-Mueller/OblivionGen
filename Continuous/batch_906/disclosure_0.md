## Adaptive Persona-Driven Sign-On

**Core Concept:** Expand customizable sign-on beyond service-specific branding and data gathering. Implement a system that dynamically constructs 'digital personas' for users *during* the sign-on process, leveraging inferred data and explicit preferences to tailor not only the authentication method but also the initial user experience *within* the connected service.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Construction Module:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   **Implicit Data:** IP address geolocation, device type, browser fingerprint, time of day, referring website (if applicable).
    *   **Explicit Data (Progressive Disclosure):** Initial optional questions presented *during* sign-on. Examples: "Are you a student?", "Are you interested in discounts?", "What is your primary use case for this service?". Questions are dynamically selected based on implicit data.
    *   **Federated Identity Data (Optional):**  If using social sign-on, ingest available data fields (age range, interests) with user consent.
    *   **Historical Interaction Data (Existing Users):**  Past behavior within connected services (purchase history, content consumed, features used).
*   **Persona Types:**  Predefined persona archetypes (e.g., "Student," "Professional," "Casual User," "Privacy-Focused").  The system assigns probabilities to each archetype based on data inputs.  A blended persona can be created.
*   **Persona Output:**  A JSON object containing archetype probabilities, inferred preferences (e.g., "likely interested in sustainability," "prefers mobile access"), and security risk score.

**2. Adaptive Authentication Module:**

*   **Authentication Method Selection:** Based on the Persona Output, select the most appropriate authentication method:
    *   **Low Risk/Casual User:**  Passwordless authentication via email/SMS, social sign-on.
    *   **Medium Risk/Professional:** Multi-factor authentication (MFA) with preferred method based on device (push notification to trusted device, authenticator app).
    *   **High Risk/Privacy-Focused:**  Biometric authentication with explicit consent, hardware security key.
*   **Dynamic Challenge Presentation:**  Challenges are tailored to the persona. For example, a "Student" persona might be presented with a challenge question about their university.
*   **Transparent Authentication:**  Display a brief explanation of *why* a particular authentication method was chosen.  ("Based on your preferences, we're using biometric authentication for enhanced security.")

**3.  Personalized Onboarding Module:**

*   **Dynamic Content Presentation:** The initial view *after* successful sign-on is customized based on the Persona Output.
    *   **Student:** Highlight student discounts, relevant learning resources.
    *   **Professional:** Showcase productivity tools, industry-specific content.
    *   **Privacy-Focused:**  Emphasize data privacy settings, opt-out options.
*   **Personalized Tutorial:** A brief, interactive tutorial tailored to the userâ€™s inferred needs and goals.
*   **Preference Center Integration:**  Direct link to a preference center where users can refine their persona and control data sharing.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Authentication Module):**

```
function selectAuthenticationMethod(persona) {
  riskScore = persona.riskScore;

  if (riskScore <= 3) {
    return "passwordless";
  } else if (riskScore > 3 && riskScore <= 7) {
    preferredMFA = persona.preferredMFA; // From user settings or defaults
    if (preferredMFA == "push") {
      return "mfa_push";
    } else {
      return "mfa_authenticator";
    }
  } else {
    return "biometric"; // Require biometric with clear consent
  }
}

function presentChallenge(persona, challengeType) {
  // ... challenge logic based on persona and type ...
}
```

**System Architecture:**

*   **Persona Service:** Central service responsible for persona construction and management.
*   **Authentication Service:** Handles authentication logic and integrates with Persona Service.
*   **Onboarding Service:**  Delivers personalized onboarding experience.
*   **API Integration:**  Connected services integrate with these services via APIs.
