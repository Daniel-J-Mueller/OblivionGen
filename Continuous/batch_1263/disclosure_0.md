## Dynamic Usage Model Composition & AI-Driven Negotiation

**Concept:** Expand the existing usage model framework to allow for *dynamic* composition of models during runtime, driven by an AI negotiation engine interacting with both the service provider and the consumer. This moves beyond pre-defined models to a fluid system adapting to real-time conditions and individual user needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component: Real-time Condition Monitor (RCM)**

*   **Function:** Monitors external and internal conditions impacting service delivery and/or consumer needs.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Service Provider Data: System load, resource availability, current pricing tiers, maintenance schedules.
    *   Consumer Data: Location, device type, network bandwidth, historical usage patterns, stated preferences (e.g., prioritizing speed vs. cost).
    *   External Data: Time of day, day of week, regional events (e.g., sporting events impacting bandwidth), competitor pricing.
*   **Output:** Weighted condition vectors representing the current state of the service and the consumer.

**2. Component: Usage Model Building Block Library (UMB)**

*   **Function:** Repository of granular usage model components (“blocks”). These aren’t complete models, but individual constraints and price points.
*   **Block Types:**
    *   *Price Blocks:*  Fixed price, variable price (based on usage, time, etc.), tiered pricing, subscription options.
    *   *Restriction Blocks:* Geographic restrictions, time-of-day restrictions, device restrictions, bandwidth limits, feature limitations.
    *   *Quality Blocks:*  Guaranteed latency, throughput, error rate, feature access.
*   **Data Structure:** Each block contains:
    *   Block Type.
    *   Parameter Range (e.g., price range, latency range).
    *   Weighting Factor (initial preference).

**3. Component: AI Negotiation Engine (ANE)**

*   **Function:**  Orchestrates the composition of a customized usage model by negotiating with both the service provider and the consumer.
*   **Algorithm:**  Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reward function optimized for mutual benefit and service sustainability.
*   **Negotiation Steps:**
    1.  **Initialization:**  ANE receives the weighted condition vectors from RCM and a set of candidate blocks from UMB.
    2.  **Proposal Generation:** ANE generates multiple usage model proposals by combining blocks, adjusting parameters, and applying weighting factors.
    3.  **Provider Evaluation:** Proposals are sent to the service provider, who evaluates them based on resource availability and profitability. Provider returns a 'viability score'.
    4.  **Consumer Evaluation:** Proposals are presented to the consumer (through a user interface) with clear explanations of trade-offs (e.g., cost vs. speed). Consumer provides a 'preference score'.
    5.  **Reward Calculation:** A reward function combines the viability score, preference score, and long-term service sustainability metrics.
    6.  **RL Update:** The RL agent updates its policy based on the reward, learning which block combinations are most effective in different scenarios.
    7.  **Iteration:** Steps 3-6 are repeated until a mutually acceptable model is found or a maximum iteration count is reached.

**4. Component: Dynamic Usage Model Executor (DUME)**

*   **Function:** Enforces the negotiated usage model in real-time.
*   **Features:**
    *   Access Control: Enforces restrictions based on the model.
    *   Rate Limiting: Controls usage based on bandwidth limits.
    *   Quality of Service (QoS) Management: Prioritizes traffic based on QoS parameters.
    *   Billing Integration: Tracks usage and applies charges according to the model.

**Pseudocode (ANE – Proposal Generation):**

```
function generate_proposal(condition_vectors, block_library):
  proposal = {}
  // Select initial blocks based on condition vectors (e.g., high bandwidth need -> bandwidth block)
  selected_blocks = select_initial_blocks(condition_vectors, block_library)

  //Iterate through blocks and refine parameters
  for block in selected_blocks:
    refined_parameter = refine_parameter(block.parameter_range, condition_vectors)
    proposal[block.block_type] = refined_parameter

  return proposal
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond static usage models to a dynamic, negotiated arrangement. The AI acts as an intermediary, maximizing value for both the consumer and the provider, leading to a more efficient and sustainable service ecosystem. It’s a shift from *offering* models to *building* them collaboratively.
