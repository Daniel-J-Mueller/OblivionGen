## Dynamic Taxonomy Construction via User Interaction & Generative Models

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *matching* search queries to a *predefined* taxonomy. This system proposes a dynamic taxonomy construction process, adapting and evolving the taxonomy *based on user interaction* and leveraging generative models to propose new taxonomy nodes. This goes beyond simply categorizing existing items; it aims to *discover* emerging trends and refine the categorization itself.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & User Interaction Module:**

*   **Implicit Feedback:** Track user search behavior (queries, click-through rates, dwell time on results), purchase history, and browsing patterns.
*   **Explicit Feedback:** Implement a “Suggest a Category” feature where users can propose new taxonomy nodes or suggest refinements to existing ones.  Allow users to ‘vote’ on suggestions.
*   **Session-Based Data:** Capture the complete user session – not just the final purchase – to understand the user’s ‘journey’ and contextualize their interests.
*   **Query Expansion:** Employ techniques like query relaxation (removing keywords) and query generalization (using synonyms/hypernyms) to identify broader themes within a user's search.

**2. Generative Taxonomy Node Proposal Engine:**

*   **Model:** Utilize a large language model (LLM) – specifically a generative model like a Transformer – pre-trained on a massive corpus of text data (e.g., Wikipedia, product descriptions, news articles).
*   **Input:** Feed the LLM a combination of:
    *   Recent user search queries (aggregated and anonymized).
    *   Emerging keywords identified from search trends.
    *   The current taxonomy structure (as context).
*   **Output:** The LLM generates candidate taxonomy node labels (text strings) and potentially hierarchical relationships between them.  The model should also output a 'confidence score' indicating the likelihood that the proposed node represents a genuine, meaningful category.
*   **Diversity Encouragement:**  Implement mechanisms to promote diversity in the generated proposals. This could involve techniques like nucleus sampling or penalty terms that discourage the model from generating highly similar nodes.

**3. Taxonomy Evaluation & Integration Module:**

*   **Automated Scoring:**  Evaluate the candidate taxonomy nodes based on several criteria:
    *   **Semantic Coherence:**  How well the node label aligns with the concepts represented by the associated search queries/items. (Use semantic similarity metrics like cosine similarity between text embeddings).
    *   **Distinctiveness:**  How unique the proposed node is compared to existing nodes. (Measure the distance between text embeddings).
    *   **Potential Reach:**  Estimate the number of existing items/search queries that could be mapped to the new node.
*   **Human-in-the-Loop Validation:**  Present a subset of the highest-scoring candidate nodes to human evaluators for review and validation.
*   **Dynamic Integration:**  If a node is validated, automatically integrate it into the taxonomy. The system should also suggest potential parent-child relationships based on semantic similarity.
*   **A/B Testing:** When integrating new nodes, perform A/B testing to compare the performance of the updated taxonomy against the previous version (e.g., measure click-through rates, conversion rates).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Integration Flow):**

```
FUNCTION integrateNewNode(candidateNode, validationStatus):
  IF validationStatus == "VALIDATED":
    // Calculate semantic similarity to existing nodes
    similarityScores = calculateSemanticSimilarity(candidateNode, existingNodes)

    // Identify potential parent node (highest similarity score)
    parent = findParentNode(similarityScores)

    // Update taxonomy structure
    addNode(parent, candidateNode)

    // Re-index items based on new node
    reIndexItems(candidateNode)

    // A/B test new taxonomy
    startABTest()
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond static taxonomy management. The iterative process of learning from user behavior, generating new categories with AI, and dynamically updating the taxonomy offers a significant advancement in search and recommendation personalization. This creates a 'living' taxonomy that evolves with user needs and emerging trends, rather than being a fixed structure. The A/B testing and automated scoring close the feedback loop allowing for continuous improvement.
