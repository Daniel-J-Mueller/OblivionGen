## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Layer

**Concept:** Extend the synchronization of supplemental data to *emotional* data derived from live audience feedback or AI analysis of the live event itself. Instead of just facts or graphics, inject subtle sensory cues (haptic, visual, audio) timed to amplify emotional impact.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Live audio stream (as per existing patent).
    *   Real-time audience sentiment analysis: Polling data (app-based responses), social media feeds (keyword/emotion detection), or AI analysis of live video/audio (facial expression/tone detection). Output: Emotional "intensity" score (0-100) per emotion (joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.).
    *   AI Event Segmentation: Automated identification of key emotional beats/turning points within the live event (e.g., dramatic reveals, musical climaxes). Output: Timestamped event tags (e.g., "Dramatic Reveal – 2:37:12," "Musical Climax – 3:15:05").
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Emotional Mapping:** Create a lookup table mapping event tags and emotional intensity scores to specific sensory cues.
        *   *Haptic:* Vibration patterns (intensity, duration, frequency) for wearable devices (smartwatches, haptic vests).
        *   *Visual:* Subtle color shifts in ambient lighting (smart bulbs), screen flashes (low intensity), or augmented reality overlays.
        *   *Audio:*  Spatial audio effects, dynamic equalization (boosting frequencies related to emotion – e.g., low frequencies for tension, high frequencies for excitement), or subtle soundscapes.
    2.  **Synchronization Engine:** Modified existing synchronization engine to handle emotional data alongside existing supplemental data.  The engine prioritizes emotional cues based on intensity and relevance to the current play time.
    3.  **Personalization Layer:**  User profiles to store preferences for sensory cue intensity and types.  Algorithm to learn user emotional responses over time and adapt cue selection accordingly.
*   **Output:**
    *   Synchronized sensory cues delivered through connected devices (wearables, smart lighting, audio systems).
    *   Real-time visualization of emotional data (optional – for debugging/analysis).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - runs while audio is playing
while (audioPlaying) {
  currentTime = getAudioCurrentTime()
  
  // Check for Supplemental Data (existing functionality)
  processSupplementalData(currentTime)
  
  //Check for Emotional Data
  emotionalData = getEmotionalData(currentTime)
  
  if (emotionalData != null) {
    emotionType = emotionalData.emotionType
    emotionIntensity = emotionalData.intensity
    
    //Get Personalized Cue
    cue = getPersonalizedCue(emotionType, emotionIntensity)
    
    //Apply Cue
    applyCue(cue)
  }
}

//Function: getPersonalizedCue(emotionType, emotionIntensity)
//  Looks up cue based on user preferences and intensity.
//  Example: If user prefers subtle cues and intensity is low,
//  returns a low-intensity haptic vibration.
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Live concerts/performances.
*   Sporting events.
*   Immersive storytelling experiences (VR/AR).
*   Therapeutic applications (emotional regulation).
