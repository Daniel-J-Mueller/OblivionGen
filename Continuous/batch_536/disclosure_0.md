## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Prioritization

**Concept:** Implement dynamic, spatially-aware acoustic zones within the deviceâ€™s listening field, coupled with a prioritization system for wakeword detection based on user activity and learned preferences. This moves beyond simply suppressing secondary wakeword detections; it actively *shapes* the listening environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+), spatially distributed on device housing.
    *   Real-time signal processing unit (DSP) capable of beamforming and source localization.
    *   Optional: Miniature accelerometers to detect device orientation/movement.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Acoustic Zone Mapping:** Algorithm to create a 3D map of the acoustic environment. The map dynamically adjusts based on microphone input, identifying sound sources and creating zones of varying sensitivity.  Zones are defined by spatial coordinates and sensitivity levels.
    *   **Source Localization:** Real-time algorithm to pinpoint the origin of sounds within the listening range.  Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and beamforming techniques.
    *   **Dynamic Sensitivity Adjustment:** Each acoustic zone's sensitivity to wakewords is adjusted based on:
        *   **User Activity:**  Detect user actions (e.g., watching video, phone call) via device sensors (accelerometer, screen state, bluetooth connections). Adjust zone sensitivity to prioritize the primary audio source and suppress wakeword detection from secondary sources.
        *   **Learned Preferences:**  Machine learning model to learn user preferences based on past interactions.  For example, if the user frequently interacts with a specific device (e.g., smart TV) when watching videos, prioritize audio from that device and suppress wakewords from other sources during video playback.
        *   **Proximity Detection:** Identify zones with near field audio signals. These signals are more likely to be direct requests, and can be prioritized.
    *   **Wakeword Prioritization Engine:**  A multi-stage filtering and prioritization system for wakeword detections.
        *   **Stage 1: Zone-Based Filtering:**  Wakeword detections originating from low-priority zones are initially suppressed.
        *   **Stage 2: Confidence Scoring:**  Each detection is assigned a confidence score based on audio quality, source localization accuracy, and user activity context.
        *   **Stage 3: Conflict Resolution:** If multiple wakewords are detected simultaneously, the system selects the highest-confidence detection, taking into account user preferences and current context.
    *   **User Interface:** Allows users to:
        *   Visualize acoustic zones and sensitivity levels.
        *   Manually adjust zone settings.
        *   Provide feedback on wakeword detection accuracy.
        *   "Teach" the system preferred audio sources for specific activities.

**Pseudocode (Wakeword Prioritization Engine):**

```
function prioritizeWakewords(detections, userContext, acousticMap):
  filteredDetections = []
  for detection in detections:
    if acousticMap.getZoneSensitivity(detection.sourceLocation) > threshold:
      filteredDetections.append(detection)

  scoredDetections = []
  for detection in filteredDetections:
    score = calculateConfidenceScore(detection, userContext)
    scoredDetections.append((detection, score))

  sortedDetections = sorted(scoredDetections, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  if len(sortedDetections) > 0:
    bestDetection = sortedDetections[0][0]
    return bestDetection
  else:
    return null
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems primarily focus on *suppressing* unintended wakeword detections. This approach actively *shapes* the listening environment, creating dynamic acoustic zones that prioritize desired audio sources and suppress unwanted noise, leading to a more robust and user-friendly voice control experience. It moves beyond simple suppression to intelligent audio management.
