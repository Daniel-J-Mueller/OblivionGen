## Contextual Audio Layering for Immersive Experiences

**Concept:** Expand the system's awareness of context beyond simple device display content, user voiceprint, location, or historical data. Introduce the capability to *layer* ambient audio based on a dynamic, multi-faceted contextual analysis. This isn't merely responding to a command, but building an aural environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Integrate data from multiple sources:
    *   Device display content (text, images, video).
    *   Microphone input (beyond speech - ambient sounds).
    *   Location data (GPS, WiFi triangulation).
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope (device motion/orientation).
    *   Connected Smart Home Data (temperature, lighting, device status).
    *   Calendar/Appointment Data (upcoming events).
*   **Contextual Analysis Engine:** AI model trained to interpret sensor data and determine a "contextual profile." This profile goes beyond intent; it defines the *environment* the user is in. Examples:
    *   "Working from home, focused task, quiet environment."
    *   "Commuting on public transport, noisy, potentially distracted."
    *   "Relaxing at home, evening, low lighting."
    *   "Cooking in the kitchen, moderate noise, potentially multi-tasking."
*   **Ambient Audio Library:**  A large, categorized library of ambient sounds (nature sounds, cityscapes, cafe ambience, instrumental music, white noise, etc.). Audio files should be modular (loopable, mixable).
*   **Dynamic Audio Mixing Algorithm:** Based on the contextual profile, this algorithm selects and mixes ambient sounds from the library to create a layered audio experience.
    *   Volume levels for each layer are dynamically adjusted based on the perceived level of noise in the microphone input.
    *   Audio layers are transitioned smoothly based on changes in the contextual profile (e.g., moving from "commuting" to "arrived at office").
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to:
    *   Create and save custom contextual profiles.
    *   Select preferred audio layers for each profile.
    *   Adjust the overall volume of ambient audio.
    *   Enable/disable the feature entirely.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

While (Device is ON) {
    SensorData = GetSensorData() // Collect data from all sensors
    ContextProfile = AnalyzeContext(SensorData) // AI model analyzes data
    AmbientAudioMix = GenerateAudioMix(ContextProfile) // Selects/Mixes audio
    OutputAudio(AmbientAudioMix) // Plays layered audio

    If (UserCommand Received) {
        ProcessCommand(UserCommand) // Regular speech recognition processing
    }
}

// GenerateAudioMix Function
Function GenerateAudioMix(ContextProfile) {
    BaseLayer = SelectBaseLayer(ContextProfile.Environment) // e.g., "Cafe Ambience"
    DetailLayer = SelectDetailLayer(ContextProfile.Activity) // e.g., "Gentle Rain"
    NoiseCompensationLevel = CalculateNoiseCompensation(MicrophoneInput)

    MixedAudio = Mix(BaseLayer, DetailLayer, NoiseCompensationLevel)
    Return MixedAudio
}
```

**Novelty:**  This expands beyond simple speech response to *proactive* environmental augmentation. It's not just what the system *says*, but what it *adds* to the user's surroundings, enhancing immersion and providing a more personalized experience. The combination of multi-sensor data and dynamic audio mixing creates a truly adaptive and immersive environment.
