## Dynamic AR Social Sculpting

**Concept:** Extend the AR environment beyond simple content presentation to allow users to *collaboratively* construct and modify virtual objects within the real world, persisting across sessions. Think shared digital LEGOs, but built into the physical space and viewable by authorized users.

**Specs:**

*   **Core System:**  Augmented Reality System (as per provided patent) + Persistent AR Object Server + User Authentication/Authorization System
*   **Hardware Requirements:** AR Headset/Glasses with SLAM capabilities, robust network connectivity.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **AR Client:** (Runs on AR Headset)
        *   Real-time object tracking and placement.
        *   User interface for object manipulation (grabbing, rotating, scaling, duplicating).  Multi-user input handling.
        *   Collaborative editing lock system (preventing object corruption during simultaneous edits).  Visual cues for active editors.
        *   Object creation toolkit – basic primitive shapes (cubes, spheres, cylinders) +  texture/material selection.
        *   Local caching of AR object data for offline viewing (limited functionality).
    *   **Persistent AR Object Server:**
        *   Stores 3D model data for all created objects.  Version control.
        *   Handles user authentication and authorization.  Object ownership & access permissions (public, friends-only, private).
        *   Manages object persistence – storing objects in relation to real-world coordinates (SLAM data).
        *   Facilitates real-time communication between AR clients (object updates, user actions).
    *   **Gesture Recognition Module:** Expanded from existing patent capabilities to include complex creation/modification gestures (e.g., “pinch and pull” to extrude a shape, “circular swipe” to create a hole).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  User logs into AR system.
    2.  AR Client scans the environment, building a spatial map.
    3.  User initiates object creation/modification mode.
    4.  User uses gestures to create or manipulate virtual objects.
    5.  AR Client sends object data to Persistent AR Object Server.
    6.  Server stores data, and broadcasts updates to authorized users in the same physical space.
    7.  Authorized users see the same persistent AR objects.
*   **Pseudocode (Object Creation - Simplified):**

```
function createObject(gestureData, objectType, textureID) {
    // Determine object parameters from gestureData (size, shape, initial position)
    objectSize = calculateSize(gestureData);
    objectPosition = calculatePosition(gestureData);

    // Create 3D model of objectType with specified size and texture
    newObject = create3DModel(objectType, objectSize, textureID);
    newObject.position = objectPosition;

    // Send object data to server
    sendObjectToServer(newObject);
}

function sendObjectToServer(objectData) {
    // Package object data
    packageData = createPackage(objectData);

    // Transmit package to server
    transmitPackage(serverAddress, packageData);
}

function receiveObjectFromServer(packageData){
    //Unpackage objectData
    unpackageData(packageData);

    //Render object
    renderObject(unpackageData);
}
```

*   **Expansion Possibilities:**
    *   Scripting language for defining object behavior (simple animations, interactions).
    *   Integration with external data sources (real-time weather data, stock prices).
    *   AR "building challenges" with shared spaces and collaborative goals.
    *   Monetization – selling virtual objects, textures, or scripting assets.
