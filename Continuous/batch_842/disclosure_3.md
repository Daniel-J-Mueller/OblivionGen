## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Adaptive Routing

**Concept:** Extend the federated messaging system with a dynamic trust scoring mechanism for both devices *and* security groups, coupled with adaptive routing based on these scores. This creates a system where message delivery isn’t simply permitted or denied, but *optimized* based on perceived risk and reliability.

**Specs:**

*   **Trust Score Components:**
    *   **Device Reputation:**  A score based on historical communication patterns (volume, frequency, successful deliveries), reported spam/abuse, and potentially, device security posture (if voluntarily shared – e.g., OS updates, anti-malware status).
    *   **Security Group Validation:** Each security group (representing an organization, domain, etc.) receives a score based on adherence to security best practices, known vulnerabilities, and reports of malicious activity originating from that group. Verification via external threat intelligence feeds.
    *   **Mutual Trust:** The trust score between *two* communicating entities (devices or groups) is *not* simply an average.  It’s calculated using a weighted formula that emphasizes reciprocity.  If Device A trusts Device B highly, but Device B doesn’t trust Device A, the overall communication score is lower.

*   **Adaptive Routing Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initial Route Calculation:** Standard routing based on network connectivity and permissions (as defined in the existing patent).
    2.  **Trust Score Integration:**  The calculated route is *modified* based on the combined trust scores of the communicating entities.
        *   **High Trust:**  Route prioritized for speed and reliability. May include preferential treatment on network infrastructure.
        *   **Medium Trust:**  Standard routing.
        *   **Low Trust:** 
            *   **Increased Scrutiny:** Message flagged for content analysis (spam detection, malware scanning).
            *   **Delayed Delivery:** Message queued for a short period to allow for further verification.
            *   **Alternate Routing:** If multiple routes exist, prioritize a route through more secure or trusted intermediaries (even if it’s slightly slower).
            *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the number of messages sent from a low-trust source within a specific timeframe.
    3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Trust scores are *continuously* updated based on real-time communication behavior.  Positive interactions increase scores, negative interactions decrease them.

*   **System Components:**
    *   **Trust Score Database:**  A dedicated database to store trust scores for devices and security groups.  Scalable and resilient.
    *   **Real-Time Analytics Engine:**  A system to analyze communication patterns and update trust scores in real-time.
    *   **Routing Policy Manager:**  A component to define and manage routing policies based on trust scores.
    *   **API Integration:** APIs to allow external applications to query trust scores and contribute data (e.g., threat intelligence feeds).

**Pseudocode (Routing Policy Manager):**

```
function calculate_route(source_device, destination_device, message) {

  // 1. Standard route calculation (existing patent functionality)
  base_route = calculate_standard_route(source_device, destination_device);

  // 2. Get trust scores
  source_trust = get_device_trust(source_device);
  destination_trust = get_device_trust(destination_device);
  source_group_trust = get_group_trust(source_device.group);
  destination_group_trust = get_group_trust(destination_device.group);

  // 3. Calculate combined trust score
  combined_trust = (source_trust + destination_trust + source_group_trust + destination_group_trust) / 4; // Example formula - needs tuning

  // 4. Apply routing policies based on trust score
  if (combined_trust > 0.8) {
    // High Trust - Prioritize speed & reliability
    route = prioritize_speed(base_route);
  } else if (combined_trust > 0.5) {
    // Medium Trust - Use standard route
    route = base_route;
  } else {
    // Low Trust - Increased scrutiny & alternate routing
    route = analyze_content(base_route, message);
    route = find_secure_route(route);
    route = rate_limit(route, source_device);
  }

  return route;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Reputation Propagation:** Allow trusted devices to vouch for other devices, influencing their trust scores.
*   **Decentralized Trust:** Explore using blockchain or distributed ledger technology to create a tamper-proof trust registry.
*   **User-Configurable Trust Levels:** Allow users to define their preferred trust levels and customize routing policies.
