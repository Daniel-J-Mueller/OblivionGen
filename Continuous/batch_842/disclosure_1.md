## Dynamic Domain Weighting via User Affect Recognition

**Concept:** Extend the multi-domain NLU system to incorporate real-time user affect recognition (e.g., sentiment, frustration, excitement) and dynamically adjust the weighting of NLU modules associated with different domains. This allows the system to prioritize domains aligned with the user’s emotional state, enhancing responsiveness and user experience.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Affect Recognition Module:**
    *   Input: Audio stream of user utterance (or potentially text-based input, though audio is preferred for richer affect data).
    *   Processing: Employ a pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., using spectrogram analysis and recurrent neural networks or transformers) to detect key emotional signals (valence, arousal, dominance, and specific emotions like anger, joy, sadness).
    *   Output: A vector representing the user’s affective state (e.g., \[valence: 0.7, arousal: 0.6, dominance: 0.4]).  Normalize values to a 0-1 scale.

2.  **Domain-Affect Mapping Table:**
    *   A configurable table defining the correlation between affective states and domain relevance. This allows customization based on application.
    *   Example:
        *   High Arousal/Positive Valence: Prioritize Music, Entertainment, Shopping
        *   Low Arousal/Negative Valence: Prioritize Support, Information, Task Completion
        *   High Arousal/Negative Valence: Prioritize Support, De-escalation
    *   Data Structure:  Key-Value pairs where the Key is a defined Affective State (e.g., “Happy,” “Frustrated,” “Neutral”), and the Value is a vector representing the weighting for each NLU module (domains).

3.  **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Affect vector from Affect Recognition Module, Domain-Affect Mapping Table, and baseline domain weights (default, equal weighting).
    *   Processing:
        1.  Determine the closest affective state in the Domain-Affect Mapping Table based on cosine similarity between the Affect vector and the pre-defined affect states.
        2.  Retrieve the corresponding domain weight vector.
        3.  Combine the retrieved weight vector with the baseline weights using a weighted average. The weighting factor controls the degree to which affect influences domain selection. (e.g. `final_weight = (0.7 * affect_weight) + (0.3 * baseline_weight)`).  This value is configurable.
        4.  Normalize the final weights to ensure they sum to 1.
    *   Output: A vector representing the dynamically adjusted weights for each NLU module (domain).

4.  **NLU Engine Integration:**
    *   Modify the NLU engine to accept the dynamic weights as input.
    *   During NLU processing, multiply the confidence score of each NLU result by the corresponding domain weight *before* result selection (Claim 1). This biases the system towards prioritizing domains aligned with the user’s emotional state.
    *   The sorting mechanism in Claim 5 should take the weighted scores into account.

5. **Hint Data Enhancement (Claims 6, 7, 8):**
    * Combine the hint data from previous interactions with the dynamically calculated domain weights.  The hint data can act as a further modifier to the weights, allowing for even more refined domain prioritization.
    * The weighting factor for the hint data versus the affect recognition data is configurable.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Affect Recognition Module
affect_vector = RecognizeAffect(audio_stream)

// Domain-Affect Mapping Table (Example)
domain_affect_table = {
    "Happy": [0.8, 0.1, 0.1, 0.0], // Prioritize Music/Entertainment
    "Frustrated": [0.1, 0.8, 0.1, 0.0], // Prioritize Support
    "Neutral": [0.3, 0.3, 0.3, 0.1]
}

// Dynamic Weighting Algorithm
closest_affect_state = FindClosestAffectState(affect_vector, domain_affect_table)
affect_weights = domain_affect_table[closest_affect_state]
baseline_weights = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25] // Default equal weighting
weighting_factor = 0.7
final_weights = [(weighting_factor * affect_weight) + ((1 - weighting_factor) * baseline_weight) for affect_weight, baseline_weight in zip(affect_weights, baseline_weights)]
final_weights = Normalize(final_weights)

// NLU Engine Integration
weighted_scores = [score * weight for score, weight in zip(nlu_scores, final_weights)]
selected_nlu_result = SelectResultBasedOnWeightedScores(weighted_scores)
