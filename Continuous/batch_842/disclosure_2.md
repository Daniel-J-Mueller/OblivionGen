## Dynamic Request Shaping with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical node processing by introducing *request shaping* based on predicted resource contention and dynamically altering the query plan *before* distribution. The existing system seems to react to load *after* initiating processing. This system aims to proactively adjust the request *itself* to minimize bottlenecks.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** *Request Shaper Module* – Integrated as a pre-processor to the existing job scheduler.
*   **Input:** Raw request (query, data payload), historical node performance data, current node capacity.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Request Analysis:**  Decompose the request into logical units/sub-queries. Identify dependencies between these units.
    2.  **Resource Prediction:** Utilize historical data and real-time node capacity to *predict* resource contention for each logical unit if processed directly.
    3.  **Request Transformation:**
        *   **Unit Prioritization:** Re-order the logical units based on predicted contention.  High contention units are processed *first*, leveraging potentially available resources.
        *   **Unit Decomposition/Aggregation:** Dynamically break down complex units into smaller, more manageable chunks, or aggregate simpler units to reduce communication overhead.
        *   **Data Filtering/Sampling:** If the request involves large datasets, apply intelligent filtering or sampling techniques to reduce the amount of data processed, while maintaining acceptable accuracy.
        *   **Approximation Algorithms:** Substitute computationally expensive operations with faster, approximate algorithms where appropriate. Accuracy loss is tracked and reported.
    4.  **Plan Generation:** Generate a modified query plan based on the transformed request and predicted resource availability. This plan dictates the hierarchical node processing structure.
*   **Output:** Modified query plan, transformed request (if applicable), predicted performance metrics.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function shapeRequest(request, historicalData, currentCapacity):
  units = decomposeRequest(request)
  contentionMap = predictContention(units, historicalData, currentCapacity)
  sortedUnits = sortUnitsByContention(units, contentionMap)
  transformedRequest = optimizeUnits(sortedUnits) //Decompose/Aggregate/Filter
  plan = generatePlan(transformedRequest, currentCapacity)
  return plan, transformedRequest
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ContentionMap`:  Key: Unit ID, Value: Predicted Contention Score (0-100)
*   `QueryPlan`:  Hierarchical tree structure representing the processing flow. Each node represents a task to be executed on a specific node set.

**Novelty:**

The existing patent focuses on dynamic node *allocation* during processing. This extends that concept by proactively *shaping* the request *before* processing begins, to minimize resource contention and improve overall performance. It’s not simply about *where* to process, but *what* to process and *how* to process it given predicted load. This anticipates bottlenecks instead of reacting to them.
