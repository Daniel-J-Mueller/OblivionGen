## Temporal Key Shards & Distributed Entropy

**Concept:** Extend the durability concept beyond a single key pair to a *sharded* key, distributed across multiple offline repositories with differing lifespans and entropy sources. Instead of a single key expiring, individual shards expire, requiring re-assembly from surviving shards. This enhances resilience against compromise or loss and allows for granular control over key access.

**Specs:**

*   **Key Sharding:** The initial cryptographic key is split into *n* shards using a secret sharing algorithm (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).  Each shard is independently encrypted.
*   **Repository Distribution:** Each shard is stored in a distinct offline repository. These repositories aren't necessarily homogeneous; they can use different storage media, security protocols, and geographic locations.
*   **Temporal Lifespans:** Each shard is assigned a unique durability duration.  These durations are staggered – some shards expire sooner than others. This introduces a rolling expiration window.  Durations are determined algorithmically based on a “risk profile” of the data being protected (e.g., sensitivity, access frequency).
*   **Entropy Sources:**  Each repository utilizes a *different* source of entropy for encryption and key management.  This mitigates the risk of a single entropy failure compromising all shards. Sources include hardware random number generators (HRNGs), atmospheric noise, or verifiable random functions (VRFs).
*   **Reassembly Protocol:** A secure reassembly protocol is required.  This protocol authenticates the requesting entity, verifies the validity of the surviving shards (using digital signatures or other cryptographic proofs), and reconstructs the original key *only* if a sufficient number of valid shards are present.
*   **Shard Metadata:** Metadata associated with each shard should include:
    *   Shard ID
    *   Encryption Algorithm
    *   Repository Location
    *   Durability Duration (start and end times)
    *   Entropy Source ID
    *   Digital Signature (signed with a root of trust)
*   **Failure Tolerance:**  The system must tolerate the loss or compromise of a certain number of shards.  The degree of tolerance is determined by the ‘n’ value in the secret sharing algorithm. A higher ‘n’ value increases resilience but also increases management overhead.
*   **Automated Rotation:** Shards are automatically rotated based on expiration dates. New shards are generated, encrypted with fresh entropy, and stored in their respective repositories.  Expired shards are securely erased.
*   **Access Control:** Granular access control policies are applied to each shard. Only authorized entities can request a shard for key reassembly.
*   **Auditing:** All shard access and rotation events are logged for auditing purposes.
*   **Pseudocode – Key Reassembly:**

```
function ReassembleKey(requestingEntity, identifier):
    // Authenticate requestingEntity
    if not Authenticate(requestingEntity):
        return Error("Authentication Failed")

    // Retrieve shard metadata based on identifier
    shardMetadataList = GetShardMetadata(identifier)

    // Filter out expired shards
    validShardMetadataList = FilterExpiredShards(shardMetadataList)

    // Retrieve valid shards from repositories
    shards = RetrieveShards(validShardMetadataList)

    // Verify shard integrity and authenticity (digital signatures)
    if not VerifyShards(shards):
        return Error("Shard Verification Failed")

    // Reconstruct key using secret sharing algorithm
    reconstructedKey = ReconstructKey(shards)

    return reconstructedKey
```

This approach creates a highly resilient and granular key management system that reduces the risk of data compromise and enhances long-term data security. It moves beyond the notion of a single ‘durable’ key to a dynamic, distributed, and self-healing key infrastructure.
