## Dynamic Resolution Sensory Fusion

**Concept:** A system leveraging the linear algebra and neural network acceleration to dynamically adjust the resolution of sensory input streams *before* processing, based on environmental context and processing load. This isn’t about upscaling/downscaling images; it’s about selectively *capturing* data at varying granularities.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on *processing* data from sensors. This design targets the *acquisition* phase, pre-processing, significantly reducing computational burden by strategically choosing what data to acquire. It builds on the linear algebra acceleration to make rapid decisions about spatial/temporal sampling.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Utilize a sensor suite including cameras, microphones, and motion sensors (as in the patent). Each sensor must have adjustable parameters – frame rate, resolution, sample rate, field of view/aperture.
*   **Contextual Awareness Module (CAM):** A module powered by a lightweight neural network (running on the neural network accelerator). The CAM receives low-resolution pre-scan data from *all* sensors. It identifies regions of high interest (ROI) – moving objects, significant sound events, areas with high geometric change, etc.
*   **Dynamic Sampling Controller (DSC):** This module is the core innovation. It receives ROI data from the CAM. Based on the ROI size, urgency (motion speed, sound intensity), and available processing resources (estimated by a resource manager), the DSC dynamically adjusts the sensor parameters.
    *   **Priority-Based Allocation:** Sensors are given priority levels. High-priority sensors (e.g., cameras tracking fast-moving objects) receive the highest resolution/sampling rates.
    *   **Sparsity Control:** Implement a “sparsity” metric.  The DSC aims to minimize the total data acquired while maintaining a target level of information capture. If an area is static, sensors dramatically reduce resolution or sampling.
    *   **Temporal Prioritization:** Focus higher sampling rates on recent data. Older data (which may be redundant) is captured at a significantly reduced rate.
*   **Linear Algebra Integration:** The DSC uses the linear algebra accelerator for fast calculations related to ROI size, data compression matrices, and resource allocation. This specifically includes:
    *   **ROI Feature Vector Generation:** Linear algebra routines compute feature vectors describing the size, shape, and motion of each ROI.
    *   **Resource Prediction:** Using historical data and current sensor loads, predict future resource availability using matrix-based forecasting techniques.
    *   **Data Compression/Decompression:** Apply sparse matrix representations for efficient data storage and transmission.
*   **Neural Network Integration:** The CAM and DSC both leverage the neural network accelerator.
    *   **CAM Network:** Trained to identify ROIs from low-resolution pre-scan data.
    *   **DSC Policy Network:**  A reinforcement learning agent trained to optimize sensor parameters based on ROI data and resource constraints.
*   **Data Stream Multiplexing:** All sensor data streams are multiplexed and delivered to the existing neural network and linear algebra accelerators for further processing.



**Pseudocode (DSC Policy Network):**

```
function determine_sensor_params(roi_data, resource_status):
    // roi_data:  Feature vector (size, shape, motion) of ROI
    // resource_status:  Available processing power (CPU, memory, accelerator units)

    // Policy Network:  Trained RL agent
    sensor_params = PolicyNetwork.predict(roi_data, resource_status)

    // sensor_params:  Dictionary containing:
    //   - camera_resolution
    //   - camera_framerate
    //   - microphone_samplerate
    //   - motion_sensor_sensitivity

    return sensor_params
