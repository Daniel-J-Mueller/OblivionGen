## Predictive Pre-fetching with Dynamic Distribution Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the latency reduction system to *proactively* pre-fetch network page elements based on predicted latency, moving beyond reactive modification. This system will dynamically adjust weighting factors applied to different probability distributions (not just gamma) to prioritize pre-fetching of elements predicted to have high latency *and* a high probability of being requested.

**System Components:**

*   **Latency Data Collector:** (Existing - modified). Collects latency data *and* request frequency for all network page elements (images, scripts, data blocks).  Adds a 'request count' metric per element.
*   **Distribution Estimator:** (Existing - extended). Estimates *multiple* distributions (Gamma, Log-Normal, Uniform, Exponential) for latency data of each element.  Calculates a 'goodness of fit' score for each distribution.
*   **Probability Predictor:** A new module. This component predicts the probability of a user requesting a specific network page element *before* the request is made. Input features include:
    *   User browsing history.
    *   Time of day.
    *   User location.
    *   Current page content.
    *   Popularity of the element (aggregated request count).
*   **Dynamic Weighting Engine:**  A core module. This engine assigns weights to each distribution *per element*, based on:
    *   ‘Goodness of fit’ score.
    *   Predicted request probability.
    *   Element size (larger elements benefit more from pre-fetching).
    *   Network bandwidth availability (dynamically adjusts pre-fetching aggressiveness).

*   **Pre-fetch Manager:**  A new module. Initiates pre-fetching requests for elements based on a weighted score calculated from the Dynamic Weighting Engine.  The weighted score is:

    `Weighted Score = (Latency Prediction * Distribution Weight) * Request Probability`

    Where:

    *   `Latency Prediction` is the estimated latency based on the selected distribution.
    *   `Distribution Weight` is the weight assigned to that distribution.
    *   `Request Probability` is the probability of request (0-1).

*   **Cache Manager:** (Existing - modified).  Stores pre-fetched elements. Uses a Least Recently Used (LRU) or similar eviction policy.

**Pseudocode – Dynamic Weighting Engine:**

```
function calculate_distribution_weights(element_data):
  // element_data contains goodness_of_fit scores for each distribution,
  // request_probability, element_size, and bandwidth_availability

  // Normalize goodness of fit scores
  normalized_scores = normalize(element_data.goodness_of_fit_scores)

  // Scale normalized scores by request probability and element size
  scaled_scores = [score * element_data.request_probability * element_data.element_size for score in normalized_scores]

  // Adjust for bandwidth availability
  bandwidth_factor = element_data.bandwidth_availability  // 0-1

  // Apply bandwidth factor
  final_weights = [weight * bandwidth_factor for weight in scaled_weights]

  // Normalize final weights to sum to 1
  total_weight = sum(final_weights)
  distribution_weights = [weight / total_weight for weight in final_weights]

  return distribution_weights
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **ElementProfile:**
    *   ElementID: Unique identifier for the network page element.
    *   LatencyData: Array of latency measurements.
    *   RequestCount: Integer, number of times element has been requested.
    *   DistributionParameters: Dictionary mapping distribution type (Gamma, Log-Normal, etc.) to distribution parameters (shape, scale, etc.).
    *   DistributionWeights: Array of weights for each distribution.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Machine learning models could be used to predict request probabilities.
*   Bandwidth availability can be estimated based on network monitoring or user feedback.
*   A/B testing should be used to optimize the weighting parameters.
*   The system should be designed to handle dynamic changes in network conditions and user behavior.
