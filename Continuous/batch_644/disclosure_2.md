## Dynamic Workflow "Seeds" & Generative Branching

**Concept:** Extend the core workflow assembly tool by introducing "Seeds"—pre-configured workflow fragments representing common tasks or data flows. These Seeds aren’t simply drag-and-drop components, but *generative* starting points, capable of branching out into more complex workflows based on user input or external data.

**Specs:**

1.  **Seed Library:**
    *   A curated library of workflow Seeds categorized by function (e.g., “Image Processing,” “Data Ingestion,” “Report Generation”).
    *   Each Seed includes a core set of nodes *and* associated parameters defining its generative behavior. These parameters could be simple (e.g., “Number of iterations”) or complex (e.g., a schema defining expected input data).
    *   Seeds are versioned, allowing users to roll back to previous configurations or contribute new Seeds to a central repository.

2.  **Generative Engine:**
    *   Upon selection of a Seed, a “Generative Engine” analyzes the Seed’s parameters and dynamically expands the core workflow.
    *   Expansion rules are defined within the Seed itself. For example, a Seed for “Data Cleansing” might generate additional nodes for outlier detection, missing value imputation, or data transformation based on the data schema.
    *   The generative engine utilizes a rule-based system and potentially incorporates AI/ML models to suggest optimal workflow configurations.

3.  **Real-time Preview & Feedback:**
    *   As the workflow expands, a real-time preview displays the generated nodes and connections.
    *   The user can provide feedback on the generated workflow, either by manually adjusting nodes or by providing “steering” parameters to the generative engine.
    *   The system learns from user feedback to improve its generative capabilities over time.

4.  **Data-Driven Branching:**
    *   The generative engine can utilize *external data* to guide workflow branching.
    *   For example, if the input data contains metadata indicating the data source, the generative engine can automatically add nodes for data validation or transformation specific to that source.
    *   This allows workflows to adapt dynamically to changing data conditions.

5.  **Workflow "Morphing":**
    *   Allow users to "morph" existing workflows into new ones by applying Seeds.
    *   The system intelligently merges the Seed’s nodes and connections with the existing workflow, resolving conflicts and ensuring data flow consistency.
    *   This enables rapid prototyping and experimentation with different workflow configurations.

**Pseudocode (Generative Engine):**

```
function generateWorkflow(seed, inputData, userParameters):
  coreWorkflow = seed.getCoreWorkflow()
  expansionRules = seed.getExpansionRules()

  for rule in expansionRules:
    if rule.condition(inputData, userParameters):
      newNodes = rule.generateNodes(inputData, userParameters)
      connectNodes(coreWorkflow, newNodes, rule.getConnectionPoints())

  return coreWorkflow
```

**Innovation Rationale:**

This system shifts the focus from *building* workflows to *growing* them. By leveraging generative techniques and data-driven branching, it empowers users to create complex workflows with minimal effort. This will reduce development time, and allows users to experiment with alternative workflows. The integration with external data sources enables adaptive workflows that can respond dynamically to changing conditions.
