## Aerial Vehicle Swarm Mapping with Bioluminescence Mimicry

**Concept:** Develop a system where a swarm of miniature aerial vehicles (MAVs) utilizes coordinated bioluminescence-mimicking light patterns for 3D environment mapping and obstacle avoidance, operating independently of traditional acoustic or electromagnetic sensors. This builds on the perpendicular array concept by shifting the signal type and operational mode.

**Specifications:**

*   **MAV Dimensions:** 5cm x 5cm x 2cm (approximate)
*   **Swarm Size:** Variable, up to 100 MAVs.
*   **Propulsion:** Quadcopter configuration, miniature brushless DC motors.
*   **Lighting System:** Each MAV equipped with a dense array of micro-LEDs capable of emitting light across a limited spectrum (blue/green dominant, mimicking common bioluminescence).  Individual LEDs addressable for precise pattern control.
*   **Power Source:** Miniature solid-state batteries, rechargeable via inductive charging dock.
*   **Communication:** Mesh network utilizing visible light communication (VLC). Each MAV acts as a node, relaying data and coordinating patterns.
*   **Perception System:** No dedicated camera or LiDAR. Rely entirely on the reflected light patterns captured by other MAVs in the swarm.
*   **Control System:** Decentralized control algorithm. Each MAV executes a set of pre-programmed behaviors and reacts to the light patterns received from its neighbors.
*   **Mapping Algorithm:** The core of the system. Based on time-of-flight of the emitted light, triangulation, and pattern recognition.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** Swarm launched. Each MAV activates its light emission system and begins broadcasting a unique identification signal (modulated light pattern).
2.  **Exploration:** MAVs disperse and begin exploring the environment.  They emit a series of patterned light pulses.
3.  **Reflection Capture:** Each MAV captures the reflected light from surrounding objects and other MAVs. The intensity and arrival time of the reflected light are recorded.
4.  **Triangulation & Mapping:** Using the arrival times of the reflected light from multiple MAVs, the system calculates the distance and bearing to the reflecting object. This data is used to create a 3D point cloud map of the environment.
5.  **Obstacle Avoidance:** Real-time analysis of the reflected light patterns allows the swarm to detect and avoid obstacles.
6.  **Data Consolidation:** The swarm communicates the collected data back to a ground station for further processing and visualization.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Mapping Algorithm - Single MAV perspective):**

```
// Variables
float timeOfEmission;
float timeOfReception;
float distanceToTarget;
float angleToTarget;
float currentX, currentY, currentZ; // MAV's current coordinates

// Function to calculate distance based on time-of-flight
function calculateDistance(timeOfEmission, timeOfReception):
    distance = (speedOfLight * (timeOfReception - timeOfEmission)) / 2;
    return distance

// Function to determine angle of arrival based on reflected light intensity from multiple MAVs
function calculateAngle(intensity1, intensity2, ...):
    // Algorithm to weight intensities and determine the angle of the reflected light
    angle = ...
    return angle

//Main Loop
while (swarmActive):
    timeOfEmission = getCurrentTime();
    emitLightPulse();

    if (lightReflected()):
        timeOfReception = getCurrentTime();
        distanceToTarget = calculateDistance(timeOfEmission, timeOfReception);
        angleToTarget = calculateAngle(...);

        // Convert polar coordinates (distance, angle) to Cartesian coordinates
        x = currentX + distanceToTarget * cos(angleToTarget);
        y = currentY + distanceToTarget * sin(angleToTarget);
        z = currentZ;

        // Store the 3D point in the map
        map.addPoint(x, y, z);
    end if

end while
```
