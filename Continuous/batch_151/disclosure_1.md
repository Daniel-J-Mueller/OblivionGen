## Automated Compartmental Airflow Regulation & Predictive Spoilage

**Concept:** Enhance the refrigerator’s ability to mitigate spoilage by actively adjusting airflow within compartments *before* spoilage is detected, based on learned food profiles and predicted decay rates. This shifts the focus from *detecting* spoilage to *preventing* it through proactive environmental control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Food Profile Database & Learning Module:**

*   **Data Input:**  Refrigerator equipped with an internal camera (RGB & IR) capable of identifying food items placed within compartments. User input via app/interface for manual identification/confirmation.
*   **Data Storage:** Database linking food items to predicted spoilage rates based on type, quantity, and typical storage conditions.  Cloud-based for data sharing & updating.
*   **Learning Algorithm:**  Machine learning model that refines spoilage rate predictions based on historical data (sensor readings, user feedback - e.g., "this lettuce was still good after a week," “the strawberries molded quickly”).

**2. Compartmental Airflow Control System:**

*   **Micro-Dampers:** Each compartment equipped with electronically controlled micro-dampers regulating airflow from the refrigerator’s main cooling system.
*   **Airflow Sensors:**  Sensors within each compartment measuring airflow rate & temperature.
*   **Control Logic:** Algorithm that adjusts damper positions based on:
    *   Food profile (predicted spoilage rate).
    *   Airflow/temperature sensor readings.
    *   Compartment occupancy (determined via camera/weight sensors).
    *   Refrigerator overall load (total food quantity).

**3. Predictive Spoilage Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Food profile, airflow/temperature data, compartment occupancy, refrigerator load.
*   **Process:**  Calculates a ‘spoilage risk score’ for each food item.  Higher score indicates a greater likelihood of spoilage within a defined timeframe.
*   **Output:**  Adjusts airflow settings to minimize spoilage risk.  May prioritize airflow to compartments with high-risk items.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Main Loop
While (Refrigerator is running) {
    // 1. Food Identification & Profiling
    foodItems = IdentifyFoodItems(cameraData);
    for (foodItem in foodItems) {
        foodProfile = GetFoodProfile(foodItem);
        foodProfile.UpdateHistoricalData(sensorData);
    }

    // 2. Spoilage Risk Assessment
    for (foodItem in foodItems) {
        spoilageRisk = CalculateSpoilageRisk(foodItem.type, foodItem.quantity, sensorData);
    }

    // 3. Airflow Optimization
    for (compartment in compartments) {
        targetAirflow = CalculateTargetAirflow(compartment.occupancy, compartment.foodItems, spoilageRisk);
        AdjustMicroDampers(compartment, targetAirflow);
    }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution internal camera (RGB + IR).
*   Micro-dampers for each compartment.
*   Airflow sensors.
*   Weight sensors (optional, for improved occupancy detection).
*   Dedicated microcontroller for airflow control.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with grocery shopping lists & automatic food profiling.
*   User notifications regarding potential spoilage & suggested consumption.
*   Energy optimization – dynamically adjust cooling based on compartment needs.
*   Compartment lighting adjustment based on airflow/occupancy to maximize food preservation.
