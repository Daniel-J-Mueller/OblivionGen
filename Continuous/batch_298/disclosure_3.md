## Dynamic Projection Mapping with Haptic Feedback

**Core Concept:** Augment projected visuals with localized haptic feedback, creating a more immersive and interactive experience. This builds on the idea of identifying projection surfaces, but adds a layer of physical sensation tied to the projected content.

**System Components:**

*   **Enhanced Depth/Visual Sensor Suite:** Existing depth and visual sensors (as per the patent) supplemented with:
    *   **Micro-Vibration Array:**  An array of micro-vibrators strategically positioned near the projector. Density: 50 vibrators per square foot of projected area. Frequency Range: 20Hz - 200Hz. Amplitude Control: Individual amplitude control for each vibrator.
    *   **Air Jet Array:** Array of micro air jets for localized thermal or tactile stimulation.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance processor capable of real-time image processing, depth analysis, and haptic pattern generation.
*   **Projection System:** High-resolution projector with keystone correction and brightness control.
*   **Software Suite:**
    *   **Surface Analysis Module:** Identifies surface properties (texture, material) as in the original patent.
    *   **Content Analysis Module:** Analyzes projected content to identify key features/events triggering haptic feedback.
    *   **Haptic Pattern Generation Module:** Translates content features into appropriate haptic patterns (vibration intensity, frequency, air jet bursts).
    *   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Combines depth, visual, and potentially audio data to determine precise haptic stimulation locations.
    *   **Calibration Module:** Automated calibration of vibration/air jet array with the identified projection surface.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Environment Scan:** The system scans the room, identifying planar projection surfaces using depth and visual data (as in the original patent).  Surface characteristics (material, texture) are also recorded.
2.  **Content Analysis:** Projected content is analyzed in real-time to identify elements suitable for haptic augmentation (e.g., textures, impacts, moving objects).
3.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:** Based on the content analysis and surface properties, the system generates appropriate haptic patterns. For example:
    *   Projected ‘rough’ texture on a wall could trigger corresponding micro-vibrations on the wall's surface.
    *   A virtual ball impacting a wall would trigger a localized burst of vibration at the point of impact.
    *   Moving projected objects could create a ‘trailing’ sensation as they move across the surface.
4.  **Haptic Stimulation:** The micro-vibration/air jet array delivers the generated haptic patterns to the projection surface. The intensity and frequency of stimulation are dynamically adjusted based on content changes and surface properties.
5.  **Calibration/Feedback Loop:** Continuous calibration ensures accurate alignment of haptic stimulation with projected visuals.  User feedback (optional) could be used to refine haptic patterns.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(contentFeature, surfaceProperty):
  if contentFeature == "texture" and surfaceProperty == "smooth":
    hapticPattern = VibrationPattern(frequency=50Hz, amplitude=0.2)
  elif contentFeature == "impact" and surfaceProperty == "hard":
    hapticPattern = VibrationPattern(frequency=100Hz, amplitude=0.8, duration=0.1s)
  elif contentFeature == "movingObject" and surfaceProperty == "soft":
    hapticPattern = VibrationPattern(frequency=30Hz, amplitude=0.1, duration=0.05s, trail=True)
  else:
    hapticPattern = VibrationPattern(frequency=0Hz, amplitude=0) # No haptic feedback

  return hapticPattern
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive gaming environments
*   Immersive training simulations
*   Enhanced museum exhibits
*   Tactile accessibility solutions for visually impaired users
*   Artistic installations with multi-sensory feedback
*   Retail displays with tangible product representations.
