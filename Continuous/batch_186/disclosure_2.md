## Acoustic Tap Box Status

**Specification:** Integrate directional audio emitters into the suspended annunciator system to provide nuanced status alerts alongside or instead of visual cues.

**Components:**

*   **Tap Box Unit:** Existing tap box assembly with integrated monitoring circuitry (voltage, current, breaker status).
*   **Annunciator Unit:** Modified suspended annunciator housing.
    *   Miniature directional audio emitter (capable of producing distinct tones/frequencies).
    *   Microcontroller for signal processing and audio output.
    *   Power supply (derived from tap box power or separate small battery).
    *   Wireless communication module (optional, for remote configuration/diagnostics).
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Algorithm to map tap box status to specific audio signals.
    *   Configuration interface (via wireless module or local connection).

**Functionality:**

1.  **Status Mapping:** The tap box monitoring circuitry continuously monitors its internal status (voltage, current, breaker position). This data is transmitted to the annunciator unit (wired or wirelessly).
2.  **Audio Signal Generation:** The annunciator’s microcontroller interprets the status data and generates a corresponding audio signal using the directional emitter.
    *   **Normal Operation:**  A low-frequency (sub-audible) 'heartbeat' tone – confirms the system is alive but doesn’t cause annoyance.
    *   **Minor Warning (e.g., High Current):** A short, repeating, mid-frequency tone (e.g., 1kHz, 50% duty cycle).
    *   **Critical Alert (e.g., Breaker Tripped):**  A distinct, attention-grabbing tone sequence (e.g., a descending three-tone chime). The sequence could repeat until acknowledged.
    *   **Directional Emission:** The directional emitter focuses the sound towards the end of the aisle, allowing technicians to pinpoint the source of the alert.
3.  **Configuration:**  The system should be configurable to adjust the volume, tone frequencies, and alert sequences. This could be done remotely via a wireless interface or locally via a physical interface on the annunciator.
4.  **Integration with Visual Signals:** The acoustic alerts can be combined with the existing visual signals (colored lights) for redundant indication.

**Pseudocode (Annunciator Firmware):**

```
loop:
    status = receive_tapbox_status()
    if status.voltage > threshold_high:
        play_warning_tone(frequency=1kHz, duty_cycle=50%)
    elif status.current > threshold_high:
        play_warning_tone(frequency=1.5kHz, duty_cycle=50%)
    elif status.breaker_tripped:
        play_critical_alert()  // Three-tone descending chime sequence
    else:
        play_heartbeat()  // Low-frequency sub-audible tone
    delay(100ms)
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   **Improved Situational Awareness:**  Technicians can quickly identify the location of a problem without visually scanning the entire aisle.
*   **Redundancy:** Provides an alternative alerting method in case of visual impairment or system failure.
*   **Accessibility:** Benefits technicians with visual impairments.
*   **Reduced Noise Pollution:**  Directional emission minimizes sound spillover to other areas.
*   **Increased Responsiveness:**  A distinct audio alert can grab attention more effectively than a visual cue alone.
