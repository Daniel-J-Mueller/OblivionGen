## Adaptive Frequency Allocation via Multi-Diplexer Network

**Concept:** Expand the diplexer concept to a dynamically reconfigurable network enabling adaptive frequency allocation to individual beamforming circuits. Instead of a fixed high/low frequency split, implement a network of diplexers and electronically controlled switches to tailor frequency distribution *per antenna element*.

**Specifications:**

*   **Network Topology:**  A mesh network of micro-diplexers. Each antenna element receives signals via a dedicated branch of the mesh.
*   **Micro-Diplexer Design:** Utilize compact, high-isolation micro-diplexers fabricated on a single substrate (e.g., LTCC or silicon).  Each micro-diplexer splits incoming signals into two frequency bands (LO and Reference Clock, as in the patent).  Key parameters:
    *   Insertion Loss: < 0.5 dB
    *   Isolation: > 30 dB
    *   Size: < 2mm x 2mm
*   **Switching Matrix:** Implement a digital switching matrix using RF MEMS switches or GaN FET switches to control signal routing. The matrix allows any antenna element to be assigned either the LO signal, the reference clock, or a combination of both.
*   **Control System:** A microcontroller (e.g., ARM Cortex-M series) manages the switching matrix.  The control system receives feedback from the beamforming circuits (signal quality, interference levels) and dynamically adjusts frequency allocation.
*   **Frequency Bands:**
    *   LO Frequency: 24-28 GHz (adjustable)
    *   Reference Clock Frequency: 10-14 GHz (adjustable) â€“ allow for substantial variation.
*   **Power Distribution:** Integrated power amplifiers (PA) and low-noise amplifiers (LNA) within each micro-diplexer branch to compensate for signal loss and maintain signal integrity.
*   **Calibration:** An automated calibration routine to compensate for variations in component performance and ensure optimal signal transmission.
* **Pseudocode for Adaptive Allocation:**

```
// Initialize:
//   Establish communication with Beamforming circuits.
//   Calibrate micro-diplexers and switches.

LOOP:
  FOR EACH Antenna Element:
    Get Signal Quality Metrics (SINR, PER) from Beamforming Circuit.
    IF Signal Quality is LOW:
      // Attempt Frequency Swap
      IF currently receiving LO:
        // Switch to Reference Clock
        Activate Switch to route Reference Clock signal.
      ELSE:
        // Switch to LO signal
        Activate Switch to route LO signal.
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  // Global Optimization
  // Analyze overall system performance.
  // Adjust frequency allocation to minimize interference and maximize throughput.

  // Delay for a short period before repeating the loop.
ENDLOOP
```

* **Potential Benefits:**
    *   Enhanced Beamforming Performance: Tailored frequency allocation optimizes signal quality and reduces interference.
    *   Increased System Capacity: Dynamic frequency allocation allows for more efficient use of the available spectrum.
    *   Improved Robustness: Adaptability to changing channel conditions and interference environments.
    *   Flexibility: Easily reconfigurable to support different waveforms and communication protocols.
* **Materials:**
    *   Substrate: LTCC or Silicon
    *   Switches: RF MEMS or GaN FET
    *   Passive Components: High-Q capacitors and inductors.
