## Dynamic Contextual Item "Shadows" & Anticipatory Q&A

**Concept:** Extend the item exploration beyond direct search results/item views by creating “shadows” – dynamic, AI-populated contextual interfaces that appear *alongside* search results or while browsing, anticipating user questions *before* they are asked, and surfacing relevant information proactively.

**Specification:**

1.  **Shadow Generation:** 
    *   Upon initial search or item view, an AI analyzes the item (description, category, associated keywords, user interaction data).
    *   AI generates a “Shadow” interface – a small, visually distinct panel/overlay. This isn’t a full chat window initially, but a curated list of likely questions and short-form answers (think: 3-5 bullet points).
    *   Shadow placement: Initially appears adjacent to search result listings or alongside the item details view. 
2.  **Anticipatory Q&A Core:**
    *   **Question Prioritization:** AI ranks potential questions based on:
        *   Popularity (across all users).
        *   Contextual Relevance (to the current search/item).
        *   User Profile (past interactions, preferences).
        *   Trending Questions (real-time data).
    *   **Answer Generation:**
        *   Uses a combination of: pre-populated knowledge bases, product specifications, user reviews (sentiment analysis), and potentially, real-time web scraping.
        *   Answers are concise & formatted for quick consumption (bullet points, short paragraphs).
        *   Confidence Scoring: Each answer is assigned a confidence score. Low confidence answers are flagged (e.g., "Answer may not be completely accurate").
3.  **Dynamic Interaction & Expansion:**
    *   **"Reveal More"**: Users can tap/click on a question to expand it, revealing a more detailed answer & potentially a link to a full Q&A section or external resource.
    *   **Custom Question Input**: Users can type in their own questions.  The AI processes the question and generates an answer (or flags it if it's unanswerable).
    *   **"Shadow" Personalization**:  The "Shadow" learns from user interactions. Questions answered/ignored, custom questions asked, and expanded answers all contribute to a personalized Q&A experience.
    *   **"Shadow" Evolution**: The "Shadow" can evolve from a simple Q&A panel to a more interactive chatbot-like interface as the user engages with it.
4.  **Data Flow & System Components:**

```pseudocode
// System Initialization
Initialize AI Knowledge Base
Load Product Data (descriptions, specs, reviews)
Initialize User Profiles

// On Search/Item View
item = GetItemFromSearch/View
shadow = CreateShadow(item) // Generates initial Q&A list
Display shadow alongside item

// User Interaction Loop
while (user is interacting) {
    userAction = GetUserAction()
    if (userAction is "Expand Question") {
        DisplayDetailedAnswer(userAction.question)
    } else if (userAction is "Ask New Question") {
        answer = GenerateAnswer(userAction.question)
        DisplayAnswer(answer)
    }
    // Update shadow Q&A list based on user interactions and data updates
    UpdateShadow(item, userInteractions, newKnowledge)
}
```

5.  **Visual Design:**
    *   "Shadow" panel is visually distinct from the main content.
    *   Uses a clean, minimalist design.
    *   Questions are prominently displayed.
    *   Answers are concise and easy to read.
    *   Option to "Dismiss" or "Hide" the "Shadow" panel.
