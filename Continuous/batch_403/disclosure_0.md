## Predictive Multi-Sensor Incident Reconstruction

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond reactive storage extension (triggered by emergency calls or image analysis) to *proactive* incident reconstruction using a network of interconnected A/V devices and environmental sensors. The system anticipates potential incidents and begins logging/analyzing data *before* an emergency call is made, building a comprehensive, multi-dimensional reconstruction.

**System Components:**

*   **A/V Nodes:** Existing A/V recording devices (cameras, smart doorbells, etc.). Enhanced with:
    *   Edge processing for basic anomaly detection (motion, sound).
    *   Secure, low-latency communication protocol for inter-node data sharing.
    *   Environmental Sensor Integration: Capability to receive data from nearby sensors (temperature, air quality, vibration, glass break detectors, etc.).
*   **Central Reconstruction Server:**  Processes data streams from A/V Nodes and sensors. 
    *   AI-powered incident prediction engine.
    *   Multi-sensor data fusion algorithms.
    *   Spatiotemporal data reconstruction module.
    *   Secure storage for reconstructed incident data.
*   **User Interface:**  Displays reconstructed incidents in a timeline-based, interactive format. Allows users to review events from multiple perspectives.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** Each A/V node and sensor establishes a baseline of normal activity (sound levels, movement patterns, temperature, etc.).
2.  **Anomaly Detection:**  Edge processing on A/V Nodes identifies potential anomalies.
3.  **Predictive Analysis:** Anomaly data is transmitted to the Central Reconstruction Server. The server's AI engine analyzes data from multiple nodes and sensors, comparing it to baseline data and identifying potential incidents (e.g., a rapid temperature increase combined with unusual sounds and movement could indicate a fire).
4.  **Pre-Incident Logging:**  If the AI engine predicts a high probability of an incident, it initiates *pre-incident logging*. This involves increasing the logging resolution and capturing data from all nearby nodes and sensors. 
5.  **Incident Reconstruction:** Upon confirmation of an incident (emergency call, alarm trigger, or AI confirmation), the Central Reconstruction Server fuses all captured data to create a detailed, multi-dimensional reconstruction of the event. This reconstruction includes:
    *   Timeline of events.
    *   3D visualization of the environment.
    *   Audio and video recordings from multiple perspectives.
    *   Sensor data (temperature, air quality, etc.).
6.  **Secure Storage & Access:** The reconstructed incident data is securely stored and accessible to authorized users (homeowners, security personnel, law enforcement).

**Pseudocode (Incident Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_incident(sensor_data_stream):
  // Input: Stream of data from A/V nodes and sensors
  // Output: Incident probability (0.0 - 1.0)

  baseline_data = get_baseline_data(sensor_data_stream.location)

  anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(sensor_data_stream, baseline_data)

  if anomaly_score > anomaly_threshold:
    // Trigger pre-incident logging
    initiate_pre_incident_logging(sensor_data_stream.location)

  incident_probability = calculate_incident_probability(anomaly_score, historical_data)

  return incident_probability
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simply extending storage duration *after* an event. It aims to *predict* incidents and proactively gather data to create a more comprehensive reconstruction. This predictive capability, coupled with multi-sensor data fusion, provides a significantly more powerful and informative system. The system isn't waiting for an event; it's anticipating and preparing for it.
