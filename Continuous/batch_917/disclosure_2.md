## Dynamic Mesh Networking for UAV Swarms – Enhanced Positional Accuracy

**System Overview:**

This system utilizes a distributed, self-healing mesh network overlaid on the existing directional antenna orientation system to dramatically increase positional accuracy for UAV swarms, particularly in GPS-denied or contested environments. It moves beyond simple pairwise antenna alignment toward a collaborative positioning system.

**Components:**

*   **UAV Node:** Each UAV is equipped with:
    *   A directional antenna (as per the base patent).
    *   An omnidirectional antenna (as per the base patent).
    *   A short-range, high-bandwidth radio (e.g., 802.11ad/WiGig) for mesh network communication.
    *   An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) & Barometric Altimeter.
    *   Edge computing module (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
*   **Ground Station/Lead UAV:** Acts as the initial network anchor and provides coarse time synchronization.

**Functional Specifications:**

1.  **Network Initialization:**
    *   Lead UAV broadcasts a synchronization beacon.
    *   UAVs within range establish mesh connections with the lead and each other.
2.  **Collaborative Localization:**
    *   Each UAV periodically transmits:
        *   Its estimated position (from IMU/Baro fusion – initial estimate).
        *   Angle of Arrival (AoA) readings from its directional antenna to *multiple* neighboring UAVs.
        *   Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) from neighboring UAVs.
    *   Neighboring UAVs receive these broadcasts.
3.  **Position Refinement:**
    *   Each UAV runs a localized Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) or Particle Filter.
    *   EKF/Particle Filter fuses:
        *   IMU/Baro data.
        *   AoA/RSSI measurements from neighboring UAVs.  This is where the mesh network provides significant benefit.  Multiple, independent angular measurements provide redundancy and reduce error.
        *   Known terrain/obstacle map data (optional, for further refinement).
    *   The EKF/Particle Filter iteratively updates the UAV’s estimated position.
4.  **Antenna Orientation Control Loop:**
    *   The refined position data is fed into the antenna orientation controller (as per the base patent).
    *   The controller adjusts the directional antenna to maintain optimal alignment with the nearest neighboring UAV (or target, if applicable).
5.  **Network Healing:**
    *   If a UAV loses connection with a neighbor, the mesh network automatically re-routes communication through alternative paths.
    *   The EKF/Particle Filters adapt to the changing network topology.
6.  **Data Transmission:**
    *   High-bandwidth data can be relayed across the mesh network, enabling cooperative sensing, task coordination, and data sharing.

**Pseudocode (UAV Node – Position Refinement):**

```
// Initialization
Initialize IMU/Baro fusion filter (KF/PF)
Initialize Network Connections

Loop:
    // Data Acquisition
    imu_data = Read IMU data
    baro_data = Read Barometer data
    network_data = Receive data from neighboring UAVs

    // Data Processing
    // Extract position, AoA, RSSI from network_data
    // Calculate position estimates based on AoA/RSSI measurements
    // Fuse IMU/Baro data with network-based position estimates using KF/PF

    refined_position = KF/PF.update(imu_data, baro_data, network_data)

    // Antenna Control
    desired_orientation = Calculate desired antenna orientation based on refined_position and neighbor positions
    Send control signal to antenna orientation controller to adjust antenna to desired_orientation

    // Network Maintenance
    Update network topology information
    Re-establish connections if necessary

```
