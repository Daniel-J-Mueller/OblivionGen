## Dynamic Workload-Aware Hashing with Predictive Re-assignment

**Concept:** Extend the existing hash-to-target mapping with a predictive component, proactively shifting hash assignments based on anticipated workload fluctuations *before* they impact performance. This moves beyond reactive re-balancing (claims 11-12) to a predictive, anticipatory system.

**Specs:**

1.  **Workload Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O) from each computing device, historical workload data (time-series), request type distributions.
    *   Algorithm: Time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict short-term (e.g., 5-15 minute) workload increases/decreases for each device. Also, machine learning models to predict workload based on request type, time of day, user behavior, etc.
    *   Output: Probability distribution of predicted workload for each computing device.

2.  **Hash Assignment Policy Engine:**
    *   Input: Predicted workload distributions from the Workload Prediction Module, current hash-to-target mapping, request rate.
    *   Policy: A cost function that balances workload distribution (minimizing variance), hash collisions, and re-assignment overhead.  The policy dynamically adjusts the modulo remainder used in the hash mapping (claim 10) *before* a device becomes overloaded.
    *   Re-assignment Granularity: Not just shifting entire hash ranges (claims 11-12), but *partial* re-assignment based on predicted demand. For example, a range of hash values known to be associated with high-latency tasks could be temporarily shifted to a less loaded device, even if the device's overall workload isn’t critical.

3.  **Adaptive Hashing Table:**
    *   Implementation: A distributed hashing table (DHT) is used to store the hash-to-target mapping. This allows for decentralized management and scalability.
    *   Version Control:  Each hash-to-target mapping is assigned a version number. The DHT maintains multiple versions of the mapping, allowing for smooth transitions during re-assignment.
    *   Rollback Mechanism:  If a re-assignment proves ineffective (e.g., performance degrades), the system can quickly rollback to the previous version of the mapping.

4.  **Request Interception & Redirection:**
    *   Proxy Layer: A lightweight proxy sits in front of the computing devices.
    *   Mapping Lookup: The proxy intercepts each request, looks up the target device based on the current hash-to-target mapping, and forwards the request accordingly.
    *   Version Consistency: The proxy ensures it’s using the latest version of the mapping from the DHT.

**Pseudocode (Hash Assignment Policy Engine):**

```
function calculate_new_mapping(predicted_workloads, current_mapping, request_rate):
  // weights for cost function
  workload_balance_weight = 0.6
  collision_avoidance_weight = 0.3
  reassignment_cost_weight = 0.1

  // Calculate cost for current mapping
  current_cost = calculate_cost(predicted_workloads, current_mapping, workload_balance_weight, collision_avoidance_weight, reassignment_cost_weight)

  best_mapping = current_mapping
  best_cost = current_cost

  // Iterate through potential mapping adjustments
  for each possible adjustment in generate_possible_adjustments(current_mapping):
    new_cost = calculate_cost(predicted_workloads, adjustment, workload_balance_weight, collision_avoidance_weight, reassignment_cost_weight)
    if new_cost < best_cost:
      best_cost = new_cost
      best_mapping = adjustment

  return best_mapping

function generate_possible_adjustments(current_mapping):
  // Generates variations of the current mapping.  Could involve:
  // 1. Shifting hash ranges between devices
  // 2. Splitting or merging hash ranges
  // 3. Adjusting the modulo remainder
  // Limit the number of variations to prevent excessive computation

  // Example:
  variations = []
  for i in range(number_of_devices):
    for j in range(i + 1, number_of_devices):
      // Create a new mapping where some hash values are shifted from device i to device j
      new_mapping = create_shifted_mapping(current_mapping, i, j)
      variations.append(new_mapping)

  return variations

function calculate_cost(predicted_workloads, mapping, workload_balance_weight, collision_avoidance_weight, reassignment_cost_weight):
  // Calculate the cost based on workload balance, collision avoidance, and reassignment cost.
  // Use appropriate metrics to quantify each factor.
  // Return a combined cost value.
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond *reactive* workload balancing to *proactive* adjustment, minimizing performance impacts and improving resource utilization. The predictive component adds a layer of intelligence and adaptability not present in existing systems.
