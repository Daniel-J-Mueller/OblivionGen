## Adaptive Trust Scoring with Ephemeral Key Exchange

**Concept:** Extend the shared secret/public key trust model to incorporate dynamic trust scoring based on real-time behavioral biometrics and network analysis, and combine this with a continuously refreshed ephemeral key exchange for enhanced security and adaptive access control.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometric Engine:** Collects and analyzes user behavioral data (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, app usage patterns) on the client device.
*   **Network Trust Analyzer:** Monitors network characteristics (IP reputation, geolocation consistency, connection type, traffic patterns) associated with the client device.
*   **Trust Scoring Module:** Combines outputs from the Behavioral Biometric Engine and Network Trust Analyzer, weighting each factor based on configurable parameters. Produces a dynamic trust score ranging from 0-100.
*   **Ephemeral Key Exchange Manager:** Facilitates continuous key exchange using a Diffie-Hellman variant (e.g., ECDH) but with a rapidly rotating key schedule (every 5-30 seconds).
*   **Adaptive Access Control Policy Engine:** Evaluates the trust score in real-time against pre-defined access control policies. Adjusts encryption levels, session timeouts, or authentication requirements based on the score.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Handshake:** Standard authentication process establishes initial trust and shared secret (as per the provided patent context).
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Behavioral Biometric Engine and Network Trust Analyzer continuously collect data.
3.  **Trust Score Calculation:** Trust Scoring Module combines data, generating a dynamic trust score.
4.  **Key Rotation:** Ephemeral Key Exchange Manager initiates a new key exchange based on the shared secret *and* the current trust score.  Higher trust scores allow for longer key lifetimes. Lower scores trigger more frequent rotations.
5.  **Policy Enforcement:** Adaptive Access Control Policy Engine evaluates the trust score against defined policies. This determines:
    *   Encryption level for data transmission (AES-256 for high trust, AES-128 for medium, limited access for low).
    *   Session timeout values (longer for high trust, shorter for low).
    *   Multi-factor authentication requirements (optional for high trust, mandatory for medium/low).
6.  **Anomaly Detection:** Significant deviations in behavioral biometrics or network characteristics trigger immediate trust score reduction and potentially session termination.

**III. Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
// Weights are configurable
behavioralWeight = 0.6
networkWeight = 0.4

// Normalized values (0-1)
normalizedBehavioralScore = normalize(behavioralData);
normalizedNetworkScore = normalize(networkData);

// Trust Score Calculation
trustScore = (normalizedBehavioralScore * behavioralWeight) + (normalizedNetworkScore * networkWeight);

// Score Clipping
trustScore = clamp(trustScore, 0, 100);

// Function to normalize data
function normalize(data) {
  // Implement logic to scale data to a 0-1 range
  // Example: (data - minData) / (maxData - minData)
}

// Function to clamp values
function clamp(value, min, max) {
  return Math.max(min, Math.min(value, max));
}
```

**IV. Technical Specifications:**

*   **Programming Languages:** Python (backend), JavaScript/WebAssembly (client-side biometric analysis).
*   **Cryptography Libraries:** OpenSSL, Sodium.
*   **Machine Learning Framework:** TensorFlow/PyTorch (for behavioral biometric analysis).
*   **Data Storage:** Secure, encrypted database for storing behavioral baselines (optional, for long-term analysis).
*   **API Integration:** RESTful API for seamless integration with existing applications.

**V. Novelty:**

This system moves beyond static trust models based solely on shared secrets. It dynamically adapts security measures based on real-time user behavior and network context, offering a more resilient and flexible security architecture. The continuous ephemeral key exchange, coupled with trust-based key lifetime adjustments, significantly reduces the attack surface and mitigates the risks associated with compromised keys.
