**Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Code Complexity**

**Specification:**

*   **Core Concept:** Instead of solely reacting to request *rate*, proactively allocate compute resources based on *predicted complexity* of the incoming code execution requests. This anticipates needs before they manifest as high request rates.

*   **Complexity Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Incoming code execution request (code snippet, function call, API endpoint, etc.).
    *   Process: Utilize a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., a transformer model fine-tuned on code analysis) to predict code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, Halstead volume, cognitive complexity, estimated execution time). The model must be capable of handling diverse programming languages.
    *   Output: A ‘complexity score’ representing the estimated computational demand.  Scale: 0-100.

*   **Resource Allocation Controller:**
    *   Input: Complexity score from the Complexity Prediction Module, Current resource utilization, Historical data of complexity scores and resource usage.
    *   Process:
        1.  Maintain a rolling average of incoming complexity scores.
        2.  Compare the rolling average to pre-defined thresholds (Low, Medium, High complexity).
        3.  Dynamically adjust the rate at which virtual machine instances are added to the warming pool.
        4.  Utilize predictive scaling algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing) based on historical data to forecast future complexity and scale resources accordingly.
        5.  Implement a 'cost-aware' scaling strategy. Prioritize allocation to cost-optimized instance types based on complexity score. High complexity requests are allocated to powerful, but expensive instances. Low complexity requests utilize cheaper instances.
    *   Output:  Scaling directives (number of instances to add/remove, instance type).

*   **Warming Pool Configuration:**
    *   Create specialized warming pools tailored to anticipated complexity levels.
        *   'Lightweight' warming pool: Instances optimized for low-complexity tasks.
        *   'Heavyweight' warming pool: Instances equipped with high CPU/memory for complex tasks.
    *   The Resource Allocation Controller directs requests to the appropriate warming pool based on predicted complexity.

*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor actual execution time and resource utilization for each request.
    *   Use this data to refine the Complexity Prediction Module and the Resource Allocation Controller, improving prediction accuracy and resource efficiency.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Complexity Prediction Module
function predictComplexity(codeRequest):
  complexityScore = MLModel.predict(codeRequest)
  return complexityScore

// Resource Allocation Controller
function allocateResources():
  rollingAvgComplexity = calculateRollingAverage(historicalComplexityScores)
  if rollingAvgComplexity > HighThreshold:
    scalingDirective = {action: "add", instances: X, type: "heavyweight"}
  elif rollingAvgComplexity > MediumThreshold:
    scalingDirective = {action: "add", instances: Y, type: "standard"}
  else:
    scalingDirective = {action: "maintain", instances: 0}
  return scalingDirective

// Main Loop
while True:
  codeRequest = receiveRequest()
  complexityScore = predictComplexity(codeRequest)
  historicalComplexityScores.append(complexityScore)
  scalingDirective = allocateResources()
  warmPool.applyScalingDirective(scalingDirective)
  routeRequestToWarmPool(codeRequest)
```
