## Adaptive Traffic Mirroring with Predictive Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing out-of-band monitoring by incorporating predictive analysis to dynamically adjust traffic mirroring policies *before* security events occur, rather than solely reacting to them. This involves building a baseline of ‘normal’ network behavior, then identifying anomalies *predictively* and proactively mirroring traffic from potentially compromised sources or to sensitive destinations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Analysis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Network flow data (NetFlow, sFlow, IPFIX), system logs, threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Algorithms:** Machine learning models (e.g., anomaly detection, time-series forecasting) to establish baseline network behavior for each client. Models must be adaptable to client-specific network topologies and traffic patterns.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each network flow based on deviation from baseline. Scores should factor in source/destination IP, port, protocol, and data volume.
*   **Predictive Thresholds:**  Client-configurable thresholds for anomaly scores that trigger proactive mirroring. Thresholds must be adjustable based on sensitivity and acceptable false positive rates.

**2. Dynamic Mirroring Control Plane:**

*   **Integration with Existing Replication Technology:** Leverages the existing replication infrastructure to dynamically adjust mirroring policies.
*   **Mirroring Policy Definition:**  Policies based on:
    *   Source IP/CIDR
    *   Destination IP/CIDR
    *   Port Range
    *   Protocol
    *   Anomaly Score Threshold
*   **Policy Enforcement:**  Communication with network devices (switches, routers) to configure mirroring/SPAN ports or configure traffic redirection based on defined policies.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitoring of mirrored traffic for actual security events. This data is used to refine the predictive models and improve anomaly detection accuracy.

**3.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Agentless Architecture:**  Preferably, avoid deploying agents on client systems to minimize overhead and complexity. Rely on network device capabilities for traffic analysis.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle large volumes of network traffic and a high number of clients. Consider distributed processing and caching mechanisms.
*   **API Integration:** Provide APIs for integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems and other security tools.
*   **Configuration Management:** A centralized configuration management system to manage mirroring policies and predictive models across all clients.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Mirroring Policy Adjustment):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Collect Network Flow Data
  flowData = getNetworkFlowData();

  // Analyze Flow Data & Calculate Anomaly Scores
  anomalyScores = analyzeFlowData(flowData);

  // Identify Flows Exceeding Predictive Thresholds
  highRiskFlows = identifyHighRiskFlows(anomalyScores, client.predictiveThreshold);

  // Adjust Mirroring Policies
  for each flow in highRiskFlows {
    // Add mirroring policy for source/destination IP, port, protocol
    addMirroringPolicy(flow.sourceIP, flow.destinationIP, flow.sourcePort, flow.destinationPort, flow.protocol);
  }

  // Remove mirroring policies for flows that no longer exceed thresholds (after a timeout)
  cleanupOldPolicies();
}

```

**Innovation Focus:**  Shifting from reactive traffic mirroring to proactive mirroring based on *predicted* threats.  This requires the development of accurate predictive models and a flexible mirroring control plane capable of dynamically adjusting policies. The system aims to reduce the attack surface and improve security posture by detecting and mitigating threats before they can fully materialize.
