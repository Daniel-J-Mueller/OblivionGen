## Predictive Prefetching via Query Decomposition and Distributed Cache Priming

**System Overview:** A distributed system extending the core concepts of the provided patent, focusing on aggressive prefetching and cache priming *before* query arrival by dynamically decomposing queries into sub-queries and distributing priming requests across database replicas. This anticipates not just *when* a query type will arrive, but *what parts* of the data it will need.

**Core Innovation:** The system learns to decompose complex queries into a minimal set of dependent sub-queries. Each sub-query targets a specific data subset. These sub-queries are then used for proactive, distributed cache priming. This differs from simple “priming queries” as it targets *specific* data access patterns predicted from query decomposition.

**Components:**

*   **Query Decomposition Engine (QDE):** This module analyzes historical query logs and execution plans to learn how to decompose complex queries. Decomposition is based on identifying independent data access paths within the query.  QDE outputs a 'decomposition tree' for each query type.
*   **Distributed Priming Coordinator (DPC):**  Responsible for orchestrating the distributed cache priming. It receives decomposition trees from QDE and translates them into a sequence of priming sub-queries. It also selects the database replicas best suited to handle each priming sub-query based on their cached data (using existing caching state metadata).
*   **Replica Awareness Module (RAM):**  Integrated into each database replica, RAM receives priming sub-queries from DPC and executes them, updating the cache. It also reports cache hit/miss rates for each primed sub-query back to DPC. This provides feedback for optimizing priming strategies.
*   **Historical Query Log:** A time series dataset which records query patterns, execution plan statistics, and cache hit/miss data.

**Pseudocode (DPC Orchestration):**

```pseudocode
// Function: OrchestratePriming(query_type)
// Input: Query Type (e.g., "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ?")

decomposition_tree = QDE.GetDecompositionTree(query_type)

if decomposition_tree is null:
    // Handle unknown query types (e.g., basic priming)
    basic_priming_query = GenerateBasicPrimingQuery(query_type)
    DPC.SendPrimingQuery(basic_priming_query, BestReplica()) // Selects best replica based on load/data
    return

// Prioritize sub-queries based on estimated data access cost (e.g., table scan vs. index lookup)
prioritized_subqueries = PrioritizeSubqueries(decomposition_tree)

for subquery in prioritized_subqueries:
    best_replica = SelectBestReplica(subquery) // Uses caching metadata and load balancing
    DPC.SendPrimingQuery(subquery, best_replica)
    RAM.RecordPrimeHit(best_replica, subquery)

// Update Historical Query Log with prime hit/miss data
UpdateHistoricalQueryLog(query_type, prime_hit_data)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Decomposition Tree:** A tree structure where the root node represents the original query, and leaf nodes represent minimal sub-queries. Each node stores metadata about estimated data access cost and data dependencies.
*   **Prime Request:** A structured request containing the sub-query, the target replica, and a priority level.
*   **Cache Metadata Record:**  Extends existing metadata to include "prime hit count" and "prime miss count" for each data object.

**Refinements/Extensions:**

*   **Adaptive Priming:** Dynamically adjust the number and priority of priming sub-queries based on real-time workload and cache hit rates.
*   **Cross-Replica Data Prefetching:**  If a specific data object is not cached on the primary replica, proactively prefetch it from other replicas.
*   **Query Similarity Matching:**  Identify similar queries in the historical log and reuse their decomposition trees.

**Novelty:** This extends simple priming by decomposing queries and proactively priming *specific* data subsets. It moves beyond anticipating *when* a query will arrive to predicting *what data* it will need. The use of decomposition trees and distributed priming coordinators adds a layer of sophistication that's not present in existing approaches.
