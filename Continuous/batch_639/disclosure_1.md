## Dynamic Perspective Anchors & Relighting

**Concept:** Expand on the perspective transformation by not just correcting for angle, but *augmenting* the scene with dynamically placed “perspective anchors” and relighting based on estimated 3D geometry. This aims to create a more immersive and realistically corrected image, addressing issues where simple perspective correction still feels “flat” or unnatural.

**Specs:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Camera Array:**  A configuration of at least three cameras, arranged in a slightly offset configuration. This enables rudimentary depth estimation even *without* dedicated depth sensors. Calibration is critical.
*   **IR Emitter/Sensor Pair (Optional):** For improved low-light depth estimation. Would add cost, but substantially improve reliability of depth data.
*   **High-Performance Image Processor (HIP):** Required for real-time processing of multiple camera streams, depth estimation, and perspective/relighting calculations. Minimum:  Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 equivalent.
*   **Display System:**  High refresh rate, high dynamic range display (minimum 120Hz, HDR10+).  Important for visualizing the effect of the relighting.

**II. Software/Algorithm Details:**

1.  **Multi-View Stereo (MVS) Depth Estimation:**
    *   Employ an MVS algorithm (e.g., PMVS, COLMAP) to generate a sparse point cloud from the multi-camera input.
    *   Filter the point cloud to remove noise and outliers.
    *   Upsample the sparse point cloud into a dense depth map using techniques like Poisson surface reconstruction.
    *   Handle occlusions and areas with insufficient data by blending with the original image or using inpainting techniques.

2.  **Perspective Anchor Placement:**
    *   Identify key features in the depth map (e.g., corners, edges, distinct objects).
    *   Place "Perspective Anchors" at these features. These anchors represent 3D points in the scene.
    *   The number and density of anchors are adjustable parameters, balancing accuracy and computational cost.

3.  **Dynamic Perspective Warp:**
    *   Instead of a single global perspective transformation, perform a *local* perspective warp around each anchor.
    *   The warp is calculated based on the anchor’s 3D position and the desired view angle.
    *   This creates a more natural and less distorted image, especially for complex scenes.  Effectively “re-projecting” parts of the image based on the 3D geometry.

4.  **Relighting Engine:**
    *   Estimate the lighting direction and intensity in the scene based on the depth map and image analysis.
    *   Calculate the illumination for each anchor point based on the estimated lighting.
    *   Apply a physically-based rendering (PBR) model to simulate the interaction of light with surfaces around the anchors.
    *   Blend the relit regions with the original image to create a realistic and immersive lighting effect.

5.  **User-Adjustable Parameters:**
    *   Anchor Density: Control the number of anchors to balance accuracy and performance.
    *   Relighting Strength: Adjust the intensity of the relighting effect.
    *   Anchor Radius: Control the area around each anchor that is affected by the perspective warp and relighting.
    *   Strength Parameter (as defined in the patent): Maintain control over the overall perspective correction strength.

**III. Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
FOR each frame:
    Capture images from multi-camera array
    Generate depth map using MVS algorithm
    Identify key features in depth map
    Place Perspective Anchors at key features
    FOR each pixel in image:
        Find closest Anchor
        Calculate perspective warp based on Anchor’s 3D position
        Apply warp to pixel
        Calculate relighting based on Anchor’s illumination
        Blend relit pixel with original pixel
    Display warped and relit image
```

**IV. Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced video conferencing: More realistic and immersive remote meetings.
*   Architectural visualization: Accurate representation of spaces from any angle.
*   Virtual reality/augmented reality: Seamless integration of virtual objects into real-world scenes.
*   Medical imaging: Improved visualization of 3D anatomical structures.
