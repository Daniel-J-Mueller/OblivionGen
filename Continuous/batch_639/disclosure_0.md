## Dynamic Rule Composition via Genetic Algorithm

**Concept:** Extend the existing rule-based system with a mechanism to *automatically* compose and refine rules, addressing scenarios where defining comprehensive rules upfront is difficult or impossible. This uses a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to evolve a population of rule sets, optimizing for accuracy and efficiency in categorization.

**Specs:**

**1. Rule Representation (Genome):**

*   Each "individual" in the GA population represents a complete set of rules.
*   A rule is represented as a conditional statement: `IF <condition> THEN <code>`.
*   `<condition>`:  A conjunction of attribute checks.  Example: `(AttributeA > 10) AND (AttributeB == "Red")`. Attributes are sourced from the record data.
*   `<code>`: The assigned code/classification.
*   Genome Structure:  A list of rules.  Example: `[Rule1, Rule2, ..., RuleN]`.

**2. Fitness Function:**

*   Requires a labeled training dataset (records with known correct classifications).
*   Fitness Score = `(Accuracy) - (ComplexityPenalty)`.
    *   *Accuracy*: Percentage of records correctly classified using the rule set.
    *   *ComplexityPenalty*:  A value penalizing overly complex rule sets. Measured by:
        *   Number of rules.
        *   Number of attributes used per rule.
        *   Depth of nested conditions within a rule.
*   The weighting of Accuracy and ComplexityPenalty is configurable.  Prioritize accuracy for high-precision tasks, or simplicity for faster processing.

**3. Genetic Operators:**

*   **Selection:** Tournament Selection.  Randomly select a subset of individuals; the individual with the highest fitness wins.
*   **Crossover:**  Single-point or multi-point crossover. Swap portions of the rule lists between two parent individuals.
*   **Mutation:**
    *   *Rule Addition*: Randomly add a new rule to the rule list.
    *   *Rule Deletion*: Randomly remove a rule from the rule list.
    *   *Condition Modification*: Randomly change an attribute or its value within a condition.
    *   *Code Modification*: Randomly change the assigned code.
*   Mutation Rate: Configurable.

**4. System Integration:**

*   **Training Phase:**  Run the GA on the labeled training dataset. Periodically evaluate performance. Stop when a satisfactory fitness score is achieved or a maximum number of generations is reached.
*   **Deployment:**  The best rule set from the training phase becomes the active categorization engine.
*   **Continuous Learning:**  Monitor categorization performance in real-time.  If performance degrades, trigger a retraining phase using new data.

**5. Pseudocode (Training Phase):**

```
Initialize population of random rule sets (Individuals)
For each generation:
    For each Individual:
        Calculate Fitness Score based on labeled dataset
    Select best Individuals for reproduction (Tournament Selection)
    Create new generation through Crossover and Mutation
    If Fitness Score meets threshold or max generations reached:
        Break loop

Return best Individual (rule set)
```

**6.  Data Structures:**

*   `Rule`:  `{condition: string, code: string}`
*   `Individual`: `[Rule, Rule, ...]`
*   `Population`: `[Individual, Individual, ...]`

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond static rule definition and validation, enabling the system to *learn* optimal categorization strategies from data.  The GA-based approach can discover subtle patterns that would be difficult to manually identify, especially in complex datasets. This avoids the need for laborious manual rule creation and maintenance, improving adaptability.
