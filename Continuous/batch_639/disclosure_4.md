## Dynamic Webpage ‘Health’ Score & Predictive Load Times

**Concept:** Extend the statistical modeling to not only detect *current* page load problems, but to *predict* potential future issues and dynamically assign a “health” score to a webpage, influencing load prioritization and user experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Baseline Establishment:**

*   **Extended Statistics:** Beyond HTML/JS/CSS byte counts & DOM/div counts, collect data on:
    *   Third-party resource load times (per domain).
    *   JavaScript execution times (per script).
    *   CSS rendering times (per stylesheet).
    *   Image load times (per image, categorized by size/format).
    *   Frequency of 404/500 errors for resources.
*   **Historical Data Storage:** Store this data in a time-series database, linked to specific webpage URLs.  Retain data for at least 30 days, with configurable retention policies.
*   **Baseline Calculation:**  Establish baselines for all collected metrics over a rolling window (e.g., 7 days).  Calculate mean, standard deviation, and percentiles.

**2. ‘Health’ Score Calculation:**

*   **Weighted Metrics:** Assign weights to each metric based on its perceived impact on user experience.  (e.g., JS execution time: 30%, 3rd party load times: 25%, Error Rate: 20%, Byte counts: 15%, DOM/Div counts: 10%) – Weights are configurable.
*   **Z-Score Normalization:** For each metric, calculate a Z-score ( (Current Value - Mean) / Standard Deviation ). This normalizes the values, allowing comparison across different metrics.
*   **Health Score Formula:**  Sum the weighted Z-scores for all metrics.  Scale the result to a 0-100 range.  `Health Score = Σ (Weight_i * Z-Score_i)`
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Implement an AI algorithm (e.g., reinforcement learning) to dynamically adjust metric weights based on observed user behavior (e.g., bounce rates, time on page).

**3. Predictive Load Time Modeling:**

*   **Regression Analysis:**  Utilize the historical data and calculated Health Scores to train a regression model (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to predict page load times. Features used for prediction should include:
    *   Current Health Score.
    *   Recent Health Score trends (e.g., 7-day average, rate of change).
    *   Time of day/day of week.
    *   User location (approximate, based on IP address).
*   **Confidence Intervals:**  Generate confidence intervals around the predicted load time to represent the uncertainty.

**4. Client-Side Implementation:**

*   **Web Worker:** Utilize a Web Worker to perform the Health Score calculation and load time prediction in the background, without blocking the main thread.
*   **Pre-fetching & Prioritization:** Based on the predicted load time, prioritize the loading of critical resources.  If the predicted load time exceeds a threshold, pre-fetch resources or display a loading indicator.
*   **Adaptive Resource Loading:** Dynamically adjust resource loading based on the user's connection speed and device capabilities.
*   **Telemetry:** Report the actual load time, Health Score, and predicted load time back to the server for model refinement.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function calculateHealthScore(data) {
  // Calculate Z-scores for each metric
  // Apply weights
  // Sum weighted Z-scores
  return healthScore
}

function predictLoadTime(healthScore, timeOfDay, userLocation) {
  // Use trained regression model
  return predictedLoadTime, confidenceInterval
}

// On page load:
historicalData = fetchHistoricalData(url)
healthScore = calculateHealthScore(historicalData)
predictedLoadTime, confidenceInterval = predictLoadTime(healthScore, currentTime, userLocation)

if (predictedLoadTime > threshold) {
  // Prefetch resources or show loading indicator
}
```

**Server-Side Considerations:**

*   Model Training & Updates: Regularly retrain the regression model using accumulated data.
*   Anomaly Detection: Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify sudden drops in Health Score, potentially indicating a server-side issue.
*   Scalability: Design the data storage and processing infrastructure to handle a large volume of requests and data.
