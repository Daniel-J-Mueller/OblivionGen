## Dynamic Landing Page "Mood" Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the landing page selection process to incorporate real-time "mood" detection from the user’s input (text, voice, even micro-expressions via webcam - optional) and dynamically adjust the landing page *content* – not just the page itself – to better resonate with that detected mood. This goes beyond simple A/B testing and demographic targeting.

**Specifications:**

**1. Mood Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** User input stream (text from search bar/form fills, voice from voice search/assistant interaction, optional webcam feed for micro-expression analysis).
*   **Processing:** Utilizes a multi-modal sentiment analysis engine.
    *   **Text Analysis:**  NLP models (BERT, RoBERTa) to determine sentiment, emotion (joy, sadness, anger, fear, etc.), and intent.
    *   **Voice Analysis:** Acoustic feature extraction (pitch, tone, speed) and machine learning models to detect emotional state.
    *   **Visual Analysis (Optional):**  Computer vision algorithms to detect facial expressions and body language cues.
*   **Output:**  A "mood vector" representing the user's emotional state (e.g., [Joy: 0.8, Sadness: 0.1, Anger: 0.05, Neutral: 0.05]).  This vector should be normalized.

**2. Landing Page Content Database:**

*   Structured database containing landing page content *fragments* categorized by mood vectors.  
    *   Fragments: Headlines, images, videos, calls to action, testimonials, product descriptions, background colors, animations, sound effects.
    *   Each fragment is tagged with a mood vector indicating the emotional tone it conveys.  A fragment can be tagged with multiple mood vectors, each with a confidence score.
*   Content Management System (CMS) to allow content creators to easily add, edit, and tag landing page fragments.

**3. Dynamic Landing Page Assembly Engine:**

*   **Input:** Mood vector from Mood Detection Module, original landing page template (from existing landing page selection process), Landing Page Content Database.
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Mood Matching:**  Compare the user's mood vector to the mood vectors of available content fragments.
    2.  **Fragment Selection:** Select fragments that best match the user's mood vector, prioritizing fragments with high confidence scores.  Allow for a ‘mood amplification’ parameter to either subtly reinforce the detected mood or offer a counterpoint.
    3.  **Template Integration:**  Dynamically replace sections of the original landing page template with the selected fragments.
    4.  **Rendering:**  Render the dynamically assembled landing page and serve it to the user.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function assembleLandingPage(userMoodVector, landingPageTemplate, contentDatabase):
  selectedFragments = []

  for section in landingPageTemplate:
    bestFragment = null
    highestMatchScore = -1

    for fragment in contentDatabase:
      if fragment.sectionType == section.sectionType:
        matchScore = cosineSimilarity(userMoodVector, fragment.moodVector)
        if matchScore > highestMatchScore:
          highestMatchScore = matchScore
          bestFragment = fragment

    selectedFragments.append(bestFragment)

  # Integrate selected fragments into the landing page template
  finalLandingPage = integrateFragments(landingPageTemplate, selectedFragments)
  return finalLandingPage
```

**4.  Real-time Adaptation Loop:**

*   Continuously monitor user interaction with the landing page (mouse movements, scrolling, clicks, time spent on page).
*   Use this interaction data to refine the user's mood vector and dynamically adjust the landing page content in real-time.
*   Implement A/B testing of different adaptation strategies to optimize performance.
