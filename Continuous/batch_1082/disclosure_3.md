## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand beyond noise *cancellation* to full acoustic scene *reconstruction*. The existing patent focuses on isolating and suppressing noise. This builds on that by not just removing unwanted sound, but actively *recreating* the desired soundscape – even augmenting it with plausible sounds – to enhance the user experience or provide crucial information.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum 8-element spherical array. Higher density preferred for greater spatial resolution.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated FPGA or ASIC for real-time signal processing. Multi-core CPU for higher-level scene analysis.
*   **Memory:** 64GB RAM for storing acoustic models and reconstructed scenes. 1TB SSD for logging and analysis.
*   **Acoustic Modeling:** Utilize a combination of:
    *   **Directional Impulse Responses (DIRs):** Capture the acoustic characteristics of different directions within a space.
    *   **Sound Event Database:** Extensive library of recorded and synthesized sounds (speech, music, environmental noises). Tagged with spatial and semantic information.
    *   **Generative Acoustic Models:** Employ Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize realistic sounds based on environmental context.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Beamforming Engine:** Extended from the original patent, but with a focus on *selective amplification* rather than suppression.
    *   **Scene Analyzer:** Identifies sound events, their locations, and their semantic meanings (e.g., "car horn," "speech," "birdsong").  Utilizes machine learning for robust event detection.
    *   **Acoustic Reconstruction Engine:** Core module that combines the beamformed signals, the scene analysis data, and the acoustic models to reconstruct the desired soundscape.
    *   **Contextual Awareness Module:** Integrates data from external sources (e.g., GPS, accelerometer, calendar) to understand the user's environment and context.
    *   **User Interface (Optional):** Allows users to customize the reconstructed soundscape (e.g., adjust the level of ambient noise, add or remove sound events).

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Reconstruction Engine):**

```
// Input: Beamformed signals (array of audio streams), Scene Analysis data, Contextual data, Acoustic Models

function reconstructScene(beamformedSignals, sceneData, contextData, acousticModels) {

    // 1. Spatial Decomposition:
    //    Divide the acoustic space into discrete zones.
    zones = createZones(contextData);

    // 2. Sound Event Assignment:
    //    Assign detected sound events to specific zones.
    eventsByZone = assignEventsToZones(sceneData, zones);

    // 3. Zone Reconstruction:
    for each zone in zones {
        // a. Extract relevant beamformed signals for this zone.
        relevantSignals = getSignalsForZone(beamformedSignals, zone);

        // b. Synthesize missing sounds based on acoustic models and context.
        synthesizedSounds = synthesizeSounds(acousticModels, contextData, zone);

        // c. Combine beamformed signals and synthesized sounds.
        combinedSignals = combineSignals(relevantSignals, synthesizedSounds);

        // d. Apply spatialization to create a realistic sound field.
        spatializedSignals = spatializeSignals(combinedSignals, zone);

        // e. Store spatialized signals for this zone.
        zoneSignals[zone] = spatializedSignals;
    }

    // 4. Combine zone signals to create the reconstructed soundscape.
    reconstructedSoundscape = combineZoneSignals(zoneSignals);

    return reconstructedSoundscape;
}
```

**Novelty:** This shifts the focus from noise *reduction* to a holistic acoustic *experience*.  It allows for the creation of immersive soundscapes, the enhancement of communication in noisy environments, or the provision of critical auditory information (e.g., warnings, alerts) that may be masked by background noise.  The use of generative acoustic models allows for the creation of sounds that do not exist in the original recording, adding a layer of realism and immersion.
