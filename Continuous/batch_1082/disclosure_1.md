## Adaptive Tiered Extent Prefetching

**Concept:** Dynamically prefetch extents based on predicted access patterns derived from real-time workload analysis, and tiered storage characteristics. This goes beyond simple caching by anticipating *which* extents are needed *before* a read request is issued, leveraging multiple storage tiers.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Workload Analyzer Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors I/O patterns – read/write ratio, access frequency, data locality, request size.
    *   Employs a Markov model or similar predictive algorithm to forecast future extent access.
    *   Generates a "Prefetch Probability Map" assigning a probability score to each extent.
    *   Parameters: Sliding window size for analysis (configurable), Prediction Horizon (number of future accesses to predict).

2.  **Tiered Storage Manager:**
    *   Defines storage tiers: NVMe SSD, SSD, HDD, Object Storage (cloud).
    *   Associates each tier with latency, cost, and capacity metrics.
    *   Maintains a “Tier Affinity Map” assigning extents to tiers based on access frequency and data lifecycle.  Extents are migrated between tiers dynamically.

3.  **Prefetch Engine:**
    *   Utilizes the Prefetch Probability Map and Tier Affinity Map.
    *   Prioritizes extents for prefetching based on probability *and* tier cost/latency. High probability, low-latency tier = immediate prefetch. Low probability, high-latency tier = delayed or skipped prefetch.
    *   Implements a “Prefetch Queue” managing pending prefetch requests.
    *   Prefetching is asynchronous.
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        For each extent in storage:
            probability = WorkloadAnalyzer.getExtentProbability(extent)
            tier = TieredStorageManager.getExtentTier(extent)
            priority = probability * (1 / tier.latency) // Higher priority for high prob, low latency
            PrefetchQueue.enqueue(extent, priority)

        While (PrefetchQueue is not empty):
            extent = PrefetchQueue.dequeue()
            If (extent not already present in active memory/cache):
                Initiate asynchronous read request to extent's storage tier
                Update extent's metadata to indicate prefetch status
        ```

4.  **Prefetch Validation & Eviction:**
    *   Tracks prefetch accuracy.
    *   If an extent is prefetched but not accessed within a specified time window, it is evicted from active memory/cache.
    *   Eviction policy can be LRU, LFU, or a combination.

5. **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   The Workload Analyzer continuously adjusts the sliding window size, prediction horizon, and eviction parameters based on observed workload characteristics. 
    *   This ensures that the prefetching system adapts to changing workloads and minimizes false positives/negatives.

**Data Structures:**

*   `ExtentMetadata`: Contains information about an extent – size, location, access frequency, prefetch status, tier affinity.
*   `PrefetchQueue`: Priority queue storing extents to be prefetched.

**Considerations:**

*   Overhead of workload analysis and queue management.
*   Potential for increased storage costs if excessive prefetching occurs.
*   Complexity of tier management and data migration.
*   Network bandwidth requirements for prefetching from remote storage tiers.
