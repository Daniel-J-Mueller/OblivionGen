## Dynamic Transaction Prioritization & Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Extend the address decoder functionality to incorporate real-time transaction prioritization based on predicted data access patterns, coupled with dynamic, predictive routing adjustments across the multi-chip system. This moves beyond simple access control to actively *optimizing* throughput.

**Specs:**

*   **Priority Assignment Module:** Integrated within the address decoder. Assigns a priority level (0-15) to each incoming transaction *before* address decoding, based on:
    *   **Historical Access Data:** Maintains a rolling window of recent data access patterns for each source node.
    *   **Data Type:**  Prioritizes transactions involving specific data types (e.g., critical control data, real-time sensor feeds) configurable via registers.
    *   **Transaction Type:**  Distinguishes between read/write operations, favoring reads for anticipated cache misses.
    *   **Source Node ID:** Allows administrative override for specific source nodes.
*   **Predictive Routing Engine:**  Analyzes transaction priority, destination SoC/node, and current network congestion. 
    *   **Congestion Maps:**  Maintains real-time maps of interconnect utilization.
    *   **Path Prediction:** Employs a simple Markov model to predict future interconnect bottlenecks.
    *   **Route Adjustment:** Dynamically adjusts the `first target node ID` generation within the address decoder to steer high-priority transactions along less congested paths.
*   **Adaptive Decode Windows:** The ‘set of SoC decode windows’ and ‘target node decode windows’ are no longer static. The Priority Assignment Module can temporarily *expand* or *contract* these windows based on priority. For example, a high-priority transaction might bypass intermediate nodes and connect directly to a critical memory controller.
*   **Interconnect Signaling:** The address decoder adds a ‘priority tag’ to each outgoing transaction. Interconnect switches must be modified to prioritize forwarding based on this tag.
*   **Register Configuration:** A dedicated set of registers within each address decoder to control:
    *   Priority Assignment weights for each metric (historical data, data type, transaction type, source node).
    *   Maximum allowable window expansion/contraction.
    *   Congestion map update frequency.
    *   Enable/disable dynamic routing.
*   **Pseudocode (Priority Assignment Module):**

```
function assignPriority(transaction):
    priority = 0
    // Historical Data
    if (transaction.destination in historicalAccessData):
        priority += historicalAccessData[transaction.destination].frequency * weightHistorical
    // Data Type
    if (transaction.dataType == "criticalControl"):
        priority += priorityCriticalControl * weightDataType
    // Transaction Type
    if (transaction.type == "read"):
        priority += priorityRead * weightTransactionType
    // Source Node
    priority += sourceNodePriority[transaction.sourceNode] * weightSourceNode
    return priority
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:**  Requires increasing the bandwidth of interconnects to accommodate potential redirection of high-priority transactions. Adds complexity to address decoder design.  Potentially requires specialized hardware acceleration for Markov model calculations.
*   **Future Expansion:**  Integration with machine learning models to predict access patterns with greater accuracy.  Support for quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Dynamic adjustment of priority weights based on system load.
