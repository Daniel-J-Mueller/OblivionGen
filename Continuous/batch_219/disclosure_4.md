## Haptic Navigation Cube

**Concept:** A miniature, multi-faceted input device utilizing localized, dynamic haptic feedback to simulate texture and shape, enabling navigation and control without visual confirmation. Think of it as a Rubik's Cube, but each face can *become* anything.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** 2cm x 2cm x 2cm cube. Constructed from a rigid, lightweight polymer shell.
*   **Surface Technology:** Each of the 6 faces contains a dense array (minimum 100) of micro-actuators capable of independent vertical displacement (0-5mm range). These actuators use either piezoelectric or micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) technology.
*   **Haptic Resolution:** Each actuator capable of at least 3 distinct height levels for texture and shape simulation.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Each face includes a capacitive touch sensor array to detect user interaction (touch, swipe, press).
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller with sufficient memory to store multiple haptic profiles/“scenes”.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0 Low Energy for communication with host device (smartphone, computer, VR headset).
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-polymer battery (minimum 2-hour operating time). Wireless charging capable.

**Operation:**

1.  **Haptic Scene Definition:**  Software defines “scenes” which are maps of actuator heights for each face of the cube. A scene can represent anything – a button, a dial, a 3D map, a text input area.
2.  **User Interaction:** The user manipulates the cube. Touch, swipe, or pressure on a face is detected by the capacitive sensors.
3.  **Dynamic Feedback:** Based on the user’s input and the current haptic scene, the microcontroller activates the micro-actuators to create the desired texture or shape.  For example:
    *   A "button" scene might present a raised circular area on one face.
    *   A "dial" scene might allow the user to feel detents as they rotate their finger across the surface.
    *   A “map” scene could simulate ridges and valleys representing terrain.
4.  **Contextual Adaptation:** The cube can change haptic scenes dynamically based on the application or user input.

**Pseudocode (Scene Rendering):**

```
function RenderHapticScene(sceneData, faceID) {
  // sceneData is a 2D array representing actuator heights for the selected face
  // faceID identifies which face of the cube to render on (0-5)

  for (row = 0; row < actuatorRows; row++) {
    for (col = 0; col < actuatorCols; col++) {
      actuatorHeight = sceneData[row][col];
      // Scale actuatorHeight to the actuator's physical range (0-5mm)
      actuatorPosition = map(actuatorHeight, 0, 1, 0, 5);
      // Send command to individual actuator to set its height
      SetActuatorPosition(faceID, row, col, actuatorPosition);
    }
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **VR/AR Control:** Providing tactile feedback in virtual or augmented reality environments.
*   **Accessibility:** Enabling visually impaired users to interact with digital devices.
*   **Gaming:**  Creating immersive gaming experiences with tactile feedback.
*   **Industrial Control:** Providing tactile feedback for controlling machinery or robots.
*   **Musical Instrument:** Creating a novel tactile music interface.
