## Dynamic Key Shard Distribution with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the data encryption key reference mechanism to distribute *parts* of the data encryption key itself, rather than just a pointer to its encrypted form. These key shards would be distributed to multiple authorized recipients, each with a limited lifespan and a decay function influencing its contribution to key reconstruction.

**Specification:**

1.  **Key Shard Generation:**
    *   The data encryption key is split into *n* shares using a secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).
    *   Each share is encrypted with a unique, recipient-specific public key.
    *   Each encrypted share is assigned a *temporal decay factor* (τ). This factor determines how quickly the share's contribution to key reconstruction diminishes over time.  A higher τ means faster decay.  τ is tied to a timestamp.
    *   Each share is packaged with its decay factor, timestamp, and a validity period.

2.  **Reference Mechanism:** The “data encryption key reference” now points to a list of these distributed key shard locations (URLs, etc.).

3.  **Key Reconstruction Protocol:**
    *   A recipient needing the data encryption key initiates a request, providing the data encryption key reference.
    *   The system retrieves the list of key shard locations.
    *   Each recipient *contributes* their key shard, *if* it is still within its validity period.
    *   The system evaluates the contribution of each shard based on its temporal decay factor and the time elapsed since the shard was generated.  A decay function (e.g., exponential decay) is applied to each shard’s weight.
    *   A weighted sum of the valid key shards is calculated. If the weighted sum meets a pre-defined threshold (representing sufficient key material), the data encryption key is reconstructed.
    *   If the threshold isn’t met, access is denied.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(dataEncryptionKeyReference):
  shardList = retrieveShardLocations(dataEncryptionKeyReference)
  validShards = []

  for each shard in shardList:
    if shard.isValid(): //Checks timestamp + validity period
      decayedWeight = shard.weight * decayFunction(currentTime - shard.creationTime, shard.decayFactor)
      validShards.append((shard, decayedWeight))

  totalWeight = sum(weight for shard, weight in validShards)

  if totalWeight >= thresholdWeight:
    reconstructedKey = combineShards(validShards) // Using secret sharing reconstruction
    return reconstructedKey
  else:
    return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Technical Specs:**

*   **Secret Sharing Algorithm:** Shamir's Secret Sharing (degree *k* out of *n* shares).
*   **Encryption:**  Asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA, ECC) for individual shard encryption.
*   **Decay Function:**  Exponential decay: `decayedWeight = originalWeight * exp(-decayFactor * timeElapsed)`.  The decay factor is configurable based on security requirements.
*   **Threshold:**  The threshold weight is determined by the number of shares, the desired level of fault tolerance, and the sensitivity of the data.
*   **Distributed Storage:** Shards are stored on a distributed storage system to prevent single points of failure.
*   **Auditing:**  Logging of shard access and reconstruction attempts for auditing purposes.



**Innovation:** This approach improves security and resilience by:

*   Reducing the risk of key compromise – an attacker needs to compromise a sufficient number of shards *before* they expire, and within the limited validity window.
*   Enhancing fault tolerance – the system can tolerate the loss or compromise of a certain number of shards without losing access to the data.
*   Providing temporal control – The decay function introduces a time-based element to key access, limiting the impact of long-term key compromise. This would be especially relevant for sensitive data with limited lifespans.
