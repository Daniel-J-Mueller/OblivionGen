## Adaptive Resource Prioritization Based on Predictive Rendering Costs

**Concept:** Extend the performance monitoring to *predict* rendering costs of embedded resources *before* they are fully requested, and dynamically prioritize requests based on these predictions. This moves beyond simply *measuring* performance to *proactively shaping* it, optimizing for user experience given limited bandwidth or processing power.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Cost Model:**

*   **Data Collection:** Augment existing performance data collection with:
    *   Resource type (image, video, script, etc.).
    *   Estimated resource size (obtained from initial response headers).
    *   Client device capabilities (CPU, GPU, screen resolution, network speed â€“ obtained through browser APIs or device profiles).
    *   Historical rendering cost data for similar resources on similar devices.
*   **Cost Calculation:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., regression, neural network) to predict the estimated rendering cost (CPU time, GPU time, memory usage, network bandwidth) for each embedded resource.  The model should be trained on the collected data and continuously updated.

**2. Dynamic Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Priority Score:** Calculate a priority score for each embedded resource based on its predicted rendering cost, resource type, and user-defined preferences (e.g., prioritize visible resources, prioritize critical content). A simplified example:
    `Priority Score = (1 / Predicted Rendering Cost) * Resource Weight`
    Where `Resource Weight` is a configurable value based on resource type (e.g., images = 1, videos = 2, scripts = 0.5).
*   **Request Scheduling:** Implement a scheduling algorithm that prioritizes embedded resource requests based on their priority scores.  This could involve:
    *   Adjusting the order of requests sent to the server.
    *   Throttling lower-priority requests.
    *   Deferring requests until sufficient resources are available.

**3.  Client-Side Implementation:**

*   **Performance Monitoring Integration:** Integrate the predictive cost model and prioritization engine with the existing performance monitoring system (as described in the provided patent).
*   **API Integration:** Expose APIs for configuring prioritization weights and accessing predictive cost data.
*   **JavaScript Library:** Develop a JavaScript library that can be easily integrated into web applications to enable dynamic resource prioritization.

**4. Server-Side Support (Optional):**

*   **Resource Hints:** Allow the client to send hints to the server about its prioritization preferences.
*   **Adaptive Encoding:** Enable the server to adaptively encode resources based on client capabilities and prioritization preferences (e.g., lower-resolution images for low-priority resources).

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// On receiving an initial resource response
function processResourceResponse(response) {
  // Extract resource type and estimated size
  resourceType = getResourceType(response);
  resourceSize = getResourceSize(response);

  // Get client device capabilities
  deviceCapabilities = getDeviceCapabilities();

  // Predict rendering cost
  predictedCost = predictRenderingCost(resourceType, resourceSize, deviceCapabilities);

  // Calculate priority score
  priorityScore = (1 / predictedCost) * getResourceWeight(resourceType);

  // Add resource to prioritized request queue
  prioritizedQueue.add(resource, priorityScore);
}

// Resource request scheduler
function scheduleResourceRequests() {
  while (prioritizedQueue.isNotEmpty()) {
    resource, priorityScore = prioritizedQueue.getNext();

    // Check if resources are available
    if (areResourcesAvailable()) {
      // Request the resource
      requestResource(resource);
    } else {
      // Defer request and retry later
      deferRequest(resource);
    }
  }
}
```
