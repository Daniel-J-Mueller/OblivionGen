## Adaptive Resolution Data Table

**Concept:** Expand the power-saving concept beyond individual buckets/entries to an *adaptive resolution* data table. The core idea is to dynamically adjust the granularity (resolution) of entries within the data table based on access patterns and system load, effectively 'blurring' less frequently accessed data to reduce memory footprint and power consumption.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Table Structure:** The data table is divided into ‘resolution zones’. Each zone represents a level of detail. Higher resolution zones store precise data, while lower resolution zones store aggregated or approximate data.
*   **Resolution Zones:** Minimum of 3 zones: High, Medium, Low. The number of zones is configurable.
*   **Dynamic Resolution Assignment:** A monitoring module tracks access frequency of data elements. Elements accessed infrequently are dynamically moved to lower resolution zones. Frequent elements remain in high resolution zones.
*   **Resolution Transition Logic:** A set of rules dictates when and how data moves between zones. Considerations include: access count threshold, time since last access, system load, and energy budget.
*   **Bloom Filter Integration:** A Bloom filter is used to quickly determine if an element exists in a particular resolution zone before attempting a direct lookup, minimizing unnecessary memory accesses.
*   **Approximation Algorithms:** Algorithms to facilitate the transition to lower resolution. Examples:
    *   **Averaging:** Replace a set of values with their average.
    *   **Quantization:** Reduce the precision of numerical values.
    *   **Hashing/Binning:** Group similar values into buckets.
*   **Programmable Register Control:** Registers control:
    *   Number of resolution zones.
    *   Thresholds for resolution transitions (access count, time since last access).
    *   Approximation algorithm selection for each zone.
    *   Bloom filter parameters (size, hash functions).
*   **Hardware Implementation:** Utilize a dedicated hardware module for resolution management and approximation, offloading the CPU and optimizing performance.

**Pseudocode (Resolution Transition Logic):**

```
function transition_resolution(element, current_resolution):
    access_count = get_access_count(element)
    time_since_last_access = get_time_since_last_access(element)
    system_load = get_system_load()

    if (system_load > HIGH_THRESHOLD and access_count < LOW_THRESHOLD and time_since_last_access > LONG_TIMEOUT):
        if (current_resolution > LOW):
            downgrade_resolution(element)
            return LOW
    elif (system_load < MEDIUM_THRESHOLD and access_count > HIGH_THRESHOLD and time_since_last_access < SHORT_TIMEOUT):
        if (current_resolution < HIGH):
            upgrade_resolution(element)
            return HIGH

    return current_resolution
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant power reduction by minimizing memory accesses and data storage requirements.
*   Improved system performance by focusing resources on frequently accessed data.
*   Adaptive behavior to changing workload patterns.
*   Scalability through configurable resolution zones and approximation algorithms.
