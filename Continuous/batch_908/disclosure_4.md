## Dynamic Thermal Chimney Array - Adaptive Geometry

**Concept:** A rooftop array of modular thermal chimneys whose exhaust port geometry *actively* adjusts based on wind conditions, internal heat load, and chimney-to-chimney interaction. This moves beyond passive Venturi effects towards a responsive, self-optimizing exhaust system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** 60cm x 60cm x 120cm (W x D x H) – standardized for array compatibility. Constructed from lightweight, high-conductivity aluminum alloy.
*   **Exhaust Port – Actuated Geometry:** Each module features an exhaust port comprised of four independently controlled vanes. These vanes are fabricated from a flexible, thermally stable polymer composite.
    *   **Vane Actuation:** Each vane is driven by a small, low-power stepper motor with encoder feedback. Motors are housed within a sealed, weatherproof enclosure integrated into the module’s upper section.
    *   **Range of Motion:** Vanes can rotate from fully open (maximum exhaust) to fully closed (minimum exhaust), with granular control in 1-degree increments.  Closed position serves as a damper during periods of low heat load or high wind.
    *   **Sensor Integration:** Each module integrates the following sensors:
        *   Wind speed/direction (anemometer/wind vane)
        *   Exhaust temperature (thermocouple)
        *   Internal heat load estimate (based on connected HVAC system data via a wireless protocol – MQTT)
        *   Pressure differential sensor (measuring static pressure at the exhaust port)
*   **Sloped Conduit – Internal Surface Treatment:** The internal sloped conduit surface is coated with a hydrophobic, self-cleaning nanocoating to minimize condensation buildup.
*   **Array Interconnect – Wireless Mesh Network:** Modules communicate via a low-power, long-range wireless mesh network (LoRaWAN or Zigbee). This allows for decentralized control and data sharing across the array.
*   **Central Control System – AI-Powered Optimization:** A central control system (edge computing device or cloud-based server) utilizes a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize vane positions in real-time. 
    *   **Reward Function:** The reward function prioritizes:
        *   Maximizing overall exhaust airflow.
        *   Minimizing backpressure within the structure.
        *   Balancing airflow across the entire array to prevent localized hotspots.
        *   Adapting to changing wind conditions to leverage or mitigate their effects.
    *   **Algorithm:** A Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm is implemented to learn the optimal control policy.
*   **Footing Assembly – Integrated Water Management:**  Footing assembly includes a sloped surface and drain channels to divert rainwater away from the intake opening and prevent water ingress.
*   **Power Supply:**  Modules are powered by a combination of integrated solar panels (on the module's top surface) and a low-voltage DC power connection.

**Pseudocode - Central Control System:**

```
// Initialize AI Model (PPO)
model = PPO(state_space, action_space)

// Main Loop
while True:
  // Collect State Data from All Modules
  states = [module.get_state() for module in module_array]

  // Predict Actions (Vane Positions) for Each Module
  actions = model.predict(states)

  // Apply Actions to Modules
  for module, action in zip(module_array, actions):
    module.set_vane_positions(action)

  // Observe Rewards (based on performance metrics)
  rewards = [module.calculate_reward() for module in module_array]

  // Train AI Model
  model.train(states, actions, rewards)

  // Sleep for a short period (e.g., 1 second)
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond static or passively adjusting chimney designs. The actively controlled exhaust ports and AI-powered optimization allow for a dynamic, self-tuning exhaust system that can adapt to a wide range of operating conditions and maximize thermal performance. The mesh network allows for efficient decentralized control and data sharing, enhancing system resilience and scalability.
