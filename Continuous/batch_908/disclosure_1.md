## Dynamic Presentation Area – Predictive User-Specific Micro-Zoning

**Concept:** Enhance the dynamic presentation area by introducing user-specific “micro-zones” within the larger area, predicted and proactively adjusted based on real-time picking patterns *and* anticipated needs derived from order queuing. Instead of simply swapping inventory holders *into* the presentation area, the system dynamically reconfigures *sub-sections* of it, presenting a highly tailored selection *before* the user physically arrives.

**Specs:**

*   **Presentation Area Segmentation:** The presentation area is physically divided into N distinct, configurable zones (e.g., using retractable dividers, modular shelving, or robotic repositioning of sections). N is determined by facility space and throughput requirements. Each zone is equipped with individual item tracking (RFID, computer vision).

*   **User Profile & Predictive Engine:**
    *   Each user has a profile containing historical picking data (items, frequency, time of day, etc.).
    *   A predictive engine analyzes incoming order queues, combining this with user profiles and real-time inventory levels.
    *   The engine generates a “predicted zone map” – specifying which items *and* which zones should be populated for the next anticipated user.
    *   Consideration for task interdependencies. I.e. if user is retrieving items for an assembly, pre-stage components.

*   **Automated Zone Repositioning:**
    *   Robotic systems (AGVs, robotic arms) automatically retrieve and reposition inventory holders *within* the presentation area, reconfiguring the zones according to the predicted zone map. This occurs *before* the user arrives, minimizing wait time.
    *   Priority queueing of inventory holder movement.
    *   Redundancy to account for system failures.

*   **Real-Time Adjustment & Feedback Loop:**
    *   As the user picks items, the system tracks their actions and updates the predictive model.
    *   Real-time adjustments to zone configuration are made based on user behavior (e.g., if a user repeatedly reaches for items in a different zone, the system proactively reconfigures).
    *   Utilize a weighted system of factors: User profile, order queue, real time data.

*   **Visualization & User Interface:**
    *   A display near the presentation area shows the user a visual representation of the current zone configuration, highlighting the items that are most likely to be needed.
    *   The system provides suggestions for alternative items if the user is struggling to find what they need.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// User approaches presentation area
user_id = identify_user()
predicted_zone_map = generate_predicted_zone_map(user_id, order_queue, historical_data)

// Reconfigure zones
for each zone in presentation_area:
    if predicted_zone_map[zone] != current_inventory[zone]:
        remove_inventory(current_inventory[zone])
        add_inventory(predicted_zone_map[zone])

// User picks item
item_picked = track_user_picking(user_id, item)

// Update prediction model
update_prediction_model(user_id, item_picked)

// Continuously monitor and adjust zones based on real-time data
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with augmented reality glasses to guide the user to the desired items.
*   Use of machine learning to optimize zone configuration based on facility layout and user movement patterns.
*   Dynamic lighting to highlight the items in the current zone.
*   Consideration of ergonomics. I.e. pre-stage heavy items at a more accessible height.
