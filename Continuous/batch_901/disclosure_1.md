## Dynamic Context Switching with Predictive Pre-fetching

**Concept:** Extend the memory scheduling to anticipate context switches *during* computation and proactively pre-fetch data for the next context. This goes beyond simply scheduling batches; it’s about building a ‘warm’ pipeline for context changes.

**Specification:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Prediction Engine:** A lightweight neural network (integrated into the controller circuit) trained on past context switch patterns. Input: current computation task, time elapsed within the current context, system load. Output: probability distribution over possible next contexts.
*   **Prefetch Buffer:**  A dedicated memory region (integrated into the state buffer) sized to hold a representative subset of data needed for the *most likely* next context (determined by the Prediction Engine).  This is *in addition* to the buffers for the current context.
*   **Priority Queue:**  A hardware queue (within the controller) to manage data requests – prioritizing requests for the current context, but allowing limited pre-fetching requests for the next context.
*   **Context Metadata Store:** A small, fast-access memory storing metadata about each context – data dependencies, layer configurations, typical data sizes.

**2. Software/Control Flow:**

*   **Training Phase:** The Prediction Engine is trained offline (or online with limited impact) on a representative workload to accurately predict context switches.
*   **Runtime Operation:**
    1.  **Prediction:**  At regular intervals (or triggered by task completion), the Prediction Engine estimates the probability distribution over possible next contexts.
    2.  **Prefetching:** The system selects the context with the highest probability. The controller then initiates pre-fetching of key data elements needed for that context (weights for the next layer, input activations, etc.) into the Prefetch Buffer.  Prefetch requests are throttled to avoid starving the current context.
    3.  **Context Switch:** When a context switch is initiated:
        *   The Prefetch Buffer is swapped into the primary state buffer.
        *   Computation can begin *immediately* with the pre-fetched data, minimizing latency.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system monitors the accuracy of the Prediction Engine. If predictions are consistently wrong, the engine is re-trained (in the background) with updated data.

**3. Pseudocode (Controller Circuit):**

```
// Global Variables
Context currentContext;
PredictionEngine predictor;
PrefetchBuffer prefetchBuffer;
PriorityQueue requestQueue;

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Predict Next Context
    predictedContext = predictor.predictNextContext(currentContext, elapsedTime, systemLoad);

    // 2. Prefetch Data (Throttled)
    if (prefetchBuffer.isEmpty() && predictedContext != null) {
        prefetchData(predictedContext, prefetchBuffer, requestQueue, maxPrefetchRate);
    }

    // 3. Process Data Requests
    request = requestQueue.dequeue();
    if (request != null) {
        processRequest(request);
    }

    // 4. Context Switch (Triggered by external signal)
    if (contextSwitchSignalReceived()) {
        swapBuffers(prefetchBuffer, currentBuffer);
        currentContext = predictedContext;
    }
}
```

**4.  Integration with Existing Patent:**

This builds upon the existing memory scheduling by adding a predictive component.  Instead of *reacting* to context switches, the system *anticipates* them, making the switch faster and smoother.  The Prefetch Buffer acts as a 'staging area' for data, reducing the need to fetch it from slower memory during the switch. It utilizes the same state buffer concepts, but adds a layer of prediction and proactive data loading.
