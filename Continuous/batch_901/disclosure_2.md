## Adaptive Predictive Polling with Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Expand beyond battery level as the sole driver of polling interval adjustments. Integrate data from multiple onboard sensors to *predict* potential network connectivity issues *before* they occur, proactively adjusting the polling interval to conserve power and reduce latency.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Battery charge level (existing in the base patent)
    *   Wi-Fi signal strength (RSSI)
    *   Bluetooth signal strength (RSSI – if applicable/used for initial device setup/control)
    *   Accelerometer (detect device movement/inactivity – movement suggests potential for network disruption due to physical relocation)
    *   Microphone (Ambient noise level - significant noise spikes may indicate environmental factors affecting transmission)
*   **Processor Modules:**
    *   **Sensor Data Aggregator:** Collects and timestamps data from all sensors.
    *   **Predictive Algorithm Module:** A machine learning model (initially trained, then refined via onboard learning) analyzes sensor data to predict:
        *   Probability of Wi-Fi/Bluetooth disconnection within the next X seconds.
        *   Expected signal strength degradation rate.
        *   Probability of user interaction based on device movement (e.g., picking up a doorbell).
    *   **Polling Interval Adjuster:** Dynamically adjusts the polling interval based on the Predictive Algorithm Module’s output.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Data requests to the network device include:
        *   Battery charge level
        *   Current sensor data (raw or aggregated)
        *   Predictive Algorithm Module’s output (probability scores, expected signal degradation)
    *   Network device can respond with commands to:
        *   Adjust polling interval (fine-grained control beyond pre-defined thresholds)
        *   Request additional sensor data for diagnostics.
        *   Trigger data transmission even during low-priority periods (e.g. pre-emptive upload of keyframes if signal degradation is predicted)
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Utilize low-power modes for all sensors when not actively sampling.
    *   Adaptive sampling rates: Increase sampling frequency during periods of high predicted change (e.g., movement, signal degradation).
    *   The device learns optimal polling intervals based on usage patterns and environmental conditions.

**Pseudocode (Polling Interval Adjuster):**

```
function adjustPollingInterval() {
  sensorData = SensorDataAggregator.getLatestData();
  prediction = PredictiveAlgorithmModule.predict(sensorData);

  wifiDisconnectionProbability = prediction.wifiDisconnectionProbability;
  signalDegradationRate = prediction.signalDegradationRate;
  userInteractionProbability = prediction.userInteractionProbability;

  baseInterval = DEFAULT_POLLING_INTERVAL;

  // Adjust based on probability of disconnection
  if (wifiDisconnectionProbability > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
    interval = baseInterval / 2; // Reduce to minimize missed requests
  } else if (wifiDisconnectionProbability > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
    interval = baseInterval * 0.75;
  }

  // Adjust based on signal degradation
  if (signalDegradationRate > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
    interval = interval * 0.8; // further reduce if signal is rapidly deteriorating
  }

  // Adjust based on user interaction probability
  if (userInteractionProbability > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
    interval = baseInterval / 3; // minimize latency for likely user actions
  }

  // battery level adjustment
  if (batteryLevel < LOW_THRESHOLD) {
      interval = interval * 1.5; // extend battery life
  }

  // Limit minimum and maximum intervals
  interval = clamp(interval, MIN_POLLING_INTERVAL, MAX_POLLING_INTERVAL);

  setPollingInterval(interval);
}

```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Edge Computing:** Perform basic prediction calculations directly on the device to reduce network latency and improve responsiveness.
*   **Federated Learning:** Allow devices to share learned prediction models with each other (anonymously) to improve accuracy and generalization.
*   **Sensor Calibration:** Implement onboard calibration routines to maintain sensor accuracy over time.
