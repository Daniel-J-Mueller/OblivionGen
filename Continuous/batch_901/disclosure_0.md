## Adaptive Proximity-Based Mesh Network for Device Recovery

**Concept:** Extend the BLE-based recovery system into a self-healing mesh network, leveraging the proximity of devices to create redundant communication paths and improve recovery success rates, particularly in environments with signal interference or device density.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Role Assignment:** Each device entering the network automatically adopts one of three roles: *Initiator*, *Relay*, or *Observer*. Role is dynamically assigned based on signal strength, battery level, and network load.
*   **Initiator:** The device experiencing network connectivity issues â€“ functions as described in the base patent. Initiates BLE advertisement broadcasts.
*   **Relay:** Devices within range of both the Initiator *and* a connected remote system (or another Relay with connectivity) act as intermediaries, forwarding data packets between them. Relays prioritize connections to other Relays to extend network range and build redundancy.
*   **Observer:** Devices within range of the Initiator (or other Observers/Relays) but *without* direct connectivity to a remote system passively monitor signal strength and report aggregated data to Relays.  This forms a signal map for optimizing routing.
*   **Mesh Routing Protocol:** A simplified, UDP-based routing protocol is implemented. Packets contain a 'hop count' and a destination ID. Relays decrement hop count and forward to the nearest Relay (or Initiator) with a lower hop count or stronger signal. 
*   **Secure Tunneling:**  Establish a TLS tunnel *between* Relays and the remote system, and a separate, lightweight TLS tunnel between the Initiator and the Relay it's currently connected to.  Each hop encrypts/decrypts the payload with a unique key.
*   **Dynamic Frequency Hopping:**  To mitigate interference, Relays periodically scan for the least congested BLE channels and instruct the Initiator and other Relays to switch frequency.
*   **Battery Aware Routing:**  Relays prioritize routing through devices with higher battery levels.  A 'battery score' is included in routing decisions.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** If a Relay fails, the network automatically reroutes traffic through available paths. The network utilizes a 'heartbeat' mechanism to detect failed nodes.
*   **Data Packet Structure:**

    ```
    [Header (Routing Info, Hop Count, Battery Score)] + [Encrypted Payload] + [CRC Checksum]
    ```

**Pseudocode (Relay Node):**

```
function receivePacket(packet):
  if packet.destination == myID:
    decryptPayload(packet.payload)
    forwardToRemoteSystem(decryptedPayload)
  else:
    packet.hopCount--
    bestNextHop = findBestNextHop(packet) // Based on signal strength, battery, hop count
    sendPacket(packet, bestNextHop)

function findBestNextHop(packet):
  neighbors = getNearbyDevices()
  bestHop = null
  bestScore = -1

  for neighbor in neighbors:
    score = neighbor.signalStrength + neighbor.batteryLevel - packet.hopCount
    if score > bestScore:
      bestScore = score
      bestHop = neighbor

  return bestHop
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Devices need to support BLE 5.0 for increased range and throughput.
*   Multi-mode radios capable of simultaneous BLE scanning and data transmission are beneficial.
*   Low-power processing is critical for battery-operated devices.
