## Dynamic Product Bundling & Predictive Discounting

**Concept:** Leverage aggregated purchase data *not* to simply rank products, but to dynamically create personalized product bundles *and* predict the optimal discount needed to trigger a purchase for a specific user, factoring in real-time inventory and merchant margins.

**Specs:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Processing Module:**

*   **Input:** Transactional data stream (as per patent 8266014), user profiles (demographics, browsing history, past purchases), real-time inventory levels from merchants, merchant-defined profit margins.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Association Rule Mining:**  Apply algorithms (e.g., Apriori, FP-Growth) to discover strong association rules between products.  Example: “Users who purchase ‘Coffee Beans’ also frequently purchase ‘Coffee Filter’ and ‘Creamer’ with a confidence of 0.8.”
    *   **User Preference Modeling:**  Create a user preference vector based on past purchases, browsing history, and explicitly stated preferences (e.g., surveys, wishlists).
    *   **Inventory & Margin Integration:**  Constantly update the system with real-time inventory levels and merchant-defined profit margins.  Products with limited inventory or low margins should be excluded from bundle generation or assigned higher discount thresholds.

**II. Bundle Generation Module:**

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  For a given user, identify potential bundle components based on:
        *   Strong association rules (products frequently purchased together).
        *   User preference vector (products aligned with user interests).
        *   Inventory and margin constraints.
    2.  Rank potential bundle components based on a “bundle score” calculated as:
        *   Association Rule Strength * User Preference Weight * (1 – Margin Penalty)
        *   Margin Penalty = 0 if margin > threshold, else (1 - margin/threshold)
    3.  Select the top N bundle components (N configurable) to form a potential bundle.
    4.  Calculate the bundle price as the sum of individual product prices.

**III. Predictive Discounting Module:**

*   **Model:**  Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict the optimal discount needed to trigger a purchase for a specific user and bundle.
*   **Features:**
    *   Bundle price
    *   User’s price sensitivity (estimated from past purchase behavior)
    *   Current inventory levels of bundle components
    *   Competitor pricing (scraped from online retailers)
    *   Time of day, day of week, season
*   **Training:** The model is continuously trained on historical transaction data to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Discount Calculation:** The model outputs a predicted discount percentage. The final bundle price is calculated as: `Bundle Price * (1 – Discount Percentage)`

**IV. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices:**  Each module (Data Acquisition, Bundle Generation, Predictive Discounting) is implemented as a separate microservice.
*   **API Gateway:**  A central API gateway handles all incoming requests and routes them to the appropriate microservice.
*   **Message Queue:**  A message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) is used for asynchronous communication between microservices.
*   **Database:**  A combination of relational and NoSQL databases is used to store data.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Discount Calculation):**

```
function calculate_discount(user_id, bundle_id):
  user_features = get_user_features(user_id)
  bundle_features = get_bundle_features(bundle_id)
  input_features = concatenate(user_features, bundle_features)
  discount_percentage = model.predict(input_features)
  return discount_percentage
```
