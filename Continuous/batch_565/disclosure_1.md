## Adaptive Workspace Lighting & Audio Zoning

**Concept:** Expand the device identification concept beyond visual cues to encompass coordinated lighting and localized audio, creating dynamically adaptable workspaces tailored to individual device/user pairings.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Color LED Array (Per Device):** Integrated into the bezel or a dedicated housing.  Capable of emitting a wide spectrum of colors and adjustable brightness. Minimum resolution: 60 LEDs per device perimeter.
*   **Directional Micro-Speakers (Per Device):** Array of 4-8 micro-speakers integrated into the device housing, focused outwards.  Each speaker capable of independent volume and frequency control.
*   **Ambient Light Sensor (Per Device):**  To dynamically adjust LED brightness based on room lighting conditions.
*   **Microphone Array (Per Device):** For voice command/control and to aid in localized audio beamforming.

**2. Software & Control System:**

*   **Device Discovery & Pairing:** Automatic discovery of devices within a defined network.  User-initiated pairing with assignment of a unique identifier (color, ID number).
*   **Color Mapping:**  User-assignable colors for each device, displayed on the LED array.  Ability to cycle through pre-defined color palettes or customize individual colors.
*   **Audio Zoning Algorithm:** Based on device position and user input, create localized audio zones.  Algorithm prioritizes directing audio output to the immediate vicinity of each device.  Supports multi-user scenarios.
*   **Dynamic Lighting Effects:**  Beyond static color, implement dynamic lighting effects:
    *   **Proximity Awareness:**  LED brightness increases as a user approaches the device.
    *   **Notification Indicator:** LED color changes to indicate notifications (email, messages, etc.).
    *   **Active Application Indicator:**  LED color reflects the primary application currently in use on the device.
*   **Centralized Control Application:**  Software application for initial setup, device pairing, and customization of lighting/audio settings.
*   **API for Integration:** Open API to allow third-party applications to control lighting and audio zoning.

**3. Operational Logic & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Device Initialization
ON DEVICE_BOOT:
  SCAN_NETWORK_FOR_DEVICES()
  DISPLAY_DEFAULT_COLOR()

// Device Pairing
FUNCTION PAIR_DEVICE(selectedDevice):
  REQUEST_COLOR_SELECTION()
  SET_DEVICE_COLOR(selectedColor)
  STORE_DEVICE_ID(deviceID)

// Audio Zoning Algorithm
FUNCTION PROCESS_AUDIO(audioStream):
  GET_DEVICE_POSITIONS()
  FOR EACH device IN devices:
    CALCULATE_AUDIO_DIRECTION(devicePosition)
    SET_SPEAKER_VOLUME(device, volumeLevel)
    SET_SPEAKER_FREQUENCY(device, frequencyLevel)
  OUTPUT_AUDIO_STREAM()

// Dynamic Lighting Algorithm
FUNCTION PROCESS_LIGHTING(event):
  IF event == "proximity":
    INCREASE_LED_BRIGHTNESS()
  ELSE IF event == "notification":
    CHANGE_LED_COLOR(notificationColor)
  ELSE IF event == "application_active":
    CHANGE_LED_COLOR(applicationColor)
```

**4. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:**  Synchronize haptic feedback with audio and visual cues for a more immersive experience.
*   **Biometric Integration:**  Automatically adjust lighting and audio settings based on user identification (facial recognition, etc.).
*   **Spatial Audio Support:** Implement advanced spatial audio techniques to create realistic and immersive soundscapes.
*   **Environmental Awareness:** Integrate data from environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality) to dynamically adjust workspace conditions.
