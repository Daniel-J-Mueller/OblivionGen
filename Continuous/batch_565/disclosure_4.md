## Dynamic Policy Inheritance & Contextual Access

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple directory policies to incorporate real-time contextual data for access control. Instead of static “level of access,” define access based on *who* the user is *plus* *what* they are doing *at this moment*.

**Specification:**

**1. Contextual Data Ingestion:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with external data sources to gather contextual information. Examples:
    *   Device posture (compliant, non-compliant, location).
    *   Time of day/day of week.
    *   User activity (e.g., accessing sensitive data, initiating a financial transaction).
    *   Network context (corporate network, public Wi-Fi).
    *   Threat intelligence feeds (known malicious IPs, malware signatures).
*   **Data Aggregation:**  A 'Context Engine' component aggregates data from various sources, normalizing it into a standardized 'Context Profile'.
*   **Context Profile Storage:**  Context Profiles are stored temporarily (TTL configurable) for each authenticated user session.

**2. Dynamic Policy Definition:**

*   **Policy Language Extension:**  Extend the existing policy language to support contextual variables.  Example:
    *   `ALLOW access to FinanceData IF user.device.compliance == "compliant" AND user.location == "CorporateNetwork" AND time.hour > 9 AND time.hour < 17`.
*   **Policy Editor:** Provide a user interface (or API) for defining policies with contextual variables.  Support 'Policy Templates' for common scenarios.
*   **Policy Compilation:** A 'Policy Compiler' translates the contextual policies into an executable format suitable for the 'Access Engine'.

**3. Access Engine:**

*   **Real-time Evaluation:** The Access Engine receives access requests, retrieves the user's Context Profile, and evaluates the applicable policies in real-time.
*   **Adaptive Access:** Based on policy evaluation, the Access Engine grants or denies access.  It can also trigger adaptive actions (e.g., multi-factor authentication challenge, session termination).
*   **Logging & Auditing:**  Detailed logs of access requests, policy evaluations, and adaptive actions are maintained for auditing purposes.

**4. Integration with Identity Pool:**

*   The Context Engine integrates with the identity pool to retrieve user identity information and associate it with the Context Profile.
*   Policies are associated with the identity pool, allowing for granular access control within the managed directory service.

**Pseudocode (Access Engine):**

```
function evaluateAccess(user, resource, action):
  context = getContextProfile(user)
  policies = getPoliciesForResource(resource)

  for policy in policies:
    if policy.evaluate(context):
      return policy.action // ALLOW, DENY, MFA_CHALLENGE

  return DENY // Default deny if no policies match
```

**Innovation Points:**

*   Moves beyond static access control to a dynamic, context-aware model.
*   Enables more granular and adaptive security policies.
*   Supports a wide range of contextual data sources.
*   Integrates seamlessly with existing identity pools.
*   Provides a flexible and extensible policy language.
