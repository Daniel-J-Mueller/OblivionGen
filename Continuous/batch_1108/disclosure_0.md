## Dynamic Payload Sharding & Reassembly

**Concept:** Extend the embedded code functionality to not just *route* messages, but to *shard* the message payload itself across multiple recipients, requiring collaborative reassembly before full processing. This creates a new layer of security and potentially enables parallel processing of large datasets.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sharding Code Definition:**

*   Introduce a new code type: `SHARD_ID`. This code appears within the topic portion of a message.
*   `SHARD_ID` is followed by a unique identifier (e.g., UUID) and a total shard count (e.g., `SHARD_ID: a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-1234-567890abcdef : 5`).
*   Each message containing a `SHARD_ID` is automatically considered a shard.

**2. Message Processing Service Modification:**

*   **Shard Detection:** The message processing service must parse the topic for `SHARD_ID`.
*   **Recipient Mapping:** Maintain a registry of devices capable of handling shard reassembly. The registry includes criteria (e.g., security clearance, processing capacity).
*   **Shard Routing:**  When a shard is detected, the service *does not* publish it directly to the final recipient. Instead, it publishes it to a dedicated “reassembly queue” associated with the intended final recipient, tagged with the `SHARD_ID` and the total shard count.
*   **Reassembly Trigger:** The reassembly queue monitors for incoming shards with matching `SHARD_ID` and shard counts. Once *all* shards are received, the queue triggers the reassembly process.
*   **Reassembly Process:** The reassembly process concatenates the shard payloads in the correct order (determined by a sequence number embedded within each shard – e.g., `SHARD_SEQ: 1, SHARD_SEQ: 2`, etc.).
*   **Final Delivery:** The fully reassembled message is then delivered to the intended final recipient.
*   **Timeout & Error Handling:** Implement a timeout mechanism. If all shards are not received within a defined period, the process is flagged as failed, and an error message is sent to the originator.

**3.  Shard Creation Module (Originator Side):**

*   A module within the originating device to automatically shard large messages.
*   Configurable shard size.
*   Automatic generation of `SHARD_ID` and `SHARD_SEQ` for each shard.
*   Reliable message sending with acknowledgements for each shard.
*   Resend mechanism for failed shard transmissions.

**Pseudocode (Originating Device - Sharding):**

```
function shardMessage(message, shardSize, recipient):
  shardId = generateUUID()
  totalShards = ceil(message.length / shardSize)
  shards = []
  for i = 0 to totalShards - 1:
    start = i * shardSize
    end = min((i + 1) * shardSize, message.length)
    shardData = message.substring(start, end)
    shardTopic = recipientTopic + "/SHARD_ID:" + shardId + "/SHARD_SEQ:" + (i + 1) + "/TOTAL:" + totalShards
    publishMessage(shardTopic, shardData)
    shards.append((shardTopic, shardData))
  return shards
```

**Pseudocode (Message Processing Service - Reassembly):**

```
function handleIncomingMessage(topic, payload):
  if topic.contains("SHARD_ID"):
    shardId = extractShardId(topic)
    shardSeq = extractShardSequence(topic)
    totalShards = extractTotalShards(topic)
    storeShard(shardId, shardSeq, totalShards, payload)
    if allShardsReceived(shardId, totalShards):
      reassembledMessage = reassembleMessage(shardId)
      publishMessage(intendedRecipientTopic, reassembledMessage)
      clearShards(shardId)
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   Encryption of shard payloads.
*   Authentication and authorization of reassembly devices.
*   Tamper detection mechanisms.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Secure distribution of sensitive data.
*   Parallel processing of large datasets.
*   Resilient communication in unreliable networks.
*   Distributed computing tasks.
