## Wireless Entrance Communication Device - Adaptive Projection Interface

**Concept:** Expand the communication aspect beyond audio/visual to incorporate projected augmented reality elements onto the entryway itself. The device doesn't just *show* who is at the door, it dynamically alters the perceived environment around the door to provide context, security features, and customizable greetings.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Unit:** Houses the wireless communication module, processing unit, high-lumen micro-projector array, ambient light sensor, and a miniature LiDAR scanner. Unit mounts flush with the doorframe, or integrates into existing doorbell housing.
*   **Projection System:** Array of 4 micro-projectors capable of overlapping and calibrating to create a seamless projected image. Resolution: 1920x1080 minimum. Brightness: Adjustable up to 500 Lumens. Projection range: 1-3 meters. Automatic keystone correction and edge blending.
*   **LiDAR Scanner:** Provides a real-time depth map of the entryway. Used to accurately project onto surfaces, account for obstacles (e.g., packages, people), and create a sense of depth in the projected imagery. Range: 0.5 - 5 meters. Accuracy: +/- 5cm.
*   **Software Features:**
    *   **Dynamic Threshold Projection:** Projects a customizable "threshold" onto the entryway floor. This could be a simple line, a patterned design, or a visually striking effect.  Intended to subtly define the "safe zone" and discourage unwanted approaches.
    *   **Contextual Overlay:**  Utilizes visitor recognition (facial or object – delivery service uniforms) to project relevant information. Examples:
        *   "Delivery for John Smith" displayed above the package.
        *   Visitor’s name and last known location (if authorized) displayed as they approach.
        *   If the visitor is unknown, a prompt to "Request Verification Code" is projected.
    *   **Security Enhancement:**
        *   **Virtual Security Lines:** Project configurable lines that trigger an alert if crossed.
        *   **Motion-Activated "Spotlight" Effect:** Project a bright, moving beam of light in the direction of detected motion.
        *    **Projected Footprints:** Project simulated footprints leading *away* from the door if no one is there, creating a visual deterrent.
    *   **Customizable Greetings:** Allows users to upload images or animations to be projected as greetings. Examples:  animated welcome message, holiday-themed projections.
    *   **Adaptive Brightness/Contrast:** Ambient light sensor adjusts projection brightness and contrast for optimal visibility in all lighting conditions.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wi-Fi 6.  Integration with existing smart home ecosystems (e.g., Alexa, Google Home).  Secure end-to-end encryption.
*   **Power:**  AC adapter with battery backup (minimum 2-hour operation).

**Pseudocode (Threshold Projection Logic):**

```
FUNCTION createThreshold(userPreferences)
  // userPreferences contains:
  //  - thresholdType (e.g., "line", "pattern", "animated")
  //  - color
  //  - width/size
  //  - animationSpeed (if applicable)

  GET entrywayDepthMap FROM LiDAR

  IF entrywayDepthMap IS valid THEN
      DEFINE thresholdPoints BASED ON entrywayDepthMap AND userPreferences
      PROJECT thresholdPoints ONTO entrywayFloor USING micro-projectorArray
  ELSE
      DISPLAY error message "LiDAR sensor not functioning"
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Further Development:**

*   Integration with external databases for visitor identification (e.g., registered delivery services).
*   Advanced AI-powered analysis of visitor behavior to detect potential threats.
*   Holographic projection capabilities for more immersive visual effects (future iteration).
