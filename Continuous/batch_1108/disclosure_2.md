## Secure Data Sharding with Erasure Coding & Dynamic Key Rotation

**Concept:** Extend the encrypted data delivery concept by implementing data sharding with erasure coding *before* encryption, combined with a dynamic cryptographic key rotation schedule. This increases data resilience, improves security, and enables more granular access control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Preparation & Sharding Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream (any type).
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide the raw data into logical data blocks.
    *   Apply an erasure coding algorithm (e.g., Reed-Solomon) to create 'n' data shards and 'm' parity shards.  'n' and 'm' are configurable parameters dictating redundancy.
    *   Each shard is treated as an independent unit for encryption and transmission.
*   **Output:** Set of 'n+m' data shards.

**2. Key Management & Rotation Service:**

*   **Functionality:**  Generates, distributes, and rotates cryptographic keys.
*   **Key Types:** Symmetric keys (AES-256 preferred) per shard.
*   **Rotation Schedule:** Configurable â€“ daily, weekly, event-triggered (e.g., access attempts, data modification). 
*   **Key Distribution:** Secure key exchange protocol (e.g., Diffie-Hellman, TLS) with receiving systems.
*   **Metadata Storage:**  Store mapping of shard IDs to current encryption keys in a tamper-proof key store. 

**3. Encrypted Data Transmission Module:**

*   **Input:** Shards, current encryption keys (from Key Management), destination system identifier.
*   **Process:**
    *   Encrypt each shard using its corresponding key.
    *   Transmit encrypted shards to the destination system.
    *   Implement a lightweight acknowledgement protocol to ensure delivery.
*   **Output:** Stream of encrypted shards.

**4. Data Reconstruction Module (Destination System):**

*   **Input:** Received encrypted shards, current encryption keys, shard IDs.
*   **Process:**
    *   Decrypt shards using the correct keys.
    *   Apply the erasure decoding algorithm to reconstruct the original data.  The system must be able to reconstruct the data even if some shards are lost or corrupted, based on the 'n' and 'm' values.
*   **Output:** Reconstructed raw data.

**5. System Architecture:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Data Preparation Module
    *   Key Management Service
    *   Encrypted Data Transmission Module
    *   Data Reconstruction Module
*   **Communication:** Utilize a secure communication channel (TLS/SSL) for all inter-component communication.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle large data volumes and high throughput.  Consider a distributed architecture for scalability.

**Pseudocode (Data Reconstruction Module):**

```
FUNCTION reconstructData(encryptedShards, shardKeys, shardIDs, n, m):
  // n = number of data shards
  // m = number of parity shards

  // 1. Initialize an array to hold decrypted shards
  decryptedShards = new array[n+m]

  // 2. Iterate through encrypted shards
  FOR EACH shard IN encryptedShards:
    shardID = shard.shardID
    key = shardKeys[shardID]

    // 3. Decrypt shard using key
    decryptedShard = decrypt(shard, key)

    // 4. Store decrypted shard in array
    decryptedShards[shardID] = decryptedShard
  END FOR

  // 5. Perform erasure decoding
  reconstructedData = erasureDecode(decryptedShards, n, m)

  RETURN reconstructedData
END FUNCTION
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Integrity Verification:** Implement hash functions to verify the integrity of data shards before and after decryption.
*   **Access Control:** Integrate with an access control system to restrict access to specific data shards.
*   **Auditing:** Log all data access and modification events for auditing purposes.
*   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** Utilize HSMs to protect cryptographic keys.
