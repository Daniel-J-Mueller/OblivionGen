## Adaptive Resource Weighting via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the resource weighting system by incorporating real-time biofeedback from the user to dynamically adjust resource priorities. This creates a truly personalized and context-aware experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate compatibility with common wearable biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), EEG – potentially limited initial scope).  API for sensor data ingestion.
*   **Data Stream:** Continuous stream of raw biofeedback data.  Preprocessing to remove noise and artifacts.  Feature extraction – derive meaningful metrics (e.g., stress level, cognitive load, emotional state) from raw data.
*   **Data Security:**  Secure data transmission and storage compliant with privacy regulations. User control over data sharing and retention.

**2. Biofeedback-Driven Weight Adjustment:**

*   **Mapping Function:** Develop a mapping function that translates biofeedback metrics into adjustments to the resource weight matrix. This requires a training phase (see section 4).
*   **Resource Weight Modulation:** Real-time adjustment of resource weights based on the output of the mapping function.  Example: Increased stress levels detected via HRV might prioritize calming music playlists (increased weight) over news updates (decreased weight).  Cognitive load could influence the complexity of information presented.
*   **Granularity of Adjustment:**  Support both coarse-grained (domain-level) and fine-grained (individual resource-level) weight adjustments.

**3.  Contextual Awareness Integration:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Combine biofeedback data with other contextual data sources (time of day, location, activity level, calendar events).
*   **Contextual Rules Engine:**  Define rules that govern weight adjustments based on the combined contextual information.  Example: "If user is in a meeting (calendar event) and stress level is high (biofeedback), prioritize summarizing key information from the meeting transcript (resource)."

**4.  Personalized Training & Calibration:**

*   **Initial Calibration Phase:** A guided calibration process where the user provides feedback on the relevance of different resources under various conditions (simulated scenarios and real-world usage).
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ reinforcement learning to refine the mapping function and contextual rules over time, based on user interactions and explicit feedback.
*   **User Profiles:** Store personalized mapping functions and contextual rules within user profiles.

**5.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Modular Architecture:** Design a modular system that allows for easy integration of new biofeedback sensors and contextual data sources.
*   **API for External Applications:** Provide an API for external applications to access and control the biofeedback-driven resource weighting system.
*   **Pseudocode – Weight Adjustment:**

```
function adjust_weights(biofeedback_data, context_data, current_weights):
  # 1. Extract features from biofeedback_data
  features = extract_features(biofeedback_data)

  # 2. Determine context based on context_data
  context = determine_context(context_data)

  # 3. Apply mapping function to determine weight adjustments
  adjustments = mapping_function(features, context)

  # 4. Apply adjustments to current weights
  new_weights = current_weights + adjustments

  # 5. Normalize weights to ensure they sum to 1.0
  new_weights = normalize(new_weights)

  return new_weights
```

**6.  Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Stress Management:** Prioritize calming content during stressful situations.
*   **Focus Enhancement:** Reduce distractions during focused work.
*   **Personalized Learning:** Adjust the difficulty and presentation of learning materials based on cognitive load.
*   **Accessibility:** Adapt content presentation based on user’s emotional state and cognitive abilities.
