## Predictive Temporal Focus – System Specs

**Core Concept:** Augment the video request system with predictive analysis of potential events *before* they are requested, pre-buffering and flagging relevant footage for faster response times and proactive investigation. 

**System Components:**

1.  **Event Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Real-time data streams – weather, social media (local events/keywords), 911 call logs (anonymized/aggregated), public transportation schedules, known event calendars.
    *   Process: Machine learning models trained on historical incident data correlated with the input streams. Models predict likelihood of specific incident types (e.g., traffic accidents, protests, petty theft) within defined geographical areas.
    *   Output: Probability scores for incident types, time windows, and geographical areas.

2.  **Pre-Buffer Manager:**
    *   Input: Probability scores from Event Prediction Engine. Configurable sensitivity thresholds (e.g., trigger pre-buffering when probability of 'protest' exceeds 70%).
    *   Process: Dynamically adjusts pre-buffering parameters for each A/V device based on predicted risk. Increases buffer size, frame rate, and/or retention period. Focuses buffer on areas of high probability.
    *   Output: Instructions to A/V devices to modify buffering behavior.

3.  **Footage Prioritization Module:**
    *   Input: Incoming video streams, Event Prediction Engine output, request signals.
    *   Process: Assigns a ‘relevance score’ to each video segment based on event predictions. Segments matching predicted events are prioritized for indexing and fast retrieval.
    *   Output: Indexed video segments with relevance scores.

4.  **Automated 'Watch Zone' Creation:** 
    *   Input: Social media feeds, local news, and event calendars.
    *   Process: AI automatically creates temporary ‘watch zones’ around predicted events (parades, concerts, protests). Adjusts A/V device focus and buffer settings accordingly.
    *   Output: Dynamically adjusted watch zones and corresponding A/V settings.

**Workflow:**

1.  Event Prediction Engine continuously analyzes data streams and generates probability scores.
2.  Pre-Buffer Manager adjusts A/V device buffering based on predictions.
3.  Footage Prioritization Module indexes and prioritizes incoming video segments.
4.  When a request is received, the system first searches prioritized footage.
5.  If relevant footage is found, it's transmitted immediately.
6.  If no prioritized footage matches, the system reverts to standard search.
7.  Automated Watch Zone Creation dynamically adjusts A/V focus for predicted events.

**Pseudocode (Footage Prioritization Module):**

```
function prioritizeFootage(videoSegment, eventPredictions):
  relevanceScore = 0
  for each prediction in eventPredictions:
    if prediction.eventType matches videoSegment.tags:
      relevanceScore += prediction.probability * 100 

  //Add geographic scoring
  if videoSegment.location within prediction.area:
    relevanceScore += 50

  return relevanceScore
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge computing capabilities on A/V devices for real-time pre-buffering.
*   High-bandwidth network connectivity for fast data transmission.
*   Scalable server infrastructure for processing and indexing video data.
