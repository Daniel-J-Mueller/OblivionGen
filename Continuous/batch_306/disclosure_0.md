## Temporal Convolutional Network – Dynamic Activation Re-weighting

**Specification:**

**1. Overview:**

This design introduces a mechanism for dynamically re-weighting stored activations within a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) based on input-specific relevance scores. The aim is to improve efficiency and accuracy by selectively utilizing previously computed activations, rather than simply caching and retrieving them uniformly.  The core idea revolves around a 'Relevance Network' which operates in parallel to the TCN and dictates which stored activations are useful for the current input.

**2. Components:**

*   **TCN Core:** Standard TCN architecture with dilated convolutions and residual connections.
*   **Activation Cache:** Memory storage for previously computed activations, indexed by layer and input sequence position.
*   **Relevance Network:**  A small, fast neural network (e.g., a few fully connected layers or a lightweight convolutional network) that receives the current input and outputs a 'relevance score' for each cached activation.  The Relevance Network will be trained in conjunction with the TCN core.
*   **Weighted Summation Unit:**  A unit that combines cached activations with newly computed activations, weighted by the relevance scores provided by the Relevance Network.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Input Processing:** The current input sequence is fed into the TCN core.
2.  **Activation Storage:**  Activations at each layer are stored in the Activation Cache.
3.  **Relevance Score Calculation:** The Relevance Network receives the current input sequence and computes a relevance score for each cached activation. These scores represent the predicted contribution of each cached activation to the computation of the current output.
4.  **Weighted Activation Retrieval:** The Weighted Summation Unit retrieves cached activations. Each retrieved activation is multiplied by its corresponding relevance score.
5.  **Activation Combination:** The weighted cached activations are summed with the newly computed activations from the TCN core. This combined activation set is then passed to subsequent layers of the TCN.
6.  **Backpropagation:** During training, the Relevance Network is trained alongside the TCN core using backpropagation.  The loss function includes terms that incentivize the Relevance Network to assign high scores to activations that contribute to accurate predictions and low scores to irrelevant activations.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
# Input: input_sequence
# Output: output_sequence

# TCN Core Forward Pass
activations = TCN_Core(input_sequence)

# Relevance Network Forward Pass
relevance_scores = Relevance_Network(input_sequence) # Returns scores for each cached activation

# Retrieve Cached Activations
cached_activations = Activation_Cache.retrieve(relevance_scores)

# Weighted Summation
weighted_activations = []
for i in range(len(activations)):
    weighted_activation = activations[i] + cached_activations[i] * relevance_scores[i]
    weighted_activations.append(weighted_activation)

# Pass weighted activations through subsequent layers of TCN
output_sequence = TCN_Core(weighted_activations)

# Backpropagation – combined loss function
loss = calculate_prediction_loss(output_sequence) + calculate_relevance_regularization_loss(relevance_scores)
```

**5. Hardware Considerations:**

*   The Relevance Network must be computationally lightweight to minimize latency.
*   Efficient memory access patterns are crucial for the Activation Cache.  Consider using a dedicated memory controller optimized for streaming access.
*   The hardware architecture should support parallel computation of relevance scores and weighted summation.

**6. Training Considerations:**

*   A regularization term can be added to the loss function to prevent the Relevance Network from assigning excessively high scores to all activations.
*   The size of the Activation Cache should be carefully tuned to balance memory usage and performance.
*   Explore different training strategies, such as curriculum learning, to improve the convergence of the Relevance Network.
