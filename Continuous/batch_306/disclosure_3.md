## Temporal Data State Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the failure state return (FSR) functionality to not only return the current state of a failed data item but also reconstruct a limited temporal history of its state leading up to the failure. This allows for more granular debugging and auditing, particularly in scenarios involving complex, multi-step transactions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Storage:** Implement a lightweight, configurable time-series store alongside the primary database. This store will capture "delta" changes to specific data item attributes, rather than full snapshots. Configuration parameters will include:
    *   *Retention Period*: How far back to store state changes (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day).
    *   *Attribute Whitelist*: Which attributes of a data item are tracked for temporal history.
    *   *Change Threshold*: Only store changes exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., percentage difference) to reduce storage overhead.
*   **FSR Extension – Temporal Indicator:** Introduce a new flag within the request – a “Temporal Indicator.” When set, the FSR will not only include the current item state but also a reconstruction of its state at discrete time intervals prior to the failure.
*   **Reconstruction Algorithm:** Upon a failed condition and a set Temporal Indicator:
    1.  Query the time-series store for delta changes to the relevant attributes for the specified retention period.
    2.  Apply these deltas to a base state (either the initial state of the transaction or the current state before the failure) to reconstruct the item's state at various points in time.
    3.  Return the reconstructed states as part of the FSR, along with timestamps. The number of reconstructed states will be configurable (e.g., return states every 5 seconds).
*   **Transaction Handling:**
    *   Enable a flag at the transaction level to activate temporal tracking for all items involved in the transaction.
    *   The system will need to capture the initial state of any tracked attributes before the transaction begins.
*   **API Extension:** Add new parameters to the transaction request to control:
    *   *History Depth*: The number of historical states to return.
    *   *History Interval*: The time interval between historical states.
*   **Security:**
    *   Access to historical data will be governed by separate permissions, distinct from read/write permissions.
    *   Audit logging of all access to historical data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Request structure
TransactionRequest {
  operations: list<Operation>,
  conditions: list<Condition>,
  fsrIndicators: list<FSRIndicator>,
  temporalIndicator: boolean,
  historyDepth: integer,
  historyInterval: integer
}

// Operation structure
Operation {
  dataItem: string,
  attribute: string,
  condition: string
}

// FSR Indicator
FSRIndicator {
  dataItem: string,
  attribute: string,
  enabled: boolean
}

// Database System Function: ExecuteTransaction
ExecuteTransaction(TransactionRequest request) {
  // Begin Transaction
  transactionId = StartTransaction()

  // Capture initial states of tracked attributes
  initialStates = CaptureInitialStates(request.operations)

  // Execute Operations
  for each operation in request.operations {
    if (operation.condition Fails) {
      if (request.temporalIndicator is true AND request.fsrIndicators contains operation.dataItem) {
        historicalStates = RetrieveHistoricalStates(operation.dataItem, request.historyDepth, request.historyInterval)
        currentState = GetCurrentState(operation.dataItem)
        errorResponse = GenerateErrorResponse(operation.condition, currentState, historicalStates)
        RollbackTransaction(transactionId)
        Return errorResponse
      } else {
        RollbackTransaction(transactionId)
        Return StandardErrorResponse(operation.condition)
      }
    }
  }

  CommitTransaction(transactionId)
  Return SuccessResponse()
}
```
