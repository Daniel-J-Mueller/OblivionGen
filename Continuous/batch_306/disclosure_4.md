## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & ‘Ghosting’

**Concept:** Extend the notification queuing system to dynamically prioritize notifications *and* implement a ‘ghosting’ feature where stale notifications are intelligently masked or replaced with summarized ‘activity’ indicators rather than persisting indefinitely. This combats notification fatigue and improves user experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Notification Weighting Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw notification data (email, message, system events), User Profile (configurable preferences, usage patterns, contact lists), Contextual Data (time of day, location, device type, current app activity).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Assign initial weight to each notification based on source (e.g., direct message > system update).
    *   Modify weight based on User Profile:
        *   Contacts/Groups: Higher weight for messages from prioritized contacts.
        *   Keywords: Boost weight for notifications containing specified keywords.
        *   Time-based rules: Reduce weight during ‘do not disturb’ hours.
    *   Contextual adjustment: Reduce weight if user is actively engaged in another application.
*   **Output:** Weighted notification score.

**2. Dynamic Queue Management:**

*   **Data Structure:** Priority Queue (e.g., Heap) sorted by weighted notification score.
*   **Queue Limits:** Configurable maximum queue size per user.
*   **Aging Factor:** Decay notification weight over time. Older notifications receive progressively lower priority.  Configurable decay rate.
*   **Ghosting Threshold:**  When a notification's weight falls below a threshold, it enters a 'ghosted' state.

**3. Ghosting Implementation:**

*   **Ghosted Notification Replacement:** Instead of displaying the full notification, replace it with:
    *   **Activity Indicator:** A generic icon indicating new, but unread, activity (e.g., a dot on the app icon, a summary count).
    *   **Summarized View:** Display a brief summary of the ghosted notifications (e.g., "3 new messages from coworkers").
*   **User Interaction:** Tapping the activity indicator or summary view reveals the full queue of ghosted notifications.
*   **Ghosting Configuration:** Allow users to customize ghosting behavior:
    *   Time before ghosting (e.g., 30 minutes, 1 hour).
    *   Ghosting granularity (e.g., ghost individual notifications, group by sender/topic).

**Pseudocode (Queue Management):**

```
// Notification Class: {id, sender, content, timestamp, weight}

function processNotification(notification):
  notification.weight = calculateWeight(notification)
  insertNotificationIntoPriorityQueue(notification)

function calculateWeight(notification):
  baseWeight = getBaseWeight(notification.sender)
  userProfileWeight = getUserProfileWeight(notification.sender, notification.content)
  contextualWeight = getContextualWeight()
  return baseWeight + userProfileWeight + contextualWeight

function insertNotificationIntoPriorityQueue(notification):
  priorityQueue.insert(notification)
  if priorityQueue.size() > maxQueueSize:
    // Identify and ghost lowest weight notifications until queue is within limits
    while (priorityQueue.size() > maxQueueSize):
      lowestWeightNotification = priorityQueue.peekMin()
      if (lowestWeightNotification.timestamp + ghostingThreshold < currentTime):
          ghostNotification(lowestWeightNotification)
          priorityQueue.removeMin()
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability: The weighting and queue management modules must be highly scalable to handle a large number of users and notifications.
*   Real-time Processing:  Notification processing should be as close to real-time as possible.
*   User Privacy:  Weighting calculations must respect user privacy preferences.
*   API Integration: Seamless integration with existing notification infrastructure.
