## Dynamic Skill-Based Task Decomposition & Auction System

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of distributing tasks to humans, but introduce a real-time, dynamic skill assessment & auction system. Instead of pre-defined subtasks, the system *creates* subtasks on-the-fly based on the overall task goal and auctions them to humans whose demonstrated skills best match the immediate need.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Task Decomposition Engine:**

   *   **Input:** A complex task (e.g., analyze a satellite image for anomalies, transcribe a difficult audio recording).
   *   **Process:**  The engine uses AI to recursively break down the task into granular ‘skill-units’. These aren't pre-defined; the decomposition *adapts* based on available human skills (see Section 2).  For example:
        *   Original Task: "Identify potential wildfires in satellite imagery."
        *   Skill-Units (example, dynamic): “Identify vegetation density in 10x10 pixel blocks”, “Detect thermal signatures in infrared bands”, “Filter cloud cover”, “Cross-reference with weather data”.
   *   **Output:** A directed acyclic graph (DAG) of skill-units, representing the task breakdown.  Dependencies between skill-units are explicitly defined.

**2. Real-Time Skill Assessment & Profile System:**

   *   **Data Sources:**
        *   Past performance data on the platform (accuracy, speed, consistency).
        *   Short ‘calibration tests’ presented to users periodically (adaptive difficulty).  These aren't full tasks, but focused skill assessments.
        *   User-provided skill declarations (validated through performance).
   *   **Skill Vector:** Each user is represented by a skill vector, quantifying their proficiency in various skill-units. This vector is constantly updated.
   *   **Skill Decay:** Skills decay over time if not actively used, encouraging continuous engagement.
   *   **Skill ‘Tags’:**  Skill-units are tagged with metadata (required tools, data formats, estimated time, difficulty).

**3. Dynamic Auction System:**

   *   **Auction Trigger:** When a skill-unit becomes available (i.e., its dependencies are met), an auction is initiated.
   *   **Bidding Criteria:** Humans bid based on:
        *   **Estimated Time:**  How long they predict it will take to complete the skill-unit.
        *   **Price:**  Their desired payment.
        *   **Confidence Level:**  A self-reported estimate of their accuracy (influences weighting).
   *   **Auction Algorithm:** A weighted auction algorithm selects the best bidder, considering:
        *   Skill Vector Match:  How well the bidder’s skills align with the skill-unit’s requirements.
        *   Price & Time:  Cost-effectiveness.
        *   Confidence Level:  Risk mitigation.
   *   **Micro-Auctions:**  For critical skill-units, multiple humans perform the same unit, and results are aggregated (majority voting, averaging) for increased accuracy.

**4. Adaptive Workflow Management:**

   *   **Dynamic Re-Decomposition:** If a human consistently fails a skill-unit, the system automatically re-decomposes it into simpler sub-units or assigns it to a different human.
   *   **Workflow Optimization:** The system learns from past performance to optimize the workflow, assigning skill-units to the most efficient humans and minimizing overall task completion time.

**5.  API & Integration:**

   *   REST API for integrating with external task sources (e.g., satellite image feeds, audio recording services).
   *   Webhooks for real-time task status updates.

**Pseudocode (Auction Algorithm):**

```
function select_bidder(skill_unit, bidders):
  skill_match_scores = []
  for bidder in bidders:
    skill_match_score = dot_product(skill_unit.required_skills, bidder.skill_vector)
    skill_match_scores.append(skill_match_score)

  weighted_scores = []
  for i in range(len(bidders)):
    bidder = bidders[i]
    weighted_score = (skill_match_scores[i] * WEIGHT_SKILL_MATCH) + \
                     (1 / bidder.estimated_time * WEIGHT_SPEED) + \
                     (bidder.confidence_level * WEIGHT_CONFIDENCE) - \
                     (bidder.price * WEIGHT_PRICE)

    weighted_scores.append(weighted_scores)

  best_bidder_index = argmax(weighted_scores)
  return bidders[best_bidder_index]
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static task decomposition and pre-defined subtasks. It’s a dynamic, adaptive workflow that leverages real-time skill assessment and a micro-auction system to optimize task completion speed, accuracy, and cost. It is not simply about *distributing* work, but about *creating* work that best utilizes available human intelligence.
