## Interactive Document ‘Pre-Fetch’ Based on Predicted User Gaze

**Concept:** Expand upon the ‘blocking data’ concept by proactively fetching content *before* it’s requested, based on predicted user gaze and interaction patterns within the interactive document. This moves beyond simply responding to missing data and aims to eliminate latency *before* it’s perceived.

**Specs:**

*   **Gaze Tracking Integration:** System incorporates gaze tracking (eye-tracking hardware/software or inferred from mouse/touch movements) to determine areas of the interactive document the user is *likely* to view in the near future (e.g., next 1-2 seconds).  This data informs the pre-fetch queue.
*   **Interaction Prediction Module:** A machine learning module analyzes user interaction patterns (scroll speed, click frequency, dwell time on elements) to predict future content requests. This complements gaze tracking.
*   **Content Granularity:**  Interactive documents are broken down into ‘visual tiles’ or chunks. These tiles are the units of pre-fetching.  Tile size dynamically adjusts based on content type (larger for images/video, smaller for text).
*   **Priority Assignment:** Each tile receives a priority score based on:
    *   Predicted gaze/interaction probability (highest weight)
    *   Content type (video/high-resolution images receive higher priority)
    *   File size (larger files may be pre-fetched with lower priority if bandwidth is constrained)
    *   Position within the document (content near the current viewport is prioritized).
*   **Pre-Fetch Queue:** A queue manages pre-fetch requests. The queue prioritizes tiles based on the priority score.
*   **Bandwidth Management:**  System monitors available bandwidth and adjusts the pre-fetch rate accordingly. A ‘bandwidth throttle’ prevents excessive bandwidth consumption.  Lower-priority tiles are skipped if bandwidth is limited.
*   **Client-Side Cache:** Pre-fetched tiles are stored in a client-side cache (browser cache, dedicated application cache).  When the user scrolls/interacts, content is served from the cache instead of requesting it from the server.
*   **Blocking Data Integration:**  Existing ‘blocking data’ mechanism is retained. If a pre-fetched tile requires missing data, the system utilizes the existing process to request it.
*   **Server-Side Component:** Server component provides the content tiles and supports pre-fetch requests. It can also provide metadata about each tile (file size, content type, dependencies).
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The prediction module learns from user behavior and adjusts its predictions over time. It identifies frequently accessed content and prioritizes pre-fetching those tiles.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
initializeGazeTracker()
initializePredictionModule()
createPreFetchQueue()

// Main Loop
while (documentIsActive) {
    gazeData = getGazeData()
    interactionData = getInteractionData()

    predictedTiles = predictionModule.predictNextTiles(gazeData, interactionData)

    for each tile in predictedTiles {
        if (tile not in cache) {
            tilePriority = calculateTilePriority(tile)
            preFetchQueue.enqueue(tile, tilePriority)
        }
    }

    // Process pre-fetch queue
    while (preFetchQueue not empty and bandwidthAvailable) {
        tile, priority = preFetchQueue.dequeue()
        requestTileFromServer(tile) //Handles blocking data
        storeTileInCache(tile)
    }

    //Serve from Cache:
    if (userInteractionRequiresContent()){
        content = getFromCache()
        if (content == null){
            //Standard Request Mechanism
        }
    }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved user experience.
*   Proactive content delivery eliminates perceived delays.
*   Adaptive learning optimizes pre-fetching for individual users.
*   Efficient bandwidth utilization.
