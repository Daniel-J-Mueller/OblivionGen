## Dynamic Garment Simulation & Personalization

**Concept:** A system for real-time garment simulation integrated with a body scanning and personalization engine. This goes beyond static image alignment to create a dynamically updating, interactive virtual dressing room experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-spectral body scan (depth, RGB, thermal data). User-defined garment parameters (style, fabric, color, fit preferences). Real-time motion capture (IMU sensors, camera-based tracking).
*   **Body Model:** High-resolution, deformable mesh representing the user’s body.  Mesh density adaptable based on processing power. Thermal data informs localized skin deformation for realistic draping.
*   **Garment Model:** Procedural garment generation engine. Garments are not pre-modeled but created from parameters: base mesh, weave/knit pattern, material properties (stretch, weight, friction, opacity), seam definitions.
*   **Physics Engine:** Advanced cloth simulation incorporating:
    *   Finite Element Method (FEM) for accurate deformation.
    *   Air resistance, self-collision detection, and friction modeling.
    *   Localized muscle simulation influencing garment drape around joints.
*   **Rendering Pipeline:** Physically Based Rendering (PBR) with:
    *   Subsurface scattering for realistic fabric appearance.
    *   Dynamic shadowing and lighting.
    *   Real-time global illumination.
*   **Personalization Engine:** AI-driven recommendation system suggesting garments based on:
    *   Body shape and size.
    *   User style preferences.
    *   Trending fashion.
*   **Output:**  Real-time, interactive 3D rendering of the user wearing the simulated garment on a display.  Augmented Reality (AR) overlay for visualization on a live video feed of the user.

**Pseudocode – Dynamic Garment Simulation:**

```
//Initialization
BodyModel = ScanUserBody()
GarmentParameters = UserDefineGarment()

// Main Loop
while (UserIsInteracting) {
    BodyPose = CaptureBodyPose()
    GarmentMesh = GenerateGarmentMesh(GarmentParameters)

    //Physics Simulation
    ClothSimulation(BodyPose, GarmentMesh) // Apply physics to garment mesh

    //Rendering
    Render(BodyPose, GarmentMesh)

    UpdateDisplay()

}

//Functions
ScanUserBody(): Captures body scan data (depth, RGB, thermal)
UserDefineGarment(): Receives garment style, fabric, color, fit preferences
CaptureBodyPose(): Tracks body movement using IMUs/cameras
GenerateGarmentMesh(): Creates a dynamic garment mesh based on parameters
ClothSimulation(): Applies physics engine for realistic draping and movement
Render(): Renders the 3D scene
UpdateDisplay(): Updates the display with the rendered output
```

**Innovation Focus:** Beyond static alignment, this system *simulates* garment behavior, responding to the user’s movement and body shape in real-time. The procedural garment generation offers extreme customization and scalability.  The thermal data input allows for more realistic draping around body contours and potentially simulates garment breathability/temperature effects. The personalization engine learns user preferences to suggest garments tailored to their individual style and body type.  This creates a truly immersive and personalized virtual dressing experience.
