## Autonomous Swarm Negotiation & Task Allocation

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Each UAV equipped with:
    *   High-bandwidth, short-range communication module (e.g., UWB, 802.11ad) – Range: 500m.
    *   Directional microphone array.
    *   Speaker.
    *   Onboard processing unit capable of running localized negotiation algorithms.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Negotiation Protocol:** A localized, real-time negotiation protocol (described below).
    *   **Task Library:** Pre-defined set of tasks with associated resource costs (time, energy, payload capacity).
    *   **Trust Metric:** Dynamic trust score for each neighboring UAV, updated based on successful/failed task completion and communication integrity.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Algorithm to handle task collisions and resource contention.

**Innovation Description:**

This system builds on the idea of UAVs adjusting tasks based on untrusted data, but *proactively* introduces a negotiation system between UAVs *before* task reliance, creating a dynamic task allocation based on capability and trust.  Instead of simply reacting to untrustworthiness, UAVs engage in localized 'bidding' for tasks, revealing capabilities and establishing trust *before* committing to a coordinated action. 

**Negotiation Protocol:**

1.  **Task Announcement:** A UAV with a new task broadcasts a "Task Request" containing:
    *   Task ID
    *   Task Description
    *   Reward (e.g., energy savings, faster completion, access to data)
    *   Deadline
2.  **Bid Submission:** Neighboring UAVs respond with "Bids" containing:
    *   UAV ID
    *   Estimated Completion Time
    *   Resource Requirements (energy, payload)
    *   Trust Level (self-reported, verifiable through prior interactions)
    *   “Commitment Score” – a confidence level in ability to complete the task
3.  **Auction/Negotiation Phase:**
    *   The initiating UAV evaluates bids based on:
        *   Estimated Completion Time (lowest preferred)
        *   Resource Requirements (lowest preferred)
        *   Commitment Score (highest preferred)
        *   Trust Level (highest preferred)
    *   Multiple rounds of bidding can occur, with UAVs adjusting their bids based on competitor offers.
4.  **Task Assignment:** The initiating UAV assigns the task to the most suitable bidder.
5.  **Execution & Trust Update:** Upon task completion, the initiating UAV verifies the outcome and updates the trust score of the performing UAV.  Failure to complete the task results in a significant trust penalty.

**Pseudocode (simplified bid evaluation):**

```
function evaluateBid(bid):
  score = 0
  score += (1/bid.estimatedCompletionTime) * 0.4 // Completion Time Weight
  score += (1/bid.resourceRequirements) * 0.2 // Resource Efficiency
  score += bid.trustLevel * 0.3 // Trust Weight
  score += bid.commitmentScore * 0.1 // Commitment
  return score
```

**Novelty:**

This system differs from the provided patent by actively *creating* a collaborative environment where trust is established *before* task dependence. The patent reacts to untrustworthiness; this system *prevents* reliance on untrustworthy actors. It moves beyond simple message verification to a dynamic negotiation that optimizes task allocation based on capability, trust, and resource efficiency. This approach could allow swarms to operate more reliably and efficiently in contested or uncertain environments.
