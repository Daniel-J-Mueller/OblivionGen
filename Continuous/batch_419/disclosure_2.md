## Dynamic Annotation Layers & Reader Personalization

**Concept:** Extend the positional mapping concept to allow *layers* of annotations, not just a single set, and tie those layers to user profiles/reading preferences, facilitating deeply personalized reading experiences.

**Specification:**

**1. Annotation Layer Architecture:**

*   Each electronic book instance will support multiple annotation layers. Layers are identified by a unique ID and a descriptive name (e.g., "Character Analysis," "Historical Context," "Grammatical Notes," "Personal Reflections”).
*   Annotations are not directly linked to the book’s text, but to the *layer* they reside in, coupled with a positional indicator (character/word offset, as in the base patent).
*   Each layer has associated metadata: creator (user ID), creation date, visibility (private, shared, public), layer type (e.g., commentary, question, fact check), and a relevance score (defined by the creator or algorithmically).

**2. User Profiles & Layer Subscriptions:**

*   User profiles store preferred annotation layer subscriptions. A user can subscribe to layers created by other users, or create their own layers.
*   Subscription includes a 'blend' weight - defining how much of a subscribed layer's annotations are displayed when reading.
*   User profiles also store reading preferences – reading speed, preferred font sizes, color schemes, and ‘focus mode’ settings which determine how aggressively annotations are displayed.

**3. Dynamic Rendering Engine:**

*   The reader application will have a rendering engine capable of dynamically assembling a composite view of the book’s text, incorporating annotations from subscribed layers.
*   Rendering sequence:
    1.  Load base text of the book.
    2.  Retrieve subscribed layer data for the current reading position.
    3.  Apply blend weights to subscribed layers.
    4.  Filter annotations based on user focus mode settings (e.g., hide all but critical fact checks).
    5.  Render annotations alongside the text, respecting user font sizes and color schemes.
*   Rendering can be triggered on-demand (as the user scrolls), or pre-rendered in the background to improve responsiveness.

**4.  Positional Map Extension:**

*   The positional map will be augmented to include layer IDs.  This allows for precise mapping of annotations across different versions of the book, even if the annotation content changes.
*   Map entries: `{version: 1, position: 123, layer_id: "analysis_123"}`

**5.  API Endpoints:**

*   `/layers/create`: Creates a new annotation layer.
*   `/layers/{layer_id}/annotations/add`: Adds an annotation to a layer.
*   `/layers/{layer_id}/annotations/get`: Retrieves annotations for a layer within a specific position range.
*   `/users/{user_id}/layers/subscribe`: Subscribes a user to a layer.
*   `/users/{user_id}/layers/unsubscribe`: Unsubscribes a user from a layer.

**Pseudocode (Rendering Engine):**

```
function renderBook(bookText, userProfile, currentPosition):
  subscribedLayers = getUserSubscribedLayers(userProfile)
  layerAnnotations = []
  for layer in subscribedLayers:
    annotations = getLayerAnnotations(layer, currentPosition)
    layerAnnotations.append(annotations)

  compositeAnnotations = combineAnnotations(layerAnnotations, userProfile.blendWeights)
  filteredAnnotations = filterAnnotations(compositeAnnotations, userProfile.focusMode)

  renderedText = displayBookText(bookText)
  displayAnnotations(renderedText, filteredAnnotations)

  return renderedText
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   AI-driven layer creation – automatically generate layers based on book content (e.g., character summaries, theme analysis).
*   Collaborative layer editing – allow multiple users to contribute to a shared layer.
*   Layer marketplaces – enable users to buy and sell high-quality annotation layers.
*   Integrate with external knowledge bases – automatically enrich annotations with relevant information from the web.
