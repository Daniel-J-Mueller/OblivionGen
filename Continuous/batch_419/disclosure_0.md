## Dynamic Authentication Context via Biometric Drift Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the authentication scheme to incorporate continuous biometric data drift analysis, allowing for dynamic adjustment of authentication context and risk assessment *without* requiring repeated explicit re-authentication. This builds on the QR code transfer of authentication identifiers, but moves beyond static association.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard smartphone camera (existing).
*   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) sensor integration (smartphone or wearable accessory - compatible API access required).
*   Microphone access for voice stress analysis (optional, for enhanced biometric profile).

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Biometric Drift Monitor:**  A background service constantly monitoring HRV data (and optionally voice stress) from the user.  This service calculates a ‘biometric baseline’ during initial authentication and continuously compares current data to that baseline.  Deviation exceeding a pre-defined threshold triggers a risk score increase.
*   **Authentication Context Manager:** This component manages the ‘authentication context’ – a dynamic collection of risk scores derived from biometric drift, device posture (motion, location), network environment, and initial authentication parameters.  It’s responsible for escalating or relaxing authentication requirements.
*   **Dynamic Access Control Module:** Modifies access privileges based on the Authentication Context Manager’s assessment. For example, increasing MFA requirements, limiting resource access, or triggering a full re-authentication.
*   **QR Code Enhancement:** The QR code generated by the first device now includes a cryptographic timestamp *and* a seeded random value.  The second device uses this seed in its biometric baseline calculation, establishing a shared temporal context.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Authentication:**  First device authenticates with the service, establishes a biometric baseline (HRV, voice), and generates a QR code containing the authentication identifier, timestamp, and seed.
2.  **QR Code Transfer:** Second device scans the QR code.
3.  **Baseline Synchronization:** Second device utilizes the seed and timestamp to construct its own biometric baseline, aligning it with the initial authentication event.
4.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Both devices’ Biometric Drift Monitors continuously track deviations from their respective baselines.
5.  **Contextual Risk Assessment:**  The Authentication Context Manager combines biometric drift data with other factors (location, network) to generate a dynamic risk score.
6.  **Dynamic Access Control:** Access privileges are adjusted in real-time based on the risk score. A significant deviation from the baseline (indicating stress, impersonation attempt, or device compromise) triggers increased security measures.
7.  **Adaptive Re-Authentication:**  Instead of strict time-based re-authentication, the system dynamically requests re-authentication only when the risk score exceeds a critical threshold.

**4. Pseudocode (Biometric Drift Monitor - Simplified):**

```
function calculate_drift(current_hrv, baseline_hrv):
  drift = abs(current_hrv - baseline_hrv) / baseline_hrv  # Percentage drift
  return drift

function update_risk_score(drift, risk_score):
  if drift > DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
    risk_score += DRIFT_INCREMENT
  return risk_score

#Main Loop
while (running):
  current_hrv = get_hrv_data()
  drift = calculate_drift(current_hrv, baseline_hrv)
  risk_score = update_risk_score(drift, risk_score)

  send_risk_score(risk_score)  # to Authentication Context Manager
  sleep(1) # Sample every second
```

**5. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:**  Continuous monitoring detects anomalies indicative of compromise or impersonation.
*   **Improved User Experience:** Adaptive authentication reduces friction by minimizing unnecessary re-authentication requests.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Risk assessment considers a broader range of factors beyond simple credentials.
*   **Proactive Threat Detection:** Anomalies are flagged in real-time, enabling faster response to potential threats.
