## Adaptive Communication Prioritization System

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of pre-fetching communication tokens but extends it to actively prioritize communication requests based on predicted user intent and network conditions. It’s not just about *having* a token, but about *knowing* which communication channel the user *needs* right now.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Intent Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on user communication history (time of day, contacts, message content, app usage). This engine predicts the most likely communication *type* (voice, video, text, data transfer) and *channel* (native app, SMS, email, third-party service) for upcoming requests.

2.  **Dynamic Token Pool:** Instead of pre-fetching a single token for a potentially outdated channel, the system maintains a dynamic pool of tokens for *multiple* communication channels.  These tokens have varying expiration times based on predicted usage frequency.  Less frequently used channels have tokens refreshed less often.

3.  **Network Condition Monitor:** Continuously monitors network quality (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) for each available communication channel.

4.  **Prioritization Algorithm:** This is the core decision-making component. It uses the Intent Prediction Engine's output, the Network Condition Monitor's data, and the Dynamic Token Pool’s status to prioritize communication requests.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Incoming Request:** A user initiates a communication request (e.g., starts a video call).

2.  **Intent Prediction:** The Intent Prediction Engine analyzes the request and predicts the optimal communication channel (e.g., "High probability of video call via native app").

3.  **Token Check:** The system checks the Dynamic Token Pool for a valid token for the predicted channel.
    *   If a valid token exists, the request proceeds immediately.
    *   If no valid token exists, *or* the token is nearing expiration, a token refresh request is sent *in the background*. This happens *before* any user-facing delays.

4.  **Network Evaluation:** The Network Condition Monitor assesses the quality of the predicted channel.
    *   If the channel is poor, the Prioritization Algorithm may *temporarily* switch to a different channel with a valid token (e.g., switch from video to voice).

5.  **Prioritization & Queueing:** If multiple requests are pending, the Prioritization Algorithm ranks them based on predicted user intent and network conditions. High-priority requests (e.g., emergency calls) are processed immediately.  Lower-priority requests are queued.

**Pseudocode (Prioritization Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION PrioritizeRequest(request, intent_prediction, network_conditions, token_pool)

  channel = intent_prediction.predicted_channel
  token = token_pool.get_token(channel)

  IF token is NULL OR token.isExpired() THEN
    //Background refresh token
    refreshToken(channel)
    token = token_pool.get_token(channel)
    IF token is NULL THEN
      //Channel unavailable
      RETURN "Channel Unavailable"
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

  IF network_conditions.quality(channel) < threshold THEN
    //Attempt alternate channel
    alternate_channel = find_alternate_channel(token_pool)
    IF alternate_channel != NULL THEN
      channel = alternate_channel
      token = token_pool.get_token(channel)
    ELSE
      //No alternate channel available
      RETURN "Poor Network Conditions"
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

  request.channel = channel
  request.token = token
  request.priority = intent_prediction.priority
  AddRequestToQueue(request)
  RETURN "Request Queued"

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION refreshToken(channel)
  SendTokenRequest(channel)
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Standard mobile device processor
*   Sufficient RAM to accommodate ML model & token cache
*   Reliable network connectivity

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple token pre-fetching to a dynamic, predictive approach that actively prioritizes communication requests based on user intent and network conditions. It anticipates needs and proactively prepares communication channels, minimizing delays and improving the user experience. It also intelligently adapts to network conditions, switching to alternative channels when necessary.
