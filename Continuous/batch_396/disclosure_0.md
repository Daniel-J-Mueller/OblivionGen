## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Customer Behavior

**Concept:** Expand the token bucket system to proactively allocate resources based on *predicted* customer usage patterns, rather than solely reacting to current requests. This creates a “shadow bucket” system coupled with predictive AI.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Historical usage data for each customer (token consumption, request frequency, resource types). Real-time signals (time of day, day of week, event triggers – e.g., marketing campaigns, seasonal trends). External data feeds (e.g., news events that might impact usage).
    *   **Model:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. This will allow the engine to learn temporal dependencies in usage patterns. Alternatively, a Transformer-based model could be used for potentially better performance with longer sequences.
    *   **Output:** Predicted token consumption rate for each customer over a short horizon (e.g., next 5-15 minutes). Probability distribution of likely usage scenarios (e.g., high, medium, low, spike).

*   **Component 2: Shadow Bucket System:**
    *   **Structure:** Each customer has a “shadow bucket” alongside their existing token bucket. The shadow bucket represents *predicted* future token consumption.
    *   **Pre-Allocation:** Based on the predictive engine’s output, the system *proactively* reserves resources (tokens) in the shadow bucket. This reservation doesn't immediately deduct from the available resource pool but creates a 'soft reservation'.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The predictive engine continuously updates the shadow bucket based on incoming usage data and revised predictions. If the actual usage deviates significantly from the prediction, the shadow bucket is adjusted accordingly (tokens returned to the pool or additional tokens reserved).

*   **Component 3: Resource Allocation Logic:**
    *   **Prioritization:** When a request arrives, the system first checks the shadow bucket.
    *   **Scenario 1: Sufficient Shadow Tokens:** If the shadow bucket has enough tokens to cover the request, the request is immediately granted, and tokens are deducted from *both* the shadow bucket and the customer’s standard token bucket. This ensures a smooth experience for predictable usage.
    *   **Scenario 2: Insufficient Shadow Tokens:** If the shadow bucket is insufficient, the system falls back to the existing token bucket system. However, the predictive engine is alerted to the deviation, and the shadow bucket is updated with a higher prediction for similar future requests. A "resource contention" flag may be raised for this customer if sustained.
    *   **Scenario 3: Overestimation:** If the request uses *fewer* tokens than predicted in the shadow bucket, the unused tokens are returned to the shared resource pool *immediately*.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Logic):**

```
function allocate_resource(customer_id, request_tokens):
  shadow_tokens = get_shadow_tokens(customer_id)
  
  if shadow_tokens >= request_tokens:
    deduct_tokens(customer_id, request_tokens, "shadow_bucket")
    deduct_tokens(customer_id, request_tokens, "standard_bucket")
    return SUCCESS
  else:
    # Fallback to standard bucket
    if standard_bucket_has_tokens(customer_id, request_tokens):
      deduct_tokens(customer_id, request_tokens, "standard_bucket")
      update_shadow_bucket(customer_id, request_tokens) # Increase future prediction
      return SUCCESS
    else:
      return FAILURE # Resource unavailable
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Resource Allocation:** Shifts from reactive throttling to proactive allocation, potentially reducing latency and improving user experience.
*   **Predictive AI Integration:** Leverages machine learning to anticipate customer needs, enabling optimized resource utilization.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously adapts to changing usage patterns, ensuring accurate predictions and efficient allocation.
*   **Shadow Bucket System:** Enables a flexible mechanism for soft reservations and dynamic adjustment of resource allocations.
