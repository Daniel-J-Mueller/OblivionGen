## Personalized Fragment Prediction via Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of dynamically adjusting estimated bandwidth by introducing a predictive buffering system. Instead of reacting *to* bandwidth fluctuations (as the patent seems to do), proactively *predict* future bandwidth needs and pre-buffer fragments accordingly, tailoring the pre-buffered fragments to predicted user preferences.

**Specs:**

**1. Preference Profile Construction:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Explicit User Ratings (likes/dislikes, star ratings).
    *   Implicit Viewing Data (watch time, rewatches, skips, pauses – fragment-level granularity).
    *   Content Metadata (genre, actors, director, keywords, scene type - action, dialogue, etc.).
    *   Device Capabilities (screen resolution, processing power, network interface).
    *   Time of Day/Location (impacts network conditions).
*   **Model:** Utilize a collaborative filtering or content-based recommendation system. Output:  A ranked list of preferred content *types* (e.g., "fast-paced action scenes," "dialogue-heavy dramas," "music videos") with associated probabilities. This is a *dynamic* profile, constantly updated.

**2. Predictive Bandwidth Estimation:**

*   **Historical Data:** Track bandwidth usage per content type (identified by metadata) for each user.  Calculate average bandwidth requirements for each type.
*   **Real-time Analysis:** Monitor current network conditions (latency, packet loss) using standard network probing techniques.
*   **Preference-Weighted Prediction:** Combine historical bandwidth data with real-time network conditions *and* the user's preference profile.
    *   `Predicted Bandwidth = Σ (Preference Probability(Content Type) * Average Bandwidth(Content Type)) + Network Adjustment Factor`
    *   The `Network Adjustment Factor` compensates for current network conditions – higher latency/packet loss increases the factor.

**3. Proactive Fragment Pre-fetching and Buffering:**

*   **Fragment Categorization:**  Content is pre-segmented into fragments. Each fragment is tagged with metadata describing its content type (e.g., "action," "dialogue," "music").
*   **Pre-fetch Queue:** Maintain a queue of fragments to pre-fetch.
*   **Selection Criteria:**
    *   **Predicted Preference:** Select fragments matching the user's predicted preferences (highest probability).
    *   **Bandwidth Availability:** Fetch fragments based on the predicted bandwidth.  Lower bandwidth = lower bitrate fragments.
    *   **Buffer Management:** Prioritize fetching fragments that will fill the buffer before playback stalls. Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) or similar cache eviction policy.
*   **Bitrate Adaptation:** Fetch multiple versions (bitrates) of each fragment. Select the bitrate based on the predicted bandwidth and device capabilities.
*   **Pre-buffer Duration:**  Dynamically adjust the pre-buffer duration based on predicted preference volatility (how quickly preferences might change) and network stability.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side Module:**  Responsible for preference profile construction, preference prediction, network monitoring, and buffer management.
*   **Server-Side Module:** Responsible for content segmentation, metadata tagging, bitrate adaptation, and fragment delivery.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Utilize a standard streaming protocol (e.g., DASH, HLS) with extensions for preference information and bitrate requests.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Module):**

```
Initialize:
    PreferenceProfile = Empty
    NetworkMonitor = New NetworkMonitor()
    BufferManager = New BufferManager()

Loop:
    Update PreferenceProfile (based on viewing history & ratings)
    NetworkConditions = NetworkMonitor.GetConditions()
    PredictedBandwidth = CalculatePredictedBandwidth(PreferenceProfile, NetworkConditions)
    NextFragments = SelectNextFragments(PredictedBandwidth, BufferManager.GetAvailableSpace())
    RequestFragmentsFromServer(NextFragments)
    BufferManager.AddFragments(ReceivedFragments)
```

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond *reactive* bandwidth adjustment to *proactive* content pre-fetching based on predicted user preferences. The dynamic preference profile and predictive bandwidth estimation create a personalized streaming experience that anticipates the user’s needs and optimizes buffer management. This differs from the patent’s focus on adjusting *after* detecting bandwidth issues.
