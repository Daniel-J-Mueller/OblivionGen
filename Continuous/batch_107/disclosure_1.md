## Dynamic Predictive Occlusion Mapping for Human Presence

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:**

Instead of solely relying on keypoint confidence scores to suppress false positives, implement a dynamic occlusion mapping system that *predicts* likely occlusion events *before* they fully manifest, adjusting confidence thresholds accordingly. This is especially valuable in dynamic, crowded scenes.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing camera system (RGB or RGB-D).
*   Dedicated processing unit (GPU or specialized AI accelerator) for real-time prediction.
*   Sufficient memory (RAM) for model storage and intermediate data.

**III. Software Components:**

*   **Human Presence Detection Module:** Existing system (as per the provided patent) for initial HD confidence scores.
*   **Keypoint Detection Module:** Existing system for generating keypoint data.
*   **Occlusion Prediction Model (OPM):** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) – trained on a large dataset of human interactions and environmental scenes. Input features:
    *   Historical keypoint trajectories (past *n* frames).
    *   Depth data (if RGB-D camera is used) for estimating distances and relative positions.
    *   Static environmental map (created via SLAM or similar).
    *   Velocity vectors of detected humans.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Module:** This module receives:
    *   HD Confidence Score
    *   TP Confidence Score (from existing system)
    *   Occlusion Probability (output from OPM)
    *   Adjusts the final detection threshold based on a weighted sum of these factors. The weighting can be learned via reinforcement learning.

**IV. Operational Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Initialize System
SLAM_Map = CreateStaticEnvironmentalMap()
OPM = LoadOcclusionPredictionModel()

LOOP:
    Frame = CaptureImage()
    HD_Confidence = HumanPresenceDetection(Frame)
    Keypoints = KeypointDetection(Frame)
    DepthMap = GenerateDepthMap(Frame) //If applicable

    //Predict Occlusion
    TrajectoryData = GenerateKeypointTrajectories(Keypoints, PastNFrames)
    OcclusionProbability = OPM(TrajectoryData, DepthMap, SLAM_Map) // Outputs a value between 0 and 1

    //Adjust Detection Threshold
    BaseThreshold = 0.7 //Initial Threshold
    OcclusionWeight = 0.3 //Weight for Occlusion Probability
    AdjustedThreshold = BaseThreshold + (OcclusionWeight * OcclusionProbability)

    //Determine Human Presence
    If HD_Confidence > AdjustedThreshold Then
      MarkHumanPresent()
    Else
      SuppressFalsePositive()
```

**V.  Innovation Details:**

The core innovation lies in *proactive* adjustment of the detection threshold. Instead of reacting to false positives *after* they occur, the system anticipates potential occlusions and lowers the threshold accordingly. This allows the system to maintain a higher recall (detecting more true positives) at the cost of a slightly increased false positive rate, which is mitigated by the advanced occlusion prediction. The dynamic adjustment module allows for fine-grained control and optimization of the detection performance.  The integration of historical keypoint data and depth information significantly improves the accuracy of occlusion prediction.
