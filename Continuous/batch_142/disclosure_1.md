## Dynamic Metadata Map Fusion & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the metadata map functionality to allow for *dynamic* map creation through fusion of existing maps and predictive generation of new maps based on user behavior and data drift. This goes beyond simple user-created edits – the system actively learns and proposes improvements to the mapping process.

**Specs:**

**1. Fusion Engine:**

*   **Input:** A selection of two or more existing metadata maps (user-defined or system-generated).
*   **Process:** Algorithm that identifies commonalities and differences between the selected maps.  It prioritizes preserving data integrity (no loss of information) and resolving conflicting translations with a weighted scoring system. Weights are adjustable by an admin and impacted by the historical performance of each map.
*   **Output:** A new, combined metadata map. This map is flagged as "Fused" and includes lineage information (the source maps used for fusion).
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function fuseMaps(map1, map2, conflictResolutionWeighting) {
        combinedMap = new Map();
        for (attribute in map1) {
            if (attribute in map2) {
                //Conflict Resolution
                if(map1[attribute].translation != map2[attribute].translation){
                    //Weighted scoring of each translation.
                    score1 = historicalPerformance(map1[attribute].translation);
                    score2 = historicalPerformance(map2[attribute].translation);
                    if(score1 > score2){
                        combinedMap[attribute] = map1[attribute];
                    } else {
                        combinedMap[attribute] = map2[attribute];
                    }
                } else {
                    combinedMap[attribute] = map1[attribute];
                }
            } else {
                combinedMap[attribute] = map1[attribute];
            }
        }
        for (attribute in map2) {
            if (!(attribute in combinedMap)) {
                combinedMap[attribute] = map2[attribute];
            }
        }
        combinedMap.lineage = [map1, map2]; //track origin
        return combinedMap;
    }
    ```

**2. Predictive Map Generation:**

*   **Data Sources:**  User catalog data, system catalog data, user interactions (map selections, edits, rejections), data drift metrics (changes in data format/value distribution).
*   **Algorithm:**  Utilizes a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) trained on historical map usage and data drift. The model predicts potential mapping requirements *before* they become explicit problems.  It identifies emerging attribute-value pairs in the user catalog and proposes new maps or map modifications.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Monitor user catalog for changes in attribute-value pairs.
    2.  Detect data drift in incoming data compared to established norms.
    3.  Forecast future mapping needs based on historical data and current trends.
    4.  Generate candidate metadata maps using the forecasting model.
    5.  Rank candidate maps based on confidence score (derived from the model) and relevance to current data.
    6.  Present top-ranked maps to users for review and approval.
*   **Pseudocode:**
    ```
    function predictNewMap(userCatalog, historicalData, driftMetrics){
        //Analyze userCatalog for new/changed attributes
        newAttributes = detectNewAttributes(userCatalog);
        //Use time series model to predict mapping needs
        predictedMap = timeSeriesModel.predict(newAttributes, historicalData, driftMetrics);
        //Rank predicted map based on confidence score and relevance
        confidenceScore = calculateConfidenceScore(predictedMap);
        relevanceScore = calculateRelevanceScore(predictedMap, userCatalog);
        rankedMap = {map: predictedMap, score: confidenceScore * relevanceScore};
        return rankedMap;
    }
    ```

**3. Active Learning Feedback Loop:**

*   **User Interface:** When the system proposes a predictive map, the UI offers granular feedback options:
    *   "Accept" – The map is accepted and added to the user's map library.
    *   "Reject" – The map is rejected and the system learns from the rejection.
    *   "Edit" – The user can edit the proposed map before accepting it.
    *   "Explain" – The system provides a rationale for the proposed map (e.g., similar attributes, historical usage patterns).
*   **Model Retraining:** User feedback is continuously used to retrain the forecasting model, improving its accuracy and relevance over time.

**4. Map Versioning and A/B Testing:**

*   Maintain a complete history of all map versions (user-created, fused, predicted).
*   Enable A/B testing of different map versions to determine which ones perform best in real-world scenarios.
