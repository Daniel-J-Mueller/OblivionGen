## Secure Audio Authentication & Key Exchange

**Concept:** Leverage acoustic characteristics of a user’s voice *during* the key exchange process, not as a separate biometric check. This creates a continuously verified, passively authenticated connection.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Standard microphone/speaker on both client/server devices.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Acoustic Feature Extractor:* Extracts a rolling feature set from the incoming audio stream (e.g., MFCCs, spectrogram analysis, vocal tract length).
    *   *Challenge Generator:* Creates unique, short audio 'challenges' (synthetic speech or randomized sound patterns).  Challenges vary in complexity to resist replay attacks.
    *   *Response Analyzer:*  Evaluates the client's *response* to the challenge - not the content of the response, but the acoustic characteristics of *how* it's spoken or reproduced (latency, timbre, vocal effort, etc.).
    *   *Key Derivation Function (KDF):* Integrates the acoustic response data into the key derivation process.
    *   *Communication Protocol:*  Modified TLS handshake to incorporate acoustic challenge/response.

**Protocol Flow:**

1.  **Initial Handshake:** Standard TLS connection establishment begins.
2.  **Acoustic Challenge:** Server generates and transmits a short audio challenge to the client.
3.  **Client Response:** Client *reproduces* the challenge into its microphone.  The *content* of what is reproduced is not important – only *how* it sounds.
4.  **Acoustic Analysis:** Client sends the captured audio to the server.
5.  **Server Analysis:** Server analyzes the client’s response, extracting acoustic features.
6.  **Key Integration:** Server’s KDF combines the acoustic features with the standard key exchange data (e.g., Diffie-Hellman parameters) to generate the session key.
7.  **Continuous Verification:**  During the session, the server periodically sends low-intensity challenges, analyzing the client’s response to passively verify ongoing presence and authorization.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side KDF):**

```
function deriveSessionKey(dh_shared_secret, acoustic_features):
    // Standard KDF operations (e.g., HKDF)
    salt = generateRandomSalt()
    info = "TLS Acoustic Authentication"
    derivedKey = HKDF(salt, info, dh_shared_secret)

    // Integrate acoustic features
    acoustic_weight = 0.2 //Adjustable weight
    acoustic_hash = SHA256(acoustic_features)

    finalKey =  (0.8 * derivedKey) XOR (0.2 * acoustic_hash) //XOR combines data, adjust weights

    return finalKey
```

**Novelty:**

This differs from existing biometric authentication methods by:

*   **Passive Authentication:** The system doesn't require the user to *actively* authenticate each time, authentication is continuous and inherent in the communication process.
*   **Focus on *How*, Not *What*:**  It analyzes *how* sound is produced/reproduced, not the content of the audio, making it resistant to voice cloning or recording attacks.
*   **Seamless Integration:**  Integrated into the standard key exchange process, adding minimal overhead.
