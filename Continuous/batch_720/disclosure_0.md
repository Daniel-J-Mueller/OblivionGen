## Automated Data Catalog Enrichment via Generative AI "Shadow Catalogs"

**Concept:** Expand the data catalog's descriptive capabilities beyond structural data and lineage by creating dynamic “shadow catalogs” generated by AI agents analyzing data content. These shadow catalogs wouldn’t *replace* the existing structural catalog, but exist as linked augmentations, providing richer semantic understanding.

**Specifications:**

**1. AI Agent Framework:**

*   **Agent Types:** Define several specialized AI agents:
    *   *Content Summarizer:* Analyzes data content (text, numerical, image metadata) to create concise, human-readable summaries.
    *   *Relationship Discoverer:* Identifies statistically significant relationships between data fields within and across datasets.
    *   *Anomaly Detector:* Identifies unusual patterns or outliers in data, flagging potential data quality issues or interesting insights.
    *   *Topic Modeler:*  Determines dominant themes or topics present within text-based datasets.
    *   *Data Quality Assessor:* Evaluates data against defined quality rules (completeness, accuracy, consistency).
*   **Agent Orchestration:** A central orchestrator manages agent assignment based on data type and catalog enrichment goals.  The orchestrator also handles agent resource allocation and scheduling.
*   **Agent API:**  Standardized API for agents to access data, store enrichment results, and communicate with the orchestrator.

**2. Shadow Catalog Structure:**

*   **Linked Metadata:** Each entry in the shadow catalog is linked to its corresponding entry in the primary data catalog via a unique identifier.
*   **Enrichment Fields:**  Store results from AI agents:
    *   `Summary`: Textual summary generated by Content Summarizer.
    *   `Relationships`: List of detected relationships (field A related to field B with strength X).
    *   `Anomalies`: List of detected anomalies with severity and description.
    *   `Topics`: List of dominant topics with associated keywords and weights.
    *   `DataQualityScore`: Numerical score representing data quality based on assessment.
*   **Versioning:** Track changes to enrichment data over time to allow for historical analysis and auditability.
*   **Data Format:** Utilize a flexible schema (e.g., JSON-LD) to accommodate diverse enrichment types.

**3.  Automated Enrichment Pipeline:**

*   **Triggering:**  Pipeline triggered by:
    *   New dataset registration in primary catalog.
    *   Scheduled refresh (e.g., daily, weekly).
    *   Data change event (detected via data lake activity monitoring).
*   **Data Access:**  Securely access data sources via existing data catalog access controls and credentials.
*   **Agent Execution:** Orchestrator assigns appropriate agents to analyze data.  Agents operate in parallel where possible.
*   **Result Storage:** Enrichment results stored in a dedicated shadow catalog database (e.g., graph database, document database).
*   **Catalog Linking:**  Links established between primary and shadow catalog entries.
*   **API Endpoint:** Provide API endpoint for querying enriched data.

**4.  User Interface Integration:**

*   **Enrichment Panel:** Display enrichment data alongside primary catalog metadata in a user-friendly interface.
*   **Filtering & Search:** Allow users to filter and search based on enrichment criteria (e.g., "Show datasets with data quality score below 0.8").
*   **Visualization:** Provide visualization tools to explore relationships and anomalies (e.g., network graphs, heatmaps).
*   **Feedback Mechanism:**  Allow users to provide feedback on enrichment accuracy and relevance to improve agent performance.

**Pseudocode (Orchestrator):**

```
function process_dataset(dataset_id):
  dataset_info = get_dataset_info(dataset_id)
  data_type = dataset_info.data_type
  agents_to_run = []

  if data_type == "text":
    agents_to_run.append(ContentSummarizer)
    agents_to_run.append(TopicModeler)
  if data_type == "numerical":
    agents_to_run.append(AnomalyDetector)
    agents_to_run.append(RelationshipDiscoverer)

  for agent in agents_to_run:
    agent.run(dataset_id)

  DataQualityAssessor.run(dataset_id)
  store_enrichment_results(dataset_id)
```
