## Augmented Reality Collaborative Sculpting

**Concept:** Expand the augmented reality interaction beyond simple object identification and transaction to enable collaborative, spatially-anchored sculpting in a shared environment. Users, potentially remote, can contribute to a single virtual sculpture visible and manipulable within the real world.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   AR Headset with hand tracking (minimum 6DoF).
    *   High-resolution depth sensor (e.g., LiDAR) for robust environmental mapping and occlusion.
    *   Multi-user networking infrastructure (low latency is critical).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Spatial Anchor Management:** System maintains a persistent, shared coordinate system anchored to the real world. Users' initial environment scan establishes this anchor.
    *   **Sculpting Primitives:** A library of basic 3D shapes (spheres, cubes, cylinders, cones, freeform curves) serves as building blocks.  Primitives are parameterized (size, resolution, material properties).
    *   **Dynamic Mesh Generation:** Algorithm generates a cohesive mesh from the combined primitives.  Mesh density adapts based on proximity to the user (level of detail optimization).
    *   **Collaborative Editing:**
        *   **Ownership Model:** Each primitive is assigned to a user.  Only the owner can directly manipulate that specific primitive.  Requesting editing rights from another user is possible.
        *   **Conflict Resolution:**  Simultaneous edits to the same primitive are handled via optimistic locking (last write wins with versioning).
        *   **Undo/Redo Stack:** Shared undo/redo stack for the entire sculpture, accessible to all collaborators.
    *   **Material Library:** A palette of virtual materials with adjustable properties (color, texture, reflectivity, transparency).
    *   **Real-time Rendering:**  Physically-based rendering (PBR) to simulate realistic lighting and material interactions.
    *   **Haptic Feedback (Optional):** Integration with haptic gloves or exoskeletons to provide tactile sensations during sculpting.
    *    **Persistence Layer:** Store sculpture data (primitive positions, materials, history) in a cloud-based database for later retrieval and continued collaboration.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Collaborative Primitive Manipulation):**

```pseudocode
function handleUserGesture(userId, gestureType, gestureData):
    if gestureType == "createPrimitive":
        primitiveId = generateUniqueId()
        primitive = createPrimitive(gestureData.primitiveType, gestureData.position, gestureData.scale)
        assignOwnership(primitiveId, userId)
        addPrimitiveToScene(primitive)
    else if gestureType == "manipulatePrimitive":
        primitiveId = gestureData.primitiveId
        if isOwner(primitiveId, userId):
            applyTransformation(primitiveId, gestureData.transformation)
            updateScene()
        else:
            requestOwnership(primitiveId, userId)
    else if gestureType == "requestOwnership":
        primitiveId = gestureData.primitiveId
        ownerId = getOwner(primitiveId)
        if ownerId != userId:
            sendOwnershipRequest(ownerId, userId, primitiveId)
    else if gestureType == "approveOwnership":
        primitiveId = gestureData.primitiveId
        newOwnerId = gestureData.newOwnerId
        if isOwner(primitiveId, userId):
            transferOwnership(primitiveId, newOwnerId)
```

**Innovation Focus:**

This system goes beyond simply *interacting* with objects in AR. It allows users to *create* something collaboratively and persistently within a shared real-world space.  Potential applications include: architectural design, product prototyping, artistic expression, remote training, and educational simulations. The shared, persistent nature differentiates it from single-user AR experiences.
