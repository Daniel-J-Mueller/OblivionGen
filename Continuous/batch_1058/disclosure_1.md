## Dynamic Item Bundling & Predictive Promotion System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply cross-advertising related items. Create a dynamic bundling system that *predicts* user need based on browsing history and purchase patterns, proactively offering bundles *before* the user actively searches for complementary items. The system should also dynamically adjust pricing and promotions based on real-time inventory, demand, and user loyalty.

**System Specs:**

1.  **User Profile Construction:**
    *   Data Sources: Website browsing history, purchase history, wishlists, saved items, demographics (optional, with user consent).
    *   Profile Attributes: Item categories of interest, price sensitivity, preferred brands, seasonality of purchases (e.g., winter sports gear), frequency of purchases.
    *   Scoring: Assign weights to each attribute to create a "need score" for different item categories.

2.  **Item Relationship Graph:**
    *   Data Source:  Existing product catalog data, user co-purchase data (what items are frequently bought together), semantic analysis of product descriptions (identifying functional relationships between items).
    *   Graph Structure: Nodes represent items. Edges represent relationships (e.g., "complementary," "alternative," "required for operation"). Edge weights represent the strength of the relationship.

3.  **Predictive Bundle Engine:**
    *   Input: User Profile, Item Relationship Graph, Real-time Inventory Data, Demand Forecasts.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   For a given user, identify the items they are currently viewing or have recently purchased.
        *   Traverse the Item Relationship Graph to identify complementary or related items.
        *   Calculate a "bundle score" for each potential bundle based on:
            *   Strength of relationships between items.
            *   User's need score for each item category.
            *   Real-time inventory levels (favor bundles with items in stock).
            *   Demand forecast (adjust pricing and promotion based on predicted demand).
        *   Rank bundles based on score and present the top-ranked bundles to the user.

4.  **Dynamic Pricing & Promotion Module:**
    *   Input: Bundle Score, Real-time Inventory, Demand Forecast, User Loyalty Tier.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   Base Price: Calculate the total price of the bundle.
        *   Discount: Apply a discount based on:
            *   Bundle Score (higher score = larger discount).
            *   User Loyalty Tier (higher tier = larger discount).
            *   Real-time Inventory (discount items with high inventory).
        *   Promotion Type: Select a promotion type (e.g., percentage discount, free shipping, bundled accessory).
        *   Dynamic Adjustment: Continuously adjust pricing and promotions based on real-time data and user behavior.

5.  **User Interface:**
    *   Proactive Bundle Display: Display bundle recommendations on product pages, shopping cart page, and account dashboard.
    *   Bundle Customization: Allow users to customize bundles (e.g., remove items, add alternative items).
    *   "Why This Bundle?" Explanation: Provide a brief explanation of why the bundle is being recommended (e.g., "Customers who bought this kayak also frequently purchase this paddle and life vest.").

**Pseudocode:**

```
function recommend_bundles(user_profile, current_item):
  item_graph = get_item_relationship_graph()
  related_items = item_graph.get_neighbors(current_item)
  potential_bundles = []

  for item in related_items:
    bundle = [current_item, item]
    bundle_score = calculate_bundle_score(user_profile, bundle)
    potential_bundles.append((bundle, bundle_score))

  potential_bundles.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  return potential_bundles[:5] // Return top 5 bundles

function calculate_bundle_score(user_profile, bundle):
  score = 0
  for item in bundle:
    category = get_item_category(item)
    user_need = user_profile.get_need_for_category(category)
    score += user_need * get_item_relevance(item)
  return score
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Scalable database for storing user profiles, item relationships, and inventory data.
*   Machine learning algorithms for predicting user needs and optimizing bundle recommendations.
*   Real-time data streaming infrastructure for processing inventory data and demand forecasts.
*   API for integrating with existing e-commerce platform.
