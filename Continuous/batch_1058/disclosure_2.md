## Dynamic Operation Cost Profiling & Adaptive Authorization

**Concept:** Extend the tag-based authorization to incorporate real-time operational cost and system impact analysis. Instead of *just* semantic similarity, authorization dynamically adjusts based on the projected ‘cost’ of executing an operation, measured in resource consumption, latency, or even financial terms. This allows for nuanced access control – a user might be authorized to *some* operations with a tag, but not those exceeding a certain cost threshold at a given moment.

**Specs:**

**1. Cost Profile Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** Key-Value store.
    *   Key: Operation Identifier (e.g., API endpoint, function name).
    *   Value:  `{“base_cost”: float, “resource_profile”: {“cpu”: float, “memory”: float, “network”: float}, “latency_profile”: {“mean”: float, “stddev”: float}}`
*   **Update Mechanism:**  Continuous monitoring of operation execution. Update `base_cost`, `resource_profile`, and `latency_profile` based on observed metrics.  Employ exponential moving averages to smooth out fluctuations.
*   **External Data Sources:** Integrate with cloud provider cost APIs (AWS, Azure, GCP) to obtain real-time resource pricing.

**2. Dynamic Authorization Module:**

*   **Input:**  Incoming request (Operation ID, Security Principal, Request Parameters).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Retrieve Operation Cost Profile.
    2.  Calculate *Projected Cost* based on Request Parameters (e.g., data size, complexity).  Use a cost function tailored to the operation.
    3.  Retrieve Security Principal’s *Cost Threshold*. This is a configurable value (per-user, per-group) representing the maximum permissible cost for operations the principal can authorize.
    4.  If `Projected Cost` <= `Cost Threshold`: Authorize the request.
    5.  Else:  Deny the request with a descriptive error message.
*   **Cost Threshold Management:**
    *   Administrators can set/modify Cost Thresholds via a web interface.
    *   Cost Thresholds can be dynamically adjusted based on system load (e.g., lower thresholds during peak hours).
    *   Implement a “Cost Budget” system where principals are allocated a limited amount of operational “credits” per time period.

**3. Tagging Enhancement:**

*   Introduce a “Cost Tag” in addition to existing semantic tags.
*   Cost Tag: An indicator of the typical resource intensity of operations associated with that tag. (e.g., “High”, “Medium”, “Low”).
*   Authorization logic:  Consider both semantic tags *and* the Cost Tag when evaluating a request.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Authorization Module):**

```
function authorizeRequest(operationId, securityPrincipal, requestParameters):
  operationProfile = getOperationProfile(operationId)
  if operationProfile is null:
    return false // Operation not found

  projectedCost = calculateProjectedCost(operationProfile, requestParameters)

  securityPrincipalProfile = getSecurityPrincipalProfile(securityPrincipal)
  if securityPrincipalProfile is null:
    return false // Security principal not found

  costThreshold = securityPrincipalProfile.costThreshold

  if projectedCost <= costThreshold:
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Predictive Cost Analysis:**  Use machine learning models to predict future resource consumption based on historical data and current system conditions.
*   **Cost-Aware Scheduling:** Prioritize operations with lower costs during periods of high demand.
*   **Operation Throttling:**  Limit the rate of operations exceeding a certain cost threshold.
*   **Real-Time Cost Feedback:**  Provide users with real-time feedback on the cost of their operations.
