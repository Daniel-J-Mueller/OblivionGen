## Dynamic Knowledge Graph Visualization & Exploration

**Concept:** Extend the knowledge base beyond simple inference and storage by creating a dynamic, interactive visualization layer accessible to users. This goes beyond querying – it *shows* relationships, allows manipulation, and facilitates discovery of unforeseen connections.

**Specs:**

*   **Knowledge Graph Rendering Engine:** A dedicated module responsible for translating the structured knowledge base into a visually navigable graph.  Nodes represent entities, edges represent relationships.
*   **Node & Edge Attributes:**  Nodes should display key attributes directly (e.g., name, type, relevant data). Edges should indicate relationship type and potentially strength/confidence score.
*   **Interactive Layout:**  Force-directed graph layout algorithm optimized for readability and dynamic updates.  Users can:
    *   Pan, zoom, and rotate the graph.
    *   Pin nodes to fixed positions.
    *   Filter nodes and edges based on attributes and relationship types.
    *   Manually adjust node positions (with optional persistence).
*   **"What If" Analysis:** Allow users to temporarily add/remove facts from the knowledge base *within the visualization* to see how it impacts connected entities. This is *not* a change to the core KB; it’s a simulation.  Visual cues (e.g., highlighting, color changes) indicate the ripple effects of these changes.
*   **Pattern Recognition & Highlighting:** Automated detection of common graph patterns (e.g., cycles, hubs, bottlenecks).  Highlight these patterns visually to draw user attention to potentially interesting areas.
*   **Natural Language Query Integration:** Integrate with the existing natural language query system. When a query is executed, the relevant subgraph is highlighted in the visualization, providing visual context for the results.
*   **"Knowledge Gap" Identification:**  Analyze the graph to identify missing relationships or entities that would logically connect existing knowledge.  Visually highlight these gaps as "potential connections."
*   **Temporal Awareness:**  If knowledge base facts have timestamps, enable a time slider to visualize how the graph has evolved over time.
*   **User Profiles & Personalized Views:**  Allow users to save custom graph layouts, filters, and personalized views.
*   **API Access:** Provide an API for external applications to access and manipulate the graph visualization.

**Pseudocode (Simplified "What If" Analysis):**

```
function simulateFactChange(factID, newTruthValue) {
  // Retrieve original fact from knowledge base.
  originalFact = knowledgeBase.getFact(factID);

  // Temporarily set fact to newTruthValue (do NOT modify KB).
  tempFact = { ...originalFact, truthValue: newTruthValue };

  // Identify all entities connected to the fact.
  connectedEntities = knowledgeBase.getConnectedEntities(factID);

  // Propagate the change to connected entities:
  for (entity in connectedEntities) {
    // Recalculate entity's properties based on updated connections.
    entity.recalculateProperties();

    // Update the visualization to reflect changes.
    visualizationEngine.updateNode(entity);
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple knowledge retrieval. It provides a *visual exploration environment* that empowers users to interact with the knowledge base, discover hidden connections, and perform "what if" analysis – all within a dynamic, interactive graph visualization.  The focus is on *understanding* the knowledge, not just querying it.  This addresses the need for more intuitive and engaging ways to interact with complex knowledge systems.
