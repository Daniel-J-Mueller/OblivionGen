## Adaptive Event Payload Generation & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the event triggering system to *predict* future events and pre-generate event payloads, significantly reducing latency beyond the 100ms target. This utilizes a localized, predictive model informed by historical event data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Event Model (PEM):**

*   **Data Source:** PEM ingests event metadata (as defined in the patent) along with timestamps.  Additionally, it accesses user activity data (with appropriate privacy controls) â€“ e.g., typical upload times, database query patterns.
*   **Model Type:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) is trained per user/application to predict the probability of future events.
*   **Prediction Horizon:** Configurable prediction horizon (e.g., 5 seconds, 30 seconds).
*   **Confidence Threshold:**  A configurable confidence threshold.  Only predictions exceeding this threshold trigger pre-generation.

**2. Pre-Generation Service:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated by PEM exceeding the confidence threshold for a predicted event.
*   **Payload Generation:** Generates a *candidate* event payload based on the predicted event type and user-specific programmatic event handling information.
*   **Payload Storage:**  Stores candidate payloads in a low-latency cache (e.g., in-memory key-value store) associated with the user/application.  Each payload is tagged with a 'valid after' timestamp aligned with the predicted event time.
*   **Payload Versioning:** Maintains multiple versions of payloads, allowing rollback to previous states.

**3. Event Handling Pipeline Modification:**

*   **Event Detection:** Standard event detection as described in the patent.
*   **Cache Lookup:** Before generating a new event payload, the system checks the cache for a valid payload matching the event type and user ID.
*   **Payload Delivery:**
    *   If a valid payload is found, it's delivered *immediately* to the virtual compute system.
    *   If no valid payload is found, the standard payload generation process (described in the patent) is triggered.

**4. Adaptive Learning & Refinement:**

*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitor the accuracy of event predictions.  If predictions are consistently inaccurate, the PEM model is retrained.
*   **Payload Validation:** Virtual compute system provides feedback on the validity of pre-generated payloads.  Invalid payloads are discarded, and the PEM model is adjusted to prevent similar errors in the future.

**Pseudocode (Event Handling Pipeline):**

```
function handleEvent(eventData):
  userId = eventData.userId
  eventType = eventData.eventType

  cachedPayload = lookupCache(userId, eventType)

  if cachedPayload != null and cachedPayload.validAfter <= currentTime:
    deliverPayload(cachedPayload)
  else:
    // Standard payload generation from patent
    payload = generatePayload(eventData)
    deliverPayload(payload)
    storeCache(userId, eventType, payload)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   PEM & Pre-Generation Service require dedicated compute resources (e.g., GPU acceleration for model training and inference).
*   Low-latency cache requires high-speed memory (e.g., DRAM).
