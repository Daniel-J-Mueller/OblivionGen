## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Regions

**Concept:** Augment the touch-assist technology with localized haptic feedback. Instead of *only* visually enlarging the selection region, subtly change the surface texture/resistance *under* the user’s finger as they approach and decelerate near a navigational element.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** E-skin layer integrated into the display surface. This could be implemented with microfluidic channels, shape-memory alloys, or electrostatic adhesion mechanisms. Resolution: minimum 1mm granularity. Force range: 0-200mN.
*   **Software - Region Definition:** Similar to the patent’s ‘region’ around navigational elements, define a spherical ‘influence radius’ around each element. This radius is dynamically adjusted based on user speed and approach angle. Faster approaches = larger initial radius.
*   **Software - Haptic Profile Generation:** Each navigational element is assigned a unique haptic ‘signature’. This signature defines the texture and resistance profile within the influence radius.  Examples:
    *   Hyperlinks: A subtle ‘ridged’ texture.
    *   Buttons: A momentary increase in resistance simulating a physical click.
    *   Scrollbars:  A dynamic texture that shifts as the user ‘grabs’ the bar.
*   **Software – Velocity and Deceleration Tracking:** Monitor touch input velocity and deceleration rate.  This data triggers the haptic effect.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function applyHapticFeedback(touchInput, navigationalElement) {
  // Calculate distance and velocity
  distance = calculateDistance(touchInput.location, navigationalElement.location);
  velocity = calculateVelocity(touchInput.trajectory);

  // Determine haptic intensity
  intensity = map(velocity, 0, maxVelocity, 0, maxIntensity); // Scale velocity to intensity
  intensity = constrain(intensity, 0, maxIntensity);

  // Apply haptic effect
  setHapticEffect(navigationalElement.hapticSignature, intensity);
}

function setHapticEffect(signature, intensity) {
  // Activate microfluidic channels/SMA/electrostatic actuators
  // based on the signature and intensity.
  // Signature defines the pattern, intensity the strength.
}
```

*   **Calibration:** User-adjustable sensitivity settings for haptic intensity and responsiveness.
*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   Directional Haptics: Simulate the direction of scrolling or movement.
    *   Contextual Haptics: Change haptic feedback based on the content being viewed (e.g., rough texture for maps, smooth for text).
    *   Multi-Finger Support: Allow for more complex haptic interactions.
