## Adaptive Data Masking with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Specification:** A system for dynamically masking sensitive data within datasets, leveraging Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to create plausible, synthetic replacements while preserving data utility.

**Core Concept:** The patent highlights identifying potential sensitive data via statistical relationships. This system builds on that by *replacing* the identified data with synthetic data generated to maintain those relationships, creating a ‘shadow’ dataset that can be used for analysis without exposing real sensitive information.

**System Components:**

1.  **Sensitivity Profiler:** (Similar to existing patent’s initial steps) Analyzes the input dataset to identify attributes and attribute combinations likely to contain sensitive information, using data type similarity, semantic filtering, and statistical analysis of distribution. 

2.  **GAN Training Module:**
    *   Input: The original dataset (or a representative sample) and the Sensitivity Profiler’s output.
    *   Process: Trains a GAN (specifically a Conditional GAN - cGAN) to learn the data distribution of non-sensitive attributes and the relationships between sensitive and non-sensitive attributes.  The cGAN is conditioned on the non-sensitive attributes.
    *   Output: A trained cGAN model.

3.  **Data Masking Engine:**
    *   Input: The original dataset and the trained cGAN model.
    *   Process:
        1.  Identifies sensitive data points based on the Sensitivity Profiler's output.
        2.  For each sensitive data point, uses the cGAN to generate a synthetic replacement conditioned on the corresponding non-sensitive attribute values.
        3.  Replaces the original sensitive data point with the generated synthetic data.
    *   Output: A masked dataset with synthetic replacements for sensitive data.

4.  **Utility Preservation Monitor:**
    *   Input: Original dataset, masked dataset.
    *   Process: Continuously monitors key statistical properties (e.g., distributions, correlations) of the masked dataset and compares them to the original dataset.  If significant divergence is detected, triggers retraining of the GAN or adjustments to the masking process.
    *   Output: Performance metrics indicating the level of utility preservation.

**Pseudocode (Data Masking Engine):**

```
FUNCTION MaskData(original_dataset, cGAN_model):
  masked_dataset = {}
  FOR EACH record IN original_dataset:
    masked_record = {}
    FOR EACH attribute IN record:
      IF SensitivityProfiler(attribute) == TRUE:
        # Generate synthetic value using cGAN
        synthetic_value = cGAN_model.generate(record, attribute)
        masked_record[attribute] = synthetic_value
      ELSE:
        masked_record[attribute] = record[attribute]
    masked_dataset.append(masked_record)
  RETURN masked_dataset
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Dynamic Masking:** The system isn’t based on static rules or pre-defined masking functions. The GAN learns the data and generates replacements tailored to each specific record.
*   **Utility-Aware Masking:** The Utility Preservation Monitor actively ensures that the masked dataset remains statistically similar to the original, minimizing the impact on data analysis.
*   **cGAN Conditioning:** Using a Conditional GAN allows the system to generate replacements that are consistent with the context of the non-sensitive attributes, improving the realism and usability of the masked data.
*   **Scalability:** The system can be parallelized to handle large datasets efficiently.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   High-performance computing cluster with multiple GPUs for GAN training.
*   Large-capacity storage for datasets and trained models.
*   Network infrastructure for data transfer and communication between components.

**Software Specifications:**

*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Data processing libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy).
*   Data storage and retrieval system (e.g., database, file system).
*   API for accessing the masking service.
