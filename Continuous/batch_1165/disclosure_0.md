## Dynamic Key Derivation via Biometric Authentication & Environmental Context

**Concept:** Enhance security and user experience by dynamically deriving encryption keys not just from a shared secret and public/private key pairs, but also incorporating biometric authentication *and* environmental context data from the user device. This moves beyond static shared secrets and introduces a multi-factor, real-time key generation process.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **User Device Module:**  Responsible for biometric capture, environmental data collection, initial key derivation requests, and final decryption.
*   **Content Provider Server Module:**  Handles key derivation requests, performs server-side calculations, and encrypts/decrypts media data.
*   **Biometric Authentication System:** Integrated into the user device (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint, etc.).
*   **Environmental Sensor Suite:**  Integrated into the user device (GPS, accelerometer, microphone - ambient noise level, barometer).

**II. Key Derivation Process:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** User requests streaming of media data. Device initiates a key derivation request to the Content Provider Server. This request includes:
    *   Shared Secret Key Identifier (as in the provided patent).
    *   Device Public Key.
    *   Request Timestamp.

2.  **Biometric Capture & Environmental Data Collection:** User Device captures biometric data and collects environmental data.

3.  **Local Hashing & Pre-Processing:**  User Device hashes the biometric data and environmental data separately using SHA-256. These hashes are then combined (XOR operation) to produce a single "Context Hash."

4.  **Secure Transmission of Context Hash:** The Context Hash is *encrypted* using the Device Public Key and transmitted to the Content Provider Server.

5.  **Server-Side Key Derivation:**
    *   The Server retrieves the Shared Secret Key associated with the Shared Secret Key Identifier.
    *   The Server decrypts the Context Hash using its corresponding Private Key.
    *   The Server combines the Shared Secret Key, the Device Public Key, the Request Timestamp, and the decrypted Context Hash. This combination is fed into a Key Derivation Function (KDF) â€“ Argon2id recommended.

    ```pseudocode
    function deriveEncryptionKey(sharedSecretKey, devicePublicKey, requestTimestamp, contextHash):
      combinedData = sharedSecretKey + devicePublicKey + requestTimestamp + contextHash
      encryptionKey = KDF(combinedData, salt, iterations, memoryCost) // Argon2id
      return encryptionKey
    ```

6.  **Traffic Key Generation & Encryption:**  The derived encryption key is used to generate a symmetric traffic encryption key (e.g., AES-256) for encrypting the media data. The media data is encrypted using the traffic encryption key.

7.  **Transmission & Decryption:** The encrypted media data is transmitted to the user device. The user device decrypts the data using the traffic encryption key (derived via the same process on the device side).

**III.  Device-Side Implementation (Key Derivation Mirror):**

The user device *mirrors* the server-side key derivation process. This ensures that both sides generate the *exact same* traffic encryption key.  The device uses the initial Shared Secret Key, Device Public Key, Request Timestamp, locally captured biometric data and environmental data to derive the same traffic encryption key using the same KDF and parameters.

**IV. Security Considerations:**

*   **Biometric Spoofing:** Implement liveness detection techniques to mitigate biometric spoofing attacks.
*   **Environmental Data Tampering:**  While environmental data tampering is less critical than biometric spoofing, consider adding integrity checks to the environmental data (e.g., digital signatures).
*   **KDF Parameter Selection:** Carefully select KDF parameters (salt, iterations, memory cost) to ensure adequate security against brute-force attacks.
*   **Secure Storage:** Securely store the Shared Secret Key on both the user device and the Content Provider Server.

**V.  Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:**  Multi-factor authentication makes it significantly harder for attackers to compromise the encryption keys.
*   **Improved User Experience:**  Biometric authentication can provide a seamless and convenient user experience.
*   **Dynamic Key Rotation:** The integration of biometric and environmental data creates a constantly evolving key landscape, making it more difficult for attackers to intercept and decrypt the data.
