## Dynamic Gift Certificate "Experiences"

**Concept:** Expand the gift certificate beyond a simple monetary value to include dynamically generated "experience" bundles tied to the recipient's inferred preferences, delivered *after* certificate claim, and integrated with local/online services.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Preference Inference Engine:**
    *   Data Sources: Integrate with recipient's publicly available social media data (with explicit opt-in/consent), purchase history (if available and consented to), and potentially demographic data.
    *   Algorithm: Employ a machine learning model (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid) to predict recipient interests â€“ categories like "dining," "entertainment," "wellness," "adventure," etc., and finer-grained subcategories.  Output is a weighted preference vector.
    *   API: Expose an API endpoint that accepts a recipient ID and returns a preference vector.

2.  **Experience Bundle Generator:**
    *   Service Integrations: Connect to APIs of local businesses (restaurants, spas, event venues, tour operators) *and* online service providers (streaming subscriptions, online courses, digital content).
    *   Bundle Creation Rules: Define rules for assembling experience bundles based on preference vectors and monetary value of the gift certificate.  Examples:
        *   "High Dining Preference + $50 Certificate = $50 Restaurant Gift Card"
        *   "High Wellness Preference + $100 Certificate = 60-minute Massage + $20 Digital Meditation Subscription"
        *   "High Adventure Preference + $200 Certificate = Local Rock Climbing Gym Pass + Adventure Gear Discount"
    *   Dynamic Pricing: Implement a dynamic pricing mechanism that selects service offerings to maximize the value received for the certificate amount.
    *   Bundle Variety: Ensure a diversity of bundles are generated to avoid repeated offerings.

3.  **Claim Code Modification:**
    *   Extend Claim Code: The claim code in the email link will now include a "bundle request flag" alongside the monetary value and recipient ID.
    *   Bundle Generation Trigger:  When the recipient clicks the link, the system checks the bundle request flag. If set, the Bundle Generator is triggered.

4.  **Post-Claim Delivery System:**
    *   Bundle Presentation: Display a curated list of 3-5 experience bundles to the recipient after they claim the certificate.
    *   Recipient Choice: Allow the recipient to select their preferred bundle.
    *   Automated Fulfillment:  Automatically issue gift cards, subscription codes, or booking confirmations based on the selected bundle.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Generation):**

```
function generate_bundle(recipient_id, certificate_amount):
  preferences = get_recipient_preferences(recipient_id)
  bundle_candidates = []

  for service in available_services:
    if service.category in preferences.top_categories:
      price = service.get_best_price(certificate_amount)
      if price <= certificate_amount:
        bundle_candidates.append({
          "service": service,
          "price": price,
          "description": service.get_bundle_description()
        })

  # Sort candidates based on preference weight and value
  bundle_candidates.sort(key=lambda x: (preferences.weight[x["service"].category] * -1), (certificate_amount - x["price"]))
  
  return bundle_candidates[:3] # Return top 3 bundles
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalability
*   Machine learning platform (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for preference inference
*   API integrations with various service providers
*   Secure data storage and processing
*   Responsive web/mobile interface for bundle presentation
