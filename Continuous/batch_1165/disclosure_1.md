## Adaptive Environmental Sonification Based on Device History & User Context

**Concept:** Extend the device resolution system to *proactively* provide auditory feedback (sonification) about device states and predicted user needs, going beyond simple voice confirmations. This aims to create a more intuitive and ambient smart-home experience. The system leverages historical device usage, user routines, and real-time context to generate adaptive soundscapes.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Device State Data: Real-time status of all connected devices (on/off, temperature, brightness, etc.).
    *   Historical Usage Data:  Records of device activations, times of day, user initiating the action (if discernible), and any associated user utterance.
    *   User Calendar/Schedule: Integration with user's calendar and/or learned routines to anticipate needs (e.g., coffee maker starting before wake-up time).
    *   Environmental Sensors: Data from sensors like ambient light, temperature, and humidity.
    *   Voice Analysis:  Analysis of user utterances *before* command execution to detect emotional state or inferred intent.
*   **Sonification Engine:**
    *   Sound Palette: A library of abstract and natural sounds categorized by device type, function, and emotional valence.  (e.g., a subtle rising tone for increasing brightness, a gentle bubbling sound for coffee brewing, a calming ambient pad for a dimmed bedroom).
    *   Mapping Algorithm: Maps device states, historical data, and user context to appropriate sounds from the sound palette. This is the core intelligence.
    *   Spatial Audio Processing:  Utilizes spatial audio techniques (e.g., HRTF filtering) to create the illusion that sounds are emanating from the physical location of the devices.
*   **Adaptive Logic:**
    *   Predictive Sonification: Based on historical data and user routines, the system *anticipates* device activations and plays subtle sounds *before* the action occurs. (e.g., a faint "warming" sound 1 minute before the coffee maker starts).
    *   Contextual Sonification: The intensity and timbre of the sounds adjust based on the user's current context. (e.g., a louder, more urgent sound for a security alert, a softer, more relaxing sound for a bedtime routine).
    *   Emotional Sonification:  Integrates voice analysis data to adjust the emotional tone of the sounds. (e.g., a brighter, more upbeat sound if the user sounds happy, a calmer, more soothing sound if the user sounds stressed).
    *   Learning Algorithm: Utilizes machine learning (reinforcement learning) to optimize the sonification parameters based on user feedback. (e.g., if the user consistently cancels a predicted action, the system learns to reduce the frequency of that prediction).
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Voice-enabled device with a high-quality speaker.
    *   Network connectivity to access device state data and user calendar/schedule.
    *   Array of environmental sensors (optional).

**Pseudocode (Sonification Engine):**

```
function generateSonification(deviceState, historicalData, userContext):
  // 1. Determine Base Sound
  baseSound = selectBaseSound(deviceState.deviceType, deviceState.function)

  // 2. Apply Historical Modifiers
  historicalModifier = calculateHistoricalModifier(historicalData)
  baseSound.intensity = baseSound.intensity * historicalModifier.frequency
  baseSound.timbre = adjustTimbre(baseSound.timbre, historicalModifier.preference)

  // 3. Apply Contextual Modifiers
  contextModifier = createContextModifier(userContext)
  baseSound.volume = adjustVolume(baseSound.volume, contextModifier.ambientLevel)
  baseSound.pan = setPan(contextModifier.location)

  // 4. Apply Emotional Modifiers
  emotionalModifier = calculateEmotionalModifier(userContext.voiceAnalysis)
  baseSound.pitch = adjustPitch(baseSound.pitch, emotionalModifier.valence)

  // 5. Spatialization
  spatializedSound = applySpatialAudio(baseSound, deviceLocation)

  // 6. Play Sound
  playSound(spatializedSound)
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple confirmation sounds or alerts. It aims to create a subtle, ambient soundscape that provides information and anticipates needs without being intrusive. The integration of emotional analysis and predictive sonification is a key differentiator. It's an active, anticipatory system, rather than a reactive one.
