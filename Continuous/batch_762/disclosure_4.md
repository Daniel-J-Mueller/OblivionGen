## Data Provenance & Immutability Chains for On-Demand Execution

**Concept:** Extend the data sharing paradigm to incorporate verifiable data provenance and immutability. This moves beyond simply caching data *versions* to creating an auditable, tamper-proof chain of transformations applied to data across multiple function executions.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Provenance Metadata:**

*   Each data object (or data set) stored within the system includes a "provenance header". This header is cryptographically signed by the function instance that *created* or *first authored* the data.
*   The provenance header contains:
    *   Function ID: Unique identifier of the function that authored the data.
    *   Timestamp: Time of data creation/authoring.
    *   Hashing Algorithm: Algorithm used to generate the data hash.
    *   Data Hash: Cryptographic hash of the data itself (e.g., SHA-256).
    *   Parent Data Reference(s):  References (IDs) to any prior data objects upon which this data object was based (forming a directed acyclic graph - DAG).
    *   Transformation Description: A brief text description of the transformation applied (e.g., "scaled pixel values", "applied filter", "calculated average").
*   The provenance header is immutable – it cannot be altered after creation.

**2. Immutable Data Storage:**

*   A dedicated "Immutable Data Store" is introduced.  Once a data object is stored in this store, it cannot be modified or deleted.  Any "updates" create *new* data objects with a new provenance header linked to the previous version.

**3. Execution Chain Tracking:**

*   Each function invocation records a “execution chain”. This chain tracks the data objects read, the data objects written, and the function IDs involved in each step.
*   The execution chain is cryptographically linked to the provenance headers of the data objects read and written.

**4. Data Access & Verification:**

*   When a function requests a data object, the system *verifies* the provenance header.  This involves:
    *   Checking the cryptographic signature against the originating function ID.
    *   Tracing the lineage of the data object through the DAG of parent data references.
    *   Validating the transformation descriptions to ensure they are logically consistent.
*   If any verification fails, access is denied, and an error is logged.

**5. Pseudocode (Data Access)**

```pseudocode
function getData(dataReference):
  dataObject = dataStore.retrieve(dataReference)
  if dataObject == null:
    return error("Data not found")

  verificationResult = verifyProvenance(dataObject)

  if verificationResult == failure:
    logError(verificationResult.errorMessage)
    return error("Data provenance verification failed")

  return dataObject

function verifyProvenance(dataObject):
  // 1. Verify signature
  if not verifySignature(dataObject.signature, dataObject.authoringFunctionId):
    return failure("Invalid Signature")

  // 2. Trace lineage (DAG traversal)
  parentDataObjects = []
  for parentReference in dataObject.parentDataReferences:
    parent = getData(parentReference)
    if parent == null:
      return failure("Missing Parent Data")
    parentDataObjects.append(parent)

  // 3. Check transformation consistency (simplification for example)
  if transformationDescription != "expected transformation based on parents":
    return failure("Transformation Inconsistent")

  return success
```

**6. API Extensions**

*   `createData(data, transformationDescription)`: Creates new immutable data with specified transformation.
*   `getDataProvenance(dataReference)`: Returns the provenance header for a data object.
*   `traceDataLineage(dataReference)`:  Returns the complete lineage (DAG) of a data object.

**Rationale:**

This system enables:

*   **Data Integrity:** Guarantees that data has not been tampered with.
*   **Auditability:** Provides a complete audit trail of data transformations.
*   **Reproducibility:** Enables exact replication of results by tracing data lineage.
*   **Trust & Accountability:**  Increases trust in data by establishing clear accountability for data transformations.
*   **AI/ML Model Debugging:** Facilitates debugging of AI/ML models by enabling tracing of data used for training and inference.
