## Adaptive Behavioral Drift Detection & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Expand the core principle of detecting anomalous *types* of characteristics to encompass continuous behavioral drift, not just anomaly *detection*, but *prediction* of changing user/system behavior. This moves beyond static thresholds to dynamic, learned models of expected behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data representing user/system interactions. Examples: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, API call frequency, resource utilization, network traffic patterns, application usage sequences.
*   **Feature Extraction:**  Develop a modular feature extraction pipeline. Features should include:
    *   **Statistical:** Mean, standard deviation, entropy, skewness, kurtosis of time-series data.
    *   **Frequency Domain:** Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) coefficients for detecting cyclical patterns.
    *   **Sequential:** N-gram analysis of interaction sequences.  (e.g., sequence of API calls, pages visited).
    *   **Contextual:** Integrate external data sources (time of day, location, user role, device type) as contextual features.
*   **Characteristic Type Definition:**  Instead of pre-defined characteristics, employ dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to automatically discover inherent “characteristic types” within the feature space.  These become the basis for behavioral modeling.

**2.  Behavioral Model Creation & Adaptation:**

*   **Model Selection:** Employ a hybrid approach:
    *   **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM):** To model the distribution of characteristic types in normal behavior.  Each characteristic type represents a Gaussian component.
    *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) - LSTM/GRU:**  To capture temporal dependencies and sequential patterns in behavior.
*   **Dynamic Thresholding:**  Instead of static thresholds, calculate dynamic thresholds based on the standard deviation of the GMM distribution *and* the predicted output of the RNN.  A higher standard deviation indicates greater variability, requiring a wider threshold. RNN output provides a probability distribution for expected behavior.
*   **Continual Learning:** Implement a continual learning strategy (e.g., Elastic Weight Consolidation or Synaptic Intelligence) to allow the model to adapt to evolving behavior without catastrophic forgetting.  A 'drift detection' mechanism monitors the model's performance, triggering re-training or adaptation when significant drift is detected.

**3. Drift Prediction & Alerting:**

*   **Drift Score:** Calculate a "drift score" based on the following:
    *   **Prediction Error:**  The difference between the predicted behavior (from the RNN) and the observed behavior.
    *   **GMM Likelihood:** The likelihood of the observed behavior under the GMM distribution. Lower likelihood suggests deviation from normal behavior.
    *   **Anomaly Score:** A combination of prediction error, GMM likelihood, and the magnitude of the deviation.
*   **Alerting Mechanism:** Trigger alerts when the drift score exceeds a predefined threshold.  Alert severity should be proportional to the drift score.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**  Use the learned behavioral models to predict future behavior.  Identify potentially anomalous behaviors *before* they occur.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Ingestion Layer:**  Collects and preprocesses data from various sources.
*   **Feature Extraction Layer:** Extracts relevant features from the data.
*   **Model Training & Adaptation Layer:** Trains and adapts the behavioral models.
*   **Anomaly Detection & Prediction Layer:** Detects and predicts anomalous behaviors.
*   **Alerting & Visualization Layer:**  Generates alerts and visualizes the detected anomalies.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```pseudocode
function detect_anomaly(current_features):
  # Calculate GMM likelihood
  gmm_likelihood = calculate_gmm_likelihood(current_features, gmm_model)

  # Predict behavior using RNN
  rnn_prediction = predict_behavior(current_features, rnn_model)

  # Calculate prediction error
  prediction_error = calculate_prediction_error(current_features, rnn_prediction)

  # Calculate anomaly score
  anomaly_score = (1 - gmm_likelihood) + prediction_error

  # Check if anomaly score exceeds threshold
  if anomaly_score > anomaly_threshold:
    return True  # Anomaly detected
  else:
    return False # No anomaly detected
```
