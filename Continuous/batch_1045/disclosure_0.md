## Adaptive Proactive Notification System – “Neighborhood Watch AI”

**System Overview:** This system expands on the video sharing concept by incorporating AI-driven predictive analysis and automated, tiered notification levels based on perceived threat and neighbor-defined sensitivity.  It moves beyond simple sharing *after* an event to proactive alerts *before* escalation.

**Core Components:**

*   **AI Threat Assessment Module:**  Analyzes video feeds in real-time, classifying objects, actions, and anomalies.  Utilizes a multi-tiered system:
    *   **Tier 1 (Normal):**  Routine activity (people walking, cars driving). No alerts. Data logged for trend analysis.
    *   **Tier 2 (Potential Concern):**  Unusual activity (person loitering, vehicle slowing/stopping, unknown object left unattended).  Triggers localized, low-priority notifications to opted-in neighbors within a defined radius.
    *   **Tier 3 (Elevated Threat):**  Suspicious actions (attempted entry, rapid approach, obscured face).  Sends immediate, high-priority notifications *with* video clip to opted-in neighbors and optionally to a pre-defined emergency contact list.
    *   **Tier 4 (Critical Threat):**  Confirmed breach or violent act.  Automatic emergency service dispatch (optional, user configurable).

*   **Neighbor Sensitivity Profiles:**  Users define their preferred notification level based on factors like:
    *   **Activity Type:**  (e.g., “Notify me about package deliveries,” “Ignore cats,” “Alert me to all vehicle activity”).
    *   **Time of Day:**  (e.g., “More sensitive at night,” “Less sensitive during business hours”).
    *   **Geographic Radius:** User-adjustable notification range.
    *   **Notification Priority:** User-defined preference of how urgent the notification appears (e.g., silent, banner, sound).

*   **Distributed Notification Network:**  Utilizes a mesh network approach (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Direct) to ensure notifications reach neighbors even with internet outages. Nodes are the A/V devices themselves, relaying messages.

*   **Anonymous Reporting Feature:** Allows neighbors to anonymously flag suspicious activity observed *outside* the range of their own cameras, contributing to a broader community awareness network.

**Pseudocode – AI Threat Assessment Module:**

```
FUNCTION AnalyzeFrame(frameData)
  // Object Detection (Using pre-trained model)
  objects = DetectObjects(frameData)

  // Action Recognition (Using pre-trained model)
  actions = RecognizeActions(objects)

  // Anomaly Detection
  IF (actions CONTAINS "loitering" AND timeOfDay == "night") THEN
    threatLevel = 2
  ELSE IF (actions CONTAINS "attemptedEntry") THEN
    threatLevel = 3
  ELSE IF (objects CONTAINS "obscuredFace" AND actions CONTAINS "rapidApproach") THEN
    threatLevel = 3
  ELSE
    threatLevel = 1

  RETURN threatLevel
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION DetermineNotification(threatLevel, userSensitivity)
  IF (threatLevel >= userSensitivity) THEN
    SendNotification(videoClip, threatLevel)
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Standard A/V devices (doorbells, security cameras) with sufficient processing power for edge AI.
*   Local processing prioritized. Cloud connectivity for model updates and data aggregation.
*   Mesh networking capability built into devices.

**Software Considerations:**

*   Secure communication protocols.
*   User-friendly mobile app for configuration and notification management.
*   Privacy controls (data anonymization, consent management).
*   Over-the-air software updates.
