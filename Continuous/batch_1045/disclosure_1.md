## Adaptive Traffic Shaping via Predictive Emulation

**Concept:** Extend the emulation mode to proactively *shape* traffic flows before they reach a potentially faulty device, rather than merely observing/dropping traffic *after* it arrives. This utilizes predictive analysis of network telemetry to anticipate potential congestion or failure points *before* they manifest, allowing for preemptive traffic rerouting via a dynamically adjusted emulation environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE)**:
    *   Input: Real-time network telemetry data (bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss, device CPU/memory utilization, routing table updates) from network management systems. Historical data storage (minimum 30 days).
    *   Processing: Machine learning algorithms (time series analysis, anomaly detection, regression models) to predict potential congestion points and device failures. Scoring system to assess risk level for each network device/link. Output: Predicted congestion maps & failure probabilities (updated every 5 seconds).
*   **Component 2: Dynamic Emulation Controller (DEC)**:
    *   Input: Risk assessment data from PAE. Current network topology (discovered via standard network mapping protocols).  Configuration parameters defining acceptable performance thresholds.
    *   Processing: Based on the risk assessment, DEC identifies critical paths and devices requiring pre-emptive traffic shaping. Creates a customized emulation environment for those devices, including:
        *   Traffic mirroring and prioritization rules.
        *   Synthetic traffic generation to stress-test paths.
        *   Virtual bandwidth limitations to simulate congestion.
        *   Dynamic rerouting rules to divert traffic around potentially problematic links.
    *   Output:  Configuration commands for the network devices (routers, switches) implementing the traffic shaping rules.  Updates to the virtual RIB/FIB tables.
*   **Component 3:  Emulation-Aware Data Plane (EADP)**:
    *   Integration with existing network device data planes (ASICs, NPUs).
    *   Hardware acceleration for traffic shaping and rerouting operations.
    *   Telemetry reporting of emulated traffic flows (bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss).
    *   Support for multiple concurrent emulation environments.

**Pseudocode (DEC – Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION analyzeNetwork(telemetryData):
  riskMap = PAE.predictRisk(telemetryData)
  RETURN riskMap

FUNCTION createEmulationEnvironment(riskMap, device):
  IF riskMap[device] > threshold:
    emulationConfig = {
      priorityRoutes = findCriticalPaths(device),
      bandwidthLimit = calculateBandwidthLimit(device, riskMap[device]),
      syntheticTrafficRate = generateSyntheticTrafficRate(device, riskMap[device])
    }
    updateVirtualRIB(emulationConfig)
    sendConfigurationToDevice(emulationConfig)
    RETURN TRUE
  ELSE:
    RETURN FALSE

LOOP:
  telemetryData = collectNetworkTelemetry()
  riskMap = analyzeNetwork(telemetryData)
  FOR each device IN network:
    createEmulationEnvironment(riskMap, device)
  SLEEP(5 seconds)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond passive emulation for testing to *proactive* traffic shaping, leveraging predictive analytics to mitigate network issues *before* they occur. It’s not simply about isolating a faulty device, but about improving overall network resilience and performance.  Existing emulation solutions are largely reactive and focused on post-failure analysis. This is preventative.
