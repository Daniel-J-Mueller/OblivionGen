## Dynamic Haptic Texture Mapping

**Concept:** An electronic device incorporating a dynamically adjustable surface texture achieved through an array of micro-actuated pins controlled by an internal processing unit. This goes beyond simple vibration; it *creates* tactile sensations mimicking various materials and shapes on demand.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Integration:** Seamless integration with existing display technologies (LCD, OLED, etc.). The haptic layer would be overlaid or integrated *into* the display stack.
*   **Actuator Array:** A grid of MEMS-based micro-actuators (pins). Density: minimum 100 actuators per square inch, scalable to 500+ for high-resolution textures.
*   **Pin Travel:** Each pin capable of independent vertical travel of 0-1mm. Material: shape-memory alloy or piezoelectric material for precise control and responsiveness.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Input:** Receives texture data from internal applications or external sources (e.g., a connected computer, streamed data). Texture data represented as a heightmap or similar format.
    *   **Processing:** Dedicated processor analyzes texture data and generates control signals for each actuator. Algorithms for smoothing, edge detection, and pattern generation. Real-time processing capability for dynamic textures.
    *   **Actuator Drivers:** Individual drivers for each actuator, providing precise voltage/current control.
*   **Material Layer:** A thin, flexible layer covering the actuator array. Material: biocompatible polymer with high friction coefficient and durability. May incorporate micro-channels for fluid delivery (see 'Adaptive Friction' below).
*   **Power Requirements:** Low-power operation, targeting <5W for typical use. Energy harvesting from device movement or ambient light optional.

**Innovation Details:**

1.  **Adaptive Friction:** Integrate microfluidic channels within the material layer. By selectively delivering small amounts of fluid (e.g., silicone oil) to certain areas, dynamically adjust the friction coefficient of the surface. This allows simulating surfaces that are slippery, sticky, or rough.

    *   Pseudocode:

        ```
        function adjustFriction(x, y, frictionLevel):
            if frictionLevel > 0:
                activateMicroPump(x, y)
                pumpFluid(amount = frictionLevel * fluidScaleFactor)
            else:
                deactivateMicroPump(x, y)
                removeExcessFluid(x, y)
        ```

2.  **Shape Simulation:** Beyond texture, utilize the actuator array to create *temporary* 3D shapes. By strategically raising/lowering actuators, simulate the feel of buttons, knobs, or other physical controls directly on the device's surface.

    *   Pseudocode:

        ```
        function createShape(shapeData):
            for each actuator in actuatorArray:
                height = shapeData.getHeight(actuator.x, actuator.y)
                actuator.setPosition(height)
        ```

3.  **Multi-Layered Textures:** Use multiple layers of actuators with different characteristics (e.g., varying pin heights, materials). This allows creating complex textures with both fine details and coarse features.

4.  **Haptic Language:** Develop a system for encoding tactile information. Allow users to "write" haptic messages that can be transmitted to other compatible devices, enabling a new form of communication.
