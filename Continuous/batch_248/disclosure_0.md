## Dynamic Scene Importance via Multi-Modal Sentiment & Physiological Response Correlation

**Concept:** Expand beyond textual analysis of closed captions to incorporate real-time physiological data (heart rate, skin conductance, facial expressions) from viewers *while* they watch the video, correlated with sentiment analysis of both captions *and* audio. This creates a dynamic, personalized "importance map" of scenes.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition Layer:**

*   **Physiological Sensor Integration:** Support for various wearable sensors (smartwatches, chest straps, EEG headsets, facial expression tracking via webcam). Standardized data ingestion API.
*   **Video/Audio Input:** Accepts standard video/audio files or streaming sources.
*   **Caption Data:** Extracts closed caption data as per the provided patent.
*   **Audio Analysis:**  Performs sentiment analysis on the audio track (speech tone, music mood, sound effects) using existing or newly developed models.  Output: Sentiment score (-1 to 1) per audio segment.

**2.  Real-Time Processing Engine:**

*   **Segmentation:** Divides video into scenes using scene change detection (as described in the source patent).  Also, break down each scene into smaller segments (e.g., 5-second intervals).
*   **Data Synchronization:**  Time-stamps all data streams (video frames, caption segments, audio segments, physiological data) to a common timeline.
*   **Physiological Feature Extraction:**  Extract key physiological features:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
    *   Skin Conductance Level (SCL)
    *   Facial Action Units (FAUs - from facial expression analysis)
*   **Sentiment Fusion:** Combines sentiment scores from captions, audio, and physiological responses.  Weighted averaging or machine learning models to determine optimal weighting.  Example:
    *   `CombinedSentiment = (CaptionSentiment * 0.4) + (AudioSentiment * 0.3) + (PhysiologicalSentiment * 0.3)`
    *   `PhysiologicalSentiment` derived from HRV, SCL, and FAUs (e.g., higher arousal = more positive/negative sentiment depending on context).
*   **Dynamic Importance Scoring:**  Assigns an "importance score" to each scene segment based on `CombinedSentiment`. Higher absolute value of `CombinedSentiment` = higher importance.  Apply a smoothing filter to reduce noise.
*   **Personalization:** Stores viewer-specific physiological data and adapts the weighting of sentiment components for each user.

**3.  Output & Visualization:**

*   **Importance Map:** Generates a visual "importance map" overlaid on the video timeline, highlighting scenes with high importance scores.
*   **Data Export:**  Provides options to export importance scores, physiological data, and segmented video clips.
*   **API Access:** Allows third-party applications to access the dynamic importance data.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
For each viewer:
  Load/Collect baseline physiological data
  For each video:
    Segment video into scenes
    For each scene:
      For each segment within scene:
        Extract caption data
        Perform audio sentiment analysis
        Collect physiological data from viewer
        Calculate CombinedSentiment
        Assign ImportanceScore to segment
      Calculate SceneImportance = Average(ImportanceScore of segments in scene)
    Generate Importance Map for video
    Store viewer data and Importance Map
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond static textual analysis to incorporate dynamic, personalized physiological data, providing a more nuanced and accurate assessment of scene importance.  Potential applications: personalized video recommendations, adaptive storytelling, targeted advertising, and understanding emotional responses to media.
