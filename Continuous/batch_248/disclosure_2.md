## Adaptive Specification Synthesis for Concurrent Systems

**Concept:** The patent focuses on verifying functional programming features *by relating them to imperative equivalents*. This inspires a system that proactively *generates* specifications – both functional *and* imperative – during development, adapting them based on detected concurrency patterns.  Instead of verifying against a pre-existing specification, the system *creates* and *refines* them, specializing based on runtime behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Component: Concurrent Pattern Detector (CPD)**

   *   **Input:** Program source code (multi-language support ideal - Python, Java, C++).  Real-time execution traces (optional, for refinement).
   *   **Output:** A graph representing detected concurrency patterns. Nodes are code blocks (functions, loops, statements).  Edges represent data dependencies, control flow, and potential race conditions.  Edge attributes include:
        *   `access_type`: (read, write, read-write)
        *   `shared_resource`: (variable name, memory address)
        *   `concurrency_level`: (estimated number of threads accessing the resource)
        *   `synchronization_mechanism`: (lock, semaphore, atomic operation - if present)

**2. Component: Specification Generator (SG)**

   *   **Input:** Concurrency pattern graph (from CPD), user-defined high-level intent (e.g., “calculate average temperature”, “process image data”).
   *   **Output:** A pair of specifications:
        *   **Functional Specification:** A set of equations or relations defining the desired behavior using a functional programming style (e.g., using a list comprehension, a map/reduce operation).  This is intended to be concise and abstract.
        *   **Imperative Specification:** A corresponding imperative implementation (e.g., a C++ code snippet with explicit locks and synchronization).  This is derived from the functional spec but optimized for performance and resource constraints.
   *   **Derivation Process:**
        1.  **Functional Spec Generation:** Based on user intent and concurrency pattern, generate a high-level functional spec using techniques like program synthesis or template instantiation.  The spec should capture the core logic without specifying how it is implemented.
        2.  **Concurrency Aware Partitioning:** Partition the functional spec into independent sub-tasks that can be executed concurrently. This partitioning is guided by the concurrency pattern graph.
        3.  **Imperative Spec Synthesis:** For each sub-task, generate an imperative implementation.  This involves:
            *   Allocating memory for shared resources.
            *   Adding synchronization primitives (locks, semaphores) based on the access types and concurrency levels in the concurrency pattern graph.
            *   Optimizing the code for performance.

**3. Component: Adaptive Refinement Engine (ARE)**

   *   **Input:** Program source code, execution traces, functional and imperative specifications.
   *   **Output:** Refined functional and imperative specifications.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  **Monitor Execution:** Collect execution traces and identify deviations from expected behavior.
        2.  **Identify Root Cause:** Analyze execution traces to pinpoint the source of errors (e.g., race conditions, deadlocks).
        3.  **Refine Specifications:**
            *   **Functional Spec:**  Update the functional spec to reflect the observed behavior. This might involve adding new constraints or relaxing existing ones.
            *   **Imperative Spec:** Modify the imperative spec to address the root cause of the errors. This might involve adding new synchronization primitives, changing the order of operations, or using different data structures. The modification is driven by formal verification.

**Pseudocode (ARE - Refinement Cycle):**

```
while (program_running):
    execution_trace = collect_execution_trace()
    error_detected = analyze_trace(execution_trace)
    if (error_detected):
        root_cause = identify_root_cause(error_detected, execution_trace)
        if (root_cause == "race_condition"):
            add_lock(imperative_spec, shared_resource)
            update_functional_spec_with_lock_constraint(functional_spec, shared_resource)
        elif (root_cause == "deadlock"):
            reorder_operations(imperative_spec, potential_deadlock_cycle)
            update_functional_spec_with_operation_order_constraint(functional_spec, operation_order)
        else:
            // Other error handling
            pass
    else:
        // No errors detected
        pass
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Specification Generation:**  Instead of verifying against a pre-defined spec, the system *creates* specifications during development.
*   **Concurrency-Awareness:** The system explicitly models concurrency patterns and uses this information to generate accurate specifications.
*   **Adaptive Refinement:** The system monitors execution and refines specifications based on observed behavior.
*   **Formal Verification Integration:** Verification occurs *during* refinement, ensuring the modifications preserve the program's correctness.
