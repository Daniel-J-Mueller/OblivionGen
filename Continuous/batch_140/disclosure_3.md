## Dynamic Trust Web for IoT Device Authentication

**Concept:** Extend the bootstrapping concept to create a localized, dynamic trust web between IoT devices, leveraging proximity and temporary credentials for streamlined authentication *without* reliance on a central authority after initial setup. Think of it as a localized 'handshake' protocol that builds trust incrementally.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device Roles:**

*   **Anchor Device:** A trusted device (e.g., a user's smartphone, a dedicated hub) that initiates the trust web and manages initial authentication. It *must* support multi-factor authentication.
*   **Peripheral Device:**  An IoT device seeking access to resources or communication within the trust web (e.g., smart lock, sensor). May or may not support MFA.
*   **Relay Device:**  An intermediate device that facilitates communication and trust propagation between Anchor and Peripheral devices.

**2. Trust Establishment Protocol:**

1.  **Initial Bootstrap:**  The Peripheral Device is initially authenticated by the Anchor Device using MFA (as in the provided patent). This establishes a baseline trust and generates a unique "Web ID" for the Peripheral. This Web ID is cryptographically tied to the device’s hardware signature.

2.  **Proximity Detection:** Devices use Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons or similar short-range communication to detect nearby devices with established Web IDs.

3.  **Trust Propagation (Relay-Assisted):** If a Peripheral Device is outside direct range of the Anchor, a Relay Device (already trusted by the Anchor) facilitates trust propagation. The Relay verifies the Peripheral’s Web ID and proximity, then transmits a “Temporary Access Token” (TAT) signed by the Relay. This TAT includes a timestamp and device identifiers.

4.  **Dynamic Trust Scoring:** Each device maintains a "Trust Score" for other devices within the web. The score is calculated based on:
    *   Proximity: Closer proximity = higher score.
    *   TAT Validity: Recent and valid TATs = higher score.
    *   Communication Frequency: Frequent and successful communication = higher score.
    *   Relay Chain Length: Shorter relay chains (direct connection to Anchor preferred) = higher score.

5.  **Access Control:**  Devices grant access based on Trust Scores. A configurable threshold determines whether access is granted.  Higher sensitivity (higher threshold) improves security, but reduces usability.

**3.  Credential Management:**

*   TATs are short-lived (e.g., 5-15 minutes).
*   TATs are digitally signed using a lightweight cryptographic algorithm (e.g., Ed25519).
*   A rolling revocation list of compromised Web IDs is distributed among Anchor and Relay devices.

**4.  System Components:**

*   **Anchor Application:**  Runs on the Anchor Device. Manages user authentication, Web ID registration, revocation list updates, and Trust Score configuration.
*   **Relay Agent:** Runs on Relay Devices. Detects nearby devices, verifies Web IDs, generates/validates TATs, and forwards communication.
*   **Peripheral Agent:** Runs on Peripheral Devices.  Advertises Web ID, requests TATs, and authenticates with other devices.

**5.  Pseudocode (Peripheral Agent - Access Request):**

```
function requestAccess(resource, targetDevice):
  if (proximityDetected(targetDevice)):
    tat = requestTemporaryAccessToken(targetDevice)
    if (isValidTAT(tat)):
      accessGranted = verifyAccess(resource, tat)
      return accessGranted
    else:
      log("Invalid TAT")
      return false
  else:
    log("Target device not in range")
    return false

function requestTemporaryAccessToken(targetDevice):
  // BLE broadcast request for TAT
  // Receive signed TAT from targetDevice
  return tat

function isValidTAT(tat):
  // Verify digital signature
  // Check timestamp
  // Check device identifiers
  return isValid
```

**6.  Security Considerations:**

*   Reliance on BLE proximity.  Range spoofing is a potential attack vector.  Mitigation:  Triangulation using multiple relays.
*   Compromised Relay Device. Mitigation:  Regular key rotation for relays, reputation system for relays.
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Mitigation: Rate limiting of access requests.
