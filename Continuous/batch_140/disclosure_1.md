## Autonomous Mobile Vehicle Swarm - Predictive Infrastructure Maintenance

**System Specs:**

*   **Vehicle Type:** Primarily small, hexacopter drones (500g - 1kg) for indoor/confined space access, supplemented by ground-based automated mobile robots (AMRs) for larger areas and heavier payloads.
*   **Sensor Suite (Drone):**
    *   High-resolution RGB camera (4K video)
    *   Thermal camera
    *   LiDAR (short-range, for precise mapping & obstacle avoidance)
    *   Microphone array (for sound anomaly detection)
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, VOCs)
    *   Current sensors (for electrical component monitoring)
*   **Sensor Suite (AMR):**
    *   Same as drone, plus:
    *   Ultrasonic sensors (for close-range detection)
    *   Force/torque sensors (for manipulation)
*   **Communication:** Dedicated, mesh network utilizing 60GHz millimeter wave for high bandwidth, low latency communication between vehicles and the central system. Redundancy via 2.4/5GHz Wi-Fi as backup.
*   **Power:** Drone – hot-swappable battery packs, inductive charging at designated 'recovery locations'. AMR – standard battery with automated docking/charging stations.
*   **Central System:** Cloud-based AI platform for data analysis, predictive modeling, and swarm control.

**Innovation Detail:**

The system proactively identifies potential infrastructure failures *before* they occur, and autonomously addresses them, shifting from reactive coverage to *preventative maintenance*.

1.  **Data Acquisition & Baseline Establishment:**
    *   Swarm autonomously maps the facility, creating a 3D digital twin.
    *   Collects baseline data on all monitored infrastructure components (lighting, network access points, HVAC, electrical panels etc.) using sensor suites. Data points include:
        *   Lighting: luminance, flicker rate, energy consumption.
        *   Network: signal strength, latency, bandwidth utilization, error rates.
        *   HVAC: temperature, airflow, filter status, energy consumption.
        *   Electrical: voltage, current, temperature, harmonic distortion.
2.  **Predictive Modeling & Anomaly Detection:**
    *   AI algorithms analyze historical data and real-time sensor readings.
    *   Machine learning models predict potential failures based on subtle anomalies.
        *   Example: A slight increase in temperature and harmonic distortion in an electrical panel *before* a circuit breaker trips.
        *   Example: A gradual decrease in luminance and increase in flicker rate in a light fixture *before* burnout.
3.  **Autonomous Remediation:**
    *   When a potential failure is predicted, the system dispatches drones or AMRs to perform preventative maintenance.
        *   **Lighting:** Replace failing lights *before* they burn out.
        *   **Network:** Optimize wireless signal coverage or replace failing access points.
        *   **HVAC:** Clean or replace filters, adjust airflow, detect leaks.
        *   **Electrical:** Tighten connections, identify overheating components, schedule preventative maintenance.
    *   AMRs can perform minor repairs or deploy temporary solutions (e.g., deploying a mobile cooling unit near an overheating server rack).
4.  **Swarm Coordination & Task Allocation:**
    *   AI-powered swarm intelligence algorithms optimize task allocation and route planning.
    *   Vehicles collaborate to share data and resources, ensuring efficient coverage and responsiveness.
    *   Dynamic rerouting in case of obstacles or changing conditions.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Coordination):**

```
// Function: allocate_tasks
// Input: List of potential maintenance tasks, List of available vehicles
// Output: Assigned tasks for each vehicle

function allocate_tasks(tasks, vehicles) {
    for each task in tasks {
        best_vehicle = null
        min_distance = infinity

        for each vehicle in vehicles {
            distance = calculate_distance(vehicle.location, task.location)

            if (distance < min_distance && vehicle.available) {
                min_distance = distance
                best_vehicle = vehicle
            }
        }

        if (best_vehicle != null) {
            assign_task(best_vehicle, task)
            best_vehicle.available = false
        }
    }
}

// Function: monitor_vehicle_status
// Input: Vehicle ID
// Output: Vehicle status (available, busy, charging, offline)

function monitor_vehicle_status(vehicle_id) {
    // Check battery level, task status, communication status
    if (battery_level < 20%) {
        return "charging"
    } else if (task_in_progress) {
        return "busy"
    } else if (communication_lost) {
        return "offline"
    } else {
        return "available"
    }
}

// Continuous loop:
while (true) {
    // Detect new maintenance tasks
    new_tasks = detect_new_tasks()

    // Allocate tasks to available vehicles
    allocate_tasks(new_tasks, vehicles)

    // Monitor vehicle status
    for each vehicle in vehicles {
        status = monitor_vehicle_status(vehicle.id)
        update_vehicle_status(vehicle, status)
    }

    // Adjust task allocation based on vehicle status
    adjust_allocation()
