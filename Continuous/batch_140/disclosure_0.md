## Dynamic Contextual Bookmarks & "Flow State" Reading

**Concept:** Expanding beyond static bookmarks, this system creates dynamic, AI-assisted contextual bookmarks that anticipate reader needs and facilitate a “flow state” reading experience. It builds upon the existing bookmark navigation but introduces layers of information association and proactive suggestion.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structure: "Contextual Bookmark"**

*   **Bookmark ID:** Unique identifier.
*   **Page Number:** Standard page reference.
*   **Timestamp:** When the bookmark was created/modified.
*   **User Tag:** Free-form text tag provided by the user.
*   **AI-Generated Summary:** A short (1-3 sentence) summary of the content on that page, generated using an onboard or cloud-based NLP model.
*   **Entity Recognition:** List of key entities (people, places, concepts) identified on the page.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Sentiment score for the content on the page.
*   **Related Concepts:** List of concepts related to the page’s content (linked to a knowledge graph).
*   **Connection Strength:**  A score representing how strongly the current page connects to other pages within the book, based on entity overlap, concept similarity, and sentiment.

**2. Proactive Bookmark Suggestions:**

*   **“Reading Flow” Algorithm:** Tracks reader progress and predicts potential points of confusion or interest.
*   **AI-Driven Suggestions:** Based on the “Reading Flow”, the system proactively suggests creating contextual bookmarks at points where the reader might want to revisit the content. This could be triggered by:
    *   Introduction of a new character.
    *   A complex concept.
    *   A shift in narrative tone.
    *   Detection of a potentially confusing passage.
*   **Suggestion Display:** A non-intrusive visual cue on the screen (e.g., a glowing highlight) indicates a suggested bookmark point.  The reader can accept or dismiss the suggestion.

**3. Dynamic Bookmark Organization:**

*   **"Bookmark Graph":**  Bookmarks are not just a linear list. They are represented as nodes in a graph, with connections between nodes based on shared entities, concepts, or sentiment.
*   **Visual Exploration:**  The reader can explore their bookmarks visually, zooming in on clusters of related bookmarks.
*   **"Concept Trails":**  The system can generate a “Concept Trail” – a sequence of bookmarks connected by a specific concept – allowing the reader to quickly revisit all passages related to that concept.
*    **“Sentiment Journeys”:**  Allowing readers to follow the emotional arc of a character or storyline by navigating bookmarks based on sentiment score.

**4.  "Flow State" Mode:**

*   **Minimization of UI:** In “Flow State” mode, the UI is minimized to reduce distractions.
*   **Adaptive Suggestions:**  Proactive bookmark suggestions become more subtle and infrequent, only appearing when the reader is likely to benefit from them.
*   **Haptic Feedback:**  Subtle haptic feedback can be used to signal important events or suggest potential bookmark points.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Suggestion Logic):**

```
function suggestBookmark(currentPage, readingHistory) {
  pageSummary = generateAISummary(currentPage);
  pageEntities = extractEntities(currentPage);

  // Check for new entities not seen in recent reading history
  newEntities = pageEntities - readingHistory.entities;

  if (newEntities.length > 0) {
    displayBookmarkSuggestion();
  }

  // Check for significant sentiment shift
  currentSentiment = analyzeSentiment(currentPage);
  previousSentiment = readingHistory.lastSentiment;

  if (abs(currentSentiment - previousSentiment) > threshold) {
    displayBookmarkSuggestion();
  }
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sufficient onboard processing power to handle AI tasks.
*   Haptic feedback module.
*   High-resolution display for visual exploration of the Bookmark Graph.
