## Adaptive Request Shaping via Predictive Congestion Modeling

**System Overview:**

This system builds on the concept of dynamic load balancing but introduces *predictive* capacity adjustment for backend nodes, extending beyond simple response time thresholds. It aims to proactively shape request flow, not just react to congestion, reducing “short-circuit” scenarios and improving overall system stability.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Request Interception Layer:** Sits in front of the existing load balancer.  All incoming requests are initially processed here.
2.  **Historical Data Store:** Contains granular performance data – not just response times, but CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network bandwidth, and connection counts – for each backend node, time-stamped with high precision.
3.  **Predictive Congestion Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., time series forecasting, recurrent neural network) trained on the historical data.  This model predicts the *future* capacity of each backend node over a short time horizon (e.g., 5-15 seconds).  It doesn't just look at current metrics; it identifies *trends* indicating upcoming bottlenecks.
4.  **Adaptive Shaping Engine:**  Uses the predictions from the Congestion Model to dynamically adjust the rate at which requests are forwarded to each backend node.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** Monitors actual performance after shaping (response times, error rates) and uses this data to continuously refine the predictive model.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Initialization:** The system begins by collecting historical data for a warm-up period. The Predictive Congestion Model is trained during this period.
2.  **Request Interception:**
    *   Each incoming request is intercepted by the Request Interception Layer.
    *   The layer queries the Predictive Congestion Model to obtain a predicted capacity value for each backend node.
    *   The layer calculates a ‘shaping weight’ for each node based on its predicted capacity. Nodes with higher predicted capacity receive higher weights.  Weights are normalized to sum to 1.
3.  **Request Routing:**
    *   The existing load balancing algorithm (e.g., round robin, least connections) is still used *within* the pool of eligible nodes, but the *probability* of a request being sent to a specific node is proportional to its shaping weight. This is achieved through a weighted random selection.
4.  **Continuous Adaptation:**
    *   After a request is processed, the actual response time and error rate are recorded.
    *   This data is fed back into the Predictive Congestion Model to refine its predictions.  The model uses a rolling window of data to adapt to changing conditions.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Shaping Engine):**

```
function routeRequest(request):
  nodeCapacities = PredictiveCongestionModel.getCapacities()  // Returns a list of predicted capacities for each node
  totalCapacity = sum(nodeCapacities)
  nodeWeights = [capacity / totalCapacity for capacity in nodeCapacities]  // Calculate weights
  
  // Weighted random selection of a backend node based on nodeWeights
  selectedNode = weightedRandomChoice(backendNodes, nodeWeights)
  
  forwardRequestToNode(request, selectedNode)
```

**Data Storage Requirements:**

*   Time series data for each backend node: CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network Bandwidth, Connection Count, Response Time, Error Rate.
*   Granularity: 1-second intervals.
*   Retention period: Minimum 7 days, ideally 30 days.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The Predictive Congestion Model should be deployed as a distributed service to handle high request volumes.
*   Caching of predicted capacities can reduce latency.
*   Horizontal scaling of the Request Interception Layer and Adaptive Shaping Engine.
