**Dynamic Color Space Mapping for Perceptual Similarity Search**

**Specification:**

This system extends the concept of n-dimensional color searching to incorporate dynamic color space mapping based on real-time perceptual analysis. The core innovation lies in adapting the n-dimensional color model *during* the search process, rather than relying on a static model like RGB or LAB. This aims to drastically improve search accuracy by aligning the color space with *how humans perceive* color differences, leading to more relevant results even with subtle variations.

**Components:**

1.  **Perceptual Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Initial color search range (min/max values across n dimensions).
    *   Process:  Analyzes the provided color range and dynamically calculates a weighting matrix for each color dimension.  This weighting is based on established perceptual color models (e.g., CIECAM02) and aims to prioritize dimensions where human perception is most sensitive within the specified range.  The module calculates a transformation matrix to remap the color space based on the weighting.
    *   Output: Transformation matrix, adapted n-dimensional color search range.

2.  **Color Space Remapping Engine:**
    *   Input:  Data store of indexed integer color values, Transformation matrix, adapted n-dimensional color search range.
    *   Process:  Applies the transformation matrix to *all* indexed color values in the data store *before* the search. This essentially rotates and scales the color space, making colors with perceptually similar differences appear closer together numerically.  The adapted n-dimensional color search range is used as the search parameters on the remapped color space.
    *   Output: Remapped data store (in-memory or temporary), adapted search range.

3.  **Optimized Search Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Remapped data store, adapted search range.
    *   Process: Employs the interleaved integer indexing described in the original patent, but now operating on the *remapped* color space.  Leverages the fact that perceptually similar colors are now numerically closer, potentially allowing for more efficient indexing and pruning of search results. The search algorithm should include a mechanism to adjust the granularity of the search based on the dynamic weighting.
    *   Output: Search results comprising records associated with indexed integer color values within the one or more integer search ranges.

**Pseudocode (Perceptual Analysis Module):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateDynamicWeighting(min_color_range, max_color_range):
  // Input: Minimum and maximum color values for each dimension.
  // Output: Weighting matrix for each dimension.

  FOR EACH dimension IN color_dimensions:
    color_span = max_color_range[dimension] - min_color_range[dimension]
    // Calculate perceptual sensitivity within this range using CIECAM02 or similar model
    sensitivity = CalculatePerceptualSensitivity(min_color_range[dimension], max_color_range[dimension])
    weighting_matrix[dimension] = sensitivity  //Assign sensitivity as the weighting

  RETURN weighting_matrix

FUNCTION CalculateTransformationMatrix(weighting_matrix):
  // Input: Weighting matrix.
  // Output: Transformation matrix.

  //Construct transformation matrix based on weighting values.
  //This matrix will be used to remap the color space.
  //Example: Diagonal matrix with weighting values on the diagonal.
  transformation_matrix = DiagonalMatrix(weighting_matrix)

  RETURN transformation_matrix
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The perceptual analysis module could be computationally expensive. Caching weighting matrices for common color ranges can improve performance.
*   The transformation matrix should be applied to the entire data store *once* and stored temporarily to avoid redundant calculations.
*   The granularity of the search (e.g., the number of bits used for indexing) could be dynamically adjusted based on the weighting matrix to optimize performance and accuracy.
*   The system should include a fallback mechanism to use the original color space and indexing scheme if the perceptual analysis module fails or is unavailable.
