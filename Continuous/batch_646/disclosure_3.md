## Dynamic Narrative Branching via Player-Driven 'Echoes'

**Concept:** Expand the timeline spawning concept beyond simple character control takeover. Introduce a system where player actions, *even minor ones*, create short-lived, parallel 'Echo Timelines'. These Echoes arenâ€™t full replays, but simulations of the immediate consequences of a specific player choice. They are presented to the player *before* the choice is finalized, allowing for informed decision-making, and adding a layer of strategic foresight.

**Specs:**

**1. Echo Timeline Generation:**

*   **Trigger:** Any significant player action (dialogue choice, item use, movement into a specific area, initiating combat, failing a skill check).  'Significance' is determined by a game-defined weighting system.
*   **Simulation Length:**  Echoes run for a short, fixed duration (e.g., 5-15 seconds of game time) *after* the triggering action.  This is a fast-forwarded simulation, visually distinct (e.g., desaturated colors, ghostly visuals).
*   **Resource Cost:** Generating an Echo requires a finite resource ("Foresight Points").  These points are earned through gameplay (completing objectives, discovering secrets). This prevents spamming and forces strategic use.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Echo simulations are run in parallel on available computing resources.  If resources are limited, simulation fidelity is reduced (e.g., lower resolution, simplified AI).

**2. Echo Presentation & Interaction:**

*   **Viewpoint:** Echo is presented from the controlling player's current viewpoint.
*   **Fast-Forwarded Time:**  Echo plays at an accelerated rate, showcasing the immediate consequences.
*   **Visual Indicators:**
    *   **Positive Outcomes:** Highlighted with a green hue and/or a subtle glow.
    *   **Negative Outcomes:** Highlighted with a red hue and/or a visual distortion.
    *   **Neutral Outcomes:** Displayed without color correction.
*   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   During the Echo, the player can *briefly* attempt to mitigate negative outcomes. For example, if an Echo shows a character becoming hostile, the player might have a short window to attempt a diplomatic action.
    *   These "mitigation attempts" do *not* affect the main timeline. They are purely for the Echo simulation.
*   **Echo Termination:**  The Echo ends automatically after the pre-defined duration.  The player is presented with a summary of the Echo's outcome.
*   **Decision Lock-In:** After viewing the Echo, the player commits to their original action.

**3. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Event: Player Action Triggered
function HandlePlayerAction(action, player, game_state) {
  if (CanGenerateEcho(player)) { // Check Foresight Points, cooldown, etc.
    EchoTimeline echo = GenerateEchoTimeline(action, player, game_state);
    RunEchoSimulation(echo);
    DisplayEchoToPlayer(echo);
    //Allow limited interaction during Echo, doesn't affect main timeline
    HandleEchoInteraction(echo);
    ConsumeForesightPoints(player);
  }
  ExecutePlayerAction(action, player, game_state); //Actual game action
}

//Echo Generation
function GenerateEchoTimeline(action, player, game_state){
    EchoTimeline echo = new EchoTimeline(game_state);
    echo.ApplyAction(action);
    echo.Simulate(simulation_duration);
    return echo;
}
```

**4.  Edge Cases & Considerations:**

*   **Complex Actions:** For actions with numerous possible outcomes, the system might present multiple Echoes, each showcasing a different possibility.
*   **RNG & Randomness:**  Echoes should accurately represent the probabilities of random events.
*   **Multiplayer Synchronization:**  In multiplayer games, Echoes must be generated and displayed consistently for all relevant players.
*   **Echo Memory:** Store a limited history of recent Echoes, allowing the player to review them for strategic planning.
