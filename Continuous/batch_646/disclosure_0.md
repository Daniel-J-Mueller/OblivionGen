## Adaptive Configuration Drift Detection & Automated Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the signed configuration update mechanism to include proactive drift detection. Implement a system where the host machine periodically hashes its critical configuration files and compares them to a ‘golden’ hash stored in persistent storage (originally signed and received via the existing mechanism). If drift is detected (hash mismatch), the system initiates an automated rollback to the last known good configuration, *before* alerting operators. This prevents silent configuration corruption from propagating.

**Specs:**

*   **Configuration Hash Generation:**
    *   Identify critical configuration files (e.g., `/etc/resolv.conf`, `/etc/ntp.conf`, systemd unit files, network interface configurations).
    *   Implement a secure hashing algorithm (SHA-256 or better).
    *   Generate hashes of these files during initial configuration and after each successful signed update.
    *   Store these hashes alongside the configuration data in persistent storage, also digitally signed.

*   **Drift Detection Module:**
    *   A background process on the host machine.
    *   Periodically (configurable interval – default 6 hours) re-hashes the critical configuration files.
    *   Compares the current hashes to the stored ‘golden’ hashes.
    *   If a mismatch is detected:
        *   Initiate a rollback procedure (see below).
        *   Log the event with detailed information.
        *   Alert operators *after* the rollback is complete.

*   **Rollback Procedure:**
    *   Persistent storage contains backups of critical configuration files after each signed update.
    *   The rollback procedure restores the configuration files from the latest backup.
    *   Critical services are automatically restarted to apply the restored configuration.
    *   A "rollback counter" is incremented to prevent infinite rollback loops.
    *   If the rollback fails after a configurable number of attempts, the system enters a safe mode and alerts operators.

*   **API Extensions:**
    *   New API endpoint for querying the current configuration hashes.
    *   API endpoint for forcing a configuration rollback.
    *   API endpoint for configuring the drift detection interval and rollback attempts.

**Pseudocode (Drift Detection Module):**

```
function detect_drift()
  critical_files = [ "/etc/resolv.conf", "/etc/ntp.conf", ...]
  golden_hashes = read_hashes_from_persistent_storage()
  current_hashes = []

  for file in critical_files:
    current_hash = calculate_hash(file)
    current_hashes.append(current_hash)

    if current_hash != golden_hashes[index(file)]:
      log("Configuration drift detected in " + file)
      rollback()
      break  // Stop checking after drift is detected and rollback initiated

  log("Drift detection complete. No drift found.")
end function

function rollback()
  log("Initiating rollback procedure.")
  restore_configuration_from_backup()
  restart_critical_services()
  increment_rollback_counter()

  if rollback_counter > MAX_ROLLBACK_ATTEMPTS:
    enter_safe_mode()
    alert_operators("Rollback failed. Entering safe mode.")
  end if
end function
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Granular Drift Detection:**  Instead of a full file comparison, use checksums on specific configuration parameters.
*   **Automated Root Cause Analysis:** Integrate with a logging system to identify the source of the configuration drift.
*   **Rollback Preview:** Allow operators to preview the changes that will be made during a rollback before it is executed.
