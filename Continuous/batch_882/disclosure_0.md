## Dynamic Contextual Recap Generation – "Echoes"

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand recap functionality to proactively generate “Echoes” – short-form contextual recaps triggered *not* by resuming playback, but by external events or user activity. These aren't just summaries of *what* happened, but *why* it matters in the present moment, leveraging real-time data and external connections.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Integrate with multiple data sources:
    *   Social Media APIs (Twitter, Facebook, Reddit): Track relevant hashtags, trending topics, and user comments related to the video content.
    *   News APIs: Monitor news articles and events that tie into the video’s plot or themes.
    *   Sports APIs (if applicable): Track live scores, player stats, and game highlights for sports content.
    *   User Calendar/Location (with permission): Understand the user's current context (e.g., are they commuting, at a sporting event?).

*   **Event Triggering:** Define trigger events for Echo generation:
    *   **Topical Relevance:** When a trending topic on social media closely relates to a scene or character in the video.
    *   **News Connection:** When a news event directly impacts the plot or themes of the video.
    *   **Character Mention:** When a character is mentioned in a social media post or news article.
    *   **Location Proximity:** When the user is near a location featured in the video.
    *   **Time-Based Triggers:** Reminders about plot points at relevant times (e.g., “Remember when X happened? It impacts the current situation.”).
    *   **User Interaction:** If a user searches for a character or plot point.

*   **Recap Generation Algorithm:**
    1.  **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze the trigger event and identify its connection to the video content.
    2.  **Scene Selection:** Identify relevant scenes or segments that address the contextual connection.
    3.  **Dynamic Editing:** Edit the selected scenes into a concise (5-15 second) "Echo" recap. This includes:
        *   Highlighting key moments.
        *   Adding contextual overlays (e.g., text explaining the connection to the trigger event).
        *   Adjusting audio levels to emphasize important dialogue or sound effects.
    4.  **Presentation:** Display the Echo recap as a non-intrusive notification (e.g., a pop-up banner, a lock screen notification).

*   **User Customization:** Allow users to control:
    *   The types of events that trigger Echoes.
    *   The frequency of Echo notifications.
    *   The length of Echo recaps.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION generateEcho(event, videoContent, userPreferences):
  context = analyzeEvent(event)
  relevantScenes = findRelevantScenes(context, videoContent)
  echo = editScenes(relevantScenes, context, userPreferences)
  presentEcho(echo, userPreferences)

FUNCTION analyzeEvent(event):
  // Use NLP/ML to identify key themes, entities, and sentiments in the event
  RETURN context

FUNCTION findRelevantScenes(context, videoContent):
  // Use semantic search/video analysis to identify scenes that match the context
  RETURN relevantScenes

FUNCTION editScenes(relevantScenes, context, userPreferences):
  // Concatenate relevant scenes, add contextual overlays, adjust audio, etc.
  RETURN echo

FUNCTION presentEcho(echo, userPreferences):
  // Display the echo recap as a notification
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Interactive Echoes:** Allow users to tap on the Echo recap to jump to the relevant scene in the video.
*   **Collaborative Echoes:** Enable users to share Echoes with their friends on social media.
*   **AI-Generated Echoes:** Use AI to generate entirely new Echo recaps based on the context.
