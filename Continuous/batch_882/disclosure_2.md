**Dynamic Spectral Shaping with Nanomaterial-Enhanced Light Guide**

**Concept:** Extend the color temperature adjustment beyond simple red/yellow/blue LED mixing. Implement a dynamic spectral shaping layer *within* the light guide panel itself, using a layer of specifically engineered nanomaterials. This allows for finer-grained control over the emitted spectrum, creating more accurate and nuanced color temperatures, and potentially expanding the color gamut of the display.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Nanomaterial Layer:**
    *   Composition: A matrix of upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) and quantum dots (QDs) dispersed within a transparent polymer (e.g., PMMA).
    *   UCNPs: Selected for efficient absorption of lower-energy light (e.g., infrared) and emission of visible light across the spectrum.  Ratios of different UCNP types (e.g., NaYF4:Yb,Er; NaYF4:Yb,Tm) control the relative intensity of emitted colors.
    *   QDs:  Cadmium-free QDs (e.g., InP/ZnS) with tunable emission wavelengths based on size. Focused on filling spectral gaps or enhancing specific colors (e.g., deep reds, vivid greens).
    *   Concentration: Optimized for maximum light conversion efficiency without significant scattering or attenuation.
    *   Layer Thickness: 50-100 microns.
    *   Patterning: The nanomaterial layer is patterned *within* the light guide panel using micro-contact printing or inkjet deposition. Regions of varying nanomaterial composition create spatially varying spectral characteristics.

2.  **Excitation Source:**
    *   Infrared LEDs: Array of infrared LEDs positioned along the edge of the light guide panel, alongside (or interspersed with) the existing white LEDs.  These provide the excitation energy for the UCNPs.
    *   Wavelengths: 980nm or similar for efficient UCNP excitation.
    *   Control: Independent current control for each IR LED to modulate the intensity of specific spectral components.

3.  **Light Guide Panel Modification:**
    *   Material:  Standard acrylic or polycarbonate light guide material.
    *   Surface Texture: Micro-lens array or diffractive optical element (DOE) etched onto the output surface of the light guide panel.  This helps to homogenize the light and distribute the spectrally shaped light evenly across the display.

4.  **Control System:**
    *   Color Temperature Input: User-defined color temperature (Kelvin) or color coordinates (CIE XYZ).
    *   Lookup Table: A pre-calculated lookup table maps desired color temperatures to specific current settings for the white LEDs and IR LEDs, and potentially to activation patterns for different regions of the nanomaterial layer.
    *   Feedback Loop: Color sensor integrated into the display to measure the actual color temperature and brightness, providing feedback to the control system for calibration and correction.
    *   Algorithm: A PID controller or similar algorithm adjusts the LED currents and nanomaterial activation patterns to achieve the desired color temperature and brightness.

**Pseudocode for Control System:**

```
// Initialization
load lookup table (color temperature -> LED currents & nanomaterial activation)

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  get user input (desired color temperature)

  lookup LED currents and nanomaterial activation pattern from table

  set LED currents for white LEDs and IR LEDs

  activate/deactivate nanomaterial regions according to pattern

  measure actual color temperature and brightness using color sensor

  calculate error (desired - actual)

  adjust LED currents and nanomaterial activation pattern using PID controller

  repeat
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Superior Color Accuracy:** Finer-grained spectral control leads to more accurate and nuanced color reproduction.
*   **Wider Color Gamut:**  The use of QDs can extend the color gamut beyond the limits of traditional white LEDs.
*   **Improved Energy Efficiency:** By tailoring the spectrum to the display's requirements, energy waste can be minimized.
*   **Dynamic Spectral Adaptation:** The system can adapt to different viewing conditions (e.g., ambient light) and content types (e.g., video, text) to optimize the viewing experience.
