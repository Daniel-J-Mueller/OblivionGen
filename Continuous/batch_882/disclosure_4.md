## Adaptive Predictive Pre-Caching with Multi-Tier Key Distribution

**Concept:** Expand on the pre-caching idea, not just for images, but for *any* data type (video, documents, code snippets, etc.). Introduce a predictive element based on user behavior *and* contextual awareness (location, time of day, connected devices).  Critically, implement a multi-tiered cryptographic key distribution system to balance security with immediacy of access.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Classification & Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:** Data type (MIME type, file extension), data size, user interaction history (frequency of access, time spent viewing/editing), contextual data (location, time, connected devices, currently running applications).
*   **Processing:** Assign a priority score to each data item based on weighted factors.  Dynamic weighting algorithms adjust based on user habits. Implement a "decay" factor – infrequently accessed data loses priority over time.
*   **Output:** Prioritized data queue for pre-caching.

**2. Predictive Pre-Cache Module:**

*   **Input:** Prioritized data queue, network bandwidth availability, device storage capacity.
*   **Processing:** Initiate pre-caching of highest priority items. Implement "trickle caching" – small, continuous downloads of data fragments to maintain a consistent cache fill level. Adapt download rate based on network conditions.
*   **Output:** Pre-cached data fragments and fully cached data.

**3. Multi-Tier Key Distribution System:**

*   **Tier 1:  Ephemeral Key (Immediate Access):**  A short-lived, symmetric key used for accessing the *first few kilobytes* of the data.  This allows for instant 'glance' access – rapidly displaying a preview or initial portion of the content.  This key is pushed to the device *before* the user requests the data.
*   **Tier 2:  Proximity Key (Local Network Access):** A longer-lived symmetric key for accessing the full data *when the device is on the same local network as the source*.  This key is transferred via a secure, localized protocol (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi Direct).
*   **Tier 3:  Authenticated Key (Remote Access):** A key requiring full authentication (password, biometrics) for remote access.  This key is transmitted via a traditional encrypted channel (TLS, HTTPS).
*   **Key Rotation:** Implement automatic key rotation for all tiers to enhance security.
*   **Key Revocation:**  Enable remote key revocation in case of device compromise or user account closure.

**4.  Contextual Key Selection:**

*   **Input:** Device location (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation), network connectivity (cellular, Wi-Fi), user authentication status.
*   **Processing:** Dynamically select the appropriate cryptographic key based on context.  For example:
    *   Device on same Wi-Fi network as source:  Use Proximity Key.
    *   Device on cellular network:  Use Authenticated Key.
    *   Initial data access: Use Ephemeral Key.
*   **Output:**  Selected cryptographic key.

**5.  Data Fragmentation & Redundancy:**

*   Fragment cached data into smaller blocks.
*   Implement redundant storage of critical data blocks across multiple storage locations.
*   Use erasure coding techniques to reconstruct data even if some blocks are lost.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Key Selection):**

```
function selectKey(deviceLocation, networkConnectivity, userAuthenticationStatus) {
  if (deviceLocation == "localNetwork" && networkConnectivity == "wifi") {
    return proximityKey;
  } else if (userAuthenticationStatus == "authenticated") {
    return authenticatedKey;
  } else {
    return ephemeralKey;
  }
}
```

**Scalability Notes:**

*   The key distribution system should be scalable to handle a large number of devices and users.
*   Consider using a distributed key management system (DKMS) to improve security and reliability.
*   Implement a caching layer for frequently accessed keys.
