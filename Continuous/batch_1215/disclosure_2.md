## Adaptive Haptic Feedback for Voice Command Confirmation

**Concept:** Extend the voice-based operation modes with nuanced haptic feedback to confirm command acceptance and provide contextual cues *without* relying solely on auditory confirmation. This enhances usability, particularly in noisy environments or for users with auditory impairments.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Engine:** Integrate a high-resolution haptic engine capable of generating localized and varied vibrations. Consider a multi-actuator array beneath the device surface for richer haptic textures.
*   **Haptic Profiles:** Define distinct haptic profiles associated with different command types (e.g., navigation, media control, information retrieval). These profiles should vary in intensity, duration, and texture.
*   **Contextual Haptics:**  The haptic feedback isn't just confirmation; it *augments* the command. For example:
    *   **Volume Control:** A smooth, continuous vibration mirroring the volume change.
    *   **Navigation:**  Short, directional taps mimicking the direction of the next turn.
    *   **Information Retrieval:**  A pulsing vibration that intensifies as more data loads.
*   **Voice-Haptic Sync:**  Synchronize haptic feedback *with* the auditory confirmation. The haptic cue should *precede* the voice response, providing anticipatory feedback.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to customize haptic intensity, duration, and profile assignments.  Accessibility settings should include options to disable haptics entirely or adjust sensitivity.
*   **'Haptic Language':** Develop a small lexicon of haptic patterns that serve as unique identifiers.  For example, a triple-pulse could mean 'searching,' while a rising vibration signifies 'success.'
*   **Software Integration:**  The OS needs APIs to control the haptic engine and associate haptic profiles with system events and application commands.  This API should expose granular control over vibration parameters (frequency, amplitude, waveform).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processVoiceCommand(command, confidenceLevel) {
  if (confidenceLevel > threshold) {
    // Determine haptic profile based on command type
    hapticProfile = getHapticProfile(command);

    // Trigger haptic feedback
    triggerHaptic(hapticProfile);

    // Execute command
    executeCommand(command);

    //Provide audio confirmation - delayed to allow haptic to resolve.
    delay(hapticProfile.duration);
    playAudioConfirmation(command);

    return SUCCESS;
  } else {
    // If confidence is low, provide a subtle 'error' haptic.
    triggerHaptic(ERROR_HAPTIC);
    playAudioConfirmation("Command not recognized");
    return FAILURE;
  }
}

function getHapticProfile(command) {
  switch (command) {
    case "increase_volume":
      return VOLUME_INCREASE_HAPTIC;
    case "decrease_volume":
      return VOLUME_DECREASE_HAPTIC;
    case "navigate_home":
      return NAVIGATION_HOME_HAPTIC;
    // ... other command profiles
    default:
      return DEFAULT_HAPTIC;
  }
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Piezoelectric actuators are a strong candidate.
*   ERM (Eccentric Rotating Mass) motors could be used but have limitations in precision.
*   Consider a layered approach for more complex tactile sensations.
