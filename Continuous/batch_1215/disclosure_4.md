## Dynamic Reputation Propagation & Federated Risk Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the risk scoring beyond individual accounts and requests to a dynamic, federated reputation system that propagates risk assessments across connected entities. This creates a 'web of trust' where actions affecting one entity influence the risk profiles of related entities, enabling proactive mitigation.

**Specification:**

**1. Entity Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate data from multiple sources: customer accounts, service accounts, API keys, devices, network addresses, payment methods, and even third-party threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Relationship Mapping:** Establish relationships between entities. Examples:
    *   Customer owns multiple devices.
    *   API key is used by a specific application.
    *   Payment method is associated with multiple accounts.
    *   Service account has access to specific resources.
*   **Graph Database:** Store entity relationships in a graph database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune) to facilitate efficient traversal and relationship analysis.

**2. Risk Propagation Engine:**

*   **Initial Risk Score:** Each entity starts with a base risk score.
*   **Risk Events:** Define risk events: fraudulent transactions, suspicious login attempts, malware detection, unusual API calls, etc.
*   **Propagation Rules:** Define rules for propagating risk scores:
    *   **Direct Propagation:** If Account A initiates a fraudulent transaction, directly increase the risk score of Account A.
    *   **Indirect Propagation:** If Account Aâ€™s device is compromised, increase the risk score of all accounts using that device.
    *   **Weighted Propagation:** Different relationships have different weights. A compromised device linked to a high-value account has a greater impact than one linked to a low-value account.
*   **Decay Function:** Implement a decay function to reduce the impact of past risk events over time.

**3. Federated Risk Scoring:**

*   **Data Sharing Agreements:** Establish secure data-sharing agreements with trusted partners (banks, ISPs, cloud providers).
*   **Privacy-Preserving Techniques:** Employ privacy-preserving techniques (differential privacy, federated learning) to share risk scores without revealing sensitive data.
*   **Cross-Domain Risk Assessment:** Combine risk scores from multiple domains to create a holistic risk assessment. For example, a customer account with a high fraud score in banking may trigger increased scrutiny for related cloud services.

**4. Adaptive Mitigation Policies:**

*   **Policy Engine:** Define adaptive mitigation policies based on the overall risk score.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Automatically adjust risk thresholds based on evolving threat landscapes.
*   **Automated Actions:** Trigger automated actions:
    *   Multi-factor authentication.
    *   Transaction blocking.
    *   Account suspension.
    *   Alerting security analysts.

**Pseudocode (Risk Propagation Engine):**

```
function propagate_risk(entity, risk_increase, relationship_weight):
  entity.risk_score += risk_increase * relationship_weight
  for related_entity in entity.relationships:
    propagate_risk(related_entity, risk_increase * 0.5, related_entity.relationship_weight) // Recursive propagation with diminishing impact

function process_risk_event(event, entity):
  risk_increase = determine_risk_increase(event)
  propagate_risk(entity, risk_increase, 1.0)

function determine_risk_increase(event):
  // Logic to determine risk increase based on event type and severity
  // Example:
  if event.type == "fraudulent_transaction":
    return 50
  elif event.type == "suspicious_login":
    return 10
  else:
    return 5
```

**Infrastructure Considerations:**

*   Scalable graph database.
*   Real-time data ingestion pipeline.
*   Secure data-sharing infrastructure.
*   Automated policy enforcement engine.
