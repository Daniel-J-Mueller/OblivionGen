## Dynamic Contour Simplification & Predictive Rendering

**Specification:** A system for dynamically simplifying vector contours within a document rendering pipeline, coupled with a predictive rendering cache that anticipates user viewport changes.

**Core Concept:** The patent focuses on minimizing storage through offset-based contour/vertex data. This builds upon that by actively *reducing* the data needed for rendering *at runtime*, based on viewing context and predicted user interactions. Instead of purely static optimization, we introduce a dynamic simplification algorithm.

**Components:**

1.  **Contour Tree:** Represent each shape as a tree structure, where nodes represent segments of the contour (lines, curves). Each segment stores its original vertex data, a simplification level, and a rendered representation.

2.  **Dynamic Simplification Algorithm:** This algorithm operates in real-time.  It evaluates each contour segment based on:
    *   **Screen Space Size:** Segments occupying a smaller area on the screen are simplified more aggressively.
    *   **Curvature:** High-curvature segments are preserved with more detail.
    *   **Proximity to Viewport:** Segments near the viewport edges are prioritized for detail.
    *   **User Interaction Prediction:** Utilizing predicted viewport movements (e.g., based on scrolling velocity, panning gestures) to pre-simplify/detail contours in anticipation of the new viewport.

3.  **Rendering Cache:** A multi-level cache.
    *   **Level 1 (L1):** Stores fully rendered segments at the highest detail level.
    *   **Level 2 (L2):** Stores simplified segments.
    *   **Level 3 (L3):** Stores minimal contour data (control points for curves, endpoints for lines) for on-demand rendering.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Simplification):**

```
function simplifyContour(contour, screenSpaceSize, curvature, viewportProximity, predictedViewportChange):
  if screenSpaceSize < threshold1 AND curvature < threshold2:
    # Aggressive Simplification
    simplifiedContour = reducePoints(contour, ratio = 0.8) # Remove 20% of points
  elif screenSpaceSize < threshold3 AND curvature < threshold4:
    # Moderate Simplification
    simplifiedContour = simplifyWithDouglasPeucker(contour, tolerance = 0.5)
  else:
    # Maintain original detail
    simplifiedContour = contour

  if predictedViewportChange is significant:
    # Pre-simplify/detail for predicted viewport
    predictedViewportSimplifiedContour = simplifyContour(simplifiedContour,
                                                        estimatedScreenSpaceSizeForPredictedViewport,
                                                        curvature,
                                                        viewportProximity,
                                                        predictedViewportChange)
    return predictedViewportSimplifiedContour
  else:
    return simplifiedContour
```

**Workflow:**

1.  Initial document load: Contours are stored with original vertex data and rendered at a base detail level.
2.  Rendering loop:
    *   For each visible contour:
        *   Calculate `screenSpaceSize`, `curvature`, and `viewportProximity`.
        *   Run `simplifyContour()` to determine the appropriate detail level.
        *   Check cache. If simplified version exists, use it.
        *   If not, render simplified contour and store in cache.
3.  User interaction:
    *   Predict viewport changes.
    *   Pre-simplify/detail contours in predicted area.

**Novelty:** This system extends the static optimization approach of the patent by introducing *dynamic* simplification. By adapting the level of detail based on rendering context and predictive analysis, it aims to minimize rendering load, improve performance, and create a smoother user experience, especially for complex documents or reflowable content. The multi-level cache is also critical for rapid rendering of simplified content.
