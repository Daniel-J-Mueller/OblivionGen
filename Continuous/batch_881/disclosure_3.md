## Personalized 'Trend Anticipation' Display

**Concept:** Leverage sales rank *decrease* alongside increase to predict future demand and display items poised for a resurgence. Current systems focus on what's *currently* trending. This system anticipates *future* trends by identifying items whose rank is currently dropping but exhibits characteristics indicative of a potential rebound.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical Sales Rank (daily, weekly) – Same as existing system.
    *   Social Media ‘Buzz’ Volume – Real-time tracking of mentions, hashtags related to items.
    *   Search Query Volume – Tracking of search queries related to items.
    *   ‘Wishlist’ additions – Tracking of items being added to user wishlists.
    *   ‘Save for Later’ actions – Tracking of items saved by users.

2.  **‘Resurgence Score’ Calculation:**

    ```pseudocode
    function calculateResurgenceScore(item):
      # Calculate Rank Change
      rankChange = currentRank - previousRank
      
      # Calculate Buzz Momentum
      buzzMomentum = (currentBuzzVolume - previousBuzzVolume) / previousBuzzVolume
      
      # Calculate Search Momentum
      searchMomentum = (currentSearchVolume - previousSearchVolume) / previousSearchVolume
      
      # Calculate Wishlist/Save Momentum
      wishlistMomentum = (currentWishlistAdds - previousWishlistAdds) / previousWishlistAdds
      saveMomentum = (currentSaveAdds - previousSaveAdds) / previousSaveAdds

      #Weighting Factors (tunable)
      rankWeight = -0.4
      buzzWeight = 0.2
      searchWeight = 0.2
      wishlistWeight = 0.1
      saveWeight = 0.1
      
      # Resurgence Score
      resurgenceScore = (rankWeight * rankChange) + (buzzWeight * buzzMomentum) + (searchWeight * searchMomentum) + (wishlistWeight * wishlistMomentum) + (saveWeight * saveMomentum)

      return resurgenceScore
    ```

3.  **Display Logic:**

    *   A dedicated display section titled "On the Comeback" or similar.
    *   Items are ranked based on the calculated `resurgenceScore`.
    *   Display includes:
        *   Item image/name
        *   `resurgenceScore` (normalized for user understanding – e.g., a ‘Comeback Potential’ meter).
        *   Brief explanation of why the item is predicted to regain popularity (e.g., "Social buzz increasing rapidly," "Wishlist adds spiking").
        *   Link to product page.
    *   Filtering options:
        *   Category.
        *   Minimum ‘Comeback Potential’ score.
        *   Timeframe (e.g., "Items showing potential for a comeback within the next week/month").

4.  **User Personalization:**

    *   The `resurgenceScore` calculation can be weighted based on the user's purchase history and browsing behavior.
    *   Items from categories the user frequently purchases will be given higher priority.
    *   Items similar to those the user has previously shown interest in will be weighted more heavily.

5.  **A/B Testing:**
    *  Compare click-through rates, conversion rates, and overall revenue generated by the "On the Comeback" section against a control group that does not have this feature.
    *  Experiment with different weighting factors in the `resurgenceScore` calculation to optimize performance.
    *  Test different display layouts and content to determine what resonates best with users.
