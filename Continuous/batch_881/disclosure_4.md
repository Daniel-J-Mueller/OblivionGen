## Dynamic Focal Plane Array

**Concept:** Instead of adjusting a single lens or sensor position, create a micro-lens array dynamically reshaped to manipulate the focal plane across the sensor. This allows for incredibly rapid depth mapping and selective focus *without* mechanical movement of larger components.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor:** High-resolution CMOS sensor (minimum 12MP). Global shutter preferred for dynamic scenes.
*   **Micro-Lens Array (MLA):**  Array of individually controllable micro-lenses positioned directly *above* the CMOS sensor. Density: > 1000 micro-lenses per square millimeter. Each micro-lens should have a diameter of <50 micrometers. Material: Polymer with high refractive index and low dispersion.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS)-based electrostatic actuators for each micro-lens. Each actuator will control the height and tilt of the corresponding micro-lens. Resolution: <1 nanometer.
*   **Control System:** Dedicated FPGA-based processor for real-time control of the MLA. Algorithm: Model Predictive Control (MPC) with feedback from a depth sensor (see below). 
*   **Depth Sensor:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor integrated *beneath* the CMOS sensor. Resolution: Minimum 64x64. Used to provide initial depth estimates for MPC.
*   **Power Consumption:** Target: < 5W.
*   **Cooling:** Passive heat sink with potential for micro-fluidic cooling for high-performance applications.

**Operation:**

1.  The ToF sensor captures a low-resolution depth map of the scene.
2.  The FPGA processes the depth map and calculates the optimal shape of the MLA to bring the entire scene into focus on the CMOS sensor.
3.  The FPGA sends control signals to the MEMS actuators, which deform the micro-lenses accordingly.
4.  The CMOS sensor captures the focused image.
5.  For dynamic scenes, the process is repeated continuously at a high frame rate (> 30fps).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
// Initialize:
depthSensor = new ToF_Sensor();
mla = new MicroLensArray();
desiredFocalPlane = 1.0; // Default focal plane

while (true) {
    depthMap = depthSensor.captureDepthMap();
    
    // Calculate optimal lens shapes based on depth map and desired focal plane
    lensShapes = calculateLensShapes(depthMap, desiredFocalPlane);
    
    mla.setLensShapes(lensShapes);
    
    image = captureImage(); // CMOS sensor read
    
    //Feedback loop
    sharpness = calculateImageSharpness(image);
    if (sharpness < threshold) {
        adjustFocalPlane(image);
    }
}

//calculateImageSharpness
//adjustFocalPlane
//calculateLensShapes
```

**Novelty:** This system differs significantly from existing autofocus systems. Instead of moving a single lens or sensor, it manipulates the focal plane *across* the entire sensor. This allows for:

*   **Instantaneous Depth Mapping:** The shape of the MLA directly corresponds to the depth of the scene.
*   **Selective Focus:** Specific regions of the scene can be brought into focus without affecting others.
*   **Computational Photography Opportunities:** The MLA can be used to create new computational photography effects.
*   **Miniaturization:** The system can be significantly smaller and lighter than traditional autofocus systems.
