## Adaptive Power Allocation via Predicted System Load

**Concept:** Expand the supervisor's predictive capabilities to *proactively* allocate power based on anticipated system load, rather than reactively disconnecting faulty subsystems.  This system aims to maximize operational lifespan and responsiveness, particularly for critical systems in dynamic flight conditions.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Load Prediction Module:** Integrated into the Supervisor Power Supply Controller.  Utilizes a multi-layered prediction model.
    *   **Layer 1: Flight Profile Prediction:**  Predicts future flight states (acceleration, altitude change, maneuver type) based on current flight parameters and potentially external data (e.g., weather forecasts, mission objectives). This uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical flight data.
    *   **Layer 2: Subsystem Load Estimation:**  For each subsystem, a separate model estimates power draw *given* a predicted flight state.  These models are trained using a combination of historical data and simulations.
    *   **Layer 3: Degradation Modeling:** Models the performance degradation of critical components over time, factoring in usage patterns, temperature, and voltage fluctuations. This informs a ‘health score’ for each subsystem.
*   **Dynamic Power Allocation Controller (DPAC):**  Receives predictions from the Load Prediction Module and dynamically adjusts power distribution to subsystems.
*   **Energy Buffer:** A dedicated energy storage system (supercapacitors or secondary battery) to absorb peak power demands and provide transient power support.

**2. Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop executed by DPAC
LOOP:

  // 1. Receive Predictions
  predicted_flight_state = Load_Prediction_Module.predict_flight_state()
  subsystem_loads = Load_Prediction_Module.predict_subsystem_loads(predicted_flight_state)
  health_scores = Load_Prediction_Module.evaluate_health_scores()

  // 2. Calculate Total Predicted Load
  total_predicted_load = SUM(subsystem_loads)

  // 3. Compare to Available Power
  available_power = Main_Power_Supply.get_available_power() + Energy_Buffer.get_energy()

  // 4. If Predicted Load Exceeds Available Power:
  IF total_predicted_load > available_power THEN

    // A. Prioritize Critical Subsystems (Navigation, Flight Control)
    critical_subsystems = GET_CRITICAL_SUBSYSTEMS()

    // B. Reduce Power to Non-Critical Subsystems (Sensors, Communication)
    FOR each non_critical_subsystem IN non_critical_subsystems:
        reduce_power_level(non_critical_subsystem, calculated_reduction_level)

    // C. Monitor System Health & Adjust Allocation Continuously
    MONITOR_SYSTEM_HEALTH()
    ADJUST_POWER_ALLOCATION()

  ENDIF

  // 5. Optimize Allocation Based on Health Scores
  FOR each subsystem:
      IF subsystem.health_score < threshold THEN
          increase_power_level(subsystem, optimized_level) // Provide extra power to struggling components
      ENDIF
  ENDIF

ENDLOOP
```

**3. Hardware Components:**

*   **High-bandwidth Communication Bus:** Facilitates rapid data exchange between the Supervisor, DPAC, and subsystems.
*   **Real-time Data Acquisition System:** Collects performance metrics (voltage, current, temperature) from each subsystem.
*   **Advanced Power Management ICs:** Capable of precise voltage and current control.
*   **Dedicated Processing Unit:** DPAC requires a high-performance processor for running prediction models and implementing control algorithms.

**4. Training Data:**

*   Historical flight logs.
*   Subsystem performance data under various conditions.
*   Component degradation models derived from accelerated life testing.
*   Simulations of different flight scenarios and failure modes.
