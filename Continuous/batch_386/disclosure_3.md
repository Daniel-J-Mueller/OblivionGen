## Adaptive Query Routing with Predictive Contextual Drift

**Concept:** Expand the existing query-answering failure detection to *proactively* route queries based on predicted contextual drift, rather than solely reacting to failure rates. This moves beyond simply identifying when the knowledge base *can't* answer, and anticipates *when* it will likely struggle, shifting queries *before* a failure occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Contextual Feature Extraction:**  Implement a module to extract contextual features from incoming queries.  These features go beyond keyword analysis. Examples:
    *   **Temporal Features:** Day of week, time of day, seasonality. (e.g., queries about tax preparation spike in early spring).
    *   **Geographic Features:** (If applicable) Query origin location.
    *   **Event-Based Features:**  External events detected through news feeds or APIs (e.g., a major product launch, a natural disaster).
    *   **Query Category Features:** Clustering of queries using embeddings. 
*   **Drift Prediction Model:** Train a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to predict knowledge base performance for each contextual feature *combination*. The model will output a "confidence score" indicating the likelihood of a successful answer. 
    *   **Training Data:** Historical query data with associated success/failure labels, paired with contextual features.  
    *   **Model Updates:**  Retrain the model continuously with new data to adapt to changing trends.
*   **Adaptive Routing Engine:** 
    *   **Thresholds:** Define adjustable confidence score thresholds.
    *   **Routing Logic:** 
        1.  Receive query & extract contextual features.
        2.  Drift prediction model estimates confidence score.
        3.  If confidence score is *below* the threshold: Route query to the external query-answering component.
        4.  If confidence score is *above* the threshold: Route query to the knowledge database.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Record the actual performance of the query (success/failure) and use this data to retrain the drift prediction model and refine confidence thresholds.  This allows the system to learn which contexts are most prone to drift.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Implement a reinforcement learning component to automatically adjust confidence thresholds based on the observed performance and cost of routing (e.g. cost of using external API).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function route_query(query):
    context_features = extract_context_features(query)
    confidence_score = drift_prediction_model.predict(context_features)

    if confidence_score < threshold:
        response = external_query_answering_component(query)
        log_query(query, "external", success=True) #or false
        return response
    else:
        response = knowledge_database(query)
        log_query(query, "internal", success=True) # or false
        return response

function train_model(historical_data):
    #Prepare data: features, labels (success/failure)
    drift_prediction_model.fit(features, labels)

function adjust_threshold(performance_metrics, routing_cost):
    #Reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize threshold
    #based on observed performance and cost
    threshold = RL_algorithm(performance_metrics, routing_cost)
    return threshold
```

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond reactive failure detection to proactive query routing. Anticipates knowledge gaps *before* they manifest as failures, potentially improving user experience and reducing reliance on the external component. The dynamic threshold adjustment adds another layer of optimization, balancing accuracy with cost.
