## Adaptive Resource Isolation with Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the existing isolated execution environment concept with continuous behavioral profiling of the rendered resource *within* the environment. Use this profile to dynamically adjust the level of isolation and the type of data exposed to the support agent, creating a risk-adaptive system.

**Specification:**

1.  **Behavioral Sensor Suite:** Integrate a suite of sensors within the virtual machine/execution environment. These sensors monitor:
    *   Network activity (DNS requests, outbound connections, data transfer size).
    *   CPU usage patterns (spikes, consistent high load).
    *   Memory access patterns (reads, writes, allocation).
    *   DOM manipulation (changes to the web page structure, injection attempts).
    *   JavaScript execution (function calls, API usage, event listeners).
    *   Browser API usage (geolocation requests, microphone/camera access).

2.  **Risk Score Calculation:** Develop a risk scoring algorithm. Each sensor reading contributes to the overall risk score. The algorithm should:
    *   Employ weighted scoring based on the severity of the activity. (e.g., Outbound connection to known malicious IP address = high weight).
    *   Implement anomaly detection to identify deviations from baseline behavior. (e.g., Unexpected JavaScript function calls).
    *   Utilize machine learning to dynamically adjust the weights and thresholds based on historical data.

3.  **Dynamic Isolation Levels:** Implement multiple isolation levels, ranging from "Fully Isolated" to "Limited Access."  The isolation level is determined by the calculated risk score.
    *   **Fully Isolated:** No network access, limited CPU/memory resources, minimal browser API access. (Default for initial resource loading).
    *   **Limited Access:** Restricted network access (e.g., only to specific domains), moderate CPU/memory resources, limited browser API access.
    *   **Normal Access:** Standard CPU/memory resources, full network access (monitored), full browser API access (with user consent).

4.  **Data Sanitization & Proxy:** All data exchanged between the isolated environment and the support agent is passed through a sanitization proxy.
    *   The proxy removes potentially sensitive information (e.g., personally identifiable information, credentials).
    *   The proxy replaces potentially malicious code with benign placeholders.
    *   The proxy can render a static snapshot of the web page if the risk score is too high.

5.  **Support Agent Interface:** Provide the support agent with a visual interface to monitor the risk score and isolation level in real-time.  The interface should include:
    *   A risk score meter.
    *   A log of sensor readings and risk events.
    *   Controls to manually adjust the isolation level (with appropriate warnings).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (request_active) {
    sensor_data = collect_sensor_data()
    risk_score = calculate_risk_score(sensor_data)

    isolation_level = determine_isolation_level(risk_score)

    apply_isolation_level(isolation_level)

    sanitized_data = sanitize_data(data_from_isolated_env)

    send_data_to_support_agent(sanitized_data)
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Virtualization technology (e.g., VMware, VirtualBox, KVM).
*   Containerization technology (e.g., Docker).
*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Network monitoring tools.
*   Web application firewall (WAF).
*   Browser automation framework (e.g., Selenium, Puppeteer).
