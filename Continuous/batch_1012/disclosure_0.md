## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Projection

**Concept:** Augment the acoustic echo cancellation system with a dynamic, real-time map of the acoustic environment and project counter-signals *before* they become echoes. This moves beyond reactive cancellation to proactive sound-shaping.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Array of miniature microphones (64+) distributed around the device. Resolution: 5cm spacing.
    *   Ultrasonic rangefinders (4+) to build a coarse 3D map of the room – identifying surfaces, furniture, and potential reflection points. Range: 5 meters. Update Rate: 10Hz.
    *   Optional: Low-resolution camera to aid in surface material identification (wood, glass, fabric) – affecting sound absorption/reflection modeling.

2.  **Acoustic Mapping Engine:**
    *   Utilize ray tracing and finite difference time-domain (FDTD) methods to simulate sound propagation within the mapped environment.
    *   Create a dynamic ‘acoustic hologram’ representing the sound field at any given time.
    *   Model sound absorption/reflection characteristics of surfaces based on material identification (if camera present) or pre-defined profiles.
    *   Map shall be rendered at 100Hz.

3.  **Predictive Echo Generation:**
    *   Based on the acoustic map, *predict* potential echo paths from the loudspeaker to the microphones.
    *   For each predicted echo path, estimate the echo’s arrival time, amplitude, and frequency characteristics.

4.  **Counter-Signal Projection:**
    *   Generate counter-signals (anti-noise) specifically tailored to cancel the *predicted* echoes *before* they reach the microphones.
    *   Utilize a phased array of micro-speakers surrounding the device to project these counter-signals.
    *   Implement adaptive beamforming to focus the counter-signals on specific echo paths.

5.  **Hybrid Cancellation System:**
    *   Combine the proactive counter-signal projection with the existing reactive acoustic echo cancellation.
    *   Use the reactive cancellation as a ‘safety net’ to handle any residual echoes or unexpected reflections.

6.  **Software Implementation:**
    *   Real-time operating system (RTOS) to ensure low latency and deterministic performance.
    *   Machine learning algorithms (e.g., reinforcement learning) to optimize the acoustic map and counter-signal projection strategies over time.
    *   API for integration with existing audio processing pipelines.

**Pseudocode (Counter-Signal Generation):**

```
//Input: Playback Audio Data, Acoustic Map, Microphone Array Configuration
//Output: Counter-Signal Data for Speaker Array

FOR each potential echo path identified in Acoustic Map DO
    Calculate echo arrival time, amplitude, and frequency
    Generate counter-signal with inverse phase and appropriate amplitude
    Apply beamforming weights to focus counter-signal on echo path
    SUM weighted counter-signals for each speaker in array
END FOR

Output: Speaker Array Counter-Signal Data
```

**Potential Improvements/Extensions:**

*   Personalized Acoustic Profiles: Learn user’s room layout and acoustic characteristics over time to create optimized acoustic maps.
*   Dynamic Room Adjustment: Automatically adapt to changes in the room layout (e.g., furniture moving) by re-mapping the acoustic environment.
*   Multi-User Support: Differentiate between speech sources and create separate acoustic maps for each user.
*   Integration with Smart Home Systems: Leverage data from smart home sensors (e.g., room occupancy, window/door status) to improve acoustic mapping accuracy.
