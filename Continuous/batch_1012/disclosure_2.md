## Dynamic Subgraph Merging & Specialization

**Concept:** Extend the subgraph recognition & compilation system to *dynamically* merge smaller, frequently occurring subgraphs into larger, specialized units *during* runtime, based on observed execution patterns. This goes beyond pre-compilation and static database lookup.

**Specs:**

1.  **Runtime Subgraph Profiler:** A module continuously monitoring the execution of the neural network, tracking the frequency and co-occurrence of identified subgraphs. Stores a rolling history of subgraph execution traces.
2.  **Subgraph Fusion Engine:**  Based on the profiling data, this engine identifies opportunities to merge adjacent or frequently chained subgraphs. Criteria for fusion:
    *   Frequency threshold (subgraph chain must occur above a certain rate).
    *   Data locality (minimal data transfer overhead after merging).
    *   Resource availability (sufficient resources to support the larger, merged unit).
3.  **Dynamic Compilation Module:** Upon identifying a fusion opportunity, this module generates *new* executable instructions for the merged subgraph. This compilation is optimized for the specific neural network processor architecture and current resource constraints.
4.  **Instruction Swapping Mechanism:**  A system to seamlessly replace existing instructions for individual subgraphs with the newly generated instructions for the merged unit *without* interrupting the overall network execution.  This utilizes a double-buffering or similar technique.
5.  **Adaptive De-fusion:**  If a merged subgraph becomes infrequent or resource-intensive, the system can dynamically de-fuse it back into its original components.
6.  **Metadata Tracking:** Maintain metadata about each subgraph (original, merged, de-fused) including execution counts, resource usage, and compilation history.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Compilation Module):**

```
function compile_merged_subgraph(subgraph_a, subgraph_b, processor_specs):
    merged_graph = combine(subgraph_a, subgraph_b)
    optimized_graph = optimize(merged_graph, processor_specs) #resource allocation, data flow
    instructions = generate_instructions(optimized_graph, processor_specs)
    return instructions
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Subgraph`: {`id`: INT, `nodes`: LIST, `edges`: LIST, `execution_count`: INT, `resource_usage`: FLOAT, `instructions`: BYTES}
*   `ExecutionTrace`: LIST of `Subgraph` IDs in execution order
*   `ProcessorSpecs`: {`core_count`: INT, `memory_size`: INT, `instruction_set`: LIST}

**Rationale:** This moves beyond static pre-compilation to *adaptive* compilation. The neural network isn’t just executing pre-defined building blocks; it’s *learning* to optimize itself by dynamically creating larger, more efficient units based on real-time execution patterns.  This addresses the limitations of static optimization, enabling the network to adapt to changing workloads and data distributions.
