**Modular, Liquid-Cooled Expansion Card Array**

**Concept:** Extend the dual-sided expansion card mounting to a fully modular array, incorporating integrated liquid cooling for high-performance applications. This moves beyond simply stacking cards to creating a configurable, thermally-managed system.

**Specs:**

*   **Mounting Rail System:** Replace the single mounting structure with a series of interconnected, standardized rails. These rails will be constructed from aluminum alloy for rigidity and thermal conductivity. Rail length will be modular (e.g., 100mm, 200mm, 300mm segments) allowing for custom array lengths. Rails will feature a dovetail joint for secure interconnection and alignment.
*   **Card Modules:** Each expansion card will be mounted on a dedicated “card module”. These modules consist of:
    *   A PCB matching standard expansion card connectors (PCIe, M.2).
    *   Integrated micro-channel liquid cooling block directly contacting the card’s heat-generating components.
    *   Quick-release locking mechanism for secure attachment to the mounting rails.
    *   Integrated flow sensors to monitor coolant flow rate.
*   **Coolant Distribution Manifold:** A central manifold distributes coolant to each card module. Manifold incorporates:
    *   High-speed pump(s) with adjustable flow rate.
    *   Temperature sensors to monitor coolant and card temperatures.
    *   Reservoir for coolant.
    *   Quick-disconnect fittings for easy coolant replacement.
    *   Digital display for temperature/flow monitoring.
*   **Power Delivery:** A dedicated power distribution board mounts alongside the coolant manifold. This board features:
    *   Multiple high-current power connectors.
    *   Individual power control and monitoring for each card module.
    *   Over-current and short-circuit protection.
*   **Airflow Management:** Optional airflow ducts can be attached to the card modules to direct airflow across the cooling fins, supplementing the liquid cooling.
*   **Stacking/Orientation:** Rails designed for vertical and horizontal stacking, allowing for various configurations within a chassis. Rail segments will feature magnetic connectors for quick alignment.
*   **Materials:** Aluminum alloy rails, PCB with integrated copper heat spreaders, Acrylic/PETG coolant reservoir/manifolds.

**Pseudocode (Configuration/Control):**

```
// System Initialization
Connect to temperature sensors
Connect to flow sensors
Connect to pump controller
Connect to power controller

// Card Detection
scan rails for connected card modules
identify card type and power requirements for each module

// Thermal Management
while (system running) {
    for each card module {
        read temperature sensor
        if (temperature > threshold) {
            increase pump speed
            increase airflow (if applicable)
        }
        if (temperature < threshold) {
            decrease pump speed
            decrease airflow (if applicable)
        }
        read flow sensor
        if (flow < minimum) {
            alert user - potential blockage
        }
        log temperature and flow data
    }
}
```

**Innovation:** This departs from a static mounting solution to a dynamic, configurable, and actively cooled expansion system. Enables higher density, higher performance computing by addressing thermal limitations of dense card arrangements. Allows for easy swapping/upgrading of individual cards without disrupting the entire system.
