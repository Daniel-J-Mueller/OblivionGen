## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Calibration for Multi-Scale Weight Sensing

**Concept:** Expand the vibration-based noise cancellation to actively *calibrate* the weight sensor’s resonant frequency response, accounting for temperature drift, material fatigue, and external influences, across a range of load scales.  This moves beyond noise *reduction* to precise weight *determination* by compensating for inherent sensor limitations.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Primary Weight Sensor: High-resolution load cell (strain gauge, capacitive, etc.).  Specification dependent on target weight range.
    *   Vibration Sensor: Tri-axis MEMS gyroscope *and* accelerometer.  Accelerometer provides a broader frequency response for lower-frequency disturbances.
    *   Temperature Sensor: Thermistor coupled directly to the weight sensor to monitor operational temperature.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-speed digital signal processor (DSP) or FPGA.
*   **Calibration Signal Source:** Miniature, precision-controlled electromagnetic actuator coupled to the weight sensor platform.  Capable of generating low-amplitude sinusoidal vibrations across a defined frequency range (e.g., 1Hz – 1kHz).
*   **Software/Firmware Modules:**
    *   **Resonance Tracking:** Algorithm that analyzes the gyroscope and accelerometer data in the frequency domain to identify the weight sensor’s primary resonant frequencies. This includes a Kalman filter to track changes in resonance over time and temperature.
    *   **Actuation Control:** Module that controls the electromagnetic actuator, sweeping through a range of frequencies.
    *   **Adaptive Compensation:** Module that uses the resonance tracking data and actuation response to create a dynamic compensation profile. This profile is applied to the raw weight sensor signal to correct for frequency-dependent errors.
    *   **Multi-Scale Calibration:** Algorithm that adapts the calibration profile based on the *expected* weight range.  Lower weight ranges require higher-frequency calibration and vice versa.  Uses an initial weight estimate to select the appropriate calibration setting.
    *   **Data Logging:** Stores calibration data, temperature readings, and weight measurements for analysis and optimization.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Compensation Module):**

```
// Input: Raw Weight Signal (rawWeight), Resonance Frequency (resonanceFreq),
//        Calibration Profile (calibrationProfile)

function adaptiveCompensation(rawWeight, resonanceFreq, calibrationProfile) {

  // 1. Frequency Domain Transformation
  frequencyDomainSignal = FFT(rawWeight);

  // 2. Apply Calibration Profile
  correctedFrequencyDomainSignal = frequencyDomainSignal * calibrationProfile;

  // 3. Inverse Frequency Domain Transformation
  correctedWeightSignal = IFFT(correctedFrequencyDomainSignal);

  return correctedWeightSignal;
}

//Calibration Profile Generation
function generateCalibrationProfile(resonanceFreq) {
  //Define frequency range
  frequencyRange = [10Hz, 1000Hz];
  //Generate profile based on resonance
  profile = 1 - (amplitude * e^(-(frequency - resonanceFreq)^2 / (2 * bandwidth^2)));
  return profile;
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Calibration:** System performs a sweep of the electromagnetic actuator across the defined frequency range while monitoring the weight sensor response. This establishes a baseline calibration profile.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The gyroscope and accelerometer continuously monitor vibrations.
3.  **Resonance Tracking:** The resonance tracking algorithm identifies shifts in the weight sensor’s resonant frequencies due to temperature changes, load variations, or material drift.
4.  **Dynamic Compensation:** The adaptive compensation module uses the tracked resonance frequencies to update the calibration profile and apply it to the raw weight sensor signal in real-time.
5.  **Multi-Scale Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the calibration parameters based on an estimated weight range to optimize accuracy.
