**Personalized Agent 'Mood' Display & Routing**

**Concept:** Extend the agent selection process by incorporating a real-time 'mood' or 'energy' level indicator for each available agent, and allow the customer to prioritize agents based on this perceived mood, *in addition* to wait time and prior interaction history. This isn’t about literal mood detection (though that’s a potential future expansion). It’s about inferring an agent’s responsiveness based on recent interaction patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection:** System passively collects data on agent interaction metrics during *all* customer interactions (not just recent ones). These metrics include:
    *   Average response time (to both system prompts and customer inputs)
    *   Average utterance length (shorter = potentially more concise/efficient)
    *   Sentiment analysis score of agent’s spoken/typed responses (positive/neutral/negative)
    *   Frequency of use of positive language markers ("certainly," "absolutely," "happy to help")
    *   Frequency of pauses/hesitations in voice communication.
    *   Number of escalations/transfers initiated by the agent.
*   **Mood Inference Engine:**  A weighted scoring algorithm combines the above metrics to generate a “Responsiveness Score” for each agent. This score isn't presented as "mood" directly, but as a visual indicator (e.g., a color gradient – green/yellow/red, a series of 'energy bars', or a simplified 'responsiveness' rating - 'High', 'Medium', 'Low').
*   **UI Integration:** Agent list in the customer interface is modified to include the responsiveness indicator alongside agent name, wait time, and prior interaction history.  Customers can *sort* the agent list by responsiveness score, in addition to wait time and prior history.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Responsiveness score is updated in real-time (e.g., every 30-60 seconds) to reflect the agent’s current interaction patterns.
*   **Optional Filtering:**  Customers can set a minimum responsiveness level (e.g., "Show me only agents with 'High' responsiveness") to further refine the agent list.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Agent Data Structure
Agent {
    AgentID
    Name
    WaitTime
    PriorHistoryScore // Based on previous interactions with customer
    ResponsivenessScore // Dynamically calculated
}

// Function: CalculateResponsivenessScore(Agent)
// Inputs: Agent interaction data for the last X minutes/interactions
// Outputs: ResponsivenessScore (0-100)

ResponsivenessScore = (
    (AverageResponseTimeWeight * (1 - NormalizedAverageResponseTime)) +
    (SentimentScoreWeight * NormalizedSentimentScore) +
    (PositiveLanguageWeight * NormalizedPositiveLanguageFrequency) +
    (EscalationWeight * (1 - NormalizedEscalationFrequency))
)

//  Normalization functions to scale values between 0 and 1.  Weights are adjustable.

//  Display Agent List to Customer, sorted by:
//  1.  Customer Preference (Prior History)
//  2.  Responsiveness Score
//  3.  Wait Time
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Agent ‘Preference’ Learning:**  System learns customer preferences for certain agent interaction styles (e.g., fast-paced vs. patient, formal vs. informal) and incorporates this into the scoring algorithm.
*   **Gamification:** Agents earn points/badges for maintaining high responsiveness scores.
*   **AI-Driven Agent Coaching:** System provides real-time feedback to agents on how to improve their responsiveness.
*   **A/B Testing**: Compare call center results based on variations of agent display (Responsiveness Score displayed vs. not displayed).
