## Adaptive Query Shaping via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Dynamically optimize query execution plans *during* runtime based on observed data characteristics and system load, using reinforcement learning. This builds upon the idea of token buckets by treating query plan choices as 'actions' and resource consumption as 'rewards' or 'penalties'.

**Specifications:**

*   **Components:**
    *   *Query Plan Agent:* A reinforcement learning agent (e.g., utilizing a Deep Q-Network or Policy Gradient method) responsible for selecting query execution plans.
    *   *State Representation:* The agent's state is a vector containing:
        *   Query characteristics (estimated cardinality, join types, filtering predicates).
        *   System load metrics (CPU utilization, memory pressure, disk I/O).
        *   Recent query performance statistics (latency, throughput).
        *   Token bucket status for the requesting entity/customer (representing remaining capacity).
    *   *Action Space:* A set of possible query plan choices for each operation. This could include different join algorithms (hash join, merge join, nested loop), indexing strategies, and data partitioning methods. Each action has an associated resource cost estimate.
    *   *Reward Function:* A combination of:
        *   Query latency (negative reward for high latency).
        *   Resource consumption (penalty for exceeding token bucket limits).
        *   Throughput (positive reward for higher throughput).
    *   *Token Bucket Integration:*  The reward function *directly* incorporates the token bucket status.  If an action would deplete a customer's token bucket, the reward is heavily penalized. This incentivizes the agent to select plans that are both efficient *and* respect capacity limits.

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  Query Received: A database query is received.
    2.  Initial Plan Generation: The query optimizer generates a set of candidate execution plans.
    3.  State Construction: The system constructs the state vector, including query characteristics, system load, token bucket status, and recent performance data.
    4.  Action Selection: The RL agent selects an action (a specific execution plan) based on the current state.
    5.  Plan Execution: The selected plan is executed.
    6.  Reward Calculation: The reward is calculated based on the query latency, resource consumption, and token bucket impact.
    7.  Agent Update: The RL agent updates its policy based on the observed reward.
    8.  Continuous Adaptation:  Steps 4-7 are repeated for each query, allowing the agent to continuously adapt its policy and improve query performance over time.

*   **Pseudocode (Agent Update):**

```
function update_agent(state, action, reward, next_state):
  # Q-Learning example

  alpha = 0.1  # Learning rate
  gamma = 0.9 # Discount factor

  Q(state, action) = Q(state, action) + alpha * (reward + gamma * max(Q(next_state, a)) for a in actions)
```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Q-Table/Policy Network:* Stores the learned optimal policy (mapping states to actions).
    *   *Token Bucket Registry:* Maps customer/entity IDs to their respective token bucket instances.
    *   *Performance History:* Stores recent query performance statistics for use in state construction.



This approach moves beyond static prioritization and allows the system to *learn* how to optimize queries in a way that balances performance and capacity constraints. The token buckets act as a key input to the learning process, ensuring that prioritization rules are enforced dynamically.
