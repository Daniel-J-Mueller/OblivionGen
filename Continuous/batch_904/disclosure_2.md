## Dynamic Recommendation 'Mood' Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *who* recommends, or *what* is recommended, to factor in the *emotional tone* of the recommendation itself. Current systems appear to focus on transactional data (purchased, viewed) or basic ratings. This builds a layer of sentiment analysis *of the recommendation itself* and adjusts the display/weighting of subsequent recommendations.

**Specs:**

1.  **Recommendation Input Source Expansion:**  Integrate data feeds beyond simple "purchase" signals. Include:
    *   Social media posts (relevant to the offering) – analyze text for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, sarcastic, excited, etc.)
    *   Review text analysis – beyond star ratings, parse reviews for expressed emotions.
    *   Direct user feedback – allow users to tag recommendations with ‘mood’ descriptors (e.g., "helpful," "fun," "serious," "practical").
    *   Forum/community discussions – analyze threads related to the offering for prevailing sentiments.

2.  **Sentiment Analysis Engine:**  Develop/integrate a robust sentiment analysis engine. This needs to go beyond simple polarity (positive/negative) and identify a wider range of emotions.  Consider using a combination of lexicon-based approaches and machine learning models.

3.  **'Mood Profile' Generation:** For each offering, generate a 'Mood Profile'.  This profile represents the collective emotional tone associated with recommendations for that offering.  Represent this as a vector of emotional dimensions (e.g., excitement, trust, practicality, humor).

4.  **User 'Mood Preference' Modeling:**  Dynamically model each user’s preferred ‘Mood’ for recommendations. This could be inferred from:
    *   Past interactions (e.g., clicking on recommendations with specific emotional tones).
    *   Explicit user settings (e.g., “Show me practical recommendations,” “Surprise me with something fun”).
    *   Time of day/contextual factors (e.g., a user might prefer serious recommendations during work hours, and fun recommendations during leisure time).

5.  **Recommendation Adjustment Algorithm:** 
    ```pseudocode
    function adjustRecommendations(recommendations, userMoodPreference, offeringMoodProfile):
      adjustedRecommendations = []
      for each recommendation in recommendations:
        moodSimilarityScore = calculateMoodSimilarity(userMoodPreference, offeringMoodProfile)
        weightingFactor = 1 + (moodSimilarityScore * 0.5) // Boost weighting based on mood match
        weightedRecommendation = recommendation * weightingFactor
        adjustedRecommendations.append(weightedRecommendation)

      // Normalize adjustedRecommendations to ensure sum of weights = 1
      return adjustedRecommendations
    ```

6.  **UI Integration:** Display 'Mood Tags' on recommendations.  For example, a recommendation might be tagged with "Enthusiastic," "Helpful," or "Practical."  Allow users to filter recommendations based on mood. Visual cues (e.g., color-coding, icons) can further convey the emotional tone of each recommendation.

7.  **A/B Testing Framework:** Implement a robust A/B testing framework to evaluate the impact of mood-based recommendations on key metrics (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate, user engagement).
