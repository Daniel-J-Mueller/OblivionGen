## Dynamic Condition Assessment via Image/Video Upload & AI

**Specification:** Implement a system where users listing items for resale can upload images or short videos of the item *in addition* to selecting a pre-defined condition (e.g., "New," "Like New," "Good," "Acceptable"). An AI image/video analysis component then assesses the condition *independently*, generating a "Condition Score" (0-100) and highlighting specific areas of damage or wear (e.g., scratches, dents, stains) visually on the uploaded media. This AI-generated assessment is then displayed *alongside* the user's self-reported condition, allowing buyers to make more informed decisions.

**Components:**

*   **Upload Module:** Enables users to upload images/videos via web/mobile app. Video length limited to 30 seconds.
*   **AI Analysis Engine:**  A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a massive dataset of product images/videos with varying degrees of wear and tear.  The engine identifies visual defects, assesses overall condition, and assigns a Condition Score.
*   **Visual Defect Highlighting:** The AI engine highlights detected defects directly on the uploaded image/video using bounding boxes, heatmaps, or other visual cues.
*   **Condition Score Display:**  A prominent display of the AI-generated Condition Score, alongside the user's self-reported condition.  Potentially a combined visual indicator (e.g., a progress bar with both user-reported and AI-assessed levels).
*   **Dispute Resolution Tool:**  If a buyer disputes the item's condition upon receipt, the uploaded image/video with AI analysis serves as supporting evidence for the platform to mediate the dispute.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION list_item(item_details, user_condition, image_or_video)
  // Upload image/video to cloud storage
  storage_url = upload_to_cloud(image_or_video)

  // Send image/video URL to AI Analysis Engine
  analysis_results = AI_Analysis_Engine(storage_url)

  // Extract AI-generated Condition Score and defect highlights
  ai_condition_score = analysis_results.condition_score
  defect_highlights = analysis_results.defect_highlights

  // Store listing details, user-reported condition, AI results
  store_listing(item_details, user_condition, ai_condition_score, defect_highlights)

  // Display listing to potential buyers
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large dataset of product images/videos with labeled defects and corresponding condition ratings.
*   Metadata about product types to improve AI accuracy (e.g., differentiating wear patterns on leather vs. plastic).

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Augmented Reality (AR) integration:** Allow buyers to virtually "inspect" the item using AR, highlighting the defects detected by the AI.
*   **Condition-Based Pricing:**  Automatically adjust the suggested selling price based on the AI-generated Condition Score.
*   **Automated Dispute Resolution:**  Use the AI analysis to automatically resolve simple disputes.
