## Adaptive Content Reconstruction for Legacy Devices

**Concept:** Extend the device compatibility framework to not only *translate* requests and responses, but to dynamically *reconstruct* content to suit the capabilities of the client device, going beyond simple format conversions. This addresses situations where a device lacks the hardware or software to render modern content types, or has limited processing power.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Modules:**

1.  **Content Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Original content stream (video, image, interactive element, etc.) + Device Profile (obtained through existing framework).
    *   Function: Analyzes content complexity (resolution, bitrate, polygon count, script execution requirements, codec type) and compares it to the deviceâ€™s capabilities.
    *   Output: Complexity Score & Reconstruction Plan.

2.  **Reconstruction Engine:**
    *   Input: Original Content, Complexity Score, Reconstruction Plan.
    *   Function: Executes the Reconstruction Plan, applying transformations to the content. Possible transformations include:
        *   **Resolution Scaling:** Downscaling video resolution.
        *   **Texture Simplification:** Reducing texture detail in 3D models.
        *   **Model Decimation:** Reducing polygon count.
        *   **Codec Transcoding:** Converting to a more compatible codec.
        *   **Feature Stripping:** Removing non-essential features (e.g., motion blur, advanced lighting).
        *   **Interactive Element Substitution:** Replacing complex interactive elements with simpler equivalents (e.g., a full 3D game interface with static images and limited buttons).
        *   **Progressive Detail Delivery**: For graphically intense content, deliver lower resolution/detail versions first, with options to progressively load higher fidelity elements.
    *   Output: Reconstructed Content Stream.

3.  **Content Buffer/Prioritization:**
    *   Function: Holds multiple versions of content (original, reconstructed at varying fidelity levels). Prioritizes delivery based on device capabilities and network conditions.
    *   Output: Selected Content Stream for Delivery.

**II. Implementation Details:**

1.  **Device Profile Enhancement:** Extend the existing device profile to include:
    *   Maximum Supported Resolution
    *   Maximum Supported Bitrate
    *   Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) Capabilities (e.g., shader model support, memory size)
    *   CPU Processing Power
    *   Supported Codecs
    *   Memory Capacity

2.  **Dynamic Reconstruction Plan Generation:** The Reconstruction Engine uses a rules-based system or machine learning model to generate a Reconstruction Plan based on the Content Analyzer's output and the Device Profile. The plan specifies the transformations to be applied to the content.

3.  **Integration with Existing Framework:** The Reconstruction Engine integrates into the existing device compatibility framework by sitting between the Services Platform and the Services Adapter. The Services Adapter requests the reconstructed content from the Reconstruction Engine before sending it to the client device.

**III. Pseudocode Example (Reconstruction Plan Generation):**

```pseudocode
function generateReconstructionPlan(contentComplexity, deviceProfile) {
  plan = {}

  if (contentComplexity.resolution > deviceProfile.maxResolution) {
    plan.resolution = scaleResolution(contentComplexity.resolution, deviceProfile.maxResolution)
  }

  if (contentComplexity.bitrate > deviceProfile.maxBitrate) {
    plan.bitrate = scaleBitrate(contentComplexity.bitrate, deviceProfile.maxBitrate)
  }

  if (contentComplexity.shaderComplexity > deviceProfile.shaderSupport) {
    plan.shaderComplexity = simplifyShaders(contentComplexity.shaderComplexity)
  }

  if (contentComplexity.polygonCount > deviceProfile.polygonLimit) {
    plan.polygonCount = decimateModel(contentComplexity.polygonCount, deviceProfile.polygonLimit)
  }
  return plan
}
```

**IV. Use Cases:**

*   **Streaming Video to Older Smart TVs:** Adapting high-resolution video to a lower resolution and bitrate suitable for older devices with limited processing power.
*   **Delivering Interactive Games to Low-End Set-Top Boxes:** Simplifying graphics and gameplay mechanics to run smoothly on devices with limited resources.
*   **Providing Access to AR/VR Content on Non-Compatible Headsets:** Reconstructing 3D scenes to render as 2D images or simplified 3D models.
*    **Remote Assistance to Older Devices**: Dynamically reducing the complexity of the user interface of a remote assistance tool.
