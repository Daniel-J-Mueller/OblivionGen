## Dynamic Spectral Shaping for Display Uniformity

**Concept:** The patent details a method for mitigating yellow gradients through light exposure. This sparks the idea of *actively* controlling the spectral content of the light used, not just filtering wavelengths, to correct for non-uniformities in the display *during normal operation*. This isn't a one-time 'cure' process, but a continuous, adaptive system.

**Specs:**

1.  **Display Integration:** Integrate a micro-spectrometer array *behind* the display panel (or within the light guide), arranged in a grid pattern. Resolution: minimum 1 sensor per 2x2 cm area of display.  Sensor range: 300nm - 700nm.  Sampling rate: 60Hz.
2.  **Light Source Control:** Utilize a multi-channel LED backlight system. Each channel comprises a narrow-band LED (bandwidth <10nm) covering a portion of the 300-700nm spectrum. Minimum 12 channels required for granular control. Individual brightness control (0-100%) for each channel.  
3.  **Processing Unit:** A dedicated image signal processor (ISP) or FPGA responsible for:
    *   Receiving spectrometer data.
    *   Calculating the color deviation at each measurement point compared to a target color profile.
    *   Generating a correction matrix, mapping spectrometer reading to LED channel brightness levels.
    *   Applying the correction matrix to the LED backlight system in real-time.
4.  **Calibration:**  Initial calibration phase utilizing a standardized color chart displayed on the screen to establish baseline color profiles and refine the correction algorithm. Regular recalibration (every 24 hours) to account for panel aging and environmental factors.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors color deviations and adjusts LED channel brightness to maintain a uniform color temperature and brightness across the entire display surface. Algorithm to account for viewing angle variations.
6.  **User Interface:** Software interface to allow user adjustment of color profiles, brightness settings, and viewing modes. Real-time display of color uniformity data. 
7.  **Algorithm Pseudocode:**
    ```
    FUNCTION CorrectColor(spectrometerData, targetProfile):
      deviation = spectrometerData - targetProfile
      correctionMatrix = CalculateCorrectionMatrix(deviation)
      ledBrightness = ApplyMatrix(correctionMatrix, ledChannels)
      RETURN ledBrightness
    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION CalculateCorrectionMatrix(deviation):
        // Machine learning model (trained on panel variations) to calculate optimal LED channel adjustments based on the deviation
        // Inputs: Deviation values for each spectrometer sensor
        // Outputs: Adjustments for each LED channel 
        // Uses: Gradient descent, or similar optimization algorithm
        // Model stores a weighting factor for each LED channel.
        weightingFactors = TrainedModel.GetWeightingFactors(deviation)
        //Normalize the weighting factors to fall between 0 and 1.
        normalizedWeightingFactors = Normalize(weightingFactors)
        RETURN normalizedWeightingFactors
    END FUNCTION
    ```

**Refinement:** Expand spectral monitoring beyond the visible spectrum, into the near-infrared and ultraviolet, to identify and compensate for subtle shifts in panel composition which may contribute to long-term degradation. Potential for using this system to dynamically adjust display settings to maximize battery life.
