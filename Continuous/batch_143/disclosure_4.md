**Personalized Digital Scent Association & Delivery**

**Concept:** Expand the phrase-based association to include personalized scent profiles triggered by those phrases during payment transactions or general user interaction.

**Specifications:**

*   **Scent Profile Database:** A database linking phrases (generated as per the source patent) to specific scent profiles. These profiles are comprised of a digital ‘recipe’ of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), represented as concentrations. This database will be user-customizable – allowing users to assign scents to phrases or allow the system to suggest associations.
*   **Scent Delivery Device Interface:**  An API allowing integration with personal scent delivery devices (e.g., smart diffusers, wearable scent emitters).  These devices must be capable of recreating scent profiles based on the VOC ‘recipe’ provided.
*   **Phrase-Scent Association Module:** An AI module analyzing user data (purchase history, preferences, stated interests, social media activity, even biometric data like emotional response to content) to *automatically* suggest phrase-scent pairings.  The system will rate the strength of association, providing justification (e.g., “User frequently purchases lavender-scented products; associating phrase ‘relaxing evening’ with lavender scent profile”).
*   **Transaction Triggered Scent Delivery:** During a payment transaction, if an associated phrase is detected (either explicitly used by the user or inferred from the transaction details), a signal is sent to the user’s scent delivery device to emit the associated scent.  Example: User types “order pizza”; system detects this phrase is linked to a “fresh basil & oregano” scent profile, activating the diffuser.
*   **Contextual Scent Delivery:** Extend beyond transactions.  If the user’s device detects the phrase "start workout", a "peppermint & eucalyptus" scent is activated.  If the user opens a travel booking app, a "sea breeze & coconut" scent could be activated.
*   **Adaptive Scent Intensity:** The system adjusts scent intensity based on user proximity to the delivery device, ambient environmental factors (temperature, humidity), and user feedback.
*   **Biometric Feedback Integration:**  Integrate with wearable sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) to detect user emotional state and *dynamically* adjust scent profiles to optimize mood or reduce anxiety.
*   **Digital Scent Marketplace:** A platform where users can create, share, and sell custom scent profiles.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Transaction Scent Delivery):**

```
FUNCTION handlePaymentRequest(request):
  phrase = extractPhraseFromRequest(request)

  IF phrase EXISTS in scentProfileDatabase:
    scentProfile = scentProfileDatabase[phrase]
    deviceId = getUserScentDeviceId() // Retrieve associated device ID

    IF deviceId EXISTS:
      sendScentProfileToDevice(deviceId, scentProfile)
      logScentDelivery(userId, phrase, scentProfile)
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION extractPhraseFromRequest(request):
  // Implementation details depend on request format (text, voice, etc.)
  // Could use NLP techniques to identify key phrases
  RETURN phrase
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This expands the phrase-association beyond mere identification and linking to payment instruments. It introduces a multi-sensory experience, leveraging scent to create a more immersive and personalized user experience.  The biometric feedback integration and digital scent marketplace add layers of complexity and potential for innovation.
