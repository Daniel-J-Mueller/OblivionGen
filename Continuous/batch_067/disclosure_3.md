## Gift-Based Collaborative Storytelling System

**Concept:** Extend the gift conversion rules to facilitate a collaborative storytelling experience. Instead of just converting gifts into different products or wish list items, the system allows gifts to *contribute* to an evolving narrative, co-created by the gift sender and recipient.

**System Specs:**

*   **Narrative Core:** A central database storing story "fragments" – short pieces of text, images, audio, or video – categorized by theme, genre, and emotional tone.
*   **Gift-to-Fragment Mapping:**  A rule engine that associates gift types (or specific gifts) with relevant story fragments.  This is done via a predefined 'fragment library' accessible by system admins, and extensible via AI-assisted tagging/categorization of new gift inputs.
*   **Sender/Recipient Roles:**
    *   **Sender:**  When sending a gift, the sender can optionally select a "narrative contribution" mode. This triggers the system to select a relevant fragment based on the gift.  The sender can also *write* a short accompanying prompt or question to direct the recipient's narrative response.
    *   **Recipient:**  Upon receiving a gift in narrative mode, the recipient receives the gift *and* the associated fragment/prompt.  The recipient’s response (text, image, audio, video) becomes a *new* fragment, added to the story, and linked to both the sender and the previous fragment.
*   **Story Visualization:** A user interface displays the evolving story as a branching narrative tree, showing the connections between fragments, senders, and recipients. Options for linear/chronological presentation.
*   **Fragment "Currency":** A system that awards "fragment currency" to both sender and recipient based on engagement with their fragments (views, likes, responses). This currency can be used to unlock premium story themes, fragment styles, or collaborative features.
*   **AI-Assisted Fragment Generation:** Integrate an AI model (text-to-image, text-to-audio) to assist recipients in crafting responses.  This could offer suggested continuations, stylistic variations, or visual interpretations of their input.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Function: ProcessGiftReception
// Input: Gift object, Recipient user, Sender user
// Output: Story fragment object

function ProcessGiftReception(gift, recipient, sender) {
  if (gift.narrativeMode == true) {
    fragment = SelectFragment(gift.type, recipient.preferences); // Based on type/preference
    prompt = sender.prompt; // If sender provided a prompt
    fragment.prompt = prompt;
    fragment.sender = sender;
    fragment.recipient = recipient;
    fragment.timestamp = currentTime();
    fragment.linkToParent(previousFragment);
    saveFragment(fragment);
    return fragment;
  } else {
    // Standard gift conversion process
    processStandardConversion(gift, recipient);
  }
}

// Function: SelectFragment
// Input: Gift type, Recipient preferences
// Output: Story fragment object
function SelectFragment(giftType, recipientPreferences) {
  // Query fragment database based on giftType and recipient preferences
  fragment = queryDatabase(giftType, recipientPreferences);
  return fragment;
}

// Function: queryDatabase
//Input: giftType, recipient preferences
//Output: fragment object
function queryDatabase(giftType, recipientPreferences){
  //Implement fragment database query logic
  //Use AI/ML to select most relevant fragment
  return fragment;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Standard web server infrastructure.
*   Database system (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).
*   AI/ML model for fragment selection and generation.
*   User interface for story visualization and interaction.
*   API for integration with e-commerce platforms.
