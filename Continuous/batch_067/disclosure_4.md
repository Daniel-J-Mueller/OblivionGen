## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the idea of switching audio streams between devices based on proximity, and introduce user-directed acoustic zoning with haptic reinforcement. Instead of solely *reacting* to user location, allow the user to *define* preferred audio zones within a space, and provide haptic cues to guide movement and reinforce zone boundaries.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (MMA):** Each device (phone, smart speaker, wearable) will house an MMA for accurate sound source localization and ambient noise cancellation.
*   **Haptic Transducers:** Integrated into wearable devices (wristband, headphones) capable of delivering localized vibrations.
*   **Ultra-Wideband (UWB) Anchors:** Strategically placed UWB anchors within the defined environment to enable precise real-time location tracking of both the user and the active audio devices.
*   **Networked Audio Devices:** Any combination of smart speakers, headphones, phones, or dedicated audio output units capable of networked communication.
*   **Dedicated Processing Unit:** A localized unit responsible for managing the localized audio configuration.

**2. Software & Algorithm Components:**

*   **Zone Definition Interface:** A mobile app allowing users to visually define acoustic zones within a mapped environment.  Zones can be designated as “primary,” “secondary,” or “exclusionary.”  Primary zones represent areas where the user *wants* to receive audio, secondary zones provide attenuated or altered audio, and exclusionary zones actively suppress audio.
*   **Real-Time Location Tracking:** UWB anchors track user and audio device locations, providing data to the central processing unit.
*   **Audio Beamforming & Spatialization:** Algorithms dynamically adjust audio beamforming and spatialization to focus sound within the designated primary zone, attenuating it in secondary and exclusionary zones.  This isn’t merely volume adjustment, but precise control over the sound field.
*   **Haptic Zone Reinforcement:** When the user approaches or crosses a zone boundary, the haptic transducer provides directional vibrations. The intensity of the vibration corresponds to the degree of zone transition. For example, a stronger vibration when entering a primary zone, a gentle pulse when approaching a boundary, and a rapid pulse when crossing into an exclusionary zone.
*   **Adaptive Learning Module:** The system learns user preferences over time.  If a user consistently ignores a zone boundary and continues into an exclusionary zone, the system will adjust the haptic feedback or zone definition accordingly.
*    **Ambient Noise Mapping**: A machine learning model maps the noise profile of the environment, and adapts the audio signal to compensate.

**3. System Operation:**

1.  **Zone Setup:** User uses the app to map the environment and define acoustic zones. This can be done visually on a floorplan or by physically walking the space.
2.  **Location Tracking:** UWB anchors continuously track the location of the user and active audio devices.
3.  **Audio Routing & Beamforming:** The system determines the optimal audio routing and beamforming configuration based on the user's location, zone definitions, and ambient noise levels. Audio is dynamically routed to the appropriate device(s) and beamformed to focus sound within the primary zone.
4.  **Haptic Feedback:** The haptic transducer provides directional vibrations to reinforce zone boundaries.
5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns user preferences and adjusts the zone definitions and haptic feedback accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    userLocation = getLocation(userDevice);
    audioDeviceLocations = getLocations(audioDevices);

    // Determine current zone
    currentZone = determineZone(userLocation, zones);

    // Route audio to appropriate device(s)
    routeAudio(currentZone, audioDeviceLocations);

    // Adjust beamforming and spatialization
    adjustAudio(currentZone, userLocation);

    // Haptic Feedback
    if (userApproachingZoneBoundary(userLocation, zones)) {
        hapticFeedback(directionToBoundary, intensity);
    }
}

// Function: determineZone
// Input: user location, zone definitions
// Output: current zone
function determineZone(userLocation, zones) {
  for (zone in zones) {
    if (isWithinZone(userLocation, zone)) {
      return zone;
    }
  }
  return "defaultZone";
}

// Function: isWithinZone
// Input: user location, zone definition
// Output: boolean
function isWithinZone(userLocation, zone) {
    //Logic to determine zone boundaries based on coordinates
    //returns true or false
}

```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Open-Plan Offices:** Create personalized acoustic bubbles for focused work.
*   **Home Entertainment:** Immerse users in sound while minimizing disruption to others.
*   **Public Spaces:** Deliver targeted audio information to individuals while respecting the auditory environment.
*   **Accessibility:** Assist visually impaired individuals with spatial awareness.
