## Probabilistic Data Structure Lifetime Management & Decay

**Concept:** Expand the 'iteration value' concept beyond simple presence/removal flags to incorporate a 'lifetime' or 'decay' factor for entries within the probabilistic data structure. This allows for modeling data that isn't strictly 'present' or 'absent' but has a probability of relevance that diminishes over time.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structure Augmentation:**

*   **Iteration Value Expansion:** Instead of a binary (or even just presence/removal) iteration value, use a floating-point number representing 'relevance'. Higher values indicate greater relevance.
*   **Decay Rate Parameter:** Each entry will have an associated 'decay rate'. This rate determines how quickly the 'relevance' iteration value decreases over time.
*   **Timestamping:** Store a 'last updated' timestamp for each entry.

**2. Operations:**

*   **Add Entry:**  When adding an entry, initialize 'relevance' to a maximum value (e.g., 1.0).  Store the current timestamp as ‘last updated’. The decay rate is a configurable parameter for the entry.
*   **Refresh Entry:**  An explicit 'refresh' operation resets the 'relevance' to the maximum value and updates the ‘last updated’ timestamp. This is used to counteract decay.
*   **Query Entry:**  The query operation calculates the current 'relevance' based on the 'last updated' timestamp, the decay rate, and the current time.  The calculation should involve an exponential decay function.  A threshold value determines whether the entry is considered ‘present’ based on its current ‘relevance’.
*   **Removal (Soft Delete):** Removal isn't a hard deletion. Instead, the decay rate is set to a very high value, causing the ‘relevance’ to rapidly decrease. The entry remains in the data structure but effectively disappears over time.
*   **Garbage Collection:** Implement a periodic garbage collection process. Entries with a ‘relevance’ below a very low threshold (effectively ‘expired’) are physically removed.

**3.  Output Value Generation:**

*   The output value generated for addition or refresh should include the 'relevance' value.
*   Hashing function should incorporate the 'relevance' value along with the entry itself. This allows the probabilistic data structure to accurately reflect the entry's current ‘relevance’.

**4. Pseudocode (Query Operation):**

```
function queryEntry(entry, bloomFilter, currentTime):
    // Retrieve last updated timestamp and decay rate
    lastUpdated = bloomFilter.getTimestamp(entry)
    decayRate = bloomFilter.getDecayRate(entry)

    // Calculate time elapsed
    timeElapsed = currentTime - lastUpdated

    // Calculate current relevance
    currentRelevance = 1.0 * exp(-decayRate * timeElapsed)

    // Determine presence based on threshold
    if currentRelevance > presenceThreshold:
        return True // Entry is considered present
    else:
        return False // Entry is considered absent
```

**5. Potential Applications:**

*   **Caching:**  Model cache entries that expire over time.
*   **Fraud Detection:**  Track suspicious activities with a diminishing probability of being relevant as time passes.
*   **Session Management:**  Manage user sessions with a time-to-live.
*   **Recommendation Systems:**  Decay the relevance of past user interactions.
