**Dynamic Contextual Overlay System**

**Concept:** Expand the automatic supplemental content presentation to include *dynamic* overlays triggered not only by device orientation change but also by detected user gaze, detected objects in the environment (via camera), and detected ambient sound. This creates a multi-sensory, context-aware information system layered over the primary content.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Device with orientation sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope).
    *   Front-facing camera with object/facial recognition capabilities.
    *   Microphone array for ambient sound analysis.
    *   High-refresh-rate display capable of displaying semi-transparent overlays.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Orientation Detection Module:* Identifies device orientation changes (landscape/portrait).
    *   *Visual Analysis Module:* Processes camera feed to identify objects, faces, and user gaze direction.  Output: Bounding boxes of identified objects, gaze vector, facial expression analysis.
    *   *Audio Analysis Module:*  Analyzes ambient sound for keywords, music genres, or specific sound events. Output: Detected keywords, genre classification, sound event identification.
    *   *Contextual Data Fusion Module:* Combines data from all three modules.  Uses weighted algorithms (adjustable via user settings) to prioritize data.
    *   *Content Recommendation Engine:* Accesses a content database (local or cloud-based).  Based on fused contextual data, recommends relevant supplemental content.
    *   *Overlay Rendering Engine:*  Responsible for displaying supplemental content as semi-transparent overlays on top of the primary content.  Supports variable opacity and positioning.

*   **Overlay Types:**
    *   *Orientation-Triggered Overlays:* Similar to the existing patent, triggered by device rotation.
    *   *Gaze-Triggered Overlays:* When the user looks at a specific object on the screen, an overlay appears with additional information.
    *   *Object-Triggered Overlays:* If the camera detects a real-world object (e.g., a landmark, product, book cover), an overlay appears with information about it.  Requires image recognition database.
    *   *Audio-Triggered Overlays:* When the device detects a specific sound (e.g., a song playing in the background), an overlay appears with information about the song or artist.

*   **Pseudocode (Contextual Data Fusion & Content Recommendation):**

```
function processContextualData(orientationData, visualData, audioData)
  context = {}

  if orientationData.orientationChanged:
    context.orientation = orientationData.newOrientation

  if visualData.objectsDetected:
    for object in visualData.objects:
      context[object.name] = object.boundingBox

  if visualData.gazeDetected:
    context.gaze = visualData.gazeDirection

  if audioData.keywordsDetected:
    for keyword in audioData.keywords:
      context[keyword] = audioData.confidence

  return context

function recommendContent(context):
  // Access content database based on context
  relevantContent = queryDatabase(context)

  // Prioritize content based on confidence levels/weights
  sortedContent = sortContent(relevantContent, context)

  return sortedContent[0] // Return top recommendation
```

*   **User Settings:**
    *   Adjust weighting of each sensory input (orientation, vision, audio).
    *   Enable/disable specific overlay types.
    *   Select preferred content sources.
    *   Adjust overlay opacity and position.

*   **Example Use Cases:**
    *   Watching a cooking video in portrait mode triggers an overlay with ingredient lists and nutritional information.
    *   Looking at a building through the camera triggers an overlay with historical facts and architectural details.
    *   Listening to a song triggers an overlay with lyrics and artist biography.
    *   Rotating the device while reading an article triggers an overlay with related articles and author information.
