## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Personalized Notification Filtering

**System Overview:**

The core concept is to create a dynamic acoustic zoning system within a space, coupled with a personalized notification filter that intelligently manages interruptions based on user context and preferences. This expands beyond simple volume attenuation and notification suppression to create a genuinely responsive and adaptable ambient experience.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** An array of microphones distributed throughout the monitored space (e.g., a room, open office). Beamforming capabilities are essential.
*   **Edge Processing Unit:** A dedicated processor (e.g., a Raspberry Pi class device or integrated into smart speakers) for real-time audio analysis and zone determination.
*   **Speaker System:** Existing or integrated speakers for audio output. Could include directional speakers for targeted audio.
*   **User Device (Smartphone/Tablet):** For user profile management, preference setting, and contextual awareness.

**Software/Algorithmic Components:**

1.  **Acoustic Zone Mapping:**
    *   Real-time analysis of audio signals from the microphone array.
    *   Beamforming to identify sound sources and their locations within the space.
    *   Creation of dynamic acoustic zones:
        *   *Speaker Zone:* Area immediately around active speakers.
        *   *Conversation Zone:* Areas where conversations are detected.
        *   *Quiet Zone:* Areas identified as relatively silent.
        *   *Interruption Zone:* Location of detected external sounds (doorbell, etc.)
    *   Zone boundaries are fluid and adapt to changing soundscapes.

2.  **User Profiling & Contextual Awareness:**
    *   User profiles stored on the user device, including:
        *   *Notification Priorities:* Which app/contact notifications are considered critical vs. non-urgent.
        *   *Sound Sensitivity:* User preference for ambient noise levels.
        *   *Activity Context:* (Inferred from phone sensors, calendar data, etc.) e.g., "In Meeting", "Working", "Relaxing", "Sleeping".
        *   *Personalized Acoustic Models:* Ability to add/train acoustic models for specific sounds/voices.

3.  **Intelligent Notification Filtering & Routing:**
    *   Notifications are intercepted before reaching the device's native notification system.
    *   Based on user profile, activity context, and acoustic zone:
        *   *Critical notifications* (e.g., emergency alerts) are always delivered, potentially with spatial audio cues.
        *   *Non-urgent notifications* are delayed or summarized.
        *   *Notifications can be spatially routed:* E.g., A message about a delivery can be announced faintly from the direction of the entrance.
        *   *Notifications can be suppressed altogether* if the user is in a "Do Not Disturb" mode or actively engaged in a focus activity.

4.  **Adaptive Ambient Audio Control:**
    *   Based on acoustic zone and user preferences:
        *   *Volume adjustment:* Automatically lower/raise volume levels in specific zones.
        *   *Equalization:* Adjust equalization based on ambient noise levels.
        *   *Noise Cancellation:* Apply noise cancellation or ambient sound effects to create a more immersive or relaxing environment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Audio Analysis & Zone Mapping
    audioData = captureAudioFromMicrophoneArray();
    zones = analyzeAudio(audioData); // Returns dictionary of zones with locations & sound sources

    // 2. User Context & Profile
    userContext = getUserContext(); // From phone sensors, calendar, etc.
    userProfile = loadUserProfile();

    // 3. Notification Interception
    notifications = interceptNotifications();

    // 4. Notification Filtering & Routing
    for each (notification in notifications) {
        priority = userProfile.getNotificationPriority(notification.app);
        if (priority == "Critical") {
            deliverNotification(notification, spatialAudioCue=zones.getNearestZone());
        } else if (priority == "Low" && userContext == "InMeeting") {
            suppressNotification(notification);
        } else {
            deliverNotification(notification, spatialAudioCue=zones.getNearestZone());
        }
    }

    // 5. Adaptive Audio Control
    currentVolume = getCurrentVolume();
    if (zones.contains("ConversationZone")) {
        adjustVolume(currentVolume * 0.7); // Lower volume in conversation zone
    } else {
        adjustVolume(currentVolume);
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Voiceprint Integration:** Use voiceprints to identify individuals speaking and personalize responses.
*   **AI-Powered Sound Classification:** Implement an AI model to accurately classify a wider range of sounds.
*   **Multi-Room Integration:** Extend the system to manage acoustic zones and notifications across multiple rooms.
*   **Learning & Adaptation:** Allow the system to learn user preferences over time and automatically adjust settings.
