## Adaptive Sparsity Masking with Temporal Coalescence

**Concept:** Enhance neural network efficiency by dynamically adjusting sparsity masks *across time* during inference, guided by a temporal coherence metric. This moves beyond static or layer-wise sparsity, exploiting redundancy in activations and weights over consecutive inference steps.

**Motivation:** The patent details a reconfigurable memory architecture focused on optimizing memory allocation for different layer types. This suggests a system capable of fine-grained control over data movement and storage. While beneficial, it doesn't fully address the computational cost of processing *all* weights and activations. This design aims to reduce computation *in addition* to optimizing memory.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sparsity Mask Generator (SMG):** A dedicated hardware module that operates in parallel with the main neural network processing. 
    *   **Input:** Current layer's activations and weights, previous time step's sparsity masks, temporal coherence metric threshold.
    *   **Output:** Sparsity masks for the current layer's weights and activations.
2.  **Temporal Coherence Metric (TCM):** Calculates the similarity between the current and previous time stepâ€™s activations & weights. Possible metrics include:
    *   Cosine similarity of vectorized activations/weights.
    *   L1/L2 norm of the difference between activations/weights.
    *   Correlation coefficient.
3.  **Dynamic Sparsity Control:**
    *   If TCM exceeds a predefined threshold: Apply a higher sparsity level, aggressively pruning less important weights/activations.
    *   If TCM falls below the threshold: Reduce sparsity, retaining more weights/activations to maintain accuracy.
4.  **Hardware Implementation Details:**
    *   **SMG:** Implemented as a systolic array for parallel processing of activations and weights.
    *   **TCM Calculation:** Dedicated hardware block for fast calculation of the chosen similarity metric.
    *   **Mask Application:**  The sparsity masks are applied directly to the data stream using bitwise operations before multiplication and accumulation.
5.  **Pseudocode (SMG):**

```pseudocode
function generate_sparsity_mask(activations, weights, previous_mask, threshold):
  // Calculate temporal coherence
  temporal_coherence = calculate_temporal_coherence(activations, weights, previous_mask)

  if temporal_coherence > threshold:
    sparsity_level = HIGH  // Aggressive pruning
  else:
    sparsity_level = LOW   // Reduced pruning

  // Calculate importance scores for weights and activations
  weight_importance = calculate_weight_importance(weights)
  activation_importance = calculate_activation_importance(activations)

  // Create sparsity masks based on importance scores and sparsity level
  weight_mask = create_mask(weight_importance, sparsity_level)
  activation_mask = create_mask(activation_importance, sparsity_level)

  return weight_mask, activation_mask
```

**Refinement & Novelty:**

This differs from standard sparsity techniques in its *temporal* dimension. Static or layer-wise sparsity ignores the redundancy in consecutive inference steps. By dynamically adjusting the sparsity masks based on the temporal coherence metric, the system can reduce computational load without sacrificing accuracy. The reconfigurable memory architecture detailed in the patent provides a natural platform for implementing this, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of the dynamic sparsity masks. The hardware implementation with dedicated blocks for TCM calculation and mask application ensures low latency and high throughput.
