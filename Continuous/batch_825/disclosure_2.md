## Dynamic Contextual Overlay for AR/VR SLU

**Concept:** Extend on-device SLU to AR/VR environments by dynamically generating and overlaying contextual “tags” visible within the user's field of view. These tags aren't static labels, but actively adapt based on the user's gaze, audio input, and the environment's semantic understanding. This moves beyond simple voice commands to a more intuitive, visually-augmented interaction paradigm.

**Specs:**

**1. Environmental Semantic Mapping Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time video feed from AR/VR headset cameras, audio input, existing spatial maps.
*   **Processing:** Employ object detection, scene understanding, and SLU to identify and categorize objects within the user’s environment. Store identified entities in a dynamic knowledge graph.  Prioritize entities based on proximity to user gaze and audio cues.
*   **Output:** A dynamic knowledge graph representing the environment, with identified entities and their attributes. Confidence scores for each entity.

**2. Contextual Tag Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamic knowledge graph, user gaze direction (from headset tracking), user audio input, SLU results.
*   **Processing:** 
    *   Identify relevant entities within the user’s gaze cone.
    *   Generate lightweight, visually distinct tags for each entity. Tag content will be dynamic.  Examples:
        *   If user looks at a coffee mug and says "temperature", tag displays "Hot" or "Cold" based on sensor data.
        *   If user looks at a smart light and says "brightness", tag displays current brightness level with adjustable slider.
        *   If user looks at a door, and the system detects it is locked, the tag displays “Locked” and provides a visual unlock button.
    *   Tags should auto-scale based on distance to the user and be rendered to minimize occlusion of important visuals.
    *   Implement a 'tag density' algorithm.  If too many tags are generated, the system prioritizes the most relevant and displays a summary notification ("More interactive elements available").
*   **Output:** A list of 3D tag objects with text/interactive elements, position/orientation data, and rendering properties.

**3.  AR/VR Rendering Engine Integration:**

*   **Input:** List of 3D tag objects from the Tag Generation Module.
*   **Processing:** Render the tags into the AR/VR environment. Implement tag collision detection. Allow user interaction with tags (e.g., touch/gesture control).
*   **Output:** Rendered AR/VR scene with interactive contextual tags.

**4.  Speech-to-Tag Binding (STTB):**

*   **Input:** User audio input, STTB rule database.
*   **Processing:**
    *   The STTB rule database is a collection of rules that map spoken phrases to tag actions. Example: “What’s the status?” -> display status tag for the current focus.
    *   When the user speaks, the STTB module parses the phrase and attempts to match it to a rule.
    *   If a match is found, the corresponding tag action is triggered.
*   **Output:** Tag action command.

**Pseudocode (Tag Generation):**

```
function generateTags(knowledgeGraph, gazeDirection, audioInput):
    relevantEntities = findEntitiesWithinGaze(knowledgeGraph, gazeDirection)
    
    for entity in relevantEntities:
        tagContent = generateDynamicTagContent(entity, audioInput)
        tagObject = createTagObject(tagContent)
        
        position = entity.position
        
        tagObject.position = position
        
        addTagObjectToScene(tagObject)
        
    return scene
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simple voice commands by linking spoken language directly to dynamic visual elements *within* the user's environment. The tags are not static labels but actively adapt based on context and user interaction.  It’s a shift from "command and control" to "contextual awareness and augmentation."  The STTB module provides a critical link, enabling users to ask questions about their environment and receive visual feedback.
