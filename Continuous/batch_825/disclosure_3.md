## Dynamic Environmental Resonance System

**Concept:** Expand the idea of activity-based device recommendations to encompass *proactive* environmental adjustments beyond simple device state changes. Instead of merely reacting to detected sleep or wakefulness, the system anticipates and subtly *shapes* the environment to optimize for a desired state, leveraging multi-sensory stimuli.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Radar (person detection, proximity, subtle movement)
    *   Microphone Array (ambient sound analysis, voice command recognition, sleep sound detection)
    *   Temperature Sensor
    *   Humidity Sensor
    *   Air Quality Sensor (VOCs, CO2)
    *   Bio-signal Sensor (wearable integration - heart rate variability, skin conductance - optional, for personalized profiles)
*   **Actuator Suite:**
    *   Smart Lighting (full spectrum control, intensity, color temperature)
    *   Smart HVAC (localized temperature & humidity control, airflow direction)
    *   Smart Aroma Diffuser (scent blending & dispersal)
    *   Subtle Sound Emitters (binaural beats, pink noise, nature sounds - spatially distributed)
    *   Haptic Feedback System (localized vibration - integrated into furniture/bedding – optional)
*   **Core Logic – ‘Resonance Profiles’:**
    *   Each user has a ‘Resonance Profile’ – a continuously learning model of their preferences and responses to environmental stimuli.  This is built using implicit feedback (time spent in a given state, HRV during different stimuli) and explicit feedback (user ratings of environmental comfort).
    *   Profiles are categorized based on desired states: *Sleep, Focus, Relax, Energize, Social*.
    *   Resonance Profiles aren’t static. They adapt to the user's circadian rhythm, seasonal changes, and even external factors like weather.
*   **Anticipatory Engine:**
    *   Predicts user state transitions using time-series analysis of sensor data.
    *   Uses machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to forecast likely activities based on historical patterns.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION adjustEnvironment(userProfile, predictedState):
    // Fetch preferred stimulus parameters for predictedState
    stimulusParams = userProfile.getStimulusParams(predictedState)

    // Apply parameters to actuators
    lightingSystem.setColorTemperature(stimulusParams.colorTemperature)
    lightingSystem.setIntensity(stimulusParams.intensity)

    hvacSystem.setTemperature(stimulusParams.temperature)
    hvacSystem.setHumidity(stimulusParams.humidity)

    aromaDiffuser.blendScent(stimulusParams.scentProfile)
    aromaDiffuser.setIntensity(stimulusParams.scentIntensity)

    soundSystem.play(stimulusParams.soundscape)
    soundSystem.setVolume(stimulusParams.volume)

    // Optional: Haptic feedback adjustments

    // Log stimulus application and user response for learning
END FUNCTION
```

*   **‘Gentle Nudges’ Feature:**
    *   Rather than abrupt changes, environmental adjustments are gradual and subtle.
    *   The system prioritizes minimizing disruption while maximizing the desired effect.
* **Cross-Device Integration:**  Connects to other smart home devices (e.g., smart blinds, robotic shades) to further refine the environment.  For example, dimming lights and lowering shades to prepare for sleep.

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simple reaction to proactive shaping of the environment using a holistic, multi-sensory approach, personalized through continuous learning and subtle adjustments, going beyond 'smart' to 'resonant'.  Focuses on *anticipating* needs, rather than *responding* to them.
