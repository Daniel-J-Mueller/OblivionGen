## Adaptive Data Decay & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the tiered storage approach not just for replication/availability, but for *proactive* data decay based on query patterns and a reconstruction system leveraging predictive analytics. The goal is to minimize storage footprint without sacrificing query performance, adapting to time series data characteristics beyond simple age.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Profiling & Decay Factor Assignment:**

*   **Module:** `DataProfiler`
*   **Functionality:** Continuously monitors query logs. Identifies time series data segments exhibiting low query frequency (e.g., historical data rarely accessed).
*   **Metrics:** Query count per data segment (time range), time since last access, data segment age.
*   **Output:** Assigns a ‘decay factor’ to each data segment.  Higher decay factor = more aggressive decay. This is not a fixed value; it’s dynamically adjusted based on usage.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_decay_factor(segment_id):
    query_count = get_query_count(segment_id)
    time_since_last_access = get_time_since_last_access(segment_id)
    data_segment_age = get_data_segment_age(segment_id)

    base_decay = 0.01 // default
    decay = base_decay + (query_count * 0.001) - (time_since_last_access * 0.0005) + (data_segment_age * -0.0001)
    return clamp(decay, 0, 0.1)
```

**2. Data Decay Mechanism:**

*   **Module:** `DataDecayer`
*   **Functionality:** Implements the decay process. Instead of immediate deletion, this uses a probabilistic data reduction technique.
*   **Process:** Based on the decay factor, the module replaces data points with ‘placeholder’ values (e.g., null, mean, median). These placeholders maintain data structure for query compatibility but reduce storage requirements.  Higher decay factor = higher probability of placeholder replacement.
*   **Storage:** Placeholder metadata is stored, indicating the original data’s presence and potential for reconstruction.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function decay_data_segment(segment_id, decay_factor):
    for each data_point in segment_id:
        if random() < decay_factor:
            store_original_data(data_point) //Store for reconstruction
            replace_data_point(data_point, placeholder)
```

**3. Predictive Reconstruction Engine:**

*   **Module:** `ReconstructionEngine`
*   **Functionality:** Monitors incoming queries.  If a query requests data containing placeholders, the engine predicts missing values before returning the result.
*   **Prediction Methods:** Utilizes time series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).  Can also use interpolation techniques.  Algorithm selection is dynamic based on data characteristics.
*   **Reconstruction Trigger:**  Reconstruction is triggered based on query volume and prediction accuracy.  If prediction accuracy falls below a threshold, the engine retrieves the original data from archival storage.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function reconstruct_data(query, data_segment):
    if data_segment contains placeholders:
        predicted_values = predict_missing_data(data_segment)
        if prediction_accuracy > threshold:
            return predicted_values
        else:
            retrieve_original_data(data_segment)
            return original_data
```

**4. Tiered Storage Integration:**

*   **Hot Tier:** Stores frequently accessed data, minimally decayed.
*   **Warm Tier:** Stores less frequently accessed data, moderately decayed.
*   **Cold Tier:** Stores historical data, aggressively decayed. Original data archived for reconstruction.
*   **Dynamic Tiering:**  The system automatically moves data between tiers based on access patterns and decay factors.

**5. System Architecture:**

*   `DataProfiler` and `ReconstructionEngine` operate as microservices.
*   `DataDecayer` integrated into the data ingestion pipeline.
*   Communication via message queue (e.g., Kafka).
*   Data storage utilizes a distributed key-value store (e.g., Cassandra).



This system allows for significant storage reduction without compromising query performance by proactively decaying data and intelligently reconstructing missing values on demand. The dynamic tiering and microservice architecture enable scalability and adaptability to changing data patterns.
