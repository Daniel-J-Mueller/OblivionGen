## Dynamic Acoustic Feature Weighting via Neuromorphic Spiking Neural Networks

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic weight adjustment concept to *acoustic features* themselves, rather than just language model transitions. Employ a neuromorphic Spiking Neural Network (SNN) to dynamically weight the importance of different acoustic features (MFCCs, spectrogram bands, etc.) based on the utterance context. This creates a truly adaptive acoustic front-end.

**Specification:**

1.  **Acoustic Feature Extraction:** Standard acoustic feature extraction pipeline (e.g., MFCCs, filterbank energies) applied to the input audio.  The feature vector will be significantly larger than typically used - including a broader range of features.
2.  **SNN Architecture:**
    *   **Input Layer:** One neuron per acoustic feature.  Neuron firing rate corresponds to feature magnitude.
    *   **Hidden Layer(s):**  Multiple layers of spiking neurons with tunable synaptic plasticity (STDP - Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity).  The number of layers is a tunable parameter (e.g. 2-4 layers).
    *   **Context Input:**  Separate input neurons representing context information (user ID, time of day, prior utterance topic, current prompt). These neurons feed *forward* into the hidden layers, modulating synaptic plasticity.
    *   **Output Layer:**  Neurons representing the weighted importance of each input acoustic feature. Firing rate represents weight.
3.  **Training Phase:**
    *   Large corpus of labeled speech data.
    *   Supervised learning: Train the SNN to predict optimal feature weights for various contexts using backpropagation-through-time or similar techniques.  The target weights can be derived from ASR performance metrics.
    *   Unsupervised learning: Utilize STDP and Hebbian learning to allow the network to adapt to new contexts and improve performance over time.
4.  **Runtime Operation:**
    *   Audio enters feature extraction pipeline.
    *   Extracted features drive input neurons of SNN.
    *   Context information (derived from system state) drives context neurons.
    *   SNN processes input and generates output firing rates.
    *   Output firing rates are scaled and used to weight the original acoustic features.
    *   Weighted features are fed into the core ASR engine (e.g., HMM-GMM, deep neural network).

**Pseudocode (Runtime Operation):**

```
function processAudio(audioData, contextInfo):
  features = extractAcousticFeatures(audioData)
  
  weightedFeatures = []
  for i in range(len(features)):
    snnOutput = runSNN(features[i], contextInfo)  // SNN processes single feature
    weight = scaleSNNOutput(snnOutput)   // Convert SNN output to weight
    weightedFeature = features[i] * weight
    weightedFeatures.append(weightedFeature)

  asrResults = runASR(weightedFeatures)
  return asrResults
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Neuromorphic hardware (e.g., Intel Loihi, IBM TrueNorth) could significantly accelerate SNN processing and reduce power consumption.
*   GPU acceleration for SNN simulation is also possible.

**Novelty:**  Existing dynamic weighting schemes primarily focus on language model transitions.  This concept extends dynamic weighting to the *acoustic feature space* and leverages the unique capabilities of spiking neural networks for real-time adaptive processing. It moves away from purely statistical models of language, and towards a bio-inspired acoustic front end.
