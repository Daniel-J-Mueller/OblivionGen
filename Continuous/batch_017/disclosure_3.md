## Predictive Event Cascade Modeling

**System Overview:** A system designed to proactively identify and preemptively load event data *before* it is explicitly requested, anticipating user behavior based on learned event cascades. This contrasts with the patent's reactive approach of filling missing slices *after* a notification.

**Core Innovation:**  Instead of responding to missing event notifications, we *predict* what events will be needed.  We model event sequences (cascades) and pre-load likely future events into a localized, high-speed cache.

**Specifications:**

*   **Event Cascade Recorder:** A module continuously observing incoming event streams, identifying frequently occurring event sequences (e.g., 'page view A' -> 'add to cart' -> 'checkout').  Utilizes a sliding window to adapt to evolving user behavior.
*   **Cascade Probability Engine:**  Assigns probabilities to different event cascades based on historical data. Leverages Bayesian networks or Markov models for prediction. This probability is updated in real time.
*   **Pre-Fetch Manager:** Monitors user activity (initial events).  Based on the Cascade Probability Engine, it predicts likely next events and initiates pre-fetching to a localized cache (e.g., server-side or client-side).
*   **Localized Cache:**  A high-speed data store (e.g., in-memory cache, SSD) holding pre-fetched event data.
*   **Cache Eviction Policy:**  An LRU or LFU policy to manage cache space, prioritizing frequently accessed or recently pre-fetched events.
*   **Dynamic Cache Sizing:** Automatically adjusts cache size based on observed request patterns and pre-fetch accuracy.
*   **Event Data Format:**  Supports various event data formats (JSON, Protocol Buffers, etc.).
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/prefetch_accuracy`: Returns the accuracy of the pre-fetch algorithm over a specified time window.
    *   `/cache_status`: Provides real-time cache statistics (hit rate, size, eviction count).
    *   `/event_cascade_stats`: Returns statistical information on observed event cascades.

**Pseudocode (Pre-Fetch Manager):**

```
function handle_initial_event(event):
  cascade_predictions = CascadeProbabilityEngine.predict_next_events(event)
  for prediction in cascade_predictions:
    if prediction.event_data not in LocalizedCache:
      prefetch_task = TaskScheduler.schedule_task(fetch_event_data, prediction.event_data)

function fetch_event_data(event_data):
  # Fetch event data from primary events datastore
  data = PrimaryEventsDatastore.get_data(event_data)
  LocalizedCache.store_data(event_data, data)
```

**Novelty:**  This system proactively anticipates event requests, reducing latency and improving user experience.  Itâ€™s a shift from a reactive, missing-data-filling approach to a predictive, pre-loading one.  The integration of cascade probability models and localized caching enables significant performance gains.
