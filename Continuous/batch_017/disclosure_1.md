## Dynamic Content Encoding Profiles Based on Per-Device Energy Constraints

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust video encoding profiles – resolution, bitrate, codec – *not* based on network bandwidth, but on the *estimated remaining battery life* of the end-user’s viewing device.

**Components:**

1.  **Device Energy Reporting Agent:** Software component embedded within supported viewing devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, smart TVs with compatible APIs). This agent monitors battery state of charge (SoC), discharge rate, and estimates remaining battery life (in minutes). It transmits this information, periodically or on significant change, to the central server.  Privacy is addressed via anonymization and user consent.
2.  **Central Server – Energy Profile Database:**  Maintains a database mapping estimated remaining battery life ranges (e.g., 60-90 mins, 30-60 mins, <30 mins) to corresponding pre-defined encoding profiles.  Profiles specify codec (AV1, H.265, H.264), resolution (1080p, 720p, 480p), and bitrate ranges.  The database is configurable and allows for A/B testing of different profiles.
3.  **Encoding Profile Selection Service:** This service receives the estimated remaining battery life from the Device Energy Reporting Agent. It queries the Energy Profile Database to determine the appropriate encoding profile.
4.  **Modified Encoding Pipeline:** The existing encoding servers are modified to accept an additional input parameter – the selected encoding profile.  This parameter overrides any default or network-bandwidth-based encoding decisions.
5.  **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABR) Integration:** Integrates with existing ABR systems (e.g., DASH, HLS). The selected encoding profile dictates the *maximum* encoding levels available to the ABR algorithm. This prevents the device from requesting a high-bitrate stream that it may not be able to sustain without significant battery drain.

**Pseudocode (Encoding Profile Selection Service):**

```
function selectEncodingProfile(deviceBatteryLife):
    if deviceBatteryLife > 90:
        return "High_Quality_Profile" // 1080p, high bitrate, AV1 preferred
    else if deviceBatteryLife > 60:
        return "Balanced_Profile" // 720p, medium bitrate, H.265 preferred
    else if deviceBatteryLife > 30:
        return "Low_Power_Profile" // 480p, low bitrate, H.264
    else:
        return "Minimal_Power_Profile" // 360p, very low bitrate, H.264
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Communication Protocol:** Use lightweight protocols (e.g., MQTT, WebSockets) for communication between the Device Energy Reporting Agent and the central server.
*   **Privacy:** Anonymize device identifiers and obtain explicit user consent before collecting battery data. Offer users the option to disable the feature.
*   **Scalability:** Design the central server and database to handle a large number of connected devices.
*   **Device Support:** Initially target Android and iOS devices. Expand to other platforms as needed.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** In the future, incorporate machine learning to predict battery drain based on content characteristics (e.g., fast action sequences, high dynamic range) and user viewing habits. This could allow for even more personalized and energy-efficient encoding profiles.
