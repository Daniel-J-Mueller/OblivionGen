## Dynamic Subtitle ‘Ghosting’ & Predictive In-Painting

**Concept:** Leverage temporal coherence and advanced in-painting to not merely *remove* burned-in subtitles, but to dynamically ‘ghost’ them, then predict and fill the obscured regions with contextually-aware content, creating a smoother, more natural viewing experience. This goes beyond simple replacement; it proactively reconstructs the video frame as if the subtitles *never existed*.

**Specs:**

**1. Temporal Coherence Module:**

*   **Input:** Video stream, detected subtitle pixel areas per frame.
*   **Process:**
    *   Track subtitle pixel areas across multiple frames (e.g., 5-10 frames). This establishes a ‘ghost trail’ – a history of where the subtitles were.
    *   Calculate optical flow vectors within the subtitle area to understand the motion of the underlying content.
    *   Blur/feather the ‘ghost trail’ based on frame distance and optical flow magnitude.  Closer frames, slower motion = sharper ghost; further frames, faster motion = more blur.
*   **Output:**  “Ghosted” frames – frames where the subtitle area is semi-transparently overlaid with past frames' content.  

**2. Contextual In-Painting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Ghosted frame, detected subtitle pixel areas.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Semantic Segmentation:** Analyze the ghosted frame to identify objects and scenes within and around the subtitle area. (Utilize a pre-trained segmentation model, fine-tuned for video content).
    *   **Content Prediction:** Based on semantic segmentation, predict the likely content *behind* the subtitles.  
        *   If the subtitle obscures part of a face, utilize a facial reconstruction model to complete the face.
        *   If the subtitle obscures a building, extend existing building structures.
        *   If the subtitle obscures moving objects, extrapolate their motion.
    *   **Diffusion Model Integration:** Employ a diffusion model conditioned on the semantic segmentation and extrapolated content to generate a high-resolution in-painted region.  This ensures seamless blending and realistic detail.
*   **Output:**  Fully in-painted frame – frame where the subtitles have been replaced with plausible, contextually-aware content.

**3. Confidence Scoring & Adaptive Blending:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate a confidence score for the in-painting based on the diffusion model’s generation quality and the coherence of the predicted content with the surrounding frames.
    *   If the confidence score is low, fall back to a simpler in-painting method (e.g., interpolation or nearest-neighbor) to avoid introducing artifacts.
    *   Implement an adaptive blending factor between the in-painted region and the original frame.  Higher confidence = more reliance on the in-painted region.

**Pseudocode (Contextual In-Painting Engine):**

```
function inpaintFrame(ghostedFrame, subtitleArea):
  segmentationMap = semanticSegmentation(ghostedFrame)
  predictedContent = predictContent(segmentationMap, subtitleArea)
  inpaintedRegion = diffusionModel(ghostedFrame, predictedContent, subtitleArea)
  confidenceScore = evaluateInpainting(inpaintedRegion, ghostedFrame)

  if confidenceScore < threshold:
    inpaintedRegion = simpleInpainting(ghostedFrame, subtitleArea)

  blendingFactor = calculateBlendingFactor(confidenceScore)
  finalFrame = blend(ghostedFrame, inpaintedRegion, blendingFactor)
  return finalFrame
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU for diffusion model execution.
*   Pre-trained semantic segmentation and facial reconstruction models.
*   Real-time video processing pipeline.
*   Sufficient memory to store multiple frames for temporal coherence.
