## Dynamic Container Swarm Intelligence

**Concept:** Leverage the illuminated containers not just for identification and location *within* a system, but as a distributed, self-organizing network capable of influencing workflow and directing human/robotic activity. This moves beyond simple illumination to active guidance and process optimization.

**System Specs:**

*   **Container Hardware:**
    *   Existing Illumination System – Retain core functionality (programmable color, intensity).
    *   Micro-Orientation System – Integrate miniature, low-power linear actuators (piezoelectric or similar) into the container base. Allow for subtle tilting/rotation (approx. 5-10 degrees).
    *   Short-Range Communication – Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) mesh network.  Each container acts as a repeater, extending range.
    *   Proximity Sensors – IR or ultrasonic sensors to detect nearby containers and obstructions.
    *   Power – Rechargeable battery with inductive charging capability (via platform contacts).

*   **Platform Hardware:**
    *   BLE Mesh Network Integration – Platform acts as a central hub, receiving data from and transmitting instructions to containers.
    *   High-Resolution Overhead Camera – Captures a bird’s-eye view of the container field.
    *   Processing Unit – Dedicated processor for image analysis and swarm algorithm execution.

*   **Software – Swarm Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    // Initialization
    FOR EACH container IN container_list:
        container.status = "idle"
        container.target_location = current_location

    // Main Loop
    WHILE system_running:

        // 1. Task Assignment (Centralized/Decentralized)
        //    (Based on system needs - e.g., picking, sorting, shipping)
        FOR EACH task IN task_queue:
            best_container = select_best_container(task.criteria, container_list)
            assign_task(best_container, task)

        // 2. Path Planning & Guidance
        FOR EACH container IN assigned_containers:
            // A* or similar pathfinding algorithm, considering obstacles
            container.path = calculate_path(container.current_location, container.target_location, obstacle_map)

            // Micro-Orientation Guidance:
            FOR EACH step IN container.path:
                // Calculate angle to next step.
                angle = calculate_angle(container.current_location, step)
                // Rotate container slightly in the direction of the next step.
                rotate_container(container, angle * orientation_scale)
                // Illuminate container in the direction of travel
                illuminate_direction(container, angle)
                // Move container one step along the path
                move_container(container, step)

        // 3. Collision Avoidance
        FOR EACH container IN container_list:
            // Detect nearby containers using proximity sensors
            nearby_containers = detect_nearby_containers(container)
            // If potential collision, adjust path or pause
            IF potential_collision(container, nearby_containers):
                adjust_path(container) OR pause_container(container)

        // 4. Dynamic Re-organization
        //    (Based on workflow changes or container availability)
        IF workflow_change OR container_available:
            re-assign_tasks(container_list)

    ```

*   **Illumination Modes:**
    *   **Directional Guidance:**  Illumination focused in the direction of travel/desired movement.
    *   **Status Indication:** Color-coding based on container status (e.g., green = available, red = occupied, yellow = error).
    *   **Attention/Alert:** Pulsating/flashing illumination to draw attention to specific containers.
    *   **Workflow Highlighting:**  Illuminate a chain of containers to visually represent a process flow.



**Novelty:** This goes beyond passive location and identification. It creates a dynamic, responsive system where containers actively participate in the workflow, guiding personnel/robots and optimizing material handling. The micro-orientation system and swarm algorithm introduce a level of intelligence and adaptability not present in static inventory systems.  It moves toward a 'living' warehouse environment.
