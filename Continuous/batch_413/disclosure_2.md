## Adaptive Data Shaping with Predictive Pre-Processing

**Specification:** A system for dynamically altering the structure of incoming data streams *before* ingestion, based on predicted downstream processing needs. This expands on the ingestion policy concept by introducing a pre-processing stage informed by AI models.

**Components:**

1.  **Prediction Engine:** A trained machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) that analyzes historical data stream usage patterns. The model predicts the most likely downstream processing operations (filtering, aggregation, enrichment, transformation) for incoming data records based on metadata (source, timestamp, type) and limited content inspection.  It outputs a "processing profile" detailing the predicted operations and their parameters.

2.  **Data Shaper:** A configurable module responsible for restructuring incoming data records. It receives the processing profile from the Prediction Engine and applies transformations to the data *before* it’s ingested.  Transformations can include:
    *   **Field Extraction/Creation:**  Extracting specific fields, creating new computed fields, or adding placeholder fields for anticipated operations.
    *   **Data Type Conversion:** Converting data types to optimize for specific downstream algorithms (e.g., converting strings to numerical representations for calculations).
    *   **Data Normalization/Scaling:**  Applying normalization or scaling to numerical data to improve algorithm performance.
    *   **Data Compression/Decompression:** Compressing data to reduce storage/bandwidth, or decompressing data for processing.
    *   **Schema Alignment:**  Aligning the schema of incoming data with a predefined target schema for consistent processing.

3.  **Ingestion Policy Manager:** Extends the existing ingestion policy to include “shaping policies” that define which shaping configurations are applied to which data streams.

4.  **Feedback Loop:** Monitors the accuracy of the Prediction Engine. If downstream processing reveals incorrect predictions (e.g., unnecessary transformations were applied, required data was missing), the Feedback Loop sends data back to retrain the Prediction Engine, improving its accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Ingestion Node

onDataReceived(data, metadata) {
  streamId = metadata.streamId
  ingestionPolicy = IngestionPolicyManager.getPolicy(streamId)
  shapingPolicy = ingestionPolicy.shapingPolicy

  if (shapingPolicy != null) {
    predictedProcessingProfile = PredictionEngine.predict(metadata, data, shapingPolicy)
    shapedData = DataShaper.shape(data, predictedProcessingProfile)
  } else {
    shapedData = data;
  }

  //Normal ingestion process with shapedData

  if (downstreamProcessingErrors){
    FeedbackLoop.retrainPredictionEngine(metadata, data, downstreamProcessingErrors)
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **ProcessingProfile:** { operations: [ { type: "filter", field: "...", condition: "..."}, { type: "aggregate", field: "...", function: "..." } ], parameters: {...}}
*   **ShapingPolicy:** {streamId: string, predictionModelId: string}

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced downstream processing latency by pre-optimizing data.
*   Improved algorithm performance through data normalization and scaling.
*   Enhanced data quality by ensuring consistent data formats.
*   Adaptive and intelligent data ingestion based on predicted needs.
