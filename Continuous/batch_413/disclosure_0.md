## Dynamic Modality Weighting via Attention Mechanisms

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a dynamic weighting system for each modality (palm, infrared, etc.) during both training and inference. This system will leverage attention mechanisms to assess the relevance of each modality *per feature* rather than treating all modalities equally or applying static weights.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   Existing multimodal scanner (as described in patent claims - infrared source, camera, filters, polarizer).
*   GPU acceleration for attention layer calculations.
*   High-bandwidth memory for storing intermediate feature maps.

**III. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Feature Extraction:** Utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) for initial feature extraction from each modality image (palm, infrared). The CNN architecture should be consistent across modalities for initial comparability.
2.  **Attention Module:**
    *   **Input:** Feature maps from each modality.
    *   **Process:** Apply a self-attention mechanism (e.g., Transformer encoder layers) to each modality's feature maps *separately*. This captures intra-modality feature dependencies.
    *   **Cross-Modal Attention:** Introduce a cross-modal attention layer. This layer will take the attended feature maps from each modality as input and learn to weigh their contributions based on the overall context. The attention weights will be dynamically calculated based on the relationships between features from different modalities.
    *   **Output:** Weighted feature maps for each modality.
3.  **Fusion Layer:** Concatenate the weighted feature maps from all modalities.
4.  **Embedding Generation:** Process the fused feature map using further CNN layers to generate the first, intersection, and XOR embeddings (as described in the original patent).
5.  **Training:** Train the entire system end-to-end using a contrastive loss function that encourages distinct embeddings for different identities and similar embeddings for the same identity.

**IV. Pseudocode (Training):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Training data (modality image pairs, identity labels)

for each batch in training_data:
    // Extract features from each modality
    features_modality1 = CNN(batch.image_modality1)
    features_modality2 = CNN(batch.image_modality2)

    // Apply intra-modality attention
    attended_features_modality1 = SelfAttention(features_modality1)
    attended_features_modality2 = SelfAttention(features_modality2)

    // Apply cross-modal attention
    weighted_features = CrossModalAttention(attended_features_modality1, attended_features_modality2)

    // Fusion & Embedding Generation
    embedding_data = GenerateEmbeddings(weighted_features) //First, Intersection, XOR

    // Calculate Loss
    loss = ContrastiveLoss(embedding_data, batch.labels)

    // Backpropagation
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

**V. Inference Process:**

1.  Acquire multimodal image.
2.  Extract features from each modality.
3.  Apply the trained attention layers to dynamically weight the contributions of each modality.
4.  Generate embeddings.
5.  Compare embeddings with enrolled data to determine identity.

**VI. Novelty:**

This system introduces dynamic modality weighting via attention mechanisms, enabling the model to focus on the most informative features from each modality for a given input. This is an improvement over static weighting schemes or equal weighting, and should result in increased accuracy and robustness, especially in challenging conditions (e.g., varying lighting, partial occlusions). The attention mechanism will automatically learn the optimal weights, removing the need for manual tuning.
