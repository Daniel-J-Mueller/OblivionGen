## Adaptive Projection Mesh & Volumetric Calibration

**Concept:** Extend distortion correction beyond 2D pixel manipulation to create a dynamically calibrated, volumetric projection space. Instead of *correcting* distortion, proactively *model* the projection volume and generate projection data aligned with that model.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate time-of-flight (ToF) sensors *into* the projector housing. Multiple ToF sensors (minimum 4, ideally 8+) provide dense point cloud data of the projection surface in real-time. These sensors operate at a high refresh rate (60Hz+). Supplement with high-resolution cameras for texture mapping & color calibration.
*   **Volumetric Mesh Generation:**  Dedicated processing unit (FPGA or dedicated ASIC) processes ToF data to construct a dynamic, triangulated mesh representing the projection surface. Mesh density adapts based on the surface complexity and distance from the projector.
*   **Projection Data Generation:** Instead of calculating pixel positions on a flat plane, projection data is generated *directly* onto the volumetric mesh. This means each “pixel” is a virtual light source positioned within 3D space according to the mesh geometry.
*   **Rendering Engine Integration:** The rendering engine (responsible for generating the image content) must be modified to support outputting projection data in a mesh-aligned format. This might involve a custom shader or API extension.
*   **Adaptive Illumination Control:** For each virtual light source (mesh-aligned “pixel”), the system controls not only color and intensity but also the direction and spread of the emitted light.  This can be achieved using micro-lens arrays or digitally controlled light emitters.
*   **Real-time Calibration Loop:** The sensor data, mesh generation, rendering, and illumination control all operate in a closed-loop system.  Any changes in the projection surface (e.g., due to movement or deformation) are immediately detected and compensated for.
*   **Multiple Projector Synchronization:** Implement a synchronization protocol that allows multiple projectors to contribute to the same volumetric projection. Each projector is responsible for illuminating a specific region of the mesh.
*   **Material Properties Modeling:** Integrate algorithms that estimate the material properties (reflectance, roughness, etc.) of the projection surface. This information can be used to optimize the illumination and achieve a more realistic image.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Data Flow):**

```
LOOP:
    Capture depth data from ToF sensors
    Capture color/texture data from cameras
    Generate/Update 3D Mesh based on sensor data
    For each triangle in mesh:
        Calculate ideal illumination parameters (color, intensity, direction)
        Send illumination commands to light emitters
    Render image content onto mesh (shader-based)
    Repeat
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Holographic-like projections:** Create truly 3D images that appear to float in space.
*   **Interactive projections:** Allow users to interact with projected images using gestures or other forms of input.
*   **Augmented reality:** Overlay virtual objects onto real-world surfaces.
*   **Dynamic signage:** Create displays that adapt to changing environments.
*   **Medical imaging:** Visualize 3D medical data in a realistic and immersive way.
