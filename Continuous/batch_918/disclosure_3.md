## Dynamic Price Sensitivity Mapping & Personalized Offer Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *collecting* competitor prices to actively mapping customer price sensitivity *per item* and dynamically generating personalized offers based on this data, integrated with real-time competitor pricing.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profiling Module:**

*   **Input:**  Website browsing history (clicks, dwell time on product pages), purchase history, demographic data (opt-in), competitor price feeds (real-time API integration).  Data from the patent’s submission control is crucial here.
*   **Processing:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict a 'price sensitivity score' for each user, *per product category*. Features include:
    *   Historical purchase price for similar items.
    *   Time spent viewing product details.
    *   Number of times product added to cart/wishlist.
    *   Competitor price for the same item.
    *   User demographics (age, location, income bracket - inferred/opt-in).
*   **Output:** User-specific price sensitivity profiles.  Stored in a scalable database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB).
*   **Data Feedback Loop:** Continuously update profiles based on user behavior *after* receiving a personalized offer (purchase, ignore, click-through).

**2. Dynamic Pricing Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Product cost, competitor prices (API), user price sensitivity profile (from Module 1), current inventory levels, profit margin targets.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Calculate a ‘base price’ based on cost + desired margin.
    *   Adjust the base price dynamically using the user's price sensitivity score:
        *   High sensitivity (price-conscious): Lower price aggressively.
        *   Low sensitivity (less price-conscious):  Maintain or slightly increase price.
    *   Implement a ‘competitor matching’ algorithm:
        *   If competitor price is lower, match or slightly undercut.
        *   If competitor price is higher, maintain price or offer added value (e.g., free shipping, extended warranty).
    *   Real-time A/B testing of different pricing strategies for different user segments.
*   **Output:** Personalized price displayed to each user for each product.

**3.  Offer Generation & Presentation Layer:**

*   **Integration with Website/App:**  Dynamic price updates on product pages.
*   **Personalized Promotions:**  "Limited-time offer just for you!" messages based on user price sensitivity.
*   **Tiered Pricing Options:**  Present multiple options with varying price/value combinations (e.g., "Standard," "Premium," "Economy") tailored to the user.
*   **‘Price Alert’ Functionality:** Allow users to set price alerts for specific products.

**4. Submission Control Enhancement**

*   The original submission control will function as an input into our price sensitivity mapping.
*   We will need to add a 'confidence' score to the submission, based on factors such as user history, submission frequency, etc.
*   Implement a fraud detection layer to filter out malicious submissions.
*   A submission from a user could, if valid, result in a discount being applied to that specific user.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Pricing Engine):**

```
function calculate_personalized_price(product_cost, competitor_prices, user_price_sensitivity, inventory_level, target_margin):
  base_price = product_cost + (product_cost * target_margin)

  price_adjustment = user_price_sensitivity * 0.15 // Adjust factor

  adjusted_price = base_price * (1 - price_adjustment)

  best_competitor_price = min(competitor_prices)

  if best_competitor_price < adjusted_price:
    adjusted_price = best_competitor_price * 0.95 // Undercut competitor

  if inventory_level < threshold:
    adjusted_price = adjusted_price * 1.1 // Increase price due to scarcity

  return adjusted_price
```

This system creates a dynamic pricing ecosystem where prices aren't just competitive, but *personalized*, maximizing both revenue and customer satisfaction. The submitted competitor pricing fuels the entire system, turning user contributions into a powerful engine for profit.
