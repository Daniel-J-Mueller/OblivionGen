## Dynamic Campaign Budget Allocation with Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the existing simulation framework to not only *predict* campaign performance but to *dynamically re-allocate* budgets across multiple concurrent campaigns in real-time, optimizing for overall return on investment (ROI).  This moves beyond simply optimizing *within* a single campaign to optimizing *across* a portfolio of campaigns.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time campaign performance data (impressions, clicks, conversions, cost).
    *   Historical campaign data (performance over time).
    *   Simulated traffic patterns (as currently exists).
    *   External data feeds: Economic indicators, seasonal trends, competitor activity, social media sentiment.

*   **Predictive Model:**
    *   Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) trained on historical and real-time data to predict future performance for *each* campaign.  Model should output a probability distribution for key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rate and cost-per-acquisition (CPA).
    *   Implement a multi-armed bandit algorithm (e.g., Thompson Sampling) to balance exploration (trying new budget allocations) and exploitation (sticking with proven allocations).

*   **Budget Allocation Engine:**
    *   **Optimization Function:** Maximize overall portfolio ROI (total revenue – total cost).
    *   **Constraints:**
        *   Total budget limit.
        *   Minimum/maximum budget allocation per campaign.
        *   Campaign-specific performance thresholds (e.g., minimum conversion rate).
    *   **Allocation Frequency:** Re-allocate budgets at least every hour, potentially more frequently based on campaign volatility.
    *   **Risk Management:** Implement a ‘safety net’ mechanism to prevent drastic budget shifts that could negatively impact critical campaigns. This could involve setting a maximum percentage change in budget allocation per period.

*   **Simulation Engine Integration:**
    *   The predictive model should be integrated with the existing simulation engine.  Before implementing budget changes, the system should simulate the predicted impact on portfolio performance.
    *   The simulation results should be used to refine the budget allocation strategy and identify potential risks.

*   **System Architecture:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop (Runs continuously)
loop:
    // 1. Gather Data
    realtimeData = getRealtimeCampaignData()
    historicalData = getHistoricalCampaignData()
    externalData = getExternalDataFeeds()

    // 2. Predict Campaign Performance
    predictedPerformance = predictCampaignPerformance(realtimeData, historicalData, externalData)

    // 3. Optimize Budget Allocation
    optimalAllocation = optimizeBudgetAllocation(predictedPerformance)

    // 4. Simulate Allocation
    simulationResults = simulateBudgetAllocation(optimalAllocation)

    // 5. Refine Allocation (based on simulation)
    refinedAllocation = refineAllocation(optimalAllocation, simulationResults)

    // 6. Apply Allocation
    applyBudgetAllocation(refinedAllocation)

    // 7. Wait (e.g., 1 hour)
end loop
```

*   **User Interface:**  Provide a dashboard that displays:
    *   Portfolio ROI.
    *   Individual campaign performance.
    *   Budget allocation recommendations.
    *   Simulation results.
    *   Key risk indicators.

*   **Scalability:**  The system should be designed to handle a large number of concurrent campaigns and data streams.
