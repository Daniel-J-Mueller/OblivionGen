## Adaptive Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Routing

**Concept:** Instead of *reacting* to congestion with route changes, proactively predict network bottlenecks and pre-route packets along optimized paths *before* congestion manifests. This moves beyond simple RTT-based adaptation to a predictive, topology-aware system.

**Specs:**

*   **Topology Mapping Agent (TMA):** Deployed at strategic network nodes (routers, major ISPs). Continuously monitors link utilization, latency trends, and performs lightweight topology discovery. This isn’t a full, static map – it’s a dynamic, probabilistic representation of network health.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine (PME):**  A machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory network) trained on historical and real-time data from TMAs. It predicts link saturation probabilities 5-10ms *in the future*. Key inputs: link utilization, latency trends, time of day, known event schedules (e.g., streaming events).
*   **Pre-Routing Protocol (PRP):** An extension to existing routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF).  PRP allows routers to advertise *multiple potential paths* for a destination, *each with an associated congestion prediction score* provided by the PME. Routers prioritize paths with lower predicted congestion.
*   **Packet Header Modification:**  Packets are subtly modified with a “predicted congestion path ID”. This allows intermediate routers to quickly validate if the packet is still on an optimal path. If significant congestion appears *despite* the prediction, routers can dynamically switch packets to a secondary path.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The system monitors actual path performance and feeds this data back into the PME to refine its predictive models.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// At TMA Node:
function collect_network_data() {
    // Collect link utilization, latency, etc.
    return data;
}

function send_data_to_PME(data) {
    // Transmit data to Predictive Modeling Engine
}

// At PME:
function predict_congestion(network_data) {
    // Run ML model to predict congestion probabilities for each link
    return congestion_predictions;
}

// At Router:
function receive_packet(packet) {
    // Extract destination address
    // Query PME for congestion predictions for paths to destination
    // Select path with lowest predicted congestion
    // Forward packet along selected path
}

function monitor_path_performance(path) {
    // Measure actual latency and throughput on path
    // Send performance data back to PME
}
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems react to congestion. This system attempts to *prevent* it by proactively routing packets along paths predicted to remain uncongested. It’s a shift from reactive adaptation to predictive optimization. The integration of a machine learning model for topology prediction and the pre-routing protocol represent significant innovations.
