## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning Doorbell System

**Concept:** Expand the doorbell's awareness beyond simple motion/button presses to create localized audio 'zones' around the doorbell, triggering different actions and notifications based on the *source* and *intensity* of sounds detected. This moves beyond basic 'someone is at the door' functionality to contextual awareness.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Array:**  Minimum 8 element circular microphone array (MEMS based for size/cost) surrounding the camera.  Each microphone individually amplified and digitized.
*   **Directional Audio Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP chip with beamforming and sound source localization algorithms.  Must support real-time processing of microphone array data.
*   **Acoustic Event Library:**  Pre-trained machine learning model capable of identifying common sounds (dog barking, baby crying, glass breaking, specific vocal commands – “hello”, “package”, etc.).  Model updatable OTA (Over The Air).
*   **Zonal Trigger Configuration:**  User-definable 'zones' around the doorbell (e.g., Front Yard, Driveway, Sidewalk).  Each zone associated with configurable actions.
*   **Enhanced Speaker System:**  High fidelity speaker capable of directional audio output.
*   **Integration with existing doorbell components:** Camera, battery, power manager, communication module (WiFi/Cellular).

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Beamforming & Source Localization:**
    *   Continuously analyze microphone array data using beamforming algorithms to determine the direction of incoming sounds.
    *   Triangulate sound source location based on time-of-arrival differences at each microphone.
    *   Calculate sound intensity and categorize sound events using the Acoustic Event Library.

2.  **Zonal Trigger Logic:**
    *   Compare sound source location to configured zones.
    *   If a sound event originates from within a defined zone *and* meets intensity/event type criteria, trigger associated actions.
        *   Examples:
            *   "Driveway" zone detects "car door closing" -> send notification "Vehicle arrived"
            *   "Front Yard" zone detects "dog barking" -> initiate recording and send notification "Dog detected"
            *   “Sidewalk” zone detects “glass breaking” ->  Initiate recording, send immediate notification with live feed access, potentially notify emergency services.
            *   "All Zones" detects "baby crying" - Immediately activate two way communication and prioritize the event to the connected device.

3. **Adaptive Acoustic Masking:**
    * Employ a system that actively monitors ambient noise and dynamically adjusts the sensitivity of the microphone array to filter out common background sounds (e.g., traffic, wind).
    * This allows for more accurate detection of relevant sounds and reduces false positives.

4. **User Interface:**
    *  Mobile app for configuring zones, assigning actions, managing acoustic event library, and viewing event history.
    *  Ability to prioritize certain sound events over others.
    *  Adjustable sensitivity levels for each zone.

**Pseudocode (Zonal Trigger Logic):**

```
FOR each sound event detected:
    sound_location = calculate_sound_location(sound_event)
    FOR each configured zone:
        IF sound_location WITHIN zone:
            IF sound_event MATCHES zone's event criteria:
                IF sound_event intensity > zone's sensitivity threshold:
                    EXECUTE zone's action (e.g., send notification, initiate recording, activate speaker)
                    BREAK # Exit inner loop after triggering action
    END FOR
END FOR
```

**Novelty:** Existing doorbells primarily react to button presses, motion, or basic sound detection. This system moves beyond reactive behavior to *proactive* acoustic awareness, enabling more nuanced and contextually relevant responses. It transforms the doorbell from a simple notification device to a localized acoustic sensor network.
