## Dynamic Endpoint Sharding via Command-Chained URIs

**Concept:** Extend the existing command-encoding within the URI to not just *select* executable code, but to *shard* the endpoint itself. Instead of a single endpoint resolving the request, the command within the URI dictates how the request is broken down and processed by multiple, smaller endpoints. This leverages parallel processing and functional decomposition for improved scalability and resilience.

**Specs:**

*   **URI Format:** `uri://service?command=<primary_command>&shard=<shard_id>&data=<serialized_data>`
*   **Command Hierarchy:**  Commands aren't just actions, but *delegation* instructions. A primary command triggers a “master” function that then determines which subsequent “shard” commands are executed in parallel.
*   **Shard Resolution Service:** A new service responsible for interpreting the `shard` parameter. This service maintains a mapping of `shard_id` to specific endpoint locations.
*   **Data Serialization:** `serialized_data` uses a standardized format (e.g., Protocol Buffers, Apache Avro) to facilitate data transfer between shards.
*   **Shard Orchestration:** The “master” function, triggered by the primary command, receives the `serialized_data` and distributes relevant portions to the identified shards.
*   **Result Aggregation:**  Shards process their data and return partial results. The “master” function aggregates these partial results into a final response.
*   **Endpoint Types:** Shards can be implemented as diverse endpoint types: web services, message queues, serverless functions, etc.

**Pseudocode (Master Function):**

```
function processRequest(uri):
    command = extractCommand(uri)
    shardId = extractShardId(uri)
    serializedData = extractData(uri)

    //Determine shard endpoints based on shardId
    shardEndpoints = getShardEndpoints(shardId)

    //Distribute data to shards
    for shardEndpoint in shardEndpoints:
        shardData = splitData(serializedData, shardEndpoint) //Partition data based on shard
        sendRequest(shardEndpoint, shardData)

    //Collect results from shards
    shardResults = collectResponses()

    //Aggregate results
    finalResult = aggregateResults(shardResults)

    return finalResult
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Client sends request with command-encoded URI.
2.  Routing service directs request to the “master” function based on the primary command.
3.  “Master” function determines shard endpoints based on `shardId`.
4.  “Master” function splits data and sends portions to respective shards.
5.  Shards process data and return partial results.
6.  “Master” function aggregates partial results and returns final response to client.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Image/Video Processing:** Split a large image or video into segments, process each segment on a different shard, and then reassemble the results.
*   **Data Analytics:** Distribute a large dataset across multiple shards for parallel processing and analysis.
*   **Complex Calculations:** Break down a complex calculation into smaller steps and execute each step on a different shard.
*   **Real-Time Data Streams:** Process real-time data streams in parallel by distributing the data across multiple shards.
