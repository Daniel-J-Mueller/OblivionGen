## Dynamic Snapshot Composition with Predictive Pre-fetching

**Concept:** Extend the snapshot system to allow *composition* of snapshots from multiple sources *before* a restore operation is initiated, driven by predictive pre-fetching based on historical usage patterns. This isn’t just about re-encrypting for different extensions, but actively *building* a customized snapshot image tailored to the requesting extension’s needs *before* the request completes.

**Specs:**

*   **Component: Predictive Snapshot Assembler (PSA)**: A service responsible for analyzing historical data volume access patterns, identifying frequently co-accessed data blocks, and pre-assembling virtual snapshots.
*   **Data Store: Co-Access Metadata Database**: Stores historical data access logs, mapping data blocks to access frequencies and co-accessing blocks. Indexed by customer/extension ID.
*   **API: `PreAssembleSnapshot(extensionID, volumeID, priority)`**:  Initiates a pre-assembly process. `priority` allows for throttling/QoS. Returns a temporary snapshot ID.
*   **Data Format: Layered Snapshot Image (LSI)**: A snapshot format consisting of base layers (original snapshot data) and delta layers (pre-fetched, co-accessed data blocks).  Each layer is individually encrypted using the destination extension’s key.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  Extension requests a restore.
    2.  System checks for a pre-assembled snapshot (using `extensionID`, `volumeID`).
    3.  If found, the LSI is delivered directly.
    4.  If not found:
        *   PSA analyzes historical data for `extensionID` and `volumeID`.
        *   PSA identifies frequently co-accessed blocks *not* already in the base snapshot.
        *   PSA initiates data retrieval of these blocks from the original data stores.
        *   Retrieved blocks are encrypted with the destination extension’s key and packaged as delta layers.
        *   A temporary LSI is created, referencing the base snapshot and the delta layers.
        *   The LSI is cached (TTL based on access patterns).
        *   The LSI is delivered to the extension.

**Pseudocode (PSA - `PreAssembleSnapshot` function):**

```pseudocode
function PreAssembleSnapshot(extensionID, volumeID, priority):
  // 1. Check Cache
  cachedSnapshotID = CheckCache(extensionID, volumeID)
  if cachedSnapshotID != null:
    return cachedSnapshotID

  // 2. Retrieve Base Snapshot Metadata
  baseSnapshotMetadata = GetBaseSnapshotMetadata(volumeID)

  // 3. Analyze Co-Access Patterns
  coAccessedBlocks = AnalyzeCoAccessPatterns(extensionID, volumeID, baseSnapshotMetadata)

  // 4. Fetch Delta Blocks
  deltaBlocks = FetchDeltaBlocks(coAccessedBlocks)

  // 5. Encrypt Delta Blocks
  encryptedDeltaBlocks = EncryptBlocks(deltaBlocks, GetExtensionKey(extensionID))

  // 6. Create Layered Snapshot Image (LSI)
  lsi = CreateLSI(baseSnapshotMetadata, encryptedDeltaBlocks)

  // 7. Cache LSI
  CacheLSI(lsi, extensionID, volumeID, CalculateTTL(extensionID, volumeID))

  return lsi.snapshotID
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced restore times:  Frequently accessed data is already pre-fetched and pre-processed.
*   Optimized bandwidth: Only necessary data is transferred.
*   Improved user experience: Faster application startup and data access.
*   Enhanced security: Delta layers are encrypted specifically for the requesting extension.
