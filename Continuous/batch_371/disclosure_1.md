**Automated Neural Network 'Self-Surgery' via Dynamic Sparsity & Reconnection**

**Concept:** Extend the compression profile search to not just *remove* weights (pruning), but actively *reconnect* remaining weights in novel configurations *during* the compression search itself. This creates a dynamic, ‘self-healing’ network that adapts its architecture to minimize performance loss *and* potentially improve generalization.

**Specs:**

1.  **Dynamic Graph Module:** A software module that enables modification of neural network graph structure *during* training/compression.  This isn't simple pruning – it supports adding new connections, removing existing ones, and even shifting weights between layers.  Must interface directly with existing deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).

2.  **Reconnection Policy Engine:**  This engine dictates *how* reconnections are made. Parameters include:
    *   `Reconnection Granularity`: (Fine-grained – individual weights, Coarse-grained – entire layers/channels).
    *   `Reconnection Radius`: Maximum ‘distance’ (in layers) a connection can span.
    *   `Reconnection Criteria`:  Rules for selecting which weights to reconnect. Examples:
        *   ‘Connect weights with high activation correlation across layers.’
        *   ‘Reconnect weights that were previously pruned but have high gradient magnitude.’
        *    ‘Introduce skip connections between layers with divergent feature distributions’.

3.  **Compression Profile Search Integration:** Modify the existing compression profile search to include the reconnection policy as a tunable parameter. The search space now includes *both* pruning and reconnection strategies.

4.  **Performance Evaluation Metric:** Add a ‘network plasticity’ metric to the performance evaluation.  This measures how readily the network adapts to compression.  A highly plastic network is less vulnerable to performance degradation from pruning.  Calculated as the ratio of new connections created to connections pruned during compression.

5.  **Execution Flow:**

    ```pseudocode
    // Initial Network: Trained Model
    Network = LoadModel()

    // Search Parameters
    SearchPolicy = InitializeSearchPolicy() // Initial pruning/reconnection rules
    SearchCriteria = DefineSearchCriteria() // Performance threshold, time limit
    IterationCount = 0

    while (SearchCriteria not met) {
        // 1. Generate Compression Profile:
        CompressionProfile = GenerateProfile(SearchPolicy)

        // 2. Apply Compression Profile:
        CompressedNetwork = ApplyCompression(Network, CompressionProfile)

        // 3. Evaluate Performance:
        PerformanceMetrics = Evaluate(CompressedNetwork, ValidationDataset)
        PlasticityMetric = CalculatePlasticity(CompressedNetwork)

        // 4. Update Search Policy:
        SearchPolicy = UpdatePolicy(SearchPolicy, PerformanceMetrics, PlasticityMetric)

        IterationCount = IterationCount + 1
    }

    // Return Best Compression Profile and Updated Search Policy
    Return CompressionProfile, SearchPolicy
    ```

6. **Hardware Acceleration:** Explore leveraging sparse matrix operations and specialized hardware (e.g., neuromorphic chips) to accelerate the dynamic graph manipulation and inference.

This approach moves beyond static compression to create a more adaptable and resilient neural network that can potentially maintain high performance even under aggressive compression rates. It's a form of ‘neural evolution’ guided by the compression profile search.
