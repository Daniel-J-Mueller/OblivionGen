## Adaptive Content Prefetching Based on Predicted User Action & Device State

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Prefetch Engine (PPE)
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User Interaction History (clicks, scrolls, dwell time, purchase history).
    *   Real-time Device State (battery level, network connectivity – WiFi quality, 5G signal strength, CPU load, memory usage).
    *   Content Metadata (page type, content size, dependencies – images, scripts, videos).
    *   Contextual Data (time of day, location – coarse-grained, user demographics – anonymized).
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Hybrid model combining:
    *   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN):**  Predicts sequential user actions (e.g., navigating to a product detail page after viewing a category listing). Trained on interaction history.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning (RL) Agent:**  Dynamically adjusts prefetching strategy based on real-time device state and network conditions.  Reward function prioritizes successful prefetches (content available when requested) while penalizing unnecessary prefetches (wasting battery/bandwidth).
*   **Prefetching Mechanism:**  Utilizes HTTP/3 (QUIC) for prioritized and reliable content delivery.  Supports both server-push and client-initiated prefetching.  Adaptive bitrate streaming for video content.
*   **Client-Side Component:** Lightweight JavaScript library that monitors device state, reports it to the server, and handles prefetched content.  Implements caching mechanism.
*   **Server-Side Component:**  API endpoint that receives device state and returns a list of recommended content to prefetch.  Manages content caching.

**Innovation Description:**

The system aims to *proactively* deliver content based not only on predicted user actions but also on the *current capabilities* of their device. This goes beyond simple behavioral prefetching. A user browsing on a low-power device with a weak connection will receive a *different* prefetching strategy than a user on a high-end device with a robust connection.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side – API Endpoint):**

```
function getPrefetchRecommendations(deviceId, deviceState, userHistory, currentContext):
  // 1. Predict next likely actions using RNN model
  predictedActions = predictNextActions(userHistory)

  // 2. Evaluate device capabilities based on deviceState (battery, network, CPU)
  deviceScore = calculateDeviceScore(deviceState)

  // 3. Filter predicted actions based on deviceScore (prioritize lightweight content for low-score devices)
  filteredActions = filterActionsByDeviceScore(predictedActions, deviceScore)

  // 4. Calculate content dependencies for filtered actions (images, scripts, etc.)
  contentDependencies = getContentDependencies(filteredActions)

  // 5. Apply reinforcement learning reward function to optimize content selection
  optimizedContent = optimizeContentWithRL(contentDependencies)

  // 6. Return list of recommended content to prefetch
  return optimizedContent
```

**Key Features & Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Prefetching:** Dynamically adjusts prefetching strategy based on device capabilities.
