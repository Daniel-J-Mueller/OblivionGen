## Dynamic Persona Blending for Multi-User Dialog

**Concept:** Extend the multi-turn dialog system to dynamically blend user personas during a single session, creating a collaborative and adaptive conversational experience. This moves beyond simply *recognizing* different users to actively weaving their preferences and knowledge into a unified dialog flow.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Profile Construction:** Each user maintains a dynamic persona profile. This profile isn’t static but is continuously updated based on:
    *   Explicit preferences (e.g., stated interests, preferred tone).
    *   Implicit behaviors (e.g., topics discussed, question types, emotional tone).
    *   Knowledge graph construction – automatically built based on user utterances.
*   **Session Persona Aggregation:** When multiple users engage in a dialog session, a 'Session Persona' is created. This isn't a simple average of individual profiles but a weighted blend determined by:
    *   **Engagement Level:** Active speaker has higher weighting.
    *   **Topic Relevance:** User’s expertise in the current topic increases weighting.
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** System detects conflicting preferences (e.g., User A prefers formal tone, User B prefers informal).  It dynamically adjusts weights or introduces mediating phrasing.
*   **Dialog Flow Adaptation:** The system modifies dialog flow based on the Session Persona:
    *   **Knowledge Integration:**  Draws upon the combined knowledge graphs of all active users. If User A knows about “quantum physics” and User B knows about “astronomy,” the system can synthesize information from both domains when discussing related topics.
    *   **Response Style:** Generates responses that reflect the blended tonal preferences of the users.
    *   **Proactive Suggestion:** Anticipates user needs based on the combined profile.  "Given User A's interest in renewable energy and User B's experience with smart home technology, would you like me to search for solar panel installation options?"
*   **Conflict Management Module:** A dedicated module handles conflicting user preferences:
    *   **Preference Detection:** Identifies conflicting preferences in real-time.
    *   **Resolution Strategies:**
        *   **Compromise:** Generate responses that attempt to satisfy both preferences.
        *   **Negotiation:** Prompt users to clarify their preferences ("User A prefers a formal tone, User B prefers informal. Which style should I use for this response?").
        *   **Adaptive Framing:**  Present information in multiple ways to appeal to different preferences.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `UserPersona`:
        *   `userID`: Unique identifier.
        *   `explicitPreferences`: Dictionary of stated preferences.
        *   `implicitBehaviors`: History of user interactions.
        *   `knowledgeGraph`: Graph database of user knowledge.
    *   `SessionPersona`:
        *   `sessionID`: Unique identifier.
        *   `userProfiles`: List of `UserPersona` objects.
        *   `weightingFactors`: Dictionary of weights for each user based on engagement and relevance.
        *   `blendedKnowledgeGraph`: Combined knowledge graph based on weighted user profiles.

**Pseudocode (Session Persona Aggregation):**

```
function aggregateSessionPersona(sessionID):
  sessionPersona = new SessionPersona(sessionID)
  userProfiles = getUserProfilesForSession(sessionID)

  for userProfile in userProfiles:
    engagementWeight = calculateEngagementWeight(userProfile)
    relevanceWeight = calculateRelevanceWeight(userProfile, currentTopic)
    totalWeight = engagementWeight + relevanceWeight
    sessionPersona.addUserProfile(userProfile, totalWeight)

  sessionPersona.buildBlendedKnowledgeGraph()
  return sessionPersona
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Collaborative brainstorming sessions.
*   Multi-user tutoring and education.
*   Family decision-making (e.g., planning a vacation).
*   Team-based problem-solving.
