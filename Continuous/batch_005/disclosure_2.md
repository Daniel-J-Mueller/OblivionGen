## Dynamic Inventory Shadowing & Predictive Relocation

**System Overview:**

This system aims to proactively optimize item location within the materials handling facility *before* the user even reaches the pick location, based on predicted pick paths and real-time congestion data. It’s a departure from reactive prioritization and leans into anticipatory logistics.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Real-Time Location System (RTLS):**  Beyond tracking the user, RTLS tags are affixed to *all* inventory items – not just at initial storage, but *during* movement. This creates a dynamic ‘shadow inventory’ map. Low-power Bluetooth beacons or UWB are preferred.
2.  **Probabilistic Pick Pathing:** The system doesn’t just track *where* the user is, but *predicts* their next few picks. This utilizes historical data (user cadence, frequently co-picked items), current tote content, and even calendar data (e.g., anticipating higher demand for certain items on specific days).  A Bayesian network is used to calculate probabilities.
3.  **Congestion Mapping:**  Cameras and RTLS data combine to create a real-time heat map of facility congestion.  Not just physical blockage, but predicted slowdowns based on known bottlenecks and agent (human picker/robot) density.
4.  **Automated Item Shuffling:** The system uses mobile robots (AMR/AGV) to *proactively* move high-probability pick items closer to the user’s predicted path *before* they arrive. This is the key differentiator.
5.  **Dynamic Zone Assignment:** The facility isn’t statically zoned. Zones are temporarily redefined based on real-time demand and user paths.  An item might be momentarily assigned to a different zone to facilitate a faster pick.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
//Main Loop - runs continuously

For Each User in Facility:
    Update User Location (RTLS)
    Predict Next Picks (Bayesian Network, Historical Data, Tote Content)
    Get Current Congestion Map
    For Each Predicted Pick:
        Get Item Location (RTLS)
        Calculate 'Cost' to Pick (Distance + Congestion Penalty)
        If Cost > Threshold:
            Find Alternative Location (minimize Distance + Congestion)
            Send Robot to Move Item to Alternative Location
            Update Item Location (RTLS)
            Update Congestion Map (Account for Robot Movement)
            Update User's Predicted Path (Reflect New Item Location)
```

**Innovation:**

This goes beyond simply prioritizing processing times. It *reshapes the physical facility* to optimize the pick process *before* the user even arrives. This is proactive logistics, not reactive prioritization. The dynamic zoning and continuous item shuffling create a fluid, self-optimizing warehouse environment.
