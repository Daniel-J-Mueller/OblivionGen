## Dynamic Resource Prefetching Based on Predicted User Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the optimization framework to proactively prefetch content *not* immediately requested, but predicted to be interacted with based on real-time user behavior analysis. This moves beyond simply optimizing existing requests to anticipating future needs.

**Specs:**

**1. User Interaction Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Client interaction data (clicks, mouse movements, dwell time, scrolling speed, form inputs, etc.) streamed from the client device.
*   **Processing:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model user session behavior. The LSTM will be trained on a large dataset of user interaction patterns.
*   **Output:** A probability distribution over potential next actions.  For example: 70% probability of clicking on link 'A', 20% probability of scrolling down, 10% probability of submitting a form.  This distribution is updated in real-time with each user interaction.

**2. Prefetch Request Generator:**

*   **Input:** Probability distribution from the User Interaction Prediction Module, current page content (DOM structure, resource URLs), Optimization Information from existing system.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Identify resources associated with high-probability next actions (e.g., images for likely clicked links, data for anticipated form submissions).
    *   Apply Optimization Information to prioritize prefetches (e.g., prefer smaller image sizes, use cached versions).
    *   Generate a set of prefetch requests.  Limit the number of concurrent requests to avoid overwhelming the network.
*   **Output:** A queue of prefetch requests.

**3. Prefetch Execution Module:**

*   **Input:** Queue of prefetch requests, current network conditions (latency, bandwidth).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Prioritize requests based on estimated time-to-interactive (TTI).
    *   Execute requests using HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 to maximize concurrency and minimize latency.
    *   Cache prefetched resources aggressively.
*   **Output:** Prefetched resources available for immediate use.

**4. Adaptive Learning Loop:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data, prefetch success/failure rates, actual time spent loading resources.
*   **Processing:** Reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to adjust the prediction model and prefetch strategy. The algorithm will reward successful prefetches (those that reduce latency) and penalize unsuccessful ones.
*   **Output:** Updated prediction model and prefetch strategy.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Request Generator):**

```
function generatePrefetchRequests(userInteractionData, pageContent, optimizationInfo):
  predictedNextActions = predictNextActions(userInteractionData)
  prefetchCandidates = []

  for action, probability in predictedNextActions:
    if action == "click_link":
      link_url = extract_link_url(pageContent, action.link_id)
      prefetchCandidates.append((link_url, probability))
    elif action == "scroll_down":
      # Identify resources loaded on scroll
      prefetchCandidates.extend(identifyScrollResources(pageContent))
    # Add other action types

  # Apply optimization information (e.g., size limits)
  filteredCandidates = applyOptimizationInfo(prefetchCandidates, optimizationInfo)

  # Sort by probability and estimated TTI
  sortedCandidates = sortPrefetchCandidates(filteredCandidates)

  return sortedCandidates[:MAX_PREFETCH_REQUESTS]
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond request *modification* to proactive *anticipation* of resource needs. The reinforcement learning loop allows the system to adapt to individual user behavior and network conditions, maximizing prefetch effectiveness. The integration of a predictive model based on real-time interaction data is a key differentiating factor.
