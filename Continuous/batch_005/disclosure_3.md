## Dynamic Data Weaving with Predictive Schema

**Concept:** Extend the multi-format database approach by introducing a predictive schema layer that dynamically "weaves" data representations *during* query processing, anticipating needed formats *before* retrieval, and constructing them on-the-fly. This goes beyond simply selecting a format; it synthesizes data representations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Schema Engine (PSE):**

*   **Input:** Database query, customer profile (query history, data usage patterns, inferred preferences), real-time system load metrics.
*   **Process:**
    *   PSE analyzes the query, identifying data relationships and potential transformations.
    *   Utilizes a trained machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network with Attention mechanism) to predict the optimal data representation formats required for each data element based on customer profile and query characteristics.
    *   This prediction considers not just retrieval efficiency, but also downstream processing requirements (e.g., reporting, analytics, visualization).
    *   Generates a 'Data Weave Plan' outlining the necessary transformations and target formats.
*   **Output:** Data Weave Plan.

**2. Dynamic Transformation Layer (DTL):**

*   **Input:** Raw data (in potentially multiple formats), Data Weave Plan.
*   **Process:**
    *   DTL intercepts data retrieval requests.
    *   Executes transformations *on-the-fly*, converting raw data into the formats specified in the Data Weave Plan. This may involve:
        *   Schema mapping and data type conversion.
        *   Data aggregation and summarization.
        *   Data enrichment (e.g., adding calculated fields).
        *   Materialization of virtual data elements.
    *   Leverages a library of pre-defined transformation functions, optimized for different data formats and processing engines (Spark, Flink, etc.).
    *   Supports parallel transformation of data streams for high throughput.
*   **Output:** Transformed data in the desired formats.

**3. Adaptive Storage Orchestrator (ASO):**

*   **Input:** Data Weave Plan, transformed data.
*   **Process:**
    *   ASO dynamically assigns transformed data to storage locations optimized for the anticipated access patterns.
    *   Uses a tiered storage architecture (SSD, HDD, cloud storage) to balance performance and cost.
    *   Monitors data access patterns and adjusts storage assignments accordingly.
    *   Implements data replication and caching to ensure high availability and low latency.

**4. Feedback Loop:**

*   Data access patterns and query performance metrics are continuously monitored.
*   This data is fed back into the PSE to refine the machine learning model and improve the accuracy of format predictions.
*   The system learns from its mistakes and adapts to changing data usage patterns.

**Pseudocode (PSE - Format Prediction):**

```
function predict_format(query, customer_profile, system_load):
  // Extract features from query (keywords, data types, relationships)
  query_features = extract_features(query)

  // Extract features from customer profile (query history, usage patterns)
  customer_features = extract_features(customer_profile)

  // Combine features
  combined_features = concatenate(query_features, customer_features, system_load)

  // Predict format using trained model
  predicted_formats = trained_model.predict(combined_features)

  return predicted_formats
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Data Weave Plan:** JSON object containing a list of data elements and their corresponding predicted formats.
*   **Transformation Function Library:**  Hash table mapping data types and transformations to optimized code modules.
*   **Storage Assignment Table:** Hash table mapping data elements to storage locations.
