## Dynamic Precision Tensor Cores

**Concept:** Implement a tensor core architecture capable of dynamically adjusting the precision of its operations *during* computation, going beyond simply switching between pre-defined data types (like BF16/FP32). This allows for finer-grained control over accuracy and performance, optimizing for specific tensor regions and minimizing energy consumption.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Architecture:**  A modular tensor core composed of multiple “precision cells.” Each cell can operate at a programmable precision level, ranging from 4-bit integer to 64-bit floating point.
*   **Precision Map:** A companion "precision map" tensor is generated alongside the input tensors. This map is the same shape as the input tensors and dictates the precision level for each corresponding element in the input tensor. The precision map is generated by a separate “precision analyzer” module which profiles data characteristics (range, variance, error sensitivity).
*   **Data Pipeline:**
    1.  **Input:** Input tensors & Precision Map are fed into the Tensor Core.
    2.  **Precision Decoding:** A “Precision Decoder” reads the Precision Map and configures each Precision Cell with the appropriate precision level *before* data arrives.
    3.  **Data Routing:** Data elements are routed to the configured Precision Cells.
    4.  **Computation:** Each cell performs the tensor operation at its assigned precision.
    5.  **Output:** Output tensor is generated.
*   **Precision Levels:** Supported precision levels: 4-bit integer, 8-bit integer, 16-bit floating point (BF16/FP16), 32-bit floating point (FP32), 64-bit floating point (FP64). Additional custom precision levels via quantization/dequantization.
*   **Clock Gating & Voltage Scaling:** Precision cells operating at lower precision levels benefit from clock gating and voltage scaling to further reduce power consumption.
*   **Error Accumulation Mitigation:** Implement a dynamic error accumulation tracking mechanism. If error exceeds a threshold for a region, automatically increase precision in that region for subsequent operations.
*   **Programming Interface:**  API for specifying desired accuracy targets, error thresholds, and profiling parameters.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function DynamicTensorOperation(inputTensor1, inputTensor2, precisionMap, targetAccuracy):
  outputTensor = new Tensor(inputTensor1.shape)
  for each element in inputTensor1:
    precisionLevel = precisionMap[element.index]
    cell = getPrecisionCell(precisionLevel)
    result = cell.performOperation(inputTensor1[element.index], inputTensor2[element.index])
    outputTensor[element.index] = result
  return outputTensor
```

**Innovation:**  Existing tensor cores typically operate at a fixed precision or allow for limited precision switching. This concept introduces *dynamic, element-wise* precision control during computation, optimizing for both accuracy and efficiency, and enabling advanced techniques like adaptive precision for error mitigation.  It adds a substantial degree of freedom to hardware acceleration.
