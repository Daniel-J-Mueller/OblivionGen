## Dynamic Content Re-Allocation Based on Reader Engagement

**Concept:** Expand revenue allocation beyond simple sales rankings of physical books to incorporate *real-time* reader engagement metrics within the digital book itself. This shifts from passively observing physical sales as a proxy for interest to *directly measuring* how readers interact with the content.

**Specs:**

*   **Engagement Data Collection:** Instrument the digital book reader application (e.g., Kindle, Kobo, custom app) to collect the following data (anonymized and aggregated):
    *   Time spent on each chapter/section.
    *   Frequency of highlighting/note-taking.
    *   Search terms used within the book.
    *   Completion rate (percentage of the book read).
    *   Interactive element engagement (if the book includes quizzes, polls, embedded video, etc.).
    *   Social sharing activity (sharing quotes, passages, or completion status).
*   **Engagement Score Calculation:** Develop an algorithm to combine these data points into a single "Engagement Score" for each reader/user (or a representative sample).  Weighting factors would be adjustable to prioritize specific metrics.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculateEngagementScore(timeSpent, highlights, searches, completionRate, interactiveEngagement) {
        //Adjustable weights
        weightTime = 0.3
        weightHighlights = 0.25
        weightSearches = 0.15
        weightCompletion = 0.2
        weightInteractive = 0.1

        score = (weightTime * normalize(timeSpent)) +
                (weightHighlights * normalize(highlights)) +
                (weightSearches * normalize(searches)) +
                (weightCompletion * normalize(completionRate)) +
                (weightInteractive * normalize(interactiveEngagement))

        return score // Score between 0 and 1
    }

    function normalize(value) {
        //Scales value to between 0 and 1 based on max observed value.
        return value / maxValue //Max value tracked per book.
    }
    ```
*   **Dynamic Revenue Allocation:** Link the Engagement Score to revenue allocation.
    *   Establish tiers of Engagement Scores (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
    *   Allocate a higher percentage of revenue to the rights holder for books with a higher average Engagement Score.
    *   Introduce a “Reader Dividend” – a small percentage of revenue is pooled and distributed to rights holders of books with exceptionally high engagement.
*   **Real-Time Adjustment:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts revenue allocations based on *rolling* Engagement Scores (e.g., calculated daily or weekly). This allows for rapid response to changes in reader interest.
*   **Integration with Existing System:**  The new system integrates with the original patent's ranking of physical books, effectively combining external market indicators with internal reader behavior.  A blended score could be used.

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Digital book reader application with data collection capabilities.
*   Secure data storage and processing infrastructure.
*   Real-time analytics engine.
*   API for integration with existing revenue allocation system.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Incentivizes authors to create highly engaging content.
*   Provides a more accurate reflection of book value based on *actual* reader interest.
*   Creates a more sustainable revenue model for authors and publishers.
*   Generates valuable data for content optimization and marketing.
