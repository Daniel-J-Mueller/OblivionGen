## Dynamic Motion Baseline Calibration & Predictive Alerting

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple motion *detection* to establish a learned ‘normal’ baseline for a monitored space, then predict potential incidents *before* they fully manifest as triggered motion events. This involves a multi-faceted sensor array and a continuous learning algorithm.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Multiple PIR sensors (as in the base patent) – minimum of 4, strategically positioned to cover a volume, not just a plane.
    *   Microphone array (3+ mics) – for ambient sound analysis and directional sound source localization.
    *   Low-resolution thermal camera – to detect heat signatures and differentiate between animate/inanimate sources.
    *   Vibration sensor – attached to the structure (wall/floor) to detect subtle structural vibrations that might precede movement (e.g., someone approaching a door).

*   **Data Processing Unit:** Embedded system with sufficient processing power for real-time data analysis and machine learning.

*   **Learning Algorithm:**
    *   **Baseline Establishment:** During an initial learning period (configurable duration), the system builds a probabilistic model of “normal” activity based on sensor data. This model encapsulates typical patterns of PIR activation, ambient sound levels, thermal signatures, and structural vibrations.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Continuously compares real-time sensor data to the learned baseline.  Deviations are scored based on a weighted combination of sensor discrepancies.
    *   **Predictive Alerting:** When the anomaly score exceeds a dynamically adjusted threshold *and* exhibits a specific trend (e.g., rapidly increasing anomaly score), a “pre-alert” is generated. This pre-alert indicates a *potential* incident.
    *   **Confirmation Phase:**  The system monitors for *actual* motion confirmation via PIR or thermal detection.  If motion is confirmed within a short timeframe after the pre-alert, a full alert is triggered. If not, the pre-alert is dismissed as a false positive (and used to refine the learning model).

*   **Alert System:**
    *   Client device notification with pre-alert and confirmed alert status.
    *   Optional recording initiation upon pre-alert (short buffer).
    *   Configurable sensitivity levels and alert types.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
LEARN_BASELINE(duration);

// Main Loop
WHILE (TRUE) {
    READ_SENSORS(pir_data, mic_data, thermal_data, vibration_data);
    anomaly_score = CALCULATE_ANOMALY_SCORE(pir_data, mic_data, thermal_data, vibration_data);

    IF (anomaly_score > threshold AND anomaly_score_trend == INCREASING) {
        SEND_PRE_ALERT(client_device);
        START_RECORDING(buffer);

        // Wait for motion confirmation
        IF (MOTION_DETECTED() WITHIN timeout) {
            SEND_FULL_ALERT(client_device);
        } ELSE {
            DISMISS_PRE_ALERT();
            UPDATE_BASELINE(with pre-alert data as false positive);
        }
    }
}
```

**Refinement Possibilities:**

*   **Object Recognition:** Integrate a low-resolution camera (or utilize thermal data) for basic object recognition (e.g., person vs. pet) to further refine alert accuracy.
*   **Geofencing:**  Combine sensor data with geofencing to create activity zones and tailor alerts based on location.
*   **AI-powered behavior learning:** Adapt to user schedules and learn 'normal' behaviors to create more targeted and accurate alerts.
*   **Integration with smart home systems:** Control lighting, locks, and other devices in response to detected anomalies.
