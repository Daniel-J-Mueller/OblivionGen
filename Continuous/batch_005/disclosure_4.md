## Dynamic Seller Trust ‘Heatmaps’ & Predictive Availability

**Concept:** Extend the existing seller ranking system by visually representing seller ‘trust’ and ‘availability’ as a dynamic heatmap overlaid onto the product listing page. This isn’t just a score, but a visual, real-time assessment designed to influence purchasing *behavior* and proactively mitigate fulfillment risks.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Seller Score (as per existing patent).
    *   Real-time inventory levels (API integration with seller systems).
    *   Historical shipping performance (delivery speed, accuracy, damage rates).
    *   Customer review sentiment analysis (positive/negative keywords, emerging trends).
    *   External data feeds (e.g., weather patterns impacting shipping hubs, geopolitical events).
*   **Heatmap Visualization:**
    *   Overlay a color-coded heatmap onto the product listing (or dedicated ‘seller comparison’ section).
    *   Colors represent a combined ‘trust/availability’ score:
        *   Green: High trust, high availability.
        *   Yellow: Moderate trust/availability.
        *   Red: Low trust/availability.
    *   Individual data points visualized on the heatmap:
        *   Inventory level (represented by bar height/color intensity).
        *   Shipping performance (star ratings/icons).
        *   Recent review sentiment (positive/negative icons).
*   **Predictive Availability Algorithm:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to *predict* future availability based on historical sales data, seasonality, and external factors.
    *   Display predicted availability as a time horizon (e.g., "Available for shipment within 24 hours", "Low stock - may ship in 3-5 days").
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Heatmap colors and availability predictions update in *real-time* as data changes.
    *   Algorithm learns from past performance and adjusts predictions accordingly.
*   **User Interaction:**
    *   Allow users to hover over heatmap cells to see detailed data.
    *   Provide filtering options (e.g., "Show only sellers with guaranteed next-day shipping").
    *   Integrate with the ‘add to cart’ functionality – highlight the seller with the highest combined score.

**Pseudocode (Availability Prediction):**

```
function predict_availability(seller_id, item_id, historical_sales_data, external_factors):
    // 1. Load historical sales data for the item from the seller
    sales_data = load_sales_data(seller_id, item_id)

    // 2. Apply time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA)
    //    to predict future sales volume
    predicted_sales = forecast_sales(sales_data)

    // 3. Consider external factors (e.g., weather, holidays)
    //    to adjust the prediction
    adjusted_prediction = adjust_prediction(predicted_prediction, external_factors)

    // 4. Calculate predicted availability based on current inventory
    //    and predicted sales
    predicted_inventory = current_inventory - adjusted_prediction

    // 5. Return predicted availability (e.g., "In stock", "Low stock", "Out of stock")
    if predicted_inventory > 0:
        return "In stock"
    else if predicted_inventory > threshold:
        return "Low stock"
    else:
        return "Out of stock"
```

**Expansion:** Implement a ‘trust score decay’ mechanism. If a seller consistently fails to meet expectations (shipping delays, negative reviews), their trust score gradually decreases, even if they have a high historical score. This promotes accountability and incentivizes good performance.
