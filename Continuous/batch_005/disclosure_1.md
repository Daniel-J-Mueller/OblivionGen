**Adaptive Granularity Time Series Generation & Anomaly Detection**

**Specification:**

This system builds upon the concept of converting non-time series data into time series data, but introduces *dynamic* time windowing based on data volatility and predictive modeling. Instead of fixed ingestion intervals, the system adapts to the inherent "rhythm" of the data itself.

**Components:**

1.  **Volatility Monitor:** Continuously assesses the rate of change within incoming data portions.  Metrics include standard deviation, entropy, and rate of change of aggregates.

2.  **Predictive Model (LSTM-based):** Trained on historical data to predict future values for each metric.  The model outputs a confidence interval for its prediction.

3.  **Dynamic Windowing Engine:**  This is the core. It adjusts the length of the time windows based on both volatility *and* prediction confidence.
    *   **High Volatility / Low Confidence:** Short windows – prioritize immediate detection of anomalies (reactive).
    *   **Low Volatility / High Confidence:** Long windows – prioritize long-term trend analysis and predictive anomaly detection (proactive).

4.  **Anomaly Detection Service:** Standard time series anomaly model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).

5.  **Metadata Store:** Stores volatility metrics, confidence intervals, and window lengths for each data stream.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each incoming data_portion:
    Calculate volatility_metrics(data_portion)
    Predict future_value, confidence_interval = predictive_model(data_portion)

    IF volatility_metrics > threshold AND confidence_interval < threshold:
        window_length = short_window_length
    ELSE IF volatility_metrics < threshold AND confidence_interval > threshold:
        window_length = long_window_length
    ELSE:
        window_length = default_window_length

    Append timestamp corresponding to window_length to data_portion
    Send time series data to anomaly detection service
    Store volatility_metrics, confidence_interval, window_length in metadata store
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Raw data (non-time series) arrives.
2.  Data is portioned based on initial settings.
3.  Volatility is calculated.
4.  Predictive model generates a forecast and confidence interval.
5.  Dynamic windowing engine determines window length.
6.  Timestamp is appended, converting data to time series.
7.  Time series data is sent to the anomaly detection service.
8.  Metadata is logged for analysis and optimization.

**Novelty & Potential:**

This moves beyond *reactive* anomaly detection (detecting anomalies *after* they occur) toward *predictive* anomaly detection. By intelligently adjusting window lengths, the system can anticipate anomalies before they manifest, enhancing proactive monitoring and enabling faster responses. The metadata logging facilitates continual optimization of the dynamic windowing engine.
