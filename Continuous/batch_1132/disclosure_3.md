## Adaptive Routing Update Granularity

**Concept:** Implement a system where routing update granularity isn't fixed per protocol, but dynamically adjusted based on network state and predicted impact. Instead of flooding entire routing tables, or even just changed prefixes, updates are segmented based on 'reachability clusters' and propagated only to nodes demonstrably impacted.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Reachability Cluster Algorithm:**
    *   Nodes analyze their current FIB and identify 'reachability clusters'. A cluster represents a set of destinations reachable via a common next hop or a very limited path segment.
    *   Algorithm prioritizes clusters by 'criticality' – metrics including number of active flows traversing the cluster, and service level agreements associated with those flows.
    *   Clustering is recalculated periodically and/or triggered by topology changes detected via existing mechanisms (e.g., BGP keepalives, Link Layer Discovery Protocol).

2.  **Impact Prediction Engine:**
    *   Upon receiving a routing update, a node’s Impact Prediction Engine assesses how the update affects its current reachability clusters.
    *   The engine uses a localized graph representing the node’s view of the network (derived from FIB, RIB, and historical data).
    *   It calculates a ‘propagation score’ for each reachability cluster:
        *   High score: Update significantly alters reachability of destinations within the cluster.
        *   Low score: Minimal impact – alternative paths exist, or the destination is rarely used.

3.  **Granular Update Propagation:**
    *   Routing updates are segmented into 'cluster-specific payloads'. Each payload contains only the routing information relevant to a single reachability cluster.
    *   The node transmits cluster-specific payloads *only* to neighbors demonstrably impacted (propagation score above a threshold).
    *   Neighbor selection prioritizes neighbors serving as ingress/egress points for the affected cluster.

4.  **Update Acknowledgement & Reconciliation:**
    *   Receiving nodes acknowledge receipt of cluster-specific payloads.
    *   Acknowledgement data is used to refine the Impact Prediction Engine's accuracy and adjust propagation thresholds.
    *   A reconciliation process ensures that all nodes have a consistent view of the network, even if updates arrive out of order or are lost.

**Pseudocode (Impact Prediction Engine):**

```
function calculate_propagation_score(routing_update, reachability_cluster):
  affected_prefixes = get_prefixes_in_cluster(reachability_cluster) & routing_update.prefixes
  if len(affected_prefixes) == 0:
    return 0

  current_paths = get_paths_to_prefixes(affected_prefixes)
  new_paths = calculate_new_paths(routing_update, affected_prefixes)

  path_change_score = calculate_path_difference(current_paths, new_paths) # Higher score means more change

  flow_impact = calculate_flow_impact(affected_prefixes) # Number of active flows using current paths

  criticality_score = calculate_cluster_criticality(reachability_cluster)

  propagation_score = (path_change_score * flow_impact * criticality_score)

  return propagation_score
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced routing update traffic.
*   Faster convergence, particularly in large networks.
*   Improved network stability by minimizing unnecessary updates.
*   Adaptability to dynamic network conditions.
