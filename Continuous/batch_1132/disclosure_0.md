## Adaptive Core Geometry with Internal Actuation

**Concept:** A continuously manufactured fiber component utilizing an inner core with *dynamically adjustable geometry* during the weaving and curing process. Instead of a fixed or solely expandable inner die, this system introduces small, individually controllable actuators *within* the core itself. These actuators change the core's shape *during* fiber application, allowing for vastly more complex and customized component profiles than currently achievable.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Material:** High-strength, lightweight polymer composite (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced PEEK) with embedded micro-actuators. The polymer must be compatible with the curing process of the woven fiber.
*   **Actuator Type:** Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) micro-actuators or micro-fluidic actuators (allowing for pneumatic or hydraulic control). Actuators are arranged in a grid-like pattern *throughout* the core volume, not just on the surface.
*   **Actuator Control System:** A real-time control system receives design specifications (desired component geometry) and translates them into precise actuator commands. This would likely involve a finite element analysis (FEA) model of the core and fiber interaction.
*   **Fiber Application System:** The existing weaving system is modified to accommodate the dynamic core. Sensors monitor fiber tension and position relative to the changing core shape.
*   **Curing System:** The curing system must be compatible with the core material and actuator technology (e.g., UV curing, resin infusion).
*   **Cooling System:** Standard cooling system.

**Pseudocode for Actuator Control:**

```
// Input: Desired component geometry (point cloud or surface mesh)
//        Current core geometry (sensor data)
// Output: Actuator commands (activation levels)

function calculate_actuator_commands(desired_geometry, current_geometry):
    // 1. Mesh both geometries.
    // 2. Calculate the difference between the desired and current shapes at each point.
    // 3. For each actuator:
    //      a. Determine the influence area of the actuator on the core shape.
    //      b. Calculate the displacement needed in the influence area to move the core towards the desired shape.
    //      c. Calculate the required actuator activation level based on the displacement and actuator characteristics.
    // 4. Implement safety checks to prevent actuator overload or core damage.
    // 5. Return the actuator activation levels.

function main():
    desired_geometry = read_desired_geometry()
    current_geometry = read_current_geometry()
    actuator_commands = calculate_actuator_commands(desired_geometry, current_geometry)
    send_actuator_commands(actuator_commands)
```

**Novelty:** Current systems rely on *external* dies to shape the fiber component. This system integrates the shaping capability *within* the core itself, allowing for far more complex geometries and on-the-fly adjustments. Imagine weaving a component that subtly changes its stiffness or aerodynamic profile along its length â€“ or even adapting its shape in response to external stimuli. This opens doors to entirely new classes of lightweight, high-performance components.
