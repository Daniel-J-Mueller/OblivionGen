## Adaptive Contextual Priming for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend contextual entity resolution beyond reactive intent fulfillment to *proactively* suggest relevant information or actions based on predicted user needs derived from visual and auditory input. This moves beyond simply understanding *what* the user asks for, to anticipating *what they might need* next.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** "Anticipatory Context Engine" (ACE)
*   **Input:**
    *   Audio stream (same as current system).
    *   Visual stream (display content).
    *   User profile data (preferences, historical interactions).
    *   Real-time sensor data (location, time of day, activity – if available/permitted).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Integrate audio, visual, and user/sensor data. Employ a weighted averaging model to prioritize inputs (configurable per user/domain).
    2.  **Predictive Modeling:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on large datasets of user interactions, visual content, and contextual data. This RNN predicts the probability of various user intents *before* explicit utterance.
    3.  **Contextual Priming:** Based on the predicted intents, generate a set of “priming snippets” – short, informative suggestions or action prompts.  These snippets are rendered on the display *before* the user fully articulates their need.
    4.  **Adaptive Snippet Rendering:**
        *   **Priority-Based Display:**  Snippets are ranked by predicted probability. Highest probability snippets are displayed prominently.
        *   **Dynamic Content:** Snippets are dynamically generated based on the predicted intent.  Example: if the system predicts the user will ask for directions, display a map snippet with estimated travel time.
        *   **User Feedback Loop:**  Track user interaction with the snippets (click-through rates, time spent viewing). This data is used to refine the predictive model.
        *   **"Do Not Disturb" Mode:** Allow users to disable/customize the priming snippets.

*   **Output:**
    *   Priming Snippets (rendered on display).
    *   Refined Predictive Model (continuously updated).
    *   Intent and Context Data (for downstream applications).

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function process_input(audio_stream, visual_stream, user_profile, sensor_data):
    fused_data = multi_modal_fusion(audio_stream, visual_stream, user_profile, sensor_data)
    predicted_intents = predictive_model.predict(fused_data) // Returns list of (intent, probability)
    top_intents = get_top_n_intents(predicted_intents, n=3)
    
    for intent, probability in top_intents:
        snippet = generate_snippet(intent) //Creates visually appealing prompts based on intent
        display_snippet(snippet)

    return intent, context_data
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond resolving ambiguous requests, to actively *shaping* the interaction by preemptively offering relevant information. This transforms the device from a reactive assistant to a proactive partner. It’s about anticipating needs, not just fulfilling them. The adaptive weighting of multi-modal inputs provides a more robust and personalized experience.
