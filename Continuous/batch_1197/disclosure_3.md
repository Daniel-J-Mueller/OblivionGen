## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Behavioral Drift

**Concept:** Extend the dedicated resource cost tracking to incorporate *predicted behavioral drift* of customers. The current patent focuses on static dedication and compensates for unused capacity. This expands on that by predicting how a customer’s resource *needs* will change over time, and proactively adjusts dedicated resource allocation *before* they request it (or before performance dips). This allows for even more efficient resource utilization and potentially more accurate, predictive pricing.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Drift Modeling Module:**
    *   **Input:** Historical resource usage data (CPU, memory, storage, network) for each customer.
    *   **Algorithm:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet, ARIMA) to predict future resource usage. Incorporate external factors (e.g., seasonality, marketing campaigns, known product release dates) as input features.  Model outputs a probabilistic distribution of future resource needs.
    *   **Output:** A “drift profile” for each customer, indicating the predicted direction and magnitude of resource usage changes over a defined time horizon (e.g., 1 week, 1 month).  Includes confidence intervals.

2.  **Proactive Resource Adjustment Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Drift profiles, current resource allocation, predicted available capacity.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   If the drift profile indicates a *likely increase* in resource needs exceeding a threshold, *automatically* increase dedicated resources *before* the customer experiences performance degradation.
        *   If the drift profile indicates a *likely decrease* in resource needs below a threshold, *automatically* reduce dedicated resources, freeing up capacity.
        *   Implement a "buffer" period to prevent excessive oscillation due to short-term fluctuations.
        *   Prioritize adjustments based on a combined metric of predicted impact on customer experience and overall system efficiency.
    *   **Output:** Automated resource allocation requests to the infrastructure management system.

3.  **Dynamic Pricing Module:**
    *   **Input:** Predicted resource needs, current allocation, historical usage, and revenue goals.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   Adjust pricing based on *predicted* future resource needs, rather than solely on current usage.
        *   Offer tiered pricing based on predicted usage patterns (e.g., "Predictable Growth," "Seasonal Fluctuations," "Unpredictable Demand").
        *   Implement a "usage guarantee" – if actual usage falls below predicted levels, provide a partial refund or credit.
    *   **Output:** Adjusted pricing for each customer, communicated through the billing system.

4.  **Alerting & Feedback System:**
    *   **Monitoring:** Track the accuracy of drift predictions and the effectiveness of resource adjustments.
    *   **Alerts:** Generate alerts if predictions deviate significantly from actual usage or if adjustments cause unexpected issues.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Use real-time data to refine the drift prediction models and improve the overall system’s performance.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Resource Adjustment Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION adjustResources(customerID):
  driftProfile = getDriftProfile(customerID)
  currentAllocation = getCurrentAllocation(customerID)
  predictedNeeds = driftProfile.predictedNeeds // Vector of predicted needs over time
  threshold = 0.1 // 10% threshold for adjustment

  FOR each timeStep IN predictedNeeds:
    IF timeStep.predictedUsage > currentAllocation.resources * (1 + threshold):
      requestResourceIncrease(customerID, timeStep.requiredIncrease)
    ELSE IF timeStep.predictedUsage < currentAllocation.resources * (1 - threshold):
      requestResourceDecrease(customerID, timeStep.availableDecrease)
  END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

This system allows for a more anticipatory and efficient allocation of resources, potentially improving customer satisfaction, maximizing utilization, and optimizing revenue. It moves beyond simply reacting to current usage and begins to proactively address future needs.
