## Adaptive Packet Mirroring with Intent-Based QoS

**Specification:** A system for dynamically mirroring network packets based on application intent and real-time quality of service (QoS) metrics, extending the isolated packet processing cell concept.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely processing packets within a cell based on pre-defined rules, this system allows for *selective* mirroring of packets to a dedicated "observability cell" for deep analysis *without* impacting the primary forwarding path.  The mirroring decision is driven by application-defined "intents" (e.g., "debug authentication failures", "monitor transactions over $10,000") and dynamically adjusted based on network conditions.

**Components:**

*   **Intent Engine:** A programmatic interface allowing applications (via API) to define mirroring intents.  Each intent includes:
    *   Packet filters (e.g., source/destination IP, port, protocol, payload patterns).
    *   QoS thresholds (e.g., latency, jitter, packet loss).  Mirroring is triggered *only* if these thresholds are breached.
    *   Observability Cell destination (specific cell or load-balanced set of cells).
    *   Mirroring priority (determines which intents take precedence under contention).
*   **Mirroring Nodes:** Specialized nodes added to existing isolated packet processing cells, positioned *before* action implementation nodes. These nodes:
    *   Receive packets.
    *   Evaluate Intent Engine criteria.
    *   Duplicate and forward matching packets to the designated Observability Cell.
    *   Forward original packets to the action implementation node.
*   **Observability Cell:** A dedicated set of isolated packet processing cells designed for deep packet inspection, analytics, and security monitoring.  These cells have increased computational resources and specialized tools.
*   **Control Plane:** Manages intent registration, mirroring node configuration, and Observability Cell health.

**Workflow:**

1.  Application registers an intent with the Control Plane.
2.  Control Plane configures mirroring nodes within relevant packet processing cells to recognize the intentâ€™s criteria.
3.  Packet arrives at a mirroring node.
4.  Mirroring node evaluates the intent filters.
5.  If the filters match *and* QoS thresholds are breached, the node duplicates the packet and forwards one copy to the Observability Cell and the original to the action implementation node.
6.  Observability Cell performs analysis (e.g., intrusion detection, performance monitoring).
7.  The Control Plane continuously monitors QoS metrics and adjusts mirroring behavior (e.g., disabling mirroring for low-priority intents during peak load).

**Pseudocode (Mirroring Node):**

```
function processPacket(packet):
  intentMatches = checkIntentMatches(packet)

  if intentMatches:
    qosBreached = checkQosBreach(packet)
    if qosBreached:
      duplicatePacket = createDuplicate(packet)
      sendToObservabilityCell(duplicatePacket)

  forwardToNextNode(packet)

function checkIntentMatches(packet):
  // Retrieve active intents from Control Plane
  activeIntents = getActiveIntents()

  for intent in activeIntents:
    if intent.matches(packet):
      return True
  return False

function checkQosBreach(packet):
  // Retrieve QoS metrics for this packet
  metrics = getQosMetrics(packet)

  // Compare metrics to intent thresholds
  if metrics.latency > intent.latencyThreshold or metrics.jitter > intent.jitterThreshold:
    return True
  return False

```

**Novelty:** Extends isolated packet processing to *proactive* monitoring based on application-defined criteria *and* network performance, enabling dynamic, targeted analysis without impacting production traffic. This differs from simple packet mirroring by adding intent-based filtering and QoS-driven activation.
