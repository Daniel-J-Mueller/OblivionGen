## Dynamic Content “Taste Profiles” & Predictive Engagement

**Concept:** Shift from simply detecting bots to proactively tailoring content *density* and *type* based on real-time user interaction, creating a “taste profile” that forecasts engagement. This builds upon the existing idea of high-conversion content, but moves beyond validation to active user *steering*.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Standard User Agent/IP/Geolocation.
    *   Real-time dwell time on content blocks (primary & high-conversion).
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, depth, pauses).
    *   Mouse movements/click patterns.
    *   Content interaction (shares, comments, saves).
    *   Time of day/day of week.
*   **Profile Generation:**
    *   A “taste profile” is generated for each user (or session, for anonymous users) representing their content preferences and engagement patterns. This is a vector of weighted features derived from the data inputs.
    *   Initial profile is seeded with generalized “archetypes” (e.g., “news consumer,” “video gamer,” “social browser”).
*   **Content Density/Type Adjustment:**
    *   The system predicts the user’s likely engagement with different content *densities* (amount of content presented at once) and *types* (e.g., text, image, video, interactive).
    *   A/B testing is continuously performed in real-time, adjusting content density and type based on predicted engagement.  For example, a user with a high predicted interest in video may be shown a higher ratio of video content, while a user showing signs of information overload may be shown less content at a time.
*   **Bot Detection Integration:**
    *   Deviations from expected engagement patterns (based on the taste profile) can flag potential bot activity.  A bot may exhibit consistently perfect scrolling behavior or lack engagement with content types humans typically enjoy. This is secondary to proactive profile creation.
*   **Engagement Scoring:**
    *   A continuous "engagement score" is calculated based on interaction with content. This is used to refine the taste profile and personalize the user experience.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
FOR each user_session:
    initialize taste_profile with archetype
    
    WHILE session_active:
        collect user_interaction_data
        update taste_profile based on data
        
        predict engagement_score for different content_densities and types
        select content_density and type with highest predicted score
        display content
        
        IF engagement_score falls below threshold FOR extended period:
            flag_as_suspicious
        ENDIF
    ENDWHILE
ENDFOR
```

**Novelty:**

Existing approaches focus on *detecting* malicious actors. This system *proactively* shapes the user experience to maximize engagement and *indirectly* identifies anomalous behavior. It moves from a reactive security model to a proactive engagement model. The dynamic content density aspect, coupled with the predictive engagement scoring, represents a significant departure from current methods.
