**Adaptive Temporal Frequency Allocation for Multi-Camera Systems**

**Concept:** Extend the low/high-frequency separation technique to a multi-camera network. Instead of processing each frame independently, dynamically allocate frequency components *across* cameras based on motion and signal quality. Cameras detecting high motion or experiencing noise contribute more high-frequency data, while static or clean cameras focus on low-frequency detail. This creates a temporally-consistent, high-dynamic-range composite signal.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Camera Network Configuration:** System supports N networked cameras. Each camera possesses intrinsic calibration data (focal length, distortion coefficients).
2.  **Motion Estimation:** Each camera runs a lightweight optical flow algorithm (e.g., Farneback) to determine per-pixel motion vectors.
3.  **Noise Level Estimation:** Each camera estimates noise variance per frame utilizing a block-matching and 3D filtering algorithm.
4.  **Frequency Allocation Map Generation:**
    *   A central processing unit (CPU) receives motion vector data and noise variance data from each camera.
    *   CPU generates a Frequency Allocation Map (FAM).  The FAM is an N x M matrix, where N is the number of cameras, and M represents frequency bands.  Each cell (i, j) in the FAM contains a weight between 0.0 and 1.0, representing the proportion of frequency band 'j' processed by camera 'i'.
    *   Weight Calculation: FAM(i, j) = α \* (MotionScore(i) / MaxMotionScore) + β \* (1 - (NoiseLevel(i) / MaxNoiseLevel))
        *   `MotionScore(i)` = Average magnitude of motion vectors in camera 'i'.
        *   `NoiseLevel(i)` = Estimated noise variance in camera 'i'.
        *   `MaxMotionScore` and `MaxNoiseLevel` are system-wide maximum values for normalization.
        *   α and β are tunable weights (α + β = 1).
5.  **Frequency Decomposition:** Each camera decomposes its frame into frequency bands using a 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT).
6.  **Frequency Band Distribution:** Based on the FAM:
    *   Each camera transmits only a portion of its frequency bands to a central processing unit (CPU).
    *   The CPU reconstructs the full frequency spectrum using the received data.
7.  **Temporal Consistency Enhancement:**
    *   Implement a temporal filter (e.g., Kalman filter) on the reconstructed frequency spectrum to reduce flickering and maintain temporal coherence.
8.  **Reconstruction and Display:**
    *   Perform an Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT) on the temporally-filtered spectrum to produce the final denoised and enhanced video frame.

**Pseudocode (CPU Side):**

```
// Initialization
N = Number of Cameras
M = Number of Frequency Bands
FAM = NxM Matrix (initialized)
FrequencyData = NxM Matrix (to store received frequency data)

// For each frame:

// Receive frequency band data from each camera
For i = 1 to N:
    Receive FrequencyData[i] from Camera i

// Combine FrequencyData based on FAM
CombinedSpectrum = 0
For i = 1 to N:
    For j = 1 to M:
        CombinedSpectrum[j] += FAM[i,j] * FrequencyData[i,j]

// Apply Temporal Filter to CombinedSpectrum

// Perform IDCT on filtered CombinedSpectrum to reconstruct frame

// Output reconstructed frame
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Adaptive FAM adjustment based on scene content (e.g., prioritizing high-frequency detail in textured areas).
*   Integration with object tracking algorithms to prioritize frequency allocation to regions containing moving objects.
*   Distributed processing – Offload frequency decomposition and filtering to edge devices (cameras) to reduce CPU load.
