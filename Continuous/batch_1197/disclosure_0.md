## Adaptive Feature Weighting via Bayesian Optimization

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust attribute weights during clustering iterations not through pre-defined rules or client input, but via Bayesian Optimization to maximize a cluster quality metric *predicted* by a separate meta-model. This allows the system to learn optimal weighting schemes *automatically* for each dataset, beyond what a human might intuitively define.

**Specs:**

1.  **Meta-Model Training:**
    *   Train a meta-model (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network) to predict cluster quality (Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index) *given* attribute weights and a dataset’s statistical profile (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis for each attribute).
    *   The training data for this meta-model comes from running the base clustering algorithm (K-Means, etc.) with numerous random weight combinations on a diverse set of datasets.  Store the resulting weights and cluster quality scores as training pairs.

2.  **Bayesian Optimization Loop:**
    *   During clustering of a *new* dataset:
        *   Define a search space for attribute weights: each attribute has a weight between 0 and 1, summing to 1 (normalized weights).
        *   Employ a Bayesian Optimization algorithm (e.g., Gaussian Process Optimization, Tree-structured Parzen Estimator) to iteratively suggest attribute weight combinations to evaluate.
        *   For each suggested weight combination:
            *   Run one iteration of the base clustering algorithm.
            *   Calculate the cluster quality metric.
            *   Use the meta-model to *predict* the cluster quality *before* running the clustering iteration, speeding up optimization.
            *   Update the Bayesian Optimization algorithm with the results (weights & actual quality).

3.  **Clustering Iteration Modification:**
    *   The base clustering algorithm is modified to accept attribute weights as input.
    *   The distance calculation is adjusted to multiply each attribute’s value by its corresponding weight before calculating the distance.

4.  **Dataset Profiling:**
    *   A statistical profile (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis) is computed for each attribute of the input dataset.
    *   This profile is fed as an input feature to the meta-model.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Meta-Model Training (performed offline)
train_meta_model(training_data):
  // training_data = [(weights, dataset_profile, cluster_quality)]
  model = train_machine_learning_model(training_data) // e.g., Random Forest
  return model

// Clustering with Adaptive Weights
cluster_data(dataset, meta_model):
  dataset_profile = compute_dataset_profile(dataset)
  optimization_bounds = define_weight_bounds()
  optimizer = initialize_bayesian_optimizer(optimization_bounds)

  for iteration in range(max_iterations):
    suggested_weights = optimizer.suggest_next_weights(dataset_profile)
    cluster_quality = run_clustering_iteration(dataset, suggested_weights)
    optimizer.update(suggested_weights, cluster_quality)

  best_weights = optimizer.get_best_weights()
  final_clusters = run_clustering_iteration(dataset, best_weights)
  return final_clusters

// Run Clustering Iteration
run_clustering_iteration(dataset, weights):
  // Calculate weighted distances within clustering algorithm
  // Example: distance = sum(weight[i] * (value1[i] - value2[i])^2)
  clusters = run_base_clustering_algorithm(dataset, weights)
  quality = calculate_cluster_quality(clusters)
  return clusters
