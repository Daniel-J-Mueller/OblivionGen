## Dynamic Environmental Sonification Based on Predictive Occupancy

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing sensor suite (as described implicitly in the parent patent – location data acquisition), directional audio emitters (minimum 4, strategically placed within the monitored environment), processing unit capable of real-time probabilistic calculations and audio synthesis.
*   **Software:**  Core occupancy prediction module (leveraging existing clustering algorithms from the parent patent), sonification engine, environmental mapping module, calibration/training module.

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the predictive occupancy functionality by translating probabilistic location data into a dynamic, spatially-aware soundscape.  Rather than *just* predicting *where* a user is likely to be, it creates an auditory representation of that probability, enriching the user experience and providing subtle environmental cues.

**Core Functionality:**

1.  **Probability Mapping:** The core occupancy prediction module (from the patent) generates a probability distribution across the monitored environment, indicating the likelihood of the user being present in any given location.
2.  **Sonification Engine:** This module maps probability values to specific sonic parameters.  
    *   **Volume:** Higher probability = louder sound.
    *   **Frequency/Timbre:**  Different frequency ranges or instrument timbres can be associated with different areas or semantic tags (e.g., kitchen = gentle chimes, office = muted synth pad).
    *   **Spatialization:** The sound is emitted from directional audio emitters, with the intensity and direction of the sound corresponding to the probability distribution.  Areas with high probability have louder sounds emanating from their location.
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously updates the soundscape based on real-time location updates and predictive modeling. As the user moves or the prediction changes, the soundscape shifts accordingly.
4.  **Semantic Tagging Enhancement:** Integrate semantic tagging of areas (e.g., “kitchen”, “living room”, “office”).  Not only does the sound *location* reflect probability, but the *type* of sound emitted is informed by the semantic tag. 
5.  **User Customization:** Allow users to customize the sonic parameters (instrument choices, volume levels, semantic tag assignments) to create a personalized soundscape.
6.  **Alerting Integration:**  Use subtle changes in the soundscape to indicate events – a slight increase in volume or a shift in timbre could signal an incoming notification or a change in the user’s predicted behavior.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
// Input: Probability Map (2D array of probabilities),  Semantic Map (2D array of area tags),  AudioEmitter Array
// Output:  Real-time soundscape

For each location in Probability Map:
    probability = Probability Map[location]
    areaTag = Semantic Map[location]

    //Determine sound characteristics based on probability and areaTag
    volume = scale(probability, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, MAX_VOLUME)
    soundType = lookup(areaTag, SoundTypeMap) //SoundTypeMap associates tags with sounds

    //Spatialization:
    emitter = findNearestEmitter(location)
    emitter.play(soundType, volume)

End For
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Homes:** Create an immersive and informative soundscape that reflects the user’s presence and activity.
*   **Retail Environments:**  Guide customers towards specific products or areas of interest using subtle auditory cues.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide auditory feedback for visually impaired individuals, enhancing their awareness of their surroundings.
*   **Security Systems:**  Alert users to the presence of intruders using directional audio cues.
