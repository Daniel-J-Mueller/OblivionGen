## Dynamic DNS Payload Sharding & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the DNS-based messaging to support *sharding* of request payloads across multiple DNS queries, and subsequent *reconstruction* at the CDN edge. This allows for transmission of larger request metadata (beyond what fits comfortably in a single DNS query) without exceeding DNS message size limits or introducing significant latency.

**Specification:**

1.  **Payload Division:** Client-side library (or integrated into application logic) divides request metadata into fixed-size shards. Each shard contains:
    *   Shard Number (integer)
    *   Total Shard Count (integer)
    *   Shard Data (byte array – limited to maximize DNS message size utilization)
    *   Checksum/Hash of Shard Data (for data integrity)

2.  **DNS Query Generation:** The client initiates a series of DNS queries – one for each shard. The shard data is encoded as DNS TXT records or custom DNS record types (if supported/defined). The domain queried remains consistent for all shards within a single request.

3.  **CDN Edge Processing:**
    *   DNS Server Interception: CDN’s DNS servers intercept the series of DNS queries.
    *   Shard Collection: The CDN Edge Node maintains a temporary session (keyed by client IP/identifier & a request ID) to collect shards as they arrive.
    *   Shard Ordering & Validation: Shards are ordered based on `Shard Number`, and checksums are validated.  Missing shards trigger a timeout & error.
    *   Payload Reconstruction: Once all shards are received, the payload is reconstructed into a single, complete metadata object.

4.  **Request Routing & Processing:** The reconstructed metadata is then used to inform request routing, resource selection, and any necessary pre-processing.

**Pseudocode (CDN Edge Node):**

```
function handleDNSQuery(dnsQuery) {
  requestID = extractRequestIDFromQuery(dnsQuery); //Assumes request ID encoded in query
  if (!requestExists(requestID)) {
    createRequestSession(requestID);
  }

  shardNumber = extractShardNumber(dnsQuery);
  totalShards = extractTotalShards(dnsQuery);
  shardData = extractShardData(dnsQuery);
  shardChecksum = extractShardChecksum(dnsQuery);

  if (validateChecksum(shardData, shardChecksum)) {
    storeShard(requestID, shardNumber, shardData);

    if (allShardsReceived(requestID, totalShards)) {
      reconstructedPayload = reconstructPayload(requestID);
      processRequest(reconstructedPayload);
      cleanupRequestSession(requestID);
    }
  } else {
    // Log checksum error, potentially retry
  }
}

function reconstructPayload(requestID) {
  // Retrieve all shards for requestID, ordered by shardNumber
  // Combine shardData arrays into a single array
  return combinedPayload;
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Shard Size:** Dynamically adjust shard size based on network conditions and DNS message size limits.
*   **Prioritized Shards:**  Mark certain shards as critical (e.g., authentication tokens) to ensure they are received and processed first.
*   **Compression:** Compress shard data to further reduce message size and improve transmission efficiency.
*   **Encryption:** Encrypt shard data to protect sensitive information during transmission.
