## Dynamic Query ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the existing dynamic query assignment system with a ‘shadowing’ mechanism. Instead of simply predicting execution time *before* assignment, continuously monitor the performance of queries on *both* the primary and secondary engines during execution. Use this real-time data to dynamically shift portions of a query’s workload (e.g., specific joins, aggregations) between engines *during* its lifetime, maximizing overall throughput.

**Specs:**

**1. Query Decomposition Module:**

*   **Input:** Original SQL query.
*   **Output:** Decomposed query plan – a tree structure representing the query broken down into executable units (e.g., table scans, joins, filters, aggregations).  Units will be tagged with estimated resource usage (CPU, memory, I/O).
*   **Functionality:**  Utilizes a query optimizer to generate multiple possible execution plans.  The plans are evaluated based on cost (estimated resource usage) and potential for parallelization.  The chosen plan forms the basis for dynamic workload shifting.

**2. Real-Time Performance Monitor (RPM):**

*   **Input:** Execution metrics from both primary and secondary query engines (CPU utilization, memory usage, I/O rates, execution time of individual query units).
*   **Output:**  Performance profiles for each engine, and a ‘shift score’ indicating the potential benefit of moving a specific query unit to the other engine.
*   **Functionality:** Tracks the execution progress of each query unit on the assigned engine.  Calculates a ‘shift score’ based on the difference in resource utilization and execution time between the two engines.  This is a constantly updating score.

**3. Dynamic Workload Shifter (DWS):**

*   **Input:** Decomposed query plan, RPM data (shift scores), current system load.
*   **Output:** Instructions to dynamically shift query units between the primary and secondary engines.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Continuously monitors shift scores.
    *   If a shift score exceeds a predefined threshold, initiates a transfer of the corresponding query unit.
    *   The transfer involves:
        *   Pausing execution of the unit on the current engine.
        *   Re-writing the query plan to execute the unit on the target engine.
        *   Resuming execution on the target engine.
    *   Prioritizes shifting units that are bottlenecking the overall query execution.
    *   Implements a ‘cooling off’ period to prevent excessive shifting (e.g., a unit cannot be shifted again for 5 seconds).

**4. Predictive Resource Allocation Engine (PRAE):**

*   **Input:**  Historical performance data (RPM data, query logs), current system load, incoming query stream.
*   **Output:** Dynamic resource allocation plan – adjusts the amount of resources allocated to the primary and secondary engines based on predicted workload.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to predict future workload based on historical patterns and incoming query stream.
    *   Adjusts resource allocation by scaling up/down the number of worker threads, memory allocation, and I/O bandwidth on each engine.
    *   Proactively allocates resources to the engine expected to handle the majority of the workload, minimizing contention and maximizing throughput.

**Pseudocode (DWS):**

```
while (query is executing):
    unit_performance = get_performance_data(unit)
    shift_score = calculate_shift_score(unit_performance, engine_loads)
    if (shift_score > threshold AND cooling_off_period_expired):
        pause_execution(unit, current_engine)
        rewrite_query_plan(unit, target_engine)
        resume_execution(unit, target_engine)
        set_cooling_off_period(unit)
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   Network latency between engines is a critical factor and needs to be carefully considered during shifting.
*   Error handling and rollback mechanisms are essential to ensure data consistency during shifting.
*   The shifting threshold and cooling-off period need to be dynamically adjusted based on system load and network conditions.
*   This system could be extended to support multiple secondary engines, allowing for even greater scalability and flexibility.
