## Adaptive Haptic Field Generation

**Concept:** Expand on the ‘enlarging the region’ concept by dynamically generating localized haptic feedback alongside visual enlargement of navigational elements. Instead of *just* visually highlighting, provide tactile confirmation to the user's finger, enhancing precision and reducing accidental selections. This moves beyond simple visual assistance and into multi-sensory interaction.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a display capable of localized tactile stimulation. This could be achieved through:
    *   Micro-actuators embedded beneath the display surface.
    *   Ultrasonic transducers generating localized pressure waves.
    *   Electrostatic attraction/repulsion modulating surface friction.
*   **Software Modules:**
    1.  *Touch Tracking:* Continuously monitors touch input trajectory, velocity, and deceleration, as in the base patent.
    2.  *Proximity Calculation:* Determines distance to navigational elements and their associated ‘fields’.
    3.  *Haptic Field Generation:* 
        *   Defines a haptic ‘field’ around each navigational element.  The field's intensity and size are inversely proportional to distance from the element.
        *   As the touch input decelerates within the threshold distance, the haptic field is activated.  The field *increases* in intensity and size, mirroring the visual enlargement.
        *   Uses a gradient to ‘pull’ the user’s finger towards the target, providing a subtle directional cue.
    4.  *Field Decay:* Once the touch input is no longer decelerating towards the target or moves beyond the threshold, the haptic field smoothly decays.
    5.  *User Customization:* Allows users to adjust:
        *   Haptic intensity (low, medium, high).
        *   Field size.
        *   Decay rate.
        *   Whether haptic feedback is enabled for specific navigational element types (e.g., only hyperlinks).

*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Field Generation Module):**

```
function generateHapticField(touchX, touchY, deceleration, elementDataList):
  for each element in elementDataList:
    distance = calculateDistance(touchX, touchY, element.x, element.y)
    if distance <= thresholdDistance and deceleration > decelerationThreshold:
      hapticIntensity = 1.0 - (distance / thresholdDistance) # Scale intensity based on distance
      hapticSize = element.size + (1.0 - (distance / thresholdDistance)) * maxFieldIncrease #Scale size
      activateHapticActuator(element.x, element.y, hapticIntensity, hapticSize)
    else:
      deactivateHapticActuator(element.x, element.y)
```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `elementData`: { x: float, y: float, size: float } –  Represents the position and size of a navigational element.
    *   `hapticActuator`: Represents an individual haptic stimulation point on the display.  Attributes: x, y, intensity, size.

*   **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Adaptive haptic textures.  Different navigational element types could trigger different tactile sensations (e.g., a slightly bumpy texture for buttons, a smooth surface for hyperlinks).
    *   Haptic ‘snap-to’ functionality.  As the touch input nears a navigational element, a subtle haptic force could ‘snap’ the finger into precise alignment.
    *   Integration with accessibility features.  Haptic feedback could provide crucial guidance for visually impaired users.
