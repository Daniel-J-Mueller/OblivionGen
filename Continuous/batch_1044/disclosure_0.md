## Adaptive Synchronization Granularity

**Concept:** Current synchronization focuses on folders, subfolders, files. This design proposes *dynamic* synchronization granularityâ€”breaking down shared structures into arbitrarily sized "sync-chunks" determined by content change frequency and user-defined priorities.

**Specs:**

*   **Chunk Definition:**  A "sync-chunk" is a contiguous block of data, not necessarily tied to the file system hierarchy. It can span multiple files or be a portion of a single large file.
*   **Change Frequency Analysis:** The system monitors read/write access patterns to shared data.  Chunks with high change frequency are designated "hot" chunks.  Chunks with minimal change are "cold."
*   **User Priority:**  Users can assign priorities to specific data types or folders (e.g., "critical documents," "low-priority media"). This overrides change frequency analysis.
*   **Dynamic Chunk Creation/Merging:**  The system dynamically creates and merges chunks based on change patterns and user priorities. Hot chunks are kept small for rapid synchronization. Cold chunks can be merged to reduce overhead.
*   **Hash Table Extension:** The existing hash table structure is extended to store hashes for *each* sync-chunk, not just folders/files. This allows for precise change detection.
*   **Synchronization Protocol:** The synchronization protocol is modified to transfer only changed sync-chunks. This significantly reduces bandwidth usage and synchronization time.

**Pseudocode (Core Synchronization Loop):**

```
function synchronize() {
  // 1. Determine changed chunks:
  changedChunks = []
  for each chunk in allChunks {
    if (remoteChunkHash != localChunkHash) {
      changedChunks.add(chunk)
    }
  }

  // 2. Prioritize chunks based on user-defined rules and change frequency.

  prioritizedChunks = sort(changedChunks, priorityFunction)

  // 3. Transfer prioritized chunks:

  for each chunk in prioritizedChunks {
    if (remoteVersion < localVersion) {
      uploadChunk(chunk)
    } else {
      downloadChunk(chunk)
    }
  }
}

function priorityFunction(chunk) {
  // Rule 1: User-defined priority (highest)
  if (chunk.userPriority > 0) {
    return chunk.userPriority;
  }

  // Rule 2: Change frequency (higher is more important)
  return chunk.changeFrequency;

  // Rule 3: Default (low)
  return 0;
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Requires a mechanism to track chunk boundaries and ownership.
*   A sophisticated algorithm is needed to determine optimal chunk size and merging strategy.
*   Consider using a delta encoding scheme to further reduce bandwidth usage for modified chunks.
*   Error handling must account for potential inconsistencies between chunk boundaries on the local and remote systems.
