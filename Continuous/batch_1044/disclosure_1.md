## Automated Network Micro-Segmentation via Dynamic Trust Scoring

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Trust Scoring Engine (TSE) – Software module operating within the provider network’s control plane.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Connectivity Enablement Devices (CEDs) – Report real-time network behavior (packet rates, destinations, protocols) and hardware token status.
    *   Token Managers – Provide token issuance logs, requester authentication data, and associated artifact metadata.
    *   Threat Intelligence Feeds – Integrate external threat data (IP reputation, malware signatures).
    *   Internal Security Event Logs – Correlate network activity with internal security events (intrusion detection alerts, vulnerability scans).
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Scalable server infrastructure capable of handling high-volume data ingestion and processing. GPU acceleration recommended for machine learning models.
*   **Software Requirements:**
    *   Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS)
    *   Programming Languages: Python, Go
    *   Database: NoSQL database (MongoDB, Cassandra) for storing real-time network data and trust scores.
    *   Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch.

**Innovation Description:**

The system continuously assigns a “Trust Score” to each network endpoint (server, device) based on observed behavior, token validity, and threat intelligence. This score dynamically influences network segmentation policies, creating micro-segments with granular access control.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Initialization
trust_scores = {}  # Dictionary to store trust scores for each endpoint
segmentation_policies = {} # Dictionary to store micro-segment configurations

# Function to update trust score
def update_trust_score(endpoint_ip, behavior_data, token_status, threat_data):
    # Calculate a weighted score based on behavior, token, and threat
    behavior_score = analyze_behavior(behavior_data)
    token_score = validate_token(token_status)
    threat_score = assess_threat(threat_data)

    trust_score = (0.5 * behavior_score) + (0.3 * token_score) + (0.2 * threat_score)
    trust_scores[endpoint_ip] = trust_score
    return trust_score

# Function to apply segmentation policies
def apply_segmentation(endpoint_ip):
    trust_score = trust_scores.get(endpoint_ip, 0)

    if trust_score > 0.8:
        # High trust - Allow full network access
        segmentation_policies[endpoint_ip] = "full_access"
    elif trust_score > 0.5:
        # Medium trust - Allow access to specific services/ports
        segmentation_policies[endpoint_ip] = "restricted_access"
    else:
        # Low trust - Isolate endpoint
        segmentation_policies[endpoint_ip] = "isolated"

# Main loop
while True:
    # Collect data from CEDs, Token Managers, and Threat Feeds
    behavior_data, token_status, threat_data = collect_data()

    # Update trust scores for each endpoint
    for endpoint_ip in endpoints:
        trust_score = update_trust_score(endpoint_ip, behavior_data[endpoint_ip], token_status[endpoint_ip], threat_data[endpoint_ip])

    # Apply segmentation policies based on trust scores
    for endpoint_ip in endpoints:
        apply_segmentation(endpoint_ip)

    # Enforce segmentation policies using network firewalls and SDN controllers
    enforce_policies(segmentation_policies)

    # Sleep for a defined interval
    sleep(60)
```

**Novelty:**

This approach goes beyond static network segmentation. It dynamically adapts to changing threat landscapes and endpoint behavior. The integration of token validation with real-time network monitoring provides a more robust security posture. The “Trust Score” metric offers a quantifiable measure of endpoint trustworthiness, enabling granular access control and automated security responses. The system learns and adapts based on observed data, improving its accuracy over time. The automated enforcement capabilities minimize the need for manual intervention.
