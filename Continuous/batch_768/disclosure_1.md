## Adaptive Fragmenting Based on Perceptual Complexity

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Dynamically adjust fragment duration *not* solely based on shot boundaries and predefined ranges, but also on the *perceptual complexity* of the video content within a potential fragment. Higher complexity = shorter fragments; lower complexity = longer fragments. This allows for finer-grained control over encoding efficiency and perceived quality, especially for content with rapid visual changes or intricate details.

**II. Perceptual Complexity Metric:**

*   **Spatial Frequency Analysis:**  Utilize a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on individual frames to determine the distribution of spatial frequencies. Higher concentration of high frequencies indicates greater detail and potential for encoding artifacts.
*   **Motion Vector Variance:**  Analyze motion vectors generated during video compression.  High variance in motion vector magnitude and direction indicates rapid or complex motion.
*   **Color Palette Diversity:**  Calculate the number of unique colors present in a frame or segment.  A larger, more diverse color palette signifies greater visual complexity.
*   **Combined Complexity Score:**  Weight and combine the above metrics into a single 'Perceptual Complexity Score' (PCS).  Weighting factors are adjustable parameters.

**III. Adaptive Fragmentation Algorithm:**

1.  **Initial Fragment Proposal:**  Generate initial fragment proposals based on shot boundaries and the pre-defined fragment duration range (as in the provided patent).
2.  **PCS Calculation:** For *each proposed fragment*, calculate the average PCS across all frames within that fragment.
3.  **Dynamic Duration Adjustment:**
    *   **Thresholding:** Define a set of PCS thresholds (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
    *   **Duration Scaling:**  Based on the PCS threshold the fragment's duration is scaled:
        *   **Low PCS:** Extend fragment duration up to a maximum scaling factor.
        *   **Medium PCS:** Maintain proposed duration.
        *   **High PCS:** Shorten fragment duration down to a minimum scaling factor.
4.  **Constraint Enforcement:** Ensure the adjusted fragment durations remain within the overall fragment duration range.  If adjustment exceeds limits, prioritize maintaining shot boundary alignment.
5.  **Keyframe Insertion:**  Insert keyframes at the beginning of each adjusted fragment, ensuring independent decodability.
6.  **Encoding Settings:** Determine encoding settings (bitrate, quantization parameters) based on the keyframe and the fragment's PCS. Higher PCS fragments receive higher bitrates/lower quantization to preserve detail.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
function AdaptiveFragment(video, minDuration, maxDuration, pcsThresholds, durationScalingFactors) {
  shotBoundaries = DetectShotBoundaries(video);
  proposedFragments = GenerateFragmentsFromBoundaries(video, shotBoundaries, minDuration, maxDuration);

  for each fragment in proposedFragments {
    pcs = CalculatePerceptualComplexityScore(fragment);
    
    if pcs < pcsThresholds[0] {
      fragment.duration = ScaleDuration(fragment.duration, durationScalingFactors[0]);
    } else if pcs < pcsThresholds[1] {
      fragment.duration = ScaleDuration(fragment.duration, durationScalingFactors[1]);
    } else {
      fragment.duration = ScaleDuration(fragment.duration, durationScalingFactors[2]);
    }
    
    fragment.duration = ConstrainDuration(fragment.duration, minDuration, maxDuration);
  }
  
  InsertKeyframes(fragments);
  DetermineEncodingSettingsBasedOnKeyframeAndPCS(fragments);
  
  return fragments;
}
```

**V. Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Processing Power:**  PCS calculation can be computationally intensive, requiring optimized algorithms and potentially hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU).
*   **Memory Usage:**  FFT and motion vector analysis require significant memory bandwidth.
*   **Real-time Implementation:** Optimization is crucial for real-time video encoding.  Consider parallelization and caching.
*   **Software Libraries:**  Utilize existing image processing and video analysis libraries (e.g., OpenCV, FFmpeg).
