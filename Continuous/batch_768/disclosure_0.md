## Dynamic Resonance Charging & Data Transfer

**Concept:** Expand the charging mat system to incorporate resonant inductive coupling *and* utilize the boom as a tunable resonant element for both power and high-bandwidth data transfer. The existing physical contact points become secondary, ensuring connection but primarily serving as grounding and resonant frequency adjustment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Charging Mat – Modified Core & Array:**

*   **Material:** Replace the solid isolating core with a multi-layered structure. Layer 1 (top): High-frequency ferrite core for concentrating magnetic flux. Layer 2: Air gap – precisely machined and adjustable via micro-actuators. Layer 3: Second ferrite core (bottom).  This creates a tunable resonant transformer.
*   **Conductor Arrangement:** Top & Bottom conductors remain as pliable interconnected mesh but incorporate embedded micro-actuators. These will subtly adjust mesh tension, fine-tuning resonant frequency. Mesh material will be a Litz wire construction to minimize skin effect at higher frequencies.
*   **Arrayed Coils:** Instead of a single top/bottom conductor arrangement, the mat will contain an array of these resonant pairs. Each pair will be individually addressable and controllable.
*   **Power Supply Integration:** Power supply unit will be adaptive, capable of dynamically adjusting frequency and power based on boom feedback. Incorporate a dedicated digital signal processor (DSP) for real-time control.

**2. Boom – Tunable Resonant Antenna:**

*   **Core Material:** The boom's internal core will be a dielectric material with embedded adjustable ferrite elements. These elements are controlled by the UAV's flight controller.
*   **Conductor Design:**
    *   *Primary Conductor:*  The outer conductor (engaging the top mesh) will be a wide, flat Litz wire strip.
    *   *Secondary Conductor:* The inner conductor (engaging the bottom conductor) will be a helical coil wound around the dielectric core. The coil's pitch and length will be adjustable via micro-actuators.
*   **Data Transmission:** Integrate a high-speed communication module (e.g., UWB) *within* the boom's core. This will provide a redundant data link, and will be the *primary* method of communication at higher power transfer levels.

**3. Communication Protocol & Control System:**

*   **Initial Handshake:** When the UAV approaches the mat, it initiates communication via a low-power RF link.
*   **Resonant Frequency Sweep:** The mat performs a frequency sweep to identify the boom's resonant peak. The UAV’s flight controller adjusts the boom's internal ferrite elements to maximize coupling.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors coupling efficiency and adjusts both mat and boom parameters to maintain optimal power transfer.  This will also dynamically adjust data transfer rates.
*   **Power Level Control:** The UAV requests a specific power level. The mat adjusts the power output accordingly.
*   **Data Transfer:**  High-speed data transfer occurs simultaneously via the internal UWB module.  Data can include telemetry, software updates, and sensor data.

**Pseudocode (UAV Side – Frequency Adjustment):**

```
function adjustBoomFrequency(targetFrequency) {
  // Read current ferrite element positions
  currentPositions = readFerritePositions();

  // Calculate adjustment steps
  adjustmentSteps = calculateAdjustmentSteps(currentPositions, targetFrequency);

  // Move ferrite elements
  moveFerriteElements(adjustmentSteps);

  // Wait for stabilization
  delay(100ms);

  // Measure resonant frequency
  measuredFrequency = measureResonantFrequency();

  // If deviation is too high, repeat adjustment
  if (abs(measuredFrequency - targetFrequency) > threshold) {
    adjustBoomFrequency(targetFrequency);
  }
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Safety Mechanisms:** Implement over-current, over-voltage, and temperature protection circuits.
*   **Foreign Object Detection (FOD):** Incorporate sensors to detect foreign objects on the mat and shut down the system.
*   **Multi-UAV Support:**  The arrayed coil system allows for simultaneous charging of multiple UAVs, each tuned to a different frequency.
*   **Thermal Management:** Integrate heat sinks and/or fans to dissipate heat generated by the coils.
