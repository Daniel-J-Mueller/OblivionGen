## Adaptive Camouflage Exterior - Specification v0.1

**Concept:** A vehicle exterior capable of dynamically altering its visual appearance to blend with the surrounding environment, or display customizable patterns/textures. This isn't simply paint-changing; it's a morphing surface.

**Core Technology:** Micro-actuated, electro-rheological fluid (ERF) panels layered beneath a transparent, durable polymer shell.

**Panel Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions:** Each panel 10cm x 10cm x 0.5cm.  Grid arrangement across the entire vehicle exterior.  Panel density adjustable by vehicle model.
*   **ERF Composition:**  Iron particles suspended in a carrier fluid. Precise composition tuned for rapid response time (target < 0.1 sec for full color/texture change) and minimal energy consumption.
*   **Actuation:** Each panel contains a micro-electromagnetic actuator array. Individual actuators control fluid flow *within* the panel.
*   **Transparency Layer:** Durable, self-healing polymer coating with high light transmission.  Must withstand temperature fluctuations, UV exposure, and minor impacts.
*   **Power:**  Integrated, thin-film solar cells embedded *within* the transparent layer, supplementing vehicle battery. Dedicated power management IC for each panel.

**Operational Logic:**

1.  **Environmental Scanning:** Vehicle-mounted cameras and sensors (LiDAR, radar) capture real-time environmental data (color, texture, lighting conditions).
2.  **Data Processing:** Onboard computer analyzes data and generates a ‘camouflage map’.
3.  **Panel Control:** Computer sends signals to individual panel actuators, instructing them to manipulate the ERF fluid.  
    *   ERF fluid concentrates/disperses to alter light reflection/absorption, creating desired colors and patterns.
    *   Micro-actuators create slight surface deformations, mimicking textures (e.g., wood grain, stone, foliage).
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** System continuously monitors environment and adjusts panel configuration in real-time.
5.  **User Customization:** Driver can override camouflage mode and select pre-programmed patterns, display images, or create custom designs.

**Pseudocode (Panel Control):**

```
FUNCTION UpdatePanel(panelID, colorR, colorG, colorB, textureID):
  // colorR, colorG, colorB: RGB values (0-255)
  // textureID:  Index of pre-defined texture or custom pattern data
  
  // Calculate actuator signals based on desired color
  redSignal = MapColorToSignal(colorR)
  greenSignal = MapColorToSignal(colorG)
  blueSignal = MapColorToSignal(colorB)
  
  // Load texture data (if custom)
  IF textureID == "CUSTOM":
    textureData = LoadCustomTexture()
  ELSE
    textureData = LoadPredefinedTexture(textureID)
  
  // Calculate actuator signals based on texture data
  textureSignals = GenerateTextureActuatorSignals(textureData)
  
  // Combine color and texture signals
  finalSignals = CombineSignals(redSignal, greenSignal, blueSignal, textureSignals)
  
  // Send signals to panel actuators
  SendActuatorSignals(panelID, finalSignals)
END FUNCTION
```

**Materials Research Focus:**
