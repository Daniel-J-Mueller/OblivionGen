## Dynamic Policy Shaping via Behavioral Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the access control system to *predict* future resource needs based on user behavior and proactively shape policies *before* requests are made, minimizing denials and optimizing resource allocation.  Instead of reacting to failed requests, the system anticipates them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Creation:**

*   **Data Sources:** System logs (access attempts, resource usage), application usage data, user roles, time of day, geolocation (optional, user consent required).
*   **Modeling:** Employ time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM neural networks) to predict resource requests.  Separate models for different resource types (compute, storage, network) and user groups.
*   **Profile Attributes:**  Predicted resource usage (CPU cores, memory, storage GB, network bandwidth), frequency of access, time of day access patterns, application usage trends.
*   **Profile Update Frequency:** Continuous learning â€“ models are retrained incrementally with each new data point.  Periodic full retraining (e.g., weekly) to account for longer-term shifts in behavior.

**2. Proactive Policy Generation:**

*   **Prediction Horizon:** Configure a prediction horizon (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour) to anticipate future needs.
*   **Policy Shaping Engine:**
    *   Receive predicted resource requests from the Behavioral Profile.
    *   Analyze existing policies (first set of policies in the provided patent) to determine if sufficient permissions are available.
    *   If permissions are insufficient:
        *   Generate a candidate access control policy (second set of policies) that grants necessary permissions.
        *   Assess the risk associated with the candidate policy (e.g., potential for privilege escalation, data exfiltration) using a rule-based risk engine.
        *   If the risk is acceptable:
            *   *Dynamically* apply the candidate policy, either temporarily (time-bound) or until revoked.
            *   Log the policy change and the rationale behind it.
*   **Policy Prioritization:**  Rank candidate policies based on predicted impact on resource utilization, user experience, and security risk.  Apply higher-priority policies first.

**3.  Real-time Feedback Loop:**

*   **Monitoring:** Track actual resource usage against predicted usage.
*   **Model Adjustment:** If discrepancies are detected, adjust the forecasting models to improve accuracy.
*   **Policy Adjustment:**  Dynamically revoke or modify policies if actual resource usage patterns deviate significantly from predictions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (Runs Continuously)
FOR each User
    Get User Behavior Profile
    Predict Future Resource Needs (CPU, Memory, Storage, Network)
    FOR each Predicted Resource Need
        IF Existing Policy Does Not Grant Access
            Generate Candidate Access Control Policy
            Assess Risk of Policy
            IF Risk Acceptable
                Apply Policy (Time-Bound or Until Revoked)
                Log Policy Change
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    Monitor Actual Resource Usage
    Adjust Forecasting Models Based on Discrepancies
ENDFOR
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **UserBehaviorProfile:** {userID, timestamp, resourceUsage, applicationUsage, accessPatterns}
*   **CandidatePolicy:** {resourceType, permissions, expirationTime, riskScore}
*   **RiskScore:** (numerical value representing the potential risk associated with the policy)

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sufficient compute resources to run forecasting models in real-time.
*   Low-latency network connectivity to access system logs and apply policies.
*   Scalable storage to store user behavior profiles and policy data.
