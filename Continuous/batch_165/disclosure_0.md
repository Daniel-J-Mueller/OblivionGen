## Adaptive Computational Photography via Multi-Spectral Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Extend the handheld device's imaging capabilities by integrating a wider range of sensors beyond visible and infrared, and dynamically allocating processing resources between dedicated processor components based on the active sensor suite and desired image characteristics.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Visible Light Camera (standard RGB)
    *   Infrared (IR) Camera (as in patent)
    *   Ultraviolet (UV) Camera
    *   Polarization Camera
    *   Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensor (for depth mapping)
    *   Hyperspectral Sensor (narrowband light capture across multiple wavelengths)
*   **Processor Allocation:**
    *   Dedicated Processor Component 1 (DP1): Primarily handles visible light processing, including standard image signal processing (ISP), noise reduction, and color correction.  Also manages data from ToF sensor for depth map creation.
    *   Dedicated Processor Component 2 (DP2):  Handles non-visible spectrum data (IR, UV, Hyperspectral, Polarization).  Includes algorithms for spectral analysis, feature extraction in non-visible wavelengths, and data fusion.
    *   Dynamic Resource Allocation: A central control unit dynamically allocates processing cores and memory between DP1 and DP2 based on active sensors and desired output.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   Sensor Activation Control: User or application-defined selection of active sensors.  Automatic selection based on scene analysis (e.g., low light = activate IR).
    *   Data Fusion Engine: Combines data from multiple sensors to create enhanced images or data sets. Algorithms include:
        *   Spectral Reconstruction: Using hyperspectral data to reconstruct color information beyond the visible spectrum.
        *   Multi-Spectral Feature Extraction: Identifying objects or materials based on their spectral signatures.
        *   UV-Enhanced Imaging:  Revealing details obscured by visible light (e.g., counterfeit detection, skin analysis).
        *   Polarization Filtering: Reducing glare and enhancing contrast.
    *   Adaptive ISP:  Adjusts ISP parameters based on spectral data and sensor combination. (e.g. enhance colors based on hyperspectral data)
*   **Hardware Extensions:**
    *   Optical Filter Wheel:  Switchable filters for specific wavelengths to improve sensor performance.
    *   Adjustable Aperture: Controls the amount of light reaching each sensor.
    *   High-Speed Data Bus:  Connects all sensors to the processor components.
    *   Integrated Calibration System: Ensures accurate data acquisition from all sensors.

**Pseudocode (Data Fusion Engine):**

```
function fuse_data(visible_image, ir_image, hyperspectral_data, uv_image):
    // Step 1: Calibrate and Align Images
    aligned_ir = calibrate_and_align(ir_image, visible_image)
    aligned_uv = calibrate_and_align(uv_image, visible_image)
    aligned_hyperspectral = calibrate_and_align(hyperspectral_data, visible_image)

    // Step 2: Feature Extraction (using DP2)
    ir_features = extract_features(aligned_ir, "IR")
    uv_features = extract_features(aligned_uv, "UV")
    spectral_features = extract_spectral_features(aligned_hyperspectral)

    // Step 3: Data Fusion (Weighted combination of features)
    fused_features = weight_features(visible_features, ir_features, spectral_features, uv_features)

    // Step 4: Image Enhancement and Reconstruction (using DP1 and DP2)
    enhanced_image = reconstruct_image(fused_features)

    return enhanced_image
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond simple visible/IR combinations to a fully multi-spectral imaging system with dynamic processing allocation, enabling applications like advanced material analysis, forensic investigation, medical diagnostics, and enhanced augmented reality experiences. Itâ€™s not just *seeing* more, but *interpreting* more.
