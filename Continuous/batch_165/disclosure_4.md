**Adaptive Notification "Bubbles" - Spatial Audio & Haptic Feedback Integration**

**Concept:** Extend context-aware notifications beyond visual and standard audio cues. Create a spatially aware notification system utilizing miniature, directional audio “bubbles” combined with localized haptic feedback delivered via wearable or ambient devices. These bubbles visually manifest as augmented reality projections, but their core function is to provide precise, non-intrusive notifications based on user position and environmental context.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Wearable/Ambient Device: Small, low-power directional speakers (array of micro-drivers) and haptic actuators (piezoelectric or micro-vibration motors) integrated into wearables (earbuds, wristbands, smart glasses) or ambient devices (desk lamps, wall panels).
    *   Tracking System: Accurate real-time tracking of user head/body position. Could utilize integrated IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) in wearables, or computer vision-based tracking from cameras.
    *   Processing Unit: Edge computing capability on the wearable/ambient device, or a cloud-based service for more complex processing.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Spatial Audio Engine:** Algorithms to create and steer directional audio “bubbles”. Sound sources are dynamically positioned in 3D space relative to the user’s head, creating the perception of sound originating from a specific location.
    *   **Haptic Mapping:** Assign different haptic patterns (intensity, frequency, duration) to different notification types. Haptic feedback is localized to the area of the body closest to the perceived origin of the audio bubble.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate data from various sensors (cameras, microphones, IMUs, proximity sensors) to determine user context (activity, location, environment).
    *   **Notification Prioritization:** Prioritize notifications based on urgency and relevance. High-priority notifications trigger both audio and haptic feedback, while lower-priority notifications may only trigger haptic feedback or visual cues.
    *   **Bubble Customization:** Allow users to customize the appearance, size, and behavior of notification bubbles.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Notification Received
function handleNotification(notification) {
  // Determine Notification Priority
  priority = determinePriority(notification);

  // Determine User Context
  context = getUserContext();

  // Calculate Bubble Position
  bubblePosition = calculateBubblePosition(context, notification);

  // Calculate Haptic Pattern
  hapticPattern = calculateHapticPattern(notification);

  // Output Audio Bubble
  outputAudioBubble(bubblePosition, notification.sound);

  // Output Haptic Feedback
  outputHapticFeedback(bubblePosition, hapticPattern);

  //Display visual bubble AR overlay
  displayARBubble(bubblePosition, notification.visual);
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  A notification is received by the system.
2.  The system determines the notification priority and user context.
3.  Based on the priority and context, the system calculates the optimal position for the notification bubble.
4.  The system outputs a directional audio signal and localized haptic feedback to create the perception of a notification bubble in 3D space.
5.  The user perceives the notification without being visually distracted or overwhelmed by traditional notification methods.
