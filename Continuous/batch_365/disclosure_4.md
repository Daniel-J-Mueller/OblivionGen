## Dynamic Sensory Narrative Generation

**Concept:** Expand context-aware recommendations beyond simple media selection to generate *dynamic, evolving sensory experiences* – light, scent, and localized haptics – synchronized with media content *and* environmental context.  The system doesn't just recommend *what* to play, but orchestrates *how* it’s experienced.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Environmental Sensor Array:** Integrated into the voice-activated device (or a networked hub). Includes:
    *   High-fidelity microphone (existing).
    *   Ambient light sensor (RGB + intensity).
    *   Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) sensor – identifies broad scent categories (floral, woody, citrus, etc.).  Low resolution is sufficient for initial triggering.
    *   Localized Haptic Transducers: Small, directional haptic emitters (vibration, subtle pressure) embedded in furniture/room surfaces. Minimum 8 emitters per 'zone' (e.g., sofa area, dining table).
    *   Smart Lighting System:  Full RGBW control over room lighting.
    *   Scent Diffusion System:  Modular scent cartridges containing concentrated scents, controlled via micro-pumps.  Multiple cartridges for blending.

*   **Central Processing Unit:**  Handles data fusion, content analysis, and orchestration.  Edge computing desirable for low latency.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Context Fusion Engine:**  Combines data from environmental sensors, voice command analysis (intent, emotion), user profile, time, location, and media content metadata.  Uses Bayesian networks or similar probabilistic models to infer user state and optimal sensory configuration.
*   **Sensory Narrative Generator:**
    *   **Content Analysis Module:**  Extracts "sensory keywords" from media content (e.g., "rainforest", "campfire", "ocean waves", "romantic dinner").  Uses NLP and potentially computer vision.
    *   **Sensory Mapping Database:** Maps sensory keywords to specific configurations of lighting, scent, and haptic effects.  This database is user-customizable.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**  Monitors environmental conditions in real-time and adjusts sensory output to enhance immersion and avoid sensory overload.  (e.g., if it's already raining outside, reduce rain-related haptic effects).
*   **User Profile Integration:** Stores user preferences for sensory experiences.  Allows users to rate and customize sensory mappings.
*   **API/SDK:**  Allows third-party content providers to integrate sensory mappings into their media content.

**3. Pseudocode – Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION AdjustSensoryOutput(environmentalData, mediaData, userPreferences):

  // 1. Calculate Sensory Intensity based on media data and user preferences
  sensoryIntensity = CalculateIntensity(mediaData.keywords, userPreferences.sensoryProfile)

  // 2.  Adjust intensity based on environmental data
  IF environmentalData.rainDetected == TRUE THEN
    sensoryIntensity.rainEffect -= 0.5 //Reduce rain effect if raining outside
  ENDIF

  IF environmentalData.ambientLight < threshold THEN
    sensoryIntensity.lightingEffect += 0.2 //Increase lighting if dark
  ENDIF

  // 3.  Apply Sensory Output
  SetLighting(sensoryIntensity.lightingEffect)
  ActivateScent(sensoryIntensity.scentEffect)
  TriggerHaptics(sensoryIntensity.hapticEffect)

  RETURN
```

**4. Novel Aspects:**

*   **Multi-sensory Synchronization:** Goes beyond audio/visual media to actively manipulate the user’s environment.
*   **Dynamic Environmental Adaptation:** System learns to adapt to real-world conditions for more immersive and personalized experiences.
*   **Content-Driven Sensory Mappings:** Allows content creators to explicitly define sensory experiences for their media.
*   **Proactive Sensory Design:** Anticipates user preferences and adjusts sensory output accordingly.
