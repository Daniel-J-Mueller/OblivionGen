## Adaptive Digital Media ‘Bloom’

**Concept:** Expand upon the licensing and access control described in the patent by introducing a dynamic, time-limited ‘bloom’ effect for digital media access. Instead of purely restricting *access*, modulate the *experience* based on licensing, time, and user interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Bloom Engine’ – A software module integrated into digital media players/servers.
*   **Licensing Integration:** Receives license data alongside media files (as per the patent). This license specifies not just permitted actions (read, annotate, share) but also ‘Bloom Parameters’.
*   **Bloom Parameters:** These parameters define the *quality* or *completeness* of the media experience. Examples:
    *   *Resolution/Bitrate*: Lower resolution/bitrate until a certain time/usage threshold.
    *   *Color Saturation*: Initially desaturated, gradually increasing over time or with user engagement.
    *   *Feature Access*: Certain features (e.g., interactive maps, bonus content) initially locked, unlocked through time or completion of challenges.
    *   *Narrative Layers*: A core narrative is presented. Supplemental or ‘hidden’ narrative layers are revealed based on time/interaction.
    *   *Character Detail*: Lower polygon counts/less detailed textures initially, increasing with usage.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Bloom Engine dynamically adjusts media presentation based on license parameters and user activity.
*   **Usage Tracking:** Tracks user engagement with the media (time spent, features used, sections completed).
*   **Adaptive Unlocking:**  Unlocks ‘Bloom’ levels or features based on usage. A user who actively engages with the media will experience a fuller presentation sooner.
*   **‘Withering’ Effect:**  If a license expires, or access is revoked, the ‘Bloom’ reverses.  Media quality degrades, features are disabled, and eventually, access is completely restricted.
*   **API:** A public API allows content creators to define Bloom Parameters and integrate them into their media.
*   **Client-Side Component:**  A lightweight client-side component handles the dynamic adjustments of media presentation.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Component):**

```
function LoadMedia(mediaFile, licenseData) {
  // Extract Bloom Parameters from licenseData
  bloomParams = licenseData.bloomParameters;

  // Apply initial Bloom settings
  ApplyBloomSettings(bloomParams.initialResolution, bloomParams.initialSaturation, bloomParams.lockedFeatures);

  // Start Usage Tracking
  StartTrackingUsage(mediaFile);
}

function UpdateBloom(usageData) {
  // Calculate Bloom level based on usageData and license terms
  bloomLevel = CalculateBloomLevel(usageData, licenseData);

  // Apply updated Bloom settings
  ApplyBloomSettings(bloomLevel.resolution, level.saturation, level.unlockedFeatures);
}

function ApplyBloomSettings(resolution, saturation, unlockedFeatures) {
  // Adjust media resolution/bitrate
  SetMediaResolution(resolution);

  // Adjust color saturation
  SetMediaSaturation(saturation);

  // Enable/Disable features
  EnableFeatures(unlockedFeatures);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Gamified Learning:**  Unlock additional learning resources or challenges as a student progresses.
*   **Subscription Services:** Tiered access to media quality based on subscription level.
*   **Digital Book Rentals:**  A book initially presents a ‘sketch’ of the story, gradually revealing details as the rental period progresses.
*   **Interactive Storytelling:**  Unlock new narrative branches based on user choices and engagement.
*   **Software Trials:** Limit feature access initially, unlocking more features as a user invests time in the software.
