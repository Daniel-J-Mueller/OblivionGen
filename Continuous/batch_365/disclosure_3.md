## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted User Behavior

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Resource Manager (PRM) â€“ a software module operating within the provider network.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User Access Logs: Records of application access, usage duration, features utilized.
    *   User Profile Data: Demographics, role, frequently used applications (opt-in data).
    *   Real-time System Metrics: CPU, memory, network utilization of computing resources.
    *   Application Performance Data: Response times, error rates, resource consumption per application.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Time-series forecasting (LSTM networks preferred) trained on historical data. Predicts application usage probability, resource needs (CPU, RAM, GPU) per user, and expected session duration.
*   **Resource Pool:** Dynamic pool of computing resources (VMs, containers) available to the provider network.
*   **Allocation Strategy:**  PRM proactively allocates resources *before* user request based on predicted need. Allocation granularity: application instance.  Resources are pre-loaded with application base image/container.
*   **Deallocation Strategy:** Resources deallocated automatically after session ends or if predicted need drops below threshold.  Threshold configurable per application.
*   **API:**  PRM API exposed for communication with the application streaming service. The API facilitates resource request/release, prediction feedback (actual vs. predicted usage).
*   **Monitoring & Adjustment:**  Real-time monitoring of prediction accuracy.  Periodic retraining of prediction model based on new data.
*   **Client Side Component:** Lightweight agent within the client computing device. Reports user interaction and app usage metrics to the PRM.

**Innovation Description:**

The core innovation is *proactive* resource allocation. Existing systems primarily react to user requests. This system *predicts* user behavior and pre-allocates resources accordingly. 

This approach will reduce latency, improve user experience, and optimize resource utilization. By pre-loading application images/containers onto allocated resources, the system eliminates the need for on-demand image/container pulls. The client-side component enables gathering granular usage data for improved prediction accuracy. 

**Pseudocode (PRM core logic):**

```
function predict_resource_needs(user_id, application_id):
  // Fetch historical data for user and application
  historical_data = get_historical_data(user_id, application_id)

  // Use time-series model to predict resource needs
  predicted_cpu, predicted_ram, predicted_gpu = predict(historical_data)

  return predicted_cpu, predicted_ram, predicted_gpu

function allocate_resources(user_id, application_id, predicted_cpu, predicted_ram, predicted_gpu):
  // Check if resources are available
  if resources_available(predicted_cpu, predicted_ram, predicted_gpu):
    // Allocate resources from the resource pool
    allocated_resources = allocate(predicted_cpu, predicted_ram, predicted_gpu)

    // Pre-load application image/container
    preload_application(allocated_resources, application_id)

    return allocated_resources
  else:
    // Handle resource scarcity (e.g., queuing, scaling)
    handle_resource_scarcity()
    return null

function monitor_usage(allocated_resources, user_id, application_id):
  // Track actual resource usage
  actual_cpu, actual_ram, actual_gpu = get_resource_usage(allocated_resources)

  // Compare with predicted usage
  error = calculate_error(actual_cpu, actual_ram, actual_gpu, predicted_cpu, predicted_ram, predicted_gpu)

  // Update prediction model (reinforcement learning)
  update_model(error)

function deallocate_resources(allocated_resources):
  // Release allocated resources back to the pool
  release(allocated_resources)
```
