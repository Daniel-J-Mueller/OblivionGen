## Adaptive Perimeter Control with Drone Integration

**Concept:** Expand the access control system beyond the immediate lock/unlock mechanism to create a dynamic, adaptable perimeter around the delivery location, leveraging drone technology for enhanced security and delivery confirmation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Drone Integration Module:**

*   **Drone Communication:** Establish a secure, bi-directional communication channel with a designated drone unit. Protocol: Encrypted Wi-Fi Direct/5G.
*   **Geofencing API:** API to define a customizable geofence around the delivery location. Geofence parameters: Radius (1m-100m), altitude limits, no-fly zones.
*   **Drone Command Set:**
    *   `InitiatePatrol(geofence)`:  Drone begins autonomous patrol of the defined geofence.
    *   `ScanArea(coordinates, resolution)`: Drone captures high-resolution imagery of specified coordinates.
    *   `RecordVideo(duration)`: Drone records video footage.
    *   `ReturnToDock()`: Drone returns to its charging dock.
    *   `EmergencyLanding()`: Drone initiates emergency landing.

**2. Multi-Factor Authentication Enhancement:**

*   **Drone-Based Visual Verification:**  Upon delivery agent arrival (as identified by existing system), the drone autonomously flies to the agent's location within the geofence.
*   **Facial Recognition:** Drone captures an image of the delivery agent and performs facial recognition against a pre-approved list (retrieved from server).  Threshold: 90% confidence level.
*   **Package Verification:** Drone uses onboard camera to scan package barcode/QR code and verify against expected delivery manifest.
*   **Combined Authentication Signal:** Only upon successful visual verification *and* package verification does the system send the unlock signal.

**3. Dynamic Perimeter Adjustment:**

*   **Real-Time Risk Assessment:** System continuously assesses risk based on:
    *   Time of day
    *   Weather conditions
    *   Historical activity data
    *   External threat feeds
*   **Adaptive Geofence:** Based on risk assessment, the system dynamically adjusts the geofence radius. Higher risk = larger geofence and more frequent drone patrols.
*   **Automated Anomaly Detection:** Drone footage is analyzed in real-time for anomalies (e.g., unauthorized personnel, suspicious objects). Alerts triggered to user and/or security services.

**4. System Flow (Pseudocode):**

```
//Upon delivery request:
1. Send Unique Identifier to delivery device.
2. Await identifier broadcast from camera.
3. Upon detection:
    a. Activate Drone Integration Module.
    b. Define Initial Geofence (radius = 10m).
    c. Initiate Drone Patrol (geofence).

4. Upon delivery agent arrival (signal from delivery device):
    a.  Drone flies to agent location.
    b.  Capture agent image.
    c.  Perform Facial Recognition.
    d.  Scan package barcode.

5.  IF (Facial Recognition successful AND Package Barcode matches) THEN
        Send Unlock Signal to Lock.
        Log Delivery Confirmation.
    ELSE
        Send Alert to User/Security.
        Deny Access.
    ENDIF

6.  Continuously Monitor Geofence via Drone (anomaly detection).

7.  Upon Delivery Completion:
    a. Drone returns to dock.
    b. Deactivate Drone Integration Module.
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Dedicated drone unit with high-resolution camera, barcode scanner, and secure communication module.
*   Drone charging dock with secure mounting.
*   Edge computing device at delivery location for real-time image processing and anomaly detection.
*   Secure communication infrastructure (encrypted Wi-Fi/5G).
