## Dynamic Subpartition Forecasting & Pre-Allocation

**Concept:** Expand upon the automatic subpartition creation and management by introducing predictive analysis of data ingestion rates, coupled with proactive pre-allocation of subpartition space *before* it’s needed. This moves from reactive (creating partitions when full) to a proactive system minimizing fragmentation and ensuring consistently high write performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion Rate Monitoring & Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time data ingestion rate (records/second, MB/second) for each database table with subpartitioning enabled. Historical ingestion data (hourly, daily, weekly) stored for each table.
*   **Algorithm:** Implement a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or a simple moving average with dynamic weighting) to predict future data ingestion rates. Allow selection of forecasting model per table.
*   **Output:** Predicted data ingestion rate for a defined future time window (e.g., next hour, next day).  Confidence interval for the prediction.

**2. Subpartition Space Estimation Module:**

*   **Input:** Predicted data ingestion rate (from Module 1), average record size (per table), desired subpartition lifespan (configurable per table – e.g., 1 day, 1 week, 1 month), target subpartition fill percentage (configurable – e.g., 70%).
*   **Calculation:**
    *   `Estimated Data Volume = Predicted Data Ingestion Rate * Subpartition Lifespan`
    *   `Estimated Subpartition Size = Estimated Data Volume / Target Subpartition Fill Percentage`
*   **Output:**  Recommended subpartition size.

**3. Proactive Subpartition Creation Module:**

*   **Input:** Recommended subpartition size (from Module 2), current number of subpartitions, minimum/maximum number of subpartitions (configured system-wide), configured lead time (e.g. create a subpartition 1 hour before it's predicted to be needed).
*   **Logic:**
    *   If `Current Number of Subpartitions < Maximum Number of Subpartitions` AND `Predicted Time to Full Capacity < Lead Time`:
        *   Create a new subpartition with the recommended size and assign it the next available time interval.
        *   Reserve the subpartition, preventing data from being written to older, nearly full partitions.
    *   Prioritize creating subpartitions *before* peak ingestion times, based on historical data and prediction.

**4. Dynamic Subpartition Naming Convention:**

*   Subpartition names adhere to a consistent format: `TABLE_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_N`, where:
    *   `TABLE` is the table name.
    *   `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` represents the start time of the subpartition’s time interval.
    *   `N` is a sequential number for subpartitions created within the same hour (to handle very high ingestion rates).

**5. Integration with Existing Subpartition Management:**

*   The proactive creation module works in conjunction with the existing automatic deletion/archiving mechanisms.
*   If the prediction is inaccurate and a subpartition is underutilized, the existing deletion policy will automatically handle it.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Subpartition Creation):**

```
function create_proactive_subpartition(table_name, prediction_data) {

    estimated_size = calculate_estimated_size(prediction_data)
    current_count = get_subpartition_count(table_name)
    max_count = get_max_subpartitions()

    if (current_count < max_count) {
        next_interval = calculate_next_interval(table_name)
        new_name = generate_subpartition_name(table_name, next_interval)
        create_subpartition(table_name, new_name, estimated_size)
        reserve_subpartition(table_name, new_name)
        log_event("Proactive subpartition created: " + new_name)
    }

}

// Run this function periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) for each table with subpartitioning.
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced write latency and improved performance, especially during peak ingestion periods.
*   Minimized disk fragmentation and optimized storage utilization.
*   Simplified database administration by automating subpartition creation and management.
*   Scalability to handle very high data ingestion rates.
