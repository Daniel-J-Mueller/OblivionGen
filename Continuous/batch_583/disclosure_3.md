## Dynamic Seat Re-Assignment Based on Real-Time Social Proximity

**Concept:** Leverage mobile device proximity data (Bluetooth/UWB) to dynamically re-assign seats within an event venue to maximize attendee grouping based on pre-defined or real-time social connections. This goes beyond simply allowing exchanges *before* the event; it facilitates adjustments *during* the event check-in and even *during* the event itself (within pre-defined time windows) to optimize the attendee experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Mobile Application:** User-facing app (iOS & Android) to link social media accounts, define “proximity groups” (friends, family, colleagues), and grant permission for location sharing.
*   **Venue Infrastructure:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and/or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) anchors strategically placed throughout the venue to provide precise location data.  UWB preferred for higher accuracy and reduced interference.
*   **Central Server:**  Manages user data, proximity group definitions, seat assignments, real-time location data processing, and communication with the venue’s ticketing system.
*   **Ticketing System Integration:** API integration with the existing ticketing system to retrieve seat assignments and update them dynamically.
*   **Venue Staff Interface:** Tablet/PC-based application for venue staff to monitor seat assignments, manage exceptions (accessibility needs, etc.), and manually override the system if necessary.

**2. Functional Flow:**

1.  **Pre-Event Setup:**
    *   Users link social media accounts (opt-in).
    *   Users define proximity groups within the mobile app (e.g., "Family," "Work Team," "Friends").
    *   System retrieves existing ticket assignments for the event.

2.  **Check-In/Proximity Detection:**
    *   As attendees arrive, their mobile devices connect to the venue’s BLE/UWB network.
    *   The system detects the proximity of attendees based on their device signals.
    *   It identifies attendees belonging to the same proximity groups.

3.  **Dynamic Seat Re-Assignment:**
    *   Algorithm evaluates potential seat re-assignments based on:
        *   Proximity group membership.
        *   Current seat separation.
        *   Seat availability.
        *   Section preferences (if specified).
        *   Accessibility requirements.
    *   The algorithm prioritizes grouping members of the same proximity group together.
    *   The algorithm identifies available seats that facilitate optimal grouping.

4.  **User Notification & Confirmation:**
    *   If a seat re-assignment is proposed, the system sends a notification to the affected attendee(s) via the mobile app.
    *   The notification displays the proposed new seat location and allows the attendee to accept or reject the change.
    *   Acceptance triggers an update to the ticketing system and displays the new seat location on the attendee's mobile app and any digital ticket.
    *   Rejection prompts the system to explore alternative re-assignments or revert to the original seat.

5.  **Real-Time Adjustments:**
    *   Throughout the event (within designated time windows – e.g., before the start of the main performance, during intermission), the system continues to monitor attendee proximity and propose re-assignments based on newly detected proximity groups or changes in attendee location.

**3. Pseudocode (Seat Re-Assignment Algorithm):**

```pseudocode
function ReassignSeats(attendees, proximityGroups, seatMap):
  for each attendee in attendees:
    currentSeat = attendee.seat
    group = FindAttendeeGroup(attendee, proximityGroups)
    
    potentialSeats = FindNearbySeats(currentSeat, seatMap)
    
    bestSeat = null
    bestScore = -1
    
    for each seat in potentialSeats:
      if seat is unoccupied:
        score = CalculateSeatScore(seat, attendee, group)
        if score > bestScore:
          bestScore = score
          bestSeat = seat
          
    if bestSeat != null:
      ProposeSeatSwap(attendee, bestSeat)
      
function CalculateSeatScore(seat, attendee, group):
  score = 0
  if seat is in the same section as attendee's current seat:
    score += 10
  
  for each member in group:
    if member is within X seats of the proposed seat:
      score += 5
  
  return score

```

**4.  Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Explicit user consent is critical for location tracking and data sharing. Data anonymization and encryption should be implemented.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of attendees and real-time data streams. Cloud-based architecture and distributed processing are recommended.
*   **Security:** Robust security measures are needed to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to the system.
*   **User Experience:** The mobile app should be intuitive and easy to use.  Clear communication of proposed changes and options is essential.
*   **Venue Integration:** Close collaboration with the venue is needed to ensure proper placement of infrastructure and seamless integration with existing systems.

This system moves beyond simply *exchanging* tickets to actively *optimizing* the seating arrangement during an event, enhancing the attendee experience and fostering a more connected atmosphere.
