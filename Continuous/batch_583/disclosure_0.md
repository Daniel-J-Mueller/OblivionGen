## Adaptive Data Materialization with Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** A system for dynamically materializing relational views from non-relational data sources based on predicted query patterns, optimized for both latency and resource utilization. This extends the core concept of caching but moves *beyond* static caching towards a proactive, prediction-driven materialization strategy.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Query Pattern Analyzer (QPA):**
    *   Input: Historical query logs (from the system described in the patent, or external sources).
    *   Function: Employs time-series analysis and machine learning (e.g., LSTM networks, transformers) to identify frequently occurring query patterns, predict future query loads (volume, complexity), and estimate the required data subsets. Outputs predictive query profiles.
    *   Output: Predictive query profiles (query templates, estimated execution frequency, predicted data access patterns).

2.  **Materialization Planner (MP):**
    *   Input: Predictive query profiles, non-relational data source schema information, cost model (CPU, I/O, network).
    *   Function:  Determines optimal materialization strategies. This isnâ€™t simply "cache this table," but rather:
        *   **View Selection:** Chooses specific relational views to materialize (combining/filtering data from multiple non-relational sources).
        *   **Materialization Level:**  Decides the granularity of materialization (full materialization, partial pre-aggregation, materialized indexes).
        *   **Tiered Materialization:** Allocates materialized views across multiple storage tiers (e.g., in-memory, SSD, HDD) based on access frequency and latency requirements.
        *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Continuously monitors query performance and adjusts materialization plans in real-time.
    *   Output: Materialization plan (list of views to materialize, storage tier allocation, refresh schedule).

3.  **Data Materializer (DM):**
    *   Input: Materialization plan, access credentials for non-relational data sources.
    *   Function: Executes the materialization plan, pulling data from non-relational sources and constructing relational views in a designated storage tier.  Handles data transformation and mapping between schemas.
    *   Output: Materialized relational views.

4.  **Query Interceptor & Redirector (QIR):**
    *   Input: Incoming queries.
    *   Function: Intercepts incoming queries, analyzes them to determine if a corresponding materialized view exists. If so, redirects the query to the materialized view (transparently to the client).
    *   Output: Redirected queries or original queries (if no suitable materialized view exists).

**Pseudocode (Materialization Planner):**

```
function generate_materialization_plan(predictive_query_profiles, data_source_schemas, cost_model):
  materialization_plan = {}
  for query_profile in predictive_query_profiles:
    best_view = find_best_relational_view(query_profile, data_source_schemas)
    materialization_cost = estimate_cost(best_view, cost_model)
    benefit = estimate_benefit(best_view, query_profile)
    if benefit > materialization_cost:
      tier = determine_storage_tier(query_profile.access_frequency)
      materialization_plan[best_view] = tier
  return materialization_plan

function determine_storage_tier(access_frequency):
  if access_frequency > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    return IN_MEMORY
  elif access_frequency > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    return SSD
  else:
    return HDD
```

**Innovation Highlights:**

*   **Proactive Materialization:** Moves beyond reactive caching to proactively materialize data *before* it is requested.
*   **Predictive Prefetching:** Leverages machine learning to anticipate query patterns and pre-fetch data.
*   **Tiered Storage:** Optimizes resource utilization by allocating materialized views across multiple storage tiers.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitors query performance and adjusts materialization plans in real-time.
