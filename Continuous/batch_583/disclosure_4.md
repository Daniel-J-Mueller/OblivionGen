# 10990489

**Adaptive Replication Granularity**

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust the size of data blocks replicated based on access patterns and network conditions. The existing patent focuses on packet-level acknowledgement, but this expands on *what* is in those packets. Instead of fixed-size blocks, the system analyzes write patterns and breaks data into variable-sized 'chunks'. Frequently accessed or critical data gets smaller chunks for faster replication, while infrequently used data can be grouped into larger chunks to reduce overhead.

**Components:**

*   **Write Pattern Analyzer:** Monitors write instructions from the first computing environment. It tracks access frequency, data sensitivity (designated by the application/user), and change rates.
*   **Chunking Engine:** Based on the Write Pattern Analyzer's data, dynamically divides data into variable-sized chunks *before* packetization.  Uses a rolling window for analysis – recent activity heavily influences chunk size.
*   **Sensitivity Metadata:**  Each chunk contains metadata indicating its importance/sensitivity. This allows prioritization during replication and failover.
*   **Network Condition Monitor:** Tracks network latency, bandwidth, and packet loss. This data informs the Chunking Engine – larger chunks used when network is stable, smaller when unstable.
*   **Replication Prioritizer:** Based on Sensitivity Metadata and Network Conditions, prioritizes which chunks are replicated first.
*   **Adaptive Cache Management:**  Cache eviction policy is adjusted based on chunk size and priority. Smaller, high-priority chunks are favored.

**Pseudocode (Chunking Engine):**

```
function create_chunks(data, access_frequency, sensitivity, network_stability):
  chunk_size = base_chunk_size  //Default value

  if access_frequency > high_threshold and sensitivity == critical:
    chunk_size = min_chunk_size
  elif access_frequency > medium_threshold:
    chunk_size = medium_chunk_size
  elif network_stability < low_threshold:
    chunk_size = small_chunk_size
  else:
    chunk_size = max_chunk_size

  chunks = split_data_into_chunks(data, chunk_size)
  return chunks
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Chunk`: {`data`, `size`, `priority`, `chunk_id`, `metadata`}
*   `AccessHistory`: {`data_id`, `timestamp`, `access_count`}

**Failure Handling:**

*   If a chunk replication fails, the system attempts to resend it with a smaller chunk size.
*   Critical data chunks are retried more aggressively.

**Scalability:**

*   The system can be extended to support multiple tiers of storage, replicating critical data to faster, more reliable storage.
*   Distributed Chunking Engine to handle high write loads.
