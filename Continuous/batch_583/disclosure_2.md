## Adaptive Credential Orchestration via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Concept:** Extend the authentication manager’s capabilities to leverage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for a more robust, privacy-preserving, and interoperable authentication system. This moves beyond simply *storing* credentials to *orchestrating* their use across multiple services and managing their lifecycle.

**Specifications:**

**1. DID/VC Integration Module:**

*   **Function:** This module handles the creation, storage, and revocation of DIDs and VCs associated with the user. It interacts with a DID registry (e.g., on a blockchain or distributed ledger) and utilizes cryptographic libraries for secure key management.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DIDDocument`: Stores the user's DID, public keys, and service endpoints.
    *   `VerifiableCredential`: Encodes assertions about the user's identity or attributes (e.g., age, affiliation) signed by a trusted issuer.
    *   `CredentialRegistry`:  Local storage of VCs, indexed by issuer and type.
*   **APIs:**
    *   `createDID()`: Generates a new DID and associated key pair.
    *   `issueCredential(issuer, claim, credentialType)`: Requests a VC from a specified issuer for a given claim and credential type. (Requires communication with the issuer's service).
    *   `verifyCredential(credential, expectedIssuer)`: Validates a VC’s signature and issuer.
    *   `presentCredential(serviceEndpoint, credential)`:  Sends a VC to a requesting service for authentication.

**2.  Dynamic Trust Policy Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Manages trust relationships between the user, the authentication manager, and various service providers. This goes beyond simple certificate validation to incorporate contextual factors.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `TrustPolicy`: Defines the criteria for trusting a service provider (e.g., required credentials, reputation score, privacy policy).
    *   `ServiceProfile`:  Stores information about a service provider, including its supported authentication methods and trust requirements.
    *   `ReputationDatabase`:  Tracks the reputation of service providers based on user feedback and security audits.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   `evaluateTrust(serviceProfile, presentedCredentials)`:  Determines whether to trust a service provider based on its profile and the credentials presented.
    *   `policyUpdate(serviceProfile, event)`:  Dynamically updates trust policies based on events (e.g., security breaches, policy changes).

**3.  Portable Credential Wallet:**

*   **Function:** Provides a secure and user-friendly interface for managing DIDs, VCs, and other digital identity assets.
*   **Features:**
    *   Secure storage of private keys (e.g., using hardware security modules).
    *   Credential selection and presentation.
    *   Transaction signing.
    *   Audit trail of authentication events.
*   **Implementation:** Can be implemented as a standalone app or integrated into the authentication manager’s UI.

**4.  Inter-Wallet Communication Protocol:**

*   **Function:** Enables secure communication between the authentication manager and other digital wallets.
*   **Protocol:**  Uses a standardized message format and cryptographic protocols for secure exchange of credentials and authentication requests.
*   **Benefits:** Allows users to seamlessly authenticate with services using their preferred wallet.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Flow):**

```
// Client initiates authentication with a service

1.  Request service authentication endpoint.
2.  Authentication Manager retrieves relevant Verifiable Credentials for the service.
3.  Authentication Manager packages VC and DID document.
4.  Authentication Manager sends signed packet to service endpoint.
5.  Service verifies signature and DID.
6.  Service evaluates trust policy and VC claims.
7.  Service authenticates user if policy is satisfied.
```

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond simple credential storage and automated filling. It introduces a dynamic, privacy-focused authentication system leveraging DIDs and VCs. This enables greater user control over their identity data, interoperability with other wallets, and more robust security. This is not simply automating what exists, but orchestrating a new paradigm for digital identity.
