## Adaptive Problem Decomposition & User Incentive System

**Concept:** Expand upon the distributed computing approach by dynamically tailoring problem decomposition *not* just to device capability, but to predicted user engagement and incentivizing sustained contribution through a tiered reward system linked to verifiable computational contribution.

**Specifications:**

**1. Problem Decomposition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Large computational problem.
*   **Process:**
    *   Initial problem segmentation into variable-sized sub-problems.
    *   Dynamic analysis of user data (historical contribution, device specs, network conditions, *predicted* session length - see User Profiler module).
    *   Sub-problem assignment prioritizing:
        *   Matching sub-problem complexity to device capability.
        *   Maximizing estimated user engagement time (e.g., shorter sub-problems for users with volatile network connections or predicted short session lengths).
        *   Diversity of assigned sub-problems to prevent monotony and encourage sustained participation.
*   **Output:** List of sub-problems with assigned priority scores, ready for distribution.

**2. User Profiler:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User ID.
    *   Device Specifications (OS, CPU, Memory, Network Speed - passively collected upon initial participation).
    *   Historical Contribution Data (number of solved sub-problems, time spent contributing, solution accuracy).
    *   Session Prediction Algorithm: Uses machine learning to predict session length based on time of day, day of week, user history, and external factors (e.g., scheduled events on the user’s calendar – optional integration).
*   **Output:** User Engagement Score (UES) – a composite score representing the likelihood of sustained user contribution.

**3. Incentive & Reward System:**

*   **Tiered System:** Users progress through tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) based on cumulative UES and solution accuracy.
*   **Reward Mechanisms:**
    *   **Cryptographic Tokens:** Awarded for each solved sub-problem, quantity scaled by sub-problem complexity and solution accuracy.
    *   **Tier Benefits:** Higher tiers unlock benefits:
        *   Access to more complex (and higher-reward) sub-problems.
        *   Priority queuing for sub-problem assignments.
        *   Exclusive virtual badges/achievements.
    *   **Verifiable Computation:** Employ zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to ensure solution validity without revealing the solution itself. This enhances trust and prevents malicious submissions. This ensures that submitted data is actually reflective of valid computation.
*   **Token Exchange:** Integration with a decentralized exchange (DEX) to allow users to exchange earned tokens for other cryptocurrencies or potentially fiat currency.

**4. Communication Protocol:**

*   **WebSockets:** Real-time, bidirectional communication between server and user devices for efficient sub-problem delivery, solution submission, and reward distribution.
*   **Encrypted Communication:** End-to-end encryption to protect user data and prevent eavesdropping.

**Pseudocode (Sub-Problem Assignment):**

```
function assign_subproblem(user_id, available_subproblems):
    user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
    user_engagement_score = user_profile.engagement_score
    user_device_capability = user_profile.device_capability

    filtered_subproblems = []
    for subproblem in available_subproblems:
        if subproblem.complexity <= user_device_capability:
            filtered_subproblems.append(subproblem)

    if not filtered_subproblems:
        return null  // No suitable subproblems

    // Sort subproblems based on a combined score:
    //   - Complexity (lower is better)
    //   - User Engagement Score (higher is better)
    sorted_subproblems = sort(filtered_subproblems, by=[subproblem.complexity, -user_engagement_score])

    return sorted_subproblems[0] // Assign the top subproblem
```

**Novelty:** This system expands beyond simple device capability matching by incorporating predictive user engagement and a robust incentive system that directly rewards verifiable computational contribution. The use of ZKPs for validation enhances trust and security. This creates a more dynamic, sustainable, and reliable distributed computing platform.
