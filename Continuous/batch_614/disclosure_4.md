**Dynamic Hierarchy Weighting & Predictive Scenario Generation**

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical forecasting system to not just disaggregate overrides, but to *dynamically* adjust the weighting of hierarchy levels based on real-time external data and predictive scenario modeling. This moves beyond static hierarchies to fluid, responsive forecasting.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion Module:**
    *   Input: Time series data (as per existing patent), plus real-time external data streams (e.g., weather, social media sentiment, economic indicators, competitor pricing, supply chain disruptions).
    *   Processing: Data cleansing, normalization, and feature extraction. Identify correlations between external data and historical time series data.
*   **Hierarchy Weighting Engine:**
    *   Input: Time series data, external data, user-defined “influence factors” (allowing manual adjustment of external data impact).
    *   Process: Employ a Bayesian Network or similar probabilistic model to calculate dynamic weights for each hierarchy level.  Higher weights indicate greater responsiveness to changes at that level.  Weights are recalculated at defined intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
    *   Output: Hierarchy weight vector (e.g., \[Product: 0.6, Channel: 0.2, Location: 0.2]).
*   **Predictive Scenario Modeler:**
    *   Input: Historical time series data, external data, user-defined scenarios (e.g., "New Product Launch," "Competitor Promotion," "Supply Chain Delay").
    *   Process: Utilize Monte Carlo simulation or agent-based modeling to generate multiple future scenarios based on the defined inputs and probabilistic models.
    *   Output: Set of potential future time series datasets (one for each scenario).
*   **Forecast Engine (modified):**
    *   Input: Time series data, dynamic hierarchy weights, predictive scenario datasets.
    *   Process:
        1.  Generate base forecast using existing disaggregation methods.
        2.  Adjust base forecast based on dynamic hierarchy weights (amplifying changes at higher-weighted levels).
        3.  Generate multiple “scenario forecasts” by blending the base forecast with the scenario forecasts.
    *   Output: Base forecast, scenario forecasts, probability distributions for each forecast.
*   **Visualization & User Interface:**
    *   Interactive dashboard displaying:
        *   Dynamic hierarchy weights.
        *   Scenario forecasts.
        *   Probability distributions.
        *   “What-if” analysis tools (allowing users to modify scenarios and observe impacts).
        *   Alerts triggered by significant deviations from expected outcomes.
        *   Visualization of forecast confidence intervals.

**Pseudocode (Forecast Engine - modified section):**

```
function generateForecast(timeSeriesData, hierarchyWeights, scenarioDatasets) {
  baseForecast = generateBaseForecast(timeSeriesData);

  weightedForecast = applyHierarchyWeights(baseForecast, hierarchyWeights);

  scenarioForecasts = [];
  for each scenario in scenarioDatasets {
    blendedForecast = blendForecasts(weightedForecast, scenario, blendingFactor); // blendingFactor dynamically calculated based on scenario probability
    scenarioForecasts.append(blendedForecast);
  }

  return {
    baseForecast: weightedForecast,
    scenarioForecasts: scenarioForecasts
  };
}
```

**Key Innovation:** This moves beyond passive disaggregation to *proactive* forecasting, adapting to real-time changes and enabling scenario planning. The dynamic hierarchy weighting allows the system to focus on the most relevant levels of granularity, while the scenario modeling provides insights into potential future outcomes.
