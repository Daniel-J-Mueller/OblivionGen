## Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion for Predictive Maintenance

**System Overview:** A distributed sensor network integrated with an edge-computing AI to predict component failure *before* it occurs, utilizing not just image data, but correlated data streams.

**Core Innovation:**  Rather than solely diagnosing anomalies *from* images (as the source patent seems to lean towards), this system *predicts* when an anomaly *will* occur by fusing imaging data with other sensor data to establish baselines and detect deviations indicating impending failure.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Distributed Sensor Nodes:** Each imaging device from the source patent is augmented with the following:
    *   **Vibration Sensor:**  Tri-axial accelerometer.
    *   **Temperature Sensor:** Thermistor or infrared sensor.
    *   **Current Sensor:** Measures power draw of the imaging device.
    *   **Microphone:** Captures subtle acoustic changes.
*   **Edge Compute Unit (ECU):**  A small, embedded computer (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4) located near the imaging device.  Responsible for initial data processing and AI inference.
*   **Central Server:**  A cloud-based server for long-term data storage, model retraining, and system management.

**Software Components:**

*   **Data Acquisition Module:**  Collects data from all sensors at a configurable frequency.
*   **Feature Extraction Module:**  Extracts relevant features from each sensor stream.  This includes:
    *   **Image Data:**  Descriptor statistics as outlined in the source patent (Laplacian variance, sum of gradients, etc.).
    *   **Vibration Data:**  RMS amplitude, frequency spectrum, kurtosis.
    *   **Temperature Data:**  Mean, standard deviation, rate of change.
    *   **Current Data:**  Mean, standard deviation, peak current.
    *   **Audio Data:**  Spectral centroid, bandwidth, zero-crossing rate.
*   **Data Fusion Module:**  Combines the extracted features into a single feature vector.  This can be done using a variety of techniques, such as:
    *   **Weighted Averaging:**  Assigns weights to each feature based on its importance.
    *   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**  Reduces the dimensionality of the feature vector.
    *   **Kalman Filtering:**  Estimates the state of the system over time.
*   **Anomaly Detection Model:**  A machine learning model trained to predict component failure based on the fused feature vector.
    *   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:** Excellent for processing time-series data and detecting subtle changes that may indicate an impending failure. The LSTM would be trained on historical data to establish a baseline and predict when a deviation from that baseline exceeds a threshold.
*   **Alerting System:**  Notifies maintenance personnel when a component is predicted to fail.

**Pseudocode (LSTM Training & Prediction):**

```
# Training Phase:
FOR each data point in historical dataset:
  Extract features (image, vibration, temp, current, audio)
  Create fused feature vector
  Train LSTM network with fused feature vector & known failure status

# Prediction Phase (Real-time):
WHILE True:
  Acquire data from sensors
  Extract features
  Create fused feature vector
  Predict failure probability using trained LSTM network
  IF failure probability > threshold:
    Trigger alert
    Log event
  END IF
END WHILE
```

**Novelty:**  

*   **Proactive vs. Reactive:**  Shifts from diagnosing existing anomalies to predicting future failures.
*   **Multi-Sensor Fusion:**  Combines imaging data with other sensor data to improve prediction accuracy and reduce false positives.
*   **LSTM for Time-Series Analysis:** Leverages the power of LSTM networks to detect subtle changes in sensor data that may indicate an impending failure.
*   **Edge Computing:**  Performs data processing and AI inference at the edge of the network, reducing latency and bandwidth requirements.
