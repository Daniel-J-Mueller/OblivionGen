## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend sound source localization beyond pinpointing direction to *reconstructing* the acoustic environment over time, creating a dynamic, navigable "sound map". This allows for a richer understanding of the environment and more nuanced interaction with audio events. The temporal anchoring piece links specific audio features to reconstructed locations over time, improving the reliability and interpretability of the 'sound map'.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum 8-element microphone array, spatially distributed for 360° coverage. Calibrated for accurate Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation.
*   **Audio Input:**  48kHz sample rate, 24-bit depth.
*   **Preprocessing:** Noise reduction (spectral subtraction or deep learning based), automatic gain control, bandpass filtering (200Hz - 10kHz – tunable).
*   **Beamforming:**  Delay-and-Sum beamforming for initial sound source localization.  Adaptive beamforming (e.g., MVDR) for enhanced direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation in noisy environments.

**II. Localization & Reconstruction Engine:**

*   **TDOA Calculation:** High-precision TDOA calculation algorithms utilizing cross-correlation techniques.
*   **Source Localization:** Triangulation or hyperbola-based localization algorithms to estimate 3D coordinates of sound sources. Kalman filtering to smooth source trajectories and predict future positions.
*   **Spatial Mapping:**  Create a volumetric grid representing the acoustic environment. Each grid cell stores:
    *   Sound Pressure Level (SPL) – aggregated over time.
    *   Dominant Frequency – representative of the sound source.
    *   Source ID – tracking individual sound sources over time.
    *   Temporal Anchor – Timestamp of the last significant audio event detected in that cell.
*   **Reverberation Modeling:** Implement a rudimentary room impulse response (RIR) model to simulate acoustic reflections and improve the realism of the reconstructed environment.

**III. Temporal Anchoring System:**

*   **Feature Extraction:** Extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) and other relevant audio features from the input signal.
*   **Event Detection:**  Employ a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based event detectors (e.g., keyword spotting, sound event classification).
*   **Anchor Creation:** When an audio event is detected:
    *   Determine the most likely spatial location of the event using the localization engine.
    *   Record the event's timestamp, features, and spatial location as a "temporal anchor" within the corresponding grid cell.
*   **Anchor Resolution:**  When querying the reconstructed environment:
    *   Retrieve temporal anchors within a specified radius of a target location.
    *   Filter anchors based on timestamp, relevance to the query, and confidence level.
    *   Use the resolved anchors to reconstruct the acoustic history of the target location.

**IV.  Output & Visualization:**

*   **Spatial Audio Rendering:**  Reconstruct the acoustic environment using head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a 3D spatial audio experience.
*   **Visual Map:** Generate a visual representation of the reconstructed environment, displaying:
    *   Sound source locations.
    *   Sound pressure levels.
    *   Temporal anchors representing significant audio events.
    *   Trajectory of sound sources over time.
*   **Data Export:**  Allow export of the reconstructed environment data in a standardized format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for further analysis or processing.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Anchor Resolution):**

```
function resolve_anchors(location, radius, timestamp_range):
  anchors = spatial_database.query(location, radius)  // Retrieve anchors within radius
  filtered_anchors = []

  for anchor in anchors:
    if anchor.timestamp >= timestamp_range.start and anchor.timestamp <= timestamp_range.end:
      filtered_anchors.append(anchor)

  //Sort by relevancy/confidence/timestamp
  sorted_anchors = sort(filtered_anchors, criteria = "relevancy")

  return sorted_anchors
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Augmented Reality:**  Overlaying virtual sound sources onto the real world.
*   **Security Systems:**  Identifying and tracking sound events in a monitored area.
*   **Smart Homes:**  Creating immersive audio experiences and controlling devices with voice commands.
*   **Acoustic Mapping:**  Analyzing the acoustic properties of a space for architectural design.
*   **Assistive Technology:**  Providing spatial audio cues to visually impaired individuals.
