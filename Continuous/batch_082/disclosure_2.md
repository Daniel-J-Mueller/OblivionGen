## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Cardinality

**Concept:** Dynamically shard database tables *not* based on fixed ranges or hashes, but on *predicted* cardinality of specific field values combined with real-time query load. This moves beyond normalization to proactive data distribution.

**Specification:**

**1. Cardinality Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Historical query logs, table schema, data samples.
*   **Process:** Utilizes a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict the future cardinality of values within specific fields. The model factors in seasonality, trends, and potential external events (e.g., marketing campaigns) that might influence data distribution.  A confidence interval is generated alongside the cardinality prediction.
*   **Output:**  For each field, a predicted cardinality value *and* confidence interval for a defined future period (e.g., next 24 hours).

**2. Dynamic Sharding Manager:**

*   **Input:** Predicted cardinality data from the Cardinality Prediction Engine, real-time query load monitoring (queries per second, resource utilization), table schema.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Shard Creation/Deletion:** If a field’s predicted cardinality falls below a threshold *and* the confidence interval is low, initiate a shard creation process for that field’s values. Conversely, if cardinality is predicted to remain low, consolidate shards.
    *   **Shard Assignment:** Assign values to shards based on predicted cardinality. Values with consistently low cardinality are placed in dedicated shards. Higher cardinality values are distributed across a larger number of shards.
    *   **Query Rewriting:**  Intercept incoming queries and rewrite them to target the appropriate shards. The Query Rewriter analyzes the query’s `WHERE` clause and uses the shard mapping to distribute the query across the relevant shards.
*   **Output:** Updated shard map, rewritten queries.

**3. Shard Map:**

*   **Structure:** Key-value store.
*   **Key:**  Table name, field name.
*   **Value:** List of shard IDs and corresponding value ranges or identifiers.

**4. Query Rewriter Pseudocode:**

```
function rewrite_query(query, shard_map):
  // 1. Parse query to identify table and WHERE clause
  table_name, where_clause = parse_query(query)

  // 2. Retrieve shard map for table
  shard_map_entry = shard_map.get(table_name)

  if shard_map_entry is null:
    // No sharding applied - return original query
    return query

  // 3. Analyze WHERE clause for relevant fields
  relevant_fields = extract_fields_from_where_clause(where_clause)

  // 4. Generate shard-specific queries
  shard_queries = []
  for field in relevant_fields:
    if field in shard_map_entry:
      for shard_id, value_range in shard_map_entry[field]:
        // Create a new query tailored to the shard
        shard_query = create_shard_query(query, shard_id, value_range)
        shard_queries.append(shard_query)
    else:
      // Field not sharded - add original query to list
      shard_queries.append(query)

  // 5. Combine shard queries (e.g., using UNION ALL)
  combined_query = combine_queries(shard_queries)

  return combined_query
```

**5. Data Migration Strategy:**

*   Incremental migration to minimize downtime.
*   Background process to redistribute data based on predicted cardinality.
*   Utilize a consistent hashing algorithm to ensure minimal data movement during shard rebalancing.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.
*   Reduced storage costs by optimizing data distribution.
*   Increased scalability by distributing the load across multiple shards.
*   Adaptive to changing data patterns and query workloads.
