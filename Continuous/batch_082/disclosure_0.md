## Adaptive Intent Prioritization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback data (heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, EEG) from the user into the intent re-ranking process. This allows the system to prioritize intents aligned with the user's current emotional and cognitive state, drastically improving accuracy in ambiguous situations.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**
    *   Support for multiple biofeedback sensors via Bluetooth/USB.
    *   Real-time data acquisition and pre-processing (noise filtering, artifact removal).
    *   API for adding new sensor types and calibration procedures.
2.  **Emotional/Cognitive State Estimation:**
    *   Utilize machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, support vector machines) to map biofeedback data to emotional/cognitive states (e.g., focused, stressed, relaxed, confused).
    *   Model training with labeled biofeedback data sets.
    *   Confidence scoring for state estimation.
3.  **Intent Scoring Adjustment:**
    *   Each identified intent is assigned a base score based on NLU confidence and contextual data (as per existing patent).
    *   A ‘state alignment score’ is calculated for each intent based on the estimated user state.  This score reflects how well the intent aligns with the user’s current emotional/cognitive state.
    *   Example: User is stressed (high heart rate, low HRV). Intent related to “calming music” receives a significantly higher state alignment score.
    *   Final intent score = Base Score + (State Alignment Score \* Weighting Factor). The weighting factor allows tuning the influence of biofeedback data.
4.  **Dynamic Weighting Factor Adjustment:**
    *   Implement a feedback loop to dynamically adjust the weighting factor based on user interaction.
    *   If the system consistently misinterprets intents despite accurate biofeedback data, the weighting factor is reduced.
    *   If biofeedback-aligned intent prioritization leads to higher user satisfaction (measured through explicit feedback or implicit signals), the weighting factor is increased.
5.  **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All biofeedback data is processed locally on the device whenever possible.
    *   If data is transmitted to a server, it must be anonymized and encrypted.
    *   Users have full control over whether biofeedback data is collected and used.
6.  **System Architecture:**

    ```pseudocode
    Class BiofeedbackIntegration:
        Function initialize():
            Connect to biofeedback sensor
            Load pre-trained state estimation model
        Function acquire_data():
            Read raw biofeedback data
            Preprocess data (noise filtering, artifact removal)
            Return preprocessed data
        Function estimate_state(data):
            Use state estimation model to predict emotional/cognitive state
            Return predicted state and confidence score
        Function calculate_state_alignment_score(intent, state):
            # Logic to determine how well the intent aligns with the state
            # Example: Use a knowledge base or semantic similarity metrics
            Return alignment score
    Class IntentReRanker:
        Function rerank_intents(intents, user_state, weighting_factor):
            For each intent in intents:
                state_alignment_score = BiofeedbackIntegration.calculate_state_alignment_score(intent, user_state)
                intent.score += state_alignment_score * weighting_factor
            Sort intents based on score
            Return sorted intents
    ```

7.  **Calibration Procedure:**

    *   Initial calibration session to establish baseline biofeedback patterns for different emotional/cognitive states.
    *   User is guided through a series of tasks designed to elicit specific states (e.g., watching a funny video, solving a difficult puzzle).
    *   Biofeedback data is recorded and labeled, then used to fine-tune the state estimation model.
