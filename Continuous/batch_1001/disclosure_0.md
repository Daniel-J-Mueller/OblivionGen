## Dynamic Persona Synthesis for Cross-Device Personalization

**Concept:** Extend the existing personalization framework by building *synthetic* personas representing predicted user behavior across different devices and contexts, even with limited direct data. This goes beyond simply identifying a user across devices; it anticipates *how* that user will behave on a new device or in an unfamiliar situation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Core:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Entity Identifier (as in the patent)
    *   Context Information (as in the patent)
    *   Device Profile: Screen size, OS, input method (touch, mouse, voice), network conditions.
    *   Application Profile: Application currently in use, permission levels, usage patterns within that application.
    *   Historical Interaction Data: Browsing, purchases, selections, device settings (from all linked devices).
    *   Explicit User Preferences: User-defined settings, stated interests.
*   **Persona Generation:**
    *   Utilize a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).  The Generator creates a “synthetic” user profile, and the Discriminator attempts to distinguish it from real user data.  This forces the Generator to produce realistic, nuanced personas.
    *   The GAN’s training data is the aggregated and anonymized historical interaction data from all users.
    *   Output: A vector representing the synthesized persona. This vector contains probabilities for various behavioral traits (e.g., propensity to click on ads, preferred content categories, tolerance for interruptions, sensitivity to price).

**2. Contextual Persona Blending:**

*   Input:
    *   Current Context Information (time, location, event, etc.)
    *   Current Device Profile
    *   Synthesized Persona Vector (from step 1)
    *   Real-time User Behavior (clicks, scrolls, dwell time) – *initial* data to refine the persona.
*   Blending Algorithm:
    *   Weighted average between the synthesized persona and the real-time behavior. The weights are dynamically adjusted based on the confidence level of the synthesized persona (determined by the GAN’s training performance) and the amount of real-time data available.
    *   Utilize a Kalman Filter to smooth the blended persona over time, reducing noise and improving accuracy.
*   Output: A blended persona vector representing the predicted user behavior in the current context.

**3. Content Allocation & Refinement:**

*   Input: Blended Persona Vector
*   Content Selection: Based on the blended persona vector, select content (ads, recommendations, features) that aligns with the predicted user preferences and behavior.
*   A/B Testing & Reinforcement Learning: Continuously A/B test different content variations and use reinforcement learning to optimize the content selection algorithm based on user engagement metrics (clicks, conversions, time spent).

**4.  Cross-Device Consistency:**

*   Ensure consistent personalization across all devices linked to the entity identifier.  The blended persona vector is shared across devices, allowing for a seamless user experience.
*   Implement a feedback loop: User interactions on one device are used to refine the blended persona, which in turn influences the personalization on other devices.



**Pseudocode (Core Persona Generation - Simplified):**

```
// GAN Training (done offline)
TrainGAN(HistoricalData)

// Online Persona Generation
function GeneratePersona(EntityID, DeviceProfile, ContextInfo):
    basePersona = RetrieveBasePersona(EntityID) // Retrieve from storage, if available
    if basePersona is null:
        basePersona = GANGenerator(EntityID) // Generate a new persona
        StorePersona(EntityID, basePersona)

    personaVector = Blend(basePersona, DeviceProfile, ContextInfo)
    return personaVector
```

This system aims to deliver hyper-personalized content by anticipating user needs and preferences, even in novel situations. The synthetic persona generation provides a foundation for personalization even when limited data is available, and the continuous refinement through real-time behavior and A/B testing ensures optimal performance.
