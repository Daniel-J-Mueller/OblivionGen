## Adaptive Difficulty & Skill Modeling – Dynamic Tutorial Generation

**Concept:** Extend the user profiling beyond age/category to actively model skill level *within* an application and use this to dynamically generate tailored tutorials and challenges. This builds on the idea of adapting *to* a user, but proactively *teaching* them.

**Specs:**

1.  **Skill Metric:** Implement a "Skill Score" for each application feature/module. This is a floating-point value initialized to 0.0.
2.  **Action Tracking:** Every user action within an application (button press, swipe, input, completion of a task) is logged with a weight. Successful actions *increase* the Skill Score, failures *decrease* it. Weightings are configurable per action. Complex actions have higher weights.
3.  **Skill Decay:** Implement a "decay rate" for the Skill Score.  If a feature isn't used for a period, the score slowly decreases, simulating skill loss.
4.  **Tutorial Triggering:**  When the Skill Score for a feature falls below a threshold, a tutorial is automatically triggered. Tutorial content is selected based on the *specific* skill deficit.
5.  **Dynamic Challenge Generation:** Instead of fixed difficulty levels, generate challenges based on the user’s current Skill Score. The system aims to keep the user in a “flow state” – challenged, but not overwhelmed.
6.  **Tutorial Styles:** Implement multiple tutorial styles (e.g., guided walkthrough, hint system, quick tips, video demonstration). The system dynamically selects the most appropriate style based on user preferences and skill level.
7.  **Difficulty Adjustment:**
    *   **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    function adjustDifficulty(userSkillScore, challengeScore) {
      difficultyMultiplier = 1.0;

      if (userSkillScore < challengeScore * 0.5) {
        difficultyMultiplier = 0.5; //Reduce difficulty
      } else if (userSkillScore > challengeScore * 1.5) {
        difficultyMultiplier = 1.5; //Increase difficulty
      }

      newChallengeScore = challengeScore * difficultyMultiplier;
      return newChallengeScore;
    }
    ```

8.  **Data Storage:** Store user Skill Scores and preferences in a persistent data store, linked to their user profile.
9.  **API Integration:** Provide a well-defined API for applications to access the Skill Modeling system. The API should allow applications to:
    *   Report user actions.
    *   Retrieve Skill Scores.
    *   Request tutorials.
    *   Define custom actions and weights.
10. **User Feedback Mechanism:** Integrate a user feedback system to allow users to rate the helpfulness of tutorials. Use this feedback to improve the tutorial selection algorithm.



This extends the base patent by moving beyond simply adapting *how* an application presents content based on user profile, but actively *teaching* the user through dynamically generated content, customized to their skill level. It’s more proactive and personalized, going beyond just safety and privacy.
