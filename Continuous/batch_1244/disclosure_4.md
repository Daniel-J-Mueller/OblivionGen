## Dynamic Certificate Revocation Orchestration via Predictive Analysis

**Specification:** A system to proactively manage certificate revocation based on predicted compromise risk, moving beyond reactive blacklist approaches.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely relying on certificate authorities (CAs) and revocation lists, a distributed network of agents assesses the likelihood of certificate compromise *before* it occurs, and preemptively isolates potentially compromised servers. This utilizes behavioral analysis, threat intelligence feeds, and machine learning to predict risk.

**Components:**

*   **Risk Assessment Agents (RAAs):** Deployed on each server within the cluster. RAAs collect metrics: CPU/Memory usage, network I/O patterns, system call frequency, process behavior, external DNS queries, and correlation with known threat intelligence feeds (malware signatures, compromised IP addresses, vulnerability reports).
*   **Behavioral Baseline Engine (BBE):** A central service that establishes a normal behavioral profile for each server based on RAA data. Utilizes time-series analysis and anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forests, One-Class SVM) to identify deviations from the baseline.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration (TII):** Continuously pulls and correlates threat intelligence feeds (e.g., VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, AlienVault OTX) with server activity.  The TII assigns a risk score based on correlation strength.
*   **Predictive Risk Engine (PRE):** Combines baseline deviation scores, threat intelligence scores, and historical data to calculate a predictive risk score for each certificate. Uses a machine learning model (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Random Forest) trained on historical compromise data.
*   **Dynamic Isolation Controller (DIC):** Automatically removes servers exceeding a defined risk threshold from the load balancer rotation. The DIC initiates a ‘soft quarantine’ – the server remains online but receives no new traffic.  A remediation workflow is triggered.
*   **Remediation Workflow:**  Includes automated actions like: certificate revocation requests to the CA, server reboot, vulnerability scans, and security log analysis.

**Data Flow:**

1.  RAAs collect server metrics and send them to the BBE.
2.  BBE establishes baseline behavior and sends deviation scores to the PRE.
3.  TII correlates server activity with threat intelligence feeds and sends risk scores to the PRE.
4.  PRE combines deviation scores, threat intelligence scores, and historical data to calculate a predictive risk score for each certificate.
5.  If the risk score exceeds a threshold, the DIC removes the server from the load balancer rotation.
6.  The Remediation Workflow is initiated.

**Pseudocode (DIC – Dynamic Isolation Controller):**

```
function IsolateServer(serverID, certificateID, riskScore) {
  if (riskScore > configuration.isolationThreshold) {
    Log("Server " + serverID + " exceeding isolation threshold. Isolating.");
    RemoveServerFromLoadBalancer(serverID);
    TriggerRemediationWorkflow(serverID, certificateID);
    SendAlert("Server " + serverID + " isolated due to high risk.");
  }
}

function MonitorRiskScores(serverList) {
  while (true) {
    for (server in serverList) {
      riskScore = GetPredictiveRiskScore(server.id, server.certificate.id);
      IsolateServer(server.id, server.certificate.id, riskScore);
    }
    Sleep(configuration.monitoringInterval);
  }
}
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `isolationThreshold`: The risk score above which a server is isolated.
*   `monitoringInterval`: The frequency at which risk scores are checked.
*   `remediationWorkflow`:  Pointer to the remediation workflow service.
*   `threatIntelligenceSources`: List of threat intelligence feeds to integrate.
