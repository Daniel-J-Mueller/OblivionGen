## Modular Rib Assembly with Integrated Environmental Control

**Concept:** Expand on the rib assembly's structural role by integrating a micro-environmental control system within the plates. This allows for temperature and humidity regulation around sensitive components within the shuttle system (e.g., linear motors, sensors, data storage) – preventing overheating, condensation, or damage from external factors.

**Specs:**

*   **Plate Material:** Replace current metal plates with a composite material – a polymer matrix reinforced with graphene or carbon nanotubes – for enhanced thermal conductivity & lightweight properties. The composite will incorporate microchannels.
*   **Microchannel Network:** Embedded within the composite plates – a dense network of microchannels (0.5-1mm diameter). These channels are integrated into the plate design during manufacturing.
*   **Fluid Circulation:** A micro-pump (piezoelectric or MEMS-based) will circulate a dielectric coolant (e.g., fluorinert) through the microchannels. Pump capacity: 5-10ml/min.
*   **Heat Exchanger:** Integrate a miniature heat exchanger (Peltier element based) into the rib assembly, connected to the microchannel network. Heat exchanger is capable of both heating and cooling.
*   **Sensors:** Incorporate temperature and humidity sensors within the plates, communicating data to a central control unit. Sensor accuracy: +/- 0.5°C, +/- 2% RH.
*   **Control Unit:** A small, embedded microcontroller responsible for managing pump speed, heat exchanger operation, and sensor data. Communication protocol: I2C or SPI.
*   **Power Supply:** Utilize the existing shuttle power infrastructure, converting voltage to required levels for pump, sensors, and control unit.
*   **Assembly:** The assembly will use the existing tab and slot design, but with slight modifications to accommodate microchannel connections and sensor wiring.
*   **Spacers:** Modified spacers will include channels for coolant flow between plates and wiring for sensors and control unit.
*   **Coolant Reservoir:** A small, sealed reservoir within the rib assembly to store coolant. Refillable via a micro-port.

**Pseudocode (Control Unit Logic):**

```
// Variables
targetTemperature = 25°C
targetHumidity = 50%
currentTemperature = readTemperatureSensor()
currentHumidity = readHumiditySensor()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  currentTemperature = readTemperatureSensor()
  currentHumidity = readHumiditySensor()

  temperatureDifference = targetTemperature - currentTemperature
  humidityDifference = targetHumidity - currentHumidity

  if (abs(temperatureDifference) > 1°C) {
    adjustHeatExchanger(temperatureDifference)
    adjustPumpSpeed(temperatureDifference)
  }

  if (abs(humidityDifference) > 5%) {
      adjustPumpSpeed(humidityDifference) // use pump to change evaporation/condensation
  }

  delay(100ms)
}

// Function to adjust heat exchanger
function adjustHeatExchanger(difference) {
  if (difference > 0) {
    heatExchanger.setHeating(true)
  } else {
    heatExchanger.setCooling(true)
  }
}

// Function to adjust pump speed
function adjustPumpSpeed(difference) {
    pump.setSpeed(abs(difference) * 0.1)
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased component reliability and lifespan.
*   Improved performance of temperature-sensitive components.
*   Reduced risk of system failure due to environmental factors.
*   Potential for energy savings by optimizing component temperature.
