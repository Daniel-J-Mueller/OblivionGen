## Modular Electronic Device with Kinetic Energy Harvesting & Haptic Feedback

**Core Concept:** An electronic device comprised of interconnected, geometrically variable modules. These modules contain micro-generators capable of harvesting kinetic energy from user manipulation (flexing, twisting, sliding) and converting it to usable power. Coupled with advanced haptic feedback systems, the device can *respond* to user interaction with nuanced physical sensations, creating an immersive and intuitive experience.

**Module Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions:** 30mm x 30mm x 8mm (base module). Modules can expand/contract along one or more axes via internal flexible polymer structures.
*   **Connectivity:** Magnetic interlocking system with embedded conductive pathways for data and power transfer between modules. Connection strength adjustable via software.
*   **Material:** Outer shell: Recycled Aluminum alloy. Internal structure: Flexible, bio-compatible polymer reinforced with carbon nanotubes.
*   **Micro-Generator:** Piezoelectric micro-generators embedded within the flexible polymer structure. Activated by deformation. Output: 3.3V DC. (Target: 50mW per module with moderate manipulation).
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Micro-fluidic chambers within each module. Fluid pumped via micro-pumps, altering module rigidity and creating localized pressure/texture changes. Resolution: 1mm.
*   **Processor:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M7 microcontroller per module. Modules communicate via a mesh network using Bluetooth Low Energy.
*   **Power Management:** Each module contains a supercapacitor for energy storage. Energy harvested from kinetic energy and potentially wireless charging.
*   **Sensors:** Each module incorporates an accelerometer, gyroscope, and proximity sensor.

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop (Per Module)
while (true) {
  readAccelerometer();
  readGyroscope();
  readProximity();

  calculateKineticEnergy();

  if (kineticEnergy > threshold) {
    generatePower();
    storeEnergy();
  }

  receiveCommand(); // From central processor/user input
  if (command == "hapticFeedback") {
    activateHapticActuators(intensity, pattern);
  }

  if (command == "moduleAdjustment"){
    adjustModuleShape(desiredShape);
  }

  transmitData(); // To mesh network
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Adaptive Controllers:** Device configures itself to specific tasks, physical adjustments providing tactile feedback for fine control (e.g., gaming, VR/AR interaction, robotics control).
*   **Biometric/Health Monitoring:** Flexible modules conform to the body, tracking movement, pressure, and physiological data (heart rate, skin conductivity). Kinetic energy from movement supplements power.
*   **Shape-Shifting Displays:** Interconnected modules create flexible, reconfigurable displays for dynamic content presentation (e.g., wearable information displays, adaptable signage).
*    **Personalized Interfaces:** Device learns user preferences, dynamically adjusting shape and haptic feedback for optimized interaction.
