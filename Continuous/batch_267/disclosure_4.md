## Adaptive Credential Lifecycles & Behavioral Analysis

**Specification:** Develop a system extending event-specific credential generation to incorporate real-time behavioral analysis of the resource instance executing the registered function. Instead of a fixed TTL (Time To Live) for credentials, introduce dynamic credential renewal or revocation based on observed behavior.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Monitoring Agent (BMA):** A lightweight agent deployed alongside the resource instance. This agent collects telemetry on resource usage (CPU, memory, network I/O), API call patterns, data access patterns, and any custom metrics emitted by the registered function.

2.  **Anomaly Detection Engine (ADE):** A machine learning model trained on baseline behavior of registered functions. This engine analyzes the telemetry stream from the BMA in real-time, identifying deviations from the established baseline.  Anomaly scores are generated based on the severity and frequency of deviations.

3.  **Credential Lifecycle Manager (CLM):** This component interfaces with the token service and the ADE. It receives anomaly scores from the ADE and adjusts the event-specific credential’s TTL accordingly. 

    *   **High Anomaly Score:** Shorten TTL, potentially revoking the credential and triggering an investigation.
    *   **Low Anomaly Score:** Extend TTL, allowing for longer-lived, more efficient access.
    *   **Moderate Anomaly Score:** Maintain current TTL, continue monitoring.

4.  **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate human-in-the-loop feedback. Security analysts can review flagged events and provide labels (e.g., “legitimate anomaly,” “false positive,” “malicious activity”). This data is used to retrain the ADE and improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (CLM Logic):**

```
function adjust_credential_ttl(event_id, anomaly_score, current_ttl):
  if anomaly_score > threshold_high:
    revoke_credential(event_id)
    log_event("High anomaly detected. Credential revoked.")
    return 0  // TTL = 0 (revoked)
  elif anomaly_score > threshold_moderate:
    new_ttl = current_ttl * 0.5 // Reduce TTL by 50%
    update_credential_ttl(event_id, new_ttl)
    log_event("Moderate anomaly detected. TTL reduced to " + new_ttl)
    return new_ttl
  elif anomaly_score < threshold_low:
    new_ttl = current_ttl * 2 // Extend TTL (max_ttl limit)
    update_credential_ttl(event_id, new_ttl)
    log_event("Low anomaly. TTL extended to " + new_ttl)
    return new_ttl
  else:
    return current_ttl // Maintain current TTL
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Resource instance executes registered function.
2.  BMA collects telemetry.
3.  Telemetry sent to ADE.
4.  ADE calculates anomaly score.
5.  Anomaly score sent to CLM.
6.  CLM adjusts credential TTL (or revokes credential).
7.  Token service updates credential.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Dynamic credential lifecycles reduce the window of opportunity for compromised credentials.
*   **Reduced Overhead:**  Extending TTL for well-behaved functions minimizes the frequency of token requests.
*   **Adaptive Security Posture:** The system adapts to changing threats and usage patterns.
*   **Proactive Threat Detection:** Anomaly detection can identify malicious activity before it causes significant damage.
