## Dynamic Interest Graph Construction & Predictive ‘Serendipity’ Engine

**Concept:** Expand the user-to-user matching beyond static affinity scores by dynamically constructing and evolving a ‘serendipity’ engine leveraging a multi-layered graph database. This goes beyond simply matching based on shared items; it predicts what a user *might* be interested in based on weak signals, evolving interests, and ‘adjacent’ affinities.

**Specs:**

**1. Graph Database Structure:**

*   **Node Types:**
    *   `User`: Represents individual users. Attributes: `UserID`, `EventHistory` (pointer to event data), `CurrentInterestVector`, `EvolvingInterestVector`, `SerendipityWeight`.
    *   `Item`: Represents items in the catalog. Attributes: `ItemID`, `ItemCategory`, `ItemTraits` (vector of characteristics – e.g., genre, author, mood, complexity), `ItemPopularity`.
    *   `Category`: Represents item categories. Attributes: `CategoryID`, `CategoryName`, `RelatedCategories`.
    *   `Trait`: Represents item traits. Attributes: `TraitID`, `TraitName`, `TraitWeight`.
    *   `Context`: Represents external contextual factors (time of day, location, current events). Attributes: `ContextID`, `ContextData`.
*   **Relationship Types:**
    *   `PURCHASED`: User -> Item
    *   `VIEWED`: User -> Item
    *   `RATED`: User -> Item
    *   `BELONGS_TO`: Item -> Category
    *   `HAS_TRAIT`: Item -> Trait
    *   `SIMILAR_TO`: Item -> Item (computed based on trait overlap)
    *   `INFLUENCED_BY`: User -> User (weak signal - e.g., user A often views items similar to those viewed by user B)
    *   `EXPOSED_TO`: User -> Context (User experienced a specific context)

**2. Data Ingestion & Processing Pipeline:**

*   **Event Stream:** Ingest real-time user event data (purchases, views, ratings, searches, browsing history).
*   **Feature Extraction:** Extract features from event data and item metadata. Generate `ItemTraits` vectors using NLP/ML on item descriptions and user reviews.
*   **Graph Population:** Populate the graph database with nodes and relationships based on extracted features.
*   **Dynamic Interest Vector Updates:** For each user:
    *   `CurrentInterestVector`: Weighted average of recently interacted-with items, emphasizing recent activity. Decay factor applied to older interactions.
    *   `EvolvingInterestVector`: Predictive vector based on a ‘random walk’ through the graph, starting from the `CurrentInterestVector`. Algorithm explores adjacent nodes (similar items, items viewed by similar users) with probabilities weighted by relationship strength and predicted user preference.
*   **Serendipity Weight Adjustment:** Users are assigned a `SerendipityWeight` indicating their openness to unexpected recommendations. This weight is dynamically adjusted based on user interaction with serendipitous recommendations (recommendations significantly different from their `CurrentInterestVector`).

**3. Recommendation Algorithm:**

1.  **Candidate Generation:** For a target user, generate a candidate set of items based on:
    *   Items similar to those in their `EvolvingInterestVector`.
    *   Items viewed by users ‘close’ to them in the graph (based on the `INFLUENCED_BY` relationship).
    *   Items associated with contexts the user has recently been exposed to.
2.  **Scoring:** Score each candidate item based on:
    *   Similarity to `EvolvingInterestVector`.
    *   Distance in the graph from the target user (shorter distance = higher score).
    *   Item `Popularity`.
    *   `SerendipityWeight` (higher weight = increased preference for diverse recommendations).
3.  **Ranking & Filtering:** Rank candidate items based on their score. Filter out items the user has already interacted with.
4.  **Recommendation Delivery:** Present the top-ranked items to the user.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Step):**

```
function recommend_items(user_id, num_recommendations):
  user = get_user(user_id)
  candidate_items = generate_candidate_items(user)
  scored_items = score_items(candidate_items, user)
  ranked_items = sort_items(scored_items, descending=True)
  recommendations = top_n(ranked_items, num_recommendations)
  return recommendations

function generate_candidate_items(user):
  candidates = []
  # Explore items similar to EvolvingInterestVector
  candidates.extend(get_similar_items(user.EvolvingInterestVector))
  # Explore items viewed by influenced users
  influenced_users = get_influenced_users(user)
  for influenced_user in influenced_users:
    candidates.extend(get_viewed_items(influenced_user))
  # Explore items associated with recent contexts
  recent_contexts = get_recent_contexts(user)
  for context in recent_contexts:
    candidates.extend(get_items_associated_with_context(context))
  return candidates
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simple collaborative filtering by modeling *evolving* user interests and proactively exploring adjacent affinities. The dynamic graph structure allows for more nuanced and serendipitous recommendations, potentially discovering interests the user didn’t even know they had.  The system explicitly incorporates contextual factors for more relevant recommendations.
