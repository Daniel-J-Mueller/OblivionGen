## Adaptive Intent Prioritization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Augment the system’s intent prioritization not just with usage data (as suggested in some claims), but with real-time biofeedback from the user to dynamically adjust which application responds to ambiguous or overlapping intents.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:** Interface with one or more readily available biofeedback sensors (e.g., heart rate variability (HRV) monitor, galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor, EEG headband). API for sensor data ingestion. Support for multiple sensor modalities.
*   **Wearable Compatibility:**  Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity for seamless integration with common wearable devices.
*   **Signal Processing Unit:**  On-device or cloud-based unit to filter, normalize, and process raw biofeedback data.  Real-time processing capability is critical.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Data Pipeline:**
    *   Raw sensor data ingestion.
    *   Noise filtering and artifact removal.
    *   Feature extraction (e.g., HRV metrics, GSR peak detection, EEG band power).
    *   Data normalization and scaling.
*   **Intent-Biofeedback Correlation Engine:**
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., neural network, support vector machine) trained to correlate specific biofeedback patterns with user preferences for different applications given a particular intent. Training data will be generated through implicit feedback (application selection) and potentially explicit feedback (user ratings).
    *   Real-time prediction of user preference given current intent and biofeedback data.
*   **Dynamic Intent Prioritization Module:**
    *   Integrates predicted user preference from the Intent-Biofeedback Correlation Engine into the existing intent prioritization algorithm.  
    *   Adjusts the probability weight assigned to each application based on the predicted preference.
*   **Calibration & Training Interface:**
    *   Guided calibration process for each user to establish baseline biofeedback patterns.
    *   Continuous learning mechanism to refine the correlation model over time.
    *   User interface to review and adjust calibration settings.
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Clear user controls to enable/disable biofeedback integration and manage data sharing.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  User initiates a voice command.
2.  Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) generates text data.
3.  Natural Language Understanding (NLU) identifies the user’s intent.
4.  If multiple applications are capable of handling the intent, the Dynamic Intent Prioritization Module is activated.
5.  Real-time biofeedback data is collected from the user’s wearable device.
6.  The Intent-Biofeedback Correlation Engine predicts the user’s preference for each application based on the biofeedback data and the identified intent.
7.  The Dynamic Intent Prioritization Module adjusts the probability weight assigned to each application based on the predicted preference.
8.  The application with the highest probability weight is selected and activated.
9.  System logs user interaction (application selection) as implicit feedback to continuously refine the Intent-Biofeedback Correlation Engine.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Intent Prioritization Module):**

```
function prioritizeApplications(intent, applicationList, biofeedbackData) {
  // Get predicted user preference scores for each application
  preferenceScores = IntentBiofeedbackCorrelationEngine.predict(intent, biofeedbackData);

  // Calculate weighted scores for each application
  weightedScores = [];
  for each application in applicationList {
    weightedScore = (basePriorityScore * 0.7) + (preferenceScores[application] * 0.3);
    weightedScores.push(weightedScore);
  }

  // Select the application with the highest weighted score
  selectedApplication = applicationList[argmax(weightedScores)];

  return selectedApplication;
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems prioritize based on usage history and registration data. This approach adds a real-time physiological dimension, potentially allowing for more accurate and personalized intent resolution, *even when the user’s stated or implied preferences are ambiguous*. It allows the system to anticipate the user's needs based on *how they are feeling* at the moment of interaction, rather than just *what they have done in the past*.
