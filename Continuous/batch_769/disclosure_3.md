## Adaptive Block Granularity & Predictive Restoration

**Concept:** Extend the tree-based restoration by dynamically adjusting block granularity based on data change frequency *and* proactively pre-restoring blocks predicted to be needed. This is coupled with a tiered snapshot system.

**Specification:**

**1. Tiered Snapshot System:**

*   **Tier 0 (Fast):** Frequent, small differential snapshots (every few minutes). Stores only changed blocks. Uses delta compression. Resides on fast local storage.
*   **Tier 1 (Medium):** Hourly full or incremental snapshots. Stores larger blocks. Moderate compression. Resides on moderately fast local/network storage.
*   **Tier 2 (Archive):** Daily/Weekly full snapshots. High compression. Resides on archival storage (cloud, tape).

**2. Dynamic Block Granularity:**

*   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor data block change frequency.
*   **Granularity Adjustment:**
    *   High change rate blocks: Split into smaller sub-blocks. This limits the amount of data restored when a small change occurs.
    *   Low change rate blocks: Merge into larger blocks. Reduces metadata overhead and restoration time for stable data.
    *   Granularity is adjusted *before* snapshot creation, embedding information in snapshot metadata.
*   **Metadata:** Each block/sub-block contains metadata indicating its current granularity level and parent/child relationships.

**3. Predictive Restoration Engine:**

*   **Usage Analysis:** Analyze application I/O patterns (read/write access) to predict future data access.
*   **Pre-Restoration Queue:**  Based on predicted access, a queue of blocks is created for pre-restoration.
*   **Background Restoration:** Blocks in the queue are restored in the background, prioritized by prediction confidence and access time.
*   **Integration with Tree Structure:**  Utilize the existing tree structure to efficiently restore pre-fetched blocks and their dependencies.  If a block is already restored (due to pre-fetch), it's skipped.

**4. Restoration Process:**

1.  Receive request for a local block.
2.  Check if block is already restored. If so, serve request.
3.  If not restored:
    *   Determine granularity of the requested block.
    *   Compute restore block list, *including all sub-blocks at the current granularity*.
    *   Traverse the tree, fingerprinting and restoring blocks as needed.
    *   Serve request.
4.  Predictive Restoration Engine continually operates in the background, populating the restoration queue.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Restoration Component):**

```
function predict_next_blocks(access_history, prediction_window):
  // Analyze access history to identify frequently accessed blocks
  // and predict future access based on patterns.
  predicted_blocks = []
  // (complex prediction algorithm here â€“ e.g., Markov chains, neural networks)
  return predicted_blocks

function background_restore(restoration_queue):
  while restoration_queue is not empty:
    block = restoration_queue.pop(0)
    if block is not already restored:
      restore_block(block)

function restore_block(block):
  // Use existing tree-based restoration logic
  // (compute restore block list, fingerprint, retrieve from snapshot, write to local block)
  pass
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-speed storage tiers (NVMe SSDs) for Tier 0 and potentially Tier 1.
*   Scalable storage infrastructure for archival snapshots (cloud storage, object storage).
*   Real-time I/O monitoring agent.
*   Machine learning libraries for usage pattern analysis.
*   Integration with existing storage gateway and data protection systems.
