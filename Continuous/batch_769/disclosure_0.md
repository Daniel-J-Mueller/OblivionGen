## Adaptive Request Shadowing with Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the staged deployment concept to include *predictive* rollback based on real-time anomaly detection *within* the shadowed request flow, not just aggregate performance metrics. This creates a system where problematic configurations are identified and reverted *before* impacting a significant number of users.

**Specifications:**

**1. Request Shadowing Enhancement:**

   *   **Shadowed Request Duplication:**  Duplicate a configurable percentage of incoming requests. One copy is processed using the current production configuration (baseline). The other copy is processed using the experimental configuration.
   *   **Differential Analysis:** Implement a detailed differential analysis between the baseline and experimental request processing. This goes beyond simple latency comparison. Analyze:
        *   **Data Transformations:** Track changes in data values as they flow through each configuration.
        *   **Internal State:** Monitor the internal state of services (e.g., cache hit ratios, queue lengths) for discrepancies.
        *   **Error Rates:** Capture and categorize errors generated by each configuration.
   *   **Anomaly Detection Engine:**  Employ a machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder, Isolation Forest) trained on historical request/response patterns and service behavior. This engine detects anomalies in the differential analysis data.  Focus on identifying *unexpected* changes, not just deviations from average performance.

**2. Predictive Rollback Mechanism:**

   *   **Rollback Trigger:**  Define configurable anomaly thresholds.  When an anomaly exceeds a threshold, initiate a rollback *for the specific request* being processed, *not* a global rollback.
   *   **Request Redirection:**  If rollback is triggered, redirect the experimental request copy back to the baseline configuration *before* it completes.  The original request (processed by the baseline) continues as normal.
   *   **Shadowed Rollback Data:** Capture detailed information about the rolled-back request (request payload, anomaly details, service state).  This data is used for debugging and retraining the anomaly detection model.

**3.  Dynamic Shadowing Percentage:**

   *   **Adaptive Sampling:**  Adjust the shadowing percentage dynamically based on the stability of the experimental configuration.
        *   **Low Anomaly Rate:** Decrease shadowing percentage to reduce overhead.
        *   **High Anomaly Rate:** Increase shadowing percentage for more comprehensive anomaly detection.
   *   **Feedback Loop:** Use the anomaly rate and rollback frequency as inputs to an algorithm that optimizes the shadowing percentage.

**4.  Implementation Details:**

   *   **Request Tagging:**  Assign a unique identifier to each request (and its shadow copy) to track it throughout the system.
   *   **Side-by-Side Execution:**  Run the baseline and experimental configurations in parallel within the same host or in separate containers.
   *   **Telemetry Collection:**  Gather detailed telemetry data from both configurations, including request/response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
   *   **Centralized Monitoring:**  Visualize the telemetry data and anomaly alerts in a centralized monitoring dashboard.

**Pseudocode (Rollback Logic):**

```
function processRequest(request):
  requestID = generateUniqueID(request)
  baselineResponse = processRequestBaseline(request, requestID)
  experimentalResponse = processRequestExperimental(request, requestID)

  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(experimentalResponse, baselineResponse)

  if anomalyScore > anomalyThreshold:
    logRollback(requestID, anomalyScore)
    # Redirect experimental request to baseline (implementation detail)
    experimentalResponse = baselineResponse
  else:
    logSuccessfulExperimentalProcessing(requestID)

  return experimentalResponse
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Blast Radius:** Minimize the impact of faulty configurations by identifying and reverting problematic requests before they reach users.
*   **Proactive Issue Detection:** Identify subtle anomalies that might not be apparent from aggregate performance metrics.
*   **Faster Rollbacks:**  Rollback individual requests in real-time, rather than waiting for aggregate metrics to trigger a global rollback.
*   **Improved Configuration Validation:** Gain more confidence in the stability and reliability of new configurations.
