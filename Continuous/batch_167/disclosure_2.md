## Modular Tray System with Integrated Environmental Control

**Concept:** A tray system utilizing interlocking, geometrically diverse modules capable of independent temperature and humidity control within each module. This allows for simultaneous preservation of vastly different goods within a single carrying case or display.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Geometry:** Modules will be based on a truncated octahedron (allowing for near-spherical packing efficiency) but with adaptable facet sizes. Facet sizes range from 2cm x 2cm to 10cm x 10cm to accommodate various item sizes.
*   **Interlocking Mechanism:** Modules connect via magnetic latches embedded within the faceted edges. Latches possess a shear-resistant design to prevent accidental disconnections during transport.
*   **Material:** Module bodies constructed from a high-density, food-grade polypropylene with integrated microchannels for fluid circulation.  Black carbon fiber reinforcement in high-stress areas.
*   **Environmental Control:** Each module contains:
    *   **Micro Peltier Element:**  A miniature Peltier device (approx. 1cm x 1cm) bonded to the base of each module facet. Controls temperature.
    *   **Micro Humidity Sensor & Actuator:** Integrated humidity sensor measures internal humidity. A micro-pump controls the release/absorption of moisture via a desiccant reservoir.
    *   **Wireless Communication:** Each module features a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module for remote monitoring and control via a dedicated mobile application.
    *   **Power:** Modules are powered by a central rechargeable battery pack housed within a base unit.  Wireless power transfer to individual modules.
*   **Base Unit:**
    *   Contains the rechargeable battery, power management circuitry, and central processing unit (CPU).
    *   Features a touchscreen display for system monitoring and control.
    *   Houses inductive charging coils for wireless power transfer.
*   **Software:**
    *   Mobile application allows users to:
        *   Monitor temperature and humidity levels in each module.
        *   Set target temperature and humidity levels.
        *   Create and save pre-defined environmental profiles for different goods (e.g., "wine," "chocolate," "cheese").
        *   Receive alerts if environmental conditions deviate from the set parameters.
* **Fluidic Control System:**
    *   Microchannels embedded in the module walls facilitate even temperature distribution.
    *   Closed-loop control system regulates fluid flow based on sensor readings and user settings.
    *   Utilizes a biocompatible, non-toxic heat transfer fluid.

**Pseudocode (Module Control Logic):**

```
// Module Initialization
sensor = HumiditySensor()
peltier = PeltierElement()
targetTemp = 20.0  // Default target temperature
targetHumidity = 50.0 // Default target humidity

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  currentTemp = sensor.readTemperature()
  currentHumidity = sensor.readHumidity()

  tempDiff = targetTemp - currentTemp
  humidityDiff = targetHumidity - currentHumidity

  if (abs(tempDiff) > 0.5) {
    peltier.setPower(tempDiff * 0.1) // Adjust power based on difference
  } else {
    peltier.setPower(0)
  }

  if (humidityDiff > 2) {
    actuator.releaseMoisture(0.1) // Release moisture slowly
  } else if (humidityDiff < -2) {
    actuator.absorbMoisture(0.1) // Absorb moisture slowly
  }

  // Transmit data to base unit
  transmitData(currentTemp, currentHumidity)

  delay(100ms)
}
```
