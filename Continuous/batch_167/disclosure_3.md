## Dynamic Reward Tiering & Gamified Price Scouting

**System Overview:** Expand the crowd-sourced pricing model to incorporate a dynamic reward tiering system and gamified scouting challenges, fostering increased user engagement and more accurate real-time price validation.

**Core Components:**

*   **User Profiles & Tiered Rewards:** Each user maintains a profile tracking contribution quality (price accuracy, scouting frequency, item diversity) and quantity. Tiers (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond) unlock increasingly valuable rewards – discounts on items, priority access to deals, exclusive product previews, or virtual currency redeemable within a partnered marketplace.
*   **Scouting Challenges:** Introduce time-limited "scouting challenges" focused on specific product categories or merchants. Challenges present users with a list of items to scout, with rewards based on completion speed, accuracy, and the number of verified price submissions.
*   **"Price Battle" Mode:** Implement a real-time "Price Battle" mode where users compete to submit the most accurate price for a given item within a limited timeframe. The top performers earn bonus rewards and leaderboard recognition.
*   **"Item Bounty" System:** Allow merchants to post "item bounties" – rewards offered for verified prices on hard-to-find or rapidly changing items. This incentivizes users to focus on high-value scouting tasks.
*   **AI-Assisted Price Validation:** Integrate an AI model trained to identify potentially inaccurate or fraudulent price submissions. Flagged submissions are subject to manual review or further validation by a network of trusted "verifier" users (users with high reputation scores).

**Pseudocode - Scouting Challenge Workflow**

```
FUNCTION StartScoutingChallenge(category, merchant, duration, reward)

    challenge_id = GENERATE_UNIQUE_ID()
    challenge_data = {
        "id": challenge_id,
        "category": category,
        "merchant": merchant,
        "duration": duration,
        "reward": reward,
        "items": SELECT_ITEMS_FROM_CATEGORY(category) // Randomly select items
    }

    PUSH_NOTIFICATION_TO_USERS(challenge_data)

    START_TIMER(duration)

    WHILE TIMER_RUNNING()
        RECEIVE_PRICE_SUBMISSIONS(user_id, item_id, price)

        VALIDATE_PRICE(price, item_id) //Basic validation

        IF PRICE_VALIDATED
           ADD_POINTS_TO_USER(user_id, points_per_valid_submission)

        END IF

    END WHILE

    DETERMINE_WINNERS(challenge_id) //Based on points earned
    DISTRIBUTE_REWARDS(winners, reward)

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION DETERMINE_WINNERS(challenge_id)
    scores = QUERY_SCORES_FOR_CHALLENGE(challenge_id)
    sorted_scores = SORT_SCORES_DESCENDING(scores)
    top_n_scores = SELECT_TOP_N_SCORES(sorted_scores, number_of_winners)

    RETURN top_n_scores
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **User Profile:** {user\_id, tier, points, reputation, verified\_submissions}
*   **Challenge:** {challenge\_id, category, merchant, duration, reward, items}
*   **Price Submission:** {submission\_id, user\_id, item\_id, price, timestamp}

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Scalable cloud infrastructure for data storage and processing.
*   Mobile app SDK for price submission and challenge participation.
*   AI/ML model for price validation and fraud detection.
*   Real-time communication infrastructure for challenge updates and notifications.
*   API integration with partnered marketplaces and merchants.
