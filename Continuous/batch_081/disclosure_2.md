## Adaptive Communication Zones

**Concept:** Expand the restricted communication concept to create dynamically defined "communication zones" based on location, time, and user activity, moving beyond simple user-defined contact lists. This allows for layered communication permissions, ensuring the right people are notified at the right time, minimizing disruption while maximizing relevance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Zone Definition Module:**

   *   **Input:** Location data (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons), Time, User Activity (derived from device sensors - movement, audio levels, app usage), User-Defined Parameters (e.g., “Family Dinner Time”, “Work Hours”).
   *   **Processing:** Algorithm to create and dynamically adjust communication zones. Zones can overlap.  Zone parameters are stored as a rule-set: `IF location = X AND time = Y AND activity = Z THEN zone = A`.
   *   **Output:** Zone ID, Zone parameters.

**2. Communication Policy Engine:**

   *   **Input:** User ID, Communication Request (voice, text, video), Zone ID (derived from the originating user's current location/time/activity).
   *   **Processing:**  Policy rules define communication permissions based on user relationships and the current zone. 
        *   Rules are hierarchical:  Global rules (always apply), Zone-specific rules (override global rules within the zone), User-Specific rules.
        *   Example Rule: `IF user = Child AND zone = "School" AND communication_type = "Call" THEN deny`.  `IF user = Child AND zone = "Home" AND communication_type = "Call" AND caller IN [Parent, Sibling] THEN allow`.
   *   **Output:**  Allow/Deny signal,  Communication Routing instructions (e.g. send to voicemail, forward to designated contact, suppress notification).

**3. Contextual Awareness Module:**

   *   **Input:**  Device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, camera), App Usage data, Calendar data.
   *   **Processing:**  AI algorithms to infer user activity and context.  Example:  Detecting a "Meeting" based on calendar events, audio levels, and lack of movement.  Identifying "Driving" based on accelerometer data and GPS speed.
   *   **Output:**  Contextual tags (e.g., “In Meeting”, “Driving”, “Sleeping”), Confidence Level.

**4.  Adaptive Notification System:**

   *   **Input:**  Communication Request, Policy Engine output, Contextual Awareness output.
   *   **Processing:**  Dynamically adjust notification delivery based on the user's context.
        *   Prioritize urgent communications.
        *   Suppress non-urgent notifications during meetings or while driving.
        *   Deliver notifications through the most appropriate channel (e.g. vibration during a meeting, audible alert when stationary).
   *   **Output:**  Notification Delivery Instructions.

**Pseudocode (Communication Policy Engine):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(user, request, zone):
  globalRules = getGlobalRules()
  zoneRules = getZoneRules(zone)
  userRules = getUserRules(user)

  // Apply rules in order of precedence
  if (globalRules.deny(request)):
    return Deny
  if (zoneRules.deny(request)):
    return Deny
  if (userRules.deny(request)):
    return Deny

  // If no rules deny the request, allow it
  return Allow
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPS Module
*   Accelerometer
*   Microphone
*   Sufficient processing power for AI algorithms

**Software Requirements:**

*   Operating System with Sensor Access
*   AI/Machine Learning Framework
*   Rule Engine
*   Communication Protocols (VoIP, SMS, etc.)
