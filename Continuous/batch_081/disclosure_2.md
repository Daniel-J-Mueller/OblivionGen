## Secure Multi-Device Orchestration via Temporal Keys

**Concept:** Expand the authentication identifier concept beyond simple device association. Introduce a time-limited, dynamically generated "Temporal Key" system for granular permission control across multiple devices, building on the existing QR code transmission method. This goes beyond simply *allowing* a device access; it dictates *what* access it has, and for *how long*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Key Generation & Association:**

*   The authentication service generates a Temporal Key (TK) alongside the authentication identifier. The TK is a cryptographically secure random string, versioned and time-stamped.
*   The TK is not tied directly to the device access token, but to a specific *permission set*. This permission set defines precisely what resources/services the associated device is authorized to access (e.g., read-only access to specific data, ability to trigger certain functions).
*   The TK, alongside the authentication identifier, is encoded into the QR code presented by the first (authenticated) client device.
*   The service maintains a "Temporal Key Registry" (TKR) mapping TKs to:
    *   User account
    *   Associated permission set
    *   Expiration timestamp
    *   Device identifier (of the originating device that created the TK)

**2. Second Device Acquisition & Validation:**

*   The second client device scans the QR code, acquiring both the authentication identifier and the TK.
*   The second client device sends *both* to the authentication service.
*   The authentication service validates:
    *   The authentication identifier is valid.
    *   The TK exists in the TKR.
    *   The TK is not expired.
    *   The originating device (from TKR) has permission to *delegate* this access level. (Adds a delegation layer - prevents a compromised device from granting excessive access.)
*   Upon successful validation, a *limited-scope* device access token is issued to the second device. This token is specifically constrained by the permissions defined in the TKR for the validated TK.

**3.  Dynamic Permission Adjustment & Revocation:**

*   The authentication service provides an API for the user to:
    *   Modify the permission set associated with an existing TK *before* it expires.
    *   Revoke a TK immediately, invalidating all associated limited-scope tokens.
*   An optional "Trusted Device" list allows certain devices to automatically receive extended expiration times or broader permission sets.

**Pseudocode (Second Device Workflow):**

```
function scanQRCode() {
  qrData = scanQRCode(); // Returns { authID, temporalKey }
  authID = qrData.authID;
  temporalKey = qrData.temporalKey;

  sendAuthRequest(authID, temporalKey);
}

function sendAuthRequest(authID, temporalKey) {
  requestData = {
    authID: authID,
    temporalKey: temporalKey
  };

  authenticationService.validateAuth(requestData)
  .then(response => {
    if (response.success) {
      limitedScopeToken = response.token;
      // Use limitedScopeToken to access authorized services
    } else {
      // Handle authentication failure
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle network or service errors
  });
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Biometric Integration:** Require biometric authentication on the second device *after* QR code scan for added security.
*   **Geofencing:** Restrict the validity of a TK to a specific geographic location.
*   **Multi-Factor Temporal Keys:** Require multiple temporal keys (from different authenticated devices) to unlock access to highly sensitive resources.
*   **"Burn After Reading" Keys:**  Temporal Keys designed to self-destruct after a single use.
