**Temporal Data Object Provenance & Drift Detection**

**Concept:** Extend the data object resolution system to incorporate temporal data provenance tracking and drift detection. The current patent focuses on *similarity* at a given point in time. This builds on that by tracking changes *over time* and identifying discrepancies arising from data drift or corruption.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Object Provenance Layer:** Each data object will have an associated provenance record. This record will store:
    *   `object_id`: Unique identifier for the data object.
    *   `creation_timestamp`: When the object was initially created.
    *   `source_system`: Originating system of the data.
    *   `transformations`: A list of all transformations applied to the data, including the applying system and timestamp. (e.g., `[{system: "ETL Pipeline", timestamp: "2024-10-27T10:00:00Z", transformation_type: "Address Standardization"}]`)
    *   `current_state_hash`: A cryptographic hash of the object's current data.

2.  **Temporal Comparison Engine:** Modified comparison logic. Instead of a single similarity score, calculate:
    *   `similarity_over_time`: A time series representing the similarity score between the source and existing data objects at various points in the past. This will be computed by replaying transformations on historical snapshots of the existing data object and comparing to the source data object.
    *   `drift_score`: A measure of how much the similarity score has changed over time.  Calculated as the standard deviation of the `similarity_over_time` series.
    *   `anomaly_detection`: Implement statistical anomaly detection (e.g., using z-scores or moving averages) on the `similarity_over_time` series to identify sudden changes or deviations.

3.  **Data Reconstruction Module:** If significant drift or anomalies are detected, the system will attempt to reconstruct the historical data object state to pinpoint the source of the discrepancy.

4.  **Workflow Integration:**
    *   **Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Integrate the provenance tracking module into the data ingestion pipeline to automatically capture data lineage information.
    *   **Monitoring Dashboard:** Create a dashboard to visualize data drift, anomaly scores, and data lineage information.
    *   **Alerting System:** Configure alerts to notify stakeholders when significant data drift or anomalies are detected.

**Pseudocode (Drift Detection):**

```
function detect_drift(source_object, existing_object, historical_snapshots):
    similarity_over_time = []
    for snapshot in historical_snapshots:
        // Replay transformations on snapshot to get current state
        reconstructed_object = apply_transformations(snapshot, transformations)
        similarity_score = calculate_similarity(source_object, reconstructed_object)
        similarity_over_time.append(similarity_score)

    drift_score = standard_deviation(similarity_over_time)
    anomalies = detect_anomalies(similarity_over_time)

    return drift_score, anomalies
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Snapshot Management:** Implement a strategy for managing historical data snapshots (e.g., incremental snapshots, compression).
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle large volumes of data and historical snapshots.
*   **Security:** Protect sensitive data and ensure data integrity.
*   **Version Control:** Use version control for data transformations.
