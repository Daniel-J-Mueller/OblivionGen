## Dynamic Keyphrase Embedding with Contextual Anchoring

**Concept:** Augment keyphrase extraction with a dynamic embedding space, anchored to real-time contextual information. This moves beyond static word/character features to incorporate external knowledge and current trends.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Ingestion Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** API connections to news feeds (e.g., Google News, NewsAPI), social media trends (Twitter API, Reddit API), and knowledge graphs (Wikidata, DBpedia).
*   **Real-time Updates:**  Data ingested every 5-15 minutes (configurable).
*   **Filtering:**  Configurable filters to restrict ingestion to specific topics, industries, or geographic regions.

**2. Contextual Embedding Generator:**

*   **Model:** Transformer-based language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa, XLNet) fine-tuned on a corpus of contextual data.
*   **Input:**  Aggregated contextual data (news headlines, social media posts, knowledge graph triples).
*   **Output:**  Contextual embedding vector representing the current state of the knowledge landscape.

**3. Hybrid Feature Integration:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Word-level features (from the existing patent).
    *   Character-level features (from the existing patent).
    *   Contextual Embedding Vector (from Step 2).
*   **Concatenation/Fusion:**  Combine the feature vectors using a learned weighting scheme (e.g., attention mechanism).

**4. Keyphrase Scoring & Ranking:**

*   **Model:**  Sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) with an attention mechanism.
*   **Input:** Integrated feature vector (from Step 3).
*   **Output:**  Probability score for each potential keyphrase.
*   **Ranking:**  Keyphrases are ranked based on their probability scores.

**5. Dynamic Embedding Space Update:**

*   **Online Learning:**  Continuously update the embedding space using a reinforcement learning agent.
*   **Reward Function:**  Reward the agent for extracting keyphrases that are:
    *   Relevant to the document.
    *   Representative of the current context.
    *   Novel (not already frequently used).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function extract_keyphrases(document, context_data):

  word_features = extract_word_features(document)
  char_features = extract_char_features(document)
  context_embedding = generate_context_embedding(context_data)

  integrated_features = concatenate(word_features, char_features, context_embedding)

  keyphrase_scores = score_keyphrases(integrated_features)

  ranked_keyphrases = sort(keyphrase_scores, descending=True)

  return ranked_keyphrases
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for model training and inference.
*   Sufficient memory to store large language models and contextual data.
*   Fast network connectivity for real-time data ingestion.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time news analysis and topic detection.
*   Dynamic advertisement targeting.
*   Adaptive content recommendation.
*   Trend monitoring and forecasting.
*   Summarization of evolving information landscapes.
