## Dynamic Feature Weighting via Bayesian Optimization

**Concept:** The patent details a method of iterative imputation and model training. This inspires a system that dynamically adjusts the weight of features *during* the imputation/training process, prioritizing features that demonstrate the greatest impact on reducing imputation error. This goes beyond simple feature selection and aims for a continuous, adaptive weighting.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Input:** A dataset with missing values, a predictive model architecture (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network), and initial feature weights (all features initially assigned a weight of 1.0).
2.  **Imputation Engine:** A standard imputation procedure (mean, median, k-NN, or model-based as described in the patent) is used, but *weighted* by the current feature weights.  For example, if calculating a weighted mean, the contribution of each non-missing value for a feature would be multiplied by the feature's weight.
3.  **Error Metric:**  A metric to quantify imputation error. Options include Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on held-out data or a custom metric tailored to the dataset's characteristics.
4.  **Bayesian Optimization Loop:**
    *   **Define Search Space:** The search space consists of the feature weights. Each feature weight is a parameter to be optimized, with bounds (e.g., 0.1 to 2.0).
    *   **Surrogate Model:**  A Gaussian Process (GP) or similar surrogate model learns the relationship between feature weights and the error metric.
    *   **Acquisition Function:**  An acquisition function (e.g., Expected Improvement, Upper Confidence Bound) guides the search for the next set of feature weights to evaluate.
    *   **Evaluation:**  The imputation engine and predictive model are trained and evaluated with the new feature weights. The error metric is calculated.
    *   **Update Surrogate Model:** The surrogate model is updated with the new results.
    *   **Iteration:** The loop repeats for a fixed number of iterations or until convergence.

5.  **Model Training:** Once the Bayesian optimization loop completes, the predictive model is trained using the dataset imputed with the final weighted feature values.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: dataset, model_architecture, initial_weights (all 1.0)

// Initialize Bayesian Optimization
bo = BayesianOptimizer(
    search_space = {feature_1: [0.1, 2.0], feature_2: [0.1, 2.0], ...},
    surrogate_model = GaussianProcess(),
    acquisition_function = ExpectedImprovement()
)

for iteration in range(num_iterations):
    # Propose new feature weights
    weights = bo.suggest_weights()

    # Impute missing values using weighted features
    imputed_dataset = impute(dataset, weights)

    # Train predictive model
    model = train(imputed_dataset, model_architecture)

    # Evaluate model
    error = evaluate(model, test_data)

    # Update Bayesian Optimization model
    bo.update(weights, error)

# Final model training with optimized weights
final_imputed_dataset = impute(dataset, bo.best_weights)
final_model = train(final_imputed_dataset, model_architecture)

return final_model
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Python with libraries such as Scikit-learn, GPy (for Gaussian Processes), and a chosen machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Sufficient computational resources to train and evaluate the predictive model multiple times during the Bayesian optimization loop.
*   GPU acceleration is recommended for large datasets and complex models.
