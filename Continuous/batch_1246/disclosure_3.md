## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Audio "Bubbles"

**Concept:** Extend the synchronization tech to not just *align* audio sources, but to *reconstruct* an acoustic scene, then create personalized audio "bubbles" within that scene, effectively isolating or prioritizing sounds for individual listeners.

**Specs:**

**1. Multi-Microphone Array & Spatial Audio Capture:**

*   **Hardware:** Deploy a dense array of MEMS microphones (minimum 8, optimally 16+) integrated into a wearable device (headphones, glasses, necklace, or room-based unit).  Microphone placement will be non-coplanar to maximize 3D spatial resolution.
*   **Calibration:** Implement a self-calibration routine utilizing known sound sources (built-in test tones or detected ambient sounds) to determine precise microphone positions and time-of-flight characteristics.
*   **Data Acquisition:**  Synchronized, high-sample-rate (minimum 96kHz) audio capture from all microphones. 24-bit depth.
*   **Processing:** Utilize beamforming and time-delay estimation (TDE) algorithms to pinpoint sound source locations in 3D space. Implement noise reduction techniques (adaptive filtering, spectral subtraction) tailored to the captured environment.

**2. Acoustic Scene Reconstruction:**

*   **Sound Source Mapping:**  Create a dynamic 3D map of detected sound sources. Each source will be represented by a cluster of spatial audio data (location, intensity, frequency characteristics).
*   **Persistent Scene Modeling:** Maintain a persistent model of the acoustic environment, incorporating reflections, reverberation, and ambient noise. Utilize ray tracing or similar techniques to simulate sound propagation.  A Kalman Filter or particle filter will track sound source movement.
*   **Sound Source Identification:** Integrate machine learning models to classify detected sound sources (speech, music, vehicle noise, environmental sounds).  Train models on a diverse dataset of labeled audio recordings.
*   **Semantic Labelling:**  Attach semantic labels to identified sound sources (e.g., "person speaking," "car horn," "birdsong").

**3. Personalized Audio "Bubbles":**

*   **User Profile:** Define user profiles with preferences for audio prioritization (e.g., prioritize speech in noisy environments, suppress certain sound types).
*   **Bubble Creation:** Define a virtual "bubble" around the user's head.  This bubble will be a 3D volume where audio processing is applied.
*   **Sound Masking/Enhancement:**  Apply targeted audio processing to sounds within the bubble:
    *   **Selective Masking:** Attenuate unwanted sounds (e.g., background noise, distracting chatter).
    *   **Speech Enhancement:** Boost the clarity and intelligibility of speech.
    *   **Sound Isolation:** Create a perceived isolation from certain sound sources.
    *   **Spatial Audio Remapping:**  Adjust the perceived location of sound sources within the bubble.  For example, emphasize sounds from a specific direction or create a "virtual surround sound" experience.
*   **Real-Time Processing:**  Implement all audio processing in real-time to minimize latency and ensure a seamless experience.

**4.  Synchronization & Hand-Off**

*   **Multi-Device Synchronization:** If multiple users are present, synchronize acoustic scene reconstructions across devices to maintain consistent audio experiences.
*   **Device Hand-Off:**  Smoothly transition audio processing between devices as the user moves around.
*   **Source Prioritization:** Utilize the synchronization tech to give priority to the closest audio source. This will alleviate 'ghosting' or 'overlapping' sounds.

**Pseudocode (Bubble Creation & Audio Processing):**

```
function CreateAudioBubble(userProfile, acousticScene):
  bubbleRadius = userProfile.bubbleRadius
  centerPoint = userProfile.headPosition

  for soundSource in acousticScene.soundSources:
    distance = CalculateDistance(soundSource.position, centerPoint)

    if distance <= bubbleRadius:
      if userProfile.prioritizeSpeech and soundSource.label == "speech":
        ApplySpeechEnhancement(soundSource)
      else if userProfile.suppressNoise and soundSource.label == "noise":
        ApplyNoiseSuppression(soundSource)
      else:
        ApplySpatialAudioRemapping(soundSource, userProfile.preferences)

  return processedAcousticScene
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced communication in noisy environments.
*   Improved accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.
*   Immersive gaming and virtual reality experiences.
*   Personalized audio experiences in public spaces.
*   Advanced conferencing/collaboration solutions.
