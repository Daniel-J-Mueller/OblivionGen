## Dynamic Contextual Keyword Expansion via Temporal Data

**Concept:** Expand keyword targeting not just through phrase analysis of existing documents, but by incorporating *temporal* data associated with search queries and content. This allows for anticipation of trending keywords *before* they become widespread, creating a predictive advertising system.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   **Real-time Search Query Stream:** Access to anonymized, aggregated search query data (e.g., from a search engine API – with appropriate privacy safeguards).
    *   **Content Publication Timestamps:** Metadata indicating when content (articles, blog posts, product releases, etc.) relating to the advertised item was first published online.
    *   **Social Media Trend Data:** API access to social media platforms to track emerging hashtags, keywords, and topics.
2.  **Temporal Keyword Weighting:**
    *   For each identified keyword (using the patent's frequency analysis), assign a ‘Temporal Relevance Score’ (TRS).
    *   TRS Calculation:
        *   `Base Score = Frequency Score` (from the original patent).
        *   `Trend Factor = (Current Query Volume / Historical Average Query Volume) for the keyword`.
        *   `Recency Bonus =  1 / (Time Since First Content Publication relating to the keyword)`.
        *   `TRS = Base Score * Trend Factor * Recency Bonus`.
3.  **Predictive Phrase Generation:**
    *   Identify ‘Rising Phrases’ – combinations of keywords with rapidly increasing TRS.
    *   Utilize a ‘Temporal Markov Chain’ to predict the *next* likely keyword in a phrase, based on historical sequence data *and* current trend data.  This moves beyond simple co-occurrence analysis.
4.  **Keyword Auction Bidding Strategy:**
    *   Dynamically adjust bid prices for keywords in real-time, based on TRS and predicted competition (using a separate machine learning model).
    *   Prioritize bidding on Rising Phrases, even if current search volume is low, anticipating future demand.
5.  **System Architecture:**
    *   **Data Pipeline:** Real-time data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation.
    *   **Keyword Scoring Engine:** Calculates TRS and identifies Rising Phrases.
    *   **Bidding Strategy Engine:**  Automates bid price adjustments.
    *   **API Integration:**  Connection to search engine advertising platforms.
6.  **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION calculate_temporal_relevance_score(keyword, current_query_volume, historical_average_volume, time_since_publication, frequency_score):
  trend_factor = current_query_volume / historical_average_volume
  recency_bonus = 1 / time_since_publication
  temporal_relevance_score = frequency_score * trend_factor * recency_bonus
  RETURN temporal_relevance_score

FUNCTION identify_rising_phrases(keywords, time_window):
  rising_phrases = []
  FOR phrase IN keyword_combinations:
    total_trs = 0
    FOR keyword IN phrase:
      total_trs += calculate_temporal_relevance_score(keyword, query_volume_data, historical_data, time_since_publication_data, frequency_scores)
    IF total_trs > threshold AND rate_of_change(total_trs) > rising_rate_threshold:
      rising_phrases.append(phrase)
  RETURN rising_phrases

FUNCTION adjust_bid_price(phrase, predicted_competition, base_bid_price):
  bid_price = base_bid_price * (1 + predicted_competition_factor)
  RETURN bid_price
```
