## Personalized Predictive Query Expansion via Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Component: Dynamic Knowledge Graph (DKG)**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time user search session data (queries, selections, dwell time, add-to-cart events).
    *   Item metadata (descriptions, attributes, categories, images).
    *   External knowledge bases (Wikidata, DBpedia, product specifications databases).
    *   Social media trends & sentiment analysis (relevant to items).
*   **Node Types:**  Items, Attributes, Concepts, Users.
*   **Edge Types:** `HAS_ATTRIBUTE`, `IS_A`, `RELATED_TO`, `PURCHASED_WITH`, `VIEWED_WITH`, `SEARCHED_WITH`, `USER_INTERESTED_IN`, `USER_PURCHASED`. Edge weights represent co-occurrence frequency, correlation scores, or user engagement metrics.
*   **Construction:** Incremental graph updates triggered by real-time search events. New nodes and edges are added, existing edge weights are adjusted.  A decay function reduces the influence of older interactions.
*   **Storage:** Graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) optimized for fast traversals and real-time updates.

**II. Predictive Query Expansion Module**

*   **Input:** User's initial search query.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Query Disambiguation:** Map the initial query to relevant concepts within the DKG. Utilize entity linking and semantic parsing.
    2.  **Neighborhood Exploration:** Perform a multi-hop graph traversal starting from the mapped concepts. Explore neighbors connected by various edge types (e.g., `RELATED_TO`, `HAS_ATTRIBUTE`, `SEARCHED_WITH`).
    3.  **Relevance Scoring:** Score potential query expansions (neighboring concepts) based on a combined metric:
        *   **Graph Proximity:** Path length and edge weight from the initial query.
        *   **User Affinity:**  User’s past interactions with nodes in the expansion path. (Based on User Nodes)
        *   **Contextual Relevance:** Semantic similarity between the expansion concept and the initial query, incorporating session context.
    4.  **Personalized Ranking:** Rank expansion candidates based on the combined relevance score.

**III. Refinement Tool Display & Interaction**

*   **Display:**
    *   Display top-N ranked expansion queries as “Suggested Refinements” alongside initial search results.
    *   Visually group expansion queries based on shared attributes or concepts ("Refine by Feature").
    *   Highlight attributes that are particularly strong predictors of user interest.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Clicking on a refinement query adds it as a modifier to the original query.
    *   "Explore Similar" button on refinement queries reveals a dynamic sub-graph centered around that query.
    *   "Tell us what you think" feedback mechanism to capture user preferences and improve the relevance scoring model.

**IV. Pseudocode - Predictive Expansion**

```pseudocode
function predict_expansions(user_query, user_id):
  // 1. Disambiguation
  concepts = disambiguate_query(user_query)

  // 2. Neighborhood Exploration
  neighbors = explore_graph(concepts, max_hops=3)

  // 3. Relevance Scoring
  scored_neighbors = []
  for neighbor in neighbors:
    graph_proximity = calculate_graph_proximity(concepts, neighbor)
    user_affinity = calculate_user_affinity(user_id, neighbor)
    contextual_relevance = calculate_contextual_relevance(user_query, neighbor)

    score = weight_graph_proximity * graph_proximity + \
            weight_user_affinity * user_affinity + \
            weight_contextual_relevance * contextual_relevance

    scored_neighbors.append((neighbor, score))

  // 4. Personalized Ranking
  ranked_neighbors = sort(scored_neighbors, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  return ranked_neighbors[:N] // Top N expansions
```

**V. Innovation Highlights:**

*   **Dynamic Graph:** Real-time updates ensure the knowledge graph remains current and reflects evolving user behavior.
*   **Personalized Relevance:** Combines graph structure, user history, and contextual information for highly relevant expansion suggestions.
*   **Interactive Exploration:** Allows users to dynamically explore the knowledge graph and refine their searches.
*   **Multi-Modal Data Integration:** Leverages diverse data sources (text, images, social media) for a richer understanding of items and user preferences.
