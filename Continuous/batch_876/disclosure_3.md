## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Summaries

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply summarizing *what* happened in media to summarizing *how it felt* – dynamically tailoring summaries to evoke specific emotional responses in the user, either reinforcing or contrasting the original content's emotional tone. This isn't about factual recall, but about engineered emotional impact.

**Specs:**

*   **Emotional Profile Database:** A continuously updated database correlating media segments (scenes, dialogue exchanges, musical cues) with quantifiable emotional responses (valence, arousal, dominance). This data is sourced from biometric feedback (heart rate, skin conductance, facial expression analysis) gathered during user viewing, augmented by sentiment analysis of social media discussions and expert annotations.
*   **User Emotional State Detection:** Real-time assessment of the user’s emotional state using wearable sensors (smartwatch, earbuds) or webcam analysis. Data points include heart rate variability, facial micro-expressions, vocal tone, and even typing speed/patterns.
*   **Summary Generation Engine:**
    *   Takes as input: User's current emotional state, desired emotional effect (reinforce, contrast, neutralize), media content, and Emotional Profile Database.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  **Target Emotion Determination:** Define a target emotional state for the summary (e.g., if user is anxious, aim for calm; if user is bored, aim for excitement).
        2.  **Segment Selection:** Identify media segments that strongly evoke the target emotion *based on the Emotional Profile Database*. Prioritize segments with high emotional intensity.
        3.  **Dynamic Editing:**
            *   **Visual Emphasis:** Use visual cues (color grading, zoom, motion graphics) to amplify the emotional impact of selected segments.
            *   **Audio Manipulation:** Adjust audio levels, use emotive music overlays, or apply sound effects to enhance the emotional tone.
            *   **Pacing Control:** Vary the speed and duration of segments to create specific emotional rhythms. Fast cuts for excitement, slow dissolves for sadness.
            *   **Dialogue Highlighting:** Emphasize key lines of dialogue that contribute to the target emotion.
        4.  **Segment Sequencing:** Assemble selected segments into a cohesive summary that tells a condensed version of the story while maximizing the target emotional impact.
*   **Output:** A dynamically generated video/audio summary presented to the user.
*   **Integration:** Works alongside existing media playback systems (streaming services, video players).

**Pseudocode (Summary Generation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateEmotionalSummary(userEmotionalState, desiredEmotionalEffect, mediaContent):

    emotionalProfileData = LookupEmotionalData(mediaContent)
    targetEmotion = CalculateTargetEmotion(userEmotionalState, desiredEmotionalEffect)

    // Select segments evoking target emotion
    candidateSegments = FilterSegments(emotionalProfileData, targetEmotion)
    selectedSegments = PrioritizeSegments(candidateSegments, emotionalIntensity)

    // Dynamically edit selected segments
    FOR segment IN selectedSegments:
        ApplyVisualEffects(segment, targetEmotion)
        AdjustAudioLevels(segment, targetEmotion)
        EmphasizeDialogue(segment, targetEmotion)

    // Sequence segments to create summary
    summary = AssembleSummary(editedSegments)

    RETURN summary
```

**Novelty:** Existing summaries focus on *what* happened. This focuses on *how it feels* – actively manipulating the user's emotional state using data-driven media editing. This goes beyond simple ‘mood setting’ – it’s about precisely engineered emotional resonance. It’s a method of psychological manipulation via entertainment content.
