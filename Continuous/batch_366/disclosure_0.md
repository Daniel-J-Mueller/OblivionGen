**Dynamic Occlusion Mapping for Augmented Reality Scene Reconstruction**

**Concept:** Extend motion-extracted image processing to generate real-time, dynamic occlusion maps for augmented reality (AR) applications. Instead of simply removing moving objects, the system learns to *understand* what is being occluded and reconstructs the hidden areas, enhancing the realism of AR overlays.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-exposure image stream (as per the patent) + Depth Sensor data (e.g., Time-of-Flight or Stereo Vision).
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Motion Extraction:** Utilize the patent's method to identify moving objects (foreground seeds and connected pixels).
    2.  **Depth Map Fusion:** Fuse depth data with the multi-exposure images.  This provides a 3D understanding of the scene *behind* the moving object.  Handle occlusion explicitly in depth map creation (e.g. depth values set to invalid if occluded.)
    3.  **Occlusion Map Generation:** For each extracted moving object:
        *   Identify the region of the image where the object *was*.
        *   Using the fused depth map, project the 3D points *behind* the moving object onto the 2D image plane. This reconstructs the occluded area.
        *   Generate an "occlusion map" representing the reconstructed pixels.  This map includes both the color/texture information *and* a confidence level indicating the accuracy of the reconstruction (based on depth data quality & motion estimation).
    4.  **AR Overlay Integration:** When rendering an AR overlay:
        *   Before rendering, check for occlusion maps in the relevant areas.
        *   If an occlusion map exists, use the reconstructed pixels to fill in the areas *behind* the AR object, creating a more realistic integration with the scene.
        *   Dynamically update the occlusion map as the moving objectâ€™s position changes.

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Image Sensor (capable of multi-exposure capture)
    *   Depth Sensor (Time-of-Flight or Stereo Vision)
    *   High-Performance Processor (for real-time processing)
*   **Software:**
    *   Motion Extraction Algorithm (based on patent)
    *   Depth Map Fusion Algorithm
    *   Occlusion Map Generation Algorithm
    *   AR Rendering Engine
*   **Pseudocode (Occlusion Map Generation):**

```
function generate_occlusion_map(motion_extracted_pixels, depth_map, image_data):
  occlusion_map = empty_image()
  for pixel in motion_extracted_pixels:
    x, y = pixel.coordinates
    depth_value = depth_map[x, y]
    if depth_value is valid:
      # Project 3D points behind the pixel onto the 2D image plane
      reconstructed_pixels = project_3d_points(depth_value, x, y, image_data)
      occlusion_map[x, y] = reconstructed_pixels
      confidence_level = calculate_confidence(depth_value) # Higher value = more accurate
      occlusion_map[x, y].confidence = confidence_level
    else:
      # If no depth data, fill with a default color/texture
      occlusion_map[x, y] = default_texture
      occlusion_map[x, y].confidence = 0

  return occlusion_map
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Realistic AR object placement behind moving objects (e.g., placing a virtual plant behind a person walking through a room).
    *   Enhanced occlusion handling in AR games (e.g., a virtual character realistically disappearing behind a moving object).
    *   Improved AR navigation systems (e.g., AR arrows dynamically adjusting to occlusions caused by moving vehicles).
