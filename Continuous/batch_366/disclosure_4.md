## Secure Instance 'Rewind' with Temporal Data Capture

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple volume snapshots to capture *all* volatile and non-volatile data at defined intervals, creating a true "rewind" capability, not just a reset to a known clean state. This isn't about recovering from corruption – it's about replaying specific moments in an instance's lifecycle for debugging, auditing, or even A/B testing of code changes *in production* without impacting live users.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Data Capture Agent (TDCA):** A kernel-level agent running within the compute instance.
    *   **Functionality:** Periodically (configurable – e.g., every 5 seconds, every minute, on-demand) capture a complete memory snapshot (volatile data) *and* a delta of all disk block changes (non-volatile data) since the last capture.
    *   **Storage:**  Captured data stored in a dedicated, high-performance, compressed format (e.g., Zstandard) on a separate, designated storage volume or distributed storage system. Avoid writing to the primary instance volume.
    *   **Capture Modes:**
        *   *Continuous:*  Regular, automated capture.
        *   *Event-Triggered:* Capture triggered by specific events (e.g., application errors, performance thresholds exceeded, security alerts).
        *   *Manual:* On-demand capture initiated by an administrator or application.
2.  **Rewind Orchestrator:** A system component responsible for managing the rewind process.
    *   **Functionality:**
        *   Receive rewind requests specifying a target timestamp or a relative time offset.
        *   Identify the relevant captured data based on the requested timestamp.
        *   Initiate a rewind operation:
            *   Pause the instance.
            *   Restore the captured memory snapshot to the instance’s volatile memory.
            *   Apply the captured disk block changes (delta) to the instance’s disk volume.
            *   Resume the instance.  The instance effectively "travels back in time" to the specified state.
3.  **Delta Compression & Storage:**
    *   Implement a highly efficient delta compression algorithm optimized for disk block changes.
    *   Utilize a storage format that supports efficient storage and retrieval of delta data (e.g., a specialized delta tree).
4. **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /rewind`: Accepts target timestamp, rewind mode (test/production).
    *   `GET /capture-status`: Returns status of ongoing capture processes.
    *   `POST /capture-config`: Allows configuration of capture frequency and retention policies.

**Pseudocode (Rewind Orchestrator - Core Logic):**

```
function rewindInstance(instanceID, targetTimestamp):
    pauseInstance(instanceID)
    captureData = findCaptureData(instanceID, targetTimestamp)
    if captureData == null:
        throw Error("No capture data found for specified timestamp.")

    restoreMemorySnapshot(instanceID, captureData.memorySnapshot)
    applyDiskDelta(instanceID, captureData.diskDelta)
    resumeInstance(instanceID)
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Granular Time Travel:** Enables precise rewinding to specific moments in time, exceeding the limitations of traditional snapshots.
*   **Non-Disruptive Debugging/Auditing:** Allows administrators to analyze instance state at any point in time without impacting live applications.
*   **A/B Testing in Production:** Enables safe and controlled A/B testing of code changes in a live production environment by temporarily reverting to a previous state.
*   **Advanced Security Forensics:** Facilitates in-depth security investigations by reconstructing instance state at the time of a security incident.
