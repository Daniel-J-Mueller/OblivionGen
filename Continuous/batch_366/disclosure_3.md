## Dynamic Hierarchical Anomaly Detection with Predictive Feature Synthesis

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Feature Synthesis Engine (PFSE)
*   **Data Inputs:** Real-time data streams (any format), Historical data (cube structure compatible with patent 10812551), Entity Relationship Graph (ERG) – a knowledge graph linking entities and their relationships.
*   **Data Outputs:** Anomaly Scores (numeric), Anomaly Explanations (textual), Predicted Feature Values (numeric), Updated ERG (optional).
*   **Hardware Requirements:** High-performance compute cluster with GPU acceleration, large-capacity storage (SSD preferred), high-bandwidth network connectivity.

**Innovation Description:**

This system builds on the concept of correlating events, but introduces *predictive* feature synthesis. Instead of simply flagging anomalies based on existing data, the system actively *predicts* what data *should* look like, given the entity's history, relationships, and the current context.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Entity Resolution & Graph Traversal:** Incoming data is first associated with entities in the ERG.  The system traverses the graph to identify related entities and their properties.
2.  **Hierarchical Feature Extraction:**  For each entity, features are extracted at multiple levels of granularity (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly). This mimics a hierarchical data cube, but allows for dynamic adjustment of the hierarchy based on the entity's behavior.  The cube structure from the provided patent can serve as a foundation, but the dimensions are dynamically generated.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** A suite of time series forecasting models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) is trained for each feature at each level of the hierarchy.  Models are updated continuously with new data.  The core innovation is the ability to ‘borrow’ information from related entities in the ERG.  If a model for entity A is weak (limited data), it can leverage a weighted average of models from similar entities (based on the ERG).
4.  **Anomaly Detection:** Incoming data is fed into the predictive models. The difference between the predicted value and the actual value is calculated. This difference is normalized and scored.  High scores indicate anomalies.
5.  **Explanation Generation:** The system identifies the features that contributed most to the anomaly score.  It then uses the ERG to provide a contextual explanation.  For example: "Anomaly detected in website traffic for user X.  This is likely due to a DDoS attack originating from IP address Y, which is known to be associated with malicious activity."
6.  **Adaptive Hierarchy:** The system monitors the performance of the predictive models.  If a model is consistently inaccurate, it adjusts the hierarchy.  For example, it might switch from a daily to an hourly granularity, or it might add new features to the model.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function detect_anomaly(entity_id, data_point):
  entity = get_entity(entity_id)
  related_entities = get_related_entities(entity)

  for feature in entity.features:
    predicted_value = predict(feature, data_point, entity, related_entities)
    anomaly_score = abs(data_point[feature] - predicted_value)
    anomaly_scores[feature] = anomaly_score

  overall_anomaly_score = sum(anomaly_scores.values())

  if overall_anomaly_score > threshold:
    explanation = generate_explanation(entity, anomaly_scores)
    return True, overall_anomaly_score, explanation
  else:
    return False, 0, ""

function predict(feature, data_point, entity, related_entities):
  model = get_model(entity, feature)
  if model is None:
    // Train model using historical data from entity and related entities
    model = train_model(entity, related_entities, feature)

  return model.predict(data_point)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Causal Inference:** Incorporate causal inference techniques to identify the root causes of anomalies.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the predictive models and anomaly detection thresholds.
*   **Automated ERG Construction:** Automatically construct and update the ERG using machine learning techniques.
*   **Federated Learning:**  Enable federated learning across multiple data sources to improve model accuracy and privacy.
