## Container Image ‘Provenance’ & Dynamic Policy Enforcement

**Specification:** A system extending container registry functionality to incorporate immutable ‘provenance’ data alongside each image layer, coupled with a runtime policy engine allowing dynamic enforcement based on this provenance.

**Core Concept:** Current container image security focuses heavily on vulnerability *scanning* after an image is built. This shifts the focus to *proving* image integrity and intended behavior *at build time*, and then dynamically enforcing policies based on this proof at runtime. 

**Components:**

1.  **Provenance Builder:** Integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, this tool analyzes each layer of the container image during build. It captures:
    *   **Dependency Graph:** A complete, signed list of all dependencies used within the layer (packages, libraries, system calls etc.).
    *   **Build Environment:**  Hashing of the build environment (OS version, compiler, flags, environment variables).
    *   **Author/Signer:** Digital signature of the build process/author.
    *   **Attestation:** A cryptographically verifiable statement about the layer's contents and build process.
2.  **Provenance Store:**  An immutable, append-only datastore integrated with the container registry. Each image layer is associated with its provenance data, creating a complete, verifiable history. Blockchain or Merkle tree structures could be utilized.
3.  **Policy Engine:** A runtime component deployed alongside container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm). This engine allows administrators to define policies based on provenance data. Examples:
    *   “Only deploy images built with a specific compiler version.”
    *   “Block images containing dependencies with known vulnerabilities *after a specific date*.” (Dynamic vulnerability assessment tied to build time.)
    *   “Require images to be signed by a specific author/organization.”
    *   “Isolate images built with untrusted dependencies into a sandbox.”
4. **Runtime Interceptor:** A component which intercepts container startup requests.  It queries the Provenance Store to retrieve the provenance data for the image layers. This data is passed to the Policy Engine for evaluation. If the policy evaluation fails, the container startup is blocked or modified (e.g., restricted resources).

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(containerImage, policyDefinition):
  provenanceData = getProvenanceData(containerImage)
  
  if policyDefinition.compilerVersion:
    requiredVersion = policyDefinition.compilerVersion
    buildCompilerVersion = provenanceData.buildEnvironment.compilerVersion
    if buildCompilerVersion != requiredVersion:
      return false // Policy violation

  if policyDefinition.dependencyBlacklist:
    for dependency in provenanceData.dependencyGraph:
      if dependency in policyDefinition.dependencyBlacklist:
        return false // Policy violation

  if policyDefinition.authorSignature:
    expectedSignature = policyDefinition.authorSignature
    actualSignature = provenanceData.authorSignature
    if !verifySignature(actualSignature, expectedSignature):
      return false // Policy violation

  return true // Policy passed
```

**Data Structure (Provenance Data – Example):**

```json
{
  "layerHash": "...",
  "dependencyGraph": [
    {"name": "libssl", "version": "1.1.1"},
    {"name": "zlib", "version": "1.2.11"}
  ],
  "buildEnvironment": {
    "os": "Ubuntu 20.04",
    "compiler": "gcc 9.3.0"
  },
  "authorSignature": "...",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**Novelty:** Current systems focus on scanning *existing* images. This approach focuses on establishing and enforcing *trust* at the point of image creation, providing a more proactive and robust security model. The dynamic policy enforcement capability allows for adaptable security rules, responding to evolving threats and organizational requirements. This moves beyond vulnerability scanning to a form of ‘image attestation’.
