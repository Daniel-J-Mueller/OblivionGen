## Dynamic Narrative Constraint System & Generative Worldbuilding

**Concept:** Expand the entity/action relationship framework beyond manuscript compliance to a full-fledged system for *procedurally generating* and *dynamically evolving* fictional worlds and narratives, utilizing AI to maintain internal consistency and emergent storytelling. 

**Specifications:**

**I. Core World Model:**

*   **Entity Database:** Structured database holding entities (characters, locations, objects, concepts) with attributes (physical properties, behavioral tendencies, relationships, historical significance). Entities are assigned semantic tags for AI processing.
*   **Action/Event Library:** Comprehensive library of actions/events (verbs, phrases, sequences) associated with entities. Actions have preconditions, effects, and probabilities.
*   **Relationship Matrix:** Multi-dimensional matrix representing relationships between entities. Relationships are typed (e.g., familial, adversarial, symbiotic) and have strength/weight values.
*   **World Rules:** Set of rules governing the world’s physics, magic systems, societal norms, and logical constraints. Rules can be hard (absolute) or soft (probabilistic). 
*   **Temporal Dimension:** Each entity, action, and rule is tagged with a temporal scope (past, present, future, cyclical). Enables modeling of historical evolution and future projections.

**II. Dynamic Narrative Engine:**

1.  **Initialization:** Load a seed world model (potentially derived from existing literature or user-defined parameters).
2.  **Event Trigger:** Initiate an event (e.g., a character makes a decision, a natural disaster occurs).
3.  **Constraint Propagation:** The event triggers a cascade of constraint propagation through the Relationship Matrix and World Rules. 
4.  **AI-Driven Response Generation:** 
    *   **Action Selection:** AI selects a plausible action based on involved entities, context, and probabilities.  Synonymous actions are dynamically generated to avoid repetition.
    *   **World State Update:** The world state is updated based on the chosen action, including changes to entity attributes, relationships, and locations.
    *   **Emergent Narrative Generation:**  A natural language processing (NLP) module generates a narrative description of the event and its consequences.
5.  **Feedback & Learning:**
    *   **Consistency Check:** An AI module monitors for logical inconsistencies and violations of World Rules.
    *   **World Rule Refinement:** Based on emergent behavior and inconsistencies, the AI can suggest modifications to World Rules, enhancing the world’s internal logic and believability.
    *   **Long-Term Memory:**  A long-term memory system stores the history of events and their consequences, creating a persistent and evolving world narrative.

**III. Pseudocode Example (Event Generation):**

```
function GenerateEvent(entity1, entity2, actionType) {

    // 1. Identify potential actions based on entity types and actionType
    potentialActions = GetActions(entity1, entity2, actionType)

    // 2. Filter actions based on preconditions and constraints
    validActions = FilterActions(potentialActions, GetWorldState())

    // 3. Assign probabilities to valid actions based on entity attributes and context
    weightedActions = WeightActions(validActions, entity1, entity2)

    // 4. Select an action based on weighted probabilities
    selectedAction = RandomlySelectAction(weightedActions)

    // 5. Update world state based on selected action
    UpdateWorldState(selectedAction, entity1, entity2)

    // 6. Generate narrative description of event
    narrative = GenerateNarrative(selectedAction, entity1, entity2)

    return narrative, GetWorldState()
}
```

**IV. System Components:**

*   **World Builder Module:** Allows users to define entities, relationships, and rules.
*   **Simulation Engine:** Executes the Dynamic Narrative Engine.
*   **Narrative Generator:** Translates world state changes into narrative text.
*   **AI Consistency Checker:** Monitors for logical inconsistencies.
*   **Rule Refinement Engine:** Suggests improvements to World Rules.
*   **API Interface:** Enables integration with external applications (e.g., game engines, VR environments).
