## Adaptive Biofeedback Integration – User Recognition Device

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, brainwave activity via non-invasive sensors) *directly* into the user recognition process, not just as authentication, but as dynamic profile adjustment. The device learns not just *who* the user is, but *how* the user is *feeling* and adjusts its interaction accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor for heart rate & HRV. Integrated into the device’s housing where hand contact is expected (e.g., sides, top surface).
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor – small contact pads integrated into the same contact areas as PPG.
    *   Single-channel EEG sensor – Lightweight, dry-electrode sensor integrated into a headband-style attachment. Communicates wirelessly to the main device. (Optional, for advanced profiles).
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated low-power DSP for real-time biofeedback data acquisition, filtering, and feature extraction.
*   **Machine Learning Module:**
    *   Initial Baseline Collection: Device gathers biofeedback data over a period (e.g., 5 minutes) while user explicitly identifies themselves. This establishes a "neutral" state profile.
    *   Dynamic Profile Adjustment: The device constantly monitors biofeedback signals. Deviations from the baseline (indicating stress, relaxation, focus, etc.) dynamically adjust the user interface (UI) and/or functionality.
    *   Algorithm: Hybrid approach – a combination of:
        *   **Hidden Markov Models (HMM):**  For sequence modeling of biofeedback signals to identify patterns indicative of emotional states.
        *   **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** For classifying emotional states based on extracted features.
*   **UI/Functionality Adaptation Examples:**
    *   **Stress Detection:**  If high stress levels are detected, the device proactively offers calming features (e.g., guided breathing exercises, simplified UI, muting of non-essential notifications).
    *   **Focus Enhancement:**  If low engagement/focus is detected, the device could subtly adjust screen brightness/contrast, play ambient soundscapes, or prioritize critical tasks.
    *   **Fatigue Detection:**  Device could suggest breaks, adjust screen timeout, or even temporarily disable certain features.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Secure Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transmission to paired devices (smartphones, computers).
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Profile Adjustment):**

```
function adjustProfile(currentBiofeedbackData):
  // 1. Feature Extraction
  hrv = extractHeartRateVariability(currentBiofeedbackData)
  gsr = extractSkinConductance(currentBiofeedbackData)
  // 2. State Classification (using pre-trained SVM/HMM model)
  emotionalState = classifyState(hrv, gsr)

  // 3. Adaptation Logic (Rule-Based or ML-Driven)
  if emotionalState == "High Stress":
    activateCalmingFeatures()
    simplifyUI()
  else if emotionalState == "Low Focus":
    adjustBrightnessContrast()
    playAmbientSounds()
  else if emotionalState == "Fatigue":
    suggestBreak()
    disableNonEssentialFeatures()
  else:
    restoreDefaultSettings()

  return
```

**Materials:**

*   Housing: Lightweight, durable plastic with soft-touch finish.
*   Sensors: Medical-grade biocompatible materials.
*   Headband (optional): Flexible, breathable fabric.
