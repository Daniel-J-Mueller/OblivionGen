**Adaptive Haptic Communication System**

**Concept:** Augment the display of communications with localized haptic feedback, tailoring the intensity and pattern based on sender identity, emotional tone (determined from text analysis), and urgency.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Grid:** Integrate a high-resolution (100+ points/inch) haptic grid beneath the device's display surface. Utilize ultrasonic transducers or micro-actuators for precise tactile feedback.
*   **Sender Profiles:** Maintain a database of user-defined sender profiles. Each profile stores preferred haptic patterns (pulse, vibration, texture) and intensity levels. Profiles automatically created on first communication, and manually adjustable.
*   **Emotional Tone Analysis:** Implement a natural language processing (NLP) module to analyze incoming message text for emotional cues (joy, sadness, anger, urgency). Map emotional scores to haptic intensity and pattern variations.
*   **Urgency Detection:** Analyze message content (keywords like "urgent," "important," exclamation marks) and sender history to determine message urgency. Higher urgency triggers more pronounced haptic feedback.
*   **Dynamic Haptic Mapping:** Develop an algorithm to dynamically map sender identity, emotional tone, and urgency to haptic feedback parameters. Algorithm should allow for customization and learning (adapting to user preferences over time).
*   **Proximity Awareness:** Integrate with the device's proximity sensors to detect user touch. Activate haptic feedback only when the user is actively holding or interacting with the device.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Establish a communication protocol between the NLP module, proximity sensors, and the haptic grid controller.
*   **Power Management:** Implement power-saving features to minimize battery drain during extended periods of inactivity.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Logic):**

```
function generate_haptic_feedback(message, sender_id):
  sender_profile = get_sender_profile(sender_id)
  emotional_score = analyze_emotional_tone(message)
  urgency_level = determine_urgency(message)

  base_intensity = sender_profile.preferred_intensity
  pattern = sender_profile.preferred_pattern

  intensity = base_intensity + (emotional_score * intensity_multiplier) + (urgency_level * urgency_multiplier)
  
  if intensity > max_intensity:
      intensity = max_intensity

  //Apply pattern modifications based on emotional tone
  if emotional_score > joy_threshold:
      pattern = joy_pattern
  elif emotional_score < sadness_threshold:
      pattern = sadness_pattern
  
  //Activate Haptic Grid with selected intensity and pattern
  activate_haptic_grid(intensity, pattern)
```
