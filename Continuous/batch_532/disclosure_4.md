## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' for Proactive Failure Prediction & Mitigation

**Specification:** A system that creates not just a duplicate network for testing, but a continuously synchronized ‘shadow’ network operating in parallel with a production network. This shadow isn’t just a static copy; it actively mirrors traffic patterns *and* introduces controlled, randomized failures to predict the impact of real-world issues *before* they occur.

**Components:**

*   **Traffic Mirror:**  A mechanism (e.g., network tap, SPAN port, virtual switch mirroring) to capture a representative subset of production network traffic.  The selection criteria for this subset must be configurable – prioritizing critical application flows or specific device communications.
*   **Shadow Network Engine:** Responsible for creating and maintaining the shadow network. Utilizes virtualized network functions (VNFs) mirroring those in production.
*   **Failure Injection Module:** The core innovation.  This module operates on the shadow network, introducing a configurable range of failures:
    *   **Link Degradation:** Simulates packet loss, latency increases, bandwidth throttling.
    *   **Device Failure:**  Simulates complete device outages (servers, switches, firewalls). Includes 'graceful degradation' modes to mimic partial failures.
    *   **Application-Level Errors:** Introduces synthetic errors into application responses (e.g., database timeouts, HTTP 500 errors)
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Simulates CPU, memory, or disk space limitations.
*   **Performance Monitoring & Anomaly Detection:** Continuously monitors the shadow network performance under injected failures.  Focuses on key metrics like latency, throughput, error rates, and application response times.  Utilizes machine learning to establish baseline performance and detect anomalies caused by failures.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:** Leverages the performance data from the shadow network to build predictive models of network behavior.  These models can forecast the impact of potential failures on the production network, allowing for proactive mitigation.
*   **Mitigation Recommendation Engine:** Based on the predictive models, this engine generates recommendations for mitigating potential failures. This might include:
    *   Automatic scaling of resources.
    *   Traffic rerouting.
    *   Configuration changes.
*   **Control Plane:** API and UI for configuration, monitoring, and control of the entire system.

**Pseudocode (Failure Injection Module):**

```
function inject_failure(device_id, failure_type, parameters):
  // failure_type: "link_degradation", "device_failure", "app_error", "resource_exhaustion"
  // parameters: specific to failure_type (e.g., packet_loss_percentage, duration, error_code)

  if failure_type == "link_degradation":
    configure_traffic_shaper(device_id, parameters.packet_loss_percentage, parameters.latency_increase)
  elif failure_type == "device_failure":
    shutdown_device(device_id, parameters.duration)  // Or simulate partial functionality loss
  elif failure_type == "app_error":
    intercept_app_requests(device_id)
    modify_app_responses(parameters.error_code)
  elif failure_type == "resource_exhaustion":
    limit_device_resources(device_id, parameters.resource_type, parameters.limit)
  else:
    log_error("Invalid failure type")
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  Traffic is mirrored from the production network to the shadow network.
2.  The shadow network replicates the production network topology and configuration.
3.  The Failure Injection Module systematically introduces a range of failures into the shadow network.
4.  The Performance Monitoring & Anomaly Detection system captures performance data under these failures.
5.  The Predictive Modeling Engine builds models of network behavior.
6.  The Mitigation Recommendation Engine generates recommendations for proactive mitigation.
7.  Operators can review these recommendations and implement them in the production network.
