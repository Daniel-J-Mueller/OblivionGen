## Dynamic Content Stitching with Predictive Segment Pre-Loading

**Concept:** Expand on the real-time truncation and segmenting of live video streams by introducing predictive segment pre-loading based on ML analysis of anticipated event occurrences within the stream.  Instead of *reactively* truncating based on detected start/end locations, the system proactively fetches and prepares likely segments *before* they are officially signaled, creating a near-seamless viewing experience and minimizing buffering.

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:**  "Anticipatory Segment Manager" (ASM)
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Live Video Stream (RTSP, HLS, etc.)
    *   ML Model Outputs (as defined in the base patent – start/end locations, event types, confidence scores)
    *   Historical Event Data (database of past event occurrences, timings, and associated stream segments – crucial for prediction accuracy)
    *   User Preference Data (optional – preferred event types, teams, etc.)
*   **Data Outputs:**
    *   Pre-loaded Video Segments (stored in a high-speed buffer/cache)
    *   Segment Delivery Schedule (instructs the player on the order and timing of segment delivery)
    *   Real-time Stream Adjustment Signals (fine-tunes segment selection based on evolving ML analysis)

**Functional Description:**

1.  **Prediction Phase:** The ASM continuously analyzes the live stream using the ML model.  Instead of simply identifying confirmed start/end locations, the model's output is used to *predict* the probability of future events.  Historical data and user preferences weight these probabilities. For example, if a basketball game is in the 4th quarter and historical data shows a high probability of foul calls in the last two minutes, the ASM will proactively fetch segments corresponding to those likely periods.

2.  **Segment Acquisition:** Based on the predicted probabilities, the ASM requests segments from the live stream source (or a CDN).  Multiple segments are fetched *in advance*, forming a pre-load buffer. The size of the buffer is dynamically adjusted based on network conditions, prediction confidence, and available storage.

3.  **Dynamic Scheduling:** The segment delivery schedule is not fixed. As the ML model refines its analysis (e.g., confirming an event is about to occur), the schedule is dynamically updated to prioritize relevant segments.  If a predicted event doesn’t materialize, the schedule is adjusted accordingly, and the pre-loaded segment is discarded or used for another purpose.

4.  **Seamless Transition:** The player application seamlessly switches between pre-loaded and dynamically fetched segments, minimizing buffering and ensuring a smooth viewing experience.  The transition is timed to coincide with natural pauses in the stream (e.g., commercial breaks, game stoppages) to further enhance the illusion of continuous playback.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Segment Scheduling):**

```
// Variables
predictedEvents[] = array of predicted event occurrences (timestamp, eventType, confidence)
segmentBuffer[] = array of pre-loaded video segments
currentStreamPosition = current playback timestamp

// Function: updateSegmentSchedule()
function updateSegmentSchedule() {
  // Sort predictedEvents by timestamp
  sort(predictedEvents, ascending)

  // Iterate through predictedEvents
  for each event in predictedEvents {
    // Check if event timestamp is approaching
    if (event.timestamp - currentStreamPosition < bufferThreshold) { // bufferThreshold = 2 seconds
      // Check if segment is already in segmentBuffer
      if (!segmentExists(segmentBuffer, event.timestamp)) {
        // Fetch segment from stream source
        segment = fetchSegment(event.timestamp)
        // Add segment to segmentBuffer
        addSegment(segmentBuffer, segment)
      }
    }
  }

  // Deliver segments to player based on currentStreamPosition
  deliverNextSegment(segmentBuffer, currentStreamPosition)
}

// Run updateSegmentSchedule() continuously
while (true) {
  updateSegmentSchedule()
  sleep(0.1 seconds)
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-speed storage (SSD/NVMe) for segment buffer
*   Sufficient network bandwidth for concurrent segment fetching
*   Powerful processor for ML model inference and segment encoding/decoding

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Stream Prediction:** Predict events across multiple concurrent streams (e.g., multiple sporting events)
*   **Personalized Segment Selection:** Tailor segment selection based on individual user preferences and viewing history
*   **AI-Driven Segment Curation:** Use AI to identify and curate segments based on their emotional impact or highlight reel potential
