## Adaptive Sensory Data Masking & Behavioral Profiling

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:** Expand upon the 'cloaking' of sensitive data not just as a fidelity reduction, but as an *adaptive* masking based on real-time behavioral profiling of the requesting application *and* the user’s contextual environment. 

**II. Data Sources:**

*   **Application Behavioral Log:**  Monitor API calls, resource access patterns, network activity, and CPU/memory usage of the requesting application.
*   **User Contextual Data:** GPS location, time of day, motion sensor data (activity level - walking, stationary, driving), connected devices (Bluetooth, WiFi), and calendar events.  *Privacy-preserving aggregation and anonymization required.*
*   **Sensitivity Matrix:** A configurable matrix linking data types (location, contacts, photos, etc.) to sensitivity levels (high, medium, low) and permissible levels of degradation for each.
*   **Taint Propagation Data:** As currently described in the patent, tracking the flow of potentially sensitive data.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Request Interception:**  Intercept any application request for sensitive data.
2.  **Behavioral Profiling:** Analyze the application’s recent behavior (last 5-10 minutes) and the user’s contextual data.  Utilize a Machine Learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) to predict the *intended purpose* of the data request.  (e.g. map app requesting location = navigation, social media app requesting location = check-in, game requesting location = irrelevant)
3.  **Adaptive Masking:** Based on the predicted purpose and the Sensitivity Matrix, dynamically adjust the level of data masking applied:
    *   **Fidelity Reduction:**  Reduce precision (e.g., location to city level instead of GPS coordinates).
    *   **Data Substitution:** Replace real data with plausible but fabricated data. (e.g. replacing precise location with a nearby Point of Interest).
    *   **Feature Removal:**  Remove irrelevant data features (e.g. removing timestamps from photo metadata if not needed).
    *   **Noise Injection:** Add random noise to obfuscate sensitive values while preserving general trends.
4.  **Taint Propagation Enhancement:** Extend the taint propagation to track the *degree* of masking applied to the data. This allows for refining the trust level not just on data *usage*, but on how the data was *transformed* during access.
5.  **Trust Level Adjustment:** Update the application's trust level based on both its data usage patterns and the degree of masking required. 
6.  **Feedback Loop:**  Continuously refine the behavioral model and sensitivity matrix based on user feedback and observed application behavior.

**IV. Pseudocode (Core Masking Logic):**

```
function maskData(data, appProfile, userContext, sensitivityMatrix):
    dataType = getDataTypeName(data)
    sensitivityLevel = sensitivityMatrix[dataType]
    intendedPurpose = predictIntendedPurpose(appProfile, userContext)

    maskingLevel = calculateMaskingLevel(sensitivityLevel, intendedPurpose)

    if maskingLevel == "none":
        return data

    if maskingLevel == "low":
        # Reduce precision, remove minor features
        maskedData = reducePrecision(data)
        maskedData = removeMinorFeatures(maskedData)

    if maskingLevel == "medium":
        # Replace with plausible data, inject noise
        maskedData = replaceWithPlausibleData(data)
        maskedData = injectNoise(maskedData)

    if maskingLevel == "high":
        # Return generic placeholder, or completely block access
        maskedData = generatePlaceholder(data)

    return maskedData
```

**V. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated security enclave for sensitive data processing.
*   Hardware acceleration for Machine Learning inference.
*   Secure storage for trust level database and behavioral models.

**VI. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Differential Privacy:** Incorporate techniques for adding noise to the data in a way that guarantees privacy while preserving statistical utility.
*   **Federated Learning:** Train the behavioral models on decentralized data sources (multiple mobile devices) without sharing raw data.
*   **Explainable AI:** Provide users with insights into why certain data masking decisions were made.
