## Tactile Locking & Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Expand upon the rotational locking mechanism by integrating haptic feedback and customizable tactile 'clicks' to enhance user experience and provide confirmation of lock/unlock status. Move beyond simple mechanical engagement to create a more informative and satisfying interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Component Additions:**
    *   Miniature linear resonant actuator (LRA) integrated into the rotational bracket.
    *   Tactile ‘click’ wheel – a small, geared wheel coupled to the rotational bracket, designed to create distinct, adjustable tactile feedback pulses during rotation. The wheel will have adjustable tension.
    *   Proximity sensor (capacitive or inductive) to detect cover separation initiation.
    *   Microcontroller (MCU) to manage actuator, sensor, and potentially Bluetooth communication.
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module for configuration via a mobile app.
*   **Operational Logic:**
    1.  **Locking Sequence:** As the rotational bracket moves toward the locked position (first rotational position), the proximity sensor detects the covers nearing full engagement. The MCU triggers the LRA to produce a short, sharp haptic pulse, coinciding with a distinct ‘click’ from the tactile wheel. This provides both tactile and haptic confirmation of secure locking.
    2.  **Unlocking Sequence:** As the rotational bracket rotates towards the unlocked position (second rotational position), the proximity sensor detects cover separation. The MCU triggers a different haptic pattern and/or ‘click’ sequence, indicating successful unlocking.
    3.  **Customization:** The mobile app allows users to:
        *   Adjust the intensity of the haptic feedback.
        *   Select different ‘click’ profiles (e.g., number of clicks per rotation, click intensity).
        *   Customize the haptic and click patterns for lock/unlock events.
        *   Configure a ‘failsafe’ mode – if the cover is not fully locked, the system will provide persistent haptic feedback until locking is complete.
*   **Mechanical Integration:**
    *   The LRA and tactile wheel will be housed within the rotational bracket.
    *   The proximity sensor will be mounted on either the front or rear cover, positioned to detect cover separation.
    *   Power will be supplied via a flexible PCB connection to the device’s main battery.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified MCU Logic):**

```pseudocode
// Variables
isLocked = true;
proximitySensorValue = 0;

// Setup
initializeProximitySensor();
initializeLRA();
initializeTactileWheel();

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  proximitySensorValue = readProximitySensor();

  if (proximitySensorValue < threshold && isLocked) {
    // Unlock sequence initiated
    isLocked = false;
    activateLRA(unlockPattern);
    rotateTactileWheel(unlockClicks);
  } else if (proximitySensorValue > threshold && !isLocked) {
    // Lock sequence initiated
    isLocked = true;
    activateLRA(lockPattern);
    rotateTactileWheel(lockClicks);
  }

  delay(10ms);
}

function activateLRA(pattern) {
  // Play haptic feedback pattern using LRA
}

function rotateTactileWheel(clicks) {
  // Rotate tactile wheel to produce specified number of clicks
}
```

*   **Materials:** Standard plastics for the bracket and wheel, miniature LRA, proximity sensor IC, microcontroller, BLE module, flexible PCB.

This system transforms a purely mechanical locking mechanism into an interactive user experience, providing clear feedback and a degree of personalization. The haptic and tactile cues enhance usability and provide a sense of security.
