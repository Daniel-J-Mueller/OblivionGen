## Dynamic Merchant Foot Traffic Prediction & Pre-Staging

**System Specifications:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical order data (as per the provided patent)
    *   Real-time point-of-sale (POS) data from the merchant (item sales, transaction times)
    *   Local event schedules (concerts, sporting events, festivals) - API integration.
    *   Weather data – API integration.
    *   Social media activity (keyword mentions related to the merchant/items) - API integration.
    *   Public transportation schedules & real-time tracking - API integration.
*   **Hardware:**
    *   Edge computing device at the merchant location (powerful enough for real-time processing of POS and sensor data).
    *   Cloud-based server for long-term data storage, model training, and overall system management.
*   **Software:**
    *   Time series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) trained on combined data sources. Model must be dynamically retrained (weekly, daily) on new data.
    *   Foot traffic prediction module: Outputs predicted number of customers per 15-minute intervals.
    *   Item Demand Prediction Module: Predicts demand for specific items based on historical orders, foot traffic predictions, and external factors.
    *   Pre-staging Automation Module: Based on item demand prediction, this module generates a ‘staging list’ and communicates it to robotic fulfillment systems within the merchant location.
    *   API for communication between modules, external data sources, and merchant systems.
    *   Dashboard for merchants to monitor predictions, adjust parameters, and view performance metrics.

**Innovation Details:**

This system moves *beyond* simply predicting arrival time for individual customers. It forecasts overall merchant foot traffic and item demand in real-time. This enables merchants to proactively prepare for peak periods – not just by assembling individual orders faster, but by strategically positioning popular items for immediate grab-and-go access, and adjusting staffing levels.

**Pseudocode - Item Pre-Staging Logic:**

```
// Function: generateStagingList
// Input: predictedFootTraffic (int), predictedItemDemand (dict), merchantLayout (graph)
// Output: stagingList (list) – list of item locations & quantities to stage

function generateStagingList(predictedFootTraffic, predictedItemDemand, merchantLayout):

    // Calculate staging priority based on foot traffic & item demand
    for each item in predictedItemDemand:
        item.stagingPriority = predictedFootTraffic * predictedItemDemand[item].demandQuantity

    // Sort items by staging priority (descending)
    sortedItems = sort(sortedItems, key=stagingPriority, reverse=true)

    // Determine staging locations based on merchant layout & available space
    stagingList = []
    for each item in sortedItems:
        stagingLocation = findOptimalStagingLocation(item, merchantLayout) //Uses algorithm that considers proximity to entrance and existing stock levels
        stagingQuantity = min(item.stagingQuantity, availableStagingSpace(stagingLocation))
        stagingList.append((stagingLocation, stagingQuantity))

    return stagingList
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Dynamic Pricing Integration:** Adjust pricing on high-demand items in real-time based on predicted demand to maximize revenue.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Use customer order history to anticipate individual preferences and pre-stage items they are likely to purchase.
*   **Automated Inventory Replenishment:** Trigger automated restocking orders based on predicted demand and current inventory levels.
*   **Crowd Flow Optimization:** Integrate with digital signage to guide customers to less congested areas of the store.
