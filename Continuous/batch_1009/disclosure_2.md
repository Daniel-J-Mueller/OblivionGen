**Dynamic Resolution Mesh for Panoramic Capture & Display**

**Concept:** Extend the multi-camera stitching concept to incorporate a dynamic, resolution-adjustable mesh projected onto the captured scene. This mesh dictates resolution based on importance â€“ areas with high detail or user focus receive higher resolution capture and display, while less critical areas use lower resolution.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Minimum of three image sensors (as per base patent). Increased sensor count (5-7) recommended for broader coverage & more granular control. Sensors are calibrated for intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
*   **Depth Sensing:** Integrate a time-of-flight (ToF) or structured light depth sensor to generate a real-time depth map of the scene.  This is crucial for dynamic mesh projection.
*   **Mesh Generation:**
    *   Depth data is processed to create a 3D point cloud representing the captured scene.
    *   A polygonal mesh is generated over this point cloud. Initial mesh density is medium.
    *   **Importance Mapping:**  An algorithm analyzes the scene based on the following criteria:
        *   **Texture Density:** Areas with high texture (e.g., foliage, patterned surfaces) receive higher mesh density.
        *   **Object Recognition:** Use object detection (AI/ML) to identify salient objects (faces, vehicles, landmarks). These areas receive high mesh density.
        *   **User Gaze Tracking:** (Optional, but highly desirable) Integrate eye-tracking to determine where the user is looking. The mesh is dynamically refined around the user's gaze point.
    *   The mesh is dynamically refined.  Polygons in areas of high importance are subdivided, increasing resolution. Polygons in areas of low importance are coarsened, reducing resolution.
*   **Variable Capture Resolution:**
    *   Each image sensor is assigned a portion of the dynamic mesh.
    *   The system calculates the optimal capture resolution for each sensor based on the resolution of the mesh polygons within its assigned area.
    *   Sensors with regions of high-resolution mesh polygons capture at a higher frame rate and/or with higher dynamic range.
*   **Stitching & Rendering:**
    *   Image stitching is performed using the dynamic mesh as a guide.
    *   The mesh is used for texture mapping, allowing for seamless blending of images from different sensors.
    *   Rendering is performed using a view-dependent technique. Regions of the image that are closer to the viewer are rendered with higher detail, while regions that are farther away are rendered with lower detail.
*   **Display Adaptation:**
    *   The panoramic image is projected onto a display (e.g., a curved screen, a VR headset).
    *   The rendering pipeline adjusts the level of detail based on the display resolution and viewing distance.

**Pseudocode (Mesh Refinement):**

```
function refineMesh(depthMap, sceneAnalysisResults):
    mesh = createBaseMesh(depthMap)
    for polygon in mesh:
        importance = calculateImportance(polygon, sceneAnalysisResults)
        if importance > threshold:
            subdivide(polygon) // Increase polygon density
        else if importance < lowThreshold:
            coarsen(polygon) // Decrease polygon density
    return mesh
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-fidelity virtual reality experiences.
*   Advanced surveillance systems.
*   Next-generation automotive camera systems.
*   Interactive panoramic displays.
