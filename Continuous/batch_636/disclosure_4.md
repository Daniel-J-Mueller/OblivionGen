## Modular Environmental Sensor Array - Junction Box Integration

**Concept:** Expand the junction box A/V device into a comprehensive environmental monitoring hub. Leverage the existing power and mounting infrastructure to deploy a network of localized sensors.

**Specs:**

*   **Base Unit:** Retains core A/V functionality (camera, speaker, microphone, button) of the provided patent. Dimensions remain within the specified limits (height < 94.37mm, width < 47.59mm, depth < 40.20mm).
*   **Sensor Modules:** Interchangeable modules that connect to the base unit via a standardized connector (likely a multi-pin, weatherproof connector – Molex Micro-Fit 3.0 suggested). Each module adds a specific sensing capability.
*   **Module Types (Initial Set):**
    *   **Temperature/Humidity:** Measures ambient temperature and humidity.
    *   **Air Quality:** Detects levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), CO2, and particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10).  Utilizes MEMS-based gas sensors.
    *   **Motion/Occupancy (Beyond Button):**  Passive infrared (PIR) sensor for broader area motion detection.  Can be used for security or smart home automation.
    *   **Light Level/UV:** Measures ambient light intensity and UV radiation levels.
    *   **Sound Level:** Measures decibel levels for noise monitoring.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Utilizes Power over Ethernet (PoE) for power and data.  Supports standard Ethernet protocols (TCP/IP, UDP).  Can also incorporate a low-power wireless protocol (Zigbee or Z-Wave) for local device communication and redundancy.
*   **Data Storage & Processing:**  Base unit incorporates a small microcontroller with onboard storage (SD card) for local data logging.  Data is transmitted to a central server (cloud-based or on-premise) for analysis and visualization. Edge computing capabilities allow for some local data processing (e.g., anomaly detection).
*   **Mounting:** Designed for flush mounting within a standard single-gang junction box.  The base unit includes mounting tabs that align with the junction box openings. Sensor modules extend slightly beyond the front faceplate but remain within a compact profile.
*   **Power:** PoE.  A 24V passive PoE injector would be preferred.

**Pseudocode (Data Flow):**

```
LOOP:
    READ sensor data from attached modules
    TIMESTAMP data
    STORE data locally (SD card)
    SEND data to central server (TCP/IP over Ethernet)
    IF connection lost:
        STORE data locally until connection restored
    CHECK for local processing triggers (e.g., high VOC levels)
    IF trigger activated:
        ACTIVATE local alert (e.g., flash LED on base unit)
ENDLOOP
```

**Innovation Details:**

This isn’t just a camera in a box anymore. The modular design allows users to customize the system to their specific needs. Imagine a smart home system that not only provides video surveillance but also monitors air quality, detects leaks, and adjusts HVAC settings automatically. The PoE implementation minimizes wiring complexity and provides a reliable power source.  The combination of local storage and cloud connectivity ensures data redundancy and accessibility.
