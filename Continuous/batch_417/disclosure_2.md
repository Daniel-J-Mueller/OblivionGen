## Adaptive Prefetching based on Token Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the token-based access tracking to proactively prefetch data or instructions *before* the full set of access requests is received, anticipating the integrated circuit component's needs and reducing overall latency. This moves beyond simply notifying completion to actively preparing for execution *during* the access sequence.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Token Prediction Engine (TPE):** A dedicated hardware unit integrated into the memory controller. This engine maintains a history of token access patterns.  It will be implemented via a lookup table and associated logic.
*   **Prefetch Buffer:** A small, high-speed buffer within the memory controller to hold prefetched data/instructions. This buffer is separate from the main cache hierarchy.
*   **Access Pattern Logger:**  Records token sequences along with associated access counts.  This data feeds the TPE.  It is a circular buffer with timestamping.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjuster:** A logic unit that dynamically adjusts prefetch thresholds based on observed access patterns and system load.

**2. Software/Firmware Components:**

*   **Token Registration Module:** A driver/firmware module that registers tokens with the memory controller, providing initial access count information.
*   **Performance Monitoring Agent:**  A software agent that monitors prefetch hit rates and adjusts TPE parameters (e.g., prediction window size, confidence thresholds).

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Token Registration:** When a new token is encountered, the sender registers it with the memory controller, providing the initial access count.
2.  **Access Tracking:** The memory controller tracks access requests associated with each token, incrementing the counter.
3.  **Pattern Prediction:** The TPE analyzes the access pattern based on the logged token sequence.  It predicts the likely next memory addresses/data to be requested. This uses a Markov Model, with states defined by token sequences.
4.  **Prefetching:** Based on the prediction, the memory controller proactively prefetches data/instructions into the Prefetch Buffer. A 'confidence level' is associated with each prefetch request.
5.  **Hit/Miss Tracking:**  When the integrated circuit component requests data, the memory controller checks if it's available in the Prefetch Buffer.  Hit/Miss events are tracked for performance monitoring.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Performance Monitoring Agent analyzes hit rates and adjusts the prediction algorithm and prefetch thresholds. If confidence level is low, the prefetch is throttled.

**4. Pseudocode (TPE Prediction Algorithm):**

```
function predictNextAccess(current_token_sequence, access_pattern_log):
  // Lookup recent sequences in the access_pattern_log
  recent_sequences = findSimilarSequences(current_token_sequence, access_pattern_log, window_size)

  if recent_sequences is empty:
    // No recent similar sequences.  Return default prediction.
    return defaultPrediction()

  // Calculate the probability of each next address based on recent sequences
  next_address_probabilities = calculateProbabilities(next_addresses_from(recent_sequences))

  // Select the most probable next address
  predicted_address = max(next_address_probabilities)

  return predicted_address
```

**5. Data Structures:**

*   **Token Table:** Key = Token, Value = {Counter, Access Count, Last Access Time}
*   **Access Pattern Log:**  List of {Token Sequence, Access Addresses, Timestamp}
*   **Prefetch Buffer:** FIFO queue of {Address, Data}

**6. Potential Optimizations:**

*   **Hierarchical Prefetching:**  Use multiple levels of prediction (e.g., coarse-grained prefetching based on token, fine-grained prefetching based on address history).
*   **Speculative Execution:**  Prefetch data speculatively based on prediction, and roll back if prediction is incorrect.
*   **Cooperative Prefetching:**  Coordinate prefetching across multiple memory controllers.
