## Autonomous Sorting & Inventory System â€“ Mobile Platform Adaptation

**System Overview:** A mobile platform integrating advanced weight sensing, imaging, and robotic manipulation for autonomous item sorting and inventory management within a shopping cart environment.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Modified Mobile Platform:** Existing cart chassis, upper frame, and wheel system retained. Significant modifications to basket and shelf structures are required.
2.  **Segmented Basket/Shelf System:**
    *   Basket and shelf divided into multiple, individually weighable compartments (minimum 8, adjustable size). Each compartment will have a dedicated load cell beneath its floor.
    *   Compartment floors constructed from rigid, low-friction material for smooth item transfer.
    *   Compartment walls are low-height, but feature retractable dividers for customizable space allocation.
3.  **Robotic Manipulation System:**
    *   A small, lightweight robotic arm (4-DOF minimum) mounted to the upper frame, positioned to access both basket and shelf compartments.
    *   End-effector: Soft-grip pneumatic or electrostatic gripper capable of handling diverse item shapes and materials.
    *   Powered by a dedicated battery pack (separate from the main cart battery) with runtime of 60+ minutes.
4.  **Imaging System:**
    *   Multiple high-resolution cameras (RGB-D preferred) positioned for full visual coverage of basket and shelf.
    *   Integrated with object recognition AI (cloud-based or edge-processed) for item identification, size/shape estimation, and damage detection.
5.  **Control System:**
    *   Embedded microcontroller (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) for real-time sensor data processing, robotic arm control, and communication.
    *   Wireless connectivity (Bluetooth/WiFi) for data transmission to external systems (e.g., store inventory management, customer app).

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Initialization:** System calibrates weight sensors and verifies camera functionality.
2.  **Item Placement:** Customer places items in either the basket or shelf.
3.  **Autonomous Scanning & Identification:**
    *   Cameras capture images of all items.
    *   Object recognition AI identifies each item, determines its weight (using initial readings), and estimates its size/shape.
4.  **Automated Sorting (Optional):**
    *   If enabled (configurable through a user interface), the robotic arm picks up items and moves them to designated compartments based on pre-defined rules (e.g., fragile items to a padded compartment, cold items to an insulated compartment).
5.  **Real-Time Inventory Tracking:**
    *   Weight sensors continuously monitor the weight of each compartment.
    *   Data is transmitted wirelessly to a store inventory management system, providing real-time information on item quantities and location within the cart.
6.  **Checkout Integration:**
    *   At checkout, the system automatically generates a list of items in the cart, including quantities and weights.
    *   This data can be used to verify the accuracy of the checkout process and reduce the risk of theft.

**Pseudocode (Item Identification & Sorting):**

```
// Loop through each compartment
for (int i = 0; i < numCompartments; i++) {
  // Read weight from compartment
  weight = readWeight(i);

  // If weight is above threshold
  if (weight > weightThreshold) {
    // Capture image of compartment
    image = captureImage(i);

    // Run object recognition AI
    item = recognizeItem(image);

    // If item is recognized
    if (item != null) {
      // Check sorting rules
      if (item.isFragile) {
        // Move item to padded compartment
        moveItem(i, paddedCompartment);
      } else if (item.requiresCooling) {
        // Move item to insulated compartment
        moveItem(i, insulatedCompartment);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Power Requirements:**

*   Main Cart Battery: Powers mobility, lighting, and control system.
*   Robotic Arm Battery: Separate battery pack for robotic arm operation (estimated 12V, 5Ah).
*   Sensor & Imaging System: Powered by main cart battery (estimated 24V, 100W).

**Materials:**

*   Cart Frame: High-strength aluminum alloy.
*   Basket/Shelf: Molded ABS plastic with reinforced dividers.
*   Compartment Floors: Low-friction polymer.
*   Robotic Arm: Lightweight carbon fiber composite.
