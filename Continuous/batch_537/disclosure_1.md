## Adaptive Resource Persona System

**Core Concept:** Dynamically construct and maintain “resource personas” based on observed graph behavior, leveraging machine learning to predict potential threats *before* they manifest as rule violations. This shifts the security posture from reactive (rule-based) to proactive (predictive).

**Specifications:**

1.  **Persona Construction Module:**
    *   Input: The resource graph generated by the existing system (nodes and edges representing resources and their relationships).  A time-series of these graphs (historical data).
    *   Process: Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, Gaussian Mixture Models) on the nodes of the graph, grouping nodes with similar connectivity patterns, resource types, and measured characteristics (from introspection points). These clusters *define* the resource personas.
    *   Output: A list of resource personas, each described by:
        *   A representative node (or set of nodes) for identification.
        *   Cluster membership – which nodes belong to this persona.
        *   Statistical profile of measured characteristics (mean, standard deviation, ranges) for nodes within the persona.
        *   Historical behavior data (time-series of characteristic measurements).

2.  **Behavioral Anomaly Detection Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time resource graph data and the defined resource personas.
    *   Process: For each node in the current graph:
        *   Identify the node’s primary resource persona.
        *   Compare the node's current measured characteristics to the statistical profile of its persona.
        *   Employ a time-series anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., LSTM autoencoders, Prophet) to predict expected values based on historical persona behavior.
        *   Calculate an anomaly score based on the difference between predicted and observed values.
    *   Output: An anomaly score for each node in the graph, indicating the degree to which its behavior deviates from its expected persona profile.

3.  **Threat Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Anomaly scores, resource graph, and a threat model (similar to Claim 3, but dynamically updated).
    *   Process:
        *   Propagate anomaly scores through the graph along edges, attenuating the score based on edge weight (relationship strength).
        *   Identify subgraphs with high cumulative anomaly scores.
        *   Match these subgraphs against known threat patterns in the dynamic threat model. The threat model isn't static, it learns from past anomalies.
        *   Prioritize potential threats based on anomaly score, subgraph characteristics, and threat model confidence.
    *   Output: A prioritized list of potential threats, with associated confidence scores and affected resources.

4.  **Adaptive Security Action Module:**
    *   Input: Prioritized threat list and system configuration.
    *   Process:
        *   Dynamically adjust security policies based on predicted threats.  For example, increase monitoring frequency for affected resources, restrict network access, or isolate compromised nodes.
        *   Trigger automated remediation actions, such as patching vulnerabilities or restarting services.
        *   Alert security personnel to high-confidence threats, providing detailed information about the affected resources and the predicted attack vector.

**Pseudocode (Threat Prediction Engine - Simplified):**

```pseudocode
function predictThreats(graph, personas, threatModel):
  anomalyScores = calculateNodeAnomalies(graph, personas)
  propagatedScores = propagateAnomalies(graph, anomalyScores)
  suspiciousSubgraphs = identifySuspiciousSubgraphs(graph, propagatedScores)
  threats = matchSubgraphsToThreatModel(suspiciousSubgraphs, threatModel)
  return prioritizeThreats(threats)

function calculateNodeAnomalies(graph, personas):
  for each node in graph:
    persona = findPersona(node, personas)
    anomalyScore = calculateAnomaly(node, persona)
    return anomalyScore

function propagateAnomalies(graph, anomalyScores):
  for each node in graph:
    for each neighbor of node:
      neighborAnomalyScore = neighborAnomalyScore + (nodeAnomalyScore / edgeWeight)
  return propagatedScores
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple rule violation detection to *predict* threats based on learned behavior patterns and graph analysis, creating a more proactive and adaptable security posture. The dynamic threat model ensures the system remains effective against evolving attack vectors.
