## Modular Haptic Feedback System for Mobile Device Testing

**Concept:** Expand the mobile device test module to include a localized, configurable haptic feedback system allowing for automated testing of touch-based user interactions beyond simple touch registration. This goes beyond simulating touches; it allows for the *feeling* of textures, buttons, and complex interactions to be tested algorithmically.

**Specifications:**

**1. Haptic Array Module:**

*   **Form Factor:** A replaceable module designed to interface with the existing mobile device test module housing. Dimensions: 5cm x 5cm x 1cm.
*   **Actuator Type:** Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based piezoelectric actuators. Density: 200 actuators/cm².
*   **Force Range:** 0.1N – 2N per actuator, individually controllable.
*   **Frequency Response:** 10Hz – 1kHz, allowing for simulation of varying textures and dynamic feedback.
*   **Surface Material:** Flexible, durable polymer coating with a coefficient of friction adjustable via software.  Initial options: Smooth, rubberized, textured.
*   **Interface:** Dedicated high-speed data and power connector to the host processing circuitry.

**2. Software Control Layer:**

*   **API:** Python-based API for scripting haptic feedback sequences.  Functions: `set_actuator_force(actuator_id, force)`, `play_texture(texture_name)`, `simulate_button_press(button_location, duration)`.
*   **Texture Library:** Pre-defined library of common textures (wood, metal, fabric, glass) represented as actuator force maps. Users can add and customize textures.
*   **Dynamic Feedback Engine:** Algorithm for generating dynamic haptic feedback based on on-screen events. Example: Simulating the feel of scrolling through a list, dragging an icon, or interacting with a virtual object.
*   **Synchronization:** Synchronization with the mobile device’s display and sensors to ensure accurate haptic feedback.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Ability to monitor actuator performance and identify potential failures.

**3. Integration with Existing Test Module:**

*   **Mounting:** The Haptic Array Module will mount into a dedicated slot within the existing test module housing, replacing a blank panel.
*   **Power:** Powered by the existing test module’s power supply.
*   **Communication:** Communicates with the host processing circuitry via the existing data bus.
*   **Calibration:** Automated calibration procedure to compensate for variations in actuator performance.

**4. Pseudocode – Dynamic Texture Generation:**

```python
# Input: Image data (grayscale)
# Output: Actuator force map

def generate_texture_map(image_data):
    # Normalize pixel values to 0-1
    normalized_data = [pixel / 255.0 for pixel in image_data]

    # Map normalized values to force range
    force_map = [min(2.0, pixel * 1.5) for pixel in normalized_data] # Scale and cap force

    return force_map

#Example Usage
image = load_image("wood_grain.png")
texture_map = generate_texture_map(image)
set_actuator_forces(texture_map)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated testing of touch screen responsiveness and accuracy.
*   Evaluation of haptic feedback algorithms for different applications.
*   Comparative analysis of haptic feedback performance across different mobile devices.
*   Development of new haptic feedback algorithms for enhanced user experience.
