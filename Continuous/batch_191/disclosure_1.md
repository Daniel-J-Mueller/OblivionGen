## Dynamic Glyph Weighting for Stylistic Variation

**Concept:** Expand beyond static advance tables by introducing dynamic glyph weighting based on surrounding glyphs *and* stylistic preferences defined by the user or application. This allows for nuanced control over the visual flow and perceived “weight” of text beyond simple kerning.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure: Stylistic Context Table (SCT).** This table supplements the existing advance table. It stores weight modifiers for each glyph *based on* the preceding and following glyphs, *and* a ‘style key’. The style key represents a user-defined or application-defined stylistic preference (e.g., 'formal', 'casual', 'compressed', 'expanded', 'handwritten').
*   **SCT Entry Format:** `(PrecedingGlyphID, FollowingGlyphID, StyleKey, WeightModifier)`
    *   `PrecedingGlyphID`: Identifier of the glyph immediately preceding the current glyph.
    *   `FollowingGlyphID`: Identifier of the glyph immediately following the current glyph.
    *   `StyleKey`: String identifier for the stylistic preference.
    *   `WeightModifier`: Floating-point value representing the multiplicative factor applied to the base advance width. (e.g., 0.8 for compression, 1.2 for expansion).
*   **Rendering Pipeline Modification:**
    1.  **Base Advance Width:** Retrieve the base advance width from the standard advance table.
    2.  **Context Lookup:** Given the current glyph, preceding glyph, following glyph, and active style key, query the SCT for a matching entry.
    3.  **Weight Application:** If a match is found, multiply the base advance width by the `WeightModifier`.
    4.  **Final Advance Width:** Use the resulting value as the final advance width for rendering. If no match is found, use the base advance width.
*   **Font File Format Extension:** A new table within the font file will store the SCT. The table will include a version number and a flag indicating whether the SCT is enabled.
*   **API Extension:**
    *   `SetStyleKey(styleKey)`: Function to set the current stylistic preference. This affects the weighting of glyphs during rendering.
    *   `GetGlyphAdvanceWidth(glyphID, precedingGlyphID, followingGlyphID)`: Function to retrieve the calculated advance width for a glyph, taking into account the surrounding glyphs and the active style key.
*   **Example:**
    *   Glyph 'T' following 'h' in 'formal' style might have a weight modifier of 0.9 (slightly compressed).
    *   Glyph 'T' following 'h' in 'casual' style might have a weight modifier of 1.1 (slightly expanded).
    *   Glyph 'T' following a space in 'formal' style might have a weight modifier of 1.05 (subtle increase in spacing for elegance).

**Pseudocode (Rendering):**

```
function renderGlyph(glyphID, precedingGlyphID, followingGlyphID, styleKey):
  baseWidth = getAdvanceWidth(glyphID)  // From standard advance table
  modifier = lookupWeightModifier(glyphID, precedingGlyphID, followingGlyphID, styleKey) // Query SCT
  if modifier != null:
    finalWidth = baseWidth * modifier
  else:
    finalWidth = baseWidth
  drawGlyph(glyphID, finalWidth)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Highly customizable typography.
*   Dynamic adjustment of text appearance based on context.
*   Improved readability and visual appeal.
*   Support for nuanced stylistic variations beyond simple font selection.
