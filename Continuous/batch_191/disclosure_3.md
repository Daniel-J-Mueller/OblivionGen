## Adaptive Soundtrack Generation via Entity Emotional State

**Concept:** Extend the time-indexed entity information to drive dynamic music generation, creating a soundtrack that evolves *with* the characters and their relationships as presented in the media content.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotional State Mapping:** Develop a lexicon mapping entity descriptions (from the patent's inferred relationships) to emotional states. This isn't simple 'happy/sad', but granular: 'apprehensive anticipation', 'bittersweet longing', 'righteous indignation', etc.  The lexicon is trainable; new emotional states can be added via user feedback (see section 4).
2.  **Musical Motif Assignment:** Assign unique musical motifs (short melodic/harmonic ideas) to each major entity. These motifs represent the 'sonic identity' of the character.
3.  **Dynamic Composition Engine:** A real-time composition engine that utilizes the following inputs:
    *   Current time in the media content.
    *   Entity descriptions (from the existing patent system) for entities *currently* visible or actively involved in the scene.
    *   Emotional state mappings for those entities.
    *   Relationships between those entities (also from the existing system).
    *   A library of instrumental sounds and musical building blocks.
4.  **Composition Rules:** Establish rules for how the musical motifs and sounds are combined based on the emotional states and relationships.  Examples:
    *   **Emotional Resonance:** If two entities with opposing emotional states are interacting, dissonant harmonies are introduced.
    *   **Relationship Emphasis:**  If a relationship is strengthening, the musical motifs of the two entities blend and harmonize. If a relationship is deteriorating, the motifs become fragmented or clash.
    *   **Emotional Arc:**  As an entity’s emotional state evolves (inferred from the time-indexed descriptions), the musical motif gradually transforms to reflect that change.
5.  **User Feedback Loop:**  Allow users to provide feedback on the generated soundtrack.  This feedback isn't about musical quality, but about *emotional appropriateness*.
    *   A simple interface: "Does this music *feel* right for this scene?" (Yes/No).
    *   Option to specify *which* entity’s emotional state is misrepresented by the music.
    *   This feedback is used to refine the emotional state mapping lexicon and composition rules.
6.  **Scene Detection:** Implement a scene detection algorithm to transition the music appropriately between different settings and situations.
7.  **Integration with Existing System:** The existing time-indexed entity information system becomes the core input for the dynamic music generation engine. 

**Pseudocode (Simplified Composition Engine):**

```
function composeMusic(currentTime, visibleEntities):
  sceneType = detectSceneType(currentTime)
  baseTempo = determineTempoForScene(sceneType)
  musicTrack = new MusicTrack(baseTempo)

  for each entity in visibleEntities:
    entityDescription = getTimeIndexedEntityDescription(entity, currentTime)
    emotionalState = mapEntityDescriptionToEmotionalState(entityDescription)
    motif = getEntityMotif(entity)
    
    adaptedMotif = adaptMotifForEmotionalState(motif, emotionalState) 
    
    musicTrack.addInstrument(adaptedMotif, emotionalState.intensity)
    
  # Relationship blending (simplified)
  for each pair of entities:
    relationshipStrength = getRelationshipStrength(entity1, entity2)
    if relationshipStrength > threshold:
      blendMotifs(entity1.motif, entity2.motif)

  return musicTrack
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply playing pre-composed music or selecting a mood-based soundtrack. It's about *procedural generation* of music that is directly tied to the evolving emotional landscape of the characters and their relationships, informed by the time-indexed data already being collected. The user feedback loop allows for continuous refinement and personalization.
