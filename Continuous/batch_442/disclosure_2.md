## Adaptive Iconography – Dynamic Symbolism

**Concept:** A display system where icons aren’t static images, but fluid, animated representations *directly influenced by real-time data* related to the app/function they represent. Beyond simple progress bars, these icons *morph* in complexity, color, and motion to communicate nuanced status.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Input:** System accepts a stream of numerical and categorical data related to the function the icon represents. Examples: network latency, CPU usage, data transfer rate, number of unread messages, battery charge level, sensor readings.
*   **Icon Primitives:** A library of core visual “primitives” is required. These are basic shapes, lines, particles, and color gradients. These will be the building blocks of the animated icons. Think procedural generation.
*   **Mapping Functions:**  A set of configurable mapping functions. These functions translate data inputs into parameters controlling the icon primitives. Examples:
    *   `Latency -> Wave Amplitude`: Higher latency causes a wave-like animation within the icon to become more erratic and higher in amplitude.
    *   `CPU Usage -> Icon Complexity`: Higher CPU usage causes more particles to be spawned within the icon, or increases the intricacy of a shape.
    *   `Data Transfer Rate -> Color Saturation`:  Faster transfer rates increase color saturation/brightness.
    *   `Battery Level -> Icon Scale/Rotation`: Lower battery levels cause the icon to shrink or slowly rotate, indicating critical status.
*   **Animation Engine:**  A lightweight animation engine capable of real-time rendering of the procedurally generated icon animations.  Must support smooth transitions and variable frame rates.
*   **Icon Profiles:**  Each app/function will have an associated "Icon Profile" defining the mapping functions, primitive selections, and overall visual style.  Profiles should be editable at runtime.
*   **Rendering Pipeline:**
    1.  Receive data stream for a given app/function.
    2.  Load associated Icon Profile.
    3.  Apply mapping functions to transform data into animation parameters.
    4.  Generate icon animation based on parameters and selected primitives.
    5.  Render animation frame.
    6.  Repeat steps 1-5 continuously.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Example – Latency Icon):**

```
function generateLatencyIcon(latency_ms):
  amplitude = map(latency_ms, 0, 200, 10, 50)  // Scale latency to amplitude
  frequency = 0.5 + (latency_ms / 500)  // Increase frequency with latency
  wave_color = color(100, 100, 255)
  
  drawWave(amplitude, frequency, wave_color)
  
  // Wave Drawing Function (details omitted for brevity)
```

**Novelty:**  Existing icons typically provide static or pre-defined animated states. This system generates *unique*, data-driven animations, providing a richer and more immediate understanding of system status. The visual complexity becomes a direct indication of underlying activity. The user's eye is drawn to areas of the display indicating higher load.
