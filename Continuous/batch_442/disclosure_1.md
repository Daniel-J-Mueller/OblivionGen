**Adaptive Virtual Network 'Sensing' & Dynamic Subnet Allocation**

**Specification:**

1.  **Core Concept:** Implement a system where virtual networks aren't statically defined by user configuration but *learn* application communication patterns and dynamically adjust subnet allocations/segmentation. This moves beyond topology definition to topology *discovery* and adaptation.

2.  **Components:**
    *   **Network Sensor Modules (NSM):** Lightweight agents deployed within each virtual machine instance. NSMs passively monitor outgoing and incoming network traffic (metadata only - source/destination IP, port, protocol, packet size - *no* payload inspection).
    *   **Centralized Learning Engine (CLE):** A machine learning model (e.g., graph neural network) that aggregates data from NSMs. The CLE constructs a real-time communication graph representing application interactions within the virtual network.
    *   **Dynamic Subnet Allocator (DSA):**  Based on the communication graph, the DSA dynamically allocates/adjusts subnet boundaries.  High-communication nodes are placed within the same subnet for minimized latency. Low-communication/isolated nodes are segmented for enhanced security.
    *   **Virtual Network Controller (VNC):**  Responsible for enacting subnet changes requested by the DSA. It updates routing tables, firewall rules, and ARP spoofing configurations.

3.  **Operation:**
    *   Initial Network State: Upon VM instantiation, all VMs are initially placed in a default subnet.
    *   Traffic Monitoring: NSMs continuously monitor network traffic.
    *   Graph Construction: Data is sent to the CLE, which constructs and updates the communication graph.
    *   Subnet Optimization: The CLE analyzes the graph and identifies subnet optimization opportunities (e.g., merging subnets, splitting subnets, moving VMs).
    *   DSA Request: The CLE sends a request to the DSA to enact the changes.
    *   VNC Implementation: The DSA instructs the VNC to modify the network configuration accordingly.

4.  **Pseudocode (DSA - Simplified):**

```
function optimize_subnets(communication_graph):
  subnets = current_network_configuration()
  potential_changes = []

  for node1 in communication_graph.nodes:
    for node2 in communication_graph.nodes:
      if node1 != node2 and communication_graph.edge_weight(node1, node2) > threshold:
        if node1.subnet != node2.subnet:
          potential_changes.append(move_node(node1, node2.subnet))

  for subnet in subnets:
    if subnet.node_count < min_subnet_size:
      potential_changes.append(merge_subnet(subnet, find_closest_subnet(subnet)))

  # Evaluate cost/benefit of potential changes (latency vs security)
  best_changes = evaluate_changes(potential_changes)

  apply_changes(best_changes)
```

5.  **Advanced Features:**

    *   **Anomaly Detection:** The communication graph can be used to detect anomalous traffic patterns, indicating potential security threats.
    *   **Application-Aware Segmentation:** Integrate with application identification services to automatically segment networks based on application type (e.g., isolate database servers).
    *   **Predictive Subnet Allocation:** Use historical traffic data to predict future communication patterns and proactively allocate subnets.
    *   **Multi-Tenant Awareness:**  Partition the learning engine to prevent cross-tenant information leakage in multi-tenant environments.
    *    **Resource Cost Modelling:** Consider physical infrastructure costs when re-allocating traffic and subnets.
