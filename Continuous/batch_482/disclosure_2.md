## Dynamic Cookie ‘Lifecycles’ Based on Behavioral Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the cookie sharing concept by incorporating predicted user behavior to dynamically adjust cookie lifecycles and access permissions, moving beyond simple classification and sharing attributes.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors user interactions across all network sites visited (with explicit user consent, naturally).
*   **Data Points:** Tracks page view frequency, time spent on site, types of content consumed (categories, keywords), form submissions (limited to non-sensitive data), clickstream data.  Stores this data locally, anonymized, on the client computing device.
*   **Privacy Focus:** Data is pseudonymized with a rotating identifier.  Users have full control over data retention and can opt-out entirely.  Differential privacy techniques are employed to add noise and protect individual data points.

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Utilizes a locally-trained machine learning model (potentially a recurrent neural network or transformer model) to predict short-term user intent and potential future site visits.  Training data is derived from the Behavioral Data Collection Module.  The model predicts probabilities for different categories of websites (e.g., news, shopping, social media, travel).
*   **Model Updates:**  The model is continuously retrained with new behavioral data, adapting to changing user patterns.
*   **Resource Management:** Model size and complexity are dynamically adjusted based on available client-side resources (CPU, memory).

**3. Dynamic Cookie Lifecycle Manager:**

*   **Function:** Controls cookie access and expiration based on predicted user behavior.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **High Probability Match:** If the Predictive Modeling Engine identifies a high probability of the user visiting a new site within a short timeframe (e.g., 5 minutes), and that site falls into a relevant category based on the user’s existing cookies, those cookies are proactively made available (with user consent).
    *   **Low Probability/Category Mismatch:** If the probability is low, or the category doesn’t align with existing cookies, the cookies remain restricted.
    *   **Cookie ‘Boosting’:**  Cookies deemed ‘important’ (e.g., authentication, preferences) can be ‘boosted’ to have longer lifecycles and wider availability.
    *   **Contextual Expiration:**  Cookies expire automatically if the predicted behavior doesn't materialize within a specific timeframe. (e.g., user doesn't visit a predicted shopping site within 24 hours).
*   **Sharing Attribute Integration:** Existing sharing attributes continue to function as a baseline for cookie access. Dynamic adjustments are applied on top of these attributes.

**4. Network Service Integration (Optional):**

*   A lightweight network service can be used to provide additional context about websites (e.g., trustworthiness, privacy policies).  This service is used *only* to augment the local prediction model and does not store any user data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On each page load:
userBehaviorData = CollectUserBehaviorData()
predictedSites = PredictNextSites(userBehaviorData)

for site in predictedSites:
  if site.category matches existingCookieCategories:
    // Check existing sharing attribute
    if cookie.sharingAttribute == ALLOW:
      //Grant cookie access
      GrantCookieAccess(cookie, site)
    else:
      // Prompt user for consent
      PromptUserConsent(cookie, site)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard client computing device (desktop, laptop, mobile)
*   Sufficient processing power and memory to run the Predictive Modeling Engine.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Browser application with integration of the Dynamic Cookie Lifecycle Manager.
*   Local machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, Core ML).
