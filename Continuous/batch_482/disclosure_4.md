## Dynamic Spectrum Shaping with Predictive AGC

**Concept:** Extend the AGC system to proactively *shape* the received spectrum based on anticipated signal characteristics, improving performance in dynamic RF environments and enabling more aggressive modulation schemes.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A "Spectral Prediction Engine" (SPE) integrated with the existing AGC circuitry.
*   **SPE Input:**  Real-time RF signal analysis (frequency, amplitude, modulation type) and environmental data (historical RF usage patterns, known interference sources, geolocation data). This data is sourced from both the received signal *and* a cloud-based RF map database.
*   **SPE Processing:** The SPE uses machine learning (specifically, recurrent neural networks) to predict the spectral characteristics of the incoming signal *over the next symbol period*. This includes predicting frequency drift, amplitude variations, and potential interference.
*   **AGC Modification:** Instead of simply compressing/amplifying based on immediate signal strength, the AGC now adjusts the FEM gain *and* applies dynamic frequency weighting (using digital filtering within the FEM) to *pre-shape* the spectrum *before* the signal reaches the detector.
*   **Frequency Weighting:** This dynamic weighting emphasizes predicted strong signal frequencies and attenuates predicted interference/noise frequencies. The weighting coefficients are calculated by the SPE and applied in real-time.
*   **Variable Filtering:** Implement multiple parallel digital filters within the FEM, each with a different frequency response. The SPE selects the optimal filter combination based on its prediction.
*   **AGC Control Loop Integration:** The SPE becomes an integral part of the AGC control loop, providing a predictive "setpoint" for the AGC. The AGC then adjusts the FEM gain to meet this predictive setpoint.
*   **Cloud Integration:**  The cloud component is crucial for sharing RF environment data between devices.  Devices contribute their local RF measurements, creating a real-time map of RF conditions.
*   **Data Format:**  SPE output is a vector of weighting coefficients, one for each frequency bin within the signal bandwidth. This vector is updated at the symbol rate.

**Pseudocode (Simplified SPE):**

```
// Inputs:  RF Signal Data, Historical RF Map, Current Location
// Outputs: Weighting Vector (frequency-domain coefficients)

function predict_spectrum(rf_data, rf_map, location):
  // 1. Analyze RF Data: Extract frequency, amplitude, modulation info
  features = analyze_rf(rf_data)

  // 2. Retrieve Historical Data from RF Map
  historical_data = get_historical_data(location, rf_map)

  // 3. Train RNN Model (Pre-trained, continuously updated)
  model = load_model()
  model.train(features, historical_data) // Continuous online learning

  // 4. Predict Future Spectrum
  predicted_spectrum = model.predict() // Output: Frequency-domain magnitude

  // 5. Generate Weighting Vector
  weighting_vector = normalize(predicted_spectrum) // Scale to 0-1

  return weighting_vector
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance DSP within the FEM.
*   Fast ADC/DAC for digital filtering.
*   Dedicated hardware accelerator for RNN inference (optional).
*   Reliable wireless communication for cloud connectivity.
