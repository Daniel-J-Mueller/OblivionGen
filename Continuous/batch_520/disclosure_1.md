## Dynamic Behavior Contracts with AI-Driven Prediction

**Specification:** A system for predictive refinement of behavior element selection based on user interaction data and AI modeling.

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing data contract system to incorporate a predictive layer. Rather than solely relying on predefined rules and costs for behavior element selection, leverage user interaction data to *predict* the efficacy of different behavior elements in real-time and dynamically adjust selections.

**Components:**

1.  **Interaction Data Collector:**
    *   Captures user interactions with the generated network page (clicks, hovers, form field focus, time spent on sections, etc.).
    *   Data is anonymized and aggregated.
    *   Stores data in a time-series database.

2.  **AI Prediction Model:**
    *   A machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a transformer model) trained on historical interaction data.
    *   Input: Data contract details, current document object model (DOM) structure, user context (if available and permissible), anonymized interaction data.
    *   Output: Predicted "success rate" (or other relevant metric) for each available behavior element *given the current context*.  A confidence score is also generated.

3.  **Dynamic Behavior Selector:**
    *   Integrates with the existing behavior selection logic.
    *   Before selecting a behavior element, queries the AI Prediction Model for predicted success rates.
    *   Adjusts selection criteria based on predicted success rates:
        *   Higher predicted success rates are weighted more heavily in the selection process.
        *   Low-confidence predictions trigger a fallback to default rule-based selection.
        *   A configurable threshold determines the level of influence the AI predictions have.

4.  **Continuous Learning Loop:**
    *   The system continuously learns from user interactions.  Newly captured interaction data is used to retrain the AI Prediction Model, improving its accuracy over time.
    *   A monitoring system tracks model performance and flags any degradation in accuracy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function selectBehaviorElement(dataElement, dataContract, userContext) {

  // 1. Identify compatible behavior elements
  compatibleElements = findCompatibleElements(dataElement, dataContract)

  // 2. Get AI Predictions
  predictions = AIModel.predictSuccessRates(compatibleElements, dataElement, userContext)

  // 3. Adjust Selection Weights
  for (element in compatibleElements) {
    element.weight = element.defaultWeight + predictions[element.id] * weightMultiplier
  }

  // 4. Select Best Element (Weighted)
  selectedElement = selectBestElementBasedOnWeight(compatibleElements)

  return selectedElement
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Federated Learning:** Allow models to be trained on data from multiple clients without sharing raw data, preserving user privacy.
*   **A/B Testing Integration:**  Seamlessly integrate with A/B testing frameworks to validate the effectiveness of AI-driven behavior selection.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI):**  Provide insights into why the AI model selected a particular behavior element.
