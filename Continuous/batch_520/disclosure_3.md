## Dynamic Content ‘Echo’ System

**Concept:** Extend the re-engagement notification system to proactively generate and deliver ‘content echoes’ – brief, personalized multimedia snippets derived from the user’s consumption history, delivered *before* they fall off track.  This moves beyond simple reminders and aims to maintain continuous engagement by rekindling immediate interest.

**Specs:**

1.  **Echo Generation Module:**
    *   Input: User’s content consumption data (reading position, highlights, notes, viewing history, timestamps).
    *   Process:
        *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze user’s highlighted text/notes to determine emotional resonance with specific passages/scenes.
        *   **Keyframe/Passage Extraction:** Identify visually striking frames (for video) or particularly meaningful passages (for text) based on sentiment and user interaction.
        *   **Dynamic Snippet Creation:**  Assemble brief multimedia snippets (5-15 seconds) incorporating keyframes/passages, ambient audio (from the content), and subtle visual/audio effects.
        *   **Personalized Tagging:** Associate each snippet with tags representing themes, characters, plot points, and emotional tone.
2.  **Engagement Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: User’s consumption patterns, content metadata, snippet tags, time since last interaction.
    *   Process:
        *   **Engagement Decay Modeling:**  Predict the probability of user disengagement based on time elapsed since last interaction and historical consumption patterns.
        *   **Snippet Selection:** Select the most relevant snippet(s) based on sentiment match, tag association, and predicted engagement impact. Consider 'surprise' factor - occasional snippets that *aren't* directly from their last read position, but relate to broader themes.
        *   **Delivery Scheduling:** Determine optimal delivery time based on user habits and predicted engagement decay.
3.  **Cross-Platform Delivery System:**
    *   Supported Platforms: Mobile (iOS, Android), Desktop (Windows, macOS), Smart TVs, Wearables.
    *   Delivery Methods: Push Notifications, In-App Messages, Lock Screen Displays, Email (secondary).
    *   User Customization: Allow users to adjust frequency, content type (video, text, audio), and notification style.

**Pseudocode (Snippet Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateSnippet(user_data, content_data):
  // 1. Sentiment Analysis
  sentiment_scores = AnalyzeSentiment(content_data.highlights, content_data.notes)

  // 2. Keyframe/Passage Extraction
  IF content_data.type == "video":
    key_frames = ExtractKeyFrames(content_data.frames, sentiment_scores)
  ELSE IF content_data.type == "text":
    key_passages = ExtractKeyPassages(content_data.text, sentiment_scores)

  // 3. Snippet Creation
  snippet = CreateSnippet(key_frames OR key_passages, content_data.audio)
  snippet.tags = DetermineTags(snippet.content, sentiment_scores)

  RETURN snippet
```

**Expansion Potential:**

*   **Social Echoes:** Share snippets with friends (optional), fostering social discussion around content.
*   **AI-Generated Extensions:** Use AI to create variations of snippets, extending or reinterpreting key moments.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate external data (weather, location) to deliver snippets that resonate with the user’s current context.
*   **Gamification:** Award points/badges for engaging with snippets and completing content.
