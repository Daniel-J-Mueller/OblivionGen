## Adaptive Coalesce Granularity

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically adjusting the coalesce threshold not at the *data page* level, but at the *data block* level within a data page.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on delaying coalesce operations based on page-level read frequency or storage availability. This approach treats all blocks within a page equally. Some blocks might be hot (frequently modified), while others are cold. Adaptive granularity allows finer-grained control, optimizing I/O and reducing latency for frequently changing data *within* a page.

**Components:**

*   **Block Metadata:** Each data block within a page will have associated metadata tracking:
    *   `modification_count`: Number of log records associated with the block.
    *   `access_frequency`: Frequency of reads/writes to the block over a defined time window.
    *   `coalesce_threshold`:  A dynamically adjusted threshold for triggering coalesce at the block level.
*   **Block Coalesce Manager (BCM):** A component residing on the storage node, responsible for:
    *   Monitoring block metadata.
    *   Calculating dynamic coalesce thresholds for each block.
    *   Initiating coalesce operations at the block level when thresholds are met.
*   **Database Engine Integration:** The database engine will need to be updated to:
    *   Generate log records tagged with the corresponding data block ID.
    *   Provide access to block-level access frequency data (potentially through an instrumentation layer).

**Algorithm (BCM):**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Each block starts with a default `coalesce_threshold`.
2.  **Monitoring & Update (Periodically - e.g., every 5 seconds):**
    *   For each block:
        *   Increment `modification_count` based on new log records.
        *   Update `access_frequency` based on observed access patterns.
        *   Calculate `new_coalesce_threshold` using the following formula:

            `new_coalesce_threshold = base_threshold + (access_frequency * frequency_weight) - (available_space * space_weight)`

            Where:
            *   `base_threshold` is a system-wide default.
            *   `frequency_weight` adjusts the impact of access frequency.
            *   `space_weight` adjusts the impact of available storage space.
        *   If `new_coalesce_threshold` differs significantly (e.g., >20%) from the current `coalesce_threshold`:
            *   Update `coalesce_threshold` for the block.
            *   Signal the database engine about the changed threshold (optional - can be polled).
3.  **Coalesce Trigger:**
    *   If `modification_count` for a block exceeds its current `coalesce_threshold`:
        *   Initiate a coalesce operation for *only* that block. This involves applying the associated log records to the block's version and creating a new version.
        *   Reset `modification_count` for the block.

**Pseudocode (BCM - Block Coalesce Trigger):**

```
function coalesce_block(block_id):
  log_records = get_log_records_for_block(block_id)
  block_version = get_block_version(block_id)
  new_block_version = apply_log_records(block_version, log_records)
  store_block_version(new_block_version, block_id)
  clear_log_records_for_block(block_id)
  reset_modification_count(block_id)
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Reduced I/O:**  Coalescing only frequently modified blocks minimizes unnecessary I/O operations.
*   **Lower Latency:** Faster coalesce operations for individual blocks improve response times.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:**  Adapts to varying data access patterns *within* a page.
*   **Scalability:** Allows more efficient use of storage resources, particularly in high-volume environments.
