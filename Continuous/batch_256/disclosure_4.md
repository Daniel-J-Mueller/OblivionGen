**Adaptive Communication Contextualization via Multi-Sensory Input**

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Device with microphone array (existing smartphone/smart speaker capabilities sufficient)
    *   Ambient light sensor
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope
    *   Optional: Low-resolution camera (for basic scene detection - object presence, but *not* facial recognition)
*   **Software:**
    *   Core Voice Processing Module (existing speech-to-text/intent recognition)
    *   Multi-Sensory Fusion Engine
    *   Contextual Awareness Module
    *   Communication Routing Module
    *   User Profile Database (extended to store sensory contextual preferences)

**Functional Description:**

The system extends the existing voice-based communication resolution by incorporating ambient sensory data to dynamically adjust communication parameters. It moves *beyond* simply resolving *who* to call, to dynamically altering *how* the communication takes place.

1.  **Sensory Data Acquisition:** Device continuously monitors ambient light levels, motion (via accelerometer/gyroscope), and, optionally, basic scene characteristics (e.g., presence of a television, detecting if the device is in a moving vehicle).

2.  **Sensory Fusion & Contextualization:** Sensory data is fused to infer the user’s current activity/situation. Examples:
    *   Low light + minimal motion = user likely relaxing/winding down.
    *   High motion + detected vehicle = user likely commuting.
    *   Bright light + detected TV = user likely watching television.

3.  **Dynamic Communication Profile Adjustment:**  Based on the inferred context, the system dynamically adjusts communication parameters:

    *   **Audio Mode:**
        *   Relaxing:  Prioritize high-fidelity audio, noise cancellation enabled.
        *   Commuting:  Enable aggressive noise suppression, prioritize voice clarity, potentially switch to a lower bandwidth codec.
        *   Watching TV:  Enable a "Do Not Disturb" mode, offering a shortened ringtone or haptic notification, or even automatically suggesting a text-based response.
    *   **Notification Style:**
        *   Relaxing: Soft, melodic ringtone.
        *   Commuting: Urgent, attention-grabbing ringtone, or a voice notification read aloud by a text-to-speech engine.
        *   Watching TV:  Vibration only or a brief, non-intrusive visual cue.
    *   **Communication Application Selection:** System learns preferences, for example user may prefer video calls when at home, and only voice calls when commuting.
    *   **Automated Response Suggestions:** Context-aware suggestions.  E.g., “You’re watching TV.  Suggest responding with ‘I’ll call you back later.’”

4.  **User Profile Learning:**  The system tracks user responses to the dynamic adjustments (accepting/rejecting suggestions, manually overriding settings) to refine the contextual awareness model and personalize the experience.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  ambientLight = readLightSensor();
  motion = readAccelerometer();
  scene = analyzeScene(); //optional

  context = inferContext(ambientLight, motion, scene);

  communicationProfile = getCommunicationProfile(context); //returns pre-set profiles

  //Override profile
  if(userOverride){
      communicationProfile = userOverride;
  }

  applyCommunicationProfile(communicationProfile);

  logUserFeedback(userInteraction); //Track behavior
}

// Function to Infer Context
function inferContext(light, motion, scene) {
  if (light < threshold && motion < threshold) {
    return "Relaxing";
  } else if (motion > threshold) {
    return "Commuting";
  } else if (scene == "TV") {
    return "Watching TV";
  } else {
    return "Default";
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with smart home devices (e.g., adjusting smart lighting based on incoming call status).
*   Predictive communication adjustment (anticipating context changes based on learned patterns).
*   Multi-user context awareness (adjusting communication based on the context of *both* parties).
