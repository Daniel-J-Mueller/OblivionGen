## Dynamic Source Map Stitching & Execution

**Concept:** Extend the proxy to not just *deliver* source maps, but to dynamically stitch together source map fragments and even execute transformations *within* the proxy before delivery. This addresses scenarios with complex build pipelines, monorepos, or on-the-fly code modification.

**Specs:**

**1. Fragmented Source Map Handling:**

*   **Input:** The proxy receives requests for transformed code, and knows (or can determine) the potential locations of *partial* source maps. These fragments may be stored on multiple servers, or within different layers of a caching system.
*   **Process:**
    *   The proxy maintains a configuration mapping transformed code identifiers (hashes, versions) to lists of potential source map fragment locations.
    *   It fetches these fragments in parallel.
    *   A 'Source Map Stitcher' module assembles the fragments into a complete source map, resolving any conflicts or inconsistencies. This may involve versioning information embedded in the fragments.
*   **Output:** A complete, unified source map.

**2. Proxy-Side Transformation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Transformed code, a complete source map, and a set of pre-defined, *safe* transformations (e.g., adding debug logging, applying minor code patches, replacing constants). These transformations are configured via a central management system and subject to strict security controls.
*   **Process:**
    *   The proxy executes the configured transformations *on the transformed code* using an embedded, sandboxed execution environment (e.g., a lightweight JavaScript engine, WebAssembly runtime).
    *   The transformation engine *updates the source map* to reflect the changes made to the code. This is critical for accurate debugging.
*   **Output:** Modified transformed code, an updated source map.

**3.  Transformation Configuration & Security:**

*   **Central Management System:** A secure, role-based system for defining and deploying transformations. This system controls which transformations are allowed, and for which code.
*   **Sandboxed Execution:** Transformations are executed in a strictly sandboxed environment to prevent malicious or unintended side effects.
*   **Audit Logging:** All transformations and their results are logged for auditing and debugging.

**Pseudocode (Proxy Logic):**

```
function handle_request(request):
  transformed_code = fetch_from_server(request.code_server)
  code_identifier = hash(transformed_code)

  source_map_fragments = get_source_map_fragment_locations(code_identifier)
  source_map = stitch_source_map(source_map_fragments)

  transformation_config = get_transformation_config(code_identifier)
  if transformation_config:
    transformed_code, source_map = apply_transformations(transformed_code, source_map, transformation_config)

  sign_code(transformed_code, certificate)

  return transformed_code, source_map
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Complex Builds:** Simplifies debugging of code from complex build pipelines or monorepos.
*   **Dynamic Modification:** Allows for on-the-fly code modification and debugging without redeployment.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Provides a centralized and controlled environment for code modification.
*   **Improved Debugging:** Ensures accurate debugging information even after code modification.
