## Dynamic Regional Persona Assignment & Simulated Load Injection

**Concept:** Extend the existing failover region management system by assigning 'personas' to each region, representing different user demographics or application usage patterns. Then, proactively inject simulated load mimicking those personas into available failover regions *before* a primary region failure, assessing performance and identifying potential bottlenecks *before* they impact real users.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Definition Module:**

*   **Input:** Configuration files defining user personas. Each persona includes:
    *   Geographic distribution (probability map).
    *   Typical application usage profile (API call frequency, data volume, session duration).
    *   Device types (mobile, desktop, IoT).
    *   Error tolerance level (sensitivity to latency, acceptable error rates).
*   **Output:**  Data structures representing personas, accessible by the Load Injection Engine.
*   **Data Storage:** Persona definitions stored in a version-controlled configuration repository (e.g., Git).

**2. Load Injection Engine:**

*   **Input:** List of available failover regions, persona definitions, injection parameters (duration, intensity, ramp-up time).
*   **Process:**
    *   Select a persona and assign it to the failover region for the injection period.
    *   Generate simulated user requests based on the selected personaâ€™s usage profile.
    *   Distribute the simulated requests across the failover region's infrastructure.
    *   Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs): latency, throughput, error rates, resource utilization (CPU, memory, network).
*   **Output:** KPI data streamed to a monitoring and analytics platform. Real-time dashboards visualizing performance metrics.

**3. Predictive Capacity Scaling Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical KPI data from Load Injection Engine, current resource utilization of primary and failover regions, persona assignments.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to predict future capacity requirements based on anticipated load.
    *   Recommend capacity scaling actions:
        *   Increase/decrease instance counts.
        *   Adjust resource allocations (CPU, memory).
        *   Pre-provision resources in failover regions.
*   **Output:**  Automated scaling policies configured in cloud provider infrastructure (e.g., AWS Auto Scaling, Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets).

**4. Simulated Failure Injection & Validation**

*   **Process:** The system should be able to inject *simulated* failures into the primary region. This is to simulate a real failure, and test the failover logic, as well as the readiness of the simulated load/persona.
*   **Output:**  A metric which represents the *actual* degree of 'readiness' in the failover region.



**Pseudocode (Predictive Capacity Scaling):**

```
function predict_capacity(historical_data, current_utilization, persona_assignment):
  // Load historical KPI data (latency, throughput, error rates)
  data = load_historical_data(historical_data)

  // Identify relevant data based on persona assignment
  filtered_data = filter_data_by_persona(data, persona_assignment)

  // Train a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM)
  model = train_model(filtered_data)

  // Predict future load based on current utilization and model
  predicted_load = model.predict(current_utilization)

  // Calculate required capacity based on predicted load
  required_capacity = calculate_capacity(predicted_load)

  // Generate scaling recommendations
  recommendations = generate_scaling_recommendations(required_capacity)

  return recommendations

function generate_scaling_recommendations(required_capacity):
    // Compare with current capacity
    if required_capacity > current_capacity:
        // Recommend increasing instances or resource allocations
        recommendation = "Increase capacity by X%"
    elif required_capacity < current_capacity:
        // Recommend decreasing instances or resource allocations
        recommendation = "Decrease capacity by Y%"
    else:
        recommendation = "Capacity is sufficient"

    return recommendation
```
