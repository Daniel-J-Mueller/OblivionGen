## Adaptive Acoustic Zones

**Concept:** Extend noise cancellation beyond simple subtraction by creating dynamic, localized acoustic zones within a space, tailored to individual speakers and activities. This builds on the patent's noise cancellation foundation by moving from global processing to hyper-localized, adaptive control.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8, optimally 16+) embedded in wearable devices (earbuds, headsets, smart glasses) *and* distributed throughout the environment (room-based units, potentially integrated into smart lighting or furniture).
    *   High-fidelity, miniature beamforming speakers integrated into wearable devices *and* environmental units.
    *   Edge computing units within both wearables and environmental nodes for real-time processing.
    *   Centralized processing unit (cloud or on-premise) for zone management and profile learning.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Speaker Localization & Tracking:** Algorithms to identify and track the location of each speaker in real-time using microphone array data.  Must handle multiple concurrent speakers and dynamic movement. Output: X,Y,Z coordinates + velocity vector for each speaker.
    *   **Activity Recognition:** AI-based activity recognition module to determine what each speaker is *doing* (speaking, listening, singing, playing music, etc.). Input: Audio data + potentially sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope). Output: Probability distribution across activity categories.
    *   **Acoustic Zone Definition:**  Algorithm to dynamically define localized acoustic zones around each speaker, based on their location and activity. Zones are not static; they adapt to speaker movement and environmental changes. Output: 3D polygonal mesh defining each zone.
    *   **Adaptive Noise Cancellation (ANC) Profiles:**  Per-zone ANC profiles are generated based on the speaker’s activity and desired acoustic environment.  For example:
        *   *Speech Enhancement:*  Maximize clarity of speech for the speaker and listeners within the zone.
        *   *Privacy Shield:* Suppress all sound *except* the speaker’s voice, creating a private conversation bubble.
        *   *Immersive Audio:* Enhance specific audio frequencies for a more immersive listening experience (e.g., for music or gaming).
    *   **Beamforming Control:** Real-time control of beamforming speakers to shape the acoustic environment within each zone.  This includes:
        *   *Noise Cancellation:* Emit anti-noise signals to cancel out unwanted sounds.
        *   *Sound Amplification:* Amplify desired sounds (e.g., speech, music).
        *   *Sound Steering:* Direct sound to specific locations within the zone.
    *   **Zone Blending/Transition Logic:** Smoothly blend acoustic zones together when speakers move between them.  Avoid abrupt changes in sound quality.
    *   **Machine Learning/Personalization:**  Learn user preferences over time to personalize acoustic zone profiles.  Adapt to individual hearing profiles and acoustic sensitivities.

*   **Pseudocode (Zone Management):**

```
// Initialize zones
zones = []

// When speaker detected/moves:
function update_speaker_zone(speaker_id, location, activity) {
  zone = find_zone(speaker_id)

  if (zone == null) {
    zone = create_new_zone(speaker_id, location, activity)
    zones.append(zone)
  } else {
    zone.update_location(location)
    zone.update_activity(activity)
    zone.recalculate_anc_profile() // Based on activity/location
  }
}

// Main Loop:
while (true) {
  for each speaker in detected_speakers {
    update_speaker_zone(speaker.id, speaker.location, speaker.activity)
  }

  for each zone in zones {
    apply_anc_profile(zone) // Control beamforming speakers/noise cancellation
    // Render/visualize zone boundaries (for debugging)
  }

  sleep(0.01) // Update frequency
}
```

*   **Potential Use Cases:**
    *   Open-plan offices: Create private conversation bubbles for each employee.
    *   Concert venues:  Personalize the audio experience for each audience member.
    *   Home entertainment:  Create immersive audio environments for movies and games.
    *   Assistive listening:  Enhance speech clarity for people with hearing impairments.
