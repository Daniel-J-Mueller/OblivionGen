## Personalized Predictive Query Expansion with Sentiment Analysis

**Concept:** Enhance search relevance by not just predicting related queries, but *personalizing* those predictions based on a user's recent sentiment expressed within their search history and browsing behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sentiment Data Collection & Processing:**

*   **Data Sources:**  Track user search queries, dwell time on search results, clicks, purchases, and (with explicit permission) data from linked social media accounts.
*   **Sentiment Analysis Engine:** Implement a real-time sentiment analysis module.  This module analyzes text from search queries, product reviews viewed, and (if available) social media posts. Categorize sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral, with a confidence score.  Track sentiment trends over time (e.g., a user consistently expressing negative sentiment toward a particular brand).
*   **Sentiment Profile:** Create a "Sentiment Profile" for each user, representing their dominant sentiment trends across various topics and brands. Update this profile continuously.
*   **Topic Modeling:** Employ topic modeling (LDA, NMF) on user history to identify key interest areas. Combine topic modeling with sentiment analysis for granular sentiment-topic associations (e.g., user is "Positive" about "Sustainable Fashion" but "Negative" about "Fast Fashion").

**2. Predictive Query Expansion Enhancement:**

*   **Existing System Integration:**  Leverage the existing "related queries dataset" generation.
*   **Sentiment-Weighted Expansion:** When a user submits a query, *before* applying standard query expansion, analyze the query's inherent sentiment.
*   **Personalized Expansion Candidate Selection:**
    *   Retrieve standard related queries.
    *   From the related queries, identify candidates aligning with the user's Sentiment Profile (e.g., if a user is consistently positive about "Organic Food", prioritize related queries like "Organic Recipes", "Best Organic Grocery Stores").
    *   Down-weight or exclude related queries contradicting the Sentiment Profile (e.g., if the user expresses negative sentiment towards “luxury cars,” suppress related queries like “most expensive sports cars”).
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Implement a dynamic weighting system that adjusts the importance of sentiment-aligned and sentiment-contradictory related queries based on the strength of the user’s sentiment (high confidence score = stronger weight).

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservice Architecture:** Implement as a separate microservice (“Sentiment-Aware Query Expansion Service”) to avoid impacting the core search infrastructure.
*   **API Interface:** Provide a simple API that receives the user query and returns an expanded query list.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilize a NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) to efficiently store Sentiment Profiles and related data.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce latency and improve performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function expandQuery(user_id, query):
    // Retrieve User Sentiment Profile
    sentiment_profile = getSentimentProfile(user_id)

    // Get standard related queries
    related_queries = getRelatedQueries(query)

    // Filter and Weight Related Queries
    weighted_queries = []
    for each query in related_queries:
        // Determine sentiment alignment with user profile
        alignment_score = calculateAlignmentScore(query, sentiment_profile)

        // Adjust weight based on alignment score
        weight = base_weight + alignment_score * weight_factor

        weighted_queries.append((query, weight))

    // Sort by weight
    sorted_queries = sort(weighted_queries, by=weight, descending=True)

    // Return top N expanded queries
    return [query for query, weight in sorted_queries[:N]]
```

**Novelty:** This builds on predictive query expansion by introducing a *personalized* sentiment layer. It doesn't just predict what users *might* search for, but what they *want* to search for, based on their emotional state and preferences. It's a move toward a more empathetic search experience.
