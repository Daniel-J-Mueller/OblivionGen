## Dynamic Complexity Masking for Perceptual Bitrate Allocation

**Specification:** Implement a system which dynamically generates a 'complexity mask' for each video channel, derived not just from frame-by-frame analysis, but from *predicted* motion vectors and object segmentation. This mask directly influences bitrate allocation, prioritizing preservation of visually salient regions *before* encoding, and reducing bitrate in areas predicted to be less noticeable.

**Components:**

1.  **Motion Prediction Engine:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict object motion within a video sequence. Input: current frame, previous N frames. Output: Predicted motion vectors for segmented objects.
2.  **Object Segmentation Module:** Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) for real-time object detection and segmentation. Output: Segmentation mask identifying distinct objects and their boundaries.
3.  **Complexity Mask Generator:** Combines outputs from the Motion Prediction Engine and Object Segmentation Module.  

    *   Assigns a 'salience score' to each pixel based on:
        *   Object ID (higher score for foreground objects).
        *   Predicted motion vector magnitude (higher score for fast-moving objects).
        *   Texture complexity (calculated from local gradient variations).
    *   Normalizes salience scores to create a grayscale 'complexity mask' (0-255).

4.  **Perceptual Bitrate Allocator:** Modifies the existing bitrate allocation algorithm.

    *   For each channel, calculate the total available bitrate.
    *   Apply the complexity mask to the channel’s frames.
    *   Instead of allocating bitrate uniformly or based on simple frame complexity, allocate bitrate *proportionally* to the mask’s pixel values. Brighter pixels (high salience) receive more bits, darker pixels receive fewer.
    *   Constrain overall bitrate to remain within the maximum aggregate limit.
    *   Implement a feedback loop: Monitor the perceptual quality of the encoded video (using a metric like VMAF) and dynamically adjust the mask’s influence on bitrate allocation to optimize quality.

**Pseudocode (Perceptual Bitrate Allocator):**

```
function allocateBitrate(channel, complexityMask, totalBitrate, minBitrate, maxBitrate):
    maskSum = sum of all pixel values in complexityMask
    
    // Calculate baseline bitrate allocation per pixel
    baselineBitratePerPixel = totalBitrate / (maskSum)
    
    // Calculate individual pixel bitrates
    pixelBitrates = []
    for each pixel in complexityMask:
        bitrate = pixel.value * baselineBitratePerPixel
        
        // Enforce bitrate constraints
        bitrate = max(minBitrate, min(maxBitrate, bitrate)) 
        
        pixelBitrates.append(bitrate)
        
    return pixelBitrates
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPU acceleration for RNN and CNN models.
*   Sufficient memory to store intermediate masks and bitrates.

**Potential Improvements:**

*   **Attention Mechanisms:** Integrate attention mechanisms within the RNN to focus on the most important regions for motion prediction.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define regions of interest (ROIs) to further influence bitrate allocation.
*   **Cross-Channel Correlation:**  Explore correlations between channels to allocate bitrate more efficiently. (e.g., allocate more bits to a high-motion channel if other channels are static)
