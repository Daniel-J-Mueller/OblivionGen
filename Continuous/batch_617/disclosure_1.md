## Adaptive Workspace Illumination & Projection Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the visual task cue system to dynamically adjust workspace illumination *in conjunction* with projected cues, creating a more intuitive and error-proof workflow. This goes beyond simple projection; it uses light as a primary guidance mechanism.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Multi-Spectral LED Array:** Replace existing projectors with a dense array of individually addressable RGBW (Red, Green, Blue, White) LEDs embedded within the workstation surface. LEDs must support at least 6000K color temperature and >95 CRI.
    *   **Ambient Light Sensors:** Integrate multiple ambient light sensors (at least 4) around the workstation perimeter to account for external light interference.
    *   **Depth Sensors:** Utilize a higher-resolution depth sensor (e.g., Time-of-Flight) to create a precise 3D map of the workstation surface and any items present.
    *   **Processing Unit:** A dedicated edge computing device (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) to manage the LED array, depth data, and visual cue generation.
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Dynamic Illumination Mapping:** Algorithm analyzes the item-handling task, identifies critical areas, and dynamically adjusts LED brightness and color temperature to *highlight* those areas. (e.g., a component requiring assembly glows softly, incorrect parts are dimmed/tinted red).
    *   **Projection-Illumination Fusion:** Cues arenâ€™t simply projected *onto* the surface, but are integrated with the illumination map. A projected line could be reinforced by a thin strip of bright light, or a highlighted area could have a projected overlay indicating its function.
    *   **Occlusion Handling:**  Algorithm dynamically recalibrates illumination and projection based on real-time depth data. If an object is placed on top of a projected cue, the algorithm intelligently reroutes the cue or illuminates the object itself.
    *   **Task State Recognition:**  The system uses computer vision (trained on a dataset of item handling tasks) to *infer* the current state of the task. If a worker is struggling with a step, the system automatically adjusts illumination and provides more prominent cues.
    *   **User-Specific Customization:** Store user preferences for lighting color, brightness, and cue styles. Allow users to adjust these settings via a simple interface.
*   **Pseudocode (Task Cue Generation):**

```
function generateTaskCue(taskState, itemData, userPreferences):
  // 1. Determine base illumination based on task state
  if taskState == "missing_part":
    baseIllumination = "pulsing_red"
  else if taskState == "incorrect_part":
    baseIllumination = "dimmed_orange"
  else:
    baseIllumination = "neutral_white"

  // 2. Calculate visual cues based on item data
  if itemData.isMissing:
    visualCue = "highlight_empty_space"
    cueColor = "red"
  else if itemData.isIncorrect:
    visualCue = "outline_item_with_error"
    cueColor = "orange"
  else:
    visualCue = "none"
    cueColor = "white"

  // 3. Combine illumination and visual cues
  finalCue = {
    illumination: baseIllumination,
    projection: visualCue,
    color: cueColor
  }

  return finalCue

```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Assembly lines
    *   Order picking
    *   Quality control
    *   Medical device manufacturing
    *   Any task requiring precise manual manipulation of objects.
