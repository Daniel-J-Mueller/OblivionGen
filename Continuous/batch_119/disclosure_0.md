## Adaptive Security Oracle via Generative Model Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the change impact analysis to *predict* potential security vulnerabilities *before* code commit, by synthesizing likely attack vectors using generative models trained on historical vulnerability data and code characteristics.

**Specification:**

1.  **Vulnerability Knowledge Graph (VKG):** Construct a VKG populated with historical vulnerability data (CVEs, CWEs), attack patterns (MITRE ATT&CK), and associated code characteristics (function calls, data flows, control flow graphs). Nodes represent vulnerabilities, attack steps, code elements. Edges represent relationships (e.g., "exploits", "uses", "contains").

2.  **Code Feature Extraction:** Upon code change, extract a feature vector representing the modified code. Features include:
    *   Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) diffs
    *   Control Flow Graph (CFG) diffs
    *   Data Flow Graph (DFG) diffs
    *   API call sequences
    *   Cyclomatic complexity
    *   Lines of code changed.

3.  **Generative Attack Path Model (GAPM):** Train a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Variational Autoencoder (VAE) on the VKG. The GAPM learns to generate plausible attack paths given a code feature vector. The generator attempts to create a path through the VKG leading to a vulnerability, while the discriminator assesses the plausibility of the generated path.

4.  **Oracle Simulation:**
    *   Input the code feature vector to the GAPM.
    *   The GAPM generates *N* candidate attack paths.
    *   For each candidate path, evaluate its feasibility given the modified code. This involves:
        *   **Symbolic Execution:** Attempt to execute the path symbolically against the changed code to see if it reaches a vulnerable state.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities along the path.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Employ fuzzing techniques to test the modified code for vulnerabilities indicated by the attack path.

5.  **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to the code change based on:
    *   Number of plausible attack paths generated.
    *   Severity of vulnerabilities indicated by the attack paths.
    *   Confidence level of the GAPM.
    *   Results of symbolic execution, static analysis, and fuzzing.

6.  **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously retrain the GAPM with new vulnerability data and feedback from security analyses. The model adapts to emerging attack patterns and evolving codebases.

**Pseudocode (Oracle Simulation):**

```
function simulate_oracle(code_feature_vector):
    attack_paths = GAPM.generate_paths(code_feature_vector, N)
    risk_score = 0
    for path in attack_paths:
        feasibility = symbolic_execution(path, modified_code) or static_analysis(path, modified_code) or fuzzing(path, modified_code)
        if feasibility:
            vulnerability_severity = assess_severity(path)
            risk_score += vulnerability_severity
    return risk_score
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure for training and running the generative models.
*   Scalable data storage for the VKG and training data.
*   Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated security analysis.
*   Utilize containerization and orchestration technologies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) for deployment and scalability.

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond reactive vulnerability detection to proactive risk assessment by predicting potential attack vectors *before* code changes are committed. Leveraging generative models allows for exploration of a wider range of attack scenarios than traditional static or dynamic analysis techniques.
