## Dynamic Policy Inheritance with Temporal Context

**Specification:** A system enabling dynamic inheritance of directory policies based on temporal context and user behavior, extending beyond static group or user-defined policies.

**Concept:** The patent describes a shadow administrator account for managing directory access. This inspires a system that *automatically* adjusts access permissions based on real-time data, rather than relying solely on pre-defined administrative rules. This moves beyond static policy definitions, towards *adaptive* security.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Analysis Engine:** Monitors user activity within the managed directory service â€“ login times, resource access patterns, data modification frequency, etc.
2.  **Temporal Context Module:** Identifies time-based patterns. Examples: peak usage hours, scheduled maintenance windows, expected user activity based on time zone.
3.  **Policy Inference Engine:** Combines behavioral and temporal data to infer appropriate access levels. Utilizes machine learning models trained on historical data and organizational security preferences.
4.  **Dynamic Access Control Layer:** Intercepts access requests and dynamically adjusts permissions based on the output of the Policy Inference Engine.
5.  **Shadow Administrator Proxy:** Extends the existing shadow administrator concept. Instead of manual policy changes, the shadow account is used *programmatically* by the system to enact the dynamically adjusted permissions. This maintains an audit trail traceable to the automated system.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitors the effectiveness of dynamically adjusted policies. If access is denied that should have been granted (false positive), or granted inappropriately (false negative), the system adjusts its models accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Policy Inference Engine):**

```
function infer_access_level(user, resource, timestamp):
  behavioral_data = get_user_behavior(user, timestamp)
  temporal_context = get_temporal_context(timestamp)

  // Model input features:
  features = {
    user_role: user.role,
    resource_type: resource.type,
    time_of_day: temporal_context.hour,
    day_of_week: temporal_context.weekday,
    access_frequency: behavioral_data.access_frequency,
    data_sensitivity: resource.sensitivity,
    historical_access: behavioral_data.historical_access
  }

  // Load trained machine learning model
  model = load_model("access_control_model.pkl")

  // Predict access level
  access_level = model.predict([features])[0]

  return access_level
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `User`: {`id`, `role`, `permissions` (base permissions), `behavioral_data`}
*   `Resource`: {`id`, `type`, `sensitivity`, `access_control_list`}
*   `TemporalContext`: {`timestamp`, `hour`, `weekday`, `timezone`, `event_flag` (e.g., scheduled maintenance)}

**Implementation Details:**

*   The machine learning model could be a decision tree, random forest, or neural network.
*   The behavioral data could be stored in a time-series database for efficient analysis.
*   The system should provide a dashboard for administrators to monitor and adjust the machine learning model and system parameters.
*   Integration with existing SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems for threat detection and response.
