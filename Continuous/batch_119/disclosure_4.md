## Adaptive Resonance Network for Distributed Sensor Fusion via Vibro-Acoustic Propagation

**Concept:** Leverage the vibro-acoustic communication established in the referenced patent as a medium for propagating data from a distributed network of sensors, combined with an Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural network for on-device data fusion and anomaly detection.

**Specifications:**

**I. Sensor Node Hardware:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Each node integrates multiple sensor types (temperature, pressure, acceleration, magnetic field, acoustic emission).
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M series microcontroller with sufficient processing power for local data preprocessing and ART network execution.
*   **Piezoelectric Transducer (PET):**  Dedicated PET for both transmitting and receiving vibro-acoustic signals. Frequency range: 20kHz – 150kHz (optimized for material propagation characteristics).
*   **Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC):** High-resolution ADC for accurate sensor data acquisition.
*   **Power Management:**  Energy harvesting module (vibration, thermal) + rechargeable battery for extended operation.
*   **Enclosure:** Ruggedized, vibration-dampened enclosure to minimize noise and protect internal components.

**II. Communication Protocol:**

*   **Data Encoding:** Sensor data is encoded into frequency-modulated vibro-acoustic signals. Each sensor type is assigned a unique frequency carrier.  Amplitude modulation encodes the sensor reading.
*   **Addressing:**  Nodes are assigned unique identification codes embedded within the transmitted signal (e.g., using a Manchester encoding scheme).
*   **Synchronization:** Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) scheme for coordinating transmissions to minimize collisions.  A central ‘beacon’ node can initiate synchronization.
*   **Error Correction:**  Forward Error Correction (FEC) coding (e.g., Reed-Solomon) to improve robustness against signal degradation.

**III. ART Network Implementation:**

*   **Network Architecture:**  ART-1 network architecture with a vigilance parameter (ρ) adjustable based on environmental noise levels and desired sensitivity.
*   **Input Vector:** Each sensor reading (preprocessed and normalized) forms a dimension in the input vector.
*   **Weight Matrix:**  Weights are initialized randomly and updated using the ART learning rule.  Weights representing correlated sensor readings are reinforced over time.
*   **Category Representation:**  Each learned category represents a normal operating condition or a specific event.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** When a new input vector doesn't match any existing category (exceeds the vigilance threshold), it’s flagged as an anomaly.
*   **On-Device Training:**  The ART network can be trained locally using a representative dataset of normal operating conditions. Incremental learning algorithms allow for adaptation to changing environments.

**IV. System Operation:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Sensor nodes collect data from their respective sensors.
2.  **Local Processing:** Raw sensor data is preprocessed (filtered, calibrated, normalized).
3.  **Vibro-Acoustic Transmission:** Processed data is encoded into vibro-acoustic signals and transmitted via the PET.
4.  **Reception & Decoding:** Neighboring nodes receive the vibro-acoustic signals, decode the data, and extract sensor readings.
5.  **ART Network Processing:**  Each node's ART network processes the received data and local sensor data to create a fused representation of the environment.
6.  **Anomaly Detection:** The ART network identifies anomalies based on deviations from learned categories.
7.  **Data Aggregation (Optional):**  Selected nodes can aggregate and forward anomaly reports to a central control system via a separate communication channel (e.g., wireless).

**V. Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Input: Sensor Vector (SV) – Combined local & received sensor readings
//       Vigilance Parameter (ρ)
// Output: Anomaly Flag (True/False)

Function DetectAnomaly(SV, ρ) {

  BestMatchingCategory = FindBestMatchingCategory(SV)  //Find category with highest similarity

  Similarity = CalculateSimilarity(SV, BestMatchingCategory) //Calculate similarity metric

  If (Similarity < ρ) { //If similarity below threshold

    CreateNewCategory(SV)  //Create a new category for the anomaly

    Return True //Indicate anomaly detected

  } Else {

    UpdateWeights(BestMatchingCategory, SV) //Reinforce the weights of the matching category

    Return False //Indicate no anomaly detected

  }

}
```

**Potential Applications:** Structural health monitoring, predictive maintenance, environmental sensing, security surveillance, robotic swarms.
