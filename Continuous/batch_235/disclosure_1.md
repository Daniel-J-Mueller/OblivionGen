## Dynamic Entity Linking with Temporal Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the entity recognition and linking capabilities to incorporate a temporal dimension. The system should not only identify *what* entities are present in a digital work but *when* they are relevant, and how their relationships evolve over time within the text.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Temporal Tagging:** Implement a process to tag each entity mention with a temporal context. This context could be explicit (dates, time references) or implicit (sequence of events, narrative structure). 
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        FOR each sentence IN digital_work:
            FOR each entity IN recognized_entities(sentence):
                temporal_context = extract_temporal_information(sentence, entity)
                entity.add_tag(temporal_context)
        ```

2.  **Temporal Relationship Graph:** Construct a graph database representing entities and their relationships, with time as a primary dimension. Edges between entities will be weighted by temporal proximity and the nature of the relationship (e.g., "met", "worked with", "opposed").

    *   Data Structure: Graph Database (Neo4j, JanusGraph)
    *   Nodes: Entities (characters, places, organizations) with associated metadata (name, description, initial temporal tag).
    *   Edges: Relationships between entities (type, weight – based on temporal proximity and relationship strength).

3.  **Relationship Decay Function:** Implement a function that dynamically adjusts the weight of relationships over time.  Relationships that are not reinforced by recent mentions or actions will decay, reflecting the changing relevance of entities and their connections.

    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        FUNCTION decay_relationship(relationship, time_delta, decay_rate):
            relationship.weight = relationship.weight * (1 - decay_rate * time_delta)
            RETURN relationship
        ```

4.  **Event Detection and Linking:** Identify significant events within the digital work and link entities to those events based on their involvement. This provides a context for understanding entity relationships.

    *   Technique: Utilize Named Entity Recognition (NER) combined with Relation Extraction (RE) to identify event triggers and participating entities.
    *   Output: Event graph – nodes representing events, edges connecting events to involved entities.

5.  **Interactive Visualization:** Develop a user interface that allows exploration of the temporal entity graph. Users should be able to:
    *   Filter entities by type and time period.
    *   Visualize entity relationships over time.
    *   Highlight event timelines.
    *   Explore the evolution of entity influence and importance.
    *   Select entities and see their actions and interactions, and how those change over time.

6.  **Representative Name Selection Refinement:** Enhance the representative name selection process by considering temporal factors. If an entity is known by different names at different times, the system should select the name most relevant to the current time context.

7.  **Proactive Entity Suggestion:** Based on the temporal entity graph, the system should proactively suggest related entities or events that might be of interest to the user. This adds an element of discovery to the system.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Historical Text Analysis:** Understanding the evolution of social networks and political alliances in historical documents.
*   **Character Development in Literature:** Tracking character arcs and relationships in novels and plays.
*   **Intelligence Gathering:** Identifying key players and events in complex situations.
*   **Narrative Generation:** Creating dynamic stories with evolving characters and relationships.
