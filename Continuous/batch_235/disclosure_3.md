## Dynamic Granularity Caching with Predictive Pre-Computation

**Concept:** Extend hierarchical caching by dynamically adjusting the granularity of cached solutions based on predicted user travel patterns and real-time grid changes. Instead of fixed grid portions, the system learns which areas are frequently accessed *in combination* and creates adaptive, overlapping caches. This goes beyond simply caching 'point A to point B' – it anticipates likely subsequent movements.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Travel Pattern Analyzer:**

*   **Input:** Historical route data (anonymized user paths), real-time traffic data (if applicable – e.g., congestion, obstacles), grid update frequency.
*   **Process:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to predict probable future positions given a starting point and travel history.  The LSTM will output a probability distribution over potential next grid locations.
*   **Output:** A "heat map" indicating the likelihood of travel to different grid areas within a defined time window.  This heat map serves as a weighting factor for cache prioritization.

**2. Adaptive Cache Granularity Manager:**

*   **Input:** Predictive heat map, current cache hit rate, grid update notifications.
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide the grid into variable-sized tiles. Initially, tiles could be based on a quadtree decomposition for balanced granularity.
    *   Dynamically adjust tile sizes based on the heat map and cache hit rate. Areas with high predicted traffic and low hit rate will be subdivided into smaller tiles. Conversely, areas with low traffic and high hit rate can be merged into larger tiles.
    *   Implement a cost function that balances the memory overhead of finer-grained caching with the performance gains from faster lookups.
    *   The system will automatically identify frequently travelled ‘chains’ of grid locations even if they weren’t explicitly cached as single units before.

*   **Output:** A dynamically adjusted grid partitioning scheme and cache priority list.

**3.  Pre-Computation Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Dynamic grid partitioning, predictive travel patterns, cost data.
*   **Process:**  Initiate pre-computation of optimal paths not just for individual tiles but for *combinations* of tiles identified as having high predictive traffic.  This creates ‘composite paths’ that can be quickly assembled when a user traverses multiple tiles.  Utilize multi-threading and distributed computing to accelerate the pre-computation process.
*   **Output:** Pre-computed path data stored in a multi-level cache hierarchy (L1 – fast, small; L2 – slower, larger).

**4.  Cache Invalidation & Update Mechanism:**

*   **Process:**  Monitor grid updates in real-time. When a grid update occurs, identify the affected tiles and invalidate or update the corresponding cached data.  Use a versioning system to track changes and ensure data consistency.  Employ a background process to re-compute invalidated paths asynchronously.

**Pseudocode (Cache Lookup):**

```
function LookupPath(start_position, end_position):
  // 1. Identify relevant tiles based on start and end positions
  tiles = GetTiles(start_position, end_position)

  // 2. Check L1 cache for pre-computed path for the combination of tiles
  cached_path = L1Cache.GetPath(tiles)

  if cached_path:
    return cached_path

  // 3. Check L2 cache
  cached_path = L2Cache.GetPath(tiles)

  if cached_path:
    //Move Path to L1 Cache
    L1Cache.AddPath(tiles, cached_path)
    return cached_path

  // 4. If no cached path, compute path
  path = ComputePath(start_position, end_position)

  // 5. Cache the path
  CachePath(path, tiles)

  return path

function CachePath(path, tiles):
    L2Cache.AddPath(tiles, path)

```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-bandwidth memory (HBM) for fast cache access.
*   Multi-core processors for parallel path computation.
*   Distributed computing infrastructure for scaling pre-computation.

This system aims to move beyond static, hierarchical caching and create a more responsive and efficient pathfinding service by proactively anticipating user movements and pre-computing optimal paths.
