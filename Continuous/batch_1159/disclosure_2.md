## Dynamic Attestation via Hardware-Bound Roots of Trust & Ephemeral Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the secure boot/volume access paradigm beyond simple key exchange to a continuous attestation system leveraging hardware-bound roots of trust and ephemeral, time-limited credentials. This enables granular, policy-driven access control *after* initial boot, adapting to runtime conditions.

**Specs:**

1.  **Trusted Platform Module (TPM) Integration:** Require target instances to have a TPM 2.0 or equivalent. The TPM acts as the foundation for establishing a chain of trust.
2.  **Initial Boot & Measurement:** During boot, the hypervisor measures key boot components (UEFI, kernel, initrd) and extends these measurements into the TPM's Platform Configuration Register (PCRs). These PCR values become the foundation for attestation.
3.  **Attestation Server:** Introduce an Attestation Server (AS) responsible for verifying instance integrity. The AS maintains policies defining acceptable PCR values for different service tiers or applications.
4.  **Ephemeral Credential Generation:** Upon successful attestation (PCR values matching defined policies), the AS generates a short-lived, cryptographically signed credential. This credential is *not* a long-term key but a ticket granting access to specific resources.
5.  **Resource Access Control:**  Services requiring access verify the presented credential (signature, validity period) *before* granting access.  The credential can be further scoped to restrict access to specific data or operations.
6.  **Continuous Attestation:**  Implement a mechanism for periodic re-attestation. The instance proactively requests a new credential from the AS, proving its continued integrity. If re-attestation fails (e.g., due to rootkit detection or unauthorized modification), the credential is revoked, and access is denied.
7.  **Policy Enforcement Points (PEP):** PEPs are lightweight agents deployed within the instance (or integrated into the hypervisor) to intercept resource access requests and enforce the credential requirements.

**Pseudocode (PEP):**

```
function intercept_resource_request(resource, operation, user):
  credential = get_presented_credential(user)
  if credential is null:
    log("No credential presented")
    deny_access()
    return

  if is_credential_valid(credential):
    if credential.scope.allows(resource, operation):
      allow_access()
    else:
      log("Credential scope does not allow access")
      deny_access()
  else:
    log("Invalid Credential")
    deny_access()
```

**Innovation/Differentiation:**

*   Moves beyond static key exchange to a dynamic, trust-based access control model.
*   Enables post-boot integrity verification and runtime protection against compromise.
*   Supports fine-grained access control based on application context and security policies.
*   Leverages hardware-bound roots of trust for increased security and tamper resistance.
*   Allows for dynamic revocation of access based on real-time threat detection.
*   Adds a continuous verification layer - the patent focuses on initial boot.
