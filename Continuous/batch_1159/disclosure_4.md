## Dynamic Sensor Fusion & Predictive Illumination

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple sensor switching to a system that *predicts* user intent based on combined sensor data (beyond just light levels) and dynamically adjusts illumination *before* a gesture is fully formed, maximizing capture quality and reducing processing load.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**  Minimum of:
    *   Two pairs of image sensors (as in the patent) – designated “Primary” and “Secondary”.
    *   Microphone array (3+ mics) for audio spatialization.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer and gyroscope.
    *   Optional:  Low-resolution depth sensor (time-of-flight or structured light)
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge processing unit (e.g., Neural Processing Unit or similar) for real-time data fusion and prediction.
*   **Illumination Control:**  Individually addressable LEDs (RGB or IR) associated with *each* sensor.  Brightness, color temperature, and IR output controllable independently.
*   **Data Fusion Algorithm:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on a dataset of user gestures and associated sensor data.  Input features include:
    *   Image data from Primary and Secondary sensors.
    *   Audio features (amplitude, frequency, direction of sound source).
    *   IMU data (acceleration, angular velocity).
    *   Optional: Depth data.
*   **Prediction Module:**  The LSTM network outputs a probability distribution over potential gestures.  A threshold is applied to this distribution to trigger pre-emptive illumination.
*   **Illumination Strategy:**
    *   Based on the predicted gesture and the environment (determined from image analysis), the system adjusts the illumination parameters *before* the gesture is complete.
    *   For example, if a “swipe left” gesture is predicted, the system might illuminate the left side of the field of view more brightly.
    *   IR illumination can be used proactively to improve low-light performance and enable more accurate gesture recognition.
*   **Switching Logic:**  The switching between sensors isn’t solely based on light level.  The system uses the prediction confidence level to dynamically select the most appropriate sensor pair.  If confidence is high, the Primary sensor pair is used.  If confidence is low, the Secondary sensor pair (potentially with different characteristics like IR sensitivity) is engaged.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
Load LSTM model

//Main Loop
Capture data from all sensors

Extract features from sensor data

Input features into LSTM model

Get gesture probability distribution

If max(probability_distribution) > confidence_threshold:
    predicted_gesture = argmax(probability_distribution)

    //Pre-emptive Illumination
    If predicted_gesture == "Swipe Left":
        Increase LED brightness on left side of field of view
    Else If predicted_gesture == "Pinch Zoom":
        Increase IR illumination for depth sensing
    Else:
        Maintain current illumination settings

//Sensor Selection
If confidence > high_threshold:
    selected_sensor_pair = primary_sensor_pair
Else:
    selected_sensor_pair = secondary_sensor_pair

Switch to selected_sensor_pair

Analyze image data from selected_sensor_pair to confirm gesture

```

**Refinements:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The LSTM model can be continuously retrained with new user data to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Personalized Profiles:**  The system can create personalized profiles for each user, adapting to their unique gesture patterns.
*   **Multi-User Support:**  The system can use computer vision techniques to identify multiple users and track their gestures simultaneously.
*   **Integration with Augmented Reality:**  The system can be integrated with AR applications to create more immersive and interactive experiences.
