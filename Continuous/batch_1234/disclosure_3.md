## Modular Liquid Cooling Integration with Rack-Level Heat Reclamation

**Concept:** Expand beyond air cooling and integrate a modular liquid cooling system directly into the rack structure, leveraging the bypassed airflow concept to pre-condition the coolant *before* it enters the computer system's cold plates.  This system aims for increased cooling capacity, reduced energy consumption, and potential for rack-level waste heat reclamation.

**Specs:**

*   **Rack Modification:** Standard 19” rack posts integrated with coolant distribution manifolds. Manifolds are segmented, allowing for individual computer system coolant loops or combined loops. Material: Copper alloy for high thermal conductivity and corrosion resistance.
*   **Coolant Distribution:** Each rack unit (RU) space features a dedicated coolant inlet/outlet connection via quick-disconnect fittings. Fittings are standardized to accommodate various cold plate designs.
*   **Bypass Air Integration:**  The existing bypass airflow plenums (as described in the provided patent) are *extended* to encompass a series of finned heat exchangers positioned *before* the coolant enters the computer system. These heat exchangers utilize the bypassed air to pre-cool the coolant before it reaches the cold plates.
*   **Heat Exchanger Design:**  Micro-channel heat exchangers constructed from aluminum alloy.  Fin density optimized for low airflow resistance and high heat transfer.  Modular design to accommodate different RU heights and cooling requirements.
*   **Coolant Reservoir & Pump:** A rack-mounted coolant reservoir with integrated pump and flow meter. Reservoir capacity scalable based on rack population.  Pump utilizes variable speed control based on coolant temperature and system load.
*   **Temperature & Flow Sensors:**  Multiple temperature and flow sensors strategically placed throughout the system (coolant inlet/outlet, bypassed airflow, cold plates) to monitor performance and provide real-time feedback to the control system.
*   **Control System:** A rack-mounted microcontroller with embedded software to monitor system parameters, adjust pump speed, and provide alerts in case of anomalies.  Communication via Ethernet for remote monitoring and control.
*   **Waste Heat Reclamation:** Integrate a secondary heat exchanger *after* the computer system cold plates to capture waste heat from the coolant. This heat can be directed to a water-water heat pump for use in building heating/cooling or for other applications.
*   **Leak Detection:** Implement a redundant leak detection system throughout the rack, utilizing conductive sensors and automatic shut-off valves.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Variables
coolant_inlet_temp = 0.0
coolant_outlet_temp = 0.0
bypass_airflow_temp = 0.0
pump_speed = 0.0
target_coolant_temp = 25.0 // Celsius

// Main Loop
while (true) {

  // Read Sensor Data
  coolant_inlet_temp = readSensor(coolant_inlet_sensor)
  coolant_outlet_temp = readSensor(coolant_outlet_sensor)
  bypass_airflow_temp = readSensor(bypass_airflow_sensor)

  // Calculate Temperature Difference
  temp_diff = target_coolant_temp - coolant_inlet_temp

  // Adjust Pump Speed
  if (temp_diff > 5.0) {
    pump_speed = pump_speed + 0.05; // Increase pump speed
  } else if (temp_diff < -5.0) {
    pump_speed = pump_speed - 0.05; // Decrease pump speed
  }

  // Limit Pump Speed
  if (pump_speed > 100.0) {
    pump_speed = 100.0;
  } else if (pump_speed < 20.0) {
    pump_speed = 20.0;
  }

  // Set Pump Speed
  setPumpSpeed(pump_speed);

  //Log Data
  logData(coolant_inlet_temp, coolant_outlet_temp, bypass_airflow_temp, pump_speed)

  //Delay
  delay(1000);

}
```

**Novelty:** This design moves beyond simple air cooling and integrates liquid cooling *directly* into the rack infrastructure.  By pre-conditioning the coolant with bypassed airflow, it increases cooling efficiency and potentially allows for waste heat reclamation, all within a modular, scalable system. The integration of rack-level control and monitoring further enhances performance and reliability.
