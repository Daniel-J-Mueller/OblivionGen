## Role-Based Dynamic Resource Allocation with Predictive Expiration

**Concept:** Extend the managed lifecycle roles concept to encompass dynamic allocation of *resources* alongside credentials, and introduce a predictive expiration model based on resource utilization patterns. Instead of just managing role *access*, manage the resources *assigned* via the role, and predict when those resources will no longer be needed, automatically adjusting or revoking access.

**Specification:**

**1. Resource Profiles:**

*   Each managed lifecycle role is associated with a Resource Profile.
*   The Resource Profile defines the *types* and *quantities* of resources associated with the role (e.g., CPU cycles, storage space, network bandwidth, access to specific APIs, data access permissions).
*   Resource Profiles include configurable thresholds for utilization monitoring (e.g., CPU usage > 80%, storage nearing capacity).

**2. Usage Tracking & Prediction Engine:**

*   A Usage Tracking module logs resource consumption for each role in real-time.
*   A Prediction Engine analyzes historical usage data (minimum 30-day history) to forecast future resource needs. Algorithms employed: Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA, potentially basic Neural Networks.
*   The Prediction Engine generates a “Resource Burn-Down Curve” projecting resource depletion over time.
*   The Prediction Engine assigns a “Resource Confidence Score” (0-100) indicating the certainty of the prediction. Higher scores indicate more reliable predictions.

**3. Dynamic Allocation & Adjustment:**

*   When a role is activated, the system provisions the resources defined in the Resource Profile.
*   The system continuously monitors resource usage against the predicted burn-down curve.
*   Based on monitored usage and the Resource Confidence Score, the system can:
    *   **Scale Resources:** Increase or decrease allocated resources (e.g., add more CPU cores, increase storage capacity) within pre-defined limits.
    *   **Pre-Emptive Revocation:** If the burn-down curve indicates resource depletion *before* the role’s scheduled expiration, the system can trigger a pre-emptive revocation sequence, releasing resources.  A warning is sent to the role owner 24 hours prior.
    *   **Automated Cost Optimization:** Identify roles with underutilized resources and automatically reduce allocation, transferring resources to roles with higher demand.

**4. Policy-Driven Allocation:**

*   Administrators define allocation policies based on role type, priority, and resource availability.
*   Policies specify maximum resource limits, allowed scaling operations, and revocation rules.

**5. Integration with Credential Vending:**

*   The credential service receives resource allocation information alongside role access.
*   Credentials issued are tied to the allocated resources.
*   If resources are revoked, credentials are automatically invalidated.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation & Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION AllocateResources(role, resourceProfile):
    // Provision resources defined in resourceProfile
    ProvisionResources(role, resourceProfile)
    LogResourceAllocation(role, resourceProfile)

FUNCTION AdjustResources(role):
    usageData = GetUsageData(role)
    prediction = PredictResourceUsage(role, usageData)
    confidence = EvaluatePredictionConfidence(prediction)

    IF confidence > 75:
        IF PredictedResourceNeed > CurrentResourceAllocation:
            ScaleResources(role, PredictedResourceNeed)
        ELSE IF PredictedResourceNeed < CurrentResourceAllocation * 0.2:
            ScaleResources(role, CurrentResourceAllocation * 0.8)

    IF PredictedExpiration < ScheduledExpiration - 24 hours:
        SendWarningToRoleOwner(role, PredictedExpiration)

    IF PredictedExpiration < ScheduledExpiration:
        RevokeResources(role)
        InvalidateCredentials(role)

FUNCTION PredictResourceUsage(role, usageData):
    // Use time series analysis (Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) on usageData
    // Return predicted resource need and expiration time
    //Consider historical usage, seasonality, and trend
```

**Novelty:**

The key novelty is moving beyond simply managing *access* to resources to *actively managing the resources themselves* based on predicted need and tying revocation directly to resource availability, not just time-based expiration. This optimizes resource utilization and reduces waste.  The Resource Confidence Score adds a layer of intelligence, preventing premature revocation based on unreliable predictions.
