## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Personalized Presence Profiles

**Concept:** Extend presence detection beyond simple “present/not present” to create dynamic acoustic zones within an environment, correlated to personalized user profiles. This moves beyond simple wake-word triggering, creating a more contextually aware and responsive system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 mics) with beamforming capabilities. Array placement optimized for room geometry.
*   Dedicated edge processing unit (Neural Processing Unit – NPU) for localized audio processing.
*   Optional: Low-resolution thermal camera for coarse person detection and activity level assessment (integrated with audio analysis).

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Zone Definition Module:** Allows user configuration of acoustic zones within a physical space (e.g., “Living Room – Sofa”, “Kitchen – Counter”, “Home Office”). Zones can be defined via a GUI or through automated room mapping using microphone array data.
*   **Personalized Presence Profiles:** Stores user-specific acoustic signatures (speech patterns, coughing sounds, typical movement noises). Profiles are built over time through passive learning.  Profiles also store preferred interaction parameters (volume, voice assistant personality, etc.) tied to specific zones.
*   **Acoustic Event Classification:**  Deep learning model trained to classify a broad range of acoustic events beyond simple “human presence”. Categories include:
    *   Speech (intent classification and speaker identification)
    *   Non-speech sounds (cough, sneeze, footsteps, door closing, appliance operation, music, TV)
    *   Environmental noise (HVAC, traffic)
*   **Zone-Specific Audio Processing:** Audio data from each microphone is assigned to its corresponding zone. Processing includes noise reduction, beamforming, and acoustic event classification.
*   **Contextual Awareness Engine:** Combines acoustic event classification, personalized presence profiles, and zone information to determine user intent and context.
*   **Adaptive Response System:** Adjusts device behavior based on contextual awareness. Examples:
    *   Dynamically adjust smart home device settings (lighting, temperature) based on user location and activity.
    *   Prioritize voice assistant responses based on user location and identified needs.
    *   Provide localized audio notifications (e.g., a reminder delivered to the kitchen counter zone).
*   **Privacy Management:** End-to-end encryption of audio data. Local processing whenever possible.  User control over data retention and sharing.

**3. Pseudocode (Contextual Awareness Engine):**

```
FUNCTION DetermineContext(zone, acousticEvents, userProfile)

  // 1. Filter acoustic events for relevance to zone and user profile
  relevantEvents = FilterEvents(acousticEvents, zone, userProfile)

  // 2. Score events based on confidence and relevance
  eventScores = ScoreEvents(relevantEvents)

  // 3. Identify dominant events and potential user intent
  dominantEvents = IdentifyDominantEvents(eventScores)
  intent = DetermineIntent(dominantEvents, userProfile)

  // 4. Adjust device behavior based on intent and context
  AdjustDeviceBehavior(intent, zone, userProfile)

  RETURN intent
```

**4. System Workflow:**

1.  Microphone array captures audio data.
2.  Audio data is segmented into frames and assigned to appropriate acoustic zones.
3.  Acoustic Event Classification analyzes audio frames to identify relevant events.
4.  Contextual Awareness Engine combines event data, user profiles, and zone information to determine user intent and context.
5.  Adaptive Response System adjusts device behavior accordingly.
6.  System continuously learns and adapts based on user interactions and feedback.

**5. Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple presence detection to create a more nuanced understanding of the user’s environment and intent. The combination of acoustic zoning, personalized profiles, and contextual awareness enables a more proactive and responsive smart home experience.  By focusing on a wider range of acoustic events and correlating them to user behavior, the system can anticipate needs and provide more relevant assistance.
