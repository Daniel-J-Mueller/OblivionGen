## Dynamic Packet Payload Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the configurable pipeline concept to allow *reconstruction* of packet payloads mid-stream, enabling advanced data manipulation and insertion *without* full decoding/encoding cycles.  This goes beyond simple header modification and allows for targeted alterations within the data itself.

**Specifications:**

*   **Payload Fragment Identification:** Each packet will contain metadata indicating whether it’s a ‘complete’ payload or a ‘fragment’ of a larger payload.  This metadata is embedded in a dedicated section of the packet header, distinct from standard routing information.
*   **Fragment Buffer Pool:**  A dedicated memory pool, managed by the interconnect, will store payload fragments.  The size of the pool is configurable, and fragments will have a time-to-live (TTL) to prevent indefinite storage.
*   **Reconstruction Component:** A new type of ‘packet processing component’ – the ‘Payload Reconstruction Engine’ (PRE) – is added to the pipeline.  The PRE performs the following:
    *   **Fragment Detection:** Identifies packets marked as fragments.
    *   **Buffer Access:** Retrieves the corresponding fragment(s) from the Fragment Buffer Pool using a fragment ID embedded in the packet header.
    *   **Payload Assembly:**  Combines the retrieved fragment(s) with the current packet’s payload.  Assembly order is determined by a sequence number also in the header.
    *   **Complete Packet Marking:**  Marks the reassembled packet as ‘complete’ and updates the header accordingly.
*   **Payload Splitting Component:** A complimentary component which can split large payloads into fragments, assigning fragment IDs and sequence numbers before transmission. This component *must* operate on a byte stream, as opposed to a full packet, to prevent needless overhead.
*   **Dynamic Buffer Allocation:** The interconnect will dynamically allocate buffer space within the Fragment Buffer Pool based on packet size and TTL. This is critical for scalability.
*   **Interconnect Modification:**  The interconnect *must* support direct memory access (DMA) for rapid transfer of payload fragments to and from the Buffer Pool.  It also needs a mechanism to synchronize access to the Buffer Pool, preventing race conditions.

**Pseudocode (PRE Component):**

```
function processPacket(packet):
    if packet.isFragment():
        fragmentId = packet.getFragmentId()
        sequenceNumber = packet.getSequenceNumber()

        fragmentData = getFragmentFromBufferPool(fragmentId)

        if fragmentData != null:
            completePayload = assemblePayload(packet.getPayload(), fragmentData, sequenceNumber)
            packet.setPayload(completePayload)
            packet.setIsFragment(false)
            packet.setIsComplete(true)
        else:
            //Fragment not found - drop the packet or request retransmission.
            logError("Fragment not found: " + fragmentId)
            dropPacket() //or request retransmit
    else:
        //Pass through complete packets unmodified
        pass

function assemblePayload(currentPayload, fragmentData, sequenceNumber):
    //Implement logic to combine payloads based on sequence number.
    //This could be as simple as concatenation for sequential fragments,
    //or more complex for out-of-order fragments.
    //Ensure proper byte order and alignment.
    return combinedPayload
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Real-time video/audio processing:**  Enable in-stream modification of media content (watermarking, censorship, effects) *without* full decoding/encoding.
*   **Security:**  Dynamically insert security payloads into data streams for encryption or intrusion detection.
*   **Network optimization:**  Repair damaged packets on the fly by fetching missing data from redundant sources.
*   **Data augmentation:**  Add metadata or tags to data streams for analysis or tracking.
