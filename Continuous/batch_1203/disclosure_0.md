## Adaptive Data Provenance & Predictive Re-computation

**Concept:** Extend the MapReduce system to incorporate real-time data provenance tracking *within* the data stream itself, combined with predictive re-computation triggers based on potential data corruption or staleness.

**Specification:**

**1. Provenance Encoding:**

*   Modify the map task to prepend a provenance header to each output message.
*   Header fields:
    *   `DataID`: Unique identifier for the original data source.
    *   `Lineage`: Nested list tracking all preceding map/reduce tasks & parameters applied.
    *   `Timestamp`: Creation timestamp.
    *   `Checksum`:  CRC32/SHA256 checksum of the data payload.
*   The stream processing system must be able to parse this header *without* impacting stream throughput.

**2. Stream-Based Validation & Monitoring:**

*   Introduce a 'Validator' microservice deployed alongside the stream processing system.
*   Validator subscribes to the output stream.
*   For each message, Validator:
    *   Retrieves the original data source (using `DataID`).
    *   Recalculates the checksum based on the original data.
    *   Compares recalculated checksum with the header checksum.
    *   If checksums mismatch, flags the message as potentially corrupted.
    *   Monitors data staleness.  If the original data source hasn't been updated within a defined window, flags the message as potentially stale.

**3. Predictive Re-Computation Trigger:**

*   Introduce a "Re-computation Manager" service.
*   Re-computation Manager receives alerts from the Validator (checksum mismatch, data staleness).
*   Based on the alert and configurable policies (e.g., criticality of data, acceptable error rate), the Re-computation Manager:
    *   Identifies the affected portion of the MapReduce pipeline.  (Uses the `Lineage` information in the message header.)
    *   Initiates a targeted re-computation of that section of the pipeline.  (e.g., re-run the map task, re-run the reduce task for a specific sub-stream.)
    *   The re-computation uses the original data source and the stored parameters from the `Lineage` to ensure consistency.

**4. Stream Partitioning Enhancement:**

*   The stream processing system should support a dynamic partitioning key based on data 'age' or 'confidence level'.
*   Messages with low confidence (e.g., recently re-computed) are placed on a separate sub-stream with higher priority.
*   This ensures that fresh data is processed before potentially stale data.

**Pseudocode (Re-computation Manager):**

```
function handle_validation_alert(alert):
  affected_pipeline_section = extract_pipeline_section_from_alert(alert)
  recomputation_policy = get_recomputation_policy(affected_pipeline_section)

  if recomputation_policy.enabled:
    if alert.type == "checksum_mismatch" or alert.type == "data_staleness":
      original_data_source = alert.data_source
      pipeline_parameters = alert.pipeline_parameters

      # Trigger re-computation of the affected section
      recompute_result = trigger_recomputation(original_data_source, pipeline_parameters, affected_pipeline_section)

      # Update the stream with the re-computed results
      publish_recomputed_results_to_stream(recompute_result)
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   Focus on minimizing overhead for provenance encoding and checksum calculation.
*   Ensure the stream processing system can handle the additional metadata without impacting throughput.
*   The re-computation trigger should be configurable and adaptable to different data sources and pipeline configurations.
*   Consider implementing a caching layer for frequently accessed data to reduce the need for re-computation.
