**Adaptive Application Sandboxing with Behavioral Drift Detection**

**Concept:** Extend the risk assessment framework to include runtime sandboxing that *dynamically adjusts* based on observed application behavior, combined with drift detection to identify potentially malicious deviations. This goes beyond static risk scores and aims for proactive containment.

**Specs:**

*   **Sandbox Kernel Module:** A lightweight kernel module providing application isolation. Initial isolation levels are determined by the pre-installation risk assessment (from the base patent).
*   **Behavioral Monitoring Agent:** A user-space agent attached to the target application, monitoring system calls, network activity, file system access, and memory usage.
*   **Baseline Profiler:** During a ‘learning’ period (configurable duration), the Behavioral Monitoring Agent establishes a baseline profile of ‘normal’ application behavior – allowed system calls, network patterns, file access locations, etc. This profile is statistically modeled (e.g., using Hidden Markov Models or similar).
*   **Drift Detection Algorithm:** Continuously compares current application behavior against the baseline profile. Implements statistical drift detection techniques (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, change point detection) to identify deviations. A 'drift score' is calculated.
*   **Adaptive Sandbox Control:** Based on the drift score:
    *   **Low Drift:** No change in sandbox level.
    *   **Medium Drift:** Increased monitoring frequency; restrictions on access to sensitive resources (e.g., network, critical files); logging intensified.
    *   **High Drift:** Application is throttled or temporarily suspended. A full memory dump is captured for forensic analysis. Sandbox level is elevated to maximum isolation (e.g., virtual machine within the sandbox).
*   **Policy Engine:** A centralized component managing sandbox policies, drift thresholds, and actions. Allows administrators to define custom rules based on application type, user role, and data sensitivity.
*   **Network Virtualization Integration:** Sandboxing extends to network activity, potentially using virtual network interfaces and traffic shaping to limit external communication.
*   **Data Labeling & Feedback Loop:**  Monitor all sandbox actions. Provide users/admins with options to label/classify sandbox events (e.g., ‘false positive’, ‘malicious activity’). This data is fed back into the Policy Engine to improve accuracy and refine drift detection models.

**Pseudocode (Drift Detection & Adaptive Control):**

```
// Function: DetectBehavioralDrift(currentBehavior, baselineProfile)
// Input:  currentBehavior - vector of application behavior metrics
//         baselineProfile - Statistical model of normal behavior
// Output: driftScore - Score indicating the degree of deviation

driftScore = CalculateStatisticalDistance(currentBehavior, baselineProfile)  // e.g., using KS test

return driftScore

// Function: AdjustSandboxLevel(driftScore, currentSandboxLevel)
// Input: driftScore - The degree of behavioral drift
//        currentSandboxLevel - The current level of sandbox isolation
// Output: newSandboxLevel - The adjusted level of isolation

if driftScore < LOW_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
  newSandboxLevel = currentSandboxLevel
elif driftScore < MEDIUM_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
  newSandboxLevel = currentSandboxLevel + 1
  IncreaseMonitoringFrequency()
  RestrictSensitiveResourceAccess()
elif driftScore < HIGH_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
  newSandboxLevel = currentSandboxLevel + 2
  ThrottleApplication()
  CaptureMemoryDump()
  ElevateToVirtualMachine()
else:
  TerminateApplication()

return newSandboxLevel
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `BehaviorProfile`: A statistical model (e.g., HMM, Gaussian Mixture Model) representing normal application behavior.
*   `SandboxPolicy`:  Defines default sandbox levels, drift thresholds, and actions for different application types/user roles.
*   `SandboxState`: Current state of the sandbox (isolation level, monitoring frequency, resource restrictions).
