## Dynamic Metric Granularity & Predictive Partitioning

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on partitioning based on a hash of metadata and timestamps. This builds upon that by introducing *dynamic* metric granularity and *predictive* partitioning, shifting from reactive partitioning to proactive optimization based on anticipated data patterns.

**Specs:**

**1. Metric Granularity Profiles:**

*   Define configurable "Granularity Profiles" which dictate the level of detail captured for a metric. Levels: `Raw`, `Aggregated`, `Statistical`.
*   `Raw`:  Captures every data point (like the existing system). High storage cost, high detail.
*   `Aggregated`: Pre-aggregates data (e.g., average, sum) at configurable intervals (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes). Reduced storage cost, moderate detail.
*   `Statistical`: Captures only statistical summaries (e.g., min, max, standard deviation, percentile). Lowest storage cost, lowest detail.
*   Each metric is assigned a Granularity Profile. Profiles can be changed *dynamically* based on real-time analysis.

**2. Predictive Partitioning Engine:**

*   Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future data volumes *per metric*. This prediction considers historical data, seasonality, and external factors (if applicable).
*   Based on the predicted data volume, the engine dynamically adjusts the number of partitions allocated to each metric. Higher predicted volume = more partitions.
*   The engine incorporates "Hot/Cold" data awareness.  Recent data (e.g., last hour) is allocated more partitions for faster access. Older data gets fewer partitions.
*   The system pre-allocates partitions *before* data arrives, reducing latency.

**3. Partitioning Key Generation:**

*   Partitioning Key = `Hash(Metric ID, Timestamp Bucket, Granularity Profile)`.
    *   `Timestamp Bucket`:  Data is grouped into configurable time buckets (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes).
    *   `Granularity Profile`: This ensures that different granularity levels for the same metric are partitioned separately.
*   The hashing algorithm should be fast and distribute data evenly across partitions.

**4. Dynamic Profile Switching:**

*   Monitor the query patterns for each metric.
*   If a metric is frequently queried for detailed data (Raw), *temporarily* switch the Granularity Profile to Raw.
*   If a metric is only used for high-level dashboards, switch to Aggregated or Statistical.
*   This switching is automated based on configurable thresholds.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Partition Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_partitions(metric_id, predicted_volume):
  target_partitions = calculate_target_partitions(predicted_volume)
  current_partitions = get_current_partitions(metric_id)

  if target_partitions > current_partitions:
    add_partitions(metric_id, target_partitions - current_partitions)
  elif target_partitions < current_partitions:
    remove_partitions(metric_id, current_partitions - target_partitions)
  end if
end function

function calculate_target_partitions(predicted_volume):
  // Use a configurable function to map predicted volume to partition count.
  // Example: partition_count = sqrt(predicted_volume)
  return partition_count
end function
```

**5.  Metadata Enhancement:**

*   Add a "Data Quality" flag to each data point. Flags indicate whether the data is valid, potentially stale, or incomplete. This helps downstream processes filter out unreliable data.
*   Include a "Source" field to identify the origin of the data (e.g., load balancer, application server).  Facilitates debugging and root cause analysis.
