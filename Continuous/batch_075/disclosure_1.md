## Secure Key Orchestration via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the secure key handling within the trusted execution environment (TEE) to leverage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) for dynamic key access control and auditing, moving beyond simple revocation lists. This creates a more granular, flexible, and auditable system for managing cryptographic material.

**Specifications:**

**1. DID/VC Integration Module within TEE:**

*   **Function:** A dedicated module within the TEE responsible for handling DIDs and VCs.
*   **Components:**
    *   DID Resolver: Resolves DIDs to DID Documents containing public keys and service endpoints.
    *   VC Verifier: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of VCs.
    *   Credential Store: Securely stores VCs received and used for access control.

**2. Key Issuance and Binding:**

*   **Process:** When a secret key is generated, a corresponding DID is created and registered. A VC is issued by a trusted authority (e.g., an organization, a key management service) to the key's owner, attesting to their authorization to use the key for specific purposes.
*   **VC Structure:**
    *   `issuer`: The DID of the issuing authority.
    *   `subject`: The DID of the key's owner.
    *   `credentialSchema`: A defined schema outlining the authorized operations (e.g., encryption, decryption, signing).
    *   `validityPeriod`: Time window the VC is valid.
    *   `authorizationDetails`:  Granular control over key usage, like specific data types, applications, or services.

**3. Access Control Flow:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** A client requests a cryptographic operation using a specific secret key.
2.  **VC Request:** The TEE requests a VC from the client proving authorization for the requested operation.
3.  **VC Presentation:** The client presents the VC to the TEE.
4.  **VC Verification:** The TEE verifies the VC's authenticity, integrity, and validity against the issuer's DID document.
5.  **Policy Enforcement:** The TEE examines the VC’s `authorizationDetails` to determine if the requested operation is permitted.
6.  **Operation Execution:** If authorized, the TEE performs the cryptographic operation.

**4. Dynamic Revocation & Policy Updates:**

*   Instead of revocation lists, issuers can dynamically update VC policies. 
*   A “revocation” is handled by issuing a new VC with updated authorization details or a shorter validity period, effectively superseding the previous VC.
*   The TEE monitors for updated VCs and automatically adjusts access control accordingly.

**5. Auditing and Logging:**

*   All access control decisions and VC verifications are logged within the TEE.
*   Logs include the issuer DID, subject DID, requested operation, and access control outcome.
*   Logs can be securely retrieved for auditing purposes.

**Pseudocode (Access Control):**

```
function performCryptoOperation(operation, keyIdentifier, data):
  VC = client.presentCredential()
  if VC == null:
    return "Error: No credential presented"

  if !verifyCredential(VC):
    return "Error: Invalid credential"

  authorizationDetails = VC.getAuthorizationDetails()

  if !isOperationAuthorized(operation, authorizationDetails):
    return "Error: Operation not authorized"

  key = loadKey(keyIdentifier)

  result = executeCryptoOperation(key, operation, data)

  logAccess(VC.issuer, VC.subject, operation, "Authorized")

  return result
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   TEE capable hardware (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone).
*   Secure storage for VCs and private keys within the TEE.
*   DID resolver and VC verifier libraries.
*   API for client interaction and VC presentation.

This approach moves beyond static revocation lists to a dynamic, policy-based access control system, offering greater flexibility, security, and auditability for cryptographic material. It leverages emerging decentralized identity standards to create a more robust and trustworthy key management infrastructure.
