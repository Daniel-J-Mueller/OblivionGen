## Dynamic Key Weaving with Temporal Drift

**Concept:** Expand the multi-key system not just across geographic zones, but *within* a single zone over time, creating a constantly shifting authentication landscape. This moves beyond simple geographic segregation to a more granular, time-sensitive security model.

**Specification:**

1.  **Temporal Keys:**  Instead of static zone-based keys, generate keys with embedded timestamps.  These timestamps define a "validity window" for the key.  A key valid from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM will be different than one valid from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM, even within the same geographic zone.

2.  **Key Derivation Function – Temporal Component:** Modify the key derivation function to include the current time (or a time slice) as an input.  

    ```pseudocode
    function deriveKey(userInfo, baseKey, timeSlice):
        salt = getUserSpecificSalt(userInfo)
        combinedInput = userInfo + baseKey + salt + timeSlice
        derivedKey = hash(combinedInput)
        return derivedKey
    ```

3.  **Rolling Key Updates:**  Implement a system where keys are pre-generated for future time slices.  For example, pre-generate keys for the next 24 hours. As the current time slice expires, the next set of keys become active.  

4.  **Key Distribution – Time-Aware Proxy:**  A proxy server intercepts authentication requests and determines the appropriate key to use based on the *request timestamp*. The proxy fetches the correct key from a secure key store.

    ```pseudocode
    function handleAuthenticationRequest(request):
        requestTimestamp = getTimestampFromRequest(request)
        zone = getZoneFromRequest(request) 
        key = getKeyStore().getKey(zone, requestTimestamp)
        forwardRequestToAuthenticationServer(request, key)
    ```

5. **Key Revocation – Fine-Grained Control:**  If a key is compromised, the revocation process doesn’t need to invalidate all keys for that zone. Instead, only keys for the compromised time slice need to be invalidated, minimizing disruption.

6. **Drift Factor:** Introduce a "drift factor" – a random, small time offset – applied to the key derivation.  This adds an extra layer of obfuscation. The drift factor would be unique to each user or session.

7. **Key Store Architecture:**  A time-indexed key store that allows for efficient retrieval of keys based on zone and timestamp. Could be implemented as a multi-level map (zone -> timestamp -> key).

**Innovation:** This shifts from static key assignments to a dynamic, time-sensitive authentication model. Compromise of a key only impacts a limited time window, increasing overall system resilience.  The drift factor introduces non-determinism, making it harder for attackers to predict keys.  It addresses the problem of long-lived key compromise in static multi-key systems.
