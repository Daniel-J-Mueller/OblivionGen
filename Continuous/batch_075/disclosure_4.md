## Modular Battery System with Wireless Charging & Thermal Regulation

**Concept:** A user-device battery system employing magnetically-attached, modular battery "cells" coupled with integrated wireless charging and a dynamic thermal regulation system. This moves beyond simple removable attachment to a dynamically configurable power solution.

**Specs:**

*   **Battery Cell Dimensions:** 50mm x 30mm x 8mm (scalable based on device needs)
*   **Cell Capacity:** 1000mAh per cell (scalable)
*   **Cell Connection:** High-strength neodymium magnets arranged in a polar pattern for secure, reliable connection. Minimum holding force: 5kg per cell. Magnetic shielding incorporated to prevent interference with device electronics.
*   **Wireless Charging Receiver:** Integrated Qi-compatible wireless charging receiver within each cell. Supports fast wireless charging standards (up to 15W).
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Near Field Communication (NFC) tag embedded in each cell.  Transmits cell ID, state of charge (SOC), temperature, and manufacturing data. Device reads this data to manage power distribution and display information.
*   **Thermal Regulation:** Each cell incorporates a miniature Peltier element (thermoelectric cooler/heater) controlled by the device. This allows for individual cell temperature management.
*   **Device Integration:**
    *   **Battery Bay:** Device features a recessed “battery bay” accommodating multiple cells. Bay dimensions scalable for different device sizes.
    *   **Magnetic Alignment Guides:** Internal magnetic guides within the bay assist user in aligning and seating cells.
    *   **Contact Points:**  Minimal gold-plated contact points within the bay provide data communication (NFC) and power distribution. No direct electrical connection required for power transfer beyond initial device boot.
    *   **Power Management IC:** Device includes a dedicated Power Management Integrated Circuit (PMIC) which:
        *   Reads cell data via NFC.
        *   Dynamically adjusts power draw from each cell based on SOC, temperature, and device load.
        *   Controls Peltier elements for thermal regulation.
        *   Implements safety features (over-voltage, over-current, thermal runaway protection).
*   **Software Interface:**
    *   Displays real-time SOC and temperature of each cell.
    *   Allows user to prioritize cells for discharge (e.g., discharge hotter cells first).
    *   Provides diagnostic information (cell health, estimated lifespan).

**Pseudocode (PMIC Logic):**

```
// Initialize: Read cell count, max voltage, min voltage, thermal limits

loop:
  // Read cell data (NFC):  ID, SOC, temperature, voltage, current
  for each cell:
    cellData[cellID] = readNFC(cellID)

  // Check for cell failures (voltage out of range, temp over limit)
  for each cell:
    if (cellData[cellID].voltage < minVoltage OR cellData[cellID].voltage > maxVoltage OR cellData[cellID].temperature > thermalLimit):
      flagCellAsFaulty(cellID)

  // Calculate total available power
  totalPower = 0
  for each cell (excluding faulty cells):
    totalPower += (cellData[cellID].SOC * cellCapacity)

  // Determine device power demand
  deviceDemand = calculateDevicePowerDemand()

  // Power Distribution Algorithm
  if (deviceDemand <= totalPower):
    // Distribute power evenly across available cells, prioritizing cells with higher SOC
    for each cell:
      powerDraw = calculatePowerDraw(cellData[cellID].SOC, deviceDemand)
      controlPowerRegulator(cellID, powerDraw)
  else:
    // Power limiting mode - reduce device performance to match available power
    reduceDevicePerformance()
    //Re-run power distribution algorithm with reduced device demand
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond simply *attaching* batteries to proactively *managing* a distributed power system at the cell level. Allows for dynamic capacity expansion (add more cells), load balancing, and thermal optimization, increasing battery life and device performance.  This system could also support ‘hot swapping’ of cells.
