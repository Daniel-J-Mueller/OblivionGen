    *   Local processing unit (integrated into audio interface or separate hub). Minimal processing requirements.
    *   Cloud connectivity (optional, for data aggregation/model improvement).
*   **Software:**
    *   Biofeedback data acquisition & processing module.
    *   Real-time stress/cognitive load detection algorithm (trained on user-specific data).
    *   Dynamic action prioritization module.
    *   Integration with existing network-based control service (as per patent).
    *   User profile/settings storage (local & cloud).

**Innovation Description:**

This system leverages real-time biofeedback data to dynamically adjust the prioritization of scheduled actions. The existing patent details scheduling actions even when network connectivity is intermittent. This builds on that by *intelligently* deferring or accelerating actions based on the user’s current physiological state.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Baseline Calibration:** User wears biofeedback sensor. System establishes a baseline physiological state during periods of low cognitive load/stress (e.g., during initial setup or designated ‘calm’ periods).
2.  **Action Scheduling:** User schedules an action (e.g., “Remind me to take medication at 8 PM”).  The request is handled as in the base patent – scheduled locally if possible, queued if not.
3.  **Real-time Monitoring:** Biofeedback sensor continuously monitors user's physiological signals (HRV, EDA).
4.  **Stress/Load Detection:** The system analyzes biofeedback data to determine user's current stress/cognitive load level. This analysis may employ machine learning models.
5.  **Dynamic Prioritization:** Based on detected stress/load, the system adjusts action prioritization:
    *   **High Stress/Load:** Defer non-critical actions (e.g., informational requests, non-urgent home automation tasks).  Prioritize actions that could *reduce* stress (e.g., calming music, guided meditation – if such actions are scheduled).
    *   **Low Stress/Load:** Proceed with scheduled actions as planned.  Potentially *accelerate* actions if user is receptive.
6.  **Adaptive Learning:** System learns user's individual responses to different stimuli and adjusts prioritization algorithms accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Prioritization Module):**

```
function prioritize_action(action, user_stress_level):
  if user_stress_level > threshold_high:
    if action.priority == "low":
      action.status = "deferred"
      return false // Action not executed now
    else:
      // High-priority action – proceed
      return true
  elif user_stress_level < threshold_low:
    //User is calm - accelerate if possible
    if action.acceleratable:
      action.execute_now()
  else:
    //Normal processing
    action.execute_at_scheduled_time()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Healthcare:**  Deferring medication reminders when a patient is experiencing acute stress.
*   **Productivity Enhancement:** Deferring informational notifications during periods of intense focus.
*   **Adaptive Home Automation:**  Adjusting lighting/temperature based on user’s stress levels.
*   **Emotional Wellbeing:**  Providing calming stimuli during periods of anxiety.
