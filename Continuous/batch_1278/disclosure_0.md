**Personalized 'Influence' Network Visualization & Recommendation**

**Concept:** Expand the notification system to build a dynamic, visualized 'influence' network, showing *why* someone purchased an item, based on connections and shared preferences. It’s about going beyond ‘X bought this’ to ‘X bought this *because* Y and Z (who you also trust/are connected to) bought it.’ This drives more meaningful recommendations.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Collection & Graph Construction:**
    *   Collect user connection data (explicit friend lists, social networks, shared community memberships).
    *   Analyze purchase history to identify item co-purchases and user similarities.
    *   Construct a weighted graph where:
        *   Nodes = Users & Items
        *   Edges =
            *   User-User: Strength based on connection type, shared communities, shared purchases.
            *   User-Item: Strength based on purchase frequency/recency.
            *   Item-Item: Strength based on co-purchase frequency.

2.  **'Influence Path' Algorithm:**
    *   When a user views an item:
        *   Algorithm identifies ‘influence paths’ – sequences of connected users & items leading to the item.
        *   Example:  User A views Item X. Path: User A -> Friend B -> Friend B purchased Item X. Or: User A -> Shared Community C -> Members of C frequently purchased Item X.
        *   Paths are scored based on edge weights & path length (shorter paths = stronger influence).

3.  **Visualization Layer:**
    *   Interactive graph visualization presented to the user.
    *   User can ‘zoom’ into influence paths to see *who* influenced the purchase, and *why*.
    *   Node colors/sizes represent influence strength/frequency.
    *   Ability to filter paths based on connection type (friends, community members, etc.).

4.  **Recommendation Engine Enhancement:**
    *   Recommendations are weighted not just by item similarity or user history, but also by the strength of influence paths.
    *   'Influenced Recommendations' section highlights items purchased through strong influence paths.
    *   "People You Trust Also Like..." style recommendations.

5.  **Privacy Controls:**
    *   Users can control the visibility of their connections and purchase history.
    *   Option to opt-out of influence network participation.
    *   Data anonymization/aggregation options.

**Pseudocode (Influence Path Algorithm):**

```
function findInfluencePaths(user, item, maxPathLength):
  paths = []
  queue = [[user, [user]]] // [current node, path so far]

  while queue is not empty:
    currentNode, currentPath = queue.pop(0)

    if currentNode == item:
      paths.append(currentPath)
      continue

    if length(currentPath) > maxPathLength:
      continue

    neighbors = getNeighbors(currentNode) //Returns users/items connected to currentNode

    for neighbor in neighbors:
      if neighbor not in currentPath: //Prevent cycles
        newPath = currentPath + [neighbor]
        queue.append([neighbor, newPath])

  //Score Paths (example: sum of edge weights)
  scoredPaths = scorePaths(paths)

  return sorted(scoredPaths, key=lambda x: x['score'], reverse=True)
```
