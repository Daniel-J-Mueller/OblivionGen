## Dynamic Haptic Chapter Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the chapter navigation system beyond visual indicators by integrating dynamic haptic feedback representing chapter length and position within the book. This creates an intuitive, tactile map of the book’s structure directly on the touchscreen.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Haptic Grid:** The touchscreen will be overlaid with a high-resolution haptic grid capable of generating localized vibrations and textures. This grid will be invisible to the user during normal reading.
2.  **Chapter Data Acquisition:** Upon loading an ebook, the system will analyze the table of contents and chapter lengths to create a proportional haptic representation.
3.  **Haptic Activation Modes:**
    *   **Overview Mode:** Activated by a dedicated gesture (e.g., a long press with two fingers). This mode will display a ‘heat map’ of the book’s structure. Longer chapters will generate stronger or wider vibrations, while shorter chapters will have more focused, gentle feedback. The user can 'scan' the screen to feel the relative lengths and positions of chapters.
    *   **Navigation Mode:** When the user swipes horizontally (or vertically, configurable in settings), the system will provide haptic feedback corresponding to the chapter being passed. The intensity of the feedback will reflect the chapter's length. This allows for 'blind' navigation through chapters.
    *   **Bookmark Mode:** Bookmarks will be represented by distinctive haptic textures (e.g., a pulsing vibration or a repeating pattern). The user can feel the location of their bookmarks on the screen.
4.  **Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// On ebook load:
function analyze_ebook(ebook_file):
  toc = extract_table_of_contents(ebook_file)
  chapter_lengths = calculate_chapter_lengths(toc)
  create_haptic_map(chapter_lengths)

// On overview mode activation:
function activate_overview_mode():
  display_haptic_map()

// On navigation swipe:
function on_swipe(direction):
  current_chapter = get_current_chapter()
  next_chapter = get_next_chapter(current_chapter, direction)
  haptic_intensity = next_chapter.length
  activate_haptic_feedback(haptic_intensity)

// On bookmark mode activation:
function activate_bookmark_mode():
  for each bookmark in bookmarks:
    position = bookmark.position
    texture = bookmark.texture
    activate_haptic_texture(position, texture)
```

5.  **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   High-resolution haptic engine with localized vibration control.
    *   Sufficient processing power to analyze ebook content and render haptic feedback in real-time.
6.  **User Interface Considerations:**
    *   Adjustable haptic intensity settings to accommodate individual preferences.
    *   Visual feedback (e.g., highlighting) to complement haptic feedback for users with visual impairments.
    *   Option to disable haptic feedback altogether.
7.  **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Haptic representation of ebook metadata (e.g., author, genre).
    *   Integration with voice control for hands-free navigation.
    *   Dynamic haptic feedback based on ebook content (e.g., increased vibration during action scenes).
