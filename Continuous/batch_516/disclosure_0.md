## Dynamic Schema Partitioning with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the auto-partitioning concept to *dynamically* adapt the schema itself based on query patterns and data distribution *within* partitions, combined with predictive load balancing across those dynamically adjusted partitions.

**Motivation:** The existing patent focuses on partitioning based on a defined sort/partition key. This approach assumes a relatively static access pattern. However, real-world data access can be highly variable.  This design targets scenarios where the most efficient schema (and therefore partitioning strategy) *changes* over time.

**Specs:**

**1. Schema Profile Generator (SPG):**

*   **Input:** Query logs, partition metadata (size, access frequency), data distribution statistics within partitions (histogram of key values), schema definition.
*   **Function:** Analyzes query patterns to identify frequently accessed attributes and their relationships.  Builds a 'Schema Profile' representing optimal data layouts (e.g., adding new derived attributes, creating composite indexes within partitions) for minimizing I/O.  This is not a global schema change; it's optimized *per partition*.
*   **Output:**  Schema Profile (JSON format):
    ```json
    {
      "partition_id": "P123",
      "derived_attributes": [
        {"name": "calculated_value", "expression": "attribute_a * attribute_b"},
        {"name": "bucket_id", "expression": "FLOOR(attribute_c / 100)"}
      ],
      "composite_index": ["bucket_id", "attribute_d"]
    }
    ```

**2.  Partition Adaptation Manager (PAM):**

*   **Input:** Schema Profiles (from SPG), Current Partition Schema, Performance Metrics (latency, throughput), Load Balancer Status.
*   **Function:** Monitors performance and load.  Determines when a partition needs adaptation based on predefined thresholds.  Orchestrates schema changes *within* the affected partition.  Handles concurrent access during adaptation.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Monitor:** Collect performance metrics and load balancer data.
    2.  **Evaluate:** If performance drops below a threshold *and* the Schema Profile indicates a potential optimization, trigger adaptation.
    3.  **Adaptation Process:**
        *   **Shadow Index/Attribute Creation:** Create new attributes/indexes in parallel with existing ones.
        *   **Data Migration (Incremental):**  Migrate data to new structures in small batches.
        *   **Query Rewrite:**  Rewrite incoming queries to utilize new structures.  (Implemented via a query planner â€“ see component 4).
        *   **Rollback Mechanism:**  Keep a snapshot of the old schema for rapid rollback in case of errors.
    4.  **Update Metadata:**  Update partition metadata with the new schema definition.

**3. Predictive Load Balancer (PLB):**

*   **Input:** Query History, Partition Schema, Data Distribution Statistics, System Load.
*   **Function:** Predicts future query load and dynamically redistributes partitions across compute nodes *before* load spikes occur.  Considers the schema of each partition when making routing decisions.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Query Pattern Analysis:**  Identify common query types and their associated partitions.
    2.  **Load Prediction:**  Based on historical data, predict future query volume for each partition.
    3.  **Dynamic Partition Routing:**  Route partitions to compute nodes with available capacity, considering the schema and data distribution.
    4.  **Cache Partition Data:** Cache a limited dataset of commonly queried data from frequently accessed partitions in memory on the compute node.

**4. Query Planner & Rewriter:**

*   **Input:** Incoming Query, Partition Metadata (including schema), Data Distribution Statistics.
*   **Function:** Optimizes query execution plan based on the current schema and data distribution within partitions.  Rewrites queries to take advantage of derived attributes and composite indexes.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Consults Partition Metadata to determine the optimal execution plan.
    *   Rewrites queries to use derived attributes and composite indexes.
    *   Push down filter predicates to partitions.
    *   Parallelize query execution across partitions.



**Data Flow:**

1.  Queries arrive and are processed by the Query Planner.
2.  The Query Planner consults Partition Metadata and rewrites the query.
3.  The query is sent to the appropriate partitions.
4.  Partitions process the query and return the results.
5.  Results are aggregated and returned to the client.
6.  The Schema Profile Generator continuously analyzes query patterns and generates Schema Profiles.
7.  The Partition Adaptation Manager monitors performance and adapts partitions as needed.
8.  The Predictive Load Balancer dynamically redistributes partitions across compute nodes.
