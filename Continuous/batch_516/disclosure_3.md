## Dynamic Task Decomposition & Agent Specialization

**Concept:** Expand beyond assigning *tasks* to agents. Decompose tasks into micro-tasks based on agent *capabilities* and dynamically specialize agents based on performance feedback. This creates a self-optimizing system where agents aren't just completing tasks, but evolving their skillsets.

**Specifications:**

**1. Micro-Task Library:**

*   **Data Structure:** A hierarchical data structure representing tasks and their constituent micro-tasks. Each micro-task is defined by:
    *   `MicroTaskID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `RequiredCapabilities`:  List of required agent capabilities (e.g., “lifting < 5kg”, “navigation in aisle 3”, “barcode scanning”).
    *   `EstimatedDuration`: Predicted time to complete.
    *   `RewardValue`:  Points assigned to successful completion, weighted by difficulty and priority.
    *   `Dependencies`: List of `MicroTaskID`s that must be completed before this one.
*   **Population:** Populated with pre-defined task breakdowns *and* capable of dynamically generating new micro-tasks based on task complexity. This generation uses AI (see section 4).

**2. Agent Capability Profiles:**

*   **Data Structure:** Each agent (human or robotic) has a profile:
    *   `AgentID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `CurrentCapabilities`: List of capabilities the agent *currently* possesses, with associated proficiency levels (0-100).
    *   `LearningRate`:  Determines how quickly an agent improves a capability.
    *   `PreferredMicroTasks`: List of `MicroTaskID`s the agent consistently excels at.
    *   `CurrentTask`: The current `MicroTaskID` being executed.
    *   `Location`: Current physical location within the environment.

**3. Task Assignment Algorithm:**

*   **Process:**
    1.  Receive a high-level task.
    2.  Decompose the task into `MicroTaskID`s based on the `Micro-Task Library`.  AI-driven decomposition for novel tasks.
    3.  Iterate through available agents.
    4.  For each agent:
        *   Calculate a ‘Fitness Score’ based on:
            *   Capability Matching:  How well the agent’s `CurrentCapabilities` match the `RequiredCapabilities` of the available `MicroTaskID`s.
            *   Proximity:  Distance between the agent’s `Location` and the location of the `MicroTaskID`.
            *   Availability:  Whether the agent is currently assigned a task.
            *   Performance History:  Agent’s historical success rate for similar `MicroTaskID`s.
        *   Select the agent with the highest Fitness Score for the current `MicroTaskID`.
        *   Assign the `MicroTaskID` to the agent.
        *   Update agent’s `CurrentTask`.
        *   Send instructions to the agent.

**4. Dynamic Learning & Specialization (AI Integration):**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:**  Use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train agents.
    *   **Reward Function:** Based on successful completion of `MicroTaskID`s, speed, and efficiency.
    *   **State Space:** Agent’s `CurrentCapabilities`, `Location`, and the state of the environment.
    *   **Action Space:** Performing a `MicroTaskID`, moving to a new location, or requesting assistance.
*   **Capability Expansion:** Based on RL, automatically suggest training modules for agents to improve specific capabilities or acquire new ones.
*   **Micro-Task Generation:** If a new high-level task is received that doesn't have a pre-defined breakdown, use AI to generate a sequence of `MicroTaskID`s based on the task requirements. The AI will consider the capabilities of available agents to create a feasible decomposition.
*    **Adaptive Decomposition:** Continuously analyze the performance of the micro-task sequences and adjust the decomposition strategy to improve efficiency and optimize task completion times.

**5. System Architecture:**

*   **Central Server:**  Hosts the `Micro-Task Library`, agent profiles, task assignment algorithm, and AI models.
*   **Agent Clients:** Software running on each agent (robot or human mobile device) that receives instructions, reports progress, and provides real-time location data.
*   **Communication Network:**  Wireless network enabling communication between the central server and agent clients.
