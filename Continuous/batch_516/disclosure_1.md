## Dynamic Topic-Based Document Assembly

**Concept:** Automatically generate new documents by intelligently assembling segments from existing documents, guided by dynamically determined topic relevance. This goes beyond simple search and retrieval, aiming for coherent synthesis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Component: Topic Relevance Engine (TRE)**

*   **Input:** Collection of documents, a 'seed' topic (expressed as keywords or a topic model vector), a desired document length (word count or paragraph count).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Document Embedding:** Generate vector embeddings for each document in the collection using a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, Sentence Transformers).
    2.  **Seed Topic Vector:** Generate a vector embedding representing the 'seed' topic.
    3.  **Similarity Scoring:** Calculate cosine similarity between the seed topic vector and each document embedding.  Documents exceeding a threshold (adjustable parameter) are considered relevant.
    4.  **Segment Identification:** Divide relevant documents into segments (paragraphs, sections).  Embed each segment.
    5.  **Segment Scoring:** Calculate cosine similarity between the seed topic vector and each segment embedding.
    6.  **Diversity Penalty:** Implement a diversity penalty to discourage the selection of highly similar segments, promoting a broader coverage of subtopics.  (Calculate semantic distance between selected segments and apply a penalty.)
    7.  **Coherence Scoring:** Incorporate a coherence score based on transitioning words or phrases between segments to enhance readability. (Using a trained language model to predict the probability of the next sentence given the current one.)

**2. Document Assembly Module (DAM)**

*   **Input:**  A ranked list of segments (from TRE), desired document length.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Iterative Selection:**  Select segments one by one, starting with the highest-ranked segment.
    2.  **Length Check:** Verify that adding the next segment does not exceed the desired document length.
    3.  **Coherence Enforcement:**  Before adding a segment, assess its coherence with the previously assembled text using a language model. Reject segments with low coherence scores.
    4.  **Thesaurus Expansion:** If a coherent segment is not immediately available, expand the search by identifying segments containing synonyms or related terms using a thesaurus or word embedding similarity.
    5.  **Output:**  Assembled document comprising selected and ordered segments.

**3. User Interface (UI)**

*   **Input:** Seed topic keywords, desired document length, optional constraints (e.g., document source, reading level).
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  **Topic Refinement:** Allow users to refine the seed topic by adding or removing keywords.
    2.  **Document Preview:** Display a preview of the assembled document in real-time.
    3.  **Segment Editing:** Allow users to manually edit or remove segments from the assembled document.
    4.  **Style Control:** Provide options to control the writing style (e.g., formal, informal, technical) by adjusting parameters used in the coherence scoring and segment selection process.
    5.  **Output Formats:** Support various output formats (e.g., plain text, Markdown, Word document).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function assembleDocument(seedTopic, desiredLength):
  relevantDocuments = findRelevantDocuments(seedTopic)
  segments = extractSegments(relevantDocuments)
  rankedSegments = scoreSegments(segments, seedTopic)
  assembledText = ""
  for segment in rankedSegments:
    if length(assembledText) + length(segment) <= desiredLength:
      if isCoherent(assembledText, segment):
        assembledText += segment
      else:
        // Try to find alternative segment
    else:
        break

  return assembledText
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated content generation (blog posts, articles).
*   Report summarization.
*   Personalized learning materials.
*   Legal document drafting.
*   Rapid prototyping of research papers.
