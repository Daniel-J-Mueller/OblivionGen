## Autonomous Network Topology Discovery & Dynamic Optimization

**Concept:** Extend the time-series traffic analysis to *actively* discover and optimize network topology, beyond just port identification. Instead of simply identifying *which* port connects to *which* port, the system will learn the network's behavior and dynamically adjust routing to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Extends existing time-series data collection to include:
        *   Packet latency measurements (round-trip time).
        *   Packet loss rates.
        *   Bandwidth utilization per port and link.
        *   TCP/UDP flow statistics (source/destination IP, port, flags).
    *   Supports multiple data sources:  NetFlow/sFlow, SNMP, dedicated hardware probes.
    *   Data pre-processing:  Noise reduction, outlier detection, data normalization.

2.  **Network Model Builder:**
    *   Utilizes machine learning (Reinforcement Learning preferred) to build a dynamic model of the network topology and traffic patterns.
    *   Model representation: Graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to represent network devices, links, and traffic flows.
    *   Model training: Continuous learning, adapting to changing network conditions.
    *   Model validation:  Simulated traffic scenarios to test model accuracy and responsiveness.
    *   Anomaly detection: Identifies unusual traffic patterns or device behavior.

3.  **Dynamic Routing Engine:**
    *   Based on the network model, dynamically adjusts routing paths to optimize performance.
    *   Routing criteria:  Latency, throughput, packet loss, cost (if applicable).
    *   Routing algorithm:  Q-learning or other RL algorithm to learn optimal routing paths.
    *   Integration with existing routing protocols:  BGP, OSPF, IS-IS (via API).
    *   A/B testing:  Evaluates the performance of different routing configurations in a live environment.
    *   Rollback mechanism:  Automatically reverts to a previous configuration if performance degrades.

4.  **Traffic Steering Module:**
    *   Based on the network model, steers traffic flows to optimal paths.
    *   Support for multiple traffic steering techniques:  ECMP (Equal-Cost Multi-Path), LISP (Locator/ID Separation Protocol).
    *   Integration with SDN controllers:  OpenFlow, P4.
    *   Support for Quality of Service (QoS) policies.

5.  **System Architecture:**

    ```
    [Data Sources (NetFlow, SNMP, Probes)] --> [Data Collection Module] --> [Network Model Builder] --> [Dynamic Routing Engine] --> [Traffic Steering Module] --> [Network Devices]
    ```

6.  **Pseudocode (Dynamic Routing Engine - Q-Learning):**

    ```
    Initialize Q-table (state, action) with random values
    Learning rate = 0.1
    Discount factor = 0.9

    for each time step:
        Observe current network state (latency, throughput, packet loss)
        Select action (routing path) using epsilon-greedy policy
            With probability epsilon, choose a random action
            Otherwise, choose the action with the highest Q-value for the current state
        Execute action (update routing tables)
        Observe new network state (reward)
        Update Q-value:
            Q(state, action) = Q(state, action) + LearningRate * (Reward + DiscountFactor * Max(Q(next_state, all_actions)) - Q(state, action))
    ```

7.  **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   High-performance servers with multi-core CPUs and large memory.
    *   Network taps or SPAN ports for data collection.
    *   Dedicated network interfaces for communication with network devices.

8.  **Software Requirements:**
    *   Operating System: Linux (Ubuntu, CentOS).
    *   Programming Languages: Python, C++.
    *   Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch.
    *   Graph Database: Neo4j.
    *   Network Management Tools: SNMP, NetFlow collectors.
