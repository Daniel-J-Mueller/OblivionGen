**Modular Kinetic Light Diffuser Array**

**Concept:** Expand on the diffused light source within the collapsible enclosure by creating a dynamic, customizable light distribution system. Instead of a single, static diffuser, utilize an array of small, independently controllable light diffusers.

**Specs:**

*   **Diffuser Modules:** 
    *   Dimensions: 2cm x 2cm x 1cm (scalable)
    *   Material: Translucent polymer with embedded micro-LEDs and individual micro-controllers.
    *   Each module acts as a pixel â€“ capable of independent brightness and color control.
    *   Magnetic interlocking system for seamless array construction.
    *   Each module contains a small accelerometer/gyroscope to track its orientation.

*   **Enclosure Integration:**
    *   The interior walls of the collapsible enclosure will feature a grid pattern of embedded magnets. 
    *   The diffuser modules magnetically attach to this grid, allowing for flexible placement.
    *   Power and data are supplied via conductive tracks embedded within the enclosure walls, connecting to each module via magnetic contact points.

*   **Control System:**
    *   A central processing unit (integrated into the enclosure base) manages the array.
    *   User Interface: Bluetooth connectivity to a mobile app for customizable light patterns, color schemes, and brightness levels. 
    *   Sensor Integration: Option to integrate with external sensors (sound, motion, etc.) to trigger dynamic lighting effects.
    *   Preset Modes: Include pre-programmed lighting effects (e.g., pulsing, fading, color cycling).

*   **Kinetic Functionality:**
    *   Micro-servos within each module allow for slight tilting and rotation.
    *   Servos controlled by the central processing unit to create dynamic light patterns and effects.
    *   Potential for programmed sequences and interactive light displays.

*   **Power:**
    *   Rechargeable battery pack integrated into the enclosure base.
    *   Wireless charging capability.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Logic):**

```
// Initialize array dimensions (rows, cols)
rows = 10
cols = 10

// Initialize array of diffuser modules
diffuserArray[rows][cols]

// Function to set brightness of a single module
function setModuleBrightness(row, col, brightness) {
  diffuserArray[row][col].brightness = brightness
}

// Function to set color of a single module
function setModuleColor(row, col, red, green, blue) {
  diffuserArray[row][col].color = (red, green, blue)
}

// Function to create a simple fading effect
function fadingEffect() {
  for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
      brightness = sin(time + (i * 0.1) + (j * 0.1)) * 100 
      setModuleBrightness(i, j, brightness)
    }
  }
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  fadingEffect()
  delay(20)
}
```

This system moves beyond static diffusion to create a programmable, dynamic light source within the enclosure, transforming it into an interactive display or mood lighting system. It allows for entirely customizable light environments, offering a unique user experience.
