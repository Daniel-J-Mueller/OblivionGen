## Adaptive Request Mirroring with Synthetic Load

**Concept:** Expand the shadow request concept to *proactively* generate synthetic load mirroring production traffic, not just reacting to it. This allows for pre-emptive performance testing and capacity planning *before* a surge in real user traffic. It also introduces a level of controlled chaos for resilience testing.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Synthetic Load Generator (SLG)
*   **Integration:** Sits *upstream* of the live and shadow request processing pipeline.
*   **Function:**
    *   Captures a percentage of live production requests (configurable).
    *   Replays these requests as synthetic load, *in addition* to the standard shadow requests.
    *   Allows for amplification of synthetic load â€“ increasing the replay rate beyond the original request rate.
    *   Provides granular control over synthetic load characteristics:
        *   Geographic origin (simulating regional traffic patterns).
        *   User agent strings (mimicking different devices/browsers).
        *   Request parameters (introducing variations).
        *   Delay/jitter simulation (modeling network conditions).
*   **Allocation Rules Enhancement:** The existing dynamic allocation rules (based on system performance) now govern *both* shadow requests *and* synthetic load. A combined allocation percentage is calculated.
*   **Feedback Loop:** System performance metrics from both shadow requests *and* synthetic load are fed into the allocation rules engine.
*   **Resilience Mode:** A dedicated mode where the SLG intentionally introduces faults into synthetic requests (e.g., invalid parameters, network errors) to test the system's error handling capabilities.

**Pseudocode (Simplified SLG Logic):**

```
// Configuration parameters
CAPTURE_RATE = 0.1  // Capture 10% of live requests
AMPLIFICATION_FACTOR = 2 // Replay captured requests twice
ERROR_INJECTION_RATE = 0.05 // Introduce errors in 5% of synthetic requests

// Main loop
FOR each incoming live request:
    IF random() < CAPTURE_RATE:
        capture_request(request)
        store_request(request) // Store for replay

    process_request(request) // Process live request

// Replay loop (runs concurrently)
FOR each stored request:
    synthetic_request = clone(stored_request)

    // Apply amplification
    FOR i = 0 TO AMPLIFICATION_FACTOR:
        // Introduce errors (optional)
        IF random() < ERROR_INJECTION_RATE:
           synthetic_request = inject_error(synthetic_request)

        send_synthetic_request(synthetic_request)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The SLG requires sufficient network bandwidth to handle the amplified synthetic load.
*   Dedicated hardware may be necessary for high-volume applications.

**Benefits:**

*   **Proactive Performance Testing:** Identify potential bottlenecks *before* they impact real users.
*   **Improved Capacity Planning:** Accurately predict system requirements under load.
*   **Enhanced Resilience:** Test the system's ability to withstand failures.
*   **Realistic Load Simulation:** Generate load that closely mirrors production traffic.
*   **Controlled Chaos:** Introduce faults to validate error handling mechanisms.
