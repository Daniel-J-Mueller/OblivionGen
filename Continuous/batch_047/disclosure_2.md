## Adaptive Entropy Baseline & Behavioral Profiling

**Specification:** Implement a system that goes beyond static entropy thresholds, creating dynamic baselines for file entropy *and* behavioral profiles based on user activity and file access patterns.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of simply flagging changes in entropy, the system learns ‘normal’ entropy fluctuations for *each* file, user, and application combination.  It then correlates entropy shifts with *how* the file is being accessed (e.g., opened by a specific application, modified by a specific user, accessed after a specific event).  This allows for more accurate detection of malicious activity, reducing false positives and identifying zero-day threats.

**Components:**

1.  **Entropy Engine:** (Existing, but enhanced) Calculates entropy values for files. Optimized for speed and resource usage. Supports incremental entropy updates – only recalculate portions of the file that have changed.
2.  **Behavioral Logger:**  Monitors and records file access events:
    *   User ID
    *   Application used to access the file
    *   Type of access (read, write, execute, delete)
    *   Timestamp
    *   Network source (if applicable – e.g., file opened from a network share)
3.  **Baseline Generator:** Uses historical behavioral data and entropy values to create dynamic baselines.  This is the core innovation.
    *   For each file, generate a "normal" entropy range based on historical data.  Use statistical methods (e.g., moving averages, standard deviations, percentiles) to account for normal fluctuations.
    *   Generate behavioral profiles.  These profiles capture the typical applications, users, and access patterns associated with each file.
4.  **Anomaly Detector:**  Compares current entropy values and access patterns to the established baselines and profiles.
    *   Significant deviations from the baseline entropy *and* unexpected access patterns trigger an alert.
    *   Use a weighted scoring system.  Entropy deviations and behavioral anomalies contribute to an overall risk score.
5.  **Adaptive Learning Engine:** Continuously updates the baselines and profiles based on observed behavior.  This ensures the system adapts to changing user habits and application usage.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(file, current_entropy, user, application, access_type):

  baseline = get_baseline(file)  // Returns baseline entropy range
  profile = get_profile(file)   // Returns expected application/user access pattern

  entropy_score = calculate_entropy_score(current_entropy, baseline)
  behavior_score = calculate_behavior_score(user, application, access_type, profile)

  risk_score = (entropy_score * weight_entropy) + (behavior_score * weight_behavior)

  if risk_score > threshold:
    alert("Potential malware detected on file: " + file)
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `FileBaseline`:  Stores baseline entropy range (min, max, standard deviation).
*   `FileProfile`:  Stores allowed applications, users, and access types (as lists or sets).
*   `HistoricalData`:  Time-series data of entropy values and access events.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection algorithms, clustering) to improve the accuracy of the baseline generator and anomaly detector.
*   Consider using a distributed architecture to handle large volumes of data and scale the system to support multiple servers.
*   Develop a robust logging and auditing system to track all detected anomalies and provide forensic evidence.
