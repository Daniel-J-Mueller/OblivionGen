## Dynamic Scene Graph Reconstruction for Personalized Overlay Adaptation

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of identifying UI elements and prominence values to reconstruct a dynamic, 3D scene graph of the content stream. This scene graph isn't just for overlay *placement*, but for a degree of *manipulation* within the stream itself – subtle perspective shifts, localized distortions, or simulated depth-of-field effects – all tailored to user preference and prominence values.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scene Graph Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Content stream (video + UI element data - positions, sizes, content types, prominence values).
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize edge detection (as in the patent) to identify UI elements.
    *   Employ a depth estimation algorithm (e.g., monocular depth estimation from the video stream itself or utilizing data from the content streaming computer) to assign depth values to UI elements.  Initially, assume flat planes for UI elements.
    *   Construct a 3D scene graph. Nodes represent UI elements.  Edges represent spatial relationships (adjacency, containment).  Node attributes: position (X, Y, Z), size, prominence value, content type, material properties (opacity, reflectivity).
    *   Dynamic Updates:  Continuously update the scene graph based on changes in the content stream. Utilize a Kalman filter to smooth transitions and predict future positions of dynamic UI elements.
*   **Output:**  A dynamically updated 3D scene graph representing the content stream's UI.

**2. User Preference Engine:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data (clicks, gaze tracking, dwell time, expressed preferences).  Prominence values from the content stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   Build a user profile.  Map user interactions to UI element types and prominence values.  (e.g., User frequently interacts with high-prominence buttons).
    *   Learn user "attention weights" for different UI element types and prominence levels.
    *   Predict user focus areas within the current scene.
*   **Output:** Attention weights, focus areas, and predicted user gaze direction.

**3. Overlay Adaptation Module:**

*   **Input:** 3D Scene Graph, User Preference Data (Attention Weights, Focus Areas).
*   **Process:**
    *   Overlay Generation: Generate overlays based on the scene graph and user preference. Overlays aren’t simply flat rectangles. They conform to the 3D structure of the scene.
    *   Adaptive Distortion:  Subtly distort the background content stream based on user focus areas and overlay positioning. Example:  Slightly blur elements outside the user’s predicted gaze.  Slightly “push in” elements the user is likely to interact with.
    *   Simulated Depth of Field:  Apply depth-of-field effects to the content stream, focusing the user’s attention on the overlaid elements.
    *   Overlay Material Properties: Dynamically adjust overlay opacity, reflectivity, and texture based on prominence values and user preferences. High-prominence elements get more prominent overlays.
*   **Output:**  Adapted content stream with dynamically generated, 3D-aware overlays.

**Pseudocode (Overlay Adaptation Module):**

```
function AdaptStream(SceneGraph, UserData) {
  for each Element in SceneGraph {
    Prominence = Element.Prominence
    UserInterest = UserData.GetInterest(Element)

    //Calculate Overlay Position and Size
    OverlayPosition = CalculateOverlayPosition(Element.Position, UserInterest)
    OverlaySize = CalculateOverlaySize(Element.Size, UserInterest)

    // Apply Adaptive Distortion
    DistortionFactor = UserInterest * Prominence * 0.1 // Example factor
    ApplyDistortion(Element.Position, DistortionFactor)

    // Simulate Depth of Field
    DepthFactor = UserInterest * Prominence * 0.2
    ApplyDepthOfField(Element.Position, DepthFactor)

    // Adjust Overlay Material Properties
    Opacity = 0.5 + (UserInterest * Prominence * 0.5)
    Reflectivity = 0.2 + (UserInterest * Prominence * 0.3)
    SetOverlayMaterial(Opacity, Reflectivity)

    RenderOverlay(OverlayPosition, OverlaySize)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond 2D overlay placement to full 3D scene understanding and manipulation, creating a more immersive and personalized experience. Uses the prominence values to determine how to subtly alter the stream, not just where to place UI.  Adaptive distortion and simulated depth of field go beyond simply presenting information; they actively shape the user’s perception of the content.
