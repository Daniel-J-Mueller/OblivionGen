## Adaptive Embedding Granularity for Contextual Ambiguity Resolution

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of text segments used to generate embeddings, based on real-time assessment of contextual ambiguity. The existing system appears to operate on fairly rigid text segmentations. This builds on that, but allows the segmentation to *change* during operation.

**II. Components:**

*   **Ambiguity Detection Module (ADM):** Analyzes the input text stream for potential ambiguities. This could be achieved via:
    *   **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging & Dependency Parsing:** Identifies grammatical structures prone to multiple interpretations (e.g., prepositional phrase attachment).
    *   **Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD):** Utilizes knowledge bases (WordNet, BabelNet) to identify words with multiple meanings and their contextual likelihood.
    *   **Contextual Entropy Calculation:** Quantifies the uncertainty in the interpretation of a text segment. Higher entropy indicates greater ambiguity.
*   **Granularity Controller (GC):**  Based on the ADMâ€™s output, dynamically adjusts the length of text segments fed to the ML transformer for embedding generation.
    *   **Fine-Grained Mode:**  For highly ambiguous segments, the GC reduces segment length to focus on key disambiguating words or phrases (e.g., single words, short phrases).
    *   **Coarse-Grained Mode:** For clear segments, the GC uses longer segments to capture broader context.
    *   **Adaptive Segmentation Algorithm:** A heuristic algorithm determining the optimal segment length based on ambiguity score, sentence structure, and previous segment lengths.
*   **Embedding Fusion Module (EFM):**  Combines embeddings generated from different granularity segments.  Uses attention mechanisms to prioritize more informative embeddings (e.g., embeddings from fine-grained segments in ambiguous contexts).
*   **Multi-Task Layer (MTL) Integration:** The MTL receives the fused embeddings as input, leveraging the refined contextual information for improved task performance.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessText(text):
  segments = SplitTextIntoInitialSegments(text)
  FOR each segment IN segments:
    ambiguity_score = ADM.CalculateAmbiguityScore(segment)
    optimal_length = GC.DetermineOptimalSegmentLength(ambiguity_score, segment)
    refined_segment = GC.RefineSegment(segment, optimal_length)
    embedding = ML_Transformer.GenerateEmbedding(refined_segment)
    fused_embeddings = EFM.FuseEmbeddings(embedding, existing_fused_embeddings)
  return fused_embeddings
```

**IV. Data Structures:**

*   **AmbiguityScore:**  Floating-point value representing the level of ambiguity in a text segment.
*   **Segment:** String representing a contiguous sequence of words.
*   **FusedEmbedding:** Vector representing the combined contextual information from multiple segments.
*   **SegmentMetadata:** Data structure storing information about a segment, including:
    *   Segment text
    *   Ambiguity score
    *   Original segment length
    *   Refined segment length

**V. Training Procedure:**

*   Augment training data with synthetically generated ambiguous examples.
*   Train the system end-to-end, optimizing for both primary task performance and ambiguity resolution accuracy.
*   Use reinforcement learning to fine-tune the adaptive segmentation algorithm based on reward signals related to task performance and ambiguity reduction.
