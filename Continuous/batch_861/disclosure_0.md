## Dynamic Column Reflow with Semantic Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the column-viewing mode to intelligently reflow text *within* a selected column, not just display it, based on semantic understanding of the text. This goes beyond simple line breaks and aims for a more natural reading experience, particularly for complex documents like research papers or books.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Reflow Engine (integrated within the existing Zoom Module)
*   **Input:** Selected Column (text content), Dominant Color Value (for stylistic consistency), Character Recognition Output (text & semantic tags - sentence boundaries, paragraph breaks, headings, lists, etc.), User Preference (Reflow Aggressiveness – Low/Medium/High)
*   **Output:** Reflowed Text (formatted for optimal readability within the column width)

**Functionality:**

1.  **Semantic Segmentation:** Utilize the Character Recognition output to identify semantic units (sentences, phrases, paragraphs, headings, lists, tables, images). Assign a “reflow cost” to each unit based on its type and content. (e.g., breaking a sentence has a high cost; splitting a list item has a moderate cost; splitting a paragraph has a low cost).
2.  **Dynamic Reflow Algorithm:**
    *   Initialize a ‘reflow score’ for the column (starting at zero).
    *   Iterate through the semantic units in the column.
    *   For each unit:
        *   Calculate how much space the unit occupies if displayed without reflowing.
        *   If the unit exceeds the column width:
            *   Attempt to split the unit at a natural break point (punctuation, space between words) minimizing the reflow cost.
            *   If no natural break point exists, use a less optimal break point, increasing the reflow score.
        *   If the unit fits within the column width, assess the remaining space.
        *   Prioritize fitting entire semantic units within the column.
        *   Apply User Preference (Reflow Aggressiveness) to adjust the balance between fitting more content vs. maintaining semantic integrity. (Low = prioritize semantic integrity; High = prioritize fitting more content).
3.  **Stylistic Consistency:** Maintain the original font style, size, and color of the text. Ensure visual consistency with the surrounding columns.
4.  **Interactive Reflow Adjustment:** Allow the user to manually adjust the reflow by tapping on a semantic unit to force it to stay together or break at a specific point.
5.  **Non-Text Object Handling:** Maintain placement of images and tables within the reflowed column. Adjust the reflowed text around these objects as needed.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ReflowColumn(columnText, dominantColor, crOutput, userPreference)

  semanticUnits = Split(columnText, crOutput) // Split text into semantic units

  reflowScore = 0

  FOR EACH unit IN semanticUnits:
    width = CalculateWidth(unit, dominantColor)

    IF width > columnWidth:
      breakPoint = FindBestBreakPoint(unit) // minimize reflow cost
      IF breakPoint != null:
        splitUnit(unit, breakPoint)
        reflowScore += breakPoint.cost
      ELSE:
        ForceBreak(unit) //High reflow cost
        reflowScore += 100
    ENDIF

    //Adjust remaining space & fit entire units if possible
    //Apply User Preference to balance readability & content density

  ENDFOR
  RETURN reflowedText
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Adaptive Reflow:** Adjust the reflow algorithm based on the complexity of the text and the reading speed of the user (measured through eye-tracking or user input).
*   **Cross-Column Reflow:** Allow reflowing of text *between* columns to create a more fluid reading experience.
*   **Reflow History:** Allow the user to revert to previous reflow states.
