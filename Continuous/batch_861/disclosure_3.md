## Adaptive Behavioral Profiles with Contextual Drift

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of tracking user paths and identifying unexpected behavior, but extends it with *dynamic* behavioral profiles that account for contextual drift and proactively adapt to evolving user patterns. Unlike static intent groupings, this system establishes a continuously learning model of ‘normal’ behavior, factoring in external data streams to anticipate and normalize shifts in user activity.

**II. Core Components:**

1.  **Contextual Data Ingestion:**
    *   Data Sources: Integrate data feeds beyond website activity, including:
        *   Geolocation (IP-based or consented user location).
        *   Time of Day/Week/Year.
        *   Device Type/Operating System.
        *   Referral Source (e.g., search engine, social media, email campaign).
        *   External Event Data: News events, promotional campaigns, seasonal trends (e.g., Black Friday).
    *   Data Preprocessing: Normalize and timestamp all ingested data.

2.  **Dynamic Behavioral Profile (DBP) Generation:**
    *   Model: Employ a Bayesian Network or Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to represent user behavior.  The network nodes represent website actions (page visits, clicks, purchases, etc.) and contextual variables.  Edges represent probabilistic relationships between these variables.
    *   Learning:  Continuously update the Bayesian Network/HMM based on observed user paths.  Employ online learning algorithms (e.g., Expectation-Maximization) to adapt to changing patterns.  The network learns probabilities like: “Given it’s Black Friday and the user is on a mobile device, what is the probability they will visit the ‘Deals’ page?”
    *   Profile Granularity:  Create DBPs at multiple levels:
        *   Individual User Profiles: Personalized behavioral models.
        *   Cohort Profiles: Profiles for groups of users with similar characteristics (e.g., new customers, returning customers, users from specific geographic regions).
        *   Global Profile: A baseline model representing general website usage patterns.

3.  **Anomaly Detection & Scoring:**

    *   Deviation Calculation:  For each user action, calculate the probability of that action occurring given the user's DBP *and* the current context.
    *   Anomaly Score:  Calculate an anomaly score based on the deviation from expected behavior. This could be based on:
        *   Negative Log Likelihood: The lower the probability, the higher the score.
        *   Mahalanobis Distance: Measures the distance from the expected behavior, considering the covariance between variables.
    *   Contextual Thresholding:  Adjust anomaly thresholds based on the context. For example, a higher threshold might be used during promotional events when unusual behavior is more common.

4.  **Adaptive Remediation & Prevention:**

    *   Dynamic Action Selection: Instead of pre-defined actions, use a reinforcement learning model to determine the optimal response to anomalous behavior. The model learns which actions (e.g., fraud risk increase, account lock, two-factor authentication request) are most effective in preventing negative outcomes.
    *   Personalized Mitigation: Tailor mitigation strategies to the specific user and context. For example, a returning customer with a minor anomaly might receive a helpful message, while a new user with a significant anomaly might have their account temporarily suspended.
    *   Proactive Assistance:  Based on predicted user intent, offer proactive assistance. For example, if a user is struggling to complete a purchase, offer live chat support.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
//Data Ingestion
contextData = ingestData(geoLocation, timeOfDay, deviceType, referralSource, externalEvents)

//DBP Generation
userProfile = createDynamicBayesianNetwork(historicalPaths, contextData)

//Anomaly Detection
anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(currentAction, userProfile, contextData)

//Adaptive Remediation
action = reinforcementLearningModel.selectAction(anomalyScore, userProfile, contextData)
executeAction(action)
```

**IV. Novelty:**

This system differs from the referenced patent by moving beyond static intent groupings to a continuously learning model that accounts for contextual drift and proactively adapts to evolving user patterns. The integration of external data streams, reinforcement learning-based remediation, and personalized mitigation strategies provide a more robust and flexible approach to detecting and preventing unexpected behavior. It is more of a predictive system than a reactive one.
