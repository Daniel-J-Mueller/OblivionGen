## Dynamic Haptic Canvas

**Concept:** Extend the touch input rendering system to incorporate localized haptic feedback directly tied to the rendered feature, creating a dynamic, textured "canvas" feel.  Instead of solely visual rendering, the system will modulate micro-actuators embedded within or attached to the display surface to simulate texture, resistance, or other tactile sensations corresponding to the rendered line or feature.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Display: High-resolution display capable of integration with a micro-actuator array.  Could be electrostatic, piezoelectric, or shape memory alloy based for rapid response.  Minimum actuator density: 100 actuators per square inch.
    *   Actuator Control Unit (ACU): Dedicated processing unit to manage and synchronize actuator signals.  Must support individual actuator control and waveform generation.  Communication with the OS Kernel via a dedicated high-speed interface (e.g., PCIe).
    *   Force Sensor Array: Integrated within the display to measure applied force and provide feedback to the ACU for dynamic adjustment of haptic effects.
*   **Software (OS Kernel Modules):**
    *   Haptic Effect Manager:  Module responsible for defining and storing haptic effect profiles.  Profiles will map rendered feature characteristics (line thickness, color, “pen” type, etc.) to specific actuator patterns.
    *   Haptic Sync Module:  Critical for synchronizing haptic feedback with visual rendering. This module intercepts rendering commands from the rendering/syncing module described in the patent and translates them into actuator control signals.
    *   Force Feedback Loop:  Real-time feedback loop that monitors force applied by the user (via the force sensor array) and adjusts the haptic effect accordingly.  This creates a more realistic and responsive tactile experience.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `HapticProfile`:
        *   `profileID`: Unique identifier for the profile.
        *   `featureCharacteristics`:  Mapping of visual feature characteristics (e.g., line thickness, color, pen type) to actuator patterns.  This could be a lookup table or a more complex function.
        *   `actuatorPattern`:  Array of actuator activation levels and timing data.
        *   `forceScale`: Scale factor for adjusting the strength of the haptic effect based on user input.
    *   `ActuatorControlSignal`:
        *   `actuatorID`:  Identifier of the specific actuator to control.
        *   `activationLevel`:  Level of activation for the actuator (0-100%).
        *   `duration`:  Duration of the activation pulse (in milliseconds).
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Sync Module):**

```
function SyncHapticFeedback(renderingData, displayCoordinates):
    // Retrieve HapticProfile based on renderingData.featureCharacteristics
    hapticProfile = GetHapticProfile(renderingData.featureCharacteristics)

    // Calculate actuator activation levels based on displayCoordinates and hapticProfile
    actuatorSignals = CalculateActuatorSignals(displayCoordinates, hapticProfile)

    // Send actuatorSignals to ACU
    SendActuatorSignals(actuatorSignals)

    // Monitor force sensor array
    forceData = ReadForceSensorData()

    // Adjust haptic effect based on forceData
    AdjustHapticEffect(forceData)
```

**Novelty:** This extends beyond purely visual rendering to add a tactile dimension, providing a more immersive and intuitive user experience.  The dynamic adjustment of haptic effects based on user input creates a truly interactive "canvas." It shifts the focus from *displaying* a feature to *simulating* a physical interaction with that feature.
