## Adaptive Haptic Feedback E-Reader

**Concept:** An e-reader with a dynamic, localized haptic feedback system that simulates the texture and resistance of turning physical pages, *and* integrates with on-screen content to provide tactile reinforcement of information.

**Specs:**

*   **Display:** Flexible OLED display, 7-9 inches diagonal. Must support variable refresh rates (1-240Hz) and high-resolution (300+ PPI).
*   **Haptic Layer:**  An array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or microfluidic preferred) layered *behind* the OLED display. Resolution: at least 100 actuators per square inch. Each actuator must be individually addressable with millisecond precision.
*   **Page Turn Simulation:** 
    *   Software to analyze page turn animations and generate corresponding haptic patterns.
    *   Pattern: Simulate the ‘tear’ of a page with a localized, brief, increasing-then-decreasing vibration across a small area of the screen mirroring the visual tearing point. Follow with a subtle ‘ripple’ effect spreading from the tear. Simulate paper thickness by altering the actuator strength.
    *   Variable resistance simulation – the system should be capable of varying the 'drag' felt when "swiping" a page.
*   **Content-Aware Haptics:**
    *   Software API to allow developers to integrate haptic feedback into their applications.
    *   Examples:
        *   Maps:  Raised "bumps" representing terrain features.
        *   Diagrams: Tactile outlines of shapes and lines.
        *   Code: Distinct vibrations for different syntax elements.
        *   Math Equations: Tactile representation of operators, variables, and functions.
        *   Images: Ability to 'trace' image outlines with haptic feedback, providing tactile exploration.
*   **Materials:** Lightweight, durable frame constructed from magnesium alloy or carbon fiber. Soft-touch, non-slip coating on exterior surfaces.
*   **Power:** High-density battery offering at least 24 hours of continuous reading with haptics enabled. Wireless charging support.
*   **Software:** Open-source SDK for developers to create custom haptic experiences. Machine learning component to personalize haptic feedback based on user reading habits and preferences.

**Pseudocode (Content-Aware Haptics - Map Example):**

```
function generate_map_haptics(map_data):
  for each terrain_feature in map_data:
    if terrain_feature.type == "mountain":
      activate_haptic_array(terrain_feature.coordinates, intensity=8, shape="cone")
    elif terrain_feature.type == "river":
      activate_haptic_array(terrain_feature.coordinates, intensity=4, shape="wave")
    elif terrain_feature.type == "forest":
      activate_haptic_array(terrain_feature.coordinates, intensity=2, shape="random_pulse")
    else:
      # default haptic for other terrain types
      activate_haptic_array(terrain_feature.coordinates, intensity=1, shape="dot")

function activate_haptic_array(coordinates, intensity, shape):
  # Convert coordinates to actuator addresses
  actuator_addresses = map_coordinates_to_actuators(coordinates)

  for address in actuator_addresses:
    set_actuator_intensity(address, intensity)
    set_actuator_shape(address, shape)

  delay(50ms) # Brief delay for tactile sensation
