## Dynamic Resource Delegation via Temporal Access Keys

**Concept:** Extend the resource container concept to incorporate time-decaying access keys generated *within* the container’s policy engine, allowing for granular, automatically expiring access to resources, even *across* organizational boundaries. This moves beyond simple membership/authorization checks to a dynamic, time-limited delegation system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Policy Engine Enhancement:**

*   **Temporal Key Generation:** The container’s associated policy engine must be capable of generating unique, cryptographically secure access keys with defined lifespans (e.g., 5 minutes, 1 hour, until a specific date/time).
*   **Key Binding:**  Keys are bound to specific resources *within* the container and to the user requesting access.  This prevents key reuse across different resources or by unauthorized parties.
*   **Revocation Mechanism:** The policy engine must provide a mechanism to *immediately* revoke keys, independent of their expiration time, in case of security breaches or access changes.  Revocation events are logged.

**2. Resource Access Interception:**

*   **Interception Point:** All resource access attempts *must* pass through an interception point (e.g., a proxy, API gateway) integrated with the container’s policy engine.
*   **Key Validation:** The interception point validates the presented access key against the policy engine. Validation checks include:
    *   Key validity (not expired, not revoked).
    *   Key association with the requesting user.
    *   Key authorization for the requested resource.

**3. Access Key Distribution:**

*   **Secure Channel:** Access keys *must* be distributed via a secure channel (e.g., TLS-encrypted communication, authenticated API endpoint).
*   **Temporary Credentials:** Keys should be treated as temporary credentials, not long-term secrets. Clients should not store keys persistently.
*   **Automated Distribution:** The system should automate the access key distribution process as much as possible.  For example, when a user requests access to a resource, the system automatically generates a key, distributes it to the user, and logs the event.

**4. Client-Side Integration:**

*   **Key Handling Library:** Provide a client-side library for securely obtaining and using access keys.  This library should handle:
    *   Secure key storage (in memory only).
    *   Key rotation (obtaining new keys before old ones expire).
    *   Error handling (e.g., handling expired or invalid keys).

**Pseudocode (Simplified Access Flow):**

```
// User requests access to Resource X within Container Y
function requestResourceAccess(user, resource, container):
  // 1. Obtain policy engine for container
  policyEngine = getPolicyEngine(container)

  // 2. Generate temporal access key
  accessKey = policyEngine.generateAccessKey(user, resource, expirationTime)

  // 3. Securely distribute access key to user
  distributeAccessKey(user, accessKey)

  // 4. User attempts to access resource
  // 5. Interception point receives request
  // 6. Interception point validates access key with policy engine
  if (policyEngine.isValidAccessKey(accessKey, user, resource)):
    // Grant access
    allowAccess(user, resource)
  else:
    // Deny access
    denyAccess(user, resource)
```

**Novelty:** This approach enhances the original patent by introducing *time-based access control* directly managed within the resource container’s policy engine.  This moves beyond static membership checks and allows for granular, automatically expiring access, particularly useful in multi-organization scenarios where trust relationships are complex and transient.  The automated key generation and distribution simplify access management and improve security. The emphasis is on *dynamic* delegation of access, rather than static permissions.
