## Adaptive Register Mapping & Dynamic Bus Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the broadcast read capability to dynamically remap register addresses during runtime and allocate bus bandwidth based on read request frequency. This moves beyond static address association to enable highly flexible and efficient data access, particularly in heterogeneous systems.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Register Remapping Table (RRT):** A dedicated hardware table within the bus controller.  Each entry maps a logical register address (used in broadcast requests) to a physical register address within a logic module.  The RRT is writable via a dedicated control interface.
    *   **Bus Allocation Monitor (BAM):** Hardware monitor tracks the frequency of broadcast read requests targeting each logic module.
    *   **Dynamic Bus Arbiter (DBA):** Hardware arbiter dynamically allocates bus bandwidth to logic modules based on BAM data.  Higher frequency targets receive priority.
    *   **Logic Module Interface:**  Logic modules receive a ‘remap enable’ signal and a current RRT entry alongside the broadcast read request. They use this to translate the logical address to the physical address.

*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **RRT Management API:**  Software API to read, write, and manage entries in the RRT.  Allows runtime reconfiguration of register mappings.
    *   **BAM Configuration:**  Software/firmware to configure the BAM – setting sampling rates, thresholds for bus allocation, and the granularity of tracking.
    *   **Bus Allocation Policies:** Configurable policies to govern how bus bandwidth is allocated based on BAM data (e.g., round-robin, priority-based).

**Operation:**

1.  **Initialization:** The RRT is initialized with a default mapping of logical addresses to physical addresses. Bus allocation policies are configured.
2.  **Broadcast Read Request:** The bus controller receives a broadcast read request containing a logical address.
3.  **RRT Lookup:**  The bus controller uses the logical address to lookup the corresponding physical address in the RRT.
4.  **Request Propagation:** The bus controller transmits the broadcast read request *along with the current RRT entry* to all logic modules.
5.  **Address Translation:** Each logic module receives the request and uses the RRT entry to translate the logical address to the physical address within itself.
6.  **Data Read & Response:** Logic modules read data from the translated physical address and transmit the value back through the bus.
7.  **Bus Allocation:** The BAM monitors read request frequency to each logic module. The DBA adjusts bus bandwidth allocation dynamically, prioritizing modules with more frequent requests.
8.  **Dynamic Remapping:** Software can modify the RRT at runtime, changing the mapping of logical addresses. This allows for reconfiguration of the system without requiring hardware reset.

**Pseudocode (Bus Controller - Request Propagation):**

```
function propagateBroadcastRequest(logicalAddress, registerAddress) {
  rrtEntry = lookupRRTEntry(logicalAddress);
  broadcastRequest = createBroadcastRequest(logicalAddress, registerAddress, rrtEntry);
  transmitBroadcastRequest(broadcastRequest);
}

function lookupRRTEntry(logicalAddress) {
  // Hardware lookup in RRT table
  return rrtEntry;
}

function createBroadcastRequest(logicalAddress, registerAddress, rrtEntry) {
  request = {
    logicalAddress: logicalAddress,
    registerAddress: registerAddress,
    rrtEntry: rrtEntry
  }
  return request;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Flexibility:** Allows for runtime reconfiguration of register mappings, enabling dynamic system adaptation.
*   **Efficiency:** Dynamic bus allocation optimizes bandwidth utilization by prioritizing frequently accessed modules.
*   **Scalability:**  Supports a large number of logic modules and registers.
*   **Reduced Latency:** Optimized bandwidth allocation minimizes delays in accessing data.
