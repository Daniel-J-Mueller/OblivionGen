## Adaptive Sentiment-Driven Theme Refinement

**Concept:** Extend theme detection beyond static key phrase clustering to incorporate real-time sentiment analysis *within* the contact data, dynamically refining theme boundaries and providing nuanced thematic understanding.  Instead of just identifying *what* is being discussed, we pinpoint *how* it’s being discussed, leading to more actionable insights.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sentiment Pipeline Integration:**  Integrate a sentiment analysis module directly into the turn processing stage. This module should output a sentiment score (e.g., -1 to 1) *for each turn*. This module should be swappable – supporting multiple sentiment analysis engines.
2.  **Weighted Key Phrase Extraction:** Modify key phrase extraction to incorporate sentiment scores.  A turn’s contribution to a key phrase’s weight is *multiplied* by its sentiment score.  Positive sentiment amplifies a phrase’s importance; negative sentiment diminishes it.
3.  **Dynamic Cluster Boundary Adjustment:** Implement an algorithm to shift cluster boundaries based on the weighted sentiment distribution *within* each cluster.  If a cluster shows consistently negative sentiment around a specific topic, the boundary is adjusted to exclude outlier turns with positive sentiment, sharpening the thematic focus.
4.  **Sentiment-Driven Theme Labeling:**  Instead of relying solely on key phrase frequency for theme labeling, incorporate the average sentiment score *of the cluster* into the label itself.  For example, instead of just “Billing Issues,” a theme might be labeled “Billing Issues (High Frustration).”
5.  **Real-time Feedback Loop:** If integrated into a live contact center environment, the system can provide real-time feedback to agents – highlighting dominant themes *and* associated customer sentiment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input:  Transcript data (list of turns)

FOR EACH turn IN transcript:
    sentiment_score = SentimentAnalysis(turn) // External module
    weighted_score = turn.key_phrase_weight * sentiment_score
    turn.weighted_score = weighted_score

// Perform initial key phrase extraction and clustering (as in original patent)

FOR EACH cluster IN clusters:
    average_sentiment = CalculateAverage(cluster.turns.sentiment_score)
    cluster.label = GenerateLabel(cluster.key_phrases, average_sentiment) // Incorporate sentiment into label

    // Dynamic Boundary Adjustment
    FOR EACH turn IN cluster.turns:
        IF turn.sentiment_score is significantly different from cluster.average_sentiment:
            MoveTurnToNearestCluster(turn) // Based on sentiment and key phrase similarity

OUTPUT:  Clusters with refined boundaries, sentiment-enriched labels, and individual turn sentiment scores.
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-performance compute infrastructure for real-time sentiment analysis.
*   Modular design allowing for easy integration of different sentiment analysis engines.
*   Scalable data storage for storing transcript data, sentiment scores, and cluster information.
*   API endpoint for accessing sentiment-enriched theme data.
