## Dynamic Kernel Shadowing with Hardware-Assisted Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the kernel tampering detection by creating a ‘shadow’ copy of critical kernel data structures *within* the CPU's memory protection domains (e.g., using Intel SGX or AMD SEV). This shadow copy is continuously updated from the main kernel memory, but any modification to the main kernel data structures *must* pass through a hardware-verified attestation process *before* being reflected in the shadow copy.  This provides a significantly stronger guarantee of integrity than simply scanning memory.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Data Structure Manager (SDSM):** A kernel module responsible for managing the shadow copies of critical data structures.

*   **Configuration:**  Admin defines which kernel data structures are to be shadowed via a configuration file or kernel parameter.
*   **Initial Shadow Creation:** Upon system boot, SDSM allocates protected enclaves (SGX or SEV) and creates initial shadow copies of the configured data structures.
*   **Data Synchronization:**  
    *   Establish a secure, unidirectional channel from the main kernel memory to the enclave.
    *   Periodically (configurable) copy data from main kernel structures to their enclave counterparts. This copy must be verified.
*   **Attestation Workflow:**
    *   Any kernel module attempting to *modify* a shadowed data structure must first request an attestation token from SDSM.
    *   SDSM verifies the requesting module's signature and integrity.
    *   If verified, SDSM generates a cryptographic challenge.
    *   The requesting module modifies its local copy of the data structure.
    *   The module signs the modified data with its private key and sends it, along with the challenge response, to SDSM.
    *   SDSM verifies the signature and the challenge response.
    *   If valid, SDSM updates the shadow copy within the enclave with the verified modification.
    *   If invalid, the modification is rejected, and an alert is triggered.
*   **Tamper Detection:** Compare the shadow copy in the enclave to the main kernel memory. Any discrepancy indicates tampering.

**2. Hardware Requirements:**

*   CPU with support for secure enclaves (Intel SGX or AMD SEV).
*   Sufficient enclave memory to hold shadow copies of configured data structures.

**3. Software Components:**

*   **SDSM Kernel Module:** Manages shadow copies, attestation, and tamper detection.
*   **Attestation Service:**  Provides attestation tokens and verifies module signatures.
*   **Secure Enclave SDK:**  Enables communication with and operation within the secure enclave.

**4. Pseudocode (SDSM Attestation Workflow):**

```
function modify_shadowed_data(module_id, data_structure_address, modification_data):
  // Request attestation token
  token = request_attestation_token(module_id)

  if token == INVALID:
    log_error("Attestation failed")
    return FAILURE

  // Apply modification to local copy
  local_copy = get_local_copy(data_structure_address)
  apply_modification(local_copy, modification_data)

  // Sign modified data
  signature = sign_data(local_copy, module_private_key)

  // Send signed data and challenge response to SDSM
  response = send_to_sdsm(signature, challenge_response)

  if response == VALID:
    update_shadow_copy(shadow_copy, local_copy)
    return SUCCESS
  else:
    log_error("Modification rejected by SDSM")
    return FAILURE
```

**5. Extensions:**

*   **Dynamic Shadowing:** Allow administrators to add or remove data structures from the shadow list *at runtime*.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the overhead of data synchronization.
*   **Integration with System Auditing:**  Log all attestation requests and modifications for forensic analysis.
*   **Remote Attestation:**  Allow a remote party to verify the integrity of the kernel by attesting to the SDSM.
