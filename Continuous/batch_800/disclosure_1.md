## Dynamic Load Balancer 'Shadowing' for Canary Deployments

**Specification:** Implement a system enabling 'shadow' load balancer configurations to run alongside production load balancers, receiving a mirrored subset of live traffic without impacting user experience. This allows for real-world testing of new configurations, code deployments, or infrastructure changes *before* full rollout.

**Components:**

*   **Traffic Mirroring Module:**  Intercepts a configurable percentage (0-100%) of incoming requests. This module resides *before* the primary load balancer.  Mirroring can be based on various criteria â€“ geographic location, user agent, cookie values, request headers (X-Shadow-Test: true), or even randomly.
*   **Shadow Load Balancer:**  A fully functional load balancer, identical in configuration to production, but directs traffic to a designated 'shadow' pool of compute instances. These instances may run the new code, utilize different instance types, or represent the target configuration.
*   **Request/Response Interception & Modification:**  A component allowing for modification of intercepted requests *before* they hit the shadow pool, and modification of responses *before* they are discarded (responses are *not* sent to the end user). This enables testing of different input parameters or simulating varying network conditions.
*   **Performance & Error Monitoring:**  Real-time metrics (latency, error rates, CPU/memory usage) collected from both production and shadow pools.  Automated alerts trigger if shadow pool performance deviates significantly from production.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**  Automated process to immediately disable shadowing and revert to the previous configuration if critical errors are detected in the shadow pool.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Incoming Request
request = receiveRequest()

// Check if shadowing is enabled
if (shadowingEnabled) {

    // Determine if request should be mirrored based on criteria
    if (shouldMirrorRequest(request)) {

        // Duplicate request
        mirroredRequest = cloneRequest(request)

        // Send mirrored request to Shadow Load Balancer
        sendRequestToShadowBalancer(mirroredRequest)

        // Process original request as normal
        processRequest(request)
    } else {
        processRequest(request)
    }

} else {
    processRequest(request)
}

//Shadow Load Balancer receives request
shadowBalancer = receiveShadowRequest(request)
shadowBalancer.routeToShadowPool(request)

//Shadow Pool Processes Request
shadowPool = receiveRequest(request)
shadowPool.processRequest(request)
//discard response.
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ShadowingConfig`: { `enabled`: boolean, `mirrorPercentage`: float, `mirrorCriteria`: string (e.g., "geo:US", "header:X-Shadow-Test"), `shadowPoolArn`: string }
*   `MirrorCriteria`: Enum (GEO, HEADER, RANDOM)

**Use Cases:**

*   **Canary Deployments:** Gradually shift traffic to the shadow pool, monitoring performance before full rollout.
*   **Performance Testing:** Subject the shadow pool to load tests without impacting production users.
*   **Configuration Validation:** Test new load balancer configurations (SSL certificates, health checks) in a live environment.
*   **Security Testing:** Evaluate the security posture of the shadow pool under realistic traffic conditions.
*   **A/B Testing:** Route different user segments to shadow pools running different versions of an application.
