## Actor-Based Predictive Load Balancing with Dynamic Core Affinity

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This system extends the actor/thread dispatching concept by introducing predictive load balancing driven by machine learning and dynamic core affinity. The core idea is to not only react to current load but *anticipate* future load based on actor message patterns and dynamically adjust actor-to-core assignments for optimized performance.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Load Prediction Module:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Time Series Forecasting) trained on historical actor message rates, message sizes, and processing times. This module predicts the computational load each actor will require over a short time horizon (e.g., 100ms - 1 second). This prediction is expressed as a predicted CPU usage percentage.

2.  **Core Affinity Manager:** Responsible for assigning and reassigning actors to physical CPU cores. It receives load predictions from the Load Prediction Module and monitors real-time core utilization.

3.  **Actor Metadata Store:**  A data structure holding metadata about each actor, including:
    *   Actor ID
    *   Current Assigned Core
    *   Historical Message Rate
    *   Predicted Load (from Load Prediction Module)
    *   Message Queue Length

4. **Dispatching Component:** (Extends existing patent functionality) - Dispatches messages based on actor assignment *and* predicted load.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initialization:** Actors are initially assigned to cores using a round-robin or least-loaded approach.  The Load Prediction Module begins collecting historical data.

2.  **Load Prediction:** Every *N* milliseconds (configurable), the Load Prediction Module generates load predictions for each actor.

3.  **Core Affinity Adjustment:**
    *   The Core Affinity Manager compares the predicted load for each actor with the current utilization of the actor’s assigned core.
    *   If the predicted load exceeds a threshold (configurable) *and* the current core is approaching full utilization, the manager identifies a less loaded core.
    *   The manager initiates a “warm migration” of the actor to the new core. This involves a controlled transfer of the actor's state and message queue, minimizing disruption.
    *   The "warm migration" allows for continued message processing during transfer.
    *   The migration process uses the existing dispatching component, ensuring seamless transition.

4. **Dispatching Logic:**
   * The dispatching component checks whether an actor is assigned to a core.
   * If assigned, the message is sent to the core.
   * If not assigned, the dispatching component chooses an available core based on load. 
   * When a core is reassigned, the dispatching component handles the migration of messages.

**IV. Pseudocode (Core Affinity Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function adjustCoreAffinity(actor, predictedLoad, currentCoreUtilization):
    if predictedLoad > loadThreshold AND currentCoreUtilization > utilizationThreshold:
        availableCores = getAvailableCores()
        leastLoadedCore = findLeastLoadedCore(availableCores)

        if leastLoadedCore != currentCore:
            // Initiate warm migration
            transferActorState(actor, currentCore, leastLoadedCore)
            transferMessageQueue(actor, currentCore, leastLoadedCore)
            assignActorToCore(actor, leastLoadedCore)
            logMigrationEvent(actor, currentCore, leastLoadedCore)
```

**V.  Configuration Parameters:**

*   `loadThreshold`:  Predicted load percentage triggering migration.
*   `utilizationThreshold`: Current core utilization percentage triggering migration.
*   `migrationInterval`: Frequency of core affinity checks.
*   `predictionHorizon`: Time horizon for load predictions.
*   `MLModelType`: Type of machine learning model used for load prediction.

**VI. Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved throughput by proactively balancing load.
*   Increased resource utilization by maximizing core utilization.
*   Enhanced scalability by dynamically adapting to changing workloads.
*   Minimizes the impact of load spikes.
