**Dynamic Emphasis Visualization & Emotional Tone Mapping**

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple transcription emphasis to *visualize* the emotional tone of speech within the conversation interface, and use this information to dynamically adjust the presentation of translated text.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Real-time Emotion Analysis:** Integrate a sentiment/emotion analysis engine. This engine will process incoming audio (original and translated) to identify not just emphasis, but a spectrum of emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutrality, etc.).  The engine should output a confidence score for each emotion detected.

2.  **Visual Emphasis Mapping:** 
    *   Develop a color-coding system mapped to emotions (e.g., red = anger, blue = sadness, green = joy, yellow = fear, grey/white = neutral).  
    *   Translated text segments will be highlighted with the color corresponding to the dominant emotion detected in the *original* audio segment. This provides context even when the translation loses nuances of tone.
    *   Emphasis (from the original patent) is overlaid – potentially with brightness or intensity of the color indicating degree of emphasis *and* emotional strength.  A pulsating effect could be used for high-intensity segments.
    *   Offer user customization of the color palette and intensity levels.

3.  **Adaptive Translation Display:**
    *   Implement a "tone-aware" translation algorithm. The algorithm should analyze the detected emotion and subtly adjust word choice in the translation to *better convey* the original emotional intent.  (This is a complex AI task, but the goal is to go beyond literal translation to emotional equivalence.)
    *   Enable a user toggle to switch between "literal translation" and "emotionally-aware translation."
    *   If the translation algorithm *cannot* confidently convey the emotion, display a small indicator icon (e.g., a question mark within a speech bubble) next to the translated segment.

4.  **Conversation Interface Integration:**
    *   The emotional highlighting should be seamlessly integrated into the existing conversation UI.
    *   Each message bubble should display a summary of the detected emotions (e.g., "Dominant Emotion: Joy (85%)").
    *   A “Conversation Emotion Timeline” – a visual graph showing the emotional arc of the entire conversation – could be added as an optional feature.

5.  **API Integration:**
    *   Provide an API to allow third-party applications to access emotion analysis data and integrate it into their own interfaces.

**Pseudocode (Emotion Analysis & Highlighting):**

```
function processAudio(audioData) {
  emotionData = emotionAnalysisEngine.analyze(audioData); // Returns {emotion: "joy", confidence: 0.85}
  dominantEmotion = findDominantEmotion(emotionData);
  emotionColor = getColorForEmotion(dominantEmotion);

  highlightedText = applyColorToText(translatedText, emotionColor);

  return {highlightedText, dominantEmotion};
}

function getColorForEmotion(emotion) {
  switch(emotion) {
    case "joy": return "green";
    case "sadness": return "blue";
    case "anger": return "red";
    case "fear": return "yellow";
    default: return "grey";
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply highlighting emphasized words. It aims to convey *emotional context* within the translated conversation, making it more nuanced and empathetic.  The adaptive translation aspect is a key differentiator.
