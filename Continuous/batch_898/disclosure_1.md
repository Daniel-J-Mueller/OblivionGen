## Dynamic Resource Mirroring via Predictive Latency & Cost

**Concept:** Proactively mirror critical resources across CDN POPs *before* a user request, based on predicted latency *and* fluctuating content provider costs, creating a tiered resource availability system. This goes beyond simple caching and aims for *preemptive* availability optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE):**
    *   Input: Real-time CDN POP latency data (historical & current), content provider cost feeds (API access), user geographic data (aggregated, anonymized), resource access patterns (trending data).
    *   Process:  Utilizes time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict latency spikes *and* cost increases for specific resources.  Calculates a “Resource Availability Score” (RAS) – a weighted combination of predicted latency (lower is better) and predicted cost (lower is better). Weights are configurable per resource type.
    *   Output:  RAS per resource, per POP.  A “Mirroring Recommendation List” – prioritizes resources for preemptive mirroring based on RAS differentials between POPs.

*   **Component 2:  Preemptive Mirroring Service (PMS):**
    *   Input: Mirroring Recommendation List from PAE.
    *   Process:  Initiates resource replication to target POPs based on the recommendation list. Uses a delta-transfer approach to minimize bandwidth usage. Monitors replication progress. Prioritizes resources based on RAS impact & resource criticality.
    *   Output:  Replicated resources available at target POPs.  Replication status updates.

*   **Component 3:  Intelligent DNS Resolver (IDR):**
    *   Input: DNS query from client, client geolocation.
    *   Process:  Instead of solely relying on standard proximity-based routing, IDR incorporates the current RAS data. It routes the request to the POP with the lowest *current* RAS, even if it’s not geographically closest.
    *   Output:  IP address of the optimal POP for serving the request.

**Pseudocode (IDR):**

```
function resolveDNS(dnsQuery, clientGeolocation) {
  // Get list of available POPs & their current RAS scores
  availablePOPs = getAvailablePOPs();
  popScores = getPOPScores(availablePOPs);

  // Calculate score for each POP based on distance + RAS
  for (pop in availablePOPs) {
    distanceScore = calculateDistanceScore(clientGeolocation, pop.location);
    combinedScore = distanceScore + pop.rasScore;
    pop.combinedScore = combinedScore;
  }

  // Sort POPs by combined score (lowest is best)
  sortedPOPs = sortPOPsByScore(sortedPOPs);

  // Return IP address of the best POP
  return sortedPOPs[0].ipAddress;
}
```

**Configuration:**

*   **RAS Weighting:** Configurable weights for latency and cost in the RAS calculation. Allows prioritization of cost savings vs. performance.
*   **Mirroring Threshold:** Define the RAS difference required to trigger resource mirroring.  Higher thresholds reduce storage costs but may impact performance during peak times.
*   **Resource Prioritization:** Categorize resources based on criticality (e.g., high, medium, low) to influence mirroring priority.
*   **Blacklisting:** Ability to blacklist certain resources from mirroring to control storage utilization.
