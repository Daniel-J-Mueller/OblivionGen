## Dynamic Authentication Shards via Biometric Drift

**Concept:** Augment the existing authentication scheme with continuously shifting, biometric-linked "authentication shards." Instead of static key components, portions of the authentication key are tied to subtle, time-varying biometric data from the user, making key compromise significantly harder and enabling continuous authentication.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Data Acquisition & Processing Module (Client-Side)**

*   **Input:** Real-time biometric stream (e.g., subtle facial muscle movements, micro-gestures captured via camera, typing rhythm, gait analysis via accelerometer – multiple modalities preferred for robustness).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Noise reduction and signal filtering.
    *   Feature extraction: Identify key biometric features relevant to user identity.
    *   Drift Calculation:  Compute a 'drift vector' representing the rate of change in these biometric features over a short time window (e.g., 5-10 seconds). This isn’t a static value; it's *how* the biometrics are changing.
    *   Shard Generation: The drift vector is used to seed a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRG). The output of the CSPRG creates a time-sensitive "authentication shard."  The shard’s size (e.g., 32-64 bits) is configurable.
*   **Output:**  Time-sensitive authentication shard.

**2.  Key Shard Distribution Service (Server-Side)**

*   **Initial Setup:**  Similar to the existing scheme. The client requests access. The server provides an initial setup code.
*   **Dynamic Shard Request/Response:**
    *   Client sends a request for a dynamic shard, *along with a timestamp*. This timestamp is crucial for synchronizing shard validity.
    *   Server validates the client’s initial authentication (initial setup code).
    *   Server sends a ‘challenge’ to the client – a random number.
    *   Client combines the challenge with the current biometric drift-generated shard. It hashes the combined value, and transmits this hash to the server.
    *   Server, using its own record of the initial authentication, and the timestamp, checks the validity of the submitted hash.
*   **Shard Validity Window:** Shards are valid for a very short time (e.g., 10-30 seconds). This minimizes the window of opportunity for replay attacks.  The server strictly enforces shard expiry.

**3.  Authentication Key Reconstruction**

*   The final authentication key is reconstructed using a combination of:
    *   The initial static components (from the existing scheme).
    *   A sequence of dynamic shards received over time.
    *   A weighting algorithm that prioritizes more recent shards (to account for biometric drift).
*   The weighting algorithm could be as simple as a decaying average or a more complex Kalman filter.

**4.  Protocol Flow (Pseudocode)**

```
// Client-Side
loop:
  requestDynamicShard()
  receiveShardChallenge()
  generateBiometricShard() // based on current drift
  combinedValue = hash(shardChallenge + biometricShard)
  send(combinedValue)
  if (accessGranted):
    break
  sleep(shardValidityWindow)

// Server-Side
onReceive(combinedValue):
  verifyInitialAuthentication()
  if (valid):
    verifyCombinedValue(combinedValue) // using stored challenge
    if (verified):
      grantAccess()
```

**5.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **Biometric Modality Selection:**  The choice of biometric modalities should be based on accuracy, robustness, and user privacy.
*   **Anti-Spoofing Measures:**  Robust anti-spoofing mechanisms are essential to prevent attackers from injecting fake biometric data.
*   **Privacy:**  Biometric data should be processed locally on the client device whenever possible to minimize privacy risks.  Any data transmitted to the server should be encrypted.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:**  Provide a fallback authentication method in case biometric data is unavailable or unreliable.
