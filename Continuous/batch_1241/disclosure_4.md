## Dynamic Network Topology-Aware Address Allocation

**Concept:** Expand on the distributed allocation concept by integrating real-time network topology information into the allocation process. Instead of static portions of the address space, allocation decisions consider network proximity, bandwidth availability, and latency to optimize traffic flow and reduce congestion.

**Specifications:**

**1. Topology Discovery Service:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitor the network topology. Discover links, bandwidth capacity, latency, and potential congestion points. Utilize active probing (e.g., traceroute, ping) and passive monitoring (e.g., NetFlow, sFlow).
*   **Data Structure:** A dynamic graph representing the network. Nodes represent network devices (routers, switches, servers). Edges represent links with attributes: bandwidth, latency, current utilization.
*   **API:**
    *   `GetNetworkTopology(region)`: Returns the network topology for a specified region.
    *   `GetLinkCapacity(source, destination)`: Returns the available bandwidth between two nodes.
    *   `GetLinkLatency(source, destination)`: Returns the latency between two nodes.

**2. Allocation Manager Enhancement:**

*   **Integration with Topology Service:** The allocation manager queries the Topology Service before allocating address blocks.
*   **Allocation Algorithm:** A cost function is used to evaluate potential allocations. The cost considers:
    *   **Proximity:** Favor allocations within the same region or proximity to the requesting device.
    *   **Bandwidth:** Ensure sufficient bandwidth between the allocated block and the requesting device.
    *   **Latency:** Minimize latency to the requesting device.
    *   **Utilization:** Avoid congested links.
*   **Dynamic Block Sizing:** Address block sizes are dynamically adjusted based on estimated demand and network conditions. Smaller blocks are allocated in high-congestion areas, larger blocks in areas with ample bandwidth.

**3.  Address Block 'Migration' Protocol:**

*   **Function:** Enable seamless movement of address blocks between allocation managers based on changing network conditions.  If a server is moved to a new region, its allocated block should ideally follow it, or be reallocated in the destination region.
*   **Protocol Steps:**
    1.  Source Allocation Manager detects server migration.
    2.  Source Allocation Manager communicates with Destination Allocation Manager.
    3.  Destination Allocation Manager reserves an equivalent block in its address space.
    4.  Source Allocation Manager releases the block.
    5.  Destination Allocation Manager activates the block for the migrated server.
    6.  Update routing tables accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Allocation Algorithm):**

```
function AllocateAddressBlock(requestingDevice, block_size):
  topology = GetNetworkTopology(requestingDevice.region)
  best_allocation = null
  min_cost = infinity

  for each available_block in address_space:
    cost = CalculateAllocationCost(requestingDevice, available_block, topology)

    if cost < min_cost:
      min_cost = cost
      best_allocation = available_block

  if best_allocation != null:
    AllocateBlock(best_allocation)
    return best_allocation
  else:
    return error: "No suitable address block available"

function CalculateAllocationCost(requestingDevice, block, topology):
  proximity_cost = Distance(requestingDevice, block)  // Lower is better
  bandwidth_cost = 1 / GetLinkCapacity(requestingDevice, block) // Lower is better
  latency_cost = GetLinkLatency(requestingDevice, block) // Lower is better
  utilization_cost = GetLinkUtilization(requestingDevice, block) // Lower is better

  total_cost = proximity_cost + bandwidth_cost + latency_cost + utilization_cost
  return total_cost
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `NetworkTopology`: Graph data structure representing network topology.
*   `AllocationRecord`: Stores information about an allocated block (address range, owner, region, etc.).
*   `LinkRecord`: Stores information about a network link (bandwidth, latency, utilization).
