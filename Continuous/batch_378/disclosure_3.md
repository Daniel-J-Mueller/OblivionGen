## Dynamic Watermarking via Perceptual Hashing & Blockchain

**Concept:** Enhance file ownership verification by embedding a dynamic watermark – a perceptual hash – directly linked to a blockchain record. This allows for verification even with minor content modifications while maintaining a robust audit trail.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Perceptual Hash Generator:**  Algorithm to create a hash based on the *perceived* content (audio, video, image).  Must be robust against minor alterations (compression, noise addition).  Utilize a learned perceptual metric (LPIPS) to ensure alignment with human perception.
*   **Blockchain Integration Module:**  Securely store the perceptual hash on a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric). Includes timestamp, owner ID, and potentially licensing information.
*   **Dynamic Watermarking Engine:**  Embedded within encoding/processing pipelines.  Generates the perceptual hash, stores it on the blockchain *before* distribution, and prepares verification data.
*   **Verification Client:**  Standalone application or API endpoint to verify ownership.  Extracts the perceptual hash from the content, retrieves the blockchain record, and compares the hashes.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Content Creation:** User creates digital content.
2.  **Hash Generation:** Dynamic Watermarking Engine generates the perceptual hash.
3.  **Blockchain Registration:**  Hash, timestamp, owner ID, and optional licensing details are stored on the blockchain. A unique transaction ID is generated.
4.  **Content Distribution:** Content is distributed via any channel. The transaction ID is optionally embedded as metadata.
5.  **Verification Request:** User requests verification of ownership.
6.  **Hash Extraction:**  Verification Client extracts the perceptual hash from the received content.
7.  **Blockchain Lookup:**  Verification Client uses the content's metadata (transaction ID) or initiates a blockchain search based on content characteristics (e.g., partial hash matching) to locate the corresponding record.
8.  **Hash Comparison:**  The extracted hash is compared to the hash stored on the blockchain.
9.  **Ownership Confirmation:**  If the hashes match, ownership is confirmed.

**3. Pseudocode (Verification Client):**

```
FUNCTION verifyOwnership(contentFile):
    extractedHash = generatePerceptualHash(contentFile)
    transactionId = extractTransactionId(contentFile)

    IF transactionId IS NOT NULL:
        blockchainRecord = getBlockchainRecord(transactionId)
    ELSE:
        blockchainRecords = searchBlockchain(partialHash=extractedHash) // Search by partial hash
        IF blockchainRecords IS EMPTY:
            RETURN "Ownership verification failed."
        ELSE:
            blockchainRecord = blockchainRecords[0] //Select closest match
    
    storedHash = blockchainRecord.hash
    
    IF extractedHash == storedHash:
        RETURN "Ownership verified."
    ELSE:
        RETURN "Ownership verification failed."

FUNCTION generatePerceptualHash(file):
    // Implementation using learned perceptual image patch similarity
    //  (e.g., LPIPS)
    RETURN hashValue
```

**4. Advanced Features:**

*   **Adaptive Hash Strength:** Adjust the perceptual hash algorithm’s sensitivity based on content type and risk assessment.
*   **Revocation Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism to revoke access or ownership via blockchain updates.
*   **Licensing Integration:** Store licensing terms directly on the blockchain, enabling automated enforcement.
*   **Content-Based Search:** Utilize the perceptual hash as a fingerprint for content-based searches and duplicate detection.
*   **Decentralized Verification:**  Allow multiple nodes on a decentralized blockchain network to verify ownership, enhancing security and resilience.
