## Multi-Layered Temporal Data Preservation

**Concept:** Extend the read-before-write functionality to capture *multiple* historical states of the magnetic tape data, creating a temporal data archive alongside the primary data stream.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Stacked Read Heads:** Implement a vertically stacked array of read heads, each offset slightly in time relative to the others.  Each head reads a slightly earlier portion of the tape than the head below it. Minimum of 3, scalable to 8 or more.
    *   **High-Speed Buffer:** Implement a dedicated, extremely high-speed buffer (e.g., utilizing NVMe SSDs in a RAID configuration) to store the multi-layered read data.  Capacity dependent on the number of read heads and desired preservation depth, but aim for at least 1TB initial capacity.
    *   **Servo Head Integration:** Utilize existing servo head functionality for precise positioning of all read heads.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Temporal Data Manager (TDM):** A firmware module responsible for managing the layered read heads and data capture.
    *   **Data Stamping:**  Each layer of captured data is timestamped with the tape position and read head ID.
    *   **Compression/De-duplication:** Implement lossless compression algorithms (e.g., LZ4, Zstandard) and data de-duplication techniques to minimize storage requirements.
    *   **Client API:** Provide a client API to access and query the historical data layers.  Allow filtering by timestamp, tape position, and data content.
    *   **Write Interleaving:** The firmware must coordinate write operations with the read operations. The primary data write head should be positioned *after* the topmost read head in the array to guarantee that the topmost read head captures the data *before* it is overwritten.
*   **Operational Procedure (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    // On Write Command Received
    function handleWriteCommand(data, tapePosition):
        // Activate Read Head Array
        activateReadHeads()

        // Advance Tape to Specified Position
        advanceTape(tapePosition)

        // Capture Historical Data Layers
        historicalData = captureHistoricalData() // Reads from all heads

        // Write New Data
        writeData(data, tapePosition)

        // Store Historical Data
        storeHistoricalData(historicalData)

        // Return Confirmation to Client
        returnConfirmation()
    ```

*   **Data Structure:**

    ```
    HistoricalDataLayer {
        timestamp: DateTime
        tapePosition: Integer
        readHeadID: Integer
        data: Byte[]
    }

    HistoricalData {
        layers: HistoricalDataLayer[]
    }
    ```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   **Forensic Data Recovery:**  Reconstruct past states of the data for investigative purposes.
    *   **Version Control:** Implement a time-based version control system for magnetic tape data.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns or changes in the data over time.
    *   **Data Mining:** Extract valuable insights from historical data trends.

    This system moves beyond simply preserving the *immediately* overwritten data to creating a much deeper, more comprehensive historical record.  The stacked head architecture allows for simultaneous capture of multiple data states, enabling a range of new applications and functionalities.
