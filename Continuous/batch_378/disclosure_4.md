**Dynamic Affinity Grouping with Temporal Decay & Multi-Modal Input**

**Concept:** Expanding upon the core of profile-based group suggestions, this system introduces a temporal decay factor for affinity scores and incorporates multi-modal input beyond simple profile similarity.  Instead of static percentage similarity, user affinity is calculated dynamically, decreasing over time if there’s no interaction.  Furthermore, the system will ingest data from multiple sources – text, image, and potentially even audio/video – to determine topical alignment, going beyond profile keywords.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:** System accepts input from user profiles (text descriptions, stated preferences), user-generated content (posts, images, video), and external data sources (e.g., social media feeds, shopping history – with appropriate privacy controls/permissions).
*   **Feature Extraction Modules:**
    *   **Text Analysis:**  NLP pipeline for extracting keywords, topics, sentiment from text data. Utilize transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) for semantic understanding.
    *   **Image Analysis:** CNN models (ResNet, Inception) for object detection, scene understanding, and aesthetic feature extraction.
    *   **Audio/Video Analysis (Optional):**  Models for speech recognition, emotion detection, and activity recognition.
*   **Feature Vector Creation:**  Each user and item is represented by a high-dimensional feature vector combining the outputs of the analysis modules.

**2. Affinity Score Calculation:**

*   **Baseline Similarity:** Initial affinity score based on profile similarity (as in the source patent).
*   **Content Alignment:** Calculate similarity between user and item feature vectors using cosine similarity or other appropriate metrics.
*   **Temporal Decay:**  Implement a decay factor that reduces the affinity score over time if there is no interaction (e.g., likes, comments, purchases) between the user and the item or other users.
    *   Formula: `Affinity = Baseline + ContentAlignment * (1 - DecayRate * TimeSinceLastInteraction)`
    *   `DecayRate`: Tunable parameter controlling the rate of decay.
    *   `TimeSinceLastInteraction`:  Time elapsed since the last interaction.
*   **Interaction Boost:** Implement a boost to the affinity score when a user interacts positively with an item or another user.

**3. Dynamic Group Formation:**

*   **Group Request:** User initiates a group request with a topic and desired group size.
*   **Candidate Selection:** Identify a pool of candidate users based on affinity scores.
*   **Diversity Optimization:**  Implement an algorithm to optimize group diversity. This could involve selecting users with different interests or backgrounds.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** Continuously monitor group dynamics and adjust membership based on interaction patterns and affinity score changes.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices Architecture:** Decompose the system into independent microservices (e.g., data ingestion, feature extraction, affinity calculation, group management).
*   **Scalable Data Store:** Utilize a scalable data store (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) to store user profiles, item data, and affinity scores.
*   **Message Queue:** Utilize a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to handle asynchronous communication between microservices.

**Pseudocode (Affinity Calculation):**

```
function calculate_affinity(user_profile, item_data, last_interaction_time):
  baseline_similarity = calculate_profile_similarity(user_profile, item_data)
  content_alignment = calculate_content_similarity(user_profile, item_data)
  decay_rate = 0.01 // Tune this parameter
  time_since_last_interaction = current_time - last_interaction_time
  temporal_decay = 1 - decay_rate * time_since_last_interaction
  affinity = baseline_similarity + content_alignment * temporal_decay
  return affinity
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Explainable AI:** Provide explanations for why certain users were recommended to a group.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Allow users to control what data is used to calculate their affinity scores.
*   **Gamification:**  Incorporate gamification elements to encourage user interaction and engagement.
*   **Cross-Platform Integration:** Integrate with other platforms (e.g., social media, e-commerce) to gather more data and enhance affinity calculations.
