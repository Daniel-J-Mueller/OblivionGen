**Dynamic Content 'Health' Scoring & Predictive Blocking**

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple conversion rate thresholds to create a real-time ‘health’ score for content delivery based on a multi-faceted analysis of user interaction, extending predictive blocking capabilities.

**Components:**

1.  **Interaction Data Collection:**
    *   Beyond conversions, collect granular user interaction data: time on page, scroll depth, mouse movements (heatmaps), keystroke patterns, API call frequency, device fingerprinting, CSS override detection (ad-blocker presence), Javascript execution anomalies.
    *   Categorize interactions into ‘positive’ (scroll, clicks, form submissions), ‘neutral’ (page views), and ‘negative’ (immediate back button, rapidly scrolling, script blocking).

2.  **‘Health’ Score Calculation:**
    *   Assign weighted values to each interaction category. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on historical data (machine learning). A basic example:
        *   Positive Interactions: +5 to +20 points
        *   Neutral Interactions: +1 point
        *   Negative Interactions: -2 to -10 points
    *   Calculate a rolling average ‘health’ score for each content instance (ad, article, etc.) and for the user/publisher. 
    *   Introduce decay factor – older interactions have less weight.

3.  **Predictive Blocking Model:**
    *   Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) on the historical ‘health’ score data. The model predicts the likelihood of a user being a bot/automated process *before* a conversion is attempted.
    *   Input features: ‘health’ score, user/publisher history, content type, geographical location, time of day.
    *   Output: Probability score (0-1) indicating the likelihood of malicious activity.

4.  **Dynamic Thresholds & Action Triggers:**
    *   Instead of fixed thresholds, use dynamically adjusted thresholds based on the predictive model's output and overall system risk assessment.
    *   Action Triggers:
        *   **Low Risk (Score > 0.7):** Normal content delivery.
        *   **Medium Risk (0.3 < Score < 0.7):** CAPTCHA challenge, rate limiting, or delayed content delivery.
        *   **High Risk (Score < 0.3):** Immediate blocking, IP address flagging, and data collection for analysis.
        *   **'Suspicious Spike' Detection**: Implement an anomaly detection algorithm to identify sudden drops in health scores for specific content/users, triggering immediate investigation.

5.  **Feedback Loop & Model Retraining:**
    *   Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the blocking actions.
    *   Use the feedback to retrain the machine learning model, improving its accuracy and reducing false positives/negatives.

**Pseudocode (Simplified)**

```
function calculate_health_score(interaction_data):
  score = 0
  for interaction in interaction_data:
    if interaction.type == "positive":
      score += 10
    elif interaction.type == "neutral":
      score += 1
    elif interaction.type == "negative":
      score -= 5
  return score

function predict_bot_probability(user_data, content_data, model):
  features = [user_data.history, content_data.type, calculate_health_score(user_data.interactions)]
  probability = model.predict(features)
  return probability

function handle_request(user_data, content_data, model):
  probability = predict_bot_probability(user_data, content_data, model)
  if probability > 0.7:
    deliver_content(user_data, content_data)
  elif probability < 0.3:
    block_request(user_data, content_data)
  else:
    present_captcha(user_data, content_data)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Proactive bot detection before conversions occur.
*   Reduced false positives through nuanced data analysis.
*   Adaptive blocking strategies based on risk levels.
*   Improved overall system security and ad quality.
*   Ability to identify and flag malicious actors more effectively.
