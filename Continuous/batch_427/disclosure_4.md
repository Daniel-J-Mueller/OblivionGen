## Dynamic Transaction Attribute Tagging & Routing

**Concept:** Expand the attribute handling beyond static field placement within transactions. Implement a dynamic tagging system where attributes are encapsulated as separate, tagged data packets *alongside* the core address transaction, allowing for flexible routing and processing based on attribute type *without* modifying the core address field structure.

**Specs:**

*   **Attribute Packet Structure:**
    *   `Attribute ID`: 8-bit identifier for the attribute type (Function Number, Device Number, Bus Number, VM Identifier, etc.) – extensible list.
    *   `Attribute Data`: Variable length (up to 64 bits) payload containing the attribute value.
    *   `Priority Flag`: 1-bit flag indicating the attribute’s processing priority.
    *   `Route Tag`: 4-bit tag indicating pre-defined routing destination (e.g., specific processing unit, peripheral device).

*   **Host Bridge Modification:**
    *   Receive first transaction & attribute from processor core.
    *   Encapsulate attribute into Attribute Packet.
    *   Transmit both original transaction *and* Attribute Packet via internal bus.
    *   Implement a configuration register to define default Route Tags for specific attribute IDs.

*   **Configurable Port Modification:**
    *   Receive transaction *and* accompanying Attribute Packet(s).
    *   Prioritize Attribute Packet processing based on Priority Flag.
    *   Route Attribute Packet(s) to designated processing unit or peripheral based on Route Tag.
    *   Process the transaction independently, minimizing the need to decode attributes *from* the address field.

*   **Internal Bus Protocol Extension:**
    *   Add mechanism for transmitting multiple data packets (transaction + attribute packets) in a single burst.
    *   Include packet type identifier to differentiate between transaction and attribute packets.

**Pseudocode (Configurable Port):**

```
function receive_and_process_packets():
    transaction = receive_transaction()
    attribute_packets = receive_attribute_packets()

    for packet in attribute_packets:
        if packet.priority == HIGH:
            route_packet(packet)  // Send to designated processing unit
        else:
            queue_packet(packet)  // Store for later processing

    process_transaction(transaction)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Flexibility:** Enables dynamic attribute handling without altering core transaction structure.
*   **Improved Performance:** Offloads attribute decoding from core address processing.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** Simplifies addition of new attributes without bus redesign.
*   **Fine-Grained Control:** Enables targeted routing of attributes to specific processing units.
*   **Support for Virtualization**: VM identifier can directly tag packets for specific VM environments.
