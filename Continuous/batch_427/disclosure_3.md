## Haptic Projection Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the locking/selection paradigm beyond the display surface using localized haptic feedback projected onto the user’s hand/finger, creating a ‘virtual button’ sensation *before* contact with the screen. This moves interaction from purely visual/touch to incorporate tactile confirmation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of micro-ultrasonic transducers embedded in the bezel of the display device (phone, tablet, monitor).  Minimum density: 100 transducers per 10cm<sup>2</sup>.  Frequency range: 40-80 kHz.
    *   Depth sensor (time-of-flight or structured light) to accurately track hand/finger position in 3D space. Resolution: 1mm. Range: 5-20cm.
    *   High-speed processor dedicated to real-time acoustic focusing and modulation.
    *   Capacitive touch sensor array integrated beneath the display surface.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**

    1.  **Hand/Finger Tracking:** Depth sensor provides 3D position data of the user’s finger/hand.
    2.  **Selection Prediction:** Algorithm predicts the interface element the user is intending to select based on finger trajectory and proximity to on-screen elements.
    3.  **Acoustic Focusing:**  Processor focuses ultrasonic energy from transducer array onto the skin surface corresponding to the predicted selection point. This creates a localized pressure sensation – a ‘virtual button’.
    4.  **Haptic Modulation:**  The intensity and frequency of the ultrasonic waves are modulated to create different haptic textures (e.g., click, ripple, texture).  This provides feedback confirming the selection is locked or highlighted.
    5.  **Locking/Selection Confirmation:** When the user’s finger nears the predicted selection point, the haptic feedback intensifies and changes subtly to indicate locking.  Screen selection occurs on physical contact.
    6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Algorithm continuously adjusts the focal point and haptic feedback based on user movement and predicted intent.
    7.  **Calibration Routine:** User-specific calibration routine to account for hand size, skin sensitivity, and acoustic properties.

*   **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    // Initialization
    calibrate_haptic_system(user_profile)

    // Main Loop
    while (true) {
        hand_position = get_hand_position_from_depth_sensor()
        predicted_selection = predict_selection_target(hand_position, on_screen_elements)

        if (predicted_selection != null) {
            focus_ultrasonic_energy(predicted_selection)
            modulate_haptic_feedback(predicted_selection, user_preference)

            if (hand_position.distance_to(predicted_selection) < locking_threshold) {
                lock_selection()
            }
        }
    }

    function lock_selection() {
        // visually highlight selection
        // intensify haptic feedback
        // wait for screen contact
        // trigger selection event
    }
    ```

*   **Use Cases:**

    *   Mobile Gaming: Precise virtual button presses.
    *   AR/VR Interaction: Tactile feedback in virtual environments.
    *   Accessibility:  Alternative input method for users with visual impairments.
    *   Precision Editing:  Targeted selection of on-screen objects.
