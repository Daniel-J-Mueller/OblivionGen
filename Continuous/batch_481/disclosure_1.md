**Adaptive Event Payload Enrichment & Contextual Routing**

**Specification:**

This system extends the core event routing capability by dynamically enriching event payloads *before* routing, based on contextual data and learned associations. It addresses scenarios where downstream services require information not initially present in incoming events, reducing the need for repeated requests or complex data transformations.

**Components:**

1.  **Contextual Data Store:** A key-value store (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) housing dynamic contextual information. This information can originate from various sources: real-time sensor data, user profiles, geographic location, service health status, current time, trending topics, etc.

2.  **Enrichment Rule Engine:**  A rules engine (e.g., Drools, easy-rules) that defines rules for enriching event payloads. Rules specify conditions based on event data and/or contextual data, and actions that modify the event payload.  These rules are stored and managed separately from the core routing rules.

3.  **Payload Transformer:** A module responsible for applying the transformations defined by the Enrichment Rule Engine to the event payload. It supports various transformation types: adding new fields, modifying existing fields, replacing fields, or appending data.

4.  **Learned Association Engine:**  A machine learning module (e.g., a recommendation system) that learns associations between event types, contextual data, and downstream service requirements.  This engine suggests enrichment rules based on observed patterns and predicts which enrichments are most likely to be useful.  Can use techniques like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.

5.  **Routing Policy Integrator:** This module merges the enrichment rules, learned associations and standard routing rules into a coherent routing policy before the event is sent. This guarantees the output is a consistent flow.

**Workflow:**

1.  An incoming event is received by the Event Routing Service.

2.  The Learned Association Engine suggests potential enrichment rules based on the event type and current context.

3.  The Enrichment Rule Engine evaluates the applicable rules, considering both pre-defined rules and suggested rules.

4.  The Payload Transformer applies the selected transformations to the event payload.

5.  The Routing Policy Integrator combines the now enriched event with the current routing policies.

6.  The enriched event is routed to the appropriate target(s) according to the defined routing rules.

**Pseudocode (Enrichment Rule Engine):**

```
function evaluate_rules(event, context):
  rules = get_applicable_rules(event.type)  // Fetch rules based on event type

  for rule in rules:
    if rule.condition(event, context):  // Check if the condition is met
      event.payload = rule.transform(event.payload, context) // Apply transformation
  return event
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Rule`:
    *   `condition`: Function(event, context) -> Boolean
    *   `transform`: Function(payload, context) -> Payload

*   `Event`:
    *   `type`: String
    *   `payload`: JSON Object

**Scalability & Reliability:**

*   Utilize a distributed architecture for all components.
*   Cache frequently accessed contextual data.
*   Implement circuit breakers and retry mechanisms.
*   Monitor key metrics such as enrichment latency and rule execution errors.
