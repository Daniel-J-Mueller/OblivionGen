## Dynamic Output Host Prioritization & Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive failover to *proactive* output host prioritization based on real-time performance metrics and predictive modeling. Instead of simply switching when a host fails or is overloaded, the system continuously evaluates host capacity and *predicts* potential bottlenecks *before* they impact output. This allows for smooth, preemptive load balancing and prioritization of critical output streams.

**Specifications:**

*   **Performance Metric Collection:** Each output host will expose an API endpoint providing real-time metrics:
    *   CPU Utilization
    *   Memory Usage
    *   Network Latency (to output devices)
    *   Output Queue Length (number of pending output requests)
    *   Error Rate (number of failed output attempts)
*   **Predictive Modeling Module:** This module will analyze historical and real-time performance data using a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM). The model will predict future resource utilization for each host.
*   **Priority Scoring:** Each output request will be assigned a priority score based on several factors:
    *   **Source Application:** Critical applications (e.g., safety systems) will have higher priority.
    *   **Output Location:** Locations requiring immediate attention (e.g., emergency alerts) will have higher priority.
    *   **Data Type:** Urgent data streams (e.g., real-time sensor readings) will have higher priority.
*   **Dynamic Routing Algorithm:** This algorithm will select the optimal output host based on:
    *   Predicted host capacity (from Predictive Modeling Module).
    *   Priority score of the output request.
    *   Network latency to the output device.
    *   Current load on each host.
*   **Load Balancing Strategy:** Implement a weighted round-robin or least connections strategy, dynamically adjusting weights based on host capacity predictions.
*   **Output Host "Health" Score:** Combine current metrics with predictive modeling output to generate a comprehensive "health" score for each host. This score will be used for routing decisions and to trigger alerts if a host is nearing capacity.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Allow the system administrator to configure thresholds for host "health" scores and resource utilization metrics. The system will automatically adjust these thresholds based on historical data and learned patterns.
*   **Simulation Mode:** Incorporate a simulation mode to test different load balancing strategies and parameter settings before deploying them to the production environment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Function: RouteOutput(outputRequest)
// Input: outputRequest (containing data, location, priority)
// Output: Successful routing of outputRequest

function RouteOutput(outputRequest) {
    priorityScore = CalculatePriorityScore(outputRequest);
    availableHosts = GetAvailableHosts();
    bestHost = null;
    bestScore = -1;

    for each host in availableHosts {
        predictedLoad = PredictiveModelingModule.PredictLoad(host);
        hostScore = CalculateHostScore(host, predictedLoad, priorityScore);

        if (hostScore > bestScore) {
            bestScore = hostScore;
            bestHost = host;
        }
    }

    if (bestHost != null) {
        SendOutputToHost(outputRequest, bestHost);
        return true;
    } else {
        // Handle the case where no suitable host is available
        LogError("No available output host");
        return false;
    }
}

// Function: CalculateHostScore(host, predictedLoad, priorityScore)
// Calculates a score for each host based on its predicted load and the priority of the output request
function CalculateHostScore(host, predictedLoad, priorityScore) {
    //Higher weight towards priority, then subtract the predicted load
    return (priorityScore * 0.7) - (predictedLoad * 0.3);
}
```

**Potential Downstream Applications:**

*   Integration with automated scaling systems to dynamically provision additional output hosts based on predicted demand.
*   Development of an AI-powered anomaly detection system to identify and address potential performance bottlenecks before they impact output.
*   Creation of a dashboard to visualize real-time performance metrics and predict future capacity requirements.
