## Adaptive Route Prioritization via Predictive Network Congestion

**Concept:** Extend the routing service to not just *discover* routes, but to *predict* congestion along those routes and dynamically prioritize traffic based on predicted latency. This leverages machine learning to anticipate network bottlenecks *before* they impact performance.

**Specs:**

1.  **Congestion Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time network telemetry (latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization) from various points within the provider network, historical traffic patterns, and application-level QoS requests.
    *   Processing:  Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) trained on historical data to predict future congestion levels along each potential route. Model should be retrained periodically (e.g., hourly) with new data.
    *   Output:  A "congestion score" (0-100) for each route, representing the predicted probability of experiencing significant congestion within a specific timeframe (e.g., next 5 minutes).

2.  **Adaptive Route Selection Algorithm:**
    *   Input:  Destination network, available routes (as determined by the existing RIB), congestion scores for each route, application-level QoS requirements (latency sensitivity, bandwidth demand).
    *   Processing:
        *   Assign a "route quality score" based on a weighted combination of congestion score, path length (hops), and historical performance.  Weights should be configurable via a central management interface.
        *   Prioritize routes with the lowest route quality score.
        *   Incorporate a "diversity" factor to avoid relying on a single congested route. Algorithm should attempt to select alternate paths even if slightly less optimal to enhance resilience.
    *   Output: A prioritized list of routes to the destination.

3.  **Real-time Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor actual network performance (latency, packet loss) along selected routes.
    *   Compare actual performance to predicted performance.
    *   Use this feedback to refine the congestion prediction model and improve the accuracy of future route selections.

4.  **API Extensions:**
    *   New API endpoint to retrieve congestion scores for specific routes.
    *   API parameter to specify QoS requirements (e.g., maximum acceptable latency) to influence route selection.
    *   API for configuring weighting factors used in the route quality score calculation.

**Pseudocode (Route Selection):**

```
function selectRoute(destination, qosRequirements):
  routes = getRoutesFromRIB(destination)
  for route in routes:
    congestionScore = getCongestionScore(route)
    pathLength = getPathLength(route)
    historicalPerformance = getHistoricalPerformance(route)
    routeQualityScore = (weightCongestion * congestionScore) + (weightPathLength * pathLength) + (weightHistorical * historicalPerformance)
    route.qualityScore = routeQualityScore
  routes.sort(by=qualityScore) // Ascending order (lowest score is best)

  // Diversity check: Penalize routes that are very similar to the top choice
  for route in routes:
    if route != routes[0]:
      similarityScore = calculateRouteSimilarity(route, routes[0])
      if similarityScore > threshold:
        route.qualityScore += penalty

  return routes[0]
```

**Rationale:**  Existing routing systems are primarily reactive â€“ they respond to congestion *after* it occurs. This innovation aims to be proactive, predicting congestion and preemptively selecting routes that offer the best performance. This aligns with increasingly demanding application requirements (e.g., low-latency gaming, real-time video conferencing).
