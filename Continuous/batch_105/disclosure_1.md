## Dynamic Replication Zones Based on Predictive Load

**Concept:** Expand beyond static primary/secondary replication by introducing *predictive* replication zones. Instead of solely relying on geographical redundancy for failover, proactively replicate data to zones anticipating higher load or potential disruption *before* it occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Replication Manager (PRM) - a service running alongside the database infrastructure.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical Load Data: Database query logs, application usage patterns.
    *   Real-time Load Data: Current database metrics (CPU, memory, I/O), application activity.
    *   External Event Data: Weather reports, news feeds (for potential regional outages), scheduled maintenance windows.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:**  Time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) combined with machine learning models trained on historical and real-time data.  The model predicts expected load on each data zone.
*   **Replication Logic:**
    *   Baseline Replication: Maintain standard primary/secondary replication for disaster recovery.
    *   Predictive Replication: Based on the prediction algorithm:
        *   If a zone is predicted to experience high load, *proactively* replicate a read-only copy of relevant data to that zone. This acts as a cache, reducing load on the primary.
        *   If a zone is predicted to experience disruption (e.g., severe weather), *proactively* replicate a full (or partial) read-write copy to that zone. This prepares for a seamless failover.
    *   Dynamic Zone Assignment: Zones are not fixed. The PRM dynamically assigns data to the most appropriate zone based on prediction and available resources.
*   **Failover Mechanism:**
    *   Intelligent Routing: A DNS-based load balancer (or similar) routes requests to the optimal zone (primary, secondary, or predictive zone).
    *   Automatic Failover: If a zone fails, the load balancer automatically redirects traffic to the next available zone.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /replication_zones`:  Configure predictive replication settings (e.g., prediction horizon, acceptable latency).
    *   `GET /replication_status`:  Retrieve the current replication status (zones, data replicated, predicted load).

**Pseudocode (PRM core loop):**

```
loop:
    // 1. Collect Data
    historical_load = load from database logs
    realtime_load = current database metrics
    external_events = data from external sources

    // 2. Predict Load
    predicted_load = prediction_algorithm(historical_load, realtime_load, external_events)

    // 3. Determine Replication Strategy
    replication_plan = determine_replication_strategy(predicted_load)

    // 4. Execute Replication Plan
    for zone in replication_plan:
        if zone needs more data:
            replicate_data(zone)
        if zone has excess data:
            remove_data(zone)

    // 5. Monitor and Adjust
    monitor_replication_health()
    adjust_replication_strategy_based_on_performance()

    sleep(interval) // Check regularly
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple geographic redundancy and *anticipates* load and disruption, allowing for proactive data placement and improved performance/availability.  It's a shift from *reactive* failover to *proactive* resilience.
