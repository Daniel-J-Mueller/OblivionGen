## Autonomous Drone Inventory Auditing with Dynamic RFID Mesh

**System Specifications:**

*   **Drone Platform:** Quadcopter, minimum 15-minute flight time, integrated high-resolution camera (4K minimum), obstacle avoidance sensors (LiDAR or equivalent), secure communication link (encrypted WiFi or 5G). Payload capacity: 500g.
*   **RFID Mesh Network:** Deploy a network of low-cost, battery-powered RFID readers throughout the inventory area. Readers communicate wirelessly (LoRaWAN or similar) forming a self-healing mesh. Each reader has a unique ID and approximate location data. Reader density: 1 reader per 100 square meters, adjustable based on inventory density.
*   **Drone Software:**
    *   **Path Planning:** Autonomous flight path generation optimized for complete inventory coverage, accounting for obstacles and RFID reader locations.
    *   **RFID Data Aggregation:**  Software module to receive RFID read data from the mesh network *during* flight. Data includes tag ID, reader ID, signal strength, timestamp.
    *   **Data Fusion:** Combine RFID data with camera imagery to visually verify tag locations and identify discrepancies.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Algorithms to flag missing tags, misplaced items (based on expected location), and tags with weak signal strength (potential issues).
    *   **Real-Time Reporting:** Dashboard to display inventory status, anomaly alerts, and historical data.
*   **Data Storage:** Cloud-based storage for RFID data, camera imagery, and audit reports.
*   **Power System:**  Drone utilizes hot-swappable batteries. RFID readers utilize replaceable batteries with a predicted lifespan of 6 months.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, encrypted communication between drone, RFID mesh, and cloud storage.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Setup:** Deploy RFID mesh network throughout inventory area. Calibrate drone path planning software with mesh network map.
2.  **Flight:** Drone autonomously follows pre-programmed flight path, continuously receiving RFID data from mesh network.
3.  **Data Processing:**  Software module fuses RFID data with camera imagery, identifies anomalies, and generates real-time reports.
4.  **Alerting:**  System alerts personnel to any identified discrepancies.
5.  **Auditing:** Personnel investigate and resolve any alerts.
6.  **Reporting:** System generates comprehensive inventory audit reports.

**Pseudocode - Anomaly Detection Module:**

```
function detectAnomalies(RFID_Data, Expected_Locations):
    Anomalies = []
    for tag_id, location_data in RFID_Data:
        expected_location = Expected_Locations[tag_id]
        distance = calculateDistance(location_data, expected_location)
        if distance > threshold:
            Anomalies.append({
                'tag_id': tag_id,
                'actual_location': location_data,
                'expected_location': expected_location,
                'distance': distance
            })
        if signal_strength(location_data) < low_signal_threshold:
            Anomalies.append({
                'tag_id': tag_id,
                'signal_strength': signal_strength(location_data),
                'location': location_data
            })
    return Anomalies
```

**Novelty:**

This system differs from the provided patent by utilizing a *distributed* RFID reading network in conjunction with autonomous drone flight. The patent focuses on a centralized reader and table management. This design moves the reading capability *throughout* the inventory space, improving coverage and reducing blind spots. The autonomous drone provides a dynamic, aerial view for verification and anomaly detection, complementing the RFID data. This allows for real-time inventory auditing with minimal human intervention.
