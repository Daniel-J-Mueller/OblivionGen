## Dynamic Contextual Modulation of Communication Parameters

**Specification:** A system for modulating communication parameters (codec, transport type, modality) based on real-time environmental context and user activity, going beyond pre-configured profiles.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *identifying* pre-set parameters. This expands upon that by *dynamically adjusting* them during a communication session. Itâ€™s not just *who* is communicating, but *how* and *where* are they communicating *right now* that drives the parameter selection.

**System Components:**

1.  **Environmental Sensor Suite:** Each device (voice-enabled device, phone, etc.) integrates or connects to sensors:
    *   Microphone Array: Analyzes ambient noise levels, echo characteristics, and direction of speech.
    *   Camera: Identifies scene type (office, home, outdoors), user gestures, and facial expressions.
    *   Motion Sensor: Detects user movement and activity level.
    *   Network Analyzer: Monitors network bandwidth, latency, and packet loss.

2.  **Contextual Reasoning Engine:** A machine learning model that fuses sensor data to infer the current communication context. This engine assigns weights to each sensor input based on its relevance to communication quality. Examples:
    *   High ambient noise + outdoor scene = prioritize noise suppression codec, higher bit rate.
    *   Low bandwidth + moving user = switch to lower resolution video, prioritize audio.
    *   User expressing frustration (facial analysis) = prioritize audio clarity, minimize latency.

3.  **Communication Parameter Modulation Module:**  This module receives context from the Reasoning Engine and dynamically adjusts communication parameters *during the session*.  The adjustments are seamless to the user.  The module uses a policy table defining how context maps to parameter changes.

4.  **User Feedback Loop:**  Integrates implicit (e.g., speech pauses, re-articulation) and explicit (e.g., button presses, voice commands) user feedback to refine the Contextual Reasoning Engine and Policy Table.

**Pseudocode (Communication Parameter Modulation Module):**

```
function modulateParameters(contextData, currentParameters):
  policy = lookupPolicy(contextData)
  newParameters = currentParameters
  
  if policy.codec != newParameters.codec:
    newParameters.codec = policy.codec
    triggerCodecSwitch(newParameters.codec)
  
  if policy.bitrate != newParameters.bitrate:
    newParameters.bitrate = policy.bitrate
    triggerBitrateChange(newParameters.bitrate)
  
  if policy.transportType != newParameters.transportType:
    newParameters.transportType = policy.transportType
    triggerTransportSwitch(newParameters.transportType)

  return newParameters
```

**Policy Table Example:**

| Context | Codec | Bitrate (kbps) | Transport Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| Quiet Room, Stationary User | Opus | 64 | UDP |
| Noisy Environment, Moving User | AAC-ELD | 32 | TCP |
| Low Bandwidth | G.711 | 8 | TCP |
| Video Conference | H.264 | 1024 | QUIC |

**Innovation & Potential:**

*   **Proactive Adaptation:**  Goes beyond reacting to network conditions; adapts to the entire communication environment.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** Improves communication quality in challenging conditions, minimizing frustration.
*   **Personalized Communication:**  Adapts to individual user preferences and communication styles.
*   **Reduced Bandwidth Usage:** Optimizes parameters for available bandwidth, improving scalability.
