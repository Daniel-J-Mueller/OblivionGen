## Dynamic Access Window Merging & Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically merging access windows based on real-time co-access patterns *and* predictive prefetching of merged window content.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on moving items *between* windows. This system leverages that movement, but goes further by intelligently consolidating frequently co-accessed items into larger, unified access windows *before* a request is even made, and proactively loading that content. This reduces latency and potentially the number of requests needed.

**System Components:**

1.  **Co-Access Pattern Analyzer:** A module that continuously monitors item access requests and identifies items frequently accessed together within a defined timeframe.
2.  **Window Merger:** A component that dynamically merges existing access windows based on the output of the Co-Access Pattern Analyzer. Merging criteria include a co-access frequency threshold and a maximum merged window size.
3.  **Predictive Prefetcher:** A module that predicts future access requests based on the merged window patterns and proactively loads the merged window's content into a faster tier of storage (e.g., in-memory cache).
4.  **Access Request Interceptor:** Intercepts incoming access requests, determines if the requested items are present in a proactively loaded merged window, and serves the request directly from the faster storage tier.
5.  **Window Splitter:** Splits merged windows if co-access patterns shift significantly or if the window exceeds a maximum size.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
MAX_WINDOW_SIZE = 1024 items
COACCESS_THRESHOLD = 0.7  // 70% co-access frequency
prefetchQueue = []

// Main Loop
ON ACCESS_REQUEST(itemIDList):
    IF itemIDList IN PROACTIVELY_LOADED_WINDOW:
        SERVE_FROM_FAST_STORAGE()
        UPDATE_COACCESS_PATTERN()
    ELSE:
        LOAD_FROM_DATA_STORE()
        UPDATE_COACCESS_PATTERN()

// Background Task - Co-Access Pattern Analysis
FUNCTION UPDATE_COACCESS_PATTERN():
    coaccessMap = {} // Item ID : frequency with current window

    FOR each itemID IN CURRENTLY_ACCESSED_ITEMS:
      FOR each otherItemID IN CURRENTLY_ACCESSED_ITEMS:
        IF itemID != otherItemID:
          IF itemID in coaccessMap:
            coaccessMap[itemID] += 1
          ELSE:
            coaccessMap[itemID] = 1

// Background Task - Dynamic Window Merging
FUNCTION MERGE_WINDOWS():
  windows = GET_CURRENT_WINDOWS()
  FOR window1 IN windows:
    FOR window2 IN windows:
      IF window1 != window2:
        mergedWindow = COMBINE(window1, window2)
        IF SIZE(mergedWindow) <= MAX_WINDOW_SIZE AND COACCESS_SCORE(mergedWindow) >= COACCESS_THRESHOLD:
          MERGE(window1, window2, mergedWindow)

// Background Task - Predictive Prefetching
FUNCTION PREFETCH(mergedWindow):
  // Load the contents of mergedWindow into a faster tier of storage.
  LOAD_INTO_FAST_STORAGE(mergedWindow)
  prefetchQueue.append(mergedWindow)

```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Access Window:** A list of item identifiers.
*   **Co-Access Map:** A dictionary mapping item identifiers to their co-access frequencies.
*   **Prefetch Queue:** A queue of merged windows to be proactively loaded.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency due to faster access to frequently co-accessed items.
*   Lower network traffic due to fewer requests.
*   Improved system performance.
*   Adaptive to changing access patterns.
