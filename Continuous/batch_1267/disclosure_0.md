## Adaptive Seed Decay with Environmental Factors

**Concept:** Extend the seed renegotiation concept by introducing environmental factors that accelerate or decelerate seed decay, creating a dynamic, context-aware security system. Rather than purely time-based or response-count-based decay, the system adapts to real-world conditions, potentially indicating compromise more accurately.

**Specifications:**

**1. Environmental Sensor Integration:**

*   **Sensors:** The client device must integrate with (or have access to) a suite of environmental sensors. Minimum set: GPS, accelerometer, microphone, network connectivity status. Optional: ambient light sensor, temperature sensor, barometer.
*   **Data Aggregation:** A dedicated module on the client device continuously collects data from these sensors. Data is timestamped and logged locally.
*   **Data Transmission:** Encrypted sensor data is periodically transmitted to a central server (the "verifier"). Frequency configurable, balance between security and battery life.

**2. Decay Rate Calculation:**

*   **Baseline Decay:** The system has a configurable baseline seed decay rate (e.g., 1% decay per 24 hours).
*   **Environmental Modifiers:** The verifier applies modifiers to the baseline decay rate based on received sensor data:
    *   **Location:** Significant changes in location (determined via GPS) trigger accelerated decay. Rationale: Unauthorized access often involves physical relocation.
    *   **Motion:** Excessive or unusual device motion (accelerometer) accelerates decay. Rationale: Device being tampered with or used in an unexpected manner.
    *   **Network:** Changes in network connectivity (e.g., connecting to a public Wi-Fi network) accelerate decay. Rationale: Increased exposure to potential attacks.
    *   **Audio:** Detection of unusual audio patterns (microphone) accelerates decay. Rationale: Potential eavesdropping or device compromise.
*   **Decay Function:** A weighted function combines the baseline decay and environmental modifiers to determine the actual decay rate. Example: `Final Decay Rate = Baseline + (Weight_Location * Location_Modifier) + (Weight_Motion * Motion_Modifier) + ...`. Weights configurable on the server.

**3. Renegotiation Trigger & Protocol:**

*   **Decay Threshold:** A configurable decay threshold. When the seed decay reaches this threshold, a renegotiation is initiated.
*   **Challenge/Response Mechanism:** (Existing from the referenced patent).  The server sends a challenge based on the current seed, and the client must respond with a correct answer generated using the (decayed) seed.
*   **Seed Update:** Upon successful renegotiation, the server provides the client with a new seed.

**4. Pseudocode (Client Side):**

```
// Initialize Seed & Decay Threshold
seed = initial_seed;
decay_threshold = 0.2; // 20% decay

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Collect Sensor Data
  sensor_data = collect_sensor_data();

  // Calculate Decay Rate
  decay_rate = calculate_decay_rate(sensor_data);

  // Apply Decay
  seed = decay_seed(seed, decay_rate);

  // Check Renegotiation Trigger
  if (seed_decay_level(seed) > decay_threshold) {
    // Initiate Renegotiation
    request_renegotiation();
  }

  sleep(60); // Check every 60 seconds
}
```

**5.  Server-Side Components:**

*   **Sensor Data Analysis:** Module to validate and interpret incoming sensor data.
*   **Decay Rate Configuration:** Interface for administrators to configure baseline decay rates, environmental weights, and thresholds.
*   **Challenge Generation:**  Existing module from the patent.
*   **Seed Management:**  Database to store and manage client seeds.



This approach adds a dynamic layer to seed renegotiation. A compromised device in an unusual environment would decay its seed much faster, triggering a renegotiation before the attacker can exploit the compromised seed. This creates a more proactive and context-aware security system.
