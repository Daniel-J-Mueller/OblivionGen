## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Profiles

**Concept:** Extend cursor/element movement profiles to incorporate dynamically adjusted haptic feedback, creating a more immersive and intuitive user experience. This isn't just about *seeing* movement, but *feeling* it, adapting to the selected speed profile.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Profile Library:** A library of haptic feedback profiles mirroring the existing cursor/response speed curves. Each curve has a corresponding haptic profile defining vibration intensity, waveform, and duration mapped to cursor speed/acceleration.
*   **Dynamic Haptic Adjustment:** The system monitors the selected cursor/response speed profile (as defined in the provided patent).  When a profile changes, the corresponding haptic profile is loaded and activated.
*   **User-Configurable Haptic Intensity:** Allow users to globally adjust the intensity of haptic feedback. This accounts for individual preferences and hardware capabilities.
*   **Contextual Haptic Variation:**  Beyond speed profile, adjust haptics based on *what* the cursor is interacting with on screen. (e.g., “click” haptic stronger for buttons, softer for scrolling lists).
*   **Haptic Profile Generation:**  A tool enabling developers (and potentially users) to create custom haptic profiles. This could involve a visual waveform editor and real-time testing with the application.
*   **Hardware Abstraction Layer:** Interface with various haptic feedback devices (joysticks, controllers, touchscreens) using a standardized API.
*   **Biometric Integration (Optional):** Integrate with biometric sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) to *adapt* haptic feedback intensity based on user stress or excitement.  (e.g., subtly increase haptics during intense gameplay).

**Pseudocode:**

```
//On Application Start
Load Cursor/Response Speed Profiles
Load Corresponding Haptic Profiles
Set Default Haptic Intensity

//On Cursor Speed Profile Change Event
current_speed_profile = GetCurrentCursorSpeedProfile()
haptic_profile = GetHapticProfileForSpeedProfile(current_speed_profile)
SetHapticProfile(haptic_profile)

//On User Interaction Event (e.g., Mouse Movement, Button Click)
interaction_type = GetInteractionType()
element_type = GetElementUnderCursor()
haptic_intensity = CalculateHapticIntensity(interaction_type, element_type, current_speed_profile)
TriggerHapticFeedback(haptic_intensity)
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   This system moves beyond visual feedback, adding a tactile dimension to user interaction.
*   The adaptive nature of the haptics enhances immersion and intuitiveness, particularly in gaming or VR/AR applications.
*   The biometric integration (optional) could create truly personalized and dynamic experiences.
*   The development tool is critical for fostering a rich ecosystem of custom haptic profiles.
