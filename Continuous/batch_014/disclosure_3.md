## Automated Payload Sorting & Stacking System

**Core Concept:** Expand the payload receiver to become a mini-distribution center capable of sorting, stacking, and preparing multiple payloads for retrieval. This moves beyond simple delivery reception to active logistics support.

**System Components:**

*   **Enhanced Top Frame:** Modified to incorporate a small, internal conveyor system. The opening remains large enough for typical drone payloads, but now includes integrated rails for automated movement.
*   **Multi-Compartment Payload Stacking Carousel:** Located directly below the top frame opening. A rotating carousel with multiple (e.g., 6-8) individual, sealed compartments. Payload is initially deposited onto the carousel.
*   **Compartment Sealing Mechanism:** Each compartment features an automated, airtight seal (magnetic, pneumatic, or motorized clamp). This protects contents from weather and pests.
*   **Internal Weight Sensors:** Each compartment has a weight sensor. This allows the system to track inventory and identify package weight for delivery confirmations.
*   **RFID/Barcode Scanner:** Integrated scanner to identify package contents upon initial receipt. This data is used to direct the payload to the correct compartment.
*   **Automated Compartment Access:** Each compartment has a remotely controlled access door (servo-actuated flap or similar).
*   **External Retrieval Portal:** A secure, weather-sealed portal for user access to retrieve packages from the carousel. Access controlled via app or keypad.
*   **Power/Communication:** Solar powered with battery backup. Wireless communication (WiFi/Cellular) for remote control/monitoring.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  UAV delivers payload to the receiver.
2.  Payload is deposited onto the internal conveyor.
3.  RFID/Barcode is scanned to identify the package.
4.  System calculates optimal compartment assignment.
5.  Conveyor moves payload to designated compartment.
6.  Compartment seals, and weight is recorded.
7.  User requests package retrieval via app.
8.  System opens designated compartment access door.
9.  User retrieves package.
10. System closes and reseals compartment.

**Pseudocode (Compartment Assignment Logic):**

```
function assignCompartment(packageWeight, packageSize, compartmentAvailability):
  //compartmentAvailability is a list of available compartments and their capacities
  bestCompartment = null
  bestScore = -1

  for each compartment in compartmentAvailability:
    //calculate a score based on weight/size fit and current load
    score = (1 - (packageWeight / compartment.maxWeight)) * (1 - (packageSize / compartment.maxVolume))

    if score > bestScore:
      bestScore = score
      bestCompartment = compartment

  return bestCompartment
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with e-commerce platforms for automated delivery scheduling.
*   Compartment temperature control for perishable items.
*   Tamper detection system for high-value packages.
*   Automated notification system for package arrival/departure.
*   Self-cleaning mechanism for the internal conveyor and compartments.
