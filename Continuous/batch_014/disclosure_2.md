**Personalized Content Creation "Challenge" System**

**Core Concept:** Leverage the user sentiment/interest detection outlined in the patent to *actively challenge* users to create content, rather than simply recommending topics. This turns passive recommendation into an interactive experience, gamifying content creation.

**Specs:**

1.  **"Challenge Tier" Assignment:**
    *   Based on user history (existing content, consumption patterns) and identified trending topics, assign each user a "Challenge Tier" (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum). Tier dictates challenge difficulty and potential reward.
    *   Algorithm: `Tier = f(ContentVolume, ContentQuality, TrendAlignment, HistoricalEngagement)` where each parameter is a weighted score.

2.  **Challenge Generation:**
    *   System generates challenges tied to trending topics but with *specific constraints* designed to test user creativity. Examples:
        *   "Write a short story about [Trending Topic]... but it must be from the perspective of a non-human entity."
        *   "Create a tutorial on [Trending Topic]... but limit yourself to only using visual aids (no spoken word)."
        *   "Compose a poem about [Trending Topic]... adhering to a specific rhyme scheme and meter."
    *   Constraints dynamically adjusted based on Challenge Tier. Higher tiers receive more complex/ambiguous prompts.
    *   Pseudocode:

```
function generateChallenge(user, trendingTopics) {
  tier = getUserTier(user);
  topic = selectTrendingTopic(trendingTopics);
  constraint = selectConstraint(tier); // Higher tier = more complex constraint
  challengePrompt = "Create content about " + topic + " with the following constraint: " + constraint;
  return challengePrompt;
}
```

3.  **"Creative Spark" Feature:**
    *   System provides users with *random* elements (character traits, settings, plot twists) to incorporate into their challenge response. These "sparks" are designed to break creative blocks and encourage unexpected content.
    *   Example: "Incorporate a malfunctioning robot into your story about [Trending Topic]."
    *   Pseudocode:

```
function getCreativeSpark() {
  sparkList = ["A talking animal", "A hidden treasure", "A time travel paradox", "A secret identity"];
  randomIndex = random.nextInt(sparkList.length);
  return sparkList[randomIndex];
}
```

4.  **Community Evaluation & Reward System:**
    *   Users submit their challenge responses.
    *   Other users evaluate submissions based on criteria like creativity, adherence to constraints, and overall quality.
    *   Rewards include:
        *   “Challenge Points” – contribute to tier advancement.
        *   “Badges” – awarded for specific achievements (e.g., “Master of Constraints,” “Trendsetter”).
        *   Increased visibility – Top submissions featured on a dedicated “Challenge Showcase” page.

5.  **Sentiment-Driven Dynamic Difficulty:**
    *   System monitors user engagement with challenges (submission rate, evaluation activity).
    *   If user consistently excels at challenges, the system *increases* the difficulty of generated prompts and constraints.
    *   If user struggles, the system *reduces* difficulty to maintain motivation.

6.  **"Co-Creation" Mode:**
    *   Allow users to *collaboratively* respond to challenges.
    *   System facilitates real-time co-editing and brainstorming.
    *   Reward shared contributions proportionally.
