## Dynamic Workspace Zoning with Predictive AGV Rerouting

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the concept of AGV slowdown/stop signals by introducing *dynamic workspace zoning* based on predictive modeling of human movement and potential collision probabilities. It’s less about reacting to a presence and more about anticipating it.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Human Movement Prediction Engine (HMPE):** Utilizes computer vision (cameras, depth sensors) and potentially wearable sensor data (optional, for higher accuracy) to predict probable paths of human workers within the workspace. This engine doesn’t just track *where* someone is, but *where they are likely to be in the next X seconds*.  This prediction builds a probabilistic heatmap of worker presence, continuously updated.
2.  **Collision Probability Calculator (CPC):** Takes the HMPE output and AGV path data as input. Calculates a real-time collision probability score between each AGV and predicted worker locations. This isn’t a binary “safe/unsafe” but a continuous probability score (0.0 – 1.0).
3.  **Dynamic Zone Generator (DZG):** Based on the CPC output, the DZG creates temporary, dynamically resizing “zones” within the workspace.  These aren’t fixed barriers, but software-defined areas influencing AGV behavior. Zones have levels:
    *   **Green Zone (Probability < 0.1):** Normal AGV operation.
    *   **Yellow Zone (0.1 <= Probability < 0.5):**  AGV speed reduced by 25-50%. Audible warning signal activated on the AGV.
    *   **Red Zone (Probability >= 0.5):** AGV speed reduced to crawl or stopped. Visual and audible alerts intensified.  AGV attempts to reroute automatically.
4.  **Central Management System (CMS):**  Integrates the HMPE, CPC, DZG, and AGV fleet control. Manages AGV rerouting, zone definitions, and safety protocols.  Provides a visual overview of workspace safety status.
5.  **AGV Software Modification:** AGVs need updated software to receive and interpret dynamic zone information and adjust speed/path accordingly.

**Pseudocode (AGV-Side):**

```
// Inside AGV Main Loop

Receive Zone Data from CMS (ZoneID, ZoneLevel, ZoneCoordinates)

If ZoneID is within AGV's Path:

    If ZoneLevel == "Green":
        Maintain Normal Speed

    Else If ZoneLevel == "Yellow":
        Reduce Speed by 25-50%
        Activate Audible Warning Signal

    Else If ZoneLevel == "Red":
        Reduce Speed to Crawl/Stop
        Activate Visual/Audible Alerts
        Request New Path from CMS (indicating collision risk)

    Else: //Zone outside AGV radius
        Continue Normal Operation

//Process Path Request from CMS
newPath = CMS.CalculateReroute(CurrentPosition, Destination, ObstacleZone)

If newPath != null:
    Update AGV Path with newPath
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensors:** Multiple wide-angle RGB-D cameras strategically placed throughout the workspace. Optional: UWB or Bluetooth beacons for enhanced worker tracking accuracy.
*   **Communication:** Wireless network (Wi-Fi 6 or 5G) for real-time data transmission between sensors, CMS, and AGVs.
*   **Processing Power:** CMS requires high-performance servers with GPUs for real-time image processing and path planning.  AGVs require onboard processors capable of handling zone data and rerouting calculations.
*   **Software:** Custom software for HMPE, CPC, DZG, CMS, and AGV control. Integration with existing warehouse management systems (WMS).
*   **Safety Features:** Redundant sensors and fail-safe mechanisms to prevent collisions. Emergency stop buttons on AGVs and in the workspace. Regular system diagnostics and maintenance.
