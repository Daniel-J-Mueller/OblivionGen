## Predictive Failure Mode Integration

**System Overview:**

The core concept is to extend the real-time log and event analysis system to *predict* potential failure modes before they manifest as errors in the logs. This is achieved by integrating data from synthetic testing, chaos engineering, and simulation environments into the existing platform, allowing correlation with live system data.

**Components:**

1.  **Synthetic Test/Chaos Engine Interface:**
    *   API endpoint accepting test execution data. Data includes: test case ID, input parameters, expected outcome, simulated load, injected faults (e.g., network latency, process kill).
    *   Data format: JSON, structured for easy parsing and indexing. Example:

    ```json
    {
      "test_id": "deploy_v2.3_highload",
      "timestamp": "2024-10-27T10:00:00Z",
      "parameters": {
        "concurrent_users": 1000,
        "request_rate": 500
      },
      "injected_faults": [
        {"type": "network_latency", "duration": 2, "value": 200},
        {"type": "cpu_hog", "process": "api_server", "duration": 1}
      ],
      "expected_outcome": "success",
      "actual_outcome": "failure",
      "failure_details": "500 error on /users endpoint"
    }
    ```
2.  **Simulation Data Ingestion:**
    *   Accepts data from discrete event simulations (e.g., modeling database contention, queue overflow).
    *   Data includes: simulation parameters, events within the simulation, predicted resource utilization.
    *   Data format: Time-series data with associated metadata.
3.  **Correlation Engine:**
    *   Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, Bayesian networks) to identify correlations between:
        *   Synthetic/Simulation data
        *   Live log data
        *   Event data
    *   Algorithms trained on historical data to predict potential failure modes based on current system state and simulated scenarios.
4.  **Failure Mode Database:**
    *   Stores identified failure modes, associated triggers (e.g., specific log patterns, event sequences, simulation results), and recommended mitigation actions.
5.  **Proactive Alerting:**
    *   Generates alerts *before* failures occur, based on predicted failure modes and confidence levels.
    *   Alerts include: predicted failure mode, probability of occurrence, recommended mitigation actions, and supporting data (e.g., simulation results, log excerpts).

**Workflow:**

1.  Chaos/Synthetic tests and simulations run continuously or on a schedule.
2.  Data from these sources is ingested into the Correlation Engine.
3.  The Correlation Engine analyzes the data and identifies potential failure modes.
4.  Identified failure modes are stored in the Failure Mode Database.
5.  The system continuously monitors live log and event data.
6.  When the system detects patterns that indicate a potential failure mode, it generates a proactive alert.
7.  Alerts are presented through the existing UI, providing users with actionable insights to prevent failures.

**UI Enhancements:**

*   **"Predictive Analysis" Dashboard:** Displays potential failure modes, associated probabilities, and recommended mitigation actions.
*   **"Simulation Playback" Feature:** Allows users to visualize simulation results alongside live system data, facilitating root cause analysis.
*   **"What-If" Analysis:** Enables users to explore the impact of different system configurations and workloads on potential failure modes.
