## Adaptive Acoustic Camouflage - Project "Mimic"

**Core Concept:** Integrate the wireless speaker/range extender functionality *into* a dynamically reconfigurable surface capable of acoustic and visual camouflage. Think "active wallpaper" or modular wall panels.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** 20cm x 20cm x 5cm (target – adaptable, modular design)
*   **Material:** Primarily flexible OLED display material layered over a matrix of micro-speakers and micro-actuators. Backed by a sound-dampening/isolating layer.
*   **Speaker Array:** 64 micro-speakers per module (8x8 grid). Each speaker individually addressable with dynamic EQ and volume control. Frequency response: 20Hz-20kHz.
*   **Actuator Array:** 64 micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) per module, controlling subtle surface deformations for both visual and acoustic manipulation. Actuation range: 0-5mm.
*   **Connectivity:** Wireless (Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3) for audio streaming, range extending, and module-to-module communication. Power over Ethernet (PoE) optional.
*   **Power Consumption:** Max 20W per module.
*   **Processing:** Each module contains a dedicated ARM Cortex-A72 processor for local audio processing, visual rendering, and communication with neighboring modules.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Environmental Scanning:** Integrated microphone array for ambient sound analysis. Camera for visual scene capture.
    *   **Acoustic Camouflage Algorithm:** Algorithm that analyzes ambient sound and *reproduces* it through the speaker array, effectively “canceling out” the sound signature of the module itself. Also capable of *redirecting* sound – projecting sound *around* the module as if it isn't there.
    *   **Visual Camouflage Algorithm:** Algorithm that captures the visual scene behind the module and displays it on the OLED surface. Utilizes parallax correction to maintain the illusion of transparency from different viewing angles.
    *   **Mesh Networking:** Modules communicate with each other to create a larger, seamless camouflage surface.
    *   **User Interface:** Mobile app for controlling camouflage patterns, audio playback, range extender settings, and module grouping.
*   **Range Extender Functionality:** Integrates standard 802.11ax range extender technology alongside the camouflage features. Signal strength and coverage managed through the mobile app.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Transparent Mode:** Module mimics the visual and auditory environment behind it.
2.  **Pattern Mode:** Displays user-defined patterns or images on the surface.
3.  **Audio Projection Mode:** Redirects sound around the module.
4.  **Range Extender Mode:** Functions as a standard Wi-Fi range extender.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Home entertainment (invisible speakers)
*   Architectural acoustics (dynamic sound control)
*   Security and surveillance (camouflaged monitoring devices)
*   Art installations
*   Concealment
