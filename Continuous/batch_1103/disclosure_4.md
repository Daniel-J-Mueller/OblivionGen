## Adaptive Credential 'Shadowing' with Dynamic Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the idea of contextual credential injection to include a ‘shadow’ credential dynamically built and applied *alongside* the primary credential. This shadow credential isn’t directly visible to the user or application, but modulates access based on real-time reputation scoring derived from multiple sources.

**Specs:**

1.  **Reputation Sources:**
    *   Device Trust (hardware/software integrity, jailbreak detection) - Score 0-100
    *   Network Context (IP reputation, geolocation anomalies, VPN detection) - Score 0-100
    *   Behavioral Biometrics (keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns) - Score 0-100
    *   Social Signals (linked accounts, activity on trusted platforms – optional, user consent required) - Score 0-100
    *   Threat Intelligence Feeds (known malicious IPs, botnet activity) - Score 0-100

2.  **Shadow Credential Construction:**
    *   A lightweight policy engine resides on the authentication server.
    *   Upon authentication request, the engine gathers data from Reputation Sources.
    *   A weighted average is calculated to derive an overall ‘Trust Score’ (0-100).
    *   The Trust Score dynamically shapes a shadow credential containing:
        *   **Time-Based Access Restrictions:** Lower Trust Score = shorter session duration.
        *   **Feature-Gated Access:**  Lower Trust Score = access to sensitive features disabled.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Trigger:** Trust Score below a threshold automatically triggers MFA challenge.
        *   **Transaction Velocity Limits:** Lower Trust Score = reduced limits on transaction amounts or API calls.

3.  **Credential Combination:**
    *   The primary credential (existing user/password or other authentication factor) is *combined* with the dynamically generated shadow credential using a boolean AND operation.
    *   Access is granted *only if* both credentials authorize the action.
    *   The shadow credential is ephemeral and doesn’t persist beyond the session.

4.  **API Specifications:**
    *   `GET /trust_score`: Returns the current Trust Score for a given user/session ID. (For auditing/monitoring).
    *   `POST /shadow_credential`:  Accepts a primary credential and returns a combined, shadow-augmented credential. (Internal API call).
    *   `POST /risk_signal`: Allows external systems (e.g., fraud detection) to submit risk signals that influence the Trust Score.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Flow):**

```
function authenticate(user_id, password) {
  primary_credential = verify_credentials(user_id, password);

  if (primary_credential == null) {
    return "Authentication Failed";
  }

  trust_score = calculate_trust_score(user_id);
  shadow_credential = generate_shadow_credential(trust_score);

  combined_credential = apply_boolean_and(primary_credential, shadow_credential);

  if (combined_credential.is_valid()) {
    create_session(user_id, combined_credential);
    return "Authentication Successful";
  } else {
    return "Authentication Failed - Shadow Credential Denied Access";
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Adaptive access control for high-value applications.
*   Fraud prevention in online banking and e-commerce.
*   Real-time risk assessment for API access.
*   Dynamic security policies based on user behavior and device health.
