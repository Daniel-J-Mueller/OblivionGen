## Dynamic Policy Inheritance via Graph Neural Networks

**Concept:** Extend the existing policy evaluation system to leverage a graph neural network (GNN) to dynamically infer policy inheritance and permissions based on the relationships between services involved in a request chain. This allows for granular, context-aware authorization exceeding static policy definitions.

**Specification:**

**1. Graph Construction:**

*   **Nodes:** Represent computing resource services (first, second, third, etc.) and customer profiles.
*   **Edges:**
    *   *Invocation Edges:* Directed edges representing a service invoking another.  These are dynamically captured during request processing (e.g., service A calls service B, creating an edge A->B).
    *   *Ownership Edges:* Connect a customer profile to services they directly control or have administrative access to.
    *   *Policy Association Edges:* Connect policies to the services they apply to.
    *   *Inheritance Edges:*  Dynamically generated edges indicating potential policy inheritance, initially seeded based on known relationships (e.g., a service inherits permissions from its parent service).
*   **Node Features:**
    *   Service Type (e.g., API Gateway, Database, Authentication Service).
    *   Service Metadata (e.g., tags, version).
    *   Customer Profile Attributes (e.g., role, subscription level).
    *   Policy Attributes (e.g., access control rules, data masking rules).
*   **Edge Features:**
    *   Invocation Type (e.g., synchronous, asynchronous).
    *   Data Flow (e.g., request size, response size).
    *   Invocation Success/Failure Rate.

**2. GNN Architecture:**

*   **Model:** Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) or Graph Attention Network (GAT).  GAT is preferred for its ability to weight the importance of different neighboring services.
*   **Layers:** Multiple layers of GCN/GAT to allow for multi-hop propagation of information.
*   **Embedding Layer:**  Embeddings for node and edge features.
*   **Output Layer:**  A classification layer that predicts the permission level (e.g., allow, deny, partial access) for the current request.

**3. Policy Inference Process:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** A customer request triggers a series of service invocations.
2.  **Graph Construction:** As each service is invoked, the graph is dynamically updated with new invocation edges.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** Node and edge features are extracted based on the current state of the graph and the request context.
4.  **GNN Inference:** The GNN processes the graph and generates a permission score for the request.
5.  **Policy Enforcement:** The system compares the permission score to a predefined threshold and enforces the corresponding policy (allow, deny, partial access).
6.  **Model Training**: The model is periodically retrained based on audit logs and policy updates.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```python
def evaluate_request(request, graph, gnn_model):
  # Update graph with current service invocation
  graph.add_invocation(request.source_service, request.destination_service)

  # Extract node and edge features
  node_features, edge_features = graph.extract_features()

  # Run GNN inference
  permission_score = gnn_model.predict(node_features, edge_features)

  # Enforce policy
  if permission_score > threshold:
    allow_request(request)
  else:
    deny_request(request)

def train_gnn_model(audit_logs, gnn_model):
  # Prepare training data from audit logs
  training_data = prepare_training_data(audit_logs)
  # Train GNN model
  gnn_model.train(training_data)
  return gnn_model
```

**5.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** Use graph partitioning and distributed GNN inference to handle large-scale deployments.
*   **Explainability:**  Provide mechanisms to explain the GNNâ€™s decision-making process (e.g., using attention weights).
*   **Security:**  Protect the GNN model from adversarial attacks.
*   **Dynamic Policy Updates:** Implement a mechanism to seamlessly integrate new policies into the GNN model.
*    **Integration with Existing Policy Engine:** Design the GNN as a complementary layer to the existing policy evaluation system, allowing for hybrid policy enforcement.
