## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Portable Displays

**System Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Portable Display Unit (PDU) – As described in the provided patent, transparent/semi-transparent, wirelessly powered/communicating.
    *   Haptic Actuator Array – Integrated into the PDU’s frame or adhered to the display surface.  Utilizes micro-electrostatic or piezoelectric elements for precise localized vibration. Resolution: 50 actuators/inch².
    *   Proximity/Touch Sensor Array – Overlaid on or integrated with the haptic array. Detects user proximity and touch with <1ms latency.
    *   Primary Station(s) – Existing infrastructure as per the patent.
    *   Biofeedback Sensor (Optional) - Integrated into the PDU frame or worn as a separate device (e.g., smart glasses frame). Measures physiological data (heart rate variability, skin conductance) for adaptive feedback.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Existing wireless protocol (patent-defined) augmented with a dedicated channel for haptic control data. Low latency (<5ms) is critical.
*   **Power Requirements:**  Integrated with existing wireless power system. Haptic array optimized for low power consumption.

**Functional Description:**

This system layers localized haptic feedback onto the existing remote display technology.  The goal is to enhance user experience, provide subtle notifications, and enable novel interaction methods.

1.  **Contextual Haptics:** The primary station analyzes data being displayed on the PDU and generates haptic patterns.
    *   Example: A map application might provide a gentle pulsing vibration as the user approaches a turn.
    *   Example: A stock market display could provide a varying vibration intensity corresponding to price fluctuations.
2.  **Proximity-Based Haptics:** As the user’s hand approaches the PDU, the system activates a subtle haptic “attraction” effect. This could be a gently increasing vibration, or a localized “ripple” effect.
3.  **Edge Highlighting:** When the user glances at or approaches the edge of the display, the system activates haptic feedback along that edge. This provides a clear indication of the display boundaries, especially with a transparent display.
4.  **Bioadaptive Feedback:** (Requires Biofeedback Sensor) The system monitors the user’s physiological state and adjusts the haptic feedback accordingly.
    *   Example: If the user is detected to be stressed, the system reduces the intensity of haptic feedback or switches to a calming vibration pattern.
    *   Example: If the user is detected to be drowsy, the system provides a more pronounced vibration to help maintain alertness.
5.  **Gestural Control:** The proximity/touch sensor array enables simple gestural control of displayed content.
    *   Example: A swipe gesture on the PDU could be used to scroll through a list or switch between applications.
    *   Example: A tap gesture could be used to select an item or activate a function.

**Pseudocode (Primary Station - Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateHapticPattern(data_type, data_value, user_state)
  IF data_type == "MAP" THEN
    IF data_value == "TURN_APPROACHING" THEN
      RETURN PulsingVibration(intensity = data_value.distance, frequency = 2Hz)
    ELSE
      RETURN NoVibration()
    ENDIF
  ELSE IF data_type == "STOCK_MARKET" THEN
    RETURN VaryingIntensityVibration(intensity = data_value.price_change, frequency = 5Hz)
  ELSE IF user_state == "STRESSED" THEN
    RETURN CalmingVibration(intensity = 0.2, frequency = 1Hz)
  ELSE
    RETURN NoVibration()
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Engineering Notes:**

*   Minimizing actuator weight and power consumption is critical.
*   Careful selection of vibration frequencies and amplitudes is needed to avoid user fatigue or distraction.
*   Software algorithms will need to be developed to map data types and values to appropriate haptic patterns.
*   Integration with existing wireless communication protocols must be seamless.
