## Dynamic Content "Echo" & Predictive Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the existing dynamic content selection system by introducing a user-specific "content echo" profile and a predictive prioritization algorithm. This allows the system to not only select effective modules based on aggregate data, but also *learn* a user's evolving preferences and proactively adjust module priorities *before* a displayable file is fully requested.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Echo Profile (CEP):**

*   **Data Storage:** Each user will have a CEP stored server-side. This profile isn’t simply a history of clicks; it's a weighted distribution of “content characteristics.”
*   **Characteristic Extraction:**  When a user interacts with displayed content (click, purchase, dwell time), the content is analyzed to extract a vector of characteristics.  These can be tags, categories, sentiment scores, visual features (color palettes, object detection), or any other measurable attribute.
*   **Weighting:**  Interaction strength (purchase > click > dwell time) and recency will influence the weight assigned to each characteristic in the CEP. A decay function ensures older interactions have less influence.
*   **CEP Update:**  The CEP is updated in real-time with each interaction.
*   **Privacy:**  CEP data will be anonymized and aggregated where possible. Users will have control over their data and the ability to opt-out.

**2. Predictive Prioritization Algorithm (PPA):**

*   **Input:** User ID (to access CEP), Request Context (e.g., webpage URL, time of day, location), and Module Metadata (characteristics of each available code module).
*   **Similarity Calculation:** PPA calculates the similarity between the user's CEP and the characteristics of each code module.  Cosine similarity or other appropriate metrics can be used.
*   **Priority Adjustment:**  The base module priority (as determined by the original patent) is adjusted based on the similarity score.  Higher similarity = higher priority. A scaling factor controls the strength of the adjustment.
*   **Contextual Weighting:** The request context can also influence the priority adjustment. For example, a "sale" context might boost modules promoting discounted items.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Priority is recalculated *before* each portion of the displayable file is generated, allowing for continuous optimization.

**3. Implementation Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION generateDisplayableFile(userID, requestContext):
    // Fetch User’s Content Echo Profile
    cep = fetchCEP(userID)

    // Fetch Available Code Modules
    modules = fetchModules()

    // Calculate Adjusted Priorities for each Module
    FOR module IN modules:
        similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(cep, module.characteristics)
        module.adjustedPriority = module.basePriority + (similarityScore * priorityScalingFactor)
        //Apply contextual weighting
        module.adjustedPriority = module.adjustedPriority + (contextWeighting * contextScore)

    // Sort Modules by Adjusted Priority
    sortedModules = sortModules(modules)

    //Select and Execute Modules for each Portion
    FOR portion IN displayableFile.portions:
        selectedModule = selectHighestPriorityModule(sortedModules, portion.priority)
        portion.content = executeModule(selectedModule)

    RETURN displayableFile
```

**4.  System Components:**

*   **CEP Manager:** Responsible for storing, updating, and retrieving CEPs.
*   **Similarity Engine:**  Calculates the similarity between CEPs and module characteristics.
*   **Priority Calculator:** Applies contextual weighting and calculates adjusted module priorities.
*   **Module Executor:** Executes selected modules and generates content.
