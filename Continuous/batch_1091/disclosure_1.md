## Dynamic Content Tagging & Re-Composition

**Concept:** Extend the header/footer identification beyond simple spatial reasoning (top/bottom of page, whitespace) to *semantic* content tagging, then actively recompose the document for optimized reflow *based* on those tags.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Tagging Engine:**

*   **Input:** Digital image (raster or vector), pre-processed OCR data (text extraction).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Baseline Header/Footer Detection:** Employ the existing whitespace/positioning logic (from the patent) as a first pass.
    *   **Semantic Analysis:** Utilize a lightweight NLP model (trained on a corpus of document types - legal, scientific, narrative, etc.) to analyze the extracted text. This model will assign probabilities to content belonging to specific categories:
        *   *Title/Subtitle*
        *   *Section Header (Level 1-3)*
        *   *Page Number*
        *   *Footnote/Endnote*
        *   *Figure/Table Caption*
        *   *Abstract/Summary*
        *   *Keyword List*
        *   *Citation/Reference*
        *   *Disclaimer/Copyright Notice*
        *   *Other (Unclassified)*
    *   **Confidence Scoring:**  Each identified block of text will receive a confidence score for each category, based on the NLP model's output and the results of the baseline spatial analysis.
    *   **Dynamic Tagging:**  Tags are assigned based on the highest confidence score *and* a threshold. Content below the threshold remains untagged.
*   **Output:**  Digital image with associated metadata – tagged content blocks, confidence scores, spatial coordinates.

**2. Reflow Re-Composition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Tagged digital image.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Reflow Prioritization:**  Based on the tags, prioritize content for reflow:
        *   *Core Text (paragraphs, etc.):* Highest priority – reflow naturally.
        *   *Section Headers:*  Re-insert as appropriate headings within the reflowed text, adjusting level based on the original header level.
        *   *Figure/Table Captions:*  Place captions *directly* after the corresponding figure/table in the reflowed text.
        *   *Footnotes/Endnotes:*  Attach footnotes to the appropriate point in the reflowed text.  Endnotes are accumulated at the end of the document.
        *   *Page Numbers/Headers/Footers:*  These elements are *removed* from the main content flow, as they are remnants of the original page layout. A new mechanism for page numbering is implemented *within* the reflowed document.
    *   **Content Adaptation:**
        *   **Image Handling:** Images are extracted and re-positioned within the reflowed text based on surrounding content.
        *   **Table Handling:** Tables are either reflowed (if possible) or treated as images.
    *   **Dynamic Formatting:** Apply a consistent style sheet to the reflowed content.
*   **Output:** Reflowed digital content file (e.g., .docx, .epub, .txt).

**Pseudocode (Reflow Re-Composition Engine - simplified):**

```
function reflowDocument(taggedDocument):
  reflowedContent = []
  for block in taggedDocument.contentBlocks:
    if block.tag == "SectionHeader":
      reflowedContent.append(createHeading(block.text, block.headerLevel))
    elif block.tag == "Paragraph":
      reflowedContent.append(createParagraph(block.text))
    elif block.tag == "FigureCaption":
      previousBlock = reflowedContent.last()
      if previousBlock.type == "Figure":
        previousBlock.caption = block.text
      else:
        reflowedContent.append(block.text) # If no figure
    elif block.tag == "Footnote":
      currentParagraph = reflowedContent.last()
      currentParagraph.addFootnote(block.text)
    else:
      reflowedContent.append(block.text) # Unrecognized/Untagged content

  return createDigitalFile(reflowedContent)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define custom tags and reflow rules.
*   **AI-Driven Content Understanding:**  Integrate a more advanced AI model to *understand* the semantic meaning of the content and automatically adjust the reflow process accordingly.
*    **Multilingual Support**: Extend the NLP model to support multiple languages.
