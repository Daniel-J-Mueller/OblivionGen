## Dynamic Fluidic Lensing Array

**Concept:** Utilizing the electrowetting principle, construct an array of micro-lenses where the focal length is dynamically adjusted by controlling the surface tension and resultant curvature of the first fluid. This creates a tunable optical system *without* traditional mechanical focusing.

**Specs:**

*   **Electrowetting Element:** Individual elements are spherical micro-reservoirs (diameter: 50-500 μm) filled with immiscible fluids. First fluid: conductive, low viscosity oil. Second fluid: deionized water with surfactant.
*   **Electrode Configuration:** Each micro-reservoir has a patterned ITO electrode on the interior surface, segmented into multiple concentric rings. These rings act as individual control zones for surface tension.
*   **Driving Scheme:** A control system applies varying voltages to each electrode ring. This creates localized surface tension gradients, distorting the interface between the fluids and altering the curvature of the first fluid’s exposed surface – creating a lens.
*   **Array Architecture:** Micro-reservoirs are arranged in a two-dimensional grid (e.g., 100x100). Each reservoir functions as an individual lens element.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Desired focal length map for the array (image plane coordinates to focal length per element).
    *   Process:
        1.  Calculate voltage levels for each electrode ring within each reservoir to achieve the corresponding focal length.
        2.  Apply calculated voltages via a multiplexed driver circuit.
        3.  Monitor fluidic response using embedded capacitance sensors within each reservoir (feedback loop for calibration and correction).
    *   Output: Voltage map for the entire array.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Substrate: Glass or flexible polymer.
    *   Electrodes: ITO or other transparent conductive material.
    *   Fluids: Optimized for low hysteresis and fast response times.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrated micro-capacitance sensors within each element to accurately measure fluid curvature and provide feedback to the control system, allowing for precise focal length adjustment and correction of drift.
*   **Pseudocode (Control Algorithm - Single Element):**

```
function adjustFocalLength(targetFocalLength, currentFluidCurvature) {
  // Calculate voltage adjustment based on desired and current focal length
  voltageAdjustment = (targetFocalLength - currentFocalLength) * gain;

  // Limit voltage to safe operating range
  voltage = saturate(voltage + voltageAdjustment, minVoltage, maxVoltage);

  // Apply voltage to electrode rings (segment control)
  applyVoltageToRings(voltage, segmentMap);

  // Read capacitance sensor for feedback
  currentFluidCurvature = readCapacitanceSensor();

  return currentFluidCurvature;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Adaptive optics for microscopy and astronomy.
*   Variable focus lenses for cameras and mobile devices.
*   Dynamic beam steering for LiDAR and other sensing applications.
*   Holographic displays.
