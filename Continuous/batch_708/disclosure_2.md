## Dynamic Foveated Streaming with Predictive Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the scalable video coding approach by integrating real-time scene reconstruction driven by user gaze and predictive rendering. Instead of simply prioritizing views, *reconstruct* a high-fidelity scene around the userâ€™s gaze point using sparse data initially, and progressively refine it as more data streams in.

**Specs:**

**1. Gaze Tracking & Prediction Module:**
   *   **Input:** Headset orientation, eye tracking data (pupil position, gaze direction).
   *   **Processing:** Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm to estimate future gaze position. Account for saccadic movements (rapid, jerky eye movements) and fixations.
   *   **Output:** Predicted gaze point (3D coordinates) with associated confidence level. Predicted gaze *trajectory* for the next 100-200ms.

**2. Sparse View Streaming & Reconstruction Engine:**
   *   **Initial Stream:** Begin by transmitting a *very* low-resolution, sparse set of base layer views covering a wide field of view. These are optimized for initial spatial orientation.
   *   **View Selection:**  Prioritize view selection *not* based on probability of viewing, but based on their contribution to reconstructing the volume surrounding the predicted gaze point.
   *   **Reconstruction:** Employ a novel voxel-based reconstruction algorithm. Voxel density dynamically adapts based on distance from the predicted gaze point and data availability. Higher density = higher fidelity. 
   *   **Intermediate View Synthesis:** Synthesize intermediate views using view interpolation techniques to fill gaps in the received data. This reduces bandwidth requirements.

**3. Enhancement Layer Prioritization:**
   *   **Quality Metrics:**  Instead of simply streaming enhancement layers, assess the *perceptual impact* of each enhancement layer. Metrics include sharpness, color accuracy, and detail level.
   *   **Adaptive Streaming:** Prioritize enhancement layers that have the greatest perceptual impact *around the predicted gaze point*. Lower priority is given to layers affecting peripheral vision.
   *  **Temporal Enhancement Prioritization:** Prioritize temporal enhancement layers for areas exhibiting predicted motion. 

**4. Predictive Rendering Module:**
   *  **Motion Prediction:**  Using historical gaze data, predict the user's head and eye movements.
   *  **Pre-Rendering:** Pre-render portions of the scene likely to fall within the user's gaze in the near future. This minimizes latency and improves perceived responsiveness. Store pre-rendered frames in a GPU cache.
   *  **Seamless Transition:**  Seamlessly transition between pre-rendered frames and newly streamed/reconstructed frames.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (streaming) {
  // 1. Get Gaze Data & Predict Future Gaze
  gazeData = GetGazeData();
  predictedGaze = PredictFutureGaze(gazeData);

  // 2. Select Views for Streaming (Prioritize Reconstruction Volume)
  viewsToStream = SelectViewsForReconstruction(predictedGaze);

  // 3. Request Enhancement Layers (Prioritize Perceptual Impact)
  enhancementLayers = SelectEnhancementLayers(viewsToStream, predictedGaze);

  // 4. Stream Data
  StreamData(viewsToStream, enhancementLayers);

  // 5. Reconstruct Scene
  reconstructedScene = ReconstructScene(receivedData, predictedGaze);

  // 6. Render & Display (Use Pre-rendered Frames if Available)
  renderedFrame = RenderFrame(reconstructedScene, preRenderedFrames);
  DisplayFrame(renderedFrame);
}
```
