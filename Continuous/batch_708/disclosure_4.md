# D873321

## Modular Environmental Sensor Array – “Chameleon”

**Concept:** A security camera integrated with a dynamically configurable array of environmental sensors, forming a localized ‘digital twin’ of its surroundings. The camera itself is secondary – the *data* it enables is the primary function.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Core Unit:** Existing security camera form factor (D873321 is acceptable as a base) with standard video output (USB, Ethernet).
*   **Modular Sensor Pods:** Small, magnetically attaching pods, each containing a single sensor type.  Standardized connector interface (6-pin, low voltage power & data).
*   **Sensor Suite (Example - expandable):**
    *   Air Quality Sensor (VOC, CO2, particulate matter)
    *   Temperature/Humidity Sensor (High precision)
    *   Light Spectrum Analyzer (Full spectrum, including UV/IR)
    *   Microphone Array (Directional audio capture)
    *   Motion Sensor (Millimeter wave radar, for precise movement tracking, independent of visual field)
    *   Geiger Counter (Low-level radiation detection)
    *   Gas Leak Detector (Methane, Propane, etc.)
    *   Barometric Pressure Sensor
*   **Magnetic Mounting System:**  High-strength neodymium magnets embedded in both camera housing *and* sensor pods. Allows for rapid configuration and repositioning.  Pods should be able to mount on *any* exposed surface of the camera.
*   **Power/Data Bus:** Low-voltage (5V) power and data bus running through the camera housing, accessible via the magnetic connectors.  Data transmission via I2C or SPI.
*   **Processing Unit:** Onboard microcontroller (ESP32 or similar) for sensor data acquisition, pre-processing, and transmission.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac), Bluetooth 5.0.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Dynamic Sensor Configuration:** Software interface (web/mobile app) to define which sensors are active and their data logging frequency.
*   **Data Fusion:** Algorithm to combine data from multiple sensors to create a comprehensive environmental profile.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** AI-powered algorithm to identify unusual environmental conditions (e.g., sudden gas leak, unexpected temperature spike).
*   **3D Environmental Mapping:**  Utilize sensor data (temperature gradients, air flow, radiation levels) to create a 3D representation of the surrounding environment.
*   **API Access:** Open API for integration with other smart home/security systems.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  User magnetically attaches desired sensor pods to the camera housing.
2.  Software automatically detects attached sensors.
3.  User configures sensor parameters (logging frequency, thresholds for anomaly detection).
4.  Camera streams video *and* sensor data to a central server/local storage.
5.  AI algorithms analyze data to identify anomalies and generate environmental maps.
6.  User receives alerts via mobile app or other communication channels.
