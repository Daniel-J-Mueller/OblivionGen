## Adaptive Query Shaping via Learned Transaction Embeddings

**Concept:** The patent focuses on restricting queries to improve consistency. This adaptation proposes proactively *shaping* queries based on learned embeddings of past transactions, predicting potential conflicts *before* they occur and optimizing the query for minimal contention. It moves beyond static restrictions to dynamic, predictive optimization.

**Specs:**

**1. Transaction Embedding Generator:**

*   **Input:** Historical transaction logs (read/write sets, timestamps, data store identifiers).
*   **Process:**
    *   Represent each transaction as a vector of feature flags. Features include:
        *   Data store accessed (one-hot encoded).
        *   Operation type (read/write, create, delete).
        *   Data object type.
        *   Attributes accessed/modified (encoded using a vocabulary).
    *   Train a deep neural network (e.g., a Transformer or Recurrent Neural Network) to generate a low-dimensional embedding vector for each transaction. The loss function prioritizes grouping similar transactions (based on contention history) closer in the embedding space.
    *   Maintain a rolling window of recent transactions to continuously update the embedding model.
*   **Output:** A trained model capable of generating embedding vectors for new transactions.

**2. Query Prediction & Shaping Module:**

*   **Input:** A proposed transaction (read/write sets).
*   **Process:**
    *   Generate an embedding vector for the proposed transaction using the trained model.
    *   Query a similarity index (e.g., FAISS, Annoy) to find *k* nearest neighbors in the embedding space. These neighbors represent transactions with similar access patterns.
    *   Analyze the contention history of the nearest neighbor transactions. Identify data stores or attributes that were frequently involved in conflicts.
    *   Dynamically rewrite the proposed transactionâ€™s query. Prioritize filtering by attributes known to cause contention. Introduce pre-filtering steps to reduce the amount of data scanned. The goal is to minimize overlap with conflicting transactions.
    *   Optionally, rewrite the query to favor read-only operations if contention is predicted.
*   **Output:** A modified query optimized for minimal contention.

**3. Conflict Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor actual transaction conflicts during runtime.
    *   Use this data to refine the transaction embedding model and the query shaping heuristics. Reinforcement learning could be used to optimize the shaping process.
    *   Adjust the weighting of different features in the embedding model based on their correlation with contention.

**Pseudocode (Query Shaping Module):**

```
function shape_query(transaction):
  embedding = generate_embedding(transaction)
  neighbors = find_k_nearest_neighbors(embedding, k=5)
  contention_data = analyze_contention(neighbors) // returns list of problematic data stores/attributes
  modified_query = transaction.query
  
  for store, attribute in contention_data:
    if attribute in modified_query.filters:
      // prioritize filtering by this attribute
    else:
      modified_query.add_filter(store, attribute) // add filter to query
  
  return modified_query
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for training and maintaining the embedding model. GPU acceleration is recommended.
*   The similarity index should be optimized for low-latency lookups.
*   Integration with the existing journal manager is crucial for collecting contention data.
*   Requires a robust mechanism for handling potential query rewriting failures.
*   Data pipelines must be optimized to handle the increased data volume (historical logs, embedding vectors).
