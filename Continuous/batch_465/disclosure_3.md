## Personalized Ambient Lighting & Haptic Feedback Profiles

**Core Concept:** Expand user profile customization beyond audio output and visual indicators to include synchronized ambient lighting and localized haptic feedback, creating a fully immersive and personalized experience tied to user profiles and message/intent recognition.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Smart Speakers/Hubs: Integrated multi-color, multi-zone LED arrays capable of dynamic color and brightness control. These LEDs are *not* limited to the device itself; the system supports external, wirelessly connected smart lights (bulbs, strips, panels) throughout the user's environment (home, office).
    *   Haptic Transducers: Small, localized haptic transducers (vibration motors, tactile actuators) embedded in common household objects (sofa arms, desk surfaces, chair backs, doormats). These are wirelessly connected to the central hub.
    *   User Wearables (Optional): Smartwatches/bands with integrated haptic feedback capabilities for more direct, personal notification/experience enhancement.
*   **Software/Logic:**
    *   User Profile Management: Expanded user profile settings to include:
        *   Ambient Lighting Theme: User-definable color palettes, dynamic lighting effects (breathing, pulsing, flowing), and intensity levels. Options for pre-set themes (e.g., "Relaxation," "Focus," "Energy").
        *   Haptic Feedback Patterns: User-definable vibration patterns, intensity levels, and localized transducer assignments. Different patterns for different notification types (messages, reminders, alarms).
        *   Environmental Zones: Ability to assign specific lighting and haptic profiles to different rooms or areas of the home.
    *   Intent/Message Mapping: Logic to map specific user intents (identified through speech recognition) and message types to corresponding lighting and haptic profiles.
        *   Example: When a user asks for news, the lighting might shift to a cool blue and the chair back might provide a subtle pulsing vibration.
        *   Example: A high-priority message from a specific contact might trigger a bright red flash on the ambient lights and a distinct vibration pattern on the desk surface.
    *   Dynamic Adaptation: Algorithm to learn user preferences and dynamically adjust lighting and haptic profiles based on user interaction and environmental factors (time of day, ambient light levels, etc.).
    *   API/SDK: Open API/SDK for third-party developers to integrate custom lighting and haptic profiles into their applications.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// On User Profile Activation
function activateUserProfile(userProfile) {
    setAmbientLightingTheme(userProfile.lightingTheme);
    setHapticFeedbackPatterns(userProfile.hapticPatterns);
    assignHapticZones(userProfile.hapticZones);
}

// On Message Received
function handleMessage(message, sender) {
    if (messageType == "High Priority") {
        triggerHapticAlert(sender, "Urgent");
        flashAmbientLights("Red");
    } else if (messageType == "Social Media Update") {
        triggerHapticAlert(sender, "Notification");
        pulseAmbientLights("Blue");
    }
}

//On Intent Recognition
function handleIntent(intent, data){
    if (intent == "Play Music"){
        setAmbientLightingMood(data.genre);
    }
    else if (intent == "Start Work"){
        setHapticFeedbackPattern("Focus");
        setAmbientLightingMood("Focus");
    }
}
```

*   **Use Case Examples:**
    *   **Personalized Wake-Up:** Gradually increasing ambient light and gentle haptic vibrations to simulate sunrise and provide a natural wake-up experience.
    *   **Immersive Gaming:** Synchronized lighting and haptic feedback to create a more immersive gaming experience.
    *   **Accessibility Features:** Visual and tactile notifications for users with visual or hearing impairments.
    *   **Enhanced Productivity:** Lighting and haptic cues to promote focus and reduce distractions.
