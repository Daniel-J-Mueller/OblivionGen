## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Tiered Access

**Concept:** Extend the authentication framework to incorporate continuous trust scoring based on network behavior *after* initial authentication. Implement tiered access levels dynamically adjusted based on this score.

**Specs:**

*   **Trust Score Parameters:**
    *   **Bandwidth Utilization:**  Consistent, moderate bandwidth use = positive score.  Spikes/anomalies = negative.
    *   **Packet Inspection (Metadata Only):** Analyze packet headers for protocol compliance, unusual port usage, and destination patterns.  (No payload inspection for privacy).
    *   **Connection Stability:**  Frequent disconnections/reconnections = negative.
    *   **Geographic Consistency:** Track source IP location (coarse-grained). Deviations from established patterns = negative.
    *   **Time-of-Day Usage:**  Deviations from established usage patterns = negative.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** A weighted average of the above parameters. Weights are configurable. Algorithm must be resistant to simple manipulation.  (e.g., random noise injection).
*   **Tiered Access Levels:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Initial Access):** Baseline services only. Low bandwidth limits.
    *   **Tier 2 (Established Trust):** Access to standard services. Moderate bandwidth.
    *   **Tier 3 (High Trust):** Access to premium services. Higher bandwidth.  Potential for automated provisioning of additional resources.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Trust score is recalculated at regular intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes). Access level is adjusted accordingly. Transitions between tiers should be smooth to avoid service disruption.
*   **Alerting & Remediation:**  Significant drops in trust score trigger alerts to security personnel. Automatic actions may include:
    *   Temporary bandwidth throttling
    *   Session termination
    *   Request for re-authentication
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Trust scoring engine implemented as a separate microservice.
    *   API endpoints for:
        *   Reporting network behavior data
        *   Retrieving current trust score
        *   Retrieving current access level
    *   Integration with existing network infrastructure (firewalls, load balancers) to enforce access control.

**Pseudocode (Trust Scoring Engine):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(networkData):
    bandwidthScore = calculateBandwidthScore(networkData)
    packetScore = calculatePacketScore(networkData)
    stabilityScore = calculateStabilityScore(networkData)
    geoScore = calculateGeoScore(networkData)
    timeScore = calculateTimeScore(networkData)

    totalScore = (bandwidthScore * weightBandwidth) + (packetScore * weightPacket) + (stabilityScore * weightStability) + (geoScore * weightGeo) + (timeScore * weightTime)

    return totalScore

function determineAccessTier(trustScore):
    if trustScore < tier1Threshold:
        return "Tier 1"
    elif trustScore < tier2Threshold:
        return "Tier 2"
    else:
        return "Tier 3"
```
