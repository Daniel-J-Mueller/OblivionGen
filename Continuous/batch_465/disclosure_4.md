## Dynamic Communication Profile Prioritization & Projection

**Concept:** Extend the voice command system to proactively *project* communication profiles onto available displays, anticipating user needs before a command is even given. This goes beyond simply *joining* a call; it actively prepares the environment for communication, intelligently selecting displays and audio output based on contextual awareness and learned user preferences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Profile Data Structure:**

*   `CommunicationProfile`:
    *   `ProfileID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `UserID`: Associated user.
    *   `PreferredDisplayID`: Preferred display for profile projection.
    *   `AudioOutputDeviceID`: Preferred audio output.
    *   `DefaultApplication`: Application to launch (video call, messaging, etc.).
    *   `ContextualRules`: List of rules defining preferred settings based on context. Example: `IF timeOfDay == "morning" THEN application == "video call"`.
    *   `PriorityScore`:  A dynamically calculated score indicating the likelihood of this profile being needed.

**2. Priority Score Calculation:**

*   Factors influencing `PriorityScore`:
    *   **Recency:** How recently was this profile used? (Exponential decay)
    *   **Frequency:** How often is this profile used?
    *   **Contact List Proximity:**  How often does the first user communicate with contacts associated with the profile?
    *   **Location:** Current location of the first device and associated locations of contacts in the profile.
    *   **Calendar Events:** Upcoming meetings or events involving contacts in the profile.
    *   **Contextual Rules Match:** How well do current conditions match `ContextualRules`?

*   Pseudocode:

```
PriorityScore = (RecencyWeight * RecencyScore) + (FrequencyWeight * FrequencyScore) + (ProximityWeight * ProximityScore) + (LocationWeight * LocationScore) + (CalendarWeight * CalendarScore) + (ContextualRuleWeight * ContextualRuleMatchScore)
```

**3. Projection Mechanism:**

*   System continuously monitors `PriorityScore` for all known `CommunicationProfile`s.
*   When a `PriorityScore` exceeds a defined threshold:
    *   The system attempts to "project" the profile onto the `PreferredDisplayID`.
    *   Projection includes:
        *   Launching the `DefaultApplication`.
        *   Displaying a pre-populated contact list associated with the profile.
        *   Adjusting audio output to the `AudioOutputDeviceID`.
        *   Presenting a visual "ready state" indicating the profile is prepared (e.g., a pulsing icon).
    *   If the `PreferredDisplayID` is unavailable, the system searches for the next available display.
*   Projection is *non-intrusive*.  The user must actively interact with the projected profile to initiate communication.

**4. Voice Command Integration:**

*   Existing voice commands are enhanced to directly activate projected profiles.  Example: "Connect to Sarah" will automatically activate Sarah’s projected profile if it’s ready.
*   New voice command: “Show me my ready profiles” – displays all profiles exceeding the projection threshold.

**5. Learning and Adaptation:**

*   The system continuously learns user preferences based on interactions with projected profiles.
*   Adjusts `PriorityScore` weights based on user behavior.
*   Suggests new `ContextualRules` based on observed patterns.



This approach moves beyond reactive communication joining to a proactive, anticipatory system, streamlining the communication process and enhancing user experience.
