## Adaptive Stereo Vision with Bio-Inspired Eye Movement

**Concept:** Mimic the saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements of biological vision systems to actively stabilize and refine stereo vision in a dynamic environment, enhancing depth perception and object tracking. The current patent focuses on *correcting* misalignment â€“ this system *prevents* significant misalignment through proactive adjustment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Two high-resolution cameras (identical to those in the source patent).
    *   Micro-gimbal mounts for *each* camera, providing 2-axis (pan/tilt) movement with high precision and speed. These are distinct from a single actuator correcting only one camera.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into the UAV frame, providing real-time acceleration and angular velocity data.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (FPGA or dedicated ASIC) for real-time motion processing and control.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**

    1.  **Predictive Motion Modeling:**
        *   Utilize the IMU data to predict the UAV's motion and, consequently, the expected relative motion between the cameras. This is crucial for *proactive* stabilization.
        *   Develop a Kalman filter or similar state estimator to fuse IMU data with visual odometry derived from the camera images.
        *   Model expected camera movement based on UAV acceleration, angular velocity and prior stereo image data.

    2.  **Saccadic Adjustment:**
        *   Implement a "saccade" algorithm that rapidly repositions the cameras to maintain optimal stereo baseline and convergence, triggered by:
            *   Significant drift detected in the stereo disparity map.
            *   Detection of rapid motion of objects within the scene.
            *   Anticipation of UAV maneuvers (based on flight controller data).
        *   Saccades are *small*, fast adjustments designed to recenter the stereo view on objects of interest.
        *   Saccade velocity and acceleration are constrained to minimize motion blur and maintain image quality.

    3.  **Smooth Pursuit Tracking:**
        *   Implement a smooth pursuit algorithm to continuously track moving objects and smoothly adjust the camera positions to keep them within the field of view.
        *   Object detection and tracking can be performed using established computer vision techniques (e.g., optical flow, feature tracking).
        *   Smooth pursuit adjustments are *slower* and more gradual than saccades, providing continuous stabilization.

    4.  **Disparity Map Refinement:**
        *   Even with active stabilization, minor misalignment may still occur. Implement a robust stereo matching algorithm to generate a disparity map.
        *   Use the disparity map to refine the camera positions and correct any residual misalignment.

*   **Pseudocode (Simplified Saccade Trigger):**

```
// Parameters
float driftThreshold = 0.1; // Disparity drift threshold
float saccadeSpeed = 50; // Degrees per second

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Calculate disparity drift (based on stereo matching)
  float disparityDrift = calculateDisparityDrift();

  if (abs(disparityDrift) > driftThreshold) {
    // Calculate saccade angle
    float saccadeAngle = -disparityDrift * 10; // Scale drift to angle

    // Move cameras to new angle
    moveCameras(saccadeAngle, saccadeSpeed);
  }
}
```

*   **Refinements:**
    *   Integrate machine learning to predict object motion and proactively adjust camera positions.
    *   Explore the use of multiple IMUs to improve motion estimation accuracy.
    *   Develop adaptive filtering techniques to reduce noise and improve the stability of the system.
    *   Implement a fail-safe mechanism that reverts to a static stereo configuration in case of system failure.
