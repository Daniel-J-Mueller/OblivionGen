## Adaptive Audio Prioritization with Contextual Embedding

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:**

The system dynamically adjusts audio transmission priority not just on detection scores (as in the provided patent), but on *contextual embeddings* of the audio itself. This goes beyond keyword spotting to assess the *meaning* and *potential importance* of the audio segment.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Edge Device (Client):**
    *   Microphone array.
    *   Low-power DSP/Neural Engine capable of running moderate-sized embedding models (e.g., a quantized MobileNetV2 or similar).
    *   Wireless communication module (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular).
    *   Sufficient RAM for temporary audio buffering and model execution.
*   **Server:**
    *   High-performance compute cluster (GPUs recommended) for embedding model training and updates.
    *   Large-scale data storage for audio data and embeddings.
    *   Network infrastructure to handle data transfer.

**III. Software Components:**

1.  **Audio Preprocessing Module (Edge):**
    *   Noise reduction.
    *   Automatic Gain Control (AGC).
    *   Feature extraction (e.g., MFCCs, spectrograms).

2.  **Embedding Model (Edge/Server):**
    *   A deep learning model (e.g., a variant of Wav2Vec 2.0 or HuBERT) trained to produce dense vector representations (embeddings) of audio segments.  The initial model is trained on the server.
    *   Quantization and optimization for edge deployment.
    *   Federated learning capability to personalize models on individual devices.

3.  **Priority Calculation Module (Edge):**
    *   Combines the detection score (from keyword spotting, if applicable) with the embedding similarity score.  The embedding similarity is calculated against a dynamically updated set of "important" audio embeddings stored on the server.
    *   A weighting function determines the relative importance of detection score vs. embedding similarity.  This weighting can be adjusted based on user preferences or application context.
    *   Output: A priority score (e.g., 0-100).

4.  **Transmission Controller (Edge):**
    *   Based on the priority score, determines whether to transmit the audio segment immediately, buffer it for later transmission, or discard it.
    *   Adaptive bitrate control based on network conditions.

5.  **Server-Side Embedding Database:**
    *   Stores embeddings of "important" audio segments (e.g., emergency calls, urgent requests).
    *   Supports efficient similarity search (e.g., using approximate nearest neighbor algorithms).
    *   Continuously updated with new "important" embeddings.

6.  **Federated Learning Module (Server):**
    *   Aggregates updates from edge devices to improve the embedding model.
    *   Privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., differential privacy) to protect user data.

**IV. Pseudocode (Priority Calculation Module):**

```pseudocode
function calculatePriority(detectionScore, audioEmbedding):
  # Constants (tunable)
  EMBEDDING_WEIGHT = 0.6
  DETECTION_WEIGHT = 0.4
  SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.7

  # Calculate similarity between audioEmbedding and embeddings in server database
  similarityScore = findMostSimilarEmbedding(audioEmbedding)

  # Apply threshold
  if similarityScore > SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD:
    priority = (EMBEDDING_WEIGHT * similarityScore) + (DETECTION_WEIGHT * detectionScore)
  else:
    priority = detectionScore  # Rely solely on detection score

  return priority
```

**V. Operational Flow:**

1.  Client device captures audio.
2.  Audio is preprocessed.
3.  The embedding model generates an audio embedding.
4.  The priority calculation module combines detection score (if any) with embedding similarity.
5.  The transmission controller determines whether to transmit the audio segment based on the priority score.
6.  The server receives the audio segment (if transmitted).
7.  The server updates the embedding database and potentially retrains the embedding model using federated learning.
