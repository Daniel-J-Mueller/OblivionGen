## Event Source Profiling & Adaptive Bloom Filter Granularity

**Concept:** Enhance the bloom filter system by profiling event sources to dynamically adjust the granularity of filtering applied to each. Some sources may generate high-volume, predictable events, while others produce rare, complex events. A 'one-size-fits-all' bloom filter approach isnâ€™t optimal. This system builds source profiles and adapts filter settings accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Source Profiler Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Each event source reports (or has automatically collected) metadata with each event: source ID, event type ID, event complexity score (calculated based on data payload size/structure), event rate (events/second).
*   **Statistical Analysis:** The profiler maintains a running average of event rates, complexity, and type distributions for each source.  Uses exponential smoothing to give more weight to recent data.
*   **Source Classification:** Classifies sources into tiers (e.g., High-Volume/Low-Complexity, Medium-Volume/Medium-Complexity, Low-Volume/High-Complexity) based on the statistical analysis.  Tier boundaries are configurable.
*   **Output:** Generates a Source Profile object containing: Source ID, Tier, Average Event Rate, Average Complexity Score, Event Type Distribution.

**2. Adaptive Bloom Filter Manager:**

*   **Bloom Filter Allocation:** Maintains a pool of bloom filters with varying sizes and false positive rates.  Larger filters reduce false positives but consume more memory.
*   **Tier-Based Filter Assignment:**  Assigns a bloom filter to each source based on its assigned Tier:
    *   **High-Volume/Low-Complexity:** Small, highly optimized bloom filter with a higher false positive rate.  Fast processing is prioritized.
    *   **Medium-Volume/Medium-Complexity:** Medium-sized bloom filter with a balanced false positive rate and processing speed.
    *   **Low-Volume/High-Complexity:** Large, highly accurate bloom filter with a lower false positive rate. Accuracy is prioritized, as the cost of false positives is higher.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Monitors event rates and complexity scores in real-time. If a source's behavior changes significantly (e.g., high-volume source suddenly sends complex events), the system automatically re-allocates a bloom filter with appropriate characteristics.
*   **Filter Update Mechanism:**  Similar to the original patent, updates are propagated to the event sources. However, the update message includes the new bloom filter *and* a signal indicating the new filter characteristics (size, false positive rate).

**3. Event Source Adaptation:**

*   **Filter Reception:** Event sources receive updated bloom filters and associated characteristics.
*   **Filter Switching:** Event sources seamlessly switch to the new filter.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Event sources allocate resources (memory, CPU) dynamically based on the size of the received filter.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Bloom Filter Manager):**

```
function assign_bloom_filter(source_id):
  source_profile = get_source_profile(source_id)
  tier = classify_source(source_profile)

  if tier == "HighVolumeLowComplexity":
    filter = get_bloom_filter("small", "high_false_positive")
  elif tier == "MediumVolumeMediumComplexity":
    filter = get_bloom_filter("medium", "balanced_false_positive")
  elif tier == "LowVolumeHighComplexity":
    filter = get_bloom_filter("large", "low_false_positive")
  else:
    filter = get_bloom_filter("default", "balanced_false_positive")

  return filter

function monitor_source_behavior(source_id):
  # collect event statistics (rate, complexity)
  # if statistics deviate significantly from historical data:
  #   reclassify_source(source_id)
  #   new_filter = assign_bloom_filter(source_id)
  #   send_updated_filter(source_id, new_filter)
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Bloom Filter Chaining:**  For sources with highly variable event types, consider chaining multiple bloom filters, each specialized for a particular event type.
*   **Source-Specific Updates:**  Updates to the bloom filter can be targeted to specific sources, reducing unnecessary network traffic.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Implement a feedback loop where event sources report false positives to the Bloom Filter Manager, allowing it to fine-tune filter parameters.
