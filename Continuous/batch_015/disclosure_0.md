## Dynamic Inventory Holder Subdivision

**Concept:** Enhance inventory access and packing efficiency by enabling *in-situ* subdivision of inventory holders, creating smaller, immediately-shippable units.

**Specs:**

*   **Inventory Holder Base Unit:** Standard dimensions (e.g., 24” x 18” x 12”), robust construction (reinforced polymer). Equipped with integrated, low-power cutting elements (ultrasonic or micro-abrasive) along pre-defined fracture lines.  Fracture lines form a grid pattern – configurable via software.
*   **Cutting Element Activation:** Controlled by the central management system. Activates only when a retrieval request specifies a partial quantity of items within the holder. Cutting elements operate along the pre-defined grid lines, cleanly separating a portion of the holder.
*   **Subdivision Control Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Retrieval request (item ID, quantity), inventory holder map (item locations), cutting element activation parameters.
    *   Process:
        1.  Locate item within holder map.
        2.  Determine minimum cutting path to isolate the requested quantity.
        3.  Transmit activation signal to cutting elements.
        4.  Verify cut completion via integrated sensors.
        5.  Update inventory map to reflect subdivision.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Cut completion sensors (optical/pressure)
    *   Weight sensors (detect partial holder weight)
    *   RFID/barcode scanner (verify contents of subdivided unit)
*   **Power System:** Integrated, rechargeable battery (inductive charging at storage/retrieval points).  Battery status monitored by the management system.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) to the central management system.
*   **Material:** Polymer composite with embedded fracture lines and heating elements. Heat can be used to soften the polymer along the lines before the cutting elements engage.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  Retrieval request received.
2.  System identifies inventory holder containing item.
3.  Subdivision control algorithm calculates optimal cutting path.
4.  Cutting elements activate, separating the desired quantity.
5.  RFID/barcode scanner verifies the contents of the subdivided unit.
6.  Subdivided unit is transported to packing station.
7.  Remaining portion of the inventory holder is returned to storage.
