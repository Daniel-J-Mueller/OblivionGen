## Modular, Bio-Integrated Device Mount

**Concept:** A device mount that isn't fixed, but *grows* with or adapts to the device it supports, leveraging bio-compatible, shape-memory polymers and micro-robotics.  Instead of clamping or adhering, it *interfaces* with the device’s chassis, forming a dynamically adjusting cradle.

**Specs:**

*   **Material:**  Bio-compatible, shape-memory polyurethane (SMP) infused with graphene for conductivity and structural reinforcement.  Durometer adjustable via microfluidic channels integrated within the polymer matrix.
*   **Actuation:** Micro-robotic “tendrils” (approx. 2-5mm diameter) composed of piezoelectric actuators and flexible circuitry embedded within the SMP. These tendrils extend and retract, conforming to the device's contours. Tendrils are individually addressable.
*   **Sensing:**  Capacitive proximity sensors integrated into the tendril tips, providing real-time feedback on device contact and pressure distribution. This data informs the micro-robotic control system.
*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer via resonant inductive coupling. Receiver coils embedded within the SMP matrix.  Energy harvesting from device vibration (piezoelectric elements within the SMP).
*   **Control System:** Embedded microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M series) with dedicated DSP for sensor data processing and actuator control.  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connectivity for remote configuration and diagnostics.
*   **Mounting Interface:**  A base unit that attaches to a standard mounting point (e.g., dashboard, desk).  The base unit contains the primary power supply and control circuitry.  The SMP/tendril structure is attached to the base unit via a flexible, articulating joint.
*   **Adaptive Pressure Mapping:** Algorithm to distribute contact pressure evenly across the device surface, preventing stress concentrations and ensuring a secure hold.
*   **Self-Repair Functionality:** Microcapsules containing liquid polymer dispersed within the SMP matrix. If a micro-fracture occurs, the capsules rupture, releasing the liquid polymer which fills the crack and solidifies.
*   **Form Factor:** Initial form factor will be a universal smartphone/tablet mount, but design should be scalable for a wider range of devices.
*   **Software:**  API for integration with device management software. Over-the-air firmware updates.

**Pseudocode (Actuation Loop):**

```
// Initialize sensors and actuators

loop:
    readSensorData()  //Get proximity data from each tendril tip
    calculateAdjustmentVectors() //Determine required extension/retraction for each tendril based on sensor data and desired contact pressure
    
    for each tendril:
        adjustActuator(tendril, adjustmentVector)
        
    delay(10ms)
    
    if (deviceRemovedDetected()):
        resetMount()
```
