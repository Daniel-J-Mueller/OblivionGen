## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Personalized Soundscapes

**Concept:** Extend the automatic content transfer system to create dynamic, personalized acoustic zones within an environment. Instead of simply transferring audio *to* a new device, the system intelligently mixes and layers soundscapes unique to the user’s location and activity, leveraging multiple distributed audio sources.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Distributed array of low-power, beamforming speakers (minimum 3, ideally 6+ per room/defined space). These speakers should be network-connected and capable of independent audio playback.
    *   Each speaker unit includes: miniature microphone array for acoustic mapping, a proximity sensor (IR/Ultrasonic), and processing unit.
    *   Existing device microphone/speaker infrastructure is fully integrated.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:** Real-time 3D acoustic map creation. Uses microphone arrays in both user-carried devices and distributed speakers to model sound reflections and identify sound sources.
    *   **User Activity Recognition:** Analyzes audio (speech, movement sounds), visual data (if available), and sensor data to infer user activity (e.g., phone call, focused work, relaxing, exercising).
    *   **Personalized Soundscape Generator:** Creates layered audio experiences based on user activity, location within the acoustic map, and user preferences. This includes:
        *   Ambient soundscapes (e.g., rain, forest, cafe)
        *   Focus/productivity enhancing sounds (e.g., binaural beats, white noise)
        *   Personalized audio cues (e.g., notifications, reminders)
        *   Seamless audio transfer between devices, masking transitions.
    *   **Beamforming Controller:** Directs audio beams to the user’s current location, optimizing clarity and minimizing sound bleed to other areas. Uses the acoustic map and user location to dynamically adjust beam patterns.
    *   **Central Control Unit:** Coordinates all modules, manages user profiles, and provides a user interface for customization.
*   **Data Flow:**

    1.  User carries a primary device (phone, smartwatch) with active microphone.
    2.  Microphone captures audio and sends it to the Central Control Unit.
    3.  Acoustic Mapping Engine creates a real-time 3D map of the environment.
    4.  User Activity Recognition infers the user’s activity based on the audio and other sensor data.
    5.  Personalized Soundscape Generator creates a tailored audio experience.
    6.  Beamforming Controller directs the audio to the user’s location via the distributed speakers.
    7.  System dynamically adjusts soundscapes and beam patterns as the user moves.

**Pseudocode (Soundscape Generation):**

```
function generateSoundscape(userActivity, userLocation, userPreferences):
  baseSoundscape = selectBaseSoundscape(userActivity) // e.g., "Cafe Ambiance" for "Relaxing"
  preferenceLayer = applyUserPreferences(baseSoundscape, userPreferences) // Add preferred music genres, volume levels
  locationLayer = adjustSoundscapeForLocation(preferenceLayer, userLocation) // Emphasize directional sounds based on environment
  dynamicLayer = generateDynamicCues(userActivity) // Add reminders, notifications, directional prompts
  finalSoundscape = combineLayers(locationLayer, dynamicLayer)
  return finalSoundscape
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond simple audio transfer to create a completely immersive and personalized acoustic environment that adapts in real-time to the user’s activity and location. Combines acoustic mapping, activity recognition, and personalized content generation to deliver a truly unique audio experience.
