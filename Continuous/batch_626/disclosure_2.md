## Dynamic Predictive Occlusion Mapping for Multi-Agent Systems

**System Overview:** A layered system integrating existing overhead/side-view imaging with real-time predictive occlusion mapping to enhance agent identification and tracking, especially in dynamic, cluttered environments.

**Core Innovation:** The system doesn’t just *react* to occlusions (agents hidden behind objects or each other); it *predicts* them. This allows for proactive data acquisition and inference, drastically improving accuracy and reducing reliance on clear sightlines.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Existing Overhead/Side-View Cameras:** As described in the provided patent.
*   **Depth Sensor Array:** A network of short-range depth sensors (ToF or structured light) distributed across the facility ceiling. These provide localized depth information supplementing the camera data.
*   **Edge Computing Nodes:** Low-latency processors positioned near the camera/sensor arrays to perform initial data processing and predictive modeling.
*   **Central Server:** For data aggregation, long-term tracking, and system-wide optimization.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Environmental Mapping:** Initial 3D reconstruction of the facility using a combination of LiDAR scans and initial camera data. This creates a static environmental model.

2.  **Dynamic Object Tracking (DOT):** Utilizing the DOT module, the system tracks *all* moving objects in the facility, not just agents. This is crucial for occlusion prediction.

3.  **Predictive Occlusion Mapping (POM):** The POM module is the core innovation.
    *   **Trajectory Analysis:** Based on the DOT data, the POM module analyzes the trajectories of all moving objects.
    *   **Collision Prediction:** Using trajectory analysis and the environmental map, the module predicts potential collisions and occlusions.
    *   **Occlusion Volume Estimation:** For each predicted occlusion, the module estimates the volume of space that will be obscured.
    *   **Data Acquisition Prioritization:** The POM module then prioritizes data acquisition. If an occlusion is predicted, the system proactively adjusts camera angles (if pan/tilt functionality exists), activates specific depth sensors to “see around” the obstruction, or requests additional imaging data from other viewpoints.

4.  **Multi-View Fusion & Agent Reconstruction:** Data from cameras, depth sensors, and predictive occlusion maps are fused to create a more complete and accurate representation of each agent. This goes beyond simple image stitching, incorporating depth information and probabilistic reasoning to infer agent pose and identity even in partially obscured conditions.

**Pseudocode (POM Module):**

```
function predictOcclusion(trajectory1, trajectory2, environmentMap):
  # trajectory1, trajectory2: lists of (x, y, z, time) tuples
  # environmentMap: 3D representation of the facility

  collisionPoint = calculateCollisionPoint(trajectory1, trajectory2)

  if collisionPoint is not None:
    #Determine if the collision point blocks the line of sight between agent and camera.
    isBlocking = isLineOfSightBlocked(cameraPosition, agentPosition, collisionPoint, environmentMap)

    if isBlocking:
      occlusionVolume = estimateOcclusionVolume(collisionPoint, trajectory1, trajectory2, environmentMap)
      return occlusionVolume, True
  return None, False

function estimateOcclusionVolume(collisionPoint, trajectory1, trajectory2, environmentMap):
  #Raycast from agent to camera. Determine volume of obstruction.
  #Account for agent size and speed.
  #Returns 3D volume of occlusion.
  volume = calculateVolume(raycast(agentPosition, cameraPosition, environmentMap))
  return volume

function prioritizeDataAcquisition(occlusionVolume):
  #Adjust camera angles, activate depth sensors, request additional data.
  #Based on the size and location of the occlusion volume.
  if occlusionVolume is not None:
    activateDepthSensor(closestSensorToOcclusion)
    adjustCameraAngle(angleToMinimizeOcclusion)
  return
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Agent Intent Prediction:** Integrate machine learning models to predict agent behavior and anticipate potential occlusions even before they occur.
*   **Dynamic Re-Mapping:** Continuously update the environmental map based on real-time sensor data, accounting for moving objects and changes in the facility layout.
*   **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Coordinate data acquisition and tracking across multiple agents to improve overall system performance.
