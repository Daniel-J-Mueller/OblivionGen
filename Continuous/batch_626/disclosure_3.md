## Dynamic Content Source Weighting via Real-Time User Experience Metrics

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts content source weighting (origin server, CDN POPs, etc.) not solely based on network metrics (latency, bandwidth), but *directly* on aggregated, anonymized user experience (UX) data.

**Components:**

*   **UX Data Collector:** Javascript/SDK integrated into client applications (web, mobile) to capture:
    *   Time to First Byte (TTFB) - per content item
    *   Fully Loaded Time - per content item
    *   Javascript Error Rate - per content item
    *   Rendering Blockers (CSS/JS load times impacting visual progress)
    *   User Interaction Metrics (clicks, scrolls, time spent on page) – *correlated* to content delivery.
*   **Anonymization & Aggregation Engine:** Server-side component to anonymize UX data (remove PII) and aggregate metrics *per content item* and *per content source*.  Aggregation should be regionalized (e.g., by country, city) to account for localized network conditions.
*   **Weighted Routing Algorithm:** A core algorithm running within POPs and potentially origin servers. This algorithm receives:
    *   Traditional network metrics (latency, bandwidth to each source)
    *   Real-time UX metrics (aggregated from the Anonymization Engine).
    *   A configurable weight parameter to balance network performance vs. user experience.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The Weighted Routing Algorithm adjusts content source weighting based on UX data. A poorly performing source (high error rate, slow TTFB) receives a lower weight, diverting traffic to better sources.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Integrate an A/B testing framework to allow experimentation with different weighting parameters and UX metric combinations.

**Pseudocode (Weighted Routing Algorithm):**

```
function selectContentSource(contentID, availableSources):
  networkWeight = configuration.networkWeight // Configurable
  uxWeight = 1 - networkWeight

  sourceScores = {}
  for source in availableSources:
    networkScore = calculateNetworkScore(source) // Based on latency, bandwidth
    uxScore = calculateUXScore(source) // Based on aggregated UX metrics
    sourceScores[source] = (networkWeight * networkScore) + (uxWeight * uxScore)

  bestSource = source with highest score in sourceScores
  return bestSource

function calculateUXScore(source):
  //Retrieve recent UX metrics for this source (TTFB, Error Rate, etc.)
  uxMetrics = getUXMetrics(source)

  //Normalize UX metrics to a 0-1 scale.
  normalizedMetrics = normalize(uxMetrics)

  //Combine normalized metrics into a single UX score.
  uxScore = (normalizedMetrics.TTFBWeight * normalizedMetrics.TTFB) + (normalizedMetrics.ErrorRateWeight * (1 - normalizedMetrics.ErrorRate)) + ...
  return uxScore
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond solely optimizing for network speed to directly optimizing for *perceived* user experience. It acknowledges that a fast connection doesn’t guarantee a good experience if the content is poorly rendered or riddled with errors.  The feedback loop allows the system to adapt to changing conditions and user behavior in real time, leading to a more responsive and enjoyable user experience. It is a user-centric approach to content delivery.
