## Dynamic Rule Weighting via Real-Time Feedback Loops

**Concept:** Extend the priority-based rule system with a dynamic weighting mechanism adjusted by real-time performance feedback. Instead of static priorities, each rule’s influence is modulated based on its observed impact on downstream processes (e.g., transaction completion rate, customer satisfaction, error rate).

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection Module:**

   *   **Purpose:** Monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) associated with transactions/categorizations processed using the rule system.
   *   **KPIs:**
        *   Transaction Completion Rate: Percentage of transactions successfully processed after rule application.
        *   Error Rate:  Frequency of errors occurring post-rule application (e.g., incorrect tax calculations, invalid promotions).
        *   Customer Feedback:  Sentiment analysis of customer interactions relating to categorization outcomes (via surveys, support tickets).
        *   Latency: Time taken to apply rules to a record.
   *   **Implementation:** Integrate with existing transaction processing, error logging, and customer feedback systems.

**2.  Reward/Penalty System:**

   *   **Purpose:** Assign reward/penalty scores to each rule based on observed KPI performance.
   *   **Algorithm:**
        *   For each rule, calculate a weighted average of KPI contributions.
        *   Assign positive rewards for improvements in desired KPIs (e.g., increased completion rate, decreased error rate).
        *   Assign negative penalties for declines in KPIs.
        *   The weights for each KPI should be configurable and tunable.
        *   Example:  `RuleScore = (CompletionRateWeight * CompletionRateImprovement) + (ErrorRateWeight * ErrorRateReduction) + (LatencyWeight * LatencyReduction)`.
   *   **Implementation:**  A dedicated service/module responsible for calculating and updating rule scores.

**3. Dynamic Weight Adjustment Module:**

   *   **Purpose:** Adjust the rule’s effective priority based on its accumulated score.
   *   **Algorithm:**
        *   Map the rule score to a weight multiplier.  A higher score results in a larger multiplier.
        *   Apply the multiplier to the original static priority of the rule.
        *   `AdjustedPriority = StaticPriority * (1 + ScoreMultiplier)`.
        *   Implement a smoothing function (e.g., exponential moving average) to prevent erratic priority fluctuations.
   *   **Implementation:**  Integrate with the lookup flow generation process to incorporate the adjusted priorities.

**4.  A/B Testing Framework:**

   *   **Purpose:** Validate the effectiveness of dynamic weighting before full deployment.
   *   **Implementation:**
        *   Create a control group using the existing static priority system.
        *   Create an experimental group using the dynamic weighting system.
        *   Monitor KPIs for both groups and compare performance.
        *   Use statistical significance testing to determine if the dynamic weighting system is providing a measurable improvement.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Weight Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_rule_priority(rule, static_priority, score, smoothing_factor):
  # Apply smoothing
  smoothed_score = (smoothing_factor * score) + ((1 - smoothing_factor) * previous_smoothed_score)

  # Calculate weight multiplier
  weight_multiplier = 1 + (smoothed_score / 100) #Example:  100 is the maximum possible score

  # Calculate adjusted priority
  adjusted_priority = static_priority * weight_multiplier

  return adjusted_priority
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `RuleRecord`: Contains `rule_id`, `static_priority`, `score`, `smoothed_score`, `adjusted_priority`.
*   `KPI_Data`: Contains timestamped values for `transaction_completion_rate`, `error_rate`, `customer_sentiment`, `latency`.
