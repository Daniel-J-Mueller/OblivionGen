## Distributed Sensory Data Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the encrypted, fragmented data delivery concept to *real-time* sensory input – specifically, reconstructing a complete sensory experience (video, audio, haptic) from fragmented, encrypted streams delivered across a network.

**Inspiration:** The patent’s focus on reconstructing a source file from fragmented, encrypted pieces. I’m applying this to *streaming* data.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensory Fragmenter (Encoding Side):**

*   **Input:** Raw sensory data stream (e.g., camera feed, microphone input, haptic sensor data).
*   **Fragmentation:** Divide the stream into short, time-indexed fragments. Fragment length is configurable based on network conditions and desired latency.
*   **Encryption:** Each fragment is encrypted with a unique, session-specific key. The key is derived from a master key and the fragment's timestamp.
*   **Metadata Generation:** Create metadata for each fragment including:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Fragment ID
    *   Encryption Key (encrypted with a public key of the receiver)
    *   Dependency information (which prior fragments are needed for correct decoding – this is crucial for handling dropped packets or out-of-order delivery)
    *   Checksum/Hash for integrity verification.
*   **Master Fragment:**  A small “master fragment” is created. This contains:
    *   The encryption key for the master fragment itself.
    *   A list of the public keys of all intended receivers.
    *   A hash of the *entire* sensory data stream to verify complete reconstruction.
*   **Transmission:** Fragments and the Master Fragment are transmitted independently across the network.  

**2. Sensory Reconstructor (Decoding Side):**

*   **Master Fragment Reception:** The reconstructor first receives the Master Fragment.
*   **Key Derivation:** The reconstructor uses the Master Fragment's key (decrypted with its private key) to obtain the public keys for encryption.
*   **Fragment Reception & Verification:** Fragments are received asynchronously.
*   **Integrity Check:** Each fragment's checksum/hash is verified.
*   **Dependency Resolution:** The reconstructor uses the dependency information to ensure fragments are processed in the correct order and to request retransmission of missing fragments.
*   **Decryption:** Fragments are decrypted using the appropriate key derived from the master key and fragment timestamp.
*   **Reassembly & Reconstruction:** Fragments are reassembled in the correct order to reconstruct the original sensory data stream.
*   **Complete Hash Verification:** The reconstructed data stream’s hash is compared to the hash in the Master Fragment to verify complete and accurate reconstruction.  If there is a mismatch, reconstruction failed, and the system signals an error.
*   **Output:** The reconstructed sensory data is output for consumption (e.g., displayed on a screen, played through speakers).

**3. Network Considerations:**

*   **Redundancy:** Fragments can be duplicated and sent via multiple paths to improve reliability.
*   **Priority:** Critical fragments (e.g., early frames in a video) can be given higher priority.
*   **Adaptive Fragmentation:** Fragment size and rate can be adjusted dynamically based on network conditions.

**Pseudocode (Reconstructor):**

```
Receive Master Fragment
Decrypt Master Fragment (using private key)
Extract Receiver Public Keys
Extract Stream Hash

fragmentQueue = emptyQueue

while (fragmentsRemaining) {
    Receive Fragment
    Verify Fragment Hash
    Decrypt Fragment (using derived key)
    Enqueue Fragment into fragmentQueue (based on timestamp)

    while (fragmentQueue not empty AND fragment can be processed) {
        fragment = Dequeue fragment
        Process fragment 
    }
}
reconstructedStream = reconstruct(processedFragments)
verifyHash(reconstructedStream, streamHash)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Secure video conferencing
*   Real-time remote control of robots or drones
*   Immersive virtual reality experiences
*   Secure transmission of sensitive sensor data (e.g., medical devices)
*   Low-latency streaming for gaming or AR/VR
