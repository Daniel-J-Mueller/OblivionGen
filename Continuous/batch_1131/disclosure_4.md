## Adaptive Acoustic Camouflage - Earbud Extension

**Core Concept:** Earbuds capable of actively sampling and replicating ambient sound *around* the user, creating a localized “acoustic camouflage” effect. The goal is not noise *cancellation* but sonic blending – making the user seem less present in a space, or subtly altering their perceived location.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Six outward-facing, beamforming microphones distributed around the earbud housing.  Must prioritize capturing ambient sounds *outside* the direct line of hearing.  Calibration routine for individual ear canal acoustics is mandatory.
*   **Spatial Audio Processor:** Dedicated DSP chip with at least 1 GHz processing speed. Core algorithms:
    *   *Ambient Capture:* Continuous sampling of all microphone inputs.
    *   *Spatial Mapping:*  Identifies dominant sound sources in a 360° radius (minimum 5m range). Algorithm must differentiate between static background noise and dynamic sources.
    *   *Replication Engine:*  Generates a synthetic soundscape mimicking the captured ambient sounds.  Emphasis on phase coherence and accurate spatial positioning.
    *   *Acoustic Projection:*  Directs the synthetic soundscape through miniature bone conduction transducers embedded in the earbud’s contact points. *Crucially*, this is *in addition* to regular audio output. Output levels are dynamically adjusted to blend with the real environment.
*   **Bone Conduction Transducers:**  Minimum 4 transducers per earbud, strategically placed for optimal coverage of mastoid bone and around the ear. Frequency range: 20Hz - 8kHz. Amplitude control: 0-100mV.
*   **Power Requirements:**  Lithium-ion battery, 100mAh minimum capacity, supports at least 4 hours of continuous operation with adaptive acoustic camouflage active. Wireless charging support.
*   **User Interface:** Companion app for:
    *   Calibration routine.
    *   “Camouflage Level” adjustment (subtle blend to complete sonic displacement).
    *   Preset profiles (e.g., "office," "cafe," "outdoor").
    *   Sound source prioritization – user can emphasize/de-emphasize specific sounds in the ambient mix.

**Pseudocode (Spatial Mapping & Replication):**

```
// Ambient Capture
LOOP:
    CAPTURE audio data from all 6 microphones
    STORE data in buffer

// Spatial Mapping
FOR each sound source in buffer:
    CALCULATE time difference of arrival (TDOA) between microphones
    ESTIMATE direction of arrival (DOA) using TDOA
    DETERMINE distance to sound source using signal strength/phase
    CREATE 3D spatial map of sound sources

// Replication Engine
FOR each sound source in spatial map:
    GENERATE synthetic sound matching source's characteristics (frequency, amplitude, timbre)
    APPLY spatialization algorithm to simulate source's location
    MIX synthetic sound with user's audio content (if any)

// Acoustic Projection
    OUTPUT spatialized sound through bone conduction transducers
    ADJUST output amplitude based on camouflage level and environmental noise
END LOOP
```

**Possible Applications:**

*   Enhanced privacy in public spaces.
*   Subtle manipulation of perceived location for augmented reality experiences.
*   Assistance for individuals with auditory processing disorders.
*   Discreet communication (e.g., whispering without being overheard).
