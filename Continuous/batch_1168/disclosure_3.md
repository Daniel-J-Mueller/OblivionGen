## Dynamic Content Stitching for Shared Experiences

**Concept:** Expand the share recommendation system to proactively *create* shareable content, not just recommend sharing existing content. This leverages image analysis and contextual data to generate short-form, dynamic video “stitching” from multiple sources, tailored to the recipient and the inferred intent of the share.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** “Experience Compiler” – A module operating alongside the existing share recommendation engine.
*   **Input:**
    *   Digital Photograph (from user)
    *   Geolocation Data (from user/photo metadata)
    *   User Profile Data (sharing user & potential recipient)
    *   Real-time Data Feeds: Weather, News, Local Events (API access required)
    *   Social Media Data: Publicly available posts/photos tagged to location (optional, privacy considerations)
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Scene Understanding:** Image analysis (similar to the patent's facial recognition) to identify key objects, scenes, and activities in the photo.
    2.  **Contextual Data Enrichment:** Gather relevant data based on geolocation and scene understanding:
        *   Weather conditions at the time/location of the photo.
        *   Nearby points of interest.
        *   Recent news/events related to the location.
        *   Relevant social media posts (optional, user-controlled).
    3.  **Content Assembly:** Dynamically combine the original photo with:
        *   Short video clips (sourced from public domain or licensed stock footage) representing weather conditions or activities.
        *   Animated map overlays showing the location.
        *   Text overlays with contextual information (e.g., “Sunny day at Central Park!”).
        *   Music track (dynamically selected based on mood/context).
    4.  **Rendering:** Stitch together the various elements into a short (5-10 second) video clip.
    5.  **Share Recommendation:** Offer the compiled video as a recommended share option *instead of* just the original photo.

*   **Pseudocode (Experience Compiler - Core Logic):**

```
function compileExperience(photo, userProfile, recipientProfile, geoData):
  scene = analyzeImage(photo)
  weather = getWeather(geoData.coordinates)
  events = getLocalEvents(geoData.coordinates)
  
  clips = []
  
  if weather.condition == "sunny":
    clips.append(getVideoClip("sunny_day.mp4"))
  
  if scene.contains("beach"):
    clips.append(getVideoClip("beach_waves.mp4"))
    
  textOverlay = "Enjoying the " + weather.condition + " at " + geoData.locationName
  
  video = stitchVideoClips(clips)
  video = addTextOverlay(video, textOverlay)
  video = addMusic(video, selectMusic(weather.condition))
  
  return video
```

*   **User Interface Implications:**
    *   A new “Experience” share option alongside the existing “Photo” share option.
    *   Preview of the generated “Experience” before sharing.
    *   User controls to customize the “Experience” (e.g., change music, add personal message).

*   **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Integration with Augmented Reality (AR) – Overlay AR elements onto the photo/video.
    *   AI-powered script generation for personalized voiceovers.
    *   "Experience Themes" – Pre-defined templates for different occasions (e.g., birthday, travel, celebration).
