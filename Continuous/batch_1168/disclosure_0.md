## Real-Time Affective State Routing

**Concept:** Extend the agent availability system to incorporate real-time affective state analysis of both the user *and* the agent, routing requests not just based on availability, but on predicted compatibility and emotional resonance.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   **User Input:** Integrate with user device sensors (camera, microphone) for real-time facial expression analysis, voice tone analysis, and potentially physiological data (heart rate variability via smartwatch integration – opt-in only).
    *   **Agent Input:** Agents utilize a dedicated application interface. This application captures similar data (facial expressions via webcam, voice analysis), and incorporates self-reported emotional state (“How are you feeling right now?” - selectable from a predefined list, with free text input allowed).
*   **Affective State Modeling:**
    *   Employ machine learning models (trained on large datasets of emotional expressions and vocal cues) to infer the user's and agent's emotional states. Categorize into a discrete set of emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, frustrated, neutral, empathetic).  Confidence scores assigned to each emotion.
    *   Agent self-reporting serves as ground truth for model calibration and refinement, and overrides inferred state if significant divergence is detected.
*   **Compatibility Scoring:**
    *   Develop an algorithm to assess ‘emotional compatibility’ between user and agent.  This isn’t about matching emotions (e.g., both being happy), but about identifying complementary states. For example:
        *   A frustrated user might benefit from an agent exhibiting calm empathy.
        *   An excited user might benefit from an equally enthusiastic agent.
        *   A neutral user might prefer an agent exhibiting a stable, measured tone.
    *   The algorithm assigns a compatibility score (0-100) based on predicted resonance.
*   **Dynamic Routing:**
    *   The contact distribution system incorporates compatibility scores into its routing logic. When a request arrives:
        1.  User’s affective state is inferred.
        2.  Available agents’ affective states are assessed (ML inference and/or self-reporting).
        3.  Compatibility scores are calculated for each agent-user pairing.
        4.  The request is routed to the agent with the highest compatibility score, *provided* their availability status allows.
    *   Routing can be weighted – prioritizing compatibility *over* simple availability up to a defined threshold.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   After each interaction, gather user feedback on the perceived empathy and helpfulness of the agent. Use this data to refine the affective state models and compatibility scoring algorithm.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All affective data collection requires explicit user consent.
    *   Data is anonymized and aggregated whenever possible.
    *   Users have the ability to opt-out of affective data collection at any time.
    *   Data retention policies are clearly defined and transparent.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function routeRequest(userRequest):
  userAffectiveState = analyzeUser(userRequest.sensorData)
  availableAgents = getAvailableAgents()
  
  for agent in availableAgents:
    agentAffectiveState = analyzeAgent(agent.sensorData) or agent.selfReportedState
    compatibilityScore = calculateCompatibility(userAffectiveState, agentAffectiveState)
    agent.compatibilityScore = compatibilityScore
  
  sortedAgents = sort(availableAgents, key=lambda a: a.compatibilityScore, reverse=True)
  
  bestAgent = sortedAgents[0]
  
  if bestAgent.availability and bestAgent.compatibilityScore > threshold:
    connectUser(userRequest, bestAgent)
  else:
    // Fallback to standard availability routing
    routeToAvailableAgent(userRequest)
```
