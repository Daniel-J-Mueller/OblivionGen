**Key Versioning for Data Integrity – ‘Shadow Keys’ & Predictive Rotation**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement ‘Shadow Keys’ – parallel key versions actively used for *validation* alongside encryption/decryption. This differs from the patent's focus on phased obsolescence; Shadow Keys exist concurrently, providing immediate integrity checks.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Key Management Service (KMS):** Existing. Responsible for key generation, storage, and rotation. Modified to support Shadow Key creation and lifecycle.
*   **Validation Engine:** New component. Performs cryptographic validation using Shadow Keys. Integrates with existing API endpoints.
*   **Predictive Rotation Module:** New component. Analyzes usage patterns and predicts potential compromise. Triggers proactive Shadow Key creation and eventual rotation.
*   **Data Tagging System:** Modifies data encoding to include a ‘key fingerprint’ – a hash of the key *used for encryption*.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Encryption:**
    *   KMS generates a primary encryption key (Key A).
    *   KMS *also* generates a Shadow Key (Key B) cryptographically related to Key A, but mathematically distinct.
    *   Data is encrypted using Key A.
    *   Data is tagged with a ‘key fingerprint’ (hash of Key A) *and* encrypted with Key B. This creates a 'validation envelope'.
2.  **Storage:** Data and validation envelope are stored.
3.  **Decryption/Validation:**
    *   System retrieves data and validation envelope.
    *   System attempts decryption using the primary key (Key A) identified by the ‘key fingerprint’.
    *   *Simultaneously*, the system uses Key B to decrypt the validation envelope.
    *   If both decryption operations succeed *and* the decrypted data matches, data integrity is confirmed.
    *   Failure of *either* operation indicates compromise or data corruption.
4.  **Predictive Rotation:**
    *   The Predictive Rotation Module monitors key usage patterns (e.g., volume of requests, source IPs, request types).
    *   If anomalous activity is detected (e.g., sudden spike in requests from an unusual location), the module proactively creates a new Shadow Key pair (Key C & Key D).
    *   A phased rollout begins, using the new Shadow Key pair for a subset of new data.
    *   If no anomalies are detected during the rollout, the old Shadow Key pair is archived and the new pair becomes active.

**IV. Pseudocode (Decryption/Validation):**

```
function decryptAndValidate(data, validationEnvelope):
  keyFingerprint = extractKeyFingerprint(validationEnvelope)
  primaryKey = KMS.getKey(keyFingerprint)
  shadowKey = KMS.getShadowKey(keyFingerprint)

  decryptedData = KMS.decrypt(data, primaryKey)
  decryptedValidation = KMS.decrypt(validationEnvelope, shadowKey)

  if (decryptedData != null and decryptedValidation != null):
    if (dataIntegrityCheck(decryptedData, decryptedValidation)):
      return decryptedData
    else:
      return null // Data integrity failed
  else:
    return null // Decryption failed
```

**V. Data Tagging Format:**

`[Key Fingerprint (SHA256 Hash)] [Timestamp] [Key Version] [Optional Metadata]`

**VI. Key Considerations:**

*   **Performance Overhead:** Shadow Key encryption/decryption adds overhead. Optimization is crucial.
*   **Key Storage:** Secure storage of Shadow Keys is paramount.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** A robust rollback mechanism is required in case of issues.
*   **Compatibility:** Consider compatibility with existing systems.
