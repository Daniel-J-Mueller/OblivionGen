## Dynamic Intent Graph for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend the core intent/entity recognition system with a dynamic graph representing user intent *over time*. Instead of solely reacting to immediate utterances, build a probabilistic model of what the user is *likely* to do next, enabling proactive suggestions and anticipatory action.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Intent Graph Data Structure:**
    *   Nodes: Represent intents (e.g., “play music”, “set alarm”, “get directions”).
    *   Edges: Represent transitions between intents, weighted by probability derived from user history. Edge weight indicates the likelihood of moving from one intent to another.
    *   Node Attributes: Include entity data relevant to the intent (e.g., for "play music", entity = "artist", "song", "genre").
    *   Temporal Decay: Edge weights decay over time to reflect changing user preferences.

2.  **Graph Construction & Update:**
    *   Initial Graph: Populate with a base graph of common intent sequences.
    *   Real-time Update:
        *   On each utterance:
            *   Identify current intent and entities.
            *   Add/strengthen edge between previous intent node and current intent node.
            *   Apply temporal decay to all edges.
        *   Background Learning: Periodically retrain graph using longer-term user data.

3.  **Proactive Suggestion Engine:**
    *   Traversal: Regularly traverse the Intent Graph from the current intent node.
    *   Probability Threshold: Identify next likely intents with a probability exceeding a defined threshold.
    *   Suggestion Generation: Create proactive suggestions based on predicted intents. Suggestions can be textual, visual, or auditory.
    *   Confidence Scoring: Assign a confidence score to each suggestion based on the edge weight and other factors.

4.  **Anticipatory Action Module:**
    *   High-Confidence Threshold: If a predicted intent reaches a very high confidence level, automatically initiate relevant actions (e.g., pre-load music playlist, offer directions to frequently visited location).
    *   User Confirmation: Before initiating actions, present a subtle confirmation prompt to the user (e.g., “Starting your commute playlist?”).
    *   Cancellation Option: Allow the user to easily cancel or modify the anticipatory action.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Suggestion Engine):**

```
function generateProactiveSuggestions(currentNode, graph):
  suggestions = []
  for neighbor in graph.neighbors(currentNode):
    probability = graph.edgeWeight(currentNode, neighbor)
    if probability > PROBABILITY_THRESHOLD:
      suggestion = createSuggestion(neighbor)
      suggestion.confidence = probability
      suggestions.append(suggestion)

  suggestions.sort(key=lambda x: x.confidence, reverse=True)
  return suggestions
```

**Example:**

User: “Set an alarm for 7 AM.”

System updates Intent Graph with edge: “Set Alarm” -> (next utterance).

If the system detects the user frequently checks traffic conditions after setting an alarm, the Intent Graph will strengthen the edge: "Set Alarm" -> "Check Traffic".

The Proactive Suggestion Engine might then display a suggestion: “Would you like me to check traffic conditions?” before the alarm goes off.

**Novelty:** This differs from the provided patent by moving beyond reactive response to user utterances and building a dynamic model of user intent over time, enabling *proactive* assistance. It's not simply about clarifying ambiguous requests, but anticipating user needs before they are explicitly stated.
