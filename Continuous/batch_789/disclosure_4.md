## Modular Soft Duct with Integrated Sensor Network & Biofilm Control

**Concept:** Expand the soft duct system beyond simple air delivery to create an active environmental control system with integrated sensing, localized biofilm mitigation, and adaptable duct geometry.

**Specs:**

*   **Duct Material:** Silicone-based polymer with embedded microfluidic channels. Channels are interconnected and form a closed-loop network throughout the duct length. Material must be optically transparent or translucent.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Temperature Sensors:** Distributed along duct length, every 10cm. Resolution: 0.1°C.
    *   **Humidity Sensors:** Distributed along duct length, every 10cm. Resolution: 1% RH.
    *   **VOC Sensors:** Distributed along duct length, every 30cm. Target gases: Ammonia, Carbon Dioxide, Formaldehyde.
    *   **Microbial Sensors:**  Integrated optical sensors capable of detecting biofilm formation and microbial load in real-time. Wavelength range: 400-700nm.
    *   **Airflow Sensors:** Inline airflow meters integrated every 50cm. Accuracy: +/- 5%.
*   **Microfluidic System:**
    *   **Reservoirs:** Two internal reservoirs per duct segment (1m length). One for disinfectant/antimicrobial solution, one for deionized water.  Reservoir capacity: 50ml each.
    *   **Micro-pumps:** Piezoelectric micro-pumps integrated into each segment, controlled via onboard processor. Pump rate: 0.1 – 1 ml/min.
    *   **Micro-valves:** Array of micro-valves enabling selective delivery of disinfectant/water to specific duct sections. Valve resolution: 10um aperture.
    *   **Flush System:**  System capable of reversing flow through microfluidic channels to clear blockages or residue.
*   **Duct Geometry:**
    *   **Segmented Design:** Duct constructed from interconnected 1m segments. Segments connect magnetically for easy assembly and reconfiguration.
    *   **Variable Diameter:**  Each segment includes a series of inflatable/deflatable bladders within the duct wall, allowing for on-demand adjustment of duct diameter (range: 10-50% reduction). Controlled by onboard processor.
    *   **Surface Texture:** Interior duct surface features micro-grooves to promote laminar airflow and reduce biofilm adhesion.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Onboard Processor:** ARM Cortex-M7 processor.
    *   **Wireless Communication:** WiFi/Bluetooth connectivity.
    *   **Power:**  Powered by low-voltage DC (12-24V) or PoE.
    *   **Software:**
        *   Real-time data acquisition and processing.
        *   Automated response algorithms (e.g., increase airflow to hotspots, initiate localized disinfectant cycle).
        *   Remote monitoring and control via web interface or mobile app.
        *   Machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance and optimization.
* **Attachment Mechanism:** Existing track system compatible, utilizing modified hangers incorporating power and data connections.



**Pseudocode – Automated Disinfectant Cycle:**

```
FUNCTION initiateDisinfectantCycle(segmentID)
    IF microbialSensor(segmentID) > thresholdValue THEN
        OPEN microValve(segmentID, disinfectantLine)
        RUN microPump(segmentID, disinfectantLine, flowRate) FOR duration
        CLOSE microValve(segmentID, disinfectantLine)
        RUN microPump(segmentID, waterLine, flushRate) FOR flushDuration
        LOG event(segmentID, “Disinfectant cycle completed”)
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

//Main Loop
WHILE TRUE
    FOREACH segmentID IN ductSegments
        initiateDisinfectantCycle(segmentID)
    ENDFOREACH
    WAIT interval
ENDWHILE
```

This adaptation turns the soft duct from a passive delivery system into an *active* environmental regulator, capable of not only delivering air but also *monitoring* and *mitigating* potential issues like microbial growth and airflow imbalances.  The modular design simplifies maintenance and allows for customized duct configurations.
