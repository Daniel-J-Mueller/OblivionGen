## Dynamic Schema Evolution & Federated Querying

**Concept:** Extend the relational modeling of non-relational data to support *dynamic* schema evolution in the underlying data sources *without* requiring full model rebuilds or downtime. Simultaneously, introduce a federated query layer allowing querying across *multiple* instances of this model, each connected to potentially different non-relational data sources â€“ creating a globally consistent, near-real-time view.

**Specification:**

**I. Dynamic Schema Handling:**

1.  **Schema Drift Detection:** Implement a background process monitoring the non-relational data sources for schema changes (new fields, data type alterations, deleted fields). This could utilize metadata APIs exposed by the data sources or, failing that, periodic sampling and statistical analysis.
2.  **Delta Propagation:**  Instead of rebuilding the entire relational model upon schema drift, propagate only the *changes* to the existing model. This involves:
    *   **Adding new columns:** Append new columns to the appropriate relational table(s) based on the added fields in the non-relational source.  Default values or `NULL` are used for existing rows.
    *   **Data Type Coercion:** Implement a flexible data type coercion engine to handle type mismatches between the non-relational source and the relational model.  Logging and alerting are necessary for potentially lossy conversions.
    *   **Column Removal/Renaming:**  Gracefully handle column removals/renaming by marking columns as deprecated or creating view layers that map old column names to new ones.
3. **Versioned Models:** Store multiple versions of the relational model, allowing rollback to previous states if necessary.  Metadata should track the source non-relational data source state corresponding to each model version.

**II. Federated Query Layer:**

1.  **Global Catalog:** A central "Global Catalog" stores metadata about all registered instances of the relational model. This metadata includes:
    *   Instance ID
    *   Connection details to the underlying non-relational data source
    *   Model version
    *   Data freshness timestamp (last updated)
2.  **Query Decomposition & Distribution:**
    *   Receive SQL queries from clients.
    *   Decompose queries into subqueries that can be executed against individual model instances.
    *   Distribute subqueries to the appropriate instances based on data locality or query optimization.
3.  **Result Aggregation:**
    *   Collect results from individual instances.
    *   Aggregate and combine results into a single, unified result set.
4.  **Smart Routing & Failover:** Implement logic to intelligently route queries to available and healthy model instances. Automatic failover to redundant instances ensures high availability.

**III. Implementation Details/Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Schema Drift Detection (background process)
function detectSchemaDrift(dataSource, currentSchema) {
  newSchema = analyzeDataSourceSchema(dataSource);
  diff = compareSchemas(currentSchema, newSchema);
  return diff;
}

// Apply Schema Changes
function applySchemaChanges(model, schemaDiff) {
  for each change in schemaDiff {
    if change.type == "ADD_COLUMN" {
      alterTable(model, change.tableName, change.columnName, change.dataType);
    } else if change.type == "DELETE_COLUMN" {
      //Deprecate or create view.
    }
    // etc...
  }
}

// Federated Query Processing
function processFederatedQuery(query) {
  queryPlan = generateQueryPlan(query);
  subqueries = decomposeQuery(queryPlan);

  results = [];
  for each subquery in subqueries {
    instance = selectInstance(subquery); // Based on data locality/availability
    result = executeQuery(instance, subquery);
    results.append(result);
  }

  finalResult = aggregateResults(results);
  return finalResult;
}
```

**IV. Technology Stack Considerations:**

*   **Data Serialization:** Protocol Buffers or Apache Avro for efficient data serialization and schema evolution.
*   **Query Engine:**  Trino/Presto or Apache Spark for distributed query processing.
*   **Metadata Store:**  Etcd or Consul for reliable metadata storage.
*   **Monitoring/Alerting:** Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring and alerting.
