## Adaptive Environmental Projection System

**System Overview:** A networked system utilizing the bulletin board technology as a focal point for localized environmental control & immersive experiences. Expands beyond simple announcements to influence surrounding conditions.

**Core Components:**

*   **Enhanced Bulletin Board Units:** Modified bulletin boards equipped with:
    *   Full-spectrum, dynamically adjustable LED panels (ambient lighting)
    *   Miniaturized ultrasonic transducers (localized sound shaping/directional audio)
    *   Micro-environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality)
    *   Aromatherapy diffusion system (optional, controlled release of scents).
*   **Central Control Server:** Manages all networked bulletin boards, user preferences, and environmental profiles.
*   **User Identification System:** Compatible with existing badge identification methods (RFID, QR code, facial recognition)
*   **Content Creation Suite:** Allows administrators to design "Environmental Scenes" associating specific announcements with environmental profiles.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Badge Scan & Profile Activation:** A user presents a badge to a bulletin board. The system identifies the user and retrieves their associated preferences *and* the currently scheduled/active "Environmental Scene".
2.  **Environmental Scene Implementation:** The bulletin board’s sensors collect real-time environmental data. The system calculates adjustments necessary to achieve the target profile defined by the current Environmental Scene.
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   **Lighting:** LED panels adjust color temperature and intensity to create desired ambiance.
    *   **Sound:** Ultrasonic transducers focus sound to create directional audio cues or dampen external noise. (Optional: Audio announcements are blended into the directional sound field.)
    *   **Aroma:** (If equipped) The aromatherapy system releases scents corresponding to the scene (e.g., coffee aroma for a morning meeting announcement).
    *   **Temperature/Humidity:** (Advanced implementation - requires integration with HVAC systems) Adjusts local temperature and humidity within a limited radius.
4.  **Announcements as Triggers:** Announcements themselves *become* triggers for environmental changes. For example:
    *   A “Fire Drill” announcement activates flashing red lights and a pre-recorded evacuation message.
    *   A “New Product Launch” announcement activates upbeat music, vibrant lighting, and a stimulating aroma.
5.  **Networked Synchronization:** Multiple bulletin boards within a defined area synchronize their environmental profiles to create a consistent immersive experience.

**Pseudocode (Scene Activation):**

```
FUNCTION ActivateScene(badgeID, announcementID)

  // Retrieve user preferences
  userPreferences = GetUserPreferences(badgeID)

  // Retrieve announcement details
  announcementDetails = GetAnnouncementDetails(announcementID)

  // Determine scene ID based on announcement type & user preference
  sceneID = DetermineSceneID(announcementDetails, userPreferences)

  // Load scene profile
  sceneProfile = LoadSceneProfile(sceneID)

  // Read current environmental data
  currentTemp = ReadTemperature()
  currentHumidity = ReadHumidity()
  currentLightLevel = ReadLightLevel()

  // Calculate adjustments
  targetTemp = sceneProfile.temperature
  targetHumidity = sceneProfile.humidity
  targetLightColor = sceneProfile.lightColor
  targetLightIntensity = sceneProfile.lightIntensity

  // Apply adjustments (via actuators)
  SetTemperature(targetTemp)
  SetHumidity(targetHumidity)
  SetLightColor(targetLightColor)
  SetLightIntensity(targetLightIntensity)

  // Play associated audio (if any)
  PlayAudio(sceneProfile.audioFile)

  // Display visual announcement
  DisplayAnnouncement(announcementDetails.text)

END FUNCTION
