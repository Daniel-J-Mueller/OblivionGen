## Tactile Projection Mapping with Dynamic Resistance

**Concept:** A system that combines projected visuals with localized, dynamically adjustable resistance on a touchscreen surface, creating the sensation of interacting with 3D objects even with a flat display. This expands on the object recognition aspect of the patent by *creating* the objects, rather than simply responding to their presence.

**Specifications:**

*   **Display:** High-resolution, multi-touch touchscreen with integrated resistive force feedback (RFF) elements – a grid of micro-actuators beneath the surface. These actuators aren’t uniform; their density and range of force adjustment vary.
*   **Projection System:** Ultra-short throw projector precisely aligned to the touchscreen surface. Capable of high frame rate, keystone correction, and dynamic brightness/contrast adjustment.
*   **Object Library:** Database of 3D models with associated RFF profiles. These profiles dictate the force feedback required to simulate the tactile feel of each object.
*   **Real-Time Rendering Engine:** Software that renders the 3D model onto the projection surface, while simultaneously controlling the RFF grid to simulate its shape and texture.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Depth sensor (e.g., Time-of-Flight) to detect the user’s hand and fingers.
    *   Force sensors within the touchscreen to measure user interaction force.
    *   Optional: Haptic gloves for enhanced feedback (beyond the screen).

**Operation:**

1.  The system identifies the user's hand using the depth sensor.
2.  The user "touches" a projected object.
3.  The system activates the corresponding RFF elements beneath the contact point(s), increasing resistance to simulate the object's surface.
4.  The resistance is dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   The object’s material properties (e.g., hard, soft, bumpy).
    *   The user’s interaction force.
    *   The shape of the object (simulating edges, curves, and contours).
5.  As the user "moves" their hand across the object, the RFF elements are updated in real-time to maintain the illusion of physical interaction.

**Pseudocode (RFF Control Loop):**

```
FOR each contact point DO
    GET contact position (x, y)
    GET object shape data at (x, y)
    CALCULATE required resistance based on:
        object material properties
        contact force
        curvature of the object at (x, y)
    ACTIVATE corresponding RFF elements with calculated resistance
END FOR
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **3D Modeling/Sculpting:** Tactile feedback allows for precise manipulation of virtual objects.
*   **Medical Training:** Surgeons can practice procedures on realistic virtual anatomy.
*   **Gaming:** Immersive gaming experiences with realistic tactile feedback.
*   **Accessibility:** Providing tactile interfaces for visually impaired users.
*   **Remote Collaboration:** Manipulating shared virtual objects with a sense of physical presence.
