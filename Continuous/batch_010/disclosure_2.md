## Adaptive Environmental Storytelling via Biometric-Informed Wireless Signal Analysis

**Concept:** Expand the human activity detection system to create dynamically adapting environmental “stories” triggered by nuanced biometric data gleaned *from* the wireless signal analysis, not just activity *type*. Instead of simply turning on lights or playing music based on ‘movement’, create layered, contextually relevant environmental responses.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate data from the existing CSI analysis with passively collected biometric data inferred *from* the Wi-Fi signal. Focus on subtle signal distortions related to:
    *   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** Analyze minute fluctuations in signal phase and amplitude to estimate the user’s stress level or emotional state.
    *   **Breathing Rate:** Detect subtle cyclical variations in signal strength caused by chest movement.
    *   **Gait Analysis (Refined):** Go beyond ‘walking’ vs. ‘static’. Analyze signal patterns to determine speed, stride length, and even subtle changes in walking style indicating fatigue, injury, or mood.
*   **Biometric Model Training:** Utilize a separate machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network) trained on correlated biometric data (acquired via separate sensors during a calibration phase) and corresponding Wi-Fi signal features. This model translates CSI data into estimated biometric parameters.
*   **Environmental Story Engine:** A rule-based or script-driven engine that maps estimated biometric states to pre-defined environmental ‘stories’. Stories are sequences of environmental changes (lighting, sound, temperature, aroma diffusion) designed to evoke a specific emotional response or support a particular activity.
*   **Dynamic Story Adaptation:** The engine must continuously monitor biometric data and adapt the story in real-time based on the user’s evolving state.
*   **User Profiles:** Store user-specific preferences for story types, intensity levels, and desired environmental effects.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** All biometric data processing must be performed locally on the device (edge computing) to protect user privacy.  Data should be anonymized or encrypted before transmission to the cloud for model updates.

**Pseudocode (Story Engine):**

```
// Global variables
UserProfile user;
CurrentStory currentStory;
BiometricState currentBiometricState;

// Function: UpdateBiometricState
// Input: CSI Data
// Output: BiometricState
Function UpdateBiometricState(CSI_Data) {
  // Process CSI Data using Biometric Model
  BiometricState = BiometricModel.Predict(CSI_Data);
  return BiometricState;
}

// Function: SelectStory
// Input: BiometricState, UserProfile
// Output: Story
Function SelectStory(BiometricState, UserProfile) {
  If (BiometricState.StressLevel > ThresholdHigh && UserProfile.Preference == "Relaxation") {
    Story = "CalmingForest";
  } Else If (BiometricState.EnergyLevel < ThresholdLow && UserProfile.Preference == "Motivation") {
    Story = "EnergeticCity";
  } Else If (BiometricState.Mood == "Sad" && UserProfile.Preference == "Comfort") {
    Story = "CozyCabin";
  } Else {
    Story = "DefaultAmbient";
  }
  return Story;
}

// Function: ExecuteStory
// Input: Story
// Output: None
Function ExecuteStory(Story) {
  Switch (Story) {
    Case "CalmingForest":
      SetLighting("WarmDim");
      PlaySound("ForestAmbience");
      SetTemperature("Cool");
      DiffuseAroma("Lavender");
      Break;
    Case "EnergeticCity":
      SetLighting("BrightWhite");
      PlaySound("Cityscape");
      SetTemperature("Warm");
      Break;
    // Other story cases
    Default:
      SetLighting("Ambient");
      PlaySound("Silence");
  }
}

// Main Loop
While (True) {
  currentBiometricState = UpdateBiometricState(GetCSIData());
  currentStory = SelectStory(currentBiometricState, user);
  If (currentStory != previousStory) {
    ExecuteStory(currentStory);
    previousStory = currentStory;
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart Homes: Create adaptive living spaces that respond to the user's emotional and physical state.
*   Healthcare: Monitor patient stress levels and provide personalized relaxation therapies.
*   Wellness: Enhance meditation and mindfulness practices.
*   Retail: Create immersive shopping experiences that respond to customer mood.
