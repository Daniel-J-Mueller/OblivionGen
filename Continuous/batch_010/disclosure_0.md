## Dynamic Contextual Model Composition with Generative Pre-training

**Concept:** Extend the contextual model set with dynamically generated models, leveraging a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) to synthesize novel contextual representations. This moves beyond pre-defined stationary states to adaptively create models reflecting emerging user behaviors or content trends.

**Specifications:**

**1. GPT-Based Contextual Generator Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw user data stream (clickstream, demographics, device data, time of day, location, etc.).  A sliding window of recent interactions forms the input sequence.
*   **Model:** Fine-tuned GPT-3/4 model. Initial training corpus: historical user interaction data, content metadata, and any available external knowledge graphs.  Fine-tuning will focus on predicting optimal recommendation strategies given the input sequence.
*   **Output:**  A contextual embedding vector representing the input sequence.  This vector encapsulates a latent representation of the userâ€™s current state and preferences.  Also outputs a "novelty score" indicating how different this embedding is from existing contextual models (described below).

**2. Contextual Model Library & Similarity Metric:**

*   Existing contextual models (from the base patent) are stored in a library.
*   A cosine similarity metric is used to compare the embedding generated by the GPT module to the embeddings representing the existing contextual models.

**3. Dynamic Model Addition & Pruning:**

*   **Novelty Threshold:** A configurable threshold determines when the GPT-generated embedding is sufficiently different from existing models.
*   **Model Creation:** If the novelty score exceeds the threshold:
    *   A new contextual model is initialized.
    *   The GPT-generated embedding is used as the initial parameter set for this model (e.g., initial weights for a linear Thompson Sampling bandit).
    *   The new model is added to the contextual model library.
*   **Model Pruning:**  Implement a "recency and relevance" pruning scheme:
    *   Each model tracks its last activation time.
    *   Models that have not been activated for a predetermined period are considered for removal.
    *   Before removal, calculate a "contribution score" for the model based on its historical reward performance.
    *   Remove models with low contribution scores.

**4. Reward Signal Integration:**

*   Standard reward signals (clicks, purchases, engagement time) are used to update the parameters of each contextual model.
*   A "discovery reward" is added. This is a small reward given when a new, GPT-generated model is selected and provides a positive outcome. This incentivizes exploration of the generated models.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (user_request) {
  user_data = get_user_data()
  gpt_embedding, novelty_score = generate_embedding(user_data)

  // Similarity Search
  most_similar_model = find_most_similar_model(gpt_embedding)

  if (novelty_score > novelty_threshold) {
    new_model = initialize_new_model(gpt_embedding)
    add_model_to_library(new_model)
    selected_model = new_model
  } else {
    selected_model = most_similar_model
  }

  recommendation = selected_model.get_recommendation()
  reward = get_reward(recommendation, user_interaction)

  selected_model.update(reward)

  // Pruning (periodically)
  prune_models(model_library)
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   **GPT Model Selection:** Balance model size/performance with computational cost.
*   **Embedding Dimensionality:** Optimize embedding size for representation accuracy and efficiency.
*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with novelty thresholds, pruning parameters, and reward weights.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of contextual models and user requests.
*   **Computational Cost:** Evaluate the computational overhead of GPT inference and model updates.
