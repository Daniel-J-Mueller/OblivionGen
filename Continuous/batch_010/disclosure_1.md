## Temporal Key Sharding with Distributed Entropy

**Concept:** Expand upon the tree structure for key derivation not just for temporal expiration, but for *distributed* key access governed by time *and* quorum consensus. This creates a system where decryption requires both a key valid for the current time *and* agreement from a distributed set of key holders.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sharded Key Trees:** The core remains a tree structure for deriving cryptographic keys, however, each node in the tree is now *sharded*.  A node's key material isn't held by a single entity, but split into 'n' shares distributed among 'n' participants.

2.  **Temporal Validity per Share:** Each share *also* has a temporal validity window. A share valid from T1 to T2 might be useless outside that timeframe even if the quorum requirement is met. This combines temporal expiration *within* the distributed system.

3.  **Quorum-Based Reconstruction:**  To derive a key at any level of the tree (and thus decrypt), a minimum 'k' out of 'n' shares *valid for the current time* must be combined.  A key derivation function (KDF) is used to reconstruct the key material from the valid shares.

4.  **Dynamic Quorum Adjustment:** The 'k' (minimum shares) and 'n' (total shares) values can be dynamically adjusted based on risk assessment or security policy.  Higher security requires larger 'k' and/or 'n'.  Adjustments require a consensus mechanism.

5.  **Share Refresh & Rotation:** Shares are periodically refreshed/rotated (e.g., daily, weekly).  This isn't a full key rotation, but a re-issuance of shares. This enhances forward secrecy and limits exposure from compromised shares. New shares are derived from the parent node's key material (using a KDF) and distributed.

6.  **Time Source Synchronization:**  Participants need reasonably synchronized time sources. NTP or similar protocols are utilized.  The system is tolerant of minor time drifts, but significant divergence prevents share validity and decryption.

7.  **Share Escrow & Recovery:** A secure escrow mechanism exists to recover lost or compromised shares.  This doesn't grant immediate access but allows for key reconstitution after a pre-defined recovery process.

**Pseudocode (Share Derivation & Validation):**

```
// Function: DeriveShare(ParentKey, ShareID, TimeRange)
// Input: ParentKey (Key of the parent node), ShareID (Unique ID of the share), TimeRange (Validity timeframe)
// Output: Share (Encrypted share of the key material)
function DeriveShare(ParentKey, ShareID, TimeRange):
  Share = KDF(ParentKey, ShareID, TimeRange) // Derive share using KDF, incorporating TimeRange
  EncryptedShare = Encrypt(Share, ParticipantPublicKey) // Encrypt for the recipient
  return EncryptedShare

// Function: ValidateShare(EncryptedShare, ParticipantPrivateKey, CurrentTime)
// Input: EncryptedShare, ParticipantPrivateKey, CurrentTime
// Output: Share (decrypted), Valid (Boolean)
function ValidateShare(EncryptedShare, ParticipantPrivateKey, CurrentTime):
  Share = Decrypt(EncryptedShare, ParticipantPrivateKey)
  //Check TimeRange for the share
  if Share.TimeRange.Start <= CurrentTime <= Share.TimeRange.End:
    Valid = True
  else:
    Valid = False
  return Share, Valid
```

**System Architecture:**

*   **Key Management Server (KMS):** Responsible for tree structure management, share derivation, initial share distribution, and policy enforcement.
*   **Participant Nodes:** Hold shares, validate shares, and participate in key reconstruction.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:**  A distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, Paxos) used for dynamic quorum adjustment and escrow recovery.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   High-security data storage with distributed access control.
*   Secure multi-party computation.
*   Decentralized key escrow.
*   IoT device security.
