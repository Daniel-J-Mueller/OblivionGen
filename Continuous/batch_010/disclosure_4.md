**Dynamic Obfuscation Profiles & Behavioral Biometrics Integration**

**Concept:** Extend the password update mechanism to incorporate dynamic obfuscation algorithms *and* integrate behavioral biometrics to create a multi-layered authentication and security profile. Instead of simply switching between two algorithms, the system learns user behavior *and* adapts the obfuscation process dynamically.

**Specs:**

*   **Behavioral Data Capture Module:**
    *   Collects keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, rhythm).
    *   Tracks mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns).
    *   Monitors typing cadence (words per minute, pauses).
    *   Captures device orientation/movement (if applicable).
    *   Data is anonymized and stored locally/encrypted.
*   **Obfuscation Algorithm Pool:**  Maintain a pool of at least 5-10 distinct obfuscation algorithms (bcrypt, scrypt, Argon2, etc.). Each algorithm will be assigned a 'complexity score' and a 'resource cost'.
*   **Dynamic Profile Generator:**
    *   Analyzes the captured behavioral data.
    *   Creates a user-specific 'behavioral profile'.  (e.g., 'Fast Typer, Erratic Mouse').
    *   Based on the profile, dynamically selects an obfuscation algorithm from the pool.
    *   Algorithm selection prioritizes complexity and resource cost based on user profile. (e.g., 'Fast Typer' might trigger a more computationally intensive algorithm).
*   **Adaptive Obfuscation:**
    *   The selected algorithm is used for initial password hashing *and* for subsequent updates.
    *   The system continuously monitors behavioral data during login attempts.
    *   If deviations from the established behavioral profile are detected (e.g., unusually slow typing), the system can:
        *   Increase the number of iterations/rounds of the obfuscation algorithm.
        *   Introduce a secondary, independent obfuscation layer.
        *   Trigger multi-factor authentication.
*   **'Shadow' Profile:** Maintain a secondary 'shadow' behavioral profile. This profile is built from data collected during known legitimate sessions. Used as a baseline for anomaly detection.
*   **Periodic Re-profiling:**  The system should periodically re-profile the user (e.g., every 30 days) to account for changes in typing habits or device usage.
*   **Pseudocode (Login Sequence):**

```
function login(username, password) {
  // 1. Capture Behavioral Data during password entry
  behavioralData = captureBehavioralData();

  // 2. Load User Profile
  userProfile = loadUserProfile(username);

  // 3. Calculate Anomaly Score
  anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(behavioralData, userProfile);

  // 4. Select Obfuscation Algorithm
  obfuscationAlgorithm = selectObfuscationAlgorithm(anomalyScore, userProfile);

  // 5. Obfuscate Password
  obfuscatedPassword = obfuscatePassword(password, obfuscationAlgorithm);

  // 6. Compare with Stored Password
  if (comparePasswords(obfuscatedPassword, storedPassword)) {
    // Login Successful
    return true;
  } else {
    // Login Failed
    return false;
  }
}
```

*   **Data Storage:** Secure, encrypted storage for behavioral profiles and obfuscated passwords.  Consider a hardware security module (HSM) for key management.
