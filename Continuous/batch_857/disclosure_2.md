## Adaptive Data Sharding for Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the edge data caching concept to incorporate predictive sharding based on anticipated function execution patterns *before* a request even arrives. This moves beyond reactive caching to proactive data preparation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE):**
   *   **Input:** Historical edge function execution logs (function ID, tables accessed, filter criteria, request patterns, time of day, geo-location).
   *   **Processing:** Utilize machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, Markov chains, deep learning) to predict the probability of specific functions being triggered within defined time windows.  Model should account for seasonality, trends, and correlations between functions.
   *   **Output:**  “Prefetch Schedules” – prioritized lists of functions and associated data shards (tables/partitions) to proactively load at edge locations.  Schedule includes a confidence score.

**2.  Dynamic Data Sharding:**
   *   **Origin Server Modification:**  Databases are structured with the ability to define "logical shards" – subsets of data defined by function requirements.  A mapping table associates functions with these shards.
   *   **Sharding Granularity:** Support variable sharding granularity – from entire tables to specific partitions/rows based on access patterns and filter criteria.

**3.  Edge Prefetch Agent (EPA):**
   *   **Input:** Prefetch Schedules from PAE.
   *   **Processing:**
        *   EPA receives the Prefetch Schedule and prioritizes data requests.
        *   EPA requests relevant data shards from the origin server.
        *   EPA stores shards in a dedicated "Prefetch Cache" at the edge location, separate from the reactive cache.
        *   EPA monitors resource utilization (CPU, memory, bandwidth) and dynamically adjusts prefetch rates.
   *   **Output:** Populated Prefetch Cache.

**4.  Function Execution Redirection:**
   *   **Edge Server Logic:**  When a function is triggered:
        *   First, check if the required data is present in the Prefetch Cache.
        *   If found, immediately load data from Prefetch Cache into function’s execution environment.
        *   If not found, fall back to accessing data from the reactive cache (or origin server if necessary).

**Pseudocode (EPA):**

```
function processPrefetchSchedule(schedule) {
  for each function_entry in schedule {
    function_id = function_entry.function_id
    shard_list = function_entry.shard_list
    confidence = function_entry.confidence

    if (confidence > threshold) { //Filter out low-confidence predictions
      for each shard in shard_list {
        requestData(shard) //Asynchronously request data from origin
      }
    }
  }
}

function requestData(shard) {
  //Send request to origin server for shard
  //Handle response (store in Prefetch Cache)
  //Monitor resource usage
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Prefetch Schedule:**  `[{function_id: string, shard_list: [string], confidence: float}]`
*   **Shard Mapping Table (Origin Server):** `{function_id: [shard_id]}`

**Considerations:**

*   **Cache Invalidation:**  Implement mechanisms to invalidate prefetched data when underlying data changes at the origin server.
*   **Resource Management:**  Carefully manage resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) to avoid overwhelming edge locations.
*   **Cold Start:**  Address the cold start problem by starting with a conservative prefetch strategy and gradually adapting to observed access patterns.
*   **Security:** Ensure data is securely transferred and stored at edge locations.
