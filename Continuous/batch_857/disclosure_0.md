## Dynamic Autoencoder Specialization via Federated Learning

**Concept:** Extend the anomaly detection system with the ability to dynamically specialize autoencoders for different *subsets* of users or system components, leveraging federated learning techniques. Instead of a single, monolithic autoencoder, maintain a collection of specialized models.

**Rationale:** A global autoencoder trained on all data may struggle to accurately model the nuanced behavior of individual users or the complex interactions within specific system components. Federated learning allows for the creation of specialized models *without* centralizing sensitive data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Federated Learning Infrastructure:**

*   **Nodes:** Each ‘node’ represents a user, system component (e.g., database server, authentication service), or a defined group of these.
*   **Local Training:** Each node maintains a local copy of the base autoencoder architecture. They train this model *only* on data generated by their associated user/component.
*   **Aggregation Server:** A central server responsible for aggregating model updates. It *does not* have access to the raw data from the nodes.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A secure communication channel between nodes and the aggregation server. Differential privacy techniques should be integrated to further protect data.

**2. Autoencoder Architecture:**

*   **Base Architecture:** The core autoencoder architecture (encoder & decoder) remains consistent across all nodes.  This could be a Variational Autoencoder or a Wasserstein Autoencoder as described in the patent.
*   **Adaptation Layers:** Add a small number of *adaptation layers* (e.g., fully connected layers) *after* the encoder and *before* the latent space, and similarly after the latent space and before the decoder. These layers are the *only* parameters trained locally on each node. This minimizes the amount of information shared during aggregation.
*   **Latent Space Dimensionality:** Maintain a consistent latent space dimensionality across all nodes.

**3. Training Process:**

1.  **Initialization:** All nodes start with a copy of the pre-trained base autoencoder.
2.  **Local Training Round:**
    *   Each node collects a batch of its local data.
    *   The node trains *only* the adaptation layers using the local data and a standard loss function (e.g., MSE, KL divergence).
    *   The node calculates the weight updates for the adaptation layers.
3.  **Aggregation Round:**
    *   Each node sends its weight updates to the aggregation server.
    *   The aggregation server averages the weight updates received from all nodes.
    *   The aggregation server sends the averaged weight updates back to all nodes.
    *   Each node applies the averaged weight updates to its local adaptation layers.
4.  **Repeat Steps 2-3:** Iterate the training process for a defined number of rounds.

**4. Anomaly Detection:**

*   **Node Selection:**  When a request arrives, determine the appropriate node to use for anomaly detection based on the user ID or the component that generated the request.
*   **Local Anomaly Score:**  Use the locally trained autoencoder on the selected node to generate a normalcy score for the request, as described in the patent.
*   **Thresholding & Action:** Compare the normalcy score to a threshold and take appropriate action (allow, block, flag) as before.

**Pseudocode (Local Training):**

```
function local_train(local_data, autoencoder, learning_rate):
  for batch in local_data:
    encoded = autoencoder.encoder(batch)
    decoded = autoencoder.decoder(encoded)
    loss = calculate_loss(decoded, batch)
    gradients = calculate_gradients(loss, autoencoder.adaptation_layers)
    update_adaptation_layers(autoencoder.adaptation_layers, gradients, learning_rate)
  return autoencoder.adaptation_layers
```

**Pseudocode (Aggregation):**

```
function aggregate_updates(adaptation_layers_list):
  total_weights = [0] * len(adaptation_layers_list[0])
  for layers in adaptation_layers_list:
    for i in range(len(layers)):
      total_weights[i] += layers[i]
  averaged_weights = [w / len(adaptation_layers_list) for w in total_weights]
  return averaged_weights
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Accuracy:** Specialized models can capture more nuanced behavior, leading to fewer false positives and false negatives.
*   **Enhanced Privacy:** Data remains localized, reducing the risk of data breaches and compliance issues.
*   **Scalability:** Federated learning allows the system to scale to a large number of users and components without requiring centralized data storage.
*   **Adaptability:** The system can adapt to changing behavior patterns over time.
