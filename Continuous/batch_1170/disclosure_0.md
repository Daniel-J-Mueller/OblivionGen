## Adaptive Contextual Event Generation & Projection

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple attribution events tied to location to create a predictive system for user *needs* based on projected future locations and behaviors. This isn’t just *where* someone is, but *where they are likely to go*, and anticipating needs *before* they materialize.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   GPS data (current and historical) - as in the patent.
    *   Calendar data (with user permission).
    *   App usage data (with user permission) – frequency, duration, type.
    *   Ambient sensor data – weather, time of day, noise levels.
    *   Purchasing history (with user permission).
*   **Core Processing – Predictive Engine:**
    *   **Behavioral Modeling:**  Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) - specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to learn user routines.  The LSTM will process historical location, calendar, app usage, and sensor data.
    *   **Location Projection:** The LSTM will predict future locations with associated probabilities.  Output: a probability distribution over potential locations for the next X hours.  X configurable by the user.
    *   **Need Inference:**  A separate rule-based or machine learning system (trained on a large dataset of contextual scenarios) will infer potential needs at projected locations.  Examples:
        *   Projected location = coffee shop, time = 8:00 AM ->  need = coffee/breakfast.
        *   Projected location = airport, time = 6:00 PM -> need = transportation, food, entertainment.
        *   Calendar event = meeting at new office location, time = 10:00 AM -> need = directions, parking information.
    *   **Event Generation:** Create "proactive events" - not just what the user *did*, but what they *might* need.  These events are similar to the "attribution events" in the source patent, but forward-looking.
*   **Data Output & Action:**
    *   **Proactive Notifications:**  Send notifications *before* the user reaches the projected location.  Example: “Traffic is heavy on your route to the coffee shop.  Want us to order your usual drink for pickup?”
    *   **Automated Services:**  Initiate services automatically. Example: Automatically request a ride-share when the user is projected to be at the airport.
    *   **Contextual Advertising:**  Deliver targeted ads based on predicted needs.  Example:  Show ads for nearby restaurants when the user is projected to be hungry. (User configurable opt-in)
    *    **Privacy Safeguards:**
        *   All predictions and need inferences are performed *on-device*.
        *   Only aggregated, anonymized data is sent to the server for model improvement.
        *   Users have full control over data sharing and can disable predictions at any time.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Prediction Loop):**

```
function predict_next_location(user_data, time_horizon):
  historical_data = user_data.get_historical_data()
  calendar_data = user_data.get_calendar_data()
  app_usage_data = user_data.get_app_usage_data()
  sensor_data = user_data.get_sensor_data()

  lstm_input = combine_data(historical_data, calendar_data, app_usage_data, sensor_data)
  predicted_probabilities = lstm_model.predict(lstm_input, time_horizon)

  top_n_locations = get_top_n_locations(predicted_probabilities, n=5)
  return top_n_locations

function infer_needs(location, time):
  # Rule-based or ML model to infer needs based on location and time
  needs = need_inference_model.predict(location, time)
  return needs

function generate_proactive_event(location, needs):
  event = {
    "type": "proactive",
    "location": location,
    "needs": needs
  }
  return event
```

**Refinement & Expansion:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Incorporate other data streams, such as social media activity, voice commands, and biometric data.
*   **Personalized Models:** Train separate LSTM models for each user to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Dynamic Learning:** Continuously update the LSTM models with new data to adapt to changing user behavior.
*   **"What-If" Scenarios:**  Allow users to explore different scenarios and see how their predicted needs might change.  Example: "What if I leave for the airport 30 minutes earlier?"
