## Dynamic File Contextualization & Collaborative Annotation Layer

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple file sharing and link insertion to create a persistent, context-aware collaborative annotation layer *around* shared files, accessible directly within the messaging interface, regardless of the file's original location. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Data Structure – The “File Context”:**

*   Each shared file will be associated with a “File Context” object. This is *not* just metadata.
*   Fields:
    *   `file_id`: Unique identifier for the file (original location agnostic).
    *   `file_name`: Original file name.
    *   `file_type`: MIME type.
    *   `owner_id`: User ID of the file originator.
    *   `access_list`: Permissions (read, write, comment) for different users/groups.
    *   `annotation_stream`:  Time-ordered list of annotations (see annotation object below).
    *   `context_tags`: User-defined tags for categorization (e.g., "Project Alpha," "Q3 Report").
    *   `linked_files`: List of `file_id`s of related files.
    *   `version_history`: Tracks changes to the `File Context` itself (access permissions, tags, etc.).

**2. Annotation Object:**

*   `annotation_id`: Unique ID.
*   `user_id`: User who created the annotation.
*   `timestamp`: Creation time.
*   `annotation_type`: (Text highlight, freehand drawing, sticky note, question, task).
*   `content`: Annotation text/data.
*   `location`: Precise location within the file (e.g., page number, timestamp in video, coordinates in image).
*   `replies`: Threaded list of replies to the annotation.
*   `status`: (Open, Resolved, In Progress).

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Messaging Client Integration:**  A plugin/extension for existing messaging clients (Slack, Teams, Email).
*   **Context Service:** A central server responsible for managing `File Context` objects and annotations. This service *does not* store the files themselves; it only stores metadata and annotations.
*   **File Access Adapters:**  Connectors to various file storage services (SharePoint, Google Drive, Dropbox, local file systems). These adapters retrieve files on demand.
*   **Real-time Collaboration Engine:**  WebSockets or similar technology to enable simultaneous annotation and viewing of files.
*   **File Preview Renderer:**  A service capable of rendering previews of various file types within the messaging client.

**4. User Workflow:**

1.  **Share File:** User selects “Share with Context” option in messaging client.
2.  **Context Creation:** System creates a `File Context` object.
3.  **Access Control:** User defines access permissions for other users/groups.
4.  **File Access:** When a user clicks on the shared file link, the messaging client requests the file from the Context Service.
5.  **File Retrieval:** Context Service uses the appropriate File Access Adapter to retrieve the file.
6.  **Collaborative Viewing & Annotation:** Users can view the file and add annotations directly within the messaging client. Annotations are synchronized in real-time.
7.  **Contextual Search:**  Users can search for files based on tags, annotations, or content.

**5. Pseudocode (Key Functions):**

```pseudocode
function shareFileWithContext(file, accessList, tags):
  fileContext = createNewFileContext(file, accessList, tags)
  saveFileContext(fileContext)
  generateLink(fileContext) // Link points to Context Service

function openFileContext(link):
  fileContext = retrieveFileContext(link)
  file = retrieveFile(fileContext) // Use File Access Adapter
  displayFileWithAnnotations(file, fileContext)

function addAnnotation(fileContext, user, annotationType, content, location):
  annotation = createNewAnnotation(user, annotationType, content, location)
  appendAnnotationToStream(fileContext, annotation)
  broadcastAnnotationToViewers(fileContext)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple file sharing and link insertion to create a persistent, collaborative *context* around files, independent of their original location. The annotation layer is deeply integrated into the messaging experience, fostering real-time collaboration and knowledge sharing. It's not just *accessing* a file; it's participating in a shared understanding *around* the file.
