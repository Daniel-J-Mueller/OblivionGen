## Adaptive Resonance Tagging System – ARTs

**Concept:** Leverage the existing directional antenna & camera infrastructure to create an individualized, dynamic “resonance profile” for each user within a facility, going beyond simple presence detection to infer emotional state & intent. This shifts from “knowing *where* someone is” to “understanding *what* someone is likely to do”.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Enhanced Antenna Array:** Existing phased antenna arrays augmented with frequency modulation capabilities.  Transmit subtle, individualized carrier wave frequencies alongside the ID signal. These are extremely low power, and intended to create minor interference patterns detectable by a user’s personal devices.
*   **High-Resolution Multi-Spectral Cameras:** Existing cameras upgraded with near-infrared and polarization filters for subtle skin tone and micro-expression analysis. Increased frame rates are required for real-time analysis.
*   **Edge Processing Units:** Distributed computing nodes co-located with antenna/camera arrays to perform initial data processing and feature extraction. 
*   **Central Server Cluster:**  High-performance computing cluster for data fusion, resonance profile construction, and predictive modeling.
*   **Personal Device Integration (Optional):**  SDK for users to opt-in to allow data from their smartphones/wearables (accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate) to contribute to their resonance profile.  Data is anonymized and aggregated.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Resonance Profile Builder:** Algorithm to create a multi-dimensional profile for each user based on:
    *   **Antenna Resonance Data:**  Analysis of signal reflections & interference patterns to infer body posture & subtle movements.  Treat the body as a resonant cavity.
    *   **Visual Data:** Facial expression recognition, gait analysis, body language interpretation.
    *   **Sensor Data (Optional):** Integration of accelerometer, gyroscope, heart rate data to build a holistic profile.
    *   **Temporal Data:**  Tracking changes in resonance & visual patterns over time.  Detect anomalies.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
    *   **Behavioral Prediction:**  Use the resonance profile to predict a user’s likely path & actions within the facility.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Flag unusual behavior patterns that deviate from the user's established profile.  Potentially indicate distress, confusion, or malicious intent.
    *   **Emotional State Inference:**  Estimate a user's emotional state (e.g., stress, fatigue, excitement) based on micro-expressions, gait, and resonance patterns.
*   **Data Fusion Engine:**  Combines antenna, visual, and sensor data to create a unified representation of each user.
*   **API:**  Provides access to resonance profiles, predictive models, and anomaly detection alerts for integration with other systems (e.g., security, customer service, building management).

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Function: DetectAnomaly
// Input: resonanceProfile, currentData, threshold
// Output: Boolean (True if anomaly detected, False otherwise)

Function DetectAnomaly(resonanceProfile, currentData, threshold)
    // 1. Extract features from currentData (antenna, visual, sensor)
    features = ExtractFeatures(currentData)

    // 2. Calculate distance between current features and resonanceProfile
    distance = CalculateDistance(features, resonanceProfile)

    // 3. Compare distance to threshold
    If distance > threshold Then
        Return True  // Anomaly detected
    Else
        Return False // No anomaly detected
    End If
End Function

// Helper function: CalculateDistance
// Input: featureVector1, featureVector2
// Output: Distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance)
Function CalculateDistance(featureVector1, featureVector2)
    // Implement distance calculation algorithm
    // Return distance value
End Function
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Identify potential threats based on anomalous behavior patterns.
*   **Proactive Customer Service:**  Anticipate customer needs and provide personalized assistance.
*   **Building Optimization:**  Adjust environmental settings based on user preferences and activity levels.
*   **Healthcare Monitoring:**  Detect signs of distress or medical emergencies.
*   **Retail Analytics:**  Understand shopper behavior and optimize store layout.
