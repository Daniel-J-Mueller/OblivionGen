## Autonomous Workspace Reconfiguration System

**System Overview:** A system leveraging the cleanup robot’s navigation and manipulation capabilities to dynamically reconfigure workspace layouts based on real-time operational needs.

**Core Components:**

*   **Cleanup Robot (Modified):** Existing platform augmented with:
    *   **Modular Attachment Interface:** Standardized mechanical/electrical interface to accept various modular tools (see below).
    *   **High-Precision Localization:** Enhanced sensor suite (LiDAR, IMU, visual odometry) for sub-centimeter localization accuracy.
    *   **Force/Torque Sensors:** Integrated into the carrying tray and gate mechanisms for delicate manipulation.
*   **Modular Tools:** Interchangeable tools for specialized tasks:
    *   **Mobile Workstation Module:** A flat, stable platform that attaches to the carrying tray, creating a mobile workbench.
    *   **Component Delivery Module:** A small, secure compartment for transporting small parts or tools.
    *   **Lightweight Barrier Module:** Deployable physical barriers (e.g., expandable mesh) to quickly cordon off areas.
    *   **Projection Module:** Projects temporary guidance markers, safety zones, or instructions onto the floor.
*   **Central Control System (Enhanced):**
    *   **Workspace Modeling:** Digital twin of the warehouse layout.
    *   **Task Assignment:** Algorithms to optimize robot task assignments based on operational needs.
    *   **Dynamic Path Planning:** Real-time path planning considering obstacles, robot capabilities, and task priorities.
    *   **User Interface:** Intuitive interface for operators to request workspace reconfigurations.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** Operator requests a workspace reconfiguration via the user interface (e.g., “Create a temporary inspection zone near bay 4”).
2.  **Planning & Assignment:** Central control system:
    *   Analyzes the request.
    *   Identifies necessary tools/modules.
    *   Assigns the task to a cleanup robot.
    *   Generates a dynamic path plan.
3.  **Tool Acquisition:** Robot navigates to a central tooling station and automatically attaches the required modules.
4.  **Workspace Modification:** Robot navigates to the designated area and performs the requested modification:
    *   **Creating Inspection Zones:** Deploys barrier modules and projection modules to define the zone.
    *   **Relocating Components:** Transports small parts or tools using the component delivery module.
    *   **Setting up Temporary Workstations:** Deploys the mobile workstation module.
5.  **Confirmation & Feedback:** Robot transmits confirmation of task completion to the central control system. Operator receives feedback via the user interface.

**Pseudocode (Task Assignment):**

```
FUNCTION AssignWorkspaceTask(taskRequest, robotList, toolingStation)
  // Input: taskRequest (description of task), robotList (available robots), toolingStation (location)
  // Output: assignedRobot, taskPlan

  // 1. Determine required tools based on taskRequest
  requiredTools = DetermineTools(taskRequest)

  // 2. Filter robots capable of handling required tools
  capableRobots = FilterRobots(robotList, requiredTools)

  // 3. If no capable robots, signal error
  IF (capableRobots.length == 0)
    RETURN (ERROR, "No capable robots available")

  // 4. Select robot based on proximity to task location and current workload
  assignedRobot = SelectRobot(capableRobots, taskLocation)

  // 5. Generate task plan (route to tooling station, acquire tools, navigate to task location, execute task)
  taskPlan = GenerateTaskPlan(assignedRobot, taskLocation, requiredTools)

  // 6. Assign task to robot
  assignedRobot.AssignTask(taskPlan)

  RETURN (assignedRobot, taskPlan)
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Dynamic adaptation to changing production requirements.
*   Rapid deployment of safety barriers during emergencies.
*   On-demand creation of temporary assembly stations.
*   Optimized workflow through reconfigurable workspace layouts.
