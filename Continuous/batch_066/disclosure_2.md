## Multi-Modal Anomaly Detection – Biofeedback Integration & Predictive Alert System

**System Overview:** This design expands the multi-modal anomaly detection system to incorporate real-time biofeedback data from the subject being scanned, creating a predictive alert system for health anomalies *before* they manifest as clear image-based anomalies. It moves beyond simply identifying anomalies in images to anticipating them.

**Core Innovation:** Predictive Anomaly Scoring – Leveraging biofeedback as an early warning system.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Multi-Modal Sensor Array:**  Existing system’s image sensors (surface & subcutaneous) + real-time biofeedback sensors. These include:
    *   Electrocardiogram (ECG) – Heart rate variability.
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) – Sweat gland activity.
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) – Blood volume pulse.
    *   Respiration Rate Sensor – Breathing pattern analysis.
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** High-performance embedded processor to handle sensor data fusion and preliminary analysis.  Must support simultaneous processing of image and biofeedback data streams.
*   **Communication Module:** Wireless (Bluetooth 5.0 or Wi-Fi 6) for data transmission to central server/cloud.
*   **Haptic Feedback Unit:** Small vibratory motor for localized alerts (optional, for user notification).

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Data Acquisition Module:** Real-time capture of image data (from existing system) and biofeedback data. Synchronization is critical.
*   **Feature Extraction Module:** 
    *   Image Features: Existing embedding module.
    *   Biofeedback Features: Time-domain (mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) and frequency-domain (power spectral density) analysis of each biofeedback signal. Wavelet transforms for transient event detection.
*   **Anomaly Scoring Module:** This is the core of the innovation.
    1.  **Baseline Establishment:**  During a calibration phase, the system establishes personalized baselines for both image-based and biofeedback features.  Uses a sliding window approach to account for natural fluctuations.
    2.  **Biofeedback Anomaly Detection:** A separate anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Autoencoder, One-Class SVM) is trained on the biofeedback features.  This detects deviations from the established baseline.  Outputs a 'Biofeedback Anomaly Score' (BAS) ranging from 0 to 1.
    3.  **Image Feature Correlation:** The system analyzes the correlation between the BAS and the image-based embedding vectors. This helps to identify potential precursors to visible anomalies.
    4.  **Fused Anomaly Score:**  Combines the BAS and the image-based anomaly score using a weighted sum:
        *   `Final Anomaly Score = (w1 * Image Anomaly Score) + (w2 * BAS)`
        *   `w1` and `w2` are adjustable weights optimized through machine learning.
    5.  **Predictive Alerting:** If the `Final Anomaly Score` exceeds a predefined threshold, the system generates a predictive alert. The alert can be visual, auditory, or haptic.

*   **Machine Learning Module:**
    *   **Weight Optimization:**  Reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to dynamically adjust `w1` and `w2` based on real-world data and user feedback.
    *   **Personalized Modeling:**  Machine learning models trained on individual subject data to improve the accuracy of anomaly detection and prediction.

**Pseudocode - Anomaly Scoring Module:**

```
// Inputs: Image Embedding Vector (image_vec), Biofeedback Features (bio_features),
//         Baseline Biofeedback Features (baseline_bio), Weight w1, w2, Anomaly Threshold

// Calculate Biofeedback Anomaly Score (BAS)
bas = CalculateBiofeedbackAnomalyScore(bio_features, baseline_bio)

// Calculate Image Anomaly Score (IAS) - using existing system's classification
ias = CalculateImageAnomalyScore(image_vec)

// Calculate Fused Anomaly Score
fused_score = (w1 * ias) + (w2 * bas)

// Generate Alert
if fused_score > AnomalyThreshold:
    GenerateAlert("Potential Anomaly Detected")
else:
    // No alert
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Preventative Healthcare:** Early detection of health issues before they become critical.
*   **Stress Monitoring:**  Detecting stress levels and providing real-time feedback.
*   **Security Applications:**  Identifying potential threats based on physiological responses.
