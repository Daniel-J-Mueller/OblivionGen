## Adaptive Resource Allocation Based on Predicted User Engagement

**Concept:** Extend the idea of prioritizing processes based on importance to a dynamic system predicting user engagement *with* those processes, not just their raw memory usage. This allows for preemptive resource allocation *before* a process is starved, aiming for a smoother user experience.

**Specification:**

1.  **Engagement Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time process metrics (CPU, memory, network), historical user interaction data (application usage frequency, feature usage patterns, time-of-day usage), and predictive models trained on these datasets.
    *   Function: Predict the likelihood of a user interacting with a given process within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 5 seconds, 30 seconds). Outputs a "Engagement Score" between 0-100 for each process.
    *   Model Training: Utilize machine learning techniques (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks) to learn user patterns and predict engagement.  Models are continuously refined with ongoing usage data.  Personalized models are maintained per user profile.

2.  **Dynamic Priority Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Engagement Score from the Engagement Prediction Module, Current Process Priority, System Resource Availability (memory, CPU).
    *   Function: Adjusts process priority dynamically based on a weighted formula:
        *   `Adjusted Priority = Base Priority + (Engagement Score * Engagement Weight) – (Memory Usage * Memory Weight)`
        *   `Engagement Weight` and `Memory Weight` are configurable parameters, potentially user-adjustable or dynamically tuned by the system. Higher `Engagement Weight` favors processes the user is likely to interact with.
        *   The `Adjusted Priority` is then applied to the process scheduler.
    *   Process grouping: Link processes by “engagement family” – grouping related application features so that engagement with one affects the priority of others.

3.  **Preemptive Resource Allocation:**
    *   Input: Adjusted Priority, System Resource Availability.
    *   Function:  Allocates a small "engagement buffer" of resources (memory, CPU cycles) to processes with high Adjusted Priority, even if those resources aren’t immediately required.  This preemptive allocation prevents resource contention and ensures a responsive user experience.
    *   Resource "Lease": The allocated resources are held on a “lease” basis. If the user doesn’t interact with the process within a defined timeframe, the resources are released and made available to other processes.

4.  **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor user actions (application launches, feature usage, window switching).
    *   Use these actions to refine the Engagement Prediction Module's models and adjust the `Engagement Weight` and `Memory Weight` parameters.
    *   Provide optional user controls to manually adjust process priorities or disable the dynamic resource allocation feature.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Priority Adjustment):**

```
function adjustPriority(process, engagementScore, memoryUsage, basePriority, engagementWeight, memoryWeight):
  adjustedPriority = basePriority + (engagementScore * engagementWeight) - (memoryUsage * memoryWeight)
  # Clamp adjustedPriority to a valid range (e.g., 0-100)
  adjustedPriority = clamp(adjustedPriority, 0, 100)
  setProcessPriority(process, adjustedPriority)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Sufficient processing power to run the Engagement Prediction Module and adjust process priorities in real-time.
*   Sufficient memory to store historical usage data and predictive models.
*   Operating system support for dynamic process priority adjustment.
*   User profile management system.
*   Data analytics infrastructure for training and refining predictive models.
