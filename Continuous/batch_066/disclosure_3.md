## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction for Personalized Echo Cancellation

**Concept:** Augment the existing multi-layer echo cancellation system with a dynamic acoustic scene reconstruction module. This module will build a real-time, localized 3D acoustic map of the communication environment, factoring in room geometry, materials, and the positions of sound sources (speakers, microphones, and potentially other objects/people). This map then informs the neural network weights, providing a significantly more precise and personalized echo cancellation experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate data from multiple sources:
    *   Microphone Array: Existing microphones for initial sound capture.
    *   Depth Camera (ToF or Structured Light): Provides real-time room geometry and object positioning. (e.g., Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect)
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):  Tracks head/device movement for accurate positioning within the acoustic scene.
*   **Acoustic Scene Reconstruction Module:**
    1.  **Data Fusion:** Combine depth camera, IMU, and microphone array data. Use sensor fusion algorithms (Kalman filtering, Extended Kalman filtering) to create a coherent representation of the environment.
    2.  **Ray Tracing/Acoustic Simulation:** Implement a simplified real-time ray tracing or acoustic simulation engine.  This engine uses the reconstructed 3D map to model sound propagation, reflections, and diffraction.
    3.  **Acoustic Feature Extraction:** Extract acoustic features from the simulated sound field:
        *   Reverberation Time (RT60) - local
        *   Early Reflection Patterns - local
        *   Sound Pressure Level (SPL) at Microphone Positions
*   **Neural Network Integration:**
    1.  **Feature Embedding:**  Embed the extracted acoustic features (RT60, reflection patterns, SPL) into a feature vector.
    2.  **Weight Modulation:**  Use the feature vector to dynamically modulate the weights of both the non-linear and linear layers of the existing echo cancellation neural networks. This modulation can be implemented using techniques like:
        *   **Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM):**  Scale and shift the activations of each layer based on the feature vector.
        *   **Conditional Batch Normalization:**  Adjust the batch normalization parameters based on the feature vector.
        *   **Attention Mechanisms:** Use attention to focus on specific parts of the acoustic scene that contribute most to the echo.
*   **Training:**
    1.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** Create a large dataset of synthetic acoustic scenes with varying geometries, materials, and sound source positions.
    2.  **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to train the weight modulation module. The reward function should encourage accurate echo cancellation and minimize distortion.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) or GPU for real-time acoustic scene reconstruction and neural network inference.
    *   Sufficient RAM for storing the 3D acoustic map and intermediate data.

**Pseudocode (Weight Modulation - FiLM Example):**

```
// Input: Activation 'a' from a neural network layer
//        Feature Vector 'f' from Acoustic Scene Reconstruction
//        Learned Scale and Shift Parameters 'gamma', 'beta'

// Apply FiLM modulation
modulated_a = gamma * a + beta

// gamma and beta are learned parameters adjusted during training
// based on the feature vector 'f' – could be a simple linear layer
gamma = linear_layer(f)
beta = linear_layer(f)

// Output: modulated_a – the modulated activation
```

**Novelty:**

Existing echo cancellation systems typically assume a static acoustic environment. This system dynamically adapts to changes in the environment, providing a more robust and personalized experience. The use of 3D acoustic scene reconstruction and neural network weight modulation is a novel approach to echo cancellation.  The system would be particularly valuable in dynamic environments like open-plan offices, video conferencing in varying rooms, and for users with assistive listening devices.
