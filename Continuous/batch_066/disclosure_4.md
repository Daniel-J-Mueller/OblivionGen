## Transactional Data Provenance & Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the log-based transaction system to not only verify constraints *during* transaction commit, but to create a cryptographically verifiable “data provenance” record for *every* data element impacted by a transaction. This provenance record acts as a tamper-proof audit trail and enables attestation of data integrity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Provenance Log:** A parallel log to the existing transaction log.  This log stores, for each transaction:
    *   Transaction ID (linking to the primary transaction log)
    *   Timestamp
    *   User/Actor ID (initiating the transaction)
    *   Affected Data Element IDs (unique identifiers for each piece of data – could be row IDs, object keys, etc.)
    *   Data Element Hash (SHA-256 or similar – of the *previous* state of the data element *before* the transaction)
    *   Change Signature:  A cryptographic signature of the *delta* (changes) applied to the data element. This could be a digital signature or a Merkle tree root representing the changes.
    *   Attestation Authority Signature (optional):  A signature by a trusted third party verifying the transaction’s legitimacy.

*   **Data Element Tracking:** Each data element must have a mechanism to link it to its provenance records in the Provenance Log. This could be embedded metadata, a sidecar file, or a separate index.

*   **Attestation Service:** A service to verify the integrity of data by reconstructing its history from the Provenance Log. This service would:
    *   Retrieve the current state of the data element.
    *   Retrieve the Provenance Log entries for that data element (ordered by timestamp).
    *   Apply the changes (from the Change Signature) to the initial data state, step-by-step, verifying each signature against the expected hash of the previous state.
    *   Report any discrepancies or signature failures.

*   **API Extensions:**
    *   `LogTransaction(transaction_data, delta_signature)`:  Extended function to write to both the primary transaction log *and* the Provenance Log.
    *   `VerifyDataIntegrity(data_element_id)`:  Returns a boolean indicating whether the data element's integrity has been verified from its Provenance Log.
    *   `GetProvenanceHistory(data_element_id)`:  Returns a list of Provenance Log entries for a given data element.

**Pseudocode (VerifyDataIntegrity):**

```
function VerifyDataIntegrity(data_element_id):
  current_data = GetData(data_element_id)
  provenance_entries = GetProvenanceHistory(data_element_id) // Sorted by timestamp

  if provenance_entries is empty:
    return true // No history, assume valid

  initial_data = GetInitialData(provenance_entries[0]) // Retrieve data from initial hash

  for entry in provenance_entries:
    expected_hash = hash(initial_data)
    if entry.expected_hash != expected_hash:
      print("Hash mismatch")
      return false

    if not verify_signature(entry.change_signature, initial_data):
      print("Signature invalid")
      return false

    initial_data = apply_changes(initial_data, entry.change_signature)

  // Compare reconstructed data with current data
  if hash(initial_data) != hash(current_data):
      print("Reconstructed data does not match current data")
      return false

  return true
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Auditing & Compliance:**  Provide a tamper-proof audit trail for regulatory compliance.
*   **Data Integrity Validation:**  Detect data corruption or unauthorized modifications.
*   **Supply Chain Tracking:**  Track the provenance of data throughout a complex supply chain.
*   **Secure Data Sharing:**  Enable secure data sharing with verifiable integrity guarantees.
