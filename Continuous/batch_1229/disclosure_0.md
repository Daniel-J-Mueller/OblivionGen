## Modular Environmental Sensor Network – “Guardian”

**Concept:** Expand the door-based device into a localized environmental awareness system leveraging mesh networking and modular sensor ‘pods’.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Unit:** Maintains the form factor of the existing device – two-part construction (exterior/interior), camera, microphone, speaker, wireless transceiver, processor, and computer-readable storage. Acts as the mesh network hub. Exterior component houses primary power connection (battery *or* wired) and long-range wireless communication (Cellular/LoRaWAN).
*   **Sensor Pods:** Small, wirelessly connected modules designed to attach magnetically to metallic surfaces (door frames, adjacent walls, etc.) or via adhesive mounts. Each pod contains:
    *   Microcontroller
    *   Bluetooth/Zigbee radio
    *   Rechargeable battery (charged inductively by the core unit when within range).
    *   Sensor suite (user-configurable via app):
        *   Temperature/Humidity
        *   Air Quality (VOCs, CO2, particulate matter)
        *   Light Level/UV Index
        *   Motion Detection (Passive Infrared, Ultrasonic)
        *   Sound Detection (Specific frequency ranges – glass break, etc.)
        *   Vibration Sensor
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Mesh network utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy or Zigbee for short-range communication between core unit and sensor pods.
    *   Core unit establishes connection to cloud server via Wi-Fi or cellular.
    *   Data is aggregated and analyzed, providing real-time environmental monitoring.
*   **Software/App Interface:**
    *   User-configurable sensor pod selection and placement.
    *   Real-time data visualization and historical data logging.
    *   Customizable alerts (e.g., high CO2 levels, temperature fluctuations, motion detection).
    *   Integration with smart home ecosystems (IFTTT, etc.).
    *   Remote access to camera/microphone feed (configurable privacy settings).
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Core unit is primary power source.
    *   Sensor pods utilize low-power components and inductive charging.
    *   Solar panel option for sensor pods.

**Pseudocode (Sensor Pod Data Transmission):**

```
// Sensor Pod - Main Loop
while (true) {
    readSensorData();
    if (dataChanged()) {
        packageData();
        if (withinRangeOfCoreUnit()) {
            transmitDataToCoreUnit();
        } else {
            storeDataLocally(); // Store for later transmission
        }
    }
    sleep(10 seconds); // Low-power sleep mode
}

// Core Unit - Data Reception
onReceiveDataFromSensorPod(data) {
    processData(data);
    sendDataToCloud(data);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Home security & environmental monitoring
*   Elderly/infant monitoring
*   HVAC system optimization
*   Indoor air quality management
*   Smart building automation
*   Disaster preparedness (early warning system for environmental hazards)
