## Adaptive Predictive Texture Streaming for Mobile AR/VR

**Concept:** Leverage the multi-tiered caching described in the patent, but *proactively* stream and prepare textures based on predicted user gaze/movement in augmented/virtual reality environments.  This goes beyond simple image scrolling by anticipating where the user will look and pre-fetching/decoding textures for that region. The system will dynamically adjust texture quality based on distance, occlusion, and predicted visual importance.

**System Specs:**

*   **Gaze/Motion Prediction Module:**  Utilizes sensor data (IMU, camera tracking) and potentially user behavior models to predict the user’s future gaze direction and movement.  Outputs a prioritized "viewport prediction" – a cone/volume representing the area the user is likely to view in the next N milliseconds (N configurable, e.g., 100-500ms).
*   **Scene Graph Integration:**  Access to the AR/VR scene graph is required to identify textures relevant to the viewport prediction.  Textures are categorized by importance (e.g., directly in focus, peripheral, occluded).
*   **Adaptive Resolution/Compression Profiles:** Define multiple resolution/compression profiles for each texture. The system will select the appropriate profile based on distance from the user, occlusion level, and predicted visual importance. Profiles could include lossy compression techniques.
*   **Texture Streaming Service:**  A dedicated service responsible for managing texture requests, streaming, decoding, and caching.
*   **Multi-Tiered Cache Architecture:**
    *   **L0 Cache (GPU/Video Memory):**  Small, fast cache for textures *immediately* visible.  Prioritized based on gaze tracking.
    *   **L1 Cache (Application Heap):**  Medium-sized cache for textures likely to be viewed soon. Managed by the rendering application.  The existing patent’s ‘second cache’ would reside here.
    *   **L2 Cache (Native Memory/SSD):**  Large cache for less frequently accessed textures. The existing patent’s ‘first cache’ would reside here.
    *   **Persistent Storage:** Stores original, high-resolution texture assets.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Prediction:** Gaze/Motion Prediction Module generates a viewport prediction.
2.  **Texture Identification:**  Scene graph is queried to identify textures within or potentially entering the viewport.
3.  **Asset Selection & Decoding:** Based on distance, occlusion, and visual importance, the system selects the appropriate asset/resolution profile. If not already in L1/L2 cache:
    *   Fetch encoded texture from persistent storage.
    *   Distribute decoding tasks across multiple processor cores (as described in the patent).
    *   Store decoded texture in L2 cache.
4.  **L1 Cache Population:** Once decoding is complete, the decoded texture is copied to the L1 cache.
5.  **Rendering:** The rendering application retrieves textures from the L1 cache for display.
6.  **Cache Management:**  Least Recently Used (LRU) or other appropriate eviction policies are used to manage cache capacity. A “graceful degradation” system will reduce resolution or apply more aggressive compression if cache space becomes limited.
7. **Pre-Fetch Prioritization:**  Textures predicted to enter the viewport within a short timeframe (e.g., 200ms) are prioritized for pre-fetching and decoding.

**Pseudocode (Texture Streaming Service):**

```
function requestTexture(textureID):
  if texture in L1 Cache:
    return texture
  else if texture in L2 Cache:
    copy texture from L2 to L1
    return texture
  else:
    fetchEncodedTexture(textureID)
    decodedTexture = decodeTexture(encodedTexture)
    storeInL2Cache(decodedTexture)
    copyToL1Cache(decodedTexture)
    return decodedTexture

function decodeTexture(encodedTexture):
  // Distribute decoding tasks across multiple cores
  decodeThread = new DecodeThread(encodedTexture)
  decodeThread.start()
  return decodeThread.decodedTexture

function prefetchTextures(textureList):
  for texture in textureList:
    if not already in L1 or L2 cache:
      enqueueDecodingTask(texture)

function enqueueDecodingTask(texture):
  //Add to a queue to be processed when resources are available

function gracefulDegradation():
  //Reduce texture resolution or compression if cache is full
  //Evict least recently used textures
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Multi-core processor
*   GPU with sufficient video memory
*   Fast storage (SSD preferred)
*   High-bandwidth memory bus

**Potential Applications:**

*   Mobile AR/VR experiences
*   High-resolution mobile gaming
*   Remote rendering
*   Interactive 3D modeling on mobile devices
