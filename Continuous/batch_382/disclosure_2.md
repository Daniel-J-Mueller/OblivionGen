## Dynamic Public Domain "Heatmaps" & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the core functionality beyond simply *determining* public domain status to *predicting* future public domain releases and visualizing this data geographically. This leverages the system to become a forward-looking tool for content creators, educators, and archives.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Time-Series Analysis:**

*   **Input:** Expand metadata ingestion to include original publication dates (where available), country of origin, and any known renewal/extension information.
*   **Processing:** Implement a time-series database to track copyright expiration dates globally. The system automatically calculates projected public domain release dates for works.
*   **Data Sources:** Integrate APIs and web scraping capabilities to access copyright office records and databases across multiple countries.

**2. Geographic Visualization (Heatmap):**

*   **Output:** Generate interactive “heatmaps” overlaid on a world map.
*   **Data Representation:**  Heatmap intensity represents the *volume* of works projected to enter the public domain in a given region within specified timeframes (e.g., next 6 months, next year, next 5 years). Color gradients denote different levels of projected releases.
*   **User Interaction:**
    *   Users can zoom and pan the map.
    *   Clicking on a region reveals a list of works projected to enter the public domain there, with associated metadata.
    *   Filters allow users to refine the heatmap by content type (e.g., books, music, films), author, or time period.

**3. Predictive Modeling & “Copyright Shadow” Analysis:**

*   **Algorithm:** Implement a machine learning model trained on historical copyright data and renewal patterns.  The model will attempt to predict the likelihood of copyright *renewal* for works nearing expiration.
*   **“Copyright Shadow”:**  Visualize the predicted probability of renewal as a "shadow" around a work on the map.  A dark shadow indicates a high probability of renewal, suggesting the work may *not* enter the public domain as expected.
*   **Confidence Scoring:**  Assign a confidence score to each prediction. Display the score alongside the “Copyright Shadow” to indicate the reliability of the prediction.

**4. User Profile & Alert System:**

*   **User Profiles:** Allow users to create profiles and specify their areas of interest (e.g., specific authors, genres, regions).
*   **Alerts:**  The system automatically sends users email or in-app alerts when works matching their interests are projected to enter the public domain. Alerts also notify users of any changes in the predicted copyright status of works they are tracking.

**Pseudocode for Prediction Engine:**

```
FUNCTION predict_renewal(work_metadata, historical_data, country_laws):
  // Extract features from work_metadata (author, genre, publication date, etc.)
  features = extract_features(work_metadata)

  // Load historical renewal data for similar works in the same country
  historical_data = load_historical_data(features, country_laws)

  // Train a machine learning model (e.g., logistic regression, decision tree)
  model = train_model(historical_data)

  // Predict the probability of renewal
  renewal_probability = model.predict(features)

  RETURN renewal_probability
```
