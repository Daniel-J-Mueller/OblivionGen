## Dynamic Network Page 'Shadowing' & Predictive Testing

**Concept:** Extend the idea of injecting test scripts *into* a network page to proactively create a ‘shadow’ version of the page, allowing for predictive testing based on user interaction patterns *before* the user actually experiences the page.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** ‘Shadow Weaver’ - a service that intercepts network page requests.
*   **Trigger:** Enabled via configuration (per-page or globally).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Network page request intercepted.
    2.  ‘Shadow Weaver’ clones the page’s DOM.
    3.  The original page loads for the user as normal.
    4.  A separate, hidden ‘shadow’ page is created, populated with the cloned DOM and injected test scripts (similar to the original patent).
    5.  User interaction (clicks, keystrokes, mouse movements) on the *live* page are passively observed (client-side Javascript event listeners).
    6.  These interactions are replicated *in real-time* on the shadow page.
    7.  The injected test scripts on the shadow page execute based on the replicated interactions, proactively identifying potential issues *before* the user encounters them.
    8.  Test results are reported to a centralized logging/dashboard system.
*   **Test Script Injection:**
    *   Uses the same mechanism as the original patent (metadata, query parameters).
    *   Adds support for 'interaction-triggered' tests – tests that only execute when a specific user interaction occurs on the shadow page.
    *   Supports 'AI-driven test generation' - where the system automatically generates test scripts based on the observed user interactions and page structure.
*   **Data Capture & Reporting:**
    *   Collects data on: test execution results, performance metrics (rendering time, resource loading time), error logs.
    *   Provides a dashboard to visualize test results and identify performance bottlenecks.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Javascript):**

```javascript
// Event Listener for User Interactions
document.addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  // Replicate the click on the shadow page
  sendInteractionToShadowPage('click', event.target, event.clientX, event.clientY);
});

function sendInteractionToShadowPage(interactionType, targetElement, x, y) {
  // Send data to a shadow page server endpoint
  fetch('/shadow_page_endpoint', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      interactionType: interactionType,
      targetSelector: targetSelector,
      x: x,
      y: y
    })
  });
}
```

**Server-Side (Python/Flask - Simplified):**

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import subprocess

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/shadow_page_endpoint', methods=['POST'])
def shadow_page_endpoint():
  data = request.get_json()
  interaction_type = data.get('interactionType')
  target_selector = data.get('targetSelector')
  x = data.get('x')
  y = data.get('y')

  # Execute tests on shadow page DOM based on interaction
  # (This would involve manipulating a DOM representation in memory or using a headless browser)
  test_results = execute_tests(interaction_type, target_selector, x, y)

  return jsonify(test_results)

def execute_tests(interaction_type, target_selector, x, y):
  # Logic to find relevant tests and execute them
  # This function is the core of the shadow testing
  # Example:
  # if interaction_type == 'click' and target_selector == '#submit_button':
  #   run_submission_tests()
  return {'status': 'success', 'results': 'Test results'}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond *reactive* testing (triggered by events) to *proactive* testing, anticipating potential issues before the user experiences them. It leverages user interaction data to guide testing, creating a more realistic and effective testing environment. It also sets the stage for AI-driven test generation and personalized testing experiences.
