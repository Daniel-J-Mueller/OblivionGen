## Dynamic Data Provenance & Recomputation Pipelines

**Concept:** Extend the on-demand function execution to not just *transform* data, but to record a complete, auditable provenance trail *and* enable selective recomputation of data based on changes to source data or function logic.

**Specs:**

1.  **Provenance Graph Generation:**  Modify the code execution system to automatically construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the data lineage for each request.  Nodes in the DAG represent data objects (or portions thereof), and edges represent the functions applied to transform the data. Metadata associated with each node/edge includes:
    *   Function ID/Version
    *   Input Data Hash
    *   Output Data Hash
    *   Execution Timestamp
    *   Computing Device ID
    *   Context Data (as per original patent - source, location, access rights)

2.  **Provenance Storage:**  Integrate with a persistent, immutable storage system (e.g., blockchain-inspired ledger, append-only database) to store the provenance graphs.  This ensures auditability and tamper-proof data lineage tracking.

3.  **Change Detection & Impact Analysis:** Implement a mechanism to monitor source data objects for changes (using timestamps, hashes, or other change detection methods). When a change is detected, automatically trigger an impact analysis to identify all downstream data objects and functions affected by the change.

4.  **Selective Recomputation:**  Based on the impact analysis, selectively recompute only the affected portions of the data pipeline.  Instead of recomputing everything from scratch, the system can leverage cached intermediate results (from previous executions) to minimize recomputation time and cost.

5.  **Recomputation Pipeline Orchestration:**  Introduce a pipeline orchestration engine that manages the execution of recomputation tasks. This engine should be able to:
    *   Parallelize recomputation tasks across multiple computing devices.
    *   Handle dependencies between tasks.
    *   Track the progress of recomputation.
    *   Provide error handling and recovery mechanisms.

**Pseudocode (Recomputation Trigger):**

```
function detect_data_change(data_object_id, version_hash):
  if get_stored_version(data_object_id) != version_hash:
    print("Data change detected for: " + data_object_id)
    impact_analysis_result = perform_impact_analysis(data_object_id)
    trigger_recomputation(impact_analysis_result)

function perform_impact_analysis(data_object_id):
  # Query Provenance Storage for all downstream data objects/functions
  # dependent on data_object_id
  downstream_dependencies = query_provenance_storage(data_object_id)
  return downstream_dependencies

function trigger_recomputation(dependencies):
  for dependency in dependencies:
    # Create a recomputation task
    task = create_recomputation_task(dependency)
    # Submit task to pipeline orchestration engine
    submit_task(task)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Scalable and distributed storage system for provenance graphs.
*   High-throughput messaging queue for task orchestration.
*   Serverless computing platform for executing recomputation tasks.
*   Efficient data serialization and deserialization mechanisms.
*   Monitoring and alerting system for tracking recomputation progress and identifying errors.
