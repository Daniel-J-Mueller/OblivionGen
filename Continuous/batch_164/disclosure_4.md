## Adaptive Query Decomposition with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Dynamically decompose complex queries into micro-queries, distributing them across the cluster *before* full query parsing, and preemptively allocating resources based on predicted micro-query workload profiles. This moves resource allocation earlier in the process, mitigating bottlenecks caused by unpredictable query complexity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Micro-Query Decomposition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Raw query string.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a lightweight, probabilistic parsing engine to identify potential query segments (micro-queries) based on keyword analysis, operator identification (AND, OR, etc.), and table/field references. This is *not* full SQL parsing; it's pattern recognition.
    *   Assign a preliminary “complexity score” to each identified micro-query based on the number of tables referenced, estimated data scan size, and complexity of operators.
    *   Create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) representing the dependencies between micro-queries.  The root nodes are initial micro-queries derived directly from the raw query, and downstream nodes represent results requiring input from upstream nodes.
*   **Output:**  DAG of micro-queries with associated complexity scores.

**2. Predictive Resource Allocator:**

*   **Input:** Micro-query DAG, historical workload profiles for each node in the cluster, current cluster load.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Workload Profile Database:** Maintain a database of historical execution data for micro-queries. This includes execution time, CPU usage, memory allocation, and I/O operations. Categorize micro-queries by their structural characteristics (e.g., “SELECT * FROM table WHERE column = value”).
    *   **Predictive Model:** Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) trained on the historical workload data to predict the resource requirements (CPU, memory, I/O) for each micro-query. The input features should include the micro-query's complexity score, structural characteristics, and the current cluster load.
    *   **Resource Allocation Strategy:**
        *   Based on predicted resource requirements and node capacity, assign each micro-query to the most suitable node in the cluster. Prioritize nodes with available capacity and low current load.
        *   Implement a “shadow allocation” phase: Before executing any micro-queries, simulate the execution of a subset of micro-queries to refine resource allocation estimates and identify potential bottlenecks.
        *   Dynamically adjust resource allocations based on real-time monitoring of micro-query execution.
*   **Output:**  Micro-query execution plan with assigned nodes and allocated resources.

**3. Execution Engine:**

*   **Input:** Micro-query execution plan.
*   **Process:**
    *   Execute micro-queries on assigned nodes in parallel.
    *   Implement a dependency tracking mechanism to ensure that micro-queries are executed in the correct order according to the DAG.
    *   Collect results from individual micro-queries and aggregate them to produce the final query result.
    *   Continuously monitor the execution of micro-queries and adjust resource allocations as needed.
*   **Output:** Final query result.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Resource Allocator):**

```
function allocate_resources(micro_query_dag, historical_data, cluster_load):
  resource_plan = {}

  for micro_query in micro_query_dag.nodes:
    // Predict resource requirements using machine learning model
    predicted_resources = predict_resources(micro_query, historical_data)

    // Find the best node to execute the micro_query
    best_node = find_best_node(predicted_resources, cluster_load)

    // Assign the micro_query to the best_node
    resource_plan[micro_query] = best_node

  return resource_plan

function predict_resources(micro_query, historical_data):
  // Use trained machine learning model to predict resource requirements
  // Input: micro_query features, historical execution data
  // Output: predicted CPU, memory, I/O
  // (Implementation details of the machine learning model are not included here)
  return predicted_resources

function find_best_node(predicted_resources, cluster_load):
  // Find the node with the most available capacity and lowest load
  // Input: predicted resource requirements, current cluster load
  // Output: best node to execute the micro_query
  // (Implementation details of the node selection algorithm are not included here)
  return best_node
```

**Innovation:** The key innovation lies in shifting resource allocation to *before* full query parsing, based on probabilistic analysis and predictive modeling. This proactive approach allows the system to anticipate potential bottlenecks and optimize resource utilization more effectively than traditional reactive approaches.
