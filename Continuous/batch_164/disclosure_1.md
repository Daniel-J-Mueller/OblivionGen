**Adaptive Predictive Editing with Biofeedback Integration**

**Core Concept:** Extend the automatic tag/selection functionality to *predict* desired edits based on real-time biofeedback from the user, preemptively creating multiple edit options for instantaneous selection.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated biofeedback sensors – electrodermal activity (EDA), heart rate variability (HRV), and potentially electroencephalography (EEG) – embedded within the device (e.g., wearable camera, glasses).
*   **Biofeedback Data Stream:** Continuous monitoring of biofeedback signals during video capture.
*   **AI Predictive Model:** A machine learning model trained to correlate specific biofeedback patterns (changes in EDA, HRV, EEG signatures) with user ‘interest’ or ‘emotional response’ to video content.  This model is personalized to each user through initial calibration and ongoing learning.
*   **Preemptive Edit Point Generation:** The system continuously analyzes the video stream *and* biofeedback data. When a significant biofeedback response is detected (indicating potential interest or disinterest), the system *preemptively* generates multiple potential edit points – short clips of varying durations – centered around the moment of the response. These are calculated *before* the user explicitly issues a command.
*   **Multi-Option Display:**  A user interface displays a dynamic, scrolling feed of these pre-generated edit options. Options are prioritized based on the strength of the biofeedback signal and the predicted user preference.  The feed is presented as thumbnails or short previews.
*   **Selection Mechanism:** The user can select an edit option via voice command, gesture, or eye tracking.  Selected edits are seamlessly integrated into the ongoing video or flagged for later inclusion in a summary.
*   **Dynamic Calibration:** The AI model continuously learns and calibrates to the user's individual biofeedback patterns, improving the accuracy of edit prediction over time.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** The system integrates contextual data (location, time of day, activity) to further refine edit predictions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop during video capture
while (videoStream.hasData()) {
    videoFrame = videoStream.getNextFrame();
    biofeedbackData = sensorSuite.getLatestData();
    contextualData = environmentSensor.getData();

    predictedInterest = aiModel.predictInterest(videoFrame, biofeedbackData, contextualData);

    if (predictedInterest > threshold) {
        potentialEditPoints = generateEditPoints(videoFrame, predictedInterest); //Generate a list of options.
        display.updateEditFeed(potentialEditPoints);
    }

    // User selects edit from feed
    if (userSelectsEdit()) {
        selectedEdit = getSelectedEdit();
        integrateEditIntoVideo(selectedEdit);
        aiModel.learnFromSelection(selectedEdit, biofeedbackData); //Feed into AI to improve prediction
    }
}
```

**Key Innovation:** This goes beyond reacting to user commands. It *anticipates* editing desires based on physiological signals, creating a fundamentally more fluid and intuitive video capture and editing experience. It transforms video recording from a passive process to an interactive dialogue between user and device.
