## Dynamic Haptic Edge & Procedural Content Blending

**Concept:** Extend the bezel modification concept beyond visual changes to incorporate localized haptic feedback and dynamically blend content *through* the removed bezel area, creating the illusion of a single, expanded display.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of micro-actuators embedded within the device edge (replacing or supplementing existing physical bezel). Actuators capable of varying force, texture, and vibration. Density: 50 actuators/inch.
    *   Transparent, flexible PCB layer overlaid on actuator array, allowing light transmission and touch sensitivity.
    *   Edge-aligned, high-resolution micro-LED array capable of projecting light *through* the transparent PCB and actuator layer, providing visual cues that complement haptic feedback.
    *   Proximity & pressure sensors along the device edge to detect approaching/touching devices and user interaction.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Haptic Profile Manager:**  Allows user customization of haptic feedback profiles for various applications & interaction scenarios.  Profiles define actuator force, texture, and vibration patterns.
    *   **Content Blending Engine:**  Analyzes active content and dynamically adjusts its layout to seamlessly extend through the removed bezel area when a second device is detected.  Algorithms prioritize content relevance & user context.  Blend modes: ‘Extend’ (direct continuation), ‘Mirror’, ‘Complement’.
    *   **Edge-Aware UI Framework:**  Application framework designed to support edge-based interactions.  Provides APIs for developers to create UI elements that respond to edge proximity, touch, and haptic feedback.
    *   **Device Pairing Protocol:**  Secure, low-latency communication protocol for pairing devices and synchronizing content blending. Based on Ultra-Wideband (UWB) radio for precise positioning.
*   **Operational Procedure:**

    1.  **Proximity Detection:** Sensors detect a second device approaching the edge of the primary device.
    2.  **Device Identification & Pairing:** UWB radio determines the second device’s identity. If not previously paired, a pairing request is initiated.
    3.  **Bezel Modification:** Software instructs the micro-LED array to dim/disable sections of the bezel corresponding to the adjacent device. Simultaneously, the actuator array is deactivated in those sections.
    4.  **Content Analysis & Blending:** The Content Blending Engine analyzes the active content on both devices.
    5.  **Content Extension/Modification:** Based on selected blend mode, content is extended, mirrored, or complemented across the removed bezel area.  The Content Blending Engine dynamically adjusts layouts to ensure visual continuity.
    6.  **Haptic Feedback Synchronization:**  The Haptic Profile Manager coordinates haptic feedback on both devices to create a cohesive, multi-device experience. For example, a sliding gesture could trigger synchronized vibrations along the shared edge.
    7.  **User Interaction:** User interacts with the blended content as if it were displayed on a single, larger display.
*   **Pseudocode (Content Blending Engine - Simplified):**

    ```
    function blendContent(device1Content, device2Content, blendMode, sharedEdgeInfo):
        if blendMode == "Extend":
            // Find relevant content from device1 that aligns with sharedEdgeInfo
            relevantContent = findRelevantContent(device1Content, sharedEdgeInfo)
            // Extend relevantContent onto device2Content
            blendedContent = extendContent(relevantContent, device2Content)
        elif blendMode == "Mirror":
            // Mirror device1Content across sharedEdgeInfo
            blendedContent = mirrorContent(device1Content, sharedEdgeInfo)
        elif blendMode == "Complement":
            // Find complementary content on device2Content to device1Content
            complementaryContent = findComplementaryContent(device1Content, device2Content, sharedEdgeInfo)
            // Combine device1Content and complementaryContent
            blendedContent = combineContent(device1Content, complementaryContent)
        return blendedContent
    ```

    This output introduces a significant shift by adding haptic feedback and content blending. It moves beyond simple visual bezel removal toward creating a more immersive and interconnected multi-device experience. It aims to create the *illusion* of a larger, unified display, enhancing productivity, entertainment, and collaborative applications.
