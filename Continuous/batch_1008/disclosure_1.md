## Dynamic Data Facet Composition via Generative AI

**Concept:** Extend the existing data facet registry to allow *dynamic* composition of facets using generative AI models. Instead of pre-defined facets, the system can *create* facets on demand, tailored to a specific user query or analytical need.

**Specification:**

**1. Generative Facet Engine:**

*   **Model Type:** Utilize a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on a knowledge graph representing the business object types and their associated data stores.
*   **Input:** Natural language query expressing the desired data characteristics (e.g., "Show me all inventory data for damaged goods in the last week", "Combine catalog information with customer reviews for products with declining sales").  Also includes user role/permissions for data access control.
*   **Output:** A "Facet Blueprint" â€“ a structured definition of the new facet, including:
    *   Data sources to query.
    *   Data transformations to apply.
    *   Data aggregation/filtering rules.
    *   Schema definition (field names, data types).
    *   Interface description (API endpoint, data format).

**2. Registry Extension:**

*   The existing data facet registry is extended to accommodate "Generated Facets".
*   Generated facets are treated like any other facet, but their definition is stored as a serialized Facet Blueprint.
*   The system automatically provisions the necessary infrastructure to execute the Facet Blueprint (e.g., data pipelines, API endpoints).

**3. Query Execution Flow:**

1.  Client requests data for a business object.
2.  System checks the registry for existing facets that match the request.
3.  If no suitable facet exists, the query is routed to the Generative Facet Engine.
4.  The Generative Facet Engine creates a Facet Blueprint.
5.  The Blueprint is stored in the registry.
6.  The system provisions the necessary infrastructure.
7.  Data is retrieved and transformed according to the Blueprint.
8.  Data is returned to the client.

**4. Pseudocode (Facet Blueprint Generation):**

```
function generateFacetBlueprint(query, businessObjectType, userRole) {
  // 1. Analyze the query using the LLM to identify data requirements
  intent = LLM.analyzeIntent(query)
  requiredEntities = LLM.extractEntities(query, businessObjectType)
  relationships = LLM.extractRelationships(query)

  // 2. Query the knowledge graph to identify relevant data sources
  dataSources = knowledgeGraph.findDataSources(requiredEntities, relationships, userRole)

  // 3. Define data transformations based on intent and data sources
  transformations = LLM.generateTransformations(intent, dataSources)

  // 4. Define the schema for the new facet
  schema = LLM.generateSchema(transformations)

  // 5. Create the Facet Blueprint
  blueprint = {
    dataSource: dataSources,
    transformations: transformations,
    schema: schema,
    interface: {
      endpoint: "/api/generated/" + UUID(),
      format: "JSON"
    }
  }

  return blueprint
}
```

**5. Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   LLM hosted and accessible via API.
*   Knowledge graph containing metadata about business objects and data sources.
*   Data pipeline orchestration framework (e.g., Airflow, Kubeflow).
*   API gateway for exposing generated facets.
*   Monitoring and alerting system.
