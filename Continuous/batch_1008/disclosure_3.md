## Acoustic Event Reconstruction via Multi-Modal Sensory Fusion

**Concept:** Expand sound source localization beyond simple azimuth determination by reconstructing the acoustic *event* itself, not just its direction. This involves fusing audio data with complementary sensory input (visual, vibrational) to create a more complete “acoustic snapshot” for analysis and potential re-synthesis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Existing array as per the patent.
*   **Visual Sensor:** Low-latency, high-resolution camera (RGB or depth).  Minimum 30fps. Field of view should overlap significantly with the microphone array's effective range.
*   **Vibrational Sensor:** Accelerometer/vibration sensor integrated into the device housing.  Must be sensitive to a broad frequency range (20Hz – 20kHz) and capable of detecting subtle vibrations.
*   **Processing Unit:**  High-performance processor capable of real-time multi-sensor data fusion and signal processing. Dedicated hardware acceleration (e.g., DSP, FPGA) recommended.
*   **Storage:** Sufficient storage for raw sensor data and processed results.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Sensor Data Acquisition Module:**  Responsible for capturing and synchronizing data streams from the microphone array, camera, and vibration sensor. Timestamps are crucial.
*   **Feature Extraction Module:**
    *   **Audio:**  Extract standard features (MFCCs, spectral centroid, chroma) plus event-specific features (e.g., percussive onset detection).
    *   **Visual:**  Object detection (identify potential sound-generating objects), motion tracking, and visual event detection (e.g., a hammer striking an object).
    *   **Vibrational:**  Extract features related to frequency, amplitude, and duration of vibrations.  Identify dominant vibrational modes.
*   **Data Fusion Engine:**  Core of the system. Uses a Bayesian Network or Kalman Filter to integrate features from all three sensors. Weights assigned to each sensor based on environmental conditions (e.g., high noise = prioritize visual input) and confidence levels.
*   **Acoustic Event Reconstruction Module:**  Reconstructs the original acoustic waveform based on the fused data. This is not simply re-amplification, but a smart re-synthesis that leverages visual and vibrational cues to fill in gaps or improve clarity.
*   **Output Module:**  Provides several output options:
    *   **Directional Audio:**  Spatialized audio that simulates the sound source's location.
    *   **Acoustic Event Visualization:**  Graphical representation of the reconstructed event, highlighting key features and characteristics.
    *   **Raw Data Logging:**  Option to log raw sensor data for further analysis and machine learning.

**3. Pseudocode (Data Fusion Engine):**

```
// Input: Audio Features (A), Visual Features (V), Vibration Features (X)
// Output: Fused Feature Vector (F)

function FuseSensors(A, V, X):
    // 1. Calculate Sensor Confidence Levels
    confidence_A = CalculateAudioConfidence(A)
    confidence_V = CalculateVisualConfidence(V)
    confidence_X = CalculateVibrationConfidence(X)

    // 2. Normalize Confidence Levels (sum to 1)
    total_confidence = confidence_A + confidence_V + confidence_X
    weight_A = confidence_A / total_confidence
    weight_V = confidence_V / total_confidence
    weight_X = confidence_X / total_confidence

    // 3. Weighted Sum of Features
    F = (weight_A * A) + (weight_V * V) + (weight_X * X)

    return F
```

**4. Potential Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Hearing Aids:** Reconstruct lost or degraded audio information for improved clarity.
*   **Security Systems:** Identify and classify acoustic events with higher accuracy.
*   **Robotics:** Enable robots to understand their environment through multi-sensory perception.
*   **Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Create more immersive and realistic audio experiences.
*   **Forensic Analysis:** Reconstruct acoustic events at crime scenes.
