**Adaptive Event Correlation via Causal Inference**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview**

This design expands on the concept of event suppression based on origination source, shifting from simple thresholding of event *quantity* to an analysis of *causal relationships* between events. The goal is to dynamically identify and suppress events that are likely *effects* of a root cause already being investigated, improving signal-to-noise ratio and reducing alert fatigue.

**II. Core Components**

1.  **Event Ingestion & Normalization:**  Receives event data from support service servers.  Normalizes data into a standardized format including: event type, timestamp, origination source (application/user), and associated metadata.

2.  **Causal Graph Builder:** This module constructs a dynamic causal graph representing relationships between event types. This graph isn't static; it's continuously updated based on observed event sequences.
    *   **Algorithm:** Bayesian Network learning, specifically using structure learning algorithms (e.g., Hill-Climbing, Tabu Search) to infer causal relationships from historical event data.
    *   **Data Source:** Historical event logs, enriched with contextual information (e.g., system configuration, deployment metadata).
    *   **Output:** A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent event types and edges represent probabilistic causal relationships. Edge weights represent the strength of the causal influence.

3.  **Event Contextualizer:**  For each incoming event, this module determines its position within the causal graph. It identifies potential "parent" events (causes) and "child" events (effects).

4.  **Suppression Engine:**  The core logic for event suppression.
    *   **Suppression Rule:** An event is suppressed if:
        *   A parent event with higher severity is already being actively investigated (determined by an escalation service or specialist).
        *   The probability of the event occurring *given* the active investigation of the parent event exceeds a configurable threshold. This uses Bayesian inference based on the causal graphâ€™s edge weights.

5.  **Adaptive Learning Module:**  Continuously monitors the effectiveness of suppression rules. 
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Integrates feedback from escalation services/specialists regarding the accuracy of suppressed events.
    *   **Graph Update:** Uses this feedback to refine the causal graph, adjusting edge weights and potentially discovering new causal relationships.

**III. Pseudocode (Suppression Engine)**

```
function suppressEvent(eventData, causalGraph, activeInvestigations):
  parentEvents = findParentEvents(eventData, causalGraph)

  for parentEvent in parentEvents:
    if parentEvent is in activeInvestigations:
      // Calculate P(eventData | parentEvent is being investigated)
      probability = calculateConditionalProbability(eventData, parentEvent, causalGraph)

      if probability > suppressionThreshold:
        // Suppress the event
        return True

  // Do not suppress the event
  return False
```

**IV. Data Structures**

*   **EventData:**  { eventType, timestamp, originationSource, metadata }
*   **CausalGraph:**  Graph data structure (e.g., adjacency list) where nodes are eventTypes and edges are (eventType1, eventType2, weight).
*   **ActiveInvestigations:**  Set of eventTypes currently under investigation.

**V. Configuration Parameters**

*   `suppressionThreshold`:  Probability threshold for event suppression.
*   `graphUpdateInterval`: Frequency of causal graph updates.
*   `historicalDataWindow`: Length of historical data used for graph learning.
