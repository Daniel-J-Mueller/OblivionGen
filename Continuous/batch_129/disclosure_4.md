## Dynamic Skill-Based Agent "Buffs" & Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Augment agent capabilities *in real-time* based on incoming contact attributes and agent performance data, combined with a proactive routing system anticipating agent skill needs. This builds on the existing idea of agent profiles but adds a dynamic, short-term layer of skill enhancement.

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

1.  **Contact Analyzer:** Receives incoming contact (call, message, etc.). Utilizes NLP and potentially audio analysis to identify:
    *   **Contact Complexity Score:** A numeric representation of the anticipated difficulty of resolving the contact (1-10).
    *   **Emotional State Detection:** Identifies the emotional tone of the contact (positive, neutral, negative, angry, frustrated).
    *   **Topic/Intent Classification:** Categorizes the contact based on the customer's likely need (e.g., billing inquiry, technical support, order placement).
2.  **Agent Performance Monitor:** Tracks real-time metrics for each agent:
    *   **Resolution Rate:** Percentage of contacts resolved successfully.
    *   **Average Handle Time (AHT):** Time taken to resolve a contact.
    *   **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT):** Feedback received from customers.
    *   **Skill Proficiency Levels:** Existing agent profile data on skills (billing, technical, etc.).
3.  **"Buff" Engine:**  A rule-based system that dynamically assigns temporary "buffs" to agents based on contact attributes and agent performance.  Buffs are small, targeted interventions. Examples:
    *   **Knowledge Prompt:**  Displays a relevant knowledge base article on the agent's screen. Triggered by topic classification & low agent confidence.
    *   **Script Assist:** Provides suggested responses for common phrases. Triggered by negative emotional state detection & agent AHT exceeding threshold.
    *   **Escalation Pre-Alert:**  Flags a contact as likely to require escalation, providing the agent with escalation resources in advance. Triggered by high complexity score & decreasing CSAT.
    *   **Empathy Booster:** Displays empathetic phrases to help the agent respond appropriately. Triggered by negative emotional state detection.
4.  **Predictive Router:**  Routes incoming contacts based on:
    *   **Agent Skill Profile:** Existing skills.
    *   **Real-time Agent Buffs:** Current temporary enhancements.
    *   **Contact Analyzer Output:** Complexity, emotion, topic.
    *   **Anticipated Skill Need:** Predicts what skills will be *most* needed to resolve the contact, based on historical data and real-time analysis.

**II.  Workflow & Pseudocode:**

```
// Incoming Contact Received
Contact = ReceiveContact()

// Analyze Contact
Analysis = ContactAnalyzer(Contact)
Complexity = Analysis.Complexity
Emotion = Analysis.Emotion
Topic = Analysis.Topic

// Identify Eligible Agents (based on existing skill profile)
EligibleAgents = GetEligibleAgents(Topic)

// Calculate Agent "Readiness Score" (incorporating buffs)
For Each Agent in EligibleAgents:
    BaseScore = Agent.SkillProficiency(Topic)
    BuffScore = 0
    If (Complexity > 7):
        BuffScore += Agent.KnowledgeBaseAccessSpeed
    If (Emotion == "Angry"):
        BuffScore += Agent.EmpathyTrainingScore
    ReadinessScore = BaseScore + BuffScore

// Sort Agents by ReadinessScore (descending)
SortedAgents = SortAgents(SortedAgents, ReadinessScore)

// Route Contact to Top Agent
RouteContact(Contact, SortedAgents[0])
```

**III. Data Storage Requirements:**

*   Agent Skill Profiles (existing)
*   Agent Performance Metrics (resolution rate, AHT, CSAT)
*   Knowledge Base Article Database
*   Script Templates
*   Empathy Training Materials
*   Buff Activation Rules (mapping contact attributes to buff assignments)

**IV.  Scalability Considerations:**

*   Buff Engine should be designed as a microservice to allow for independent scaling.
*   Caching of frequently accessed data (knowledge base articles, scripts) is crucial.
*   Real-time data streaming (agent performance metrics) should be optimized for performance.
