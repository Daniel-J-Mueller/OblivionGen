## Dynamic Skill-Based Question Routing & Micro-Mentorship

**Concept:** Leverage the existing question/answer framework to create a dynamic system that not only rewards expertise but actively *builds* it through real-time mentorship opportunities, all driven by AI-powered skill assessment and question routing.

**Specifications:**

**1. Skill Profile Generation & Maintenance:**

*   **Data Sources:** User responses, self-reported skills, implicit skill inference (from question categories chosen/answered), performance metrics (upvotes/downvotes on answers, time to answer, solution complexity).
*   **Skill Vector:** Each user represented by a multi-dimensional vector quantifying proficiency across various categories and subcategories.  This is not a static score, but a continuously updated profile.
*   **Decay Function:**  Skills decay over time if not actively used, encouraging continuous participation and preventing stale expertise.
*   **Skill Validation:**  Periodic "challenge" questions (blinded, peer-reviewed) to validate self-reported or inferred skills.  Successful completion boosts the skill vector; failure triggers targeted learning resources.

**2. Dynamic Question Routing:**

*   **Question Complexity Assessment:** AI analyzes incoming questions to determine complexity (based on language, ambiguity, required knowledge domains).
*   **Skill-Based Matching:** Questions are routed to users whose skill vectors *most closely* match the question’s requirements, *and* who have demonstrated a willingness to mentor (see Section 3). The system doesn’t always route to the “highest” ranked expert; it prioritizes those who can *effectively teach* the solution.
*   **Tiered Routing:**
    *   **Tier 1 (Direct Answer):**  High-confidence matches receive the question directly.
    *   **Tier 2 (Guided Solution):**  Moderate matches receive a partially completed solution outline or a set of guiding questions to help them arrive at the answer.
    *   **Tier 3 (Peer Review/Collaboration):**  Lower matches are presented with existing solutions from other users for review and feedback, fostering learning through constructive criticism.
*   **"Difficulty Bump":** If a question remains unanswered for a set time, the routing algorithm increases the exposure to users with progressively broader skillsets.

**3. Micro-Mentorship & Knowledge Transfer:**

*   **Mentorship Flag:** Users can opt-in to a “Mentorship” flag in their profile. This signals their willingness to guide others.
*   **Guided Solution Mode:** When routing questions to Mentors, the system offers a “Guided Solution Mode.” This mode allows the Mentor to:
    *   Provide hints instead of full answers.
    *   Request the user to explain their thought process.
    *   Offer alternative approaches.
*   **"Knowledge Chunking":** Mentors can break down complex answers into smaller, digestible “knowledge chunks” which are then stored in a searchable knowledge base.
*   **Mentorship Score:** Mentors receive a “Mentorship Score” based on user feedback, the quality of their guidance, and the number of users they successfully help.
*   **Reputation-Based Trust:** Micro-mentorship pairings prioritize individuals with positive historical interactions.

**4. Reward System (Enhanced):**

*   **Tiered Rewards:**  Rewards are distributed based on mentorship quality, knowledge contribution, and active participation.
*   **"Knowledge Token" Economy:** Users earn “Knowledge Tokens” for contributions to the knowledge base, providing mentorship, and answering difficult questions. Tokens can be redeemed for various benefits (e.g., premium access, increased visibility, exclusive rewards).
*   **“Skill Badges”:** Achievement-based badges that recognize users’ expertise in specific areas. Badges are visually displayed on user profiles.

**Pseudocode (Question Routing):**

```
function routeQuestion(question):
  complexity = analyzeComplexity(question)
  skillRequirements = extractSkillRequirements(question)
  eligibleUsers = findUsers(skillRequirements) //Find users with matching skills

  if eligibleUsers is empty:
    //Escalate question to broader skillsets
    escalateQuestion(question)
    return

  //Prioritize Mentors and active users
  sortedUsers = sortBy(eligibleUsers, mentorshipScore, activityScore)

  //Select user based on skill match and mentorship score
  selectedUser = sortedUsers[0]

  //Route question to selected user
  sendQuestion(selectedUser, question)
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simple reward-based expertise leveraging. It actively *builds* expertise by facilitating real-time mentorship, promoting knowledge transfer, and fostering a collaborative learning environment.  The tiered routing and mentorship score introduce a dynamic element that optimizes both answer quality and user growth.  The Knowledge Token economy incentivizes ongoing contribution and participation, creating a self-sustaining learning ecosystem.
