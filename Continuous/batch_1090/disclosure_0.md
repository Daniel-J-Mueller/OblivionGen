## Modular, Interlocking Tray System for Variable Rollable Object Sizes

**Concept:** Expand the single-tray idea into a modular system where multiple trays can be connected, and the height/depth of the containment can be adjusted based on the size of the rollable object. Think LEGOs for cylindrical objects.

**Specs:**

*   **Tray Base Unit:**  Same general triangular-prism side construction as the original patent, but with standardized connection points on the base and along the vertical edges of the side structures.  Connection points are shallow dovetail slots. Material: Corrugated plastic (polypropylene) for durability and water resistance.
*   **Connector Pieces:** Small, injection-molded plastic pieces that slide into the dovetail slots, locking adjacent tray units together.  Different connector types will exist:
    *   *Linear Connector:* Joins trays end-to-end, creating a longer channel.
    *   *Corner Connector:* Joins trays at 90-degree angles.
    *   *Height Adjustment Connector:* Allows stacking of trays vertically. A ratcheting mechanism will be built into the connector to provide variable height.
*   **End Caps:**  Simple plastic caps that snap onto the open ends of the tray assembly to prevent roll-out. Available in different sizes.
*   **Base Plate:** An optional perforated base plate with corresponding locking tabs to provide a stable foundation for the assembled tray system.
*   **Material Options:** While polypropylene is the primary material, offer tray units in ESD-safe plastic for handling sensitive electronic components.

**Pseudocode for Automated Assembly (Potential for Robotic Integration):**

```
// Input: Desired tray length, width (number of trays), and height (stack count)
// Input: Object dimensions (diameter/length)

// 1. Calculate required number of tray units.
// 2. Initiate robotic arm sequence.
// 3.  Retrieve base plate (if selected).
// 4.  Retrieve first tray unit.
// 5.  Place tray unit onto base plate (or directly onto work surface).
// 6.  Loop (for each additional tray unit):
//      a. Retrieve next tray unit.
//      b. Select appropriate connector type (Linear, Corner, Height Adjustment).
//      c. Insert connector into dovetail slots of adjacent tray units.
//      d. Attach new tray unit to assembled structure.
// 7.  Attach end caps to open ends.
// 8.  Perform quality check (visual inspection for secure connections).
// 9. Output assembled tray system.

```

**Variations:**

*   **Rounded Interior:** Modify the triangular prism shape to have a rounded interior to prevent damage to delicate rollable objects.
*   **Integrated Labeling:** Incorporate a slot or recessed area on the side of each tray for attaching labels or barcodes.
*   **Color-Coding:** Offer trays in different colors for product differentiation or organization.
*   **Conductive Coating:** Apply a conductive coating to the tray material for applications requiring static discharge protection.
