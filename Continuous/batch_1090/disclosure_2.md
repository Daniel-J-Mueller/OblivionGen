## Adaptive Camouflage Network Extender

**Concept:** A network extender capable of dynamically altering its external appearance (color, texture, even projected imagery) to blend with its surroundings, minimizing visual intrusion and potentially serving as a subtle informational display.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Functionality:** Maintains all standard network extender functions (Wi-Fi signal boosting, range extension, etc.).
*   **Exterior:** Constructed from a flexible, e-ink or micro-LED matrix shell. Resolution: 64x64 pixels minimum, ideally 128x128. Material: Polymer substrate with embedded micro-LEDs or e-ink particles.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Integrated array of sensors:
    *   RGB color sensor.
    *   Ambient light sensor.
    *   Proximity sensor.
    *   Optional: Miniature camera for image capture and analysis.
*   **Processing Unit:** Onboard microcontroller with image processing capabilities.
    *   Algorithm: Real-time color and texture analysis of surrounding environment.
    *   Algorithm: Pattern generation to mimic detected textures (wood grain, brick, wallpaper, etc.).
    *   Algorithm: Ability to display static or animated patterns.
    *   Algorithm: Network connectivity for receiving display updates/commands.
*   **Power:** Standard power adapter or PoE (Power over Ethernet). Wireless charging capability optional.
*   **Dimensions:** Roughly equivalent to existing network extender designs (e.g., 4" x 2" x 1"). Shape: Modular, allowing for stacking or arrangement.
*   **User Interface:** Web-based or mobile app control for:
    *   Custom pattern selection.
    *   Color palette customization.
    *   Brightness and contrast adjustment.
    *   Firmware updates.
    *   Sensor data visualization.

**Pseudocode (Pattern Generation):**

```
function generate_pattern(environment_data):
  // environment_data contains color, texture, and light level info
  
  dominant_color = analyze_color(environment_data)
  texture_type = analyze_texture(environment_data)

  if texture_type == "wood":
    pattern = generate_wood_grain(dominant_color)
  else if texture_type == "brick":
    pattern = generate_brick_pattern(dominant_color)
  else:
    pattern = generate_abstract_pattern(dominant_color) // Fallback

  return pattern
```

**Novelty:** Existing network extenders prioritize functionality over aesthetics. This design integrates advanced display technology and environmental awareness to create a device that is both functional and visually adaptable, blending into its surroundings or acting as a subtle information display. It goes beyond simple color-matching and dynamically adapts to complex textures.
