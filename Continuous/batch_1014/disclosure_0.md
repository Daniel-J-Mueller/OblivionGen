## Adaptive Priority Buffering with Predictive QoS

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically adjusting application data buffer prioritization *before* reaching the ATB/DRB layer, leveraging predicted Quality of Service (QoS) metrics and user behavior modeling.

**Core Concept:** Rather than solely prioritizing based on established ATB/DRB parameters or application-declared priority, introduce a predictive buffer management layer that anticipates application needs *before* they become bottlenecks. This layer sits upstream of the existing ATB/DRB scheduling, pre-staging data based on predicted demands.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Profiler:** A module that learns user application usage patterns (time of day, location, network conditions) to predict future data needs. This utilizes a Markov Model or similar predictive algorithm.
*   **QoS Predictor:** Estimates future network QoS (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) based on historical data, real-time network monitoring, and potentially crowdsourced data from other devices.
*   **Pre-Buffer Manager:** Allocates buffer space to each application *proactively*, based on the outputs of the Behavioral Profiler and QoS Predictor. Applications anticipated to have high demand and potentially experience poor QoS receive larger buffers.
*   **Dynamic Buffer Adjustment:** Continuously adjusts buffer allocations based on real-time feedback and updated predictions. If an application's actual demand differs significantly from the prediction, the buffer allocation is adjusted accordingly.
*   **Weighted Priority Algorithm:** Combines the original ATB/DRB priority with the predicted need score from the Pre-Buffer Manager.  A higher predicted need score boosts the application's priority within the pre-staging buffers.

**Pseudocode (Pre-Buffer Manager):**

```
// Application Data Structure
struct ApplicationData {
  AppID: Integer;
  CurrentBufferLevel: Integer;
  PredictedDataNeed: Float;
  ATB_Priority: Integer;
  WeightedPriority: Integer;
};

// Function to Calculate Weighted Priority
function calculateWeightedPriority(appData) {
  // Constants for tuning
  const needWeight = 0.7;
  const atbWeight = 0.3;

  appData.WeightedPriority = (appData.PredictedDataNeed * needWeight) + (appData.ATB_Priority * atbWeight);
  return appData.WeightedPriority;
}

// Main Loop (executed periodically)
foreach application in activeApplications {

  // Predict Data Need (using Behavioral Profiler & QoS Predictor)
  application.PredictedDataNeed = predictDataNeed(application.AppID);

  // Calculate Weighted Priority
  application.WeightedPriority = calculateWeightedPriority(application);

  // Allocate/Deallocate Buffer Space
  allocateBufferSpace(application, application.WeightedPriority);
}
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Buffer Management:** Utilizes a tiered buffer system, with different tiers allocated to applications based on their weighted priority.
*   **Data Pre-Fetching:**  Actively pre-fetches data for applications with high predicted need, further reducing latency.
*   **Network Aware Scheduling:** Integrates with the existing ATB/DRB scheduling to ensure smooth data transmission.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously learns from user behavior and network conditions to improve prediction accuracy.
