## Dynamic Neural Network Partitioning & Execution with Asynchronous Fault Injection

**Concept:** Develop a system that dynamically partitions a neural network across multiple execution engines *during* runtime, allowing for selective fault injection into specific partitions to assess robustness and identify critical network components. This contrasts with static partitioning or post-training fault injection.

**Specification:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Modular Execution Engines:** A system with *N* independent execution engines capable of processing neural network layers. Each engine must have its own local memory and communication interface.
*   **Dynamic Interconnect:** A high-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect fabric allowing any execution engine to communicate with any other.  This is crucial for exchanging intermediate results during dynamic partitioning.
*   **Fault Injection Unit (FIU):** A dedicated hardware unit capable of injecting bit flips, value corruption, or instruction skips into the memory or instruction stream of any execution engine, under software control. The FIU must support configurable injection rates and target locations.
*   **Global Control Unit (GCU):** A central control unit responsible for partitioning the neural network, assigning layers to execution engines, coordinating data transfer, and managing the FIU.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Network Compiler:**  Modified neural network compiler that outputs a graph representation of the network, detailing layer dependencies and computational requirements.  It also annotates layers with 'criticality scores' based on sensitivity analysis (determined offline).
*   **Runtime Partitioning Manager (RPM):** Software module running on the GCU responsible for:
    *   Dynamically partitioning the network graph based on load balancing, execution engine capabilities, and criticality scores.
    *   Assigning layers to specific execution engines.
    *   Generating execution schedules.
    *   Monitoring engine performance.
*   **Fault Injection Controller (FIC):** Software module responsible for configuring and controlling the FIU. It receives commands from the RPM (e.g., "Inject bit flips into engine 2, layer 3, at rate X").
*   **Observation & Logging System:** A mechanism for collecting performance metrics, error rates, and intermediate results from each execution engine.  This data is used to evaluate network robustness and identify failure modes.

**3. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Compilation:** The neural network is compiled, resulting in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the network's layers and their dependencies. Each layer is annotated with a criticality score.
2.  **Initial Partitioning:** The RPM performs an initial partitioning of the DAG across the available execution engines, prioritizing load balancing and maximizing throughput.
3.  **Runtime Execution & Monitoring:** The network begins executing, with each engine processing its assigned layers. The Observation & Logging System continuously monitors engine performance and error rates.
4.  **Dynamic Repartitioning:** The RPM periodically (or on-demand) re-evaluates the partitioning based on runtime conditions (e.g., engine load, error rates). It may migrate layers between engines to improve performance or fault tolerance.
5.  **Asynchronous Fault Injection:** The FIC, under the control of the RPM, injects faults into specific layers on specific engines. This is done *asynchronously* with respect to normal execution, to simulate real-world error conditions.  The fault injection rate and target locations are varied to explore the network’s resilience.
6.  **Resilience Evaluation:** The Observation & Logging System monitors the network’s behavior under fault injection. Metrics such as accuracy, throughput, and error recovery time are collected and analyzed.
7.  **Adaptive Partitioning:** Based on the resilience evaluation, the RPM adapts the partitioning strategy to minimize the impact of faults. Critical layers may be replicated across multiple engines, or fault-tolerant coding schemes may be employed.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Partitioning Manager - simplified):**

```
function partitionNetwork(networkGraph, executionEngines):
  initialPartition = distributeLayers(networkGraph, executionEngines)
  currentPartition = initialPartition

  while (network is executing):
    performanceData = collectPerformanceData(executionEngines)
    errorRates = collectErrorRates(executionEngines)

    if (performanceData indicates imbalance or errorRates exceed threshold):
      newPartition = optimizePartition(currentPartition, performanceData, errorRates)
      migrateLayers(currentPartition, newPartition)
      currentPartition = newPartition

    // Asynchronous Fault Injection
    if (time to inject fault):
      targetEngine, targetLayer = selectTarget(networkGraph)
      injectFault(targetEngine, targetLayer)
```

**Novelty:** The combination of *dynamic* partitioning, *asynchronous* fault injection, and *adaptive* resilience evaluation provides a novel approach to building robust and fault-tolerant neural network systems. Existing techniques typically focus on static partitioning or post-training fault injection, but do not provide the same level of flexibility and adaptability. This design allows for continuous assessment of network robustness and optimization of partitioning strategies in response to changing conditions and error rates.
