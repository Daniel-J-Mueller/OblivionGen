## Dynamic Data Affinity & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the existing stress management system to not just *react* to resource pressure, but *predict* it based on query patterns and proactively adjust data affinity to minimize future stress. This goes beyond simple load balancing; it anticipates *where* the load will be and moves the data closer to it *before* it happens.

**Specifications:**

**1. Query Pattern Analyzer (QPA):**

*   **Input:** Raw query logs from query nodes (as described in claim 17) – timestamps, query terms, originating client.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Time-series analysis to identify recurring query patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal).
    *   Clustering of similar queries to identify broad categories of data access.
    *   Correlation of query patterns with specific data partitions (identify which storage nodes are consistently accessed for particular query types).
    *   Predictive modeling (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM networks) to forecast future query load for each partition.
*   **Output:**  Predicted Query Load Profile – a time-series forecast of expected query load for each data partition, along with a confidence interval.

**2. Data Affinity Manager (DAM):**

*   **Input:** Predicted Query Load Profile (from QPA), Current Data Partition Map (location of each partition on storage nodes), Storage Node Resource Utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Cost model to evaluate the “cost” of moving a partition:
        *   Network bandwidth used.
        *   Storage node load impact.
        *   Query latency impact (during migration).
    *   Optimization algorithm (e.g., Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm) to determine the optimal data partition map that minimizes the overall cost, balancing predicted query load with storage node utilization. The algorithm should prioritize partitions with high predicted load and/or storage nodes nearing capacity.
*   **Output:**  Recommended Data Partition Map – a new mapping of data partitions to storage nodes.

**3.  Dynamic Data Migration (DDM):**

*   **Input:** Recommended Data Partition Map (from DAM), Current Data Partition Map.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Initiate data migration tasks in a controlled manner to minimize disruption:
        *   Replication of data to the target storage node.
        *   Gradual redirection of queries to the target node (using load balancing mechanisms).
        *   Verification of data integrity on the target node.
        *   Removal of data from the source node after verification.
*   **Output:** Updated Data Partition Map (in effect).

**Pseudocode (DAM - Simplified):**

```
function optimize_data_affinity(predicted_load, current_map, utilization):
  best_map = current_map
  best_cost = calculate_cost(current_map, predicted_load, utilization)

  for i in range(NUM_ITERATIONS):
    new_map = generate_random_neighbor(best_map)  // Swap two partitions
    new_cost = calculate_cost(new_map, predicted_load, utilization)

    if new_cost < best_cost:
      best_cost = new_cost
      best_map = new_map

  return best_map

function calculate_cost(data_map, predicted_load, utilization):
  cost = 0
  for partition in partitions:
    node = data_map[partition]
    predicted_queries = predicted_load[partition]
    node_load = utilization[node]
    cost += predicted_queries * (1 + node_load)  // Higher load = higher cost
  return cost
```

**Integration Points:**

*   The QPA runs continuously, analyzing query logs.
*   The DAM runs periodically (e.g., hourly) to recalculate the optimal data map.
*   The DDM executes the recommended data migrations.
*   All components communicate via a shared metadata store (e.g., ZooKeeper, etcd) to maintain a consistent view of the data map.
