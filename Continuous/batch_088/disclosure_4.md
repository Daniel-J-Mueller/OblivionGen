## Dynamic B-Tree Sharding with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the B-tree’s capabilities by dynamically sharding the tree based on access patterns *and* preemptively prefetching data not just for siblings, but for entire subtrees predicted to be traversed based on those patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Adaptive Shard Map:** A hierarchical map representing the sharded B-tree.  Each node in the map corresponds to a range of keys within the original B-tree. This map is dynamic – shards can be created, merged, or relocated.
*   **Prediction Engine Data:**  Stores historical access patterns (key ranges, frequency of access) for each shard.  This is a rolling window of data.
*   **Prefetch Queue:**  A priority queue holding requests for subtree prefetching.  Priority is determined by predicted access probability and subtree size.
*   **Shard Location Table:** Maps key ranges to physical shard locations (memory addresses, disk blocks, network addresses in a distributed system).

**2. Algorithm – Core Logic:**

*   **Initial State:**  The database begins as a single, monolithic B-tree.
*   **Monitoring Phase:** Continuously monitor key access patterns across the B-tree.
*   **Shard Identification:** When a specific key range experiences a sustained high access frequency (threshold configurable), identify it as a candidate for sharding.
*   **Shard Creation:**
    *   Split the identified key range into a new shard.
    *   Update the Adaptive Shard Map and Shard Location Table.
    *   Migrate the data corresponding to the new shard to its designated storage location.
*   **Dynamic Merging:**  If a shard experiences consistently low access, merge it back into a neighboring shard.
*   **Predictive Prefetching:**
    *   **Pattern Analysis:**  The Prediction Engine analyzes access patterns to identify frequently traversed subtrees.
    *   **Subtree Identification:** Based on the current key being accessed and historical data, predict the next likely subtrees to be accessed.
    *   **Prefetch Request:**  Create a prefetch request for the predicted subtrees, prioritizing based on probability and subtree size.
    *   **Asynchronous Prefetching:**  Asynchronously load the data for the requested subtrees into a dedicated prefetch buffer.
    *   **Data Delivery:** When the data is requested, serve it directly from the prefetch buffer (if available).

**3. Pseudocode – Core Prefetching Logic:**

```
function prefetch_subtree(current_key, access_history):
    predicted_subtree = predict_next_subtree(current_key, access_history)
    if predicted_subtree is not null:
        if predicted_subtree is not already in prefetch_buffer:
            priority = calculate_prefetch_priority(predicted_subtree)
            add_to_prefetch_queue(predicted_subtree, priority)
            load_subtree_into_buffer(predicted_subtree)
    return
```

```
function load_subtree_into_buffer(subtree):
    // Asynchronously load data from storage (disk, network, etc.)
    // Use multi-threading to avoid blocking the main thread
    // Ensure data consistency using appropriate locking mechanisms
    // Update prefetch buffer metadata
    return
```

**4. System Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Monitor:** Captures and aggregates key access data.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Implements machine learning algorithms to predict future access patterns.
*   **Shard Manager:**  Handles shard creation, merging, and relocation.
*   **Prefetch Manager:** Manages the prefetch queue and data loading.
*   **Storage Layer:** Provides access to the underlying data storage.

**5. Scalability & Distribution:**

*   Shards can be distributed across multiple physical nodes in a distributed system.
*   The Shard Manager can be replicated for fault tolerance.
*   The Prefetch Manager can be scaled horizontally to handle a large number of prefetch requests.

**6. Adaptive Parameters:**

*   Shard size (minimum and maximum).
*   Threshold for shard creation.
*   Prefetch queue priority calculation parameters.
*   Rolling window size for access history.

This system aims to significantly improve database performance by proactively loading data based on predicted access patterns and dynamically adapting the database structure to the workload. It's more than just sibling prefetching – it's about prefetching entire *subtrees*, effectively "warming up" the database for anticipated queries.
