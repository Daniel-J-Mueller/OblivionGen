## Virtual Machine State-Driven Automated Remediation

**Concept:** Expand the proactive status indicators into automated remediation steps triggered by the detected VM states. Instead of *just* informing the user a credential isn't available, *attempt to fix it*.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Remediation Action Library:** A database of pre-defined actions categorized by VM state and potential issue. Examples:
    *   `VM_NOT_READY & CREDENTIAL_MISSING`: Initiate VM startup sequence.
    *   `VM_READY & CREDENTIAL_MISSING & KEY_PAIR_PRESENT`: Attempt password reset using known key pair.
    *   `VM_READY & CREDENTIAL_MISSING & NO_KEY_PAIR`: Prompt user for key pair import/creation.
    *   `VM_RUNNING & HIGH_CPU`: Initiate CPU throttling or resource reallocation.
    *   `VM_RUNNING & LOW_DISK_SPACE`: Initiate disk space cleanup or expansion.
*   **Policy Engine:** Allows administrators to define policies governing automated remediation. This includes:
    *   Allowed remediation actions per VM type or user group.
    *   Thresholds for triggering remediation (e.g., CPU usage > 90%).
    *   Logging and auditing of all remediation actions.
*   **State Detection Module:** (Builds upon the existing patentâ€™s detection mechanism).  Expanded to monitor a wider range of VM states beyond credential availability, including:
    *   CPU usage
    *   Memory usage
    *   Disk space
    *   Network connectivity
    *   Operating system health (e.g., critical errors logged)

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The State Detection Module continuously monitors VM states.
2.  **State Analysis:** When a state deviates from the expected norm (or a credential issue is detected), the system analyzes the current VM state.
3.  **Policy Lookup:** The Policy Engine determines if automated remediation is allowed for the detected state and the current user/VM configuration.
4.  **Remediation Action Selection:** If remediation is allowed, the system selects the most appropriate action from the Remediation Action Library.
5.  **Action Execution:** The system executes the selected action. This might involve:
    *   Sending commands to the VM (e.g., restart, reset password).
    *   Allocating additional resources (e.g., CPU, memory, disk space).
    *   Triggering external services (e.g., backup, disaster recovery).
6.  **Status Update:** The system updates the user interface with the status of the remediation action.  Include a detailed log of actions taken.

**III. Pseudocode (Remediation Action Execution):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION ExecuteRemediationAction(vm_instance, action_name, action_parameters)
    IF action_name == "VM_STARTUP" THEN
        vm_instance.start()
        Log("VM Startup initiated.")
    ELSE IF action_name == "PASSWORD_RESET" THEN
        encrypted_password = GenerateNewPassword(vm_instance.key_pair)
        vm_instance.set_password(encrypted_password)
        Log("Password reset successful.")
    ELSE IF action_name == "RESOURCE_ALLOCATION" THEN
        vm_instance.allocate_resources(action_parameters["cpu"], action_parameters["memory"], action_parameters["disk"])
        Log("Resources allocated successfully.")
    ELSE
        Log("Unknown remediation action: " + action_name)
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**IV.  User Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Remediation History:** A detailed log of all automated remediation actions taken on each VM instance.
*   **Policy Management Console:** A centralized interface for administrators to define and manage remediation policies.
*   **Real-time Status:** Visual indicators showing the current status of each VM instance and any ongoing remediation actions.
