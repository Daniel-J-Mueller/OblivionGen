**Dynamic Cluster Weighting via User-Driven “Vibe” Assignment**

**Concept:** Extend the cluster-based recommendation system by allowing users to assign a subjective “vibe” to each cluster, influencing recommendation weighting. This goes beyond simple ratings or tags – it's a free-form emotional/experiential descriptor, processed via sentiment analysis and mapped to weighting adjustments.

**Specs:**

1.  **User Interface – Cluster Vibe Input:**
    *   Within the collection management interface, provide a field alongside each cluster display labeled “Cluster Vibe.”
    *   Accept free-text input (e.g., “Cozy evenings,” “High-energy workouts,” “Gift ideas for Dad,” “Things I want to learn”).
    *   Include a visual representation of existing items within the cluster for context.

2.  **Sentiment Analysis Engine:**
    *   Integrate a natural language processing (NLP) engine capable of sentiment and emotion detection.
    *   Analyze the “Cluster Vibe” text to extract key emotional dimensions (valence, arousal, dominance).
    *   Map these dimensions to numerical weighting factors.  Example:
        *   High Valence (positive emotion) + High Arousal =  Weighting Increase (+20%) – prioritize recommendations from this cluster.
        *   Low Valence + Low Arousal = Weighting Decrease (-15%) – de-emphasize recommendations from this cluster.
        *   Neutral = No Weighting Adjustment.

3.  **Dynamic Recommendation Weighting:**
    *   Modify the existing recommendation engine to incorporate cluster weights.
    *   During recommendation generation, multiply the relevance score of items within a cluster by the corresponding cluster weight.
    *   Normalize weights across all clusters to ensure a balanced recommendation set.

4.  **“Vibe” Similarity Matching:**
    *   Implement a system to match user-defined “Vibes” with new items.
    *   When a user adds a new item to their collection, analyze its attributes (description, category, tags).
    *   Calculate a similarity score between the item and existing cluster “Vibes.”
    *   Automatically suggest the item be added to the most relevant cluster.

5.  **“Vibe” Drift Detection:**
    *   Monitor user interaction with recommendations from each cluster over time.
    *   If a cluster consistently generates low engagement despite a high “Vibe” weighting, flag it for review.
    *   Prompt the user to reconsider the assigned “Vibe” or suggest alternative descriptors.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Recommendation Generation Loop
FOR each user:
    clusters = GetUserClusters(user)
    FOR each cluster IN clusters:
        vibe = GetClusterVibe(cluster)
        weight = CalculateVibeWeight(vibe)  // Sentiment Analysis & Mapping
        items = GetClusterItems(cluster)
        FOR each item IN items:
            item.relevanceScore = item.relevanceScore * weight
    // Normalize scores across all clusters
    rankedItems = SortItemsByRelevance(items)
    OutputTopNRecommendations(rankedItems)
```

```
//CalculateVibeWeight(vibeText)
sentiment = AnalyzeSentiment(vibeText) //NLP engine
valence = sentiment.valence
arousal = sentiment.arousal
IF valence > 0.7 AND arousal > 0.7:
    weight = 1.2
ELSE IF valence < -0.3 AND arousal < -0.3:
    weight = 0.85
ELSE:
    weight = 1.0
RETURN weight
```
