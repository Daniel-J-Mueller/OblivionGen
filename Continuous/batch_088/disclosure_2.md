## Dynamic Timecode Warping for Stylistic Video Editing

**Concept:** Extend the timecode assignment beyond simple frame-to-time mapping to allow for stylistic manipulation of perceived time within a video. This isn't about fixing variable frame rates; it's about *intentionally* altering the timing of events for artistic effect.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** "Temporal Sculptor" - A module integrated into the transcoding pipeline. It operates *after* the initial timecode assignment described in the patent but *before* final encoding.
*   **Input:** Video stream with established timecodes (from the patent's system).  Additionally accepts a "Timing Curve" – a user-defined function or set of control points that defines the desired temporal distortion. This curve maps input timecodes to output timecodes.
*   **Timing Curve Parameters:**
    *   *Scale Factor:* Global adjustment of video speed.
    *   *Ramp Points:* Control points defining acceleration/deceleration sections.  Ramp type (linear, exponential, etc.) selectable per point.
    *   *Freeze Frames:* Ability to designate specific timecodes (or ranges) to be extended into freeze frames. Duration user-definable.
    *   *Reverse Sections:* Define segments of video to play in reverse.  Start and end timecodes for reversal user-definable.
    *   *Beat Matching:* Integration with audio analysis. The Timing Curve can be automatically adjusted to synchronize video cuts with detected beats in the audio track.
*   **Warping Algorithm:** The Temporal Sculptor uses a combination of techniques:
    *   *Frame Blending:* For smooth speed changes and transitions, frames are blended together to create intermediate frames.
    *   *Frame Dropping/Duplication:* For abrupt speed changes or stylistic effect.
    *   *Optical Flow Analysis:*  To improve frame blending and reduce motion artifacts. Analyze movement between frames to inform blending/interpolation.
    *   *Motion Vector Retiming:*  Extract motion vectors from frames, retime them based on the Timing Curve, and use them to synthesize new frames or improve blending.
*   **Output:**  A modified video stream with new timecodes reflecting the applied temporal distortion. The original timecodes are preserved as metadata for reference or revertibility.
*   **Metadata:** Along with the original timecodes, the applied Timing Curve is stored as metadata. This allows for easy modification or removal of the effect.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function WarpTime(videoStream, timingCurve) {
  originalTimecodes = GetTimecodes(videoStream);
  newTimecodes = [];
  for (each frame in videoStream) {
    timecode = GetTimecode(frame);
    newTimecode = ApplyTimingCurve(timecode, timingCurve); // Maps old to new time
    
    //Adjust frame display time based on newTimecode
    frameDisplayTime = newTimecode – previousFrameDisplayTime
    
    //Interpolate frames if needed
    if(frameDisplayTime < minimumDisplayTime){
       //Blend/create additional frames using optical flow analysis
    }
    
    newTimecodes.append(newTimecode);
    
  }

  SetTimecodes(videoStream, newTimecodes);
  StoreMetadata(videoStream, originalTimecodes, timingCurve);
  return videoStream;
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Music Videos:** Synchronize video edits precisely with the beat of a song.
*   **Stylized Editing:** Create dreamlike or surreal video effects.
*   **Slow Motion/Fast Forward:** Achieve more creative control over speed ramping.
*   **Dynamic Zooming:** Combine time warping with spatial scaling for unique visual effects.
*   **Interactive Video:** Allow viewers to manipulate the timing of video events in real-time.
