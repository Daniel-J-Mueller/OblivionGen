## Decentralized Sensor Fusion & Predictive Maintenance - Mobile Device Network

**Concept:** Leverage the companion computer system architecture to create a decentralized network of mobile device sensors for predictive maintenance applications, moving beyond individual device optimization to collective insights.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Data Aggregation & Anonymization Module (Companion Computer):**

*   **Function:** Receives raw sensor data streams (accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, microphone – with user consent) from the associated mobile device.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Applies noise reduction and data smoothing algorithms.
    *   Performs feature extraction relevant to potential equipment failure modes (e.g., vibration frequency analysis, temperature gradient calculation).
    *   Applies differential privacy techniques to anonymize data before transmission.  (Epsilon and Delta values configurable server-side).
    *   Formats data into a standardized payload (Protocol Buffer or similar).
*   **Communication:** Transmits anonymized feature vectors to a designated 'Edge Aggregator' (see component 3).

**2. Mobile Device Agent (Mobile Device):**

*   **Function:**  Facilitates secure data transmission and manages user consent.
*   **Operation:**
    *   Collects sensor data based on configurable sampling rates and sensor selection.
    *   Enforces user-defined privacy policies (e.g., which sensors are shared, data retention period).
    *   Establishes a secure channel (TLS/DTLS) to the companion computer.
    *   Provides metadata about the device (model, operating system, usage patterns – anonymized).
    *   Implements a ‘context awareness’ module – can selectively activate data collection based on user activity (e.g., only collect vibration data while the device is stationary).

**3. Edge Aggregator (Server-Side - could be containerized):**

*   **Function:** Receives anonymized feature vectors from multiple companion computers.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Performs aggregation and statistical analysis of the received data.
    *   Utilizes a distributed machine learning model (e.g., Federated Learning) to identify patterns indicative of potential equipment failure.
    *   Maintains a ‘health index’ for each monitored asset based on aggregated sensor data.
*   **Communication:**  Sends alerts and predictive maintenance recommendations to a central monitoring platform.

**4. Predictive Maintenance Engine (Server-Side):**

*   **Function:** Interprets the health index and generates actionable insights.
*   **Operation:**
    *   Employs a rule-based system and/or machine learning models to correlate health index changes with specific failure modes.
    *   Generates predictive maintenance recommendations (e.g., schedule maintenance, replace component).
    *   Provides a user interface for visualizing health data and managing maintenance schedules.

**Pseudocode (Companion Computer - Sensor Data Aggregation):**

```python
def process_sensor_data(raw_data):
  # Noise Reduction (e.g., Kalman Filter)
  smoothed_data = apply_kalman_filter(raw_data)

  # Feature Extraction
  features = extract_features(smoothed_data) # Vibration Frequency, Temperature Gradient, etc.

  # Differential Privacy (add noise)
  epsilon = 0.1 #Privacy Budget
  delta = 1e-5
  noisy_features = add_laplace_noise(features, epsilon, delta)

  return noisy_features

def transmit_data(features):
  # Securely transmit features to Edge Aggregator
  send_to_edge_aggregator(features)

# Main Loop
while True:
  raw_data = get_sensor_data()
  features = process_sensor_data(raw_data)
  transmit_data(features)
  sleep(0.1)
```

**Novelty:** This shifts the focus from optimizing a single device to leveraging a *network* of devices as a distributed sensor network.  The differential privacy component addresses privacy concerns while still enabling valuable insights.  Federated learning allows for model training without centralizing sensitive data.  This architecture could be applied to various domains – industrial equipment monitoring, infrastructure health assessment, smart city applications, and even predictive maintenance for vehicles.
