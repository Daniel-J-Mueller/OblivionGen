## Modular, Bio-Inspired Wall Mount with Integrated Environmental Sensing

**Concept:** A wall mount system that mimics the adhesion and articulation of gecko feet and plant tendrils, combined with embedded environmental sensors for smart home/security applications. The mount isn't just *holding* the camera, but actively interacting with its environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Mount Body:** Constructed from a layered, flexible polymer matrix (e.g., TPU) containing microscopic, angled setae (similar to gecko feet). These setae create van der Waals forces for adhesion to various wall surfaces (painted drywall, tile, wood, etc.). Layered construction allows for tunable stiffness – softer layers for better adhesion on uneven surfaces, firmer layers for structural support.
*   **Adhesion Control:** Integrated micro-pneumatic chambers within the mount body allow for controlled inflation/deflation, modulating the effective surface area and adhesion force of the setae. This enables the mount to ‘release’ and reposition itself if necessary, or to withstand dynamic loads.  Controlled by onboard microcontroller.
*   **Articulation:** "Tendril" segments connecting the mount body to the camera platform. These segments are constructed from shape memory alloy (SMA) wires encased in a flexible silicone sheath. Electrical current applied to the SMA wires causes them to contract or expand, enabling multi-axis articulation (pan, tilt, roll) of the camera.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Embedded within the mount body:
    *   **Microphone Array:** For acoustic event detection (e.g., glass breaking, voices) and source localization.
    *   **Passive Infrared (PIR) Sensor:** Motion detection.
    *   **Air Quality Sensor:** Measures VOCs, CO2, particulate matter.
    *   **Temperature/Humidity Sensor:** Environmental monitoring.
    *   **Vibration Sensor:** Detects unusual vibrations potentially indicating forced entry.
*   **Power & Communication:** Wireless power transfer (Qi standard) via inductive charging.  Communication via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Onboard AI for sensor data fusion and anomaly detection.
    *   Remote control and monitoring via mobile app.
    *   API for integration with smart home platforms (e.g., Amazon Alexa, Google Home).
*   **Mounting System:** Magnetic base plate to simplify initial mounting and removal for maintenance/charging.
*   **Materials:**
    *   TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) for flexible layers.
    *   Shape Memory Alloy (Nickel-Titanium) for articulation.
    *   Silicone for protective sheaths.
    *   Polycarbonate for base plate and structural components.

**Pseudocode (Articulation Control):**

```
// Function: AdjustCameraAngle(axis, angle)
// Input: axis (String: "pan", "tilt", "roll"), angle (Float: desired angle in degrees)
// Output: None

function AdjustCameraAngle(axis, angle) {
  currentAngle = GetCurrentAngle(axis);
  angleDifference = angle - currentAngle;

  if (abs(angleDifference) > 0.1) { // Prevent jitter
    // Calculate current required for SMA wire based on angle difference
    current = MapAngleToCurrent(angleDifference);

    // Apply current to SMA wire controlling the specified axis
    ApplyCurrentToSMA(axis, current);

    // Wait for SMA wire to contract/expand
    Wait(500ms);

    // Update current angle
    SetCurrentAngle(axis, angle);
  }
}

//Function: MapAngleToCurrent(angleDifference)
//Input: angleDifference (Float)
//Output: current (Float)
function MapAngleToCurrent(angleDifference){
  current = angleDifference * K_CONSTANT //K_CONSTANT is a calibration value.
  return current
}
