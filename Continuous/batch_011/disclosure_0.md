## Adaptive Pre-emptive Content Stitching for Mixed Reality

**Concept:** Expand the prediction of communication unavailability to proactively stitch together mixed reality (MR) experiences *before* network loss, creating a seamless transition to offline operation. This moves beyond pre-downloading simple 'content' to dynamically assembling interactive environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Predictive Environment Assembler (PEA):**
    *   Input: Device information (location, speed, battery, network signal strength), user event information (MR application in use, gaze direction, interaction history), *and* environmental scan data (LiDAR, cameras).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Offline Environment Profile Generation:** Based on historical data and current context, PEA predicts likely MR experience scenarios during potential network loss (e.g., tunnel passage, elevator ride, remote area entry).
        2.  **Content Chunking & Prioritization:** Divides available MR content into logical 'chunks' (e.g., room geometry, object models, textures, audio loops).  Assigns priority based on user gaze direction, interaction probability and environmental context. High-priority chunks are those most likely to be needed *immediately*.
        3.  **Stitching Pipeline:** Pre-renders or pre-processes these chunks for offline rendering. Stitching logic handles blending, level-of-detail (LOD) transitions, and physics simulations. Focus on spatial audio rendering to maintain immersion.
        4.  **Dynamic LOD Adjustment:** PEA dynamically adjusts LOD based on device performance and predicted network availability.
        5.  **Compression & Storage:**  Optimized compression algorithms to minimize storage requirements.
*   **Component 2: Seamless Transition Manager (STM):**
    *   Input:  Network connection status, PEA-prepared environment chunks, STM status flags (transitioning, offline, online).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Network Loss Detection:** Monitors network connectivity.
        2.  **Offline Mode Activation:** Upon network loss, STM instantly switches to the pre-assembled offline environment.
        3.  **Offline Interaction Handling:** Manages user interactions within the offline environment (limited functionality based on chunk priority).
        4.  **Network Re-establishment:** Upon network recovery, STM seamlessly blends the online experience with the offline environment. Prioritizes re-streaming high-fidelity assets.
*   **Component 3: Contextual Data Streamer (CDS):**
    *   Input: User location, device orientation, gaze direction.
    *   Process:
        1.  **Predictive Asset Streaming:**  Anticipates required assets based on user movement and context (e.g., streaming higher-resolution textures for objects entering the user's field of view).
        2.  **Opportunistic Downloading:** Downloads assets during periods of strong network connectivity (e.g., while stationary).
        3.  **Content Caching:**  Maintains a cache of frequently accessed assets.

**Pseudocode (STM - Offline Mode Activation):**

```
FUNCTION ActivateOfflineMode():
  IF NetworkLost() AND NOT IsOffline():
    StopOnlineRendering()
    LoadPreAssembledEnvironment()
    InitializeOfflinePhysics()
    EnableOfflineInputHandling()
    SetIsOffline(TRUE)
    DisplayOfflineIndicator() // Subtle visual cue
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This is not simply pre-loading assets. It’s a proactive system building a *reactive* offline MR experience based on predictive analytics and environmental context. The stitching pipeline and dynamic LOD are critical for maintaining immersion. It moves beyond 'offline content' to 'offline *experience*'. The system’s ability to stitch together a continuous MR experience even during network loss sets it apart. This expands beyond simple 'content delivery', to constructing full spatial experiences ahead of loss.
