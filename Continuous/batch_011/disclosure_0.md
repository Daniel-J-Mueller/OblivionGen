## Adaptive Multi-Band RF Harvesting & Power Distribution

**Concept:** Integrate energy harvesting capabilities into the PAN receiver to supplement or replace battery power, focusing on dynamically switching between harvested frequencies for optimal efficiency.

**Specifications:**

*   **RF Harvester Module:**
    *   Frequency Range: 2.4 GHz – 6 GHz (covers common PAN, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi bands, and emerging 5/6 GHz options).
    *   Antenna: Miniature, multi-band fractal antenna optimized for polarization diversity.
    *   Rectifier: High-efficiency Schottky diode-based rectifier with impedance matching network.
    *   DC-DC Converter: Buck-Boost converter with MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) algorithm. Input voltage range: 0.3V – 1.5V. Output voltage: 3.3V (regulated).
    *   Power Management IC: Dedicated IC to manage harvested energy storage and distribution.
*   **Energy Storage:**
    *   Supercapacitor: 500 mF, 3.3V supercapacitor for energy buffering. Chosen for high cycle life and rapid charge/discharge rates.
    *   Charge Controller: Integrated into Power Management IC. Implements overcharge, over-discharge, and short-circuit protection.
*   **Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS) Algorithm:**
    *   Real-time Spectrum Scanning: Continuously monitor RF energy levels across the 2.4-6 GHz band.
    *   Band Prioritization: Prioritize bands based on signal strength, interference levels, and potential energy yield.
    *   Switching Mechanism: A microcontroller-controlled RF switch dynamically selects the optimal frequency band for energy harvesting.
    *   Adaptive Thresholds: Adjust sensitivity and thresholds based on device usage patterns and environmental conditions.
*   **Power Distribution Network:**
    *   Hierarchical Power Management: Prioritize power distribution to critical components (PAN receiver, CPU).
    *   Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS): Adjust voltage levels based on processing load to minimize power consumption.
    *   Power Gating: Disable unused modules to eliminate static power leakage.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of harvested energy levels and battery voltage.
    *   User-configurable parameters for DFS algorithm.
    *   Energy-aware scheduling algorithm to optimize device operation.

**Pseudocode (DFS Algorithm):**

```
initialize:
    scan_interval = 100ms
    priority_bands = [2.4GHz, 5GHz, 6GHz]  // Initial band order
    current_band = 2.4GHz

loop:
    every scan_interval:
        scan_spectrum()
        band_strengths = scan_result  // List of band strengths

        best_band = find_max(band_strengths)

        if best_band != current_band:
            switch_to_band(best_band)
            current_band = best_band

        if harvested_energy > threshold:
            power_critical_components(harvested_energy)
        else:
            use_battery_power()
```

**Novelty:** This design moves beyond simple RF harvesting by implementing a DFS algorithm to intelligently select the frequency band with the highest energy yield. This improves harvesting efficiency and allows the device to adapt to varying RF environments. The integration with dynamic power management further optimizes energy usage, potentially enabling self-powered PAN devices.
