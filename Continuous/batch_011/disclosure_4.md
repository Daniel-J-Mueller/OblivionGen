## Adaptive Reverberation Mapping with Spatial Audio Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend noise cancellation beyond simple masking to actively *reconstruct* the original audio signal by mapping and modeling reverberation characteristics of the environment. This goes beyond subtracting noise; it aims to "undo" the effects of the space itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+) integrated into the user device. High-fidelity audio output capable of reproducing spatial audio. Dedicated DSP or accelerator for real-time processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Reverberation Mapping Module:**
        *   Employs a swept sine wave or broadband noise emitted from the device’s speaker.
        *   Records the response from each microphone in the array.
        *   Utilizes beamforming and time-delay estimation to create a 3D map of the room’s impulse response. This map captures the strength and direction of reflections.
        *   This map is updated continuously to account for changes in the environment (e.g., moving furniture, people entering/leaving).
    *   **Audio Decomposition Module:**
        *   Incoming audio is split into direct and reverberant components using blind source separation techniques.
        *   The reverberant component is analyzed to determine its acoustic signature (e.g., decay time, spectral characteristics).
    *   **Spatial Reconstruction Module:**
        *   Uses the reverberation map and the acoustic signature of the reverberant component to *synthesize* an approximation of the original, direct sound signal.
        *   This synthesized signal is combined with the remaining direct sound (from the decomposition module).
        *   A spatial audio engine (e.g., Ambisonics or Vector Base Amplitude Panning) then reconstructs the sound field, effectively "removing" the effects of the room's reflections.
        *   The final reconstructed audio is outputted through the device’s speakers.
*   **AI/ML Component:**
    *   A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict the room's impulse response from a limited set of initial measurements. This allows for faster and more accurate reverberation mapping.
    *   A generative adversarial network (GAN) trained to synthesize realistic reverberant audio from a limited set of training data. This improves the quality of the reconstructed audio.

**Pseudocode (Spatial Reconstruction Module):**

```
// Inputs:
//   direct_audio: Audio signal representing the direct sound
//   reverberant_audio: Audio signal representing the reverberant sound
//   reverberation_map: 3D map of the room's impulse response
//   spatial_audio_engine: Object responsible for spatial audio rendering

function reconstruct_audio(direct_audio, reverberant_audio, reverberation_map, spatial_audio_engine):
  // 1. Decompose reverberant audio into individual reflections
  reflections = decompose_reverberant_audio(reverberant_audio, reverberation_map)

  // 2. Invert the effects of each reflection
  inverted_reflections = []
  for reflection in reflections:
    inverted_reflection = invert_reflection(reflection, reverberation_map)
    inverted_reflections.append(inverted_reflection)

  // 3. Sum the inverted reflections and subtract from the original reverberant audio
  synthesized_reverberant_audio = sum(inverted_reflections)

  // 4. Combine the direct audio with the synthesized reverberant audio
  reconstructed_audio = direct_audio + synthesized_reverberant_audio

  // 5. Render the reconstructed audio using the spatial audio engine
  spatialized_audio = spatial_audio_engine.render(reconstructed_audio)

  return spatialized_audio
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Reverberation Profiles:** Store and recall reverberation profiles for different environments.
*   **Active Reverberation Control:** Dynamically adjust the reverberation map to create different acoustic environments.
*   **Integration with Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Create immersive spatial audio experiences.
