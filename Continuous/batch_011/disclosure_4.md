## Modular Bio-Integrated Cooling System

**Concept:** Expand the passive cooling concept to incorporate bio-integration, leveraging plant transpiration for enhanced cooling and air purification within enclosed environments. The system utilizes a modular, layered approach, integrating plant growth with the vane-based air channeling of the original patent.

**System Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** 1m x 1m x 0.5m (scalable). Units connect edge-to-edge.
*   **Frame Material:** Lightweight, recycled plastic composite. Perforated for airflow.
*   **Vane Structure:**  Modified from patent – horizontally extending, perforated vanes.  Vane angle adjustable via integrated micro-servo motors controlled by a central unit.
*   **Planting Medium:** Hydroponic/Aeroponic system – layered felt/mesh substrate for root growth, pre-seeded with fast-growing, high-transpiration plants (e.g., pothos, spider plants, ferns).  Nutrient solution reservoir and automated delivery system.
*   **Water Management:**  Collected condensate from vanes (as per patent) is *recirculated* to the plant hydroponic system. Overflow routed to external drainage/storage. Humidity sensors regulate recirculation rate.
*   **Airflow Control:**  Micro-servo-controlled vanes adjust airflow based on temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels. Algorithm prioritizes maximized plant transpiration cooling *and* efficient air purification.
*   **Lighting:** Integrated LED grow lights with adjustable spectrum. Powered by renewable energy source (solar/wind).
*   **Sensors:** Temperature, humidity, CO2, light intensity, nutrient levels, water levels. Data transmitted to central control unit.
*   **Control Unit:**  Raspberry Pi-based system. Runs AI algorithm that optimizes cooling, airflow, and plant health. Remote access via web interface/mobile app.
*   **Modular Connectivity:**  Units connect via magnetic locking mechanism *and* data/power transfer cables. Facilitates easy expansion/reconfiguration.
*   **Biofilm Integration:** Encourage the growth of beneficial biofilms on the vane surfaces to further enhance air purification and nutrient cycling.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Define thresholds
TEMP_THRESHOLD = 25C
HUMIDITY_THRESHOLD = 60%
CO2_THRESHOLD = 800ppm

// Main loop
while (true) {

  // Read sensor data
  temp = readTemperature()
  humidity = readHumidity()
  co2 = readCO2()

  // Adjust vane angles
  if (temp > TEMP_THRESHOLD) {
    increaseVaneAngle(maximizeAirflowThroughPlants)
  } else if (humidity > HUMIDITY_THRESHOLD) {
    decreaseVaneAngle(reduceMoistureBuildup)
  }

  if (co2 > CO2_THRESHOLD) {
    optimizeVaneAngle(maximizeAirflowThroughPlants) // Enhanced air exchange for CO2 reduction
  }

  // Monitor water levels and nutrient levels
  if (waterLevelLow()) {
    activatePump(refillReservoir)
  }

  if (nutrientLevelLow()) {
    activateDispenser(addNutrients)
  }

  //Log Data to database
  logData(temp, humidity, co2, waterLevel, nutrientLevel, vaneAngles)
  delay(10 seconds)

}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Data centers
*   Greenhouses
*   Indoor farms
*   Living walls
*   Office buildings
*   Residential HVAC systems.
