## Dynamic Content ‘Ghosting’ for Predictive Pre-fetching

**Concept:** Extend the retroactive bidding and impression tracking to proactively ‘ghost’ content onto a semi-connected device *before* a user explicitly requests it, based on predictive modeling.  Essentially, pre-populate the device with likely content, weighted by bid amounts, to create a seamless, near-instant user experience, even when intermittently connected.  This isn't just caching; it's *predictive* caching informed by real-time bidding data.

**Specs:**

*   **Predictive Model:**  A server-side machine learning model trained on user interaction data (impressions, clicks, dwell time), network connectivity patterns of the semi-connected device, real-time bid data for available content, and historical campaign performance.  Model outputs a probability score for each piece of content being relevant to the user *at a future time*.
*   **Content ‘Ghosting’ Module:**  A server-side component responsible for identifying content to ‘ghost’ onto the device.  Selection criteria:
    *   Probability score > threshold (configurable).
    *   Current bid amount > threshold (configurable).
    *   Network connectivity predicted to be intermittent/low bandwidth within a defined timeframe (based on historical data and real-time network monitoring).
*   **Device-Side ‘Shadow Buffer’:** A dedicated storage area on the semi-connected device to hold ‘ghosted’ content.  This buffer is separate from the standard content cache and utilizes a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy, prioritizing content with higher predicted relevance and bid amounts.
*   **Adaptive Buffer Size:** The size of the ‘shadow buffer’ dynamically adjusts based on:
    *   Available storage space.
    *   Network connectivity quality (larger buffer for more intermittent connections).
    *   User interaction patterns (buffer size increases with user engagement).
*   **Metadata Transmission:** Along with the content, transmit metadata including:
    *   Predicted relevance score.
    *   Original bid amount.
    *   Content source/campaign ID.
    *   Expiration timestamp (content is automatically purged after a defined period).
*   **Impression Handling:** When the user interacts with content:
    *   If the content was ‘ghosted’ (found in the shadow buffer): Serve it immediately from the buffer, bypassing network request.  Log a ‘pre-fetched impression’ with a reduced cost (as the network wasn't utilized).
    *   If the content wasn't ‘ghosted’: Serve it as usual.
*    **Bid Adjustment:**
    *   Monitor the performance of ‘ghosted’ content (impressions, clicks, dwell time).
    *   Adjust bid amounts based on ‘pre-fetched impression’ data to optimize future ‘ghosting’ decisions.



**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function select_content_to_ghost(device_id):
  // Get user interaction data, network connectivity, bid data
  user_data = get_user_data(device_id)
  network_data = get_network_data(device_id)
  bid_data = get_bid_data()

  // Calculate prediction scores for each content
  content_scores = calculate_prediction_scores(user_data, network_data, bid_data)

  // Filter and sort content by score and bid amount
  eligible_content = filter_eligible_content(content_scores)
  sorted_content = sort_content_by_score_and_bid(eligible_content)

  // Select top N content to ghost
  ghost_content = sorted_content[:N]

  return ghost_content

function send_ghost_content(device_id, ghost_content):
  // Package content and metadata
  package = create_package(ghost_content)

  // Transmit package to device
  transmit_package(device_id, package)

```
