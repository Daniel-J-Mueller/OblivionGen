**Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition**

**Concept:** Extend media presence detection beyond simple "media/not media" classification to *compose* an acoustic scene understanding based on detected sound sources. Instead of just identifying *that* media is playing, infer *what* kind of media, and combine this with ambient sounds to build a richer acoustic representation of the environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel audio stream (minimum 2 channels preferred for spatial analysis).
*   **Core Modules:**
    *   **Source Separation:** Employ a neural network (e.g., Open-Unmix, Demucs) to separate the input audio into distinct sound sources. This generates multiple audio streams, each representing an estimated source (e.g., speech, music, environmental sounds).
    *   **Media Classification:** Utilize a fine-tuned audio classification model (e.g., PANNs, YAMNet) to identify the *type* of media present in each separated stream. Categories should include (but not be limited to): news, podcast, movie dialogue, music genre (pop, rock, classical, etc.), game audio, advertisement.
    *   **Environmental Sound Analysis:** A second audio classification model trained to identify environmental sounds (e.g., traffic, birdsong, rain, human conversation, appliance noises).
    *   **Acoustic Scene Composer:** A module that combines the outputs of the classification models and source separation. This module assigns weights to each identified sound source based on its prominence (determined from source separation output) and context (determined by historical data and user profile).  The output is a probabilistic representation of the acoustic scene, expressed as a vector of sound source probabilities (e.g., [Music: 0.8, Speech: 0.1, Traffic: 0.05, Birds: 0.05]).
*   **Historical Context:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells to maintain a history of acoustic scene representations. This allows the system to:
    *   Predict likely sound sources based on past observations.
    *   Smooth out fluctuations in the acoustic scene representation.
    *   Adapt to changing environments and user behavior.
*   **User Profile Integration:** Allow users to define preferences for specific sound sources (e.g., “prioritize music over speech”) or to exclude certain sound sources altogether (e.g., “ignore traffic noise”).
*   **Output:** A structured representation of the acoustic scene, including:
    *   A probability vector representing the likelihood of each sound source.
    *   A textual description of the acoustic scene (e.g., “A lively pop song is playing in a quiet room with occasional traffic noise”).
    *   Metadata about identified media sources (e.g., song title, artist, genre).

**Pseudocode (Acoustic Scene Composer):**

```
function compose_scene(separated_audio_streams, media_classifications, environmental_classifications, historical_context, user_profile):
    scene_vector = {}
    for stream in separated_audio_streams:
        media_type = media_classifications[stream]
        environment_type = environmental_classifications[stream]
        stream_volume = calculate_volume(stream) // Simple RMS calculation or more advanced loudness metrics

        // Apply user preferences
        if user_profile.exclude(media_type):
            continue

        // Combine media and environment types
        if media_type != "None":
            scene_vector[media_type] = scene_vector.get(media_type, 0) + stream_volume
        else:
            scene_vector[environment_type] = scene_vector.get(environment_type, 0) + stream_volume

    // Incorporate historical context (LSTM prediction)
    historical_prediction = LSTM.predict(scene_vector)
    scene_vector = combine_vectors(scene_vector, historical_prediction, weight=0.3)

    // Normalize the scene vector to create a probability distribution
    total_volume = sum(scene_vector.values())
    for key in scene_vector:
        scene_vector[key] /= total_volume

    return scene_vector
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Home Automation:** Trigger actions based on the identified acoustic scene (e.g., adjust lighting based on music genre, silence notifications during movie playback).
*   **Context-Aware Applications:** Provide personalized content or services based on the user's surroundings (e.g., recommend relevant podcasts during commutes, suggest nearby restaurants based on ambient sounds).
*   **Accessibility:**  Describe the acoustic environment to visually impaired users.
*   **Acoustic Event Detection:** Identify specific events within the acoustic scene (e.g., detect a baby crying, a dog barking).
