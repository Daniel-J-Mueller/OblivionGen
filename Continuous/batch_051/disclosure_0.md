**Modular, Self-Adjusting Internal Support System for Flexible Carriers**

**Concept:** A system of dynamically adjusting, lightweight internal supports for the flexible bag component, enabling it to maintain structural integrity with variable load distributions and shapes. This differs from rigidizing the entire bag, instead offering localized reinforcement only where needed.

**Specs:**

1.  **Support Nodes:**
    *   Material: Shape memory alloy (Nitinol preferred) or a lightweight, high-strength polymer with embedded micro-actuators.
    *   Form Factor: Small, spherical or ovoid nodes (approx. 1-2cm diameter) with multiple connection points.
    *   Distribution: Nodes are integrated *within* the flexible bag material during manufacturing, forming a 3D lattice network. Density varies based on anticipated load zones (e.g., higher density at the bottom, lower density on sides).
    *   Power: Wireless power transfer (inductive charging) or integrated micro-batteries (rechargeable via contact or wireless). Power budget optimized for infrequent adjustments.
2.  **Actuation Mechanism:**
    *   Each node contains a micro-actuator (piezoelectric, shape memory alloy, or micro-motor).
    *   Actuators extend or retract connection points, altering the node's shape and rigidity.
    *   Nodes communicate wirelessly with a central control unit.
3.  **Sensor Network:**
    *   Integrated pressure sensors (piezoelectric or capacitive) throughout the bag's interior.
    *   Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) to detect bag orientation and movement.
    *   Data transmitted to the central control unit.
4.  **Central Control Unit:**
    *   Microcontroller with wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy preferred).
    *   Algorithm: Processes sensor data to determine load distribution and bag shape.
    *   Adjusts individual node actuators to maintain optimal support and prevent deformation.
    *   User Interface: Simple app for basic customization (e.g., rigidity settings, load profiles).
5.  **Integration with Rigid Basket:**
    *   Magnetic connectors (as in the patent) maintain positioning of flexible bag within rigid basket.
    *   Basket design allows access for wireless charging.
6.  **Material Specs**
    *   Flexible bag: Woven polypropylene or polyethylene with integrated node housings.
    *   Node Housings: Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) for flexibility and impact resistance.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Initialize sensors and actuators
// Calibrate sensor readings

LOOP:
    // Read sensor data (pressure, orientation)
    // Calculate load distribution based on pressure readings
    // Identify areas of high stress or deformation
    // FOR EACH node:
    //   IF node is in a high-stress area:
    //     EXTEND actuator to increase support
    //   ELSE:
    //     RETRACT actuator to reduce rigidity
    //   LIMIT actuator movement to prevent overextension or damage
    // DELAY for a short period (e.g., 100ms)
END LOOP
```

**Novelty:** This system doesn’t just provide a static reinforcement. It *dynamically* adjusts support based on the contents and how the bag is carried. It’s adaptable, intelligent, and could significantly improve the usability and durability of the flexible bag component.
