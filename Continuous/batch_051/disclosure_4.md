## Adaptive Heatmap Resolution Based on Object Scale

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on generating heatmaps to explain model inferences. This adaptation introduces a dynamic heatmap resolution system, scaling the granularity of the heatmap based on the size of the object being analyzed within the image. Smaller objects will receive higher-resolution heatmaps, while larger objects will have lower-resolution heatmaps. This optimizes computational resources and improves the interpretability of the explanation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Object Scale Detection:**
    *   The system must integrate with the object detection component (if present) or utilize image processing techniques to determine the bounding box dimensions (width, height) of the target object.
    *   Calculate the objectâ€™s area (width \* height).

2.  **Resolution Mapping Function:**
    *   Define a function to map object area to heatmap resolution. This could be linear, logarithmic, or a custom function. Example:
        `heatmap_resolution = base_resolution * (max_area / object_area)`
        Where:
        *   `base_resolution` is the default heatmap resolution (e.g., 224x224).
        *   `max_area` is the maximum object area considered for scaling (tuned empirically).
        *   `object_area` is the calculated area of the current object.
    *   Implement a minimum and maximum resolution limit to prevent excessively small or large heatmaps.

3.  **Superpixel Adaptation:**
    *   Modify the image segmentation component to generate superpixels that adapt to the determined heatmap resolution. This ensures that the superpixels align with the heatmap granularity.

4.  **SHAP Value Calculation Adjustment:**
    *   Adjust the SHAP value calculation to account for the varying superpixel sizes. This may involve weighting the SHAP values based on the superpixel area to ensure fair comparison across objects of different scales.

5.  **Visualization & Output:**
    *   The generated heatmap will be resized to the original image dimensions for visualization.
    *   Store the heatmap resolution alongside the heatmap data for reproducibility and analysis.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def generate_adaptive_heatmap(image, object_detection_results, base_resolution, max_area):
    # 1. Object Scale Detection
    bounding_boxes = object_detection_results # List of (x, y, width, height)
    object_area = bounding_boxes[0][2] * bounding_boxes[0][3]  # Area of the first detected object

    # 2. Resolution Mapping Function
    heatmap_resolution = int(base_resolution * (max_area / object_area))
    heatmap_resolution = max(64, min(heatmap_resolution, 512)) # Limit resolution

    # 3. Superpixel Adaptation
    segmentation_config = {
        "resolution": heatmap_resolution
    }
    superpixels = perform_segmentation(image, segmentation_config)

    # 4. SHAP Value Calculation Adjustment
    shap_values = calculate_shap_values(image, superpixels, model)
    weighted_shap_values = [value * (superpixel_area / total_image_area) for value, superpixel_area in zip(shap_values, superpixel_areas)]

    # 5. Visualization & Output
    heatmap = visualize_shap_values(weighted_shap_values, image)
    heatmap = resize(heatmap, original_image_dimensions)

    return heatmap, heatmap_resolution
