## Adaptive Resource Partitioning via Client-Side Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the translation/redirection concept to actively *partition* resource delivery based on predicted client capacity and network conditions, moving beyond simple URL translation. This isn't just *where* to get the resource, but *what version* of the resource to deliver.

**Specs:**

1.  **Client-Side Capacity Profiler:**
    *   Embedded within the client (via executable code provided by the service provider, building on the original patent's premise).
    *   Continuously monitors:
        *   CPU usage
        *   Memory availability
        *   Network bandwidth (estimated via ping/throughput tests)
        *   Battery level (mobile devices)
        *   Screen resolution & pixel density
    *   Generates a "Capacity Score" – a single numerical value representing the client's ability to handle complex content. This score is updated dynamically.
2.  **Content Versioning System (Server-Side):**
    *   For each core resource (image, video, script), the content provider creates multiple versions. Examples:
        *   Image: High-resolution, Medium-resolution, Low-resolution, WebP, AVIF
        *   Video: 4K, 1080p, 720p, 480p, various codecs (H.264, H.265, VP9)
        *   Scripts: Minified, unminified, modular, legacy compatibility versions
    *   Each version is tagged with a “Complexity Score” reflecting its processing demands (file size, decoding complexity, rendering requirements).
3.  **Prediction Engine (Client-Side):**
    *   Uses the Client Capacity Score *and* historical data (client's past performance with similar content) to *predict* the optimal Complexity Score for the requested resource.
    *   Algorithm: Linear regression or a simple neural network trained on client performance data.
4.  **Request Modification & Redirection:**
    *   Client generates a request for the resource, *including* its predicted optimal Complexity Score.
    *   Service provider intercepts the request.
    *   Based on the predicted score, the service provider redirects the client to the appropriate version of the resource.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Client monitors its performance *after* receiving the resource (rendering time, CPU usage).
    *   If performance is suboptimal, the client adjusts its Capacity Score and Prediction Engine, and requests a different version of the resource on the next load.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
capacityScore = calculateInitialCapacity()
predictionEngine = initializePredictionEngine()

// On Resource Request
function requestResource(resourceURL) {
  predictedComplexity = predictionEngine.predict(capacityScore, resourceURL)
  modifiedURL = generateModifiedURL(resourceURL, predictedComplexity) //Adds a parameter to the URL
  return fetch(modifiedURL)
}

// After Resource Load
function monitorPerformance(resource) {
  renderingTime = measureRenderingTime(resource)
  cpuUsage = measureCPUUsage(resource)

  if (renderingTime > threshold || cpuUsage > threshold) {
    capacityScore = adjustCapacityScore(capacityScore, renderingTime, cpuUsage)
    predictionEngine.train(capacityScore) //Refines the prediction model
  }
}

//Helper functions (implementation details omitted)
function calculateInitialCapacity() {...}
function initializePredictionEngine() {...}
function generateModifiedURL(resourceURL, complexity) {...}
function measureRenderingTime(resource) {...}
function measureCPUUsage(resource) {...}
function adjustCapacityScore(score, time, usage) {...}
```

**Server-Side Logic:**

*   The server receives a request with a URL *and* a requested complexity score.
*   It checks if a version of the resource exists that matches that complexity.
*   If found, it returns the URL of that version.
*   If not found, it returns a default version or an error.

This system proactively adjusts resource delivery based on real-time client conditions, enhancing the user experience and optimizing bandwidth usage.
