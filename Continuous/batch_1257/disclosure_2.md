**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Item Presentation:** Robotic arm retrieves inventory item and presents it to the multi-spectral imaging array.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** Array captures multi-spectral images, weight, and environmental data.
3.  **Image Processing:** Images are processed to extract features, identify the item, and detect defects.
4.  **Degradation Prediction:** Data is fed into the predictive degradation model to estimate remaining shelf life.
5.  **Data Integration:** Results are transmitted to the inventory management system.
6.  **Alerting:** System generates alerts for items nearing expiration or exhibiting signs of damage.

**Pseudocode (Degradation Prediction):**

```
function predict_degradation(item_id):
    // Retrieve historical data
    history = database.get_history(item_id)
    // Extract features
    features = extract_features(history)
    // Load pre-trained model
    model = load_model("degradation_model")
    // Predict degradation rate
    degradation_rate = model.predict(features)
    // Calculate remaining shelf life
    remaining_shelf_life = original_shelf_life - degradation_rate * time_elapsed
    return remaining_shelf_life
```

**Novelty:** Combines multi-spectral imaging with predictive modeling to proactively manage inventory degradation and potential failures. Extends item-level inventory tracking to include degradation assessment, enabling more efficient resource allocation and reduced waste. This adds a proactive layer to the patent's reactive identification methods. It moves beyond *identifying* what arrived, and begins to assess *how good it is*, and *how long it will remain good*.
