**Personalized Narrative Stitching**

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of recap clips by not just *selecting* existing content, but dynamically *re-stitching* episodes to create personalized, short-form narratives. Think of it as a “choose your own adventure” for recap viewing, or a personalized director’s cut.

**Specs:**

1.  **Content Segmentation:** The system must be capable of segmenting each episode into discrete narrative 'units' – scenes, character arcs, plot points. This requires robust scene detection and semantic understanding of the media content.  Each unit should be tagged with metadata relating to characters present, emotional tone, and plot significance.

2.  **User Narrative Profile:**  Beyond playback history, create a "Narrative Profile" for each user. This profile captures not just *what* they watched, but *how* they reacted.  

    *   **Emotional Response Capture:** Integrate with device sensors (camera for facial expressions, microphone for vocal cues) to assess user emotional responses during viewing. This data should be analyzed to identify preferred emotional arcs and character relationships.
    *   **Interactive Choices (Optional):**  Periodically present users with binary choices during viewing ("Focus on Character A or Character B?", "Explore the Mystery or Focus on the Romance?"). These choices directly influence the Narrative Profile.
    *   **Implicit Preference Mining:** Analyze viewing patterns beyond simple completion – rewatching specific scenes, pausing on certain characters, fast-forwarding through disliked subplots.

3.  **Dynamic Stitching Engine:** The core of the system.  This engine takes the user's Narrative Profile and the segmented content as input and creates a personalized recap sequence.

    *   **Graph-Based Narrative Representation:** Represent each episode as a graph where nodes are narrative units and edges represent connections between them.  Weights on the edges represent the strength of the connection (e.g., causal relationship, thematic similarity).
    *   **Personalized Pathfinding:** Employ a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A\*) to identify a sequence of narrative units that maximizes relevance to the user's Narrative Profile.  The algorithm should prioritize units that feature preferred characters, emotional tones, and plot points.  Units already seen should have diminished relevance.
    *   **Seamless Transitions:**  Implement techniques to ensure smooth transitions between stitched-together units, including:
        *   **Automated Editing:** Crossfades, jump cuts, and other editing techniques.
        *   **Voiceover Narration:**  AI-generated voiceover to bridge gaps and provide context.
        *   **Music Integration:** Dynamically select background music that matches the emotional tone of the stitched sequence.

4.  **Recap Length Control:**  Allow users to specify a desired recap length (e.g., 30 seconds, 1 minute, 5 minutes). The stitching engine should adjust the sequence accordingly, prioritizing the most relevant units.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Engine):**

```
function stitch_recap(user_profile, segmented_content, desired_length):
  narrative_graph = build_graph(segmented_content)
  start_node = find_best_start_node(user_profile, narrative_graph)
  
  path = a_star(narrative_graph, start_node, user_profile) //Pathfinding algorithm
  
  trimmed_path = trim_path(path, desired_length)
  
  stitched_sequence = create_stitched_sequence(trimmed_path) //Combine scenes, add transitions

  return stitched_sequence
```

**Potential Downstream Enhancements:**

*   **Interactive Recaps:** Allow users to influence the recap narrative in real-time.
*   **Multi-Perspective Recaps:** Generate recaps that focus on different characters or storylines.
*   **“What If?” Recaps:** Explore alternative narrative possibilities based on user choices.
