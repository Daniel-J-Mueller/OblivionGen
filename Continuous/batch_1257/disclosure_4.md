**Dynamic Calibration Object Generation & Projection**

**Core Concept:** Instead of relying on a static, physical calibration object (checkerboard), generate and project a dynamic calibration pattern directly onto the scene using a micro-projector array or structured light system. This allows for calibration in arbitrary environments and dynamic adjustment during operation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Micro-Projector Array: A dense array of miniature projectors (e.g., DLP or LCoS) capable of projecting visible or near-infrared light. Resolution per projector: 640x480 minimum. Inter-projector spacing: 1-5cm. Total array size: 20x20 to 50x50 projectors.
    *   Structured Light Emitter (alternative): Array of IR LEDs with diffractive optics to create a complex, dynamic pattern.
    *   Synchronization System: Precise timing and synchronization circuitry to coordinate the projection or emission of all projectors/LEDs in the array.
    *   Camera System: Stereo camera setup (as described in the base patent) for capturing images of the projected pattern.
    *   Processing Unit: High-performance embedded system (GPU/FPGA) for real-time pattern generation, synchronization, and image processing.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**

    *   **Pattern Generation Module:**
        *   Generates a series of 2D and 3D calibration patterns.
        *   Patterns include: Checkerboards, grids, circles, and pseudo-random dot patterns.
        *   Supports dynamic pattern deformation (warping, scaling, rotation) to account for non-planar surfaces.
        *   Algorithm: Procedural generation with perlin noise to add variation.
    *   **Projection Control Module:**
        *   Controls the intensity and timing of each projector/LED in the array.
        *   Corrects for projector/LED misalignments and distortions.
        *   Implements a projection matrix to map the 2D pattern onto the 3D scene.
    *   **Image Processing Module:**
        *   Detects and tracks the projected pattern in the stereo images.
        *   Calculates the camera parameters and stereo calibration.
        *   Utilizes robust feature detection and matching algorithms (e.g., ORB, SIFT) optimized for the projected pattern.
        *   Performs bundle adjustment to refine the calibration parameters.
    *   **Dynamic Calibration Loop:**
        1.  Project a calibration pattern onto the scene.
        2.  Capture stereo images of the pattern.
        3.  Detect and track the pattern in the images.
        4.  Calculate the camera parameters and stereo calibration.
        5.  Refine the calibration parameters using bundle adjustment.
        6.  Repeat steps 1-5 periodically or on demand to maintain calibration accuracy.
*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Calibration Loop):**

```

    GenerateCalibrationPattern(PatternType, Parameters)
    ProjectPattern(Pattern)
    CaptureStereoImages(ImageLeft, ImageRight)
    DetectFeatures(ImageLeft, ImageRight, Pattern)
    MatchFeatures(FeaturesLeft, FeaturesRight)
    EstimateCameraPose(MatchedFeatures)
    RefineCalibration(Pose, IntrinsicParameters)
    UpdateStereoCalibration(IntrinsicParameters, ExtrinsicParameters)
ENDWHILE
```

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Initial Calibration:** Performs a full calibration of the stereo camera system.
    *   **Continuous Calibration:** Periodically recalibrates the system to compensate for drift and environmental changes.
    *   **Adaptive Calibration:** Adjusts the calibration parameters in real-time based on the detected scene geometry.
*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Robotics and Autonomous Navigation
    *   Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality
    *   3D Scanning and Reconstruction
    *   Industrial Inspection and Quality Control
