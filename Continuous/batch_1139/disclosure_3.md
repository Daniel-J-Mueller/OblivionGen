## Secure Channel Orchestration via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Concept:** Leverage Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and a distributed ledger (blockchain or similar) to manage and dynamically orchestrate secure communication channels, removing reliance on centralized key distribution or pre-configured trust relationships.  This builds upon the patent’s core idea of establishing secure channels but shifts the control plane to a decentralized, self-sovereign identity framework.

**Specification:**

**1. DID-Based Identity & Capability Registry:**

*   Each participating device (client, server, “third computer system” in the patent) possesses a DID.
*   Associated with each DID is a capability registry stored on a distributed ledger. This registry defines *types* of secure channels the device can establish and the associated cryptographic parameters/algorithms supported. Example:  “TLS 1.3 – ECDHE-RSA-AES256,” “Signal Protocol – Group Encryption.”  These are not *keys* themselves, but descriptions of supported capabilities.
*   A discovery service (potentially integrated with the distributed ledger) allows devices to query for other devices based on DID and supported capabilities.

**2. Dynamic Channel Negotiation & Establishment:**

*   When a client wants to communicate securely with a server (or another client), it initiates a capability discovery process using DIDs.
*   The client queries for the server’s DID and requests its supported capabilities.
*   Based on the intersection of supported capabilities, a secure channel negotiation begins.  Instead of a traditional handshake, the negotiation specifies the *type* of channel to establish (e.g., “TLS 1.3 – ECDHE-RSA-AES256”).
*   Key exchange is initiated *after* the channel type is agreed upon.  This key exchange can utilize established protocols (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) or utilize a new protocol leveraging the DID as an anchor for establishing trust.
*   Crucially, the key exchange process is mediated by a "channel broker" service. The broker does not have access to the keys, but it receives a hash of the key material and stores this hash in a secure ledger associated with the channel's DID. This provides non-repudiation and allows verification that the correct key material is being used.

**3.  Channel Broker Service:**

*   A distributed service responsible for facilitating channel establishment and providing auditability.
*   Receives channel requests, verifies capabilities, and coordinates key exchange.
*   Does *not* store keys – only hashes of key material for integrity checking.
*   Maintains a record of channel metadata (creation time, participants, capabilities) on the distributed ledger.
*   Supports channel revocation – a participant can revoke a channel, invalidating the associated hash and preventing further communication.

**4.  Pseudocode (Simplified Channel Establishment):**

```
// Client initiates
client_did = get_my_did()
server_did = lookup_server_did(target_server)
capabilities = get_server_capabilities(server_did)

// Find common capabilities
common_capabilities = intersection(my_capabilities, capabilities)
channel_type = select_channel_type(common_capabilities)

// Request channel establishment via broker
broker_request = {
  client_did: client_did,
  server_did: server_did,
  channel_type: channel_type
}

broker_response = send_request_to_broker(broker_request)

// Perform key exchange based on channel_type and broker confirmation
key_material = perform_key_exchange(broker_response)

// Send hash of key material to broker for verification
send_key_hash_to_broker(key_material)

// Establish secure channel using key_material
establish_secure_channel(key_material)
```

**5.  Security Considerations:**

*   The distributed ledger itself must be secured against tampering and unauthorized access.
*   The channel broker service must be resilient to denial-of-service attacks.
*   Key exchange protocols must be carefully selected and implemented to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   DID resolution and validation mechanisms must be robust to prevent spoofing.



This shifts the paradigm from relying on pre-established trust relationships or centralized key distribution to a more dynamic, self-sovereign approach where secure communication channels are orchestrated based on verifiable capabilities and decentralized identities.
