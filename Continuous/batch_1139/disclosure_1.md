## Dynamic Translation Granularity

**Concept:** Instead of translating entire content items or pages, dynamically break down content into granular 'translation units' based on user interaction and predicted attention. This moves beyond preemptive translation of whole pages and allows for just-in-time, highly focused translation, reducing latency and resource consumption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Segmentation Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw content (text, HTML, etc.) from web pages, search results, or other sources.
*   **Process:**  Utilize a combination of:
    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Identify sentence boundaries, phrases, and key entities.
    *   **Visual Layout Analysis:** Determine the visual hierarchy of content elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, images).
    *   **User Interaction Prediction:**  Employ machine learning models (trained on user behavior data - mouse movements, scrolling speed, dwell time, click patterns) to predict which content areas are most likely to attract user attention.
*   **Output:** A dynamic content map, consisting of:
    *   Translation Units (TUs): Smallest addressable content blocks (e.g., sentence, phrase, image alt-text). Each TU is assigned a unique identifier.
    *   Priority Score: A numerical value representing the predicted likelihood of user interaction with each TU.
    *   Dependency Graph:  A representation of relationships between TUs (e.g., a phrase is contained within a sentence, an image caption relates to the image).

**2.  Translation Request Manager:**

*   **Input:**  Dynamic content map, user interaction data (mouse position, scrolling, clicks), and available machine translation services.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Triggered Translation:** When the user's viewport (or mouse cursor) nears a high-priority TU, a translation request is sent to a designated machine translation service. 
    *   **Progressive Translation:** Translation requests are prioritized based on the TUâ€™s priority score. Lower-priority TUs are translated in the background, or on-demand.
    *   **Quality Tier Selection:** The appropriate machine translation service is chosen for each TU based on its priority, the user's language preferences, and the available resources. Critical content might use a high-quality (but slower) service, while background elements use a faster (but less accurate) service.
    *   **Adaptive Granularity:** The size of TUs can be dynamically adjusted.  For example, a complex sentence might be broken down into smaller phrases to improve translation accuracy.

**3.  Content Rendering & Replacement Module:**

*   **Input:** Translated content from machine translation services, original content, and dynamic content map.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Real-Time Replacement:** Translated content is seamlessly integrated into the webpage, replacing the original content with minimal visual disruption.
    *   **Caching:** Translated TUs are cached locally to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
    *   **Version Control:** Maintain both the original and translated versions of each TU for easy rollback or editing.
    *   **Visual Indicators:** Provide visual cues (e.g., subtle highlighting or icons) to indicate which content has been translated.

**Pseudocode (Translation Request Manager):**

```
function processUserInteraction(event) {
  viewport = getViewport();
  tUsInViewport = findTUsInViewport(viewport);

  for (tU in tUsInViewport) {
    if (tU.priority > threshold && !tU.translated) {
      service = selectTranslationService(tU.type, tU.priority);
      requestTranslation(service, tU.content, tU.languagePair);
      tU.translated = true;
    }
  }
}

function selectTranslationService(contentType, priority) {
  if (priority > 0.8) {
    return highQualityService;
  } else if (contentType == "imageAltText") {
    return fastService;
  } else {
    return defaultService;
  }
}
```

**Potential benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved user experience.
*   Lower resource consumption (bandwidth, processing power).
*   Increased translation accuracy (by focusing on relevant content).
*   Personalized translation experience (based on user interaction).
*   More efficient use of machine translation services.
