## Dynamic Content 'Echo' System

**Concept:** Expand the stylus-based content sharing to create a 'content echo' system where content isn’t simply *shared*, but dynamically replicated and tailored across multiple user devices based on proximity and interaction. This goes beyond simple file transfer; it’s about persistent, contextual content mirroring.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Roles:** Define three device roles: *Originator* (where content creation/selection begins – likely tablet/laptop), *Relay* (stylus/wearable), *Destination* (any connected display or computing device).
*   **Proximity Awareness:**  Utilize low-energy Bluetooth, UWB, or similar technologies to determine the proximity of Relay (stylus) to both Originator and potential Destinations.  Range should be configurable.
*   **Content 'Tagging':**  All digital content must be tagged with metadata including: content type (image, audio, video, document, application data), access permissions (public, shared, private), and ‘echo’ parameters (duration, range, modification rules).
*   **Echo Profiles:** User-definable profiles to control how content ‘echoes’ to Destinations. Options include:
    *   *Mirror*:  Identical copy of content.
    *   *Preview*: Reduced-resolution or excerpt of content.
    *   *Adaptive*: Content adjusts format based on Destination’s capabilities (e.g., text shrinks on a smartwatch).
    *   *Transient*: Content disappears after a set time or when the Relay moves out of range.
*   **Stylus as 'Pointer' & Command Center:** Stylus is not *just* an identifier. It acts as the primary interaction device. 
    *   Touching the stylus to a screen/surface selects content.
    *   Gestures with the stylus control echo profile, destination selection, and content manipulation.
    *   Haptic feedback confirms actions.
*   **Dynamic Destination Selection:** When the stylus is used to 'point' at a surface (e.g., a wall, a tabletop, another device screen), the system identifies the closest compatible Destination device and initiates the content echo.  Support for projecting onto surfaces via built-in or external projectors.
*   **Content Modification Rules:** Users can define rules for how echoed content is modified at the Destination:
    *   *Annotation Layer:*  Echoed content can be overlaid with stylus-drawn annotations at the Destination.
    *   *Data Stream Integration:* Echoed content can be combined with real-time data streams (e.g., weather, stock prices) at the Destination.
    *   *Application Integration:* Trigger actions in applications at the Destination (e.g., open a document, start a video call).

**Pseudocode (Stylus Interaction):**

```
// Stylus detects touch/gesture
event StylusGesture(gestureType, contentID) {
    if (gestureType == "select") {
        // Load content metadata for contentID
        metadata = getContentMetadata(contentID);

        // Display destination selection options (UI on Originator)
        showDestinationOptions(metadata.compatibleDestinations);

    } else if (gestureType == "point") {
        // Determine nearest compatible destination device
        destinationDevice = findNearestDevice(metadata.compatibleDestinations);

        // Apply echo profile (default or user-selected)
        echoProfile = getEchoProfile(metadata.defaultProfile);

        // Send content to destination with echo profile
        sendContent(contentID, destinationDevice, echoProfile);
    }
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Enhanced stylus with gesture recognition and proximity sensors.
*   Compatible computing devices (tablets, laptops, smartphones, smart displays).
*   Optional: Surface projection capabilities (built-in projectors or external projector integration).

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Interactive presentations where content dynamically appears on a shared display.
*   Collaborative design sessions where annotations and modifications are shared in real-time.
*   Immersive learning experiences where content is projected onto surfaces to create interactive environments.
*   Smart home control where users can point at devices to trigger actions.
