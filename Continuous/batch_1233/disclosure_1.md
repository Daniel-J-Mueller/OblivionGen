## Specimen Tube with Integrated Microfluidic Sorting

**Concept:** Integrate a microfluidic channel network *within* the specimen tube's internal wall structure to enable automated sorting of sample components *before* analysis. This goes beyond simply *holding* the sample; it actively pre-processes it.

**Specifications:**

*   **Tube Body:** Constructed from a rigid, optically clear polymer (e.g., cyclic olefin copolymer - COC) compatible with microfluidics and machine vision. Diameter: 10-15mm. Length: 60-100mm.
*   **Internal Wall â€“ Microfluidic Layer:** A thin (50-200um) layer of PDMS or similar biocompatible microfluidic material bonded to the inner surface of the tube wall.  This layer contains a network of microchannels.
*   **Channel Network Design:**
    *   **Inlet Port:** A small port at the open end of the tube for initial sample introduction.
    *   **Primary Channel:** A main channel running the length of the tube.
    *   **Branching Channels:** A series of bifurcating channels branching off the primary channel. These channels incorporate:
        *   **Hydrodynamic Focusing Elements:** To align sample particles.
        *   **Micro-Obstacles/Filters:**  Different sized obstacles to separate particles based on size.
        *   **Surface Functionalization:**  Channels coated with antibodies or other affinity ligands to capture specific target molecules (e.g., specific pathogens, cells).
    *   **Collection Reservoirs:** Micro-reservoirs at various points along the channel network to collect separated components.  These reservoirs are accessible from the exterior of the tube via laser-etched access ports.
    *   **Waste Channel:** A dedicated channel to direct unwanted materials to a separate waste reservoir.
*   **Fluidic Control:**
    *   **Integrated Micro-Pump/Valve System:**  Piezoelectric micro-pumps and valves integrated into the tube wall to control fluid flow through the channel network. Power and control signals are delivered via wireless communication (e.g., NFC).
    *   **Alternative: External Peristaltic Pump:**  The tube is designed to interface with an external peristaltic pump for precise fluid control.
*   **Optical Integration:**
    *   **Transparent Tube Sections:** Strategic sections of the tube wall are made from a highly transparent material to allow for optical detection (e.g., fluorescence microscopy) of sorted components.
    *   **Integrated Light Guide:** An optical fiber or light guide embedded in the tube wall to deliver illumination for detection.
*   **Sample Carrier Interface:** The sample carrier holding space (as defined in the patent) is modified to include microfluidic connectors. When a swab is inserted, it engages with these connectors, initiating fluid transfer into the microfluidic network.
*   **Material Compatibility:** All materials must be biocompatible, sterilizable (autoclavable or gamma irradiation compatible), and resistant to common reagents used in diagnostic testing.

**Operational Pseudocode:**
