## Adaptive Granularity Blockchain Records

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on time-based aggregation of document hashes into blockchain records. This design expands on that by introducing *adaptive granularity* – dynamically adjusting the scope of each blockchain record based on document change frequency and importance. Instead of a fixed time interval, the system monitors document activity and creates a record when a ‘significant’ change threshold is met.

**Specs:**

*   **Change Significance Metric:** Define a metric combining change frequency, change magnitude (number of characters altered, lines added/removed), and document importance weighting. Importance weighting can be user-defined (e.g., critical documents have higher weight) or determined by a classification model trained on document type/content.
*   **Adaptive Record Trigger:** A monitoring process continuously evaluates the change significance metric across all tracked documents. When the cumulative metric exceeds a predefined threshold, a new blockchain record is triggered.
*   **Dynamic Record Scope:** The triggered record includes *only* the documents whose changes contributed to exceeding the threshold.  This creates records that reflect meaningful activity, rather than including unchanged documents simply due to a time interval elapsing.
*   **Record Structure:**
    *   `Record_ID`: Unique identifier for the record.
    *   `Timestamp`: Time of record creation.
    *   `Document_List`: Array of document identifiers included in the record.
    *   `Hash_List`: Array of corresponding hashes for the document versions included.
    *   `Previous_Record_Hash`: Hash of the immediately preceding record, maintaining blockchain integrity.
    *   `Change_Significance_Score`: The cumulative score that triggered the record.
*   **Pseudocode (Record Creation):**

```
function CreateBlockchainRecord() {
  change_score = 0
  modified_docs = []
  for each doc in tracked_documents:
    if doc.has_changes():
      change_score += doc.get_change_magnitude() * doc.get_importance_weight()
      modified_docs.append(doc.id)

  if change_score > threshold:
    record = new BlockchainRecord()
    record.timestamp = current_time
    record.document_list = modified_docs
    record.hash_list = generate_hashes(modified_docs)
    record.previous_record_hash = hash(last_record)
    record.change_significance_score = change_score
    append_to_blockchain(record)
}
```

*   **Blockchain Integration:** Utilize a permissioned blockchain to control access and ensure data integrity.
*   **UI Component:** A dashboard visualizes record creation frequency and change significance scores, enabling administrators to tune the sensitivity of the adaptive granularity system.  Alerts trigger when change scores exceed predefined limits.
*   **Use Case:** Regulatory compliance in heavily audited industries (finance, healthcare). Records are created *only* when there’s meaningful change, reducing blockchain bloat and audit overhead.
