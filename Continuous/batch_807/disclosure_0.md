## Adaptive Iconography Based on User Gaze

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust user interface iconography (icons, text labels, tooltips) based on the user’s gaze direction and dwell time. This moves beyond simple highlighting to a system where the *representation* of the UI element changes to provide more or less information *before* interaction.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Eye-tracking hardware (integrated into display or external). Minimum resolution: 60Hz with accuracy of <1 degree of visual angle.
*   Processing unit capable of real-time gaze data analysis and UI element modification.
*   Display capable of rapidly updating UI elements (refresh rate >= 60Hz).

**III. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Gaze Data Acquisition:** Eye-tracking hardware provides X,Y coordinates of gaze position on the display.
2.  **UI Element Mapping:** A mapping layer associates each UI element with its screen coordinates and associated data (icon, label, tooltip, function).
3.  **Gaze-UI Intersection:** The system determines which UI element (if any) the user is currently looking at.
4.  **Dwell Time Calculation:**  Track the amount of time the user’s gaze remains fixed on a particular UI element.
5.  **Adaptive Iconography Engine:** This engine governs how UI element representations change based on gaze and dwell time.  This will include defined “states” for each element:
    *   **State 0: Default.** Standard icon/label.
    *   **State 1: Glance (0.1 – 0.5 seconds dwell).** Icon subtly animates, brief highlight. Tooltip begins to appear.
    *   **State 2: Focus (0.5 – 1.5 seconds dwell).** Icon becomes more detailed/complex. Full tooltip visible.  Potential for mini-preview of the function’s result.
    *   **State 3: Extended Focus ( > 1.5 seconds dwell).** Icon expands, more elaborate visual representation.  Contextual help or tutorial briefly displayed.  If the element represents a file, display file metadata.
6.  **Rendering Engine:** Modifies the display in real-time based on instructions from the Adaptive Iconography Engine.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```
function UpdateUI(gazeX, gazeY)

  // 1. Identify UI element under gaze
  element = FindElementAt(gazeX, gazeY)

  if element != null:
    dwellTime = CalculateDwellTime(element)

    if dwellTime < 0.5:
      SetElementState(element, "Glance")
    else if dwellTime < 1.5:
      SetElementState(element, "Focus")
    else:
      SetElementState(element, "ExtendedFocus")
  else:
    // Reset all elements to default state
    ResetAllElements()

end function

function SetElementState(element, state)

  switch state:
    case "Glance":
      AnimateIcon(element)
      ShowTooltip(element, brief = true)
    case "Focus":
      ShowDetailedIcon(element)
      ShowTooltip(element, full = true)
    case "ExtendedFocus":
      ExpandIcon(element)
      DisplayContextualHelp(element)
  end switch
end function
```

**V.  Innovation Focus:** The system aims to move *beyond* usability improvements to create a more intuitive, visually-rich user experience. By proactively providing information *before* interaction, it anticipates user needs and reduces cognitive load. The adaptive iconography isn’t merely about making things easier to see; it’s about creating a dynamic, responsive interface that feels more natural and engaging.
