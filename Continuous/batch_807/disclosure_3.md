## Adaptive Task Granularity & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** The core idea is to dynamically adjust the granularity of compute tasks *during* execution, coupled with a predictive resource allocation system that anticipates shifting task needs. The patent focuses on scheduling based on static parameters and pre-defined rules. This expands on that by allowing tasks to *morph* and resources to be proactively shifted, maximizing efficiency and responsiveness.

**Specifications:**

**1. Task Decomposition & Reformation Module:**

*   **Function:**  Responsible for breaking down initial compute tasks into smaller sub-tasks (granularity levels 1-N) and dynamically re-combining them based on real-time performance data and resource availability.
*   **Input:** Initial compute task definition, resource availability data (from Resource Monitoring Service - see below), performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rate) of sub-tasks.
*   **Output:**  Refined task definitions with adjusted granularity, instructions for Task Execution Engine (see below).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Initial Decomposition:**  Divide the initial task into N sub-tasks, based on inherent parallelism or functional modularity.
    *   **Performance Monitoring:** Track performance metrics of each sub-task.
    *   **Granularity Adjustment:**
        *   If a sub-task is resource-constrained:  Decompose it further into smaller sub-sub-tasks, distributing the load.
        *   If a sub-task is underutilized:  Combine it with neighboring sub-tasks (if logically feasible) to increase efficiency.
        *   Dynamic adjustment based on a cost function: `Cost = (Resource Consumption) + (Latency Penalty) + (Communication Overhead)`. The goal is to minimize this cost.

**2. Predictive Resource Allocation Service:**

*   **Function:**  Predicts future resource requirements based on historical task data, current workload, and machine learning models.  Proactively allocates resources *before* they are needed.
*   **Input:** Historical task performance data, current system workload, upcoming task queue, machine learning models (trained on historical data).
*   **Output:** Resource allocation requests to the Resource Management System (see below).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Data Collection:**  Gather historical task performance data (CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O operations, etc.).
    *   **Model Training:** Train machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression models) to predict future resource needs. Feature engineering will be critical, including task type, input data size, and user priority.
    *   **Resource Prediction:** Use the trained models to predict resource needs for upcoming tasks.
    *   **Proactive Allocation:**  Submit resource allocation requests to the Resource Management System. Implement a buffer to account for prediction errors.

**3. Resource Management System:**

*   **Function:** Manages the allocation and deallocation of computing resources. 
*   **Input:** Resource allocation requests from the Predictive Resource Allocation Service, current resource availability, and resource priorities.
*   **Output:**  Resource allocation confirmations or denials.
*   **Algorithm:** Utilizes a priority-based scheduling algorithm.  High-priority tasks (e.g., real-time applications) receive preferential treatment. Implement resource virtualization to enable dynamic resource allocation.

**4. Task Execution Engine:**

*   **Function:** Executes the dynamically adjusted compute tasks.
*   **Input:** Refined task definitions with adjusted granularity, allocated resources.
*   **Output:** Task execution results.
*   **Algorithm:** Parallel task execution with support for inter-task communication.  Utilize message passing or shared memory for communication.

**5. Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Function:** Monitors system performance and provides feedback to the Predictive Resource Allocation Service and Task Decomposition Module.
*   **Input:**  System performance metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, latency, throughput).
*   **Output:**  Feedback signals to refine resource allocation predictions and task decomposition strategies.



**Pseudocode (Task Decomposition Module):**

```
function decompose_task(task, current_resources):
  subtasks = split_task(task, N)  // Initial split into N subtasks
  performance_data = monitor_subtasks(subtasks)

  while true:
    for each subtask in subtasks:
      if subtask is resource_constrained:
        split_subtask(subtask)  // Decompose further
      elif subtask is underutilized and can_combine(subtask, neighbor):
        combine_subtasks(subtask, neighbor)
      end if
    end for

    updated_performance_data = monitor_subtasks(subtasks)
    if no significant change in performance_data:
      break
  end while

  return subtasks
end function
