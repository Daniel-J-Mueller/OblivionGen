## Dynamic Persona Injection for Chatbot Routing

**Concept:** Enhance the utterance routing system by dynamically injecting "persona" information into the utterance encoder. This allows the system to route based not only *what* is said, but *how* it's said, catering to varying user communication styles and intent nuances.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Database:**

*   **Structure:** A structured database (e.g., JSON, relational database) containing predefined personas. Each persona consists of:
    *   `persona_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `style_keywords`: List of keywords representing communication style (e.g., "formal", "casual", "technical", "concise", "verbose").
    *   `lexical_preferences`:  Weighted list of preferred words and phrases.  (e.g., {"'please'": 0.7, "'can you'": 0.5}).
    *   `sentiment_profile`:  Distribution of typical sentiment expressed (positive, negative, neutral).
*   **Population:** The database will be populated with a diverse set of personas representing different demographics, technical expertise, and communication preferences.  A persona creation/editing interface will also be required.

**2. Persona Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Chatbot user utterance.
*   **Process:** Utilize a pre-trained sentiment analysis and style detection model (e.g., based on transformer architecture) to analyze the utterance.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of persona IDs with associated confidence scores, representing the likelihood of the user exhibiting each persona.  The top N (e.g., N=3) personas will be retained.

**3.  Dynamic Utterance Encoding:**

*   **Input:** Original user utterance, top N persona IDs.
*   **Process:**
    1.  For each persona ID:
        *   Create a "persona embedding" by averaging the word embeddings of the `style_keywords` and sampling from the `lexical_preferences`.  This forms a context vector representing the persona.
        *   Concatenate the persona embedding with the original utterance embedding (output of the utterance encoder within the existing system).
        *   Pass the concatenated embedding through a feedforward neural network to create a "persona-infused utterance embedding".
    2.  Store the persona-infused embeddings in a list.
*   **Output:** List of persona-infused utterance embeddings, one for each retained persona.

**4.  Modified Routing Logic:**

*   **Input:** List of persona-infused utterance embeddings.
*   **Process:** The service classifier will now process *each* persona-infused embedding independently, generating a probability distribution for each service.  Instead of a single probability distribution, we now have N distributions (one per persona).
*   **Aggregation:** Combine the N probability distributions using a weighted averaging scheme. The weights can be:
    *   Confidence scores from the persona detection module.
    *   Learned weights optimized during training.
*   **Output:** Final probability distribution for service selection.

**5. Training:**

*   The entire system (persona detection, dynamic utterance encoding, modified routing) will be trained end-to-end using the mixed service set of labeled chatbot utterance training examples.
*   Loss function will include:
    *   Standard cross-entropy loss for service classification.
    *   A regularization term to encourage diversity in persona embeddings.
*   A separate validation dataset containing utterances with clearly defined personas will be used for hyperparameter tuning.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Utterance Encoding):**

```python
def encode_with_persona(utterance_embedding, persona_id, persona_db):
  persona = persona_db[persona_id]
  style_embeddings = [word_embedding(keyword) for keyword in persona['style_keywords']]
  style_embedding = np.mean(style_embeddings, axis=0)

  lexical_embeddings = []
  for phrase, weight in persona['lexical_preferences'].items():
    lexical_embeddings.append(word_embedding(phrase) * weight)
  lexical_embedding = np.mean(lexical_embeddings, axis=0)
  persona_embedding = np.concatenate([style_embedding, lexical_embedding])
  combined_embedding = np.concatenate([utterance_embedding, persona_embedding])

  infused_embedding = feedforward_nn(combined_embedding)
  return infused_embedding
```
