## Predictive Prefetch with Dynamic Page Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the predictive prefetch concept by dynamically adjusting the granularity of the prefetch – instead of prefetching entire pages, prefetch *portions* of pages based on predicted access patterns *within* the page. This reduces wasted bandwidth and resource consumption when only a small part of a page is likely to be accessed.

**Specifications:**

**1. Access Pattern Profiler:**

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Page Access Map (PAM):* A bit array representing each page, with bits indicating access frequency for each small block within the page (e.g., 64-byte blocks).
    *   *Prediction History Table (PHT):*  Stores historical access patterns for each page – sequences of accessed blocks.  Can be implemented as a Markov Chain or similar probabilistic model.
    *   *Dynamic Granularity Table (DGT):* Associates each page with its current prefetch granularity level (number of blocks to prefetch at a time).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   *Monitor Access:* Track every memory access, recording the block number within the page.
    *   *Update PAM:* Increment the corresponding bit in the PAM for the accessed block.
    *   *Build/Update PHT:* Use the PAM data to construct or update the PHT for the page.  This predicts the most likely next block to be accessed.
    *   *Granularity Adjustment:* Based on the PHT and access frequency, adjust the granularity in the DGT.
        *   High confidence in a short sequence of blocks: Reduce granularity to prefetch only those blocks.
        *   Low confidence/random access: Increase granularity to prefetch larger portions of the page.

**2. Predictive Prefetch Engine:**

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Prefetch Queue:* Stores pending prefetch requests.
    *   *Prefetch Timer:* Tracks time since last access for each page.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   *Monitor Access:*  Observe memory access requests.
    *   *Prediction:* When a memory access occurs on page X, query the Access Pattern Profiler for predicted next blocks.
    *   *Prefetch Request:* Create a prefetch request for the predicted blocks, adding it to the Prefetch Queue.
    *   *Timer-Based Prefetch:* If no access occurs for a page within a defined period, trigger a prefetch of a default granularity (based on the DGT).
    *   *Prioritization:* Prioritize prefetch requests based on confidence score from the Access Pattern Profiler, and urgency.

**3. Memory Controller Integration:**

*   **Interface:** Standard DRAM interface.
*   **Implementation:** Dedicated hardware block within the memory controller.
*   **Control Signals:**
    *   `prefetch_enable`: Enables/disables predictive prefetch.
    *   `granularity_select`: Selects prefetch granularity level.
    *   `page_access_monitor`: Monitors page access signals.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Engine):**

```
function process_memory_access(page_number, block_number):
  if prefetch_enabled:
    predicted_blocks = AccessPatternProfiler.get_predicted_blocks(page_number)
    for block in predicted_blocks:
      PrefetchQueue.add_request(page_number, block)

function timer_interrupt():
  for each page in monitored_pages:
    if time_since_last_access(page) > threshold:
      prefetch(page, default_granularity)

function prefetch(page_number, granularity):
    // Issue prefetch command to DRAM
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the threshold for timer-based prefetch based on page access patterns.
*   **Multi-Level Prefetch:** Use multiple levels of prefetch granularity – coarse, medium, fine – and dynamically switch between them.
*   **Correlation Analysis:** Identify correlations between access patterns on different pages and prefetch accordingly.
*   **AI-Driven Prediction:** Replace the PHT with a more sophisticated AI model trained on historical access data.
