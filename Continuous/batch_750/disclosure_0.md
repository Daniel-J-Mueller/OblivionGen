## Personalized Voice-Triggered Environmental Control Profiles

**Concept:** Extend account association beyond simple content access to encompass granular control of 'smart' environmental settings (lighting, temperature, audio zones, appliance states) within a physical space, personalized *per account* and triggered by voice, even during overlapping device usage.

**Specification:**

**1. Profile Creation & Linking:**

*   **Data Storage:** Each associated account (primary & guest) maintains a ‘Environment Profile’ containing key-value pairs defining desired settings. Example: `{"Living Room Lights": "Dimmed, Warm White", "Thermostat": "22C", "Audio Zone": "Jazz", "Coffee Maker": "Off"}`.  This data is stored securely and accessible via API.
*   **Learning Phase:** Upon initial account association, a ‘Learning Phase’ is initiated.  During this phase, the system passively observes user interactions with environmental controls (physical or digital) while the primary user is actively using the voice interface. This data informs the initial Environment Profile.
*   **Manual Override:**  Users can manually edit their Environment Profile through a dedicated interface (app, web portal).

**2. Voice Trigger & Account Identification:**

*   **Concurrent Voice Analysis:** The system *continuously* analyzes incoming audio streams, identifying potential voice commands *and* speaker identity. This goes beyond simple "who is speaking" – it needs to differentiate between intentional commands and background speech.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Speaker ID is combined with other factors:
    *   **Proximity Detection:**  Bluetooth or WiFi triangulation to estimate speaker location within the physical space.
    *   **Device Association:**  If the speaker is interacting with a paired device (phone, smart watch), this adds another layer of confidence.
*   **Ambiguity Resolution:** If speaker identity is uncertain, the system prompts for clarification ("Which account should I apply this to?").

**3. Environmental Control Execution:**

*   **Profile Application:** Once speaker identity is confirmed, the system retrieves the corresponding Environment Profile.
*   **Device Command Translation:**  The system translates the profile settings into device-specific commands (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi).
*   **Overriding & Layering:**  If a device is *already* in a different state, the system implements a configurable ‘override’ or ‘layering’ strategy:
    *   **Absolute Override:**  The profile setting takes precedence, immediately changing the device state.
    *   **Additive Adjustment:** The profile setting is applied as an adjustment to the current state (e.g., “Increase brightness by 20%”).
    *   **Conditional Override:** The profile setting is applied *only if* the current state does not meet certain criteria (e.g., “Turn on the coffee maker *if* it’s currently off”).
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  The system can integrate with other sensors (motion detectors, occupancy sensors) to refine environmental control. For example, it might only apply a profile if someone is actually present in the room.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
function processVoiceCommand(audioStream):
    speakerID = identifySpeaker(audioStream)
    if speakerID == UNKNOWN:
        promptForAccountClarification()
        return

    environmentProfile = getEnvironmentProfile(speakerID)
    if environmentProfile == null:
        environmentProfile = createDefaultProfile()

    for setting, value in environmentProfile:
        deviceID = findDeviceForSetting(setting)
        if deviceID != null:
            sendCommandToDevice(deviceID, value)
```

**Novelty:**

Current systems primarily focus on content access and simple voice commands. This concept extends account association to granular environmental control, allowing for personalized experiences even when multiple users are present. The layering and contextual awareness features create a more dynamic and responsive environment. The aim is to transform the entire physical space into an extension of the user's digital identity.
