## Dynamic Result Synthesis with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple aggregation of results from disparate interfaces. Introduce a system that *predicts* future result set needs based on partial results and prefetches data accordingly, synthesizing a unified result set before the user explicitly requests it. This shifts from a reactive to a proactive data delivery model.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Component: Predictive Synthesis Engine (PSE)**

*   **Input:** Raw results from multiple programmatic interfaces (as per original patent), partial result sets, user request context (e.g., search terms, filters).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Dependency Mapping:**  Automatically analyzes result structures to identify relationships between data returned by different interfaces. (e.g., Interface A returns customer IDs, Interface B returns order details – a clear dependency).
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Employs a machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) trained on historical request/result data. This model predicts *which* additional data from other interfaces is likely needed *before* the full request completes.  Model inputs: partial results, request context, interface response times.
    *   **Prefetching:** Initiates asynchronous requests to interfaces identified by the predictive model. Requests prioritize interfaces with higher latency.
    *   **Synthesis:** As prefetched data arrives, the PSE synthesizes a unified result set. The synthesis process is interface-agnostic and based on a configurable mapping layer.
    *   **Caching:** Aggressively caches synthesized result sets. Cache keys incorporate request context *and* synthesized data to maximize hit rate.
*   **Output:**  A unified, synthesized result set, ready for delivery.

**2. Token Enhancement:  Synthesis State Token (SST)**

*   Existing token from original patent (pagination/failure states) is *embedded* within the SST.
*   **New Fields:**
    *   `synthesis_complete`: Boolean – indicates if the synthesis process is finished.
    *   `estimated_completion_time`: Integer – approximate time remaining for synthesis (seconds).
    *   `prefetch_status`: Array – status of each prefetched interface (pending, in-progress, success, failure).
    *   `synthesis_version`: Integer – version number of the synthesized result set. Allows for incremental updates.

**3.  Request Flow:**

1.  User submits request.
2.  System receives request and initial results start streaming from interfaces.
3.  PSE analyzes initial results and predicts future needs.
4.  Asynchronous prefetch requests are initiated.
5.  PSE begins synthesizing results.
6.  Initial partial results are returned to the user *along with* the SST.
7.  User client can optionally poll for SST updates.
8.  As synthesis progresses, the SST is updated and sent to the client.
9.  Once `synthesis_complete` is true, the client receives the complete synthesized result set.

**Pseudocode (PSE - core processing loop):**

```pseudocode
function processResults(initialResults, requestContext, existingSST):
  // 1. Dependency Mapping & Prediction
  dependencies = mapDependencies(initialResults)
  predictedInterfaces = predictNeededInterfaces(dependencies, requestContext)

  // 2. Prefetching
  prefetchRequests = createPrefetchRequests(predictedInterfaces)
  startPrefetching(prefetchRequests)

  // 3. Synthesis
  synthesizedResults = synthesize(initialResults, prefetchedResults)

  // 4. SST Generation
  sst = generateSST(synthesizedResults, prefetchedResults)

  // 5. Return Results & SST
  return synthesizedResults, sst
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond simply *aggregating* existing results to *proactively constructing* a unified result set *before* the user explicitly requests it.  The SST provides a richer state representation, allowing for more intelligent client-side handling and potentially even partial rendering of results.  This prioritizes user experience by minimizing perceived latency.
