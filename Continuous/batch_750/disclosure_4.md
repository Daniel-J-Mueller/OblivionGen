## Predictive Resource Allocation via Simulated Job Execution

**Specification:** A system for dynamically allocating computational resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) to data access jobs *before* job submission, based on simulated execution profiles and predictive modeling.

**Core Innovation:**  Instead of reacting to job arrival and scheduling based on historical data *after* arrival, this system *proactively* forecasts resource needs and reserves resources *before* the job is submitted. This anticipates contention and optimizes overall system throughput.

**System Components:**

1.  **Execution Profile Generator:**  Analyzes historical data access job characteristics (data size, operation type, access patterns) to create a library of execution profiles. This is significantly more granular than simply tracking duration. Profiles include CPU usage curves, memory allocation patterns, I/O request rates, and network bandwidth utilization over time.

2.  **Simulated Execution Engine:**  A virtualized environment capable of executing simulated versions of data access jobs. These simulations do *not* access real data, but use representative datasets and models of data access behavior. The engine utilizes the execution profiles to drive the simulation.

3.  **Predictive Modeling Module:**  Employs machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, neural networks) to predict resource requirements for new data access jobs *before* submission.  Input features include job metadata (user, priority, data type), estimated data size, and a preliminary description of the requested operations.  The model leverages the simulation results from similar jobs to refine its predictions.

4.  **Resource Reservation Manager:**  Based on the predicted resource requirements, this module reserves the necessary computational resources from a shared pool. It utilizes a dynamic allocation algorithm that considers both the requested resources and the current system load.  A ‘soft reservation’ system is implemented - resources are guaranteed for a limited time window, and released if the job is not submitted within that window.

5.  **Real-Time Monitoring & Adjustment:** Continuously monitors actual resource usage of running jobs and compares it to the predicted usage.  If a discrepancy is detected, the system can dynamically adjust resource allocations, either by shifting resources from lower-priority jobs or by initiating resource scaling (e.g., adding more virtual machines).




**Pseudocode (Resource Reservation Manager):**

```
function reserve_resources(job_request):
  predicted_resources = predictive_modeling_module.predict_resources(job_request)
  
  if system_resources.are_available(predicted_resources):
    reservation_id = system_resources.reserve(predicted_resources)
    job_request.reservation_id = reservation_id
    return reservation_id
  else:
    #Attempt to negotiate resource allocation
    negotiated_resources = resource_negotiator.negotiate(predicted_resources)
    if negotiated_resources:
      reservation_id = system_resources.reserve(negotiated_resources)
      job_request.reservation_id = reservation_id
      return reservation_id
    else:
      return NULL //Resource reservation failed
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Execution Profile:** { job_type, data_size, operation_types, cpu_usage_curve, memory_allocation_pattern, io_request_rate, network_bandwidth_utilization }
*   **Resource Request:** { cpu_cores, memory_gb, disk_io_ops, network_bandwidth_mbps }
*   **Resource Allocation:** { allocation_id, allocated_cpu_cores, allocated_memory_gb, allocated_disk_io_ops, allocated_network_bandwidth_mbps }

**Novelty:** Proactive resource allocation based on *simulated* job execution, significantly improving resource utilization and reducing job contention compared to reactive scheduling algorithms. This moves beyond simply predicting execution duration and delves into predicting *resource profiles* over time.
