## Adaptive Hierarchy Visualization & Contextual Expansion

**Concept:** A dynamic visualization layer atop the hierarchical classification system, coupled with AI-driven contextual expansion of search results. This goes beyond simply displaying the hierarchy; it *actively reshapes* it based on user interaction and inferred intent, and proactively suggests related information *before* the user even asks.

**Specs:**

*   **Visualization Engine:**  A node-link diagram rendering of the classification hierarchy. Nodes represent classifications, links represent parent-child relationships.  Nodes dynamically resize and reposition based on search frequency and relevance to the current query.  Color-coding based on classification 'temperature' (see Algorithm below).
*   **'Temperature' Algorithm:** Each classification is assigned a 'temperature' score.
    *   Base Temperature: Initial value based on overall popularity/frequency of use.
    *   Query Boost:  Increased proportionally to the number of times a classification (or its descendants) appears in search results.  Decays over time (configurable decay rate).
    *   Contextual Heat: AI-driven score based on relationships to *other* frequently searched terms.  Uses a knowledge graph constructed from search logs, item descriptions, and potentially external sources. (This is the key differentiating factor).
*   **Interactive Expansion/Collapse:** Standard node expansion/collapse functionality, but with 'smart collapse'.  Instead of simply collapsing a node, the system identifies *representative* items or sub-classifications within that node and displays them as 'highlights' – a preview of what's hidden.
*   **Proactive Contextual Suggestions:**  Based on the current node and user search history, the system displays a 'contextual panel' with:
    *   Related Classifications:  Suggestions of classifications that are frequently co-searched with the current one.
    *   ‘Missing Link’ Suggestions:  Identifies potentially relevant classifications that the user *hasn’t* searched for, but that are strongly related based on the knowledge graph.  (e.g. User searches for ‘running shoes’, system suggests ‘marathon training plans’).
    *   'Adjacent Concepts': Based on item descriptions and relationships, surfaces conceptual terms users have not previously thought of in relation to their search.
*   **AI-Driven Hierarchy Adjustment:**  Over time, the system dynamically adjusts the hierarchy itself.
    *   Node Promotion: Frequently co-searched sub-classifications may be promoted to become top-level classifications.
    *   Node Re-Parenting:  Classifications that are consistently searched for in conjunction with a different parent classification may be re-parented.
    *   Automated Tagging: Based on item descriptions, and user search histories, the system generates new classifications automatically.

**Pseudocode (Hierarchy Adjustment):**

```
function adjustHierarchy(searchLogs, itemDescriptions):
    knowledgeGraph = buildKnowledgeGraph(searchLogs, itemDescriptions)

    for each classification in hierarchy:
        coOccurrenceCount = calculateCoOccurrenceCount(classification, knowledgeGraph)
        potentialParent = findBestParent(classification, coOccurrenceCount, hierarchy)

        if potentialParent != currentParent:
            reParent(classification, potentialParent)

        if numDescendants(classification) > threshold:
            promoteDescendant(classification, mostFrequentDescendant())
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server infrastructure to handle knowledge graph construction and real-time analysis.
*   Scalable database to store search logs, item descriptions, and the knowledge graph.
*   JavaScript/HTML5/CSS for the interactive visualization layer.
*   AI/ML framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for knowledge graph construction and recommendation algorithms.
