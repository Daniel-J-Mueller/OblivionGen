## Modular, Self-Healing Power Distribution Network with Predictive Load Balancing

**System Overview:**

This design envisions a power distribution network built upon interconnected, intelligent modules – “Power Nodes” – capable of dynamically re-routing power and predicting load demands. It moves beyond a simple ‘feed’ for maintenance to a truly resilient and adaptable system, going beyond the Y-cable concept to encompass entire data center power infrastructure.

**Power Node Specifications:**

*   **Physical Dimensions:** 1U rack-mountable enclosure. Scalable modular design allows for stacking/expansion.
*   **Input:** Accepts standard 208V/120V/240V AC input (configurable). Multiple input feeds for redundancy.
*   **Output:** Multiple independently controlled, metered AC output circuits (e.g., 16 x C13/C19 outlets).  DC output options available.
*   **Internal Components:**
    *   High-efficiency power supplies (95%+)
    *   Solid-state transfer switches (SSTs) – allows for sub-millisecond switching between input feeds/outputs.
    *   Microcontroller (ARM Cortex-A series) with real-time operating system (RTOS).
    *   Non-volatile memory (for configuration, historical data, and AI models).
    *   Gigabit Ethernet port (for network connectivity).
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, vibration).
    *   Current sensors on each output circuit.
    *   Optional: Wireless communication module (for fallback/monitoring).
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Proprietary protocol over Ethernet, leveraging a publish-subscribe model.  Each node publishes its status (load, temperature, faults) and subscribes to network-wide alerts and commands.
*   **Power Capacity:** Modular, expandable. Individual nodes rated for 5-10kW.  Scalable to support entire data center power requirements.

**Network Architecture:**

*   **Hierarchical Topology:** Nodes are organized in a hierarchical tree structure. “Root” nodes connect to utility power. “Leaf” nodes connect to individual servers/equipment. Intermediate nodes act as aggregators and re-routers.
*   **Mesh Connectivity:**  Within each level of the hierarchy, nodes are interconnected via redundant Ethernet links, creating a mesh network.  This provides multiple paths for communication and power re-routing.
*   **Distributed Intelligence:** Each node runs a local AI model trained to predict load demands and optimize power distribution.

**AI Model – Predictive Load Balancing:**

*   **Data Inputs:** Historical load data, environmental sensors, application-level workload information (if available), time of day, day of week.
*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTM is well-suited for time-series data and capturing long-term dependencies.
*   **Training Data:** Collected from all nodes in the network.  Centralized training with federated learning techniques to preserve data privacy.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Load Prediction:** Predicts future power demands for each output circuit.
    *   **Optimal Power Allocation:**  Distributes power across available inputs to minimize losses and maximize efficiency.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies unusual power consumption patterns that may indicate a failing component or security breach.
    *   **Self-Healing:** In case of a node failure, automatically reroutes power through alternative paths.

**Software Components:**

*   **NodeOS:** Real-time operating system for embedded nodes.
*   **Network Manager:**  Centralized software platform for monitoring and managing the entire power distribution network.
*   **AI Training Pipeline:** Automated pipeline for collecting data, training AI models, and deploying them to nodes.
*   **API:** REST API for integration with existing data center management systems.

**Pseudocode – Node Self-Healing:**

```
// Node Status: PowerIn[ ], PowerOut[ ], HealthStatus

function handleNodeFailure(failedNode):
    //Identify affected outputs & inputs of the failed node
    affectedOutputs = failedNode.PowerOut
    affectedInputs = failedNode.PowerIn

    //Find alternative paths to affected outputs
    alternativePaths = findPaths(affectedOutputs, failedNode)

    //Re-route power through alternative paths
    for each path in alternativePaths:
        reroutePower(path)

    //Log event & alert administrators
    logEvent("Node failure detected & power rerouted")
    sendAlert("Node failure - " + failedNode.ID)

function findPaths(outputs, failedNode):
    //Perform Breadth-First Search to find all paths from inputs to outputs, excluding failed node
    paths = []
    queue = [failedNode.Inputs]
    visited = [failedNode]

    while queue:
        current_node = queue.pop(0)

        for neighbor in neighbors(current_node):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.append(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)

                if isOutput(neighbor) and outputs.contains(neighbor):
                    paths.add(get_path(neighbor))

    return paths
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   Modular design allows for phased deployment. Start with a small section of the data center and gradually expand.
*   Existing power infrastructure can be integrated with the new system.
*   Remote monitoring and management capabilities enable proactive maintenance and troubleshooting.
