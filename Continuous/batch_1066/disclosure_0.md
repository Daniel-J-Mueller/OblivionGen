## Dynamic DNS Reputation Scoring & Adaptive Blocking

**Concept:** Extend the firewall rule system to incorporate a dynamic reputation score for domains resolved via DNS, and adaptively block/allow requests based on this score, independent of explicitly defined rules. This goes beyond simple allow/block lists by introducing probabilistic filtering based on observed behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Data Source:**

*   **Data Collection:** Implement a system to passively collect data on DNS resolution behavior across all VPCs utilizing the service.  Track:
    *   Resolution frequency.
    *   Time to first byte (TTFB) for resolved domains (indicates server responsiveness/health).
    *   Geographic location of resolving and resolved servers.
    *   Any detected malicious activity associated with the resolved IP address (using threat intelligence feeds â€“ AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal, etc.).  Integrate with existing security services.
    *   Frequency of DNS resolution failures for the domain.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** Develop a scoring algorithm that combines these factors into a single reputation score (0-100, higher is better). Weightings should be configurable and adaptable based on observed performance. A decaying average should be used to account for changing behavior over time.
*   **Data Storage:** Store reputation scores in a scalable, low-latency data store (e.g., Redis, Cassandra).

**2. Adaptive Blocking Engine:**

*   **Threshold Configuration:** Allow administrators to define thresholds for the reputation score. These thresholds determine whether a DNS request is allowed, blocked, or subject to further scrutiny.
    *   **Allow Threshold:**  Requests above this threshold are always allowed.
    *   **Block Threshold:** Requests below this threshold are always blocked.
    *   **Scrutiny Range:** Requests within this range trigger further checks (see below).
*   **Scrutiny Checks:**  For requests within the scrutiny range:
    *   **Real-time Threat Analysis:**  Perform real-time analysis of the resolved IP address using external threat intelligence feeds.
    *   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Compare the DNS resolution pattern to known malicious patterns (e.g., fast flux DNS).
    *   **Heuristic Checks:**  Apply heuristic checks based on domain age, registration information, and content type.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  The adaptive blocking engine should continuously learn from observed behavior and adjust the thresholds and weighting factors of the scoring algorithm. Machine learning models (e.g., anomaly detection, decision trees) can be used for this purpose.

**3. System Architecture**

*   **Reputation Service:** A dedicated microservice responsible for collecting reputation data, calculating scores, and providing access to the data.
*   **Adaptive Blocking Module:** Integrated into the existing DNS resolution service. Intercepts DNS requests, consults the Reputation Service, and applies the appropriate blocking/allowing logic.
*   **API Integration:** Provide an API for administrators to view reputation scores, configure thresholds, and override blocking decisions.
*   **Event Logging:** Log all blocking decisions and relevant reputation data for auditing and analysis.

**4. Pseudocode:**

```
function resolveDNS(dnsRequest, vpc) {
  // 1. Check if vpc is associated with static firewall rules
  if (isBlockedByStaticRules(dnsRequest, vpc)) {
    return blockResponse();
  }

  // 2. Get reputation score from Reputation Service
  reputationScore = getReputationScore(dnsRequest.domain);

  // 3. Apply adaptive blocking logic
  if (reputationScore < blockThreshold) {
    return blockResponse();
  } else if (reputationScore > allowThreshold) {
    resolvedIP = resolveWithStandardDNS(dnsRequest);
    return successResponse(resolvedIP);
  } else { // Within scrutiny range
    if (isMalicious(dnsRequest.domain)) {
      return blockResponse();
    } else {
      resolvedIP = resolveWithStandardDNS(dnsRequest);
      return successResponse(resolvedIP);
    }
  }
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static firewall rules to create a dynamic, adaptive security layer that can proactively block malicious domains before they are explicitly identified. It reduces reliance on threat intelligence feeds and improves overall security posture.
