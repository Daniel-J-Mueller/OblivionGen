## Automated Anomaly Detection via Virtual Machine Divergence

**Concept:** Extend the repeatable computation framework to proactively identify hardware or software anomalies *before* they manifest as failures. This is achieved by running multiple, identical virtual machines performing the same repeatable computation, then monitoring divergence in their terminal states.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Control Module:** A central component responsible for orchestrating the anomaly detection process.
*   **VM Manager:** Manages the creation, deployment, and monitoring of virtual machines. Utilizes existing virtualization infrastructure.
*   **Computation Library:** Stores a catalog of repeatable computations, categorized by anomaly sensitivity (see section III).
*   **Divergence Analyzer:** Compares terminal states of VMs, identifies deviations, and generates anomaly reports.
*   **Reporting Module:**  Presents anomaly reports to system administrators.

**II. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Computation Selection:** The Control Module selects a repeatable computation from the Computation Library based on target hardware/software components and desired anomaly sensitivity.
2.  **VM Deployment:** The VM Manager launches *N* identical virtual machines (configurable parameter), each running the selected computation.
3.  **Computation Execution:** Each VM executes the repeatable computation.
4.  **State Capture:** Upon completion, each VMâ€™s terminal state is captured (memory image, relevant log files, performance metrics).
5.  **Divergence Analysis:** The Divergence Analyzer compares the captured terminal states.  A baseline deviation threshold is established based on inherent computational noise. Any state exceeding this threshold is flagged.
6.  **Anomaly Reporting:** The Reporting Module generates a detailed report including:
    *   Identified deviating VMs
    *   Specific differences in terminal states (memory addresses, register values, log entries)
    *   Severity level based on the magnitude of the deviation
    *   Potential root cause analysis hints

**III. Computation Library Categorization:**

Computations are categorized by "Anomaly Sensitivity."  Examples:

*   **High Sensitivity:**  Memory stress tests, floating-point precision tests, cryptographic algorithm execution.  Designed to quickly expose hardware errors or subtle software bugs.
*   **Medium Sensitivity:**  Standard benchmark tests, complex image/video processing, database queries.  Detects performance degradation or functional errors.
*   **Low Sensitivity:**  Simple text processing, basic arithmetic operations.  Provides a baseline for identifying more severe anomalies.

**IV.  Divergence Analysis Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function analyze_divergence(terminal_states[]) {
  baseline_deviation = calculate_baseline_deviation(terminal_states)
  anomalies = []

  for each state in terminal_states {
    deviation = calculate_deviation(state, average_state(terminal_states))
    if (deviation > baseline_deviation * sensitivity_multiplier) { //sensitivity_multiplier is a tunable parameter.
      anomaly = {
        vm_id: state.vm_id,
        deviation_score: deviation,
        details: find_specific_differences(state, average_state(terminal_states))
      }
      anomalies.append(anomaly)
    }
  }
  return anomalies
}

function find_specific_differences(state1, state2){
  //Iterate through memory regions, registers, log files.
  //Identify first significant divergence, recording memory address, value.
  //Return difference details.
}
```

**V. Scalability and Adaptability:**

*   **Distributed Execution:** The VM Manager can distribute VM deployment and computation execution across multiple physical servers.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  The baseline deviation threshold can be dynamically adjusted based on observed system behavior.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:**  The anomaly detection system can be integrated with machine learning models to predict potential failures before they occur.
*   **Hardware Agnostic:** Designed to work with any virtualized environment.
