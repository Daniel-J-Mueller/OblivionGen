## Dynamic Authorization Granularity via Hash Chains

**Concept:** Expand the hash-based lookup system to enable incredibly fine-grained access control. Instead of a single hash representing a portion of PII, create *chains* of hashes, where each hash in the chain represents a progressively smaller subset of the original data. Access is granted/denied based on possession of the *entire* chain, effectively creating multi-factor authentication based on data subsets.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Segmentation:** Upon ingestion of PII, segment the data into overlapping, variable-length chunks. Example: "John Smith" -> "John", "John S", "John Sm", "Smith", "Smit", "mith", etc.  The chunk size is dynamically determined based on data type and sensitivity (e.g., social security numbers get smaller chunks).

2.  **Hash Chain Generation:**  For each chunk, generate a cryptographic hash. Link these hashes together sequentially to form a “hash chain” representing the entire PII. The chain is stored alongside the associated data.  The chain *is* the key to the data, not a traditional password.

3.  **Policy Definition:** Define access policies based on *required hash chain segments*. For example:
    *   "Marketing team can access data requiring the first 3 hashes of the chain." (basic identifying info)
    *   "Fraud detection needs hashes 4-7." (address, partial financial details)
    *   "Full customer service requires the entire chain."

4.  **Access Request Flow:**
    *   Client requests data associated with an identifier.
    *   System provides a challenge: "Provide hash segments 4-7 to unlock access."
    *   Client computes these hashes based on their known portion of the PII (which they may have legitimately obtained) or accesses precomputed values they've been authorized to possess.
    *   System verifies the provided hashes against the stored chain.

5.  **Dynamic Chain Regeneration:** Periodically (or upon detection of a compromise), regenerate the hash chain using a rotating key.  This invalidates any cached or compromised hash segments.

6. **Client-Side Hash Generation:** Clients receive limited portions of the original PII along with a 'seed' key. Clients use the seed to generate the required hash segments *without* ever possessing the original PII, increasing security. The seed changes periodically.

**Pseudocode (Access Request Flow):**

```
function verifyAccess(identifier, requiredHashSegments):
  // 1. Retrieve the full hash chain from storage
  hashChain = getDataStore().getHashChain(identifier)

  // 2. Check if the requested segments are within the chain bounds
  if (requiredHashSegments exceeds chain length) :
    return ACCESS_DENIED

  // 3. Extract the requested hash segments from the hashChain
  extractedSegments = hashChain.getSubChain(startIndex, segmentCount)

  // 4. Verify the extracted segments against the client provided segments
  if (clientProvidedSegments matches extractedSegments):
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
  else:
    return ACCESS_DENIED
```

**Data Store Considerations:**

*   Store the full hash chain as a single record associated with the identifier.
*   Implement efficient sub-chain extraction functionality.
*   Support secure key rotation for hash chain regeneration.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Extremely granular access control.
*   Reduced risk of data breaches.
*   Enhanced compliance with privacy regulations.
*   Eliminates the need to store passwords or other authentication credentials.
*   More dynamic authorization.
