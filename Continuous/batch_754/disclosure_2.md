## Adaptive Permission Granularity via Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Augment the existing digital signature verification with a dynamic permission system based on user behavioral biometrics. Instead of solely relying on a static secret access key, analyze *how* a user interacts with the system to determine an appropriate permission level *at the time of request*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Biometric Data Collection Module:**
    *   Collect data points during user interaction: keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure), mouse movements (speed, patterns, hesitation), scrolling behavior, touch gestures (if applicable), and potentially even subtle voice analysis during any voice-based authentication.
    *   Data is collected passively during normal system use, not as a separate authentication step.
    *   Data is anonymized and encrypted locally on the user's device/session before transmission.

2.  **Behavioral Profile Creation & Maintenance:**
    *   Each user (or requester) will have a dynamic behavioral profile stored server-side.  This profile is not a static snapshot but a continuously updated model (e.g., using a Hidden Markov Model or recurrent neural network) reflecting their typical interaction patterns.
    *   The model learns from deviations *from* the user's baseline.  Large deviations indicate potential compromise.
    *   The profile should be segmented. Track different "contexts" (e.g. time of day, type of application accessed) as behavior will vary.

3.  **Real-Time Permission Adjustment:**
    *   When a request is received (and the initial digital signature verifies the requester's identity), the system performs a real-time behavioral analysis.
    *   Compare the current interaction pattern to the user's established profile for that context.
    *   Calculate a “Behavioral Confidence Score” (BCS) reflecting how closely the current interaction matches the expected pattern.
    *   Map the BCS to a permission level.  For example:
        *   BCS > 90%: Grant full requested permissions.
        *   80% < BCS < 90%: Grant reduced permissions (e.g., read-only access, limited data scope).
        *   BCS < 80%: Deny request or require additional authentication (MFA).
    *   This permission level is applied *in addition* to the existing, static permissions.

4.  **Request/Response Protocol Modification:**
    *   The existing request protocol will be extended to include the BCS as a parameter.
    *   The server will log the BCS along with the request for auditing and anomaly detection.
    *   A "permission grant level" parameter is added to the response indicating what permissions were ultimately granted.

5.  **Anomaly Detection & Adaptive Learning:**
    *   A separate anomaly detection module monitors BCS values for all users.
    *   Significant deviations from the norm trigger alerts and potentially initiate account lockout or MFA challenges.
    *   The system continuously learns from new data to refine the behavioral models and improve accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function verifyRequest(request):
  // Initial signature verification (as in existing patent)
  if !verifySignature(request):
    return false

  userId = request.userId
  behaviorData = request.behaviorData // Keystroke timings, mouse movements, etc.

  behavioralConfidenceScore = calculateBehavioralConfidence(userId, behaviorData)

  permissionLevel = mapBCS to PermissionLevel(behavioralConfidenceScore)

  //Apply permission level to the request before granting access

  //Log request, BCS, and granted permission level

  return true
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security by detecting compromised accounts or malicious actors even if they have valid credentials.
*   Adaptive access control based on real-time user behavior.
*   Reduced reliance on static permissions and complex access control lists.
*   Improved user experience by minimizing friction for legitimate users.
