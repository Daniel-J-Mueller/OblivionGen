## Adaptive Regional Histogram Equalization with Perceptual Weighting

**Concept:** Expand upon regional histogram equalization by dynamically adjusting the equalization parameters *not* solely based on statistical distribution, but also based on perceptual importance within the image. The system will identify regions of high visual attention (using a simplified saliency map) and apply more aggressive equalization to those areas, while preserving detail in less important regions. This aims to enhance perceived image quality, particularly in scenes with high dynamic range or low contrast.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Image Input:** Standard digital image (e.g., JPEG, PNG, TIFF) with RGB or grayscale channels.

2.  **Regional Segmentation:**
    *   Divide the image into non-overlapping rectangular regions (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64 pixels).  Region size is a configurable parameter.
    *   Optionally implement a superpixel algorithm (e.g., SLIC) for more visually coherent regions.

3.  **Saliency Map Generation:**
    *   Implement a simplified saliency map algorithm based on color, intensity, and orientation differences. This doesn't need to be state-of-the-art, a fast approximation is sufficient.  Specifically:
        *   Calculate the color difference between each pixel and its neighbors (using a Gaussian filter).
        *   Calculate the intensity difference between each pixel and its neighbors.
        *   Combine these differences to create a saliency map.  Normalize to the 0-1 range.

4.  **Histogram Analysis per Region:**
    *   For each region, calculate the histogram of luma values.  The number of bins in the histogram is a configurable parameter (e.g., 256 bins).

5.  **Equalization Parameter Adjustment:**
    *   Calculate the average saliency value for each region.
    *   Define a weighting factor `w` between 0 and 1.  This controls the influence of saliency on equalization.
    *   Calculate the equalization strength `s` for each region as follows:
        `s = base_strength + w * (saliency - min_saliency) / (max_saliency - min_saliency)`
        Where:
            *   `base_strength` is a default equalization strength.
            *   `saliency` is the average saliency for the region.
            *   `min_saliency` and `max_saliency` are the minimum and maximum saliency values across all regions.

6.  **Adaptive Histogram Equalization:**
    *   Apply histogram equalization to each region using the calculated equalization strength.  A contrast limiting algorithm (e.g., clipping the histogram at a specified percentile) is recommended to prevent excessive contrast enhancement.

7.  **Seamless Tiling:**
    *   Implement a seamless tiling algorithm to minimize artifacts at the boundaries between regions. This can be achieved by overlapping adjacent regions and blending the results using a Gaussian filter.

8. **Output:** Processed image with enhanced contrast and detail, especially in visually important regions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function AdaptiveRegionalHistogramEqualization(image, region_size, base_strength, w):
  regions = DivideImageIntoRegions(image, region_size)
  saliency_map = GenerateSaliencyMap(image)

  for region in regions:
    saliency = CalculateAverageSaliency(saliency_map, region)
    equalization_strength = base_strength + w * (saliency - min_saliency) / (max_saliency - min_saliency)
    histogram = CalculateHistogram(region)
    equalized_histogram = ApplyHistogramEqualization(histogram, equalization_strength)
    equalized_region = ApplyEqualizedHistogramToRegion(region, equalized_histogram)
    AddEqualizedRegionToOutputImage(equalized_region)

  ApplySeamlessTiling(output_image)
  return output_image
```

**Configurable Parameters:**

*   `region_size`: The size of the rectangular regions.
*   `base_strength`: The default equalization strength.
*   `w`: The weighting factor for saliency.
*   Histogram bin count
*   Contrast limiting percentile.
