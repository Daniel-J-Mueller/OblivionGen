## Adaptive Hash Table Segmentation with Dynamic Prefix Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the hash table approach by dynamically adjusting segment sizes and allocation strategies based on observed destination address prefixes and traffic patterns. This allows for greater efficiency and scalability, particularly in environments with highly variable or skewed prefix distributions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prefix Monitoring Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitors incoming packet destination address prefixes.
*   **Data Structures:**  A prefix tree (Trie) to track prefix occurrences and associated traffic volume (packet count, byte count). The Trie nodes store statistics.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   On packet arrival, extract destination prefix.
    *   Traverse Trie, incrementing counters at each node along the prefix path.
    *   Periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds), analyze the Trie to identify:
        *   **High-Volume Prefixes:** Prefixes with significantly higher traffic than average.
        *   **Emerging Prefixes:**  Prefixes experiencing rapid growth in traffic.
        *   **Declining Prefixes:** Prefixes with decreasing traffic.

**2. Dynamic Segmentation Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Adjusts the size and allocation of hash table segments based on Prefix Monitoring output.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Hash Table Segment Metadata:  An array or list storing information about each segment (segment ID, size, starting address, associated prefixes).
    *   Segment Allocation Map: A data structure (e.g. bit array) indicating which segments are in use and their occupancy level.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **High-Volume Prefix Handling:**
        *   If a prefix’s traffic exceeds a threshold, attempt to allocate a dedicated segment (or a larger segment) to store entries related to that prefix.
        *   If no dedicated segment is available, consider splitting an existing segment to accommodate the prefix.
    *   **Emerging Prefix Handling:**  Proactively increase segment size or allocate new segments for prefixes showing rapid growth.
    *   **Declining Prefix Handling:**  Reduce the size of segments associated with declining prefixes, or reclaim those segments for other uses.
    *   **Segment Splitting/Merging:** Implement algorithms for splitting existing segments into smaller segments and merging smaller segments into larger segments without disrupting ongoing forwarding operations.
    *   **Fragmentation Management:** Prevent excessive fragmentation of the hash table by implementing mechanisms for consolidating small, unused segments.

**3. Adaptive Hashing Function:**

*   **Function:**  Dynamically adjusts the hashing function based on prefix characteristics.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Analyze prefix length and bit patterns.
    *   Select a hashing function optimized for the observed prefix characteristics. (e.g. shorter prefixes may benefit from simpler hashing functions, while longer prefixes require more complex ones).
    *   Employ multiple hashing functions and switch between them based on prefix characteristics or load balancing considerations.

**4. Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Implement the Dynamic Segmentation Engine and Adaptive Hashing Function in hardware (e.g., using FPGA or ASIC) for maximum performance.
*   Provide a software API for configuring and monitoring the dynamic segmentation process.
*   Support incremental updates to the hash table segments to minimize disruption during reconfiguration.
*   Enable logging and monitoring of segment allocation, hashing function selection, and performance metrics.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Segmentation Engine – core logic):**

```
function adjust_segmentation(prefix_stats):
  for prefix, stats in prefix_stats:
    if stats.traffic > HIGH_VOLUME_THRESHOLD:
      segment = find_available_segment(stats.prefix_length)
      if segment == null:
        segment = split_segment(existing_segment) // split segment to create space
        if segment == null:
          continue // unable to create space

      allocate_segment(segment, prefix)

    elif stats.traffic < LOW_VOLUME_THRESHOLD:
      reclaim_segment(segment)
```
