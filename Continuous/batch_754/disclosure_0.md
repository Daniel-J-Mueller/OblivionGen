## Dynamic Precision Beam Search

**Concept:** Implement a beam search algorithm where the numerical precision used for scoring beam candidates *dynamically adjusts* based on the magnitude of the scores. This allows for focusing computational resources on differentiating between closely-scored candidates while reducing precision for widely disparate scores.

**Rationale:** Current beam search implementations typically use fixed-precision floating-point numbers (e.g., FP32, FP16) for all scoring calculations. When the beam search progresses and the difference between the best and worst candidates becomes significant, much of the precision is wasted â€“ the least significant bits contribute negligible value. Conversely, when scores are very close, insufficient precision can lead to inaccurate ranking. Dynamic precision aims to mitigate these issues.

**Specification:**

**1. Scoring Architecture:**

*   Implement a hierarchical scoring system. This system is composed of multiple "Precision Layers". Each layer uses a different numerical precision (e.g., FP64, FP32, FP16, INT8).
*   The initial scoring calculation (first iteration) is performed using the highest precision (FP64).
*   Subsequent scoring calculations are performed using a precision level determined by the *score range* of the current beam.

**2. Score Range Determination:**

*   Calculate the range of scores within the current beam (maximum score - minimum score).
*   Define a set of score range thresholds, each corresponding to a specific precision level.  Example:
    *   Range < 1e-6: FP64
    *   1e-6 <= Range < 1e-3: FP32
    *   Range >= 1e-3: FP16

**3. Precision Switching Logic:**

*   After each iteration of the beam search, the score range is calculated.
*   Based on the score range and the pre-defined thresholds, the precision level for the *next* iteration is determined.
*   A hardware/software switch (or dynamic data type casting) is used to perform the subsequent scoring calculations using the selected precision.

**4. Hardware Implementation Notes:**

*   Utilize the existing ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units) in the data processor. Implement the precision switching via control signals that configure the ALUs to operate in different precision modes.
*   If the ALUs lack native support for all required precision levels, consider implementing a software emulation layer for the less supported levels.
*   The instruction set should be augmented with instructions to:
    *   Set the current precision level.
    *   Cast data between different precision levels.

**5. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
precision_level = FP64
beam = initialize_beam()

// Beam Search Loop
while not done:
  // Calculate scores using current precision level
  scores = calculate_scores(beam, precision_level)

  // Calculate score range
  score_range = max(scores) - min(scores)

  // Determine next precision level
  if score_range < threshold_1:
    precision_level = FP64
  elif score_range < threshold_2:
    precision_level = FP32
  else:
    precision_level = FP16

  // Select top M candidates
  next_beam = select_top_m(beam, scores, M)

  // Update beam for next iteration
  beam = next_beam
end while
```

**6. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced computational cost:** Using lower precision for less critical scoring calculations reduces the number of operations and memory bandwidth requirements.
*   **Improved accuracy:** Utilizing higher precision when scores are close improves the accuracy of ranking.
*   **Energy efficiency:**  Lower precision calculations consume less energy.
