## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Profiling for Enhanced Disambiguation

**Concept:** Expand the hypothesis comparison beyond command results to include *acoustic scene* profiling. The system dynamically builds a probabilistic model of the acoustic environment during speech capture and utilizes this model to weight hypotheses, improving disambiguation beyond semantic understanding.

**Specifications:**

**1. Acoustic Scene Data Acquisition & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Microphone Array Integration:** Utilize a multi-microphone array (minimum 4 microphones) integrated into the speech capture device.
*   **Real-time Feature Extraction:** During audio capture, extract acoustic features beyond standard speech parameters. These include:
    *   Reverberation Time (RT60)
    *   Ambient Noise Level (dB SPL) across frequency bands (e.g., 250Hz-8kHz)
    *   Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation for dominant sound sources.
    *   Spectral centroid, bandwidth, and rolloff.
*   **Data Buffering:** Buffer a rolling window (e.g., 5 seconds) of extracted acoustic features.

**2. Acoustic Scene Modeling:**

*   **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Training:** Employ a GMM to model the distribution of extracted acoustic features for various acoustic scenes (e.g., "home office", "car interior", "busy street", "quiet room").
    *   Training data should consist of recordings from diverse environments, labeled with their respective acoustic scenes.
    *   The GMM parameters (means, covariances, weights) should be dynamically updated over time using an online learning algorithm (e.g., Expectation-Maximization with a forgetting factor).
*   **Scene Probability Estimation:** For each incoming utterance, estimate the probability of belonging to each trained acoustic scene based on the current acoustic feature vector using the trained GMMs.
*   **Scene Context Vector:** Create a "Scene Context Vector" representing the probability distribution over acoustic scenes.

**3. Hypothesis Weighting & Disambiguation:**

*   **Hypothesis Acoustic Scene Compatibility:** For each N-best hypothesis, estimate its compatibility with each acoustic scene using a pre-trained model. This model could be a neural network trained on labeled data of utterances spoken in different acoustic scenes.
*   **Weighted Hypothesis Scoring:** Combine the semantic score of each hypothesis (derived from NLU) with its acoustic scene compatibility scores. The weighted score is calculated as follows:

    `Weighted_Score(Hypothesis) = Semantic_Score(Hypothesis) + Σ [Compatibility(Hypothesis, Scene) * P(Scene)]`

    Where:
    *   `Semantic_Score` is the score from the NLU module.
    *   `Compatibility(Hypothesis, Scene)` is the compatibility score between the hypothesis and the acoustic scene.
    *   `P(Scene)` is the probability of the acoustic scene.

*   **Disambiguation:** Select the hypothesis with the highest weighted score.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Module:** Responsible for acoustic feature extraction, scene modeling, and scene probability estimation.
*   **Speech Recognition Module:** Standard ASR pipeline generating N-best hypotheses.
*   **NLU Module:** Performs semantic understanding of hypotheses.
*   **Disambiguation Module:** Combines semantic and acoustic information to select the most likely hypothesis.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Device:

function extractAcousticFeatures(audioData):
  // Extract RT60, noise levels, DOA, spectral features
  return acousticFeatureVector

function updateSceneModel(acousticFeatureVector):
  // Online GMM update

function estimateSceneProbabilities(acousticFeatureVector):
  // Calculate P(Scene) for each scene

// On Server:
function calculateHypothesisCompatibility(hypothesis, scene):
  // Use pre-trained model to calculate compatibility score

function disambiguateHypotheses(NBestList, AcousticFeatures):
  For Each hypothesis in NBestList:
    For Each scene:
      Compatibility = calculateHypothesisCompatibility(hypothesis, scene)
    WeightedScore = SemanticScore(hypothesis) + Σ (Compatibility * P(scene))
  Return hypothesis with max WeightedScore
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved disambiguation accuracy in noisy or reverberant environments.
*   Enhanced robustness to variations in speech styles and accents.
*   More natural and intuitive user experience.
