## Temporal Attention Modulation for State Space Models

**Concept:** Integrate a temporal attention mechanism *within* the state transition formulation of the state space sub-models, allowing the model to dynamically weight past states based on their relevance to the current time step *and* the output of the recurrent neural network. This extends beyond simply learning state transition matrices – it's about *modulating* those transitions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **State Transition Formulation Modification:**  Replace the standard linear state transition `x_t = A * x_{t-1} + w_t` with an attention-weighted transition:

    `x_t = Σ [α_{t,i} * A_i * x_{t-i}] + w_t`

    Where:

    *   `x_t` is the state vector at time `t`.
    *   `A_i` is the i-th learned state transition matrix.  We maintain *multiple* transition matrices –  `i` ranges from 1 to `N` (a hyperparameter).
    *   `α_{t,i}` is the attention weight for the i-th transition matrix at time `t`. These weights are *learned* and dynamically adjusted.
    *   `w_t` is the innovation term (noise).

2.  **Attention Weight Generation:** The attention weights `α_{t,i}` are generated by a small feedforward neural network, parameterized by `Θ`.  This network takes as input:

    *   The output `h_t` of the recurrent neural network at time `t`.
    *   The previous state vector `x_{t-1}`.
    *   A learnable embedding representing the index `i` of the transition matrix.  This embedding allows the network to differentiate between the transition matrices.

    `α_{t,i} = softmax(FFN_Θ(h_t, x_{t-1}, Embedding(i)))`

    The softmax ensures that the attention weights sum to 1 for each time step.

3.  **Training Procedure:**

    *   Standard backpropagation is used to train all parameters, including the recurrent neural network, the state transition matrices `A_i`, the attention network `FFN_Θ`, and the embeddings.
    *   Loss function remains as described in the patent: based on probabilistic output of the state space model and observed values.
    *   Regularization (e.g., L1 or L2) is applied to the attention weights to prevent overfitting and encourage sparsity (i.e., focusing on a limited number of past states).

4.  **Implementation Details:**

    *   The number of learned state transition matrices `N` is a hyperparameter.  Higher values increase model capacity but also complexity.
    *   The dimensionality of the embeddings should be a hyperparameter.
    *   The feedforward network `FFN_Θ` should be relatively shallow (e.g., 2-3 layers) to avoid introducing excessive complexity.

5.  **Pseudocode Snippet (State Update):**

```python
def state_update(h_t, x_t_minus_1, A_matrices, embedding_matrix, FFN_Θ):
    """
    Calculates the state update using attention-weighted transition matrices.

    Args:
        h_t: Output of the recurrent neural network at time t.
        x_t_minus_1: State vector at time t-1.
        A_matrices: List of learned state transition matrices.
        embedding_matrix: Learnable embedding matrix for transition matrix indices.
        FFN_Θ: Feedforward network for generating attention weights.

    Returns:
        x_t: State vector at time t.
    """

    N = len(A_matrices)  # Number of transition matrices
    attention_weights = []
    for i in range(N):
        embedding = embedding_matrix[i]
        weight = FFN_Θ(h_t, x_t_minus_1, embedding)
        attention_weights.append(weight)

    attention_weights = softmax(attention_weights)  # Normalize weights

    x_t = np.zeros_like(x_t_minus_1)
    for i in range(N):
        x_t += attention_weights[i] * A_matrices[i] @ x_t_minus_1

    return x_t
```

This system allows the model to learn *which* past states are most relevant to the current prediction, effectively adding a dynamic memory component to the state space model.  The recurrent neural network provides context, while the attention mechanism focuses on the most important historical information.
