**Adaptive Acoustic Zoning Doorbell**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple motion/button activation to create a doorbell system that uses directional microphones and localized audio responses to enhance privacy and usability.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Six (6) directional microphones arranged in a circular pattern on the doorbell unit, capable of beamforming and sound source localization.
*   **Speaker Array:** Four (4) small, directional speakers embedded within the doorbell unit.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated digital signal processor (DSP) with machine learning (ML) capabilities.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2
*   **Power:** Existing doorbell wiring (16-24VAC) with battery backup.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping:**  The system creates a dynamic acoustic map of the area immediately surrounding the doorbell. This map identifies and tracks sound sources (voices, footsteps, vehicles) and differentiates them from background noise.
    *   **Zoning:** The acoustic map is divided into zones. The number of zones and their size are adjustable by the user.
    *   **Selective Audio Routing:** When a sound source (e.g., a voice) is detected within a specific zone, the system dynamically routes the audio to the corresponding directional speaker(s).  This creates the illusion that the sound is originating from the zone itself.
    *   **Privacy Mode:** A user-defined 'privacy zone' can be created around the property.  Any audio detected *within* this zone is suppressed from being transmitted externally (e.g., to a smartphone app).
    *   **Adaptive Volume Control:** Automatically adjusts the volume of the chime/audio output based on ambient noise levels.
    *   **Voice Isolation:** ML algorithm to isolate and enhance human voices detected near the doorbell, even in noisy environments.

**Operation:**

1.  A person approaches the door and speaks.
2.  The microphone array captures the audio and the DSP analyzes it.
3.  The DSP determines the direction of the sound source.
4.  Based on the sound sourceâ€™s direction, the DSP directs the audio to the corresponding speaker, creating the effect that the person is speaking *from* that direction.
5.  If the sound source is detected within the privacy zone, the audio is not transmitted.
6.  The system transmits a notification to the user's smartphone app, including audio.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  audioData = readAudioFromMicrophoneArray();
  sourceLocation = localizeSoundSource(audioData);

  if (sourceLocation.withinPrivacyZone()) {
    suppressAudioTransmission();
  } else {
    routeAudioToSpeaker(sourceLocation);
    sendNotificationToApp(audioData);
  }
  delay(10ms);
}

// Function: localizeSoundSource(audioData)
// Returns: Source location (coordinates)
// Implementation: Beamforming, triangulation, ML-based sound source localization

// Function: routeAudioToSpeaker(location)
// Sends audio to the speaker closest to the sound source

// Function: suppressAudioTransmission()
// Disables audio transmission to the app and external speakers
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced privacy: Reduces the risk of eavesdropping by focusing audio output only to the intended recipient.
*   Improved usability: Makes it easier to hear the doorbell in noisy environments.
*   Increased security: Can be used to deter unwanted visitors by creating the illusion that someone is home.
*   Customizable experience: Allows users to define their own privacy zones and audio preferences.
