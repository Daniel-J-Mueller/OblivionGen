## Dynamic Service Mesh Integration for Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the token bucket rate limiting system to dynamically integrate with a service mesh, enabling predictive load balancing based on real-time service health and capacity *before* overload conditions occur. Instead of *reacting* to token depletion, proactively shift traffic.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** *Predictive Load Balancer (PLB)* – A sidecar component integrated within the service mesh alongside existing proxies (e.g., Envoy, Istio).
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Token Bucket Status: PLB receives near real-time status updates from the token bucket system (number of tokens available, token refresh rate).
    *   Service Health Metrics: PLB collects health metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, response times, error rates) from monitored services via the service mesh’s observability pipeline (Prometheus, Jaeger, etc.).
    *   Request Characteristics: PLB examines incoming request metadata (e.g., user ID, geographic location, request type) to identify patterns and potential for prioritization or redirection.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Capacity Prediction:** PLB uses a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained on historical token bucket status and service health data to predict future capacity (token availability) and health.
    2.  **Traffic Shaping:** Based on the capacity prediction and current service health, PLB dynamically adjusts traffic routing rules within the service mesh.
        *   **Proactive Shifting:** If the model predicts impending token depletion (overload), PLB *proactively* shifts traffic to healthy service instances with available capacity *before* the overload occurs.  This could involve routing a percentage of new requests to a different instance or even temporarily diverting requests to a backup service.
        *   **Request Prioritization:**  PLB assigns priority scores to incoming requests based on factors like user ID (VIP users), request type (critical transactions), or geographic location.  Higher-priority requests are preferentially routed to healthy instances.
        *   **Adaptive Routing Weights:** The PLB dynamically adjusts routing weights within the service mesh control plane, ensuring traffic is distributed optimally based on predicted capacity and health.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Token Bucket Mapping:** PLB requires a mapping between service instances and the associated token buckets.
    *   **Routing Policies:**  Administrators define routing policies specifying how traffic should be shifted based on predicted capacity and health. These policies can be customized per service or even per request type.
    *   **Thresholds:** Configure thresholds for triggering traffic shifting and prioritization based on token availability and service health metrics.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// PLB Component - main loop

while (true) {
  // 1. Fetch data
  tokenStatus = getTokenBucketStatus()
  serviceHealth = getServiceHealthMetrics()

  // 2. Predict future capacity
  predictedCapacity = predictCapacity(tokenStatus, serviceHealth)

  // 3. Calculate routing weights
  routingWeights = calculateRoutingWeights(predictedCapacity, serviceHealth)

  // 4. Update service mesh control plane
  updateServiceMesh(routingWeights)

  // 5. Wait for next iteration
  sleep(100ms)
}

//Helper Function for predictive capacity
function predictCapacity(tokenStatus, serviceHealth){
  //Use time series data to generate a capacity prediction
  //Train model with historical token status and service health data
  //Return predicted capacity
}

//Helper Function for determining routing weights
function calculateRoutingWeights(predictedCapacity, serviceHealth){
  //Determine optimal routing weights based on predicted capacity and service health.
  //Prioritize healthy instances with available capacity.
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing token bucket systems are primarily *reactive*, dropping traffic after overload.  This system introduces a *proactive* element by predicting overload conditions and dynamically adjusting traffic routing within the service mesh *before* they occur.  Integrating with a service mesh allows for fine-grained traffic control and prioritization, improving application resilience and user experience.
