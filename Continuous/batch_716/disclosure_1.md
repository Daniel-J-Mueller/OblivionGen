## Dynamic Bokeh & Selective Depth Mapping

**Concept:** Extend selective blurring beyond simple geometric regions (bounding boxes) to create realistically modeled bokeh and depth-of-field effects directly within the camera pipeline. Leverage computational photography principles to estimate scene depth and simulate optical characteristics of real-world lenses.

**Specs:**

*   **Depth Estimation Module:**
    *   Utilize a multi-frame super-resolution depth estimation algorithm. Capture a short burst of images (e.g., 3-5 frames) with slight sensor shifts.
    *   Employ a learned neural radiance field (NeRF) or similar volumetric representation to reconstruct a sparse depth map of the scene.
    *   Integrate sensor data (IMU, autofocus) to refine depth estimation and compensate for camera motion.
*   **Bokeh Engine:**
    *   Model lens aberrations (spherical, chromatic) to realistically distort out-of-focus light.
    *   Implement a physically-based rendering (PBR) pipeline to simulate light transport and bokeh shape.
    *   Parameterize bokeh characteristics (shape, size, color) based on lens type (e.g., circular, pentagonal), aperture, and focal length.
*   **Selective Depth Mapping:**
    *   Allow the application to specify a 'focus plane' and 'depth of field' range.
    *   Map scene depth to a normalized depth value (0.0 â€“ 1.0).
    *   Calculate a 'blur factor' based on the distance from the focus plane and the depth of field range.
    *   Apply a spatially varying blur filter based on the blur factor.
*   **Real-time Processing Pipeline:**
    *   Optimize the entire pipeline for real-time performance on mobile and embedded devices.
    *   Leverage GPU acceleration and parallel processing techniques.
    *   Implement a streaming architecture to minimize latency.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processFrame(rawImageData, applicationParameters):
    depthMap = estimateDepth(rawImageData)
    focusPlane = applicationParameters.focusPlane
    depthOfField = applicationParameters.depthOfField
    bokehShape = applicationParameters.bokehShape // circular, pentagonal, etc.

    for each pixel in rawImageData:
        pixelDepth = depthMap[pixel.x, pixel.y]
        distanceFromFocusPlane = abs(pixelDepth - focusPlane)
        blurFactor = max(0.0, 1.0 - distanceFromFocusPlane / depthOfField)

        blurredPixel = applyBlur(pixel, blurFactor, bokehShape) // custom blur filter

        outputPixel = blurredPixel
    return outputPixel
```

**Innovation Details:**

The core idea is to move beyond simple box or geometric blurring towards a more physically accurate simulation of depth-of-field effects. This will involve real-time depth estimation, modeling of lens aberrations, and a custom blur filter that incorporates bokeh characteristics. The application can control parameters like focus plane, depth of field, and bokeh shape to achieve a desired artistic effect. This extends the original patent's selective blurring significantly, offering a much richer and more realistic visual experience. It adds a degree of computational photography that is a departure from simple blurring.
