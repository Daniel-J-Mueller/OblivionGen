## Adaptive Predictive Item Grouping & ‘Serendipity Boost’

**Specification:** A system to dynamically group items based on inferred user intent *beyond* immediate search strings, and proactively present these groups with a calculated ‘serendipity boost’ factor, influencing ranking and presentation.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent tracks associations between search strings and *individual* items. This expands that to identify patterns linking search strings to *groups* of items, even if those items aren’t directly selected after the search. It introduces a 'Serendipity Boost' to deliberately surface potentially interesting, but less strongly associated, items to encourage exploration.

**Components:**

1.  **Intent Inference Engine:**
    *   Input: User event history (searches, selections, dwell time, scrolling, cursor movements, additions to carts, wishlists, shares).
    *   Process: Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model user behavior over time. The LSTM predicts the *next likely action* (e.g., selecting an item, refining the search, abandoning the session) based on the event history. This provides a probability distribution over potential user intents.
    *   Output: A vector representing the inferred user intent, capturing the likelihood of various underlying needs or goals.

2.  **Dynamic Grouping Module:**
    *   Input: User intent vector, item metadata (categories, tags, descriptions, images).
    *   Process: Employs a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, hierarchical clustering) to group items based on their similarity in metadata *and* their alignment with the inferred user intent.  Items strongly associated with multiple inferred intents are given higher weight. Groups are formed dynamically and change in real-time as user behavior evolves.
    *   Output: A set of dynamically created item groups, each representing a cluster of items likely to be relevant to the user’s current inferred intent.

3.  **Serendipity Boost Calculator:**
    *   Input: Association weight between search string & individual items within the group (from the existing patent), overall group relevance score (based on alignment with inferred intent), historical user exploration data (items clicked after viewing a group).
    *   Process: 
        1. Calculate a base ranking score for each item within the group based on existing association strength.
        2. Adjust the ranking score by a 'Serendipity Factor' (SF). The SF is a value between 0 and 1 and is calculated as follows:
            *   `SF = 1 - (AssociationWeight / MaxAssociationWeight)`. This means items with low association weight (potentially novel suggestions) receive a higher SF.
            *  A 'Exploration Rate' parameter controls how aggressively the system boosts serendipitous suggestions. 
        3. Incorporate a 'Diversity Penalty' to prevent the system from repeatedly suggesting similar items.
    *   Output: A refined ranking score for each item within the group, considering both association strength and potential for discovery.

4.  **Presentation Layer:**
    *   Input: Refined item rankings, group structure.
    *   Process: Dynamically displays item groups to the user, prioritizing groups and items with the highest refined scores. Visual cues (e.g., badges, highlighted suggestions) are used to indicate items with high ‘Serendipity Boost’ factors. User interface dynamically adjusts to accommodate different group sizes and layouts.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each User Event History Sequence:
InferUserIntent(eventHistory) -> userIntentVector

// For each Item in Repository:
CalculateItemSimilarity(itemMetadata, userIntentVector) -> similarityScore

// Dynamic Grouping:
ClusterItems(items, similarityScore) -> itemGroups

// Serendipity Boost Calculation:
For each item in itemGroups:
    associationWeight = GetAssociationWeight(searchString, item) // From existing patent
    serendipityFactor = 1 - (associationWeight / maxAssociationWeight)
    refinedScore = associationWeight * (1 - explorationRate) + refinedScore * explorationRate
    refinedScore = refinedScore - diversityPenalty(item, items) //Reduce redundancy

//Present itemGroups to User
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   E-commerce product recommendations
*   Content discovery platforms
*   Search engine result diversification
*   Personalized learning paths
