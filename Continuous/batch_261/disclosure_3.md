## Adaptive Cache Coherency with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the cache survivability concept by adding a predictive prefetching layer coupled with adaptive cache coherency based on observed access patterns *across* multiple database nodes. Current systems focus on surviving failures *within* a node. This shifts the focus to maintaining cache coherency and anticipating data needs *between* nodes, even during transient network disruptions or node reboots.

**Specifications:**

**1. Distributed Cache Map (DCM):**

*   Each node maintains a DCM, a hash table storing metadata about cached data pages residing on *other* nodes.
*   Key: Data Page ID.
*   Value: {Node ID, Last Access Timestamp, Access Frequency, Prediction Confidence}.
*   DCM entries are periodically updated via a lightweight gossip protocol.

**2. Access Pattern Monitoring & Prediction:**

*   Each node monitors access patterns to cached data pages, identifying sequential, random, and cyclical access patterns.
*   A local prediction engine (e.g., a Markov model or recurrent neural network) estimates the probability of accessing specific data pages based on recent history.
*   Prediction confidence is associated with each prediction.

**3. Predictive Prefetching:**

*   When a node predicts a high-probability access to a data page not present in its local cache:
    *   It checks the DCM to identify the node hosting that page.
    *   Initiates a prefetch request *before* the actual access occurs.
    *   Prefetch requests include a ‘priority’ flag based on prediction confidence.
    *   Nodes prioritize serving prefetch requests over regular requests.

**4. Adaptive Cache Coherency:**

*   Upon receiving a prefetch request, a node verifies the data page’s consistency.
*   If the page has been modified since the requesting node’s last access:
    *   It sends an updated version.
    *   If the requesting node has a stale copy, invalidates it (via a lightweight messaging protocol).
*   If the page is consistent, it sends a confirmation signal, allowing the requesting node to anticipate the data.

**5. Failure Handling & Recovery:**

*   If a node fails:
    *   Other nodes detect the failure through heartbeat messages.
    *   The failed node’s DCM entries are propagated to other nodes.
    *   Nodes serving requests for data previously hosted by the failed node automatically redirect requests to replicas (assuming a replicated database).
    *   Prefetch requests previously directed to the failed node are automatically retried to the replica.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Request Handling):**

```
function handle_prefetch_request(request):
    page_id = request.page_id
    if page_is_cached(page_id):
        if page_is_consistent(page_id, request.timestamp):
            send_confirmation(request.source)
        else:
            send_updated_page(request.source, page_id)
            invalidate_stale_copy(request.source, page_id)
    else:
        // Page not cached - potentially fetch from disk/storage layer
        // (Implementation detail - outside scope)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires high-bandwidth, low-latency network interconnects between database nodes.
*   Implementation can be layered on top of existing database caching mechanisms.
*   Prediction engine can be implemented using machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Gossip protocol needs to be optimized for scalability and resilience.
*   Consider using RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) for efficient data transfer.
