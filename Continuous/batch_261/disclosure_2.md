## Dynamic Glyph Stitching for Animated Fonts

**Concept:** Extend the composite glyph approach by introducing time-dependent representative component references. Instead of static glyph assembly, create a system where glyphs *morph* by smoothly transitioning between different representative components over time. This enables the creation of animated fonts and glyphs directly within the file format, eliminating the need for external animation tools or video codecs.

**Specs:**

*   **File Format Extension:** Add a "Temporal Component List" (TCL) to the glyph file format. The TCL contains, for each composite glyph:
    *   A list of "Keyframes".
    *   Each Keyframe includes:
        *   A timestamp (e.g., in milliseconds).
        *   A list of "Component Weights". Each weight corresponds to a representative component and indicates its contribution to the composite glyph at that timestamp. Weights must sum to 1.0.
*   **Representative Component Library:** Maintain a library of representative components, stored as vector graphics or parametric curves.
*   **Glyph Rendering Engine:** Modify the rendering engine to:
    1.  Load the TCL for a given glyph.
    2.  Determine the current timestamp (e.g., based on animation playback time).
    3.  Interpolate the Component Weights based on the timestamps in the TCL. Linear or spline interpolation is acceptable.
    4.  Reconstruct the composite glyph by blending the representative components according to the interpolated weights. This blending should preserve smooth transitions and avoid visual artifacts.
*   **Component Weighting Algorithm:** Utilize a weighted sum blending algorithm. Each vertex of the representative components is multiplied by its corresponding weight before summation. This maintains vector properties during blending.
*   **Animation Metadata:** Include metadata within the file to specify animation duration, loop settings, and other animation parameters.

**Pseudocode (Rendering Engine):**

```
function RenderAnimatedGlyph(glyphID, currentTime):
    TCL = LoadTemporalComponentList(glyphID)
    
    // Find the keyframes immediately before and after the current time
    prevKeyframe = FindPreviousKeyframe(TCL, currentTime)
    nextKeyframe = FindNextKeyframe(TCL, currentTime)
    
    // Calculate interpolation factor (0.0 to 1.0)
    interpolationFactor = (currentTime - prevKeyframe.timestamp) / (nextKeyframe.timestamp - prevKeyframe.timestamp)
    
    // Interpolate component weights
    interpolatedWeights = []
    for i in range(len(prevKeyframe.componentWeights)):
        weight = prevKeyframe.componentWeights[i] + (nextKeyframe.componentWeights[i] - prevKeyframe.componentWeights[i]) * interpolationFactor
        interpolatedWeights.append(weight)
    
    // Load representative components
    representativeComponents = LoadRepresentativeComponents(representativeComponentIDs)
    
    // Reconstruct composite glyph
    compositeGlyph = CreateEmptyGlyph()
    for i in range(len(representativeComponents)):
        component = representativeComponents[i]
        weight = interpolatedWeights[i]
        // Apply weight to component vertices
        weightedVertices = ApplyWeightToVertices(component.vertices, weight)
        // Add weighted vertices to composite glyph
        compositeGlyph.AddVertices(weightedVertices)
    
    return compositeGlyph
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Morphing Paths:** Allow representative components to connect via predefined morphing paths, enabling more complex animations.
*   **Dynamic Component Loading:** Implement a system for loading representative components on demand, reducing file size.
*   **User-Defined Animations:** Provide tools for creating and editing animations directly within the glyph file format.
*   **AI Assisted Animation**:  A neural network could learn a mapping from font style to appropriate animation.
