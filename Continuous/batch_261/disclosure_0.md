## Secure Dependency Scanning & Automated Remediation Workflow

**Specification:** A system for proactively identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities within project dependencies *before* they are committed to version control, integrated with the existing IDE guard application.

**Core Concept:** Shift left even further – not just blocking pushes with policy violations, but actively scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities and offering automated remediation options directly within the IDE.

**Components:**

1.  **Dependency Scanner Service:** A background service (can be cloud-hosted or local) responsible for maintaining a database of known vulnerabilities across various package ecosystems (npm, pip, maven, etc.).  This service periodically updates its vulnerability database.
2.  **IDE Extension:** An extension integrated into the IDE. This extension communicates with the Dependency Scanner Service and the IDE guard application.
3.  **Automated Remediation Engine:** A component within the Dependency Scanner Service capable of identifying and suggesting (or automatically applying) patches or alternative versions of dependencies to resolve identified vulnerabilities.
4.  **Policy Integration:** The existing project development environment policy service is extended to include rules governing dependency security levels (e.g., “Block dependencies with critical vulnerabilities”).

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Scan:** When a developer opens a project, the IDE extension triggers an initial scan of the project's dependencies against the Dependency Scanner Service.
2.  **Real-time Monitoring:** The IDE extension continuously monitors dependency changes (e.g., during `npm install`, `pip install`) and triggers incremental scans.
3.  **Vulnerability Reporting:** Identified vulnerabilities are displayed directly within the IDE – similar to linting errors – with severity levels and remediation suggestions.
4.  **Remediation Options:**
    *   **Automated Patching:**  If a patch is available, the IDE extension offers a one-click "Apply Patch" option.
    *   **Version Upgrade:**  The IDE suggests upgrading to a version of the dependency that resolves the vulnerability.
    *   **Alternative Dependency:** If no patch or upgrade is available, the IDE suggests alternative dependencies that provide similar functionality without the vulnerability.
5.  **Policy Enforcement:**
    *   If a dependency violates the configured policy (e.g., contains a critical vulnerability), the IDE guard application blocks the commit or push, even if the developer attempts to bypass the remediation suggestions.
    *   Policy can be configured at the project level, allowing different security requirements for different projects.
6.  **Reporting & Analytics:** The Dependency Scanner Service generates reports on vulnerability trends, identified risks, and remediation efforts.

**Pseudocode (IDE Extension - Dependency Scan Trigger):**

```
function onProjectOpen(projectPath) {
  scanDependencies(projectPath);
}

function onDependencyInstall(projectPath) {
  scanDependencies(projectPath);
}

function scanDependencies(projectPath) {
  dependencyList = getDependencyList(projectPath); // Function to parse package.json, requirements.txt, etc.
  vulnerabilityReport = callDependencyScannerService(dependencyList); // API call to cloud service
  displayVulnerabilitiesInIDE(vulnerabilityReport);
}
```

**Pseudocode (Dependency Scanner Service - API Endpoint):**

```
API Endpoint: /scanDependencies

Input: List of dependencies (name, version)

Output: List of vulnerabilities (dependency name, vulnerability ID, severity, remediation suggestions)

Process:
  1. For each dependency in the input list:
    2. Query vulnerability database for vulnerabilities associated with the dependency and version.
    3. If vulnerabilities found:
      4.  Generate a vulnerability report entry with details and remediation suggestions.
  5. Return the list of vulnerability reports.
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Proactive Dependency Scanning:**  Shifting security checks to happen *during* development, not just before commits.
*   **Automated Remediation Integration:** Providing developers with actionable solutions directly within their IDE.
*   **Policy-Driven Dependency Security:**  Enforcing consistent security standards across projects.
*   **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuous scanning of dependencies ensures that vulnerabilities are identified as soon as they are introduced.
