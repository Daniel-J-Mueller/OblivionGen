## Dynamic Risk Surface Mapping & Predictive Drift Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the existing security monitoring system with a continuously updating "Risk Surface Map" representing the collective risk posture of documents and user activities, coupled with “Predictive Drift Analysis” to anticipate emerging threat patterns.

**Specification:**

**I. Risk Surface Map Generation:**

1.  **Data Sources:** Integrate data from the core patent system (topic modeling, risk scores, user activity) *plus* external threat intelligence feeds (CVE databases, dark web monitoring, industry-specific threat reports).
2.  **Risk Feature Engineering:** Beyond document risk scores, derive additional features:
    *   *Document Provenance:* Track document creation, modification history, access paths.
    *   *Social Network Analysis:* Map user relationships (communication patterns, shared document access) to identify potential insider threats or compromised accounts.
    *   *Geospatial Risk:* Correlate document access locations with known threat actors or high-risk regions.
3.  **Map Representation:** Implement a graph database to model the Risk Surface Map. 
    *   Nodes: Documents, Users, Topics, External Threat Indicators.
    *   Edges: Relationships between nodes (e.g., “User accessed Document”, “Document contains Topic”, “Topic associated with Threat Indicator”).
4.  **Dynamic Weighting:** Employ a reinforcement learning model to dynamically adjust the weights of different risk features based on observed security events. (e.g., if a document accessed from a specific location frequently leads to incidents, the geospatial risk weight increases).

**II. Predictive Drift Analysis:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** Establish a “normal” activity profile for each user and document based on historical data (using the existing RNN).
2.  **Concept Drift Detection:** Implement a statistical change detection algorithm (e.g., Drift Detection Method – DDM, Early Drift Detection Method – EDDM) to monitor for deviations from the established baseline. This goes beyond simply flagging activity as “anomalous” – it actively looks for *changes* in anomalous patterns.
3.  **Pattern Propagation:**  When concept drift is detected:
    *   Propagate the change through the Risk Surface Map. If a user's access patterns shift, update the risk scores of the documents they access and the topics those documents cover.
    *   Trigger a cascade analysis to identify potentially affected systems or users.
4.  **Predictive Modeling:** Use a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to *predict* future drift patterns based on observed trends. This enables proactive security measures.

**III. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Component: Risk Surface Manager
class RiskSurfaceManager:
    def __init__(self, data_sources, rl_model):
        self.data_sources = data_sources
        self.rl_model = rl_model
        self.graph_db = GraphDatabase()

    def update_risk_surface(self):
        data = self.data_sources.get_all_data()
        self.graph_db.populate(data)
        self.rl_model.train(self.graph_db)

// Component: Drift Analyzer
class DriftAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, baseline_model, drift_detection_algorithm):
        self.baseline_model = baseline_model
        self.drift_detection_algorithm = drift_detection_algorithm

    def analyze_activity(self, user_activity, document):
        prediction = self.baseline_model.predict(user_activity)
        drift_detected = self.drift_detection_algorithm.detect(prediction, user_activity)

        if drift_detected:
            //Propagate drift through Risk Surface Manager
            risk_surface_manager.update_risk_surface()
```

**IV. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Explainable AI (XAI):**  Provide mechanisms to explain why a particular activity is flagged as risky.  This increases trust and reduces false positives.
*   **Active Learning:**  Allow security analysts to provide feedback on the accuracy of the system.  This improves the performance of the models over time.
*   **Federated Learning:**  Enable secure collaboration between organizations by allowing them to share models without sharing sensitive data.
