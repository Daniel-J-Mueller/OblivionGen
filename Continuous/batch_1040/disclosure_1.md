## Adaptive Resolution Preview Tiles

**Concept:** Extend the level-order traversal preview concept by incorporating adaptive resolution tiles within the preview file. Instead of simply increasing granularity (more images) as the file transfers, *increase the fidelity* of the images themselves.

**Specs:**

1.  **Tile Structure:** Divide each content image into a grid of tiles (e.g., 4x4, 8x8). Each tile has associated metadata indicating its current resolution level. Initial resolution level is very low (e.g., 16x16 pixels).

2.  **Traversal & Prioritization:** Maintain the level-order traversal for preview arrangement.  However, within each image, prioritize tile loading based on a ‘visual importance’ metric. This could be determined by:
    *   **Edge Density:** Tiles with high edge density (lots of detail) are prioritized.
    *   **Color Variance:** Tiles with high color variance (complex textures) are prioritized.
    *   **Saliency Maps:** Integrate a pre-computed saliency map for each frame to prioritize tiles containing visually salient regions.

3.  **Progressive Refinement:** As the preview file transfers, progressively refine tiles in order of priority.  Each tile refinement step involves:
    *   Fetching the tile at a higher resolution.
    *   Replacing the lower-resolution tile in the preview display.

4.  **Data Structure:** Store tiles in a nested data structure. Top level is the level-order arrangement. Second level is the tile grid for each image. Third level is the resolution level for each tile.

5.  **Client-Side Rendering:** Client device has a rendering engine to assemble the preview from received tiles. It manages tile loading, resolution updates, and display.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Rendering):**

```
function renderPreview(previewFile):
  previewArrangement = decodeLevelOrderArrangement(previewFile)
  for imageIndex in previewArrangement:
    image = decodeImage(previewFile, imageIndex)
    tileGrid = image.getTileGrid()

    for tileX in range(tileGrid.width):
      for tileY in range(tileGrid.height):
        tile = tileGrid.getTile(tileX, tileY)
        if tile.resolutionLevel < MAX_RESOLUTION:
          requestHigherResolutionTile(tile) // Asynchronous request
          tile.resolutionLevel = MAX_RESOLUTION
          redrawTile(tile)
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Faster Initial Display:** A low-resolution preview is available very quickly.
*   **Perceptual Improvement:** Prioritizing important tiles enhances perceived quality faster than uniformly increasing resolution.
*   **Bandwidth Optimization:**  Avoids sending high-resolution data for areas that aren’t visually significant.
*   **Scalability:** Adaptable to various video resolutions and network conditions.
