## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction with Predictive Annotation

**Concept:** Extend the video analysis beyond 2D object tracking and prioritization to create a rudimentary 3D scene reconstruction *concurrently* with video playback. This allows for “look around” functionality *within* the summarized video, not just a sequence of prioritized 2D clips. It predicts future object positions based on tracked movement to smooth transitions and handle occlusion.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Standard video stream + annotation data (objects, positions, classifications) – identical to the base patent.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `SceneGraph`: A dynamic graph representing the reconstructed scene. Nodes are objects (identified by annotation), edges represent spatial relationships (distance, relative position).
    *   `ObjectState`: Data structure for each object:
        *   `position_history`: Array of 3D positions over time.
        *   `velocity`: 3D velocity vector.
        *   `predicted_position`:  Estimated 3D position at future time ‘t’.
        *   `confidence`:  Value indicating certainty of predicted position.
*   **Core Algorithm – Scene Reconstruction & Prediction:**
    1.  **Initialization:**  For the first frame, create initial `SceneGraph` nodes based on detected objects. Assign 3D positions based on estimated depth (simplified assumption based on object size and context initially – later refined with multi-view cues if available).
    2.  **Tracking & Position Update:**  In subsequent frames:
        *   Use annotation data to track object positions.
        *   Update `ObjectState.position_history` with the current 3D position.
        *   Calculate `ObjectState.velocity` using past positions.
    3.  **Prediction:**
        *   Predict `ObjectState.predicted_position` based on `velocity` and a simplified physics model (constant velocity, gravity).
        *   Adjust `ObjectState.confidence` based on occlusion, rapid changes in velocity, or proximity to scene boundaries.
    4.  **Scene Graph Update:**
        *   Update the `SceneGraph` to reflect the current object positions.
        *   Handle occlusion by temporarily removing objects from the `SceneGraph` and using predicted positions for continuity.
        *   Maintain spatial relationships (edges) between objects, updating distances and orientations.
*   **Output:**
    *   Summarized video clips selected using existing priority metrics (from base patent).
    *   A navigable 3D scene representation (the `SceneGraph`) synchronized with the video.
    *   User interface enabling “look around” within the reconstructed scene, using the `SceneGraph` for rendering and navigation.
*   **Pseudocode -  Prediction Step:**

```pseudocode
function predict_object_position(object_state, time_delta):
    // Simple constant velocity prediction
    predicted_x = object_state.position_history[-1].x + object_state.velocity.x * time_delta
    predicted_y = object_state.position_history[-1].y + object_state.velocity.y * time_delta
    predicted_z = object_state.position_history[-1].z + object_state.velocity.z * time_delta

    // Basic occlusion handling - reduce confidence if predicted position is near a scene boundary
    if predicted_x < 0 or predicted_x > scene_width:
        object_state.confidence = object_state.confidence * 0.5

    return (predicted_x, predicted_y, predicted_z)
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Multi-View Integration:** If multiple camera streams are available, fuse data to improve 3D reconstruction accuracy.
*   **Semantic Understanding:**  Integrate semantic understanding (object classifications) to improve prediction accuracy (e.g., predict a pedestrian will stay on the sidewalk).
*   **User Interaction:** Allow users to manually adjust object positions or trajectories in the reconstructed scene.
*   **Generative Fill:** Employ generative fill algorithms to intelligently fill in missing data due to occlusion.
