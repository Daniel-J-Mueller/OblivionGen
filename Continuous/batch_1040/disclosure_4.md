## Adaptive Degradation Profiles & Multi-Layered Art Samples

**Concept:** Expand the degradation aspect beyond a simple timed decay. Implement multi-layered art samples where each layer degrades at a different rate, revealing underlying layers and creating a dynamic art piece *before* complete disappearance. This allows for a more complex visualization of the artwork’s evolution and potentially conveys information about the original piece’s creation process or emotional intent.

**Specs:**

*   **Material Composition:** Art sample comprised of 3-5 distinct layers. Each layer constructed from a material with a uniquely defined degradation timescale. Examples:
    *   Layer 1: Fast-degrading, water-soluble ink on thin, easily dissolved paper (degrades within 24-72 hours – initial aesthetic layer).
    *   Layer 2: Medium-degrading, UV-sensitive pigment on moderately durable paper (degrades within 7-14 days – reveals underlying structure).
    *   Layer 3: Slow-degrading, bio-degradable polymer with embedded micro-capsules containing color-changing compounds (degrades within 30-60 days – introduces subtle color shifts).
    *   Layer 4 (Optional): Extremely slow-degrading, inert base layer with a patterned texture (acts as a final “ghost” of the artwork).
*   **Data Encoding:** Degradation rates are *not* uniform across the sample. Specific areas are masked during initial printing to create a “degradation map”. This map could encode information about the original artwork’s brushstrokes, color palette, or underlying form. The degradation map data is stored on the server, linked to the unique identifier of the art sample.
*   **AR Integration:** The AR app does *not* simply overlay the original artwork. Instead, it visualizes the *degradation process itself*. The app can:
    *   Predict the future state of the art sample based on the degradation map and current environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, UV exposure).
    *   Highlight areas of the art sample that are currently undergoing significant change.
    *   Offer a “time-lapse” view of the art sample’s degradation over time.
    *   Extract metadata about the original artwork from the degradation map data and present it to the user (e.g., “This section of the painting was created using a layering technique”).
*   **Printing Protocol:** Modified printing process to accommodate multi-layered printing and selective masking. Requires precise control over ink deposition and material layering.
*   **Machine-Readable Identifier:**  Integrated QR code or NFC tag embedded *within* a specific degradation layer.  This allows the AR app to accurately track the degradation process and link it to the correct artwork metadata.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Optional integration of miniature environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, UV) within the art sample. This provides real-time data to the AR app for more accurate degradation prediction.

**Pseudocode (AR App - Degradation Visualization):**

```
FUNCTION visualizeDegradation(artSampleID, environmentalData):
  // Fetch degradation map and artwork metadata from server
  degradationMap = SERVER.getDegradationMap(artSampleID)
  artworkMetadata = SERVER.getArtworkMetadata(artSampleID)

  // Calculate predicted degradation state based on time elapsed and environmental data
  predictedState = calculateDegradation(degradationMap, timeElapsed, environmentalData)

  // Render visual representation of predicted state on top of live camera feed
  RENDER.overlayDegradationMap(predictedState, cameraFeed)

  // Highlight areas undergoing significant change
  highlightedAreas = detectSignificantChange(predictedState, previousState)
  RENDER.highlightAreas(highlightedAreas, cameraFeed)

  // Display extracted metadata about the original artwork
  DISPLAY.showMetadata(artworkMetadata)
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This shifts from simply displaying a preview to actively visualizing the *process* of decay, leveraging it as a form of information delivery and artistic expression.  The dynamic, multi-layered approach adds a temporal dimension to the artwork preview and provides a richer, more engaging user experience.
