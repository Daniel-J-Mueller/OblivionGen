## Dynamic Fragment Sharding & Temporal Encryption Keys

**Concept:** Extend the erasure-encoding/encryption approach by introducing *dynamic* fragment sharding and *temporal* encryption keys. Instead of static fragment sizes/distributions and consistent encryption, the system will adaptively shard data and rotate encryption keys based on access patterns and data sensitivity *over time*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Adaptive Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Data file, sensitivity score (user-defined or algorithmically determined), historical access logs.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyzes access patterns: frequently accessed data will be sharded into smaller fragments. Infrequently accessed data will be aggregated into larger fragments.
    *   Sensitivity score drives replication factor. Higher sensitivity = more fragments/copies.
    *   Algorithmically determines optimal fragment size and distribution across storage devices based on network bandwidth, storage capacity, and access patterns.
    *   Generates a sharding map – a metadata file detailing the fragment distribution.
*   **Output:** Sharded data fragments, Sharding Map.

**2. Temporal Key Management System:**

*   **Key Generation:** A hierarchical key derivation function (HKDF) generates encryption keys. The seed for HKDF is:
    *   Data file hash.
    *   Timestamp of data creation.
    *   Random salt.
*   **Key Rotation:** Encryption keys are rotated periodically (configurable).  New keys are derived from the previous key, the data file hash, and a counter.
*   **Fragment-Level Encryption:** Each fragment is encrypted with a unique key derived from the temporal key system. This key is stored separately from the fragment itself (e.g., in a secure enclave or using a distributed key management system).
*   **Key Versioning:** Store key versions alongside the fragments. This allows decryption with the correct key even after rotation.
*   **Key Revocation:** Implement a key revocation mechanism to invalidate compromised keys.

**3. Reconstruction Process:**

*   **Metadata Retrieval:** Retrieve Sharding Map and Key Version information.
*   **Fragment Acquisition:** Retrieve necessary fragments from storage.
*   **Key Derivation:** Derive the appropriate encryption key based on fragment timestamp and file hash.
*   **Decryption & Erasure Decoding:** Decrypt fragments and reconstruct the data file using erasure decoding.
*   **Access Pattern Monitoring:** Log fragment access for future sharding optimization.

**Pseudocode – Reconstruction Process:**

```
FUNCTION reconstruct_data(file_hash, fragment_list)

  sharding_map = retrieve_sharding_map(file_hash)
  key_versions = retrieve_key_versions(file_hash, fragment_list)

  decrypted_fragments = []
  FOR EACH fragment IN fragment_list
    key = derive_key(file_hash, fragment.timestamp, key_versions)
    decrypted_fragment = decrypt(fragment, key)
    APPEND decrypted_fragment TO decrypted_fragments
  END FOR

  reconstructed_data = erasure_decode(decrypted_fragments, sharding_map)
  RETURN reconstructed_data
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Secure enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) for key storage.
*   Distributed Key Management System (DKMS).
*   High-bandwidth network connectivity.
*   Storage devices with high IOPS.
*   Scalable metadata management system.
*   Monitoring and alerting for key rotation and potential security breaches.
