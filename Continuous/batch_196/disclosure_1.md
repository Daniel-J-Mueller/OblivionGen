## Automated Pet Access & Monitoring System

**System Overview:** A localized RF beacon network integrated with garage door/gate control and pet biometrics for automated, secure pet access to/from a contained area (yard, garage, etc.). This expands on the location-based access concept to a new user group (pets) and introduces biometric verification.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Pet Collar Unit:**
    *   Low-power Bluetooth/RF transceiver.
    *   Micro-camera (for facial/feature recognition - *optional, can be replaced with RFID/unique acoustic signature*).
    *   Microphone (for acoustic signature/bark recognition).
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope (activity monitoring, fall detection).
    *   Rechargeable Battery.
*   **Gateway Unit (integrated with garage door opener):**
    *   RF receiver (detects pet collar signals).
    *   Camera (for visual confirmation of pet proximity).
    *   Microprocessor (data processing, decision-making).
    *   Garage Door Opener Interface (control signals).
    *   Wi-Fi Module (remote monitoring/control).
*   **RF Beacon Network:** Small, low-power RF beacons strategically placed around the perimeter of the contained area, defining "safe zones."

**Software/Logic:**

1.  **Pet Profile Creation:** User creates a profile for each pet including:
    *   Biometric data (facial features, acoustic signature).
    *   Authorized access times.
    *   "Safe Zone" definitions (areas pet is allowed to roam).
2.  **Localization & Identification:**
    *   Pet collar continuously transmits RF signals.
    *   Gateway & beacons triangulate pet's location.
    *   Gateway verifies pet’s identity via biometric matching.
3.  **Access Control:**
    *   If pet is within an authorized “Safe Zone” *and* is within authorized access times, the gateway grants access (opens door/gate).
    *   If the pet attempts to leave the “Safe Zone” or access outside authorized times, the gateway denies access.
4.  **Alerting:**
    *   Sends alerts to user’s mobile device for:
        *   Unauthorized access attempts.
        *   Pet leaving “Safe Zone.”
        *   Inactivity (potential health issue).
        *   Fall detection.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
define petProfiles = {}
define safeZones = {}

//Pet Collar Transmission Loop
transmit(petID, locationData, biometricData)

// Gateway Receiving Loop
receive(petID, locationData, biometricData)

// Localization Function
function localizePet(petID, locationData) {
  //Triangulate position based on beacon signals
  return petPosition
}

// Identification Function
function identifyPet(biometricData) {
  //Match biometric data to petProfiles
  if (matchFound) {
    return petID
  } else {
    return unknownPet
  }
}

// Access Control Function
function grantAccess(petID, petPosition, currentTime) {
  if (petID != unknownPet) {
    if (petPosition within safeZone) {
      if (currentTime within authorizedAccessTimes) {
        openGarageDoor()
        return accessGranted
      } else {
        return accessDenied
      }
    } else {
      return accessDenied
    }
  } else {
    return accessDenied
  }
}

//Alerting Function
function sendAlert(alertType, petID) {
  //Send notification to user’s mobile device
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with smart home ecosystems (e.g., Alexa, Google Assistant).
*   Automated feeding/watering based on pet’s location and activity.
*   Remote visual monitoring via integrated camera.
*   Machine learning to predict pet’s behavior and optimize access control.
