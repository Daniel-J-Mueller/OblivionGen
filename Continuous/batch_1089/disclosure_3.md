## Adaptive Authentication Weighting System

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on counting failed authentication attempts. This design expands on that by assigning *weights* to authentication factors based on context and user behavior, dynamically adjusting authentication stringency. It moves beyond simple counting to a probabilistic risk assessment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection Module:**

*   **Input:** User authentication attempts (username/password, biometric data, MFA token, device ID, geolocation, time of day, network information).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Collect historical authentication data for each user.
    *   Track successful and failed attempts for each factor.
    *   Calculate a "trust score" for each authentication factor based on historical success rate.
    *   Record contextual data (location, time, device).
*   **Output:** Normalized trust scores for each authentication factor, contextual data, user history.

**2. Risk Assessment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Normalized trust scores, contextual data, user history, pre-defined risk profiles (e.g., high-value accounts, sensitive data access).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Apply a weighted scoring system based on the factors:
        *   **Factor Weight:** Dynamically adjusted based on user behavior (e.g., frequent successful logins from a known location = lower weight for location factor).
        *   **Contextual Weight:** Adjusted based on risk profile (e.g., access to financial data = higher weight for MFA factor).
    *   Calculate an overall "authentication risk score".
    *   Compare the risk score against pre-defined thresholds.
*   **Output:** Authentication risk score, recommended authentication level (e.g., standard, enhanced, multi-factor).

**3. Adaptive Authentication Handler:**

*   **Input:** Recommended authentication level, user authentication attempt.
*   **Processing:**
    *   If authentication level is 'standard': Request standard authentication factors (e.g., username/password).
    *   If authentication level is 'enhanced': Request additional factors (e.g., security question, SMS code).
    *   If authentication level is 'multi-factor': Require MFA (e.g., authenticator app, biometric verification).
    *   Monitor authentication attempt success/failure.
    *   Update trust scores and risk profiles in real-time.
*   **Output:** Authentication success/failure notification, updated trust scores and risk profiles.

**Pseudocode (Risk Assessment Engine):**

```
function calculateRiskScore(trustScores, contextualData, riskProfile):
  factorWeight = {
    "username": 0.2,
    "password": 0.3,
    "location": 0.1,
    "device": 0.1,
    "mfa": 0.3
  }

  contextualWeight = {
    "highValueAccount": 0.5,
    "sensitiveData": 0.7
  }

  riskScore = 0

  // Calculate risk based on factor trust scores
  for factor, score in trustScores.items():
    riskScore += score * factorWeight[factor]

  // Adjust risk based on contextual weights
  if riskProfile.highValueAccount:
    riskScore += contextualWeight.highValueAccount
  if riskProfile.sensitiveData:
    riskScore += contextualWeight.sensitiveData

  return riskScore
```

**Novelty:** This design moves beyond static counting to a dynamic risk assessment that adapts to user behavior and context. It utilizes weighted scoring and real-time updates to provide a more flexible and secure authentication experience.
