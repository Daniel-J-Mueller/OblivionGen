## Dynamic Resource Granularity & Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting resource granularity delivered to a user device, coupled with a predictive prefetching engine informed by user interaction patterns and resource dependency graphs.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on subscription-based updates for *identified* resources. This extends that concept by allowing resources to be broken down into arbitrarily granular chunks *after* initial delivery, and prefetches subsequent chunks *before* the user explicitly requests them.

**System Components:**

1.  **Resource Decomposition Engine:**  A server-side component responsible for dividing resources (documents, media, code) into a dependency graph of smaller, independently addressable chunks. Chunk size and content are determined by resource type and initial configuration. 
2.  **User Interaction Monitor:** A client-side component that tracks user interactions with presented resources – scroll position, mouse movements, code execution paths, media consumption patterns, etc. This data is transmitted to the server (with appropriate privacy controls).
3.  **Predictive Prefetching Engine:** A server-side component that analyzes user interaction data and the resource dependency graph. It predicts which resource chunks the user is likely to need *next* and proactively prefetches those chunks to the user device. This engine leverages a weighted scoring system – recent interaction heavily influences immediate predictions, while longer-term patterns guide more distant predictions.
4.  **Dynamic Granularity Adjustment:** The server can dynamically *increase* or *decrease* the granularity of resources delivered based on network conditions, device capabilities, or user behavior. For example, under poor network conditions, larger, more consolidated chunks are sent.  Conversely, for high-bandwidth connections and engaged users, finer-grained chunks enable smoother, more responsive experiences.
5. **Subscription Adaptation:** The existing subscription model is extended to manage not just resource *identifiers* but also *granularity levels*. The server maintains subscription information indicating the user’s preferred or automatically-determined granularity level.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Prefetching Engine):**

```
function predict_next_chunks(user_interaction_data, resource_dependency_graph, user_subscription):
  // Calculate 'interaction score' for each resource chunk based on recent user activity
  chunk_scores = calculate_chunk_scores(user_interaction_data, resource_dependency_graph)

  //Apply subscription preferences (e.g., preferred granularity) to chunk scores
  adjusted_chunk_scores = apply_subscription_preferences(chunk_scores, user_subscription)

  // Calculate a 'probability of access' score for each chunk
  probability_scores = calculate_access_probability(adjusted_chunk_scores, resource_dependency_graph)

  // Sort chunks by probability score (descending)
  sorted_chunks = sort_chunks_by_probability(probability_scores)

  // Select top N chunks for prefetching (N is configurable)
  prefetch_chunks = sorted_chunks[0:N]

  return prefetch_chunks

function calculate_chunk_scores(user_interaction_data, resource_dependency_graph):
  //Implementation details (e.g., time-decaying weight, proximity to current view)
  //Return a score for each chunk in the dependency graph
  pass

function apply_subscription_preferences(chunk_scores, user_subscription):
  //Adjust scores based on preferred granularity, bandwidth limits, etc.
  pass

function calculate_access_probability(chunk_scores, resource_dependency_graph):
  //Consider dependency relationships (e.g., a chunk is unlikely to be accessed without its parent)
  pass
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   **Caching:** Aggressive caching is crucial on both the server and client sides.
*   **Privacy:** User interaction data must be anonymized and handled responsibly.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be able to handle a large number of users and resources.
*   **Real-time Analysis:**  Low-latency analysis of user interaction data is essential for accurate predictions.
