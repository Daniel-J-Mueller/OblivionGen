## Dynamic Transaction Tagging & Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the configurable port to dynamically apply tags to outbound transactions, enabling intelligent prioritization and routing based on real-time system conditions. This moves beyond static attribute encoding to reactive transaction management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Tag Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Outbound transaction data (address, attribute, data payload). System-wide performance metrics (latency, bandwidth utilization, queue depths).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze performance metrics.
    *   Apply a tagging algorithm based on metrics and pre-defined policies. Policies should be configurable via software.
    *   Tagging Algorithm Examples:
        *   **Latency-Based:** Transactions impacting critical paths (identified by address ranges) receive “High Priority” tag if latency exceeds a threshold.
        *   **Bandwidth-Aware:** Transactions using significant bandwidth receive a “Rate Limit” tag.
        *   **Data-Type Specific:** Transactions containing real-time data (e.g., video stream) receive a “Realtime” tag.
    *   Output: Tagged transaction (transaction data + tag). Tags are encoded as additional bits appended to the transaction, utilizing unused space in the protocol or leveraging existing extension fields.

**2. Intelligent Routing Switch (Integrated with Configurable Port):**

*   **Input:** Tagged transaction.
*   **Process:**
    *   Read the tag.
    *   Apply routing rules based on the tag. Examples:
        *   “High Priority” transactions bypass queues and are transmitted immediately.
        *   “Rate Limit” transactions are throttled to prevent congestion.
        *   “Realtime” transactions are directed to dedicated, low-latency paths.
    *   Prioritize transactions within queues based on tags.
*   **Output:** Transmitted transaction.

**3. Dynamic Policy Engine:**

*   **Software Interface:** Allows administrators to define and modify tagging policies and routing rules.
*   **Policy Storage:** Non-volatile memory.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:** Policies are updated dynamically without system interruption.
*   **Monitoring & Analytics:** Tracks tag usage and system performance to optimize policies.

**Pseudocode (Tag Generation Module):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateTag(transaction, systemMetrics)
  IF systemMetrics.latency[transaction.address] > latencyThreshold THEN
    tag = "HighPriority"
  ELSE IF transaction.dataType == "Realtime" THEN
    tag = "Realtime"
  ELSE IF systemMetrics.bandwidthUtilization > bandwidthThreshold THEN
    tag = "RateLimit"
  ELSE
    tag = "Normal"
  END IF
  RETURN tag
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION TagTransaction(transaction, systemMetrics)
  tag = GenerateTag(transaction, systemMetrics)
  taggedTransaction = transaction + tag // Append tag to transaction data
  RETURN taggedTransaction
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   FPGA implementation of the Tag Generation Module and Intelligent Routing Switch for high performance and flexibility.
*   Dedicated memory for storing tagging policies and system metrics.
*   High-speed interconnect between the configurable port and the FPGA.
