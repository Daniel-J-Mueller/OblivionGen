## Adaptive Data Sharding with Dynamic Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Expand on the policy-driven encryption by introducing data sharding *before* encryption, dynamically adjusting shard count and storage location based on data sensitivity *and* real-time threat intelligence. This creates a multi-layered security approach, reducing the impact of a single key compromise and enabling fine-grained access control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Classification & Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Raw data object, associated account details, initial data sensitivity classification (low, medium, high - user configurable, with defaults).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze data content (keyword scanning, pattern recognition, potentially utilizing external threat intelligence feeds) to refine sensitivity classification.
    *   Based on refined sensitivity:
        *   Determine optimal shard count (e.g., Low = 1 shard, Medium = 3 shards, High = 5+ shards).
        *   Select storage locations for each shard. Locations could be tiered â€“ local SSD, regional cloud storage, geographically dispersed cold storage. Prioritize locations based on cost, latency, and security profiles.
        *   Generate shard IDs and associated metadata (encryption key ID, storage location, access control list).
*   **Output:** Shard list with metadata.

**2. Encryption & Distribution Module:**

*   **Input:** Data object, shard list.
*   **Process:**
    *   Split data object into shards based on the shard list.
    *   Encrypt each shard individually using a unique key derived from a master key associated with the account. Utilize authenticated encryption (e.g., AES-GCM) for integrity and confidentiality.
    *   Distribute shards to their designated storage locations. Implement secure transfer protocols (e.g., TLS with mutual authentication).
*   **Output:** Encrypted shards stored in designated locations.

**3. Retrieval & Reassembly Service:**

*   **Input:** User request for data object, user credentials.
*   **Process:**
    *   Authenticate user and authorize access to the data object.
    *   Retrieve shard list from metadata store.
    *   Retrieve encrypted shards from their storage locations.
    *   Verify shard integrity (using authenticated encryption tags).
    *   Decrypt shards.
    *   Reassemble shards into the original data object.
*   **Output:** Reassembled data object.

**4. Dynamic Policy Enforcement & Key Rotation:**

*   **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Continuously monitor threat intelligence feeds for indicators of compromise or emerging threats.
*   **Real-time Policy Adjustment:** Based on threat intelligence and data sensitivity, dynamically adjust sharding levels, storage locations, and encryption keys. (e.g., if a storage location is compromised, automatically migrate shards to a different location and re-encrypt with a new key).
*   **Key Rotation:** Implement automated key rotation schedules and procedures. Utilize a hierarchical key management system to minimize the impact of key compromise.
*   **Account Level Policy Override:** Allow account administrators to override default sharding and encryption policies for specific data objects or accounts.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation):**

```
function rotateKey(accountId, dataObjectId):
  // 1. Get current key ID associated with data object
  currentKeyId = getKeyId(accountId, dataObjectId)

  // 2. Generate new key
  newKeyId = generateKey()

  // 3. Re-encrypt shards using the new key
  for each shard in getShards(accountId, dataObjectId):
    shard = reEncryptShard(shard, newKeyId)
    updateShardMetadata(shard, newKeyId)

  // 4. Archive or destroy the old key (based on retention policy)
  archiveKey(currentKeyId)

  // 5. Update metadata store with new key ID
  updateKeyId(accountId, dataObjectId, newKeyId)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Secure Enclave/Hardware Security Module (HSM) for key generation and storage.
*   Distributed storage system with support for data sharding and replication.
*   Real-time threat intelligence platform integration.
*   API for programmatic access and policy management.
