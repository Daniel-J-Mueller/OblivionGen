## Dynamic Skill-Based Call Queuing & AI-Driven Warm Transfer

**Specification:** A system extending the core functionality of the provided patent – location/page-based call routing – by incorporating real-time skill assessment of both the caller *and* the topic specialist, dynamically adjusting the call queue and facilitating AI-driven warm transfers based on nuanced understanding of the interaction.

**Components:**

*   **Caller Skill Profiler (CSP):**  Integrated within the initial call flow.  Utilizes a combination of:
    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP) of Initial Utterance:**  Analyzes the caller's opening statement (spoken or typed) to infer technical proficiency, emotional state (frustration, urgency), and the *type* of problem they’re experiencing (e.g., “I’m trying to configure…” vs. “My account is locked.”).
    *   **Implicit Data:**  Leverages caller ID, CRM data (if available), and past interaction history to build a preliminary skill profile.
    *   **Adaptive Questionnaire:**  Presents a minimal set of targeted questions (voice or text-based) to refine the skill profile.  The questions adapt based on initial NLP and implicit data analysis. Example: If initial analysis suggests a novice user, questions focus on basic terminology; if it suggests an experienced user, questions delve into more complex configurations.

*   **Specialist Skill Matrix (SSM):** A dynamically updated database associating each topic specialist with a granular skill profile. This goes beyond simple topic expertise (e.g., “Networking”) to include:
    *   **Technical Skills:** Proficiency levels in specific technologies (e.g., “Cisco Routers – Advanced”, “Python Scripting – Intermediate”).
    *   **Soft Skills:** Communication style, empathy level, problem-solving approach (determined through periodic assessments and interaction analysis).
    *   **Real-time Availability & Capacity:** Tracks current workload, ongoing calls, and historical response times.

*   **Dynamic Queue Manager (DQM):** The core routing engine. 
    *   **Skill Matching Algorithm:** Uses the CSP and SSM to identify the *best* available specialist, not just the one assigned to the initial network page.  Prioritizes specialists with complementary skills (e.g., pairing a novice caller with a patient, communicative specialist).
    *   **Predictive Wait Time Calculation:**  Estimates wait times based on queue length, specialist availability, and the complexity of the caller's issue (inferred from the CSP).
    *   **Proactive Intervention:**  If wait times exceed a threshold, the DQM can offer alternative support options (e.g., knowledge base articles, self-service tools).

*   **AI-Powered Warm Transfer Engine (WTE):**  If the initial specialist determines a more specialized skillset is required, the WTE facilitates a seamless warm transfer. 
    *   **Contextual Summary Generation:**  The WTE automatically generates a concise summary of the conversation, including the problem description, troubleshooting steps taken, and the caller’s skill level.  This is passed to the receiving specialist.
    *   **Skill Gap Identification:**  The WTE analyzes the conversation to identify areas where the caller needs further assistance and proactively suggests relevant knowledge base articles or training resources.
    *   **Real-time Transcription & Sentiment Analysis:** Continuously monitors the conversation for key terms and emotional cues, providing the receiving specialist with a real-time understanding of the caller's needs and concerns.

**Pseudocode (DQM Skill Matching):**

```
function findBestSpecialist(callerSkillProfile, networkPageTopic, specialistSkillMatrix) {
  // Filter specialists by topic expertise
  candidateSpecialists = specialistSkillMatrix.filter(specialist => specialist.topicExpertise.includes(networkPageTopic));

  // Calculate skill compatibility score
  for (specialist in candidateSpecialists) {
    compatibilityScore = calculateCompatibility(callerSkillProfile, specialist.skillProfile);
    specialist.compatibilityScore = compatibilityScore;
  }

  // Sort specialists by compatibility score (descending)
  sortedSpecialists = sortedSpecialists.sort((a, b) => b.compatibilityScore - a.compatibilityScore);

  // Select the highest-scoring available specialist
  for (specialist in sortedSpecialists) {
    if (specialist.availability == true) {
      return specialist;
    }
  }

  // If no specialists are available, return a fallback specialist (e.g., a supervisor)
  return fallbackSpecialist;
}

function calculateCompatibility(callerProfile, specialistProfile) {
  // Implement a scoring algorithm that considers various factors, such as:
  // - Skill overlap (e.g., matching technical skills)
  // - Skill gap (e.g., the specialist's ability to address the caller's needs)
  // - Communication style compatibility
  // ...
  return compatibilityScore;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced call handling times
*   Improved customer satisfaction
*   Increased first call resolution rates
*   Enhanced specialist productivity
*   Proactive support and issue prevention
