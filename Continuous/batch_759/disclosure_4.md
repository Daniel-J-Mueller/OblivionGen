**Dynamic Certificate Chain Attestation with Hardware Root of Trust**

**Concept:** Extend the trust evaluation beyond simply verifying the certificate chain to *attesting* to the integrity of the entire chain using a hardware root of trust. This creates a significantly stronger assurance of trustworthiness, particularly in environments vulnerable to sophisticated attacks.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration:** The system will integrate with a TPM 2.0 (or equivalent) HSM on the client device. This HSM will act as the root of trust.

2.  **Certificate Chain Measurement:** When a certificate is presented:
    *   The complete certificate chain (root to leaf) will be measured (hashed) by the HSM.
    *   These measurements will be stored in the HSM’s Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs). Specific PCRs will be dedicated to certificate chain measurements.

3.  **Remote Attestation:**
    *   A remote attestation service will be implemented. This service will request an attestation report from the client HSM.
    *   The attestation report will contain the PCR values corresponding to the measured certificate chain.
    *   The remote attestation service will verify the attestation report’s signature using the HSM's endorsement key.
    *   The service will maintain a whitelist of acceptable PCR values (representing known-good certificate chains). The whitelist can be dynamically updated.

4.  **Policy Engine Integration:** The policy engine (as described in the base patent) will be expanded to incorporate attestation data.
    *   The policy rule will be defined as follows: “Trust certificate IF attestation report is valid AND PCR values match whitelist AND other policy conditions are met”.
    *   Policy rules can be defined for specific applications or user groups.

5.  **Chain of Trust Extension:** The system will extend the chain of trust beyond just certificate authorities. It will include measurements of the software components involved in certificate validation (e.g., TLS libraries, certificate parsing routines). This provides defense-in-depth against compromised software.

**Pseudocode (Policy Evaluation):**

```
FUNCTION evaluateCertificate(certificate, applicationID):
  attestationReport = getAttestationReport()
  IF attestationReport IS valid AND verifySignature(attestationReport):
    pcrValues = extractPcrValues(attestationReport)
    IF pcrValues MATCH whitelist[applicationID]:
      policyResult = applyPolicyRules(certificate, applicationID) // Existing policy evaluation from base patent
      RETURN policyResult
    ELSE:
      RETURN "Certificate chain integrity compromised"
  ELSE:
    RETURN "Attestation failed – device integrity suspect"
```

**Key Innovation:** The combination of hardware-rooted trust with dynamic certificate chain measurement and attestation creates a system resistant to many common and advanced attacks, including rogue CA attacks, certificate pinning bypasses, and compromised TLS libraries. It provides a verifiable guarantee of certificate chain integrity.
