## Adaptive Interrupt Prioritization via Learned Filtering

**Specification:** A system for dynamic interrupt prioritization based on learned usage patterns and predictive filtering.

**Core Concept:** The patent details an architecture for routing interrupts via a side-channel to a central access device. This inspires an extension - not just *routing* the interrupts, but *filtering* and prioritizing them *before* they reach the microcontroller, based on predicted relevance.

**Components:**

1.  **Interrupt Source Modules (ISM):** Each controlled device has an ISM. These modules *do not* directly signal the access device for *every* interrupt. They gather interrupt data, timestamp it, and transmit summaries to a 'Predictive Filter'.

2.  **Predictive Filter (PF):** This is the central intelligence. It utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to learn patterns of interrupt occurrence from each ISM. The LSTM will predict the likelihood of a given interrupt being *relevant* to the current system state. 

3.  **Relevance Threshold:** A configurable value determining the minimum predicted relevance score required for an interrupt to be passed to the access device.

4.  **Access Device Integration:** The access device receives only ‘relevant’ interrupts (those exceeding the relevance threshold) from the Predictive Filter, significantly reducing the interrupt load on the microcontroller.

**Operation:**

1.  **Data Collection:** Each ISM continuously gathers interrupt data (type, timestamp, associated data).

2.  **Pattern Learning:** The PF receives interrupt data streams from all ISMs. The LSTM within the PF learns temporal relationships and correlations between interrupt types, system states (determined from sensor data, command history, etc.), and overall system behavior.

3.  **Relevance Prediction:** When an interrupt occurs in an ISM, the ISM sends a 'feature vector' representing the interrupt and current system state to the PF. The PF uses its trained LSTM to predict a 'relevance score' for that interrupt.

4.  **Filtering & Routing:**  If the relevance score exceeds the configured threshold, the ISM signals the access device via the existing side-channel. Otherwise, the interrupt is suppressed.

5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The system monitors microcontroller load and adjusts the relevance threshold dynamically. If the microcontroller is heavily loaded, the threshold is increased to suppress more interrupts. Conversely, if the microcontroller is idle, the threshold is lowered.

**Pseudocode (PF - Relevance Prediction):**

```
function predict_relevance(interrupt_data, system_state):
  # input: interrupt_data (vector of interrupt characteristics)
  #        system_state (vector of system variables)

  # Combine interrupt data and system state into a single feature vector
  feature_vector = concatenate(interrupt_data, system_state)

  # Pass feature vector through trained LSTM network
  relevance_score = LSTM_network.predict(feature_vector)

  return relevance_score
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Each ISM requires a small microcontroller or FPGA to manage data collection and communication with the PF.
*   The PF requires a dedicated processing unit – potentially a dedicated AI accelerator chip or a powerful embedded processor.
*   Communication between ISMs and the PF can utilize a low-bandwidth, dedicated communication bus.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced interrupt load on the microcontroller, improving real-time performance and responsiveness.
*   Improved power efficiency by reducing unnecessary wake-ups.
*   Adaptive behavior - the system learns and adjusts to changing workloads and system conditions.
*   Enhanced reliability - suppression of irrelevant interrupts reduces the risk of spurious errors.

**Novelty:** Existing interrupt controllers prioritize based on static settings. This specification adds *learned* prioritization based on runtime behavior. This is a significant departure from traditional designs, and opens the door for a more intelligent and efficient interrupt handling system.
