## Adaptive Mapping Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of mapping information based on access patterns and storage object characteristics. The existing patent describes asynchronous updates to mapping information, but assumes a relatively static structure. This innovation introduces the capability to *change* how mapping is done – from coarse-grained (e.g., mapping to a bucket) to fine-grained (e.g., mapping to a specific object within a bucket) – *on the fly*.

**Specification:**

1.  **Access Pattern Monitor:** A system component constantly monitors access patterns to storage objects. Metrics tracked include:
    *   Access frequency per bucket.
    *   Access frequency per object.
    *   Object size.
    *   Object modification rate.
    *   Read/Write ratio.

2.  **Granularity Controller:** This component analyzes the data from the Access Pattern Monitor and determines the optimal mapping granularity for each bucket or set of objects.  The controller utilizes a cost function.

    *   *Cost Function Parameters:*
        *   Mapping Table Size:  The memory footprint of the mapping information.
        *   Lookup Latency: The time required to find a storage object.
        *   Update Frequency: How often the mapping information needs to be updated.

    *   *Granularity Levels:*
        *   Level 0: Bucket-level mapping (coarsest)
        *   Level 1:  Object-level mapping (finer)
        *   Level 2:  Attribute-level mapping (finest – map to specific attributes *within* an object. Requires object metadata indexing)

3.  **Dynamic Remapping Engine:**  This engine performs the actual remapping of storage objects. This is critical and must be done asynchronously to avoid disrupting operations.

    *   *Remapping Process:*
        1.  Identify objects/buckets requiring remapping based on Granularity Controller decisions.
        2.  Create a temporary mapping table with the new granularity.
        3.  Asynchronously copy relevant data from the old mapping table to the new one.
        4.  Switch to using the new mapping table.
        5.  Discard the old mapping table.

4. **Metadata Propagation**: When switching granularity, associated metadata needs to be updated across the system. This includes caching layers, access control lists, and replication mechanisms.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Remapping Engine):**

```
function Remap(bucketID, newGranularityLevel) {
  // Create a new mapping table
  newMappingTable = CreateMappingTable(newGranularityLevel);

  // Asynchronously copy data from the old mapping table
  foreach (object in GetObjectsInBucket(bucketID)) {
    // Determine the key and value based on newGranularityLevel
    key = GenerateKey(object, newGranularityLevel);
    value = GenerateValue(object, newGranularityLevel);
    newMappingTable.put(key, value);
  }

  // Atomically switch to the new mapping table (using a pointer swap or similar)
  SwapMappingTable(bucketID, newMappingTable);

  // Discard the old mapping table (garbage collection will handle it)
  DiscardMappingTable(oldMappingTable);
}
```

**Considerations:**

*   The cost function needs careful tuning to balance memory usage, lookup latency, and update frequency.
*   The remapping process must be atomic to avoid data inconsistencies.
*   A fallback mechanism should be in place in case the remapping process fails.
*   Implement a monitoring system to track the effectiveness of dynamic remapping and identify areas for improvement.
