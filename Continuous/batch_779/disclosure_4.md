## Dynamic DNS Reputation Scoring & Selective Routing

**System Specifications:**

*   **Components:** DNS Resolver (as per existing patent), Reputation Database, Scoring Engine, Routing Policy Engine, Network Monitoring Agent.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *DNS Request Log:* Timestamp, Source IP, Domain Name, Request Type (A, AAAA, MX, etc.), Resolver Endpoint ID.
    *   *Reputation Entry:* Domain Name, Reputation Score (integer, range -100 to +100), Last Updated Timestamp, Observed Behavior Flags (e.g., Malware Hosting, Phishing Attempts, Botnet C&C).
    *   *Routing Policy:* Domain Name Pattern, Reputation Threshold, Action (Route to Public DNS, Route to Private DNS, Block Request, Log Only).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Network Monitoring Agent:* Collects DNS request logs from resolver endpoints.
    *   *Scoring Engine:*  Analyzes DNS request logs, external threat intelligence feeds (abuseipdb, virustotal, etc), and historical data to compute Reputation Scores.  Employs a weighted scoring system with decay.  Focus is on *behavioral* scoring.
    *   *Routing Policy Engine:* Evaluates incoming DNS requests against defined Routing Policies.  Considers both the domain name and the current Reputation Score.
    *   *Reputation Database:*  Stores Reputation Scores and associated data.  Utilizes a key-value store for fast lookups.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  A DNS request arrives at a resolver endpoint.
2.  The request is intercepted by the system *before* resolution.
3.  The Routing Policy Engine checks if a Routing Policy exists for the domain name (or a pattern matching the domain name).
4.  If a policy exists:
    *   The Reputation Database is queried for the domain’s Reputation Score.
    *   If the Reputation Score is below the defined threshold, the request is routed as specified in the policy (e.g., to a public DNS server, or blocked).
    *   If the Reputation Score is above the threshold, the request is routed to the configured private DNS server (as per existing patent functionality).
5.  If no policy exists, the request is routed to the configured private DNS server by default.
6.  The Scoring Engine continuously monitors DNS request logs.  For domains with low Reputation Scores or suspicious behavior, it updates the Reputation Score accordingly.
7.  The Reputation Database is periodically updated with external threat intelligence feeds.

**Pseudocode (Scoring Engine - Simplified):**

```
function calculate_reputation_score(domain, request_logs, threat_intel):
  base_score = 50  // Default score

  // Behavioral Scoring (example - weighting adjustable)
  if request_logs.count(domain) > 1000:  // High volume traffic
    base_score -= 10
  if request_logs.contains_suspicious_ip(domain):
    base_score -= 20
  if threat_intel.is_blacklisted(domain):
    base_score -= 50

  // Decay factor (reduce score over time)
  time_since_last_activity = calculate_time_since_last_activity(domain)
  decay_factor = 0.95 ^ time_since_last_activity

  final_score = base_score * decay_factor

  // Ensure score remains within bounds
  final_score = clamp(final_score, -100, 100)

  return final_score
```

**Novelty:**

This system shifts the focus from *static* DNS configuration to *dynamic* reputation-based routing. It allows for proactive mitigation of threats by diverting traffic away from malicious domains, even if those domains are not explicitly blocked. It allows for a flexible approach to DNS security, allowing admins to fine-tune routing policies based on real-time threat intelligence and observed behavior. It isn't simply about resolving domains; it’s about *how* domains are resolved based on their trustworthiness.
