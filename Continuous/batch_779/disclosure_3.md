## Haptic Biofeedback Wearable - 'Aura'

**Concept:** A wearable device, extending beyond simple notification or activity tracking, that analyzes biometric data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, muscle tension) and translates it into nuanced, localized haptic feedback *on the wearer’s spine*. The goal is to create a subtle, intuitive ‘body awareness’ system – a kind of internal compass reflecting physiological state.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Flexible, segmented band designed to conform to the curvature of the spine, extending from the base of the neck to the lower back. Segmented construction allows for localized haptic stimulation. Material: Biocompatible, flexible polymer with integrated sensors and micro-actuators. Width: 2-3cm.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   ECG/EKG: Measures heart rate and heart rate variability (HRV). Integrated into band at thoracic level.
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA): Measures skin conductance, indicating arousal levels. Sensors placed at lumbar level.
    *   Electromyography (EMG): Detects muscle tension in upper back/shoulders to assess stress. Embedded in band contacting shoulder blades.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): 6-axis IMU to detect posture and movement. Integrated into central band segment.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Array of micro-vibrators (linear resonant actuators - LRAs) embedded within each segment of the band. Each actuator can be individually controlled for frequency, amplitude, and pattern.
*   **Processing Unit:** Low-power microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M series) integrated into the band. Runs algorithms for signal processing, feature extraction, and haptic pattern generation.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication with a smartphone/tablet app.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-polymer battery. Expected battery life: 8-12 hours. Wireless charging capable.

**Algorithm/Functionality:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** Sensors continuously collect biometric data.
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Signal processing algorithms extract relevant features from the raw data (e.g., HRV metrics, EDA peak frequency, EMG muscle tension levels).
3.  **State Mapping:**  A ‘state map’ translates feature values into corresponding haptic feedback patterns.  Examples:
    *   *High HRV / Low EDA:* Gentle, rhythmic pulsations across the upper back – promoting relaxation.
    *   *Low HRV / High EDA:*  Rapid, localized vibrations on the lower back – indicating stress or anxiety.
    *   *Muscle Tension (shoulders):*  Gradual, ascending vibrations along the spine – prompting postural correction.
    *   *Posture Deviation (IMU):* Specific segments vibrate to guide the wearer into a more aligned position.
4.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:** The microcontroller generates the appropriate haptic patterns based on the state map.
5.  **Feedback Delivery:**  The micro-actuators deliver the haptic feedback to the wearer's spine.
6.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns from user feedback (via a companion app) to refine the state map and personalize the haptic patterns. User can define 'comfort zones' or flag patterns as distracting.

**Pseudocode (State Mapping - simplified):**

```
// Define thresholds for each biometric feature
HRV_threshold_relaxed = 60ms;
EDA_threshold_stress = 10uS;
EMG_threshold_tension = 50mV;

// Function to map biometric data to haptic pattern
function map_state_to_haptic(hrv, eda, emg) {

    if (hrv > HRV_threshold_relaxed && eda < EDA_threshold_stress && emg < EMG_threshold_tension) {
        return "gentle_rhythm";
    } else if (hrv < 40ms && eda > EDA_threshold_stress) {
        return "rapid_pulse";
    } else if (emg > EMG_threshold_tension) {
        return "ascending_vibration";
    } else {
        return "default_pattern"; // subtle, neutral vibration
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing wearables rely on visual or auditory notifications. This concept directly engages the wearer's proprioceptive sense through subtle, localized haptic feedback, offering a more discreet and intuitive form of physiological awareness.  The spinal delivery mechanism is also unique – leveraging the high density of nerve endings in this area for more nuanced sensory perception.
