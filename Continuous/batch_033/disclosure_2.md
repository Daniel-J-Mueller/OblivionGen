## Adaptive Multi-Modal Trigger Network

**Concept:** Expand the prediction of repeat behavior beyond simple time intervals to incorporate multi-modal data streams and a dynamic ‘trigger network’ that anticipates needs *before* explicit repetition occurs. This moves beyond reactive prediction to proactive suggestion.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** System ingests data from multiple sources:
    *   User Search History (as per the patent)
    *   Browsing History (across linked services/devices)
    *   Purchase History
    *   Location Data (opt-in, anonymized)
    *   Calendar Data (opt-in, anonymized) - appointments, travel
    *   Environmental Data - weather, time of day, day of the week.
    *   Social Media Activity (opt-in, anonymized) - trends, expressed interests.
*   **Entity Representation:** Each user is represented as a dynamic ‘entity’ with a weighted feature vector incorporating all ingested data.  Weights adjust based on recency and frequency of events.
*   **Trigger Network:** A Bayesian Network (BN) modeled to represent probabilistic relationships between ingested data features and potential ‘triggers’ – moments where the user is likely to repeat a behavior (or initiate a related one). Nodes represent features, and edges represent conditional probabilities.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:**  Instead of a static score threshold for redirection, the system calculates a *dynamic* threshold based on the user’s current context (derived from the BN).  Higher context relevance = lower threshold.
*   **Behavioral Clustering:** Utilize unsupervised learning (e.g., k-means) to cluster users based on behavioral patterns. This allows the system to leverage predictions from similar users when individual data is sparse.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** Based on the BN output and behavioral clustering, the recommendation engine selects items with the highest probability of engagement.  Prioritize items *not* directly from search results to encourage discovery.
*   **Multi-Modal Output:** Recommendations are delivered through various channels:
    *   Push Notifications (context-aware, intelligent scheduling)
    *   Personalized Homepage/Dashboard
    *   In-App Suggestions
    *   Augmented Reality Overlays (location-based, relevant offers)

**Pseudocode (Simplified BN Update):**

```
// Assume: BN is pre-trained, features are normalized
function updateBayesianNetwork(user, newFeatureValue) {
    //1. Identify relevant nodes in BN connected to 'newFeatureValue'
    relevantNodes = getConnectedNodes(newFeatureValue)

    //2. Update conditional probabilities based on observed 'newFeatureValue'
    for each node in relevantNodes {
        node.probability = calculateNewProbability(node, newFeatureValue)
    }

    //3. Propagate probability updates throughout the network
    propagateUpdates(networkRoot)
}

function calculateNewProbability(node, featureValue) {
    // Use a Bayesian updating formula based on prior probability and likelihood
    // Example: P(A|B) = [P(B|A) * P(A)] / P(B)
    // Implement a method to estimate P(B|A) based on training data
    // P(A) and P(B) are the prior probabilities
    return newProbability
}

function propagateUpdates(node) {
    // Recursively update probabilities in connected nodes
    for each child in node.children {
        propagateUpdates(child)
    }
}

```

**Novelty:** This design moves beyond simple temporal prediction. It creates a holistic, context-aware system that anticipates user needs by integrating multi-modal data, a dynamic trigger network, and proactive suggestion capabilities. It's a predictive *ecosystem* rather than a reactive algorithm.
