## Dynamic Payload Mutation Based on Server Response Semantics

**Specification:** A system to dynamically mutate payloads during web application vulnerability scanning, not based on pre-defined fuzzing lists, but on semantic analysis of server responses. This moves beyond simple string escapes to understand *how* the server interprets input and crafts payloads designed to exploit that interpretation.

**Components:**

1.  **Response Semantic Analyzer:** A module that takes a server response (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.) as input and performs the following:
    *   **DOM/Data Structure Parsing:** Parses the response into its constituent parts (DOM tree for HTML, JSON object for JSON, etc.).
    *   **Data Type Inference:**  Attempts to infer the expected data type of each input field or parameter (string, integer, email, URL, etc.) based on context – form field attributes, JSON schema, XML tags.
    *   **Input Validation Rule Detection:** Identifies any apparent input validation rules embedded within the response – JavaScript validation, HTML input attributes (pattern, min, max, type), server-side error messages hinting at validation.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Tracks how data flows within the response – where input data appears, how it's processed, and how it influences subsequent responses.

2.  **Payload Mutation Engine:**
    *   Takes the output of the Response Semantic Analyzer as input.
    *   Generates mutated payloads based on the inferred data types and validation rules.
        *   **Type-Specific Mutations:** If a field is expected to be an integer, generate payloads with integer overflows, underflows, and boundary values. If a string, test with different encodings, length variations, and control characters.
        *   **Validation Rule Bypassing:**  Attempt to craft payloads that satisfy the *form* of the validation rule while containing malicious code. For example, if a field expects a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, create a payload like "2023-12-31'; DROP TABLE users; --".
        *   **Contextual Injection:**  Based on how the input data is used, inject payloads into specific locations within the response. For example, if the input is used in a SQL query, inject SQL injection payloads. If used in a JavaScript function, inject JavaScript payloads.
    *   Utilize a probabilistic model. Mutations which yield changes in the response are given higher weighting.

3.  **Adaptive Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors the server’s response to each mutated payload.
    *   Analyzes the response for errors, changes in behavior, or signs of exploitation.
    *   Adjusts the Payload Mutation Engine’s strategies based on the feedback.
    *   If a particular mutation consistently fails, it is de-prioritized. If a mutation consistently yields interesting results, it is prioritized.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function scan_url(url):
  analyzer = ResponseSemanticAnalyzer()
  mutation_engine = PayloadMutationEngine()
  
  initial_response = get_response(url)
  analyzer.analyze(initial_response)
  
  for i in range(num_iterations):
    payload = mutation_engine.generate_payload(analyzer.data_types, analyzer.validation_rules)
    modified_url = inject_payload(url, payload)
    response = get_response(modified_url)
    
    feedback = analyze_response(response)
    
    mutation_engine.update_strategy(feedback)
    
    if feedback.vulnerability_detected:
      report_vulnerability(url, payload, feedback)
      break

```

**Innovation:** This system shifts the focus from brute-force fuzzing to intelligent payload generation. By understanding how the server interprets input, it can craft more effective and targeted attacks, potentially bypassing traditional security measures. The adaptive feedback loop allows the system to learn and improve over time, increasing its effectiveness. It moves beyond looking for simple escape character issues, to attempting to manipulate server logic with unexpected inputs.
