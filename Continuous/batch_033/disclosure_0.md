## Adaptive Job Prioritization via Predictive Resource Contention

**System Overview:**

This system extends the core concept of resource allocation based on job history by introducing *predictive* resource contention modeling. Instead of solely relying on past *completion* success/failure, the system analyzes historical job *overlap* and resource usage patterns to anticipate potential bottlenecks *before* scheduling. This allows for a more nuanced prioritization, not just favoring historically 'good' users/jobs, but intelligently distributing load to minimize overall system impact.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Resource Contention Profile (RCP) Generation:**
    *   Each resource type (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network Bandwidth) maintains a historical database of usage during job execution.
    *   For each time slice (e.g., 5-minute intervals), the system calculates a “contention score” for each resource type. This score represents the level of saturation. (Higher score = greater contention)
    *   RCPs are generated for each user account and for each job identifier (as in the provided patent).  These profiles track the historical contention *caused* by that user/job.
    *   RCPs are regularly updated (e.g., hourly, daily) to reflect changing usage patterns.

2.  **Job Scheduling Algorithm Enhancement:**
    *   The existing resource allocation score (based on job history completion) is *combined* with a "Contention Risk Score" (CRS).
    *   CRS is calculated *predictively* based on the RCPs of the requesting user/job *and* the current system load.
    *   CRS Formula (pseudocode):

        ```
        CRS = α * User_RCP_Score + β * Job_RCP_Score + γ * Current_System_Load
        ```

        *   `α`, `β`, `γ` are configurable weights.
        *   `User_RCP_Score`: Average historical contention caused by this user.
        *   `Job_RCP_Score`: Average historical contention caused by this specific job.
        *   `Current_System_Load`: A real-time measure of overall resource utilization.
    *   The combined score (Resource Allocation Score + CRS) is used to determine job priority and allocated resources.  Lower scores have higher priority.

3.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**
    *   A feedback loop continuously adjusts the weights `α`, `β`, and `γ` based on observed system performance.
    *   If the system experiences increased contention despite prioritization, the weights for `α` and `β` are increased, giving more weight to historical contention.
    *   If the system is underutilized, the weights for `α` and `β` are decreased, allowing more jobs to be scheduled.

4.  **Resource 'Shadowing' for Predictive Modeling:**

    *   During periods of low system load, a small percentage of submitted jobs are run in “shadow mode” using a separate set of resources. This is for accurate contention modelling only.
    *   These shadow jobs do not affect production workloads.
    *   Resource usage data from shadow jobs is used to refine the RCPs and improve the accuracy of the CRS predictions.

5. **API Endpoint Extension:**

   *   A new API endpoint `/contention_profile/{user_id}` allows monitoring of a user's historical contention contribution.
   *   This enables administrators to identify users/jobs that consistently create bottlenecks.

**Data Structures:**

*   `ResourceContentionProfile`: A time-series database storing historical resource usage data (CPU, Memory, I/O, Network) associated with users and jobs.
*   `ContentionRiskScore`: A floating-point value representing the predicted risk of contention for a given job.
*   `WeightedScore`: A composite score derived from the Resource Allocation Score and ContentionRiskScore.

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires sufficient storage for historical resource usage data.
*   Benefits from high-speed data processing capabilities for real-time contention prediction.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced system contention and improved overall performance.
*   More equitable resource allocation.
*   Proactive identification of problematic users/jobs.
*   Enhanced scalability and stability.
