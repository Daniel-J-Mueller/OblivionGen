## Modular Payload & Boom System - Aerial Vehicle

**Concept:** Expand the boom functionality beyond housing propulsion. Integrate a standardized payload interface into the boom structure, allowing for rapid reconfiguration of aerial vehicle capabilities.

**Specifications:**

*   **Boom Structure:** Redesign booms to be multi-faceted, hexagonal cross-section. Internal space divided into sections: Propulsion housing, Payload bay, and Structural reinforcement.
*   **Payload Interface:** Develop a universal payload mounting system (UPMS) â€“ a standardized set of electrical and mechanical connectors integrated into the boom's payload bay.  UPMS specs:
    *   Power: 12V, 24V, 48V DC options, max 1kW per boom.
    *   Data:  Ethernet (1Gbps), CAN bus, Serial (RS232/485).
    *   Mechanical:  Quick-release locking mechanism with integrated safety interlocks.  Payload mass limit: 5kg per boom.
    *   Dimensions: Standardized payload enclosure volume: 200mm x 100mm x 50mm.
*   **Modular Payload Modules:** Design a library of rapidly swappable payload modules utilizing the UPMS:
    *   **High-Resolution Camera Module:**  Gimbal stabilized 4K camera with zoom.
    *   **Lidar Module:**  Short/Long range lidar for mapping/obstacle avoidance.
    *   **Sensor Pod:**  Combined environmental sensor suite (temperature, humidity, pressure, air quality).
    *   **Speaker/Intercom Module:**  High-power speaker and two-way intercom.
    *   **Delivery Module:**  Small cargo bay with automated release mechanism.
    *   **Emergency Beacon Module:**  High-intensity strobe and emergency communication radio.
*   **Software Integration:** Develop flight control software integration to:
    *   Automatically detect connected payload modules.
    *   Provide a user interface for controlling payload functions.
    *   Implement safety checks to prevent conflicting payload operations.
    *   Allow for custom payload scripting and integration.
*   **Boom Redundancy:** Each boom will integrate a secondary, lower-power propulsion unit. If a primary propulsion unit fails, the secondary unit will automatically engage to maintain stability and allow for controlled descent or return-to-base.

**Pseudocode (Flight Control Logic - Payload Detection & Activation):**

```
//Initialization
PayloadDetected[0] = false
PayloadDetected[1] = false

//Loop
function CheckPayloadStatus():
    if(UPMS_Port_0_Connected()):
        PayloadDetected[0] = true
        PayloadType[0] = ReadPayloadType(UPMS_Port_0)
    else:
        PayloadDetected[0] = false

    if(UPMS_Port_1_Connected()):
        PayloadDetected[1] = true
        PayloadType[1] = ReadPayloadType(UPMS_Port_1)
    else:
        PayloadDetected[1] = false

function ActivatePayload(PayloadNumber, Function, Parameter):
    if PayloadNumber == 0 && PayloadDetected[0]:
        ExecutePayloadFunction(PayloadType[0], Function, Parameter)
    else if PayloadNumber == 1 && PayloadDetected[1]:
        ExecutePayloadFunction(PayloadType[1], Function, Parameter)
    else:
        Log("Payload not detected or invalid number")

//Example activation:
ActivatePayload(0, "StartRecording", "1080p") //Starts recording on module 0
```

**Materials:**

*   Boom Structure: Carbon Fiber Composite
*   UPMS Connectors: High-Conductivity Aluminum Alloy with Gold Plating
*   Payload Housings: Lightweight Polymer Blend (PEEK or similar)
