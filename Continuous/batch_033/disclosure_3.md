## Dynamic Data Stream Weaving

**Concept:** Extend the idempotent processing framework to enable real-time “weaving” of data streams based on evolving business rules *without* re-processing entire streams or requiring downtime.  The core idea is to treat checkpoint metadata not just as points for resuming processing, but as ‘knots’ in a dynamic graph representing the stream’s lineage.

**Specification:**

**1. Stream Graph Metadata Layer:**

*   Introduce a metadata layer atop the existing data stream. This layer maintains a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the stream’s history – points where the stream was split, joined, filtered, or transformed.
*   Each node in the DAG corresponds to a checkpoint. Metadata stored at each node includes:
    *   Checkpoint ID
    *   Timestamp
    *   Transformation/Filtering Rule applied at this checkpoint
    *   Input Stream IDs (if this checkpoint resulted from a merge)
    *   Output Stream IDs (if this checkpoint resulted in a split)
    *   Data Schema at this point in the stream
*   This graph is persisted in a high-throughput, low-latency key-value store (e.g., RocksDB, Cassandra) accessible to both stream processing workers and a dedicated "Stream Weaver" service.

**2. Stream Weaver Service:**

*   A separate service responsible for managing the stream graph and applying dynamic modifications.
*   Exposes an API for defining and applying "Weaving Rules." A Weaving Rule specifies:
    *   Target Stream ID
    *   Checkpoint ID to start weaving from (or “latest”)
    *   New Transformation/Filtering Rule to apply
    *   Optionally, a new output stream ID to divert the modified data.
*   The Stream Weaver service does *not* directly process data. It only updates the stream graph metadata and instructs processing workers.

**3. Modified Stream Processing Worker:**

*   Upon assignment of a partition, the worker retrieves the stream graph metadata for that partition.
*   Before processing any data from a checkpoint, the worker queries the Stream Weaver service to check if any Weaving Rules apply to the current checkpoint ID.
*   If a Weaving Rule is found:
    *   The worker retrieves the new transformation/filtering rule from the Stream Weaver service.
    *   The worker applies the new rule to the data.
    *   If a new output stream ID is specified, the worker sends the modified data to the new stream *in addition* to the original stream.  (This allows for A/B testing or gradual rollouts).
    *   The worker updates the checkpoint metadata with the applied Weaving Rule ID for auditing and rollback purposes.
*   If no Weaving Rule is found, the worker processes the data as usual.

**Pseudocode (Stream Processing Worker):**

```
function processPartition(partitionId):
  graphMetadata = getStreamGraphMetadata(partitionId)
  currentCheckpoint = getLatestCheckpoint(graphMetadata)

  while (data = getDataFromCheckpoint(currentCheckpoint)):
    weavingRule = getWeavingRule(currentCheckpoint)

    if (weavingRule != null):
      modifiedData = applyTransformation(data, weavingRule)
      sendData(modifiedData, weavingRule.outputStreamId)
      sendData(data, originalStreamId) //Optional: send to original stream too
      updateCheckpointMetadata(currentCheckpoint, weavingRule.id)
    else:
      sendData(data, originalStreamId)

    currentCheckpoint = nextCheckpoint(currentCheckpoint)
```

**4. Rollback Mechanism:**

*   Checkpoint metadata now includes information about applied Weaving Rules.
*   To rollback to a previous state, the Stream Weaver service can instruct processing workers to ignore Weaving Rules applied *after* a specific checkpoint ID.  Workers can effectively "rewind" the stream's processing.

**Benefits:**

*   **Real-time Adaptability:**  Modify data streams on the fly without downtime or full re-processing.
*   **A/B Testing & Gradual Rollouts:** Easily divert modified data to separate streams for testing or controlled release.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Rollback to previous states in case of errors.
*   **Improved Observability:** Track the lineage of data through the stream using the graph metadata.
