## Adaptive Swarm Health Monitoring & Predictive Failure Transfer

**Concept:** Extend the UAV’s prognostics beyond individual vehicle health to encompass a dynamically shifting ‘swarm health’ metric, leveraging data from *all* connected UAVs. This enables predictive failure *transfer* – proactively adjusting mission parameters for a UAV *before* a failure occurs by offloading tasks or preemptively rerouting based on observed degradation in similar units within the swarm.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Aggregation & Swarm Health Index (SHI):**

*   **Data Sources:**  Real-time sensor data streams (as described in the source patent) *plus*  high-level mission performance metrics (e.g., remaining battery life, current speed/altitude, payload weight, encountered wind conditions) from *all* connected UAVs within a defined operational radius.
*   **Data Transmission:** Secure, low-latency communication protocol (e.g., customized 5G/6G mesh network, satellite link) for continuous data exchange.
*   **SHI Calculation:** A weighted algorithm combines sensor data & performance metrics, generating a ‘Swarm Health Index’ (SHI) for each subsystem type (e.g., propulsion, avionics, power). Weights are dynamically adjusted based on environmental factors, mission phase, and historical failure data.  Example:
    ```
    SHI_Propulsion = (Weight_SensorA * SensorA_Value) + (Weight_SensorB * SensorB_Value) + (Weight_Performance * Performance_Metric)
    ```
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Machine learning models (trained on historical data) continuously monitor SHI values for each subsystem, identifying anomalies indicative of potential failures *across the swarm*. 

**2. Predictive Failure Transfer & Mission Adaptation:**

*   **Failure Propagation Model:** A Bayesian Network (or similar probabilistic model) predicts the likelihood of a specific subsystem failing on a given UAV based on the SHI values of *other* UAVs experiencing similar stress.  Factors considered: 
    *   Similarity of operating conditions.
    *   UAV age/flight hours.
    *   Maintenance history.
    *   Component manufacturing batch.
*   **Proactive Task Offloading:** If a UAV is predicted to experience a subsystem failure within a defined timeframe, the system identifies critical tasks that can be offloaded to other UAVs with healthy subsystems.  Criteria for task selection:
    *   Task priority.
    *   Remaining operational capacity of other UAVs.
    *   Communication bandwidth.
*   **Dynamic Rerouting:**  Rerouting algorithms adjust flight paths for individual UAVs to minimize stress on potentially failing subsystems and/or avoid hazardous conditions.
*   **Mission Parameter Adjustment:**  Automated adjustment of mission parameters (e.g., speed, altitude, payload weight) to reduce stress on individual UAVs and/or the swarm as a whole.
*   **Preemptive Landing:** In cases where a failure is imminent and cannot be mitigated, the system initiates a controlled landing of the affected UAV.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Onboard Prognostics Module (Enhanced):**  Expanded to include swarm data processing, predictive failure modeling, and task offloading/rerouting logic.
*   **Ground Control Station (GCS):**  Provides a centralized view of swarm health, mission status, and potential failures.  Allows operators to monitor system performance and intervene if necessary.
*   **Cloud-Based Data Storage & Analytics:**  Stores historical data for model training, performance analysis, and long-term trend identification. Enables remote model updates and system improvements.

**4. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication modules on each UAV.
*   Increased onboard processing power to support swarm data analysis.
*   Redundant power supplies and cooling systems.
*   Enhanced sensor suites for monitoring environmental conditions and subsystem performance.
