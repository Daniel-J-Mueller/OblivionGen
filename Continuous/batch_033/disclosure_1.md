## Automated Event/Transaction 'Shadowing' & Predictive Authorization

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple event reminders & transaction authorizations to create a system that *learns* user behavior around events and transactions, proactively preparing for future interactions *before* the user initiates them. This utilizes predictive analytics to minimize friction and enhance security.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Aggregation Module:**
    *   Continuously logs all interactions within the existing system: scheduling requests, reminder deliveries, transaction requests, authorizations, contact information used.
    *   Captures timestamps, message content (anonymized/hashed for privacy), communication channel details, and user responses (positive/negative confirmations, failed authorizations).
    *   Integrates with external data sources (optional, with user consent): calendar data, location services, purchase history (anonymized).

*   **Behavioral Modeling Engine:**
    *   Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks) to identify patterns in user behavior.
    *   Models user preferences: preferred communication times, typical event durations, frequently used third parties, average transaction amounts, typical authorization methods.
    *   Creates ‘behavioral profiles’ for each user, continuously updated with new data.

*   **Predictive Authorization Module:**
    *   When a predicted event or transaction is likely to occur (based on the behavioral model), the system initiates a pre-authorization sequence.
    *   Sends a subtle 'pre-check' message to the user (e.g., "Just confirming your usual transaction settings are up-to-date?").
    *   Initiates a background authorization request (low-priority) with the payment processor or relevant third party.
    *   If pre-authorization is successful, the system prepares for the transaction. If not, it prompts the user for updated information.

*   **Dynamic Communication Channel Selection:**
    *   Based on user behavior and context, the system dynamically selects the most appropriate communication channel for each interaction (SMS, email, push notification, in-app message).
    *   Prioritizes channels that have historically yielded the highest response rates and fastest authorization times.

*   **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Continuously monitors user behavior for deviations from the established baseline.
    *   Flags suspicious activity (e.g., unusually large transactions, transactions with unfamiliar parties, attempts to access the system from unfamiliar locations) for review.

**Pseudocode – Predictive Authorization Sequence:**

```
FUNCTION predictAndPreAuthorize(userID):
  behavioralProfile = getBehavioralProfile(userID)
  predictedEvent = predictNextEvent(behavioralProfile)
  IF predictedEvent IS likely:
    preCheckMessage = generatePreCheckMessage(predictedEvent)
    sendPreCheckMessage(userID, preCheckMessage)
    preAuthorizationRequest = createPreAuthorizationRequest(predictedEvent)
    preAuthorizationResult = sendPreAuthorizationRequest(preAuthorizationRequest)
    IF preAuthorizationResult == SUCCESS:
      markEventAsPreAuthorized(predictedEvent)
    ELSE:
      promptUserForUpdatedInfo(userID)
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond reactive authorizations to *proactive* preparation. By learning user behavior, the system anticipates needs, minimizes friction, and enhances security. It is not simply reminding or authorizing, but *preparing* for interactions before they are initiated. The dynamic communication channel selection adds another layer of user experience improvement, and the anomaly detection component bolsters security.
