## Dynamic Search Result ‘Ecosystems’

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple saved searches to create persistent ‘ecosystems’ of search results that evolve based on user interaction *and* external data sources. Instead of merely saving results, the system learns user intent and proactively suggests related information.

**Specs:**

1.  **Ecosystem Creation:**  Users can designate a set of saved searches as an “Ecosystem.”  This is a metadata flag, not a structural change to the saved search itself.

2.  **Contextual Data Integration:** Each Ecosystem is associated with a configurable set of external data feeds (e.g., RSS feeds, Twitter streams, news APIs related to keywords in the saved searches).

3.  **Dynamic Result Blending:** The system combines results from the saved searches *and* the external data feeds.  A weighting algorithm determines the prominence of each source.  This algorithm is user-configurable, with presets for different ‘Ecosystem types’ (e.g., ‘News Monitoring’, ‘Project Research’, ‘Competitive Analysis’).

4.  **Intent Modeling:**  The system tracks user interactions (clicks, saves within the ecosystem, deletions, time spent viewing) to refine the intent model.  This model informs the weighting algorithm and also suggests *new* search queries to add to the Ecosystem.

5.  **Visual Representation:** Ecosystems are presented as interactive graph/network views.  Saved searches are nodes, external data feeds are nodes, and edges represent the relationships between them (e.g., “This news article is relevant to this saved search”).  Users can explore the connections and add/remove nodes.

6.  **Automated ‘Ecosystem Growth’:**  An option to enable ‘auto-growth’.  When enabled, the system will periodically suggest new search queries or data feeds to add to the Ecosystem, based on the intent model and current trends.  A confidence score is provided for each suggestion.

**Pseudocode (Ecosystem Update Loop):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateEcosystem(ecosystemID, currentQuery, userInteractionData, externalData)

    // 1. Fetch Saved Searches associated with ecosystemID

    // 2. Execute Saved Searches

    // 3. Fetch Data from externalData sources

    // 4. Apply Intent Model to weight search results & external data.
    //    (Intent Model factors in userInteractionData)

    // 5. Combine Weighted Results.

    // 6. If auto-growth is enabled:
    //     a. Generate candidate new search queries (using keyword expansion, semantic analysis)
    //     b. Evaluate candidates based on relevance to existing searches & trending data
    //     c. Suggest top candidates to user (with confidence scores)

    // 7. Return Combined Results
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires a scalable search index (e.g., Elasticsearch, Solr).
*   Needs an event queue to handle user interaction data.
*   The intent model could be implemented using machine learning techniques (e.g., topic modeling, natural language processing).
*   Frontend should support interactive graph visualizations (e.g., using D3.js, vis.js).
