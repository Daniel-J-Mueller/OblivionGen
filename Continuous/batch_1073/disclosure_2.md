## Dynamic Data Masking with Per-User Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend the secure proxy fleet to offer dynamic data masking *before* encryption, tailoring the visible data to each authenticated user accessing it. This isn't just about hiding sensitive fields; it's about presenting a customized view of the data based on roles, permissions, and potentially even contextual factors (time of day, location, etc.).

**Specifications:**

**1. Policy Definition & Storage:**

*   **Policy Language:** A declarative policy language (YAML preferred) defining masking rules. Rules specify fields to mask, masking methods (redaction, substitution, generalization, shuffling), and conditions for applying the mask.
*   **Policy Storage:** A distributed key-value store (e.g., etcd, Consul) accessible by the secure proxy fleet, storing policies indexed by backend service, user ID (or role), and potentially other contextual attributes.
*   **Policy Update Mechanism:**  A real-time policy update mechanism using websockets or server-sent events to propagate changes to all proxy nodes without service disruption.

**2. Proxy Modification:**

*   **Authentication Module:** Integrate an authentication module enabling the proxy to verify user identity and retrieve associated policies. Support for multiple authentication methods (OAuth, SAML, API Keys).
*   **Data Inspection & Classification:** Implement a lightweight data classification engine within the proxy, capable of identifying sensitive data types (PII, financial data, health records) based on configurable patterns and heuristics.
*   **Dynamic Masking Engine:**  A core component responsible for applying masking rules to data payloads. It should support various masking techniques:
    *   **Redaction:** Replace sensitive data with a fixed string (e.g., "***").
    *   **Substitution:** Replace sensitive data with a placeholder value (e.g., a randomly generated ID).
    *   **Generalization:** Reduce the precision of sensitive data (e.g., replace a specific date with a month/year).
    *   **Shuffling:** Randomly shuffle the order of characters within a sensitive field.
*   **Post-Masking Encryption:** After masking, the data is encrypted as per the existing patentâ€™s mechanism.  Ensure the masking process doesn't interfere with the encryption.

**3. Workflow:**

```pseudocode
On Request Received:
    Authenticate User
    Fetch User's Policies (based on backend service)
    Inspect Data Payload
    For each sensitive data field:
        If policy applies:
            Apply masking rule
    Encrypt Masked Data
    Transmit Encrypted Data
```

**4. API Extensions:**

*   **Policy Management API:** An API allowing administrators to create, update, and delete policies.
*   **Data Classification API:**  An API allowing administrators to define and customize data classification rules.

**5. Monitoring & Logging:**

*   **Masking Event Logging:** Log all masking events, including the user, policy applied, field masked, and masking method.
*   **Performance Metrics:** Monitor the performance of the masking engine (latency, throughput).

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed policies and data classification rules.
*   **Horizontal Scaling:**  Distribute the proxy fleet across multiple servers.
*   **Asynchronous Masking:** For large payloads, consider performing masking asynchronously to avoid blocking the request.
