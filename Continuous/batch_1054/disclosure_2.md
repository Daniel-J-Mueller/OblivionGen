## Automated Directory Federation & Transient Domain Joining

**Concept:** Extend the managed directory service to not just *create* directories, but dynamically *federate* them with existing, potentially transient, domains – enabling seamless, short-lived access for remote resources without permanent domain joining.  Imagine a scenario where a contractor needs access to resources for a single day – this facilitates that without administrative overhead.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component:**  Federation Manager Module (FMM) – integrated into the existing Managed Directory Service.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `FederationRecord`:  Contains:
        *   `SourceDirectoryID`: ID of the managed directory.
        *   `TargetDomainFQDN`: FQDN of the external domain to federate with.
        *   `TrustParameters`:  Authentication/Authorization details for establishing trust (e.g., Kerberos key exchange, pre-shared secrets, certificate pinning).  Configurable security levels.
        *   `Lifetime`: Duration of the federation (e.g., 4 hours, until revoked).
        *   `ResourceScope`:  List of resources within the target domain accessible via the federation.
        *   `State`:  Active, Pending, Revoked, Failed.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `CreateFederation(FederationRecord)`: Creates a new federation request.
    *   `RevokeFederation(FederationID)`:  Immediately terminates an existing federation.
    *   `GetFederationStatus(FederationID)`:  Returns the current status of a federation.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  A customer (via API or UI) initiates a federation request, specifying the target domain, lifetime, and resource scope.
    2.  The FMM validates the request and attempts to establish a secure trust relationship with the target domain (using the specified `TrustParameters`). This may involve certificate exchange, key negotiation, or other secure authentication methods.
    3.  Upon successful trust establishment, the FMM dynamically creates temporary computer objects within the target domain that are associated with the managed directory. These objects act as "bridgeheads" for accessing resources.
    4.  The FMM maintains the trust relationship for the specified `Lifetime`.  A background task monitors the trust and automatically revokes it upon expiration or failure.
    5.  When a resource within the isolated virtual network attempts to access a resource in the federated domain, the FMM intercepts the request and transparently authenticates it using the established trust relationship.
    6.  Upon revocation, all temporary computer objects are removed from the target domain, effectively terminating the trust relationship.

*   **Pseudocode (Trust Establishment):**

    ```
    function EstablishTrust(FederationRecord):
        // Attempt to connect to target domain using TrustParameters
        connection = ConnectToDomain(FederationRecord.TargetDomainFQDN, FederationRecord.TrustParameters)

        if connection == null:
            return false // Trust establishment failed

        // Negotiate Kerberos key exchange (example)
        key = NegotiateKerberosKey(connection)

        // Create temporary computer object in target domain
        tempObject = CreateTempComputerObject(connection, key, FederationRecord.ResourceScope)

        // Associate tempObject with managed directory
        Associate(tempObject, FederationRecord.SourceDirectoryID)

        return true // Trust established
    ```

*   **Scalability Considerations:** Implement a distributed trust management system to handle a large number of concurrent federations.  Utilize caching and load balancing to improve performance.
