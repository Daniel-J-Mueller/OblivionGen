## Dynamic Decoy Payload Generation & Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Instead of static decoy data, generate decoys dynamically based on observed query patterns and user behavior. Correlate decoy activation with behavioral anomalies for improved threat detection and incident response.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw query logs, API access patterns, user roles, data access timestamps.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Establish baseline behavioral profiles for users, applications, and data access patterns.
    *   Utilize machine learning algorithms (anomaly detection, time series analysis) to identify deviations from baseline behavior.
    *   Assign risk scores to detected anomalies based on severity and frequency.
*   **Output:** Anomaly reports with risk scores, identified behavioral patterns, and recommended actions.

**2. Dynamic Decoy Generator Module:**

*   **Input:** Anomaly reports from the Behavioral Profiler, metadata about the targeted data (table schema, data types, constraints), pre-defined decoy templates.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Based on the anomaly report, identify the most relevant data fields and associated user/application.
    *   Dynamically construct decoys that mirror the observed query pattern and data type.
    *   Inject the generated decoys into the data store (tables, APIs, etc.) in a controlled manner.
    *   Record all decoy insertions and associated metadata (timestamp, user, query, decoy ID).
*   **Output:** Generated decoys, decoy insertion logs.

**3. Correlation Engine Module:**

*   **Input:** Decoy insertion logs, query logs, system logs, network traffic logs.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Monitor for access attempts to the injected decoys.
    *   Correlate decoy access with other suspicious activities (e.g., unusual network traffic, privilege escalation attempts).
    *   Generate alerts based on the correlation results.
*   **Output:** Security alerts with detailed information about the detected threat.

**Pseudocode - Correlation Engine:**

```
FUNCTION CorrelateEvents(decoyAccessLog, queryLog, systemLog, networkLog)

  // Define correlation rules (example)
  RULE: DecoyAccess AND (PrivilegeEscalation OR SuspiciousNetworkTraffic) -> HighSeverityAlert

  // Extract relevant events from logs
  decoyAccessEvents = GetDecoyAccessEvents(decoyAccessLog)
  privilegeEscalationEvents = GetPrivilegeEscalationEvents(systemLog)
  suspiciousNetworkEvents = GetSuspiciousNetworkEvents(networkLog)

  // Evaluate correlation rules
  FOR EACH decoyAccessEvent IN decoyAccessEvent
    FOR EACH privilegeEscalationEvent IN privilegeEscalationEvent
      IF RuleMatches(decoyAccessEvent, privilegeEscalationEvent, RULE_1)
        GenerateAlert(HighSeverityAlert, details)
    FOR EACH suspiciousNetworkEvent IN suspiciousNetworkEvent
      IF RuleMatches(decoyAccessEvent, suspiciousNetworkEvent, RULE_2)
        GenerateAlert(MediumSeverityAlert, details)

END FUNCTION
```

**Data Store Considerations:**

*   Decoy data should be stored in a separate, secure location to prevent accidental exposure.
*   Decoy data should be regularly rotated and updated to maintain effectiveness.
*   A robust auditing mechanism should be in place to track all decoy insertions, access attempts, and associated events.
