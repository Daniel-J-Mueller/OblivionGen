## Adaptive Proactive Support System

**Concept:** Extend the agent availability system to *proactively* offer assistance based on user behavior and predicted needs, seamlessly integrating into the user interface *before* a contact request is initiated. This moves beyond reactive support requests to anticipate issues and provide contextual help.

**Specs:**

*   **Behavioral Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: User interaction data (mouse movements, keystrokes, page scrolling, time spent on elements, data entered into forms, errors encountered, etc.).
    *   Processing: Machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, decision trees) trained to identify patterns indicative of user frustration, confusion, or potential roadblocks.
    *   Output:  "Need Score" – a numerical value representing the likelihood the user requires assistance.
*   **Contextual Awareness Engine:**
    *   Input: Current webpage/application content, user profile data, historical support interactions.
    *   Processing: Semantic analysis of content to determine the user’s current task. Cross-referencing with user profile to identify relevant preferences/settings.
    *   Output:  Contextual tags - keywords describing the user's current activity and potential areas of difficulty.
*   **Proactive Assistance Interface:**
    *   Trigger:  Need Score exceeds a configurable threshold *and* a relevant contextual tag is identified.
    *   Display: Non-intrusive overlay or widget within the user interface. (Avoid pop-ups).  Examples:
        *   Helpful hint/tip related to the current task.
        *   Direct link to relevant documentation or FAQ.
        *   One-click option to initiate a chat with a support agent.
    *   Adaptation: The assistance offered dynamically adjusts based on user interactions with the interface.  (e.g., If the user clicks the help link, the system assumes the issue is unresolved and offers more advanced options.)
*   **Agent Routing Logic:**
    *   Prioritization: Users flagged by the system as requiring proactive assistance are given priority in the agent queue.
    *   Skill Matching: Route the user to an agent with expertise relevant to the identified context and issue. (Uses contextual tags).
    *   Pre-Chat Data: Provide the agent with the user’s behavioral data, context tags, and a summary of the predicted issue *before* the chat begins.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Microservices: Implement each module (Behavioral Analysis, Contextual Awareness, Agent Routing) as an independent microservice.
    *   API Integration: Expose APIs for integration with existing CRM, help desk, and web/application platforms.
    *   Data Storage: Utilize a combination of real-time data streams (e.g., Kafka) and persistent data stores (e.g., NoSQL databases) to handle high volumes of data.

**Pseudocode (Behavioral Analysis Module):**

```
function analyzeUserBehavior(interactionData):
  // Load pre-trained machine learning model
  model = loadModel("user_behavior_model.h5")

  // Extract features from interactionData (mouse movements, keystrokes, etc.)
  features = extractFeatures(interactionData)

  // Predict "Need Score" using the model
  needScore = model.predict(features)

  return needScore
```
