## Dynamic Bootstrap Chaining with Capability-Based Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the bootstrap process to dynamically assemble a chain of bootstrap modules based on host system capabilities *and* a user-defined 'policy' expressed as desired software features. This moves beyond simply loading a pre-defined package.

**Specs:**

*   **Bootstrap Module Registry:** A centralized (or distributed) registry of 'micro-bootstrap' modules. Each module is self-describing, specifying:
    *   Required hardware/software capabilities.
    *   Functionality provided (e.g., specific driver installation, security feature enablement, performance optimization).
    *   Dependencies on other modules.
    *   A cost/license associated with usage (potentially impacting user policy).
*   **Policy Engine:** A user-facing interface or API to define desired system characteristics. Policies are expressed as feature requests (e.g., "Enable advanced graphics rendering," "Maximize battery life," "Implement end-to-end encryption‚Äù). These are translated into a set of required capabilities.
*   **Dynamic Chain Assembler:** A component that:
    1.  Queries the host system for available capabilities.
    2.  Receives the user-defined policy (translated into capability requirements).
    3.  Consults the Bootstrap Module Registry.
    4.  Constructs an optimal chain of modules based on:
        *   Meeting the policy requirements.
        *   Utilizing available capabilities.
        *   Minimizing cost/license fees.
        *   Dependency resolution.
*   **Attestation & Verification:** Before execution, each module in the chain *must* cryptographically attest to its integrity and claimed capabilities. The host system verifies the attestation before allowing execution.
*   **Adaptive Execution:** The chain can be dynamically adjusted based on runtime conditions. For example, if a module fails, the assembler attempts to find an alternative module providing similar functionality.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Chain Assembler):**

```
function assembleBootstrapChain(hostCapabilities, userPolicy):
  requiredCapabilities = translatePolicyToCapabilities(userPolicy)
  candidateModules = queryBootstrapRegistry(requiredCapabilities)
  sortedModules = sortModulesByCostAndPerformance(candidateModules)
  chain = []
  dependenciesResolved = false

  while sortedModules is not empty and dependenciesResolved is false:
    module = sortedModules.pop(0)
    if module.dependencies are met by chain:
      chain.append(module)
      if module is the last dependency for remaining modules:
        dependenciesResolved = true
    else:
      #Attempt to find dependency in the remaining modules
      dependencyFound = false
      for remainingModule in remainingModules:
        if remainingModule matches a dependency in module:
            chain.append(remainingModule)
            #continue processing with updated chain
            break

  if chain is empty:
    return Error("No suitable bootstrap chain found")

  return chain
```

**Innovation:**

This moves beyond static bootstrap packages to a fluid, policy-driven system. It allows for highly customized system configurations and enables new revenue streams through module licensing. The capability-based attestation provides a robust security model. The adaptive execution provides a degree of resilience and self-healing.
