## Adaptive Proximity-Based Failover Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the failover region assessment to incorporate real-time network condition analysis *between* primary and potential failover regions, dynamically adjusting failover priorities based on observed latency, packet loss, and bandwidth.  Rather than solely relying on pre-defined geographic proximity and capacity metrics, prioritize failover targets exhibiting optimal *current* network connectivity.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Network Condition Monitoring Agent:** Deploy lightweight agents on primary region infrastructure.  These agents continuously monitor network metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss, bandwidth) to a set of pre-defined potential failover regions.  Monitoring utilizes active probing (ICMP, TCP SYN pings) and passive telemetry (BGP routing updates).

2.  **Dynamic Network Graph Construction:** Agents transmit collected metrics to a central orchestration service. The service constructs a dynamic network graph, representing the network connectivity between primary regions and potential failover regions.  Node weight corresponds to a composite score derived from observed network metrics (lower latency, lower packet loss, higher bandwidth = higher weight).

3.  **Weighted Failover Decision Algorithm:**  Modify the existing failover selection logic to incorporate the network graph weight.
    *   Assign a baseline weight to each potential failover region based on pre-defined geographic proximity and capacity (as in the original patent).
    *   Multiply the baseline weight by the current network graph weight.
    *   Normalize the weighted scores across all potential failover regions.
    *   Select the failover target with the highest normalized score.

    Pseudocode:

    ```
    function selectFailoverTarget(primaryRegion, potentialFailoverRegions) {
      baselineWeights = calculateBaselineWeights(potentialFailoverRegions)
      networkWeights = getNetworkWeights(primaryRegion, potentialFailoverRegions) // from network monitoring
      weightedScores = []
      for each region in potentialFailoverRegions {
        weightedScore = baselineWeights[region] * networkWeights[region]
        weightedScores.add(weightedScore)
      }
      normalizedScores = normalize(weightedScores) // scale to 0-1 range
      bestFailoverRegion = getRegionWithMaxScore(normalizedScores)
      return bestFailoverRegion
    }
    ```

4.  **Automated Network Path Optimization:**  If network conditions degrade significantly between the primary region and the currently selected failover target, the orchestration service automatically initiates path optimization attempts.  This could involve:
    *   Requesting bandwidth allocation from network providers.
    *   Triggering routing policy changes to direct traffic along more optimal paths.
    *   Activating redundant network links.

5.  **Predictive Failover Modeling:**  Implement a machine learning model to predict potential network disruptions based on historical network data and real-time network telemetry.  Proactively adjust failover priorities based on predicted disruptions.

6.  **Cross-Region Health Checks:** Extend the existing regional readiness checks to include cross-region network latency and bandwidth tests. This verifies the quality of the network connection *before* a failover event occurs.

7.  **API for Network Metric Injection:** Provide a public API allowing external systems (e.g., network management tools) to inject custom network metrics into the orchestration service.

**Data Structures:**

*   `NetworkGraphNode`: { regionId: String, latency: Float, packetLoss: Float, bandwidth: Float, weight: Float }
*   `NetworkGraph`: { nodes: [NetworkGraphNode], edges: [(String, String)] }
*   `FailoverConfiguration`: { primaryRegion: String, potentialFailoverRegions: [String], weights: { region: Float } }

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   Utilize a distributed data store (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB) to store network metrics and failover configurations.
*   Deploy the orchestration service across multiple availability zones for high availability.
*   Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
