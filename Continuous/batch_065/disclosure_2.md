## Dynamic Transaction Prioritization & Shadow Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the patent's premise of graceful shutdown/reboot by introducing dynamic transaction prioritization *and* a shadow buffering system to minimize data loss and ensure critical operations complete even during power transitions. This moves beyond simply *preventing* new transactions to *managing* existing ones and safeguarding their data.

**Specs:**

**1. Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:** Transaction metadata (source, destination, type – read/write, data size, priority flag). Priority flags are assigned by the initiating device, with levels: Critical, High, Normal, Low.  The system defaults to Normal if no flag is set.
*   **Logic:** The Prioritization Engine operates *before* a transaction reaches the target device. It assesses the priority flag *and* the state of the target device (normal operation, pre-shutdown, rebooting).
    *   **Normal Operation:** Transactions proceed as normal.
    *   **Pre-Shutdown/Rebooting:**
        *   **Critical Transactions:**  Immediately allowed to complete. Interrupts other transactions if necessary.  A 'Critical' designation implies a guaranteed completion within a maximum defined latency.
        *   **High Transactions:**  Allowed to complete after any currently executing Critical transactions.
        *   **Normal/Low Transactions:**  Queued for potential completion or flagged for rollback (see Shadow Buffering).
*   **Output:** Prioritized transaction stream.  Signals to the Controller (from the original patent) to allow/block transactions.

**2. Shadow Buffering System:**

*   **Mechanism:** A dedicated high-speed buffer (SRAM or similar) associated with each target device. This buffer mirrors the device’s critical data regions.
*   **Operation:**
    *   **Writes:**  All write transactions are initially directed to the shadow buffer.
    *   **Verification & Commit:** A background process periodically flushes the shadow buffer to the target device's main memory *only* if the device is in normal operation.  If a power transition is initiated *before* a flush, the system flags the transactions in the shadow buffer as “pending”.
    *   **Rollback/Recovery:**  During shutdown/reboot:
        *   **Critical/High Pending Transactions:** Attempt to complete these transactions using the data in the shadow buffer. Prioritize based on original timestamps.
        *   **Normal/Low Pending Transactions:**  Roll back these transactions, discarding the data in the shadow buffer.  An optional mechanism could provide a 'last known state' to the initiating device.
*   **Buffer Management:** Utilize a Least Recently Used (LRU) or similar caching algorithm to manage the shadow buffer’s limited space.

**3. Controller Integration:**

*   The existing Controller (from the patent) is modified to interact with the Prioritization Engine and the Shadow Buffering System.
*   Controller Logic:
    *   Receive shutdown/reboot indication.
    *   Signal the Prioritization Engine to begin managing transactions.
    *   Initiate Shadow Buffer flush/rollback processes.
    *   Transmit appropriate messages to the interconnect fabric to inform initiating devices of transaction status (completed, rolled back, pending).

**Pseudocode (Prioritization Engine):**

```
function prioritizeTransaction(transaction):
  priority = transaction.priorityFlag
  deviceState = getDeviceState()

  if deviceState == "Normal":
    return true // Allow transaction
  elif deviceState == "PreShutdown" or deviceState == "Rebooting":
    if priority == "Critical":
      interruptCurrentTransaction() // If needed
      return true
    elif priority == "High":
      if currentTransactionComplete():
        return true
      else:
        queueTransaction(transaction) //Hold until current complete
        return false
    elif priority == "Normal" or priority == "Low":
      return false //Block transaction
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Minimized data loss during power transitions.
*   Enhanced system stability and reliability.
*   Improved responsiveness of critical applications.
*   Greater flexibility in managing system resources.
