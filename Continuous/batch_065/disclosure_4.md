## Delegated Resource Orchestration with Dynamic Policy Injection

**Concept:** Extend the delegation profile concept to encompass not just *what* actions a delegated entity can perform, but *how* those actions are performed, leveraging a dynamic policy injection system for real-time resource orchestration. This goes beyond simple permissioning to control *execution* context.

**Specs:**

**1. Policy Definition Language (PDL):**

*   **Structure:** YAML-based. Defines resource access *and* operational parameters.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   `resource_type`:  (string) Identifies the type of resource (e.g., database, compute instance, API endpoint).
    *   `action`: (string)  Specific operation (e.g., `read`, `write`, `execute`).
    *   `parameters`: (dictionary) Operational constraints. Examples:
        *   `rate_limit`: Requests per minute.
        *   `priority`:  Execution priority level.
        *   `data_masking`:  Rules for data redaction.
        *   `allowed_regions`:  Geographic restrictions.
        *   `max_execution_time`:  Time limit for the action.
    *   `conditions`: (list of logical expressions)  Triggers for policy activation based on request attributes (e.g., user role, time of day, data sensitivity).
*   **Example:**

```yaml
resource_type: database
action: read
parameters:
  rate_limit: 100
  data_masking:
    fields: [credit_card_number, ssn]
conditions:
  - user_role: "standard"
  - time_of_day: "09:00-17:00"
```

**2. Dynamic Policy Injection Service (DPIS):**

*   **Function:** Intercepts requests for delegated resources. Evaluates relevant policies based on request context and injects operational parameters into the resource access workflow.
*   **Architecture:** Microservice with the following components:
    *   *Policy Repository*: Stores and manages PDL policies.
    *   *Context Extractor*: Extracts relevant request attributes (user ID, time, data sensitivity).
    *   *Policy Evaluator*: Applies policies to the extracted context.
    *   *Parameter Injector*: Modifies the request with operational parameters.
*   **API:**
    *   `evaluatePolicy(requestContext: Dictionary): Dictionary`: Returns a dictionary of injected parameters.

**3. Delegation Profile Extension:**

*   Modify existing delegation profile to include:
    *   `policy_set_id`:  Identifier for a specific set of policies in the Policy Repository.
    *   `policy_override_flag`: Boolean flag allowing delegated entities to temporarily override injected parameters (subject to authorization rules).

**4. Workflow:**

1.  User/Service requests access to a resource on behalf of a delegated entity.
2.  Request is intercepted by the DPIS.
3.  DPIS retrieves the delegation profile associated with the request.
4.  DPIS retrieves the `policy_set_id` from the delegation profile and loads the corresponding policies.
5.  DPIS extracts request context and evaluates applicable policies.
6.  DPIS injects operational parameters into the request.
7.  Modified request is forwarded to the resource.
8.  Resource processes request with injected parameters.

**Pseudocode (DPIS - `evaluatePolicy` function):**

```python
def evaluatePolicy(requestContext):
    delegationProfile = getDelegationProfile(requestContext)
    policySetId = delegationProfile.policy_set_id
    policies = getPolicies(policySetId)
    injectedParameters = {}

    for policy in policies:
        if policy.conditions_met(requestContext):
            injectedParameters.update(policy.parameters)

    return injectedParameters
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond simple permissioning to control *how* delegated tasks are executed, providing a much finer-grained level of control and security. This enables dynamic adaptation to changing conditions and ensures consistent resource governance. It's about defining execution *rules* alongside access *rights*.
