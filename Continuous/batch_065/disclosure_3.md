**Dynamic Substrate Mesh with Intent-Based Routing**

**Concept:** Extend the provider substrate extension concept to a dynamically configurable mesh network *within* the customer’s facility, allowing for intelligent traffic steering based on application intent, rather than purely network topology. This moves beyond simple extension into a truly adaptive and intelligent network fabric.

**Specifications:**

*   **Mesh Node Definition:**  Each “provider substrate extension” node, as defined in the source patent, becomes a mesh node. These nodes are equipped with advanced, programmable data plane functionality (e.g., P4-capable ASICs or software-defined switching).
*   **Intent API:**  Expose an API allowing customers (or applications on their behalf) to define *intent*.  Intent could be expressed as:
    *   “Route all traffic for application ‘X’ with a maximum latency of ‘Y’ milliseconds.”
    *   “Prioritize traffic for voice/video conferencing over other data traffic.”
    *   “Ensure all traffic related to PCI-DSS compliance remains within a designated segment of the mesh.”
*   **Control Plane Orchestration:**  A central control plane orchestrator (running within the cloud provider network) translates intent into specific forwarding rules and configurations for each mesh node. This could utilize a centralized controller (e.g., ONOS, Ryu) or a distributed consensus mechanism.
*   **Real-time Path Computation:**  The control plane constantly monitors the performance of paths between mesh nodes (latency, bandwidth, packet loss).  It dynamically adjusts forwarding rules to ensure intent is met, even in the face of network congestion or failures. Algorithms like Dijkstra’s or Bellman-Ford could be used, but optimized for rapid recalculation.
*   **Automated Remediation:** If a path cannot meet the defined intent (e.g., due to a link failure), the system automatically attempts to find an alternate path or triggers a notification to the network administrator.
*   **Secure Tunnel Extension:** The existing secure tunnel is extended to provide a secure control channel between the cloud provider’s control plane and each mesh node. This ensures that only authorized configurations can be applied.
*   **Multi-Tenancy and Isolation:** The system supports multi-tenancy, allowing different customers to share the same mesh infrastructure without compromising security or performance. Virtual networks and access control lists are used to isolate traffic.
* **Automated ‘Stitching’**: The system automatically configures and maintains peering relationships between the mesh nodes and the customer's existing network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls).

**Pseudocode (Control Plane Orchestration):**

```
function handleIntentRequest(intent):
  paths = findPossiblePaths(intent.source, intent.destination)
  bestPath = selectBestPath(paths, intent.latencyRequirement, intent.bandwidthRequirement)
  if bestPath == null:
    log("No path found meeting requirements")
    return error
  
  for node in bestPath:
    configureNode(node, bestPath) #Push forwarding rules to the node
  
  monitorPath(bestPath) #Continuously monitor path performance
  
function monitorPath(path):
  while(true):
    performanceData = collectPerformanceData(path)
    if(performanceData.latency > intent.latencyRequirement or performanceData.bandwidth < intent.bandwidthRequirement):
      recalculatePath(intent) #Trigger path recalculation
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers to host mesh nodes.
*   Programmable network hardware (e.g., P4-capable switches).
*   Secure tunnel endpoints.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Control plane orchestration software (e.g., ONOS, Ryu).
*   Intent API.
*   Monitoring and telemetry tools.
*   Secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS, IPsec).
