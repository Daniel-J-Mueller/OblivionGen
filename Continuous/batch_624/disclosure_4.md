## Dynamic Landing Page Morphing Based on Internal Search Intent

**Concept:** Extend the augmentation beyond keywords to dynamically alter landing page content *before* a user arrives, based on the inferred intent from their internal search query. This bridges the gap between keyword targeting and true user intent, moving beyond simply adding commercial terms.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Internal Search Query Capture:** The internal search service will not only log searches but also transmit the full query string *before* redirecting to the landing page.
2.  **Intent Classification Module:** A machine learning model trained on historical internal search data will classify the search query into specific intent categories (e.g., "product comparison," "problem solving," "feature exploration").  This classification happens *in real-time*.
3.  **Landing Page Template System:**  Landing pages will be constructed from modular components (blocks of text, images, videos, product listings) controlled by a template engine.  These components will be tagged with metadata indicating which intent categories they are relevant to.
4.  **Dynamic Component Assembly:**  Based on the intent classification, the template engine will assemble a landing page tailored to the userâ€™s inferred need.  For example:
    *   A search for "red running shoes vs Nike" might prioritize comparison tables and feature highlights.
    *   A search for "broken zipper fix" might prioritize help articles and repair service links.
5.  **A/B Testing & Optimization:**  The system will continuously A/B test different component combinations to optimize for conversion rates, internal site engagement, and other key metrics.  Results will be fed back into the machine learning model to improve intent classification accuracy.
6. **Augmentation Tie-In:** The *augmentation terms* identified in the original patent are now used as *signals* in the component selection process. For instance, if a keyword is augmented with "buy", the system increases the probability of including product listings and "add to cart" buttons.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION generateLandingPage(internalSearchQuery)

  intentCategory = classifyIntent(internalSearchQuery)

  // Retrieve relevant components based on intentCategory and augmentation terms
  relevantComponents = getComponents(intentCategory, augmentationTerms)

  // Assemble landing page from relevant components
  landingPage = assemblePage(relevantComponents)

  RETURN landingPage

FUNCTION classifyIntent(searchQuery)

  // Machine learning model predicts intent category
  intentCategory = ML_Model.predict(searchQuery)

  RETURN intentCategory

FUNCTION getComponents(intentCategory, augmentationTerms)

  // Query component database
  components = database.query(
    category = intentCategory,
    augmentationTerms = augmentationTerms
  )

  RETURN components

FUNCTION assemblePage(components)

  // Template engine assembles page from components
  page = templateEngine.render(components)

  RETURN page
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Scalable database for storing landing page components and metadata.
*   Machine learning platform for training and deploying the intent classification model.
*   Real-time template engine capable of dynamic content assembly.
*   API integration between internal search service, intent classification module, and landing page template system.
*   A/B testing and analytics infrastructure.
