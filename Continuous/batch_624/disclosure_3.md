## Dynamic Content Stitching via Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the patent's multi-device content delivery to proactively *stitch* content fragments across devices based on predicted user attention and device resource availability, creating a more immersive and responsive experience. This goes beyond simply presenting different portions of content concurrently; it involves dynamically re-assembling content *in real-time* across multiple displays.

**Specs:**

**1. Attention Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** User gaze tracking data (via camera/VR headset/screen touch), biometric data (heart rate, pupil dilation - optional), historical viewing data, content metadata (scene changes, key events).
*   **Process:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict areas of user focus within the content frame. Outputs a heatmap representing probability of attention.
*   **Output:**  Real-time attention heatmap overlaid on content frame.

**2. Resource Availability Monitor:**

*   **Input:**  Each connected device reports:
    *   CPU/GPU Load
    *   Network Bandwidth
    *   Display Resolution/Size
    *   Current Application Load
*   **Process:**  Tracks resource utilization across all devices.  Uses a weighted scoring system based on each parameter.
*   **Output:**  Real-time resource availability map, listing devices and their available capacity.

**3. Content Partitioning & Allocation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Original content stream, Attention Heatmap, Resource Availability Map.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Content Analysis:**  Divides the content into logical "fragments" (e.g., scenes, shots, object layers).
    2.  **Fragment Prioritization:**  Prioritizes fragments based on predicted user attention â€“ high attention areas get higher priority.
    3.  **Device Allocation:**  Allocates fragments to devices based on resource availability and fragment priority.  
        *   Devices with higher capacity receive more complex/high-priority fragments.
        *   Fragments can be *split* across multiple devices (e.g., a complex visual effect rendered on a high-end display, while supporting information is shown on a tablet).
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitors attention and resource levels, re-allocating fragments as needed. Fragments can be migrated between devices in real time.
*   **Output:**  A dynamic allocation map, specifying which fragment is displayed on which device.  Includes timing information for synchronization.

**4. Synchronization Module:**

*   **Input:**  Dynamic allocation map, content fragments.
*   **Process:**  Uses a precision time protocol (PTP) or similar synchronization mechanism to ensure all fragments are displayed in perfect alignment.  Implements error correction to minimize latency and jitter.
*   **Output:**  Synchronized output streams to each display device.

**5. Communication Protocol:**

*   Utilize a low-latency, high-bandwidth communication protocol (e.g., Wi-Fi 6, 5G, or a dedicated wired connection) to transmit content fragments and control signals.

**Pseudocode (Content Partitioning & Allocation Engine):**

```
function allocateContent(content, attentionMap, resourceMap):
  fragments = splitContent(content)
  prioritizedFragments = prioritizeFragments(fragments, attentionMap)

  for fragment in prioritizedFragments:
    bestDevice = findBestDevice(fragment, resourceMap)
    if bestDevice:
      assignFragment(fragment, bestDevice)
      updateResourceMap(bestDevice)
    else:
      // Handle resource contention (e.g., lower fragment quality, delay presentation)

  return allocationMap
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Immersive Gaming:** Distribute game rendering across multiple displays for a wider field of view and higher frame rates.
*   **Interactive Storytelling:**  Allow users to focus on different aspects of a story, with content dynamically shifting to reflect their attention.
*   **Multi-Person Collaboration:**  Share complex datasets or visualizations across multiple displays for collaborative analysis.
*   **Adaptive Advertising:** Display targeted advertisements on devices most likely to capture user attention.
