## Personalized "Cognitive Load Balancing" for Content Delivery

**Concept:** Extend the existing strategy optimization to *dynamically* adjust content complexity and presentation speed based on real-time user cognitive load estimation. This moves beyond simply *what* content is shown, to *how* it's presented to maximize engagement and minimize user frustration.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Cognitive Load Estimation Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data (mouse movements, scroll speed, keystroke rate, dwell time on elements, pupil dilation via webcam – optional), device sensor data (accelerometer – to detect distractions), and potentially physiological data (heart rate variability via wearable integration – optional).
    *   **Processing:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a GRU or LSTM – trained on a large dataset of user behavior correlated with cognitive load (labeled via user self-reporting or implicit measures). The RNN outputs a continuous “Cognitive Load Score” (CLS) ranging from 0 (low load) to 1 (high load).  Model outputs updated every 50-100ms.
    *   **Output:** CLS value.

2.  **Content Adaptation Engine:**
    *   **Input:**  Content item (text, image, video, etc.), CLS value, user profile (preferences, prior interactions).
    *   **Processing:**  Based on CLS, apply transformations to the content. 
        *   **Text:**  Reduce sentence length, simplify vocabulary (using a thesaurus API), increase whitespace, use bullet points/numbered lists, highlight key information, dynamically control font size.
        *   **Images:** Reduce visual clutter, simplify color palettes, reduce the number of objects in the image (using image segmentation and object removal algorithms), dynamic contrast adjustments.
        *   **Video:** Adjust playback speed, insert pauses, provide text summaries/captions, dynamically highlight key moments (using object recognition and scene detection).
        *   **General:** Dynamically control animation speed, transition effects, and the number of simultaneous interactive elements.

    *   **Output:** Adapted content item.

3.  **Strategy Integration Module:**
    *   **Input:** Existing strategy optimization system (from patent), Adapted Content Item, User ID
    *   **Processing:** The strategy optimization system now considers the user's current CLS *in addition* to their profile and preferences when selecting content. The system learns to optimize not only *what* content maximizes engagement, but also *how* it's presented to minimize cognitive overload. This is integrated as a new weight within the existing optimization framework.  A new “Cognitive Load Reward” function is added to the existing reward function, penalizing presentations that push the user's CLS above a pre-defined threshold.
    *   **Output:** Content Presentation Request.

4.  **A/B Testing & Model Refinement:**
    *   Implement continuous A/B testing to compare the performance of the "Cognitive Load Balancing" system against a baseline (standard strategy optimization).
    *   Collect data on user engagement metrics (click-through rate, time spent on page, completion rate, etc.) and CLS values.
    *   Use this data to refine the RNN model, the content adaptation rules, and the "Cognitive Load Reward" function.
    

**Pseudocode (Content Adaptation Engine):**

```python
def adapt_content(content_item, cls_value, user_profile):
    if cls_value > 0.7:  # High Cognitive Load
        # Simplify content aggressively
        adapted_content = simplify_text(content_item.text)
        adapted_content.image = reduce_image_complexity(content_item.image)
        adapted_content.playback_speed = 0.75
    elif cls_value > 0.4: # Moderate Cognitive Load
        adapted_content = moderate_simplify_text(content_item.text)
        adapted_content.image = moderate_reduce_image_complexity(content_item.image)
        adapted_content.playback_speed = 0.9
    else: # Low Cognitive Load
        adapted_content = content_item # No adaptation
    return adapted_content
```
