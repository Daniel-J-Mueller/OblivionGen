## Dynamic Watermarking via Perceptual Hash Drift

**Concept:** Implement a dynamic watermarking system that doesn't embed a static watermark, but instead subtly alters the perceptual hash of an image or document over time, embedding information within the *drift* of the hash. This allows for authentication *and* tracking of document provenance without introducing visible artifacts.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Algorithm:** Utilize a robust perceptual hashing algorithm (pHash) as the foundation. The system isn't looking for a *match* to a fixed hash, but rather monitoring the *rate of change* and *direction* of hash evolution.
*   **Information Encoding:**  Information (e.g., user ID, timestamp, access control levels) is encoded into a "drift vector". This vector dictates how the pHash will be nudged with each access or modification. The drift vector doesn't *determine* the new hash, but influences the pHash algorithm to favor certain hash values over others.
*   **Drift Application:**  Upon document access or modification:
    *   Calculate the current pHash.
    *   Retrieve the drift vector associated with the event (user, timestamp, etc.).
    *   Apply a modified pHash algorithm that incorporates the drift vector. This modification could involve biasing feature selection, subtly altering DCT coefficients, or introducing minor variations in the hashing process. The changes should be statistically significant but visually imperceptible.
    *   Store the new pHash.
*   **Authentication/Provenance:**
    *   To verify authenticity, calculate the current pHash.
    *   Trace the pHash history. The "drift path" (sequence of pHashes) should align with the expected drift path based on access logs and known modifications. Deviations indicate tampering.
    *   The rate and direction of drift can reveal the origin and modification history of the document.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DocumentMetadata`: Stores the initial pHash, access control list, and initial drift parameters.
    *   `AccessLogEntry`: Records user ID, timestamp, and applied drift vector for each access/modification.
    *   `DriftVector`: A multi-dimensional vector representing the desired change in the pHash.
*   **Pseudocode (Authentication):**

```
function authenticateDocument(documentID):
    metadata = getDocumentMetadata(documentID)
    currentHash = calculatePerceptualHash(documentData)
    accessLog = getAccessLog(documentID)

    expectedHash = metadata.initialHash

    for each entry in accessLog:
        expectedHash = applyDrift(expectedHash, entry.driftVector)

    similarityScore = compareHashes(currentHash, expectedHash)

    if similarityScore > threshold:
        return "Authentic"
    else:
        return "Tampered"
```

*   **Enhancements:**
    *   Adaptive Drift: Adjust the drift vector based on the document content (e.g., more drift in complex regions).
    *   Multi-Level Security: Implement multiple drift vectors for different levels of access control.
    *   Steganographic Embedding: Hide additional information within the drift vector itself.
