## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Projection

**Concept:** Augment the gesture-based virtual input system with localized, dynamic haptic feedback projected directly onto the user's hand. This moves beyond simply *seeing* a virtual button or slider, to *feeling* it.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of micro-ultrasonic transducers embedded within the projector housing. (Minimum 100, ideally 500+)
    *   High-speed processing unit integrated with projector control.
    *   Hand tracking system (existing within the patent â€“ used for positional data).
    *   Optional: Low-intensity, focused infrared emitters for thermal augmentation.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** Core component.  Takes virtual input object data (shape, texture, resistance) and translates it into phased ultrasonic wave patterns.
    *   **Wave Focusing Module:**  Precisely directs ultrasonic energy to create localized pressure points on the hand's surface. Account for hand curvature and pose.
    *   **Texture Synthesis:** Generates complex wave patterns mimicking tactile textures (rough, smooth, bumpy, etc.). Utilizes procedural noise functions (Perlin, Simplex).
    *   **Dynamic Resistance Control:** Modulates wave intensity and frequency to simulate the resistance of a virtual button press or slider movement.
    *   **Safety Protocols:** Continuously monitors wave intensity and frequency to ensure user safety and prevent discomfort. Max intensity limited to non-thermal levels. Fallback to zero output upon detection of skin anomalies or prolonged contact.
    *   **Calibration Routine:**  User-specific calibration process to map hand geometry and sensitivity. Establishes baseline pressure thresholds.
*   **Operational Pseudocode:**

    ```
    // Main Loop
    while (TrackingData Available) {
        HandPose = GetHandPose();
        VirtualObject = GetActiveVirtualObject();

        if (VirtualObject != null) {
            HapticPattern = GenerateHapticPattern(VirtualObject, HandPose);
            TransmitHapticPattern(HapticPattern);
        } else {
            TransmitHapticPattern(NullPattern); // No haptic feedback
        }
    }

    // GenerateHapticPattern Function
    function GenerateHapticPattern(VirtualObject, HandPose) {
        // 1. Determine contact points between hand and virtual object
        ContactPoints = CalculateContactPoints(VirtualObject, HandPose);

        // 2. For each contact point:
        for each Point in ContactPoints {
            // a. Calculate required pressure/force
            Force = CalculateForce(Point);

            // b. Generate phased ultrasonic wave pattern
            WavePattern = GenerateWavePattern(Force);

            // c. Adjust wave pattern based on surface texture
            WavePattern = ApplyTexture(WavePattern, VirtualObject.Texture);

            // d. Add wave pattern to overall haptic output
            HapticOutput += WavePattern;
        }
        return HapticOutput;
    }

    // ApplyTexture Function (simplified)
    function ApplyTexture(WavePattern, Texture) {
        // Use Perlin noise or similar to modulate wave amplitude/frequency
        // Based on the texture's properties
        ModulatedWave = WavePattern + (Texture.Noise * Random());
        return ModulatedWave;
    }
    ```

*   **Augmentation:** Integrate low-intensity infrared emitters to provide subtle thermal feedback, enhancing the sensation of surface temperature (e.g., simulating the warmth of a virtual button).

* **Potential Applications:** Virtual instrument playing, remote manipulation, advanced UI interaction, accessibility tools.
