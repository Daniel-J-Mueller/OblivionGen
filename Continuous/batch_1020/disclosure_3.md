## Adaptive Resonance Profiling for Distributed Strain Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the vibrometric signature analysis beyond joint integrity to create a real-time, distributed strain mapping system. Instead of focusing *only* on joints, the system will leverage induced resonance to identify and quantify strain across an entire structure – essentially creating a dynamic 'heat map' of stress.

**System Specs:**

*   **Excitation Network:** An array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or electromagnetic) embedded *within* the structure itself. These aren’t just for localized excitation, but for creating complex wave patterns. Density: variable, dependent on anticipated stress gradients (high density in areas prone to high strain).
*   **Sensor Suite:** Distributed Fiber Optic Sensors (FOS) interlaced with the excitation network. FOS provide high-resolution strain measurement and are minimally invasive.  Also include MEMS accelerometers at key locations for calibration and redundancy.
*   **Resonance Sweep Protocol:** System cycles through a broad range of frequencies and amplitudes via the micro-actuator network.  The sweep is *adaptive*; the range and granularity adjust based on preliminary scan data.
*   **Signal Processing – Adaptive Resonance Identification (ARI):**
    1.  **Baseline Acquisition:** Capture initial vibrometric signatures with no load.
    2.  **Dynamic Excitation:** Apply sweeping excitation signal.
    3.  **Resonance Peak Detection:**  Identify resonant frequencies of *specific* structural elements. FOS data is crucial here for correlating vibration patterns with physical strain.
    4.  **Strain Calculation:** Employ a machine learning model trained on known strain/vibration correlations. Model input: resonant frequencies, amplitudes, and FOS strain data. Output: a high-resolution strain map.
    5.  **Model Adaptation:** Continuous model refinement via Bayesian optimization. New strain data is fed back to improve the accuracy of the strain map.
*   **Data Visualization:** Real-time 3D visualization of the strain map overlaid onto a structural model. Color-coded to indicate stress levels.
*   **Communication:** Wireless data transmission to a central control system for analysis and archiving.

**Pseudocode (ARI Core):**

```
// Input: Raw vibration data (acceleration, strain)
// Output: High-resolution strain map

function calculateStrainMap(vibrationData) {

  // 1. Feature Extraction (frequency analysis, amplitude extraction)
  features = extractFeatures(vibrationData);

  // 2. Resonance Identification (identify peaks, determine resonant frequencies)
  resonances = identifyResonances(features);

  // 3. ML Model Prediction (predict strain based on resonances)
  predictedStrain = mlModel.predict(resonances);

  // 4. Data Fusion (combine ML prediction with raw sensor data)
  fusedStrain = dataFusion(predictedStrain, vibrationData);

  // 5. Strain Map Generation (create 3D visualization of strain)
  strainMap = generateStrainMap(fusedStrain);

  return strainMap;
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Proactive Strain Monitoring:**  Identifies strain *before* failure occurs, enabling predictive maintenance.
*   **Distributed Sensing:** Provides a more comprehensive strain map than traditional point sensors.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously refines the accuracy of the strain map via machine learning.
*   **Embedded Excitation:** Minimizes interference and maximizes signal quality.
