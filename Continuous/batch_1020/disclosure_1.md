## Dynamic Resonance Chamber

**Concept:** A handheld device utilizing multiple, independently controlled haptic actuators coupled with a tunable resonant chamber to create localized, complex haptic textures and sensations beyond simple vibration.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Ergonomic, palm-sized device, approximately 150mm x 75mm x 30mm. Outer shell constructed from a lightweight, high-damping polymer.
*   **Actuation System:** Array of 16 miniature linear actuators (piezoelectric preferred) strategically positioned around a central, sealed resonant chamber. Each actuator is independently controllable in amplitude and frequency.
*   **Resonant Chamber:** Spherical cavity (approx. 50mm diameter) constructed from a thin-walled, high-quality metal alloy (e.g., titanium or aluminum). Internal surface coated with a damping material to control resonance decay. Chamber is partially filled with a non-conductive fluid (silicone oil) to enhance tactile transmission and create a sense of 'fullness.'
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller with a high-speed digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for precise control of each actuator. Software library allowing for the creation and manipulation of haptic 'textures' and 'scenes.'
*   **Input Interface:** Capacitive touch sensor array on the device’s surface for user input and gesture recognition. Wireless communication (Bluetooth 5.0) for connection to a host device (smartphone, computer).
*   **Power Source:** Rechargeable lithium-polymer battery providing at least 4 hours of continuous operation.

**Operation:**

1.  The microcontroller receives input from the touch sensor or host device, defining the desired haptic effect.
2.  The control software calculates the appropriate amplitude and frequency for each actuator to create the target haptic texture. This calculation considers the resonant properties of the chamber and the fluid within.
3.  Each actuator vibrates, inducing specific modes of vibration within the resonant chamber.
4.  The chamber’s vibrations are transmitted through the device’s shell to the user’s hand.
5.  The user perceives a complex haptic sensation, potentially mimicking the texture of various materials (e.g., sandpaper, silk, gravel) or simulating the feeling of interacting with virtual objects.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Texture Generation):**

```
function GenerateHapticTexture(texture_name) {
  if (texture_name == "sandpaper") {
    // Activate actuators in a stochastic pattern, simulating the rough surface.
    for (i = 0; i < actuator_count; i++) {
      amplitude = random(0.1, 0.5);
      frequency = random(50, 200);
      SetActuator(i, amplitude, frequency);
    }
  } else if (texture_name == "silk") {
    // Activate actuators with low amplitude and high frequency, creating a smooth sensation.
    for (i = 0; i < actuator_count; i++) {
      amplitude = random(0.05, 0.15);
      frequency = random(200, 500);
      SetActuator(i, amplitude, frequency);
    }
  } else if (texture_name == "water_ripple") {
      //Generate sine wave actuation across actuators to simulate water ripple.
      for (i = 0; i < actuator_count; i++) {
          time = get_time();
          amplitude = 0.1 * sin(time * 2 * PI / ripple_period);
          frequency = 10;
          SetActuator(i, amplitude, frequency);
      }
  } else {
    // Default: No haptic effect
    for (i = 0; i < actuator_count; i++) {
      SetActuator(i, 0, 0);
    }
  }
}

function SetActuator(actuator_id, amplitude, frequency) {
  // Send control signal to the specified actuator.
  // (Implementation details depend on the specific hardware.)
}
```
