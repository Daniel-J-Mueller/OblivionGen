**Dynamic Attribute Graph Generation & Predictive Filtering**

**Concept:** Expand beyond predefined structured graphs to dynamically generate attribute graphs *during* voice search, predicting likely filter combinations based on user history, trending data, and contextual understanding of the search.

**Specs:**

1.  **Real-time Attribute Graph Builder:**
    *   Input: Raw voice input (transcribed text), current search context (previous queries, department), user profile (search history, preferences), trending product data (sales, views).
    *   Process:
        *   NLP module identifies key attributes and their relationships from voice input.  Instead of *matching* to pre-defined graphs, it *builds* a graph.
        *   Graph construction algorithm: Nodes represent attributes (e.g., color, size, material). Edges represent relationships (e.g., "red shoes," "large wooden table").  Edge weights reflect confidence levels and contextual relevance.
        *   Dynamic weighting: User history strongly influences initial edge weights. Trending data adjusts weights to promote popular combinations. Current department biases towards relevant attributes.
    *   Output: A dynamically generated attribute graph representing the user’s intent.

2.  **Predictive Filter Module:**
    *   Input: Dynamic attribute graph.
    *   Process:
        *   Graph traversal algorithm: Identifies likely filter combinations based on graph structure (highly connected nodes = likely filters).
        *   Filter prioritization:  Ranks potential filters based on:
            *   Graph connectivity score
            *   User preference score (from user profile)
            *   Trending filter score (based on aggregate search data)
            *   Contextual relevance (current department)
        *   “Smart Suggestion” generation:  Proactively suggests filter combinations *before* the user explicitly requests them. Displayed as visual cards or voice prompts (“Would you like to see only red shoes?” “Considering your previous purchases, are you interested in leather options?”).
    *   Output: Ranked list of predicted filters and “Smart Suggestion” prompts.

3.  **Adaptive Refinement Algorithm:**
    *   Input: User response to “Smart Suggestion” (acceptance, rejection, modification), original search results, dynamic attribute graph.
    *   Process:
        *   If user accepts suggestion: Apply filter and refine search results.
        *   If user rejects suggestion: Lower weight of related attribute in dynamic graph, prevent similar suggestions in the future.
        *   If user modifies suggestion: Update dynamic graph based on modification, refine search results accordingly.
        *   Continuous learning: Algorithm refines its predictive capabilities over time based on user interactions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION processVoiceInput(voiceInput, userProfile, currentDepartment, trendingData):
    dynamicGraph = buildDynamicGraph(voiceInput, userProfile, currentDepartment, trendingData)
    predictedFilters = rankPredictedFilters(dynamicGraph)
    displaySmartSuggestions(predictedFilters)
    userResponse = await getUserResponse()

    IF userResponse == ACCEPT:
        refinedResults = applyFilters(predictedFilters, searchResults)
        RETURN refinedResults
    ELSE IF userResponse == REJECT:
        updateDynamicGraph(dynamicGraph, predictedFilters, REJECT)
        RETURN searchResults
    ELSE: # Modification
        updateDynamicGraph(dynamicGraph, userModification)
        refinedResults = applyFilters(userModification, searchResults)
        RETURN refinedResults
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond *matching* to predefined structures to *building* search spaces in real-time, adapting to individual user preferences and external trends.  Focuses on proactive assistance rather than reactive filtering, creating a more intuitive and efficient voice search experience.  The constantly updated dynamic graph allows for an exploration of nuanced combinations, and potentially uncovering hidden product features or attributes the user didn’t know existed.
