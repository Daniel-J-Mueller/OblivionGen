**Adaptive Delegation with Reputation-Based Trust Chains**

**Concept:** Extend the authentication token system to incorporate a dynamic reputation system. Instead of solely relying on decryption with a shared key, introduce ‘trust scores’ assigned to each service in the chain. These scores influence the level of access granted and the operations permitted.  This creates a more granular, adaptable, and secure delegation model.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Reputation Database:** A centralized (or distributed ledger) stores trust scores for each registered web service. Scores are updated based on:
    *   Successful/failed operation completions.
    *   Compliance with defined service level agreements (SLAs).
    *   Reported vulnerabilities or security breaches.
    *   User feedback (weighted appropriately).

2.  **Augmented Authentication Token:** The authentication token includes:
    *   Signing Key (as in the original patent).
    *   Initiating Service ID (the service originally requesting delegation).
    *   Maximum Delegation Depth (limits the number of hops).
    *   Required Trust Threshold (minimum trust score for subsequent services).
    *   Allowed Operation Set (specific operations the delegate is permitted to perform).
    *   Token Expiration Time.

3.  **Delegation Flow:**
    *   Service A (initiator) requests operation X from Service B.
    *   Service A obtains an authentication token (including the parameters above).
    *   Service A sends the request to Service B, including the token.
    *   Service B validates the token’s signature and checks the current trust score against the *Required Trust Threshold*.
    *   If the trust score is sufficient, Service B proceeds with the operation.
    *   If Service B needs to delegate to Service C, it *creates a new token*, inheriting (and potentially modifying) parameters from the original token. For example, the *Maximum Delegation Depth* is decremented. The Allowed Operation Set may be narrowed.  Service B signs this new token.
    *   This process repeats for each hop in the delegation chain.

4.  **Trust Score Adjustment Mechanism:**
    *   Each service in the chain reports back to the Reputation Database on the success or failure of each operation.
    *   The Reputation Database adjusts the trust scores accordingly. A logarithmic decay function can be implemented to reduce the impact of older events.
    *   A ‘dispute resolution’ system allows for manual review and adjustment of trust scores in cases of contested events.

**Pseudocode (Service B receiving request):**

```
function handleRequest(request, token):
  if isValidSignature(token):
    serviceId = getTokenServiceId(token)
    requiredTrust = getTokenRequiredTrust(token)
    currentTrust = getServiceTrust(serviceId)
    if currentTrust >= requiredTrust:
      allowedOperations = getTokenAllowedOperations(token)
      if request.operation in allowedOperations:
        performOperation(request)
        reportSuccess(serviceId) // Update trust score
        return success
      else:
        return insufficientPermissions
    else:
      return insufficientTrust
  else:
    return invalidToken
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Reputation Database can be implemented using a blockchain or a distributed ledger for increased security and transparency.
*   The trust score calculation algorithm should be carefully designed to prevent manipulation and ensure fairness.
*   A robust auditing mechanism should be implemented to track all delegation events and identify potential security breaches.
