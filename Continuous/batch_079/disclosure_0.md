## Dynamic Keyboard Morphology via Haptic Feedback & AI Prediction

**Concept:** A virtual keyboard that physically *reshapes* its key layout based on predicted input and user haptic feedback, moving beyond simply displaying additional rows. This creates a truly adaptive interface.

**Specs:**

*   **Display:** High-resolution flexible OLED touchscreen with localized tactile feedback capabilities (micro-actuators beneath the surface).
*   **Haptic Engine:** An array of precisely controlled micro-actuators capable of simulating key presses, subtle directional guidance, and morphing key shapes.
*   **AI Prediction Engine:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on massive text datasets and personalized user input history.  This engine predicts the next most likely characters, words, and even sentence fragments.
*   **Morphing Algorithm:**  The core of the system. Takes prediction data from the AI Engine and translates it into physical key movements and shape changes.
*   **User Profiles:** Individual user profiles store typing habits, frequently used phrases, and preferred language models.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial State:** Keyboard displays standard QWERTY layout.
2.  **Input Detection:** As the user begins typing, the AI Prediction Engine analyzes input and calculates probabilities for subsequent characters.
3.  **Key Morphing:** Based on prediction probabilities:
    *   **High Probability:** Keys corresponding to likely next characters *physically rise* slightly, providing a tactile cue and pre-positioning the finger.
    *   **Medium Probability:** Keys *shift laterally* towards the typing fingers, reducing travel distance.
    *   **Low Probability:** Keys remain static or subtly retract.
    *   **Word/Phrase Prediction:** If a full word/phrase is predicted with high confidence, the corresponding keys *briefly illuminate* and provide a distinct haptic pulse to confirm prediction. Acceptance can be achieved by continuing to type or a dedicated gesture.
4.  **Haptic Feedback Integration:** The haptic engine provides nuanced feedback:
    *   **Key Press Confirmation:** Simulated click sensation.
    *   **Prediction Confirmation:** Gentle pulse on predicted key(s).
    *   **Error Correction:** Subtle vibration if a predicted key is *not* pressed.
5.  **Dynamic Layout Adjustment:** The algorithm continuously recalculates the layout based on ongoing input, ensuring the keyboard adapts to the userâ€™s typing flow.
6.  **Personalized Profiles:** User profiles influence prediction accuracy and layout preferences.

**Pseudocode (Morphing Algorithm Core):**

```pseudocode
function morphKeyboard(userInput, predictionData, userProfile) {
  // predictionData = {key: probability, key2: probability2...}
  // userProfile = {preferredLayout, sensitivity}

  for each key in keyboardLayout {
    key.height = baseHeight // Reset to default
    key.xPosition = baseXPosition

    if (key in predictionData) {
      probability = predictionData[key]

      // Adjust height based on probability
      key.height = baseHeight + (probability * heightAdjustmentFactor)

      // Adjust xPosition if key is near likely finger position
      if (key is within fingerReach) {
        key.xPosition = baseXPosition - (probability * lateralAdjustmentFactor)
      }
    }
  }

  //Apply overall sensitivity preferences from userProfile

  //Initiate haptic feedback based on adjusted key positions
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Gesture Integration:** Allow users to customize key movements and predictions using gestures.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Dynamically switch between language layouts.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Adapt layout based on the application being used (e.g., code editor, email client).
*   **AI-Driven Learning:**  Continuously refine prediction accuracy based on user behavior.
