## Haptic Feedback Zones - Modular Controller

**Concept:** A game controller featuring dynamically reconfigurable haptic feedback zones. Instead of uniform vibration, the controller surface is divided into small, independently controllable haptic actuators. These actuators aren't just on/off; they vary in intensity and frequency. The key is *modular* actuator placement – users can physically reposition or add/remove actuators to customize feedback.

**Specs:**

*   **Controller Shell:**  Ergonomic, modular design constructed from a durable, slightly flexible polymer.  Internal grid system for actuator mounting. Dimensions comparable to existing standard controllers.
*   **Haptic Actuators:** Miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) - approximately 1cm x 1cm x 0.5cm.  Each actuator capable of 0-100% intensity, 50-500Hz frequency control. Magnetic mounting system for easy repositioning/removal.  Individual power/data connections via micro-connector grid.
*   **Actuator Grid:** Internal controller shell contains a recessed grid (5mm spacing) to accommodate actuators. Grid is wired for individual actuator control.
*   **Magnetic Mounts:** Each actuator includes a small, strong neodymium magnet on one side.  The internal grid is covered with a ferromagnetic material to secure actuators in place.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller with dedicated haptic driver.  Connectivity: Bluetooth 5.0, USB-C.
*   **Software API:**  SDK provided for game developers to define custom haptic patterns for specific in-game events. API allows granular control of individual actuators.  Includes pre-set haptic profiles (e.g., engine rumble, footstep impact, weapon recoil).
*   **User Interface:** Companion app allows users to remap actuator positions, create custom haptic profiles, and adjust intensity/frequency settings.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Loop):**

```
// Game sends event data (e.g., impact location, force)
function processGameEvent(eventData) {
  // Map event data to actuator locations and intensity
  actuatorMap = calculateActuatorPattern(eventData);

  // Loop through actuator map
  for each actuator in actuatorMap {
    // Get actuator location and intensity
    location = actuator.location;
    intensity = actuator.intensity;
    frequency = actuator.frequency;

    // Send command to haptic driver
    hapticDriver.setActuator(location, intensity, frequency);
  }
}

// Function to calculate actuator pattern based on game event
function calculateActuatorPattern(eventData) {
  pattern = [];
  //Logic to map game event to actuator pattern
  //Example:  If eventData.type == "impact"
  //            pattern.add(new Actuator(impactLocation, impactForce * 0.5, 100));

  return pattern;
}

//Data Structure
class Actuator{
    constructor(location, intensity, frequency){
        this.location = location;
        this.intensity = intensity;
        this.frequency = frequency;
    }
}
```

**Innovation:**  This moves beyond generalized vibration to precise, localized haptic feedback. The modularity allows users to tailor the experience to their preferences and the specific game being played. Potential applications extend beyond gaming – virtual reality, surgical training, accessibility devices.
