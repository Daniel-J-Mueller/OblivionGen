## Dynamic Packet Reconstruction with Selective Payload Prioritization

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on low-latency processing by initiating DMA *before* complete reception. This design expands on that concept by introducing a system where packets are *reconstructed* dynamically based on prioritized payload segments, allowing for immediate use of available data even with ongoing transmission. This is particularly useful for streaming applications, real-time analytics, and scenarios where partial data is valuable.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Network Interface Card (NIC) with DMA engine (as in the base patent).
    *   On-NIC Packet Buffer: Dedicated high-speed memory on the NIC for receiving and assembling fragmented or out-of-order packets. Size configurable based on anticipated application needs (e.g., 1MB - 16MB).
    *   Payload Prioritization Engine: Custom hardware logic (FPGA-based) for identifying and prioritizing payload segments.
    *   Traffic Shaper: Hardware module for modulating traffic rates based on reconstruction status.
*   **Software:**
    *   Host Driver: Modified driver to manage dynamic reconstruction requests and provide prioritization hints.
    *   Application Programming Interface (API): API for applications to register payload prioritization rules and request partial packet access.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Packet Reconstruction Table: Table maintained on the NIC mapping packet IDs to reconstruction status and buffer locations.
    *   Payload Priority List: List maintained by the application, mapping packet IDs and payload offsets to priority levels (High, Medium, Low).

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Reception:** Host initiates packet reception. Initial header and first segment are received. NIC initiates DMA for this segment.
2.  **Prioritization Request:** Host sends prioritization list to NIC for the packet. This list dictates which payload segments are most important.
3.  **Dynamic DMA & Reconstruction:** NIC uses prioritization list to guide DMA requests. High-priority segments are fetched first.  As each segment is received, it's appended to the packet buffer.
4.  **Partial Packet Access:** Host can request access to the reconstructed packet *before* all segments have been received. NIC provides access to the available, reconstructed portion of the packet.
5.  **Traffic Shaping:** Based on reconstruction status, NIC uses traffic shaping to request more/less data from the host. This can prevent buffer overflows or underutilization.
6.  **Completion & Notification:** Once all segments are received, the NIC notifies the host.

**Pseudocode (Host Driver - Requesting Partial Packet):**

```
function RequestPartialPacket(packetID, offset, length):
  // offset/length represent the desired portion of the packet

  // Send request to NIC via PCIe
  send PCIe_Request(REQ_PARTIAL_PACKET, packetID, offset, length)

  // Wait for NIC to signal data availability
  waitFor PCIe_Signal(SIGNAL_DATA_READY)

  // Read available data from NIC via DMA
  read DMA_Buffer(data)

  return data
```

**Pseudocode (NIC - Processing Partial Packet Request):**

```
function ProcessPartialPacketRequest(packetID, offset, length):
  // Retrieve packet reconstruction status
  status = GetPacketStatus(packetID)

  // Check if requested segment is available
  if (segment_available(packetID, offset, length)):
    // Access data from packet buffer
    data = ReadPacketBuffer(packetID, offset, length)

    // Send data to host via DMA
    SendDMAData(data)

    return success
  else:
    // Request additional data from host
    RequestMoreData(packetID)

    return failure
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Real-time Video Streaming:** Prioritize video frames over auxiliary data.
*   **Network Intrusion Detection:**  Prioritize header information for immediate analysis.
*   **Financial Trading:** Prioritize market data updates for immediate processing.
*   **IoT Sensor Networks:** Prioritize critical sensor readings.
