## Dynamic Haptic Texture Mapping

**Concept:** An electronic device incorporating a dynamically reconfigurable surface capable of simulating a wide range of textures via localized haptic feedback. This moves beyond simple vibration and aims for realistic tactile experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Integration:** Seamless integration with existing display technologies (LCD, OLED, etc.). The haptic surface would ideally *be* the device casing, or a tightly coupled layer.
*   **Actuator Array:** A dense array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, electrostatic, or shape memory alloy) embedded beneath a thin, flexible outer layer. Density: minimum 100 actuators per square centimeter.
*   **Actuator Control:** Each actuator controlled independently via a dedicated microcontroller. Resolution: 256 levels of force/displacement per actuator.
*   **Surface Material:**  Outer layer material: a self-healing polymer with a high coefficient of friction.  Thickness: < 0.5mm.  Capable of withstanding repeated deformation without fatigue.
*   **Texture Library:** A pre-loaded library of common textures (wood grain, leather, fabric, metal, etc.). Stored as actuator activation patterns.
*   **Real-Time Texture Generation:** Algorithm capable of generating novel textures based on image input (e.g., analyzing a photograph of fabric and replicating the texture). 
*   **Software API:**  API allowing developers to create custom textures and integrate haptic feedback into applications.
*   **Power Consumption:** Target average power consumption for active texture simulation: < 5W.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication module (Bluetooth 5.0 or higher) for remote control and data transfer.
*   **Safety:**  Mechanism to limit maximum actuator force to prevent injury.

**Pseudocode (Texture Generation):**

```
function generate_texture(image_data):
  // Analyze image data to extract texture features (frequency, direction, contrast).
  features = analyze_texture(image_data)

  // Map texture features to actuator activation patterns.
  activation_pattern = map_features_to_actuators(features)

  // Apply activation pattern to actuator array.
  apply_pattern(activation_pattern)

function analyze_texture(image_data):
  // Perform Fourier analysis to determine dominant frequencies.
  frequencies = fourier_transform(image_data)

  // Calculate the direction of texture lines.
  direction = calculate_direction(image_data)

  // Calculate contrast and brightness levels.
  contrast = calculate_contrast(image_data)
  brightness = calculate_brightness(image_data)

  return frequencies, direction, contrast, brightness

function map_features_to_actuators(frequencies, direction, contrast, brightness):
  // Define a mapping algorithm that translates texture features into actuator activation levels.
  // This algorithm will determine which actuators should be activated and to what extent.
  // Example: High frequency = rapid actuator oscillation. High contrast = large actuator displacement.

  activation_pattern = {}
  for i in range(num_actuators):
    activation_level = calculate_activation_level(i, frequencies, direction, contrast, brightness)
    activation_pattern[i] = activation_level

  return activation_pattern

function apply_pattern(activation_pattern):
  // Iterate through the activation pattern and apply the corresponding activation level to each actuator.
  for actuator_id, activation_level in activation_pattern.items():
    actuate(actuator_id, activation_level)
