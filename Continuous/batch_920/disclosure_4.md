## Dynamic Topic Visualization & Interactive Document Sculpting

**Concept:** Extend the topic modeling output beyond static lists of keywords or proportional visualizations. Create an interactive 3D ‘document landscape’ where documents are positioned based on topic similarity, and users can ‘sculpt’ the landscape to refine search results and explore content in a completely new way.

**Specs:**

1.  **Topic Vectorization & Dimensionality Reduction:**
    *   Utilize existing topic modeling (LDA, NMF, etc.) to generate topic vectors for each document.
    *   Employ dimensionality reduction techniques (t-SNE, UMAP) to map high-dimensional topic vectors to a 3D space. This space represents the ‘document landscape.’
    *   Each document is represented as a point (node) in this 3D space.

2.  **3D Landscape Rendering:**
    *   Render the 3D landscape using a WebGL-based visualization library (Three.js, Babylon.js).
    *   Documents closer together in the 3D space share more topic similarity.
    *   Node size represents document length or a calculated ‘importance’ score.
    *   Node color represents dominant topic(s) (e.g., red = technology, blue = finance, green = health).

3.  **Interactive Sculpting Tools:**
    *   **Topic Brush:**  A tool that allows users to ‘paint’ areas of the landscape based on topic keywords.  Selecting a keyword highlights all nodes strongly associated with that topic.
    *   **Proximity Filter:** A slider that adjusts the density of the landscape. Lower values expand the space, isolating documents. Higher values compress the space, emphasizing clusters.
    *   **Gravity Well:** A user-defined point in the landscape that attracts nearby documents based on topic similarity.  This allows users to ‘pull’ related documents together for focused exploration.
    *   **Fracture Tool:** Divides the landscape along topic boundaries. Users can then isolate and explore individual ‘fractured’ sections.
    *   **Topic Lasso:** Allows users to draw a freeform shape around documents of interest, creating a temporary subset for analysis.

4.  **Dynamic Search Integration:**
    *   As the user interacts with the landscape, the underlying search query is automatically updated.
    *   For example, selecting a cluster of documents with the Topic Lasso appends relevant keywords to the search query.
    *   The 3D landscape dynamically updates to reflect the refined search results.

5.  **Information Panel:**
    *   Clicking on a document node displays a detailed information panel:
        *   Document title and snippet.
        *   Dominant topics and keywords.
        *   Link to the full document.
        *   Related documents (based on proximity in the 3D landscape).

6.  **Pseudocode – Updating Search Query:**

```
function onSelectionChange(selectedNodes) {
  let keywords = [];
  for (let node of selectedNodes) {
    keywords = keywords.concat(node.keywords);  // Extract keywords from selected nodes
  }
  let uniqueKeywords = [...new Set(keywords)]; // Remove duplicates

  let currentQuery = getCurrentSearchQuery();
  let updatedQuery = currentQuery + " " + uniqueKeywords.join(" "); // Append to existing query

  setSearchQuery(updatedQuery);
  refreshSearchResults();
  recalculateLandscape(newSearchResults);  // Update 3D landscape based on new results
}
```

7.  **Future Enhancements:**
    *   **Temporal Dimension:** Integrate time as a fourth dimension, allowing users to explore how topics evolve over time.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:**  Color-code nodes based on the sentiment expressed in the document.
    *   **Collaborative Exploration:** Enable multiple users to explore the document landscape simultaneously.
    *   **AI-Powered Topic Suggestion:**  Use AI to suggest relevant topics and keywords based on the user's interactions.
