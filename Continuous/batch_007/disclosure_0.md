## Adaptive Focal Plane Array for Gaze-Contingent Volumetric Display

**Concept:** Combine the infrared-based gaze tracking from the patent with a dynamically adjustable focal plane array to create a true volumetric display – one where the perceived 3D image is not limited by a flat screen, but exists in actual space. This leverages the precise gaze data to render the 3D image *only* where the user is looking, maximizing perceived quality and minimizing computational load.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Two IR cameras mirroring the patent’s configuration (proximal & distal), optimized for high frame rates (minimum 120Hz).
    *   Depth sensor (Time-of-Flight or Structured Light) integrated to enhance positional tracking and calibrate the system for individual user geometry.
    *   Ambient light sensor for automatic brightness adjustment and glare mitigation.
*   **Display Mechanism:**
    *   Micro-lens array: A dense array of individually controllable micro-lenses. Each lens can focus or defocus light, effectively creating a dynamic focal plane. The array is positioned between the IR sensors and the user's field of view.
    *   Spatial Light Modulator (SLM): A high-resolution SLM (e.g., Digital Micromirror Device - DMD, or Liquid Crystal on Silicon - LCoS) projects the 3D image onto the micro-lens array.
    *   Multi-wavelength IR emitters: Incorporated around the display array to provide a consistent IR illumination source for gaze tracking, independent of ambient light conditions.
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Gaze Estimation:** IR sensors capture pupil position and corneal reflection data. Algorithms (Kalman filtering, neural networks) calculate gaze direction and point of regard with high accuracy.
    2.  **Depth Mapping:** Depth sensor provides a real-time depth map of the user’s head and facial features, aiding in gaze calibration and head pose tracking.
    3.  **Volumetric Rendering:** A rendering engine generates the 3D scene, calculating light intensity and color for each point in space.  The engine prioritizes rendering quality for the area around the user’s gaze.
    4.  **Focal Plane Control:** Based on the gaze direction and depth mapping, the processing unit dynamically adjusts the micro-lenses to create a focal plane precisely aligned with the point of regard.  The SLM displays the corresponding image section.
    5.  **Rendering Prioritization:** Implement a foveated rendering approach – rendering the area around the gaze point in full resolution and progressively reducing resolution towards the periphery. This significantly reduces computational load without noticeable visual degradation.
*   **Pseudocode (Focal Plane Adjustment):**

```
function adjustFocalPlane(gazeDirection, depthMap, microLensArray):
  // Calculate distance to gaze point
  distance = depthMap[gazeDirection.x, gazeDirection.y]

  // Calculate lens adjustment required
  lensAdjustment = calculateLensAdjustment(distance)

  // Apply adjustment to micro-lens array
  microLensArray.setFocalPoint(gazeDirection, lensAdjustment)

  return
```

*   **Materials:**
    *   Transparent polymer for micro-lens array substrate.
    *   High-resolution SLM material (Silicon, Liquid Crystal).
    *   Lightweight, ergonomic housing.
*   **Power Requirements:** Low-power components to enable portable/wearable applications.
*   **Applications:**
    *   Immersive gaming and entertainment.
    *   Medical visualization and training.
    *   Remote collaboration and telepresence.
    *   Heads-up displays (HUDs) for aviation and automotive.
    *   Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).

This system goes beyond simple gaze-triggered input. It creates a fully dynamic, volumetric display where the user’s gaze *defines* the perceived 3D space. The foveated rendering and precise focal plane control optimize performance and visual fidelity, making it suitable for a wide range of demanding applications.
