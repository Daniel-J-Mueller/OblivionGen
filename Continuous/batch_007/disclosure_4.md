## Adaptive Key Shadowing with Predictive Re-encryption

**Concept:** Extend the key usage limit enforcement by introducing ‘key shadowing’ – maintaining multiple cryptographic keys for the same data stream, and *predictively* re-encrypting data segments *before* the primary key’s usage limit is reached. This aims to minimize disruption and maintain consistent data availability.

**Specification:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Key Management Service (KMS):**  Handles key generation, rotation, and distribution. Maintains a ‘key shadow pool’ – a set of currently valid but secondary keys.
*   **Policy Engine:** Defines usage limits, rotation schedules, and predictive re-encryption triggers.  Incorporates data stream characteristics (volume, frequency) into prediction algorithms.
*   **Data Interception/Redirection Module (DIRM):** Intercepts data streams, enforces policy, and directs data to the appropriate re-encryption module. Can exist at network edge or within a data center.
*   **Predictive Re-Encryption Module (PREM):** Re-encrypts data using a key from the shadow pool based on PREM’s algorithms. Operates in parallel with data stream to minimize latency.
*   **Attestation Service:** Verifies system state and key validity before and after re-encryption.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:** Upon initial data stream setup, the KMS generates a primary key and a set of shadow keys. These keys share a cryptographic relationship (e.g., derived from a master key).
2.  **Policy Definition:** The Policy Engine defines the primary key’s usage limit (e.g., number of operations, time-based validity). It also establishes parameters for predictive re-encryption (e.g., re-encryption trigger threshold – 75% of limit reached).
3.  **Data Interception:** The DIRM intercepts the data stream.
4.  **Usage Monitoring:** The DIRM monitors the usage of the primary key.
5.  **Predictive Analysis:** When the primary key’s usage reaches the defined threshold, the Policy Engine predicts the remaining validity.
6.  **Parallel Re-encryption:** The PREM begins re-encrypting subsequent data segments using a key selected from the shadow pool. This occurs *before* the primary key reaches its absolute limit.  PREM performs the re-encryption on data segments in parallel with the ongoing data stream.
7.  **Key Switchover:**  Once a sufficient portion of the data stream has been re-encrypted with the shadow key, the DIRM switches the data stream to use the new key as the primary key.  Any remaining data encrypted with the old key is handled via a ‘catch-up’ re-encryption process if necessary.
8.  **Attestation & Verification:** The Attestation Service verifies the system state and key validity throughout the process.
9.  **Shadow Key Rotation:** The shadow keys are periodically rotated to further enhance security.
10. **Stream Synchronization:** PREM uses a stream synchronization protocol to ensure that re-encrypted segments are assembled correctly and delivered to the destination in the original order.

**3. Pseudocode (PREM - Predictive Re-Encryption Module):**

```pseudocode
function reEncryptSegment(dataSegment, shadowKey):
    encryptedSegment = encrypt(dataSegment, shadowKey)
    return encryptedSegment

function processDataStream():
    while (receiving dataSegment):
        // Check if primary key is nearing usage limit
        if (usageLimitReached(primaryKey, threshold)):
            // Select a shadow key
            shadowKey = selectShadowKey()
            // Re-encrypt data segment in parallel
            encryptedSegment = reEncryptSegment(dataSegment, shadowKey)
            // Transmit re-encrypted segment
            transmit(encryptedSegment)
        else:
            // Use primary key for encryption
            encryptedSegment = encrypt(dataSegment, primaryKey)
            transmit(encryptedSegment)
```

**4. Considerations:**

*   **Latency:**  Parallel re-encryption aims to minimize latency, but careful optimization is crucial.
*   **Key Management Complexity:** Maintaining and rotating shadow keys adds complexity to key management.
*   **Computational Overhead:** Re-encryption introduces computational overhead.
*   **Synchronization:** Maintaining data segment order during re-encryption is vital.
