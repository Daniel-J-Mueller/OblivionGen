## Dynamic Resource Host ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Scaling & Resilience

**Concept:** Expand upon the infrastructure diversity constraint concept by introducing ‘shadow’ resource hosts. These aren't immediately utilized for live resource placement, but constantly mirror the utilization patterns and configurations of primary hosts. This creates a readily available, pre-configured environment for rapid scaling and immediate failover, exceeding simple capacity metrics.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Host Creation:**
    *   Automatically provision shadow hosts mirroring primary hosts based on cluster topology and workload profiles.
    *   Shadow hosts utilize a minimal resource allocation (e.g., 10-20% of primary host capacity) for monitoring and configuration synchronization.
    *   Selection of shadow hosts prioritizes geographic diversity *beyond* the primary host diversity constraints – aiming for resilience against regional outages.

2.  **Utilization Mirroring & Prediction:**
    *   Implement a real-time utilization data stream from primary hosts to their respective shadows. This includes CPU, memory, storage I/O, and network bandwidth.
    *   Employ a machine learning model (Time Series Forecasting – Prophet, LSTM) on shadow hosts to *predict* future utilization based on historical primary host data. The prediction horizon is configurable (e.g., 15 minutes, 1 hour).
    *   The prediction model considers seasonality (daily, weekly, monthly) and anomalous events.

3.  **Dynamic Scaling Trigger:**
    *   Establish scaling thresholds based on predicted utilization. For example, if the predicted utilization of a primary host exceeds 80% within the next 15 minutes, automatically initiate a scaling action.
    *   Scaling actions include:
        *   Provisioning a new primary host (standard scaling).
        *   *Activating* a shadow host as a full primary host – providing *instant* capacity without provisioning delays.
        *   Migrating workloads from heavily loaded primary hosts to newly activated shadow hosts.

4.  **Automated Failover:**
    *   Implement health checks on primary hosts.
    *   If a primary host fails, automatically activate its associated shadow host as a replacement *without* manual intervention.
    *   Data synchronization is handled by mirroring or replication, ensuring minimal data loss during failover.

5.  **Resource Host ‘Swapping’**
    *   Periodically, *swap* the roles of primary and shadow hosts. This distributes the load more evenly and helps to identify potential issues with hardware or configuration.
    *   The swapping process is automated and occurs during off-peak hours.
    *   This also allows for 'rolling upgrades' and maintenance without downtime.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Scaling Trigger):**

```
FUNCTION trigger_scaling(primary_host_data, prediction_model, scaling_threshold):
  predicted_utilization = prediction_model.predict(primary_host_data)

  IF predicted_utilization > scaling_threshold:
    shadow_host = find_shadow_host(primary_host_data.host_id)

    IF shadow_host.status == "inactive":
      activate_shadow_host(shadow_host)
      migrate_workloads(primary_host_data, shadow_host)
    ELSE:
      // Shadow host already active – may need to scale further
      scale_up_shadow_host(shadow_host)

  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `HostData`:  `host_id`, `status` (active/inactive), `utilization` (CPU, Memory, Storage, Network), `configuration`
*   `PredictionModel`:  `model_type`, `parameters`, `prediction_horizon`
*   `WorkloadData`:  `workload_id`, `resource_requirements`, `host_id`
