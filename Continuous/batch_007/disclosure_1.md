## Dynamic Style Morphing for Product Visualization

**Concept:** Extend the attribute-based selection to *dynamically morph* the visual style of the initial product image based on selected attributes, rather than simply finding similar products. This goes beyond similarity search and enters the realm of interactive design.

**Specs:**

1.  **Style Database:** Create a database of “style vectors”. Each vector represents a visual style (e.g., “minimalist”, “rustic”, “cyberpunk”, “art deco”). These vectors define parameters impacting rendering – color palettes, texture application, lighting models, edge sharpness, material reflectivity, etc. These style vectors should be high dimensional, enabling nuanced stylistic control.

2.  **Attribute-Style Mapping:** Establish a mapping between product attributes and style vector components. For example:
    *   ‘Material: Wood’ might activate components in the style vector relating to warm color palettes, natural textures, and diffuse lighting.
    *   ‘Color: Red’ might emphasize saturation and vibrancy components.
    *   ‘Shape: Rounded’ could affect edge smoothing and curvature parameters.

3.  **Real-time Style Application:** When a user selects an attribute:
    *   Retrieve the corresponding style vector components.
    *   Interpolate (blend) the current style vector with the new components.
    *   Re-render the initial product image using the updated style vector.  This must occur with minimal latency (target: <100ms).

4.  **Style Mixing:** Allow users to select *multiple* attributes simultaneously. The system should combine the corresponding style vector components (potentially using weighted averages based on user preference or an AI-driven aesthetic assessment) to create a blended visual style.

5.  **Style Presets:** Enable users to save custom style combinations as presets for quick application.

6.  **AI-Driven Style Suggestions:** Implement an AI model trained on a large dataset of product images and aesthetic ratings. Based on the selected attributes, the AI should suggest complementary style combinations or adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Style Application):**

```
function apply_style(product_image, selected_attributes):
  current_style_vector = get_current_style(product_image)
  style_deltas = []

  for attribute in selected_attributes:
    style_delta = get_style_delta(attribute)  // Lookup style vector component for attribute
    style_deltas.append(style_delta)

  // Combine style deltas (e.g., weighted average)
  combined_delta = calculate_combined_delta(style_deltas)

  new_style_vector = combine_vectors(current_style_vector, combined_delta)

  rendered_image = render_image(product_image, new_style_vector)

  return rendered_image
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration is critical for real-time rendering.
*   Sufficient memory to store high-resolution product models and style vectors.
*   Potential for cloud-based rendering for complex scenes.
