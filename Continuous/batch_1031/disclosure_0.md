## Adaptive Record Grouping with Predictive Splitting

**Concept:** Enhance the record grouping and processing failure isolation by incorporating a predictive model that anticipates potential error-causing records *before* a full group processing attempt. This moves beyond reactive splitting to proactive refinement.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component: Predictive Splitting Engine**

   *   **Input:** Data stream of ordered records, historical processing failure data (record features, group size, processing time, error type). User-defined confidence threshold.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  **Feature Extraction:** Extract features from each record (data type, value range, frequency of occurrence, relationships to preceding records).
        2.  **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) on historical failure data to predict the probability of a record causing processing failure. The model should output a 'failure risk score' for each record.
        3.  **Dynamic Group Formation:**  As records arrive, form initial groups.  *Before* submitting a group for processing, calculate the sum of failure risk scores for all records in the group.
        4.  **Splitting Trigger:** If the sum of failure risk scores exceeds a user-defined threshold, *split the group* into smaller groups based on record proximity or feature similarity. The split should attempt to isolate high-risk records into separate groups. 
        5.  **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:** Continuously monitor processing success rates and adjust the failure risk score threshold dynamically. If success rates are high, increase the threshold to allow larger groups. If success rates are low, decrease the threshold to encourage more frequent splitting.
   *   **Output:** Stream of refined record groups optimized for processing success.

**2. Component:  Feedback Loop & Historical Data Storage**

   *   **Process:**
        1.  Record the outcome of each group processing attempt (success/failure, processing time, error type).
        2.  If a group fails, store the features of the error-causing record(s) and the group characteristics (size, features of all records).
        3.  Periodically retrain the predictive model using this historical data to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Splitting Engine):**

```
function process_record_stream(record_stream, confidence_threshold):
  refined_groups = []
  current_group = []

  for record in record_stream:
    failure_risk_score = predict_failure_risk(record)
    current_group.append(record)

    group_risk_score = sum(predict_failure_risk(r) for r in current_group)

    if group_risk_score > confidence_threshold:
      split_group = split_group_based_on_proximity(current_group)  # Or feature similarity
      refined_groups.extend(split_group)
      current_group = []

  if current_group:
    refined_groups.append(current_group)

  return refined_groups
```

**System Integration:**

*   The Predictive Splitting Engine sits between the data source and the group processing engine.
*   It receives the raw data stream, applies the predictive model, and outputs refined groups.
*   The group processing engine then processes the refined groups in parallel.
*   The Feedback Loop continuously monitors processing outcomes and updates the predictive model.
