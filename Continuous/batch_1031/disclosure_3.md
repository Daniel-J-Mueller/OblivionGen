## Decentralized Identity & Action Orchestration via Blockchain-Anchored Receipts

**Concept:** Extend the certificate exchange and receipt system to leverage a permissioned blockchain for immutable logging and decentralized verification of actions. This moves beyond centralized authentication services and allows for trustless orchestration of actions across multiple independent services.

**Specs:**

**1. Blockchain Integration:**

*   **Blockchain Type:** Permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda).  This controls access and ensures data integrity without the openness of a public blockchain.
*   **Data Structure:**  Receipts (client & servicer) are serialized and stored as transactions on the blockchain.  Each transaction includes:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Client ID
    *   Servicer ID
    *   Action Requested (from action-dependent request component)
    *   Digital Signature (of both client and servicer)
    *   Hash of the original TLS handshake data.
*   **Smart Contract:** A smart contract governs receipt validation and action authorization.  It defines rules for:
    *   Acceptable receipt signatures.
    *   Time windows for receipt validity.
    *   Action-specific authorization policies.

**2. Extended Handshake & Receipt Computation:**

*   **Handshake Addition:**  During the TLS handshake, include a 'blockchain node address' in the handshake parameters. This allows clients and servicers to discover the relevant blockchain node for receipt storage and validation.
*   **Receipt Computation Enhancement:**  Receipts now include a cryptographic hash of the TLS handshake data. This links the blockchain record to the original secure communication session.  The hash calculation MUST include the blockchain node address.

**3. Action Orchestration:**

*   **Independent Service Integration:**  Independent services query the blockchain for valid receipts before fulfilling any action.
*   **Verification Process:**
    1.  Independent service receives request with action details.
    2.  Independent service queries the blockchain using Client ID and Action Details.
    3.  Blockchain returns matching receipts.
    4.  Independent service verifies:
        *   Receipt signatures match client and servicer keys.
        *   Receipt timestamp is within an acceptable time window.
        *   Action Details in the receipt match the requested action.
    5.  If all checks pass, the independent service fulfills the request.

**4. Pseudocode (Independent Service Verification):**

```
function verifyAction(clientID, actionDetails):
  blockchainReceipts = queryBlockchain(clientID, actionDetails)

  for receipt in blockchainReceipts:
    if verifySignature(receipt.signature, receipt.clientID, receipt.servicerID):
      currentTime = getCurrentTime()
      if (receipt.timestamp > (currentTime - acceptableTimeWindow)) and (receipt.timestamp < currentTime):
        //Action details match
        if (receipt.actionDetails == actionDetails):
            return true
    
  return false
```

**5. Novelty:** This introduces a decentralized trust layer for action authorization, reducing reliance on a single authentication service.  The blockchain provides an immutable audit trail, enhancing security and accountability.  It allows for fine-grained control over actions and enables trustless interaction between clients, servicers, and independent services. The integration of the TLS handshake hash within the blockchain transaction further strengthens the link between secure communication and action authorization.
