## Dynamic Trailer Remixing with Generative Audio & Visuals

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply stitching trailer *portions* together. Leverage generative AI to dynamically remix existing trailer assets (video, audio, music) *and* create entirely new, short-form content tailored to a user’s inferred intent *during* a session. This goes beyond predicting what a user might like, and moves toward actively *crafting* content to match their evolving mood and interaction patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Existing trailer assets (video clips, audio stems, music tracks, logos, text overlays) – pre-processed and segmented for remixing.
    *   Clickstream data (as per the patent).
    *   Historical clickstream data.
    *   Real-time user interaction data (dwell time on thumbnails, scrolling speed, search queries, etc.).
    *   Sentiment analysis of user text input (if available – search queries, comments).
*   **Modules:**
    *   **Intent Inference Engine:** Refines the existing intent modeling to incorporate real-time interaction data and sentiment analysis.  Output:  A dynamic "mood vector" representing the user's current state (e.g., "fast-paced action," "chill & atmospheric," "romantic & dramatic").
    *   **Generative Asset Mixer:**
        *   **Video Component:**  Uses generative AI (style transfer, content-aware fill, interpolation) to blend and extend existing video clips, creating seamless transitions and visual effects.  Can generate entirely new short clips based on the mood vector (e.g., generate a fast-paced montage if the mood is "high energy").
        *   **Audio Component:**  Generates dynamic music tracks by remixing existing audio stems and adding generative elements (e.g., adjusting tempo, adding sound effects, creating variations on themes).  Can create entirely new short music loops based on the mood vector.
        *   **Text/Overlay Component:** Dynamically generates and animates text overlays (e.g., titles, taglines, cast names) based on the content of the remix and the user's inferred preferences.
    *   **Remix Engine:** Orchestrates the mixing of video, audio, and text components, creating a short-form “micro-trailer” (5-15 seconds) tailored to the user’s current mood.
    *   **Adaptive Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitors user interaction with the micro-trailer (e.g., watch time, skip rate) and adjusts the remix parameters accordingly.  This allows the system to learn which types of remixes are most effective for each user.
*   **Output:**
    *   Dynamically generated micro-trailers presented to the user via the UI.
    *   A stream of interaction data used to refine the intent model and the remix parameters.

**Pseudocode (Remix Engine):**

```
function generateMicroTrailer(moodVector, trailerAssets, interactionData) {
  // 1. Select relevant trailer assets based on moodVector and interactionData
  relevantAssets = filterTrailerAssets(trailerAssets, moodVector, interactionData)

  // 2. Generate new video clips (if needed)
  if (moodVector.energy > threshold) {
    newClips = generateFastPacedMontage(relevantAssets.videoClips)
    relevantAssets.videoClips.concat(newClips)
  }

  // 3. Generate new audio track
  audioTrack = generateDynamicAudio(moodVector, relevantAssets.audioStems)

  // 4. Generate text overlays
  textOverlays = generateTextOverlays(moodVector, relevantAssets.metadata)

  // 5. Assemble the micro-trailer
  microTrailer = assembleTrailer(relevantAssets.videoClips, audioTrack, textOverlays)

  // 6. Return the micro-trailer
  return microTrailer
}
```

**Innovation:** The core innovation lies in the *active creation* of content, rather than simply selecting and assembling pre-existing pieces.  This enables a far more personalized and engaging viewing experience. The adaptive feedback loop allows the system to continuously learn and improve, ensuring that the micro-trailers remain relevant and engaging over time.
