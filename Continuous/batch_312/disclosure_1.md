**Interactive Narrative Branching via Real-Time Player-Driven Environmental Modification**

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of influencing a game world through external input, but move beyond simple location modification. Instead, create a system where viewer input directly *branches* the game narrative in real-time by altering environmental conditions that trigger different AI behaviors and storyline progressions.

**Specs:**

*   **Core System:** A server-client architecture mirroring the described patent, but significantly enhanced. The server manages the game state, AI, and narrative branching logic. The client captures viewer input and transmits it with timing data.
*   **Environmental Parameter Mapping:** Define a set of “environmental parameters” within the game world. These aren’t just locations, but abstract conditions like “air quality,” “ambient temperature,” “wildlife presence,” “resource scarcity,” “political tension,” etc. Each parameter has a numerical value.
*   **Input-to-Parameter Mapping:** Viewer input isn’t directly translated into location changes. Instead, it affects the *rate of change* of these environmental parameters. For example:
    *   A viewer vote for “increase wildlife” might linearly increase the “wildlife presence” parameter over a defined time period.
    *   A viewer selection of a “resource boost” could trigger a spike in a “resource availability” parameter.
    *   Negative input (e.g., "trigger disaster") could rapidly *decrease* a positive parameter, or introduce a new negative one.
*   **AI Behavior Triggers:** Each AI agent (NPC, creature, etc.) in the game has a set of defined “behavior thresholds” linked to these environmental parameters. When a parameter crosses a threshold, it triggers a specific AI behavior change (e.g., increased aggression, migration, bartering, quest offering). These thresholds and behaviors are configurable.
*   **Narrative Branching Logic:**  The core innovation.  Based on the *combination* of AI behavior changes triggered by viewer input, the narrative branches.  This is implemented as a “decision tree” on the server, where each node represents a combination of AI states and leads to a different storyline segment.  A simple example:
    *   If “wildlife presence” is high AND “resource scarcity” is low, NPC A offers a quest related to conservation.
    *   If “wildlife presence” is low AND “resource scarcity” is high, NPC B initiates a conflict over dwindling resources.
*   **Real-Time Rendering:** The game client renders the world based on the dynamically changing environment and AI behaviors.
*   **UI/Input Layer:**  The UI presents viewers with abstracted choices that influence environmental parameters (e.g., sliders, voting buttons, resource allocation options). The timing data is critical for accurately associating input with game state.
*   **Data Logging:** The server logs all viewer input, environmental parameter changes, AI behaviors, and narrative branches for analysis and refinement.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side)**

```
// Global Variables
gameState: GameStateObject
environmentalParameters: Dictionary<String, Float>
aiAgents: List<AIAgent>
narrativeTree: NarrativeDecisionTree

// Input Handling
function processViewerInput(inputData: InputData):
    parameterToModify = inputData.parameter
    delta = inputData.delta
    environmentalParameters[parameterToModify] += delta

// Game Update Loop
function gameUpdateLoop():
    // Update AI Agent Behaviors
    for each aiAgent in aiAgents:
        aiAgent.updateBehavior(environmentalParameters)

    // Determine Narrative Branch
    currentNarrativeBranch = narrativeTree.determineBranch(aiAgents)

    // Render the world with the new branch
    renderWorld(currentNarrativeBranch)
```

**Innovation:**

This goes beyond simple environmental modification.  The intent is to create a genuinely emergent narrative experience where the story is collectively *authored* by the viewers, not predetermined by the developers. This system emphasizes *indirect* control, empowering viewers to shape the story through ecosystemic manipulation rather than direct commands.
