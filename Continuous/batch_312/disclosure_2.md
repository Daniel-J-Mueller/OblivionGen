## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Materials Handling

**System Overview:** A wearable device, integrated with a network of spatially aware haptic feedback points within a materials handling facility, to guide users to items and provide contextual information through touch.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Wearable Unit:** Lightweight wrist-worn device.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): Accurate tracking of hand/wrist position and orientation.
    *   Short-Range Wireless Communication (UWB/Bluetooth): Precise location data transmission and communication with facility network.
    *   Microcontroller: Processes sensor data and controls haptic actuators.
    *   Haptic Actuator Array:  Multiple small, individually controllable vibrotactile actuators covering a significant portion of the forearm.
*   **Facility Network:**
    *   UWB Anchor Nodes: Strategically placed throughout the facility to provide accurate indoor positioning.
    *   Haptic Control Server: Centralized server managing user location, item database, and haptic pattern generation.
    *   Item Beacons: Small, low-power beacons attached to shelving or items to identify their location. (Optional, uses computer vision fallback if not present.)

**Software Components:**

*   **Wearable Firmware:** Handles sensor data acquisition, wireless communication, and haptic actuator control.
*   **Haptic Control Server Software:**
    *   **User Tracking Module:** Uses UWB data (or computer vision) to track user location in real-time.
    *   **Item Database:** Stores item information (ID, location, attributes) and facility map.
    *   **Haptic Pattern Generator:** Translates item location and context into specific haptic patterns. (See Pseudocode Below)
    *   **Computer Vision Module:**  Utilizes facility-wide cameras to supplement UWB data, identify items, and track user gaze (to infer intent.)

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  User wears the wearable device.
2.  The wearable device continuously transmits location data to the Haptic Control Server.
3.  User requests information about an item (voice command, visual scan via integrated camera) or the system proactively suggests items based on user task/role.
4.  The Haptic Control Server identifies the item's location.
5.  The Haptic Pattern Generator creates a haptic pattern that guides the user toward the item.  (Directional vibration, intensity scaling with proximity.)
6.  The Haptic Control Server sends the haptic pattern to the wearable device.
7.  The wearable device activates the corresponding haptic actuators, providing directional guidance via touch.
8.  Upon reaching the item, the haptic pattern changes to indicate successful arrival and provides information (e.g., price, description) via modulated vibrations.

**Pseudocode â€“ Haptic Pattern Generation:**

```
function generateHapticPattern(userLocation, itemLocation):
  // Calculate vector from user to item
  directionVector = itemLocation - userLocation

  // Normalize direction vector
  normalizedDirection = normalize(directionVector)

  // Calculate distance between user and item
  distance = calculateDistance(userLocation, itemLocation)

  // Map normalized direction to actuator array
  actuatorPattern = mapDirectionToActuators(normalizedDirection)

  // Scale actuator intensity based on distance
  intensity = 1.0 - (distance / MAX_DISTANCE)
  scaledActuatorPattern = scaleActuators(actuatorPattern, intensity)

  // Add contextual vibrations (e.g., item type, alerts)
  finalPattern = addContextualVibrations(scaledActuatorPattern, itemType)

  return finalPattern
```

**Innovation Rationale:** Existing systems primarily rely on visual or auditory guidance.  Haptic guidance allows users to maintain visual focus on the surrounding environment, increasing safety and efficiency.  Adaptive patterns provide intuitive directional cues and contextual information, enhancing the user experience. The addition of contextual vibrations provides valuable information without the need for visual or auditory confirmation.
