## Modular Wing System with Variable Camber

**Concept:** Expand upon the rotating wing concept by introducing modular wing segments with independently adjustable camber. This allows for dynamic control of lift and drag across the wingspan during both vertical and horizontal flight, enhancing maneuverability and efficiency.

**Specifications:**

*   **Wing Structure:** Each wing is divided into 5-7 independent segments. Segments connect via high-strength, low-friction pivot points, allowing for limited vertical and rotational movement relative to adjacent segments.
*   **Actuation:** Each segment incorporates a small, lightweight linear actuator (electric or hydraulic). Actuators control a miniature leading edge slat and trailing edge flap, allowing for independent camber adjustment.
*   **Control System:** An onboard flight computer manages individual segment camber based on flight parameters (airspeed, angle of attack, roll, pitch, yaw, and desired maneuver).  Algorithms prioritize maximizing lift during vertical takeoff/landing and minimizing drag during horizontal cruise.
*   **Power:**  Power for actuators supplied via a distributed network within the wing structure. Redundancy built in – failure of one actuator doesn't cripple the entire wing.
*   **Materials:** Wing segments constructed from lightweight carbon fiber composites. Actuator housings and pivot points made from titanium alloy for strength and durability.
*   **Integration with Rotation:** The modular segments must accommodate the existing rotation mechanism of the patent, ensuring smooth operation during transitions between flight modes.  Wiring and power distribution must be managed dynamically through the rotation.

**Pseudocode (Segment Control Logic):**

```
// Function: adjustSegment(segmentID, airspeed, angleOfAttack, roll, pitch, yaw)

IF airspeed < 10 m/s AND angleOfAttack > 15 degrees:
    // Vertical Takeoff/Landing - Maximize Lift
    setSlatPosition(segmentID, maxExtension)
    setFlapPosition(segmentID, maxExtension)

ELSE IF airspeed > 50 m/s:
    // Cruise - Minimize Drag
    setSlatPosition(segmentID, retracted)
    setFlapPosition(segmentID, retracted)

ELSE:
    // Transition/Maneuvering
    // Calculate optimal slat/flap positions based on:
    // - Current airspeed
    // - Angle of attack
    // - Roll angle (adjust camber differentially on wings)
    // - Pitch angle
    // - Yaw rate
    // - Desired maneuver (e.g., turn, climb, descend)

    optimalSlatPosition = calculateOptimalSlatPosition(airspeed, angleOfAttack, roll, pitch, yaw)
    optimalFlapPosition = calculateOptimalFlapPosition(airspeed, angleOfAttack, roll, pitch, yaw)
    setSlatPosition(segmentID, optimalSlatPosition)
    setFlapPosition(segmentID, optimalFlapPosition)

ENDIF
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced maneuverability in both vertical and horizontal flight.
*   Improved lift-to-drag ratio, increasing range and efficiency.
*   Greater stability in turbulent conditions.
*   Potentially reduce noise by optimizing airflow.
*   Damage tolerance – localized segment failure doesn't necessarily compromise entire wing.
