**Dynamic Quorum Based on Behavioral Biometrics & Risk Scoring**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Instead of a static number of signatures or approvals for a quorum, implement a dynamic quorum requirement determined by a real-time risk assessment. This combines behavioral biometrics with external threat intelligence.

**II. Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometric Engine:**  Continuously monitors user behavior – keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, typing speed, scrolling patterns, device orientation, and potentially even subtle physiological signals via device cameras (with user consent).  This creates a baseline “behavioral profile” for each authorized signatory.
*   **Risk Scoring Engine:** Calculates a risk score based on several factors:
    *   **Behavioral Deviation:** Measures how much current user behavior deviates from their established profile. Higher deviation = higher risk.
    *   **Geographic Location:** Compares the user’s current location (IP address, GPS if available) to their usual access locations. Unusual locations increase risk.
    *   **Time of Access:**  Access attempts outside of typical working hours increase risk.
    *   **Request Content Analysis:** (Optional, for sensitive actions) Analyzes the content of the request for anomalous keywords or patterns.
    *   **External Threat Intelligence Feeds:** Integrates with threat intelligence services to identify compromised accounts or malicious IP addresses.
*   **Dynamic Quorum Manager:** This component receives the risk score and dynamically adjusts the required quorum.
    *   **Risk Score Thresholds:** Define thresholds for adjusting the quorum.  For example:
        *   Low Risk (Score < 3): Quorum = 1 (standard approval)
        *   Medium Risk (Score 3-6): Quorum = 2 (requires two approvals)
        *   High Risk (Score > 6): Quorum = 3+ (requires multiple approvals, potentially including a supervisor or security officer) or a completely blocked request.
*   **Audit Trail Enhancement:** The audit trail includes the real-time risk score, the dynamic quorum requirement, and the behavioral data used to calculate the score.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateRiskScore(user_id, behavioral_data, location, time, request_content):
  behavioral_deviation = CalculateBehavioralDeviation(behavioral_data)
  location_risk = CalculateLocationRisk(location)
  time_risk = CalculateTimeRisk(time)
  content_risk = CalculateContentRisk(request_content) //Optional
  risk_score = (behavioral_deviation * 0.5) + (location_risk * 0.3) + (time_risk * 0.2) // Weights can be adjusted

  RETURN risk_score

FUNCTION DetermineQuorum(risk_score):
  IF risk_score < 3:
    quorum = 1
  ELSE IF risk_score >= 3 AND risk_score < 6:
    quorum = 2
  ELSE:
    quorum = 3

  RETURN quorum

//Main Flow
ON RequestReceived:
  user_id = GetUserId()
  behavioral_data = CollectBehavioralData()
  location = GetUserLocation()
  time = GetCurrentTime()
  request_content = GetRequestContent()

  risk_score = CalculateRiskScore(user_id, behavioral_data, location, time, request_content)
  quorum = DetermineQuorum(risk_score)

  // Initiate Quorum Process – Request Signatures from Required Number of Signatories
  // Log Risk Score, Quorum Level, and Signatory Details in Audit Trail
```

**IV. Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Transparency with users about behavioral data collection is crucial. Provide options for opting out (with potential impact on access).
*   **False Positives:**  Careful calibration of the risk scoring engine is necessary to minimize false positives.  Adaptive learning algorithms can help improve accuracy over time.
*   **Performance:**  Behavioral data collection and risk scoring should not introduce significant latency.
*   **Scalability:**  The system must be able to handle a large number of users and requests.
