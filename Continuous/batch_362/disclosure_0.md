## Dynamic Trust Scoring via Multi-Factor Network Analysis

**Concept:** Extend proximity-based authentication to a dynamic trust scoring system leveraging network-level data beyond simple TTL or latency. This system analyzes multiple network characteristics to establish a continuously updated trust score for a client, influencing access control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network data streams (see section 2). Client identifier. Baseline trust score (initial value, potentially based on user registration data).
*   **Processing:** Weighted average calculation. Each network characteristic (see section 2) contributes to the score with a configurable weight.  Weights are adjustable based on security policy and observed network behavior.  Exponential decay applied to older data, prioritizing recent activity.
*   **Output:**  A continuously updated trust score (0-100).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculateTrustScore(clientIdentifier, networkDataStreams) {
  baselineScore = getBaselineScore(clientIdentifier);
  currentScore = baselineScore;

  // Iterate through network data streams
  for each stream in networkDataStreams {
    characteristicValue = getCharacteristicValue(stream);
    characteristicWeight = getCharacteristicWeight(stream.type);
    currentScore += characteristicValue * characteristicWeight;
  }

  // Apply Exponential Decay
  currentScore = currentScore * decayFactor;

  //Clamp between 0 and 100
  if (currentScore > 100) {
    currentScore = 100
  } else if (currentScore < 0) {
    currentScore = 0
  }

  return currentScore;
}
```

**2. Network Data Streams:**

*   **TTL Analysis:**  (As in the provided patent) - Measure TTL to determine hop count.
*   **Latency Measurement:** (As in the provided patent) - Measure round-trip time.
*   **ASN (Autonomous System Number) Verification:** Determine the ASN of the client's originating network. Flag potential anomalies if the ASN deviates from expected/trusted ASNs.
*   **Geographic Location Data:** Resolve client IP address to geographic location.  Detect discrepancies between expected location (based on user profile/history) and actual location.
*   **Packet Interarrival Time (IAT) Jitter:** Analyze the consistency of packet arrival times.  High jitter may indicate network congestion or malicious activity.
*   **Network Path Analysis:**  Trace the network path (using traceroute or similar) and identify any unusual or unexpected hops.
*   **DNS Resolution Consistency:** Verify that DNS resolution is consistent and that the client is resolving domain names to expected IP addresses.

**3. Authentication Service Integration:**

*   The Authentication Service queries the Trust Score Calculation Module for the client's current trust score *before* granting access.
*   Access control is based on a configurable threshold. If the trust score exceeds the threshold, access is granted. If not, access is denied or additional authentication factors are required.
*   The Authentication Service logs trust score changes and associated network data for auditing and security analysis.

**4.  Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**

*   Implement a machine learning model to dynamically adjust the weights of the network characteristics based on observed security events.
*   For example, if a new attack vector exploits latency manipulation, the weight of latency measurement could be increased.
*   The model should be trained on a dataset of legitimate and malicious network traffic.

**5.  Client-Side Component (Optional):**

*   A lightweight client-side agent could collect some of the network data (e.g., latency, IAT jitter) and transmit it to the Trust Score Calculation Module.
*   This could reduce the load on the Authentication Service and improve the accuracy of the trust score.
