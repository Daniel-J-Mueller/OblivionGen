## Dynamic Data Masking with Generative Adversarial Networks

**Concept:** Extend the sensitive data detection system by incorporating a dynamic data masking layer powered by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Instead of simply isolating, encrypting, or deleting data, the system *replaces* sensitive data with synthetic data that preserves statistical properties while removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** GAN-based Dynamic Masking Module (GDMM) – Integrated as a post-processing step *after* sensitive data detection (as described in the provided patent).
*   **Input:**  Identified sensitive data fields (from the patent's system) and the *entire* data object containing those fields.
*   **GAN Architecture:** Conditional GAN (cGAN). The condition is the data type of the sensitive field (e.g., email address, phone number, credit card number). This ensures generated synthetic data is of the correct format.
*   **Training Data:** A large corpus of anonymized data, categorized by data type.  Separate GANs (or a single GAN with conditional inputs) are trained for each data type.
*   **Synthetic Data Generation:**  When a sensitive field is detected, the GDMM uses the corresponding trained GAN to generate synthetic data that:
    *   Matches the data type of the original field.
    *   Preserves statistical distributions (mean, standard deviation, frequency of values) of the original field.
    *   Removes any identifiable information.
*   **Output:**  The original data object, with sensitive fields replaced by the synthetic data generated by the GDMM.  A 'masking flag' is added to the object, indicating which fields have been masked and by which GAN.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** The GDMM integrates into the existing cloud computing environment described in the patent.  Programmatic interfaces allow the existing system to call the GDMM, passing it the detected sensitive data and receiving the masked data object.
*   **Monitoring and Evaluation:** A continuous monitoring system tracks the quality of the synthetic data. Metrics include:
    *   Statistical similarity between original and synthetic data.
    *   Detection rate of PII in the synthetic data (using a separate PII detection model).
    *   Impact on downstream data analysis (comparing results on original vs. masked data).

**Pseudocode (GDMM Module):**

```
FUNCTION MaskData(data_object, sensitive_field_name, sensitive_field_type):
    IF sensitive_field_type == "email":
        generator = LoadGenerator("email_generator")
    ELSE IF sensitive_field_type == "phone_number":
        generator = LoadGenerator("phone_number_generator")
    ELSE IF sensitive_field_type == "credit_card":
        generator = LoadGenerator("credit_card_generator")
    ELSE:
        # Handle unknown data type – potentially log an error or return original data
        RETURN data_object

    synthetic_value = generator.Generate(data_object)  // Generator creates synthetic value
    data_object[sensitive_field_name] = synthetic_value
    data_object["masking_flag"] = TRUE //Indicate masking
    RETURN data_object
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Preserves Data Utility:** Allows for continued data analysis and machine learning training without compromising privacy.
*   **Reduced Risk:** Eliminates the risk of data breaches involving PII.
*   **Enhanced Compliance:**  Helps organizations meet privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Scalability:** Cloud-based architecture ensures scalability to handle large volumes of data.
