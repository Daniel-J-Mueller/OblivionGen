## Dynamic Data Obfuscation with Temporal Keys

**Concept:** Extend the mapping value approach to incorporate time-sensitive keys, creating data access that expires automatically and limits replay attacks. Instead of a static mapping, the mapping value is calculated *with* a time component, effectively creating a temporary ‘token’ for data access.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Key Generation Service (KGS):** A new service responsible for generating dynamic mapping values.
    *   *Inputs:* Identifier (as in the original patent), Time Window (duration of validity, e.g., 60 seconds), Salt (random value for added security).
    *   *Process:*
        *   Concatenate Identifier, current Timestamp (down to millisecond precision), Salt.
        *   Apply a cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or similar) to the concatenated string.
        *   Output: Dynamic Mapping Value (DMV).

2.  **Data Storage Adaptation:** Modify the data storage to *require* a DMV for access, alongside existing mapping values (if any).
    *   Store data indexed by DMV *and* original mapping value (for backwards compatibility/graceful degradation).
    *   Implement a DMV validation process:
        *   Extract timestamp from DMV.
        *   Compare extracted timestamp with current time.
        *   Allow access only if current time is within the allowed time window (configurable).

3.  **API Modifications:**
    *   `GetKey(Identifier, TimeWindow, Salt)`:  Returns a DMV for a given identifier, time window, and salt. This is called *before* requesting data.
    *   `GetData(DMV)`: Requests data using the DMV.  The DMV is used for authentication and authorization.

4.  **Pseudocode - Client Side:**

    ```
    // Request a Dynamic Mapping Value
    DMV = KeyGenerationService.GetKey(Identifier, 60, RandomSalt);

    // Request Data
    Data = DataService.GetData(DMV);

    // Handle potential errors:
    if (Data == null) {
        // DMV likely expired or invalid
        // Re-request DMV and retry
    }
    ```

5. **Security Considerations:**

*   Salt should be randomly generated and unique for each request.  Consider storing salts alongside data for auditing purposes, but *not* in a directly accessible manner.
*   Time window duration should be configurable, balancing security with usability. Shorter windows are more secure but require more frequent DMV refreshes.
*   Implement rate limiting on `GetKey` to prevent abuse.
*   Consider using a Key Derivation Function (KDF) within the `GetKey` service for added security.
*   The system could be extended to support rotating salts, further enhancing security.

6.  **Potential Use Cases:**

    *   Temporary data access for mobile applications.
    *   Secure data sharing with limited lifespans.
    *   Preventing replay attacks in real-time systems.
    *   Enabling time-based access control for sensitive data.
