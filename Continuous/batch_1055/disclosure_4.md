## Dynamic Skill Contextualization via Multi-Modal Sentiment Analysis

**Concept:** Expand the system's ability to discern user intent and emotional state beyond audio and text to incorporate visual cues (if a camera is present) and physiological data (via wearables) to *dynamically* adjust skill contexts and feedback prompt selection. This creates a hyper-personalized, proactive system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Audio data (microphone), Text data (ASR/NLU), Visual data (camera - optional), Physiological data (heart rate, skin conductance - via wearable integration - optional).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Audio: Standard ASR and NLU pipeline.
    *   Text:  Standard NLU pipeline.
    *   Visual: Facial expression recognition (FER) module â€“ identifies emotions like frustration, confusion, happiness. Object detection to understand the user's environment (e.g., are they multitasking, are there distractions?).
    *   Physiological: Heart rate variability (HRV) and skin conductance analysis to detect stress, engagement, or boredom. Requires secure API integration with compatible wearables.
*   **Output:** Consolidated multi-modal feature vector representing the user's current state.  Each modality assigned a weighting factor (adjustable via system configuration).

**2. Contextualization Engine:**

*   **Input:** Multi-modal feature vector, System usage data, Current skill context, Pre-established feedback prompts.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Dynamic Skill Weighting:**  Adjusts the weight of different skills based on the multi-modal feature vector.  For example:
        *   High frustration (visual/physiological) + error in a complex task (system usage) ->  Increase weight of "Help" skill and prioritize simplified explanations.
        *   High engagement (physiological) + successful completion of a task -> Increase weight of "Discovery" skill and suggest advanced features.
        *   Confusion (visual) + unclear system response -> Prioritize "Clarification" skill and offer alternative phrasing.
    *   **Feedback Prompt Selection:**  Selects the most appropriate feedback prompt based on the dynamically adjusted skill weights and the user's current emotional state. Prompts are categorized not just by skill but also by sentiment (e.g., "Helpful?", "Was that clear?", "Do you want to try something else?").
    *   **Proactive Assistance:** Based on detected emotional states, the system can *proactively* offer assistance *before* the user explicitly requests it. For example: if the system detects increasing frustration during a complex task, it can offer a simplified tutorial or suggest a different approach.

**3.  Feedback Loop & Model Training:**

*   Collect user responses to feedback prompts.
*   Train a machine learning model (e.g., a reinforcement learning agent) to optimize the weighting factors for each modality and the selection of feedback prompts.
*   The model should learn to predict which prompts will elicit the most valuable feedback and improve the user experience.

**Pseudocode (Contextualization Engine):**

```
function determine_skill_context(multimodal_features, system_usage_data):
    skill_weights = calculate_initial_skill_weights(system_usage_data)

    # Adjust skill weights based on multimodal features
    frustration_level = extract_frustration(multimodal_features)
    engagement_level = extract_engagement(multimodal_features)

    skill_weights["Help"] += frustration_level * 0.5  # Boost "Help" skill if frustrated
    skill_weights["Discovery"] += engagement_level * 0.3 # Boost "Discovery" if engaged

    # Normalize skill weights

    return skill_weights

function select_feedback_prompt(skill_weights, user_emotional_state):
    # Filter prompts based on skill weights
    filtered_prompts = filter_prompts_by_skill(skill_weights)

    # Select prompt based on user emotional state (e.g., choose a more empathetic prompt if user is frustrated)
    selected_prompt = select_prompt_by_sentiment(filtered_prompts, user_emotional_state)

    return selected_prompt
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Microphone
*   Camera (optional)
*   Wearable device integration (optional)
*   Sufficient processing power to handle multi-modal data processing and machine learning models.
