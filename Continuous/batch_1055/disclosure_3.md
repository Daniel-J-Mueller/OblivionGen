## Dynamic Gazetteer Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Instead of static weighting of gazetteer outputs within the named entity recognition model (as described in the patent), implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to *dynamically* adjust these weights based on context. The goal is to optimize NER performance in real-time, learning when to trust the gazetteer more or less based on the input text.

**Specs:**

1.  **RL Agent:**
    *   **State:** The state representation for the RL agent will be a vector composed of:
        *   Word embeddings of the current token(s) being processed.
        *   Gazetteer output (probability/score) for the current token(s).
        *   Contextual features (e.g., part-of-speech tags, dependency parse information) of surrounding tokens.
        *   History of previous weight adjustments (e.g., last N adjustments).
    *   **Action:** The action space will be discrete or continuous values representing adjustments to the weight applied to the gazetteer output in the second probabilistic layer.  Example:  `[-0.2, -0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2]` for discrete, or a continuous range `[-0.5, 0.5]`.
    *   **Reward:** The reward function is critical. It should be based on changes in the NER model’s confidence score (probability) for the predicted entity. A positive change in confidence indicates a good adjustment, while a negative change indicates a poor one.  A potential reward function: `Reward = ΔConfidence * WeightingFactor`.  The `WeightingFactor` would allow tuning of the sensitivity of the agent.
    *   **Algorithm:** Utilize a policy gradient algorithm (e.g., REINFORCE, PPO, or Actor-Critic) for training the RL agent.

2.  **Integration with NER Model:**
    *   The RL agent will run *concurrently* with the NER model.
    *   For each token processed, the agent observes the current state, selects an action (weight adjustment), and applies the adjustment to the gazetteer output before it’s fed into the second probabilistic layer.
    *   The NER model then predicts the entity, and the RL agent receives a reward based on the confidence score change.

3.  **Training Procedure:**
    *   Initially, pre-train the RL agent using a synthetic dataset or a small subset of labeled data.
    *   Subsequently, train the RL agent online during the NER model’s training or fine-tuning process.
    *   Regularly evaluate the performance of the NER model with the RL agent integrated to monitor improvement and prevent catastrophic interference.

4.  **Pseudocode (Agent interaction):**

```
For each token in input_text:
    state = generate_state(token, context, gazetteer_output)
    action = agent.select_action(state)  # Action: weight adjustment
    adjusted_gazetteer_output = gazetteer_output + action
    confidence = ner_model.predict(token, adjusted_gazetteer_output)
    reward = calculate_reward(previous_confidence, confidence)
    agent.update_policy(state, action, reward)
    previous_confidence = confidence
```

5.  **Data Structures:**

    *   `State`: Vector of floats representing the agent's observed state.
    *   `Action`: Float representing the weight adjustment applied to the gazetteer output.
    *   `Reward`: Float representing the reward received for the action.
    *   `Policy`: Neural network that maps states to actions.
    *   `GazetteerOutput`: Float representing the output of the gazetteer.
    *   `Confidence`: Float representing the confidence score of the NER model.

This approach allows the NER model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the input text, leading to potentially improved performance and robustness. The dynamic weighting of the gazetteer output can help the model to avoid over-reliance on the gazetteer in cases where it is inaccurate or incomplete, and to leverage the gazetteer more effectively when it provides valuable information.
