## Autonomous Data Relocation & Predictive Erasure System

**Concept:** Expand on the disconnection/destruction trigger by introducing *proactive* data relocation based on predicted connectivity loss, coupled with tiered erasure policies dictated by data sensitivity and relocation success.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Connectivity Module:**

*   **Input:** Continuous monitoring of storage device connection metrics (signal strength, latency, error rates – even if seemingly nominal), environmental data (RF interference maps, proximity alerts - even from external sources), and historical usage patterns.
*   **Algorithm:** Implement a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on device disconnection events.  The RNN predicts the probability of disconnection within a defined timeframe (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).  Confidence thresholds determine the initiation of relocation.
*   **Output:** "Relocation Risk Score" – a numerical value indicating the likelihood of disconnection.

**2. Autonomous Relocation Engine:**

*   **Trigger:** Relocation Risk Score exceeding a pre-defined threshold.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify redundant storage locations within the data center (based on available capacity, network bandwidth, and data replication policies).
    *   Initiate asynchronous data copy to the identified redundant locations.
    *   Verify data integrity at the destination using checksums/hash comparisons.
*   **Metadata Update:** Update data pointers/indexes to reflect the new data location *before* the original is potentially lost.

**3. Tiered Erasure Policy Manager:**

*   **Data Classification:** Categorize data based on sensitivity levels (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Highly Restricted). This can leverage existing data loss prevention (DLP) systems.
*   **Erasure Tiers:** Define erasure tiers corresponding to each sensitivity level:
    *   **Tier 1 (Highly Restricted):** Full data overwrite with multiple passes (e.g., DoD 5220.22-M standard) upon disconnection *only* if relocation fails.
    *   **Tier 2 (Confidential):** Single-pass overwrite upon disconnection if relocation fails.
    *   **Tier 3 (Internal):**  Logical deletion/marking of data blocks for later secure overwriting during scheduled maintenance. Relocation failure triggers immediate marking.
    *   **Tier 4 (Public):** No immediate erasure. Data remains available in redundant locations.
*   **Disconnection Trigger:** Upon disconnection detection, and *failed* relocation attempts, activate the erasure tier corresponding to the data’s sensitivity.

**4. Power Management Integration:**

*   **Dedicated Backup Power:** Integrate a small, high-density solid-state capacitor bank *within* the storage device. This provides enough power for the following:
    *   Completion of the relocation process *in progress* if disconnection occurs during transfer.
    *   Activation of the erasure mechanism (if triggered).
    *   Sending a final "device compromised" signal before complete power loss.

**Pseudocode (Disconnection Handling):**

```
function handleDisconnection(storageDevice):
  if relocationAttempt(storageDevice) == SUCCESS:
    log("Relocation successful. No erasure needed.")
    return

  dataSensitivity = getDataSensitivity(storageDevice)
  erasureTier = getErasureTier(dataSensitivity)

  if erasureTier == TIER1 or erasureTier == TIER2:
    activateErasure(storageDevice, erasureTier)
  else:
    markForSecureWipe(storageDevice)

  sendCompromisedSignal(storageDevice)
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond simple destruction upon disconnection to introduce *proactive* data safeguarding, tiered security based on sensitivity, and a localized power reserve to ensure critical actions complete even during catastrophic failure.  It’s a shift from reactive destruction to intelligent resilience.
