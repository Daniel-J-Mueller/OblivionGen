## Dynamic Sensory Substitution Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the automated profile application to *all* sensory input, not just audio, and introduce dynamic profile switching based on detected user state.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensory Data Acquisition:** System capable of receiving data streams from multiple sensors:
    *   Haptic feedback devices (controllers, wearables) – force, vibration, texture data.
    *   Visual input (cameras) – ambient lighting, object detection, facial expression analysis.
    *   Biofeedback sensors (heart rate, skin conductance, EEG) – physiological state.
*   **Sensory Profile Database:** Central repository of sensory profiles, categorized by content type, environment, *and* user state. Profiles define mappings between content events/positions and sensory outputs.  Examples:
    *   **Gaming – High Stress:** Increased haptic intensity during boss battles, desaturated color palette, directional audio emphasis.
    *   **Movie – Romantic Scene:** Subdued haptic vibrations mimicking heartbeat, warm color temperature adjustment, ambient lighting dimming.
    *   **Audiobook – Action Sequence:** Directional audio panning, synchronized haptic pulses, subtle visual cues (e.g., flickering lights).
*   **User State Detection Module:**  Analyzes biofeedback and visual input to determine user state. Possible states:
    *   **Relaxed:** Baseline sensory profile applied.
    *   **Engaged:** Increased sensory intensity, more dynamic mappings.
    *   **Stressed/Anxious:** Sensory simplification, reduced intensity, potentially calming visual/haptic patterns.
    *   **Distracted:** Sensory cues to refocus attention (e.g., subtle haptic taps, brief visual highlights).
*   **Dynamic Profile Switching Logic:**  Algorithm that selects and applies the appropriate sensory profile based on:
    *   Content identifier
    *   Detected user state
    *   Ambient environment (lighting, noise)
    *   Time of day (influences lighting/audio preferences)
*   **Profile Creation/Adaptation Tools:** User interface allowing:
    *   Manual creation of sensory profiles.
    *   Recording and playback of sensory experiences.
    *   Machine learning algorithms to learn user preferences and automatically adapt profiles.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Standardized protocol for communication between media device, sensors, and output devices.
*   **Output Device Control:** Ability to control various output devices:
    *   Haptic feedback actuators
    *   Smart lighting systems
    *   Speakers/headphones
    *   Displays

**Pseudocode (Profile Switching Logic):**

```
function select_profile(content_id, user_state, environment, time_of_day):
  // Retrieve base profile for content type
  base_profile = get_base_profile(content_id)

  // Apply user state modifiers
  if user_state == "stressed":
    profile = apply_stress_reduction_modifiers(base_profile)
  elif user_state == "engaged":
    profile = apply_engagement_boost_modifiers(base_profile)
  else:
    profile = base_profile

  // Adjust for environment
  if environment.ambient_light < threshold:
    profile.brightness += adjustment_factor
  if environment.noise_level > threshold:
    profile.audio_emphasis = "directional"

  // Apply time-of-day adjustments
  if time_of_day == "night":
    profile.color_temperature = "warm"

  return profile
```

**Novelty:** Extends the concept of automated profile application beyond audio to encompass *all* sensory modalities, introduces dynamic profile switching based on user state and environment, and provides tools for personalized sensory experience creation.
