## Adaptive Trust Scoring & Dynamic Permission Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the role-based access control with a continuous trust score for each principal, influencing permission granularity *within* a role, not just *between* roles. This allows for fine-grained access control that adapts to real-time risk assessment.

**Specs:**

*   **Trust Score Components:**
    *   Geolocation Variance: Deviation from expected location (historical, scheduled).
    *   Behavioral Biometrics: Typing speed, mouse movement patterns, command usage (anomaly detection).
    *   Device Posture: Security status of the accessing device (OS patching, AV status, firewall enabled).
    *   Data Access Patterns: Sensitivity of accessed data, frequency, and volume.
    *   Social Graph Analysis: Trust relationships between principals (e.g., shared projects, approvals).

*   **Trust Score Calculation:** Weighted average of components. Weights configurable per role and sensitivity level. Score ranges from 0-100.

*   **Dynamic Permission Layers:** Each role defines multiple permission layers (e.g., Layer 1: Read-only, Layer 2: Edit, Layer 3: Delete). Trust score determines the highest accessible layer.

*   **Permission Layer Configuration:** Roles are assigned permission layers based on the Trust Score. For example:

    *   Trust Score 0-30: Layer 1 (Read-only)
    *   Trust Score 31-60: Layer 2 (Edit)
    *   Trust Score 61-100: Layer 3 (Delete)

*   **Real-time Trust Assessment:** Trust score is recalculated continuously based on incoming data. Access requests are evaluated against the *current* score.

*   **Adaptive Challenge Mechanisms:**  If trust score drops below a threshold, the system can trigger multi-factor authentication, device attestation, or other challenge mechanisms before granting access.

*   **Session Isolation:**  Lower trust scores lead to restricted sessions (e.g., temporary access, limited data export).

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/trust/score/{principal_id}`: Retrieve current trust score.
    *   `/trust/components/{principal_id}`: Retrieve breakdown of trust score components.
    *   `/roles/{role_id}/layers`: Retrieve permission layers for a role.
    *   `/auth/request/{resource}`: Authentication endpoint incorporating trust score evaluation.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Endpoint):**

```
function authenticateRequest(resource, principal_id, token):
    trust_score = getTrustScore(principal_id)
    role = getTokenRole(token)
    permission_layer = getPermissionLayer(role, trust_score)

    if hasAccess(permission_layer, resource):
        return grantAccess(resource)
    else:
        if trust_score < threshold:
            triggerChallenge()
        return denyAccess()
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple revocation and role switching. It enables a continuous, adaptive access control system, increasing security and reducing the blast radius of compromised accounts. It's a granular, risk-based system, rather than an all-or-nothing approach.
