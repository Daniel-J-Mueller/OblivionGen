## Specimen Tube - Integrated Microfluidic Chip

**Concept:** Integrate a microfluidic chip directly into the specimen tube to enable automated, on-demand sample preparation and analysis.

**Specifications:**

*   **Tube Body:** Standard dimensions compatible with existing automated handling systems. Material: Cyclic Olefin Copolymer (COC) or Polypropylene for compatibility with microfluidics and sterilization.
*   **Microfluidic Chip Location:**  Embedded within the tube wall, molded during manufacturing, or securely affixed to the interior wall near the closed end.  
*   **Chip Material:** Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) or similar biocompatible polymer.
*   **Channel Network:**
    *   **Sample Intake:** A port aligned with the open end of the tube for initial sample introduction.
    *   **Cell Separation:** Microfabricated channels and obstacles for isolating specific cell types (e.g., white blood cells, bacteria). Based on size exclusion or affinity binding.
    *   **Lysing Chamber:** A chamber containing reagents for cell lysis (if required for downstream analysis). Controlled release via micro-reservoirs.
    *   **Nucleic Acid Extraction/Amplification:** Integrated PCR or LAMP capabilities within the chip. Micro-heaters and temperature sensors for precise control.
    *   **Detection Zone:**  Fluorescent or colorimetric sensors for detecting target biomarkers (e.g., pathogens, genetic mutations).
    *   **Waste Reservoir:**  A small chamber to collect waste products from the analysis.
*   **Fluid Actuation:**
    *   **Micro-Pumps:** Integrated piezoelectric micro-pumps for precise fluid control. Powered by the tube cap (see below).
    *   **Capillary Action:** Utilize capillary forces in microchannels to drive fluid flow where possible, minimizing power requirements.
*   **Power & Communication:**
    *   **Tube Cap:** Contains a miniature rechargeable battery and a wireless communication module (Bluetooth or NFC).
    *   **Inductive Charging:**  The tube can be charged wirelessly via a docking station.
    *   **Data Transmission:**  Analysis results are transmitted wirelessly to a connected device (smartphone, computer).
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Cap Indicator:** LED indicator on the cap to display status (charging, running analysis, results).
    *   **Mobile App:** A companion mobile app to control the device, view results, and manage data.
*   **Sterilization:** Tube and chip must be compatible with standard sterilization methods (autoclave, gamma irradiation).

**Novelty:** Current specimen tubes are passive containers. This design introduces active, on-demand sample preparation and analysis capabilities, enabling point-of-care diagnostics and reducing the need for centralized laboratory testing. The integration of microfluidics and wireless communication creates a truly ‘smart’ specimen tube.
