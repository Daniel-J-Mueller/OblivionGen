## Dynamic Workspace Reconfiguration with Predictive Resource Relocation

**Concept:** Expand upon the virtual workspace representation to incorporate predictive relocation of resources *before* workspace changes are initiated. This moves beyond reactive adaptation to proactive optimization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical resource utilization data (frequency, duration, location), current resource locations, planned workspace changes (from the existing system).  Workspace change requests *must* include a timeline/duration for the change.
*   **Process:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to predict resource demand within the workspace *during* and *immediately following* a planned configuration change. This includes predicting the optimal location for resources *prior* to the change.  The model *must* factor in travel time for unmanned drive units.
*   **Output:** A prioritized list of resources requiring relocation *before* the configuration change, along with proposed destination locations and suggested relocation timelines.  Include a 'confidence score' for each prediction.

**2. Staged Relocation System:**

*   **Mechanism:** Introduce a "Relocation Stage" within the virtual workspace representation. This stage is a temporary overlay on the primary navigable grid.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Upon receiving relocation recommendations from the Predictive Modeling Module, unmanned drive units are directed to move resources to locations *within* the Relocation Stage. This is done *concurrently* with normal operations.
    2.  The Relocation Stage is segregated within the virtual representation – drive units operating in the primary grid are unaware of resources in the Relocation Stage (collision avoidance is handled separately).
    3.  Upon completion of the workspace reconfiguration (based on existing deployment triggers), the Relocation Stage is merged with the primary navigable grid, and resources are seamlessly integrated into the new configuration.

**3. Dynamic Grid Partitioning:**

*   **Functionality:**  Implement a system to temporarily partition the drive-unit navigable grid *around* areas undergoing change.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Upon initiation of a workspace change, create a "Buffer Zone" around the affected area. This zone is initially set to a larger radius than necessary.
    2.  Drive units are temporarily rerouted around the Buffer Zone.
    3.  The Buffer Zone radius is dynamically adjusted based on real-time monitoring of progress (via visual or sensor data).
    4.  As the workspace change nears completion, the Buffer Zone shrinks, eventually disappearing entirely. This allows for a smooth transition.

**4. Resource ‘Shadowing’ & Proactive Staging:**

*   **Function:** When a predicted demand for an inventory item is high in a new configuration, the system proactively stages a 'shadow' copy of that item near its predicted future location.
*   **Process:**
    1.  The Predictive Modeling Module identifies inventory items likely to be needed in the new configuration.
    2.  A small quantity of that inventory is relocated to a staging area near its predicted final location (within the Relocation Stage).
    3.  Upon full deployment of the new configuration, the staged inventory is seamlessly moved into its final position.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Relocation):**

```
FUNCTION InitiateWorkspaceChange(changeRequest, timeline)
  predictedResourceRelocations = PredictiveModelingModule(changeRequest, timeline)

  FOREACH relocation IN predictedResourceRelocations
    SendRelocationTask(relocation.resourceID, relocation.newLocation, relocation.priority)

  ActivateDynamicGridPartitioning(changeRequest.affectedArea)

  MonitorWorkspaceChangeProgress()

  UponCompletion()
    DeactivateDynamicGridPartitioning()
    MergeRelocationStageWithPrimaryGrid()
END FUNCTION
```

This system moves beyond simply adapting to workspace changes. It anticipates those changes, proactively preparing the workspace for optimal performance and minimizing disruption.
