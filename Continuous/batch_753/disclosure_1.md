## Temporal Data Weaving

**Concept:** Extend the multi-datacenter data storage and reconciliation to actively *weave* together data streams based on causality *and* temporal proximity, creating dynamic, context-aware data representations.  Instead of simply reconciling copies, we’re building a system that understands the “story” of the data as it evolves.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Segmentation:**  Divide incoming data into “temporal segments” – short, logically grouped units of change.  Segment size is configurable, but defaults to 50ms.  Each segment includes a timestamp, originating datacenter, and a causality hash.
*   **Causality Hash:** A cryptographic hash generated from the data within the segment *and* the hash of the previous segment in the same data stream.  This creates a verifiable chain of causality.
*   **Temporal Graph:**  Maintain a distributed temporal graph across data centers.  Nodes in the graph represent data segments. Edges represent causal relationships (identified by matching causality hashes) *and* temporal proximity (segments occurring within a configurable window of each other).
*   **Weaving Logic:** A distributed service responsible for:
    *   Receiving new segments from data centers.
    *   Adding segments to the temporal graph.
    *   Identifying potential causal links and temporal proximities.
    *   Triggering “weaving” operations.
*   **Weaving Operations:**
    *   **Causal Merge:** If a strong causal link is established (matching causality hash), the segments are merged into a single, consolidated segment.
    *   **Temporal Overlay:**  If segments are temporally close but not directly causally linked, they are overlaid. This doesn’t merge data but creates a composite segment containing pointers to both original segments.  A “context score” is assigned based on temporal proximity and other metadata.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Segments with weak or missing causal links, or those falling outside expected temporal patterns, are flagged as anomalies.
*   **Data Access:** Clients access data through a “temporal query language.”  This language allows specifying:
    *   Data stream ID
    *   Time range
    *   Context score threshold (to filter overlaid segments)
    *   Anomaly detection flags
*   **Distributed Consensus:** Use a consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure consistency of the temporal graph across data centers.

**Pseudocode (Weaving Logic - Simplified):**

```
function process_segment(segment):
  add_segment_to_temporal_graph(segment)
  causal_matches = find_causal_matches(segment)
  temporal_matches = find_temporal_matches(segment)

  if causal_matches:
    merge_segments(causal_matches, segment)
  elif temporal_matches:
    create_overlay_segment(temporal_matches, segment)
  else:
    flag_segment_as_anomaly(segment)

function merge_segments(segments, new_segment):
  # Combine data from segments, update causality hash, remove old segments
  pass

function create_overlay_segment(segments, new_segment):
  # Create new segment with pointers to old segments, calculate context score
  pass

function flag_segment_as_anomaly(segment):
  # Log anomaly, alert monitoring system
  pass
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time fraud detection.
*   Dynamic personalization.
*   Predictive maintenance.
*   Autonomous systems.
