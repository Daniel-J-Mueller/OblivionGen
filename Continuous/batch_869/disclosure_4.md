**Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Device Resilience Assessment**

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple event detection to provide nuanced assessments of device resilience *during* physical events, communicated to the user via haptic feedback. Instead of just knowing *that* a bump occurred, the user feels a graduated response reflecting the *severity* of the impact and estimated device stress.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Utilize existing accelerometer/gyroscope data *plus* integrate micro-strain gauges embedded within the device chassis (specifically near common stress points - screen corners, hinge areas, etc.).
*   **Real-Time Stress Mapping:** Implement a localized stress mapping algorithm.  This converts raw sensor data into a 'stress profile' representing the magnitude and distribution of force/strain across the device.
*   **Haptic Engine Control:** Link the stress profile to a multi-point haptic engine (array of actuators embedded within the device casing).  The engine delivers localized vibrations/textures that *correspond* to the stress map.  High stress areas = stronger/more complex haptic patterns.
*   **Graduated Feedback Scale:**
    *   **Level 1 (Minor Impact):** Gentle, localized pulse â€“ user barely notices.  Indicates negligible stress.
    *   **Level 2 (Moderate Impact):** More pronounced vibration, slightly wider area.  Indicates moderate stress, potential for minor cosmetic damage.
    *   **Level 3 (Significant Impact):**  Strong, complex vibration pattern.  Indicates significant stress, high probability of internal damage.
    *   **Level 4 (Critical Impact):**  Rapid, high-intensity vibration *combined* with an audible alert. Indicates critical structural failure is imminent.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to adjust the sensitivity of the haptic feedback system and the intensity of each feedback level.
*   **Data Logging & Predictive Maintenance:** Log all impact events and associated stress data. Use machine learning to identify patterns indicative of weakening structural integrity and proactively recommend repairs or replacements.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Engine Control):**

```
function generateHapticFeedback(stressMap) {
  // stressMap is a 2D array representing stress levels at various points on the device

  for (each point in stressMap) {
    stressLevel = stressMap[point];

    if (stressLevel > thresholdLevel3) {
      //Activate corresponding haptic actuator with high intensity complex pattern
      activateHapticActuator(point, "complex_high");
    } else if (stressLevel > thresholdLevel2) {
      activateHapticActuator(point, "moderate");
    } else if (stressLevel > thresholdLevel1) {
      activateHapticActuator(point, "gentle");
    }
  }
}

function activateHapticActuator(location, pattern) {
  //Code to control the haptic actuator at 'location' with the specified 'pattern'
}
```

**Novelty:** Current systems focus on *detecting* impacts. This system aims to *communicate* device stress in real-time, providing the user with an intuitive understanding of the structural health of their device. It shifts the paradigm from passive damage assessment to active resilience feedback.
