## Adaptive API View Composition via Reinforcement Learning

**Specification:** A system to dynamically compose API views based on real-time application needs and historical performance, leveraging reinforcement learning.

**Core Concept:** The patent describes composing API views *defined* by a user. This expands on that by *learning* optimal view compositions automatically.

**Components:**

1.  **RL Agent:** A reinforcement learning agent responsible for selecting and combining underlying web services to construct API views.

2.  **State Space:** The state space represents the application's current context. This includes:
    *   Request parameters (e.g., filters, sorting criteria).
    *   Application load (CPU, memory, network).
    *   Historical response times for different view compositions.
    *   User/client profile (access privileges, typical usage patterns).

3.  **Action Space:** The action space defines the possible actions the RL agent can take. This includes:
    *   Selecting a pre-defined API view template.
    *   Choosing which web services to include in a custom view.
    *   Adjusting data fields within the view (e.g., adding, removing, reordering).
    *   Applying data transformations (e.g., aggregation, filtering).

4.  **Reward Function:** The reward function incentivizes the RL agent to create API views that optimize performance. This includes:
    *   **Response time:** Lower response times yield higher rewards.
    *   **Throughput:** Higher throughput yields higher rewards.
    *   **Resource utilization:** Lower resource utilization yields higher rewards.
    *   **Error rate:** Lower error rates yield higher rewards.
    *   **User satisfaction:** (Proxy via usage patterns/explicit feedback)

5.  **View Composition Engine:**  A module that takes the action selected by the RL agent and constructs the corresponding API view. This leverages existing web service API calls as outlined in the patent.

6.  **Online Learning Module:** The system continuously learns and adapts to changing application needs. This is achieved through online reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., Q-learning, SARSA, Policy Gradients).

**Pseudocode (Online Learning Loop):**

```
Initialize RL Agent and Q-Table (or Policy Network)

While Application is Running:
    Receive API Request
    Observe Current State (Request Parameters, Load, History)
    Agent Selects Action (View Composition) based on State & Q-Table/Policy
    Compose API View using selected Action & Web Service APIs
    Send Response to Client
    Receive Reward (based on Response Time, Throughput, Errors, etc.)
    Update Q-Table/Policy based on State, Action, Reward (Reinforcement Learning Step)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **State Vector:**  `[request_params, app_load, historical_response_times, user_profile]`
*   **Action Vector:** `[view_template_id, web_service_list, data_field_list, transformation_list]`
*   **Q-Table:**  `Q(State, Action) -> Reward Value` (or equivalent Policy Network representation).

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The system can be deployed as a service alongside the existing view service outlined in the patent.
*   A/B testing can be used to evaluate the performance of the RL-based view composition against static, manually defined views.
*   The reward function can be tuned to prioritize different performance metrics based on application requirements.
*   The state and action spaces can be adjusted to balance complexity and expressiveness.
