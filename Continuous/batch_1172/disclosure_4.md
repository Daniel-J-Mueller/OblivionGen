## Dynamic Skill-Based Task Decomposition & Re-Pricing

**Concept:** Instead of pricing *tasks* directly, the system decomposes complex tasks into micro-tasks based on required *skills*.  Pricing adjusts not just on pace, but on the *availability of skilled workers* for each micro-task. This creates a dynamic, self-balancing labor market *within* the task platform.

**Specs:**

*   **Skill Ontology:** A comprehensive, evolving ontology of skills (e.g., “image labeling - cats”, “data entry - Spanish”, “code review - Python”).  This is a core component, continuously updated through machine learning analysis of task performance data & user profiles.
*   **Task Decomposition Engine:**  An algorithm that analyzes submitted tasks & automatically breaks them down into skill-based micro-tasks.  This leverages the Skill Ontology.  Example: "Create a marketing video" decomposes into: “video script writing - travel niche”, “voiceover recording - female, 30s”, “video editing - Adobe Premiere”, “thumbnail design - vibrant colors”.
*   **Skill-Based Worker Profiling:** User profiles go beyond simple ratings.  They track demonstrated proficiency in specific skills (verified through task performance & optional assessments).  Each skill has a confidence score.
*   **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm:**
    *   **Base Price:** Each micro-task has a base price determined by complexity (estimated by the system) & historical data.
    *   **Supply/Demand Modifier:** The price is adjusted based on the *current availability* of qualified workers for that skill. Fewer qualified workers = higher price.  This is calculated in real-time.
    *   **Quality Bonus:** Workers completing tasks at higher quality (verified through peer review or automated checks) receive a bonus multiplier.
    *   **Pace Adjustment:** As in the original patent, price can be adjusted if tasks are completed significantly slower or faster than expected, but *this is a secondary adjustment*.
*   **Micro-Task Queueing:**  Completed micro-tasks are automatically assembled into the final output. The system manages dependencies between micro-tasks.
*   **API for Task Submission:**  Task requesters submit tasks at a higher level of abstraction. The system handles the decomposition and worker assignment.

**Pseudocode (Pricing Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_price(task, skill, current_workers_available):
  base_price = get_base_price(skill)
  supply_demand_modifier = 1.0
  if current_workers_available < threshold:
    supply_demand_modifier = 1.0 + (1.0 / current_workers_available)  // Increase price if few workers
  
  quality_bonus = 1.0 // default
  if worker_quality > threshold:
    quality_bonus = 1.2  // example bonus for high quality work
  
  pace_adjustment = 1.0 // set by the original algorithm, if applicable

  price = base_price * supply_demand_modifier * quality_bonus * pace_adjustment
  return price
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Skill`:  `skill_id`, `skill_name`, `difficulty_level`, `average_completion_time`
*   `WorkerProfile`: `worker_id`, `skill_proficiency` (dictionary of `skill_id` : `proficiency_score`)
*   `Task`: `task_id`, `task_description`, `skill_requirements` (list of `skill_id`), `estimated_completion_time`
*   `MicroTask`: `microtask_id`, `task_id`, `skill_id`, `price`, `status`

**Innovation:** This shifts the focus from *tasks* to *skills*, creating a more fluid and efficient labor market. It addresses skill shortages by incentivizing workers to develop in-demand skills and allows for a more granular and responsive pricing model.  It’s more dynamic than simply adjusting pace-based prices.
