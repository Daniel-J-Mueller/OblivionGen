## Dynamic Data Materialization with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the virtual column/index system to proactively materialize data *before* it's explicitly requested in a formula. This shifts the paradigm from reactive indexing to predictive data readiness, dramatically reducing latency for complex queries, particularly those involving multi-table joins.

**Specs:**

*   **Prefetch Engine:** A background process continuously monitors formula definitions and data access patterns. It identifies potential future data requirements based on formula dependencies (e.g., a formula referencing a linked table).
*   **Dependency Graph:** Construct a dynamic dependency graph of all formulas, tables, and columns within the workbook.  This graph tracks data relationships and potential access sequences.
*   **Prediction Model:** Employ a time-series prediction model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) trained on historical query data and formula access patterns.  This model predicts which virtual columns and indices will be needed in the near future.
*   **Materialization Queue:** A prioritized queue of virtual columns/indices awaiting materialization.  Priority is determined by the prediction model's confidence score and the estimated computational cost of materialization.
*   **Adaptive Materialization:**  Dynamically adjust the degree of materialization based on system load, available memory, and prediction accuracy.  Avoid over-materialization (wasting resources) and under-materialization (performance bottlenecks).
*   **Multi-Tier Cache:** Implement a multi-tiered caching system for materialized virtual columns/indices. Tier 1: Fast in-memory cache. Tier 2: SSD-based cache. Tier 3: Traditional disk storage.
*   **Formula Rewriting (Optional):** Automatically rewrite formulas to leverage pre-materialized data.  For example, replace a lookup with a direct reference to a cached value.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Engine):**

```
// Main Loop
while (WorkbookActive) {
  // 1. Analyze Formula Changes/New Formulas
  FormulaChanges = DetectFormulaChanges();
  NewFormulas = DetectNewFormulas();

  // 2. Update Dependency Graph
  UpdateDependencyGraph(FormulaChanges, NewFormulas);

  // 3. Predict Future Data Needs
  PredictedDataNeeds = PredictionModel.Predict(DependencyGraph);

  // 4. Prioritize Materialization Queue
  MaterializationQueue = PrioritizeQueue(PredictedDataNeeds);

  // 5. Materialize Data (Background Thread)
  while (MaterializationQueue.NotEmpty()) {
    VirtualColumn = MaterializationQueue.Dequeue();
    MaterializeVirtualColumn(VirtualColumn);
  }

  Sleep(UpdateInterval);
}

function MaterializeVirtualColumn(VirtualColumn) {
  // 1. Calculate Virtual Column Values
  Values = CalculateValues(VirtualColumn);

  // 2. Store Values in Cache (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3)
  StoreInCache(Values, VirtualColumn);

  // 3. Update Dependency Graph with Materialization Status
  UpdateDependencyGraph(VirtualColumn, "Materialized");
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Collaborative Prefetching:** Share prefetch predictions across multiple workbooks and users.
*   **Federated Learning:** Train the prediction model using data from multiple sources without sharing sensitive data.
*   **AI-Powered Optimization:** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the materialization strategy and cache configuration.
