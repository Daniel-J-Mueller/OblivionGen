## Adaptive Packet Mirroring with Intent-Based Analysis

**Specification:** A system for dynamically mirroring network packets based not solely on destination/source, but on *inferred intent* derived from real-time analysis of payload data. This goes beyond simple Deep Packet Inspection (DPI).

**Components:**

*   **Intent Engine:** A machine learning module trained on diverse network traffic patterns and application protocols. It analyzes packet payloads (where permissible and compliant with privacy regulations) to *infer* the user's intended action. Examples: Distinguishing between a legitimate login attempt and a credential stuffing attack, identifying data exfiltration attempts disguised as normal traffic, recognizing command-and-control communication.
*   **Mirroring Controller:**  Manages the mirroring of packets based on instructions from the Intent Engine. It interacts with network devices (switches, routers) to create/modify mirroring sessions.
*   **Analysis Pipeline:** Receives mirrored packets for further, detailed analysis. This could involve Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), or custom analytics tools.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Analysis Pipeline results feed back into the Intent Engine, refining its accuracy and adapting to evolving threat landscapes.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  Network traffic flows through standard network devices.
2.  A 'Sensor' component captures packet headers and (where permissible) payload data.
3.  The Intent Engine analyzes this data.
4.  If the Intent Engine identifies a suspicious or interesting intent (e.g., potential data breach, zero-day exploit), it instructs the Mirroring Controller to initiate a mirroring session.
5.  The Mirroring Controller configures network devices to send copies of relevant packets to the Analysis Pipeline.
6.  The Analysis Pipeline performs detailed analysis.
7.  Analysis Pipeline results are fed back to the Intent Engine for learning and adaptation.

**Pseudocode (Intent Engine):**

```
function analyze_packet(packet):
    header = extract_header(packet)
    payload = extract_payload(packet)

    // Feature extraction
    features = extract_features(header, payload)

    // Intent classification
    intent = classify_intent(features)  // ML model output

    if intent == "suspicious":
        return "mirror"
    else:
        return "do_not_mirror"
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Intent Profile:** Stores learned patterns and features associated with specific intents.
*   **Mirroring Session:** Defines the criteria for mirroring packets (e.g., source/destination IP, port, protocol, intent).

**Scalability:**

*   Distributed Intent Engine: Deploy multiple instances of the Intent Engine across the network.
*   Micro-segmentation: Mirror traffic only within specific network segments.

**Novelty:** Current packet mirroring solutions are largely static and based on predefined rules. This system dynamically adapts to changing network conditions and focuses on *intent*, providing a more proactive and effective security posture. It is not just *what* is happening, but *why*.
