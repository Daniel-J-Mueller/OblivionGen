## Dynamic Browser Persona Shifting

**Concept:** Leverage the split-browser architecture to dynamically alter the browser 'persona' presented to websites, based on probabilistic user modeling and website categorization. This goes beyond simple cookie blocking or user-agent spoofing; it’s about crafting entirely different browsing experiences *per session* for the same user.

**Specifications:**

*   **Persona Database:** Maintain a database of browser ‘personas’. Each persona encapsulates:
    *   JavaScript enablement (true/false)
    *   Cookie acceptance policy (strict, relaxed, none)
    *   WebRTC enablement (true/false)
    *   Canvas fingerprinting resistance level (low, medium, high)
    *   User Agent string (randomized within defined groups)
    *   Font list (subset of available fonts)
    *   Plugin list (simulated or actual, limited)
    *   Preferred languages (subset of user’s languages)
*   **User Modeling Engine:** Employ a probabilistic model to infer user interests, privacy sensitivity, and technical capabilities. Input: browsing history, explicit preferences (if any), time of day, location (optional). Output: probability distribution over persona archetypes (e.g., ‘tech enthusiast’, ‘privacy-conscious’, ‘basic user’).
*   **Website Categorization Engine:** Categorize websites based on content, advertising practices, and tracking behavior. Input: website URL, content analysis, external reputation databases. Output: website category (e.g., ‘news’, ‘social media’, ‘e-commerce’, ‘ad-heavy’).
*   **Persona Selection Logic:**  Based on the user model and website category, select the optimal browser persona.  This selection will not be purely deterministic. Introduce stochasticity.  For example:
    *   `IF (user_model.privacy_sensitivity > 0.7 AND website_category == "ad-heavy") THEN persona = "privacy-focused" WITH probability 0.9`
    *   `ELSE persona = user_model.default_persona WITH probability 0.7, or a randomized persona FROM persona_database WITH probability 0.3`
*   **Split Browser Integration:** The edge node intercepts the browsing request.  Based on the selected persona, the edge node modifies the request headers, disables certain JavaScript features, or alters the browser's fingerprint. The modified request is then forwarded to the server-side browsing engine.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Monitor website behavior in real-time (e.g., tracking scripts detected).  If a website attempts to bypass the persona’s settings, dynamically adjust the persona’s configuration or terminate the connection.

**Pseudocode (Edge Node):**

```
function process_request(request):
  user_model = get_user_model(request.user_id)
  website_category = categorize_website(request.url)
  persona = select_persona(user_model, website_category)

  modified_request = apply_persona(request, persona)

  forward_request(modified_request)
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond simple privacy protections towards a dynamic browsing experience tailored to both user preferences *and* website behavior. It’s about proactive camouflage, not just reactive blocking. It allows for experimentation with website interactions and provides a more nuanced approach to privacy and security. It also enables A/B testing of website interactions to determine if tracking or other behaviors are possible to bypass.
