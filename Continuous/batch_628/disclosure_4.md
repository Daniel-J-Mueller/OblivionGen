## Dynamic Contextualization of Post-Edit Labels

**Concept:** Extend the separation of corrective/improvement post-edits by dynamically contextualizing the labels *during* the post-editing process, leveraging real-time user interaction and cognitive load measurements.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Eye-tracking module integrated with post-editing interface.
    *   Bio-sensor array (EEG/fNIRS preferred) to measure cognitive load (mental effort).
    *   Real-time data processing unit (GPU accelerated).
*   **Software:**
    *   Post-editing interface (compatible with standard CAT tools).
    *   Cognitive Load Analyzer: Algorithm to process bio-sensor data, identifying periods of high cognitive effort during post-editing. Thresholds adjustable per user/language pair.
    *   Eye-Tracking Analyzer: Tracks gaze patterns, dwell time on specific segments, and regressions (re-reading).
    *   Dynamic Labeling Module: Integrates data from Cognitive Load Analyzer, Eye-Tracking Analyzer, and post-edit actions.
    *   Machine Learning Model: Trained on a dataset of post-edited translations, annotated with corrective/improvement labels *and* corresponding cognitive/visual data.  Model predicts the probability of a post-edit being corrective vs. improvement.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  Post-editor receives machine translation output.
    2.  Eye-tracking and bio-sensors actively monitor post-editor during editing.
    3.  As the post-editor makes changes, the system logs:
        *   Edited text segment
        *   Pre-edit and post-edit text
        *   Eye-tracking data (gaze points, dwell time, regressions)
        *   Cognitive load metrics (e.g., EEG band power)
    4.  The Machine Learning Model analyzes this data *in real-time*.
    5.  The Dynamic Labeling Module assigns a probability score indicating whether the post-edit is corrective or improvement-based.
    6.  The probability score is displayed to the post-editor (subtly, to avoid bias) for review.
    7.  Post-editor confirms/corrects the label.  This confirmed label (and associated data) is added to the training set.
    8.  Data is used to refine the Machine Learning Model.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Labeling Module):**

```
function assign_label(edited_segment, pre_edit_text, post_edit_text, eye_tracking_data, cognitive_load_data):
  // Feature Extraction
  features = extract_features(edited_segment, pre_edit_text, post_edit_text, eye_tracking_data, cognitive_load_data)

  // Prediction
  probability = ML_Model.predict(features) // ML_Model outputs probability (0-1) for corrective post-edit

  // Label Assignment (with threshold)
  if probability > 0.7:
    label = "Corrective"
  else:
    label = "Improvement"

  return label
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integrate with speech recognition to capture verbalizations during the post-editing process.
*   Develop personalized models that adapt to individual post-editor styles and cognitive profiles.
*   Use the data to automatically generate training materials for machine translation systems, focusing on common error types.
*   Allow the system to suggest potential improvements to the source content *before* translation, based on recurring patterns in post-edits.
