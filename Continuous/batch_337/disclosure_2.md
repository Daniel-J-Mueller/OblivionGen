## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & Contextual Enrichment

**Concept:** Extend the existing notification system to dynamically prioritize notifications *and* enrich them with contextual data derived from external sources, anticipating user needs *before* they explicitly request information.

**Specification:**

**1. System Architecture Additions:**

*   **Contextual Data Ingestion Service:**  A module responsible for subscribing to and ingesting data from external APIs and data streams (e.g., weather, traffic, social media sentiment related to products, news feeds relevant to order contents, logistics tracking feeds beyond basic shipment status).  This service must support configurable data sources and filtering rules.
*   **Priority Engine:** A machine learning model (trained on user interaction data – clicks, views, delays in responding to notifications, explicit feedback) that assigns a priority score to each notification.  Features include:
    *   Notification type (order confirmation, delay, shipment, etc.).
    *   Item value/importance (determined by order history or user-defined preferences).
    *   Time sensitivity (e.g., an imminent delivery is higher priority).
    *   Contextual factors (see Section 2).
    *   User’s current activity (detected via device sensors – location, motion, app usage – with appropriate privacy safeguards).
*   **Enrichment Module:**  A service that dynamically adds relevant data to notifications based on the Contextual Data Ingestion Service.

**2. Contextual Data Examples:**

*   **Weather:** If an order contains outdoor equipment, a notification about a predicted rainstorm could suggest waterproofing products or offer a delivery reschedule.
*   **Traffic:** If a delivery is scheduled and traffic is heavy near the delivery location, a notification could proactively offer to reschedule or divert to a nearby access point.
*   **Product-Related News:** If a purchased product receives a positive review or a recall notice, a notification could proactively inform the user.
*   **Event Correlation:** If a purchased item is related to an upcoming event (concert tickets, camping gear), a notification could provide event reminders or relevant information.

**3. Notification Flow & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// When a new notification event occurs:

notification_data = {
  type: event_type,
  item_id: item_id,
  order_id: order_id,
  ... other relevant data
}

contextual_data = ContextualDataIngestionService.get_context(notification_data)

priority_score = PriorityEngine.calculate_priority(notification_data, contextual_data)

enriched_notification = EnrichmentModule.enrich(notification_data, contextual_data)

if priority_score > threshold:
  send_notification(enriched_notification, priority_level = priority_score)
else:
  queue_notification(enriched_notification) // For later delivery or consolidation
```

**4. User Customization & Control:**

*   Users should have granular control over which contextual data sources are used and the level of personalization.
*   A “notification preferences” dashboard should allow users to define priority thresholds and customize notification content.
*   Transparency: Users should understand *why* a notification was prioritized or enriched.

**5. Data Storage:**

*   Store user preferences and interaction history in a dedicated database.
*   Cache frequently accessed contextual data to reduce API call latency.
*   Implement robust data privacy and security measures.
