## Dynamic Category Weighting Based on Temporal Data

**Concept:** Augment the existing item categorization system with a dynamic weighting system for item categories, driven by temporal data reflecting user behavior and external trends. This moves beyond static category definitions and allows the system to adapt to evolving product landscapes and user interests.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:**  Item data (title, description, features), User interaction data (views, purchases, saves, search queries), External trend data (social media trends, news articles, seasonal sales data â€“ accessed via APIs).
*   **Processing:**  Real-time data ingestion pipeline. Natural Language Processing (NLP) on item data and external sources to extract keywords and sentiment. Time-series analysis of user interaction data to identify patterns and spikes in category interest.
*   **Output:**  Temporal interest scores for each item category (e.g., "Summer Dresses" score increases during warmer months, "Gaming Laptops" spikes with new game releases). Category trend vectors representing the rate of change in interest.

**2. Category Weighting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Temporal interest scores, Category trend vectors, Static category weights (initial values based on historical data).
*   **Processing:**  A weighting function that combines static and temporal weights.  The function should incorporate a decay factor to prevent overly rapid shifts based on fleeting trends.  Possible weighting function:
    `Weighted Category Score = (Static Weight * Decay Factor) + (Temporal Score * (1 - Decay Factor))`
    Where:
    *   `Decay Factor` is a configurable parameter (e.g., 0.7) that controls the influence of historical data.
    *   `Temporal Score` is normalized to a 0-1 scale.
*   **Output:**  Dynamically adjusted weights for each item category.

**3.  Enhanced Categorization Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Item information (as item vector), Dynamically adjusted category weights, Category vectors (from existing system).
*   **Processing:**  Modify the angle deviation calculation to incorporate category weights.  Instead of simply comparing the angle between the item vector and category vector, a weighted angle deviation is calculated:
    `Weighted Angle Deviation = AngleDeviation * CategoryWeight`
    The category with the *lowest* weighted angle deviation is selected as the recommended category.
*   **Output:**  Recommended category for the item.

**4.  Feedback Loop & Model Training:**

*   **Data:**  User acceptance/rejection of recommended categories.  Conversion rates of items categorized using dynamic weighting versus static weighting.
*   **Process:**  Train a machine learning model (e.g., a reinforcement learning agent) to optimize the weighting function and the decay factor. The model's objective is to maximize conversion rates and user satisfaction.
*   **Output:** Updated weighting function and optimized decay factor.



**Pseudocode (Categorization Algorithm):**

```
function categorizeItem(itemVector, categoryVectors, categoryWeights):
  minDeviation = infinity
  recommendedCategory = null

  for each category in categoryVectors:
    angleDeviation = calculateAngleDeviation(itemVector, categoryVectors[category])
    weightedDeviation = angleDeviation * categoryWeights[category]

    if weightedDeviation < minDeviation:
      minDeviation = weightedDeviation
      recommendedCategory = category

  return recommendedCategory
```
