## Card Holder with Integrated Biofeedback Sensor

**Concept:** A card holder incorporating a capacitive touch sensor to detect grip pressure, coupled with a small haptic feedback actuator. The system aims to provide subtle biofeedback regarding the user's stress levels when handling important cards (credit, ID, access).

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Standard card holder dimensions (85.60 mm × 53.98 mm × 0.76 mm) - compatible with existing wallet slots. Material: Injection molded ABS plastic with a soft-touch coating.
*   **Sensor:** Capacitive touch sensor array integrated into the primary gripping surface (approximately 60mm x 40mm). Resolution: 8x6 grid (48 sensing points). Sample Rate: 20Hz.
*   **Actuator:** Miniature linear resonant actuator (LRA) positioned to provide haptic feedback through the gripping surface. Frequency Range: 100-300Hz. Amplitude Control: PWM-based.
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M0 based microcontroller. Flash Memory: 64KB. RAM: 8KB.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable Lithium Polymer battery (50mAh). Wireless charging capability (Qi standard). Expected battery life: 7 days with moderate use.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Baseline Establishment: During initial setup, the system records grip pressure patterns for a neutral state.
    2.  Real-time Analysis: Continuously monitor grip pressure during card handling.
    3.  Stress Detection: Identify deviations from the baseline. Implement a threshold-based algorithm to detect increased grip pressure indicative of stress.
    4.  Haptic Feedback: When stress is detected, trigger the LRA to provide a subtle vibration pattern. (Example: a slow, rhythmic pulse.)
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data logging and configuration via a companion mobile app.
*   **Companion App Features:**
    *   Baseline Calibration
    *   Sensitivity Adjustment
    *   Data Visualization (grip pressure over time)
    *   Stress Trend Analysis
    *   Customizable Haptic Patterns
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
calibrateBaseline()
setHapticPattern(pattern: "slow_pulse")
setStressThreshold(threshold: 0.7) // Based on baseline deviation

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  gripPressure = readSensorData()
  deviation = calculateDeviation(gripPressure, baseline)

  if (deviation > stressThreshold) {
    activateHaptic(pattern: "slow_pulse")
    logData(timestamp: now(), pressure: gripPressure, stress: true)
  } else {
    logData(timestamp: now(), pressure: gripPressure, stress: false)
  }
  delay(50ms)
}
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   Integration with heart rate variability (HRV) sensors for more accurate stress detection.
*   AI-powered pattern recognition to differentiate between intentional strong grip and stress-induced grip.
*   Customizable haptic patterns based on user preferences.
*   Gamification elements within the companion app to encourage mindful card handling.
