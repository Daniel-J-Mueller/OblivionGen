## Dynamic Dimensionality Adjustment & Adaptive Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the hybrid storage approach by allowing the *dimensionality* of the stored data to dynamically adjust based on query patterns and data density.  Introduce adaptive granularity within the columnar data, moving beyond fixed-size columns to allow variable-length representations and compression tailored to data characteristics.

**Specs:**

**1. Dimensionality Bloom Filter:**
   *   Maintain a "Dimensionality Bloom Filter" alongside the main data hierarchy. This filter tracks which dimensions are actively used in queries over specific regions of the multidimensional space.
   *   The Bloom Filter is updated in real-time as queries are received.
   *   Regions with consistently low Bloom Filter activity (few dimensions used in queries) signal potential dimensionality reduction.

**2. Dimensionality Reduction Mechanism:**
   *   When a region's Bloom Filter indicates low activity, trigger a dimensionality reduction process.
   *   Identify redundant or highly correlated dimensions within that region.
   *   Apply dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, autoencoders, etc.) to project the data onto a lower-dimensional space *specifically for that region*.
   *   Store the transformation matrix (or equivalent representation) alongside the regionâ€™s metadata.
   *   Queries targeting this region must apply the inverse transformation to the query dimensions before searching.

**3. Adaptive Column Granularity:**
   *   Within each leaf node (columnar store), implement variable-length data representation for columns.
   *   Analyze data within the column to determine optimal granularity.  Dense, repeating values can be represented with run-length encoding (RLE) or dictionary encoding.
   *   Sparse data can use more efficient sparse matrix representations.
   *   Metadata stores the encoding scheme and data offsets for each column within the leaf node.

**4. Query Processing Enhancement:**
   *   The query planner analyzes query dimensions and region metadata.
   *   If a region requires dimensionality reduction, the planner applies the inverse transformation to the query dimensions *before* navigating the hierarchy.
   *   The query engine reads the column encoding metadata from the leaf node to decode and process the data correctly.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function processQuery(queryDimensions, regionHierarchy):
  currentRegion = rootRegion

  while (currentRegion is not leafNode):
    // Navigate Hierarchy (existing logic)

  // At Leaf Node:
  leafNodeMetadata = readMetadata(leafNode)
  for each dimension in queryDimensions:
    if (regionMetadata.dimensionalityReductionRequired):
      transformedDimension = applyInverseTransformation(dimension, regionMetadata.transformationMatrix)
      use transformedDimension for searching
    columnEncoding = readColumnEncoding(dimension, leafNodeMetadata)
    decodedValue = decodeValue(value, columnEncoding)
    // Use decodedValue for searching
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DimensionalityBloomFilter`:  Bit array, indexed by dimension ID.
*   `RegionMetadata`: `transformationMatrix`, `dimensionalityReductionRequired`, column encoding information.
*   `ColumnEncoding`: Encoding type (RLE, sparse matrix, etc.), data offsets.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced storage footprint by storing only relevant dimensions.
*   Improved query performance by operating on lower-dimensional data.
*   Adaptive granularity optimizes storage and processing for varying data characteristics.
