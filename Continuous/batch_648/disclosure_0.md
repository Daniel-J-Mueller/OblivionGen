## Multi-User Spatial Audio Beacon System

**Concept:** Extend the distributed voice assistant concept into a localized spatial audio beacon system, allowing for directed audio responses and personalized experiences within a defined space. This goes beyond simple voice interaction; it aims to create an immersive audio environment tailored to individual users *within* the listening area.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Core Unit (Primary Device):**  Similar to the existing primary assistant – multi-microphone array, speaker, processor, network connectivity.  Crucially includes a high-resolution, wide-angle camera with depth sensing (e.g., Time-of-Flight or structured light).
    *   **Satellite Units (Secondary Devices):** Microphone array *only*.  No speakers.  Low power, wireless connectivity (Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee, or custom mesh network).  Small form factor, designed for discreet placement.  Include a directional LED for visual feedback.
    *   **Optional – Wearable Tag:** Small, lightweight tag with a unique identifier.  Can be worn by a user or attached to an object.  Provides precise location data to the system.

*   **Software:**
    *   **User Localization:**  Utilize computer vision (from the Core Unit camera) and/or UWB/Bluetooth triangulation (with Wearable Tags) to determine the real-time location of each user within the space.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering:** Employ beamforming and head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to render audio that appears to originate from a specific point in space *relative to each user*. This means different users can hear slightly different versions of the same audio, localized to their position.
    *   **Voice Activity Detection (VAD) & Source Separation:** Advanced VAD algorithms to identify individual speakers in a multi-person environment. Source separation techniques to isolate and process each voice stream.
    *   **Intent Recognition & Contextual Awareness:**  Standard intent recognition, but enhanced with contextual information derived from user location, activity (e.g., are they near a specific object?), and historical data.
    *   **Dynamic Acoustic Zone Creation:**  The system creates “acoustic zones” around users, effectively isolating their audio interactions. This prevents cross-talk and ensures privacy.
    *   **API for 3rd Party Integration:**  Allow developers to create applications that leverage the spatial audio capabilities.  Imagine a museum guide that whispers information about an exhibit only to the person standing in front of it.

*   **Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
// Main Loop - Runs on Core Unit
while (true) {

  // 1. Capture Audio & Video
  audioData = captureAudio();
  videoData = captureVideo();

  // 2. User Localization
  userLocations = locateUsers(videoData); // Based on computer vision
  // (Alternative: triangulate locations using wearable tags)

  // 3. Voice Activity Detection & Source Separation
  voiceStreams = separateVoiceStreams(audioData, userLocations);

  // 4. Intent Recognition (Per User)
  for each user in userLocations {
    intent = recognizeIntent(voiceStreams[user]);
    // Process intent based on user location & context
  }

  // 5. Spatial Audio Rendering
  for each user in userLocations {
    audioOutput = renderSpatialAudio(intent, user.location);
    playAudio(audioOutput);
  }
}
```

*   **Example Use Cases:**
    *   **Smart Home:**  A voice command to “turn on the lights” only affects the lights in the user’s immediate vicinity.
    *   **Retail:**  Personalized advertisements and product recommendations delivered to shoppers based on their location within the store.
    *   **Museums/Exhibits:**  Interactive audio guides that provide tailored information based on the visitor's position.
    *   **Conference Rooms:**  Automatic voice amplification and noise cancellation for active speakers, with localized audio for remote participants.
    *   **Gaming:** Immersive spatial audio for a more realistic gaming experience.
