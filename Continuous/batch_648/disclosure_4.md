## Dynamic Carrier "Heatmaps" with Predictive Modeling

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing regional carrier rating system by layering predictive modeling onto the map visualizations. Instead of *just* showing historical aggregated ratings, the system will dynamically forecast carrier performance based on real-time network data, user behavior, and external factors.

**Data Inputs:**

*   **Historical Carrier Ratings:** (Existing System) â€“ User submitted ratings, aggregated by region, dimensions (speed, reliability, coverage).
*   **Real-time Network Data:** Utilize partnerships with carriers (or, alternatively, crowdsourced data via a dedicated app) to access live network performance metrics:
    *   Signal Strength (RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ)
    *   Latency
    *   Throughput
    *   Cell Tower Load
    *   Outage Reports
*   **User Behavior Data (Anonymized):**
    *   App Usage Patterns (data-intensive apps vs. light usage)
    *   Mobility Patterns (home, work, commute, travel)
    *   Device Type & Capabilities (5G, 4G, etc.)
*   **External Factors:**
    *   Weather Conditions (rain fade, etc.)
    *   Event Data (concerts, sporting events causing network congestion)
    *   Time of Day/Week (peak/off-peak usage)

**Processing & Predictive Modeling:**

1.  **Data Fusion:** Combine all data inputs into a unified dataset.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features for predictive modeling. Examples:
    *   "Congestion Index" (based on cell tower load and user density)
    *   "Reliability Score" (weighted combination of signal strength, latency, and outage reports)
    *   "Predicted Throughput" (based on signal strength, congestion, and user device capabilities)
3.  **Model Training:** Train machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Networks) to predict carrier performance metrics (throughput, reliability) based on the engineered features.  Separate models can be trained for each carrier and region.
4.  **Real-Time Prediction:**  Apply the trained models to real-time data to generate predicted performance metrics for each carrier in each region.

**Map Visualization Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Heatmaps:**  Instead of static color-coded regions, the map will display dynamically updating heatmaps reflecting predicted carrier performance.  Colors will represent predicted throughput (e.g., green = excellent, yellow = good, red = poor).
*   **Predictive Coverage Layers:**  Overlay layers showing predicted coverage areas for each carrier, taking into account predicted signal strength and interference.
*   **"Time-Shift" Functionality:** Allow users to select a future time (e.g., "show me predicted performance at 6 PM tonight") to visualize how carrier performance is expected to change based on predicted events and usage patterns.
*   **Personalized Predictions:**  Incorporate user-specific data (device type, app usage) into the prediction models to generate personalized performance forecasts.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Flag regions where predicted performance deviates significantly from historical averages, indicating potential network issues.

**System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Data Ingestion Module
function ingestData() {
  fetchHistoricalRatings();
  fetchRealtimeNetworkData();
  fetchUserBehaviorData();
  fetchExternalFactors();
}

// Prediction Module
function predictCarrierPerformance(region, carrier, time) {
  features = extractFeatures(region, carrier, time);
  prediction = model.predict(features);
  return prediction;
}

// Map Visualization Module
function generateMap(region, time) {
  // Retrieve carrier performance predictions for the region and time
  predictions = getCarrierPredictions(region, time);

  // Generate heatmap layers for each carrier
  for (carrier in carriers) {
    heatmap = createHeatmap(carrier, predictions[carrier]);
    addLayerToMap(heatmap);
  }

  // Display map to user
  displayMap();
}

// User Interface Module
function handleUserInteraction() {
  // Allow user to select region and time
  region = getUserSelectedRegion();
  time = getUserSelectedTime();

  // Generate and display map
  generateMap(region, time);
}
```

**Scalability & Deployment:**

*   Cloud-based architecture (AWS, Azure, GCP) to handle large data volumes and processing demands.
*   Microservices architecture for modularity and scalability.
*   RESTful APIs for data ingestion and access.
*   Real-time data streaming using Kafka or similar technology.
