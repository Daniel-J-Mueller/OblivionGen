**Dynamic Payload Partitioning & Adaptive Path Selection (DPAPS)**

**Concept:** Extend the multipath utilization by not just varying header values, but by *dynamically* partitioning a single application data stream across multiple paths *at the payload level*. This allows finer-grained control and potential for truly concurrent data transfer, exceeding simple packet-level steering. Furthermore, introduce a feedback loop that adapts partitioning *during* transmission based on real-time path performance.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Partitioning Engine:**  Located at the source host, integrated with the application or virtualization stack. Responsible for dividing the application data stream into a configurable number of sub-streams.  Partitioning can be byte-level, block-level, or application-defined (e.g., separating video frames).

    ```pseudocode
    function partitionData(dataStream, numPartitions):
        partitionSize = length(dataStream) / numPartitions
        partitions = []
        for i in range(numPartitions):
            start = i * partitionSize
            end = (i + 1) * partitionSize
            partitions.append(dataStream[start:end])
        return partitions
    ```

2.  **Path Performance Monitoring (PPM):** A lightweight agent running on both source and destination hosts. Collects RTT, throughput, and packet loss data for each available path.  Utilizes a moving average algorithm to smooth performance metrics.

    ```pseudocode
    function monitorPath(pathID):
        # Collect RTT, throughput, packet loss
        rtt = measureRTT(pathID)
        throughput = measureThroughput(pathID)
        packetLoss = measurePacketLoss(pathID)

        # Calculate moving average
        avgRTT = (avgRTT * weight + rtt) / (weight + 1)
        avgThroughput = (avgThroughput * weight + throughput) / (weight + 1)
        avgPacketLoss = (avgPacketLoss * weight + packetLoss) / (weight + 1)

        return avgRTT, avgThroughput, avgPacketLoss
    ```

3.  **Dynamic Partitioning & Path Assignment:**  A core algorithm running on the source host.  Periodically (e.g., every 100ms) analyzes PPM data and adjusts partitioning and path assignment.  Utilizes a cost function to minimize transmission time, considering path performance and partitioning overhead.

    ```pseudocode
    function optimizePartitioning(partitions, paths, ppmData):
        costFunction(partitionSize, pathPerformance) = 
            partitionOverhead + (dataSize / totalThroughput) 
        
        bestAssignment = []
        minCost = INFINITY

        for each path in paths:
            cost = costFunction(partitionSize, pathPerformance)
            if cost < minCost:
                minCost = cost
                bestAssignment = [path]

        return bestAssignment
    ```

4.  **Encapsulation & Reassembly:** Encapsulation packets now include a sequence number *and* a partition ID. The destination host reassembles the partitions based on sequence number and partition ID to reconstruct the original data stream.

5. **Adaptive Windowing:** Implement an adaptive windowing mechanism where the number of partitions can dynamically increase or decrease based on network conditions. In stable conditions, fewer partitions can reduce overhead. In congested conditions, more partitions allow for better utilization of available bandwidth.

6. **Congestion Control Integration:**  Integrate with existing congestion control algorithms (e.g., TCP CUBIC, BBR) to provide a more robust and efficient solution. The dynamic partitioning and path selection mechanism can be used to proactively avoid congestion and improve network performance.
