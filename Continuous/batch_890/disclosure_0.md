## Adaptive Resource Allocation via Predictive Failure Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the distributed workload management system with a proactive failure prediction and mitigation component. Instead of *reacting* to host machine failures, the system anticipates them and preemptively redistributes workloads.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Failure Prediction Module:**
    *   **Data Collection:** Each host machine continuously streams system metrics (CPU usage, memory pressure, disk I/O, network latency, temperature) to a centralized (but redundant) prediction service.
    *   **Model Training:** The prediction service utilizes machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks) trained on historical system metric data to predict the probability of failure for each host machine over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 15 minutes).  Models are continuously retrained with new data to improve accuracy.  Multiple model types are employed, with a consensus mechanism to reduce bias.
    *   **Risk Threshold:**  A configurable risk threshold determines when a host machine is considered likely to fail.  Threshold is dynamically adjusted based on workload criticality.
2.  **Proactive Workload Redistribution:**
    *   **Trigger:** When the failure prediction module indicates a high probability of failure for a host machine, the system initiates a workload redistribution process *before* the host actually fails.
    *   **Workload Identification:** The system queries the data store to identify all workloads currently assigned to the predicted failing host.
    *   **Candidate Host Selection:**  An algorithm selects candidate host machines with sufficient available capacity to absorb the workloads. Criteria include:
        *   Available CPU/Memory
        *   Network proximity to original host
        *   Current workload
        *   Historical stability (derived from the failure prediction module)
    *   **Workload Migration:** Workloads are migrated to the selected candidate hosts. This is done incrementally, prioritizing less critical tasks first.  Checksums are employed to ensure data integrity.
    *   **Data Store Update:** The data store is updated to reflect the new workload assignments.
3.  **Dynamic Capacity Adjustment:**
    *   **Historical Analysis:** The system maintains a historical record of workload migration patterns and resource utilization.
    *   **Capacity Prediction:** Using this data, the system predicts future capacity needs based on anticipated workload fluctuations and potential failures.
    *   **Resource Provisioning (Optional):** Based on capacity predictions, the system can automatically request additional resources (e.g., virtual machines) from a cloud provider.
4.  **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The failure prediction module and proactive workload redistribution system are designed as modular components that can be easily integrated with the existing distributed workload management system.
    *   Communication between components is done via a message queue.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Redistribution):**

```
// Host Failure Prediction Module
function predict_failure(host_id, metrics) {
  // Run metrics through trained ML model
  failure_probability = ML_Model.predict(metrics)
  return failure_probability
}

// Workload Redistribution Function
function redistribute_workload(host_id) {
  workloads = DataStore.get_workloads_for_host(host_id)
  candidate_hosts = ResourceSelector.find_candidate_hosts(workloads)

  for each workload in workloads {
    target_host = select_best_host(candidate_hosts, workload)
    DataStore.update_workload_assignment(workload, target_host)
    // Initiate data migration (implementation detail)
  }
}

// Main Loop (on each host)
while (true) {
  metrics = collect_system_metrics()
  failure_probability = predict_failure(host_id, metrics)

  if (failure_probability > threshold) {
    redistribute_workload(host_id)
    // Optionally: Mark host as 'degrading' and reduce new workload assignment
  }
  sleep(60 seconds)
}
```
