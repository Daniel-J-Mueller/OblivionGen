**Holographic Projection Screen with Dynamic Texture Mapping**

**Concept:** Expand the multi-surface projection concept to include a dynamically altering holographic projection surface. Instead of discrete surfaces, create a projection screen capable of *becoming* different surfaces, textures, and even basic 3D forms.

**Specs:**

*   **Screen Material:** Layered metamaterial composed of micro-LEDs, shape-memory polymers, and a transparent conductive polymer matrix. The micro-LEDs provide the light source for projection. The shape-memory polymers enable physical deformation of the surface. The conductive polymer distributes power and acts as a structural component.
*   **Deformation Control:** An array of micro-actuators integrated beneath the metamaterial surface. These actuators precisely control the deformation of the shape-memory polymers, creating variable surface topology.
*   **Texture Mapping System:**  Software system capable of receiving input – either pre-programmed or real-time generated – describing a desired surface texture or topology. This input is translated into actuator commands.
*   **Projection System Integration:**  The existing projector system is modified to include a depth sensor (e.g., time-of-flight camera) that maps the current screen topology. Projection is then warped and adjusted to account for the shape, creating a seamless projected image.
*   **Surface Calibration:** Automatic calibration routine to map actuator positions to screen coordinates, ensuring accurate texture replication.
*   **Power/Data Management:** Low-voltage power distribution network for micro-LEDs and actuators. High-speed data communication bus for actuator control.

**Pseudocode (Texture Mapping Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION CreateTexture(texture_data):
  // texture_data: 3D array defining desired surface height map
  FOR each point (x, y) in texture_data:
    height = texture_data[x][y]
    CalculateActuatorPositions(x, y, height) // Determines actuator displacements
    SendActuatorCommands(x, y, actuator_positions) // Sends commands to micro-actuators

FUNCTION CalculateActuatorPositions(x, y, height):
    // Use a mesh deformation algorithm (e.g., radial basis functions)
    // to determine the optimal actuator displacements to achieve the desired height.
    // Considerations: actuator range of motion, spring constant, mesh density

FUNCTION SendActuatorCommands(x, y, actuator_positions):
    // Send commands to the micro-actuators via the data communication bus.
    // Implement error correction and feedback mechanisms.

FUNCTION UpdateProjection(depth_map):
    // Uses the depth map captured from the depth sensor to warp and adjust the projected image
    // to account for the screen’s current shape.
    // Applies perspective correction and keystone correction.
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive gaming with dynamically changing terrain
*   Holographic displays with realistic textures
*   Architectural visualization with deformable building models
*   Medical imaging with 3D anatomical models
*   Remote training applications with hands-on simulations
