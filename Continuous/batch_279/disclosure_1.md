## Dynamic Workflow Composition via Predictive Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the workflow template approach to proactively *compose* workflows based on predicted user behavior and resource availability, moving beyond static templates to a fluid, self-optimizing system.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Behavioral Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: User activity logs (API calls, database queries, resource consumption), time of day, day of week, system load metrics.
    *   Process: Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict short-term (5-15 minute) resource demands and likely actions (e.g., scaling, replication, specific query types). Output a probability distribution over potential workflows.
    *   Output: Ranked list of potential workflows, each with an associated confidence score.

*   **Component 2: Resource Availability Monitor:**
    *   Input: Real-time system metrics (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, storage I/O), cost data for different resources (e.g., spot instances vs. on-demand).
    *   Process: Assess current resource availability and project future capacity based on predicted demand from *all* users.  Model resource costs.
    *   Output: Resource availability profile with associated cost estimates.

*   **Component 3: Workflow Composer:**
    *   Input: Ranked workflow list (from Behavioral Prediction Engine), resource availability profile (from Resource Availability Monitor), user authorization data (from the existing system).
    *   Process:
        1.  Filter workflows based on user authorization.
        2.  Score each valid workflow based on:
            *   Probability (from Behavioral Prediction Engine)
            *   Resource availability (higher score for workflows that fit available resources)
            *   Cost (lower score for more expensive workflows)
        3.  Select the highest-scoring workflow.  If no workflow meets minimum resource requirements, trigger a pre-defined fallback (e.g., request additional resources, queue the request).
        4.  Dynamically assemble the workflow from pre-defined task components.

*   **Component 4: Adaptive Workflow Execution:**
    *   Monitor workflow execution in real-time.
    *   If performance degrades or resource constraints emerge during execution, re-evaluate workflow options based on current conditions and dynamically switch to an alternative workflow.
    *   Log all workflow decisions (chosen workflow, reasons for switching, performance metrics) for model training and optimization.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Composer):**

```
function ComposeWorkflow(user, request, predictedWorkflows, resourceAvailability):
  filteredWorkflows = FilterWorkflowsByUser(predictedWorkflows, user)
  scoredWorkflows = ScoreWorkflows(filteredWorkflows, resourceAvailability)
  bestWorkflow = SelectBestWorkflow(scoredWorkflows)

  if bestWorkflow == null:
    //Handle resource contention - trigger fallback action.
    FallbackAction(user, request)
    return null

  assembledWorkflow = AssembleWorkflow(bestWorkflow)
  return assembledWorkflow
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Workflow`: A list of `Task` objects with dependencies.
*   `Task`:  Defines a unit of work (e.g., database query, scaling operation) with resource requirements, execution parameters, and output data.
*   `Score`: A numerical value representing the desirability of a workflow.
*   `ResourceProfile`: A record of available resources and associated costs.
