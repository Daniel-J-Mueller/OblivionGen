## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend directional audio processing beyond simple signal weighting to create a dynamic, synthesized acoustic environment tailored to the user’s location and activity. This moves beyond simple cancellation and towards *proactive* soundscape control.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-density microphone array (64+ mics) for precise sound source localization and beamforming.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 9-axis accelerometer/gyroscope – for head/body tracking.
    *   Compact depth camera (ToF or structured light) to map surrounding environment.
    *   Ambient light sensor for contextual awareness.

2.  **Mapping Module:**
    *   Real-time 3D map construction of the surrounding environment using depth camera data.
    *   Acoustic material identification (wood, glass, fabric) based on impulse response analysis.  This is performed at discrete points in the environment.
    *   Sound source localization using microphone array and beamforming. Identify static vs. dynamic sources.
    *   Dynamic acoustic map – overlays identified materials and sound sources onto the 3D map.  Stores impulse responses for each material.

3.  **Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Based on the dynamic acoustic map, the synthesis engine simulates sound propagation.
    *   Ray tracing algorithms to model sound reflections, diffractions, and absorptions.
    *   Generative acoustic model: Use a pre-trained neural network (e.g., Variational Autoencoder) to create realistic ambient soundscapes. Training data should be diverse room impulse responses and ambient noise recordings.
    *   User activity recognition: Use IMU data to determine the user's activity (standing, walking, talking, etc.) and adjust the synthesized soundscape accordingly.
    *   Personalized acoustic profiles: Allow users to customize their preferred acoustic environments.

4.  **Output & Control:**
    *   Directional audio rendering:  Use the microphone array for both input capture and directional audio playback.  This will allow for simulated sound sources to originate from any point in the environment.
    *   Acoustic "zones": Define regions in the environment where specific acoustic characteristics are applied.
    *   "Acoustic shaping":  Adjust the synthesized soundscape to enhance specific frequencies or reduce noise levels in specific areas.
    *   Interface: Control via voice commands, mobile app, or physical controls.

**Pseudocode (Synthesis Engine Core):**

```
function synthesizeSoundscape(userLocation, activity, acousticMap, desiredAcousticProfile) {
  // 1. Determine relevant sound sources and reflections
  relevantSources = findSourcesWithinRadius(userLocation, acousticMap)
  reflections = calculateReflections(userLocation, relevantSources, acousticMap)

  // 2. Generate ambient soundscape
  ambientSound = generateAmbientSound(acousticMap, desiredAcousticProfile)

  // 3. Combine direct sound, reflections, and ambient sound
  combinedSound = combineSounds(directSound, reflections, ambientSound)

  // 4. Apply directional rendering
  directionalSound = renderDirectionalSound(combinedSound, userLocation)

  return directionalSound
}

function combineSounds(directSound, reflections, ambientSound) {
  // Apply time delays, amplitude scaling, and filtering based on distance, material properties, and user preferences
  // Use a mixing algorithm to combine the different sound components
  // Consider using a physically-based sound model for more realistic results
}
```

**Novelty:** This design departs from simple echo cancellation and acoustic beamforming to actively create and manipulate the sonic environment around the user. It’s not about *removing* sound, but about *shaping* it. The system proactively constructs a synthesized soundscape based on environmental mapping, user activity, and personalized preferences.
