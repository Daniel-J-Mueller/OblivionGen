## Dynamic Shard Migration Based on Workload Prediction

**Concept:** Proactively migrate data shards *between* compute nodes based on predicted workload, not just splitting within a node. This allows for resource equalization *across* the cluster and anticipates bottlenecks before they occur, moving beyond static assignment.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Workload Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Historical request logs (key access patterns, request frequency, data size). Real-time request monitoring. Node resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O).
    *   Algorithm: Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future request load for each shard.  Consider seasonality and trends in access patterns.  Factor in data growth rate.
    *   Output: Predicted request load (requests/second) and resource requirement (CPU cycles, memory usage, I/O bandwidth) for each shard over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day).

2.  **Resource Availability Monitor:**
    *   Continuously monitor resource utilization on all compute nodes.
    *   Calculate available capacity (CPU, memory, I/O) for each node.
    *   Implement a "cost" function for each node, factoring in both current utilization *and* projected future utilization.  Nodes nearing capacity have higher costs.

3.  **Shard Migration Orchestrator:**
    *   Input: Predicted shard load, node resource availability, node costs.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   Periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) assess the cluster state.
        *   For each shard:
            *   Identify the *n* most suitable destination nodes based on:
                *   Lowest cost (calculated from resource availability and predicted future utilization).
                *   Network latency between the source and destination nodes.
                *   Data locality (favor nodes already storing related shards).
            *   Calculate a "migration score" for each destination node, weighting factors like cost, latency, and data locality.
            *   If the migration score for a destination node is below a threshold, initiate a migration plan.
    *   Migration Plan:
        *   Determine the data transfer method (e.g., incremental copy, snapshot transfer).
        *   Establish a data consistency mechanism (e.g., two-phase commit, Raft-based replication).
        *   Update the global key table to redirect requests to the new shard location.
        *   Monitor the migration progress and handle failures gracefully.

4.  **Key Table Update Mechanism:**
    *   The global key table is partitioned and distributed across a set of metadata servers.
    *   Update operations are performed using a consistent hashing algorithm to minimize disruption.
    *   Metadata servers utilize a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Paxos, Raft) to ensure data consistency.
    *   Front-end nodes cache key-location mappings to reduce latency.

**Pseudocode (Shard Migration Orchestrator):**

```
FOR EACH shard IN shards:
    predictedLoad = WorkloadPredictionModule.predictLoad(shard)
    candidateNodes = []
    FOR EACH node IN nodes:
        cost = ResourceAvailabilityMonitor.calculateCost(node)
        latency = NetworkMonitor.getLatency(shard.sourceNode, node)
        dataLocality = DataLocalityAnalyzer.calculateScore(shard, node)
        score = cost * weightCost + latency * weightLatency + dataLocality * weightDataLocality
        candidateNodes.append((node, score))
    candidateNodes.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  // Sort by score
    bestNode = candidateNodes[0][0]

    IF bestNode != shard.sourceNode:
        migrationPlan = MigrationPlanner.createPlan(shard, bestNode)
        IF migrationPlan.isValid():
            MigrationExecutor.executePlan(migrationPlan)
            updateKeyTable(shard, bestNode)
```

**Considerations:**

*   This system adds complexity to the storage service.
*   The accuracy of workload prediction is critical.
*   Migration operations can impact performance.
*   Robust error handling and failure recovery mechanisms are essential.
*   The weighting of factors in the migration score needs to be tuned based on the specific workload and infrastructure.
