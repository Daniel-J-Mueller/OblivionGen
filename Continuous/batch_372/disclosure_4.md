## Dynamic Contextual Overlay System

**Concept:** A display system that generates and displays animated graphical overlays reacting to *ambient* environmental data, not just user interaction. This goes beyond simple brightness adjustments.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate an array of sensors – microphone (sound analysis), temperature, humidity, air quality (VOCs, CO2), light level (ambient color temperature & intensity), and a miniature barometer.
*   **Data Processing Unit:** Dedicated onboard processor (or cloud connectivity optional) to analyze sensor data in real-time.  Algorithms to correlate sensor readings with a library of pre-designed animated graphical elements.
*   **Graphical Element Library:** A diverse collection of animations categorized by emotional/environmental association. Examples:
    *   High humidity -> subtle water droplet animation on screen edges.
    *   Loud, sharp sound -> brief, stylized “shockwave” ripple across the display.
    *   Low temperature ->  "frost" effect appearing on static UI elements.
    *   High CO2 -> subtle swirling particulate animation.
    *   Specific ambient color detected (e.g., red) -> Color cast on the entire display.
    *   Barometric pressure drop -> Subtle animation suggesting impending weather (clouds, wind).
*   **Overlay System:** The system must dynamically generate and composite these animated elements *on top of* whatever the primary display content is.
*   **Opacity Control:** Each overlay element has adjustable opacity and blending modes.  The opacity should modulate based on the *intensity* of the triggering sensor reading.  Example:  Slight humidity = very faint droplet animation. High humidity = more prominent.
*   **Customization:** User selectable "themes" affecting the overall style and intensity of the ambient overlays. Themes could be "Minimalist", "Dramatic", "Subtle", etc.
*   **“Calibration” Mode:** A learning algorithm that adjusts the overlay generation based on user preferences and environment. If a user consistently dismisses an overlay type, its frequency is reduced.
*   **Animation Style:** Abstract, minimalist designs. Avoid realistic renderings. The goal is to *suggest* an environmental condition, not simulate it. Think particles, flowing lines, color washes, and subtle distortions.
*   **Pseudocode (Data Processing):**

```
FUNCTION processSensorData()
  sensorData = readAllSensors()
  
  IF sensorData.humidity > threshold_high THEN
    overlayType = "water_droplets"
    opacity = map(sensorData.humidity, threshold_high, max_humidity, 0.2, 1.0)
    generateOverlay(overlayType, opacity)
  ENDIF

  IF sensorData.soundLevel > threshold_loud THEN
    overlayType = "shockwave"
    opacity = map(sensorData.soundLevel, threshold_loud, max_sound, 0.1, 0.5)
    generateOverlay(overlayType, opacity)
  ENDIF

  // Repeat for other sensors...

END FUNCTION
