## Adaptive Snapshotting with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the manifest index to not only identify data location but also predict *future* data access patterns. This allows for proactive prefetching of snapshot blocks, minimizing latency during data retrieval, especially for sequential or predictable workloads.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Access Pattern Monitoring:** Implement a monitoring agent that tracks block access patterns within the block storage volume *before* snapshot creation. This agent collects data on sequential reads, random access, and access frequency.  Data is timestamped and aggregated.

2.  **Predictive Manifest Index:** The manifest index is augmented with a “Prefetch Hint” field for each manifest entry (or group of entries). This hint indicates a probability score (0.0 - 1.0) representing the likelihood of the associated blocks being accessed *soon* (defined by a configurable time window – e.g., the next 5 seconds, 10 seconds). The probability is calculated from the historical access pattern data collected by the monitoring agent.  The higher the score, the more likely prefetching is recommended.

3.  **Prefetching Daemon:** A daemon runs on the system responsible for serving requests for snapshot data. It intercepts requests, examines the manifest index entry for the requested block(s), and if the “Prefetch Hint” exceeds a configurable threshold, initiates a background prefetch of the associated data blocks *before* the client actually requests them.  Prefetched blocks are cached in a dedicated, high-speed buffer (e.g., NVMe SSD).

4.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The prefetch threshold is not static. It dynamically adjusts based on observed system load and cache hit rates.  A control loop monitors cache performance; if hit rates are low and latency is high, the threshold is lowered to increase prefetching; if cache is full or load is high, the threshold is raised to reduce prefetching.

5.  **Adaptive Windowing:** The "soon" time window used for prefetching can be adjusted based on the type of workload. For example:
    *   **Sequential Workloads (e.g., video editing):** Larger window – prefetch a larger sequence of blocks.
    *   **Random Access Workloads (e.g., database):** Smaller window – prefetch only a few blocks at a time.

6.  **Pseudocode – Prefetching Daemon:**

```
function handle_request(block_id):
    manifest_entry = get_manifest_entry(block_id)
    prefetch_hint = manifest_entry.prefetch_hint

    if prefetch_hint > prefetch_threshold:
        # Initiate background prefetch
        prefetch_blocks(manifest_entry.blocks)

    # Retrieve data from cache or object storage
    data = get_data(block_id)
    return data

function prefetch_blocks(blocks):
    for block in blocks:
        if block not in cache:
            fetch_from_object_storage(block)
            add_to_cache(block)

function adjust_prefetch_threshold():
    cache_hit_rate = calculate_cache_hit_rate()
    system_load = get_system_load()

    if cache_hit_rate < threshold_low and system_load < threshold_low:
        prefetch_threshold = max(prefetch_threshold - step_size, min_threshold)
    elif cache_hit_rate > threshold_high and system_load > threshold_high:
        prefetch_threshold = min(prefetch_threshold + step_size, max_threshold)
```

7.  **Manifest Index Data Structure Update:**  Each entry/group of entries in the manifest index now includes: `block_id(s)`, `object_location`, `checksum`, `prefetch_hint`.
