## Dynamic Threat Model Stitching for Federated Services

**Concept:** Extend the machine-readable threat model concept to a *federated* environment where multiple service providers interoperate. Instead of each provider maintaining a siloed threat model, create a system where threat model "stitches" are dynamically created and updated based on service interactions. This goes beyond simple API security and encompasses entire service compositions.

**Specification:**

**1. Component Definitions:**

*   **Threat Model Fragments (TMFs):**  Small, self-contained machine-readable threat models representing individual service components or APIs.  Include assets, vulnerabilities, threats, and mitigations.  Format: JSON-LD or similar semantic web standard.
*   **Interaction Specifiers (ISs):**  Descriptions of how services interact â€“ data flow, control flow, dependencies.  Define interfaces and expected behavior.  Format:  GraphQL schema or OpenAPI.
*   **Stitching Engine (SE):** A central component responsible for composing TMFs based on ISs.
*   **Federation Manager (FM):** Handles authentication, authorization, and trust relationships between service providers.
*   **Dynamic Analyzer (DA):** Observes runtime service interactions to validate and refine the stitched threat model.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Registration:** Service providers register their TMFs with the FM.  Each TMF includes metadata about its scope, version, and trust level.
2.  **Composition Request:** When a new service composition is created (e.g., a chain of APIs), a request is sent to the SE.
3.  **Threat Model Stitching:** The SE:
    *   Retrieves relevant TMFs based on the service composition.
    *   Uses ISs to understand how the services interact.
    *   Combines TMFs, resolving conflicts and creating a unified threat model.  Focuses on identifying attack surfaces created by the interaction.
    *   Generates a composite threat model.
4.  **Validation & Refinement:** The DA observes the runtime behavior of the composed service. It:
    *   Detects deviations from the expected interaction patterns defined in the ISs.
    *   Identifies new attack vectors based on runtime observations.
    *   Updates the composite threat model and notifies the SE.
5.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The stitched threat model is continuously monitored and updated based on runtime behavior and new threat intelligence.

**3. Pseudocode (Stitching Engine - Simplified):**

```
function stitchThreatModels(serviceComposition, registeredTMFs):
  compositeThreatModel = new ThreatModel()

  for service in serviceComposition:
    tmf = findTMFByServiceID(service.id, registeredTMFs)
    if tmf:
      compositeThreatModel.addAssets(tmf.assets)
      compositeThreatModel.addVulnerabilities(tmf.vulnerabilities)
      compositeThreatModel.addThreats(tmf.threats)
      compositeThreatModel.addMitigations(tmf.mitigations)

  # Resolve conflicts & identify interaction-specific threats
  for interaction in serviceComposition.interactions:
    # Analyze data flow and control flow
    interactionThreats = analyzeInteraction(interaction)
    compositeThreatModel.addThreats(interactionThreats)

  return compositeThreatModel
```

**4. Data Structures (Example - Simplified):**

*   **ThreatModel:** `{assets: [], vulnerabilities: [], threats: [], mitigations: []}`
*   **Interaction:** `{sourceService: "A", destinationService: "B", dataFlow: "JSON", controlFlow: "HTTP"}`
*   **Threat:** `{name: "SQL Injection", severity: "High", affectedAsset: "Database"}`

**5. Innovation:**

This system moves beyond static threat modeling to a dynamic, federated approach. It allows for more accurate and up-to-date threat assessments in complex, distributed environments. It focuses on *interactions* between services as the primary source of new threats, rather than individual component vulnerabilities. This is critical in modern microservices architectures. The observation and refinement loop based on runtime behavior ensures the threat model remains relevant and effective over time.
