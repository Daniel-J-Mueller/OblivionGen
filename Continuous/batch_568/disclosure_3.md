## Real-Time Contention Heatmaps & Predictive Pre-Reads

**Specification:** Implement a system to visualize database contention in real-time as a ‘heatmap’ overlaid onto a representation of the data schema, coupled with a predictive pre-read mechanism.

**Core Concept:**  Extend the existing rejection cause descriptor analysis to drive a dynamic, visual representation of contention *and* proactively fetch potentially conflicting data *before* transactions attempt to access it.

**Components:**

1.  **Contention Heatmap Generator:**
    *   Input: Rejection cause descriptors, write descriptors, transaction latency data.
    *   Process:
        *   Aggregate contention data by data object (key, table, etc.).
        *   Assign a ‘heat’ value based on frequency of conflicts, transaction latency impact, and recency.
        *   Render a visual representation of the database schema.  Data objects are colored/shaded according to their heat value – red for high contention, green for low.  Interactive zoom and filtering are required.
        *   Display updated every 1-5 seconds.

2.  **Predictive Pre-Read Engine:**
    *   Input: Rejection cause descriptors, current active transactions (read sets).
    *   Process:
        *   Analyze rejection cause descriptors to identify frequently conflicting data objects/keys.
        *   Monitor active transaction read sets.
        *   If a transaction's read set includes a data object with high predicted contention (based on historical rejection data), proactively fetch that data *before* the transaction attempts to access it.  This data is cached locally (client-side, or a dedicated caching tier).
        *   Use optimistic concurrency control – if the cached data is stale, revert to standard access.
    *   Configuration:  Administrators can tune the sensitivity of the pre-read engine (e.g., only pre-read for transactions exceeding a certain latency threshold).

3.  **API Integration:**
    *   Expose an API endpoint to retrieve contention heatmap data for integration with monitoring dashboards and alerting systems.
    *   API endpoint to adjust pre-read sensitivity and configuration.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Pre-Read Engine):**

```pseudocode
function process_transaction(transaction):
  read_set = transaction.get_read_set()
  for object in read_set:
    contention_score = get_contention_score(object) // From historical rejection data
    if contention_score > threshold:
      cached_data = cache.get(object)
      if cached_data is null:
        cached_data = database.read(object)
        cache.put(object, cached_data)
      transaction.use_cached_data(object, cached_data)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Contention Metric:**  {object_id, conflict_count, latency_impact, last_updated}
*   **Cache Entry:** {object_id, data, timestamp}

**Deployment:**

*   Contention Heatmap Generator & Predictive Pre-Read Engine can be deployed as a separate microservice alongside the existing database and analytics tools.
*   Requires access to transaction logs and database schema information.

**Expected Outcome:**

*   Improved database performance by reducing contention and latency.
*   Proactive identification of contention hotspots.
*   Enhanced user experience through faster transaction processing.
