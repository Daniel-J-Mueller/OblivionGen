## Gift Card Assembly - Interactive Augmented Reality Layer

**Concept:** Integrate a persistent Augmented Reality (AR) experience triggered by the gift card assembly. This goes beyond simple sticker decoration and aims for a mini-game or interactive story tied to the gift card's value or recipient.

**Specs:**

1.  **AR Marker Integration:** The tear strip incorporates a uniquely patterned AR marker (similar to QR code but more visually discreet – potentially a repeating, embossed pattern). This marker is *not* solely for identification; it's the foundation of the AR experience.
2.  **App Integration:** A dedicated mobile app (iOS & Android) scans the AR marker on the assembled gift card. The app's functionality is tied to the gift card's activation (e.g., scanning the card number *after* the AR experience is initiated).
3.  **Dynamic Content:** The AR experience isn't static.  Content is determined by:
    *   **Gift Card Value:** Lower values trigger simpler AR interactions (e.g., a short animation, a coupon). Higher values unlock more complex mini-games or story chapters.
    *   **Recipient Profile (Optional):** If user opts-in, the app links to social media (with permission) to tailor the AR experience. Example: If the recipient likes cats, the AR experience features cat-themed animations/mini-games.
    *   **Occasion (Optional):**  App asks what occasion the card is for (Birthday, Holiday, Thank You). Content adjusts accordingly.
4.  **Mini-Game Examples:**
    *   **Value-Based Puzzle:**  The gift card value dictates the complexity of a digital puzzle within the AR environment. Completing the puzzle reveals a bonus offer or unlocks further AR content.
    *   **Digital Scavenger Hunt:** AR markers on the sticker and card create waypoints for a digital scavenger hunt within the recipient’s environment (using the phone's camera).
    *   **AR Story Chapter:** The gift card unlocks a chapter of an ongoing AR story. Future gift cards unlock subsequent chapters.
5.  **Sticker Functionality:** The sticker is *not* merely decorative. It incorporates a touch-sensitive capacitive element.
    *   **Interactive Story Choice:** Tapping the sticker allows the recipient to make choices within the AR story, influencing the narrative.
    *   **Mini-Game Control:** Sticker functions as a joystick or button for controlling the AR mini-game.
6.  **Tear Strip Functionality:** The tear strip is crucial for progression.
    *   **AR Marker Reveal:** Tearing the strip reveals a secondary AR marker. Scanning this new marker unlocks a bonus feature or advances the story.
    *   **Physical/Digital Connection:** The act of tearing the strip is integrated into the AR experience – perhaps a digital ‘key’ is ‘unlocked’ as the physical strip is torn.
7.  **Persistence:** AR experiences are saved to the user's account for later access, fostering long-term engagement.

**Pseudocode (App Logic):**

```
FUNCTION ScanGiftCard():
  SCAN AR Marker on Gift Card Assembly
  GET GiftCardID, Value
  IF GiftCardID is valid AND Value > 0:
    DISPLAY AR Experience based on Value & (Optional) Recipient Profile/Occasion
    SET IsActivated = FALSE
  ELSE:
    DISPLAY Error Message

FUNCTION ActivateGiftCard():
  GET CardNumber
  VALIDATE CardNumber
  IF CardNumber is valid:
    SET IsActivated = TRUE
    UNLOCK full AR Experience features
  ELSE:
    DISPLAY Error Message

FUNCTION HandleStickerTap():
  IF IsActivated:
    SEND StickerTapEvent to AR Engine (triggers action within AR experience)
  ELSE:
    DISPLAY Prompt to Activate Gift Card
