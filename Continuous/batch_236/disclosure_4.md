## Modular Tablet with Haptic Feedback Zones

**Concept:** A tablet computing device constructed from interconnected, geometrically-shaped modules. Each module contains processing, display, and haptic feedback capabilities. Users can physically reconfigure the tablet's size, shape, and function by connecting/disconnecting modules.

**Module Specifications:**

*   **Shape:** Hexagonal prism (approx. 2cm height, 8cm side-to-side). Other polyhedral shapes (tetrahedral, octahedral) explored during prototyping.
*   **Display:** Flexible OLED, covering five of six faces. Resolution: 200x80 pixels per face.
*   **Processor:** ARM Cortex-A72 (quad-core, 2.4 GHz). Each module functions as a distributed processing unit.
*   **RAM:** 4GB LPDDR4
*   **Storage:** 32GB eMMC
*   **Connectivity:** Magnetic interlocking system with data/power transfer contacts. Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 6.
*   **Haptics:** Array of piezoelectric actuators embedded within each face, enabling localized haptic feedback. Intensity and pattern programmable via API.
*   **Power:** Internal rechargeable lithium-polymer battery (2000 mAh). Wireless charging capability via module edges.
*   **Materials:** Lightweight magnesium alloy chassis with a durable, scratch-resistant polymer coating.

**Interconnection System:**

*   **Magnetic Locking:** High-strength neodymium magnets secure modules together. Orientation guides integrated into module edges.
*   **Data/Power Transfer:** Conductive pads on module edges establish data and power connections when modules are connected.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Custom protocol optimized for low-latency, high-bandwidth communication between modules.

**Software/API:**

*   **Modular OS:** OS designed to dynamically adapt to the tablet’s configuration.
*   **Haptic API:** Allows developers to program complex haptic patterns for various applications.
*   **Shape Recognition API:** Detects the tablet’s current configuration and adjusts the UI accordingly.
*   **Distributed Processing API:** Enables applications to leverage the processing power of all connected modules.

**Possible Configurations:**

*   **Standard Tablet:** 6-8 modules connected in a rectangular arrangement.
*   **Laptop Mode:** Modules arranged in a clamshell configuration with a flexible display spanning the open faces.
*   **Gaming Mode:** Modules arranged in a gamepad configuration with dedicated buttons and joysticks.
*   **Foldable Display:** Modules arranged in a linear fashion to create a large, flexible display.

**Pseudocode (Shape Recognition):**

```
function recognizeShape(moduleGrid) {
  // moduleGrid is a 2D array representing the connected modules
  width = moduleGrid.length
  height = moduleGrid[0].length

  if (width == 6 && height == 1) {
    return "Linear Display"
  } else if (width == 4 && height == 2) {
    return "Standard Tablet"
  } else if (width == 8 && height == 1) {
      return "Folded Display"
  } else {
    return "Custom Configuration"
  }
}
```

**Further Explorations:**

*   Modular camera sensors that can be attached to any module face.
*   Interchangeable battery modules with varying capacities.
*   AI-powered shape optimization to suggest configurations based on user needs.
*   Haptic feedback synchronization across multiple modules to create immersive experiences.
