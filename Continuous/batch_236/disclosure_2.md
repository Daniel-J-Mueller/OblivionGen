## Dynamic Pricing & Personalized Device Customization

**Concept:** Extend dynamic pricing not just to service plans, but to device *features* and physical customizations, offering a fully personalized device price tailored to predicted user behavior and willingness to pay for specific functionalities.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Profiling Engine:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User browsing history (device models viewed, feature comparisons).
    *   Service plan preferences (data usage, talk time, hotspot needs).
    *   Demographic data (age, location - optional, user consent required).
    *   Social media activity (optional, user consent required – inferred preferences).
    *   App usage patterns (data from app stores with consent, or inferred via network traffic analysis - anonymized).
*   **Processing:** Machine learning models (collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, neural networks) to predict:
    *   Likelihood of using specific device features (camera, NFC, 5G, advanced audio).
    *   Price sensitivity for different features.
    *   Preferred aesthetic customizations (color, material, engravings).
*   **Output:** A user profile containing a weighted score for each feature/customization indicating predicted value.

**2. Feature/Customization Catalog:**

*   Database of all available device features (hardware, software).
*   Database of customization options (colors, materials, engravings, pre-installed apps).
*   Associated cost for each feature/customization (base cost + markup based on demand/scarcity).

**3. Dynamic Price Calculation Engine:**

*   **Input:** User profile (from Behavioral Profiling Engine), Feature/Customization Catalog.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Base Device Price (standard model).
    2.  Feature Adjustment: For each feature, multiply the cost by the user's weighted score for that feature.  If the score is low, reduce or remove the cost.  If high, increase it.
    3.  Customization Adjustment: Apply a similar weighted score to customization options.
    4.  Service Plan Integration: As in the original patent, integrate service plan pricing.
    5.  Bundling Logic:  Identify complementary features/customizations and offer bundle discounts. (e.g., high-end camera + photo editing software).
    6.  Real-time adjustment based on inventory levels (limited edition customizations trigger price increases).
*   **Output:** Personalized device price.

**4. User Interface (Device Configurator):**

*   Interactive 3D device model.
*   Visual representation of feature/customization options.
*   Real-time price updates as user selects/deselects options.
*   “Recommended for You” section based on user profile.
*   "What If" scenarios: Show price changes for adding/removing features.

**5. Pseudocode (Price Calculation):**

```
function calculatePrice(userProfile, device, servicePlan) {
  basePrice = device.basePrice
  featureCost = 0
  customizationCost = 0

  for each feature in device.features {
    featureCost += feature.cost * userProfile.featureWeights[feature.name]
  }

  for each customization in device.customizations {
    customizationCost += customization.cost * userProfile.customizationWeights[customization.name]
  }

  servicePlanCost = getServicePlanCost(servicePlan)

  totalPrice = basePrice + featureCost + customizationCost + servicePlanCost

  return totalPrice
}
```

**6. Data Flow:**

1.  User interacts with Device Configurator.
2.  User data (browsing history, preferences) is collected (with consent).
3.  Behavioral Profiling Engine generates user profile.
4.  Dynamic Price Calculation Engine calculates personalized price.
5.  Price is displayed in Device Configurator.
