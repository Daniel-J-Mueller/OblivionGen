## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Classification for Personalized Beam Selection

**Core Concept:** Integrate real-time acoustic scene classification *directly* into the beam selection process, tailoring beamforming not just to direction, but to the *type* of environment.  This moves beyond simply selecting the strongest signal; it selects the beam that *best interprets* the current acoustic scene for improved downstream processing (e.g., speech recognition, keyword spotting).

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Existing array configuration (as defined in patent).
*   **Processor:**  High-performance DSP or equivalent with sufficient capacity for real-time acoustic scene classification *and* beamforming.
*   **Acoustic Scene Database:**  Pre-trained deep learning model (Convolutional Neural Network or Transformer-based) capable of classifying a wide range of acoustic scenes (e.g., quiet office, bustling street, car interior, restaurant, home environment, etc.).  Model should be updated periodically via over-the-air updates to improve accuracy and expand scene coverage.
*   **Feature Extraction:**  Extract Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), chroma features, and spectral contrast from *each* beamformed signal *before* selection.
*   **Classification Network Input:**  Concatenate features from all beamformed signals to create a single input vector for the acoustic scene classification network.
*   **Scene Classification Output:**  Probability distribution over the predefined acoustic scene classes.
*   **Beam Selection Algorithm:**
    *   Calculate a “scene compatibility score” for each beamformed signal. This score is based on the probability of the current acoustic scene (as determined by the classification network) given the features of that beamformed signal.  (e.g., a restaurant scene might have a higher score for beams that emphasize lower frequencies).
    *   Combine the scene compatibility score with the smoothed feature value (from the original patent) and the speech score to calculate a *final* beam selection score. A weighted sum is appropriate, with the weights optimized through experimentation.
    *   Select the beam with the highest final score.
*   **Personalization Module:** Allow user-defined scene preferences. For example, a user might indicate that they frequently listen to music in a specific environment. The system can then prioritize beams that are well-suited for music reproduction in that environment.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm that dynamically adjusts the weights of the scene compatibility score, smoothed feature value, and speech score based on user feedback and environmental changes.
*   **Output:** Selected beamformed audio signal.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load Acoustic Scene Classification Model
Initialize Reinforcement Learning Agent

// Real-time Processing Loop
For each time frame:
    // Beamforming
    Perform standard beamforming to generate a plurality of beamformed signals
    
    // Feature Extraction
    Extract MFCCs, chroma features, spectral contrast from each beamformed signal
    
    // Acoustic Scene Classification
    Concatenate features, input to Acoustic Scene Classification Model
    Get scene probability distribution (scene_probs)
    
    // Calculate Scene Compatibility Scores
    For each beam:
        scene_compatibility_score = DotProduct(beam_features, scene_probs)
        
    // Calculate Final Beam Selection Score
    For each beam:
        final_score = (weight_scene * scene_compatibility_score) + (weight_smoothed * smoothed_feature_value) + (weight_speech * speech_score)
    
    // Select Beam with Highest Score
    selected_beam = ArgMax(final_score)
    
    // Output Selected Beam
    Output selected_beam
    
    // Reinforcement Learning Update (Periodically)
    Update weights based on user feedback and performance metrics.
```

This approach moves beyond simply identifying the strongest signal to intelligently selecting the *best* signal for the current environment, leading to improved accuracy and a more natural listening experience.  The personalization module and dynamic weighting further enhance the system’s adaptability and user satisfaction.
