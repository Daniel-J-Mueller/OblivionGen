## Temporal Data Sharding with Predictive Pruning

**Concept:** Extend the logical deletion concept to not just mark objects as deleted, but proactively shard data across time, combined with a predictive pruning system based on access patterns. This allows for automated archival and deletion *before* storage costs become prohibitive, while maintaining access to recently used data.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sharding:** Implement time-based sharding. Each object, upon creation, is assigned a 'creation shard' based on its creation timestamp (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
*   **Shard Lifecycle:** Shards progress through stages: 'Hot' (frequent access), 'Warm' (moderate access), 'Cold' (infrequent access), 'Archive' (minimal access), 'Prune' (eligible for deletion). Stage transitions are determined by access patterns.
*   **Access Pattern Analysis:** A dedicated service continuously monitors access patterns for each shard. Utilize a rolling window (e.g., 30 days) to calculate access frequency and recency.
*   **Predictive Pruning Model:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., time series forecasting, recurrent neural network) to predict future access probabilities for each shard. Inputs: historical access data, object metadata (size, type, creation date), user behavior patterns. Outputs: probability of access within a defined timeframe (e.g., 30, 60, 90 days).
*   **Automated Shard Transition:** Based on the predicted access probability, automatically transition shards between stages. Define thresholds for each stage.
*   **Deletion Marker Extension:** Utilize the existing delete marker concept but extend it to shard-level markers.  A "Shard Delete Marker" indicates a shard is eligible for pruning, even if individual delete markers exist within it.
*   **Data Replication & Redundancy:** Maintain data replication across shards to ensure availability during transitions. Implement checksum verification during shard migration.
*   **API Extensions:** Add API endpoints for:
    *   Shard Lifecycle Management: Manual shard transition requests, monitoring shard status.
    *   Pruning Configuration: Setting pruning thresholds, configuring predictive model parameters.
    *   Audit Logging: Tracking shard transitions, pruning events, and user actions.
*   **User Defined Policies:** Allow users to define data retention policies based on object type, user group, or custom metadata.  These policies override the default pruning configuration.

**Pseudocode (Pruning Process):**

```
FUNCTION pruneShards()
  FOR EACH shard IN activeShards
    accessProbability = predictAccessProbability(shard)
    IF accessProbability < pruningThreshold
      IF shard.stage == "Cold" OR shard.stage == "Archive"
        markShardForDeletion(shard)  // Create Shard Delete Marker
        archiveShard(shard) //Move to offsite storage
        DELETE shard AFTER confirmation
      ELSE
        downgradeShardStage(shard)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION predictAccessProbability(shard)
  // Fetch historical access data for the shard
  historicalData = getShardAccessHistory(shard)

  // Apply machine learning model to predict future access probability
  probability = ML_MODEL.predict(historicalData)

  RETURN probability
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** Combines logical deletion with proactive, predictive data sharding and automated lifecycle management. It moves beyond simple delete markers to manage entire shards based on predicted access patterns, optimizing storage costs and reducing administrative overhead. It extends the logical deletion concept to a shard level, allowing for more granular control over data retention.
