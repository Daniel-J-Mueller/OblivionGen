## Dynamic Media ‘Moodscapes’

**Concept:** Extend the activity-based media recommendation to proactively *shape* the listener’s environment through media selection, creating a dynamic ‘moodscape’ that anticipates and complements their activity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Fusion & Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Input:** Integrate data streams from device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, position), ambient sensors (microphone for soundscape analysis, smart home devices for environmental data – light, temperature), and calendar/schedule information.
*   **Data Processing:** Implement a real-time activity inference engine. This goes beyond simple 'walking' or 'driving'. The system must infer *intensity*, *focus*, *emotional state* (based on pace, rhythm, subtle vocalizations picked up by the microphone, and potentially even biometric data from wearables).
*   **Predictive Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on vast datasets of activity/sensor data correlated with media preferences. This model predicts the *optimal emotional/cognitive state* for the user, given their current and anticipated activity.  The target isn’t just 'recommend a song', but ‘shift the listener's emotional baseline towards X’.

**2. Multi-Layered Media Selection:**

*   **Core Layer:**  The standard recommendation engine (similar to the patent, suggesting media based on past behavior + current activity).
*   **Atmospheric Layer:**  Selects ambient soundscapes, generative music, or subtle auditory cues to *enhance* the current mood/activity.  Examples:  Rain sounds during focused work, upbeat electronic music during a run, calming nature sounds before sleep.
*   **Adaptive Layer:** A generative AI model (e.g. a variational autoencoder) creates or modifies existing media content in real-time to perfectly match the desired mood/activity.  This could involve:
    *   Adjusting tempo and key of music
    *   Adding or removing instruments
    *   Generating new vocalizations or sound effects
    *   Modifying visual elements (if paired with a display)

**3.  "Moodscape" Profiles & Customization:**

*   Users define “Moodscape” profiles – pre-set configurations for common activities (e.g., "Focused Work," "Intense Workout," "Relaxation"). Each profile defines the target emotional state, preferred media genres, and allowed levels of adaptation.
*   The system learns user preferences over time, automatically refining Moodscape profiles and adapting media selections to maximize engagement and effectiveness.
*   Users can provide feedback ("This music is too intense," "I love this ambient soundscape") to further refine the system’s learning.

**4.  Integration with Smart Environments:**

*   Control smart home devices (lights, temperature, curtains) to create a cohesive sensory experience that complements the media selections.
*   Synchronize media playback across multiple devices (headphones, speakers, smart displays).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function recommendMedia(sensorData, calendarData, userProfile) {
  activity = inferActivity(sensorData, calendarData);
  targetMood = getUserTargetMood(activity, userProfile);
  
  coreMedia = recommendMediaFromHistory(activity, userProfile);
  ambientMedia = generateAmbientSoundscape(targetMood);
  adaptiveMedia = adaptMediaToMood(coreMedia, targetMood);
  
  // Combine layers (e.g., play core media with ambient soundscape)
  combinedMedia = combineMediaLayers(coreMedia, ambientMedia, adaptiveMedia);
  
  return combinedMedia;
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple media recommendation. It actively *shapes* the listener’s environment and emotional state using a multi-layered approach, creating a dynamic ‘moodscape’ tailored to their activity. The adaptive layer with generative AI is key to achieving a truly personalized and immersive experience.
