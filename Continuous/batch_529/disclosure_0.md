## Dynamic Proximity-Based AR Content Delivery

**Concept:** Extend geo-dynamic email lists to trigger Augmented Reality (AR) experiences instead of, or in addition to, email delivery.  Instead of *receiving* information, users *experience* it contextually within their physical environment.

**Specs:**

*   **AR Content Repository:**  A server-side repository storing AR content (3D models, animations, interactive elements) keyed to specific locations (lat/long coordinates and radius).  Content can be authored using standard AR development tools (Unity, ARKit, ARCore) and uploaded via API. Metadata includes content type, duration, interactivity level, and expiry date.
*   **Proximity Zones:** Define virtual “proximity zones” around locations.  These zones dictate the range within which a user’s device must be to trigger AR content. Zones can be customized per location and content type (e.g., a small zone for a detailed product demonstration, a larger zone for general informational signage).
*   **User Device App:** A mobile application (iOS and Android) with the following capabilities:
    *   **Location Tracking:** Continuous background location tracking (with user permission, adhering to privacy best practices). Utilizes GPS, Wi-Fi, and cellular triangulation for accurate positioning.
    *   **Proximity Detection:**  Monitors the device's location and compares it against registered proximity zones.
    *   **AR Engine Integration:**  Integrates with a cross-platform AR engine (e.g., Unity with AR Foundation) to render and display AR content.
    *   **Content Download/Caching:**  Downloads AR content automatically when a user enters a proximity zone and caches it locally for offline access.
    *   **User Preferences:**  Allows users to customize AR experience preferences (e.g., content types, notification settings).
*   **Server Logic:**
    *   **Location Monitoring:**  Receives location data from user devices.
    *   **Proximity Zone Matching:**  Identifies users who have entered a proximity zone.
    *   **AR Content Triggering:**  Sends a signal to the user's device to launch the AR experience associated with the location.
    *   **Content Management:**  Manages the AR content repository, including uploads, updates, and deletions.
    *   **Analytics:**  Tracks AR experience usage (e.g., number of launches, duration, user engagement).

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function handleUserLocationUpdate(userId, latitude, longitude):
  proximityZones = getProximityZonesWithinRadius(latitude, longitude, maxRadius)
  for zone in proximityZones:
    if userHasNotExperiencedContent(userId, zone.contentId):
      triggerARContent(userId, zone.contentId)
    end if
  end for
end function
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Retail:** Trigger product demonstrations or virtual try-on experiences when customers approach specific displays.
*   **Tourism:** Provide historical overlays or interactive guides when visitors reach landmarks.
*   **Museums:** Enhance exhibits with AR animations or 3D models.
*   **Real Estate:** Allow potential buyers to visualize furniture or renovations in a property.
*   **Events:** Offer interactive maps, schedules, or gamified experiences at conferences or festivals.
