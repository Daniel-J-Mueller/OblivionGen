## Dynamic Ad-Slot Personalization via Predictive User Journey Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the existing advertisement system by predicting a user’s likely purchase journey *before* they initiate it, then dynamically tailoring ad-slot content not just to immediate keywords, but to anticipated future needs within that journey. This moves beyond reactive keyword targeting to proactive journey-based advertising.

**Specs:**

**1. Journey Mapping Component:**

*   **Input:** User history (purchases, browsing, demographics), item attributes (category, price, description), current session data (clicks, time on page), and external data (seasonality, trends).
*   **Process:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on anonymized user journey data. The LSTM will predict a probability distribution over potential next-step items a user might interact with.
    *   Example: User views hiking boots. LSTM predicts 70% chance they'll view hiking socks, 20% chance they'll view a hiking backpack, 10% other.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of likely next-step items with associated confidence scores, representing the user’s predicted journey.  Journey length capped at 5-7 steps.

**2. Ad-Slot Allocation & Content Generation:**

*   **Input:** Predicted journey from Journey Mapping Component, available ad slots, item attributes.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each ad slot, prioritize items from the *future* steps of the predicted journey (steps 2-5), not just the immediate item the user is currently viewing.
    *   If multiple items are available for a future step, select the item with the highest predicted click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate.
    *   Dynamic ad creative generation:  Instead of static ads, generate ads tailored to the future journey step.  For example, if the user is predicted to buy a backpack next, the ad shows a relevant backpack model, highlighting features useful for their predicted activity (based on the original item viewed - hiking boots).
*   **Output:**  A set of dynamically generated ads and allocated ad slots for the current page view.

**3. Feedback Loop & Model Refinement:**

*   **Data Collection:** Track user interactions with the dynamically allocated ads (clicks, conversions, time spent viewing).
*   **Model Update:** Use the collected data to retrain the LSTM model and refine the ad selection algorithms.  Reinforcement learning techniques can be used to optimize the ad selection policy based on long-term user engagement and revenue.

**Pseudocode (Ad Slot Allocation):**

```
FUNCTION AllocateAdSlots(user, currentItem, availableSlots):
  journey = JourneyMappingComponent(user, currentItem)  // Returns list of predicted items
  FOR slot IN availableSlots:
    bestNextItem = NULL
    highestScore = 0
    FOR i FROM 1 TO length(journey):  // Iterate through predicted journey steps
      nextItem = journey[i]
      score = CalculateAdScore(nextItem, user, currentItem) // CTR, Conversion, etc.
      IF score > highestScore:
        highestScore = score
        bestNextItem = nextItem

    IF bestNextItem != NULL:
      GenerateAdCreative(bestNextItem)
      AllocateSlotToAd(slot, generatedAd)
```

**Novelty:**

This system diverges from typical keyword-based advertising by anticipating user needs *before* they are explicitly expressed. It introduces a predictive layer based on user journey mapping, allowing for more personalized and engaging advertising experiences.  The dynamic ad creative generation tied to future journey steps is also a unique element.
