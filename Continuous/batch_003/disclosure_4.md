## Personalized Catalog Storytelling

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply displaying prior order information on category pages. Utilize order history to *construct narratives* within the catalog experience. Think "Your Music Journey," or "Your Home Improvement Story."

**Specs:**

**1. Data Aggregation & Narrative Construction Module:**

*   **Input:** User order history (item ID, order date, quantity, category), catalog item metadata (category, tags, descriptions, associated items – e.g., “customers also bought”).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Timeline Creation:** Organize order history chronologically.
    *   **Theme Identification:**  AI-driven analysis of ordered items to identify recurring themes (e.g., “outdoor cooking,” “baby’s first year,” “home office upgrade”).  Weighting algorithms prioritize recent purchases and high-value items.
    *   **Story Arc Generation:** Construct a narrative around the identified theme. Example: “You started your outdoor cooking journey with a basic grill last spring.  This summer, you expanded with a smoker and a set of grilling tools.  Now, explore advanced recipes and accessories to take your skills to the next level!”
    *   **Content Integration:** Dynamically select catalog items to feature within the narrative, based on user history *and* potential expansion areas. 
*   **Output:**  A structured narrative with featured items and links to relevant categories/products.

**2.  Narrative Presentation Layer:**

*   **Integration Points:**
    *   **Category Page Header:** Replace static category headers with a personalized narrative snippet (e.g., "Continue your Home Office Story...")
    *   **Dedicated "My Story" Section:** A persistent section within the user account with a timeline-based presentation of their shopping history, categorized by theme.
    *   **Email/Push Notifications:** Triggered by new item arrivals or promotions that align with the user's identified story arc. ("We noticed you're building a Home Gym! Check out our new Power Racks!")
*   **UI Elements:**
    *   **Timeline Visualization:** Interactive timeline showing order history with expandable details.
    *   **"Explore Further" Buttons:**  Direct users to relevant categories based on the current narrative segment.
    *   **"Add to My Story" Feature:** Allow users to manually tag items as part of a specific story arc, refining the AI's understanding of their preferences.
*   **Dynamic Content:**  Narrative content should be updated in real-time based on user browsing and purchase activity.



**Pseudocode (Story Generation):**

```
function generateStory(userID) {
  orderHistory = getOrderHistory(userID);
  themes = analyzeOrderHistory(orderHistory); // AI analysis
  selectedTheme = choosePrimaryTheme(themes); // Prioritize recent/high-value items

  storyArc = constructArc(selectedTheme, orderHistory);  //Build narrative

  featuredItems = selectItemsForArc(storyArc, catalog); // Items to suggest

  return {
    arc: storyArc,
    featuredItems: featuredItems
  };
}

```
