## Dynamic Network Topology Mapping & Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Extend the latency-based routing system to actively *learn* and predict network topology changes, proactively adjusting routing paths *before* latency increases are observed. This creates a self-optimizing network resilient to congestion and failures, going beyond simple reactive adjustments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Topology Mapping Agent (TMA):**
   *   **Deployment:** Distributed across Points of Presence (POPs) and strategically selected edge nodes.
   *   **Function:** Continuously probes network paths between POPs and key edge nodes.  This isn't simple ping; it employs a suite of tests:
        *   **Latency Measurement:** Standard ICMP-based latency tests.
        *   **Packet Loss Rate:** Measure packet loss during probes.
        *   **Bandwidth Estimation:** Utilize tools like TCP-based probing or iperf-like tests to gauge available bandwidth.
        *   **Path Tracing:** Employ traceroute-like functionality, but augmented to also identify ASNs and geolocation data for each hop.
   *   **Data Transmission:**  Transmits aggregated topology data to a central Network Intelligence Engine (NIE) via secure, low-latency channels.  Data is compressed and prioritized based on change frequency.
   *   **Frequency:**  Baseline probes every 5 seconds.  Adaptive probing – increases frequency when changes are detected.

**2. Network Intelligence Engine (NIE):**
   *   **Function:**  The central brain of the system.
   *   **Topology Database:** Stores a real-time, multi-dimensional graph representing the network topology. Nodes represent POPs, edge nodes, and critical network infrastructure. Edges represent network paths with associated metrics (latency, loss, bandwidth, ASN, geolocation).
   *   **Machine Learning Module:**
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Utilizes time-series analysis and machine learning algorithms (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) to identify anomalous network behavior – unexpected latency spikes, packet loss increases, bandwidth drops.
        *   **Predictive Modeling:**  Predicts future network conditions based on historical data and current trends.  Considers factors like time of day, day of week, known events (e.g., sporting events, software releases), and correlated network behavior.
        *   **Routing Path Optimization:** Determines optimal routing paths based on predicted network conditions.  Prioritizes paths with low latency, low loss, and sufficient bandwidth.
   *   **Routing Policy Generator:**  Translates optimized routing paths into routing policies that can be deployed to network devices. Supports standard routing protocols (BGP, OSPF) and custom routing policies.

**3. Adaptive Routing Controller (ARC):**
   *   **Deployment:** Located within each POP.
   *   **Function:**  Receives routing policies from the NIE.  Dynamically adjusts routing paths based on these policies.
   *   **Failover Mechanism:**  Monitors the health of primary and secondary routing paths.  Automatically switches to a secondary path if the primary path fails or becomes degraded.
   *   **A/B Testing:** Supports A/B testing of different routing policies to evaluate their performance and optimize network behavior.

**Pseudocode (NIE - Predictive Modeling):**

```
function predict_network_conditions(topology_data, historical_data, current_time):
    # Analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends.
    patterns = analyze_historical_data(historical_data)

    # Consider current network conditions (topology_data).
    current_conditions = extract_features(topology_data)

    # Combine patterns and current conditions to make predictions.
    predicted_latency = predict_latency(patterns, current_conditions)
    predicted_loss = predict_loss(patterns, current_conditions)
    predicted_bandwidth = predict_bandwidth(patterns, current_conditions)

    return predicted_latency, predicted_loss, predicted_bandwidth

function analyze_historical_data(historical_data):
    # Implement time-series analysis techniques (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA)
    # to identify patterns and trends in network performance.
    # Return a set of features representing these patterns.
    # (Implementation details depend on chosen algorithms)
    pass

function extract_features(topology_data):
    # Extract relevant features from the current network topology data,
    # such as latency, loss, bandwidth, and geographical location.
    pass

function predict_latency(patterns, current_conditions):
    # Use machine learning models to predict future latency based on
    # historical patterns and current network conditions.
    pass

# Similar functions for predicting loss and bandwidth
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive latency-based routing to *proactive* routing. The NIE leverages machine learning to predict network conditions *before* they impact performance, enabling preemptive adjustments and a more resilient network. This approach addresses potential issues before users experience them.
