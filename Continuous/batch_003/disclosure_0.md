**Personalized Query Suggestion – Predictive Item Association & Dynamic Knowledge Graph Integration**

**Core Concept:** Shift from solely user interaction history to a proactive system predicting user *needs* based on contextual data and a dynamically updating knowledge graph, providing suggestions *before* the user fully articulates their query.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Contextual Data Acquisition:**
    *   Real-time data streams: Location (if permitted), time of day, calendar events, connected device usage (e.g., smart home devices indicating activity).
    *   External APIs: News feeds, weather data, trending topics, social media activity (user-opt-in required).

2.  **Dynamic Knowledge Graph Construction:**
    *   Node Types: Items (products, content, services), User Profiles, Contextual Factors (location, time, event), Relationships (purchased, viewed, related, influenced by context).
    *   Relationship Weights:  Assign weights to relationships based on frequency, recency, and contextual relevance. A 'decay parameter' (as in the patent) is crucial here, but extended to *all* relationship types, not just user interactions.
    *   Automated Graph Updates:  Employ machine learning to infer new relationships and update existing weights based on continuous data input.

3.  **Predictive Query Generation:**
    *   Contextual Filtering: Filter the knowledge graph based on current contextual data. For example, if the user is at a coffee shop (location), the graph prioritizes nodes related to coffee, pastries, and work-related items.
    *   Pathfinding Algorithm: Utilize a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm) to identify likely user needs based on the filtered graph. The algorithm searches for paths connecting the user profile to item nodes, considering relationship weights.  Pseudocode:

```
function predictNeeds(userProfile, contextualData, knowledgeGraph):
  filteredGraph = filterGraph(knowledgeGraph, contextualData)
  paths = findPaths(filteredGraph, userProfile, itemNodes) //Using Dijkstra's or A*
  rankedPaths = rankPaths(paths, relationshipWeights) //Prioritize paths with higher total weight
  suggestedItems = extractItemsFromPaths(rankedPaths, topN)
  return suggestedItems
```

4.  **Query Suggestion Interface:**
    *   Proactive Suggestions: Display suggested queries *before* the user types, based on predicted needs.
    *   Multi-Modal Input:  Support voice, image, and text input. For example, a user could point their phone at a product, and the system would suggest related queries.
    *   Confidence Scores: Display confidence scores alongside suggestions, indicating the system’s certainty.
    *   Personalized Filtering: Allow users to customize suggestion preferences and filter out unwanted topics.

5.  **Caching & Pre-Fetching:**
    *   Cache frequently accessed graph data and query suggestions to reduce latency.
    *   Pre-fetch relevant graph data based on predicted user movements and activities.

6.  **Federated Learning:**
    *   Enable federated learning to train the knowledge graph model on user data without compromising privacy.  Data remains on user devices, and only model updates are shared.

7.  **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual user behavior that may indicate a change in needs or preferences.
    *   Use detected anomalies to dynamically adjust the knowledge graph and suggestion algorithms.
