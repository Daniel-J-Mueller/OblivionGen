## Dynamic Content Re-Sculpting for Bandwidth Optimization

**Concept:** Proactively alter content *within* a stream to dynamically match available bandwidth, prioritizing key visual elements. Rather than simply reducing bitrate or resolution, the system identifies and retains high-detail sections of a frame (e.g., faces, action sequences) while reducing detail in less critical areas (backgrounds, static objects). This allows for a perceptually higher quality stream at lower bitrates.

**System Components:**

*   **Perceptual Importance Map (PIM) Generator:** An AI model (CNN-based) analyzing each frame to generate a PIM, assigning importance scores to different regions. This is not object detection, but a measure of visual attention – areas the eye is likely to focus on.
*   **Content Re-Sculptor:** An algorithm using the PIM to selectively reduce detail in low-importance regions. This can be done using several techniques:
    *   **Adaptive Block Size:** Use larger block sizes for DCT/Wavelet transforms in low-importance areas, effectively reducing frequency detail.
    *   **Chroma Subsampling Variation:** Increase chroma subsampling in low-importance areas.
    *   **Detail Masking:** Apply a blurring or smoothing filter selectively based on the PIM.
*   **Bandwidth Monitor:** Real-time monitor of available bandwidth.
*   **Adaptive Control Loop:**  An algorithm continuously adjusting the Re-Sculptor's parameters based on bandwidth availability and the PIM.
*   **Pre-Encoding Database:** Database of pre-rendered 'detail layers' for common content types (e.g., skies, foliage). These can be swapped in/out based on bandwidth.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Control Loop):**

```
// Variables
targetBitrate = 10 Mbps
currentBitrate = 0 Mbps
PIM_data = {} // Data from Perceptual Importance Map Generator
detailLevel = 1.0 // 1.0 = full detail, 0.0 = minimal detail

// Main Loop
while (streaming) {
    currentBitrate = getBitrate();
    PIM_data = generatePIM(currentFrame);

    if (currentBitrate < targetBitrate) {
        // Reduce detail
        detailLevel = min(1.0, detailLevel * 0.95); // Reduce detail by 5%
        adjustEncodingParameters(detailLevel, PIM_data);
    } else if (currentBitrate > targetBitrate * 1.2) { // Buffer headroom
        // Increase detail (gradually)
        detailLevel = min(1.0, detailLevel * 1.05);
        adjustEncodingParameters(detailLevel, PIM_data);
    }

    // Render frame with adjusted detail levels
    renderFrame(currentFrame, PIM_data, detailLevel);

    //Send Frame
    sendFrame(currentFrame);
}
```

**Function: `adjustEncodingParameters(detailLevel, PIM_data)`**

```
//Scale block size based on detailLevel and PIM
blockSize = baseBlockSize * (1 - detailLevel * PIM_importance)

//Adjust chroma subsampling
chromaSubsampling = baseChromaSubsampling + (1 - detailLevel) * chromaReduction

//Apply filters based on PIM to low-importance areas
applyGaussianBlur(PIM_lowImportanceAreas, filterStrength * (1-detailLevel))
```

**Innovation:** This differs from simple bitrate adaptation by operating *within* the frame, selectively reducing detail instead of uniformly lowering quality.  The PIM allows for intelligent detail reduction, prioritizing visual focus. The pre-rendered detail layers provide a way to maintain perceived quality even at very low bitrates.  It is also adaptable to varying content – action scenes will require less reduction than static landscapes.
