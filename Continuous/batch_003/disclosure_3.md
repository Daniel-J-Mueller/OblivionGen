## Dynamic Event Reconstruction & Predictive Summarization

**Concept:** Expand beyond post-hoc summarization to *reconstruct* events dynamically and generate summaries *predictive* of unfolding actions. Leverage multi-modal data streams beyond video to anticipate salient moments.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Accept video streams (as per existing patent).
    *   Integrate real-time sensor data: audio (ambient sound, speech), location (GPS, iBeacons), environmental (temperature, light levels), social media feeds (relevant hashtags, mentions).
    *   Establish a data synchronization framework to align time-stamped data from diverse sources.
*   **Event Modeling:**
    *   **Event Signature Database:**  Create a database of ‘event signatures’ – patterns in multi-modal data that indicate specific activities (e.g., a basketball game starts – increased audio decibel levels, specific crowd noise frequencies, location data indicating a stadium, social media mentions of the teams playing).  The database will be constantly updated via machine learning.
    *   **Probabilistic Event Tracking:** Utilize Bayesian networks to model the probability of different events occurring based on incoming data streams. Update probabilities in real-time.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify deviations from expected patterns to flag potential significant events.
*   **Predictive Summarization Engine:**
    *   **Action Anticipation:**  Based on the probabilistic event tracking, anticipate likely actions or moments within the event. (e.g., in a sports game: a free throw attempt, a goal).
    *   **Salience Scoring:**  Assign a ‘salience score’ to each anticipated moment, based on a combination of factors: probability of occurrence, potential impact on the overall event, user-defined preferences (e.g., focus on specific players, actions).
    *   **Pre-emptive Clip Selection:**  Select video clips *before* the anticipated moment occurs, preparing for potential inclusion in the summary.  This requires buffering and pre-processing.
*   **Summary Generation:**
    *   **Dynamic Clip Assembly:**  Assemble the final summary based on the highest-salience moments, incorporating video clips and potentially highlighting relevant sensor data (e.g., displaying speed/distance during a race).
    *   **Adaptive Length:**  Allow the user to specify the desired length of the summary.
    *   **Multi-Perspective Output:** Offer multiple summary options: short highlights, long-form recap, focused on specific aspects of the event.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Event Modeling & Prediction
function processDataStream(videoData, sensorData, socialData):
  eventSignatures = queryEventSignatureDB(sensorData) // Matches sensor data to known events
  eventProbabilities = calculateEventProbabilities(eventSignatures, videoData) // Bayesian network updates probabilities
  predictedMoments = identifyPredictedMoments(eventProbabilities) // Finds likely events & moments
  return predictedMoments

// Clip Selection & Assembly
function assembleSummary(predictedMoments, desiredLength):
  selectedClips = prioritizeClips(predictedMoments) // Based on salience score & desired length
  finalSummary = concatenateClips(selectedClips) // Assembles the summary
  return finalSummary
```

**Novelty:**  Existing systems focus on summarizing *past* events.  This system predicts and pre-selects clips based on real-time data analysis, leading to more engaging and relevant summaries. It moves beyond purely visual data, integrating multi-modal sensor data for richer event understanding.
