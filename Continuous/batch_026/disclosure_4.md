## Adaptive Narrative Generation via Biofeedback & Spatial Mapping

**System Overview:** A system that generates dynamic narratives (visual, auditory, haptic) driven by real-time biofeedback from a user *and* spatial mapping of the environment. The core concept expands on correlating movement data with image playback, but replaces simple playback adjustment with full narrative generation.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Sensor Headset:** EEG, Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Eye Tracking, Galvanic Skin Response (GSR).
*   **Spatial Mapping Unit:** LiDAR or similar technology for creating a real-time 3D map of the user’s environment.
*   **Haptic Feedback System:**  Array of localized vibration actuators (vest, chair, or full-body suit).
*   **High-Resolution Display:** VR/AR headset or large-format projection screen.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance computer capable of real-time data processing and rendering.

**Software Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Processing Module:**  Analyzes real-time biofeedback data (EEG, HRV, GSR, eye movements) to determine user emotional state (excitement, relaxation, fear, etc.) and cognitive load.
*   **Spatial Analysis Module:** Processes spatial data to identify objects, boundaries, and navigable areas within the user’s environment.  Detects user location & orientation.
*   **Narrative Engine:**  A procedural generation system that dynamically creates narrative elements (visuals, sounds, haptics) based on the output of the biofeedback and spatial analysis modules. Utilizes a library of pre-created “narrative fragments” (scenes, soundscapes, haptic patterns) and combines/modifies them in real-time.
*   **Adaptive AI Director:** An AI agent that oversees the narrative generation process, balancing user emotional state, spatial context, and overall narrative flow.  Adjusts parameters of the Narrative Engine and Adaptive AI Director to maximize engagement and immersion.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load Pre-built Narrative Fragment Library
Initialize Multi-Sensor Headset, Spatial Mapping Unit, Haptic System
Start Data Streams (Biofeedback, Spatial Data)

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {
    // Capture Data
    BiofeedbackData = GetBiofeedbackData()
    SpatialData = GetSpatialData()

    // Analyze Data
    EmotionalState = AnalyzeBiofeedbackData(BiofeedbackData)
    EnvironmentMap = AnalyzeSpatialData(SpatialData)

    // Narrative Generation
    NarrativeFragment = SelectNarrativeFragment(EmotionalState, EnvironmentMap)
    ModifyNarrativeFragment(NarrativeFragment, EmotionalState)

    // Output
    DisplayVisuals(NarrativeFragment.Visuals)
    PlayAudio(NarrativeFragment.Audio)
    ApplyHaptics(NarrativeFragment.Haptics)

    // AI Director Adjustment (Dynamic Parameters)
    UpdateAIParameters(EmotionalState, NarrativeFragment)

}
```

**Narrative Fragment Structure (Example):**

```
FragmentID: 123
Type: "Environmental"
Visuals: {
    Scene: "ForestPath",
    Lighting: "Dim",
    SpecialEffects: "Fog"
}
Audio: {
    Soundscape: "ForestAmbient",
    Music: "AmbientDrone"
}
Haptics: {
    VestVibrationPattern: "GentlePulse",
    Intensity: 0.3
}
EmotionalTarget: "Relaxation"
SpatialContext: "OpenSpace"
```

**Innovation & Potential:**

This system moves beyond simple image adjustment. It’s about creating a fully immersive and *responsive* narrative experience tailored to the user's real-time emotional and physical state.  Potential applications include therapeutic interventions (anxiety reduction, PTSD treatment), immersive storytelling, and enhanced training simulations. The dynamic nature allows for infinite replayability and personalized experiences. The integration of spatial mapping adds a crucial layer of contextual awareness, allowing the narrative to adapt to the user’s physical surroundings.
