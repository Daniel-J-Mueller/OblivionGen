## Dynamic Resource Tagging & Predictive Caching

**Concept:** Extend the cluster-based routing with a dynamic tagging system applied *to the resource itself*, coupled with predictive caching based on tag similarity and cluster behavior. Instead of just classifying *clients*, classify *content* and predict caching needs based on shared characteristics.

**Specs:**

**1. Resource Tagging Module (RTM):**

*   **Input:** Requested resource (URL, file, stream ID).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze resource content (HTTP headers, initial payload, metadata).
    *   Employ machine learning models (trained on historical data) to assign dynamic tags representing:
        *   Content Type (video, image, script, etc.) – Standard classification.
        *   Content Freshness (how often the resource is updated).
        *   Content Popularity (estimated based on request frequency – updated continuously).
        *   Content Similarity (vector embedding based on content analysis – identifies near-duplicate resources).
        *   Geographic Relevance (identified regions where the content is most requested).
    *   Output: Tag list associated with the resource. These tags are stored in a distributed key-value store (e.g., Redis) accessible by all DNS servers and cache servers.

**2. Cluster Behavior Profiler (CBP):**

*   **Input:** Historical DNS request data aggregated by cluster.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor request patterns within each cluster, focusing on tag frequencies.
    *   Build a ‘cluster profile’ representing the dominant tags requested by that cluster. This profile is a weighted list of tags, with weights reflecting frequency.
    *   Update the profile dynamically based on recent requests.
*   **Output:** Cluster profiles stored in a distributed key-value store.

**3. Predictive Caching System (PCS):**

*   **Integration Point:** Intercepts DNS queries *after* RTM tagging and *before* routing to cache servers.
*   **Process:**
    *   Retrieve the resource tags from the RTM.
    *   Identify the requesting client’s cluster.
    *   Retrieve the cluster profile.
    *   Calculate a ‘similarity score’ between the resource tags and the cluster profile.
    *   If the similarity score exceeds a threshold:
        *   Instruct the DNS server to route the request to a *pre-fetch* cache server.
        *   The pre-fetch cache server proactively retrieves the resource and stores it.
    *   If the similarity score is below the threshold:
        *   Route to standard caching infrastructure.

**Pseudocode (PCS):**

```
function processDNSQuery(dnsQuery) {
  resourceTags = getResourceTags(dnsQuery.resourceIdentifier)
  clientCluster = getClientCluster(dnsQuery.clientIP)
  clusterProfile = getClusterProfile(clientCluster)
  similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(resourceTags, clusterProfile)

  if (similarityScore > threshold) {
    prefetchCacheServer = selectPrefetchCacheServer()
    routeRequestToCacheServer(prefetchCacheServer)
    prefetchResource(prefetchCacheServer, dnsQuery.resourceIdentifier) //Asynchronous
  } else {
    routeRequestToStandardCache()
  }
}

function prefetchResource(cacheServer, resourceIdentifier) {
    //Initiate asynchronous resource retrieval & caching on cacheServer
}
```

**4. Cache Server Adaptation:**

*   Cache servers need to be equipped with logic to handle pre-fetched content.
*   Priority should be given to pre-fetched requests to reduce latency.
*   Cache eviction policies should consider both age and pre-fetch status.
