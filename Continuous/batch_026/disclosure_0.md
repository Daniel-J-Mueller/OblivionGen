## Dynamic Predictive Polling with Environmental Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the battery-saving polling functionality by incorporating real-time environmental data to *predict* user access requests, optimizing polling intervals beyond simple battery charge thresholds. The system won't just react to battery level, but proactively anticipate need based on contextual cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate the following into the A/V device:
    *   Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensor – wide field of view.
    *   Ambient light sensor.
    *   Microphone – capable of detecting sounds indicative of human presence (e.g., footsteps, voices – processing occurs locally, not cloud).
    *   Optional: Basic weather data acquisition (temperature, humidity - if exposed to elements).
*   **Local Processing Unit (LPU):** A low-power microcontroller dedicated to sensor data processing.
*   **AI/ML Model (embedded):** A lightweight, pre-trained machine learning model residing on the LPU. This model is trained on datasets correlating environmental sensor readings with historical user access patterns (collected during initial setup/use).  Model outputs a "likelihood of access" score (0-100).
*   **Polling Interval Adjustment Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    function adjustPollingInterval(batteryLevel, likelihoodOfAccess):
      // Base Polling Interval (e.g., 10 seconds)
      baseInterval = 10

      // Battery Adjustment
      if batteryLevel < 20:
        intervalMultiplier = 3 // Extend interval
      elif batteryLevel < 50:
        intervalMultiplier = 2
      else:
        intervalMultiplier = 1

      // Access Likelihood Adjustment
      if likelihoodOfAccess > 80:
        intervalMultiplier = 0.5 // Reduce interval
      elif likelihoodOfAccess > 50:
        intervalMultiplier = 0.75

      //Combined Interval
      adjustedInterval = baseInterval * intervalMultiplier

      //Minimum & Maximum limits
      if adjustedInterval < 2:
        adjustedInterval = 2
      if adjustedInterval > 60:
        adjustedInterval = 60

      return adjustedInterval
    ```

*   **Data Transmission:** Device transmits a “sensor snapshot” (PIR, light, sound levels, battery) with *each* polling request. This data is used by the network device/cloud for continuous model refinement and to improve the accuracy of the “likelihood of access” prediction.
*   **Model Update Mechanism:** Over-the-air (OTA) updates for the embedded AI/ML model to incorporate new data and improve prediction accuracy.
*    **Privacy Considerations:** All sound processing occurs locally. Only sensor *levels* are transmitted, not audio recordings. Data transmission is encrypted. User has the ability to disable sound detection.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  LPU continuously monitors sensors.
2.  LPU calculates "likelihood of access" score.
3.  Polling interval is adjusted based on battery level *and* likelihood of access score.
4.  Device sends polling request (including sensor snapshot).
5.  Network device/cloud uses the data for model refinement and responds to the polling request.
