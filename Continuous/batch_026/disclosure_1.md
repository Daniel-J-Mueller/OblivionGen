## Adaptive Lock Granularity Based on Request Complexity

**System Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust lock granularity based on the computational complexity of the request attempting to acquire the lock.

**Core Concept:** Current distributed lock systems typically operate at a fixed granularity (e.g., row-level, object-level). This system introduces a mechanism to analyze incoming requests and temporarily subdivide or aggregate lock granularity to optimize concurrency and reduce contention. 

**Components:**

*   **Request Analyzer:** Sits in front of the key-value store and computes a “complexity score” for each incoming request. This score considers factors such as:
    *   Number of data items accessed.
    *   Types of operations (read vs. write).
    *   Dependencies between data items.
    *   Estimated execution time.
*   **Granularity Manager:** Based on the complexity score, the Granularity Manager determines the appropriate lock granularity.
    *   **High Complexity:** Subdivides the lock into finer-grained locks. This increases concurrency by allowing different parts of the operation to proceed in parallel.
    *   **Low Complexity:** Aggregates multiple locks into a single, coarser-grained lock. This reduces overhead and contention for simple operations.
*   **Lock Table:** The Key Value Store maintains a hierarchical lock table that supports both coarse-grained and fine-grained locks.
*   **Lock Orchestrator:** Coordinates lock acquisition and release at the appropriate granularity, ensuring consistency and preventing deadlocks.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Manager):**

```
function determineGranularity(request):
  complexityScore = RequestAnalyzer.calculateComplexity(request)

  if complexityScore > HIGH_COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = FINE_GRAINULARITY
  elif complexityScore < LOW_COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD:
    granularity = COARSE_GRAINULARITY
  else:
    granularity = DEFAULT_GRAINULARITY

  return granularity
```

**Workflow:**

1.  A client sends a request to access data in the Key Value Store.
2.  The Request Analyzer calculates a complexity score for the request.
3.  The Granularity Manager determines the appropriate lock granularity based on the complexity score.
4.  The Lock Orchestrator acquires and releases locks at the determined granularity.
5.  The Key Value Store processes the request.
6.  The client receives the response.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Lock Entry:** Stores information about a lock, including:
    *   Lock ID.
    *   Owner (client ID).
    *   Granularity (coarse, fine, default).
    *   Timestamp (acquisition time).
*   **Hierarchical Lock Table:** A tree-like structure that allows for efficient lookup and management of locks at different granularities.

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   Leverage the distributed nature of the Key Value Store to distribute lock management across multiple nodes.
*   Implement a failover mechanism to ensure that lock management remains available in the event of node failures.
*   Utilize a lease-based lock mechanism to prevent indefinite lock hold times.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased concurrency and throughput.
*   Reduced contention and latency.
*   Improved system scalability and resilience.
*   Dynamic adaption to varying workload characteristics.
