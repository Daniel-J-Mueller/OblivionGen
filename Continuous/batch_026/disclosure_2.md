## Personalized AR Shopping Guides

**Concept:** Leverage the existing assisted shopping framework to create dynamic, personalized Augmented Reality (AR) shopping guides overlaid onto the user's real-world view.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a device with a capable camera and AR processing capabilities (smartphone, AR glasses).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Visual Scene Analyzer:**  Processes the camera feed to identify objects, spaces, and potential shopping contexts (e.g., a living room, kitchen, clothing rack).
    *   **AR Overlay Engine:**  Renders AR content – product visualizations, interactive guides, contextual information – onto the live camera feed.
    *   **Personalization Core:**  Utilizes user data (purchase history, search history, stated preferences, real-time browsing behavior) to tailor the AR experience.
    *   **Agent Interaction Bridge:** Seamlessly connects the AR experience with the customer service agent, allowing for real-time collaboration and guidance.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  User activates assisted shopping mode.
    2.  Visual Scene Analyzer identifies the surrounding environment.
    3.  Personalization Core generates a context-aware AR experience (e.g., suggests furniture that matches existing décor, displays clothing options based on user’s style).
    4.  AR Overlay Engine renders the AR content.
    5.  User interacts with the AR experience (e.g., virtually places furniture in their room, tries on clothes).
    6.  Agent receives a live feed of the user’s AR view and relevant data (identified objects, user preferences).
    7.  Agent can remotely annotate the AR view, provide suggestions, and guide the user through the shopping process.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Visual Scene Analysis
function analyzeScene(cameraFeed) {
  // Use computer vision algorithms to identify objects, surfaces, and spaces
  objects = detectObjects(cameraFeed)
  surfaces = detectSurfaces(cameraFeed)
  spaceType = identifySpaceType(cameraFeed)
  return {objects, surfaces, spaceType}
}

// Personalization
function generateARContent(sceneAnalysis, userProfile) {
  //  Recommend products based on scene analysis and user profile
  recommendedProducts = getProductRecommendations(sceneAnalysis, userProfile)
  //  Generate AR visualizations of recommended products
  arVisualizations = createARVisualizations(recommendedProducts)
  return arVisualizations
}

// Agent Interaction
function updateAgentView(userARView, agentAnnotations) {
  // Combine user's AR view with agent's annotations
  combinedView = mergeViews(userARView, agentAnnotations)
  // Transmit combined view to agent's interface
  transmitView(combinedView)
}

// Main Loop
while (shoppingSessionActive) {
  sceneAnalysis = analyzeScene(cameraFeed)
  arVisualizations = generateARContent(sceneAnalysis, userProfile)
  renderAR(arVisualizations)
  agentAnnotations = receiveAgentAnnotations()
  updateAgentView(cameraFeed, agentAnnotations)
}
```

*   **Refinements:**
    *   **Proactive Recommendations:** The system anticipates user needs based on the environment and offers relevant product suggestions *before* being asked.
    *   **Interactive Tutorials:**  AR guides walk users through product assembly, usage, or customization.
    *   **Virtual Try-On:**  AR enables users to virtually try on clothing, accessories, or makeup.
    *   **Spatial Mapping:**  The system creates a 3D map of the user’s environment to ensure accurate AR placement and scaling.
