## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Tagging

**Concept:** Extend the power modulation technique to incorporate resonant frequency shifts in the endpoint device's power consumption circuitry as a secondary identification channel, creating a multi-factor authentication/identification system.  Rather than *just* a modulated current draw sequence, the endpoint device *slightly* alters its internal switching regulator frequency (or uses a variable impedance load) in conjunction with the current modulation. 

**Specs:**

*   **Endpoint Device Hardware:**
    *   Each endpoint device incorporates a programmable switching regulator (e.g., a buck/boost converter) or a digitally controlled load.
    *   The regulator/load frequency/impedance is adjustable within a narrow band (e.g., +/- 2% of a base frequency).
    *   A microcontroller on the endpoint device controls both the current modulation sequence *and* the resonant frequency/impedance shift.
    *   The base frequency/impedance is unique to a batch/model of endpoint device.
*   **Power Source/Controller Hardware:**
    *   The power source (POE injector/switch) incorporates a high-resolution current sensor *and* a frequency/impedance sensor. This could be implemented via a resonant circuit coupled to the power line and monitoring impedance changes.
    *   The controller software analyzes *both* the current modulation sequence *and* the frequency/impedance shift to uniquely identify the endpoint device.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   **Initialization:** Upon connection, the controller sends a "discovery signal" - a specific current modulation pattern.
    *   **Response:** The endpoint device responds with its pre-programmed current modulation sequence *and* its unique resonant frequency/impedance shift.
    *   **Identification:** The controller receives both signals, correlates them against a database of known devices, and assigns an identifier.
    *   **Authentication:** Subsequent communication can use a shorter, encrypted modulation pattern as an authentication handshake, verified by the frequency/impedance signature.
*   **Database:**
    *   The controller maintains a database mapping each unique frequency/impedance signature to a device identifier and associated metadata (e.g., MAC address, IP address, location, function).

**Pseudocode (Controller Side - Device Identification):**

```
FUNCTION IdentifyDevice(currentModulationData, frequencyData):
  // 1. Analyze Current Modulation
  possibleDeviceIDs = LookupDeviceIDsByCurrentPattern(currentModulationData)

  // 2. Filter by Frequency Signature
  filteredDeviceIDs = []
  FOR each deviceID in possibleDeviceIDs:
    IF GetDeviceFrequencySignature(deviceID) == frequencyData:
      APPEND deviceID to filteredDeviceIDs

  // 3. Handle Ambiguity
  IF LENGTH(filteredDeviceIDs) == 1:
    RETURN filteredDeviceIDs[0] // Unique Identification
  ELSE IF LENGTH(filteredDeviceIDs) > 1:
    //Further disambiguation using additional data (e.g. port number) or a challenge/response.
    RETURN "Multiple Devices Found - Requires Further Verification"
  ELSE:
    RETURN "Device Not Found"

FUNCTION GetDeviceFrequencySignature(deviceID):
  //Query database for pre-defined frequency signature associated with deviceID.
  //This signature might be a central frequency value, or a range.
  RETURN signature;
```

**Novelty:**

This system adds a secondary, analog identification channel to the existing power modulation technique. Itâ€™s less susceptible to spoofing (as it requires precise hardware control) and offers improved security and reliability.  The resonant frequency/impedance shift is *not* used for power delivery, only for identification, preventing any impact on performance or efficiency. This allows for a far more robust and secure identification system compared to solely relying on current modulation.
