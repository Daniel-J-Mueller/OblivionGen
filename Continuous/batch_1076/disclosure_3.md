## Modular Wearable with Dynamic Haptic Feedback & Bio-Signal Mapping

**Concept:** A wearable device platform incorporating dynamically reconfigurable haptic modules alongside advanced bio-signal acquisition and localized feedback. The core idea builds upon the band attachment method but re-imagines the band itself as a modular system capable of accepting various functional ‘pods’.

**I. Core Housing Specs:**

*   **Dimensions:** 40mm x 25mm x 10mm (adjustable via pod selection – see section III)
*   **Material:** Lightweight titanium alloy with integrated thermal management.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated low-power ARM Cortex-M7 processor with dedicated AI accelerator for on-device bio-signal analysis.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) for heart rate and HRV.
    *   Skin Conductance (GSR) sensor.
    *   3-axis accelerometer and gyroscope.
    *   Temperature sensor.
    *   Microphone array for voice control and environmental audio analysis.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth 5.2, NFC
*   **Power:** Wireless charging (Qi standard), battery life target 7 days.
*   **Attachment Mechanism:** Compatible with the existing receptacle-based band attachment (refined for modularity – see Section II).

**II. Modular Band & Receptacle System:**

*   **Receptacle Enhancement:** The receptacles on the housing are modified to include conductive pads for data/power transfer *and* micro-mechanical locking features for secure pod attachment. They are also slightly elongated to accommodate various pod widths.
*   **Band Base:** A flexible, durable band constructed from a biocompatible elastomer. Features a series of integrated, low-profile connectors spaced along its length, matching the receptacle layout on the housing.
*   **Connector Standard:** A standardized connector profile (magnetic pogo-pins combined with a dovetail-style mechanical lock) for reliable, secure pod attachment.

**III. Functional Pods (Examples):**

*   **Haptic Pod:**  An array of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) and/or piezoelectric actuators. Capable of delivering localized, programmable haptic feedback patterns. Controlled via the core housing processor, allowing for directional cues, notifications, and immersive experiences. Power draw: 50-100mW. Dimensions: 20mm x 15mm x 8mm.
*   **Bio-Signal Mapping Pod:** An expanded sensor suite including EMG sensors, EEG electrodes (dry), and advanced skin impedance analysis. Enables detailed physiological data acquisition for applications like muscle fatigue monitoring, cognitive load assessment, and stress detection. Dimensions: 25mm x 20mm x 10mm.
*   **Display Pod:** A miniature flexible OLED display (1.5” diagonal) for visual notifications, data presentation, and augmented reality overlays. Consumes up to 200mW. Dimensions: 30mm x 15mm x 6mm.
*   **Environmental Sensor Pod:** Integrated sensors for air quality (PM2.5, VOCs), UV index, and ambient noise levels. Power draw: 30mW. Dimensions: 20mm x 15mm x 7mm.

**IV. Software & Algorithm Development:**

*   **On-Device AI:**  Algorithms for real-time bio-signal analysis, anomaly detection, and personalized feedback.
*   **Haptic Pattern Generation:**  Software tools for creating custom haptic patterns based on user preferences, activity type, and bio-signal data.
*   **API & SDK:**  Open API and SDK for third-party developers to create custom applications and integrations.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Secure data synchronization with mobile devices and cloud platforms.

**V. Pseudocode – Dynamic Haptic Feedback System:**

```
// Initialize Sensors and Haptic Actuators

LOOP
    READ HeartRate, GSR, AccelerometerData
    ANALYZE Data for Stress Level (Algorithm)
    IF StressLevel > Threshold THEN
        Generate Haptic Pattern: Slow, Rhythmic Pulses on Wrist
    ELSE IF Activity = Running THEN
        Generate Haptic Pattern: Fast, Directional Pulses for Navigation
    ELSE
        Generate Default Haptic Pattern: Subtle Confirmation Pulses
    ENDIF
ENDLOOP
```

This system allows for a highly customizable wearable experience. Users can select and combine functional pods to create a device tailored to their specific needs and interests. The modular design also enables easy upgrades and repairs, extending the device's lifespan.
