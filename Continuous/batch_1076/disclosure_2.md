## Dynamic Fluidic Lens Array with Electrowetting Control

**Concept:** Leveraging the electrowetting principles in the provided patent to create a dynamically adjustable lens array for focusing and beam steering. Instead of a display, we're using the fluid control to physically reshape fluidic lenses.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:**  NxM array of microfluidic lenses. N & M are scalable, target initial prototype: 32x32.
*   **Lens Material:**  Immiscible, electrically conductive and transparent fluid (e.g., a liquid metal alloy dispersed in a dielectric carrier fluid) encapsulated within micro-chambers. Chamber material: PDMS or similar flexible polymer.
*   **Electrode Structure:** Each micro-chamber has an array of individually addressable ITO electrodes forming the bottom of the chamber.  Electrode pitch matches or exceeds capillary wavelength of fluid.
*   **Control Scheme:**  Address each lens element by applying a voltage pulse (duration > Tf/N, where Tf is the frame period and N is the number of rows).  Pulse amplitude controls the degree of fluid deformation.
*   **Lens Shape Control:**  Electrode arrangement creates a 'virtual curvature' by manipulating the fluid surface tension.  Different electrode patterns yield different lens shapes (convex, concave, cylindrical, astigmatic).
*   **Fluidic Damping:**  Chambers incorporate micro-channels to provide fluidic damping, preventing oscillations and enabling precise control.
*   **Sensing:** Integrated capacitive sensors within each chamber to provide feedback on fluid deformation and lens shape.
*   **Power:** Low-voltage operation (<5V) to minimize power consumption and heating.

**Pseudocode (Lens Shape Control):**

```
// Define lens parameters
float focalLength;
float aperture;
float astigmatism;

// Electrode voltage map (NxM array)
float voltageMap[N][M];

// Function to calculate voltage for each electrode
void calculateVoltage(float x, float y) {
  // Calculate voltage based on desired focal length, aperture, and astigmatism
  // Using a model that relates voltage to fluid curvature.
  // Example:  voltage =  k * (focalLength - distance) + astigmatism * y
  voltageMap[x][y] =  /* Voltage calculation based on lens parameters */;
}

// Main control loop
for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
    calculateVoltage(i, j);
    applyVoltageToElectrode(i, j, voltageMap[i][j]);
  }
}

// Feedback loop (using capacitive sensors)
readCapacitiveSensors();
adjustVoltageMapBasedOnSensorData();
```

**Innovation Details:**

This design moves beyond display applications of electrowetting and focuses on *physical* optical control.  The lens array could be used for adaptive optics, beam steering, microscopic imaging, or holographic projections. The integration of capacitive sensors and a feedback loop enables dynamic adjustment of lens shape, compensating for aberrations and environmental changes.  The modular array design allows for scaling and customization, tailoring the optical properties to specific applications.
