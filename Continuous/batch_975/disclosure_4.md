## Adaptive Message Prioritization & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Expand upon the ‘recorder’ concept to include dynamic message prioritization based on predicted receiver need, coupled with proactive buffering. This goes beyond simply ensuring message delivery; it aims to *anticipate* which messages will be most valuable to receivers *before* they request them, minimizing latency and maximizing efficiency.

**Specs:**

**1. Component: 'Predictive Engine'**

   *   **Function:** Analyzes receiver behavior (message request patterns, application usage, historical data) to predict future message needs.  This isn't simply 'what did they ask for last time?' but a layered analysis utilizing time series forecasting.
   *   **Inputs:**
        *   Receiver ID
        *   Message Type/Category
        *   Timestamp of previous requests
        *   Application context (if available) – e.g., streaming video, interactive game
        *   Network conditions (bandwidth, latency)
   *   **Outputs:**
        *   Priority Score (0-100) for each message type/category for each receiver.
        *   Predicted Message Request Time (estimated time receiver will request the message).

**2. Component: 'Dynamic Buffer Manager'**

   *   **Function:** Manages buffers on recorders based on Predictive Engine output.  Buffers aren’t fixed size; they dynamically allocate space based on priority and predicted need.
   *   **Inputs:**
        *   Priority Score (from Predictive Engine)
        *   Message Stream
        *   Buffer Capacity (configurable per recorder)
   *   **Logic:**
        *   Messages are assigned a ‘buffer residency time’ based on priority.  High-priority messages stay in the buffer longer.
        *   A Least Recently Predicted (LRP) algorithm evicts messages from the buffer when capacity is reached.  Messages with the lowest predicted need are evicted first.
        *   The Buffer Manager proactively requests messages from senders with high priority for specific receivers, even before a direct request is received.

**3. Component: 'Recorder Acknowledgement Protocol – Predictive Mode'**

   *   **Function:** Modifies the acknowledgement protocol to support predictive buffering.
   *   **Modification:**
        *   Recorders transmit ‘buffer status reports’ to senders, indicating which messages are proactively buffered for which receivers.
        *   Senders, upon receiving a buffer status report, can prioritize sending subsequent messages that match the buffered needs.
        *   This allows the sender to efficiently fill the buffer *before* the receiver explicitly requests the messages.

**4. Pseudocode – Recorder Operation:**

```
//On Message Receive from Sender
function receiveMessage(message) {
  priority = PredictiveEngine.getPriority(message, receiverID);
  bufferResidencyTime = calculateBufferResidency(priority);

  addToBuffer(message, bufferResidencyTime);

  transmitAcknowledgement(message);

  //Check if the buffer is full, and evict LRP messages
  if (bufferIsFull()) {
    evictLeastRecentlyPredictedMessages();
  }

  //Transmit Buffer Status Report periodically
  transmitBufferStatusReport();
}

function transmitBufferStatusReport() {
  //Create a report listing buffered message types and receiver IDs
  //Transmit report to Sender
}
```

**5. Scalability Considerations:**

*   The Predictive Engine can be distributed across recorders to reduce computational load.
*   Message prioritization can be adjusted dynamically based on overall network conditions and system load.
*   Recorders can collaborate to share predictive data and improve accuracy.
