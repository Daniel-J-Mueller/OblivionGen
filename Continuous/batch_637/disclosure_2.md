## Automated Codebase ‘Health’ Visualization & Proactive Refactoring Suggestions

**Concept:** Extend the code review system to not just *identify* issues, but to provide a continuously updating, visual ‘health’ assessment of the entire codebase, coupled with AI-driven proactive refactoring suggestions.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** ‘Codebase Health Monitor’ - a service that runs continuously (or on a scheduled basis) against a repository.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Existing ML models & rules from the patent (for issue detection).
    *   Code complexity metrics (cyclomatic complexity, lines of code, cognitive complexity).
    *   Dependency analysis (identifying fragile or outdated dependencies).
    *   Code churn data (frequency of changes to specific files/modules).
    *   Test coverage data.
    *   Static analysis results (linting, security vulnerability scans).
*   **Visualization Layer:**
    *   Interactive ‘Codebase Map’ - a graphical representation of the repository.  Modules are nodes, dependencies are edges. Node color indicates ‘health’ (green = healthy, yellow = moderate issues, red = critical issues). Edge thickness indicates dependency strength/coupling.
    *   Drill-down capability: Clicking on a node opens a detailed view of the module, showing specific issues, complexity metrics, and refactoring suggestions.
    *   ‘Heatmaps’ for code churn and test coverage.
*   **Refactoring Suggestions Engine:**
    *   AI-powered engine that analyzes detected issues and codebase metrics to suggest refactoring actions.
    *   Suggestions categorized by impact (low, medium, high) and estimated effort (time/complexity).
    *   Examples:
        *   “Extract this complex method into smaller, more manageable functions.”
        *   “Replace this tightly coupled module with a more loosely coupled design pattern (e.g., Dependency Injection).”
        *   “Identify and remove unused code.”
        *   "Suggest improved error handling based on common failure patterns."
        *   "Flag potential performance bottlenecks in frequently used code paths."
    *   Integration with IDEs:  Allow developers to apply refactoring suggestions directly from their IDE.
*   **Proactive Monitoring:**
    *   Define ‘health’ thresholds.  Alert developers when codebase ‘health’ falls below these thresholds.
    *   Predictive analysis:  Identify modules that are likely to become problematic in the future (based on code churn, complexity, and dependency trends).

**Pseudocode (Refactoring Suggestions Engine):**

```
function generateRefactoringSuggestions(module) {
  issues = getIssues(module)
  complexity = calculateComplexity(module)
  dependencies = getDependencies(module)

  suggestions = []

  if (complexity > threshold) {
    suggestions.add("Refactor to reduce complexity. Consider applying SOLID principles.")
  }

  for each issue in issues {
    if (issue.severity == "critical") {
      suggestions.add("Address critical issue: " + issue.description + ".  Consider using pattern X to mitigate.")
    }
  }

  if (dependencies.count > dependencyThreshold) {
    suggestions.add("Reduce dependencies to improve maintainability.")
  }

  //AI powered suggestion generation
  aiSuggestions = callAIModel(module, issues, complexity, dependencies)
  suggestions.addAll(aiSuggestions)

  return suggestions
}
```
