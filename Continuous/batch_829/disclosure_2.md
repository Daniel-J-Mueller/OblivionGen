## Dynamic Projection Surface Material Control

**Concept:** A system that actively modifies the *physical* properties of the projection surface itself, in conjunction with dynamic image correction, to enhance contrast, color accuracy, and viewing angle.

**Specifications:**

*   **Projection Surface:** Composed of microfluidic cells containing electrochromic or thermochromic materials. Each cell acts as an individual pixel of controllable reflectivity/absorptivity/color. Cells are arranged in a grid matching or exceeding the resolution of the projector.
*   **Sensor Array:** Integrated into the projection surface, measuring ambient light, viewing angle (via infrared or stereoscopic cameras), and projector light intensity at each microfluidic cell.
*   **Control System:** A processor coordinating data from the sensor array, applying image correction algorithms, *and* controlling the state of each microfluidic cell.
*   **Microfluidic Actuation:** Precision micro-pumps and valves regulating the flow of fluids within the cells. Fluids contain materials exhibiting controllable optical properties (e.g., changing color, reflectivity).
*   **Communication:** High-bandwidth, low-latency communication between the projector, sensor array, and control system.
*   **Power Delivery:** Integrated power grid to drive micro-pumps, valves, and sensors.

**Operation:**

1.  **Calibration:** System scans the projection environment and characterizes the projection surfaceâ€™s initial reflectance and any existing irregularities.
2.  **Sensor Input:** Sensors continuously measure ambient light, viewing angle, and projector light intensity.
3.  **Image Correction & Surface Control:**
    *   Processor applies traditional image correction algorithms (keystone correction, color balancing) as in the original patent.
    *   *Additionally*, the processor calculates optimal states for each microfluidic cell based on the sensor data and the desired image output.  For instance:
        *   **Contrast Enhancement:** Darken cells in areas receiving high ambient light to improve shadow detail.
        *   **Color Accuracy:** Adjust cell color to compensate for surface color casts.
        *   **Viewing Angle Compensation:** Brighten cells viewed from off-axis angles to maintain brightness.
        *   **Dynamic Masking:**  Create a localized 'black mask' around bright image elements to reduce bloom and enhance perceived contrast.
4.  **Microfluidic Actuation:** Control system activates micro-pumps and valves to precisely regulate fluid flow within each cell, altering its optical properties.
5.  **Projected Image:** Projector emits light which interacts with the dynamically controlled projection surface, resulting in a superior image.

**Pseudocode (Core Control Loop):**

```
FOR EACH pixel IN ProjectionSurface:
    ambientLight = SensorArray.GetAmbientLight(pixel)
    viewingAngle = SensorArray.GetViewingAngle(pixel)
    projectorIntensity = SensorArray.GetProjectorIntensity(pixel)
    desiredColor = SourceImage.GetPixelColor(pixel)

    // Calculate optimal cell state
    cellState = CalculateCellState(desiredColor, ambientLight, viewingAngle, projectorIntensity)

    // Actuate microfluidic cell
    MicrofluidicController.SetCellState(pixel, cellState)
END FOR
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly improved contrast and color accuracy.
*   Wider viewing angle with minimal brightness loss.
*   Adaptation to any ambient lighting condition.
*   Reduced reliance on projector brightness.
*   Creation of novel visual effects (e.g., dynamic textures).
