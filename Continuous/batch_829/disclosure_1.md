**Adaptive Acoustic Spatialization via Light Ring Array**

**Concept:** Extend the light ring visual cues to become an active component of spatial audio delivery, dynamically shaping the soundscape perceived by the user. Instead of *indicating* participant location, the light ring *creates* the perceived location.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of 360-degree facing miniature directional speakers embedded *within* the existing light ring structure. Each speaker corresponds to a segment of the ring.
    *   High-resolution microphone array (existing in device) for accurate audio source localization.
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time beamforming and spatial audio rendering.

*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Audio Source Localization:** Utilize the microphone array to pinpoint the direction of each participant's speech.
    2.  **Beamforming & Spatial Audio Rendering:**
        *   Divide the 360-degree space around the user into discrete segments, each associated with a specific speaker in the light ring.
        *   Dynamically adjust the amplitude and phase of the audio signal sent to each speaker to create the illusion that sound originates from the localized direction of each participant.
        *   Employ head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) personalized to the user (through initial calibration) to enhance the realism of the spatial audio effect.
    3.  **Visual-Auditory Fusion:** Synchronize the light ring’s visual indications (existing functionality) with the spatial audio cues. The lit segment of the ring visually reinforces the perceived location of the speaker.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update the beamforming and visual cues as participants move or speak simultaneously.
    5.  **Profile Integration:** Utilize user profiles to store preferred spatial audio settings (e.g., widening/narrowing of the soundscape) and personalized HRTFs.

*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// On receiving audio data from participant X
localize_audio_source(audio_data_X) -> direction_X

// Calculate speaker activation levels based on direction
speaker_levels = calculate_speaker_levels(direction_X)

// Apply speaker levels to audio data
modified_audio_X = apply_speaker_levels(audio_data_X, speaker_levels)

// Send modified audio to speakers
play_audio(modified_audio_X)

// Activate corresponding segment of light ring
activate_light_segment(direction_X)
```

*   **Refinements:**
    *   Implement a “focus mode” where the system prioritizes audio from the currently active speaker, dynamically adjusting the soundscape to enhance clarity.
    *   Add support for virtual “rooms” where participants can be placed in different locations around the user, creating a more immersive experience.
    *   Develop a gesture-based interface for manually adjusting participant positions within the virtual space.
    *   Investigate using the light ring to create directional haptic feedback through ultrasound or other localized stimulus.
