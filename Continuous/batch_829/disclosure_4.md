## Dynamic Sensory Item Representation

**Concept:** Expand item representation beyond visual/textual attributes to incorporate real-time environmental sensory data to influence presentation and prioritization. This creates a highly personalized and contextual item experience.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensory Data Acquisition:**
    *   Integrate with device sensors (client computing device) to gather data: ambient light level, sound intensity/type, temperature, humidity, detected motion, geolocation, time of day, weather conditions.
    *   Optional: Integrate with external data sources (weather APIs, traffic APIs, social media trends – with user permission).

2.  **Sensory Mapping Engine:**
    *   Develop a mapping system (likely a neural network) to associate sensory data with item attributes and user preferences.
    *   Example mappings:
        *   Low light + quiet environment -> prioritize audio book representations.
        *   High ambient noise + commute detected (geolocation/motion) -> prioritize shorter-form content, or content with high energy.
        *   Cold weather -> prioritize cozy/comfort-themed items.
        *   Rainy day -> prioritize introspective/moody content.
    *   User profiles store personalized mappings – the system learns which sensory conditions influence their choices.

3.  **Dynamic Prioritization Algorithm:**
    *   Modify the existing prioritization algorithm to incorporate a “sensory score.”
    *   The sensory score adjusts the priority of instance types and attributes based on the real-time sensory data and user-defined mappings.
    *   Formula: `Final Priority = (Existing Priority * Weight) + (Sensory Score * Sensory Weight)`
        *   `Weight` and `Sensory Weight` are adjustable parameters to control the influence of each factor.
    *   Example: If a user consistently chooses audiobooks in low-light conditions, the system increases the priority of audiobook representations when those conditions are detected.

4.  **Adaptive Item Representation:**
    *   Beyond prioritization, dynamically *modify* item representations based on sensory data.
    *   Example:
        *   Dark mode activation based on ambient light level.
        *   Displaying a “warm” color palette during cold weather.
        *   Subtle animations mimicking rain or snowfall during relevant weather conditions.
        *   Adjusting the volume of audio previews based on ambient noise levels.

5.  **User Control & Customization:**
    *   Allow users to:
        *   Enable/disable sensory adaptation.
        *   Customize the influence of different sensory factors.
        *   Define their own sensory mappings.
        *   Provide feedback on the relevance of sensory recommendations.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Sensor Data Acquisition
sensorData = getSensorData()  // Returns object: {lightLevel, soundIntensity, temperature, ...}

// Load User Profile & Preferences
userProfile = loadUserProfile()
sensoryPreferences = userProfile.sensoryPreferences

// Apply Sensory Mappings
sensoryScore = calculateSensoryScore(sensorData, sensoryPreferences)

// Retrieve Initial Item Priority (from existing algorithm)
initialPriority = getItemPriority(item, userHistory)

// Calculate Final Priority
finalPriority = (initialPriority * weight) + (sensoryScore * sensoryWeight)

// Adjust Item Representation (if applicable)
adjustedRepresentation = applySensoryRepresentation(item, sensorData)

// Display Item with Final Priority & Adjusted Representation
displayItem(item, finalPriority, adjustedRepresentation)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Client devices with sensors (light, microphone, accelerometer, GPS).
*   Access to external APIs (weather, traffic).
*   Machine learning framework for training sensory mapping models.
*   Scalable backend infrastructure for storing user profiles and processing data.
