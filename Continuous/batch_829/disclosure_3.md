## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predictive User Behavior & ‘Digital Twin’ Modeling

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the resource planning outlined in the patent by introducing a ‘digital twin’ for each major customer. This digital twin isn’t just usage statistics, but a simulated environment mirroring the customer’s application workloads and anticipated behavioral patterns. It aims to proactively adjust resource allocation *before* demand spikes, moving beyond reactive forecasting.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Pattern Engine (BPE):**
    *   **Input:** Historical VM usage data, application logs, user activity data (where permissible and anonymized), and external event streams (e.g., marketing campaigns, scheduled product releases).
    *   **Process:** Employs machine learning (specifically, recurrent neural networks and reinforcement learning) to model customer behavior. This includes identifying common usage patterns, predicting future needs based on context (day of week, time of day, special events), and simulating ‘what-if’ scenarios.
    *   **Output:** Probabilistic forecasts of resource demand, expressed as a range of likely values for each VM type.

2.  **Digital Twin Environment (DTE):**
    *   **Construction:** For each significant customer, a virtualized replica of their application stack is created. This includes VMs, databases, networking configurations, and representative data sets.
    *   **Simulation:** The BPE’s forecasted demand is fed into the DTE, driving simulated workload tests. This allows the system to evaluate the impact of different resource allocation strategies *before* they are implemented in the live environment.
    *   **Optimization:** The DTE uses a genetic algorithm to explore the resource allocation space, searching for the configuration that minimizes cost, maximizes performance, and meets service level agreements (SLAs).

3.  **Proactive Resource Orchestrator (PRO):**
    *   **Input:** Optimized resource allocation plan from the DTE.
    *   **Process:** Automatically provisions and de-provisions resources in the live environment, adjusting VM counts, storage capacity, and network bandwidth based on the predicted demand.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Monitors actual resource utilization and performance, feeding this data back into the BPE and DTE to refine the models and improve the accuracy of future predictions.

**Pseudocode – PRO Component:**

```
FUNCTION OrchestrateResources(customerID, allocationPlan)
  // allocationPlan = { VMType1: count, VMType2: count, ... }

  FOR EACH VMType, Count IN allocationPlan
    currentCount = GetCurrentVMCount(VMType, customerID)
    
    IF Count > currentCount
      //Provision new VMs
      FOR i = 1 TO (Count - currentCount)
        ProvisionVM(VMType, customerID)
    ELSE IF Count < currentCount
      //De-provision VMs
      FOR i = 1 TO (currentCount - Count)
        DeProvisionVM(VMType, customerID)
    END IF
  END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Usage statistics are collected from the live environment.
2.  The BPE analyzes the data and generates probabilistic demand forecasts.
3.  The DTE uses the forecasts to simulate workload tests and optimize resource allocation.
4.  The PRO automatically provisions and de-provisions resources in the live environment based on the optimized plan.
5.  The system continuously monitors performance and refines the models and allocation strategies.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced resource waste and cost savings.
*   Improved application performance and user experience.
*   Proactive scaling that anticipates demand spikes.
*   Enhanced resilience and availability.
*   Ability to support new applications and workloads more efficiently.
