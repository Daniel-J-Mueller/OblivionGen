## Adaptive Resonance Contact Sensor Array

**Concept:** Expand the functionality of a simple contact sensor into an array capable of ‘mapping’ surface texture and subtle pressure variations – effectively, a rudimentary ‘touch’ sensor for non-biological surfaces. This goes beyond simple contact detection to provide information about *how* something is being touched.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Dimensions:** Minimum 8x8 grid of individual sensor elements. Scalable to 32x32 or higher for increased resolution.
*   **Element Type:** Capacitive or piezoresistive sensors are preferred, allowing for detection of both contact *and* subtle pressure changes. Each element should have an independent analog output.
*   **Spacing:** Sensor element spacing should be adjustable, between 1mm - 5mm, to accommodate different surface textures and desired resolution. Physical adjustment mechanism integrated into the sensor array housing.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Integrated microcontroller with 8-bit ADC per sensor element. Sampling rate: 100Hz minimum, adjustable up to 1kHz.
*   **Communication:** I2C or SPI interface for data transmission to a host device (microcontroller, computer).
*   **Housing:** Flexible, conformable substrate (e.g., silicone or flexible PCB) to allow the array to adapt to curved surfaces.  Should include a protective overmold to prevent damage to sensor elements.
*   **Power Requirements:** 3.3V or 5V operation.  Low power sleep mode for battery-powered applications.
*   **Adaptive Resonance Algorithm:**
    *   **Initialization:** Establish a baseline reading for each sensor element when no contact is present.
    *   **Contact Detection:** Identify sensor elements that exceed a predefined threshold.
    *   **Pressure Mapping:** Assign a value to each active sensor element proportional to the pressure applied.
    *   **Resonance Calculation:**  Implement a simple 'resonance' algorithm.  When a sensor element is activated, its immediate neighbors (N, S, E, W) will have their sensitivity *increased* temporarily. This simulates how touch propagates on a surface.  If multiple neighboring sensors are active, the amplification is reduced to avoid ‘ringing’.
    *   **Data Output:** Output a 'touch map' – a matrix of pressure values representing the contact area.  Include a timestamp for each reading.

**Pseudocode (Microcontroller Firmware):**

```
// Initialize ADC, I2C/SPI, Sensor Elements
// Establish Baseline Readings

loop:
  readSensorArray()
  detectContact()

  if (contactDetected):
    calculatePressureMap()
    applyResonance()
    transmitData()

  delay(10ms)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Robotics - Tactile feedback for grasping objects.
*   Human-Machine Interfaces - Intuitive touch control surfaces.
*   Industrial Automation - Quality control - detecting surface defects.
*   Security - Pressure sensitive mat to detect intruders.
*   Artistic Installations - Interactive sculptures.
