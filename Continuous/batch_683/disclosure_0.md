## Adaptive Workload Sharding with Predictive Failure Modeling

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting workload partitions and event processor assignments based on predictive failure modeling, exceeding simple heartbeat monitoring.

**Core Concept:** Move beyond reactive failure detection to *proactive* workload redistribution based on predicted processor health.

**Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Collection Agent:** Each event processor reports detailed performance metrics – CPU usage, memory pressure, I/O latency, network bandwidth, error rates, even correlation data (e.g., number of failed requests for a specific resource) – to a central Telemetry Aggregator.
2.  **Telemetry Aggregator:** Receives, normalizes, and stores telemetry data from all event processors. Implements anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., time-series forecasting, statistical process control).
3.  **Predictive Failure Model:** A machine learning model (trained on historical telemetry data and failure events) that predicts the probability of failure for each event processor within a defined time window. Model types could include:
    *   Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) – for time-series analysis.
    *   Gradient Boosted Trees – for feature importance analysis and accurate predictions.
4.  **Workload Shard Manager:** Responsible for dividing the overall workload into shards (partitions). This component uses the Predictive Failure Model to influence shard assignment.
5.  **Dynamic Shard Rebalancer:** Monitors the Predictive Failure Model output and dynamically rebalances shards based on predicted risk.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Shard Assignment:** Workload Shard Manager assigns shards to event processors, considering initial capacity and load.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Telemetry Collection Agents continuously send performance metrics to the Telemetry Aggregator.
3.  **Predictive Modeling:** The Predictive Failure Model analyzes the telemetry data and calculates a failure probability for each event processor.
4.  **Risk-Aware Rebalancing:** The Dynamic Shard Rebalancer monitors the failure probabilities. When an event processor's predicted failure probability exceeds a predefined threshold:
    *   The Rebalancer identifies shards currently assigned to that processor.
    *   It migrates those shards to healthy event processors with sufficient capacity.
    *   Shard migration is designed to minimize disruption to ongoing processes (e.g., using techniques like state transfer or consistent hashing).
5.  **Capacity Adjustment:** The system monitors the overall load on event processors and automatically adjusts the number of shards assigned to each processor to maintain optimal performance.
6.  **Model Retraining:** The Predictive Failure Model is periodically retrained with new telemetry data to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Shard Rebalancer):**

```
function rebalanceShards() {
  for each eventProcessor in eventProcessors {
    failureProbability = PredictiveFailureModel.predict(eventProcessor.telemetry);

    if (failureProbability > threshold) {
      shardsToMigrate = eventProcessor.assignedShards;

      for each shard in shardsToMigrate {
        healthyProcessor = findHealthiestProcessorWithCapacity(shard.size);
        moveShard(shard, healthyProcessor);
        eventProcessor.removeShard(shard);
        healthyProcessor.addShard(shard);
      }
    }
  }
}

function findHealthiestProcessorWithCapacity(shardSize) {
  // Iterate through available event processors
  // Prioritize processors with:
  // 1. Lowest current load
  // 2. Lowest predicted failure probability
  // 3. Sufficient remaining capacity
  return bestProcessor;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `EventProcessor`:  `id`, `currentLoad`, `capacity`, `failureProbability`, `assignedShards`
*   `Shard`: `id`, `size`, `owner` (EventProcessor ID)
*   `TelemetryData`: Timestamped performance metrics (CPU, memory, I/O, etc.)
