## Temporal Data Access & Dynamic Permission Inheritance

**Concept:** Extend the core permission system to incorporate *time-based access control* and *dynamic permission inheritance* based on user relationships and contextual data. This builds on the intrinsic/share/copy permissions by adding layers of temporal validity and relational privilege.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Permission Block:** (Existing – as per patent) – intrinsic, share, copy permissions (accessible, content accessible, etc.).
*   **Temporal Validity Block:**
    *   `startTime`: Timestamp – When permission becomes active.
    *   `endTime`: Timestamp – When permission expires.  If null, permission is perpetual.
    *   `renewalPolicy`: Enum – `NEVER`, `AUTOMATIC`, `MANUAL`.  Determines if permission is renewed.
*   **Relationship Block:**
    *   `relationshipType`: Enum – `OWNER`, `COLLABORATOR`, `VIEWER`, `FAMILY`, `EMPLOYEE`, `PROJECT_MEMBER` (extensible).
    *   `relationshipStrength`: Integer –  (0-100) – Represents the degree of association/trust. Influences inherited permissions.
    *    `contextualData`: JSON –  Arbitrary metadata relating to the relationship – location, device type, security clearance, etc.

**2. System Components:**

*   **Temporal Permission Manager (TPM):**  Responsible for enforcing time-based access control.  Queries current time against `startTime` and `endTime` of permissions.
*   **Relationship Engine (RE):**  Maintains and evaluates user relationships.  Calculates `relationshipStrength` based on associated data.
*   **Permission Inheritance Engine (PIE):**  Derives permissions for a user based on their relationships to the content owner or creator.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Content Creation:** Creator assigns intrinsic, share, and copy permissions as per the existing patent.  They *optionally* specify a Temporal Validity Block.
2.  **Relationship Establishment:** Users define relationships with each other (e.g., "Alice is Bob's Manager," "Charlie is a Collaborator on Project X").  Relationship data and `contextualData` are stored in the RE.
3.  **Access Request:**  A user requests access to content.
4.  **Permission Evaluation:**
    *   TPM checks if the current time falls within the Temporal Validity Block (if present). If not, access is denied.
    *   PIE determines the user’s effective permissions:
        *   **Direct Permissions:**  Permissions explicitly assigned to the user.
        *   **Inherited Permissions:**
            *   PIE retrieves relationships between the requesting user and the content creator/owner.
            *   For each relationship, PIE calculates a weighted permission score based on `relationshipType`, `relationshipStrength`, and any relevant `contextualData`. (e.g., a "Manager" relationship with high `relationshipStrength` might grant almost full access; a "Viewer" relationship with low strength might grant read-only access).
            *   The weighted permission scores are combined to determine the user's effective inherited permissions.
    *   Direct permissions *override* inherited permissions.
    *   The final effective permissions (direct + inherited) are used to determine access.

**4. Pseudocode (PIE - Permission Inheritance):**

```
function calculateInheritedPermissions(requestingUser, contentOwner, content):
  relationships = RelationshipEngine.getRelationships(requestingUser, contentOwner)
  inheritedPermissions = {}

  for relationship in relationships:
    relationshipType = relationship.type
    relationshipStrength = relationship.strength
    context = relationship.context

    // Define weighting factors for each relationship type
    weightingFactor = 0
    if relationshipType == "OWNER": weightingFactor = 1.0
    else if relationshipType == "COLLABORATOR": weightingFactor = 0.8
    else if relationshipType == "FAMILY": weightingFactor = 0.6
    else if relationshipType == "EMPLOYEE": weightingFactor = 0.5
    else if relationshipType == "VIEWER": weightingFactor = 0.2

    // Apply contextual adjustments (example: location-based access)
    if context.location != requestingUser.location: weightingFactor *= 0.5

    // Calculate weighted permission score for each permission type
    for permissionType in content.permissions:
      score = content.permissions[permissionType] * weightingFactor
      inheritedPermissions[permissionType] = max(inheritedPermissions.get(permissionType, 0), score)

  return inheritedPermissions
```

**5.  Extensible Permission Types:**

Add permission types beyond those listed in the patent:

*   `geoAccess`: Boolean – Restrict access based on geographic location.
*   `deviceAccess`: Boolean – Restrict access to specific devices.
*   `timeOfDayAccess`: Boolean – Restrict access to certain times of the day.

This system adds layers of granularity and dynamism to data access control, going beyond static permissions to accommodate evolving relationships and contextual factors.
