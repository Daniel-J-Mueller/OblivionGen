**Haptic Projection System: Dynamic Texture Mapping**

**Core Concept:** Expand the projection system beyond simple UI elements. Instead of projecting *onto* a hand to create a virtual interface, project dynamic tactile textures *around* the hand, creating localized haptic feedback without direct contact.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Array of micro-ultrasonic transducers and infrared proximity sensors positioned around a capture volume (approximately 0.5m x 0.5m x 0.5m).  These form a 'skeleton' tracking system independent of the camera used for image processing.
*   **Projection System:**  High-speed pico-projectors (minimum 240Hz refresh rate) integrated into the sensor suite skeleton, capable of projecting highly localized light patterns. These are focused on the air *around* the user’s hand, not directly onto it.
*   **Acoustic Levitation Array (ALA):** Miniaturized ALA positioned at the projection points.  ALA uses focused ultrasound to create localized air pressure variations. This will form the 'texture' the user feels.  Frequency range: 20-200 kHz. Amplitude control: 0-10mW.
*   **Image Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  Camera feed captures hand position and orientation.
    2.  Skeleton sensor array provides precise hand boundary and proximity data for refining the tracking.
    3.  Hand segmentation identifies fingers, palm, and back of hand.
    4.  ‘Texture Map’ Generation:  Based on user application/input, a 3D texture map is created. This map defines the desired haptic feedback - e.g., the feel of buttons, the texture of a virtual object.
    5.  Localized Projection & ALA Activation: The system projects light patterns onto the air, creating a visual 'outline' of the texture. Simultaneously, the ALA is activated to create corresponding air pressure variations, giving the user the sensation of touching the texture.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    1.  **Haptic Engine:** Core module responsible for translating user input/application data into appropriate ALA activation patterns and visual projections.
    2.  **Tracking & Calibration Module:**  Manages sensor data, hand tracking, and calibration of the projection/ALA system.
    3.  **Application API:**  Allows developers to create applications that utilize the haptic projection system.
*   **Control Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateHapticFeedback(hand_position, texture_map, application_input):
  // Hand position: 3D coordinates of hand center
  // Texture_map: 3D array defining texture properties (height, friction, etc.)
  // Application_input: Data from the application (e.g., button press, object interaction)

  FOR each point in texture_map:
    // Calculate projected location of point onto air around the hand
    projected_location = CalculateProjectedLocation(point, hand_position)

    // Determine ALA activation parameters (frequency, amplitude) based on texture properties
    ala_parameters = CalculateAlaParameters(point.height, point.friction)

    // Activate ALA at projected_location with ala_parameters
    ActivateAla(projected_location, ala_parameters)

    // Project visual highlight onto air at projected_location
    ProjectVisualHighlight(projected_location)

  END FOR
END FUNCTION

*   **Material Specs:** Pico-projectors: Micro-LED. ALA Transducers: Piezoelectric Ceramics. Sensor Housing: Lightweight Carbon Fiber.
*   **Power Requirements:** 5V DC, max 20W.



This system moves beyond *visual* projection onto a hand, to creating a localized haptic experience *around* the hand. It doesn't require direct contact and allows for a wider range of tactile sensations.
