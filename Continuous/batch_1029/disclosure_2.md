## Predictive Resource Allocation for Distributed Autonomous Systems

**System Overview:** A system for dynamically allocating computational resources to a fleet of distributed autonomous systems (e.g., drones, robots) *before* a task is fully defined, based on projected needs derived from user intent and environmental analysis. This moves beyond reactive prioritization (as in the referenced patent) to *proactive* resource staging.

**Core Innovation:** Utilizing a probabilistic intent model and real-time environment mapping to predict resource demands *before* task initiation.  This allows pre-allocation of compute, bandwidth, and even physical resources (e.g., docking stations, charging points) to ensure smooth operation even under high load or unforeseen circumstances.

**System Components:**

1.  **Intent Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Input:** High-level user commands (e.g., “Inspect the north field,” “Deliver package to location X,” “Establish perimeter security”).  Also accepts streaming data from user wearables (biometrics, gaze tracking) to infer implicit intent.
    *   **Model:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a corpus of user commands and associated task executions.  The RNN outputs a probability distribution over potential task decompositions (e.g., for “Inspect the north field,” possible decompositions include “aerial survey,” “ground-based sensor sweep,” or a combination).
    *   **Output:** A weighted set of potential task decompositions, each with an associated probability.

2.  **Environmental Mapping & Prediction Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time data from environmental sensors (cameras, lidar, weather stations, network traffic monitors).
    *   **Model:** A spatio-temporal graph neural network (GNN) that represents the environment as a graph. Nodes represent locations, and edges represent connections (e.g., roads, network links). The GNN predicts changes in environmental conditions (e.g., traffic congestion, weather events, network outages).
    *   **Output:** A probabilistic forecast of environmental conditions over a defined time horizon.

3.  **Resource Allocation Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Weighted task decompositions (from Intent Prediction Engine), environmental forecasts (from Environmental Mapping Module), current resource availability (CPU, memory, bandwidth, battery levels, docking station availability of each DAS).
    *   **Algorithm:** A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) optimization model.
        *   **Objective Function:** Minimize total latency, maximize task completion probability, minimize resource contention.
        *   **Constraints:** Resource capacities, task dependencies, communication ranges, DAS battery life.
        *   **Key MILP Variables:**
            *   *x<sub>ijk</sub>*: Binary variable indicating whether task *i* is assigned to DAS *j* for execution at location *k*.
            *   *y<sub>ij</sub>*: Binary variable indicating whether DAS *j* is allocated to the task.
            *   *z<sub>ij</sub>*: Continuous variable representing the amount of bandwidth allocated to DAS *j*.

        **Pseudocode:**

        ```
        function allocateResources(task, DAS_fleet, environment_forecast):
          task_decompositions = IntentPredictionEngine(task)
          resource_demands = calculateResourceDemands(task_decompositions)
          
          # Construct MILP model
          model = MILPModel()
          model.objective = minimize(total_latency + maximize(completion_probability) + minimize(resource_contention))
          
          # Add constraints: resource capacity, task dependencies, communication ranges
          for resource in resources:
            model.addConstraint(sum(resource_usage) <= resource_capacity)
          
          for task_decomposition in task_decompositions:
            model.addConstraint(task_decomposition.dependencies_met())
            
          # Solve MILP
          solution = solve(model)
          
          # Assign tasks to DAS based on solution
          for i in range(num_tasks):
            best_DAS = solution.getBestDAS(i)
            assignTask(i, best_DAS)
          
          return solution
        ```

    *   **Output:** A schedule of task assignments to DAS, along with allocated resources.

4.  **Dynamic Adjustment Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time feedback from DAS (e.g., resource usage, task completion status, environmental changes).
    *   **Algorithm:** Reinforcement learning agent (e.g., Q-learning) that learns to adapt the resource allocation schedule based on observed performance.
    *   **Output:** Adjusted resource allocation schedule.

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond prioritization of updates to *proactive* allocation of resources *before* task execution, utilizing probabilistic intent modeling and dynamic adjustment based on real-time feedback. This enables a more robust and efficient operation of distributed autonomous systems in complex and unpredictable environments.
