## Personalized Interactive Documentary Streams

**Concept:** Expand the personalized media stream concept to interactive documentary experiences. Instead of passively watching previews, users can dynamically explore documentary footage based on their interests, influencing the narrative flow.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Data Structure: “Documentary Node”**

*   `NodeID`: Unique identifier for each footage segment.
*   `FootageURL`: URL to the video segment.
*   `SummaryText`: Short text description of the segment.
*   `Keywords`: Array of keywords describing the segment’s content (e.g., "Amazon Rainforest", "Indigenous Culture", "Deforestation").
*   `TopicWeightings`: Numerical values representing the segment’s relevance to broad documentary topics (e.g., "Environment": 0.8, "Politics": 0.2, "Culture": 0.5).
*   `InteractiveElements`:  Array of objects defining interactive points within the footage. Each object includes:
    *   `Timestamp`: Timecode within the footage where the interaction occurs.
    *   `InteractionType`: Type of interaction (e.g., “Info Popup”, “Branching Narrative”, “360° Viewpoint Change”).
    *   `DataPayload`:  Data relevant to the interaction (e.g., text for the popup, NodeID for the branching narrative segment).

**2. User Profile Extension:**

*   `InterestVectors`:  Multi-dimensional vectors representing user interests. Dimensions correspond to documentary topics. Values represent the strength of the interest. (Learned from watch history, explicit selections, keyword searches, etc.).
*   `ExplorationStyle`:  Preference for "Guided Exploration" (narrative-driven, curated segments) vs. "Freeform Exploration" (unconstrained access to footage).

**3. Stream Generation Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function generateInteractiveStream(userID, initialChannelID, streamLength):
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userID)
  channelData = getChannelData(initialChannelID)
  stream = []
  currentTopicWeighting = channelData.topicWeighting

  for i = 0 to streamLength:
    // 1. Find Relevant Nodes
    relevantNodes = findNodes(currentTopicWeighting, userProfile.interestVectors)

    // 2. Rank Nodes (combination of relevance, diversity, and novelty)
    rankedNodes = rankNodes(relevantNodes, userProfile, stream)

    // 3. Select Node
    selectedNode = selectNode(rankedNodes, userProfile.explorationStyle)

    // 4. Append to Stream
    stream.append(selectedNode)

    // 5. Update Topic Weighting (based on user interaction with the selected node)
    currentTopicWeighting = updateTopicWeighting(currentTopicWeighting, selectedNode)

  return stream
```

**4. Client-Side Application Features:**

*   **Interactive Playback:** Seamless playback of documentary nodes.
*   **Interaction Handling:**  Process interactive elements within the footage. (e.g., display info popups, navigate to branching narrative segments.)
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Topic Explorer:**  Allows users to browse documentary topics and influence the stream's direction.
    *   **Exploration Mode Switch:**  Toggle between "Guided" and "Freeform" exploration.
    *   **Dynamic Thumbnail Generation:** Generate thumbnails that reflect the content of each documentary node and user interaction.
*   **Real-time Feedback:**  Collect user interaction data to refine the stream generation algorithm.

**5.  Advertising Integration:**

*   Contextually relevant advertisements integrated seamlessly into the stream. (e.g., advertisements for sustainable products during segments about environmental issues.)
*   Optional "Sponsored Segments" where brands contribute footage related to the documentary's themes.
*   User control over ad frequency and content.

This system creates a genuinely personalized documentary experience, enabling viewers to delve deeper into topics that interest them and explore the world in a more interactive and meaningful way. It goes beyond passive consumption to active exploration.
