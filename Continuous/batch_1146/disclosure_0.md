## Dynamic Relevance Weighting via User-Driven "Challenge" System

**Concept:** Extend the user-suggested attribute system by introducing a “challenge” mechanism. Instead of passively accepting suggestions, implement a system where users can actively *challenge* the relevance of existing attributes (both system-provided and user-submitted) for a given item *in the context of a specific search query*. This creates a dynamic, query-dependent weighting of relevance, improving search precision.

**Specs:**

1.  **“Challenge” Button/Interface:** On search result pages, alongside each displayed attribute (including user suggestions), implement a "Challenge Relevance" button/link.
2.  **Challenge Context Input:** Upon clicking "Challenge Relevance," the user is prompted to enter *why* the attribute is irrelevant to *their current search*. This input is free-text, but with character limits.  Crucially, this input is tied to the specific search query that triggered the challenge.
3.  **Challenge Voting/Verification:**  Challenges are not immediately acted upon.  A separate user group (either a dedicated verification team or other users with high "trust" scores – see existing claim 24/25) votes on the validity of the challenge. Challenges require a threshold of votes (e.g., 75%) to be considered valid.
4.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**
    *   If a challenge is valid, the weight of the challenged attribute is *temporarily* reduced for that *specific user’s* future searches.  The degree of reduction is proportional to the number of valid challenges received.
    *   If an attribute receives *multiple* valid challenges across *multiple* users, its overall system weight is reduced for *all* users.
5.  **"Relevance Boost" Feature:** Users can also actively *boost* the relevance of an attribute for their current search. Boosting functions similarly to challenging, requiring verification from other users. Successful boosts increase the attribute weight for that user’s future searches.
6.  **Algorithm Pseudocode:**

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_relevance_score(item, query, user):
      base_score = 0
      for attribute in item.attributes:
        attribute_weight = attribute.weight
        // Apply user-specific challenge/boost adjustments
        if user has challenged attribute for query:
          attribute_weight = attribute_weight * challenge_reduction_factor
        if user has boosted attribute for query:
          attribute_weight = attribute_weight * boost_increase_factor

        // Calculate relevance based on attribute & query
        relevance_component = calculate_attribute_relevance(attribute, query)
        base_score += relevance_component * attribute_weight

      return base_score
    ```

7. **Data Storage:**
   * Store user challenges and boosts with associated search queries.
   * Track challenge/boost verification votes.
   * Maintain a “dynamic weight” field for each attribute, updated based on challenge/boost data.

8. **Trust Score Integration**: High-trust users' challenge/boost votes carry more weight.

**Novelty**: This differs from the existing patent by *actively soliciting* negative feedback (challenges) and using it to refine search results *in real-time, and on a per-user basis*. It’s not just about adding attributes; it’s about dynamically adjusting their importance based on user behavior and contextual relevance.  This creates a self-learning search system.
