## Dynamic Battery Prioritization & Predictive Cycling

**Concept:** Implement a system that dynamically prioritizes battery units based on predicted load, age, and health, and proactively cycles batteries *before* reaching critical maintenance thresholds. This moves beyond reactive cycling (based on time or usage) to a predictive, optimized approach maximizing uptime and extending battery lifespan.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Real-time power draw from all connected electronic components.
    *   Individual battery unit health metrics (voltage, internal resistance, temperature, state of charge, historical performance data).
    *   Predictive load modeling: AI/ML algorithm trained on historical data to forecast power demand based on time of day, day of week, known events (e.g., backups, scheduled maintenance).
*   **Prioritization Algorithm:**
    *   Weighted scoring system:
        *   Health Score (derived from health metrics – higher is better).
        *   Age Score (based on time in service – newer is better).
        *   Load Proximity Score (based on predicted load & remaining capacity – higher is better if remaining capacity is low).
        *   Cycle Count (lower is better)
    *   Weighted average of these scores determines the priority of each battery unit.
*   **Predictive Cycling Scheduler:**
    *   Algorithm monitors battery unit scores and predicts the optimal time to initiate a cycling operation (learning/conditioning) *before* the unit reaches a critical performance threshold.
    *   Considers the availability of remaining battery capacity to maintain redundancy during the cycling operation.
    *   The algorithm optimizes cycling frequency based on individual battery health, usage patterns, and predicted load.
*   **Dynamic Load Balancing:**
    *   During a cycling operation, the system dynamically reallocates load to healthy, prioritized battery units.
    *   Load balancing is achieved through intelligent power supply unit control.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Centralized controller with a processor and memory to execute the prioritization and scheduling algorithms.
    *   Communication interface to power supply units to control load balancing and cycling operations.
    *   Data logging and reporting capabilities to track battery health, cycling history, and system performance.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Cycling Scheduler):**

```pseudocode
// Initialize: Load historical data, train predictive load model

Loop:
  For each batteryUnit in batteryUnits:
    healthScore = calculateHealthScore(batteryUnit)
    ageScore = calculateAgeScore(batteryUnit)
    loadProximityScore = calculateLoadProximityScore(batteryUnit, predictedLoad)
    batteryPriority = (weightHealth * healthScore) + (weightAge * ageScore) + (weightLoad * loadProximityScore)

  sortedBatteryUnits = sortBatteryUnitsByPriority(batteryUnits, descending) // Prioritized list

  For each batteryUnit in sortedBatteryUnits:
    If (batteryUnit.cyclesNeeded < threshold) AND (sufficientRedundancyAvailable):
      scheduleCyclingOperation(batteryUnit)
      logCyclingSchedule(batteryUnit)
      break // Move to next cycle
  
  Update predicted load model with current data
```

**Expansion:** Implement a "Battery Swarm" concept – where battery units communicate and share load/health information, further optimizing overall system performance and extending battery lifespan.
