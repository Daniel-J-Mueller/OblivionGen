# 10469324

## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-emptive Security Posture

**Specification:** A system that leverages the virtual network verification service described in patent 10469324 to *predict* likely network topology changes *before* they are implemented, and automatically adjust security policies accordingly. This goes beyond simple verification of an existing state; it proactively anticipates and mitigates risk.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Change Event Listener:** Integrates with provider network orchestration systems (e.g., Terraform, Ansible, Kubernetes) to monitor planned network modifications. These modifications include VM deployments, network interface creations/deletions, security group alterations, and peering connection requests.
2.  **Predictive Topology Engine:** Based on the detected change events, this engine constructs a simulated "future state" of the virtual network. This leverages the declarative logic programming foundation of the original patent, expanding it to incorporate *temporal* logic â€“ the ability to reason about network states over time.
3.  **Constraint-Based Risk Assessment:** Uses the constraint solver to evaluate the predicted future state against pre-defined security policies and risk profiles.  These policies aren't static; they can be dynamically adjusted based on factors like data sensitivity, compliance requirements, and threat intelligence feeds.  The solver isn't just checking for violations; it's quantifying risk levels.
4.  **Automated Policy Adaptation:** Based on the risk assessment, the system automatically generates and applies necessary changes to security policies.  This might involve modifying security group rules, updating network access control lists (ACLs), or triggering automated firewall configurations. The system records *why* each policy change was made for auditability.
5. **Feedback Loop:** Monitors actual network behavior *after* changes are implemented to refine the predictive models and security policies. Any deviations from predicted behavior trigger alerts and potential adjustments to the system.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Event: Network Change Detected (e.g., VM Creation)

ON NetworkChangeEvent(eventData):
  predictedTopology = BuildPredictedTopology(eventData)

  riskAssessmentResults = EvaluateTopology(predictedTopology, securityPolicies)

  IF riskAssessmentResults.riskLevel > threshold:
    policyChanges = GeneratePolicyChanges(riskAssessmentResults)
    ApplyPolicyChanges(policyChanges)
    LogPolicyChanges(policyChanges, eventData)
  ENDIF
ENDON

// Function to BuildPredictedTopology
FUNCTION BuildPredictedTopology(eventData):
    currentTopology = GetCurrentTopology()
    predictedTopology = ApplyChangesToTopology(currentTopology, eventData)
    RETURN predictedTopology
ENDFUNCTION

// Function to EvaluateTopology
FUNCTION EvaluateTopology(topology, policies):
    constraints = GenerateConstraintsFromPolicies(policies)
    results = ConstraintSolver(topology, constraints)
    riskLevel = CalculateRiskLevel(results)
    RETURN riskLevel
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

Existing network verification tools are *reactive*; they verify what *is*. This system is *proactive*; it predicts what *will be* and adjusts security posture accordingly.  The integration of temporal logic and automated policy adaptation based on risk quantification is a significant advancement.  This is about shifting from network security to predictive network resilience.
