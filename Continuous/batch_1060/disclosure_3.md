## Modular Aerial Vehicle Power Distribution & Redundancy System

**Concept:** A distributed power system for aerial vehicles leveraging magnetic resonance coupling and modular, hot-swappable power modules. This moves beyond simple series/parallel redundancy to allow dynamic power allocation and graceful degradation in the event of module failure.

**Specifications:**

*   **Power Modules (PM):**
    *   Form Factor: Standardized brick shape (e.g., 10cm x 5cm x 3cm).
    *   Output Voltage: Variable DC (12V-48V) digitally controlled.
    *   Output Current: Up to 20A per module.
    *   Communication: CAN bus interface for control and status reporting.
    *   Magnetic Resonance Coil: Integrated planar coil for wireless power transfer.
    *   Redundancy: Each module contains internal overcurrent and overvoltage protection.
*   **Vehicle Frame Integration:**
    *   Power Distribution Network (PDN): Frame integrates a network of resonant coils strategically positioned around critical components (motors, flight controller, sensors). These coils act as both receivers and transmitters.
    *   Mounting: PMs connect to the PDN via magnetic locking mechanisms *and* physical alignment guides. No direct electrical connections.
    *   Coil Arrangement: Coils are arranged in a mesh topology, allowing power to be routed from any available PM to any load.
*   **Flight Controller Integration:**
    *   Power Management Software: Software monitors the status of each PM (voltage, current, temperature) and dynamically adjusts power allocation.
    *   Load Balancing Algorithm: Algorithm prioritizes critical loads and distributes power evenly across available PMs.
    *   Fault Tolerance: If a PM fails, the software automatically reroutes power from remaining modules.
    *   Wireless Communication: Flight controller communicates with each PM via CAN bus.
*   **Charging System:**
    *   Docking Station: Vehicle lands on a docking station containing resonant charging coils.
    *   Wireless Charging: Energy is transferred wirelessly from the docking station to the PMs.
    *   Charge Balancing: System balances the charge level of each PM.

**Pseudocode (Flight Controller â€“ Power Allocation):**

```
// Define critical loads (e.g., flight controller, motors)
criticalLoads = [flightController, motor1, motor2, motor3, motor4];

// Define non-critical loads (e.g., sensors, cameras)
nonCriticalLoads = [sensor1, sensor2, camera];

// Function to allocate power to loads
allocatePower() {

  // Get status of all power modules
  moduleStatuses = getModuleStatuses();

  // Calculate total available power
  totalAvailablePower = sum(moduleStatuses.powerOutput);

  // Calculate power requirements for critical loads
  criticalLoadPowerRequired = sum(criticalLoads.powerRequirement);

  // Allocate power to critical loads first
  for (load in criticalLoads) {
    powerToAllocate = min(load.powerRequirement, totalAvailablePower);
    assignPower(load, powerToAllocate);
    totalAvailablePower -= powerToAllocate;
  }

  // Allocate remaining power to non-critical loads
  for (load in nonCriticalLoads) {
    powerToAllocate = min(load.powerRequirement, totalAvailablePower);
    assignPower(load, powerToAllocate);
    totalAvailablePower -= powerToAllocate;
  }
}

// Function to handle module failure
handleModuleFailure(module) {
  // Remove failed module from available modules list
  removeModule(module);

  // Re-allocate power to remaining modules
  allocatePower();
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond the limitations of traditional wired power distribution. Wireless power transfer eliminates bulky wiring harnesses and reduces weight. Modularity allows for easy replacement of failed modules and upgrades to higher-capacity modules. The distributed nature of the system increases redundancy and improves fault tolerance.  The dynamic power allocation algorithm optimizes power usage and extends flight time. The system inherently supports hot swapping of modules, allowing maintenance/upgrades *during* operation (where feasible based on the load).
