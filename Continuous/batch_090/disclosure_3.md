## Dynamic Histogram Granularity with Adaptive Sampling

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on histograms for query optimization. This builds on that by introducing *dynamic* histogram granularity, adjusting the number and width of histogram buckets *during query execution* based on observed data distribution *within the query itself*. Furthermore, rather than relying on full scans or periodic rebalancing, we’ll employ adaptive sampling to refine the histogram *incrementally* as data is processed.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Base Histogram:** A relatively coarse-grained histogram is established *before* query execution. This serves as the initial estimate of data distribution.  Stored as `BaseHistogram = {bucket_start: count, bucket_start: count, ...}`. Bucket size is pre-determined based on table statistics.
*   **Adaptive Histogram:** A secondary, finer-grained histogram maintained *during* query execution. This adapts to the specific data encountered by the query. Stored as `AdaptiveHistogram = {bucket_start: count, bucket_start: count, ...}`. Initialized as empty.
*   **Sampling Rate:** A dynamic value between 0.0 and 1.0, determining the fraction of data rows sampled for histogram refinement. Controlled by a ‘Histogram Manager’ (see component 3).

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Query Start:** The query optimizer utilizes the `BaseHistogram` for initial query plan generation.
2.  **Data Scan:** As data is scanned, a percentage of rows (determined by `Sampling Rate`) is selected.
3.  **Bucket Assignment:** For each sampled row, determine the appropriate bucket in *both* `BaseHistogram` and `AdaptiveHistogram`.
4.  **Histogram Update:** Increment the count for the corresponding bucket in both histograms.
5.  **Adaptive Refinement:**
    *   Periodically (or when a significant bucket count threshold is exceeded), assess the divergence between `BaseHistogram` and `AdaptiveHistogram`.  (Divergence metric: Kullback-Leibler divergence, Chi-squared test).
    *   If divergence exceeds a threshold:
        *   **Bucket Splitting:** Split buckets in `AdaptiveHistogram` where the count difference between `BaseHistogram` and `AdaptiveHistogram` is significant. The split point is determined by the data distribution within that bucket.
        *   **Bucket Merging:** Merge adjacent buckets in `AdaptiveHistogram` with low counts to reduce granularity.
        *   **Sampling Rate Adjustment:** Increase the `Sampling Rate` if the divergence is consistently high. Decrease if it’s consistently low.
6.  **Query Plan Adaptation:** The query optimizer periodically re-evaluates the query plan using the refined `AdaptiveHistogram`. This could involve:
    *   Adjusting join orders.
    *   Selecting different index strategies.
    *   Dynamically partitioning data.

**3. Components:**

*   **Histogram Manager:** A dedicated component responsible for:
    *   Maintaining `AdaptiveHistogram` and `Sampling Rate`.
    *   Calculating divergence between histograms.
    *   Triggering bucket splitting/merging.
    *   Communicating with the query optimizer.
*   **Query Optimizer:** Modified to:
    *   Accept `AdaptiveHistogram` as input.
    *   Dynamically re-evaluate query plans based on updated histogram.
*   **Data Scanner:** Responsible for sampling data rows and passing them to the Histogram Manager.

**Pseudocode (Histogram Manager - Adaptive Refinement):**

```pseudocode
function refineHistogram(sampledRow, baseHistogram, adaptiveHistogram, samplingRate):
  # Update Adaptive Histogram
  bucket = findBucket(sampledRow, adaptiveHistogram)
  adaptiveHistogram[bucket].count++

  # Calculate divergence between histograms
  divergence = calculateDivergence(baseHistogram, adaptiveHistogram)

  # Check if divergence exceeds threshold
  if divergence > divergenceThreshold:
    # Split buckets in Adaptive Histogram
    splitBuckets(adaptiveHistogram)

    # Adjust sampling rate
    if divergence is consistently high:
      samplingRate = min(1.0, samplingRate * 1.1) # Increase
    else:
      samplingRate = max(0.0, samplingRate * 0.9) # Decrease

  return adaptiveHistogram
```

**Novelty:**

This differs from the source patent by *dynamically* adjusting histogram granularity *during* query execution, driven by observed data distributions *within* the query itself.  The adaptive sampling provides a lower-overhead approach than periodic rebalancing, and allows the system to respond to skew or changes in data distribution in real-time, leading to more accurate query plans and improved performance. It’s not just about *having* a histogram, but *continuously refining* it based on what the query is actually seeing.
