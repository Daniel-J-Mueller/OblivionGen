**Adaptive Sensor Fusion with Environmental Mapping**

**Concept:** Extend inertial sensor fusion not just for orientation correction, but to build a dynamic environmental map. The existing patent focuses on correcting orientation relative to an Earth frame. This builds upon that by leveraging corrected orientation *and* sensor data to create a local, constantly updating 3D map of the immediate surroundings.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Existing: 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer
    *   Added: Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor (short-range depth perception – 0.1m-5m), low-resolution wide-angle camera (for texture mapping)
*   **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Core Orientation:** Utilize the patent's inertial sensor fusion method to determine highly accurate device orientation. This forms the base for all other processing.
    2.  **Depth Mapping:** The ToF sensor generates a depth image. This image is inherently noisy and requires filtering. A Kalman filter, seeded with the inertial orientation data, will significantly improve depth accuracy by predicting sensor motion and compensating for jitter.
    3.  **Point Cloud Generation:** The filtered depth data is transformed into a 3D point cloud, referenced to the corrected device orientation.
    4.  **SLAM Integration:** A simplified Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm will be used to refine the point cloud, reduce drift, and close loops. This will not focus on long-term global mapping, but on maintaining a consistent local map within a 10-20 meter radius.
    5.  **Semantic Layer (Optional):** Image data from the low-resolution camera, combined with basic computer vision algorithms, can add a semantic layer to the map. This allows the system to identify basic object types (e.g., “wall”, “floor”, “table”).
    6.  **Dynamic Updates:** The entire process is performed at a high frequency (20-30 Hz) and constantly updates the environmental map.

*   **Pseudocode (Map Update Cycle):**

```
Loop:
    // 1. Get Raw Sensor Data
    gyro_data = read_gyroscope()
    accel_data = read_accelerometer()
    tof_data = read_tof_sensor()

    // 2. Correct Orientation (using existing patent algorithm)
    corrected_orientation = apply_inertial_fusion(gyro_data, accel_data, previous_orientation)

    // 3. Transform ToF data to world coordinates
    world_points = transform_tof_data(tof_data, corrected_orientation)

    // 4. SLAM Refinement:
    refined_points = apply_slam_algorithm(world_points, previous_map)

    // 5. Update Map:
    current_map = refined_points

    // 6. Store previous map/orientation for next cycle
    previous_map = current_map
    previous_orientation = corrected_orientation
End Loop
```

*   **Output:** A constantly updated 3D point cloud representing the device's surroundings, referenced to a corrected Earth frame.  Data can be output as a stream of points or a mesh for visualization.

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Augmented Reality (AR) stabilization and scene understanding.
    *   Robotics – environmental awareness for navigation and object manipulation.
    *   Indoor mapping and localization.
    *   Gesture recognition – tracking hand movements in 3D space.
    *   Accessibility aids – creating a 3D representation of the environment for visually impaired users.
