## Dynamic Honeypot Infrastructure via Client-Specific Addressing

**Concept:** Extend the client-specific addressing scheme to create a dynamic, personalized honeypot infrastructure. Instead of *just* identifying attack sources, actively lure them into increasingly isolated and monitored environments tailored to their apparent attack patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Name Resolution Server (NRS):** (Existing – enhanced) – Responsible for distributing unique addressing combinations *and* honeypot ‘levels’ to clients.
*   **Honeypot Management System (HMS):** New – Manages the creation, configuration, and monitoring of honeypots. Maintains a database linking client identifiers to current honeypot levels.
*   **Traffic Redirection Engine (TRE):** New – Responsible for intercepting and redirecting traffic destined for specific addressing combinations (honeypot addresses) to the corresponding HMS-managed honeypot.
*   **Client Identifier Database:** Stores mappings of client identifiers to current addressing combinations & honeypot levels.

**2. Honeypot Levels:**

*   **Level 0 (Default):** Standard content delivery – as currently described in the patent.
*   **Level 1 (Initial Honeypot):** Clients receive addresses pointing to basic, monitored servers – logging all activity. Increased latency is subtly introduced.
*   **Level 2 (Advanced Honeypot):** Addresses point to increasingly realistic but contained environments.  Simulated services and data are presented.  Activity is closely monitored for exploitation attempts.
*   **Level 3 (Containment):** Addresses redirect to fully isolated virtual machines or containerized environments.  Detailed sandboxing and analysis of malicious code are performed.  All outbound traffic is blocked or heavily scrutinized.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Request:** Client requests resolution of content identifier.
2.  **NRS Resolution:** NRS determines client identifier and assigns a unique addressing combination and initial honeypot level (Level 0).
3.  **Traffic Monitoring:** TRE monitors traffic directed to the assigned addressing combination.
4.  **Anomaly Detection:** TRE detects anomalous activity (e.g., port scanning, brute-force attempts).
5.  **Honeypot Escalation:** Based on anomaly severity, TRE triggers HMS to escalate the client to the next honeypot level. HMS updates the client identifier database with the new addressing combination.
6.  **Traffic Redirection:** TRE redirects traffic to the appropriate honeypot environment (managed by HMS).
7.  **Analysis & Reporting:** HMS analyzes activity within the honeypot, generates reports, and updates threat intelligence feeds.

**4. Pseudocode (TRE – Traffic Redirection Logic):**

```
function redirectTraffic(destinationAddress, destinationPort, packet):
  clientIdentifier = lookupClientIdentifier(destinationAddress)
  if clientIdentifier is null:
    forwardPacketToNormalContentDelivery(packet) // Unidentified client
  else:
    honeypotLevel = getHoneypotLevel(clientIdentifier)
    if honeypotLevel == 0:
      forwardPacketToNormalContentDelivery(packet)
    elif honeypotLevel == 1:
      forwardPacketToHoneypotServer(packet, honeypotLevel1Address, honeypotLevel1Port)
    elif honeypotLevel == 2:
      forwardPacketToHoneypotServer(packet, honeypotLevel2Address, honeypotLevel2Port)
    elif honeypotLevel == 3:
      forwardPacketToHoneypotServer(packet, honeypotLevel3Address, honeypotLevel3Port)
    else:
      forwardPacketToNormalContentDelivery(packet) // Default
```

**5. Enhancement:**

*   **Dynamic Honeypot Content:** The content presented within each honeypot should adapt based on observed client behavior.
*   **Automated Malware Analysis:** Integrate automated malware analysis tools within the Level 3 honeypots to extract and classify malicious code.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Share threat intelligence gathered from honeypots with external security services.
* **False Positive Mitigation**: Implement a robust false positive detection system to prevent legitimate users from being inadvertently trapped in honeypots.
