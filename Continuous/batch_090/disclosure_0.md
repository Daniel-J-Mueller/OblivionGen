## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predictive Load

**Concept:** Extend the load balancing system with a predictive component that anticipates resource needs *before* requests arrive, proactively allocating resources and pre-warming instances. This shifts from reactive to proactive scaling, reducing latency and improving responsiveness.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Resource Allocator (PRA) - operates alongside the existing load balancer.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical request data (timestamp, source, parameters, processing time).
    *   Real-time request stream (current requests and their attributes).
    *   External event feeds (e.g., marketing campaign launch times, scheduled maintenance windows).
*   **Prediction Model:** Time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM neural networks) trained on historical data. Model outputs predicted request volume and resource requirements (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) for each source/parameter combination.  Multiple models per source are considered.
*   **Allocation Strategy:**
    *   PRA calculates predicted resource needs for a defined time window (e.g., 5, 15, 30 minutes).
    *   PRA communicates with an Instance Manager (IM) to request pre-warming of computing devices. IM provisions or activates instances based on predicted needs.
    *   The Load Balancer is modified to prioritize requests directed to pre-warmed instances.
    *   A feedback loop monitors actual resource usage versus predictions and adjusts the forecasting models accordingly.
*   **Parameter Integration:** PRA leverages the existing 'parameter' extraction functionality to identify traffic patterns and build source-specific prediction models.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  PRA continuously re-evaluates predictions and adjusts resource allocation in real-time based on observed traffic patterns.

**Pseudocode (PRA core logic):**

```
function predict_resource_needs(source_parameter):
  historical_data = retrieve_historical_data(source_parameter)
  predicted_volume = time_series_forecast(historical_data)  // Using ARIMA/Prophet/LSTM
  resource_requirements = calculate_resource_needs(predicted_volume) // Based on historical processing times
  return resource_requirements

function allocate_resources(source_parameter):
  resource_requirements = predict_resource_needs(source_parameter)
  if resource_requirements > current_capacity(source_parameter):
    request_instances(resource_requirements - current_capacity(source_parameter))
  prioritize_pre_warmed_instances(source_parameter)

function monitor_and_adjust():
  actual_usage = retrieve_current_usage()
  prediction_error = calculate_error(actual_usage, predicted_usage)
  if prediction_error > threshold:
    retrain_model(historical_data, actual_usage)

loop:
  for each source_parameter:
    allocate_resources(source_parameter)
  monitor_and_adjust()
  sleep(interval)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   PRA can be implemented as a separate microservice.
*   Requires a scalable time-series database for storing historical data.
*   Utilizes machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) for model training and prediction.
*   Requires integration with the Instance Manager to automate instance provisioning.
