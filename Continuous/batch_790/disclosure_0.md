## Dynamic Persona-Based Multivariate Testing

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple A/B or multivariate testing by incorporating dynamic user personas derived from real-time behavioral data, and then dynamically adjusting test parameters *during* a user session.  The existing patent focuses on attributing actions *after* the fact. This system aims to proactively tailor the experience *while* the user is interacting with the content, creating hyper-personalized experiences and significantly accelerating the learning process of effective content variations.

**Specs:**

1.  **Persona Engine:**
    *   Input: Real-time user behavior (clicks, dwell time, scroll depth, purchase history, referral source, device type, time of day, location – anonymized where necessary).
    *   Process: Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., clustering, collaborative filtering) to dynamically assign users to evolving personas. Persona definitions are not static; they shift based on aggregate behavioral patterns.
    *   Output: Persona ID (a numerical identifier representing the current user persona).

2.  **Test Parameter Database:**
    *   Structure: A database linking multivariate test parameters (ad placement, image size, border style, ad copy, content themes, call-to-action buttons, color palettes) to specific persona IDs.  This allows for pre-defined variations catered to different personas.  The database supports dynamic parameter weighting – allowing some parameters to have a greater influence on variations for specific personas.

3.  **Real-Time Variation Engine:**
    *   Input: Persona ID (from Persona Engine), User Request (page load, click event), Current Test Parameters.
    *   Process:
        *   Based on the Persona ID, retrieve the relevant set of test parameters and associated variations from the Test Parameter Database.
        *   Randomly select a variation within the retrieved set, or employ a more sophisticated algorithm (e.g., contextual bandit) to select the variation predicted to yield the best outcome based on historical data for that persona.
        *   Dynamically render the web page content with the selected variation.
    *   Output: Rendered web page content.

4.  **Session-Level Adaptation:**
    *   Process: Monitor user behavior *within* the current session. If a user's behavior deviates significantly from the typical pattern for their assigned persona (e.g., they click on elements typically ignored by that persona), the system should subtly adjust the test parameters in real-time, moving them towards a different variation or even re-evaluating their persona assignment.  This is a 'soft' adjustment, prioritizing subtle shifts over abrupt changes.

5.  **Attribution and Reporting:**
    *   Data Collection: Track all user actions (clicks, views, purchases, time on page) along with the corresponding test parameters that were active during that action.
    *   Statistical Analysis:  Perform statistical analysis to identify which test parameters are most effective for each persona.
    *   Reporting Dashboard:  Provide a dashboard that visualizes the performance of different test parameters for each persona, allowing marketers to optimize their content accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Real-Time Variation Engine):**

```
function get_variation(persona_id, user_request):
  # Retrieve relevant test parameters from database
  test_parameters = database.get_parameters(persona_id)

  # Select a variation (using random selection or a more advanced algorithm)
  variation = select_variation(test_parameters)

  # Apply the variation to the user request
  rendered_content = apply_variation(user_request, variation)

  return rendered_content
```

**Novelty:**  The core difference from the provided patent is the shift from *post-hoc* attribution to *proactive* personalization. This system doesn't just determine which variations were most effective *after* the user has interacted with the content; it *actively* tailors the experience *while* the user is interacting with it.  The dynamic persona assignment and session-level adaptation further enhance the personalization and learning process. It is also possible to add 'meta' tests, so the test parameters could, themselves, be varied depending on the persona.
