## Adaptive Request Shaping with Predictive Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Extend the core authentication delegation concept to proactively shape requests *before* they reach services, based on predicted policy violations. This introduces a layer of intelligent request modification, reducing service load from invalid requests and improving overall system responsiveness.

**Specs:**

**1. Request Interception Module (RIM):**

*   **Function:** Resides between the initial request originator and the authentication system. It intercepts all requests.
*   **Data Inputs:** Raw request data, originator identity, historical request patterns (from a Request History Database).
*   **Data Outputs:** Modified request data (if applicable), unmodified request data, 'policy violation probability score'.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Receive request.
    2.  Extract relevant parameters for policy evaluation.
    3.  Query Request History Database for similar requests from the same originator/identity.
    4.  Based on historical data and current request parameters, calculate a 'policy violation probability score' using a machine learning model (trained on past policy enforcement data).
    5.  If the score exceeds a configurable threshold:
        *   Modify the request to align with anticipated policy requirements. (See Request Modification Logic below)
        *   Flag the request as 'modified' for auditing and monitoring.
    6.  Transmit the (potentially) modified request to the Authentication System.

**2. Request Modification Logic (RML):**

*   **Function:**  Determines how to modify requests to avoid policy violations.
*   **Data Inputs:** Raw request data, policy information (obtained from the Authentication System response – as in the original patent), policy violation prediction (from RIM), configurable modification rules.
*   **Modification Rules (examples):**
    *   **Data Masking:** Replace sensitive data with placeholder values.
    *   **Parameter Limiting:** Reduce the size or scope of a request parameter.
    *   **Feature Removal:** Remove unnecessary or potentially violating request features.
    *   **Operation Substitution:** Replace a potentially violating operation with a compliant alternative.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Analyze the raw request data and the predicted policy violation.
    2.  Select the most appropriate modification rule based on the violation type and the available options.
    3.  Apply the rule to the request data, creating a modified request.
    4.  Record the modifications made for auditing and monitoring.

**3. Policy Learning Engine (PLE):**

*   **Function:**  Continuously improves the accuracy of policy violation predictions.
*   **Data Inputs:** Historical request data, policy enforcement results (from service logs), modification records (from RIM), feedback from service operators.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Collect data from various sources.
    2.  Train a machine learning model to predict policy violations.
    3.  Evaluate the model's performance.
    4.  Retrain the model with new data.
    5.  Deploy the updated model to the RIM.

**4.  Authentication System Modifications:**

*   Extend the authentication response to include a 'modification capability flag' indicating whether the RIM is authorized to modify requests on behalf of the originator.
*   Log all RIM modifications for auditing and policy enforcement monitoring.

**Pseudocode (RIM – simplified):**

```
function interceptRequest(request, originator):
    score = predictPolicyViolation(request, originator)
    if score > threshold and originator.hasPermission("modifyRequests"):
        modifiedRequest = applyModificationLogic(request)
        logModification(request, modifiedRequest)
        return modifiedRequest
    else:
        return request
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Policy Enforcement:** Shifts from reactive policy enforcement (at the service level) to proactive modification *before* requests reach the service.
*   **Adaptive Request Shaping:** Dynamically adjusts requests based on predicted policy violations and historical data.
*   **Reduced Service Load:**  Minimizes the number of invalid requests that reach services, improving overall system performance.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Prevents potentially malicious requests from reaching sensitive services.
