## Dynamic Lenticular Projection Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the lenticular image concept from a display *surface* to a dynamic projection onto arbitrary 3D surfaces. Instead of viewing a pre-rendered lenticular image, the system dynamically projects multiple views onto a physical object or environment, creating a true 3D lenticular effect.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multiple (minimum 3, optimal 8+) high-resolution, short-throw projectors.
    *   High-precision 3D scanner (LiDAR, structured light, etc.) for real-time surface capture.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and/or external tracking system (e.g., Vicon) to determine viewer/device orientation.
    *   High-performance processing unit (GPU-accelerated) for rendering and projection management.
*   **Software:**
    *   **3D Scene Reconstruction Module:** Processes scanner data to create a dynamic 3D model of the target surface.
    *   **View Generation Module:**  Calculates and renders multiple views of a 3D scene or content, tailored to the reconstructed surface geometry.  Uses a view frustum culling algorithm for performance.
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:**  Distributes and warps the generated views onto the projectors, accounting for projector geometry, surface curvature, and viewer position.
    *   **Real-time Calibration & Tracking Module:** Continuously calibrates the projectors and tracks viewer/device orientation using the IMU and/or external tracking system.  Employs a Kalman filter for smoothing and prediction.
    *   **Content Creation Tools:** A simplified authoring environment for creating and importing 3D content optimized for dynamic lenticular projection.  Supports standard 3D formats (OBJ, FBX, glTF).

**Pseudocode (Projection Mapping Engine):**

```
function ProjectViews(views[], projector_config[], surface_mesh, viewer_pose) {

  for each view in views {
    view_matrix = CalculateViewMatrix(view.position, view.orientation);
    projection_matrix = CalculateProjectionMatrix(view.fov, view.aspect_ratio, view.near_plane, view.far_plane);

    // Transform view frustum to world space
    world_frustum = TransformFrustum(view_frustum, view_matrix);

    // Raycast into scene to find intersection points on the surface
    intersection_points = Raycast(world_frustum, surface_mesh);

    // Calculate texture coordinates for each intersection point
    texture_coords = CalculateTextureCoordinates(intersection_points, surface_mesh);

    // Warp the view to match the surface curvature
    warped_view = WarpView(view, texture_coords);

    // Send the warped view to the corresponding projector
    SendToProjector(warped_view, projector_config);
  }
}
```

**Innovation Details:**

This system moves beyond static lenticular displays. The real-time 3D scanning and projection mapping create a true volumetric display effect, adapting the image to the shape of the object being displayed.  Imagine projecting a "holographic" UI onto a car dashboard that wraps around the contours, or displaying a dynamic architectural model that appears to float in the air.  The dynamic nature allows for interactive experiences where the user's viewpoint controls the displayed image.  The system could also be used for large-scale installations, creating immersive environments that respond to user movement.
