**Personalized Recommendation 'Echo' System**

**Core Concept:** Extend the feedback loop beyond explicit/implicit ratings to *proactive* preference elicitation through generative ‘echo’ recommendations. Instead of *reacting* to feedback, the system anticipates user preferences by creating slight variations of previously accepted recommendations.

**Specs:**

1.  **Recommendation Echo Generator:**
    *   Input: A list of positively-rated items (explicitly or implicitly) and associated recommendation rules.
    *   Process:
        *   For each positively-rated item:
            *   Identify the dominant recommendation rules used to generate that item's recommendation.
            *   Slightly perturb those rules (e.g., modify a keyword weight in a content-based filter, broaden a demographic segment in a collaborative filter).
            *   Generate a new set of item recommendations based on the perturbed rules. These are 'Echo Recommendations'.
    *   Output: A list of Echo Recommendations for each positively-rated item, paired with the degree of rule perturbation.

2.  **Echo Presentation Module:**
    *   Interface: Integrated into the existing recommendation interface (e.g., “You liked X, here are some *similar* takes on that suggestion…”).
    *   Presentation: Display Echo Recommendations alongside standard recommendations.
    *   Feedback Capture: Track user interactions with Echo Recommendations (clicks, purchases, ratings).

3.  **Dynamic Perturbation Algorithm:**
    *   Input: User interaction data with Echo Recommendations.
    *   Process:
        *   Analyze the success/failure of different perturbation strategies.
        *   Adjust the perturbation algorithm to favor strategies that lead to positive user engagement. (e.g., if broadening a demographic segment consistently fails, reduce the magnitude of that perturbation).
        *   Implement an ‘exploration vs. exploitation’ strategy: occasionally introduce more radical perturbations to discover new preference areas.

4.  **Preference Drift Detection:**
    *   Monitor the distribution of accepted/rejected Echo Recommendations over time.
    *   Detect shifts in preference by identifying statistically significant changes in acceptance rates.
    *   Automatically adjust the user profile to reflect these preference drifts.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Perturbation Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION updatePerturbationStrategy(user, interactionData):
  // interactionData contains clicks, purchases, ratings for Echo Recommendations
  
  FOR each perturbationType in [keywordWeightAdjustment, demographicSegmentBroadening, contentSimilarityThreshold]:
    successRate = calculateSuccessRate(interactionData, perturbationType)
    
    IF successRate > currentSuccessRate(perturbationType):
      increaseWeight(perturbationType) // Favor this strategy in future
    ELSE IF successRate < currentSuccessRate(perturbationType):
      decreaseWeight(perturbationType) // Discourage this strategy
    
  //Implement exploration:  Randomly apply a high-magnitude perturbation with a low probability
  IF random() < explorationProbability:
    applyRandomPerturbation()

  RETURN updatedPerturbationWeights
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `User Profile`: Contains list of positively-rated items, associated recommendation rules, and perturbation weights.
*   `Recommendation Rule`: Contains parameters defining the rule (keywords, demographic segments, content similarity thresholds, etc.)
*   `Perturbation Weights`: A vector representing the relative preference for different perturbation strategies.
