## Adaptive I/O Shadowing & Predictive Rewind

**Concept:** Extend the log-structured storage recovery concept by creating *proactive* I/O shadows, combined with a predictive rewind capability leveraging AI/ML to anticipate potential ransomware behavior and pre-stage recovery points.

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

*   **I/O Interceptor:**  A kernel-level driver or virtualized component residing between the compute instance and storage. This component intercepts all I/O requests.
*   **Shadow Writer:** A dedicated process responsible for asynchronously writing a ‘shadow’ copy of I/O data to a secondary storage location (could be object storage, another volume, or a tier of existing storage).  Data is written with minimal latency overhead.
*   **AI/ML Behavior Analyzer:** A cloud-based service that analyzes I/O patterns from the I/O Interceptor, looking for anomalous behavior indicative of early-stage ransomware activity.
*   **Predictive Rewind Engine:**  A service that manages the creation and maintenance of ‘predictive recovery points’ – snapshots of the storage volume based on the AI/ML behavior analysis.
*   **Storage Controller Integration:** Enhanced storage controller capabilities to efficiently manage and access the shadow data and predictive recovery points.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Normal Operation:** All I/O requests are intercepted by the I/O Interceptor. The Interceptor passes the request to the storage, and *simultaneously* forwards a copy of the I/O data to the Shadow Writer. The Shadow Writer asynchronously writes the data to shadow storage.
2.  **Behavior Analysis:** The I/O Interceptor continuously sends I/O metadata (timestamp, block address, read/write size, process ID, etc.) to the AI/ML Behavior Analyzer.
3.  **Anomaly Detection:** The AI/ML Behavior Analyzer utilizes a trained model to identify unusual I/O patterns. Examples:
    *   Rapid, sequential writes to many files.
    *   High I/O activity from a previously idle process.
    *   File extension changes (e.g., document files being renamed with encryption extensions).
4.  **Predictive Recovery Point Creation:** When the AI/ML Behavior Analyzer detects a potentially malicious pattern *before* encryption is widespread, the Predictive Rewind Engine triggers the creation of a ‘predictive recovery point’. This recovery point is a consistent snapshot of the storage volume, capturing the state *before* the potentially malicious I/O operations cause significant damage.
5.  **Automated Remediation:** Upon confirmation of a ransomware attack (e.g., through signature-based detection or human confirmation), the system automatically initiates a rewind operation, restoring the storage volume to the most recent predictive recovery point.  The shadow data may be used to replay transactions that occurred since the last recovery point, minimizing data loss.
6. **Adaptive Shadowing:** The system dynamically adjusts the frequency and granularity of shadow data collection based on the perceived risk level. In high-risk situations, shadowing becomes more aggressive (e.g., mirroring entire blocks), while in normal operation, it can be reduced to incremental changes.

**III. Pseudocode (Predictive Rewind Engine):**

```
function createPredictiveRecoveryPoint(volumeID, timestamp, reason) {
  // Initiate a consistent snapshot of the volume
  snapshotID = createSnapshot(volumeID)

  // Store metadata about the snapshot
  storeSnapshotMetadata(snapshotID, volumeID, timestamp, reason)

  // Trigger shadow data replication (if applicable)
  replicateShadowData(volumeID, snapshotID)
}

function evaluateRiskLevel(volumeID) {
  // Query AI/ML Behavior Analyzer for risk score
  riskScore = queryBehaviorAnalyzer(volumeID)

  // Map risk score to risk level (Low, Medium, High)
  riskLevel = mapRiskScoreToLevel(riskScore)

  return riskLevel
}

function adjustShadowingFrequency(volumeID, riskLevel) {
  // Based on risk level, adjust frequency of shadow data collection
  // (e.g., Low: incremental changes only, Medium: full block mirroring every hour, High: real-time mirroring)
  shadowingFrequency = determineShadowingFrequency(riskLevel)
  updateShadowingConfiguration(volumeID, shadowingFrequency)
}

//Example:
//if (riskLevel == "High"){
//  shadowingFrequency = "realtime"
//}
```

**IV. Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance storage controllers capable of handling increased I/O load from shadow data replication.
*   Sufficient storage capacity to accommodate shadow data.
*   Network bandwidth to support data transfer between compute instances and shadow storage.

**V. Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced downtime and data loss from ransomware attacks.
*   Proactive recovery capabilities.
*   Adaptive security posture based on real-time threat assessment.
*   Minimized impact on application performance.
