## Dynamic Mood-Based Content Stitching

**Concept:** Expand the context-awareness beyond genre and user history to incorporate real-time emotional analysis (via device camera/microphone) and dynamically stitch together content segments from multiple sources to match the user’s current mood.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Mood Engine:**
    *   Input: Real-time video/audio feed (optional user opt-in).
    *   Processing: Employs facial expression recognition, voice tone analysis, and potentially physiological data (if available via wearable integration).
    *   Output:  Mood classification (e.g., Happy, Sad, Angry, Relaxed, Neutral) with a confidence score.
*   **Content Segment Database:**
    *   Structure: Organized by genre *and* emotional tone/valence. Segments are short-form – 5-30 second clips.
    *   Sources: Licensed stock footage, user-generated content (with permissions), clips extracted from longer-form content.  Metadata tagging is critical for accurate emotional classification.
*   **Stitching Engine:**
    *   Input: Current mood classification, user context (genre preferences, viewing history), available content segments.
    *   Logic:  Selects and seamlessly stitches together content segments that match the user’s mood *and* align with their preferred genre. Prioritizes segments with higher mood confidence scores.
    *   Output:  A dynamically generated content stream.

**2.  Workflow:**

1.  **Mood Detection:** The Mood Engine analyzes the user’s facial expressions/voice tone (optional).
2.  **Contextualization:** The system combines the detected mood with the user’s profile (genre preferences, viewing history, time of day, etc.).
3.  **Segment Selection:** The Stitching Engine queries the Content Segment Database for segments that match the mood and context. A scoring system ranks segments based on relevance and quality.
4.  **Dynamic Stitching:** The selected segments are seamlessly stitched together, creating a dynamic content stream.  Transitions are optimized for a smooth viewing experience.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** User interactions (skips, likes, shares) are used to refine the mood classification and segment selection algorithms.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (user is watching) {
  mood = MoodEngine.detectMood();
  preferredGenre = UserProfile.getPreferredGenre();

  segments = ContentSegmentDatabase.getSegments(mood, preferredGenre);

  // Sort segments by relevance (mood match, quality score)
  segments.sort(relevanceComparator);

  // Select top N segments (e.g., 5-10)
  selectedSegments = segments.subList(0, N);

  // Stitch segments together with smooth transitions
  stream = StitchingEngine.createStream(selectedSegments);

  stream.play();

  // Monitor user interaction (skips, likes)
  interaction = UserInterface.getUserInteraction();

  // Update mood model and segment rankings based on interaction
  MoodModel.update(interaction);
  SegmentRanker.update(interaction);
}
```

**4.  Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Device with camera/microphone (optional)
*   Cloud-based mood analysis engine
*   Scalable content segment database
*   Real-time video/audio processing capabilities
*   AI/ML algorithms for mood detection and content recommendation
*   Seamless video stitching library

**5. Future Enhancements:**

*   Integration with wearable devices for physiological data analysis
*   Personalized mood profiles based on user history
*   AI-powered content generation to create custom segments
*   Adaptive difficulty for segments based on user engagement
*   Support for multi-user mood synchronization (e.g., for group viewing)
