## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Notification

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply routing notifications to the ‘best’ device within an acoustic region. Utilize multi-device audio analysis to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene, identify ongoing activities, and *predict* future notification relevance – tailoring not just *where* a notification goes, but *when* and *how*.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing device microphone arrays (smartphones, smart speakers, laptops).
*   Edge computing capability on each device. (Neural processing unit preferable).
*   Central server for model training & management.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Analyzer (ASA):** Runs on each device. Processes audio input, identifying sound events (speech, music, alarms, environmental sounds) and estimating their spatial locations. Outputs a probabilistic map of the acoustic scene.
*   **Activity Recognition Module (ARM):** Uses ASA output to infer ongoing activities. (e.g., “user is cooking,” “user is in a meeting,” “user is watching TV”). Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanism to track activity over time.
*   **Notification Prediction Engine (NPE):**  A centralized service. Receives activity data from ARM on each device. Utilizes a long short-term memory (LSTM) network trained on user notification history and contextual data (calendar events, location, time of day) to predict the probability of a future notification being relevant to the user.  It also assesses ‘notification fatigue’ – if a user repeatedly dismisses notifications related to a specific activity, the probability is reduced.
*   **Adaptive Routing Algorithm:**  Combines activity prediction, device capabilities (screen size, audio output, proximity) and user preferences to determine the optimal device for notification delivery.

**3. Data Flow & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Device-side (ASA & ARM)
loop:
    audio_data = capture_audio()
    acoustic_scene = ASA(audio_data)  // Probabilistic map of sounds
    activity = ARM(acoustic_scene)  // Infer ongoing activity
    send(activity, user_id)          // Send to NPE

// Server-side (NPE)
on receive(activity, user_id):
    user_profile = get_profile(user_id)
    prediction = LSTM(activity, user_profile) // Predict notification relevance
    if prediction > threshold:
        notification = get_next_notification(user_id)
        best_device = AdaptiveRouting(notification, prediction, device_list)
        send_notification(notification, best_device)
```

**4. Novelty & Expansion:**

*   **Beyond Selection:** Existing systems *select* a device. This *anticipates* need, tailoring notifications proactively.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Moves beyond simple ‘signal strength’ to understand *what* the user is doing.
*   **Dynamic Learning:**  Learns user preferences in real-time, adapting notification delivery.
*   **Multi-Modal Extension:** Incorporate camera data to confirm activity (e.g., recognizing cooking ingredients, identifying meeting participants).

**5. Potential Applications:**

*   Smart home automation (e.g., pre-heating oven when user starts cooking).
*   Context-aware productivity tools (e.g., silencing notifications during meetings).
*   Personalized entertainment recommendations.
*   Emergency alerts tailored to user location and activity.
