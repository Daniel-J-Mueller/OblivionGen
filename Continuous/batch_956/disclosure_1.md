## Dynamic Content Stitching with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand on the tile-based rendering and tree structure by introducing predictive prefetching based on user interaction *and* anticipated navigation. The system should proactively render tiles not immediately visible, but likely to be needed soon, and "stitch" them together seamlessly as the user interacts.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Interaction Graph:** Maintain a probabilistic interaction graph for each user (or user segment). This graph maps current page/tile views to likely next actions – scrolling direction/speed, likely links to click, expected zoom/pan actions. This can be derived from historical data, real-time user behavior, and potentially, inferred intent.

2.  **Prefetch Queue:** A priority queue manages prefetch requests. Requests are generated based on the interaction graph and assigned a priority score.  Factors influencing the score:
    *   Probability of needing the tile (from interaction graph)
    *   Rendering cost (complexity of the tile)
    *   Network latency (estimated based on user location and server load)
    *   Available bandwidth

3.  **Tile Granularity & Chunking:** Tiles are not fixed size. The system dynamically adjusts tile size based on content complexity and rendering cost. Complex tiles are broken down into smaller chunks for parallel rendering and smoother stitching.  Chunks should be designed with seamless blending in mind (e.g., using alpha blending or gradient masks).

4.  **Stitching Engine:**  A dedicated stitching engine merges pre-rendered chunks/tiles into a cohesive display. This engine:
    *   Handles transitions between pre-rendered and on-demand rendered content.
    *   Applies visual effects (e.g., cross-fades, zooms, pans) to create smooth transitions.
    *   Prioritizes the display of pre-rendered content whenever possible.

5.  **Resource Management:**  A resource manager dynamically allocates rendering resources (CPU, GPU, memory) to the prefetching and stitching processes. It prioritizes prefetching based on user interaction and available resources.

6.  **Client-Side Integration:** The client application provides data about user interactions (scrolling, clicks, zoom) to the server.  It also receives pre-rendered tiles/chunks from the server and integrates them into the display.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side – Prefetching Loop):**

```
// Main Prefetching Loop
while (true) {
  for each user in active_users {
    interaction_data = get_user_interaction_data(user)
    predicted_actions = predict_next_actions(interaction_data)

    for each action in predicted_actions {
      required_tiles = get_tiles_for_action(action)

      for each tile in required_tiles {
        if (tile not in prefetch_queue and tile not in rendered_tiles) {
          priority = calculate_prefetch_priority(tile, user)
          add_to_prefetch_queue(tile, priority)
        }
      }
    }

    // Process Prefetch Queue (Highest Priority First)
    while (prefetch_queue not empty and resources available) {
      tile = get_highest_priority_tile()
      render_tile(tile)
      store_rendered_tile(tile)
      remove_from_prefetch_queue(tile)
    }
  }
}
```

**Client-Side Integration:**

*   Client application sends viewport coordinates, scroll direction/speed, zoom level, and click events to the server.
*   Server responds with pre-rendered tiles/chunks as needed.
*   Client stitches together pre-rendered content with on-demand rendered content using the stitching engine.
*   Client provides feedback to the server about rendering performance and user interaction.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved responsiveness
*   Smoother user experience
*   Lower bandwidth consumption
*   Improved scalability.
