## Dynamic Attribute Importance Weighting System

**Concept:** Expand the system's attribute analysis beyond static weightings to incorporate real-time user engagement data. This allows the system to learn which attributes are *most* important to users *in context* and dynamically adjust its analysis accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:**
    *   Image and Item Description (as in existing system).
    *   User Interaction Data: Clicks, dwell time on specific attributes in the item description, "helpful" flags on suggested revisions, purchase data linked to images/descriptions, explicit user ratings of attribute relevance.
*   **Attribute Relevance Model:**
    *   A separate neural network (Attribute Relevance Network - ARN) trained on user interaction data.
    *   ARN Inputs: Image features (extracted as in the base system), item description text embeddings, user ID (for personalized relevance), session data (time of day, location - optional).
    *   ARN Outputs: A dynamic weight vector for each attribute. Higher weights indicate greater relevance to the user (or a cohort of users).
*   **Integration with Base System:**
    *   Before attribute comparison (Claim 1), the base system queries the ARN for the current weight vector.
    *   The weight vector is applied to the attribute comparison score. Attributes with higher weights contribute more to the discrepancy calculation.
    *   The ARN is continuously updated with new user interaction data.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Suggested revisions (Claim 9) are tracked. If a user accepts a revision, the weights for the added attribute are increased. If a user declines, weights are decreased.
    *   Purchase data provides a strong signal. If a user purchases an item after a suggested revision, the weights associated with the revision's attributes are significantly boosted.
*   **Implementation Detail (Pseudocode - Weight Application):**

```
// Existing attribute comparison returns a 'discrepancy score'
function calculateDiscrepancyScore(existingAttributes, identifiedAttributes, attributeWeights) {
  let totalScore = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < identifiedAttributes.length; i++) {
    let attribute = identifiedAttributes[i];
    if (!existingAttributes.includes(attribute)) {
      totalScore += attributeWeights[attribute]; // Apply weight
    }
  }
  return totalScore;
}

// Example usage:
let existingAttrs = ['red', 'cotton'];
let identifiedAttrs = ['red', 'cotton', 'long sleeve'];
let attributeWeights = {
  'red': 0.5,
  'cotton': 0.6,
  'long sleeve': 0.9 // Higher weight because users frequently respond to 'long sleeve'
};
let discrepancy = calculateDiscrepancyScore(existingAttrs, identifiedAttrs, attributeWeights);
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy of attribute verification.
*   More relevant and useful suggested revisions.
*   Personalized item descriptions tailored to user preferences.
*   Adaptability to changing fashion trends and user behavior.
