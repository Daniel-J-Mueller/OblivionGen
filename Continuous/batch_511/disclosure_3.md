## Secure Zone Assisted, Decentralized Key Management & Rotation

**Concept:** Extend the secure zone functionality not just for cryptographic *operations*, but for secure, decentralized key *management* and automatic key rotation – leveraging a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) for tamper-proof audit trails and resilience.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Secure Zone Key Manager (SZKM):**  Resides within the existing secure zone. Responsible for key generation, encryption/decryption, storage of root keys (never leaving the secure zone), and interacting with the DLT.
*   **Distributed Ledger (DLT):** A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) or similar DLT. Stores metadata about keys (key IDs, associated applications, rotation schedules, access control policies), *not* the keys themselves.  Nodes on the DLT are trusted entities (e.g., hardware security modules, trusted servers).
*   **Non-Secure Zone Key Client (NSZK):** Resides in the non-secure zone.  Handles requests for keys from applications, interfaces with the SZKM, and retrieves key metadata from the DLT.
*   **Key Rotation Service (KRS):**  A component within the SZKM responsible for automating key rotation based on pre-defined schedules or events.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Key Generation:**  The KRS within the SZKM generates a new key pair.  The private key *never* leaves the secure zone.
2.  **Metadata Registration:** The KRS generates a unique Key ID, associated metadata (application, rotation schedule, access controls), and writes this metadata to the DLT.  This is a cryptographically signed transaction.
3.  **Key Encryption & Export:** The SZKM encrypts the public key using a key derived from the device’s second persistent key (as already in the patent). The *encrypted* public key is then securely exported to the non-secure zone and made available via NSZK.
4.  **Application Request:**  An application in the non-secure zone requires a key. It contacts the NSZK, providing the Key ID.
5.  **Metadata Verification:** The NSZK retrieves the key metadata from the DLT, verifying the signature to ensure integrity.
6.  **Public Key Retrieval:** NSZK requests and receives the encrypted public key.
7.  **Secure Operation:** The application uses the decrypted public key for cryptographic operations.  All sensitive operations still happen *within* the secure zone, triggered by the application.
8.  **Key Rotation:** The KRS automatically rotates keys according to schedule. New metadata is written to the DLT, and a new encrypted public key is distributed.  Old keys are archived (but kept accessible for decryption of older data).

**3. Pseudocode (Key Rotation - KRS):**

```pseudocode
function rotateKey(keyID):
  // Generate new key pair
  newPrivateKey, newPublicKey = generateKeyPair()

  // Create metadata for new key
  metadata = {
    keyID: keyID,
    timestamp: getCurrentTimestamp(),
    newPublicKey: newPublicKey,
    // other metadata: rotation schedule, access controls
  }

  // Sign the metadata with the SZKM’s private key
  signedMetadata = signMetadata(metadata)

  // Write the signed metadata to the DLT
  writeToDLT(signedMetadata)

  // Encrypt the new public key using the device’s second persistent key
  encryptedPublicKey = encrypt(newPublicKey, secondPersistentKey)

  // Distribute the encrypted public key to the NSZK

  // Archive the old key (for decryption of older data)
end function
```

**4.  Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** Integrate MPC techniques within the secure zone to further enhance key management security.
*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM) Integration:** Use HSMs as DLT nodes for even stronger security and trust.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Implement fine-grained access control policies for keys, allowing for dynamic updates based on application needs.
