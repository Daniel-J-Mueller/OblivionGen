## Dynamic Contextual Cue Weighting & Prediction

**System Overview:** A system which extends the existing contextual cue analysis by introducing dynamic weighting based on document type and learned user/editor behavior, and expands it to *predict* continuation status *before* page breaks occur.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of solely reacting to cues *at* a page break, the system will anticipate potential continuations and highlight likely continuation points *before* the break, using predictive modeling.

**Specifications:**

**1. Document Type Classification Module:**

*   **Input:** Document content (text, formatting, images).
*   **Process:** Utilize a machine learning model (trained on a large corpus of documents) to classify the document type (e.g., legal contract, novel, scientific paper, email).
*   **Output:** Document type classification with a confidence score.

**2. Dynamic Cue Weighting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Document type, contextual cues (indentation, punctuation, capitalization, trailing spaces, grammar), user/editor feedback history.
*   **Process:**
    *   Maintain a configurable weighting table for each contextual cue, *specific to each document type*. For example, indentation might be heavily weighted in a legal contract, but less so in a novel.
    *   Implement a feedback loop. If an editor consistently overrides the system's continuation prediction for a specific cue in a specific document type, *increase* the weight of editor overrides for that cue/type combination.
    *   Allow manual adjustment of weights by expert users.
*   **Output:** Weighted score for each contextual cue, representing its likelihood of indicating a continuation.

**3. Predictive Continuation Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Document content, weighted contextual cues, current page number, line number.
*   **Process:**
    *   As the document is rendered, scan the content *before* a page break.
    *   Calculate a “continuation probability score” for each line based on the weighted cues present on that line.
    *   If the score exceeds a configurable threshold, highlight the line with a visual indicator (e.g., a subtle background color, a small icon). This indicates a *likely* continuation point.
    *   Maintain a short-term memory of past page breaks and continuation decisions to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Output:** Visual highlighting of likely continuation points before page breaks.

**4. Editor Feedback Integration:**

*   **Input:** Editor confirmation or cancellation of continuation predictions.
*   **Process:**
    *   Store editor decisions along with the document type, contextual cues involved, and the confidence score of the initial prediction.
    *   Use this data to refine the weighting table and the predictive model.
    *   Implement an "explainability" feature. Allow the editor to see *why* the system made a particular prediction (e.g., "High indentation and presence of a semicolon indicate a potential continuation").

**Pseudocode (Predictive Continuation Modeling):**

```
function predictContinuation(documentContent, documentType, currentPage, currentLine):
  cues = analyzeContextualCues(documentContent, currentLine)
  weights = getCueWeights(documentType)
  continuationScore = calculateScore(cues, weights)
  if continuationScore > threshold:
    highlightLine(currentLine)
  return continuationScore

function calculateScore(cues, weights):
  score = 0
  for cue in cues:
    if cue in weights:
      score += cue.weight * cue.strength //strength represents how strong the cue is on the line
  return score

```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Standard computer with sufficient memory and processing power.
*   Machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries.
*   User interface for editor feedback.
