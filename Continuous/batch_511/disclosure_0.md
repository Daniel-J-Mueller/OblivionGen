## Dynamic Attribute Weighting for Price Suggestion

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Attribute Weighting Engine (AWE)
*   **Data Input:** Historical Sales Data (as in the provided patent), Real-time Market Data (competitor pricing, supply/demand signals), User Behavioral Data (clicks, views, purchase history), Attribute Importance Scores (initially seeded, dynamically updated - see below).
*   **Data Output:** Dynamically Weighted Attribute Sets, Adjusted Price Ranges, Confidence Scores.

**Innovation Description:**

The existing system appears to rely on static attribute importance within item classifications. This creates a rigidity that doesn't account for fluctuating market dynamics or consumer preferences. This design proposes a system where attribute weights *within* a classification are dynamically adjusted based on real-time data. 

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **Initial Attribute Seeding:** For each item classification, a set of initial attribute importance scores is assigned (e.g., “Screen Size” = 0.3, “Brand” = 0.2, “RAM” = 0.5 for laptops).  This can be manually assigned initially, or derived from initial analysis of historical sales data.

2.  **Real-time Data Integration:**
    *   **Market Signals:** Monitor competitor pricing for similar items. If competitors heavily emphasize a particular attribute (e.g., ‘Battery Life’ for smartphones), the weight for that attribute is *temporarily* increased.
    *   **Supply/Demand:** If there’s a sudden surge in demand for items with a specific attribute (e.g., ‘Water Resistance’ after a weather event), the weight for that attribute increases.
    *   **User Behavioral Analysis:** Track which attributes users are *actively* focusing on (clicks, views, filtering) when browsing items within a classification.  Higher engagement with an attribute translates to increased weight.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze user reviews for keywords related to attributes. Positive sentiment towards a specific attribute increases its weight.

3.  **Weight Adjustment Algorithm:** 
    A tiered weighting system will be used. Weights will be shifted according to the volume of supporting data. 
    *   **Base Weight:** Initial attribute importance score.
    *   **Dynamic Weight:** Calculated based on the real-time data integration (market signals, user behavior, sentiment analysis).  A sigmoid function will be employed to smooth weight adjustments and prevent excessive fluctuations.
        *   `Dynamic Weight = Sigmoid(DataVolume * Sensitivity)`
            *   `DataVolume`:  A combined score representing the volume of supporting data for the attribute.
            *   `Sensitivity`: A tunable parameter that controls how responsive the weight adjustment is.

    *   **Final Weight:** `Final Weight = Base Weight + Dynamic Weight`
    *   **Normalization:** After each weight adjustment cycle, all attribute weights within a classification are normalized to ensure they sum to 1.

4.  **Price Range Calculation:** The price suggestion engine utilizes the dynamically weighted attributes to filter historical sales data. Instead of simply matching attribute values, a weighted similarity score is calculated between the current item and historical transactions. This weighted score determines the relevance of each historical transaction when calculating the suggested price range.

5. **Confidence Score:** A confidence score is generated based on the amount of available data and the stability of the dynamic attribute weights. This score indicates the reliability of the suggested price range.

**Pseudocode (Core Module - Attribute Weighting Engine):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateWeightedPriceRange(itemClassification, attributeValues, historicalSalesData)

    attributeWeights = GetInitialAttributeWeights(itemClassification)

    // Integrate real-time data
    marketSignals = GetMarketSignals(itemClassification)
    userBehavior = GetUserBehavior(itemClassification)
    sentimentAnalysis = GetSentimentAnalysis(itemClassification)

    // Adjust attribute weights
    attributeWeights = AdjustAttributeWeights(attributeWeights, marketSignals, userBehavior, sentimentAnalysis)

    // Normalize weights
    attributeWeights = NormalizeWeights(attributeWeights)

    // Calculate weighted similarity score for each historical transaction
    FOR EACH transaction IN historicalSalesData
        similarityScore = CalculateSimilarityScore(transaction.attributeValues, attributeValues, attributeWeights)
        transaction.weightedScore = similarityScore // Store weighted score
    END FOR

    // Filter transactions based on weighted score (e.g., top 20% most similar)

    // Calculate suggested price range from filtered transactions

    RETURN suggestedPriceRange, confidenceScore
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Attribute Weighting:** Adapt attribute weights based on individual user preferences (derived from browsing history and past purchases).
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual fluctuations in attribute weights that might indicate market manipulation or data errors.
*   **Predictive Weighting:** Utilize machine learning models to predict future attribute weight trends based on historical data and external factors.
