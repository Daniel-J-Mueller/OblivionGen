## Dynamic Illumination Mapping with Perceptual Anchors

**System Overview:** A system to augment display color calibration with user-specific perceptual anchors, creating a highly personalized and adaptive viewing experience. This goes beyond simple white point correction to model how *individuals* perceive color shifts under varying ambient conditions.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Perceptual Anchor Database:** Stores individualized color perception profiles. These are built through an initial calibration phase (described below).
2.  **Ambient Light Sensor Suite:** Extends beyond basic RGB sensing. Includes a spectral sensor to capture a fuller ambient light profile *and* a directional light sensor to understand the angle of incidence of external light sources.
3.  **Real-time Perceptual Modeling Engine:** This engine combines ambient light data, the user’s perceptual anchor, and display characteristics to compute a dynamic color calibration matrix.
4.  **Adaptive Display Control:** Applies the computed calibration matrix to the display, adjusting color output on a frame-by-frame basis.

**Calibration Phase:**

1.  **Initial Profiling:** The user is presented with a series of subtly shifting color gradients on the display. They are asked to identify when the color “snaps” or becomes noticeably different. This establishes their individual sensitivity to color changes.
2.  **Anchor Point Identification:** The system identifies specific color points where the user exhibits consistent perceptual shifts. These become the “anchors” in their perceptual profile.
3.  **Profile Creation:** A multi-dimensional perceptual map is created, representing the user’s color sensitivity across the visible spectrum.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Ambient Light Acquisition:** The ambient light sensor suite continuously monitors the surrounding environment.
2.  **Light Source Analysis:** The system analyzes the spectral composition and angle of incidence of light sources. This data is used to model the influence of external light on the perceived display colors.
3.  **Perceptual Compensation:** The perceptual modeling engine computes the necessary color adjustments to counteract the effects of ambient light *and* account for the user’s individual perceptual anchors.
4.  **Dynamic Calibration:** The computed calibration matrix is applied to the display, adjusting the color output in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Perceptual Compensation Engine):**

```
function compute_calibration_matrix(ambient_light_data, user_perceptual_profile, display_characteristics) {

  // 1. Project ambient light spectrum onto display primaries
  projected_ambient = project_spectrum(ambient_light_data, display_characteristics);

  // 2. Calculate color shift due to ambient light
  ambient_shift = calculate_color_shift(projected_ambient);

  // 3. Retrieve user perceptual anchors
  anchors = get_user_anchors(user_perceptual_profile);

  // 4. Calculate perceptual correction based on anchors
  perceptual_correction = calculate_perceptual_correction(anchors, ambient_shift);

  // 5. Combine ambient shift and perceptual correction
  total_correction = combine_corrections(ambient_shift, perceptual_correction);

  // 6. Generate color calibration matrix
  calibration_matrix = generate_matrix(total_correction);

  return calibration_matrix;
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution spectral sensor.
*   Directional light sensor (for angle of incidence).
*   Dedicated processing unit for real-time calculations.
*   Fast communication interface between sensor, processor, and display.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with eye-tracking to further refine perceptual compensation based on gaze direction.
*   Machine learning algorithms to predict user perceptual shifts based on environmental factors and viewing habits.
*   Cloud-based profile sharing to enable personalized viewing experiences across multiple devices.
