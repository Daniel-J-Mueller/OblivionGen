## Dynamic WS Composition via Predictive Usage

**Concept:** Extend the usage model configuration to facilitate *automatic composition* of Web Services (WS) based on predicted consumer needs *before* a request is made. This goes beyond simply *controlling access* to existing WS; it proactively *builds* WS chains.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Engine Module:**

   *   **Input:** Historical usage data (from the existing system), real-time consumer context (location, device, time, inferred intent from prior actions, etc.), publicly available data (trending topics, current events).
   *   **Process:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained to predict likely WS usage sequences.  The model outputs a probability distribution over possible WS compositions.
   *   **Output:**  A ranked list of predicted WS compositions, along with confidence scores.

**2. Pre-Composition Service:**

   *   **Trigger:**  Based on the Predictive Engine's output *and* a threshold confidence score.  This happens *before* any explicit consumer request is made.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  For the top N predicted compositions, pre-instantiate (or reserve capacity for) the required WS.
        2.  Create a temporary "composite WS" endpoint.
        3.  Cache the pre-composed WS chain and associated metadata (pricing, restrictions, expected response time).
   *   **Output:** A unique identifier for the pre-composed WS chain.

**3. Consumer Request Handling:**

   *   **Process:**
        1.  When a consumer request arrives, first attempt to match it to a pre-composed WS chain.
        2.  If a match is found *and* the consumer’s usage model aligns with the pre-composed chain’s restrictions, immediately route the request to the pre-composed chain.
        3.  If no match is found, or the usage model doesn't align, fall back to the existing system for dynamic WS discovery and composition.

**4. Usage Model Extension:**

   *   The existing usage model system must be extended to include:
        *   “Pre-composition Eligibility” flag (enables/disables pre-composition for a WS).
        *   “Predicted Usage Cost Multiplier” (allows providers to adjust pricing for pre-composed chains, potentially offering discounts for guaranteed capacity).
        *   “Maximum Pre-composition Wait Time” (limits how long a pre-composed chain can be cached before being released).

**5. System Monitoring and Adaptation:**

   *   Continuous monitoring of pre-composition hit rates, response times, and cost.
   *   Automated adjustment of the Predictive Engine's parameters and the system’s thresholds based on performance data.
   *   Feedback loop:  Monitor consumer behavior *after* using a pre-composed chain to refine future predictions.

**Pseudocode (Consumer Request Handling):**

```
function handleConsumerRequest(request, consumerUsageModel):
  precomposedChainId = findMatchingPrecomposedChain(request)

  if precomposedChainId != null and consumerUsageModel satisfies chain restrictions:
    routeRequestToPrecomposedChain(request, precomposedChainId)
    return success

  else:
    // Fallback to existing dynamic WS discovery & composition
    composedChain = discoverAndComposeWS(request)
    processRequestWithComposedChain(composedChain, request)
    return success

```
