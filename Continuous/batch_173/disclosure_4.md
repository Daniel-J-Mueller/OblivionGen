## Dynamic Codelet Partitioning & Adaptive Fleet Allocation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically partitioning user code into ‘codelets’ based on execution characteristics, and allocating these codelets to specialized fleets optimized for those characteristics. This extends beyond simply high/low volume, encompassing resource profiles (CPU, memory, GPU), I/O patterns, and dependency graphs.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Codelet Analyzer:** (Software Module)
    *   Input: User code (function, microservice, etc.).
    *   Process:  Static and dynamic analysis to identify distinct functional units ('codelets').  Analysis includes:
        *   Dependency graph creation: Identifies dependencies between code sections.
        *   Resource profiling: Estimates CPU, memory, I/O usage for each codelet.
        *   I/O Pattern Classification:  Identifies I/O bound vs. Compute bound codelets.
        *   Dataflow analysis:  Determines data dependencies and potential parallelism.
    *   Output:  Codelet metadata:  Codelet ID, resource requirements, dependency list, I/O profile, estimated execution time.

2.  **Fleet Specialization Manager:** (Software Module)
    *   Input: Configuration defining available fleets & their specializations.  (e.g., "CPU-Heavy", "Memory-Intensive", "GPU-Accelerated", "I/O Optimized").
    *   Process:  Manages the creation & scaling of specialized fleets.
    *   Output:  Fleet configuration data: Fleet ID, specialization type, current capacity, scaling policies.

3.  **Request Router & Orchestrator:** (Software Module)
    *   Input: User request. Codelet metadata. Fleet configuration data.
    *   Process:
        1.  Decomposes request into constituent codelets.
        2.  Maps each codelet to the optimal fleet based on its resource profile & fleet specialization.
        3.  Orchestrates the execution of codelets across multiple fleets, managing data dependencies & inter-codelet communication.
        4.  Dynamically adjusts codelet allocation based on real-time performance monitoring (latency, throughput, resource utilization).

4. **Performance Monitoring & Feedback Loop:** (Software Module)
    *   Process: Continuously monitors the performance of codelets across different fleets.
    *   Output: Performance metrics (latency, throughput, resource utilization).  These metrics are used to refine the codelet analysis, fleet specialization, and request routing algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Request Router & Orchestrator):**

```pseudocode
function routeRequest(request):
  codelets = analyzeRequest(request) // Calls Codelet Analyzer
  for codelet in codelets:
    fleet = selectOptimalFleet(codelet) // Uses fleet specialization data
    routeCodeletToFleet(codelet, fleet)
  orchestrateExecution(codelets) // Manages dependencies & communication
  monitorPerformance(codelets) // Feedback loop
end function

function selectOptimalFleet(codelet):
  // Compare codelet resource requirements with fleet specializations
  // Use a scoring function based on resource match, latency, and cost
  return bestFleet
end function

function orchestrateExecution(codelets):
  // Execute codelets in parallel or sequentially based on dependencies
  // Manage data transfer between codelets
  // Handle errors and retries
end function
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond simply classifying code by volume, dynamically partitioning code based on multifaceted characteristics & allocating those parts to *specialized* fleets.  This enables fine-grained resource optimization, improved performance, and greater scalability.  The continuous feedback loop ensures the system adapts to changing workloads & optimizes resource allocation in real-time.
