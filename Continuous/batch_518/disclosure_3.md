## Dynamic Code Provenance & Risk Scoring

**Specification:** A system that extends static code analysis by dynamically tracking code lineage, contribution history, and associated risk factors, presenting a "provenance map" alongside potential issues.

**Core Concept:**  The current patent focuses on identifying *what* is wrong with code. This system focuses on *who* wrote it, *how* it got there, and the *historical risk* associated with that code path.  It's about understanding the context *behind* the potential issues, not just the issues themselves.

**Components:**

1.  **Code Contribution Tracking Module:**
    *   Integrates with version control systems (Git, SVN, etc.).
    *   Records author, commit message, date, and associated metadata for every code change.
    *   Builds a directed graph representing the code's evolution, identifying "risk nodes" (authors with a history of introducing vulnerabilities, commits flagged for code smells, etc.).

2.  **Risk Factor Database:**
    *   Maintains a database of risk factors associated with authors, commit messages, branches, and specific code patterns.
    *   Risk factors are dynamically updated based on historical vulnerability data, code review feedback, and security scans.
    *   Example risk factors:
        *   Author: "History of SQL injection vulnerabilities" (weight: 8)
        *   Commit Message: "Quick fix" (weight: 3) - often indicative of rushed, untested code.
        *   Branch: "Hotfix" (weight: 5) - implies urgent, potentially less rigorous development.
        *   Code Pattern: "Use of deprecated function X" (weight: 4)

3.  **Provenance Map Generator:**
    *   Visualizes the code’s lineage as a directed graph.
    *   Highlights risk nodes based on the risk factor database.
    *   Allows developers to "drill down" into specific code changes, view author details, commit messages, and associated risk scores.

4.  **Dynamic Risk Scoring Engine:**
    *   Calculates a “provenance score” for each code block based on its lineage and associated risk factors.
    *   Integrates with the existing static analysis tool, weighting potential issues based on their provenance score.  High-provenance issues are flagged with higher priority.

**Pseudocode (Risk Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateProvenanceScore(codeBlock):
  provenanceScore = 0
  codePath = getCodePath(codeBlock) // Returns a list of commits/changes that led to this code block

  for each change in codePath:
    author = change.author
    commitMessage = change.commitMessage
    riskScoreAuthor = getRiskScore(author) // Retrieves from Risk Factor Database
    riskScoreCommit = getRiskScore(commitMessage) // Retrieves from Risk Factor Database

    provenanceScore += riskScoreAuthor + riskScoreCommit

  return provenanceScore
```

**Integration with Existing Scanner:**

The existing scanner’s output is augmented with a "Provenance Score" field for each potential issue. Developers can sort and filter issues based on provenance, allowing them to prioritize remediation efforts.

**User Interface Features:**

*   Interactive Provenance Map within the IDE.
*   Color-coded risk indicators on the map.
*   Ability to view author details, commit history, and risk scores with a single click.
*   Filter and sort potential issues by provenance score.
