## Adaptive Resonance Conduit for Variable Angle Sensing

**Concept:** Expand the cylindrical conduit concept to a dynamically adjustable system, allowing for fine-tuned sensor alignment *after* installation, compensating for manufacturing tolerances, vehicle deformation, or changing environmental conditions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Replace the static cylindrical conduit with a segmented, resonantly coupled conduit.  Each segment will be a short cylinder constructed from a shape-memory alloy (SMA) with embedded piezoelectric actuators.
*   **Segmentation:** Conduit will be comprised of 5-7 segments, each approximately 15-20mm long.  The number of segments impacts resolution and range of motion.
*   **Actuation:** Each segment will have 3-4 micro-piezoelectric actuators bonded to its outer surface, strategically positioned to induce bending and rotation.  Actuators controlled independently via a micro-controller.
*   **Resonant Coupling:**  Segments will be joined by a flexible, but electrically conductive, polymer “skin.” This skin provides structural integrity while facilitating electrical communication for both control signals *and* strain sensing.
*   **Strain Sensing:** The polymer skin will incorporate piezoresistive sensors to monitor segment deformation. This data will be fed back to the controller for closed-loop control, allowing for precise alignment and calibration.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated micro-controller (e.g., ESP32) will manage actuator signals, process strain sensor data, and execute alignment routines. Controller will be accessible via wireless communication (Bluetooth/WiFi).
*   **Power:** Low-voltage DC power supply connected to the vehicle's electrical system. Power management circuit to minimize energy consumption.
*   **Mounting:** The adaptive conduit will integrate with the existing external housing assembly. Retaining features will be designed to secure the conduit while allowing for controlled articulation.
*   **Calibration Routine:** A software-based calibration routine will be available via a mobile app. The routine will guide the user through a series of steps to optimize sensor alignment based on visual feedback. (e.g. alignment with lane markings.)
*   **Materials:**
    *   Segments: Nickel-Titanium Shape Memory Alloy.
    *   Skin: Electrically conductive polymer composite (e.g., carbon nanotube infused silicone).
    *   Housing: High-impact resistant polymer or aluminum alloy.
