## Dynamic Constraint Profiles & Predictive Relaxation

**Concept:** Extend the account-based constraint system to include *dynamic* constraint profiles that adapt based on observed user behavior and predicted resource impact. Rather than simply 'on' or 'off' constraint relaxation, the system learns to *predict* the potential for negative impact and proactively adjusts constraint severity.

**Specs:**

*   **Constraint Profile Definition:** Introduce a data structure for defining constraint profiles. These profiles consist of:
    *   `Profile Name`: (String) - e.g., "LowRiskDev", "HighImpactBatch", "InteractiveTesting"
    *   `Base Constraints`: (List of Constraint Objects) - Defines default constraint settings (wait times, quotas, encryption levels).
    *   `Behavioral Triggers`: (List of Trigger Objects) - Conditions that initiate constraint adjustments.
    *   `Adjustment Rules`: (List of Rule Objects) - Specifies how constraints are modified when triggers fire.
*   **Trigger Objects:** Define conditions for activating adjustment rules:
    *   `Metric`: (String) – The monitored metric (e.g., "CPU Usage", "Data Deletion Rate", "API Call Frequency").
    *   `Threshold`: (Float) – The value at which the trigger activates.
    *   `Duration`: (Integer) – The time window over which the metric is evaluated.
*   **Rule Objects:** Define how constraints are modified:
    *   `Target Constraint`: (String) – The name of the constraint to modify.
    *   `Adjustment Type`: (Enum: “Increase”, “Decrease”, “Override”) - How to change the constraint.
    *   `Adjustment Value`: (Float) – The amount to change the constraint by.
*   **Behavioral Monitoring Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors user actions and resource utilization.
    *   Collects metrics for each account/user.
    *   Tracks historical data to build behavioral models.
*   **Predictive Engine:**
    *   Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to predict resource impact based on current and historical data.
    *   Predicts potential constraint violations *before* they occur.
*   **Constraint Adjustment Service:**
    *   Receives predictions from the Predictive Engine.
    *   Dynamically adjusts constraint profiles based on predicted impact.
    *   Applies adjustments in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Constraint Adjustment Service):**

```
function adjustConstraints(accountID, actionRequest):
  accountData = getAccountData(accountID)
  profile = accountData.constraintProfile // Retrieve current profile

  predictedImpact = PredictiveEngine.predictImpact(accountID, actionRequest)

  if predictedImpact > thresholdForAdjustment:
    newProfile = applyDynamicAdjustment(profile, predictedImpact)
    updateAccountProfile(accountID, newProfile)
  else:
    // Use default profile constraints
    useProfileConstraints(profile, actionRequest)
```

**Example Scenario:**

A developer account is typically running under a "LowRiskDev" profile. If the Predictive Engine detects a rapid increase in data deletion requests (potentially indicating a testing script gone awry), the system *proactively* reduces the deletion quota or temporarily pauses deletions, preventing accidental data loss. The system logs the intervention and alerts the developer. Once the risk subsides, the quota is automatically restored.
