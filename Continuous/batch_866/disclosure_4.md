## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the existing comprehension guide system by incorporating real-time physiological data (biofeedback) from the user to dynamically adjust the difficulty scoring of words. This creates a truly personalized learning experience, responding to the user’s cognitive load *as it happens*.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Integration:** Compatible with readily available wearable sensors. Specifically, heart rate variability (HRV) monitors, electrodermal activity (EDA) sensors (measuring sweat gland activity – a proxy for arousal/stress), and potentially electroencephalography (EEG) headbands (though this adds complexity). Wireless communication (Bluetooth preferred) to the rendering device (e.g., e-reader, tablet).
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing Module:** A software module running on the rendering device. 
    *   Receives raw data streams from the wearable sensor.
    *   Applies signal processing techniques (filtering, noise reduction, artifact removal) to clean the data.
    *   Derives real-time metrics of cognitive load:
        *   **HRV:** Lower HRV generally indicates higher stress/cognitive load.
        *   **EDA:** Increased EDA signals higher arousal/stress.
        *   **EEG (Optional):** Alpha and theta band activity can be indicative of relaxed/focused attention, while beta and gamma bands indicate active processing.  (Implementation would require more complex algorithms/AI.)
*   **Scoring Adjustment Algorithm:** Modifies the existing word difficulty score based on the derived cognitive load metrics. 
    *   **Base Score:** The existing algorithm’s output (based on frequency, contextual importance, user history, etc.).
    *   **Cognitive Load Factor:** A value derived from the real-time physiological data.  Higher cognitive load = higher factor.
    *   **Adjusted Score = Base Score * (1 + Cognitive Load Factor)**  (The factor adds a proportional adjustment.  A higher base score would be more heavily influenced.)
*   **Dynamic Comprehension Guide Activation:** The system continuously re-evaluates the adjusted scores and activates/deactivates comprehension guides based on a predefined threshold.  If the adjusted score exceeds the threshold, the guide is presented.
*   **Calibration Phase:** Upon initial setup, the system requires a brief calibration phase.  The user engages in a short reading exercise while physiological data is recorded. This establishes a baseline for the user's "normal" cognitive load during reading.
*   **User Preferences:** Allow the user to customize the sensitivity of the system, adjust the thresholds for guide activation, and select which physiological metrics are used.
*   **Data Privacy:** All physiological data is processed locally on the device. No data is transmitted to external servers without explicit user consent.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (reading) {
    // 1. Acquire Physiological Data
    physiologicalData = getPhysiologicalData()  // HRV, EDA, EEG (optional)
    
    // 2. Process Data
    cognitiveLoad = calculateCognitiveLoad(physiologicalData) // Algorithm to derive load from data

    // 3. Get Existing Word Score
    wordScore = existingScoringAlgorithm(currentWord)
    
    // 4. Adjust Score
    adjustedScore = wordScore * (1 + cognitiveLoad)

    // 5. Determine if Guide is Needed
    if (adjustedScore > guideThreshold) {
        presentComprehensionGuide(currentWord)
    }
}
```
