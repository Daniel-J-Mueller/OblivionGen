## Dynamic Audio Segmentation & Contextual Embedding for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend pre-wakeword audio processing to not just capture *before* the wakeword, but to dynamically segment audio streams into meaningful ‘scenes’ based on acoustic context, and proactively embed those scenes with contextual metadata before *any* wakeword is detected. This moves beyond reactive capture to anticipatory understanding.

**Specs:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Detection (ASD) Module:**  A real-time ASD module utilizing a combination of spectral features (MFCCs, Chroma features), temporal features (Zero Crossing Rate, Root Mean Square Energy), and potentially learned embeddings from a pre-trained audio classification model (e.g., AudioSet).  Target scene categories: ‘speech’, ‘music’, ‘environmental sound’ (e.g., traffic, birds, office noise).  Confidence threshold adjustable via configuration.
*   **Segmentation Engine:**  Based on ASD output, segment the audio stream.  Segmentation criteria:
    *   Scene changes (confidence above threshold).
    *   Silence detection (energy below threshold for >X seconds).
    *   Significant changes in spectral characteristics (e.g., using a change point detection algorithm).
*   **Contextual Embedding Generator:**  For each segment:
    *   **Audio Embedding:** Generate a fixed-length vector representation of the segment's audio using a pre-trained audio embedding model (e.g., based on a contrastive learning approach).
    *   **Metadata Enrichment:**
        *   **Time-of-Day:** Timestamp of the segment start.
        *   **Location (Optional):** GPS coordinates if available from a paired device.
        *   **Device State:**  Device status (e.g., screen on/off, volume level, currently running app).
        *   **Environmental Sound Classification:**  If an environmental sound is dominant, its label.
*   **Sliding Window Buffer:** Maintain a circular buffer of the last Y seconds of audio data, broken down into segments with associated embeddings.  This allows for capturing pre-wakeword audio even if the wakeword occurs unexpectedly.  The buffer size (Y) is configurable.
*   **Wakeword Detection Integration:**  The wakeword detection engine triggers *after* the buffer has been populated. The relevant portion of the buffer (based on wakeword timestamp) is selected, and the corresponding segment embeddings are included with the speech processing request.
*   **Proactive Assistance Trigger:** Monitor segment embeddings for patterns indicative of specific user needs or intentions *before* a wakeword is detected. For example:
    *   Consistent detection of music segments could trigger a "Would you like me to control your music?" prompt.
    *   Detection of environmental sounds (e.g., baby crying) could trigger a notification.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Assistance Logic):**

```
function analyze_audio_segment(segment_embedding):
  # Load pre-trained model for intent recognition
  intent_model = load_model("intent_recognition_model")

  # Predict intent from embedding
  predicted_intent, confidence = intent_model.predict(segment_embedding)

  if confidence > threshold:
    # Trigger appropriate action
    if predicted_intent == "play_music":
      display_prompt("Would you like me to play music?")
    elif predicted_intent == "baby_cry_detected":
      send_notification("Baby crying detected")

function main_loop():
  while True:
    # Get next audio segment
    segment = get_next_audio_segment()

    # Generate segment embedding
    embedding = generate_segment_embedding(segment)

    # Analyze embedding for proactive assistance
    analyze_audio_segment(embedding)
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simply capturing pre-wakeword speech to *understanding* the broader audio context before a command is given. This enables proactive assistance and more natural, intuitive interactions. The use of segment embeddings allows for a richer representation of the audio environment and enables more sophisticated intent recognition.
