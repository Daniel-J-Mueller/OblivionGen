## Dynamic Contextual Video Stitching

**Concept:** Extend pre-fetching to dynamically assemble video segments based on user interaction *within* the initial pre-fetched content, creating a personalized, seamless video experience without full video download.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Component: Interaction Monitor:**

   *   **Function:** Tracks user gaze, mouse movements, touch input, and scroll position *within* a pre-fetched initial video segment (e.g., the first 3-5 seconds).
   *   **Data Output:** Generates a real-time "interest vector" representing areas/objects/actions the user is focusing on.  This is a weighted list of identified elements. (e.g., `{“product_feature_A”: 0.8, “model_rotation”: 0.5, “price_tag”: 0.2}`).

**2. Video Segment Database:**

   *   **Structure:** A database containing numerous short (2-10 second) video segments related to the pre-fetched item. Segments are tagged with metadata corresponding to the elements in the "interest vector" (e.g., “product_feature_A”, “close_up_texture”, “demonstration_use_case”).  Multiple segments can correspond to a single tag.
   *   **Content:**  Segments *do not* need to be sequentially ordered in a traditional video editing sense.  They are modular content blocks.

**3. Dynamic Stitching Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Real-time “interest vector” from the Interaction Monitor, Current playback position of the initial pre-fetched segment, Video Segment Database.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  Based on the “interest vector”, the engine queries the Video Segment Database for relevant segments.
        2.  The engine prioritizes segments based on the weight in the interest vector and a 'recency' factor (segments that match recent interaction are favored).
        3.  The engine identifies segments that can be seamlessly stitched together with the currently playing pre-fetched segment (based on visual flow, audio continuity, and pre-defined transition rules).
        4.  The selected segment is downloaded (or streamed) in the background.
        5.  At a pre-defined point in the playback of the current segment (or at the end), the engine smoothly transitions to the new segment.
   *   **Output:**  A continuously assembled, personalized video stream.

**4. Pre-fetching & Buffering:**

   *   **Initial Pre-fetch:**  As in the original patent, pre-fetch the initial video segment.
   *   **Predictive Pre-fetch:**  Based on the “interest vector” and historical user data, *predictively* pre-fetch segments that are likely to be selected next.
   *   **Buffering:** Continuously buffer multiple potential segments to ensure seamless transitions.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Stitching Engine):**

```
function stitch_video(interest_vector, current_segment, database) {
  relevant_segments = database.query(interest_vector);
  prioritized_segments = prioritize(relevant_segments, interest_vector);
  seamless_segment = find_seamless_transition(current_segment, prioritized_segments);

  if (seamless_segment != null) {
    download(seamless_segment);
    transition(current_segment, seamless_segment);
    return seamless_segment;
  } else {
    // If no seamless segment is found, loop the current segment, or display a default segment
    loop(current_segment);
    return current_segment;
  }
}
```

**Innovation:**  This system moves beyond simple pre-fetching of a single video. It enables the creation of a dynamically-assembled, personalized video experience based on real-time user interaction, extending engagement and providing a more immersive and informative experience. The system isn’t limited by a linear video track; it dynamically composes the experience on the fly.
