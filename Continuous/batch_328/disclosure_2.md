## Dynamic Content Stitching & Predictive Resolution

**Concept:** Extend URL rescue beyond simple product replacement to *dynamically stitch together* content from multiple sources based on user intent, *predictively resolving* potentially invalid URLs before the user even encounters them.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Intent Engine:** A natural language processing (NLP) module analyzing URL fragments, query parameters, and user history (if available) to determine the *user’s likely intent*. This goes beyond product identification. For example, a URL containing “red running shoes size 10” should identify the desire for red running shoes *in size 10*, not just *any* red running shoes.
*   **Content Graph:** A knowledge graph linking products, articles, videos, FAQs, support documentation, and other relevant content.  Nodes represent content items. Edges represent relationships (e.g., “is a replacement for”, “is a feature of”, “explains how to use”, "is compatible with"). This is more extensive than the "product relationship data" in the original patent; it models *knowledge*, not just product lineage.
*   **Resolution Engine:**  This engine utilizes the Intent Engine’s output and the Content Graph to construct a *composite response*. This response could include:
    *   A replacement product detail page (as in the original patent).
    *   A curated list of related products.
    *   An article or video addressing a problem the user was likely trying to solve (e.g., “how to fix a broken zipper” if the URL contained “zipper repair”).
    *   A direct answer to a question inferred from the URL (e.g., “What is the warranty on product X?”).
*   **Predictive URL Resolver:** A component proactively identifying potentially invalid URLs *before* a user requests them. This utilizes a trained model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) that learns patterns of URL invalidity (e.g., discontinued products, seasonal items, errors in naming conventions).

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **URL Reception:** The system receives a URL request.
2.  **Validity Check:** The Predictive URL Resolver assesses the URL's validity.
    *   **Valid URL:** Request processed normally.
    *   **Potentially Invalid URL:**  Proceed to Intent Analysis.
    *   **Definitely Invalid URL:** Proceed to Intent Analysis.
3.  **Intent Analysis:** The Intent Engine analyzes the URL and extracts user intent.
4.  **Content Graph Traversal:** The Resolution Engine queries the Content Graph based on the extracted intent.
5.  **Composite Response Generation:** The Resolution Engine constructs a composite response by combining relevant content fragments.  This is dynamic, not pre-defined.
6.  **Response Delivery:** The composite response is delivered to the user.

**III. Pseudocode (Resolution Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION generateCompositeResponse(url, intent):
  contentFragments = []
  
  // 1. Product Replacement (fallback to original patent functionality)
  replacementProduct = findReplacementProduct(url)
  IF replacementProduct != NULL:
    contentFragments.append(getProductDetailPage(replacementProduct))
    
  // 2. Knowledge Graph Query
  relevantContent = queryContentGraph(intent)
  
  // 3. Prioritize and Filter Content
  prioritizedContent = prioritizeContent(relevantContent, intent) 
  filteredContent = filterContent(prioritizedContent, userPreferences) 
  
  // 4. Content Stitching
  stitchedContent = stitchContent(filteredContent) // Combines text, images, videos, etc.
  
  // 5. Dynamic Response Generation
  response = createDynamicResponse(stitchedContent) // Adapts layout based on device
  
  RETURN response
```

**IV.  Technology Stack (Suggested):**

*   **NLP:**  BERT, SpaCy
*   **Knowledge Graph:** Neo4j, Amazon Neptune
*   **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch
*   **API:** RESTful API for integration with existing systems.



This system moves beyond simple URL redirection to create a truly *intelligent* content resolution experience.  It anticipates user needs and provides relevant information proactively, even when the original URL is invalid.
