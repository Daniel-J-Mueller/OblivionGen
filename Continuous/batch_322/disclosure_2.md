## Contextualized Error List with Probabilistic Decay

**Specification:** A system to dynamically manage and prioritize error correction based on user interaction frequency and recency, utilizing a probabilistic decay function on error list entries.

**Core Concept:**  The existing error list functions as a static record of misinterpretations. This expands it to be *contextual*, factoring in how often a user revisits a topic associated with a previous error, and how long ago the error occurred. This dynamically adjusts the “penalty” applied to hypotheses matching erroneous lexical representations.

**Components:**

1.  **Topic Modeling Module:**  Analyzes user utterances to identify underlying topics.  This could utilize LDA, BERT-based topic modeling, or other suitable methods.  Each utterance is associated with one or more topic vectors.

2.  **Error List Enhancement:** The existing error list entries are augmented with:
    *   *Topic Vector(s):* The topic vector(s) associated with the utterance that *caused* the error.
    *   *Timestamp:* The time the error occurred.
    *   *Interaction Count:* Initialized to 0. Incremented each time a user utterance’s topic vector exhibits high cosine similarity (above a threshold, e.g., 0.7) to the error’s topic vector.
    *   *Decay Rate:* A configurable parameter (e.g., 0.01) determining how quickly the error’s influence diminishes.

3.  **Hypothesis Scoring Adjustment:**  During speech processing hypothesis generation:
    *   When a hypothesis matches an entry in the error list, calculate a “decayed penalty”.
    *   *Decayed Penalty =  Initial Penalty * e^(-Decay Rate * (Current Time - Error Timestamp))*
    *   The Initial Penalty is a configurable parameter.
    *   Apply the decayed penalty to the hypothesis score.  Higher decayed penalties reduce the likelihood of selecting the erroneous hypothesis.

4.  **Dynamic Thresholding:** The cosine similarity threshold for incrementing the *Interaction Count* can be dynamically adjusted based on the user's overall interaction patterns.  If a user frequently corrects the system, the threshold could be lowered to be more sensitive.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
class ErrorListEntry:
    def __init__(self, lexical_representations, topic_vector, timestamp):
        self.lexical_representations = lexical_representations
        self.topic_vector = topic_vector
        self.timestamp = timestamp
        self.interaction_count = 0

def calculate_decayed_penalty(entry, current_time, initial_penalty, decay_rate):
    time_delta = current_time - entry.timestamp
    decay_factor = math.exp(-decay_rate * time_delta)
    return initial_penalty * decay_factor

def process_hypothesis(hypothesis, error_list, current_time, initial_penalty, decay_rate, similarity_threshold):
    for entry in error_list:
        similarity = cosine_similarity(hypothesis_topic_vector, entry.topic_vector)
        if similarity > similarity_threshold:
            penalty = calculate_decayed_penalty(entry, current_time, initial_penalty, decay_rate)
            hypothesis_score -= penalty
    return hypothesis_score

#Within the main speech processing loop:
current_time = time.time()
adjusted_hypotheses = []
for hypothesis in generated_hypotheses:
    hypothesis_score = hypothesis.score
    hypothesis_score = process_hypothesis(hypothesis, error_list, current_time, 0.5, 0.01, 0.7)
    adjusted_hypotheses.append((hypothesis, hypothesis_score))
#Select the hypothesis with the highest adjusted score
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   *Initial Penalty:*  Controls the strength of the penalty applied to erroneous hypotheses.
*   *Decay Rate:* Controls how quickly the penalty diminishes over time.
*   *Similarity Threshold:* Controls the sensitivity of the topic matching for incrementing the interaction count.
*   *Topic Modeling Model:* The specific topic modeling algorithm to use.
