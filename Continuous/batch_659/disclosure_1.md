## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Mapping for Predictive Maintenance

**Concept:** Extend beat frequency analysis beyond anomaly *detection* to proactive prediction of component failure using adaptive resonance frequency mapping and a learned failure signature database. Instead of just flagging deviations, the system learns the ‘resonant’ frequencies associated with different stages of degradation, allowing for prediction *before* failure occurs.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **High-Resolution Signal Acquisition:** Existing hardware capable of capturing binary signals extended to include analog data capture modules (voltage, current, temperature) for more granular component state assessment.
*   **Edge Computing Module:** Embedded processor (e.g., ARM-based) for pre-processing signals, performing FFTs, and calculating beat frequencies locally. Reduces bandwidth requirements and latency.
*   **Centralized Server:** High-performance server for storing learned failure signatures, managing the adaptive resonance model, and providing a user interface.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Signal Conditioning Module:** Noise reduction, filtering, and amplification of captured signals. Includes dynamic threshold adjustment based on component operating conditions.
*   **Beat Frequency Calculation Module:** Implements Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and calculates beat frequencies as described in the patent. Enhanced to handle non-stationary signals using Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT).
*   **Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) Module:**  Implements ART neural network. The ART network is initialized with a baseline 'resonance map' based on nominal operating conditions.
*   **Failure Signature Database:** Stores learned 'resonance signatures' for different failure modes.  Signatures are represented as vectors of beat frequency deviations, amplitude changes, and phase shifts.
*   **Prediction Engine:**  Compares current beat frequency patterns with known failure signatures in the database. Uses probabilistic reasoning (Bayesian networks) to estimate the probability of failure for each component.
*   **Alerting System:** Generates alerts based on predicted failure probability. Alerts include recommended maintenance actions and estimated time to failure.
*   **Model Update Module:** Continuously refines the ART model and failure signatures based on new data. Implements reinforcement learning to optimize model accuracy.

**3.  Algorithm & Data Flow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**  Capture analog & binary signals from components.
2.  **Pre-processing:**  Signal conditioning, noise reduction.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** Calculate beat frequencies using FFT/STFT.  Extract peak frequencies, amplitude, and phase information.
4.  **Resonance Mapping:**
    *   Input beat frequency pattern into the ART network.
    *   The ART network maps the pattern to a resonance category.
    *   If the pattern doesn't match any existing category, a new resonance category is created.
5.  **Signature Comparison:** Compare current resonance map with failure signatures in the database.  Use distance metrics (e.g., Euclidean distance) to quantify similarity.
6.  **Failure Prediction:**  Estimate probability of failure based on signature comparison results.
7.  **Model Update:**  If a component fails, update the ART model and failure signatures with new data.  Use reinforcement learning to reward accurate predictions.
8.  **Alerting:** Generate alerts if predicted failure probability exceeds a threshold.

**Pseudocode (ART Network):**

```
function ART_Match(input_pattern, resonance_map):
  best_match_category = NULL
  min_distance = INFINITY

  for each category in resonance_map:
    distance = calculate_distance(input_pattern, category.pattern)

    if distance < min_distance:
      min_distance = distance
      best_match_category = category

  if min_distance > threshold:
    // Create new category
    new_category = Category(input_pattern)
    resonance_map.add(new_category)
    return new_category
  else:
    return best_match_category
```

**4. Data Storage:**

*   Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) for storing raw signal data and calculated features.
*   Graph database (e.g., Neo4j) for representing relationships between components, failure modes, and signatures.
*   Object storage (e.g., AWS S3) for storing learned models and training data.

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond simple anomaly detection to *predictive* maintenance by learning the ‘resonant’ frequencies associated with different stages of component degradation. It leverages ART neural networks for adaptive modeling of component behavior and uses a comprehensive database of failure signatures to enable accurate prediction of component failure. This allows for proactive maintenance and minimizes downtime.
