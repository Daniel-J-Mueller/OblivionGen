## Dynamic Content Weaving with AI-Driven Scene Graphs

**Concept:** Extend the plug-in architecture to incorporate AI-driven scene graph generation, enabling dynamic content weaving that reacts not just to user interaction, but to *predicted* user intent and contextual awareness.  This goes beyond simply rendering different portions; it actively *re-authors* the presented content in real-time.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Architecture – Scene Graph Manager (SGM):**

*   **Function:** Central component responsible for constructing and managing a scene graph representing the displayed content. The scene graph isn't static; it's a live, mutable structure.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Base Content: The original content item (text, images, video, etc.).
    *   User Interaction Data: Input events (touches, clicks, voice commands).
    *   Contextual Data: Location, time, device type, user profile, sensor data.
    *   AI Prediction Engine Output: Predicted user intent, content relevance scores.
*   **Outputs:** Modified Scene Graph.

**2. AI Prediction Engine:**

*   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer-based model trained on user interaction data and content metadata.
*   **Function:** Predicts user intent (e.g., "user will likely click on this button," "user is searching for more information about X").  Also assigns relevance scores to different content elements.
*   **Output:**  Predicted Intent (probability distribution over possible actions), Relevance Scores.

**3. Dynamic Plug-in API:**

*   **New API Calls:**
    *   `getSceneGraph()`: Returns the current scene graph.
    *   `modifySceneGraph(sceneGraph, modifications)`: Allows plug-ins to alter the scene graph directly.  `modifications` is a data structure describing the changes to be made (e.g., add node, remove node, change property).
    *   `registerSceneGraphObserver(observer)`: Allows plug-ins to receive notifications when the scene graph changes.
*   **Plug-in Responsibilities:** Plug-ins are now responsible for *generating* content elements based on the scene graph and predicted user intent, rather than simply rendering pre-defined content portions.

**4. Content Weaving Process:**

1.  **Base Content Loading:** The base content item is loaded, and an initial scene graph is created.
2.  **Prediction and Relevance Scoring:** The AI Prediction Engine analyzes the scene graph and contextual data to predict user intent and assign relevance scores to different content elements.
3.  **Scene Graph Modification:** Based on the predictions and relevance scores, the SGM instructs plug-ins to modify the scene graph.  For example:
    *   If the AI predicts the user is interested in a specific topic, a plug-in might add a related information panel to the scene graph.
    *   If the user is struggling to understand a concept, a plug-in might add an explanatory animation.
    *   If the user is likely to click on a button, a plug-in might highlight the button to draw attention.
4.  **Rendering:** The modified scene graph is rendered to the display.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** User interactions are fed back into the AI Prediction Engine to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode – SGM `modifySceneGraph` function:**

```
function modifySceneGraph(sceneGraph, modifications):
  // Validate modifications
  if not validateModifications(modifications, sceneGraph):
    return false

  // Apply modifications
  applyModifications(sceneGraph, modifications)

  // Notify observers
  notifyObservers(sceneGraph)

  return true
```

**Novelty:**

Existing plug-in systems primarily focus on rendering or filtering existing content. This system shifts the focus to *proactive content creation and adaptation* driven by AI prediction. It doesn’t just *respond* to user interaction, it *anticipates* it and tailors the content accordingly.  The system moves beyond simple layering, and into a dynamically re-authored content experience.  It’s not just ‘what you see is what you get,’ but ‘what you *will* see is proactively generated.’
