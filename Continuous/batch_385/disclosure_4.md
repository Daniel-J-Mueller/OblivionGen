## Haptic Mapping & Environmental Sonification System

**Concept:** A system leveraging localized vibration patterns to create a dynamic, haptic “map” of a user's surroundings, combined with environmental sonification to provide a richer sensory experience, particularly beneficial for navigation and spatial awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Type:** Wearable – vest, belt, or modular attachment system.
*   **Vibration Actuators:** Array of miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) – approximately 64-128, distributed across the wearable's surface.  Each LRA is individually addressable. Frequency response: 20Hz - 500Hz. Amplitude control: 0-100%.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **360° Lidar:**  Short-range (0.5m - 10m) lidar for real-time environmental mapping. Update rate: 10Hz.
    *   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):**  For tracking user orientation and movement.  Update rate: 50Hz.
    *   **Microphone Array:**  Directional microphones for sound source localization and ambient sound analysis.
*   **Processor:** Embedded system-on-chip (SoC) with dedicated signal processing capabilities. Minimum specs: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72, 8GB RAM, 64GB storage.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable battery – minimum 8-hour operation. Wireless charging support.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 802.11ac.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Mapping Algorithm:**  Real-time point cloud processing to create a 3D map of the environment.
    *   **Haptic Translation Engine:**  Algorithm to translate environmental features into vibration patterns.  Key features:
        *   **Proximity Mapping:**  Objects closer to the user generate stronger and more localized vibrations. Vibration frequency corresponds to object distance (higher frequency = closer).
        *   **Object Identification:**  Utilizes machine learning to identify common objects (walls, doorways, furniture, people) based on lidar data. Unique vibration patterns assigned to each object type.
        *   **Directional Indication:**  Vibration intensity and pattern shift across the wearable's surface to indicate object direction.
    *   **Environmental Sonification Engine:**  Algorithm to convert environmental data into auditory cues.
        *   **Object-Based Sonification:**  Assigns unique sounds to identified objects.
        *   **Spatial Audio:**  Utilizes head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a realistic 3D soundscape.
        *   **Ambient Sound Enhancement:**  Amplifies and filters relevant ambient sounds to improve spatial awareness.
*   **User Interface:** Mobile app for customization and configuration:
    *   Vibration pattern customization.
    *   Sound selection and volume control.
    *   Calibration and sensitivity adjustment.
    *   Object identification training.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Translation Engine - Object Identification):**

```
function translate_object(object_data):
  object_type = identify_object(object_data) // ML model classification

  if object_type == "wall":
    vibration_pattern = "static_pulse"
    frequency = 100 Hz
    intensity = 80%
  elif object_type == "doorway":
    vibration_pattern = "sweep" // Frequency sweep across actuators
    frequency = 150-200 Hz
    intensity = 60%
  elif object_type == "person":
    vibration_pattern = "modulated_pulse" // Pulsating vibration with variable frequency
    frequency = 250 Hz
    intensity = 70%
  else:
    vibration_pattern = "generic_pulse"
    frequency = 120 Hz
    intensity = 50%

  apply_vibration_pattern(vibration_pattern, frequency, intensity)
```

**Refinement:** Integration with augmented reality (AR) headsets to provide a combined visual and haptic experience. Potential applications include navigation for visually impaired individuals, enhanced situational awareness for first responders, and immersive gaming experiences.
