## Modular Environmental Control System

**Concept:** Expand the voice-enabled modular device concept into a localized environmental control system. Instead of simply acting as a voice interface to *other* devices, the modular system *becomes* the environmental controller, integrating sensing, actuation, and localized processing.

**Core Components:**

*   **Base Unit (Wall-Mounted):** Contains primary power regulation, wireless communication (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee), and a primary processor. Houses core authentication/security hardware. Includes multiple power output modules (configurable voltages).
*   **Modular ‘Petals’:** Detachable modules that connect magnetically/mechanically to the base unit. Each petal handles a specific environmental function.
*   **Sensor Petals:** Modules containing sensors (Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality (CO2, VOCs, PM2.5), Light Level, Sound Level, Motion).
*   **Actuator Petals:** Modules containing actuators (Miniature HVAC unit, Humidifier/Dehumidifier, Air Purifier (HEPA filter), Smart Blinds Control, Sound Dampening/Noise Generation).
*   **Display/Interface Petal:** A petal with a small touchscreen display for local control and status visualization.
*   **Audio Petal:** High quality audio output for localized soundscapes/alerts.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Voice Control:** Users issue voice commands ("Base unit, lower temperature two degrees", "Air quality petal, report current readings", "Audio petal, play relaxing sounds").
2.  **Localized Processing:** The base unit's processor handles initial voice processing. Detailed analysis can be offloaded to remote servers, but core functions (e.g., temperature adjustments) are handled locally for responsiveness.
3.  **Modular Scalability:** Users can add/remove petals based on needs. A starter kit might include a temperature/humidity sensor/actuator and a display petal.
4.  **Zoning:** Multiple base units can be networked to create zoned environmental control throughout a home/office.
5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system learns user preferences and automatically adjusts environmental settings.

**Pseudocode (Base Unit – Handling Voice Command):**

```
function handleVoiceCommand(speechInput):
    audioData = generateAudioData(speechInput)
    commandData = sendToRemoteSpeechProcessing(audioData) //Get Intent & Parameters
    intent = commandData.intent
    parameters = commandData.parameters

    if intent == "adjust_temperature":
        targetTemperature = parameters.temperature
        currentTemperature = readTemperatureFromSensor()
        adjustHVAC(targetTemperature) //Controls the HVAC actuator petal

    elif intent == "report_air_quality":
        airQualityData = readAirQualityFromSensor()
        speakAirQualityReport(airQualityData)

    elif intent == "play_soundscape":
        soundscape = parameters.soundscape
        playAudioOnAudioPetal(soundscape)

    else:
        speak("I did not understand your command.")

function readTemperatureFromSensor():
    //Communicates with temperature sensor petal via a defined protocol
    //Returns current temperature reading.

function adjustHVAC(targetTemperature):
    //Controls HVAC actuator petal to adjust temperature.
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Power Delivery:** Robust power delivery system to support multiple petals with varying voltage/current requirements.
*   **Communication Protocol:** High-speed, reliable communication protocol between the base unit and petals (e.g., custom serial protocol over USB-C, or a dedicated wireless protocol).
*   **Magnetic/Mechanical Connection:** Secure and reliable connection mechanism for petals.
*   **Authentication/Security:** Secure authentication between the base unit and petals, and with remote services. Hardware-based security module for key storage.
