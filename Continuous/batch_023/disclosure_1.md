**Distributed Sensory Network for Predictive Spatial Awareness**

**Core Concept:** Expand the multi-device data correlation beyond reactive event stitching (as implied by the provided patent) to create a proactive, predictive system capable of anticipating events *before* they are fully captured by any single device. This shifts the focus from retrospective analysis to preemptive alerting and contextual augmentation.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Node Types:**
    *   **Primary Nodes:** Existing A/V devices (cameras, microphones) as data sources.
    *   **Secondary Nodes:** Low-power, spatially distributed sensors (accelerometers, magnetometers, light sensors, simple gas sensors). These don’t *record* – they report change/deviation from baseline. Think IoT-scale deployment.
    *   **Edge Processing Units (EPUs):** Local hubs (Raspberry Pi class) responsible for pre-processing data from nearby nodes, initial correlation, and transmission to the central server.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Low-latency, mesh-networked protocol (e.g., Thread, Zigbee) for secondary node communication to EPUs. WiFi/5G/Ethernet for EPU to central server.
*   **Data Model:** Time-series data streams with spatial metadata (node location). Emphasis on *change* detection, not absolute values. Raw data is rarely transmitted; differentials are prioritized.
*   **Predictive Engine:** Central server-based AI/ML model trained on historical data and real-time sensor feeds. Uses Bayesian networks or recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict potential events based on correlated sensor anomalies.
*   **Alerting System:** Multi-tiered alerting.
    *   **Level 1 (Early Warning):** Sensor anomalies detected; predictive model flags low-probability event. System begins pre-buffering data from relevant A/V devices.
    *   **Level 2 (Probable Event):** Predictive model confidence increases; system activates A/V device recording. Focuses camera angles based on predicted trajectory.
    *   **Level 3 (Confirmed Event):** Event detected by A/V devices. System stitches footage and provides context (predicted event, sensor triggers).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Engine – Simplified):**

```
function predictEvent(sensorData, historicalData) {
  // Calculate deviation from baseline for each sensor
  deviations = calculateDeviations(sensorData, historicalData);

  // Weight deviations based on sensor type and location
  weightedDeviations = weightDeviations(deviations);

  // Input weighted deviations into trained model (Bayesian Network / RNN)
  probability = model.predict(weightedDeviations);

  // If probability exceeds threshold, trigger pre-buffering and alerting
  if (probability > threshold) {
    triggerPreBuffering();
    sendAlert();
  }
  return probability;
}

function calculateDeviations(sensorData, historicalData) {
  // ... implementation details for calculating deviations ...
}

function weightDeviations(deviations) {
  // ... implementation details for weighting deviations ...
}

function triggerPreBuffering() {
  // ... implementation details for triggering pre-buffering on relevant A/V devices ...
}

function sendAlert() {
  // ... implementation details for sending alerts to user/system ...
}
```

**Novelty:** This system is not merely *reacting* to events; it's *anticipating* them. The distributed sensor network provides a layer of "peripheral vision" that extends beyond the range of traditional A/V devices, allowing for earlier detection and more comprehensive contextual awareness. The predictive engine transforms raw sensor data into actionable intelligence, enhancing security, safety, and efficiency. This goes beyond event stitching, and towards a proactive system that doesn't need an event to occur to become aware.
