## Adaptive Thread Weighting for Dynamic Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the multi-threaded testing framework to dynamically adjust the 'weight' or computational load assigned to each testing thread based on real-time performance feedback. This allows for a more efficient and responsive testing process, particularly when dealing with applications exhibiting uneven load distribution or performance bottlenecks.

**Specifications:**

**1. Thread Weight Data Structure:**

```
ThreadWeight {
  threadID: Integer;       // Unique identifier for the testing thread.
  baseWeight: Float;       // Initial computational load assigned to the thread.
  currentWeight: Float;    // Dynamically adjusted weight.
  performanceMetric: Float; // Recent performance metric (e.g., execution time, resource usage).
  adjustmentRate: Float;   // Rate at which the weight is adjusted.
  minWeight: Float;        // Minimum allowable weight.
  maxWeight: Float;        // Maximum allowable weight.
}
```

**2. Weight Adjustment Algorithm (executed by a central 'Weight Manager' process):**

```pseudocode
function adjustWeights(threadWeights[], performanceThreshold):
  for each threadWeight in threadWeights:
    if threadWeight.performanceMetric > performanceThreshold:
      // Thread is underperforming – reduce weight
      adjustment = (threadWeight.currentWeight - threadWeight.minWeight) * threadWeight.adjustmentRate
      threadWeight.currentWeight = max(threadWeight.minWeight, threadWeight.currentWeight - adjustment)
    else:
      // Thread is performing well – increase weight
      adjustment = (threadWeight.maxWeight - threadWeight.currentWeight) * threadWeight.adjustmentRate
      threadWeight.currentWeight = min(threadWeight.maxWeight, threadWeight.currentWeight + adjustment)
end function
```

**3. Test Dispatcher Integration:**

*   The Test Dispatcher assigns tasks to threads based on their *currentWeight*.  Higher-weighted threads receive a proportionally larger share of tasks.
*   The dispatcher needs to communicate with the Weight Manager to retrieve up-to-date thread weights before assigning tasks.

**4. Performance Metric Collection:**

*   Each testing thread periodically reports a performance metric (e.g., average execution time of recent tasks, CPU/memory usage) to the Weight Manager.
*   The Weight Manager uses these metrics to calculate the overall performance of each thread.

**5. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `baseWeight`:  Initial weight assigned to each thread.
*   `adjustmentRate`: Controls the speed at which weights are adjusted.
*   `performanceThreshold`:  The threshold above which a thread is considered underperforming.
*   `minWeight` & `maxWeight`:  Limits the range of weight adjustments.



**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Weight Manager could be implemented as a separate process or as a module within the Test Runner.
*   The performance metric used for weight adjustment should be carefully chosen based on the characteristics of the application being tested.
*   The adjustment rate should be tuned to avoid oscillations or instability in the weight adjustments.
*   Consider implementing a 'cooldown' period after a weight adjustment to prevent rapid fluctuations.
*   A visualization component showing the current weights of each thread could be helpful for debugging and tuning.
