## Decentralized Data Provenance & Attestation Layer

**Concept:** Extend the multi-entity verification framework into a continuous, auditable, and decentralized data provenance and attestation layer. Instead of solely focusing on deletion verification, this layer tracks *all* modifications to data across multiple storage locations, providing an immutable record of data lineage and integrity.

**Motivation:** Current systems verify data *at a single point* (deletion). This design moves towards continuous verification and provides a broader audit trail for compliance, debugging, and trust-building. Leveraging decentralized technology allows for greater transparency and resilience against manipulation.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Data Sharding & Replication:** Original data is sharded and replicated across multiple geographically diverse "Guardian Nodes". These nodes aren't necessarily owned by a single entity; they form a distributed network. Each shard is assigned a unique cryptographic hash.

2.  **Modification Tracking:** Any modification to data (create, read, update, delete) triggers a "Provenance Event". Each event is a digitally signed record containing:
    *   Timestamp
    *   Shard ID(s) affected
    *   Type of modification (CRUD)
    *   Data diff (minimal change set)
    *   Signing entity ID
    *   Previous data hash
    *   New data hash

3.  **Blockchain Integration:** Provenance Events are aggregated into "Provenance Blocks" and appended to a permissioned blockchain. This provides immutability and tamper-resistance. Consensus is achieved using a Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm to ensure resilience against malicious actors.

4.  **Attestation Layer:** Guardian Nodes operate as "Attestors". After each modification, Attestors independently verify the consistency of the data across replicas based on the Provenance Events recorded on the blockchain. They digitally sign an "Attestation Record" confirming data integrity. A majority of Attestations are required to validate a modification.

5.  **Data Reconstruction & Verification:**  Any entity can reconstruct the complete data history and verify its integrity by:
    *   Querying the blockchain for Provenance Events.
    *   Downloading shards from Guardian Nodes.
    *   Validating Attestation Records.
    *   Reconstructing data and comparing hashes to confirm consistency.

**Pseudocode (Attestation Process):**

```
function attest(provenanceEvent, shardData):
  // 1. Verify signature on provenanceEvent
  if not verifySignature(provenanceEvent):
    return false

  // 2. Fetch relevant shard from storage
  shard = getShard(provenanceEvent.shardId)

  // 3. Calculate hash of current shard data
  currentHash = calculateHash(shard)

  // 4. Compare currentHash with hash recorded in provenanceEvent
  if currentHash != provenanceEvent.newHash:
    return false

  // 5. Sign attestation record
  attestationRecord = {
    provenanceEventId: provenanceEvent.id,
    attestorId: myId,
    timestamp: currentTime,
    signature: sign(attestationRecord)
  }

  // 6. Broadcast attestationRecord to network
  broadcast(attestationRecord)

  return true
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Guardian Nodes:** High-availability storage servers with secure enclaves.
*   **Blockchain:** Permissioned blockchain platform (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda).
*   **Attestation Service:** Distributed service for collecting and verifying Attestation Records.
*   **API:** REST API for querying data history and verifying integrity.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Supply Chain Management:** Track the provenance of goods and materials.
*   **Healthcare:** Secure patient records and ensure data integrity.
*   **Financial Services:** Audit trails for transactions and regulatory compliance.
*   **IoT:** Secure data from connected devices and prevent tampering.
