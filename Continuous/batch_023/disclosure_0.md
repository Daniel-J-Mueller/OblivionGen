## Dynamic Mesh Deformation for Realistic Eyewear Fit

**Concept:** Enhance the realism of virtual eyewear fitting by dynamically deforming the user's face mesh *around* the eyewear during the positioning phase, rather than relying solely on collider collisions. This creates a more natural and snug fit, particularly around the nose bridge and temples.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** 3D model of eyewear, 3D mesh model of user’s face, initial eyewear position (as determined by midpoint between eyes, as described in the provided patent).
*   **Data Structure:** Facial Landmark Map – A pre-computed map linking vertices on the face mesh to key facial landmarks (eyes, nose, temples, cheeks). This allows for targeted mesh manipulation.
*   **Deformation Algorithm:**
    *   **Proximity Detection:** For each vertex on the eyewear model, identify nearby vertices on the user’s face mesh within a defined radius.
    *   **Influence Field:** Calculate an “influence field” for each eyewear vertex. This field determines the degree to which nearby face vertices will be deformed.  The influence decreases with distance – inverse square law is recommended.
    *   **Vertex Displacement:** Displace the identified face vertices *towards* the eyewear vertex, based on the influence field strength. Limit the maximum displacement to prevent unrealistic distortions.
    *   **Smoothing:** Apply a Laplacian smoothing filter to the deformed face mesh to maintain a natural appearance.
*   **Collision Refinement:** After mesh deformation, perform final collider collision checks to ensure no clipping. Adjust eyewear position slightly if necessary.
*   **Anchor/Tracking:** Once anchored, continue to subtly deform the face mesh around the eyewear as the user’s head/face moves to maintain a consistent fit during animation/video conferencing.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function deformFaceMesh(eyewearMesh, faceMesh, influenceRadius, maxDisplacement):

    for each eyewearVertex in eyewearMesh:
        nearbyFaceVertices = findNearbyVertices(faceMesh, eyewearVertex, influenceRadius)

        for each faceVertex in nearbyFaceVertices:
            distance = calculateDistance(eyewearVertex, faceVertex)
            influence = 1.0 / (distance * distance) // Inverse square law

            displacementVector = normalize(vector from faceVertex to eyewearVertex) * influence * maxDisplacement
            faceVertex.position += displacementVector

    applyLaplacianSmoothing(faceMesh)

    return faceMesh
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Real-time 3D rendering engine (Unity, Unreal Engine).
*   Facial landmark detection library (e.g., MediaPipe Face Mesh).
*   GPU with sufficient memory for real-time mesh deformation.
*   C++/C# programming language.
