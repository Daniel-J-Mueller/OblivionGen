## Virtual Network “Shadowing” & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network provisioning system to allow a "shadow" virtual network to be created alongside a primary network, actively learning its traffic patterns *before* full provisioning. This allows for significantly more accurate resource allocation and proactive scaling, minimizing latency spikes and maximizing utilization.

**Specifications:**

**I. Shadow Network Creation & Monitoring:**

*   **Trigger:** A user initiates creation of a virtual network as defined in the existing patent. *Simultaneously*, a “shadow” instance is created. This shadow network shares the same configuration parameters (topology, CIDR blocks, intended VM types) but operates with minimal resources – essentially, virtualized monitoring tools.
*   **Traffic Capture:** Implement a non-intrusive packet mirroring/tapping system. All traffic *intended* for the new virtual network (identified by the configured CIDR blocks and configuration details) is duplicated and fed into the shadow network. This capture happens *before* any actual VMs are provisioned.
*   **Emulated VMs:** The shadow network contains lightweight “emulated VMs.” These are not full VMs, but statistical models representing the expected behavior of the VMs based on the configuration. They consume minimal resources but can simulate traffic generation and response based on the captured data.
*   **Performance Metrics Collection:** The shadow network actively collects performance metrics:
    *   Bandwidth usage (in/out, per emulated VM)
    *   Latency (per emulated VM, simulated round-trip times)
    *   Packet loss rates
    *   CPU/Memory utilization (simulated based on traffic patterns)
    *   Connection establishment rates
*   **Data Storage:** Performance metric data is stored in a time-series database (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB).

**II. Predictive Resource Allocation:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network, time-series forecasting model) on the historical performance data collected from the shadow network. This model predicts future resource requirements (CPU, memory, bandwidth) for each VM based on traffic patterns.
*   **Resource Profile Generation:** Based on the ML model’s predictions, generate a detailed resource profile for each VM. This profile specifies the optimal CPU cores, RAM, network bandwidth, and storage requirements.
*   **Automated Provisioning:** When the user activates the virtual network, the system uses the generated resource profiles to automatically provision the VMs with the *pre-calculated* optimal settings.
*   **Dynamic Scaling Adjustment:** Continue monitoring the live network. If actual resource usage deviates significantly from the predictions, the system dynamically adjusts VM resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) to maintain optimal performance.

**III. System Components & Interfaces:**

*   **Traffic Mirroring Module:**  Software module responsible for capturing and duplicating network traffic. Integrates with the existing virtual network infrastructure.
*   **Shadow Network Manager:**  Manages the creation, configuration, and monitoring of shadow networks.
*   **Performance Metrics Collector:**  Collects and stores performance data from the shadow network.
*   **ML Model Trainer:**  Trains and updates the machine learning model.
*   **Resource Profile Generator:**  Generates resource profiles based on the ML model’s predictions.
*   **Automated Provisioning Engine:** Provisions VMs with the generated resource profiles.
*   **API:** Provides programmatic access to the system for integration with existing management tools.



**Pseudocode (Simplified - Resource Profile Generation):**

```python
def generate_resource_profile(emulated_vm_id, historical_data):
  """Generates a resource profile for a VM based on historical data."""

  # Load historical data for the VM
  bandwidth_usage = historical_data["bandwidth_usage"]
  latency = historical_data["latency"]
  cpu_usage = historical_data["cpu_usage"]

  # Apply ML model to predict future resource requirements
  predicted_bandwidth = ml_model.predict_bandwidth(bandwidth_usage)
  predicted_cpu = ml_model.predict_cpu(cpu_usage)
  predicted_memory = ml_model.predict_memory(cpu_usage, bandwidth_usage)

  # Create resource profile
  resource_profile = {
      "cpu_cores": int(predicted_cpu),
      "memory_gb": int(predicted_memory),
      "bandwidth_mbps": int(predicted_bandwidth)
  }

  return resource_profile
```

This system proactively optimizes resource allocation, reducing latency, improving performance, and maximizing resource utilization. It moves beyond reactive scaling to a predictive model.
