## Dynamic Item Morphing based on Bid & User State

**Concept:**  Extend the ranked list bid system by allowing *dynamic alteration of the item itself* displayed to the user, within predefined bounds, based on the bid amount and the *current state* of the user (browsing history, purchase history, location, time of day, device type, etc.).  Essentially, create item ‘morphs’ – variations of the base item – and serve the morph that maximizes projected revenue *and* user engagement given the context.

**Specs:**

1.  **Item Morph Library:**  
    *   Each item in the catalog has a base representation.
    *   Associated with each item is a library of 'morphs'. These morphs can alter:
        *   **Visuals:** Image, video, color scheme, highlighting specific features.
        *   **Text:**  Headline, description, call to action, price display.
        *   **Features:** Displaying different product bundles, variations (size, color), or highlighting promotions.
        *   **Data Enrichment:** Adding or emphasizing review snippets, scarcity indicators ("Only 2 left!"), or personalized recommendations.

2.  **Bid-Driven Morph Selection:**
    *   Bidders can specify not only a cost-per-click but also a ‘morph budget’. This budget represents the maximum allowable ‘cost’ associated with serving a particular morph (e.g., a morph with a high-resolution video costs more to serve than a static image).
    *   The system calculates a ‘projected revenue lift’ for each morph, taking into account the morph budget, projected click-through rate, and conversion rate.

3.  **User State Integration:**
    *   The system maintains a real-time user profile, capturing browsing history, purchase history, location, time of day, device type, and other relevant data.
    *   A ‘contextual relevance score’ is calculated for each morph, based on the user’s profile and the morph's characteristics.

4.  **Morph Selection Algorithm:**
    *   The algorithm selects the morph that maximizes the following function:
        `Projected Revenue = (Bid * Click-Through Rate) + (Conversion Rate * Profit Margin) - Morph Cost + Contextual Relevance Score`
    *   Constraints: Morph Cost must be within the bidder's Morph Budget.

5.  **A/B Testing & Optimization:**
    *   The system automatically A/B tests different morphs to identify the most effective variations for each user segment.
    *   Machine learning algorithms are used to optimize the morph selection process over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function select_item_morph(item, bid, user_state):
  morph_library = get_morph_library(item)
  viable_morphs = []

  for morph in morph_library:
    morph_cost = calculate_morph_cost(morph)
    if morph_cost <= bid.morph_budget:
      viable_morphs.append(morph)

  if not viable_morphs:
    return item.base_representation  # No viable morphs, use base

  best_morph = None
  max_projected_revenue = -1

  for morph in viable_morphs:
    projected_click_rate = calculate_projected_click_rate(morph, user_state)
    projected_conversion_rate = calculate_projected_conversion_rate(morph, user_state)
    contextual_relevance = calculate_contextual_relevance(morph, user_state)

    projected_revenue = (bid.cost_per_click * projected_click_rate) + \
                       (projected_conversion_rate * item.profit_margin) - \
                       morph_cost + contextual_relevance

    if projected_revenue > max_projected_revenue:
      max_projected_revenue = projected_revenue
      best_morph = morph

  return best_morph
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Item`: Contains base representation, profit margin.
*   `Bid`: Contains cost per click, morph budget.
*   `Morph`: Contains variations of visuals, text, features.
*   `User_State`: Contains browsing history, purchase history, location, etc.
