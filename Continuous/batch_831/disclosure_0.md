## Autonomous Device Acoustic Mapping & Projection

**Concept:** Expand the directional audio capabilities of the device beyond simple beamforming to create a localized, dynamic acoustic map of the environment, and then project synthesized audio *into* that map. This goes beyond simply *receiving* sound directionally; it allows the device to *become* a localized sound source, shaping audio in 3D space.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Additions:**

*   **High-Density Microphone Array:** Increase the microphone array density significantly – aim for a spherical arrangement with >100 microphones. Miniaturization is key; MEMS microphone arrays are preferred.
*   **Haptic Transducers:** Integrate small, high-frequency haptic transducers into the autonomously motile device’s chassis. These will be used for short-range acoustic modulation (see section 3).
*   **Dedicated DSP/FPGA:**  A powerful, low-latency DSP or FPGA is required to handle the real-time processing demands of acoustic mapping, synthesis, and projection.
*   **Miniature Speaker Array:** A compact array of high-quality miniature speakers distributed around the device's surface. These speakers *do not* emit conventional audio; instead, they are used to subtly modulate the environment based on calculated acoustic pressures.

**2. Software Architecture – Acoustic Mapping Module:**

*   **Real-Time Acoustic Scene Analysis:**  The DSP/FPGA continuously analyzes audio captured by the microphone array. This goes beyond basic beamforming. Utilize advanced signal processing techniques (e.g., time-difference of arrival, frequency-domain decomposition) to create a 3D acoustic map of the surrounding environment.  Represent the map as a volumetric grid, where each cell contains information about sound pressure level, frequency content, and estimated source direction.
*   **Dynamic Map Updating:** The acoustic map must be dynamically updated in real-time to account for moving sound sources, changing room acoustics, and device motion.  Implement a Kalman filter or similar state estimation technique to smooth the map and reduce noise.
*   **Acoustic Material Identification:**  Develop algorithms to identify the acoustic properties of surfaces within the map (e.g., hard, soft, absorbent).  This can be done by analyzing the reflections and reverberations captured by the microphone array.

**3. Software Architecture – Acoustic Projection Module:**

*   **Synthesized Sound Source Generation:**  The system will generate virtual sound sources at specific locations within the acoustic map. These sound sources can be simple tones, complex sounds, or even synthesized speech.
*   **Pressure Wave Modulation:**  Instead of emitting sounds directly, the system will *modulate* the existing acoustic pressure waves in the environment. The miniature speaker array and haptic transducers will be used to create constructive and destructive interference patterns.  This allows the system to "shape" the sound field and create the illusion of sounds emanating from virtual sources.
*   **Phase Coherence Control:** Precise control over the phase of the emitted waves is crucial for achieving the desired interference patterns. Implement a phase-locked loop (PLL) or similar technique to ensure that the waves are coherent.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Utilize the haptic transducers to generate localized vibrations that reinforce the perception of virtual sound sources. This is particularly useful for creating immersive experiences in close proximity to the device.

**4. Pseudocode (Acoustic Projection):**

```
// Input:  3D Acoustic Map, Virtual Sound Source Location, Desired Sound Data
// Output: Modulation Signals for Speakers and Haptic Transducers

function projectSound(acousticMap, sourceLocation, soundData) {

  // Calculate the path from each speaker/transducer to the sourceLocation
  paths = calculatePaths(acousticMap, sourceLocation)

  // Calculate the phase delay for each speaker/transducer
  phaseDelays = calculatePhaseDelays(paths, soundData)

  // Generate modulation signals based on phase delays and sound data
  modulationSignals = generateModulationSignals(phaseDelays, soundData)

  // Output modulation signals to speakers and haptic transducers
  outputSignals(modulationSignals)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Localized Notifications:** Deliver notifications directly to the user's ears without disturbing others.
*   **Immersive Audio Experiences:** Create realistic and immersive audio environments for gaming, virtual reality, and augmented reality.
*   **Acoustic Camouflage:** Mask the device's own sounds or create the illusion that sounds are coming from a different location.
*   **Assistive Technology:**  Enhance hearing for individuals with hearing impairments by selectively amplifying sounds from specific directions.
