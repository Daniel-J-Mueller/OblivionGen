## Adaptive Sparsity via Dynamic Re-Mapping

**Concept:** Leverage the gating mechanisms described in the patent to dynamically remap neural network layers onto available hardware resources (clusters/cores) *during* inference, achieving adaptive sparsity and maximizing hardware utilization.  Instead of statically identifying unused elements, the system actively shifts computation to available resources as layers progress, essentially “packing” active computations into the smallest possible hardware footprint.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Hardware Profiling Module:** Continuously monitors cluster/core utilization during inference.  Reports available capacity in terms of dot product operations per clock cycle. This isn't a simple 'busy' flag, but granular capacity reporting.

2.  **Layer Dependency Graph:** A pre-calculated graph showing dependencies between layers.  This is *not* about scheduling, but understanding which layers *could* potentially be shifted without impacting correctness. It identifies layers with minimal inter-layer data flow requirements.

3.  **Dynamic Remapping Engine:**  The core of the innovation.  Receives layer dependency information and hardware profiling data.  Uses a cost function to evaluate the benefits of shifting a layer’s computation to different clusters.

    *   **Cost Function:**  Prioritizes minimizing the number of active clusters while factoring in data transfer costs between clusters.  It also penalizes frequent shifting to prevent thrashing (constant re-mapping).  Key variables:
        *   `ActiveClusters`: Number of clusters currently in use.
        *   `DataTransferCost(Layer, SourceCluster, TargetCluster)`:  Estimates the energy/time cost of moving activations/weights.
        *   `ShiftingPenalty`:  A fixed cost for each layer shift.
    *   **Remapping Algorithm:** A greedy algorithm that iteratively evaluates potential shifts.  For each layer, it checks if shifting to an available cluster reduces the cost function. If so, the shift is performed.

4.  **Fine-Grained Gating Control:**  The gating mechanisms from the patent are used to enable/disable dot product cores *within* clusters. This allows for further granularity in resource allocation. Gating is done at both the cluster and core levels.

5.  **Activation/Weight Re-Routing:** When a layer is shifted, the system must update the routing of activations and weights.  This can be implemented using a crossbar switch or a similar mechanism.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Remapping Engine):**

```pseudocode
function RemapLayers(layerSequence, hardwareProfile):
  activeClusters = {}  // Initialize set of active clusters
  for layer in layerSequence:
    bestCluster = null
    lowestCost = Infinity

    for cluster in hardwareProfile.availableClusters:
      cost = CalculateRemappingCost(layer, cluster, activeClusters)
      if cost < lowestCost:
        lowestCost = cost
        bestCluster = cluster

    if bestCluster != currentCluster(layer):
      ShiftLayer(layer, bestCluster)
      ActivateCluster(bestCluster)
      DeactivateCluster(currentCluster(layer))
      UpdateLayerMapping(layer, bestCluster)
    
    PerformInference(layer)

function CalculateRemappingCost(layer, targetCluster, activeClusters):
  dataTransferCost = DataTransferCost(layer, currentCluster(layer), targetCluster)
  shiftingPenalty = ShiftingPenalty()
  totalCost = dataTransferCost + shiftingPenalty
  return totalCost

```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Power Consumption:** By minimizing the number of active clusters, power consumption can be significantly reduced.
*   **Increased Hardware Utilization:** The system can efficiently utilize available hardware resources, leading to improved performance.
*   **Adaptability:** The system can adapt to different neural network architectures and workloads.
*   **Scalability:** The system can be scaled to larger neural networks and hardware platforms.
