## Dynamic Sensory Tagging & Playback

**Concept:** Extend location & content tagging to incorporate *real-time* sensory data – ambient sound, temperature, humidity, light levels – captured *at the point of content access*. This data then becomes part of the ‘tag’ and is replayed during subsequent access, creating a heightened sense of ‘being there’.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensory Capture Module (integrated into device - ebook reader, phone, etc.):**

*   **Sensors:** Microphone (ambient sound), Temperature Sensor, Humidity Sensor, Light Sensor.  All sensors must have a sampling rate of at least 10Hz.
*   **Data Format:** Sensory data will be encoded into a compressed audio/visual ‘sensory packet’.  Audio will utilize a lossy compression algorithm (e.g., Opus) with variable bitrate (16-64kbps). Visual data (light levels converted to color temperature representation) will be encoded as a low-resolution (64x64) image.
*   **Trigger:** Sensory capture is initiated *concurrently* with location tagging (as defined in the original patent) whenever a user accesses a portion of content.  A minimum capture duration of 5 seconds is required.

**2. Tagging & Storage Module:**

*   **Tag Structure:**  Tags will now include:
    *   Content ID (book/audio/video file).
    *   Content Portion ID (paragraph, page, timestamp within audio/video).
    *   Location Data (latitude/longitude).
    *   Timestamp.
    *   Sensory Packet (compressed audio/visual data).
    *   User Rating/Comment (optional, existing functionality).
*   **Database:** The database structure must accommodate the expanded tag size.  A NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) is recommended for scalability and flexible schema.

**3. Playback Module:**

*   **Trigger:** Playback is initiated when a user accesses content with associated sensory tags at a location that matches (within a configurable radius - e.g., 10 meters) the original tagging location.
*   **Sensory Reconstitution:**  The sensory packet is decoded and outputted through the device’s speakers/display.
    *   Audio: Playback of ambient sounds recorded during the original access.
    *   Visual:  Display of the ambient light level as a subtle background color overlay on the content. (e.g., warmer tones for sunlight, cooler tones for indoor lighting).
*   **Blending/Volume Control:**  Provide user controls for adjusting the volume of the ambient audio and the intensity of the visual overlay.

**4.  Advanced Features (optional):**

*   **Sensory Mixing:** If multiple sensory tags exist for the same content portion at different locations, allow the system to *blend* the sensory data (e.g., average audio levels, combine light colors).
*   **Dynamic Location Awareness:** Implement a "wander mode" where sensory playback dynamically adjusts based on the user's *movement* within the tagged location (e.g., slight audio panning to simulate sound direction).
*   **Personalized Sensory Profiles:**  Allow users to create personalized profiles defining preferred sensory intensities and blending preferences.

**Pseudocode (Playback Module):**

```
FUNCTION playbackSensoryTag(contentID, contentPortionID, currentLocation):

    tag = GET_TAG(contentID, contentPortionID, currentLocation)

    IF tag != NULL:

        IF tag.locationRadius(currentLocation) < thresholdRadius:

            DECODE(tag.sensoryPacket)

            PLAY_AUDIO(decodedAudio)
            DISPLAY_COLOR(decodedLightColor)

            RETURN TRUE
        ELSE:
            RETURN FALSE
    ELSE:
        RETURN FALSE
