## Dynamic Event Data Weaving with Temporal Anchors

**Concept:** Extend the patent's event data processing by introducing "Temporal Anchors" – designated timestamps within record data that trigger specific, pre-defined data weaving operations. This allows for contextual enrichment of event data *after* initial parsing, based on time-relative conditions.  Think of it like a programmable delay and alteration of data streams based on when events occur *relative to other events*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Anchor Definition Module:**

*   **Input:** Record data stream, User-defined Temporal Anchor specifications (JSON/YAML).
*   **Output:** Modified record data stream with embedded Temporal Anchor tags.
*   **Functionality:**  The module scans incoming record data, identifying fields designated as Temporal Anchor candidates.  It then embeds metadata tags, indicating anchor points and associated configuration data (delay duration, weaving operation ID).
*   **Configuration Data (Example):**
    ```json
    {
      "anchor_field": "timestamp",
      "delay_seconds": 5,
      "weave_operation": "enrich_with_geo",
      "condition": "activity_type == 'login'"
    }
    ```

**2.  Temporal Weaving Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Modified record data stream (with Temporal Anchor tags).
*   **Output:**  Enriched event data stream.
*   **Functionality:** This is the core processing unit. It maintains a time-based queue of incoming events.
    *   **Anchor Detection:**  When an event with a Temporal Anchor tag is received, the engine schedules a "weave operation" to be executed after the specified delay.
    *   **Weave Operation Execution:** The engine executes the scheduled weave operation. This can include:
        *   **Data Enrichment:** Fetching related data from external sources (geo-location, user profile, device information) and adding it to the event data.
        *   **Data Transformation:**  Applying pre-defined rules to modify the event data (e.g., masking sensitive information, aggregating values).
        *   **Conditional Logic:**  Executing different weave operations based on the event data's content.
        *   **Event Correlation:**  Linking multiple events based on temporal proximity and content similarity.

**3. Weave Operation Library:**

*   A repository of pre-defined weave operations.  This allows for easy reuse and sharing of data enrichment logic.  Operations are defined as modular, pluggable components.
*   **Operation Example (enrich_with_geo):**
    *   **Input:** Event data (containing IP address).
    *   **Output:** Event data (with added geolocation coordinates – latitude, longitude).
    *   **Implementation:**  Use a geo-IP lookup service to resolve the IP address to geographic coordinates.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Weaving Engine):**

```
// Initialize time-based queue (priority queue sorted by execution time)
queue = PriorityQueue()

// Main loop
while (event = receiveEvent()) {
    // Check for Temporal Anchor tag
    if (event.hasAnchorTag()) {
        // Calculate execution time
        executionTime = event.timestamp + event.anchorTag.delay
        // Schedule weave operation
        weaveOperation = createWeaveOperation(event, event.anchorTag.weaveOperation)
        queue.add(weaveOperation, executionTime)
    }

    // Process events that are ready
    while (queue.hasNext() && queue.peek().executionTime <= currentTime) {
        weaveOperation = queue.poll()
        weaveOperation.execute()
        outputEvent = weaveOperation.outputEvent
        sendEvent(outputEvent)
    }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AnchorTag`:  `{delay: integer, weaveOperation: string}`
*   `WeaveOperation`: `{event: EventData, operationType: string, outputEvent: EventData}`

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Fraud Detection:** Correlate login attempts with geolocation data to identify suspicious activity.
*   **Personalized Marketing:** Enrich user profiles with behavioral data to deliver targeted advertisements.
*   **Security Monitoring:**  Combine event logs from different sources to detect and respond to security threats.
*   **Real-time Analytics:** Dynamically adjust data processing pipelines based on changing business requirements.
