## Adaptive Key Rotation based on Entropy of Data

**Specification:** Implement a key rotation system where the frequency of key rotation isn't solely determined by a stochastic process *or* a fixed counter, but is dynamically adjusted based on the entropy of the data being encrypted. Higher entropy data triggers more frequent key rotations, while lower entropy data allows for less frequent rotations.

**Rationale:**  Standard key rotation assumes a consistent threat model.  However, the *information itself* carries inherent risk. High-entropy data (e.g., randomly generated session keys, highly sensitive personal data) represents a greater breach risk if a key is compromised.  Lower entropy data (e.g., repetitive user inputs, standardized report fields) poses a comparatively lower risk.  Adapting the rotation frequency based on entropy provides a layered security approach.

**Components:**

1.  **Entropy Analysis Module:**  This module resides *before* encryption. It receives the plaintext data as input and calculates its entropy.  Shannon entropy is preferred, but other entropy measures (e.g., approximate entropy) could be used. The output is an entropy score (normalized between 0 and 1, where 1 represents maximum entropy).

2.  **Key Rotation Policy Engine:** This module takes the entropy score as input and consults a pre-defined policy table to determine the key rotation interval.  

    *   **Policy Table Example:**

        | Entropy Score Range | Key Rotation Interval (seconds) |
        |-----------------------|---------------------------------|
        | 0.0 – 0.3            | 3600 (1 hour)                   |
        | 0.3 – 0.6            | 600 (10 minutes)                 |
        | 0.6 – 0.9            | 60 (1 minute)                    |
        | 0.9 – 1.0            | 5 (5 seconds)                    |

3.  **Stochastic Rotation Modulator:** This module is retained from the existing patent, but its output is *modulated* by the Key Rotation Policy Engine. The stochastic process generates a baseline rotation probability. This probability is then *scaled* based on the interval determined by the Key Rotation Policy Engine.  Essentially, the stochastic process provides a random 'jitter' to the determined interval, preventing predictable rotation patterns.

4.  **Key Management System:** A standard KMS is required to generate, store, and rotate cryptographic keys. The KMS interfaces with the other modules.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation Process):**

```
function RotateKey(plaintext):
    entropy = CalculateEntropy(plaintext)
    interval = GetRotationInterval(entropy) // Lookup in policy table
    stochastic_jitter = GenerateStochasticValue() // From existing patent
    effective_interval = interval * (1 + stochastic_jitter) // Modulate interval

    //Wait 'effective_interval' seconds or until next encryption request.
    
    new_key = GenerateNewKey()
    ReplaceCurrentKey(new_key)
    Return new_key
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The entropy calculation adds computational overhead.  Optimize the entropy analysis module for performance.
*   The policy table can be dynamically adjusted based on security requirements and observed data patterns.
*   Consider using a tiered approach, where different entropy levels trigger different key rotation policies for different data classifications.  (e.g., high-sensitivity data always uses short rotation intervals, regardless of entropy.)
*   Ensure proper synchronization between the entropy analysis module, the key rotation policy engine, and the key management system.
