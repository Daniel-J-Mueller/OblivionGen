## Dynamic Meta-Surface Projection

**Concept:** Augment the structured light system with a dynamically reconfigurable meta-surface integrated directly into the projector. This meta-surface won't just modulate light intensity (like an LCD), but *shape* the wavefront, allowing for arbitrary beam steering and pattern projection *without* mechanical movement or complex software calculations.

**Specs:**

*   **Meta-Surface Material:** Liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) array, or similar tunable meta-material.  Each ‘pixel’ of the meta-surface will consist of micro-structures capable of changing their refractive index under applied voltage.
*   **Resolution:** 512x512 meta-surface elements.  Each element will be approximately 50um x 50um in size.
*   **Control System:**  High-speed FPGA-based controller with dedicated drivers for each meta-surface element.  Controller will interface with the main processor via PCIe.
*   **Wavefront Shaping Algorithm:** Utilize a Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, or similar iterative phase retrieval method, to calculate the required meta-surface configuration for a desired light pattern. This will run on the FPGA to provide real-time adjustments.
*   **Integration:** Meta-surface integrated *directly* into the projector's light path, replacing or supplementing the existing LCD panel.
*   **Calibration:** Implement an automated calibration routine to account for manufacturing tolerances and environmental factors.  This will use a known reference target and a camera to optimize the meta-surface configuration.
*   **Data Pipeline:**
    1.  Main processor sends desired 3D point cloud or feature map to FPGA.
    2.  FPGA calculates required wavefront for each meta-surface element.
    3.  FPGA drives voltage to each element to achieve desired refractive index.
    4.  Projector emits shaped light beam.

**Pseudocode (FPGA):**

```
// Input: 3D Point Cloud (or feature map)
// Output: Voltage to each meta-surface element

function calculate_wavefront(point_cloud):
  phase_map = calculate_phase(point_cloud)  // Calculate phase for each point
  element_voltages = convert_phase_to_voltage(phase_map) // Map phase to voltage
  return element_voltages

function convert_phase_to_voltage(phase_map):
  // Calibration curve: maps phase to voltage for each element
  // Accounts for element-specific properties and material response
  voltage_map = []
  for element in phase_map:
    voltage = calibration_curve[element]
    voltage_map.append(voltage)
  return voltage_map

// Main loop
while (true):
  point_cloud = receive_data()
  voltages = calculate_wavefront(point_cloud)
  send_voltages_to_elements(voltages)
```

**Innovation:** Rather than relying on pre-defined patterns projected onto a surface and interpreted by a camera, this system allows for *dynamic*, arbitrarily complex light patterns to be sculpted and projected.  This has implications for both improving the accuracy and resolution of depth sensing *and* enabling entirely new applications, such as holographic displays or targeted illumination. This bypasses the need for multiple binary patterns and significantly simplifies data processing.  It effectively moves the computational burden from post-capture analysis to pre-projection shaping.
