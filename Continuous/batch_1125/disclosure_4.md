## Adaptive Data Persistence Granularity

**Specification:** A system dynamically adjusting data persistence granularity based on application behavior and predicted failure modes.

**Core Concept:** The patent describes persisting *ranges* of data. This design expands on that by allowing *dynamic* range definition, and extending it to individual data *objects* within those ranges. It also incorporates predictive analysis to prioritize persistence based on predicted failure risks, not just a blanket 'persist' instruction.

**System Components:**

*   **Behavioral Monitor:** Continuously profiles application data access patterns (read/write frequency, data dependencies, modification rates).
*   **Failure Prediction Engine:**  Analyzes system logs, hardware metrics (temperature, voltage), and application behavior to predict potential failure modes (e.g., memory corruption in specific regions, NV-DIMM failure, power loss).  Employs machine learning models trained on historical data.
*   **Granularity Controller:**  Manages data persistence granularity. It can define persistence ranges (like the original patent) *or* target individual data objects. Controlled by the Behavioral Monitor and Failure Prediction Engine.
*   **Persistence Manager:** Handles actual data copying to non-volatile storage.  Optimized for minimal overhead. Uses direct memory access (DMA).
*   **NV-DIMM Interface:** Low-latency interface to the non-volatile memory.  Supports fine-grained write operations.
*   **Mapping Table:** Stores the mapping between application data objects/ranges and their corresponding locations in non-volatile storage.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
MappingTable = empty;

//Application Data Access Event (e.g., write to memory location X)
On DataAccess(Location, OperationType) {
    BehavioralMonitor.RecordEvent(Location, OperationType);

    //Check if location is currently persisted
    if (!MappingTable.Contains(Location)) {
        //Evaluate persistence risk using Failure Prediction Engine
        RiskScore = FailurePredictionEngine.CalculateRisk(Location);

        //If risk exceeds threshold, initiate persistence
        if (RiskScore > PersistenceThreshold) {
            PersistData(Location);
        }
    }
}

//Function to initiate data persistence
function PersistData(Location) {
    //Determine appropriate granularity (object vs. range)
    Granularity = DetermineGranularity(Location);

    //Copy data to non-volatile storage
    PersistenceManager.CopyData(Location, Granularity, NV-DIMM);

    //Update mapping table
    MappingTable.Add(Location, NV-DIMM_Location);
}

//Function to determine granularity.
function DetermineGranularity(Location) {
    //Check if Location is part of a frequently accessed range.
    if(BehavioralMonitor.IsInFrequentRange(Location)){
        return "Range";
    } else {
        return "Object";
    }
}

//Recovery from System Failure
On SystemFailure() {
    //Restore data from non-volatile storage based on mapping table
    For Each Entry in MappingTable {
        PersistenceManager.RestoreData(Entry.NV-DIMM_Location, Entry.Memory_Location);
    }
}
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Dynamic Granularity:** Moves beyond fixed-size persistence ranges to adapt to individual data object needs.
*   **Predictive Persistence:** Proactively persists data based on predicted failure risks.
*   **Reduced Overhead:**  Only persist data that is deemed high-risk, minimizing write amplification and performance impact.
*   **Adaptive Range Definition:** Dynamic range determination based on access patterns.
*   **NV-DIMM Optimization:** Leverages the low latency of NV-DIMMs to improve recovery speed.
