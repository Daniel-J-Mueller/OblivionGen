## Adaptive Acoustic Camouflage - Project "Echo Bloom"

**Core Concept:** Expand the wireless speaker/range extender into a localized sound manipulation device. Instead of merely *playing* sound, the device analyzes ambient audio and *actively shapes* the soundscape around the user, creating zones of acoustic privacy, focused sound, or even simulated environments.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Array:** High-density, beamforming microphone array (minimum 64 microphones) capable of 360-degree audio capture with noise cancellation and directional sensitivity. Must differentiate between desired audio source (e.g., user's voice, streamed music) and ambient noise.
*   **Speaker Array:**  Phased array of miniature, full-range drivers (minimum 32). Drivers individually addressable for precise beamforming and spatial audio control.  Drivers must support a frequency response of 20Hz - 20kHz.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) with a minimum of 8 cores and 16GB RAM. Required for real-time audio analysis, beamforming calculations, and sound synthesis.
*   **Range Extender Integration:** Maintain existing Wi-Fi 6/6E/7 compatibility.  Antenna array integrated *around* speaker array to minimize interference.
*   **Power:**  USB-C PD (Power Delivery) with fast charging capability. Battery backup for portable operation (minimum 8 hours playback).
*   **Enclosure:**  Acoustically transparent, modular design.  Material: Combination of 3D-printable polymer and sound-absorbing fabric.  Shape:  Spherical or dodecahedral to maximize surface area for microphone/speaker placement and optimize sound dispersion.
*   **Sensors:** IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for orientation detection. Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, ambient light) to adapt audio processing.

**Software & Functionality:**

*   **Ambient Audio Analysis:** Real-time spectral analysis of surrounding sound. Identification of dominant noise sources (traffic, voices, machinery).
*   **Acoustic Mapping:** Creation of a 3D acoustic map of the environment.  Visualization of noise sources and sound reflections.
*   **Adaptive Noise Cancellation:**  Targeted cancellation of specific noise sources while preserving desired audio.
*   **Sound Beamforming:**  Focusing audio to a specific location, creating a "private listening zone." Adjustable beam width and direction.
*   **Acoustic Privacy Field:** Creating a localized "bubble" of silence around the user, masking conversations or reducing distractions.
*   **Environmental Sound Simulation:**  Generating realistic soundscapes (e.g., rainforest, ocean waves, coffee shop ambiance) to mask unwanted noise or create immersive experiences.  Procedural generation with adjustable parameters.
*   **Sound Reflection Control:** Utilizing phased array speakers to *cancel* or *enhance* sound reflections, improving audio clarity and reducing echo.
*   **AI-Powered Scene Recognition:** Utilizing onboard AI to identify environments (office, home, outdoors) and automatically adjust audio processing parameters.
*    **API/SDK:** Open API for developers to create custom soundscapes and applications.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm - Adaptive Noise Cancellation):**

```
function adaptivenoisecancellation(ambientAudio, desiredAudio):
    // 1. Analyze ambientAudio spectrum
    ambientSpectrum = FFT(ambientAudio)

    // 2. Analyze desiredAudio spectrum
    desiredSpectrum = FFT(desiredAudio)

    // 3. Identify dominant noise frequencies in ambientSpectrum
    noiseFrequencies = findPeakFrequencies(ambientSpectrum, threshold)

    // 4. Generate anti-noise signal for each noise frequency
    antiNoiseSignal = generateSineWave(noiseFrequencies, amplitude, phaseShift)

    // 5. Combine desiredAudio and antiNoiseSignal
    combinedSignal = desiredAudio + antiNoiseSignal

    // 6. Output combinedSignal
    return combinedSignal
```

**Expansion Ideas:**

*   Haptic Feedback Synchronization - link audio cues to localized haptic feedback for immersive experiences.
*   Biofeedback Integration – adjust soundscape based on user’s physiological state (heart rate, brainwaves).
*   Multi-Device Synchronization - create distributed acoustic zones with multiple "Echo Bloom" units.
*   Augmented Reality Integration – overlay soundscapes onto the user’s visual environment via AR headset.
