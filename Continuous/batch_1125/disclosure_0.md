## Adaptive Resource Scheduling with Predictive Thermal Mapping

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting virtualized resource placement not solely based on desirability indices, but incorporating a predictive thermal map of the physical host infrastructure. This aims to proactively manage heat distribution and prevent thermal throttling *before* it impacts performance, surpassing reactive desirability adjustments.

**Components:**

1.  **Thermal Sensor Network:** Deployment of a comprehensive network of temperature sensors (IR, contact, etc.) strategically placed within each physical host server. Data is transmitted to a central monitoring system.
2.  **Predictive Thermal Model:** A machine learning model (trained on historical sensor data, workload profiles, ambient temperature, and server specifications) that predicts temperature distribution across the entire host infrastructure under various workload scenarios.  Model outputs a 3D thermal map representing predicted heat zones.
3.  **Resource Scheduler Integration:** Modification of the existing resource scheduler to consume the predictive thermal map data.
4.  **Virtual Machine (VM) Thermal Footprint Profiler:** An agent running within each VM that monitors resource usage (CPU, GPU, memory, network) and calculates a “thermal footprint” – a metric representing the heat generated by that VM.
5.  **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:** A control loop that:
    *   Receives thermal footprint data from VMs.
    *   Queries the Predictive Thermal Model for projected heat distribution with the VM running on various hosts.
    *   Calculates a "Thermal Risk Score" for each potential host, factoring in current temperature, predicted heat increase, and proximity to thermal limits.
    *   Adjusts the desirability index *in real-time* based on the Thermal Risk Score.  Higher risk = lower desirability.
    *   Triggers VM migration to hosts with lower Thermal Risk Scores, even if those hosts have slightly lower traditional desirability indices.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustDesirability(VM_Thermal_Footprint, Host_List):
  FOR EACH Host IN Host_List:
    Projected_Heat = Predictive_Thermal_Model(Host, VM_Thermal_Footprint)
    Thermal_Risk_Score = CalculateRisk(Projected_Heat, Host.ThermalLimits)
    Host.Adjusted_Desirability = Host.Base_Desirability * (1 - Thermal_Risk_Score)  // Reduce desirability based on risk
  RETURN Host_List  // Sorted by Adjusted_Desirability
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Predictive Thermal Model could utilize various machine learning techniques (e.g., Neural Networks, Random Forests). Continuous retraining is vital to maintain accuracy.
*   Thermal limits should be configurable and based on server specifications and cooling capacity.
*   The system should log all migration decisions and thermal data for performance analysis and model refinement.
*   Consider incorporating data from cooling system sensors (fan speeds, coolant temperatures) into the Predictive Thermal Model.
*   Alerting mechanism for critical thermal events.
