## Dynamic Payload Morphing for Heterogeneous Device Control

**Concept:** Extend the remote command system to support dynamic payload morphing, enabling a single command message to be interpreted and executed differently based on the receiving device’s capabilities and current state. This moves beyond simple code execution to context-aware command handling.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Payload Structure:** Command messages will contain a base payload *and* a set of conditional payload fragments. Each fragment is associated with a device capability descriptor (e.g., CPU architecture, available memory, installed software versions, current operational mode).

2.  **Device Capability Advertisement:** Remote devices will periodically broadcast (or register) their capability descriptors with the remote command service. This creates a dynamic device profile database.

3.  **Morphing Engine (Remote Command Service):**
    *   Upon receiving a command message, the service analyzes the device profile of the target device.
    *   Based on the profile, the morphing engine selects the appropriate payload fragments and constructs a final payload tailored for that device.
    *   The final payload is then transmitted to the device.

4.  **Fragment Selection Logic:**
    *   Fragments are prioritized. If multiple fragments match a device’s capabilities, the highest-priority fragment is selected.
    *   A default fragment exists for devices with unknown or incomplete capability profiles, providing a fallback execution path.

5.  **Command Syntax:**
    *   Commands will incorporate a 'morphing flag' to signal the use of dynamic payloads.
    *   Payload fragments are defined using a standardized serialization format (e.g., Protocol Buffers, JSON).

6. **State Aware Morphing:**
    *   Devices publish their operational *state* alongside their capabilities (e.g., ‘calibration mode’, ‘low power mode’, ‘error state’).
    *   Morphing engine leverages state information in fragment selection. A fragment optimized for ‘calibration mode’ would be chosen when the device reports this state.

**Pseudocode (Morphing Engine):**

```
function morphPayload(commandMessage, deviceProfile, deviceState) {
    if (commandMessage.morphingFlag == false) {
        return commandMessage.basePayload;
    }

    matchingFragments = [];
    for (fragment in commandMessage.payloadFragments) {
        if (fragment.capabilityDescriptor matches deviceProfile AND fragment.stateDescriptor matches deviceState) {
            matchingFragments.push(fragment);
        }
    }

    if (matchingFragments.length == 0) {
        // Use default fragment or signal error
        return commandMessage.defaultFragment;
    }

    // Sort fragments by priority
    sortedFragments = sortFragmentsByPriority(matchingFragments);

    // Combine fragments into final payload
    finalPayload = combineFragments(sortedFragments);

    return finalPayload;
}
```

**Example Use Case:**

A single command is sent to update device firmware.

*   **High-end device:** Receives a fragment with advanced error checking and A/B partitioning for seamless updates.
*   **Low-end device:** Receives a simplified fragment without advanced features to conserve resources.
*   **Device in Calibration Mode:** Receives a fragment that includes additional calibration data alongside the firmware update.

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Remote Command Service with expanded processing capabilities.
*   Devices with capability/state reporting mechanisms.
*   Standardized payload serialization/deserialization library.
