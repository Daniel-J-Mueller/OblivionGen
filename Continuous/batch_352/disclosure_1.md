## Dynamic Query Expansion with Affective User Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the query ranking system to incorporate real-time user affective state analysis, influencing not just *what* is ranked, but *how* it’s presented and the type of results prioritized. This moves beyond simply learning user preferences based on past *actions* to understanding their *current* emotional and cognitive state.

**Specs:**

**1. Affective Sensor Integration Module:**

*   **Input:**  Real-time data streams from multiple sensors. Examples:
    *   Webcam (facial expression analysis – valence, arousal, dominance)
    *   Microphone (speech analysis – sentiment, energy levels)
    *   Keyboard/Mouse Dynamics (typing speed, pressure, movement patterns – indicating focus or frustration)
    *   Physiological Sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance – requiring user opt-in/wearable integration)
*   **Processing:** Sensor fusion algorithm to create a unified ‘Affective Profile’ – a vector representing the user’s current emotional and cognitive state (e.g., [Valence: 0.7, Arousal: 0.4, Cognitive Load: 0.6]).
*   **Output:**  Normalized Affective Profile data stream.

**2.  Dynamic Query Rewriting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Original User Query, Affective Profile.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Keyword Amplification:**  Based on the Affective Profile, subtly amplify or de-emphasize keywords.  Example: If high arousal/negative valence, prioritize keywords associated with problem-solving/support. If low arousal/positive valence, prioritize keywords associated with exploration/entertainment.
    *   **Intent Inference Adjustment:**  Recalibrate intent inference based on affective state.  Example: A query for "running shoes" from a stressed user might infer a need for stress relief through exercise, prioritizing comfortable, cushioned shoes. From an excited user, it might infer performance, prioritizing lightweight, racing shoes.
    *   **Result Type Modulation:** Shift the balance of result types.  Example: For a frustrated user, prioritize “how-to” guides and troubleshooting articles.  For a curious user, prioritize exploratory content and diverse perspectives.
*   **Output:** Rewritten Query.

**3.  Adaptive Ranking Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Rewritten Query, Candidate Results, Affective Profile, Historical User Data.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Weighted Feature Combination:** Integrate affective signals as additional features in the ranking function.  Example:  If the user is exhibiting signs of cognitive overload, down-weight results with complex layouts or dense information.
    *   **Presentation Modulation:**  Adapt the presentation of results based on affective state.  Example: For a stressed user, use calmer color palettes and simpler layouts.  For an engaged user, use more dynamic and visually appealing presentations.
    *   **Serendipity Injection:** Based on the affective state, dynamically adjust the level of serendipity.  Example: For a bored user, inject more diverse and unexpected results.
*   **Output:** Ranked Results List with presentation adaptations.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Ranking Function):**

```
function rankResults(query, results, affectiveProfile, userHistory):
  baseScore = calculateBaseScore(query, results, userHistory)
  affectiveBoost = 0

  // Example: Boost results aligned with user's emotional state
  if affectiveProfile.valence > 0.7:  // Positive valence
    for result in results:
      if result.sentiment > 0.5:
        affectiveBoost += 0.2  // Boost positive results

  if affectiveProfile.arousal > 0.8: //High arousal
    affectiveBoost +=0.1

  finalScore = baseScore + affectiveBoost
  return sorted(results, key=lambda x: x.finalScore, reverse=True)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Edge computing for real-time sensor processing.
*   Privacy-preserving affective analysis algorithms.
*   User-configurable privacy settings for sensor data.
*   Scalable infrastructure for processing large volumes of sensor data.
*   A/B testing framework for optimizing affective analysis algorithms and ranking functions.
