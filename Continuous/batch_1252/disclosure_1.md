## Secure Data Shard Distribution & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the session key security model to a distributed data storage scenario, leveraging ephemeral data shards and a multi-party computation (MPC) reconstruction process. This moves beyond simply securing communication *to* a data store, and creates a system where data isn't fully assembled *until* authorized access.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Shard Creation:**

*   Input: Raw data payload.
*   Process:
    *   Divide the raw data into *n* equal-sized shards.
    *   Encrypt each shard using a unique, randomly generated symmetric key (shard key).
    *   Encrypt each shard key using the established session key.
    *   Metadata: Store shard number, encrypted shard key, and a hash of the shard content.
*   Output: *n* encrypted shards and associated metadata.

**2. Distributed Storage:**

*   Process: Distribute the *n* encrypted shards across *m* geographically diverse storage nodes. *m* can be less than, equal to, or greater than *n*. Duplicate shards for redundancy.
*   Storage Nodes: Implement basic storage and retrieval functionality. No knowledge of the original data or shard keys.

**3. Access Request & Coordination:**

*   Client Request: Initiate a request for the data, establishing a secure session with a central coordinator node.
*   Coordinator Role:
    *   Identify the storage nodes holding the required shards.
    *   Generate a secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing) for the session key. Share components with the storage nodes.
    *   Initiate shard retrieval from storage nodes.

**4. Shard Retrieval & Partial Decryption:**

*   Storage Node Response: Upon receiving the request and secret sharing component:
    *   Authenticate the request.
    *   Retrieve the requested shard.
    *   Decrypt the shard key using its portion of the secret sharing.
    *   Transmit the decrypted shard and decrypted shard key to the coordinator.

**5. Multi-Party Computation (MPC) Reconstruction:**

*   Coordinator Role:
    *   Collect all decrypted shards and shard keys from storage nodes.
    *   Employ a secure MPC protocol (e.g., oblivious transfer, secret sharing based reconstruction) to combine the shards into the original data *without* ever decrypting the entire dataset on a single node. This is critical.
    *   Verify data integrity using hashes stored in metadata.

**6. Data Delivery:**

*   Coordinator Role:
    *   Transmit the reconstructed data to the client over a secure channel.

**Pseudocode (Coordinator Node):**

```
function reconstructData(client, requestedData):
  sessionKeyShares = generateKeyShares(client) // Shamir's Secret Sharing
  storageNodes = locateShards(requestedData)
  shardResponses = []

  for node in storageNodes:
    sendKeyShare(node, sessionKeyShares[index])
    response = receiveShard(node)
    shardResponses.append(response)

  decryptedData = performMPC(shardResponses) // MPC protocol implementation

  sendData(client, decryptedData)
```

**Innovations:**

*   **Data-at-Rest Security:** Protects data even if storage nodes are compromised.
*   **MPC Integration:** Minimizes the risk of data exposure during reconstruction.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:** Adaptively adjust the number of shards and storage nodes based on data sensitivity and availability requirements.
*   **Resilience:** System can tolerate the failure or compromise of a subset of storage nodes.
