## Modular, Adaptive Bag Support System – ‘Bloom’

**Concept:** Expand the ‘bag protector’ concept into a dynamic, adjustable support structure *within* the delivery box, capable of accommodating bags of varying sizes and fragility. This moves beyond simple protection to active stabilization and presentation.

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Unit:** A hexagonal ‘cell’ constructed from a semi-rigid, interlocking material (think high-density, molded pulp or recycled plastic). Each cell is approximately 15cm across. The cells interlock via a dovetail or similar mechanism, allowing for configurable array construction *within* the delivery box.
*   **Adaptive ‘Petals’:** Each hexagonal cell incorporates six ‘petals’ – flexible, spring-loaded arms made from a resilient polymer (TPU or similar). These petals extend inward, forming a cradle for the bag.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Each petal incorporates a micro-pressure sensor.
*   **Actuation System:** A central, low-power microcontroller embedded within the box controls small linear actuators linked to each petal’s base.
*   **Box Design:** The delivery box has internal rails/slots corresponding to the hexagonal cell interlocking mechanism.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   A weight sensor in the box base detects the presence of a bag being loaded.
    *   The algorithm uses the weight and pressure sensor data from each petal to determine bag size, weight distribution, and fragility.
    *   The algorithm then adjusts the linear actuators to optimize petal positioning, providing tailored support to the bag.
    *   Different ‘support profiles’ can be pre-programmed for different item types (e.g., fragile groceries, heavy books, clothing).
*   **Material Palette:** Recycled/Biodegradable plastics, molded pulp, TPU for petals.

**Pseudocode (simplified control loop):**

```
INITIALIZE:
  - Establish communication with weight sensor, pressure sensors, and actuators.
  - Define support profiles (e.g., 'fragile', 'heavy', 'normal').

LOOP:
  - DETECT_WEIGHT: If weight change detected, initiate bag support sequence.
  - READ_SENSORS: Collect data from weight sensor and all petal pressure sensors.
  - DETERMINE_BAG_PROFILE: Analyze sensor data to determine bag size, weight distribution, and estimate fragility.  (e.g., High weight + localized pressure = 'heavy', low weight + broad pressure = 'fragile').
  - ADJUST_PETALS:
    - For each petal:
      - Calculate target position based on determined bag profile and petal location.
      - Activate corresponding linear actuator to move petal to target position.
  - MONITOR_PRESSURE: Continuously monitor petal pressure sensors.
  - ADJUST_ON_MOVEMENT: If bag shifts during transit (detected by pressure sensor changes), dynamically adjust petal positions to maintain support.
  - END LOOP
```

**Innovation:** The ‘Bloom’ system moves beyond static protection to *dynamic adaptation*.  It not only secures the bag but actively responds to its contents, optimizing support and minimizing damage during transport. It's akin to a miniature, automated packaging system *within* the delivery box. Potential for branding via petal color and custom support profiles.
