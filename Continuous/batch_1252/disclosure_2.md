## Dynamic Data Lineage & Policy Propagation via Graph Database

**Concept:** Extend the authorization framework by building a dynamic data lineage graph and propagating policy changes *through* that graph. This allows for granular, automated policy enforcement based on data origin and transformation, not just static database access rules.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Lineage Graph Construction:**

*   **Component:** Lineage Collector Service
*   **Function:**  Monitor all data operations (reads, writes, transformations) across the data warehouse.  Capture metadata including:
    *   Table/Schema name
    *   Column names
    *   Operation type (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, JOIN, Aggregation)
    *   User/Service performing the operation
    *   Timestamp
*   **Storage:** Graph Database (Neo4j, Amazon Neptune, etc.).  Nodes represent tables/schemas/columns. Edges represent data flow/transformation relationships.
*   **API:**  `POST /lineage/event` – Accepts metadata events from various data warehouse components.  Schema:

    ```json
    {
      "event_type": "READ" | "WRITE" | "TRANSFORM",
      "source_table": "table_name",
      "source_column": "column_name",
      "destination_table": "table_name",
      "destination_column": "column_name",
      "operation_type": "SELECT | INSERT | JOIN | AGGREGATE",
      "user": "user_id",
      "timestamp": "ISO8601 timestamp"
    }
    ```

**2. Policy Definition & Propagation:**

*   **Policy Language:** Declarative policy language (e.g., Open Policy Agent - OPA) focused on data lineage.  Example:

    ```opa
    policy "data_sensitivity" {
      input {
        data_source_table
        data_destination_table
        user
      }
      body {
        if lineage.has_path(data_source_table, data_destination_table) {
            if contains(data_destination_table, "PII_DATA") {
                if user != "data_science_team" {
                    deny
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Policy Engine:** Integrate OPA (or similar) with the lineage graph.
*   **Propagation Mechanism:**
    1.  Policy changes are registered with a Policy Management Service.
    2.  Policy Management Service triggers a graph traversal from affected data sources.
    3.  The traversal identifies all downstream tables/schemas impacted by the policy.
    4.  OPA evaluates the policy at each node based on the lineage graph and current user.
    5.  Access control lists (ACLs) are dynamically updated based on the OPA evaluation.
*   **API:**
    *   `POST /policy` – Register a new policy (OPA Rego code, affected data sources).
    *   `GET /policy/{data_source}` – Retrieve active policies for a data source.

**3. Integration with Existing Authorization Framework:**

*   The dynamic policy engine *augments* the existing authorization system (from the patent).
*   Before granting access, the system consults *both* the existing access rules *and* the dynamic policy engine.
*   The most restrictive result governs access.

**4.  Monitoring and Auditing:**

*   Log all policy evaluations and access decisions.
*   Provide a visual interface to explore the data lineage graph and associated policies.
*   Alert on policy violations and anomalous access patterns.
