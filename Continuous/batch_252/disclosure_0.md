## Temporal Key Sharding with Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the multi-key security paradigm by incorporating physiological data as a dynamic key component and implementing temporal key sharding, where key fragments are valid only during specific, narrowly defined time windows and are influenced by the user’s current physiological state.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

1.  **Biometric Sensor Suite:** Integrated sensors to continuously monitor:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – High-resolution ECG.
    *   Skin Conductance (GSR) – Galvanic Skin Response.
    *   Brainwave Activity (EEG) – Non-invasive EEG headset.
    *   Facial Muscle Activity (EMG) – Micro-EMG sensors around key facial muscles.
2.  **Secure Enclave Module (SEM):** Dedicated hardware security module for key generation, storage, and cryptographic operations.  Must support advanced encryption standard (AES) and elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC).
3.  **Real-Time Clock (RTC):** High-precision RTC synchronized with a trusted time source (NTP/GPS).  Resolution of 10 milliseconds or better.
4.  **Communication Module:** Secure communication interfaces (Bluetooth Low Energy, Wi-Fi) for transmitting encrypted data and receiving authentication challenges.

**II. Software Components:**

1.  **Biofeedback Processing Engine:** Software module responsible for:
    *   Real-time data acquisition from biometric sensors.
    *   Noise filtering and signal processing.
    *   Feature extraction (e.g., HRV metrics, GSR peaks, EEG band power, EMG activation levels).
    *   Anomaly detection (identifying deviations from the user’s baseline physiological state).
2.  **Key Generation & Sharding Module:**
    *   Generates a master key based on a strong random number generator.
    *   Splits the master key into *n* key fragments.
    *   Each fragment is encrypted using a different algorithm and/or symmetric key.
    *   Dynamically assigns a validity window (e.g., 5-15 seconds) to each fragment based on the current time and the user's physiological state.
3.  **Temporal Key Orchestration Module:**
    *   Manages the lifecycle of key fragments.
    *   Determines which fragments are valid at any given moment.
    *   Prioritizes fragment retrieval based on time and physiological relevance.
    *   Enforces a maximum acceptable delay for fragment availability.
4.  **Secure Storage & Retrieval:**
    *   Key fragments are stored in a distributed, tamper-proof manner.
    *   Each fragment is associated with its validity window and physiological trigger.
    *   Retrieval requires both temporal and physiological verification.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Enrollment:** The system establishes a baseline physiological profile for the user during a secure enrollment process.
2.  **Authentication:** When access to protected data is requested:
    *   The Biofeedback Processing Engine captures the user’s current physiological state.
    *   The Temporal Key Orchestration Module identifies the valid key fragments based on time and the user’s physiology.
    *   The system requests the valid fragments from their respective storage locations.
    *   Fragments are decrypted and combined to reconstruct the master key.
    *   The master key is used to decrypt the protected data.
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The validity windows of key fragments are dynamically adjusted based on continuous monitoring of the user’s physiological state. If the user’s physiology deviates significantly from their baseline, the system may invalidate existing fragments and generate new ones.

**Pseudocode (Key Fragment Generation):**

```
function generateKeyFragments(masterKey, numFragments):
  fragments = []
  for i from 0 to numFragments:
    fragment = encrypt(masterKey, i) // Encrypt a portion of the master key
    validityStart = currentTime() + random(0, 5) // Random offset
    validityEnd = validityStart + 10 // 10-second window
    physiologicalTrigger = calculatePhysiologicalThreshold(i) // e.g., HRV range
    fragmentMetadata = {
      "validityStart": validityStart,
      "validityEnd": validityEnd,
      "physiologicalTrigger": physiologicalTrigger
    }
    storeFragment(fragment, fragmentMetadata)
    fragments.append(fragment)
  return fragments
```

**Innovation:**  This system introduces a moving target for attackers.  Even if an attacker compromises a key fragment, it is only valid for a short period and under specific physiological conditions. The combination of temporal and physiological security layers creates a significantly more robust security paradigm.  A stolen fragment is effectively useless without a live, authenticated user.
