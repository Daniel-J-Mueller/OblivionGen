## Adaptive Redundancy with Dynamic Bus Topology

**Concept:** Expand on the fault isolation concepts to create a power system capable of *reconfiguring* its bus topology in response to failures, shifting load and redundancy dynamically, and even isolating *sections* of the battery array to preserve capacity.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Modular Battery Blocks:** Battery strings are arranged into independent, yet interconnected, blocks. Each block comprises multiple series-connected battery cells, and includes internal monitoring and switching capabilities.  Each block has its own dedicated fast-acting protection device connecting it to the shared DC bus.
*   **Reconfigurable Bus Matrix:** Implement a solid-state switch matrix (using high-current MOSFETs or similar) between each battery block and the DC bus. This matrix allows for arbitrary connection/disconnection of battery blocks.
*   **Load Prioritization & Shedding:** A central controller identifies critical and non-critical loads.  Non-critical loads are assigned lower priority and are candidates for shedding during fault conditions.
*   **Distributed Monitoring:** Each battery block and critical load has a dedicated monitoring unit measuring voltage, current, temperature, and state of charge (SoC).

**2. Control Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
//Initialization
Connect all battery blocks to the DC bus
Set all loads to active

//Main Loop
While (system is running) {
    For Each Battery Block {
        Monitor Voltage, Current, Temperature, SoC
        If (Fault Detected in Block) {
            Isolate Block from DC Bus
            Initiate Load Shedding (if necessary)
            Reconfigure Bus Matrix to redistribute load to healthy blocks
            Log Fault Event
        }
    }

    For Each Load {
        Monitor Current, Voltage
        If (Load Failure Detected) {
           If (Load is Critical) {
                Attempt to switch to redundant load (if available)
           } else {
                Shed Load
           }
        }
    }

    //Dynamic Capacity Management
    If (Overall SoC < Threshold) {
       //Attempt to shift load to blocks with higher SoC
       //Consider temporary voltage reductions on less critical loads
    }
}
```

**3. Hardware Components:**

*   **High-Current Solid-State Switches:** MOSFETs or SiC MOSFETs rated for peak system current and voltage.  Fast switching speed is critical.
*   **Battery Management System (BMS):** Distributed BMS modules within each battery block.  Communication via CAN bus or similar.
*   **Central Control Unit:** High-performance microcontroller or FPGA to execute the control algorithm and manage the switch matrix.
*   **Current/Voltage Sensors:** Precision current and voltage sensors for accurate monitoring.
*   **CAN Bus Communication:** For communication between BMS modules and the central control unit.

**4. Fault Tolerance Features:**

*   **N+1 Redundancy:** Design the system with enough battery blocks to sustain the loss of one or more blocks without compromising critical load operation.
*   **Dynamic Load Balancing:**  Intelligently redistribute load across healthy battery blocks to prevent overload and maximize efficiency.
*   **Adaptive Voltage Control:**  Slightly adjust the DC bus voltage (within acceptable limits) to optimize performance and extend runtime.
*    **Predictive Fault Detection**: Use machine learning to detect patterns which could be indicative of failure, and attempt pre-emptive isolation.



**Innovation:** This system goes beyond simple fault *isolation* to achieve *adaptive redundancy*. By dynamically reconfiguring the bus topology, it can sustain multiple failures, optimize power distribution, and extend system runtime. This approach is particularly valuable in applications where reliability and availability are paramount.
