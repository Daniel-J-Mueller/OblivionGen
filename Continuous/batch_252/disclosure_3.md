## Adaptive Data Tiering with Predictive Pre-Copy

**Concept:** Extend the cluster scaling mechanism to incorporate predictive data tiering, anticipating scaling needs *before* they occur and proactively migrating data to optimized storage tiers. This goes beyond simply copying data during a scale operation; it aims to *prevent* performance bottlenecks associated with scaling by having data pre-positioned.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Tiering Service (PTS) – Runs as a daemon on each node, interacting with the cluster control interface.
*   **Data Model:** Each data slice is tagged with a 'volatility score' (VS) – a metric representing frequency of access, recency of access, and predicted future access based on historical patterns and application workload analysis.
*   **Storage Tiers:** Define multiple storage tiers based on speed/cost:
    *   **Tier 0:** NVMe SSD – Highest performance, highest cost.
    *   **Tier 1:** SSD – High performance, moderate cost.
    *   **Tier 2:** HDD – Moderate performance, low cost.
*   **Tiering Policy:** Configurable rules define when data moves between tiers based on VS thresholds. Example: VS > 0.8 – Tier 0; 0.4 < VS < 0.8 – Tier 1; VS < 0.4 – Tier 2.
*   **Scaling Prediction Module:** Continuously monitors cluster workload metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and predicts future scaling events (increase/decrease in node count or node type). Uses time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) with anomaly detection.
*   **Pre-Copy Mechanism:** When a scaling event is predicted:
    1.  PTS identifies data slices likely to be accessed by the *new* nodes based on application access patterns.
    2.  These slices are proactively copied to appropriate storage tiers on the new nodes *before* the scaling operation is finalized.
    3.  The original slices on the current cluster remain available for read access during the pre-copy process.
    4.  Upon cluster switchover, the new nodes seamlessly serve the data.
*   **Dynamic Tier Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor data access patterns after a scaling event. Adjust data tiering dynamically to optimize performance and cost.

**Pseudocode (PTS daemon):**

```
loop:
  calculate_volatility_score(data_slice)
  tier = determine_tier(volatility_score)
  if current_tier != tier:
    migrate_data(data_slice, tier)

  scaling_prediction = ScalingPredictionModule.predict_scaling_event()
  if scaling_prediction.predicted:
    new_nodes = scaling_prediction.new_nodes
    for node in new_nodes:
      data_to_pre_copy = identify_relevant_data(node)
      for slice in data_to_pre_copy:
        pre_copy_data(slice, node)
```

**Considerations:**

*   The `identify_relevant_data` function needs to accurately predict which data slices will be accessed by the new nodes. This requires a deep understanding of the application's data access patterns.
*   Pre-copying data can add significant overhead. It's important to optimize the process to minimize impact on cluster performance.
*   The tiering policy should be carefully tuned to balance performance and cost.
*   Error handling and data consistency are critical. Ensure that data is copied reliably and that there are mechanisms to recover from failures.
