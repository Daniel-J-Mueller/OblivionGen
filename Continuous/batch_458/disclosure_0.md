## Dynamic Permission Inheritance with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the permission vector concept by allowing permissions to be *inherited* across permission sets, but with a defined *temporal decay*. This introduces a 'half-life' to permissions, where granted access gradually diminishes over time if not actively refreshed. This allows for a more nuanced and secure system, accommodating temporary access needs and reducing the risk of lingering permissions.

**Specs:**

*   **Permission Vector Enhancement:** The existing permission vector structure is augmented. Each permission element within a set now includes:
    *   `permission_flag`: Boolean – indicates if the permission is currently active.
    *   `decay_rate`: Float – defines the rate at which the permission decays (e.g., 0.1 = 10% decay per time unit).
    *   `refresh_interval`: Integer – how often the permission must be explicitly refreshed to maintain full strength.
    *   `inherited_from`: String – Identifier of the permission set from which this permission was inherited (or null if originating).
    *   `last_refreshed`: Timestamp – Last time the permission was actively refreshed.

*   **Inheritance Mechanism:** When granting a permission, the system can specify inheritance from another permission set. This creates a dependency – if the source permission set’s permission flag is cleared, the inherited permission is also affected (subject to decay).

*   **Temporal Decay Function:** A function that calculates permission strength based on time elapsed since `last_refreshed` and `decay_rate`.  A simple exponential decay could be used:

    `strength = e^(-decay_rate * (current_time - last_refreshed))`

    Permissions are only honored if `strength` exceeds a pre-defined threshold (e.g., 0.5).

*   **Refresh API:** A dedicated API endpoint allowing applications or administrators to explicitly refresh permissions. This resets `last_refreshed` and restores `strength` to its maximum value.

*   **Background Decay Service:** A background service that periodically iterates through the permission vectors, applying the decay function to all permissions and clearing permissions whose `strength` falls below the threshold.

**Pseudocode (Background Decay Service):**

```
function decay_permissions(permission_vectors):
  for vector in permission_vectors:
    for permission_set in vector:
      for permission_element in permission_set:
        current_time = get_current_timestamp()
        time_elapsed = current_time - permission_element.last_refreshed
        permission_element.strength = exp(-permission_element.decay_rate * time_elapsed)

        if permission_element.strength < threshold:
          permission_element.permission_flag = false  // Revoke permission
          // Optional: Log revocation event
```

**Use Case:** Temporary access for specific tasks. Imagine a user granted temporary access to a sensitive data set for an hour. The system could automatically revoke access after the hour, or a background process could handle the expiration based on decay. This is far more secure than relying on manual revocation or scheduled tasks.
