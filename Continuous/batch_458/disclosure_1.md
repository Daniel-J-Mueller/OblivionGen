## Autonomous Network Reputation System

**Specification:** A system for dynamically assessing and assigning reputation scores to IP addresses based on observed network behavior, impacting routing and access control decisions.

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing IP address validation to incorporate a continuous reputation assessment, moving beyond static assignment checks. This reputation is used to influence routing paths and potentially block or throttle traffic from low-reputation sources.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Sensors:** Distributed across the network, these sensors monitor traffic patterns from each IP address. Metrics include:
    *   Packet loss rate
    *   Latency spikes
    *   Frequency of SYN floods or other DoS-like behavior
    *   Attempts to connect to known malicious hosts
    *   Deviation from typical traffic profiles (volume, destination ports, etc.)
*   **Reputation Engine:** A central processing unit that aggregates data from the behavioral sensors. It uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, Bayesian networks) to calculate a reputation score for each IP address.  The score is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the highest reputation.
*   **Reputation Database:** Stores the reputation scores for all observed IP addresses.  The database is designed for high throughput and low latency access.  A distributed key-value store would be appropriate.
*   **Policy Engine:** Allows network administrators to define policies based on IP reputation.  Examples:
    *   Route traffic from high-reputation IPs over preferred paths.
    *   Throttle traffic from medium-reputation IPs.
    *   Block traffic from low-reputation IPs.
    *   Trigger alerts for IPs exhibiting sudden reputation drops.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Incorporates information from threat intelligence feeds, intrusion detection systems, and user reports to refine the reputation scoring algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function process_packet(packet):
  src_ip = packet.source_ip
  reputation = get_reputation(src_ip)

  if reputation >= 80:
    # High reputation - prioritize routing
    forward_packet(packet, preferred_path)
  else if reputation >= 50:
    # Medium reputation - normal routing, monitor
    forward_packet(packet, normal_path)
    log_packet(packet)
  else:
    # Low reputation - throttle or block
    if policy.block_low_reputation:
      drop_packet(packet)
    else:
      throttle_packet(packet)

function get_reputation(ip_address):
  # Query reputation database
  reputation = reputation_database.query(ip_address)
  if reputation is null:
    # Assign default reputation score
    reputation = 50
  return reputation
```

**Novelty:**  Current IP address validation focuses on *static* assignment checks. This system introduces a *dynamic* reputation assessment that adapts to real-time network behavior, creating a more robust and adaptive security posture.  It moves beyond simple "good" or "bad" lists to a nuanced scoring system that allows for flexible policy enforcement.
