## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend undesirable sound suppression by *reconstructing* the acoustic scene, replacing suppressed sounds with contextually appropriate ambient audio. Instead of simply removing a dog bark, replace it with gentle ambient sounds – birdsong if outdoors, a distant hum if indoors – dynamically blended to match the existing soundscape.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Acoustic Scene Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time audio stream.
    *   Function: Analyze the audio stream to determine the acoustic scene (e.g., indoor, outdoor, office, home). Employ a multi-layered classification system using ML models trained on extensive acoustic scene datasets.  Output a confidence score for each identified scene.
    *   Output:  Acoustic scene classification with confidence score.

2.  **Undesirable Sound Detection & Segmentation Module:**
    *   Input: Real-time audio stream, Acoustic Scene Classification.
    *   Function:  Identify and segment undesirable sounds (dog barks, doorbells, etc.) using ML models.  The models will be tailored to the acoustic scene - for example, a doorbell is more likely (and thus the model is tuned for it) in an “indoor home” scene. This module will output the start/end times and classification of the undesirable sound event.
    *   Output:  Undesirable sound event timestamps & classification.

3.  **Ambient Audio Generation/Selection Module:**
    *   Input: Acoustic Scene Classification, Undesirable Sound Event,  Existing Audio (pre/post event segments).
    *   Function: This is the core innovation. Based on the acoustic scene *and* analysis of the audio surrounding the suppressed event, select or *generate* ambient audio.
        *   **Selection Path:** Maintain a vast library of pre-recorded ambient audio categorized by scene and emotional tone. The system will select the audio clip that best matches the context.
        *   **Generation Path:** Use a generative audio model (e.g., a Variational Autoencoder or a GAN) to synthesize ambient audio *specifically* tailored to the surrounding audio.  The model learns to predict what “should” be there based on the existing soundscape.
    *   Output: Ambient audio clip or generated audio stream.

4.  **Audio Blending & Reconstruction Module:**
    *   Input: Original audio stream, Suppressed audio segment, Ambient audio stream.
    *   Function: Seamlessly blend the ambient audio into the original audio, replacing the suppressed segment.  Employ a dynamic gain control algorithm to ensure a smooth transition and prevent audible artifacts. Utilize spectral shaping techniques to match the tonal characteristics of the ambient audio to the existing soundscape.  The blending will be informed by the duration of the suppressed sound.
    *   Output: Reconstructed audio stream.

**Pseudocode (Blending Algorithm):**

```
function blendAudio(originalAudio, suppressedSegment, ambientAudio, suppressionStart, suppressionEnd):
  // Calculate duration of suppressed segment
  duration = suppressionEnd - suppressionStart

  // Apply fade-in/fade-out to ambient audio
  fadeDuration = 0.1 * duration // 10% of duration
  ambientAudio = applyFade(ambientAudio, fadeDuration)

  // Calculate gain for ambient audio
  gain = calculateDynamicGain(originalAudio, suppressionStart, suppressionEnd)

  // Apply gain to ambient audio
  ambientAudio = applyGain(ambientAudio, gain)

  // Replace suppressed segment with blended audio
  reconstructedAudio = replaceSegment(originalAudio, suppressionStart, suppressionEnd, ambientAudio)

  return reconstructedAudio
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to customize the types of ambient audio used for different scenes and undesirable sounds.
*   **Real-time Performance:** Optimize the algorithms and models for real-time processing on edge devices.
*   **Emotional Context:** Incorporate emotional analysis of the audio to select or generate ambient audio that complements the overall mood of the communication.
