## Dynamic Password Composition via Biometric Drift

**Core Concept:** Augment password generation not with static seed values or media, but with real-time biometric data, specifically subtle variations in user typing rhythm and pressure (if available via device). This creates passwords that are uniquely tied to the *way* a user interacts with their device, not just *what* they input.

**Specifications:**

*   **Biometric Data Acquisition:** Integrate with device input mechanisms (keyboard, touchscreen) to capture typing dynamics – inter-key timings, key press duration, pressure (where supported). Data is *not* stored as raw input, but processed immediately.
*   **Drift Calculation:** Establish a baseline typing profile for each user during initial setup. Subsequent typing sessions are analyzed for deviations ("drift") from this baseline.  Drift is calculated as a vector representing changes in timing and pressure patterns.
*   **Password Component Generation:**
    *   Use the drift vector as a seed for a Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG).
    *   The PRNG outputs a series of indices referencing a lexicon of words, syllables, and characters. The lexicon is segmented into tiers of complexity (common words, less common, symbols, numbers).
    *   The tier selection is determined by a user-defined “complexity level” setting, influencing the strength of the generated password.
*   **Password Assembly:**
    *   Combine elements from the lexicon based on PRNG output.
    *   Introduce controlled randomness (e.g., capitalization, symbol insertion) governed by the complexity level.
    *   Assemble multiple components into a candidate password.
*   **Entropy Validation:**  Calculate the entropy of the generated password. If it falls below a minimum threshold, the process is repeated with adjusted PRNG parameters or a re-sampled lexicon segment.
*   **User Feedback & Learning:**  Allow users to provide feedback on password memorability. The system learns to generate passwords with a balance between strength and ease of recall.
*   **Password Rotation:** Implement automatic password rotation based on detected biometric drift patterns. A significant change in typing style could trigger a password update.
*   **Device Binding:**  Link the biometric baseline to the specific device. Attempts to use the password on a different device require re-establishing the baseline and will likely fail.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generatePassword(user_id, device_id, complexity_level):

  baseline = loadBaseline(user_id, device_id)
  current_typing_data = captureTypingData()
  drift_vector = calculateDrift(baseline, current_typing_data)
  prng = initializePRNG(drift_vector)
  
  password_components = []
  while length(password_components) < desired_length:
      index = prng.next()
      component = lexicon[index % lexicon.length]
      password_components.append(component)
      
  password = assemblePassword(password_components)
  
  if entropy(password) < minimum_entropy:
      return generatePassword(user_id, device_id, complexity_level)
  
  return password
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Factor Integration:** Combine biometric drift with other authentication factors (e.g., time-based one-time passwords).
*   **Behavioral Biometrics:** Extend drift analysis to include mouse movements, scrolling patterns, and other behavioral data.
*   **Adaptive Complexity:** Dynamically adjust password complexity based on user behavior and risk assessment.
*   **Offline Password Generation:** Allow users to generate a set of passwords offline, seeded with a biometric snapshot taken during the online session.
