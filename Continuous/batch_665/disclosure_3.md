## Adaptive Review Gamification & Micro-Rewards

**Concept:** Extend the review request system to incorporate gamification elements and a micro-reward economy tailored to user behavior and item type, influencing review quality & volume.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profiling Module:**

*   **Input:** User purchase history, browsing data, initial item ratings (if provided at purchase), review history (volume, length, sentiment), response time to review requests.
*   **Processing:**  AI-driven model classifies users into behavioral segments (e.g., "Detailed Reviewers," "Quick Raters," "Passive Buyers," "Brand Advocates"). Model dynamically updates with each user interaction.
*   **Output:** User profile containing behavioral segment, estimated review quality/length, preferred reward types (see Reward System).

**2. Dynamic Review Request Scheduling:**

*   **Input:** Item type, user profile, estimated evaluation time (patent specifies this), current reward balance.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Adjusts timing of review request based on user profile (e.g., “Detailed Reviewers” receive requests slightly later, “Quick Raters” receive immediate requests).
    *   Introduces "Review Streaks."  Successful, timely reviews contribute to a streak, increasing potential rewards. Breaks in the streak reduce rewards.
    *   "Challenge" Reviews: For certain items (e.g., complex electronics), users receive a “Challenge Review” request, offering a higher reward for a particularly detailed review.
*   **Output:** Optimized review request schedule for each user and item.

**3. Reward System:**

*   **Reward Types:**
    *   **Micro-Discounts:** Small percentage off future purchases.
    *   **Loyalty Points:** Accumulated for larger rewards.
    *   **Early Access:** To new products or sales.
    *   **Charitable Donations:** A portion of the reward is donated to a charity of the user's choice.
    *   **Virtual Badges/Achievements:** Displayed on user profile.
    *   **Priority Support:** Faster response times for customer service.
*   **Reward Allocation:** Based on:
    *   Review Length: Longer, more detailed reviews earn more.
    *   Review Quality:  AI-driven sentiment analysis and keyword extraction assess quality.
    *   Image/Video Uploads:  Visual content earns bonus rewards.
    *   Review Helpfulness: Measured by upvotes/downvotes from other users.
    *   Streak Bonuses: Maintaining a review streak increases rewards.

**4. Gamified Interface:**

*   User Dashboard: Displays review streak, earned rewards, available challenges, and progress towards achievements.
*   Leaderboards: (Optional) Display top reviewers (with privacy controls).
*   Progress Bars: Visually track progress towards reward goals.
*   Personalized Recommendations: Suggests items to review based on purchase history.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Review Request Logic):**

```
FUNCTION scheduleReviewRequest(userProfile, itemType, estimatedEvaluationTime):
  //Determine base request delay
  requestDelay = estimatedEvaluationTime

  //Adjust delay based on user profile
  IF userProfile.segment == "Detailed Reviewer":
    requestDelay = requestDelay * 1.2 //Add 20% delay
  ELSE IF userProfile.segment == "Quick Rater":
    requestDelay = requestDelay * 0.8 //Reduce 20% delay

  //Check for existing review streak
  IF userProfile.reviewStreak > 0:
    requestDelay = requestDelay * 0.9 //Reduce delay further for active streak

  //Determine if Challenge Review applicable
  IF itemType == "Complex Electronics" AND userProfile.reviewStreak > 2:
    challengeReview = TRUE
    rewardMultiplier = 1.5
  ELSE:
    challengeReview = FALSE
    rewardMultiplier = 1.0

  //Schedule request
  scheduleTask(sendReviewRequest, userProfile, itemType, requestDelay, challengeReview, rewardMultiplier)
```

**Novelty:** The integration of dynamic behavioral profiling, gamification, and a tiered micro-reward system tailored to individual users and item types. This aims to increase review volume, quality, and engagement beyond simple post-purchase requests. The addition of charitable donations as a reward option and linking to a review streak is also innovative.
