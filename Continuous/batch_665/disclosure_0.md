## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Personalized Cancellation

**System Overview:**

A distributed network of micro-directional speakers and microphones integrated into a physical space (e.g., a room, vehicle cabin). These units operate in concert to create a dynamic acoustic map and deliver highly personalized, localized noise/echo cancellation.  This goes beyond simple beamforming by actively *shaping* the acoustic environment.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Micro-Speaker Array:**  Each unit incorporates 6-8 micro-directional speakers capable of phased array operation.  Frequency response: 20Hz – 20kHz.  Individual speaker power: 5W RMS. Physical dimensions: 5cm x 5cm x 2cm.
*   **Microphone Array:** Each unit incorporates 4-6 high-sensitivity MEMS microphones arranged in a circular pattern.  Frequency response: 10Hz – 25kHz. Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): >70dB.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Each unit contains a dedicated embedded processor (ARM Cortex-A72 equivalent or better) with a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for real-time acoustic modeling and signal processing.
*   **Communication:** Units communicate via a low-latency, high-bandwidth mesh network (e.g., Wi-Fi 6E, UWB) with central coordination.
*   **Power:** Units are powered via PoE (Power over Ethernet) or local AC adapters.

**Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Environment Mapping:**
    *   Units continuously emit short, inaudible (or very low volume) chirps or swept sine waves.
    *   Microphone arrays capture the reflections and reverberations of these signals.
    *   A central server uses Time-Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and beamforming techniques to construct a 3D acoustic map of the space. This map identifies key reflective surfaces, sound sources, and areas of high acoustic energy.
2.  **Personalized Acoustic Zones:**
    *   User profiles are created, specifying preferred sound characteristics (e.g., bright, warm, neutral) and noise cancellation preferences.
    *   The system uses user location (via Bluetooth beacon, UWB, or camera-based tracking) to define a personalized acoustic zone around the user.
3.  **Adaptive Cancellation & Shaping:**
    *   The system analyzes incoming audio (speech, music, environmental noise) using machine learning models.
    *   Based on the acoustic map, user preferences, and incoming audio, the system generates a series of precisely timed and phased audio signals for each micro-speaker.
    *   These signals are designed to:
        *   **Cancel unwanted noise** through destructive interference.
        *   **Reduce echoes and reverberations** by actively absorbing or redirecting sound waves.
        *   **Shape the acoustic environment** to enhance speech intelligibility or create a more immersive listening experience.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   The system continuously monitors the acoustic environment and adjusts the speaker output in real-time to compensate for changes in sound sources, user location, or room conditions.
5.  **AI-Powered Learning:**
    *   The system uses reinforcement learning to optimize the speaker output and improve the effectiveness of the cancellation and shaping algorithms.  Data from user feedback and environmental monitoring is used to train the AI models.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// For each unit:

// 1. Environment Mapping:
EmitChirp();
CaptureResponse();
SendToCentralServer();

// 2. Receive instructions from central server:
ReceiveTargetZone();
ReceiveCancellationProfile();

// 3. Process incoming audio:
Audio = CaptureAudio();
Features = ExtractFeatures(Audio);

// 4. Generate cancellation signal:
CancellationSignal = GenerateSignal(Features, CancellationProfile);

// 5. Emit cancellation signal:
EmitSignal(CancellationSignal);
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Open-plan offices
*   Vehicle cabins
*   Conference rooms
*   Home theaters
*   Recording studios
*   Accessibility (enhancing speech intelligibility for individuals with hearing impairments)
