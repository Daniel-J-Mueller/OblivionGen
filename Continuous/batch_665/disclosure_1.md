## Dynamic Pixel Rate – Adaptive Texture Streaming for Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic pixel update rate concept to facilitate efficient texture streaming for augmented reality (AR) applications. Instead of solely focusing on frame-to-frame differences for video, leverage the same principles to stream and dynamically refine high-resolution textures overlaid onto the real world.

**Specs:**

*   **Texture Tile System:** Divide AR textures into a grid of tiles (e.g., 64x64 or 128x128 pixels). Each tile functions as an independent update unit.
*   **Initial Texture Stream:** Begin streaming a low-resolution base texture for the AR overlay. This ensures a quick initial render.
*   **Per-Tile Difference Calculation:** For each tile, calculate the difference between the current rendered tile and a higher-resolution version of that tile available on the server. Use a perceptual difference metric (e.g., Structural Similarity Index – SSIM) instead of raw pixel differences to prioritize visually significant changes.
*   **Priority Queue:** Maintain a priority queue of tiles based on their perceptual difference score. Tiles with higher scores (more noticeable changes) are prioritized for update.
*   **Bandwidth Allocation:** Dynamically allocate bandwidth to texture tile updates based on network conditions and user priority.
*   **Client-Side Prediction:** Implement client-side prediction to anticipate texture changes based on user movement and scene understanding. This can smooth transitions and reduce perceived latency.
*   **Multi-Resolution Texture Storage:** Store textures in multiple resolutions on the server. The client requests the appropriate resolution based on its network connection and rendering capabilities.
*   **Accumulated Difference Threshold:** Use an accumulated difference threshold similar to the patent. If a tile’s accumulated perceptual difference exceeds the threshold over multiple frames, prioritize updating that tile.
*   **Timestamping:** Include timestamps with each texture tile update to synchronize rendering with the AR scene. Leverage the timestamp generation described in the patent.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
// Initialization
baseTexture = LoadLowResTexture();
priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue();
accumulatedDifferences = new Dictionary<TileID, float>();

// Per Frame
for each TileID in Scene:
    highResTile = GetHighResTileFromServer(TileID);
    perceptualDifference = CalculateSSIM(baseTexture[TileID], highResTile);
    accumulatedDifferences[TileID] += perceptualDifference;

    if accumulatedDifferences[TileID] > Threshold:
        SendUpdateRequest(TileID);
        baseTexture[TileID] = highResTile;
        accumulatedDifferences[TileID] = 0;

// Receive Update
function ReceiveUpdate(TileID, highResTile):
    baseTexture[TileID] = highResTile;
    accumulatedDifferences[TileID] = 0;
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust network connection for streaming high-resolution textures.
*   GPU acceleration is essential for rendering complex AR scenes and processing textures.
*   The perceptual difference metric (SSIM) is computationally intensive and may require optimization.
*   Server-side infrastructure for storing and streaming textures must be scalable and reliable.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced bandwidth usage compared to streaming entire high-resolution textures.
*   Improved AR experience with dynamic and detailed textures.
*   Adaptive streaming based on network conditions and user preferences.
*   Scalability to support large and complex AR environments.
