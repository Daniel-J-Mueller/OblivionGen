**Adaptive Pixel-Level Haptic Feedback Display**

**Specifications:**

*   **Display Type:** High-resolution micro-LED or OLED display. Target pixel pitch < 50µm.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Each pixel incorporates a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) force sensor – a capacitive or piezoelectric element – embedded *within* the pixel structure, directly beneath the light-emitting diode. Sensor resolution: 1µN.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Each pixel also contains a miniature, integrated linear actuator (e.g., voice coil actuator or piezoelectric stack) directly coupled to the MEMS force sensor. Stroke length: 1-5µm.  Actuation frequency: 100Hz – 1kHz.
*   **Control System:** Dedicated processing unit (integrated into display controller) responsible for:
    *   Real-time force feedback calculation.
    *   Individual pixel actuation control.
    *   Sensor data acquisition and processing.
    *   Communication with host device (e.g., computer, gaming console).
*   **Software Interface:** API providing access to:
    *   Pixel-level force control.
    *   Haptic texture generation.
    *   Force feedback profiles.
    *   Sensor data streaming.
*   **Power Requirements:** Low-power operation is critical. Dedicated power management circuitry for individual pixel actuation.
*   **Materials:** Durable and flexible materials for MEMS fabrication. Transparent conductive films for electrodes.

**Innovation Description:**

This design extends the concept of pixel-level light control to *physical* control.  Instead of simply displaying an image, the display can provide localized haptic feedback, simulating textures, edges, and even forces directly to the user’s fingertip or palm. The light sensor feedback in the reference patent is utilized to calibrate/tune/ensure uniformity, but is not integral.

**Operation:**

1.  The display receives image data and associated haptic information (e.g., texture map, force profile) from the host device.
2.  For each pixel, the processing unit calculates the required force based on the haptic information and the desired interaction.
3.  The processing unit sends a control signal to the pixel's actuator, causing it to apply the calculated force.
4.  The MEMS force sensor measures the applied force, providing feedback for closed-loop control and ensuring accurate force delivery.
5.  The user perceives the haptic feedback as a tactile sensation on their skin, enhancing the visual experience.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Gaming:** Realistic tactile feedback for immersive gaming experiences.
*   **Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Enhanced touch interaction in VR/AR applications.
*   **Medical Simulation:** Realistic tactile feedback for surgical training and medical device testing.
*   **Accessibility:** Tactile displays for visually impaired users.
*   **Industrial Control:** Precise tactile feedback for remote control of robots and machinery.
