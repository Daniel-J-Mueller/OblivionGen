## Aerial Vehicle Swarm Mapping with Bio-Inspired Flicker Fusion

**Concept:** Leverage high-speed, low-persistence imaging from multiple aerial vehicles (drones) to create a dynamic, high-resolution 3D map of an environment, mimicking the flicker fusion response of biological vision systems. This allows for capturing detail beyond the limitations of traditional stereo vision, especially in complex or rapidly changing environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Aerial Vehicle (Per Unit):**
    *   Frame: Quadcopter configuration, lightweight carbon fiber.
    *   Propulsion: High-RPM brushless motors, optimized for rapid maneuvering.
    *   Imaging System:
        *   Global Shutter Camera: High-speed ( > 200 FPS) monochrome camera with global shutter to eliminate rolling shutter artifacts. Resolution: 1280x720 minimum.
        *   LED Strobe: High-intensity, precisely timed LED strobe synchronized with camera exposure. Variable strobe frequency (adjustable via onboard computer).
        *   Polarization Filter: Linear polarization filter placed over camera lens to minimize glare and improve contrast.
    *   Onboard Computer: Edge TPU or similar for real-time image processing and synchronization.
    *   Communication: Dedicated 5 GHz radio link for inter-drone synchronization and data transmission to ground station.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): High-precision IMU for accurate pose estimation.
*   **Swarm Coordination:**
    *   Swarm Size: Configurable, 5-20 drones recommended.
    *   Trajectory Planning: Algorithms to distribute drones in a non-overlapping, pseudo-random pattern within the designated mapping volume. The pattern adapts in real time based on environmental factors, such as obstacles, and ensures sufficient coverage for accurate depth reconstruction.
    *   Synchronization Protocol: Time synchronization protocol utilizing the 5 GHz radio link to maintain sub-millisecond accuracy between drones. Master/Slave architecture, with one drone designated as the master for time distribution.
*   **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    *   Image Acquisition: Each drone captures a sequence of images synchronized with the strobe illumination.
    *   Feature Extraction: Utilize ORB, SIFT or similar feature detection algorithms to identify corresponding features across multiple images and drones.
    *   Stereo Reconstruction: Implement a modified stereo triangulation algorithm that accounts for the rapid drone movement and strobe illumination. Utilize bundle adjustment to refine the 3D reconstruction and minimize errors.
    *   Depth Map Generation: Generate a dense depth map by fusing the 3D points from all drones.
    *   Point Cloud Fusion: Fuse the depth maps into a single, coherent point cloud representing the mapped environment.
    *   Dynamic Mapping: Implement a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to track the drone's pose and update the map in real-time.

**Innovation Details:**

The key is the combination of high-speed imaging, precise strobe illumination, and swarm coordination. This allows the system to capture a 'frozen' moment in time, minimizing motion blur and enabling accurate 3D reconstruction. Utilizing multiple drones significantly increases the mapping speed and resolution. The system is robust to dynamic environments, as the high frame rate and precise synchronization mitigate the effects of motion.  The approach could be used for rapid environmental mapping, search and rescue operations, and autonomous navigation in complex environments. The 'flicker fusion' aspect aims to push the boundaries of what is perceivable via stereo vision.
