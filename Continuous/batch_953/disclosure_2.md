## Predictive Error Masking via Corelet Migration

**Concept:** Leverage the RAS state machine to not just *react* to errors, but proactively *mask* potential errors before they manifest as full-blown interrupts, utilizing a concept of "Corelets" – minimal, self-contained processing units.

**Specification:**

**I. Corelet Definition:**

*   A Corelet is a small, independently executable unit of code (e.g., a function, a loop iteration) assigned to a specific processor core.
*   Each Corelet maintains a checksum or other integrity metric, stored in a dedicated region of memory accessible by the RAS state machine.
*   Corelets are scheduled by the OS and/or hypervisor, but their execution and integrity are monitored by the RAS state machine.
*   Corelets are sized to be small enough to facilitate rapid migration between cores without significant performance overhead.

**II. RAS State Machine Enhancement:**

*   Integrate a "Predictive Error Detection" (PED) module into the RAS state machine.
*   PED continuously monitors the integrity metrics of active Corelets.
*   PED employs a statistical analysis of Corelet integrity changes.  A sudden, significant deviation triggers a "pre-emptive migration" signal.
*   PED prioritizes migration based on the criticality of the affected Corelet and the availability of healthy cores.

**III. Pre-emptive Migration Protocol:**

1.  **Detection:** PED detects a potential error in a Corelet.
2.  **Validation:** PED cross-checks the detected anomaly with other data sources (e.g., temperature sensors, voltage monitors) to minimize false positives.
3.  **Migration Initiation:** The RAS state machine requests the OS/hypervisor to migrate the affected Corelet to a healthy core.
4.  **State Transfer:** The OS/hypervisor transfers the Corelet's state (registers, memory) to the destination core.
5.  **Resumption:** The Corelet resumes execution on the new core, effectively masking the potential error.
6.  **Error Logging:** The RAS state machine logs the event for later analysis.

**IV. Hardware/Software Interaction:**

*   **Capability Register Extension:** Add a "Predictive Error Masking Enabled" bit to the RAS state machine's capability register.
*   **OS/Hypervisor API:** Provide an API for the OS/hypervisor to:
    *   Register Corelets with the RAS state machine.
    *   Receive migration requests.
    *   Report Corelet completion/failure.
*   **Dedicated Memory Region:** Allocate a dedicated memory region for Corelet integrity metrics. This region must be accessible by both the processor cores and the RAS state machine.
*   **Interrupt Handling:**  The RAS state machine utilizes a dedicated interrupt line to signal migration requests to the OS/hypervisor.

**Pseudocode (RAS State Machine - PED Module):**

```
function monitorCoreletIntegrity(coreletID, integrityMetric) {
  if (integrityMetric < threshold) {
    requestCoreletMigration(coreletID)
  }
}

function requestCoreletMigration(coreletID) {
  // Check core availability
  availableCore = findAvailableCore()

  if (availableCore != null) {
    // Signal OS to migrate coreletID to availableCore
    sendMigrationRequest(availableCore, coreletID)
    logEvent("Corelet " + coreletID + " migrated to " + availableCore)
  } else {
    logEvent("No available cores for migration")
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond *reactive* error handling to *proactive* error masking by leveraging fine-grained corelet migration. It anticipates errors before they cause system-level interrupts, potentially improving system availability and performance. It’s also unique in utilizing the RAS state machine not just for diagnostics, but for continuous runtime health maintenance.
