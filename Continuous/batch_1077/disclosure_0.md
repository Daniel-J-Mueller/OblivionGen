## Adaptive Calibration Target & Multi-Spectral Barcode System

**System Overview:**

A calibration target utilizing dynamically adjustable physical features combined with a multi-spectral barcode system for enhanced accuracy and robustness in camera focusing and 3D reconstruction. This extends beyond simple depth calibration to include material property assessment.

**Hardware Specifications:**

1.  **Calibration Target Base:** Rigid circular platform (diameter: 30cm) with integrated micro-actuators.
2.  **Adjustable “Steps”:** 10 radially distributed, physically adjustable “steps” extending outward from the base. Each step is a small planar surface (5cm x 5cm). Actuation is achieved via piezoelectric micro-actuators allowing for precise height (Z-axis) and tilt (X/Y axis) adjustment. Range of motion: Z: +/- 5mm, X/Y: +/- 2 degrees.
3.  **Multi-Spectral Barcode Array:** Each step contains an array of 20 barcodes (1cm x 1cm). These barcodes are printed using inks sensitive to multiple wavelengths of light (visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared). Each barcode encodes a step identifier, a unique barcode ID *and* a material reflectance profile at each wavelength.
4.  **Illumination Control:** Integrated multi-wavelength LED array around the camera lens to control illumination during calibration. Programmable intensity and wavelength selection.
5.  **Camera Interface:** Standard GigE Vision or USB3 camera interface.
6.  **Control Unit:** Embedded system for controlling actuators, LEDs, and data acquisition.
7.  **Power Supply:** 24V DC.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Calibration Routine:**
    *   The software initially flattens the target by setting all steps to a common Z-height.
    *   The software then systematically adjusts the height of each step independently.
    *   For each step height, the camera captures an image under different illumination wavelengths.
    *   The barcode decoder identifies all barcodes in the image.
    *   The software analyzes the decoded barcode data, including the material reflectance profile.
    *   A cost function is used to optimize the step heights and camera parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic). The cost function combines:
        *   Barcode decoding confidence.
        *   Consistency of material reflectance profiles.
        *   Sharpness metrics (as in the original patent).
    *   A parabolic fitting algorithm is employed to fine-tune the step heights.
    *   The software outputs calibrated camera parameters and a material reflectance map of the target.

2.  **Barcode Decoding Module:**
    *   Supports multiple barcode symbologies (e.g., QR code, Data Matrix, 1D barcodes).
    *   Implements advanced error correction algorithms.
    *   Handles varying lighting conditions.
    *   De-warps barcodes for optimal decoding.

3.  **Material Analysis Module:**
    *   Analyzes the material reflectance profiles to determine material properties such as color, texture, and surface finish.
    *   Allows for the creation of a material reflectance database.
    *   Utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify materials based on their reflectance profiles.

**Innovation Rationale:**

This system moves beyond simple depth calibration. By incorporating adjustable physical features *and* multi-spectral barcode analysis, it achieves:

*   **Increased Accuracy:** Actively adjustable steps compensate for manufacturing imperfections and improve calibration accuracy.
*   **Robustness to Environmental Factors:** The system is less sensitive to lighting conditions and other environmental factors.
*   **Material Property Assessment:** The multi-spectral barcode analysis allows for the assessment of material properties, opening up new applications in areas such as quality control and robotics.
*   **Dynamic Calibration:** The adjustable steps allow for dynamic calibration, meaning the system can adapt to changing conditions.
