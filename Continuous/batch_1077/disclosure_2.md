## Acoustic Scene Completion with Generative Temporal Models

**Concept:** Extend utterance detection beyond simply *identifying* speech segments to *completing* acoustic scenes, filling in gaps or reconstructing portions of audio based on learned temporal patterns. Imagine a degraded audio recording â€“ this system could plausibly reconstruct missing segments based on contextual understanding.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Input & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel audio data (microphone arrays preferred).
*   **Feature Extraction:**
    *   Compute Filterbank Energy (FBE) features as described in the patent.
    *   Calculate Interaural Time Difference (ITD) and Interaural Level Difference (ILD) features from multi-channel input. These provide spatial audio cues crucial for scene reconstruction.
    *   Compute Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) for robust speech/non-speech discrimination.

**2. Core Model - Generative Temporal Transformer (GTT):**

*   **Architecture:** A Transformer network specialized for sequential data processing, modified for generative tasks.
*   **Input Embedding:** Embed FBE, ITD/ILD, and MFCC features into a unified vector representation.
*   **Encoder:** Transformer encoder processes the embedded features, capturing temporal dependencies and acoustic scene context.
*   **Decoder:** Masked Transformer decoder generates future audio frames. During training, randomly mask segments of the input sequence and task the decoder with predicting the missing portions.
*   **Output:** Predicted audio features (FBE, ITD/ILD, MFCCs).

**3. Utterance Detection & Scene Segmentation:**

*   Integrate the existing utterance detection module (as outlined in the patent) to identify initial speech segments.
*   **Scene Segmentation Module:**  A separate module analyzes the GTT's internal representations to identify distinct acoustic events or segments within the audio. Uses a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, hierarchical clustering) on the encoder's output to group similar temporal features.
*   **Gaps Identification:** Identify silent or degraded segments within the audio stream where the utterance detection module is uncertain.

**4. Audio Reconstruction & Completion:**

*   **Conditional Generation:** When a gap is detected, condition the GTT's decoder on the preceding and following segments. The decoder generates audio features to fill the gap.  Specifically, incorporate the last N frames of the preceding segment and the first M frames of the following segment as context for the decoder.
*   **Feature Conversion:** Convert the generated audio features (FBE, MFCCs) back into a waveform using a vocoder or WaveNet-style generative model.

**5. Training Procedure:**

*   **Dataset:**  A large dataset of diverse audio scenes with both clean and corrupted audio recordings. Include examples of overlapping speech, background noise, and varying acoustic environments.
*   **Loss Function:**
    *   **Reconstruction Loss:** Mean Squared Error (MSE) or L1 loss between the generated and original audio features.
    *   **Adversarial Loss:** Use a discriminator network to encourage the generated audio to be more realistic.
    *   **Perceptual Loss:**  Use pre-trained audio classification models to compare the perceptual characteristics of the generated and original audio.
*   **Training Stages:**
    1.  Train the utterance detection module.
    2.  Train the GTT on clean audio data.
    3.  Fine-tune the GTT on corrupted audio data, incorporating the adversarial and perceptual losses.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Step):**

```
function reconstruct_audio(input_audio, gap_start, gap_end):
  # 1. Feature Extraction
  features = extract_features(input_audio)

  # 2. Utterance Detection & Gap Identification (from patent)
  utterance_segments = detect_utterances(features)
  gap_indices = find_gaps(utterance_segments, gap_start, gap_end)

  # 3. Extract Context
  context_before = features[max(0, gap_start - CONTEXT_SIZE) : gap_start]
  context_after = features[gap_end : min(len(features), gap_end + CONTEXT_SIZE)]

  # 4. Generate Missing Features
  generated_features = generate_features(context_before, context_after, gap_start, gap_end)

  # 5. Feature Conversion (Vocoder or WaveNet)
  reconstructed_audio = convert_features_to_audio(generated_features)

  return reconstructed_audio
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Restoration of damaged audio recordings.
*   Enhancement of speech recognition in noisy environments.
*   Creation of immersive audio experiences.
*   Audio forensics and evidence reconstruction.
