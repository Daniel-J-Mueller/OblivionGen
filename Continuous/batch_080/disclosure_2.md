## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Video Summarization

**Concept:** Extend the existing video summarization process by integrating real-time emotional analysis of both the video content *and* the viewer. This allows the system to dynamically adjust the summarization – clip selection, pacing, music – to maximize emotional impact and engagement.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotional Analysis Modules:**
    *   **Video Analysis:** Integrate computer vision algorithms to detect facial expressions, body language, scene characteristics (color palettes, camera movement), and audio cues (speech prosody, music genre) within the video clips. Output: A time-series “Emotional Profile” for each clip, representing the intensity of emotions like joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and neutrality, scored from 0-1.
    *   **Viewer Analysis:** Utilize a wearable sensor (e.g., smart watch, EEG headset) or webcam-based facial expression recognition to monitor the viewer’s physiological signals (heart rate, skin conductance, facial muscle movements) in real-time. Output: A time-series “Viewer Emotional State” representing the viewer’s emotional response to the video, scored 0-1 for each emotion.
2.  **Resonance Mapping Algorithm:**
    *   Define “Emotional Distance” between a clip’s Emotional Profile and the Viewer Emotional State.  Distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences for each emotion category, normalized by the total number of emotion categories.
    *   Implement a feedback loop:
        *   During summarization playback, continuously calculate the Emotional Distance.
        *   If the Emotional Distance exceeds a threshold, the algorithm searches for alternative clips that minimize the distance.  This search prioritizes clips with similar emotional peaks/valleys but avoids prolonged emotional monotony.
        *   Algorithm modulates the `pacing` variable from the input patent. Fast pacing when the Emotional Distance is high, and slower pacing when the Emotional Distance is low.
3.  **Dynamic Music Selection:**
    *   Maintain a library of music tracks categorized by emotional valence (positive/negative) and arousal (high/low).
    *   Based on the *combined* emotional state (video + viewer), select music tracks that either *amplify* the current emotion (for heightened impact) or *counterbalance* it (to create emotional contrast).
    *   Seamless transitions between music tracks are triggered dynamically based on emotional shifts within the summarization.
4.  **Configuration Parameters (adjustable by the user):**
    *   **Emotional Sensitivity:** Controls the threshold for the Emotional Distance. Higher sensitivity means the algorithm will be more responsive to even small changes in the viewer’s emotional state.
    *   **Emotional Style:** Allows the user to select a desired “emotional style” for the summarization (e.g., “maximize joy”, “create suspense”, “evoke nostalgia”).
    *   **Music Preference:** Enables the user to specify preferred music genres or artists.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize
video_clips = [clip1, clip2, clip3, ...];
viewer_emotional_state = initial_state;
current_clip = clip1;
edit_decision_list = [];

// Main Loop
while (summarization_not_complete):

    // 1. Analyze current_clip's emotional profile
    clip_emotional_profile = analyze_emotion(current_clip);

    // 2. Calculate emotional distance
    emotional_distance = calculate_distance(clip_emotional_profile, viewer_emotional_state);

    // 3. Determine if clip should be selected
    if (emotional_distance < threshold):
        // Clip aligns with viewer's emotional state
        edit_decision_list.append(current_clip);
        //Update viewer_emotional_state based on the clip
        viewer_emotional_state = update_state(viewer_emotional_state, clip_emotional_profile)
    else:
        // Search for alternative clip that minimizes distance
        best_clip = find_best_clip(video_clips, viewer_emotional_state)
        if best_clip != null:
           edit_decision_list.append(best_clip)
           viewer_emotional_state = update_state(viewer_emotional_state, best_clip)
        else:
           //no suitable clip found, select a neutral clip or skip
           skip_clip()

    // 4. Update pacing and music selection
    pacing = adjust_pacing(emotional_distance)
    music = select_music(pacing, viewer_emotional_state)

    // 5. Transition to next clip
    current_clip = get_next_clip()
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Personalized Summarization: Learn individual viewer emotional preferences over time to create highly customized summaries.
*   Adaptive Storytelling: Use emotional analysis to dynamically adjust the narrative structure of the summary.
*   Emotional Advertising:  Integrate emotionally-relevant advertisements into the summary at optimal moments.
