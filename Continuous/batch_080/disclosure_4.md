## Dynamic Skill-Based Contact Center Routing & Agent Augmentation

**Concept:** Extend the contact center onboarding to dynamically assess and route calls based on *real-time* agent skill assessment – moving beyond predefined profiles. Simultaneously augment agent capabilities *during* calls using integrated AI tools triggered by call content.

**Specifications:**

**1. Skill Assessment Module:**

*   **Integration:** Connects to existing onboarding service.  Following initial user/agent creation, initiates a continuous skill assessment process.
*   **Assessment Methods:**
    *   **Voice Analysis:** Real-time analysis of agent speech during simulated/training calls. Measures metrics like clarity, empathy, pace, and adherence to scripts.
    *   **Knowledge Checks:** Periodic, short, adaptive quizzes presented *during downtime* to gauge knowledge of products/services. Question difficulty adjusts based on performance.
    *   **Call Transcript Analysis (Post-Call):** AI-powered analysis of call transcripts to identify skill gaps. Focus on accurate information delivery, problem-solving techniques, and compliance adherence.
*   **Skill Matrix:**  Maintains a dynamic skill matrix for each agent, tracking proficiency in various areas (product knowledge, negotiation, de-escalation, technical support, etc.).  Skills are rated on a granular scale (1-10).
*   **API Integration:** Exposes an API to allow the routing engine access to real-time skill data.

**2. Dynamic Routing Engine:**

*   **Call Classification:** Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify incoming calls based on intent, topic, and urgency.
*   **Skill Matching:** Matches call classifications to agent skill profiles, prioritizing agents with the highest relevant skill scores.
*   **Real-time Adjustment:**  Continuously monitors agent performance *during* the call (see Agent Augmentation below) and dynamically adjusts routing decisions if needed.  If an agent struggles with a specific issue, the call can be silently transferred to a more qualified agent.
*   **Weighted Scoring:** Incorporates factors beyond skill, such as agent availability, workload, and historical performance metrics (e.g., average handle time, customer satisfaction).

**3. Agent Augmentation Module:**

*   **Real-Time Transcription:** Transcribes the call in real-time.
*   **Keyword/Intent Detection:**  Identifies key topics, customer sentiment, and potential issues using NLP.
*   **Knowledge Base Integration:** Automatically surfaces relevant knowledge base articles, FAQs, or troubleshooting guides based on the call content. Displayed on the agent’s screen.
*   **Automated Script Suggestions:**  Provides agents with suggested responses or talking points based on the detected customer intent.
*   **Compliance Alerts:**  Flags potential compliance violations (e.g., disclosure requirements) based on the call transcript.
*   **Sentiment Analysis & Coaching Prompts:**  Provides real-time feedback to the agent on their tone and empathy levels. Suggests phrases to improve rapport and de-escalate tense situations.
*   **Automated Task Creation:** If the call reveals a need for follow-up actions (e.g., escalating a bug report, processing a refund), automatically creates a task in a CRM system.

**Pseudocode (Routing Engine):**

```
function routeCall(call) {
  classification = classifyCall(call);
  availableAgents = getAvailableAgents();
  bestAgent = null;
  highestSkillScore = -1;

  for each agent in availableAgents {
    skillScore = calculateSkillScore(agent, classification);
    if (skillScore > highestSkillScore) {
      highestSkillScore = skillScore;
      bestAgent = agent;
    }
  }

  if (bestAgent != null) {
    connectCall(call, bestAgent);
    startAgentAugmentation(call, bestAgent);
  } else {
    // Queue the call or escalate to a supervisor
  }
}
```

**Expansion Potential:**

*   **Proactive Skill Development:**  Based on identified skill gaps, automatically assign relevant training modules to agents.
*   **Personalized Coaching:** Provide personalized coaching recommendations to agents based on their performance data.
*   **Gamification:**  Introduce gamification elements to incentivize skill development and improve agent engagement.
*   **Integration with Workforce Management Systems:**  Optimize staffing levels based on predicted call volumes and skill requirements.
