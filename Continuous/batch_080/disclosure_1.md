## Dynamic Focus Stacking for Enhanced Video Summarization

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of focusing on faces/objects in video, but instead of simply cropping or creating split screens, employ dynamic focus stacking across multiple frames to create a visually striking and informative summary. This goes beyond simply highlighting *where* faces are, and begins to synthesize information about *how* they appear – expression, relative distance, and even subtle movements – to create a more compelling narrative.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Input:** Standard video data stream.
*   **Face/Object Detection:** Utilize existing face/object detection algorithms (as in the provided patent) to identify key entities within each frame.
*   **Depth Estimation:** Implement a depth estimation algorithm (e.g., using stereo vision principles or monocular depth prediction using AI) to determine the distance of detected faces/objects from the camera.  Accuracy is paramount; consider multi-frame refinement.
*   **Expression Analysis:**  Integrate facial expression recognition to identify and categorize facial expressions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, neutral).
*   **Motion Vector Analysis:** Analyze motion vectors within the video to track movement of detected faces/objects.

**2. Dynamic Focus Stack Generation:**

*   **Frame Selection:**  Select a series of frames based on:
    *   Significant changes in facial expression.
    *   Notable movement of faces/objects.
    *   Changes in depth (indicating approaching/receding subjects).
    *   Priority metrics from the existing patent.
*   **Depth Map Creation:**  Generate a depth map for each selected frame. This map assigns a depth value to each pixel, representing its distance from the camera.
*   **Focus Region Definition:** Based on the detected faces/objects and their depth values, define a “focus region” for each frame. This region should encompass the face/object, with a blurred gradient surrounding it to emphasize the subject.
*   **Stack Composition:**  Create a stacked image by composing the selected frames.
    *   The 'base' layer is the frame with the highest 'priority metric' (from the existing patent).
    *   Subsequent frames are blended in based on the change in facial expression, movement, or depth. Larger changes equate to more significant blending. 
    *   Utilize blending modes (e.g., 'overlay,' 'soft light') to create visually appealing transitions.
*   **Dynamic Masking:**  Apply a dynamic mask to each frame *before* blending. This mask focuses attention on the face/object while subtly blurring the background.  The mask’s intensity should correspond to the “change” metric – greater change = stronger focus.

**3. Summary Generation:**

*   **Temporal Smoothing:** Apply a temporal smoothing filter to the stacked image sequence to reduce jitter and create a more coherent summary.
*   **Keyframe Extraction:** Extract keyframes from the smoothed sequence based on the magnitude of change in the stacked image.  (Significant changes in the stacked image indicate important moments).
*   **Output:**  Generate a video summary consisting of the extracted keyframes, displayed with optional captions or annotations.

**Pseudocode (Keyframe Extraction):**

```
function extractKeyframes(stackedImageSequence, changeThreshold):
  keyframeList = []
  previousFrame = stackedImageSequence[0]
  keyframeList.append(previousFrame)

  for currentFrame in stackedImageSequence[1:]:
    frameDifference = calculateFrameDifference(currentFrame, previousFrame)
    if frameDifference > changeThreshold:
      keyframeList.append(currentFrame)
    previousFrame = currentFrame

  return keyframeList
```

**Possible Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Scene Understanding:** Integrate AI to analyze the scene content and select frames that highlight important events or interactions.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to adjust the `changeThreshold` and other parameters to fine-tune the summary generation process.
*   **3D Reconstruction:**  Leverage depth information to create a 3D reconstruction of the scene, allowing for dynamic camera movements and different viewing angles.
