## Dynamic Scene Complexity Adjustment via Procedural Detail Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the deferred rendering approach by dynamically adjusting scene geometric detail based on player proximity and rendering budget, synthesizing new geometry procedurally *during* rendering. This moves beyond simple Level of Detail (LOD) switching.

**Specification:**

1.  **Scene Graph Augmentation:** Modify the scene graph to include "Detail Blocks." These blocks represent regions of the scene (e.g., a section of wall, a patch of ground) that can receive procedural detail. Each Detail Block holds base geometry (low-poly) and parameters controlling procedural synthesis.

2.  **Procedural Synthesis Modules:** Implement a library of procedural synthesis modules (PSMs). Examples:
    *   *Brick PSM:* Generates brick patterns on surfaces.
    *   *Foliage PSM:* Populates areas with plants based on biome parameters.
    *   *Debris PSM:* Adds rubble and clutter to surfaces.
    *   *Surface Imperfection PSM:* Creates cracks, stains, and wear.

3.  **Rendering Pipeline Integration:**
    *   **Frustum/View Distance Culling:** Standard culling to determine visible Detail Blocks.
    *   **Proximity Trigger:** When a player enters a defined proximity range of a Detail Block, trigger procedural synthesis.
    *   **Rendering Budget Monitor:** Monitor GPU load and available rendering budget.
    *   **Dynamic Synthesis Control:** Based on proximity *and* rendering budget, select appropriate PSMs and synthesis parameters for the Detail Block.  Prioritize PSMs based on visual impact and performance cost.
    *   **Real-time Mesh Generation:** Generate new geometry *during* the rasterization stage.  This requires asynchronous mesh generation and potentially streaming to the GPU.  Utilize compute shaders for efficient mesh creation.
    *   **Deferred Rendering Integration:** The generated geometry is immediately incorporated into the deferred rendering buffers (depth, normal, color, etc.).

**Pseudocode (Compute Shader - Simplified):**

```glsl
// Input: Detail Block parameters, player position, rendering budget
// Output: New mesh data (vertex positions, normals, UVs)

layout(local_size_x = 16, local_size_y = 16) in;

struct DetailBlockParams {
  float minDetailLevel;
  float maxDetailLevel;
  int   psmType; // Brick, Foliage, etc.
};

shared DetailBlockParams blockParams;

void main() {
  uint gid = gl_GlobalInvocationID.x + gl_GlobalInvocationID.y * gl_NumWorkGroups.x * gl_WorkGroupSize.x;

  // Calculate detail level based on player distance and budget
  float detailLevel = calculateDetailLevel(playerDistance, renderingBudget, blockParams.minDetailLevel, blockParams.maxDetailLevel);

  // Generate geometry based on detailLevel and psmType
  vec3 vertexPosition = generateVertexPosition(gid, detailLevel, blockParams.psmType);
  vec3 vertexNormal = calculateVertexNormal(vertexPosition, blockParams.psmType);
  vec2 uvCoordinates = generateUVCoordinates(detailLevel, blockParams.psmType);

  // Store geometry data in a buffer (to be read by the rendering pipeline)
  // ...buffer write operations...
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DetailBlock`: Contains base geometry, PSM selection, min/max detail levels, proximity trigger radius.
*   `PSMParameters`: Parameters specific to each procedural synthesis module (e.g., brick size, foliage density).
*   `RenderingBudget`: Current GPU load, available memory, and rendering time.

**Benefits:**

*   **Dynamic Visual Fidelity:**  Adjusts detail levels dynamically, optimizing performance without sacrificing visual quality.
*   **Reduced Asset Creation:**  Procedural generation reduces the need for pre-made assets.
*   **Improved Immersion:**  Adds subtle details and variations to the scene, enhancing realism.
*   **Scalability:**  Can be scaled to handle complex scenes and varying hardware configurations.
