## Adaptive Message Prioritization & Tiered Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the existing polling resource management to incorporate dynamic message prioritization *within* the message queues themselves, coupled with tiered resource allocation based on priority. This creates a system where critical messages aren't just processed faster, but actively *guarantee* latency bounds, while lower-priority messages absorb excess capacity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Message Priority Metadata:**

*   Each message placed in a queue must include a priority field (integer, 0-100, 0 = lowest, 100 = highest).
*   Applications *must* adhere to defined priority guidelines (documentation provided).  Violation triggers logging/alerting.
*   A default priority level is assigned if no priority is explicitly set (configurable per queue).

**2. Queue Segmentation:**

*   Each message queue is internally segmented into priority tiers corresponding to the priority levels (e.g., Tier 0, Tier 1…Tier 10).
*   Messages are placed into their respective tiers upon queue insertion.

**3. Polling Strategy Modification:**

*   Polling threads now prioritize polling *from higher-priority tiers first*.
*   Each tier has a configurable polling frequency multiplier.  (e.g., Tier 10 = 5x frequency of Tier 0).
*   A "starvation threshold" is defined per tier. If a tier hasn’t yielded a message within a set timeframe, its polling frequency is temporarily boosted, even if lower tiers have messages.

**4. Tiered Resource Allocation:**

*   The system maintains a pool of "priority tokens."  These tokens represent guaranteed polling/invoke thread capacity.
*   Each priority tier is allocated a fixed number of priority tokens (configurable).  Higher priority tiers receive more tokens.
*   Polling/invoke threads "consume" priority tokens when processing messages from a specific tier.
*   If a tier runs out of priority tokens, its messages are queued until tokens become available.
*   Unused priority tokens can be dynamically reallocated to higher-priority tiers (or pooled for burst capacity).

**5. Dynamic Token Adjustment:**

*   A monitoring component tracks message arrival rates, processing times, and latency for each priority tier.
*   Based on real-time data, the system can dynamically adjust the number of priority tokens allocated to each tier (within predefined limits).
*   This adjustment is governed by a policy engine (configurable), which can prioritize responsiveness, throughput, or fairness.

**6. Invocation Tiering:**

*   Invoke threads are also tiered.  High-priority messages are routed to dedicated, high-performance invoke threads. Lower-priority messages utilize a shared pool.
*   This further isolates critical function executions.

**Pseudocode (simplified adjustment policy):**

```
function adjustPriorityTokens(queue) {
  currentLatency = getAverageLatency(queue);
  targetLatency = getConfiguredTargetLatency(queue);

  if (currentLatency > targetLatency) {
    // Increase token allocation
    tokenDelta = calculateTokenDelta(currentLatency - targetLatency);
    allocateMoreTokens(queue, tokenDelta);
  } else if (currentLatency < targetLatency * 0.8) {
    // Decrease token allocation (if possible)
    tokenDelta = calculateTokenDelta(targetLatency - currentLatency);
    reallocateTokens(queue, tokenDelta);
  }
}

function calculateTokenDelta(latencyDifference) {
  // Logic to determine token adjustment based on latency difference
  // (Consider factors like queue priority and resource availability)
  return latencyDifference * scalingFactor;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Message` class:  `priority` (int), `payload`, `queueId`
*   `Queue` class: `queueId`, `priorityTiers` (array of `Tier` objects), `pollingFrequencyMultiplier` (for each tier)
*   `Tier` class: `priorityLevel`, `messages` (queue), `availableTokens`
*   `PriorityTokenPool`: `totalTokens`, `allocatedTokens`, `availableTokens`
