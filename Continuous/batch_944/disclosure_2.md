**Dynamic Bundle Personalization via Temporal Affinity**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Expand upon pairwise and tri-pairwise bundle suggestions by incorporating a temporal dimension to user affinity. Instead of static bundle recommendations based solely on co-purchase frequency, dynamically adjust bundle compositions based on *when* items are frequently purchased together. This leverages the understanding that buying patterns shift based on time of year, current events, promotional periods, or even individual user habits.

**II. Data Requirements:**

*   **Detailed Purchase History:** Timestamped purchase data for each user, extending beyond simple purchase/no-purchase.
*   **Item Metadata:** Comprehensive item attributes (category, price, description, seasonality, etc.).
*   **External Event Data:** APIs or feeds providing information on holidays, major events, weather patterns, and potentially even news trends.
*   **User Demographic Data** (optional): Age, location, etc. to refine temporal models.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Temporal Affinity Engine:**  A module responsible for calculating temporal affinity scores between items. This will involve:
    *   **Time Series Creation:** For each item pair (and potentially triplets), create a time series representing co-purchase frequency (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Employ time series correlation techniques (e.g., Dynamic Time Warping, Pearson correlation on rolling windows) to identify periods of strong co-purchase.
    *   **Seasonality Detection:** Identify recurring patterns in co-purchase frequency to determine seasonality.
    *   **Event Correlation:**  Analyze correlations between item co-purchase and external event data (e.g., spike in BBQ grill and burger purchases during summer months, increased sales of umbrellas during rainy weeks).

2.  **Bundle Recommendation Engine:**
    *   **Baseline Bundle Calculation:**  Maintain the existing system for calculating static bundle recommendations based on overall co-purchase frequency.
    *   **Temporal Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjust the baseline bundle recommendations based on the temporal affinity scores calculated by the Temporal Affinity Engine.
    *   **Personalization:**  Further personalize bundle recommendations based on individual user purchase history and potentially demographic data.

3.  **Real-time Recommendation Service:**
    *   **API Endpoint:** Expose an API endpoint that receives user ID and item ID as input and returns a list of recommended bundle items, dynamically adjusted based on temporal affinity and personalization.

**IV. Pseudocode - Real-time Bundle Recommendation:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION GetBundleRecommendations(userID, itemID):
  // 1. Get Baseline Bundle Recommendations
  baselineBundles = GetBaselineBundles(itemID)

  // 2. Calculate Temporal Affinity Scores
  currentDate = GetCurrentDate()
  temporalAffinityScores = CalculateTemporalAffinityScores(itemID, currentDate)

  // 3. Personalize Recommendations
  userHistory = GetUserPurchaseHistory(userID)
  personalizedScores = CalculatePersonalizedScores(itemID, userHistory)

  // 4. Combine Scores
  combinedScores = (0.6 * temporalAffinityScores) + (0.4 * personalizedScores)

  // 5. Sort and Filter Recommendations
  sortedBundles = SortBundlesByScore(baselineBundles, combinedScores)
  filteredBundles = FilterBundles(sortedBundles, availability, price limits)

  RETURN filteredBundles
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateTemporalAffinityScores(itemID, currentDate):
  // Access Temporal Affinity Engine
  affinityScores = TemporalAffinityEngine.GetScores(itemID, currentDate)
  RETURN affinityScores
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculatePersonalizedScores(itemID, userHistory):
  // Analyze user purchase history
  personalizedScores = UserPreferenceEngine.GetScores(itemID, userHistory)
  RETURN personalizedScores
END FUNCTION
```

**V.  Considerations:**

*   **Cold Start Problem:** Develop strategies for handling new items or users with limited purchase history (e.g., leverage item metadata or demographic data).
*   **Data Scalability:** Design the system to handle large volumes of purchase data and real-time requests.
*   **A/B Testing:** Conduct A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the temporal bundle recommendations compared to the baseline recommendations.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Implement dynamic thresholds for temporal affinity scores to adapt to changing market conditions and user behavior.
