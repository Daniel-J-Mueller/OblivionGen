## Dynamic Credential 'Lifecycles' Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust credential validity – and access rights – not just based on time-based expiration, but a continuously assessed ‘trust score’ derived from behavioral biometrics.

**Core Concept:**  The patent focuses on credential properties influencing access. This expands that by *actively monitoring* user behavior during authentication and authorization to refine the credential's effective ‘lifecycle’. Instead of a fixed expiration, the system adapts access in real-time.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometric Engine:** Captures and analyzes user interaction data: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, typing cadence, device orientation changes, touch pressure (if applicable), and even subtle variations in network latency. This data forms the basis of a ‘behavioral profile’.

2.  **Trust Score Calculator:**  Compares current user behavior against the established behavioral profile.  A deviation from the norm lowers the trust score, while consistent behavior maintains or increases it. The score is normalized to a scale of 0-100.

3.  **Dynamic Access Policy Engine:**  This is the core of the innovation. It maps the trust score to access control levels.  Instead of simple 'allow/deny', access is granular. 

    *   **Score 90-100:** Full access, extended credential validity window.
    *   **Score 70-89:** Standard access, normal credential validity.
    *   **Score 50-69:** Reduced access (e.g., read-only), shorter credential validity, potential for multi-factor authentication challenge.
    *   **Score 30-49:** Very limited access, immediate MFA challenge, potential session termination.
    *   **Score 0-29:** Access denied, credential locked.

4.  **Credential Property Augmentation:** Existing credential properties (complexity, update frequency, resource security) are *combined* with the continuously updated trust score to create a comprehensive 'dynamic credential profile'.

**Pseudocode – Access Control Logic:**

```
function determineAccess(authorizationRequest, credentialProfile, resourcePolicy) {

  trustScore = credentialProfile.trustScore;
  credentialComplexity = credentialProfile.complexity;
  resourceSecurityLevel = resourcePolicy.securityLevel;

  //Combine factors to calculate an effectiveAccessLevel
  effectiveAccessLevel = (trustScore * 0.5) + (credentialComplexity * 0.3) + (resourceSecurityLevel * 0.2);

  // Map effectiveAccessLevel to access rights
  if (effectiveAccessLevel >= 90) {
    accessRights = "full";
  } else if (effectiveAccessLevel >= 70) {
    accessRights = "standard";
  } else if (effectiveAccessLevel >= 50) {
    accessRights = "read_only";
    //Trigger MFA challenge if not already authenticated
    if (!isAuthenticated()) {
      triggerMFA();
    }
  } else {
    accessRights = "denied";
    //Lock credential and require reset
    lockCredential();
  }

  return accessRights;
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Behavioral Biometric Engine requires a baseline learning period to establish an accurate behavioral profile.
*   The weighting factors in the `determineAccess` function can be adjusted based on organizational security policies.
*   MFA challenges should be adaptive – using different methods based on the severity of the access attempt and the user’s risk profile.
*   The system should log all access attempts, trust score changes, and MFA challenges for auditing and security analysis.
*   Data privacy considerations are paramount – behavioral data should be anonymized and securely stored.
