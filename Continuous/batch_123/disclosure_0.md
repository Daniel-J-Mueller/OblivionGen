## Dynamic Foveated Rendering with Predictive Gaze-Contingent Texture Streaming

**Concept:** Expand on the predictive rendering by incorporating high-resolution texture streaming *only* to the user’s predicted foveated region. This significantly reduces bandwidth and processing load while maintaining perceived visual fidelity where the user is looking.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Eye-Tracking Module:** High-precision, low-latency eye-tracking integrated into the AR headset. Minimum sampling rate: 120Hz. Data output: 2D gaze vector (normalized screen coordinates) + pupil diameter + confidence score.
*   **High-Bandwidth Wireless Link:** Wi-Fi 7 or equivalent, capable of sustained 1Gbps+ throughput.
*   **Dedicated Image Processing Unit (IPU):** A co-processor optimized for texture decompression and rendering.  Must support multiple concurrent decompression streams.
*   **AR Headset Display:**  High-resolution micro-OLED display with per-eye rendering capability. Minimum resolution: 8K per eye.  Support for variable refresh rate.

**II. Software Architecture:**

*   **Predictive Gaze Engine (PGE):**
    *   **Input:** Eye-tracking data stream, historical gaze data, environmental context (depth map, semantic segmentation).
    *   **Algorithm:** Kalman filter or recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict future gaze position over a short time horizon (50-100ms).
    *   **Output:** Predicted gaze position (x, y) with associated confidence score. Also outputs a ‘focus radius’ indicating the area of high-visual interest.
*   **Texture Streaming Manager (TSM):**
    *   **Input:** Predicted gaze position, focus radius, environmental context, available bandwidth.
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  **Region of Interest (ROI) Definition:** Determine the ROI based on the predicted gaze position and focus radius.  This ROI defines the area requiring high-resolution textures.
        2.  **Texture Prioritization:** Prioritize texture requests based on:
            *   ROI overlap.
            *   Texture size.
            *   Texture importance (determined by semantic segmentation – e.g., textures on faces are prioritized over textures on walls).
        3.  **Dynamic Texture Resolution:** Request different texture resolutions for different parts of the scene based on distance from the predicted gaze point.  Utilize a multi-resolution texture pyramid.
        4.  **Progressive Texture Streaming:** Stream textures in progressively higher detail as bandwidth allows.  Use a tile-based streaming approach.
        5.  **Caching:** Cache frequently accessed textures locally to reduce latency and bandwidth usage.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:**
    *   Modify the rendering pipeline to sample textures from the streamed data.
    *   Implement a blending mechanism to smoothly transition between different texture resolutions.
    *   Integrate the rendering pipeline with the PGE and TSM to ensure seamless operation.

**III. Pseudocode (TSM Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function UpdateTextureStream(predictedGaze, focusRadius, bandwidthAvailable) {
  // 1. Define Region of Interest (ROI)
  roi = CalculateROI(predictedGaze, focusRadius);

  // 2. Calculate Texture Priorities
  texturePriorities = CalculateTexturePriorities(sceneTextures, roi);

  // 3. Determine Texture Resolutions
  textureResolutions = DetermineTextureResolutions(texturePriorities, bandwidthAvailable);

  // 4. Request Texture Tiles
  RequestTextureTiles(textureResolutions);

  // 5. Update Texture Cache
  UpdateTextureCache(receivedTextureTiles);

  // 6. Apply textures to rendering pipeline.
}
```

**IV.  Innovation & Differentiation:**

*   **Bandwidth Optimization:**  Significantly reduces bandwidth requirements by only streaming high-resolution textures to the foveated region.
*   **Perceived Visual Fidelity:** Maintains high visual fidelity where the user is looking, while reducing the visual impact of lower-resolution textures in the periphery.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Adapts to changing bandwidth conditions and user behavior in real-time.
*   **Scalability:**  Can be scaled to support a wide range of AR applications and devices.
