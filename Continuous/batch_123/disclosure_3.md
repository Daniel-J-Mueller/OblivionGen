## Dynamic Data Lineage & Predictive Quorum Adjustment

**Concept:** Enhance the quorum system with a dynamic lineage tracking mechanism for data and a predictive system to proactively adjust quorum membership based on data access patterns and potential node failures.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Lineage Tracker:**

*   **Component:**  `LineageService` – A dedicated microservice responsible for tracking the history of data modifications.
*   **Data Structure:**  `LineageGraph` – A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where:
    *   Nodes represent data objects (identified by unique key).
    *   Edges represent transformations (writes, updates, etc.) applied to the data.  Edge metadata includes timestamp, originating node, and applied operation.
*   **Integration with Write Operations:** The `LineageService` intercepts all write requests *before* they reach the quorum set.  It constructs or updates the `LineageGraph` based on the write operation.  This lineage information is attached as metadata to the write request *before* forwarding to the quorum.
*   **Querying Lineage:** API endpoints for querying lineage:
    *   `getLineage(dataKey)` – Returns the lineage graph for a specific data object.
    *   `getAffectedNodes(nodeKey, timeRange)` – Returns a list of data objects affected by a specific node within a time range.

**2. Predictive Quorum Adjustment:**

*   **Component:**  `QuorumPredictor` – A service that analyzes the `LineageGraph` and historical node performance to predict future access patterns and potential node failures.
*   **Metrics Collected:**
    *   **Access Frequency:**  How often is each data object accessed?
    *   **Access Locality:** Which nodes typically access which data objects?
    *   **Node Performance:** CPU load, memory usage, network latency, disk I/O.
    *   **Node Failure Rate:** Historical data on node failures.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** A combination of time series analysis (for access patterns) and machine learning (for node failure prediction).  Consider using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model temporal dependencies in access patterns.
*   **Quorum Adjustment Strategy:**
    *   **Hot Data Partitioning:**  Frequently accessed data is replicated across more nodes, increasing read performance.
    *   **Cold Data Consolidation:** Infrequently accessed data is replicated across fewer nodes, reducing storage overhead.
    *   **Failure Prediction:** If a node is predicted to fail, its replicas are proactively increased on other nodes *before* the failure occurs.
*   **Adjustment Trigger:** The `QuorumPredictor` periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) analyzes the metrics and triggers quorum adjustments if necessary.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Quorum adjustments are performed using a rolling update strategy to minimize disruption to the system.
    *   The `QuorumPredictor` communicates with the quorum management system to initiate the adjustments.
    *   Consider implementing a feedback loop to refine the prediction algorithm based on the accuracy of previous predictions.

**3.  Integration with Existing Quorum System:**

*   The `LineageService` and `QuorumPredictor` are deployed as separate microservices.
*   The existing quorum management system is modified to accept adjustment requests from the `QuorumPredictor`.
*   Write requests are intercepted by the `LineageService` *before* reaching the quorum set.
*   The `QuorumPredictor` periodically analyzes data and makes adjustment recommendations.
*   A new API endpoint is exposed to allow manual override of quorum adjustments.



**Pseudocode (QuorumPredictor):**

```pseudocode
function analyzeData():
  accessPatterns = getAccessPatternsFromLineageGraph()
  nodePerformance = getNodePerformanceMetrics()
  failurePredictions = predictNodeFailures(nodePerformance)

  for dataObject in accessPatterns:
    if accessFrequency(dataObject) > threshold:
      recommendQuorumIncrease(dataObject)
    else:
      recommendQuorumDecrease(dataObject)

  for node in failurePredictions:
    if probabilityOfFailure(node) > threshold:
      proactivelyIncreaseReplicas(node)
```
