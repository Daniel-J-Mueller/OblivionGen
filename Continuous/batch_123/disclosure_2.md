## Dynamic Behavior Contracts & Predictive UI

**Concept:** Extend the existing behavior/data mapping system to include *predictive* UI element generation based on learned user interaction patterns *and* dynamically adjusted behavior contracts. The core idea is to anticipate user needs and proactively offer relevant behaviors *before* explicit requests are made, adapting the 'contract' of what behaviors are even *available* based on context.

**Specs:**

**1. User Interaction Profiler:**

*   **Data Input:** Captures all user interactions with UI elements – clicks, hovers, form inputs, time spent on page sections, etc.  This is a persistent profile, ideally anonymized/pseudonymized for privacy.
*   **Analysis Engine:**  Uses machine learning (specifically, sequence modeling like LSTMs or Transformers) to identify common user interaction sequences. Focus on ‘behavioral pathways’ – what actions typically follow others.
*   **Output:** A probabilistic model of user behavior, expressed as a ‘Behavioral Expectation Score’ for each potential behavior element given the current context.

**2. Dynamic Behavior Contract Manager:**

*   **Input:**  Receives the ‘Behavioral Expectation Score’ from the User Interaction Profiler, the existing data contract for behavior elements, and *external* context (time of day, user location, device type, current marketplace conditions - mirroring existing patent points).
*   **Logic:** 
    *   Filters behavior elements based on compatibility with the current data element (as per existing patent).
    *   Adjusts the ‘Behavioral Availability Score’ of each compatible element based on the Behavioral Expectation Score *and* external context.  Elements with high expectation and relevant context get boosted.
    *   Dynamically rewrites the behavior contract, limiting the presented options to a curated subset.  This avoids overwhelming the user with irrelevant choices.
*   **Output:** A modified behavior contract, prioritizing likely-to-be-used elements.

**3. Predictive UI Generator:**

*   **Input:** Receives the modified behavior contract and the Document Object Model (DOM).
*   **Logic:**
    *   Proactively renders UI elements (buttons, tooltips, helper text, etc.) corresponding to the top-ranked behavior elements in the modified contract. This happens *before* the user explicitly requests the behavior.
    *   These elements are visually distinct (e.g., subtly highlighted, animated) to indicate they are ‘predicted’ suggestions.
    *   The UI generator applies a ‘Confidence Threshold’ – only suggestions with a high enough Confidence Score (derived from the Confidence Threshold) are rendered.
*   **Output:** A modified DOM with proactively rendered predictive UI elements.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// User Interaction Profiler
function analyzeUserInteraction(interactionData) {
  // ML model to predict next behavior
  predictedBehavior = model.predict(interactionData)
  return predictedBehavior
}

// Dynamic Behavior Contract Manager
function createDynamicContract(dataElement, behaviorElements, userPrediction, externalContext) {
  filteredBehaviorElements = filterByCompatibility(dataElement, behaviorElements)
  scoredBehaviorElements = scoreBehaviors(filteredBehaviorElements, userPrediction, externalContext)
  dynamicContract = selectTopN(scoredBehaviorElements, N=5) // or other dynamic value
  return dynamicContract
}

// Predictive UI Generator
function generatePredictiveUI(DOM, dynamicContract) {
  for each behavior in dynamicContract {
    // create UI element for behavior
    uiElement = createUIElement(behavior)
    // inject UI element into DOM at appropriate location
    injectUIElement(DOM, uiElement)
  }
  return DOM
}
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simply mapping existing behaviors to data.  It *anticipates* user needs and proactively surfaces potentially relevant actions. The dynamic contract management and predictive UI generation create a more fluid and intuitive user experience.  It introduces an element of *intelligent assistance* beyond what is implied in the original patent. The system adapts *itself* based on user behavior, not just reacting to explicit requests.
