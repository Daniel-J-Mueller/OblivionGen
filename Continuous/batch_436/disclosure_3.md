## Dynamic Recommendation ‘Worlds’

**Concept:** Expand beyond segmented recommendation sections on a single page to create navigable “worlds” tailored to the user’s current selection and profile. Think of it as a branching recommendation experience, rather than a static list.

**Specs:**

1.  **World Generation Engine:**
    *   Input: User profile data, current item selected, shopping cart contents, past purchase history, real-time browsing behavior.
    *   Process: Generate a directed graph representing interconnected “worlds.” Each world represents a thematic recommendation space (e.g., “Outdoor Adventure,” “Gourmet Cooking,” “Tech Enthusiast”).  World connections are weighted based on the strength of association between themes (calculated via collaborative filtering and content-based analysis).
    *   Output: A navigable graph structure representing recommendation worlds.

2.  **World Visualization Module:**
    *   Input: Graph structure from the World Generation Engine.
    *   Process:  Render the graph as an interactive visual map.  Worlds are displayed as nodes (potentially 3D rendered environments), with connections represented as pathways.  Path thickness/color indicates connection strength. Allow for zooming, panning, and rotation.  Each world node should display a preview of representative items.
    *   Output: An interactive visual map of recommendation worlds.

3.  **Navigation & Interaction:**
    *   **Entry Point:** Upon item selection (or cart addition), the user is presented with the ‘World Map’.
    *   **Traversal:** Users navigate between worlds via the visual map (click/touch nodes/pathways).  Transitions between worlds should be visually smooth (e.g., animated ‘warp’ effect).
    *   **World Content:** Each world displays a curated selection of items relevant to its theme. Items are presented in an immersive layout (e.g., a ‘virtual shop’ environment).
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The World Map and content adjust dynamically based on user interactions (e.g., entering a world, hovering over items, adding to cart). This is a feedback loop informing the weighting and connections within the graph.

4.  **Personalization Engine:**
    *   Input: User interaction data, World Map navigation data, item views, purchases.
    *   Process: Continuously refine the weighting and structure of the World Map graph.  Prioritize worlds and pathways that the user frequently visits.  Introduce new worlds based on emerging interests.
    *   Output: A continuously evolving personalized World Map for each user.

**Pseudocode (World Generation Engine):**

```
function generateWorldMap(userProfile, selectedItem, cartContents, history):
  // Calculate thematic affinities between items & user interests
  affinities = calculateAffinities(userProfile, selectedItem, cartContents, history)

  // Create initial world nodes (themes) – can be pre-defined or dynamically generated
  worldNodes = createWorldNodes(affinities)

  // Connect world nodes based on affinity scores – higher score = stronger connection
  connections = createConnections(worldNodes, affinities)

  // Apply a graph layout algorithm (e.g., force-directed graph) to visualize the map
  graphLayout = applyGraphLayout(worldNodes, connections)

  return graphLayout
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Social Worlds:** Allow users to share their personalized World Maps with friends, creating a social recommendation experience.
*   **AR/VR Integration:** Render the World Map in AR/VR, creating a fully immersive recommendation environment.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce gamified elements (e.g., rewards, badges) to encourage exploration of the World Map.
