## Modular Evaporative Cooling – Bio-Integrated System

**Concept:** Integrate living plant material directly into the evaporative cooling modules to enhance cooling efficiency and provide air purification. This moves beyond purely physical evaporation to incorporate biological processes.

**Specifications:**

*   **Module Construction:** Replace the standard vapor permeable membrane with a layered structure.
    *   **Outer Layer:** Durable, transparent/translucent polymer mesh for structural support & weather resistance.
    *   **Intermediate Layer:**  A hydroponic growth matrix – a porous, inert material (rockwool, coconut coir) designed to support plant root systems.  This layer should be approximately 5-10cm thick.
    *   **Inner Layer:** A micro-perforated, water-retentive membrane to hold water and prevent direct contact between the hydroponic matrix and the air stream.  Pore size calibrated to retain water but allow water vapor passage.
*   **Plant Selection:** Utilize plant species known for high transpiration rates and air purification qualities.  Examples: *Pilea cadierei* (Aluminum Plant), *Chlorophytum comosum* (Spider Plant), various moss species.  Focus on compact, shallow-rooted varieties.
*   **Water Delivery:** Integrate a micro-irrigation system within the hydroponic matrix. A network of tiny tubing delivers nutrient-rich water directly to plant roots. Water source connected to the primary inlet. Individual module control valves regulate water flow.
*   **Airflow Design:**  Ensure consistent airflow *through* the plant root zone.  Air inlets and outlets designed to maximize contact between air and plant foliage/root surfaces. Airflow should not damage delicate plant tissues.
*   **Module Configuration:**  Modules designed to be stacked or arranged in V-bank configurations as described in the original patent.  Consider integrating LED grow lights into the module frames to provide supplemental lighting for indoor applications.
*   **Control System Integration:**
    *   **Sensor Suite:**  Integrate sensors to monitor:
        *   Hydroponic solution pH and nutrient levels.
        *   Plant transpiration rates (using thermal imaging or leaf temperature sensors).
        *   Air humidity and temperature.
        *   Light levels.
    *   **Automated Control:**  Computer system dynamically adjusts:
        *   Water delivery to individual modules based on plant needs and environmental conditions.
        *   LED grow light intensity and spectrum.
        *   Airflow rates to optimize cooling and plant health.
*   **Material Specifications:**
    *   All materials must be non-toxic to plants and humans.
    *   UV-resistant polymers for outdoor applications.
    *   Recyclable materials preferred.

**Pseudocode for Automated Control:**

```
// Define Sensor Inputs
pH_sensor = read_sensor("pH_sensor")
nutrient_level = read_sensor("nutrient_level")
transpiration_rate = read_sensor("transpiration_rate")
humidity = read_sensor("humidity")
temperature = read_sensor("temperature")
light_level = read_sensor("light_level")

// Define Desired Setpoints
desired_pH = 6.0
desired_nutrient_level = 500 ppm
desired_humidity = 60%
desired_temperature = 24°C
desired_light_level = 800 lux

// Control Algorithms
if pH_sensor < desired_pH:
    adjust_water_pH("increase")
elif pH_sensor > desired_pH:
    adjust_water_pH("decrease")

if nutrient_level < desired_nutrient_level:
    add_nutrients("increase")
elif nutrient_level > desired_nutrient_level:
    add_nutrients("decrease")

if transpiration_rate < 50% of optimal: //Based on plant species
    increase_water_flow()
    increase_airflow()
elif transpiration_rate > 150% of optimal:
    decrease_water_flow()
    decrease_airflow()

if humidity < 40%:
    increase_water_flow()
elif humidity > 70%:
    decrease_water_flow()

if temperature > 26°C:
    increase_airflow()
elif temperature < 22°C:
    decrease_airflow()

if light_level < 600 lux:
    increase_led_intensity()
elif light_level > 1000 lux:
    decrease_led_intensity()
```
