## Distributed Resonance Tuning for Enhanced Power Core Efficiency

**Concept:** Leverage resonant inductive coupling *between* integrated power cores to dynamically share and balance reactive power demands, minimizing losses and maximizing overall system efficiency. This builds on the idea of coordinated operation of inverters, but moves beyond simple communication to active power exchange.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each integrated power core (IPC) will incorporate a high-frequency (kHz range, scalable) resonant inductor coil.  Coil geometry optimized for near-field coupling to adjacent IPCs.
    *   Each IPC will also include a resonant capacitor bank, tuned to the same frequency as the inductor, forming a resonant tank circuit.  Variable capacitance (e.g., using switched capacitor arrays) will allow for dynamic frequency tuning and impedance matching.
    *   Dedicated high-frequency, high-power switching transistors (e.g., SiC MOSFETs or GaN HEMTs) will enable controlled energy transfer between IPCs via the resonant links.
    *   Current and voltage sensors on both sides of the resonant link will provide feedback for precise power control.

*   **Software/Control System:**
    *   A central controller (or distributed control network) will monitor the reactive power demands of each IPC.  This can be determined by analyzing inverter current waveforms and estimating the power factor.
    *   The control system will implement a resonant frequency tracking algorithm.  This algorithm adjusts the variable capacitance in each IPC to maintain resonance, even as load conditions change.
    *   A power allocation algorithm will determine how to distribute reactive power between IPCs.  The goal is to minimize overall system losses and maintain voltage stability. This algorithm will consider factors such as inverter efficiency curves and component temperature limits.
    *   The control system will implement a closed-loop current control scheme to regulate power transfer between IPCs. This will ensure stable and predictable operation.

*   **Pseudocode (Power Allocation Algorithm):**

```
// Define system parameters
float resonantFrequency = 10 kHz;
float maxPowerTransfer = 5 kW;
float inverterEfficiency[NUM_INVERTERS];
float ipcTemperature[NUM_IPC];

// Main loop
while (systemRunning) {

    // Calculate reactive power demand for each IPC
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_IPC; i++) {
        reactivePowerDemand[i] = calculateReactivePower(inverterCurrents[i]);
    }

    // Calculate total reactive power demand
    totalReactivePower = sum(reactivePowerDemand);

    // Calculate reactive power sharing ratio
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_IPC; i++) {
        sharingRatio[i] = reactivePowerDemand[i] / totalReactivePower;
    }

    // Adjust power transfer based on inverter efficiency and temperature
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_IPC; i++) {
        adjustedSharingRatio[i] = sharingRatio[i] * inverterEfficiency[i] * (1 - ipcTemperature[i]);
    }

    // Normalize adjusted sharing ratio
    sumAdjustedRatio = sum(adjustedSharingRatio);
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_IPC; i++) {
        adjustedSharingRatio[i] /= sumAdjustedRatio;
    }

    // Calculate power transfer between IPCs
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_IPC; i++) {
        powerTransfer[i] = adjustedSharingRatio[i] * totalReactivePower;

        // Limit power transfer to maximum value
        if (powerTransfer[i] > maxPowerTransfer) {
            powerTransfer[i] = maxPowerTransfer;
        }
    }

    // Send control signals to IPCs
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_IPC; i++) {
        sendPowerControlSignal(ipcID[i], powerTransfer[i]);
    }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased System Efficiency:**  By dynamically sharing reactive power, losses in the DC-DC converters and inverters can be reduced.
*   **Improved Power Quality:**  Reactive power compensation can improve the overall power factor and reduce harmonic distortion.
*   **Enhanced Reliability:**  Redundancy can be built in by allowing IPCs to assist each other during transient events.
*   **Reduced Component Stress:**  Balancing the load between IPCs can reduce thermal stress on individual components.

**Novelty:** This extends coordinated inverter control from communication to *active* power transfer, enabling a self-balancing and optimizing power architecture. It isn't just about *knowing* the load, but *actively shifting* it to minimize losses and maximize efficiency system-wide.
