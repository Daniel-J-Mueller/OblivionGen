**Dynamic Snapshot Composition & Rights Management**

**Concept:** Extend the snapshot manifest concept to allow *composition* of snapshots from multiple sources, governed by granular rights policies enforced *at composition time*. This isn’t just about preventing access to a whole snapshot, but enabling controlled sharing of *parts* of snapshots.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure: Composition Manifest.** A new manifest type alongside the existing snapshot manifest. This manifest defines which data chunks (identified by hash or block ID) originate from which “source snapshots” and the associated rights policies.
*   **Rights Policy Language:** A flexible language to define access control rules for individual data chunks within a composition manifest. Examples:
    *   “Chunk X can be accessed by User Group A, but only for read-only access.”
    *   “Chunk Y is watermarked for User B and cannot be exported.”
    *   “Chunk Z is only visible to User C if they have a valid license key.”
*   **Composition Service:** A new service responsible for creating composite snapshots from existing snapshots based on a provided composition manifest.
    *   Input: Composition manifest, list of source snapshot IDs.
    *   Process:
        1.  Verify access rights for each chunk based on the composition manifest.
        2.  Fetch authorized chunks from source snapshots.
        3.  Apply any specified transformations (watermarking, encryption)
        4.  Create a new composite snapshot.
        5.  Generate a new composite snapshot manifest linking chunks to source snapshots and applied policies.
*   **Client-Side Enforcement:** Client software capable of interpreting the composite snapshot manifest and enforcing rights policies when accessing data.
    *   Implement checks based on user identity, license status, and other relevant criteria.
    *   Handle access denials gracefully.
*   **Caching Layer:** Optimized caching of chunks and rights policies to minimize latency and improve performance.
    *   Chunk-level caching.
    *   Manifest caching.

**Pseudocode (Composition Service):**

```
function createCompositeSnapshot(compositionManifest, sourceSnapshotIds):
  compositeSnapshot = new Snapshot()
  for each chunkEntry in compositionManifest:
    sourceSnapshotId = chunkEntry.sourceSnapshotId
    chunkId = chunkEntry.chunkId
    rightsPolicy = chunkEntry.rightsPolicy
    sourceSnapshot = getSnapshot(sourceSnapshotId)
    chunkData = getChunk(sourceSnapshot, chunkId)
    if hasAccess(user, rightsPolicy):
      transformedChunkData = transformChunk(chunkData, rightsPolicy)  //Apply watermark, encryption etc.
      addChunk(compositeSnapshot, transformedChunkData)
    else:
      //Handle access denied – log event, substitute with placeholder data, etc.
      logAccessDenied(user, chunkId)
  compositeSnapshotManifest = generateCompositeSnapshotManifest(compositeSnapshot, sourceSnapshotIds, rightsPolicies)
  return compositeSnapshot, compositeSnapshotManifest
```

**Innovation:** This extends the idea of snapshot manifests from simple tracking of data origins to a dynamic rights management system operating at the data chunk level. It allows for granular control over data sharing, enabling new use cases like collaborative editing with access restrictions, secure distribution of sensitive data, and customized snapshot views for different users.
