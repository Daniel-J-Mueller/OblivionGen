## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Projection

**Concept:** Dynamically map a physical space’s acoustic properties and project a tailored soundscape, moving beyond simple beamforming to create localized auditory “zones” with distinct characteristics – reverb, timbre, even simulated acoustic materials.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Minimum of 8 ultra-wideband (UWB) microphones distributed across the target listening area (e.g., a room). UWB provides precise time-of-flight data for accurate spatial mapping. Optionally, integrate visual sensors (depth cameras) to correlate acoustic reflections with physical surfaces.
*   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:** A real-time signal processing unit capable of performing:
    *   **Impulse Response Measurement:**  Generate short, broadband signals and capture their reflections. Utilize deconvolution techniques to isolate and characterize impulse responses from various points in space.
    *   **Spatial Decomposition:** Create a 3D voxel grid representing the listening space. Populate each voxel with acoustic parameters derived from impulse responses:
        *   Reverberation Time (RT60)
        *   Early Decay Time (EDT)
        *   Sound Diffusion Coefficient
        *   Dominant Reflection Angles
        *   Frequency-Dependent Absorption Coefficients
    *   **Material Simulation:** Model the acoustic properties of different materials (wood, glass, fabric, etc.) and apply them virtually to surfaces within the voxel grid to alter perceived sound.
*   **Sound Source Designation:** User interface or automated system to designate sound sources (e.g., virtual instruments, streaming audio) and assign them specific locations and characteristics within the mapped space.
*   **Beamforming & Wavefield Synthesis Engine:** Advanced algorithm combining beamforming with wavefield synthesis to create highly localized auditory zones:
    *   **Zone Definition:**  Allow users to define arbitrary shapes and sizes for auditory zones (spheres, cylinders, irregular polygons).
    *   **Zone Characteristics:** Assign specific acoustic properties to each zone – RT60, timbre, simulated material (e.g., make a zone sound like it’s inside a cathedral).
    *   **Source-Zone Assignment:** Route audio from designated sources to specific auditory zones.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously adjust beamforming and wavefield synthesis parameters to maintain stable auditory zones, even with listener movement or changes in the environment.
*   **Loudspeaker Array:** Multi-channel loudspeaker setup (minimum 8, ideally 16+) strategically positioned to cover the target listening area. The arrangement is optimized for both beamforming and wavefield synthesis.
*   **Control Interface:** User-friendly GUI to:
    *   Visualize the acoustic map.
    *   Define auditory zones.
    *   Assign sound sources.
    *   Adjust zone characteristics.
    *   Control overall system parameters.

**Pseudocode (Zone Creation & Audio Routing):**

```
// Define a new auditory zone
function createZone(zoneID, shape, position, size, RT60, timbre, material) {
  zone.ID = zoneID;
  zone.shape = shape;
  zone.position = position;
  zone.size = size;
  zone.RT60 = RT60;
  zone.timbre = timbre;
  zone.material = material;
  addZoneToMap(zone);
}

// Route audio to a zone
function routeAudioToZone(audioSource, zoneID) {
  // Apply EQ and filtering to audioSource based on zone.timbre and zone.material
  processedAudio = applyEQ(audioSource, zone.timbre);
  processedAudio = applyMaterialSimulation(processedAudio, zone.material);

  // Calculate beamforming and wavefield synthesis parameters to focus processedAudio towards zone
  beamformingParams = calculateBeamformingParams(processedAudio, zone);
  wavefieldSynthesisParams = calculateWavefieldSynthesisParams(processedAudio, zone);

  // Apply parameters to loudspeaker array
  applyLoudspeakerConfiguration(beamformingParams, wavefieldSynthesisParams);

  // Play processedAudio through loudspeakers
  playAudio(processedAudio);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive gaming and VR/AR experiences.
*   Personalized audio environments for home theaters and listening rooms.
*   Acoustic camouflage and noise cancellation.
*   Virtual concerts and performances.
*   Therapeutic audio environments for relaxation and stress reduction.
