## Haptic Display Synchronization

**Concept:** Augment the display state detection with localized haptic feedback, creating a synchronized multi-sensory experience. Instead of *just* determining if the display is on or off, the system will subtly vibrate a surface near the user – a table, a chair, a handheld remote – *in time* with visual transitions on the screen.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Transducer Network:** Deploy a network of low-profile piezoelectric transducers – think flexible, thin-film actuators – embedded in common household surfaces (tabletops, armrests, remote controls). These transducers will be wirelessly connected to the voice-controlled device.
*   **Audio-Haptic Correlation:** Modify the probe audio signal generation. Instead of solely focusing on detecting the display state, the signal will contain frequency components optimized for haptic transduction. Specifically, frequencies between 20-200Hz will be emphasized, as these are most effectively perceived as vibrations.
*   **Transition Detection Enhancement:** The cross-correlation algorithm (as described in the original patent) will be expanded to analyze the *rate of change* in the probe signal’s power level. A rapid increase in power indicates a screen turning on; a rapid decrease, a screen turning off.
*   **Synchronized Haptic Pulse:** Upon detecting a display transition, the voice-controlled device will transmit a short, precisely timed pulse to the nearest haptic transducer.  The pulse duration will be adjustable, ranging from 50ms to 200ms.  The amplitude of the pulse will be dynamically adjusted based on the detected transition speed. Faster transitions = stronger pulses.
*   **User Profile/Calibration:** Implement a user profile system. Users will be able to calibrate the haptic intensity and pulse duration to their preference. The system should allow for personalized sensitivity settings.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Utilize a low-latency wireless protocol (e.g., Bluetooth LE, Zigbee) for communication between the voice-controlled device and the haptic transducers.
*   **Power Management:** Haptic transducers will operate in a low-power sleep mode when not actively vibrating.
*   **AI Learning:** Integrate an AI module to learn user preferences and predict likely display transitions. This will allow the system to preemptively activate the haptic transducer, creating a smoother, more immersive experience.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Detect Probe Signal Power
  powerLevel = analyzeProbeSignal();

  // 2. Calculate Rate of Change
  rateOfChange = calculateRateOfChange(powerLevel);

  // 3. Transition Detection
  if (abs(rateOfChange) > threshold) {
    // 4. Determine Transition Type (On/Off)
    if (rateOfChange > 0) {
      transitionType = "On";
    } else {
      transitionType = "Off";
    }

    // 5. Trigger Haptic Pulse
    triggerHapticPulse(transitionType);
  }
}

// Function: triggerHapticPulse
function triggerHapticPulse(transitionType) {
  // Determine pulse duration and amplitude based on transitionType and user preferences
  pulseDuration = getUserPreference("pulseDuration");
  pulseAmplitude = getUserPreference("pulseAmplitude");

  // Send wireless signal to nearest haptic transducer
  sendWirelessSignal(transducerID, pulseDuration, pulseAmplitude);
}
```
