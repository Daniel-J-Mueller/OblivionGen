## Dynamic Haptic Guidance System for Complex Assembly

**Concept:** Expanding on the haptic feedback element of the patent, this system moves beyond simple 'match/no match' notifications to provide *dynamic*, real-time guidance for complex assembly tasks. Imagine assembling electronics, where component orientation and precise placement are critical. 

**Specs:**

*   **Ultrasonic Unit (Wrist-worn):**
    *   Array of micro-vibrators (at least 8), distributed across the back of the hand/wrist.  Each vibrator is independently controllable in intensity and frequency.
    *   9-axis IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) – to track hand/wrist orientation and movement.
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceiver – for communication with the central processing unit.
    *   Small, high-density battery providing at least 4 hours of continuous operation.
*   **Transducer Network (Workstation):**
    *   Minimum of 12 ultrasonic transducers strategically positioned around the workstation.  Transducers must have a known 3D coordinate within the workstation’s coordinate system.
    *   Each transducer is individually addressable.
    *   Transducers operate at a frequency optimized for material penetration and minimal interference (estimated 40kHz - 80kHz).
*   **Central Processing Unit (Workstation PC):**
    *   Real-time operating system (RTOS) for deterministic performance.
    *   3D model of the assembly being performed, including component geometries and desired relationships.
    *   Algorithm to calculate the optimal haptic feedback pattern based on the current position of the user’s hand, the position of the components, and the desired assembly process.
    *   Calibration routine to map the transducer network to the workspace and account for environmental factors.

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateHapticPattern(handPosition, componentPosition, assemblyStep)
  // handPosition: 3D coordinates of the ultrasonic unit
  // componentPosition: 3D coordinates of the component being assembled
  // assemblyStep: Current step in the assembly process

  // 1. Calculate the vector between the hand and the component.
  vector = componentPosition - handPosition

  // 2. Determine the desired correction direction.  
  correctionDirection = Normalize(vector)

  // 3. Calculate the magnitude of the error.
  errorMagnitude = Length(vector)

  // 4. Map the error magnitude to a vibration intensity level.
  intensityLevel = Map(errorMagnitude, 0, MaxError, 0, MaxIntensity)

  // 5. Calculate the vibration frequency based on the assembly step
  frequency = LookupFrequency(assemblyStep)

  // 6. Determine which vibrators to activate.  Based on the correctionDirection
  vibratorPattern = GenerateVibratorPattern(correctionDirection)

  // 7.  Output the activation signals for each vibrator: intensity and frequency.
  FOR EACH vibrator IN vibratorPattern
    SetVibrator(vibrator, intensityLevel, frequency)

**Operation:**

1.  The system is calibrated to the workstation environment and the user’s hand.
2.  The assembly process is pre-programmed into the central processing unit, defining the sequence of steps and the desired component relationships.
3.  As the user moves their hand, the ultrasonic transducers track its position.
4.  The central processing unit calculates the optimal haptic feedback pattern based on the current position of the hand and the desired assembly process.
5.  The ultrasonic unit activates the appropriate micro-vibrators, providing directional guidance to the user.  For example, if the user needs to move their hand slightly to the left, the micro-vibrators on the left side of their wrist will activate.
6.  The intensity and frequency of the vibrations are dynamically adjusted based on the magnitude of the error and the assembly step.
