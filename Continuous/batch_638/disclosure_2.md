## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Job "Social Impact"

**Specification:** A system for dynamically allocating resources to batch jobs not solely based on scheduling flexibility and resource contention, but also on a predicted "Social Impact Score" (SIS) calculated for each job. This score attempts to quantify the broader benefit of completing the job quickly, beyond just the client's immediate need.

**Components:**

*   **SIS Calculation Engine:** A module that analyzes job metadata (submitted by the client or inferred from the job type) to assign a SIS.  This engine leverages external data sources (e.g., scientific research databases, public health data, economic indicators).
*   **Job Metadata Augmentation:** Clients submit, alongside standard scheduling descriptors, optional metadata tags describing the job's domain (e.g., "climate modeling", "medical research", "financial risk assessment", “artistic rendering”).
*   **External Data Integration:** The SIS engine accesses and integrates data from external sources relevant to each metadata tag.  Example: A “climate modeling” job boosts its SIS if it’s running a simulation that contributes to IPCC reports. A “medical research” job gets a boost if it’s analyzing data related to a pandemic.
*   **Resource Prioritization Algorithm:** Modifies the existing scheduling algorithm to incorporate the SIS. Higher SIS jobs are prioritized for resource allocation, even if it means slightly delaying lower SIS jobs, *within* the bounds of client-specified scheduling flexibility.
*   **Real-time Feedback Loop:** Monitors the performance of higher-SIS jobs. If a job is stalled or underperforming, it dynamically adjusts resource allocation to improve its progress.
*   **Transparency Layer:** Provides clients with limited visibility into the SIS of their jobs, and the factors influencing resource allocation (without revealing sensitive details of other clients' jobs).
*   **"Good Citizen" Incentive:** Clients receive a minor discount on resource usage if they voluntarily submit metadata tags and allow their job's SIS to be calculated.

**Pseudocode (Resource Prioritization Algorithm Modification):**

```
function prioritize_jobs(job_queue, available_resources):
  for job in job_queue:
    job.priority_score = job.scheduling_flexibility_score + (job.social_impact_score * weighting_factor)

  sorted_job_queue = sort(job_queue, key=lambda x: x.priority_score, reverse=True)

  allocated_resources = {}
  for job in sorted_job_queue:
    required_resources = job.resource_requirements
    if can_allocate(required_resources, available_resources):
      allocate(required_resources, available_resources)
      allocated_resources[job] = True
    else:
      # Potentially delay job based on scheduling flexibility
      if job.can_be_delayed():
        job.delay()
      else:
        # Job cannot be delayed; queue it for later
        queue_job(job)
  return allocated_resources
```

**Weighting Factor:**  A configurable parameter that determines the relative importance of SIS compared to scheduling flexibility.  This parameter is dynamically adjusted based on overall system load and pre-defined policy goals (e.g., prioritizing pandemic research during a health crisis).

**Data Sources (Examples):**

*   **OpenAlex:** For scientific research metadata and impact metrics.
*   **WHO/CDC APIs:** For public health data and disease outbreak information.
*   **World Bank/IMF:** For economic indicators and development data.
*   **GitHub/Stack Overflow:** For open-source project activity and community impact.
