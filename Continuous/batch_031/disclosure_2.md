## Hardware Security Module Attestation via Biological Signal

**Specification:** A system for bolstering HSM security by incorporating biometric authentication tied directly to the cryptographic key lifecycle.

**Core Concept:** Integrate a continuous biometric monitoring system – specifically, electrodermal activity (EDA) – with the HSM.  EDA, measured via sensors integrated into the HSM chassis (contact points for authorized personnel), serves as a dynamic authentication factor and a source of entropy for key generation/refreshment.

**Components:**

*   **HSM Chassis with Integrated EDA Sensors:** The physical HSM case contains multiple EDA sensors designed for comfortable, reliable contact with the hands or forearms of authorized personnel.
*   **Real-Time EDA Processing Unit:** A dedicated hardware/software module within the HSM responsible for:
    *   Raw EDA signal acquisition and amplification.
    *   Noise filtering and artifact removal.
    *   Feature extraction (e.g., number of skin conductance responses (SCRs), amplitude of SCRs, frequency of SCRs).
    *   Real-time anomaly detection – flagging unusual EDA patterns indicative of duress or unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Biometric Entropy Source:**  A hardware random number generator (HRNG) seeded and modulated by the real-time EDA features. This HRNG generates additional entropy for cryptographic key generation and key derivation functions.
*   **Attestation Service:** A secure service (potentially remote) that periodically requests EDA-derived challenges from the HSM. The HSM must respond with a cryptographic signature generated using a key derived from the current EDA profile, proving ongoing authorized presence.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF) Enhancement:** Modify the KDF to incorporate EDA-derived entropy alongside traditional secrets (passwords, PINs). This creates keys resistant to offline attacks.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Enrollment:**  Authorized personnel undergo a baseline EDA profiling session.  This establishes a “normal” EDA range and identifies unique physiological signatures.
2.  **Authentication:**  Upon HSM access request, the user makes contact with the EDA sensors. The system validates the user’s EDA profile against the enrollment data.
3.  **Key Generation/Refreshment:** When a new cryptographic key is needed, the system uses the EDA-derived entropy as a critical seed for the key generation process, enhancing its randomness and unpredictability. Existing keys are periodically refreshed with additional EDA entropy.
4.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Throughout operation, the system continuously monitors the user’s EDA. Significant deviations from the baseline profile trigger alerts and potentially lock down critical HSM functions.
5.  **Remote Attestation:** The attestation service sends a challenge to the HSM. The HSM responds with a signed response using a key derived from the current EDA profile, verifying the physical presence of an authorized operator.

**Pseudocode (Key Generation):**

```
function generateKey(masterSecret, edaEntropy):
  // Combine master secret and EDA entropy using a KDF
  derivedKey = KDF(masterSecret, edaEntropy, keyLength)
  return derivedKey
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   Sensor Spoofing: Implement tamper-resistant sensor packaging and signal integrity checks.
*   Physiological Variability: Account for natural EDA fluctuations due to stress, fatigue, and other factors. Utilize robust statistical analysis and anomaly detection algorithms.
*   Data Privacy: Encrypt EDA data at rest and in transit. Implement strict access control policies.
