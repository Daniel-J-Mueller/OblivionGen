## Adaptive Mask Generation for Fine-Grained Access Control

**Concept:** Expand upon the shifting hardware's mask generation capabilities to support dynamic, fine-grained access control, moving beyond simple region identification to permission-based addressing. Instead of a single mask determining *if* an address is within a region, the mask will represent *what* operations are permitted on that address – read, write, execute, etc.

**Specs:**

*   **Mask Encoding:** The mask will be wider than a simple region identifier, utilizing multiple bits per addressable unit (e.g., byte, word). These bits will represent permission flags (Read, Write, Execute, Debug, etc.).  The width of the mask will be configurable.
*   **Dynamic Permission Assignment:** A “Permission Table” stored in a dedicated memory region will map address ranges to permission flags. This table will be updated dynamically during runtime.
*   **Shifting Hardware Augmentation:**  The existing shifting hardware will be extended with a “Permission Shifter”. This module receives:
    *   The base address of the permission table.
    *   The transaction address.
    *   A “Region Size” parameter.
*   **Permission Shifter Operation:**
    1.  Calculate the offset into the Permission Table based on the transaction address.
    2.  Retrieve the permission flags from the Permission Table at that offset.
    3.  Shift the retrieved permission flags left by a number of bits determined by the Region Size. This creates a permission mask aligned with the transaction address.
*   **Access Control Logic:**  Combine the permission mask (from the Permission Shifter) with the transaction address using a bitwise AND operation. This will yield a “Permitted Address” value.
*   **Access Granted/Denied:** Compare the “Permitted Address” with the transaction address. If they are equal, access is granted. Otherwise, access is denied.
*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   **Permission Table Memory:**  RAM or Flash memory to store permission mappings.
    *   **Permission Shifter Module:** Custom hardware module implementing the shifting and retrieval logic.
    *   **Access Control Unit:** Hardware block performing the bitwise AND and comparison operations.

**Pseudocode (Permission Shifter Module):**

```
function generatePermissionMask(baseAddress, transactionAddress, regionSize):
  offset = transactionAddress - baseAddress
  permissionFlags = readMemory(baseAddress + offset)  // Read permission flags from table
  permissionMask = shiftLeft(permissionFlags, regionSize)  // Left shift to align mask
  return permissionMask
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Secure Memory Access:** Protect sensitive data by restricting access to specific memory regions.
*   **Code Integrity:**  Prevent unauthorized modification of code by enforcing write protection.
*   **Fine-Grained Resource Management:** Control access to hardware resources based on permissions.
*   **Virtualization:** Implement memory isolation between virtual machines.
