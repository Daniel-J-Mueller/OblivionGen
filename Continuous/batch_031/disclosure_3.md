## Adaptive Granularity Data Consolidation

**Concept:** Extend the data segment aggregation to dynamically adjust the granularity (time interval) of data segments *before* storage, based on detected data volatility and prediction models. This allows optimizing storage costs and query performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Volatility Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw measurement streams (first & second measurements as described in the patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate rolling standard deviation and rate of change for each metric within specified time windows (e.g., 1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes).
    *   Employ anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA) to identify periods of high volatility.
    *   Assign a volatility score to each time window based on the calculated metrics.
*   **Output:**  Volatility score for each time interval.

**2. Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical measurement data, volatility scores, time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., Prophet, LSTM).
*   **Process:**
    *   Train prediction models to forecast future volatility for each metric.
    *   Generate a predicted volatility score for upcoming time intervals.
*   **Output:** Predicted volatility score for upcoming time intervals.

**3. Granularity Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Volatility scores (current & predicted), storage class parameters (max retention time, cost per unit storage), query patterns (from a query log or real-time analysis).
*   **Process:**
    *   Define a granularity mapping table: Maps volatility ranges to appropriate data segment durations. Example:
        *   Low Volatility: 60-minute segments
        *   Medium Volatility: 15-minute segments
        *   High Volatility: 1-minute segments
    *   Dynamically adjust the data segment duration based on the current and predicted volatility scores.  Prioritize shorter durations for high volatility periods and longer durations for stable periods.
    *   Implement a cost-benefit analysis: Balance storage cost with query performance requirements.
*   **Output:** Adjusted data segment duration for each time interval.

**4. Segment Generation & Storage:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Generate data segments with the adjusted duration.
    *   Store the segments in the archival storage resource, updating the index with the corresponding time interval and granularity level.
    *   Implement a metadata layer that stores the granularity level and volatility score associated with each data segment.

**5. Query Optimization Engine:**

*   **Process:**
    *   When a query is received, analyze the requested time range and granularity.
    *   Retrieve data segments based on the query parameters and metadata.
    *   Dynamically aggregate or downsample data segments to match the requested granularity.
    *   Optimize query execution by leveraging the granularity metadata to minimize data retrieval and processing.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Adjustment Engine):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustGranularity(currentVolatility, predictedVolatility, storageClassParams):
  IF currentVolatility > HIGH_THRESHOLD OR predictedVolatility > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    segmentDuration = 1 minute
  ELSE IF currentVolatility > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD OR predictedVolatility > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    segmentDuration = 15 minutes
  ELSE:
    segmentDuration = 60 minutes

  # Cost-benefit analysis (optional)
  costPerUnitStorage = storageClassParams.costPerUnitStorage
  queryFrequency = GetQueryFrequency(storageClassParams.metric)

  IF costPerUnitStorage * segmentDuration > queryFrequency:
    segmentDuration = Max(segmentDuration / 2, 1 minute) # Reduce duration if cost is too high

  RETURN segmentDuration
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Volatility Score:** Floating-point number representing the volatility of a metric within a time interval.
*   **Granularity Mapping Table:** Dictionary mapping volatility ranges to data segment durations.
*   **Segment Metadata:** Structure containing segment duration, volatility score, and archival storage location.
