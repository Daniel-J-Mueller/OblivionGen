## Dynamic Schema Evolution via Federated Querying

**Concept:** Extend the automatic schema generation to dynamically adapt to evolving data sources *without* requiring schema re-ingestion or downtime. Leverage a federated query approach to probe multiple potential schemas concurrently and select the most accurate representation on-the-fly.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Schema Evolution Engine (SEE) - operates alongside the existing query service.
*   **Data Input:** Description of data source (as in the patent).  Crucially, the SEE also receives a 'schema drift tolerance' parameter – a percentage indicating acceptable schema change before re-evaluation.
*   **Schema Repository:** A store of potential schemas for each data source. Initial schemas are generated as described in the patent.
*   **Federated Probing:**
    1.  When a query arrives, the SEE retrieves the *N* most probable schemas for the data source (based on drift tolerance and historical accuracy).
    2.  The query is reformulated into *N* slightly different queries, each tailored to one of the potential schemas.  This involves mapping column names and data types appropriately.
    3.  These *N* reformulated queries are executed in parallel against the data source.
    4.  Each query's results are validated against the data source's actual data.  Validation metrics include:
        *   **Data Completeness:** Percentage of expected data fields present.
        *   **Data Validity:** Percentage of data values conforming to the expected data type.
        *   **Query Execution Time:** A proxy for schema accuracy – a more accurate schema should yield faster execution.
    5.  A scoring function combines these metrics to rank the schemas.
*   **Dynamic Schema Selection:** The highest-scoring schema is used to transform the query results.
*   **Schema Update:** If the highest-scoring schema’s score falls below a threshold, or if the score difference between the top two schemas exceeds a threshold, the SEE triggers a schema re-evaluation process (as in the original patent) to generate new candidate schemas.
*   **Schema Versioning:** All schemas are versioned to allow for rollback and debugging.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function processQuery(query, dataSourceDescription):
  candidateSchemas = getSchemaRepository().getCandidateSchemas(dataSourceDescription)

  parallel for each schema in candidateSchemas:
    reformattedQuery = reformatQuery(query, schema)
    queryResults = executeQuery(reformattedQuery, dataSourceDescription)
    validationScore = validateResults(queryResults, schema)
    store score for schema

  bestSchema = getBestSchema(scores)

  transformedResults = transformResults(queryResults, bestSchema)
  return transformedResults
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond static schema generation to a dynamic, adaptive system. It improves system resilience to data source changes, minimizes downtime, and offers increased accuracy in a rapidly evolving data landscape. It is more complex, but it aims to provide a more robust and scalable solution than simple re-ingestion of schemas. It doesn't require constant monitoring, but uses a reactionary approach to ensure continuous data integrity.
