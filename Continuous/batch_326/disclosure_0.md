## Temporal Data Weaving for Predictive Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the existing point-in-time restoration framework to *proactively* predict future partition splits and pre-calculate/weave snapshots representing those potential futures. This allows for faster recovery *and* the ability to "rollback" to hypothetical states that never actually occurred, useful for "what-if" analysis and proactive system optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** "Temporal Weaver" - a background service that runs alongside the existing data manager.
*   **Data Input:** Change logs, partition metadata (size, growth rate, access patterns), historical split data.
*   **Prediction Engine:** Utilizes time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict the probability of partition splits within a defined time window.  The window should be configurable.
*   **Weaving Process:** For each predicted split (above a confidence threshold), the Temporal Weaver creates a "shadow" snapshot sequence *as if* the split had occurred. This is achieved by applying changes to a copy of the existing snapshot *along the predicted split timeline*. This is similar to the existing snapshot process, but performed proactively.
*   **Snapshot Storage:** "Woven Snapshots" are stored in a dedicated storage tier (potentially lower cost than active snapshots) alongside metadata indicating the prediction confidence, split parameters, and associated time window.
*   **Query Interface:**  New API endpoints for querying "Woven Snapshots." Parameters include:
    *   `partition_id`
    *   `timepoint` (the point in time to restore *as if* a split occurred)
    *   `confidence_threshold` (minimum prediction confidence to consider)
*   **Rollback/Recovery Procedure:**
    *   Upon recovery request (point-in-time or rollback), the system first checks for existing "Woven Snapshots" that match the requested timepoint and partition.
    *   If a suitable "Woven Snapshot" is found, it's used as the basis for recovery, bypassing the need for on-demand snapshot creation and change application.
    *   If no suitable "Woven Snapshot" exists, the standard snapshot/change application process is used.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Weaver Background Service):**

```
// Configuration: prediction window (e.g., 24 hours), confidence threshold (e.g., 0.75)

loop {
    // 1. Analyze change logs and partition metadata
    predicted_splits = predict_partition_splits(change_logs, partition_metadata)

    // 2. Filter predictions based on confidence threshold
    high_confidence_splits = filter_predictions(predicted_splits, confidence_threshold)

    // 3. For each high-confidence split:
    for split in high_confidence_splits {
        // a. Get the latest snapshot for the partition
        latest_snapshot = get_latest_snapshot(split.partition_id)

        // b. Create a shadow snapshot sequence
        shadow_snapshots = create_shadow_snapshot_sequence(latest_snapshot, split, split.predicted_split_time)

        // c. Store the shadow snapshots
        store_shadow_snapshots(shadow_snapshots, split)
    }

    sleep(interval) // e.g., 1 hour
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Faster Recovery:** Pre-calculated snapshots significantly reduce recovery time.
*   **Proactive Optimization:** "What-if" analysis allows for evaluating the impact of potential splits and optimizing system configuration.
*   **Improved Scalability:**  By anticipating future splits, the system can proactively allocate resources and avoid performance bottlenecks.
*   **Reduced Load:** Offload snapshot creation from critical recovery paths.
