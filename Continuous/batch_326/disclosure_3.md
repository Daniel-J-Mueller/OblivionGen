## Adaptive Sensory Feedback System for E-Commerce

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple visual notifications of better-rated alternatives. Integrate localized haptic and auditory feedback *directly* into the user's interaction with the original item's webpage to subtly guide attention toward the alternative. This builds on the existing user interaction monitoring (highlighting, cursor dwell, gaze) by *influencing* it in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Haptic Surface Layer: A transparent, flexible haptic layer applied *over* standard displays (phones, tablets, monitors). This layer utilizes micro-actuators to create localized tactile sensations.
    *   Directional Audio Emitters: Miniature, directional speakers embedded around the display perimeter.
    *   User Device Compatibility: Software/driver support for major operating systems (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS).
*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   Interaction Mapping: Algorithm correlating user interaction data (dwell time, highlighting, gaze) with specific regions of the current item's webpage.
    *   Feedback Profile Generation: Dynamically create a feedback profile based on the alternative item's rating delta (difference in rating compared to the original item) and the user’s interaction mapping. Higher delta = more pronounced feedback.
    *   Haptic Pattern Library: A collection of pre-defined haptic patterns (e.g., gentle pulses, localized texture changes, subtle vibrations) mapped to different types of information (rating difference, number of reviews).
    *   Spatial Audio Mapping: Algorithm to create a "sound beacon" effect using the directional audio emitters, subtly drawing the user's ear toward the area of the screen where information about the alternative item would be displayed (e.g., a small banner ad, a "you might also like" section).
    *   Adaptive Intensity Control: Automatically adjust the intensity of both haptic and auditory feedback based on ambient noise levels, user preferences, and the user’s current activity (e.g., lower intensity during a phone call).
*   **Integration:**
    *   Web API:  Interface for e-commerce platforms to transmit alternative item data, rating deltas, and user interaction data to the adaptive feedback system.
    *   User Preference Panel:  Settings allowing users to customize feedback intensity, disable specific feedback channels (haptic/audio), and set preferred feedback patterns.

**Pseudocode (Feedback Generation):**

```
function generateFeedback(userInteractionData, alternativeItemRatingDelta, userPreferences) {

  // Calculate feedback intensity based on delta and preferences
  feedbackIntensity = alternativeItemRatingDelta * userPreferences.intensityScale;

  // Select appropriate haptic pattern
  hapticPattern = selectHapticPattern(alternativeItemRatingDelta);

  // Calculate target region for haptic/audio feedback (based on user interaction)
  targetRegion = calculateTargetRegion(userInteractionData);

  // Apply haptic feedback to target region with calculated intensity
  applyHapticFeedback(targetRegion, hapticPattern, feedbackIntensity);

  // Generate spatial audio beacon toward target region with calculated intensity
  generateSpatialAudioBeacon(targetRegion, feedbackIntensity);
}

function selectHapticPattern(ratingDelta) {
  if (ratingDelta > 0.5) {
    return "strongPulse";
  } else if (ratingDelta > 0.2) {
    return "gentleVibration";
  } else {
    return "subtleTextureChange";
  }
}

function calculateTargetRegion(userInteractionData) {
  // Analyze dwell time, highlighting, gaze data to determine the region
  // of the page the user is currently focused on.
  // Return coordinates of that region.
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced product discovery on e-commerce sites.
*   Subtle guidance towards higher-quality alternatives in online catalogs.
*   Accessibility features for visually impaired users.
*   Gamified shopping experiences.
*   Contextual advertising.
