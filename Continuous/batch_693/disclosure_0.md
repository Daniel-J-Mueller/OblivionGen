## Haptic Projection & Spatial Audio Integration

**Core Concept:** Extend the translucent surface functionality beyond visual display to include localized haptic feedback synchronized with spatial audio, creating a multi-sensory interactive experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Translucent Surface Enhancement:** Replace the current translucent material with a micro-actuator array. Each actuator corresponds to a pixel (or cluster of pixels) and can generate localized pressure variations. The material should maintain high optical transparency and allow for rapid, precise actuation.  Material target: Electroactive polymers (EAPs) or micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS).
*   **Spatial Audio System:** Integrate an array of ultra-narrow beamforming speakers *behind* the translucent surface. Each speaker targets a specific zone on the surface.  Target bandwidth: 20Hz – 20kHz.  Beamforming precision: +/- 2 degrees.
*   **Sensor Fusion:** Combine data from the depth sensor, camera, and microphone array to create a dynamic spatial map of the user’s interaction. This map drives both the haptic and audio rendering.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Haptic Rendering Engine:**  Takes spatial data as input and generates commands for the micro-actuator array. Allows for varying intensity, frequency, and pattern of haptic feedback. Should support procedural generation of haptic textures and effects.
    *   **Spatial Audio Engine:**  Dynamically adjusts the direction and intensity of audio signals emitted from the beamforming speakers, based on the user's position and the content being displayed.  Should implement head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) for realistic 3D audio.
    *   **Fusion Module:**  Combines haptic and audio data to create a synchronized, multi-sensory experience.  Prioritizes perceptual consistency between the two modalities.
*   **Interaction Scenarios:**
    *   **Virtual Button/Slider:** Display a visual button or slider on the translucent surface. When the user touches the surface, the corresponding area provides haptic feedback, simulating the feel of a physical control. The spatial audio engine provides auditory confirmation of the interaction.
    *   **Object Manipulation:**  Display a virtual object on the surface.  The user can "grasp" the object by touching the surface.  The haptic engine simulates the texture and weight of the object.  The spatial audio engine generates sounds associated with the object's manipulation.
    *   **Ambient Effects:** Display subtle visual effects (e.g., flowing water, flickering fire) on the surface. The haptic engine generates corresponding tactile sensations (e.g., gentle vibrations, warmth). The spatial audio engine provides ambient soundscapes.
*   **Power & Thermal Management:**  The micro-actuator array and beamforming speakers will require significant power. Implement a highly efficient power delivery system and a robust thermal management solution to prevent overheating.

**Pseudocode (Haptic/Audio Fusion Module):**

```
function RenderFrame(spatial_map, content_data):
  # Calculate desired haptic effects based on spatial map and content
  haptic_effects = CalculateHapticEffects(spatial_map, content_data)

  # Calculate desired audio effects based on spatial map and content
  audio_effects = CalculateAudioEffects(spatial_map, content_data)

  # Prioritize effects (e.g., if user is touching object, prioritize haptic feedback)
  prioritized_effects = PrioritizeEffects(haptic_effects, audio_effects)

  # Render haptic effects on micro-actuator array
  RenderHapticEffects(prioritized_effects.haptic)

  # Render audio effects on beamforming speakers
  RenderAudioEffects(prioritized_effects.audio)
