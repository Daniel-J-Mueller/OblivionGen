## Dynamic Calendar "Constellations" - Proposal

**Concept:** Expand the idea of movable time blocks by representing recurring availability not as discrete blocks, but as probabilistic "constellations" of potential time. Instead of rigidly scheduling, the system proposes *likelihoods* of availability based on historical data, preferences, and contextual factors.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Input:**
    *   Historical Calendar Data: Past meeting schedules, accepted/rejected proposals, "busy" times.
    *   Preference Profiles: User-defined priorities (e.g., "morning person," "focus time," "buffer between meetings").
    *   Contextual Data: Location, weather, current workload (integrated with task management systems), and even biometric data (if permitted) to assess energy levels.
*   **Constellation Generation:**
    *   The system generates a probabilistic map of availability for each user over a specified time horizon (e.g., next week, next month).
    *   This map isn't a grid of "available" or "unavailable" slots, but a heat map where color intensity represents the probability of being free.
    *   Constellation shape adapts to preferences. For example, a "morning person" will have a denser constellation in the morning hours.
*   **Meeting Proposal Algorithm:**
    *   Instead of searching for exact matching blocks, the algorithm seeks areas of overlap between constellation maps.
    *   The algorithm calculates a "constellation alignment score" based on the degree of overlap and the combined probability of availability.
    *   Proposals are ranked by alignment score, presenting options with the highest likelihood of success.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Constellations are continuously updated based on real-time data and user feedback.
    *   If a user consistently declines proposals in a specific time slot, the constellation density in that slot decreases.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   "Constellation View": A visual representation of individual and group availability as probabilistic maps.
    *   Users can "seed" constellations with mandatory commitments (e.g., fixed meetings) to anchor the probabilistic map.
    *   Proposals are presented as "potential alignments" with associated probability scores and confidence intervals.
*   **Pseudocode â€“ Proposal Generation:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateMeetingProposals(attendee_list, meeting_duration, desired_date_range):
  // 1. Collect Constellation Maps for each attendee
  constellations = []
  FOR attendee IN attendee_list:
    constellations.append(GetConstellationMap(attendee, desired_date_range))

  // 2. Calculate Alignment Scores for all possible time slots
  alignment_scores = {}
  FOR time_slot IN possible_time_slots_within(desired_date_range, meeting_duration):
    alignment_score = 0
    FOR constellation IN constellations:
      alignment_score += constellation.probability_at(time_slot)
    alignment_scores[time_slot] = alignment_score

  // 3. Rank Time Slots by Alignment Score
  sorted_time_slots = sort(alignment_scores, descending=True)

  // 4. Return Top N Proposals
  proposals = []
  FOR i in range(min(N, len(sorted_time_slots))):
    proposals.append(sorted_time_slots[i])

  RETURN proposals
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Optimize scheduling for large teams with complex availability constraints.
*   Facilitate asynchronous collaboration by identifying optimal times for individual work and communication.
*   Improve meeting effectiveness by suggesting times when attendees are most likely to be engaged and productive.
