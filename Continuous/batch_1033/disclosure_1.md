## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Granularity Control

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones, configurable spatial arrangement), High-performance computing unit with GPU acceleration, Real-time data acquisition system.
*   **Software:** Custom signal processing library (Python/C++), Machine learning framework (TensorFlow/PyTorch), 3D rendering engine (Unity/Unreal).

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) estimation to reconstruct an acoustic scene *in time*, allowing users to 'rewind' and 'fast-forward' through a captured sound field. The core idea is to capture not just *where* sounds originate, but *when* they occurred with fine temporal resolution.

**Phase 1: Hyper-Granular TDOA & Source Localization**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**  Continuous audio recording from the multi-microphone array.
2.  **Signal Segmentation:** Divide the incoming signal into extremely short time frames (e.g., 1-5 milliseconds). This is where it differs from existing systems, as most operate on larger chunks.
3.  **Hyper-Granular TDOA Estimation:**  Apply a modified version of the TDOA estimation technique used in the provided patent, but optimized for these very short time frames. Phase Transform Correlation should be coupled with a novel ‘spectral smoothing’ filter to reduce noise in the short time windows. This filter focuses on identifying dominant frequencies.
4.  **Probabilistic Source Localization:**  Utilize a Bayesian network to estimate the 3D location of each sound source within each time frame. Incorporate microphone array geometry, signal strength, and phase information. Assign a confidence level to each source location.

**Phase 2: Temporal Sound Field Reconstruction**

1.  **Sparse Representation:** Represent the sound field as a sparse collection of sound sources over time. This will reduce computational load and allow for smooth scene rendering.
2.  **Temporal Linking:** Implement a ‘sound track’ linking algorithm.  For each identified sound source, the algorithm tracks its trajectory over time, linking sources in adjacent time frames. Use Kalman filtering to predict source movement and smooth trajectories.  Employ a ‘sound persistence’ metric—how likely a source is to continue existing in the next frame—to prevent spurious source creation.
3.  **Scene Rendering:**  Use the 3D rendering engine to visualize the reconstructed acoustic scene. The scene should dynamically update based on the tracked sound source positions over time. Implement controls allowing users to scrub through the timeline, adjusting playback speed.
4.  **Auralization:** Re-synthesize the sound field based on the reconstructed scene. Implement techniques like Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) to create a realistic 3D audio experience.

**Pseudocode (Temporal Linking Algorithm):**

```
function link_sources(sources_frame_t, sources_frame_t+1):
    // sources_frame_t: List of sound sources in frame t (location, confidence)
    // sources_frame_t+1: List of sound sources in frame t+1

    linked_sources = []

    for source_t in sources_frame_t:
        best_match = None
        min_distance = float('inf')

        for source_t+1 in sources_frame_t+1:
            distance = calculate_distance(source_t.location, source_t+1.location)
            if distance < min_distance:
                min_distance = distance
                best_match = source_t+1

        if best_match != None and min_distance < threshold:
            linked_sources.append((source_t, best_match))  // Store linked pair
        else:
            // Handle isolated source – potentially new source or disappearing source
            // Implement a ‘fade-out’ mechanism for disappearing sources

    return linked_sources
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems primarily focus on static source localization. This system aims to reconstruct a *dynamic* acoustic scene, enabling temporal manipulation and analysis of sound events. The hyper-granular TDOA estimation and temporal linking algorithm are key innovations. It isn't about finding sources, it's about reconstructing the acoustic environment *as it happened*.
