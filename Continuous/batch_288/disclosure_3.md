## Virtual Network 'Shadowing' for Predictive Scaling & Security

**Concept:** Extend the core mapping functionality to create dynamic "shadow" networks mirroring production environments, used for proactive security analysis, performance prediction, and automated scaling.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shadow Network Creation:** Introduce a system call/API endpoint to create shadow instances of virtual networks. Shadow networks inherit configuration (topology, access controls) from production but operate on synthetic or anonymized data.
*   **Traffic Mirroring & Replay:** Implement a mechanism to selectively mirror production traffic to the corresponding shadow network. This mirroring should be configurable (e.g., mirror only specific VM pairs, mirror a percentage of traffic).  Traffic replay functionality allows replaying captured traffic against the shadow network for testing or debugging.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Integrate an anomaly detection engine within the shadow network. This engine analyzes mirrored traffic for deviations from baseline behavior. Deviations trigger alerts and potential automated responses (e.g., firewall rule adjustments in production).
*   **Predictive Scaling Model:** Use the shadow network, driven by replayed or synthetic traffic, to predict resource needs for the production environment.  The system should automatically recommend scaling actions (e.g., adding VMs, increasing memory) based on predicted load.
*   **Synthetic User Behavior:** Enable the generation of synthetic user behavior within the shadow network to simulate realistic workloads and stress-test the system. Users should be able to configure the number of synthetic users, their behavior patterns, and the target applications.
*   **Mapping Extension:** Expand the existing mapping information to include metadata about mirroring status (enabled/disabled), mirroring rules, and shadow network identifiers.

**Pseudocode (Scaling Prediction Module):**

```
FUNCTION predict_scaling(shadow_network_id, traffic_data):
  // traffic_data is a stream of data collected from the shadow network
  
  // Calculate resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O)
  resource_utilization = analyze_resource_utilization(traffic_data)
  
  // Compare resource utilization to historical baseline
  deviation = compare_to_baseline(resource_utilization)
  
  // If deviation exceeds threshold:
  IF deviation > threshold:
    // Calculate scaling recommendations:
    scaling_recommendations = calculate_scaling(deviation)
    
    // Output scaling recommendations (e.g., add 2 VMs of type X)
    RETURN scaling_recommendations
  ELSE:
    // No scaling needed
    RETURN "No scaling required"
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**System Components:**

1.  **Mirroring Agent:** Deployed on physical hosts, captures and forwards traffic.
2.  **Shadow Network Manager:** Creates and manages shadow network instances.
3.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Analyzes mirrored traffic.
4.  **Predictive Scaling Model:** Forecasts resource needs.
5.  **Reporting Dashboard:** Visualizes anomaly detection results and scaling recommendations.
