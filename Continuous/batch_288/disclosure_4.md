## Secure Ephemeral Resource Delegation with Attestation Chains

**Concept:** Extend the credential chaining concept to dynamically delegate access to resources *without* persistent credentials, leveraging hardware attestation and time-limited tokens. This moves beyond simply *granting* permissions to actively *delegating* them for specific, verifiable tasks.

**Specifications:**

**1. Attestation Service:**

*   **Function:** Verifies the integrity and configuration of compute nodes before delegation.  Uses Trusted Platform Module (TPM) or similar hardware security module to generate a cryptographic attestation.
*   **Input:** Node configuration details (CPU, memory, OS version), requested resource access profile (e.g., “read access to dataset X, write access to log file Y”).
*   **Output:** Signed attestation statement confirming node integrity and resource request.

**2. Delegation Service:**

*   **Function:** Orchestrates the resource access delegation process. Receives requests, validates node attestation, and issues time-limited resource tokens.
*   **Input:** Client request, node attestation, resource access profile, desired token lifetime.
*   **Output:** Encrypted resource token with embedded access controls and expiration timestamp.

**3. Resource Access Gateway:**

*   **Function:** Intercepts all requests to protected resources. Validates resource tokens, enforces access controls, and logs access events.
*   **Input:** Resource request, resource token.
*   **Output:** Approved or rejected resource access.  Access logging data.

**4. Token Format:**

*   **Structure:** JSON Web Token (JWT) with the following claims:
    *   `iss` (Issuer): Delegation Service identifier.
    *   `sub` (Subject): Client identifier.
    *   `aud` (Audience): Resource identifier.
    *   `iat` (Issued At): Token creation timestamp.
    *   `exp` (Expiration): Token expiration timestamp.
    *   `res`: Resource access profile (detailed list of permitted operations).
    *   `att`: Attestation hash -  a cryptographic hash of the attestation statement.
*   **Encryption:** Token encrypted using a key derived from a shared secret established between the Delegation Service and the Resource Access Gateway.

**5. Operational Flow:**

1.  Client requests access to a resource.
2.  Compute node generates an attestation statement and sends it with the request to the Delegation Service.
3.  Delegation Service validates the attestation statement.
4.  Delegation Service generates a resource token with limited permissions and a short lifespan. The token is encrypted.
5.  Delegation Service sends the encrypted token to the compute node.
6.  Compute node presents the token to the Resource Access Gateway when requesting access to the resource.
7.  Resource Access Gateway decrypts the token and verifies its signature, expiration, and permissions.
8.  If all checks pass, the Resource Access Gateway grants access to the resource.

**Pseudocode (Resource Access Gateway - Token Validation):**

```
function validateToken(token, resourceId):
  try:
    decryptedToken = decrypt(token, sharedSecret)
    if decryptedToken.expiration < currentTime:
      return false // Token expired

    if decryptedToken.resourceId != resourceId:
      return false // Incorrect resource

    //Verify Attestation:
    attestationHash = calculateHash(decryptedToken.attestation)
    if attestationHash != verifiedAttestationHash:
        return false //Attestation Failed

    //Enforce access controls: (Check if requested operation is allowed)
    if requestedOperation not in decryptedToken.allowedOperations:
        return false

    return true // Token valid

  catch decryptionError:
    return false // Decryption failed
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond static credential chains by incorporating:

*   **Dynamic Attestation:** Verifying node integrity *at the time of access*.
*   **Ephemeral Tokens:** Reducing the attack surface by minimizing credential lifespan.
*   **Granular Access Control:** Allowing very specific permissions to be granted for a limited time.
*   **Hardware-Rooted Trust:** Leveraging TPM or similar hardware for a strong foundation of trust.
