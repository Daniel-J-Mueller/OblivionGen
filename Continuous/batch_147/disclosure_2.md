## Adaptive Acoustic Masking with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Expand upon the wind noise reduction by incorporating real-time biofeedback to create a personalized acoustic masking profile, dynamically adjusting to the user’s physiological state and environmental conditions beyond just wind. 

**Core Idea:**  Instead of *just* reducing unwanted noise, actively *shape* the soundscape to optimize focus, relaxation, or alertness, tailoring it to the individual’s needs *in the moment*. This goes beyond simple noise cancellation or wind reduction – it's about *intentional* sound design.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrated biofeedback sensors within the earbud (or paired wearable).
    *   Electrocardiogram (ECG) – heart rate variability (HRV) as a proxy for stress/relaxation.
    *   Electroencephalogram (EEG) – limited band EEG to detect brainwave activity indicative of focus (Beta waves) or relaxation (Alpha/Theta waves).  (Surface level sensors - minimal intrusiveness)
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) – skin conductance to measure arousal levels.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor - to adjust masking based on brightness (e.g. brighter=more masking)
*   **Audio Processing Unit (APU):** Dedicated low-power APU within each earbud.
*   **Microphone Array:** Utilize the existing dual microphone setup, augmented with a third, directional microphone for improved spatial audio analysis.
*   **Masking Sound Library:** Comprehensive library of natural and synthetic sounds. Categorized by frequency, amplitude, and psychoacoustic properties. Includes pink noise, brown noise, nature sounds (rain, waves, forest ambience), binaural beats, isochronic tones, and dynamically generated harmonic structures.
*   **Dynamic Masking Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    // Inputs: ECG_HRV, EEG_Focus, EDA_Arousal, Ambient_Light, Wind_Level, Microphone_Data
    function generate_masking_profile():
        // Normalize sensor data
        normalized_HRV = normalize(ECG_HRV)
        normalized_Focus = normalize(EEG_Focus)
        normalized_Arousal = normalize(EDA_Arousal)
        normalized_Light = normalize(Ambient_Light)
        normalized_Wind = normalize(Wind_Level)
    
        // Calculate Weighted Sum of Sensory Inputs
        total_score = (0.4 * normalized_HRV) + (0.3 * normalized_Focus) + (0.2 * normalized_Arousal) + (0.1 * normalized_Light)
    
        // Map total score to a "state" (e.g., relaxed, focused, stressed)
        if total_score > 0.7:
            state = "focused"
        else if total_score < 0.3:
            state = "relaxed"
        else:
            state = "neutral"
    
        // Select appropriate masking sounds based on state
        if state == "focused":
            masking_sounds = [“white noise”, “pink noise”, “binaural beats (high frequency)”, “isochronic tones (high frequency)”]
        else if state == "relaxed":
            masking_sounds = [“rain sounds”, “wave sounds”, “brown noise”, “binaural beats (low frequency)”, “isochronic tones (low frequency)”]
        else:
            masking_sounds = [“pink noise”, “wave sounds”]
    
        // Dynamically adjust sound parameters based on wind level and microphone data
        wind_attenuation = wind_level * 0.5 //Reduce overall sound if high wind
        spatial_audio_boost = microphone_data //Boost sounds from direction of greatest need
    
        //Generate Final Masking Profile
        final_masking_profile = {
            sounds: masking_sounds,
            attenuation: wind_attenuation,
            spatial_boost: spatial_boost
        }
    
        return final_masking_profile
    ```

*   **Personalization:** Machine learning algorithm to continuously refine the weighting of biofeedback parameters based on user preferences and feedback.  A simple "thumbs up/down" interaction for masking effectiveness.
*   **Integration:** API for third-party apps to integrate biofeedback data and control the masking profile.  Example: A meditation app could directly control the masking sounds to guide the user.
* **Directional Focus:** Use the third microphone to not only analyze wind, but also to identify the direction of *desirable* sounds (speech, music), and *prioritize* those sounds within the masking profile.
