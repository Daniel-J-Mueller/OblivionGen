## Adaptive Traffic Shunting with Predictive Failure Modeling

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive unit removal to *proactive* traffic shunting based on predictive failure analysis of individual TF servers *before* they reach a critical failure state. Instead of solely reacting to a unit dropping below a threshold, we’ll anticipate failures and subtly shift traffic *away* from servers exhibiting degrading performance.

**Specification:**

**1. Server Health Scoring:**

*   **Data Collection:** Each TF server continuously reports the following metrics:
    *   CPU Utilization
    *   Memory Utilization
    *   Network I/O (Packets/second, Bandwidth)
    *   Request Latency (Average, 95th Percentile) – measured *from* the server’s perspective.
    *   Error Rate (Internal errors, connection resets)
    *   Correlation ID count (for tracing individual requests)
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** A weighted scoring algorithm calculates a 'Health Score' for each server. Weights are configurable and learnable (see Section 4). A simplified example:

```
HealthScore = w1 * (1 - NormalizedCPUUtilization) +
              w2 * (1 - NormalizedMemoryUtilization) +
              w3 * (1 - NormalizedNetworkIO) +
              w4 * (1 - NormalizedRequestLatency) +
              w5 * (1 - NormalizedErrorRate)
```

    *   Normalization ensures all metrics are on a 0-1 scale.
    *   Metrics contributing to *degradation* have their values subtracted from 1 to create an inverse relationship.
*   **Thresholds:** Define three levels:
    *   **Green:** Health Score > 0.8 – Normal operation.
    *   **Yellow:** 0.5 < Health Score <= 0.8 –  Degraded performance. Initiate subtle traffic shifting.
    *   **Red:** Health Score <= 0.5 – Critical failure imminent. Aggressively shift traffic, potentially remove from service.

**2. Traffic Shunting Mechanism:**

*   **Weighted Routing:** Implement a weighted routing scheme within each TF unit.  Instead of purely ECMP, assign weights to each active TF server based on their Health Score.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  As Health Scores change, dynamically adjust the weights using a PID controller. This provides smooth, responsive traffic shifting. The PID controller's parameters are tunable.
*   **Granularity:** Traffic shunting occurs at the *connection* level. New connections are routed to servers with higher weights. Existing connections can be migrated (carefully) to avoid disruption, but this is optional and configurable.

**3. Predictive Failure Modeling:**

*   **Time Series Analysis:** Collect Health Score data over time.  Use time series analysis techniques (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM) to predict future Health Scores.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Identify deviations from expected Health Score trends. This can detect potential failures *before* they manifest as a significant drop in performance.
*   **Proactive Shunting:**  If the predictive model indicates a high probability of failure, *proactively* shift traffic away from the server *before* its Health Score drops into the Yellow or Red zone.

**4. Learning and Adaptation:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:**  Use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the weighting algorithm and PID controller parameters. The RL agent's reward function should prioritize minimizing latency, maximizing throughput, and avoiding packet loss.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitor the performance of the system and use this data to refine the predictive models and weighting algorithms.  The system should continuously learn and adapt to changing traffic patterns and server behavior.
*   **Dynamic Weight Calibration:** The 'w' values in the HealthScore algorithm are themselves subject to RL-based optimization. We dynamically learn which metrics are most predictive of genuine failure, increasing their weight over time.



**Implementation Notes:**

*   Requires modifications to the existing traffic forwarding system to support weighted routing and dynamic weight adjustment.
*   The predictive models and weighting algorithms can be implemented in a separate control plane.
*   Careful monitoring and testing are essential to ensure stability and avoid unintended consequences.
*   The granularity of traffic shunting (connection level vs. flow level) needs to be carefully considered.
