## Adaptive Code Smell Detection via Generative Models

**Specification:** A system employing generative AI to identify and contextualize code "smells" beyond simple pattern deviations, focusing on *semantic* anomalies rather than purely syntactic ones.

**Core Concept:**  The current patent detects deviations from *existing* patterns. This system *learns* expected code behavior through a generative model, then flags code that significantly deviates from what the model predicts *should* be there, even if that code isn't explicitly "wrong" according to static analysis.  It's about identifying code that *feels* off, indicating potential deeper issues.

**Components:**

1.  **Code Embedding Module:**  Uses a transformer-based language model (e.g., CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT) to create vector embeddings of code blocks (functions, classes, modules). This captures semantic meaning, not just token sequences.  Embedding size configurable (e.g., 768, 1024 dimensions).

2.  **Generative Model (Variational Autoencoder - VAE):**  Trained on a large corpus of source code. The VAE learns a latent space representation of "good" code. Input: Code embeddings from the Code Embedding Module. Output: Reconstructed code embedding.  Loss function: Reconstruction loss (e.g., mean squared error) + KL divergence (to regularize the latent space).

3.  **Anomaly Detection Module:**
    *   Calculates a reconstruction error (difference between original and reconstructed code embedding).
    *   Uses a threshold (configurable) to identify anomalies. Higher reconstruction error = more anomalous.
    *   Implements a statistical test (e.g., Z-score) to assess the significance of the reconstruction error.
    *   Employs an 'attention' mechanism during reconstruction to identify specific code tokens contributing most to the reconstruction error.

4.  **Contextualization Engine:**
    *   Retrieves similar code blocks from the training corpus based on cosine similarity in the latent space.
    *   Presents these similar blocks to the user alongside the anomalous code, highlighting differences.
    *   Suggests potential refactorings based on the most similar code blocks (using symbolic execution and program transformation techniques).

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Training Phase
corpus = load_code_corpus()
embedding_model = load_pretrained_embedding_model()

for code_block in corpus:
  embedding = embedding_model.encode(code_block)
  vae.train(embedding)

# Anomaly Detection Phase
def detect_anomaly(code_block):
  embedding = embedding_model.encode(code_block)
  reconstructed_embedding, attention_weights = vae.reconstruct(embedding)
  reconstruction_error = calculate_mse(embedding, reconstructed_embedding)
  z_score = calculate_z_score(reconstruction_error, mean, stddev) #Calculate mean/stddev from training
  if z_score > threshold:
      anomalous = True
      contextual_code = find_similar_code(embedding, latent_space, k=5)
      highlighted_differences = compare_code(code_block, contextual_code)
  else:
      anomalous = False
      highlighted_differences = None

  return anomalous, highlighted_differences, attention_weights
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large corpus of source code (e.g., GitHub repositories).
*   Code must be parsed and tokenized.
*   Data augmentation techniques (e.g., code simplification, code obfuscation) to improve robustness.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated code review.
*   Bug prediction.
*   Security vulnerability detection.
*   Code quality improvement.
*   Detecting stylistic inconsistencies.
