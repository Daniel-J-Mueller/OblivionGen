## Adaptive Data Tiering with Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** Implement a dynamic data tiering system that learns access patterns *across multiple* virtual machines (VMs) hosted on the same physical infrastructure. This goes beyond simple LRU or LFU algorithms and aims to anticipate data needs *before* they arise.

**Components:**

1.  **Global Access Monitor (GAM):** A system-level daemon running on each host that intercepts block I/O requests from all VMs. GAM doesn’t modify requests, it *observes* them.
2.  **Pattern Recognition Engine (PRE):** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, Long Short-Term Memory network) trained on historical I/O data collected by GAM. PRE analyzes access patterns across VMs.  Focus: Identifying correlations. Example: VM1 consistently accesses block X after VM2 accesses block Y.
3.  **Tiered Storage Abstraction Layer (TSAL):**  An interface that presents a unified storage view to VMs, hiding the physical location of blocks. TSAL manages data placement across multiple storage tiers:
    *   **Tier 0:** NVMe SSD – Highest performance, smallest capacity. For actively used blocks.
    *   **Tier 1:** SSD – High performance, moderate capacity. For frequently used blocks.
    *   **Tier 2:** HDD – Moderate performance, large capacity. For infrequently used blocks.
    *   **Tier 3:** Archival Storage (Remote) – Lowest performance, unlimited capacity. For cold data.  (Utilizing the remote archival systems described in the patent)
4.  **Prefetching Manager (PM):**  Based on PRE’s predictions, PM proactively fetches data from lower tiers to higher tiers *before* a VM requests it.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  VM issues a block I/O request.
2.  GAM intercepts the request and logs access metadata (VM ID, block ID, access type (read/write), timestamp).
3.  TSAL attempts to satisfy the request from the highest tier.
4.  If the block is not in the highest tier, TSAL retrieves it from the next lower tier and promotes it.
5.  PRE continuously analyzes logged access patterns.
6.  PM uses PRE’s predictions to proactively fetch blocks from lower tiers to higher tiers. Example:  If PRE predicts VM1 will need block Z after VM2 accesses block Y, PM fetches block Z from Tier 2/3 and places it in Tier 1/0 *before* VM1 requests it.
7.  A 'confidence score' is associated with each prefetch.  Lower confidence prefetches utilize less aggressive promotion (e.g., Tier 2 instead of Tier 0).

**Pseudocode (PM – Simplified):**

```
function prefetch_block(vm_id, predicted_block_id, confidence_score):
  if confidence_score > threshold:
    tier = min(max(confidence_score * tier_scale, 0), max_tier) //Scale confidence to a tier
    move_block(predicted_block_id, tier)
  else:
    log_skipped_prefetch(predicted_block_id)
```

**Innovation:**

*   **Cross-VM Prediction:**  Leveraging access patterns *across* VMs to improve prefetching accuracy.  Most prefetching algorithms focus on a single VM.
*   **Dynamic Tier Assignment:**  Using the confidence score to dynamically assign blocks to appropriate tiers, optimizing performance and capacity.
*   **Integration with Existing Archival Systems:** Seamlessly integrating with remote archival storage for cold data, minimizing storage costs.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The PRE continuously learns and adapts to changing access patterns, improving prediction accuracy over time.  Utilizes reinforcement learning techniques to refine predictions based on successful and failed prefetches.
