## Augmented Reality Assisted Material Estimation

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Hardware:** User device (smartphone, tablet, AR glasses) with:
    *   High-resolution camera (minimum 4K video capture).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer.
    *   Depth sensor (LiDAR or Time-of-Flight).
    *   Sufficient processing power for real-time image/point cloud processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Room Mapping Module:** Leverages existing patentâ€™s core room measurement functionality to create a 3D mesh of the room.
    *   **Material Database:** A comprehensive library of materials (paint, wallpaper, tile, flooring, fabric) with associated properties: cost per unit area, texture maps, reflectivity, required tools.  Constantly updated via cloud connection.
    *   **AR Visualization Engine:**  Overlays the material database onto the live camera feed, allowing the user to 'virtually apply' materials to surfaces in the room.  Handles lighting and shading to realistically represent material appearance.
    *   **Area Calculation Module:** Precisely calculates the surface area of each wall, floor, or ceiling in the 3D mesh.  Accounts for openings (windows, doors).
    *   **Cost Estimation Module:**  Combines area calculations with material costs to generate a detailed cost estimate for the project. Includes waste factor adjustments.
    *   **Ordering Integration:** Allows the user to directly order materials from integrated suppliers.
    *   **Tool Recommendation:** Suggests necessary tools based on selected materials.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   AR Overlay: Real-time visualization of materials on surfaces.
    *   Material Selection Palette: Browsable list of materials with previews.
    *   Cost Display:  Real-time updates to cost estimate.
    *   Ordering/Tool Recommendation Buttons.

**Innovation Description:**

This system extends the core room measurement capabilities by adding material estimation and AR visualization.  The user walks through the room, and the system, utilizing the patent's existing tech, maps the space.  The user then selects a material (e.g., paint color, wallpaper pattern) from the database. The system then overlays this material onto the live camera feed, allowing the user to see how it will look *in situ* before making a purchase. Crucially, the system automatically calculates the surface area of the walls, floor, and ceiling, factoring in windows and doors, and provides a detailed cost estimate that includes material costs and waste allowances.  The integration with suppliers allows for seamless ordering, and tool recommendations help ensure the user has everything they need for the project.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION EstimateMaterialCost(roomMesh, materialSelection):
  totalCost = 0
  FOR EACH surface IN roomMesh:
    surfaceArea = CalculateSurfaceArea(surface)
    materialCostPerUnit = materialSelection.costPerUnit
    wasteFactor = materialSelection.wasteFactor
    requiredQuantity = surfaceArea * wasteFactor
    costForSurface = requiredQuantity * materialCostPerUnit
    totalCost += costForSurface
  RETURN totalCost

FUNCTION VisualizeMaterial(cameraFeed, roomMesh, materialSelection):
  FOR EACH surface IN roomMesh:
    texture = materialSelection.texture
    ApplyTextureToSurface(surface, texture, cameraFeed)
  DisplayARView(cameraFeed)
```

**Novelty:**

While AR apps for visualizing paint colors exist, this system integrates the measurement process *with* the visualization and cost estimation, providing a complete end-to-end solution.  The automatic area calculation and integration with suppliers are key differentiators. It goes beyond simple visualization to provide practical, actionable information for renovation projects.
