## Dynamic Wardrobe Simulation & Outfit Generation

**Core Concept:** Extend the color palette recommendation system to create a *virtual wardrobe* for users, enabling outfit generation based on identified color palettes and user-defined style preferences. This goes beyond simply recommending individual items; it proactively *designs* outfits.

**Specs:**

**1. Wardrobe Data Structure:**

*   **Item Representation:** Each item in the virtual wardrobe is represented by:
    *   `ItemID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `ImageURL`: URL of the item image.
    *   `ColorPalette`: Dominant color palette extracted from the image (using the patent's color analysis techniques). Represented as a weighted list of RGB values.
    *   `Category`: Item category (e.g., shirt, pants, shoes, dress).
    *   `StyleTags`: User-defined style tags (e.g., casual, formal, bohemian, minimalist).
    *   `Seasonality`: Suggested seasons for wear (e.g., Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter).
    *   `Material`: Fabric or construction material.
*   **Wardrobe Storage:** User wardrobes are stored in a cloud database, accessible via user accounts.

**2. Outfit Generation Algorithm:**

*   **Input:**
    *   `BaseItem`: An item selected by the user as the starting point for an outfit (or a suggested item based on recent activity).
    *   `TargetPalette`: The color palette associated with the `BaseItem`.
    *   `StylePreference`: User-defined style tags.
    *   `Season`: Current or desired season.
    *   `Occasion`: User-defined occasion (e.g., work, party, date).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Palette Matching:** Search the user’s wardrobe for items with color palettes that *complement* the `TargetPalette`. Utilize a color harmony algorithm (e.g., analogous, complementary, triadic) to define ‘complementary’ palettes.  Weight matching based on both dominant colors and the weighting within the palettes.
    2.  **Category Filtering:** Filter the matching items based on required clothing categories to complete an outfit (e.g., if `BaseItem` is a shirt, search for pants, shoes, and accessories).
    3.  **Style Filtering:** Filter further based on `StylePreference` and `Occasion`.
    4.  **Outfit Scoring:** Assign a score to each potential outfit based on:
        *   Color Harmony Score.
        *   Style Relevance Score.
        *   Completeness Score (all necessary categories filled).
        *   Seasonality Score.
    5.  **Outfit Recommendation:** Present the top-scoring outfits to the user, displaying images of each item.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function generateOutfit(baseItem, stylePreference, season, occasion):
  matchingItems = findMatchingItems(baseItem.colorPalette, stylePreference, season, occasion)
  outfits = generateOutfitCombinations(matchingItems)
  scoredOutfits = scoreOutfits(outfits)
  return topN(scoredOutfits)
```

**3. Dynamic Palette Adjustment:**

*   **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to rate and provide feedback on generated outfits. This data is used to refine the color matching algorithms and adjust the weighting of color preferences.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate external data sources (e.g., weather forecasts, calendar events, location data) to dynamically adjust palette recommendations. For example, recommend warmer colors and heavier fabrics during colder weather.
*   **Trend Analysis:** Incorporate data from fashion trend databases and social media to identify popular color combinations and styles.

**4.  API Integration:**

*   **E-commerce Integration:** Integrate with online retailers to allow users to directly purchase recommended items.
*   **Social Sharing:** Allow users to share generated outfits on social media platforms.
*   **Stylist Integration:** Provide an interface for professional stylists to curate wardrobes and generate outfit recommendations for clients.

**Novelty:** While the original patent focuses on recommending individual items, this expands that functionality into a proactive outfit design system, leveraging user wardrobes, contextual awareness, and dynamic feedback loops. This moves beyond simple color matching to intelligent style curation. It’s also a full system and not only a method.
