## Dynamic Cipher Suite Negotiation with Trust-Established Fallback

**Concept:** Expand the cipher suite flexibility beyond simple association with devices. Implement a dynamic negotiation process *during* communication setup, factoring in not just device capabilities but also a trust score derived from prior interactions. If negotiation fails to establish a mutually acceptable, *current* cipher suite, fall back to a pre-established, highly secure cipher suite known to both parties, leveraging a "trust anchor."

**Specs:**

*   **Trust Score Calculation:** Each device maintains a rolling trust score for every other device it communicates with. This score is influenced by:
    *   Successful communication establishment (positive weighting).
    *   Failed communication attempts (negative weighting, decaying over time).
    *   Verification of digital signatures (positive weighting).
    *   Reporting of anomalies or security concerns by the other party (negative weighting, requiring human review/confirmation).
*   **Cipher Suite Preference List:** Each device maintains a prioritized list of supported cipher suites, including post-quantum secure options.
*   **Negotiation Phase:**
    1.  Initiating Device sends a ‘Cipher Suite Request’ message containing its preference list *and* its trust score for the Receiving Device.
    2.  Receiving Device responds with its highest-priority cipher suite from its list that is *also* present in the Initiating Device's list.  If no common cipher suite is found, it includes a "Negotiation Failure" flag.
    3.  If the Negotiation Failure flag is set, both devices revert to the pre-established “Trust Anchor” cipher suite. This suite should be a well-vetted, highly secure (but potentially computationally expensive) option, like a combination of AES-256-GCM with a strong elliptic curve key exchange.
    4. If both devices agree to a common cipher suite during negotiation, the session proceeds with that suite.
*   **Trust Anchor Cipher Suite:** This is a static, pre-configured cipher suite, known to both devices.  It must be regularly audited and updated as cryptographic best practices evolve. The default should be AES-256-GCM with Curve25519 key exchange, but configurable.
* **Session Key Exchange:** Key exchange continues as normal, but incorporates the trust score as an entropy source for session key generation. Higher trust = higher entropy contribution.
*   **Hardware/Software Requirements:** Implementation requires support for multiple cipher suites and key exchange mechanisms on both devices. Secure storage for the Trust Anchor configuration is critical.

**Pseudocode (Negotiation Phase):**

```
// Device A (Initiator)
trust_score = get_trust_score(Device_B)
cipher_suite_preference_list = get_cipher_suite_list()
send_message(Device_B, "Cipher Suite Request", trust_score, cipher_suite_preference_list)

// Device B (Receiver)
message = receive_message(Device_A)
trust_score_received = message.trust_score
cipher_suite_preference_list_received = message.cipher_suite_preference_list

common_cipher_suite = find_common_cipher_suite(cipher_suite_preference_list_received, my_cipher_suite_list)

if common_cipher_suite == null:
    use_trust_anchor_cipher_suite()
    send_message(Device_A, "Negotiation Failure", "Using Trust Anchor")
else:
    send_message(Device_A, "Cipher Suite Agreed", common_cipher_suite)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security: Dynamic negotiation allows devices to select the strongest mutually supported cipher suite, adapting to evolving threats.
*   Resilience: The Trust Anchor provides a fallback mechanism, preventing communication failure in the event of negotiation failure or compromised cipher suite support.
*   Improved Trust:  The trust score adds a layer of context, allowing devices to prioritize security based on prior interactions.
*   Future-proofing:  Facilitates the adoption of post-quantum cryptography by allowing devices to negotiate for and utilize new cipher suites as they become available and trusted.
