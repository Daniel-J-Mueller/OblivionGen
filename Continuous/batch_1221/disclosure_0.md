## Dynamic Workspace Reconfiguration via Projected Robotics

**Concept:** Extend the visual task cue system to *project* temporary robotic functionalities onto the workstation surface, allowing for dynamic reconfiguration of workspaces based on the item-handling task.

**Specifications:**

*   **Projected Robotic “Tools”:** The system will project visual cues representing temporary robotic functionalities onto the workstation surface. These could include:
    *   **Virtual Guides:** Projected lines indicating precise placement for items.
    *   **Virtual Barriers:** Projected lines defining temporary containment areas.
    *   **Virtual “Arms”:** Simulated robotic arms, visually guiding hand movements for specific tasks (e.g., insertion, alignment).
    *   **Temporary “Molds”:** Projected shapes defining the exact space for an item during assembly.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Utilize existing imaging sensors (and potentially add depth sensors) to:
    *   Track hand/agent movements in real-time.
    *   Detect collisions between physical objects and projected “tools”.
    *   Adapt projected elements based on real-world conditions.
*   **Control System Logic:**
    *   **Task Decomposition:** Break down complex item-handling tasks into sequential steps.
    *   **Projection Sequencing:** Define the order in which projected "tools" appear and disappear, guiding the agent through each step.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Modify projections based on sensor input, agent actions, and task progress.
*   **Pseudocode (Projection Logic):**

```
FUNCTION ProjectTaskCue(taskStep, agentPosition, itemPosition)
    // taskStep: current step in the item handling task
    // agentPosition: 3D coordinates of the agent's hand
    // itemPosition: 3D coordinates of the item being manipulated

    IF taskStep == "Placement_Guide" THEN
        ProjectLine(start = itemPosition, end = targetPosition, color = "blue")
    ELSE IF taskStep == "Containment_Area" THEN
        ProjectPolygon(points = [point1, point2, point3, point4], color = "green")
    ELSE IF taskStep == "Virtual_Arm_Guidance" THEN
        CalculateArmPath(start = agentPosition, end = targetPosition)
        ProjectPath(path = calculatedPath, color = "red")
    ELSE IF taskStep == "Temporary_Mold" THEN
        ProjectShape(shape = desiredShape, size = itemSize, position = itemPosition, color = "orange")
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Hardware Extensions:**
    *   **High-Resolution Projectors:** Capable of projecting crisp, accurate visuals onto various surfaces.
    *   **Depth Sensors:** For more accurate 3D tracking and collision detection.
    *   **Real-Time Processing Unit:** Dedicated hardware for processing sensor data and generating projections in real-time.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   **Task Creation Tool:** Allow engineers to define item-handling tasks and associated projected cues visually.
    *   **Calibration Routine:** Automatically calibrate the projection system to the workstation environment.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Assembly and manufacturing
*   Order picking and packing
*   Quality control
*   Training and onboarding of new employees.
