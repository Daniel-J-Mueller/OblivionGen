## Adaptive Stream Stitching with Predictive Pre-Fetch & AI-Driven Quality Assessment

**Concept:** Enhance adaptive bitrate streaming by dynamically stitching together segments from *multiple* input streams, not just switching between them, and pre-fetching based on AI-predicted bandwidth/latency shifts. This goes beyond failover and aims for *optimal* viewing experience even with fluctuating network conditions, and potentially leverages content-aware decisions.

**System Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multiple (N) independent video streams (e.g., from different CDNs, redundant encoding, or varying qualities) formatted as MPEG2-TS, HLS, DASH, or similar.  Each stream has associated metadata including encoding parameters (bitrate, resolution, codec), and ideally, recent performance metrics (latency, packet loss).
*   **Stream Analyzer Module:**  Continuously monitors each input stream for quality (using perceptual metrics like VMAF, PSNR-SSIM, or learned AI models – see AI Quality Assessment below) and network performance (latency, packet loss, bandwidth). It generates a 'quality score' and a 'network health score' for each stream.
*   **Stitching Engine:** The core component.  It receives the quality and network health scores. It dynamically assembles output segments by selecting portions (keyframes to keyframes) from one or more input streams. 
    *   Algorithm:  
        1.  Calculate a combined "Stream Fitness Score" (SFS) for each input stream: `SFS = (Quality Score * W_Q) + (Network Health Score * W_N)`.  `W_Q` and `W_N` are configurable weights.
        2.  For each output segment, select the source stream(s) with the highest SFS *for that segment*. The selection window is based on keyframe boundaries to maintain decoding continuity.
        3.  Implement seamless stitching: Use techniques like adaptive motion compensation or scene detection to minimize visible artifacts at segment boundaries.
*   **Predictive Pre-Fetch Module:** Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) – e.g., LSTM or GRU – trained on historical network performance data (bandwidth, latency) and viewer behavior (buffering events, seeking patterns). The RNN predicts future bandwidth availability and segment request times.
    *   Pre-fetch Algorithm: Based on the RNN's prediction, proactively download the next *N* segments from the selected streams *before* they are requested by the player. Adjust *N* dynamically based on prediction confidence.
*   **AI Quality Assessment Module:** A deep learning model (Convolutional Neural Network or Transformer) trained on a large dataset of video content and subjective quality assessments (e.g., MOS scores).  This module provides a more accurate and perceptually relevant quality score than traditional metrics.
    *   Model Input:  Raw video frames or encoded bitstream data.
    *   Model Output: Perceptual quality score (0-100) indicating the subjective quality of the video.
*   **Manifest Generator:** Creates a standard DASH or HLS manifest file describing the available segments and their sources.  The manifest should include information about the segment stitching and pre-fetching strategies.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Engine):**

```
function stitch_segment(time_range):
  best_stream = null
  max_sfs = -1

  for each stream in input_streams:
    quality_score = AI_Quality_Assessment(stream.get_segment(time_range))
    network_health_score = stream.get_network_health()
    sfs = (quality_score * W_Q) + (network_health_score * W_N)

    if sfs > max_sfs:
      max_sfs = sfs
      best_stream = stream

  segment = best_stream.get_segment(time_range)
  return segment
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Content-Aware Stitching:** The AI Quality Assessment module could identify scenes with high complexity or motion, and prioritize streams with higher bitrates for those scenes.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** The weights `W_Q` and `W_N` could be adjusted dynamically based on viewer preferences or network conditions.
*   **Peer-to-Peer Pre-fetching:** Leverage a peer-to-peer network to distribute pre-fetched segments and reduce load on the CDN.
