## Automated Robotic Swarm for Dynamic Re-Zoning & Item Relocation

**Concept:** Expand the mote/sensor network to enable a robotic swarm capable of dynamically re-zoning a materials handling facility *and* relocating items based on real-time demand or facility restructuring. The existing system passively confirms correct placement. This adds *active* relocation and zone adjustment.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Robotic Units (Swarm):** Small, agile robots (approx. 30cm x 30cm x 20cm) each equipped with:
    *   Lifting Mechanism: Capable of handling items up to 5kg.
    *   Navigation System: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using LiDAR and/or vision.
    *   Wireless Communication:  Mesh network compatible with existing mote system.
    *   Power Source: Rechargeable battery with automated docking/charging capability.
    *   Item Sensor:  Basic weight/size/barcode scanning to confirm item identity.
*   **Mote Enhancement:** Existing motes upgraded with:
    *   Directional Beacons:  Low-power RF beacons to assist robotic unit navigation.
    *   Zone Identifier: Unique identifier to define current zone membership.
*   **Central Control System (CCS):**  Server running zone management and swarm control algorithms.

**Software/Algorithms:**

*   **Dynamic Zone Mapping:** CCS maintains a live map of the facility, defining zones based on demand, inventory, or physical restructuring. Zone boundaries are communicated to motes.
*   **Swarm Task Assignment:** CCS assigns relocation tasks to individual robots based on proximity, load, and battery level. Tasks include:
    *   Item Retrieval: Navigate to source location, identify item, lift.
    *   Item Transport: Navigate to destination location.
    *   Item Placement:  Place item in designated receptacle.
*   **Collision Avoidance:** Distributed algorithm running on robotic units to avoid collisions with each other, stationary objects, and personnel.  Mote beacons aid in localization for improved accuracy.
*   **Re-Zoning Protocol:** CCS initiates re-zoning by:
    1.  Defining new zone boundaries.
    2.  Communicating zone changes to motes.
    3.  Assigning robots to relocate items based on new zone assignments.
*   **Exception Handling:** Robots report issues (e.g., blocked path, item not found) to CCS for intervention.
*   **Mote-Swarm Synchronization:**  Motes provide real-time location and status data to CCS. CCS uses this data to optimize swarm task assignment and track inventory.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Task Assignment):**

```
FUNCTION AssignTask(RobotID, ItemID, SourceZone, DestinationZone)

    // 1. Calculate optimal path from SourceZone to DestinationZone
    path = CalculatePath(SourceZone, DestinationZone)

    // 2. Check if path is clear (no obstacles)
    IF IsPathClear(path) THEN
        // 3. Assign task to robot
        robot.Task = { ItemID: ItemID, Path: path }
        robot.Status = "En Route"
        RETURN True
    ELSE
        // 4. Re-route or assign to another robot
        RETURN False
    ENDIF

END FUNCTION
```

**Operational Scenario:**

A warehouse experiences a surge in demand for a particular product.  The CCS detects this change and dynamically re-zones a portion of the warehouse to create a dedicated picking area for that product.  The CCS then assigns robots to relocate relevant items from their original locations to the new picking area, ensuring efficient order fulfillment.
