## Dynamic Scene Complexity Budgeting

**Concept:** Expand the scene change detection to not just *detect* changes, but to dynamically budget processing resources based on the *complexity* of the detected scene. Instead of simply switching between ‘active’ and ‘reduced’ processing, modulate resource allocation *continuously* based on visual and auditory information.

**Specs:**

**1. Scene Complexity Metrics Module:**

*   **Visual Complexity:**
    *   **Object Density Map:**  Calculate a heatmap of object density within each frame using object detection algorithms (YOLO, SSD, etc.). Higher density = higher complexity.
    *   **Motion Vector Variance:** Analyze optical flow/motion vectors.  Calculate the variance in direction & magnitude of motion.  High variance = higher complexity.
    *   **Texture Analysis:**  Apply algorithms (e.g., Local Binary Patterns, Gabor filters) to quantify textural complexity within the frame.
    *   **Depth Map Analysis:** (If depth sensor available) Measure the variance in depth values across the frame. High variance implies a complex scene.
*   **Auditory Complexity:**
    *   **Spectral Flatness Measure (SFM):** Calculate SFM to quantify the tonal richness of the audio. Higher SFM suggests a more complex soundscape.
    *   **Audio Event Count:** Use audio event detection algorithms to count the number of distinct sound events (speech, music, ambient noise). Higher count implies a more complex soundscape.
    *   **Harmonicity Analysis:** Measure the strength of harmonic components in the audio signal. Lower harmonicity might indicate noise or complex sounds.

**2. Complexity Budgeting Engine:**

*   **Weighted Summation:** Combine the individual complexity metrics (visual & auditory) into a single ‘Complexity Score’ using configurable weights.  Weights should be adjustable via a user interface or through machine learning.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Map the Complexity Score to a processing resource allocation level.
    *   Define a minimum and maximum processing level.
    *   Use a linear or non-linear function to map the Complexity Score to a processing level within the defined range.
    *   Resource levels could affect frame rate, resolution, object detection frequency, audio processing depth, etc.
*   **Resource Control Interface:** Implement an interface to control and adjust processing resources based on the allocated level. This interface would interact with the hardware (CPU, GPU, DSP) to adjust resource allocation.

**3.  Adaptive Learning Loop:**

*   **User Feedback Integration:** Allow users to provide feedback on the perceived quality of the processed content.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to fine-tune the weights of the complexity metrics and the mapping function between Complexity Score and processing level based on user feedback.
*   **Scene Type Classification:**  Train a classifier to identify common scene types (e.g., interview, sports broadcast, nature documentary).  Adjust complexity budgeting parameters based on the identified scene type.

**Pseudocode Example (Complexity Score Calculation):**

```
// Define weights
weight_visual_density = 0.4
weight_motion_variance = 0.3
weight_audio_event_count = 0.3

// Calculate individual metrics (functions return normalized values between 0 and 1)
visual_density = calculate_visual_density()
motion_variance = calculate_motion_variance()
audio_event_count = calculate_audio_event_count()

// Calculate Complexity Score
complexity_score = (weight_visual_density * visual_density) + (weight_motion_variance * motion_variance) + (weight_audio_event_count * audio_event_count)

// Normalize Complexity Score to be between 0 and 1
complexity_score = clamp(complexity_score, 0, 1)
```

**Potential Hardware Considerations:**

*   Access to a variety of sensors (camera, microphone, depth sensor)
*   Sufficient processing power (CPU, GPU, DSP) to handle complex calculations and dynamic resource allocation.
*   Real-time operating system for predictable performance.
