## Adaptive Resonance Floor & Furniture System

**System Overview:** A floor and accompanying furniture system that utilizes resonant inductive coupling *and* localized ultrasonic fields to not only transfer power and data but also to *adjust the perceived weight and friction* of furniture pieces, creating a dynamically responsive environment.

**Core Components:**

*   **Floor Tiles:** Hexagonal modular tiles containing:
    *   Resonant Inductive Coils: For wireless power transfer (as in the reference patent).
    *   Ultrasonic Transducers: Array of phased-array ultrasonic transducers embedded within the tile surface.
    *   Proximity/Weight Sensors: Detect furniture presence, weight distribution, and movement.
    *   Microcontroller/Communication Module: Local processing and communication with a central control system.
*   **Furniture Base:** Each piece of furniture has a specialized base incorporating:
    *   Resonant Receiver Coil: For receiving power.
    *   Piezoelectric Dampers: Strategically placed around the base perimeter, reacting to ultrasonic fields.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): Tracks furniture orientation and movement.
    *   Microcontroller/Communication Module: Local processing and communication.

**Operational Principles:**

1.  **Power & Data Transfer:** Standard resonant inductive coupling provides initial power and low-bandwidth data communication.
2.  **Dynamic Friction/Weight Adjustment:** The central control system analyzes furniture position and movement (from floor sensors and furniture IMUs). It then modulates the ultrasonic field emitted by the floor tiles *beneath* the furniture. 
    *   **Increased Friction:** Phased-array focusing of ultrasonic waves creates localized pressure waves that increase the static friction between the furniture base and the floor. This “locks” the furniture in place.
    *   **Reduced Friction:** Conversely, carefully modulated ultrasonic waves can *reduce* friction, allowing furniture to be easily moved with minimal effort.
    *   **Perceived Weight Adjustment:** Utilizing carefully controlled ultrasonic vibrations, the system can alter the effective normal force, *perceiving* a weight change for the user.
3.  **Advanced Control Algorithms:**
    *   **Path Prediction:** Utilizing IMU data, the system predicts furniture movement and proactively adjusts the ultrasonic field to create a smooth and controlled experience.
    *   **Collision Avoidance:** Detects approaching obstacles and increases friction to prevent collisions.
    *   **Haptic Feedback:** The system can generate localized vibrations on the furniture base to provide haptic feedback to the user.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
// Floor Tile (Per Tile)
LOOP:
    READ proximity_sensors, weight_sensors
    IF furniture_present:
        READ furniture_IMU_data (from furniture)
        CALCULATE desired_friction_coefficient (based on user input, predicted movement, safety parameters)
        ADJUST ultrasonic_transducer_array (to achieve desired friction)
        SEND furniture_IMU_data to central_control_system
    ENDIF
ENDLOOP

// Central Control System
LOOP:
    RECEIVE furniture_IMU_data (from all floor tiles)
    ANALYZE overall_environment_state (furniture positions, movements, potential obstacles)
    CALCULATE global_optimization_parameters (for friction, path prediction, safety)
    SEND optimization_parameters to all floor tiles
ENDLOOP
```

**Materials:**

*   Floor Tiles: Durable composite material with embedded electronics.
