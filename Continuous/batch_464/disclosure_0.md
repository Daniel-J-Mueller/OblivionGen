## Adaptive Echo Cancellation via Bioacoustic Modeling

**Core Concept:** Move beyond purely signal-based echo cancellation to incorporate rudimentary bioacoustic modeling of the human auditory system to *predict* echo characteristics *before* they occur, and dynamically adjust cancellation parameters.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on *synchronizing* audio streams for echo cancellation. This feels limited. The human brain doesn't "cancel" echoes through precise timing alignment alone. It predicts and filters based on learned acoustic environments. Can we inject some of that predictive capability into our system?

**System Specs:**

1.  **Bioacoustic Profile Database:** A database containing generalized acoustic profiles (e.g., "small room," "large hall," "open office") characterized by impulse responses and reverberation times. These are *not* precise room measurements, but rather categorized approximations.
2.  **Environmental Acoustic Classifier:** A real-time classifier (potentially using machine learning – initially, a rule-based system) that analyzes incoming audio (microphone signal) to *estimate* the current acoustic environment. Features:
    *   Reverberation time estimation.
    *   Room size estimation (based on spectral characteristics and late reverberation).
    *   Material estimation (based on early reflections – crude approximation of surfaces).
3.  **Predictive Echo Model:** Based on the classified acoustic environment, instantiate a predictive echo model. This model doesn't *reproduce* the echo, but rather *predicts* its onset, decay, and frequency characteristics *before* the outgoing audio produces it. Parameters:
    *   Initial delay (based on speaker/microphone distance).
    *   Reverberation time.
    *   Frequency-dependent gain (simulating absorption/reflection).
4.  **Adaptive Cancellation Filter:** The cancellation filter receives *both* the outgoing audio and the predicted echo. It calculates the cancellation signal *based on the prediction*, then *adjusts* the filter coefficients in real-time based on the *actual* echo observed in the incoming audio.
5. **Dynamic Gain Control:**  Implement a dynamic gain control system that adjusts the microphone's input gain in real-time based on the strength of the predicted echo. This can proactively reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of the echo, making cancellation more effective.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Cancellation Filter):**

```
// Inputs: outgoingAudio, predictedEcho, incomingAudio, currentFilterCoefficients

function adaptiveCancellation(outgoingAudio, predictedEcho, incomingAudio, currentFilterCoefficients):
  // 1. Combine predicted echo with outgoing audio
  combinedSignal = outgoingAudio + predictedEcho

  // 2. Calculate initial cancellation signal
  cancellationSignal = filter(combinedSignal, currentFilterCoefficients)

  // 3. Calculate error signal (residual echo)
  errorSignal = incomingAudio - cancellationSignal

  // 4.  Update filter coefficients based on error signal (LMS or similar algorithm)
  newFilterCoefficients = updateFilterCoefficients(errorSignal, currentFilterCoefficients, learningRate)

  // 5. Apply dynamic gain control
  dynamicGain = calculateDynamicGain(errorSignal)
  incomingAudio = applyGain(incomingAudio, dynamicGain)

  return incomingAudio, newFilterCoefficients
```

**Initial Implementation Considerations:**

*   Start with a limited set of acoustic profiles (e.g., 5-10).
*   Use a simple rule-based environmental classifier.
*   Implement a basic Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm for filter coefficient updates.
*   Focus on improving the accuracy of the environmental classifier as a primary objective.
*   Experiment with different methods for combining the predicted echo with the outgoing audio.
