## Dynamic Recommendation Decay Based on Predicted Future Need

**Concept:** Extend the "behavioral filtering" concept by not just weighting past behavior, but *predicting* future need and dynamically adjusting recommendation relevance accordingly. This moves beyond simply diminishing relevance after a purchase to proactively anticipating when a related need might re-emerge.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Inputs:**

*   **User Activity Data:** (As per the original patent – purchase history, browsing history, ratings, etc.)
*   **Item Meta-Data:** Category, sub-category, attributes (e.g., for TVs: size, resolution, smart features).
*   **Temporal Data:** Timestamps for all user activity.
*   **External Data (Optional):** Seasonal trends, economic indicators, local events (e.g., Super Bowl, Black Friday) that might influence needs.
*   **Item Lifecycle Data:** Estimates of product lifespan/replacement cycles (e.g., average TV lifespan, phone upgrade cycles).

**2. Core Logic: Need Prediction Engine**

*   **Need Decay Function:** A core algorithm that assesses the "decay" of a user's need for an item category *based on purchase and observed activity patterns*. This is more nuanced than simply diminishing weight after a purchase. Factors include:
    *   *Item Lifecycle*: Longer-lasting items have slower need decay.
    *   *Usage Frequency*: Observed usage (e.g., streaming hours on a TV) influences decay. High usage slows decay, low usage accelerates it.
    *   *Category Breadth*: Categories with many sub-categories (e.g., "Books") will have slower decay, as users might naturally explore different sub-categories even after a purchase.
    *   *Seasonal/Event Influence*: External data modulates decay rates (e.g., need for winter clothing increases seasonally).
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Employ machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks - RNNs) to *predict* when a user's need for a category might re-emerge. The model learns from historical data to anticipate purchase cycles.
*   **Need Score:** Each category is assigned a "Need Score" – a value representing the predicted likelihood of a future purchase within a defined timeframe.

**3. Recommendation Engine Integration:**

*   **Weighted Scoring:** Recommendations are scored based on:
    *   *Traditional Relevance:* Similarity to user preferences, browsing history, etc.
    *   *Need Score:* Categories with higher Need Scores receive a boost in their recommendation ranking.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** The relative weight of "Traditional Relevance" and "Need Score" is adjusted dynamically based on:
    *   *User Behavior:* If a user actively browses a category, “Traditional Relevance” is emphasized. If they haven’t engaged for a long time, “Need Score” is prioritized.
    *   *Confidence Level:* The confidence level of the Need Score prediction influences its weight. Higher confidence = stronger weighting.
*   **Proactive Recommendations:** If the Need Score for a category reaches a certain threshold, the system proactively presents relevant recommendations, even if the user hasn't explicitly expressed interest recently.

**4. Pseudocode (Recommendation Scoring):**

```
function score_recommendation(item, user):
  relevance_score = calculate_relevance(item, user)  // Traditional relevance
  need_score = get_need_score(user, item.category)

  confidence = get_confidence(need_score)

  // Dynamic weighting
  if user_browsed_category(user, item.category) recently:
    weight_relevance = 0.8
    weight_need = 0.2
  else:
    weight_relevance = 0.2
    weight_need = 0.8

  final_score = (weight_relevance * relevance_score) + (weight_need * need_score * confidence)
  return final_score
```

**5. System Architecture:**

*   **Data Ingestion Pipeline:** Collects and processes user activity data, item metadata, and external data.
*   **Need Prediction Service:** Houses the machine learning models and algorithms for calculating Need Scores.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** Integrates the Need Prediction Service to dynamically adjust recommendation rankings.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Continuously evaluates the performance of the new recommendation strategy against existing methods.
