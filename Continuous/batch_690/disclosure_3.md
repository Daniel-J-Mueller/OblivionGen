## Dynamic Sensory Substitution for Enhanced Attention Prediction

**Core Concept:** Augment user attention prediction by actively soliciting and interpreting physiological data *beyond* direct input or idle detection. Specifically, utilize readily available sensor data (microphone, camera) to infer cognitive load and emotional state, using this data to refine attention predictions and encoding adjustments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Client Device:** Existing device with integrated microphone and camera.
*   **Server:** Compute infrastructure capable of real-time audio/video processing and machine learning inference.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Audio Analysis Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time audio stream from client microphone.
    *   **Processing:**
        *   Voice Activity Detection (VAD) to identify speech segments.
        *   Prosody Analysis: Extract features like pitch, intensity, and speech rate to assess emotional state and cognitive load.  (e.g., rapid speech and high pitch may indicate stress/focus).
        *   Environmental Sound Classification: Identify ambient sounds (e.g., keyboard clicks, background noise) to contextualize user activity.
    *   **Output:**  Emotional State Score (0-100, higher = increased cognitive load/stress), Ambient Sound Profile (categorized list of detected sounds).
*   **Visual Analysis Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time video stream from client camera.
    *   **Processing:**
        *   Facial Expression Recognition: Detect key facial expressions (e.g., confusion, boredom, concentration).
        *   Pupil Dilation Measurement:  Estimate cognitive load and interest level based on pupil size. (Requires calibration/baseline).
        *   Gaze Tracking: Determine where the user is looking on the screen (requires calibration) and infer focus of attention.
        *   Head Pose Estimation: Detect head movements – fidgeting or stillness – as indicators of engagement.
    *   **Output:** Engagement Score (0-100, higher = increased engagement), Gaze Fixation Points (coordinates on screen), Head Movement Rate (movements/second).
*   **Attention Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Input:**
        *   User Input Data (from original patent – keyboard/mouse activity)
        *   Emotional State Score (from Audio Analysis)
        *   Engagement Score (from Visual Analysis)
        *   Ambient Sound Profile (from Audio Analysis)
        *   Gaze Fixation Points (from Visual Analysis)
    *   **Processing:**
        *   Weighted Fusion: Combine inputs using a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM). The weights should be dynamically adjusted based on user behavior.
        *   Attention State Prediction: Predict one of three states: Focused, Distracted, or Lost Attention.
    *   **Output:** Attention State (Focused, Distracted, Lost Attention).
*   **Encoding Adjustment Module:**
    *   **Input:** Attention State.
    *   **Processing:**
        *   Encoding Profile Selection: Map Attention State to an Encoding Profile.
            *   Focused: High Resolution, High Frame Rate, High Bitrate.
            *   Distracted: Moderate Resolution, Moderate Frame Rate, Moderate Bitrate.
            *   Lost Attention: Low Resolution, Low Frame Rate, Low Bitrate (or paused streaming – as per original patent).
    *   **Output:** Encoding Parameters.

**3. Pseudocode - Attention Prediction Engine:**

```
function predictAttention(userInput, emotionalState, engagementScore, ambientSound)
  // Weighting Factors (Dynamically Adjusted)
  weightUserInput = 0.4
  weightEmotionalState = 0.3
  weightEngagementScore = 0.2
  weightAmbientSound = 0.1

  // Combined Score
  combinedScore = (weightUserInput * userInputScore) +
                  (weightEmotionalState * emotionalStateScore) +
                  (weightEngagementScore * engagementScore) +
                  (weightAmbientSound * ambientSoundScore)

  // Attention State Classification
  if combinedScore > 0.7 then
    return "Focused"
  else if combinedScore < 0.3 then
    return "Lost Attention"
  else
    return "Distracted"
  end if
end function
```

**4.  Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**

Implement a reinforcement learning mechanism (e.g., Q-learning) to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to each input feature. Reward the system when its attention predictions accurately reflect user behavior (verified through explicit user feedback or implicit cues like eye blinks).

**5.  Calibration Routine:**

Include a calibration routine to establish baseline values for pupil dilation and facial expressions. This ensures accurate interpretation of physiological data across different users and lighting conditions.
