## Adaptive Deployment Canaries with Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Enhance deployment canaries with predictive rollback capabilities by leveraging real-time application performance metrics *and* infrastructure telemetry to anticipate deployment failures *before* they significantly impact users.  Instead of relying solely on error rates or latency increases, the system will learn ‘normal’ system behavior (application *and* infrastructure) and predict deviations that indicate an impending failure.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Telemetry Collection:** Implement agents within compute instances to collect:
    *   Application-level metrics: Request rates, error rates, latency percentiles, resource consumption (CPU, memory, disk I/O), custom application metrics.
    *   Infrastructure-level metrics: CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O, disk I/O, storage latency, kernel statistics.
*   **Real-time Data Pipeline:** Utilize a fast, scalable data pipeline (e.g., Kafka, Pulsar) to stream telemetry data to a central processing engine.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., time-series forecasting with LSTM or Transformer networks) to:
    *   Establish a baseline of ‘normal’ system behavior based on historical telemetry data.
    *   Detect anomalies in real-time telemetry streams.  This includes deviations in both application *and* infrastructure metrics.
    *   Calculate an ‘Anomaly Score’ reflecting the severity of the detected anomaly.
*   **Predictive Rollback Controller:**  Monitors the ‘Anomaly Score’ and triggers a rollback based on configurable thresholds.  Rollback can be immediate, or gradual (reducing the canary deployment size).
*   **Integration with Deployment Orchestration:** Interface with existing deployment tools (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) to automate the rollback process.

**2.  Anomaly Detection Model:**

*   **Model Type:** Hybrid Time-Series Forecasting & Multivariate Anomaly Detection.
*   **Input Features:**  Combined application and infrastructure metrics.
*   **Training Data:** Historical telemetry data from previous deployments.
*   **Model Architecture:**  LSTM-based time-series forecasting for predicting expected metric values, combined with a multivariate anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify deviations from the predicted values.
*   **Anomaly Score Calculation:**  Weighted combination of forecasting error (difference between predicted and actual values) and anomaly detection score.  Weights can be adjusted to prioritize application or infrastructure anomalies.
*   **Continuous Learning:**  Retrain the model periodically with new telemetry data to adapt to changing system behavior.

**3.  Predictive Rollback Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
function handleNewDeploymentBatch(batchSize, newVersionCode) {
  deployBatch(batchSize, newVersionCode)
  startMonitoring(newVersionCode)
}

function startMonitoring(newVersionCode) {
  while (deploymentActive) {
    telemetryData = collectTelemetryData()
    anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(telemetryData)

    if (anomalyScore > rollbackThreshold) {
      log("Anomaly score exceeds threshold. Initiating rollback.")
      rollbackDeployment(newVersionCode)
      break
    }

    log("Anomaly score: " + anomalyScore)
    sleep(monitoringInterval)
  }
}

function calculateAnomalyScore(telemetryData) {
  // Calculate forecasting error and anomaly detection score
  // Combine the scores with appropriate weights
  return weightedAnomalyScore
}

function rollbackDeployment(newVersionCode) {
  // Reduce the size of the canary deployment
  // Or, revert to the previous version
  // Implement appropriate rollback strategy based on configuration
}
```

**4. Configuration Parameters:**

*   `rollbackThreshold`: The anomaly score threshold that triggers a rollback.
*   `monitoringInterval`: The frequency of anomaly score calculation.
*   `canaryBatchSize`: The number of instances deployed in each canary batch.
*   `weightApplicationMetrics`: Weight assigned to application metrics in anomaly score calculation.
*   `weightInfrastructureMetrics`: Weight assigned to infrastructure metrics in anomaly score calculation.
*   `rollbackStrategy`:  Defines how to rollback the deployment (e.g., reduce canary size, revert to previous version).
