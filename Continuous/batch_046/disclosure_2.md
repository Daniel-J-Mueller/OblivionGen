## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Provisioning

**Concept:** Leverage predictive analytics based on observed connection parameter fluctuations to proactively adjust network topology and pre-provision resources *before* congestion or degradation occurs. This goes beyond reactive adjustment (like the patent) to anticipatory optimization.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Collection & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Metrics:** Collect not just reception/transmission parameters, but also:
    *   Round Trip Time (RTT) variations.
    *   Packet loss rates (per-node and aggregated).
    *   CPU/Memory usage of nodes (where accessible).
    *   Application-level data (e.g., video bitrate requests, game state updates – opt-in and anonymized).
*   **Temporal Resolution:** Collect data at intervals of 10-100ms.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Create time-series features from collected metrics:
    *   Moving Averages (various window sizes).
    *   Standard Deviations.
    *   Rate of Change.
    *   Spectral analysis (detecting periodic congestion patterns).

**2. Predictive Model Training:**

*   **Model Type:** Employ a hybrid approach:
    *   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:** For capturing long-term dependencies in network behavior.
    *   **Gaussian Process Regression (GPR):** For providing uncertainty estimates in predictions – critical for risk assessment.
*   **Training Data:** Use historical network data collected across diverse scenarios (time of day, application mix, user base).
*   **Output:** Model predicts:
    *   Probability of congestion on individual links within the next 5-30 seconds.
    *   Estimated bandwidth demand on each link.
    *   Optimal network topology changes to minimize predicted congestion.

**3. Topology Adaptation Engine:**

*   **Control Plane Integration:**  Integrate with existing network control planes (SDN controllers, network operating systems).
*   **Pre-Provisioning Actions:** Based on predictions, proactively:
    *   **Path Rerouting:** Shift traffic to alternate paths with lower predicted congestion.
    *   **Bandwidth Allocation:** Increase bandwidth allocation on predicted high-demand links.
    *   **Resource Scaling:** Dynamically scale up resources (e.g., virtual machine instances, network interface bandwidth) in anticipation of increased load.
    *   **Caching Prefetching:**  Pre-fetch content to edge caches based on predicted user requests.
*   **Policy Enforcement:** Implement policies to prioritize critical applications or users during congestion.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor actual network performance after topology changes and use this data to refine the predictive model.

**Pseudocode (Topology Adaptation Engine):**

```
function adaptTopology(predictedCongestion, currentTopology, policies) {
  // Calculate a 'risk score' based on predictedCongestion and policies.
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(predictedCongestion, policies);

  if (riskScore > threshold) {
    // Identify potential topology changes to reduce risk.
    potentialChanges = generateTopologyChanges(currentTopology);

    // Evaluate each potential change based on cost and predicted benefit.
    bestChange = evaluateTopologyChanges(potentialChanges, predictedCongestion);

    // Apply the best change to the network.
    applyTopologyChange(bestChange);

    // Log the change for monitoring and feedback.
    logTopologyChange(bestChange);
  }
}

function evaluateTopologyChanges(changes, predictedCongestion) {
  // This function needs to be detailed with weighting of bandwidth cost, latency, hop count
  // and also has to consider the predicted congestion.
  // Implement a cost/benefit analysis of each change
}

function applyTopologyChange(change) {
  // This function would have to interface with existing SDN controllers etc.
}
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simple reactive congestion control. By *predicting* network bottlenecks *before* they occur, it allows for proactive optimization, leading to a smoother user experience and more efficient resource utilization. The integration of predictive modeling with topology adaptation is a significant advancement over existing approaches.  The use of GPR to provide confidence intervals on predictions allows for a risk-aware approach to topology changes, minimizing the potential for disruption.
