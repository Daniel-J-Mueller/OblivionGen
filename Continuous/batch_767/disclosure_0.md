## Dynamic Instance 'Shadowing' for Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the detachment functionality to include a 'shadowing' phase, where detached instances *continue* to report metrics, but are not actively serving traffic. This data feeds a predictive scaling model that anticipates future load *before* it hits the active instances.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Scaling Module (PSM) - integrates with existing Auto Scaling Group (ASG) infrastructure.
*   **Trigger:**  An instance detachment event initiates shadowing.
*   **Shadowing Phase:**
    *   Detached instance retains monitoring agents (CPU, memory, network I/O).
    *   Monitoring data is streamed *solely* to the PSM – not used for active load balancing.
    *   Shadowing duration configurable per ASG or instance type.
*   **Predictive Model:**
    *   PSM employs time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) trained on historical and shadowed instance data.
    *   Model predicts future resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) with a configurable confidence interval.
    *   Model accounts for seasonality, trends, and external factors (e.g., scheduled events, marketing campaigns).
*   **Scaling Actions:**
    *   PSM triggers scaling events (launch/terminate instances) *proactively* based on predicted utilization, *before* active instances reach capacity.
    *   Scaling decisions consider predicted confidence intervals – higher confidence = more aggressive scaling.
    *   Integration with existing instance launch/termination workflows.
*   **Workflow Pseudocode:**

```
// Instance Detachment Event
On InstanceDetached(instance_id):
    EnableMonitoringAgents(instance_id, destination=PSM)
    SetShadowMode(instance_id, duration=config.shadow_duration)

//PSM - Data Collection & Prediction
While running:
    CollectMetrics(instance_id) from Shadow Instances
    RunTimeSeriesForecast(metrics)
    predicted_utilization = Forecast(metrics)
    if predicted_utilization > threshold:
        InitiateScalingEvent(predicted_capacity_needed)

// Scaling Event Handler
On ScalingEvent(capacity_change):
    LaunchInstances(number=capacity_change) or TerminateInstances(number=abs(capacity_change))

```

*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) for storing shadowed instance metrics.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/shadow/config`: Configure shadowing duration and predictive model parameters.
    *   `/shadow/metrics`: Stream shadowed instance metrics to the PSM.
    *   `/predict/capacity`: Request predicted capacity based on current and historical data.
*   **Considerations:**
    *   Cost of maintaining shadowed instances.
    *   Accuracy of the predictive model. Requires robust training and validation.
    *   Integration with existing monitoring and alerting systems.
