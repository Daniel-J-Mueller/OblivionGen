## Adaptive Click-to-Call Contextualization via Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**Specification:**

This system enhances fraud detection in click-to-call scenarios by incorporating real-time contextual data from the user's device *beyond* IP address and phone number. It aims to establish a "trust score" based on a holistic understanding of the user's interaction.

**Components:**

1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition Module:** This module accesses data from the user’s device (with appropriate permissions) including:
    *   **Accelerometer/Gyroscope:**  Detects physical movement – stationary, walking, in transit.
    *   **Microphone:** Captures ambient audio – presence of background noise (call center, quiet room, street), speech characteristics (if permission granted - potentially flagging robotic/synthesized voice).
    *   **GPS (if available):**  Confirms geographic location and consistency with expected user behavior.
    *   **Screen State:** Determines if the screen is active, unlocked, or in a specific application.
    *   **Touch/Gesture Input:** Analyzes the way the user interacts with the screen (speed, pressure, patterns).
2.  **Data Preprocessing & Feature Extraction:**  Raw sensor data is processed to extract relevant features.
    *   **Accelerometer/Gyroscope:**  Calculate variance, standard deviation, entropy of movement. Flag abrupt changes.
    *   **Microphone:**  Calculate sound pressure level (SPL), identify dominant frequencies, run basic audio classification (e.g., speech, music, noise).
    *   **GPS:** Calculate speed, distance travelled, consistency with past location data.
    *   **Screen State:**  Record application context (e.g., clicking from a legitimate website vs. a suspicious ad).
    *   **Touch/Gesture Input:** Analyze touch speed, pressure, and patterns. Flag robotic or unusual input.
3.  **Multi-Modal Fusion Engine:** A deep learning model (e.g., Transformer network) combines features from all sensor modalities.  This model learns complex relationships between sensor data and fraudulent activity. 
    *   **Input:** Concatenated feature vectors from each sensor modality.
    *   **Architecture:** Multi-layer Transformer network with attention mechanisms to prioritize relevant features.
    *   **Output:** A "contextual trust score" ranging from 0 to 1, representing the likelihood of legitimate user interaction.
4.  **Fraud Detection Integration:** The contextual trust score is integrated into the existing fraud detection system.
    *   **Weighted Combination:** Combine the contextual trust score with the existing IP/phone number-based confidence score.
    *   **Adaptive Threshold:** Adjust the fraud detection threshold based on the contextual trust score.  Higher trust scores allow for more lenient thresholds.
5. **Feedback Loop:** System records outcomes (fraudulent/legitimate) and feeds them back into the Multi-Modal Fusion Engine for continuous learning and model refinement.

**Pseudocode (Fusion Engine):**

```
function fuse_sensor_data(accel_features, gyro_features, audio_features, gps_features, screen_features, touch_features):
    # Concatenate features
    combined_features = concat(accel_features, gyro_features, audio_features, gps_features, screen_features, touch_features)

    # Pass through Transformer network
    trust_score = transformer_network(combined_features)

    return trust_score
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Sensor data should be anonymized and stored securely with appropriate privacy controls.
*   Metadata about the data (timestamp, device ID, etc.) should be stored separately.

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond traditional IP/phone number-based fraud detection by incorporating real-time contextual data from the user’s device, creating a more holistic and accurate fraud detection system.  The fusion of multi-modal sensor data using a deep learning model enables the system to adapt to evolving fraud patterns and improve accuracy over time.
