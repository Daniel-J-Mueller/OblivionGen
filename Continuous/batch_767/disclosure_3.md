## Dynamic Recommendation ‘Echo’ System

**Concept:** Extend filtered recommendations by introducing a temporary ‘echo’ of removed items, subtly presented to the user as related content, allowing for exploration *after* an initial diverse recommendation set is presented.

**Specs:**

1.  **Core Function:** Implement a secondary data structure ("Echo Queue") associated with each user session. This queue stores items filtered out by the similarity filter described in the base patent.

2.  **Echo Presentation:** After the primary filtered recommendation set is displayed, a distinct UI element ("Echo Carousel") appears *below* the main recommendations. This carousel displays a small, curated subset of items from the Echo Queue. The number of items in the carousel is configurable (e.g., 3-5).

3.  **Curatorial Algorithm:** The Echo Queue items are *not* presented in a random order. Apply a weighted ranking function that considers:
    *   **Similarity Score:** Items with higher similarity scores to items *within* the primary recommendation set are prioritized. This creates a sense of continuity.
    *   **User Interaction History:** Prioritize items similar to those the user has previously interacted with (clicked, purchased, rated).
    *   **Temporal Decay:**  Items that were filtered out *earlier* in the session are given lower priority (the system ‘forgets’ about them over time).

4.  **UI/UX Specifications:**
    *   The Echo Carousel is visually distinct from the primary recommendations (e.g., different background color, smaller item thumbnails).
    *   A clear label ("You might also like…", "Related picks…") indicates that these items were previously filtered.
    *   Items in the Echo Carousel have reduced prominence compared to the primary recommendations.
    *   Each item in the carousel provides a brief explanation of *why* it was filtered (“Similar to [Item X]”, “We thought you might find this redundant”).
    *   Provide a mechanism for users to explicitly ‘dismiss’ an item from the Echo Queue or signal that they are *not* interested.

5.  **Data Pipeline Integration:**
    *   The filtering component needs to pass filtered item IDs *and* the similarity score used for filtering to a dedicated ‘Echo Queue Manager’ service.
    *   The Echo Queue Manager stores this data per-user session.
    *   The Echo Queue Manager service provides an API endpoint for the UI to request a curated set of ‘echo’ items.

**Pseudocode (Echo Queue Manager Service):**

```
function get_echo_items(user_id, session_id, num_items):
    // Retrieve filtered items and similarity scores from session store
    filtered_items = get_from_session_store(user_id, session_id, "filtered_items")

    // Apply weighted ranking function
    ranked_items = calculate_rank(filtered_items, user_interaction_history)

    // Select top N items
    top_n_items = ranked_items.slice(0, num_items)

    return top_n_items
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased User Engagement:** Provides a second layer of discovery without overwhelming the initial recommendation set.
*   **Transparency:**  Explains *why* certain items were not initially recommended, fostering trust.
*   **Data Enrichment:** Captures user interactions with ‘echo’ items to refine future filtering and recommendation algorithms.
*   **Reduced Perceived Redundancy:** Addresses the issue of over-filtering by subtly reintroducing potentially relevant items.
