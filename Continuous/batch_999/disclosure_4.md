## Adaptive Luminescence & Biometric Integration - "Aura"

**Concept:** A reading light that doesn’t just illuminate, but *responds* to the user, dynamically adjusting not only brightness and color temperature, but also incorporating subtle biometric feedback for optimized cognitive performance and mood regulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Light Source:** Micro-LED array, capable of individual pixel control. Minimum 10,000 pixels.  Resolution: 64x156.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Bio-Impedance Sensor:** Integrated into the light's mounting point (headboard, clip, etc.).  Measures subtle changes in skin conductivity (GSR) to estimate stress levels and engagement. Range: 0-100 kOhms, Accuracy: +/- 5%.
    *   **Proximity Sensor:** Infrared, to detect user presence and reading distance. Range: 0.1m – 1.0m, Accuracy: +/- 2cm.
    *   **Ambient Light Sensor:**  Photodiode, to adjust light output based on surrounding environment. Range: 0.1 - 100,000 lux.
    *   **Eye-Tracking (Optional):** Miniaturized infrared eye-tracker, embedded in the light housing.  Tracks pupil dilation and gaze direction.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded ARM Cortex-M7 processor with dedicated neural network accelerator. Minimum 400 MHz clock speed.
*   **Power:**  USB-C PD (Power Delivery) with battery backup. Battery capacity: 2000 mAh.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth 5.2 Low Energy for firmware updates and data logging (optional).

**Algorithm & Functionality:**

1.  **Baseline Calibration:** Upon initial use, the system establishes a biometric baseline for the user (GSR, etc.) during a brief "relaxation" period.
2.  **Real-time Monitoring:** The GSR sensor constantly monitors the user's stress level.
3.  **Adaptive Lighting Profiles:**  Based on GSR readings, the light dynamically adjusts:
    *   **Stress Detected (GSR High):** Shifts to warmer color temperatures (2700K-3000K), lower brightness, and subtle pulsing effect (mimicking calming breathing).
    *   **Focus Needed (GSR Low, reading detected):** Shifts to cooler color temperatures (4000K-5000K), increased brightness, and potentially introduces subtle flicker to improve alertness.
    *   **Relaxation Mode (no reading detected):** Shifts to very warm color temperatures (2200K), low brightness, and simulates a "fireplace" effect.
4.  **Proximity-Based Adjustment:** Brightness automatically adjusts based on reading distance.  Closer = Dimmer. Further = Brighter.
5.  **Eye-Tracking Integration (Optional):**  If eye-tracking is enabled, the light focuses its brightest illumination on the text the user is currently reading, improving readability and reducing eye strain. Algorithm: Ray tracing based on gaze vector.
6.  **Data Logging (Optional):** GSR data can be logged (with user consent) to provide insights into reading habits and stress levels.

**Housing:**

*   Flexible, goose-neck design with magnetic base for versatile mounting.
*   Materials: Aluminum alloy with soft-touch silicone overmold.
*   Dimensions: 30cm (length), 5cm (diameter).
*   Finish: Matte black or silver.
