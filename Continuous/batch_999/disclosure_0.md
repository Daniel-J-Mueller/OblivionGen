**Personalized Document Synthesis & Embodied Agents**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing document search/retrieval system to not just *find* relevant information, but to *synthesize* new, personalized documents tailored to the user’s specific needs, delivered via an embodied conversational agent.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Beyond indexing documents, construct a knowledge graph representing entities, relationships, and concepts within the indexed corpus. This allows for semantic understanding beyond keyword matching.
*   **User Profile & Need Modeling:** Maintain a dynamic user profile capturing:
    *   Explicit preferences (stated interests, document types)
    *   Implicit needs (inferred from search history, reading patterns, project associations)
    *   Current task/goal (contextual awareness – e.g., “researching competitor X for a sales presentation”)
*   **Document Synthesis Engine:**
    *   Utilizes the knowledge graph and user profile to identify relevant information *across multiple documents*.
    *   Employs a generative AI model (e.g., a large language model) to:
        *   Summarize key insights.
        *   Re-write/re-frame information in a style appropriate for the user’s needs.
        *   Combine information from disparate sources into a cohesive document.
        *   Generate supporting visuals (charts, diagrams) as needed.
*   **Embodied Conversational Agent:**
    *   A virtual assistant (visual avatar or voice-only) that interacts with the user.
    *   Delivers synthesized documents through natural language conversation.
    *   Adapts presentation based on user feedback and real-time understanding of their cognitive load (e.g., simplifies explanations if the user appears confused).
    *   Allows for interactive exploration of the synthesized document (e.g., user can ask clarifying questions, request more detail on specific topics).

**III. Pseudocode (Document Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesizeDocument(userProfile, searchQuery, knowledgeGraph, indexedDocuments):
  relevantDocuments = retrieveRelevantDocuments(searchQuery, indexedDocuments)
  extractedConcepts = extractKeyConcepts(relevantDocuments, knowledgeGraph)
  personalizedContent = generatePersonalizedContent(extractedConcepts, userProfile)
  synthesizedDocument = assembleSynthesizedDocument(personalizedContent)
  return synthesizedDocument
```

**IV. Novelty & Differentiation:**

This goes beyond simple search and retrieval, or even summarization. It proactively *creates* new knowledge artifacts tailored to the user, delivered via an intelligent interface that adapts to their needs.  The combination of knowledge graph-driven understanding, generative AI, and an embodied agent creates a significantly more engaging and effective experience.

**V. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-Modal Synthesis:**  Integrate support for other content types (e.g., code snippets, audio recordings, video clips).
*   **Collaborative Synthesis:**  Allow multiple users to collaborate on the creation of a synthesized document.
*   **Proactive Knowledge Delivery:**  Automatically synthesize and deliver relevant information to users based on their ongoing activities and projects.
