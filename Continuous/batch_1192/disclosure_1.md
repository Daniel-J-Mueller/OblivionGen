## Dynamic Email Address 'Weighting' & Predictive Resend

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple round-robin to incorporate a predictive resend system leveraging recipient engagement data and dynamic weighting of email addresses. Instead of simply cycling through addresses, the system *learns* which addresses are most likely to result in successful delivery *and* user interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection:**
    *   Track open rates, click-through rates, and bounce rates for *each* email address associated with a user.
    *   Monitor for "silent failures" – emails delivered successfully but with no engagement (no open, no click). Treat these similarly to soft bounces.
    *   Gather data on user-reported spam complaints for each address.
*   **Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   Assign a “weight” to each email address.
    *   Initial weight: 1.0 (all addresses start equal).
    *   Weight adjustment:
        *   Open/Click: +0.05
        *   Soft Bounce: -0.10
        *   Hard Bounce: -0.50
        *   Spam Complaint: -1.00
        *   Silent Failure: -0.02
        *   Weight floor: 0.1 (prevent addresses from being completely excluded).
        *   Weight cap: 1.5 (prevent a single address from dominating).
*   **Resend Logic:**
    *   Prior to sending, calculate the weighted probability of success for each address.  (Weight / Sum of all weights).
    *   Select the address with the *highest* weighted probability.
    *   If the first attempt fails (hard bounce, no delivery receipt), *immediately* attempt the next highest weighted address. This continues until a successful delivery is confirmed.
    *   Implement a ‘decay’ function. Weights gradually decrease over time if no activity is seen.  (e.g., -0.001 per day).
*   **Learning Component:**
    *   Employ a simple machine learning model (e.g., a decaying average) to predict the likelihood of success for each address based on historical data.
    *   Model should consider time-of-day, day-of-week, and email content as features.
*   **User Interface (Admin Panel):**
    *   Display the weight assigned to each email address for a user.
    *   Allow administrators to manually override weights.
    *   Provide reports on address performance (open rates, bounce rates, etc.).
*   **Pseudocode (Resend Logic):**

```
function select_email_address(user_id, email_list):
    weights = calculate_weights(user_id, email_list) // Based on historical data
    total_weight = sum(weights)
    probabilities = [weight / total_weight for weight in weights]
    
    selected_index = weighted_random_choice(probabilities)
    return email_list[selected_index]
    
function weighted_random_choice(probabilities):
    # Implement weighted random selection (e.g., using cumulative probabilities)
    # Return the index of the selected item

function attempt_send(email_address, message_content):
    # Attempt to send email to the specified address
    # Return True if successful, False otherwise

function resend_loop(user_id, email_list, message_content):
    for email_address in sorted(email_list, key=lambda x: calculate_weight(user_id, x), reverse=True):
        if attempt_send(email_address, message_content):
            return True
    return False
```

This system moves beyond simple redundancy to intelligent routing, increasing deliverability and engagement by adapting to user behavior. It provides a dynamic and responsive solution to the challenge of email delivery in a complex and ever-changing environment.
