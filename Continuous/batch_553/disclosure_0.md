## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Personalized Beamforming

**Concept:** Expand beyond directional audio capture to create a real-time, localized acoustic map of the environment, adapting beamforming not just to *find* a sound source, but to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene and personalize the audio experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware:**

*   **Microphone Array:** High-density spherical microphone array (64+ microphones) integrated into the device (phone, speaker, robot, etc.).  Higher density is crucial for accurate spatial resolution.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  High-precision 9-axis IMU for tracking device orientation and movement *in addition* to the data already collected by the patent.
*   **Dedicated Audio Processing Unit (APU):** Low-latency, high-throughput APU optimized for real-time beamforming, spatial audio processing, and machine learning inference.
*   **Optional Depth Sensor:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) or structured light sensor for providing a basic depth map of the immediate surroundings (improves reconstruction accuracy but isn't strictly required).

**2. Software – Acoustic Reconstruction Module:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Synchronized capture of audio data from all microphones and IMU data.
*   **Spherical Harmonic Decomposition:**  Decompose the captured sound field into spherical harmonics. This allows for a compact representation of the 3D sound field.
*   **Ambisonic Encoding:** Encode the spherical harmonic coefficients into an ambisonic representation (HOA - Higher Order Ambisonics). This creates a 3D sound field representation.
*   **Source Localization & Tracking:** Utilize machine learning (e.g., deep neural networks) trained on large datasets of acoustic scenes to identify and track individual sound sources.  This goes beyond simple beamforming to *separate* overlapping sounds.
*   **Reverberation Mapping:** Model the reverberation characteristics of the environment (room size, surface materials) to improve source separation and localization accuracy.

**3. Software – Personalized Beamforming Module:**

*   **User Profile:** Store user preferences (e.g., preferred voice enhancement settings, preferred spatial audio profiles).
*   **Adaptive Beamforming:**  Dynamically adjust beamforming weights based on the reconstructed acoustic scene, user profile, and detected sound sources. This goes beyond simply pointing a beam at a voice; it sculpts the entire soundscape.
*   **Personalized Spatial Audio:** Render spatial audio effects (e.g., virtual surround sound, sound source panning) tailored to the user's listening preferences and the reconstructed acoustic scene.
*   **Acoustic Masking:**  Intelligently suppress unwanted sounds (e.g., background noise, competing voices) based on the reconstructed acoustic scene and user preferences.
*   **Dynamic EQ/Filtering:** Apply personalized EQ and filtering settings to each detected sound source, optimizing audio clarity and intelligibility.

**4. Pseudocode - Adaptive Beamforming Loop:**

```
loop:
    // 1. Acquire Data
    audio_data = capture_audio()
    imu_data = capture_imu()

    // 2. Acoustic Reconstruction
    acoustic_map = reconstruct_acoustic_scene(audio_data, imu_data)  // Uses spherical harmonics, ML
    sound_sources = detect_sound_sources(acoustic_map)

    // 3. Personalized Beamforming
    user_profile = load_user_profile()

    for each sound_source in sound_sources:
        beamforming_weights = calculate_beamforming_weights(sound_source.location, user_profile.preferences)
        enhanced_audio = apply_beamforming(audio_data, beamforming_weights)
        apply_dynamic_eq(enhanced_audio, sound_source.characteristics, user_profile.eq_settings)

    // 4. Output Audio
    output_audio = enhanced_audio

    // Repeat
```

**Novelty:** This extends traditional beamforming beyond simple source localization. It creates a *dynamic* acoustic model of the environment, personalizes the audio experience, and intelligently sculpts the soundscape to optimize clarity, intelligibility, and user enjoyment.  The combination of spherical harmonic decomposition, machine learning-based source separation, and personalized beamforming is unique.
