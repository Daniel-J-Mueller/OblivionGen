## Dynamic Color Palette Generation via Environmental Sensors

**Specification:** A system integrating real-time environmental data (light levels, ambient colors, weather conditions) with the color palette generation process described in patent 9514543. This aims to create color palettes *responsive* to the user’s immediate surroundings, and to provide 'mood' based palettes.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Environmental Sensor Array:**  RGB light sensor, lux meter, temperature sensor, humidity sensor, microphone (for ambient sound analysis).  Integrated into a small, portable device (e.g., clip-on for clothing, or integrated into a smart device).  Alternatively, a networked system utilizing data from existing smart home devices.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded system (Raspberry Pi, Arduino) or connection to a cloud-based server.
*   **Communication Module:** Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or cellular connection.
*   **Display (Optional):** Small screen to visualize generated palettes and sensor data.

**Software Components:**

*   **Sensor Data Acquisition Module:**  Collects and pre-processes data from the environmental sensor array.  Calibration and noise filtering algorithms are critical.
*   **Color Extraction Module:** Analyzes the sensor data to determine dominant colors and light levels in the environment.  Algorithms may include:
    *   **Dominant Color Detection:** K-Means clustering or similar techniques to identify the most prevalent colors.
    *   **Light Level Analysis:**  Determines overall brightness and contrast.
    *   **Ambient Color Mapping:**  Maps sensor readings to a standardized color space (e.g., sRGB, CIELAB).
*   **Palette Generation Engine:**  Modified version of the palette generation process outlined in patent 9514543. Incorporates the environmental data as input parameters. Key modifications:
    *   **Weighting Factors:**  Adjusts the weights of colors in the generated palette based on their prevalence in the environment. Colors matching ambient colors are given higher weights.
    *   **Mood Mapping:**  Associates environmental conditions with specific “moods” (e.g., “warm & cozy” for low light and reddish tones, “fresh & vibrant” for bright sunlight and blue/green hues).  The mood selection influences the palette generation algorithm.
    *   **Palette Diversity Control:** Algorithm to ensure sufficient color diversity in the generated palette, even when the environment exhibits limited color variation.
*   **User Interface (Optional):** Mobile app or desktop software to:
    *   Visualize generated palettes.
    *   Adjust mood settings.
    *   Customize weighting factors.
    *   Save and share palettes.
*   **Popularity Data Integration:** Integrates with the color name popularity data source described in the patent, to assign color names to the generated palettes.

**Pseudocode (Palette Generation Engine):**

```pseudocode
function generate_palette(sensor_data, mood, popularity_data):
  // Extract environmental data
  ambient_colors = extract_dominant_colors(sensor_data)
  light_level = get_light_level(sensor_data)

  // Apply mood weighting
  mood_weights = get_mood_weights(mood, light_level)

  // Generate initial palette candidates (as in patent 9514543)
  palette_candidates = generate_palette_candidates(sensor_data, mood_weights)

  // Filter and refine candidates
  refined_palette = filter_palette(palette_candidates)

  // Assign color names
  color_names = assign_color_names(refined_palette, popularity_data)

  return refined_palette, color_names
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The sensor array collects environmental data.
2.  The data is processed and analyzed to determine dominant colors, light levels, and other relevant parameters.
3.  The user (or the system automatically) selects a mood setting.
4.  The palette generation engine generates a color palette based on the sensor data, mood setting, and popularity data.
5.  The generated palette and corresponding color names are displayed to the user (optional).
6.  The user can save, share, or apply the palette to their digital assets.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Digital Art & Design:**  Generate palettes that complement the surrounding environment.
*   **Interior Design:**  Suggest color schemes based on the existing lighting and décor.
*   **Wearable Technology:**  Dynamically adjust the colors of clothing or accessories.
*   **User Interface Design:**  Create UIs that adapt to the user’s environment.
*   **Accessibility:** Generate color palettes optimized for users with visual impairments, based on environmental conditions.
