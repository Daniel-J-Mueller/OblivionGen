## Adaptive Entropy Sharding for Dynamic OTP Lifecycles

**Concept:** Expand on the time-based OTP validity window by introducing dynamically adjusting ‘entropy shards’. Instead of a fixed duration, OTP validity is governed by a collection of randomly generated, time-sensitive ‘shards’ of entropy. The user device possesses a key to combine these shards and verify validity. This approach enables finer-grained control over access and dramatically reduces the window of opportunity for replay attacks.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shard Generation:**
    *   The server (OTP provider) generates a set of *N* entropy shards for each OTP. Each shard comprises a random bitstring (e.g., 128 bits) and a corresponding validity timestamp range (start/end). The timestamp ranges *overlap* and are short (e.g., 5-15 seconds each).
    *   Shard generation utilizes a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) seeded with a unique session key.
    *   Shards are signed with the server’s private key to prevent tampering.

2.  **OTP Packaging & Delivery:**
    *   The OTP isn’t transmitted directly. Instead, the server transmits:
        *   An OTP identifier.
        *   The signed entropy shard list (N shards, each with data, timestamp range, and signature).
        *   A public key component for a threshold decryption scheme.

3.  **Client-Side Validation:**
    *   The client device stores a secret key component and the public key.
    *   Upon receiving an authentication request, the client:
        *   Retrieves the entropy shard list associated with the OTP identifier.
        *   Filters the shard list to identify shards *currently valid* based on the client’s real-time clock.
        *   Combines the valid shards using a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) and the secret key.  The combination forms a verification token.
        *   Transmits the verification token to the authentication server.

4.  **Server-Side Authentication:**
    *   The authentication server receives the verification token and the OTP identifier.
    *   The server reconstructs the expected verification token using the same shard list, timestamp filtering, hash function, and the *server’s* secret key (derived from the public key component provided to the client).
    *   If the reconstructed token matches the received token, authentication is successful.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Validation):**

```
function validateOTP(otpIdentifier, currentTimestamp):
  shardList = getShards(otpIdentifier)
  validShards = []
  for shard in shardList:
    if shard.startTime <= currentTimestamp <= shard.endTime and verifySignature(shard):
      validShards.append(shard.data)

  if len(validShards) == 0:
    return false // OTP expired or invalid

  verificationToken = hash(concatenate(validShards), secretKey)
  return verificationToken
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Shard Revocation:** A mechanism for instantly revoking compromised shards (e.g., via a revocation list transmitted to clients).
*   **Dynamic Shard Count:** Vary the number of shards (N) based on risk profile. Higher-risk applications would employ a larger N for increased security.
*   **Bloom Filter Optimization:** Use a bloom filter to represent the shard list, reducing storage and transmission overhead.
*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** Utilize an HSM to protect the server’s private key and perform cryptographic operations.
*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Employ threshold cryptography for the server's secret key, distributing key management among multiple servers.
