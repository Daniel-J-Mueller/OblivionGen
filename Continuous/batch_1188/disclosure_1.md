## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Projection

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *selecting* an ASR model based on a noise parameter. Instead, reconstruct the acoustic environment itself based on received noise parameters, then *project* an idealized, noise-reduced audio signal into that reconstructed space *before* ASR processing.

**Specs:**

**I. System Architecture Additions:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Database:** A large, pre-computed database of acoustic environments. Each entry contains:
    *   Impulse Responses (IRs) for various locations within the scene.
    *   Associated noise profiles (statistical distributions of noise characteristics).
    *   Metadata describing the scene type (e.g., “busy street,” “quiet office,” “train station”).
*   **Scene Reconstruction Module (Server-Side):**
    *   Input: Noise parameter vector (from user device).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Scene Matching:** Compare the received noise parameter vector to entries in the Acoustic Scene Database. Employ a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) to identify the most probable acoustic scene.
        2.  **IR Selection:** Based on the matched scene, select a representative set of Impulse Responses. Multiple IRs representing different locations within the scene should be considered.
        3.  **Acoustic Scene Rendering:**  Convolve the received noise-reduced audio signal with the selected Impulse Responses. This effectively “places” the audio signal within the reconstructed acoustic scene.  Multiple convolved signals, each representing a different location, are generated.
*   **Spatial Audio Processor:**
    *   Input: Multiple convolved audio signals (representing different locations within the reconstructed scene).
    *   Process:  Mix the convolved signals according to a dynamic weighting scheme. This scheme is driven by the original noise parameter vector.  For example, a high signal-to-noise ratio might favor the signal directly, while a low SNR might emphasize the reverberant components.
*   **ASR Frontend:** Receives the spatially processed audio signal and feeds it to the ASR engine.

**II. Noise Parameter Expansion:**

*   **Beyond Vectors:** The noise parameter should not be limited to a simple vector. It should incorporate:
    *   **Directional Noise Information:** Use beamforming data (if available from the user device) to estimate the direction of arrival of noise sources.
    *   **Frequency-Specific Noise Levels:**  Analyze the noise spectrum to identify dominant frequencies.
    *   **Reverberation Time (RT60) Estimation:** Accurately estimate the reverberation time of the environment.
*   **Parameter Encoding:** Encode this expanded parameter set using a lossless compression algorithm for efficient transmission.

**III. Pseudocode (Scene Reconstruction Module):**

```
FUNCTION reconstruct_scene(noise_parameter_vector):

  scene_matches = database_search(noise_parameter_vector) // Returns ranked list of scene matches

  best_scene = scene_matches[0] // Select the top match

  impulse_responses = best_scene.get_impulse_responses()

  convolved_signals = []
  FOR ir IN impulse_responses:
    convolved_signal = convolve(noise_reduced_audio_signal, ir)
    convolved_signals.append(convolved_signal)

  // Dynamic Weighting (based on noise parameters)
  weights = calculate_weights(noise_parameter_vector)

  mixed_signal = sum(weight * signal FOR signal, weight IN zip(convolved_signals, weights))

  RETURN mixed_signal
```

**IV. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved ASR Accuracy:** By modeling the acoustic environment, the ASR engine can better distinguish speech from noise.
*   **Robustness to Noise:** The system is less susceptible to variations in noise levels and characteristics.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:**  A more natural and immersive audio experience.
