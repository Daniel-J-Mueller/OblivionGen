## Acoustic Spatial Mapping & Personalized Sound Zones

**Concept:** Leveraging the microphone array and speaker positioning of the device to create localized sound zones within a space, tailored to individual users. This moves beyond simple voice command response to deliver immersive and personalized audio experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing device housing & components (microphone array, speaker, processor, network interface, computer-readable media).
    *   **Add:** Miniature, high-precision ultrasonic transducers (4-8 units) integrated into the housing, positioned to complement the existing speaker. These will be used for initial spatial mapping.
    *   **Add:** Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - accelerometer and gyroscope - to track device orientation and movement.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Spatial Mapping Module:**
        1.  **Calibration Phase:** Upon initial setup, the device emits ultrasonic pings. The microphone array captures the reflected signals, creating a 3D map of the immediate environment (within ~5 meters).  The IMU data corrects for device orientation during mapping.
        2.  **Dynamic Mapping:** Continuously refine the map using microphone data. Analyze sound reflections and ambient noise to detect changes in the environment (e.g., furniture moved, people entering/leaving the room).
    *   **User Profiling Module:**
        1.  **Voice Recognition & Localization:** Identify individual users by voice and estimate their position relative to the device.
        2.  **Preference Storage:** Store individual audio preferences (EQ settings, volume levels, preferred content sources).
    *   **Beamforming & Sound Zone Control:**
        1.  **Algorithm:** Utilize advanced beamforming techniques (combining signals from the existing speaker *and* ultrasonic transducers) to create focused sound zones.
        2.  **Zone Creation:** Define the shape, size, and position of each sound zone.
        3.  **Zone Control:**  Direct audio content (music, podcasts, notifications) to specific zones, ensuring that each user hears only the content intended for them.
    *   **Noise Cancellation & Adaptive Filtering:**
        1.  **Ambient Noise Analysis:**  Continuously analyze ambient noise levels and characteristics.
        2.  **Adaptive Filtering:** Apply adaptive filtering algorithms to minimize noise interference within each sound zone.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Update Spatial Map
    UpdateSpatialMap();

    // 2. Detect Users & Their Positions
    userList = DetectUsers();

    // 3. For each User:
    for (user in userList) {
        // a. Load User Preferences
        preferences = LoadPreferences(user);

        // b. Calculate Sound Zone Parameters
        zone = CalculateSoundZone(user.position, preferences);

        // c. Render Audio to Sound Zone
        RenderAudio(zone, user.content);
    }

    // 4. Apply Ambient Noise Cancellation
    ApplyNoiseCancellation();
}
```

**Innovation Focus:**  Personalized audio experiences. Creates "private listening bubbles" within shared spaces.  Applications include: home offices, shared living spaces, public transportation, and collaborative work environments. Allows for simultaneous, non-interfering audio streams for multiple users. Potential to integrate with augmented reality applications, anchoring sound to specific objects or locations within the environment.
