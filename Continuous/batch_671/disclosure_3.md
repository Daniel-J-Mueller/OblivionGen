## Dynamic Content ‘Echo’ System

**Concept:** Extend the item selection history and response recording to create a dynamic ‘echo’ of user preference, not just for content *selection*, but for *content creation*. This system allows users to influence the type of content created *by others* within the system, creating a feedback loop of increasingly personalized content.

**Specs:**

1.  **Content Creation Profiles:** Each user has a ‘Content Creation Profile’ linked to their item selection history. This profile isn’t about what *they* create, but what *others* should create *for them*.
2.  **Content ‘Seed’ Parameters:** Content creation tools (e.g., blurb editors, blog post interfaces) are augmented with ‘Seed Parameters’ derived from the user’s Content Creation Profile. These parameters define stylistic and thematic boundaries. Examples:
    *   **Sentiment Bias:** (Positive/Negative/Neutral) – Influences the emotional tone of generated content.
    *   **Complexity Level:** (Simple/Moderate/Complex) – Dictates vocabulary and sentence structure.
    *   **Thematic Focus:** (List of keywords/categories derived from item selection history) – Guides content topic selection.
    *   **Narrative Style:** (e.g. ‘Humorous’, ‘Informative’, ‘Dramatic’) - Guides writing style choices.
3.  **‘Echo’ Strength Parameter:**  A user-adjustable parameter controlling the degree to which Seed Parameters influence content generation. A high ‘Echo Strength’ results in highly personalized content; a low strength yields more generic content.
4.  **Content Creation Assistance Tools:**
    *   **Seed-Guided Outlines:** When a user begins to create content, the system generates potential outlines aligned with the Seed Parameters.
    *   **Seed-Aware Suggestion Engine:**  As the user types, the system provides word and phrase suggestions that adhere to the Seed Parameters.
    *   **Style & Tone Check:** A real-time analysis tool flags content that deviates significantly from the Seed Parameters.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** User interactions with generated content (likes, dislikes, shares, comments) further refine the Content Creation Profile, improving the accuracy of Seed Parameters.

**Pseudocode (Content Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateContent(UserID, ContentType, SeedParameters)
    // 1. Fetch User Content Creation Profile
    Profile = FetchContentCreationProfile(UserID)

    // 2. Blend Profile & Seed Parameters
    CombinedParams = Blend(Profile, SeedParameters)

    // 3. Content Generation Engine (e.g., AI model)
    Content = Generate(ContentType, CombinedParams)

    RETURN Content
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION Blend(UserProfile, SeedParams)
    // Adjust SeedParams based on UserProfile weights
    AdjustedParams = {
        SentimentBias:  UserProfile.SentimentBiasWeight * SeedParams.SentimentBias,
        ComplexityLevel: UserProfile.ComplexityWeight * SeedParams.ComplexityLevel,
        ThematicFocus: Combine(UserProfile.ThematicFocus, SeedParams.ThematicFocus), //Merge keyword lists
    }
    RETURN AdjustedParams
END FUNCTION
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Requires an underlying content generation engine (AI models, procedural generation).
*   Content Creation Profiles should be dynamically updated based on user behavior.
*   Privacy considerations – users should be able to control the level of personalization.
*   System designed for a high degree of scalability to manage a large number of user profiles and generated content.
