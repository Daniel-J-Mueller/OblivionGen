## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the visual stabilization technology by integrating localized haptic feedback to create a more immersive and convincing illusion of stability. Instead of *only* visually counteracting movement, the device will subtly vibrate in opposition to detected motion, simulating a stabilized viewing experience felt by the user.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Utilize existing sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, camera) plus *addition* of micro-actuators distributed across the device’s surface (screen bezel, back panel, or dedicated grip areas).
*   **Actuator Type:** Piezoelectric actuators preferred – provide precise, rapid, and energy-efficient localized vibration. Minimum 100 actuators per ~10” display area.
*   **Mapping Algorithm:** A custom algorithm will map sensor data to specific actuator activation patterns. This is *not* a 1:1 counteraction. A ‘feel dampening’ curve is necessary - direct opposition is jarring. The curve prioritizes minimizing *perceived* movement.
*   **Gain Control Integration:** Existing “gain controller” in the patent expands to include “Haptic Gain”. User can adjust the intensity of the haptic feedback alongside the visual stabilization. Presets for “Strong”, “Medium”, “Weak”, “Off”.
*   **Directional Actuation:** Each actuator capable of independent frequency and amplitude control.  Algorithm to determine *direction* of haptic force based on motion vector. Example:  If display is tilting right, actuators on the left edge subtly increase vibration.
*   **Surface Material:** Device surface utilizes materials with high dampening properties to enhance the perception of localized vibration.  Micro-texture provides tactile feedback.
*   **Power Management:** Algorithm must optimize actuator activation to minimize power consumption. Prioritize visual stabilization; haptic feedback secondary.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

while(true){
    // 1. Read Sensor Data
    accelerationX, accelerationY, accelerationZ = readAccelerometer()
    rotationX, rotationY, rotationZ = readGyroscope()
    proximityData = readProximitySensor()
    cameraData = readCamera()

    // 2. Calculate Motion Vector
    motionVector = calculateMotionVector(accelerationX, accelerationY, accelerationZ, rotationX, rotationY, rotationZ, proximityData, cameraData)

    // 3. Calculate Content Shift (existing from patent)
    contentShiftX, contentShiftY = calculateContentShift(motionVector)

    // 4. Calculate Haptic Feedback Pattern
    hapticPattern = calculateHapticPattern(motionVector, userHapticGain)

    // 5. Activate Actuators
    activateActuators(hapticPattern)

    // 6. Shift Content (existing from patent)
    shiftContent(contentShiftX, contentShiftY)

    // 7. Display Content (existing from patent)
}

// Function: calculateHapticPattern
function calculateHapticPattern(motionVector, userHapticGain) {
    // Apply dampening curve to motion vector components
    dampenedMotionX = motionVector.x * dampeningFactor
    dampenedMotionY = motionVector.y * dampeningFactor

    // Scale by user haptic gain
    hapticX = dampenedMotionX * userHapticGain
    hapticY = dampenedMotionY * userHapticGain

    // Map haptic values to actuator activation patterns
    // (Algorithm to determine which actuators to activate based on hapticX and hapticY)
    // Example: Activate actuators near the edge of the screen corresponding to the direction of motion
    actuatorPattern = generateActuatorPattern(hapticX, hapticY)

    return actuatorPattern
}
```

**Refinement:** Algorithm could incorporate user’s physiological data (heart rate, skin conductance) to dynamically adjust haptic feedback. Increased haptic intensity during periods of higher stress/motion sickness.
