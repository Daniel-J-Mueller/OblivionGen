## Dynamic Environmental Mapping for QoS

**Concept:** Extend the user-focused QoS by incorporating real-time environmental data to proactively optimize network performance, going beyond just *who* is using a device to *where* they are and *what* they are doing in that location.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Sensor Array:** A distributed network of sensors within the environment (home, office, etc.). This includes:
    *   **Low-Resolution Cameras:** For basic occupancy detection and movement tracking. (Not for facial recognition, purely for contextual awareness)
    *   **Microphone Array:** For sound event detection (speech, music, TV, etc.) to infer activity.
    *   **Environmental Sensors:** Temperature, humidity, light levels, and potentially air quality sensors.
    *   **Bluetooth/UWB Beacons:** For precise location tracking of devices and users within the environment.
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** A local processing unit (e.g., a dedicated router module or smart hub) to handle sensor data processing and initial analysis.
*   **Router Integration:** Software integration within the router to receive processed environmental data and adjust QoS settings.

**2. Software/Algorithms:**

*   **Environmental Mapping Engine:**
    *   **Sensor Fusion:** Combine data from multiple sensors to create a real-time “activity map” of the environment.
    *   **Activity Inference:** Use machine learning to infer user activities based on sensor data (e.g., "watching movie", "video conference", "listening to music", "gaming", "idle").
    *   **Zone Definition:**  Allow users to define "zones" within the environment (e.g., "living room", "home office", "bedroom") to apply specific QoS profiles.  Automatic zone detection based on sensor data is also required.
*   **Dynamic QoS Adjustment:**
    *   **Activity-Based QoS Profiles:**  Pre-defined QoS profiles associated with different activities (e.g., "high bandwidth, low latency" for gaming, "high bandwidth" for streaming, "low bandwidth" for email).
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Adjust QoS settings based on the user’s activity *and* their location within the environment. For example, prioritize video streaming in the living room, but prioritize VoIP in the home office.
    *   **Predictive QoS:** Use historical data to anticipate user needs.  If the user typically starts a video conference at 9 am in the home office, proactively adjust QoS settings before the conference begins.

**3.  Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop (runs on Edge Computing Unit)

While (true) {

  // Gather Sensor Data
  sensorData = getSensorData()

  // Process Sensor Data
  activityMap = processSensorData(sensorData) // Infers user activity and location

  // Get User Identity
  userId = identifyUser()

  // Get QoS Profile
  qosProfile = getQosProfile(userId, activityMap)

  // Send QoS Profile to Router
  sendQosProfileToRouter(qosProfile)

  // Wait for next iteration
  sleep(100ms)
}

// Function: getQosProfile(userId, activityMap)
// Returns a QoS profile based on user identity and activity map

if (activityMap.activity == "video conference" && activityMap.location == "home office") {
  return {bandwidth: "high", latency: "low", priority: "high"}
} else if (activityMap.activity == "streaming" && activityMap.location == "living room") {
  return {bandwidth: "high", latency: "medium", priority: "medium"}
} else {
  return {bandwidth: "default", latency: "default", priority: "low"}
}
```

**4. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** Implement robust privacy controls to allow users to opt-out of data collection or anonymize their data.
*   **Security:** Secure the sensor network and edge computing unit to prevent unauthorized access.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to support a large number of sensors and users.
*   **User Interface:** Provide a user-friendly interface for configuring zones, setting preferences, and monitoring system performance.
