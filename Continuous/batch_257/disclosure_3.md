## Adaptive Document Reconstruction for Cognitive Load

**Concept:** Leverage eye-tracking data not just to identify problematic sections of a document, but to *dynamically reconstruct* the document presentation in real-time to minimize cognitive load. This goes beyond simple formatting adjustments; it actively rewrites the presentation based on anticipated comprehension difficulties.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Raw eye-tracking data (gaze direction, pupil dilation, saccade frequency), digitized document (text, images, formatting), user profile (reading speed, vocabulary level, prior knowledge - optional), cognitive load model (see below).
*   **Cognitive Load Model:** A trainable AI model (e.g., recurrent neural network) that predicts cognitive load based on eye-tracking features *and* text features (sentence complexity, keyword density, abstractness). The model is initialized with established cognitive load metrics (e.g., NASA-TLX) and refined through user data.
*   **Real-time Analysis Engine:**
    1.  Receive eye-tracking and document data.
    2.  Feed data into the Cognitive Load Model to predict upcoming cognitive load.
    3.  If predicted load exceeds a threshold:
        *   Initiate Document Reconstruction Module.
*   **Document Reconstruction Module:** Executes one or more of the following transformations:
    *   **Sentence Splitting:** Break long, complex sentences into shorter, simpler ones.
    *   **Definition Injection:** Automatically insert definitions of complex terms inline or in a pop-up tooltip. Definitions sourced from a knowledge base (WordNet, Wikipedia, etc.).
    *   **Example Insertion:** Add illustrative examples to clarify abstract concepts. Examples sourced from a pre-built database or generated using large language models.
    *   **Image Generation/Selection:** Automatically insert relevant images to visualize concepts (using DALL-E, Stable Diffusion, or a curated image library).
    *   **Highlighting/Summarization:** Highlight key phrases or generate concise summaries of paragraphs.
    *   **Structural Reorganization:** Dynamically reorder paragraphs or sections to improve flow and coherence. (Experimental - requires advanced natural language understanding).
*   **Output:**  Dynamically reconstructed document presented on the display. The system tracks user engagement and adapts the reconstruction strategy in real-time.
*   **Hardware:** Eye-tracking sensor (front-facing camera preferred), powerful processor (for real-time analysis and reconstruction), high-resolution display.

**Pseudocode (Document Reconstruction Module):**

```
function reconstruct_document(text, predicted_cognitive_load) {
  if (predicted_cognitive_load > threshold) {
    // 1. Sentence Splitting
    sentences = split_into_sentences(text);
    for each sentence in sentences {
      if (sentence_complexity(sentence) > complexity_threshold) {
        sentence = split_complex_sentence(sentence); // Function to break down sentence
      }
    }

    // 2. Definition Injection
    keywords = extract_keywords(text);
    for each keyword in keywords {
      if (keyword_complexity(keyword) > complexity_threshold) {
        text = inject_definition(text, keyword);
      }
    }

    // 3. Example Insertion (optional, requires LLM integration)
    if (contains_abstract_concepts(text)) {
        examples = generate_examples(abstract_concepts, LLM); //Use LLM
        text = insert_examples(text, examples);
    }

    return text;
  } else {
    return text; //No reconstruction needed
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  Existing eye-tracking systems primarily focus on *identifying* problem areas. This system actively *rewrites* the document to prevent cognitive overload, creating a truly adaptive reading experience. It's a move from passive monitoring to proactive intervention. It leverages LLMs and image generation to personalize documents on the fly.
