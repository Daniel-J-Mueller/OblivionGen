**Temporal Network Resilience Mapping & Predictive Shunting**

**Concept:** Expand the cluster tracking to not just *identify* incidents traversing the network, but to *predict* potential network failures based on cluster behavior and dynamically reroute traffic *before* disruption. This moves beyond incident tracking to proactive resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network telemetry (packet loss, latency, bandwidth utilization, device status), alert data (as in the base patent), historical network topology maps.
*   **Preprocessing:** Normalize telemetry data.  Map telemetry to nodes/edges in the network graph.  Augment graph with ‘health’ metrics (derived from telemetry) assigned to nodes and edges.

**2. Cluster Evolution & ‘Resilience Score’ Calculation:**

*   **Baseline Clustering:** Utilize the existing clustering algorithm to identify active clusters representing potential incidents or areas of high stress.
*   **Temporal Analysis:** Track cluster size, velocity (how quickly nodes join/leave), and ‘drift’ (change in geographic location of cluster nodes over time – crucial for predicting spread).
*   **Resilience Score:**  For each cluster, calculate a ‘Resilience Score’ based on:
    *   **Redundancy:** Number of alternate paths available *within* the cluster.  High redundancy = high score.
    *   **Criticality:**  Number of critical services hosted by nodes *within* the cluster. High criticality = low score.
    *   **Velocity & Drift:**  Rapidly expanding/drifting clusters receive a lower score.
    *   **Historical Failure Rate:**  Areas with a history of failures receive a lower score.

**3. Predictive Shunting Engine:**

*   **Thresholding:** Define Resilience Score thresholds. Clusters falling below a threshold are flagged as ‘at-risk’.
*   **Path Calculation:**  For at-risk clusters, calculate alternate paths for traffic flowing *through* the cluster. Prioritize paths that:
    *   Maximize bandwidth.
    *   Minimize latency.
    *   Avoid other at-risk clusters.
*   **Dynamic Rerouting:**  Implement a dynamic rerouting mechanism (e.g., using Software-Defined Networking - SDN) to proactively shift traffic to the calculated alternate paths *before* a failure occurs.
*   **'Shadow' Traffic Testing:**  Periodically route a small percentage of 'shadow' traffic through alternate paths to validate their performance and ensure seamless failover.

**4.  Feedback & Learning:**

*   **Failure Validation:**  If a failure *does* occur despite rerouting, log the event and analyze the root cause.
*   **Model Refinement:**  Use the failure data to refine the Resilience Score calculation and path calculation algorithms.
*   **Predictive Accuracy Tracking:**  Monitor the accuracy of the predictive shunting engine over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Acquire Network Data
  networkData = getNetworkTelemetry() + getAlerts()

  // 2. Cluster Nodes
  clusters = runClusteringAlgorithm(networkData)

  // 3. Calculate Resilience Scores
  for each cluster in clusters {
    resilienceScore = calculateResilienceScore(cluster)
  }

  // 4. Identify At-Risk Clusters
  atRiskClusters = filterClusters(clusters, resilienceScore < threshold)

  // 5. For each at-risk cluster:
  for each cluster in atRiskClusters {
    // 6. Calculate alternate paths
    alternatePaths = calculateAlternatePaths(cluster)

    // 7. Reroute traffic
    rerouteTraffic(cluster, alternatePaths)
  }

  // 8. Log events and refine model
  logEvents()
  refineModel()

  // 9. Wait for next iteration
  sleep(interval)
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-performance servers for real-time data processing.
*   SDN controller for dynamic traffic rerouting.
*   Machine learning framework for model refinement.
*   Network monitoring tools for data acquisition.
