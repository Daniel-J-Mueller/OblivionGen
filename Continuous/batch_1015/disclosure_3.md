**Adaptive Clock Gating with Predictive Filtering**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a dynamic clock gating system that *predicts* interference based on RF activity *before* it impacts the camera clock. This system will move beyond reactive drive strength adjustments to *proactive* clock suppression and redirection.

**II. System Components:**

*   **RF Environment Sensor:** A dedicated low-power RF sensor (integrated or external) to constantly monitor the electromagnetic spectrum in proximity to the device. This sensor will focus on identifying frequency bands used by the RF transmitter/receiver and predicting potential interference based on signal strength and modulation.
*   **Predictive Interference Engine:** A dedicated processor (DSP or FPGA core) that runs a predictive algorithm. This algorithm will analyze the RF environment data and *predict* the timing and intensity of potential interference signals that may affect the camera clock.  The algorithm will consider not just current RF activity, but also historical patterns and device usage.
*   **Clock Gating Network:** A hierarchical clock gating network implemented within the Application Processor. This network allows for granular control over the camera clock signals.  It's more than just on/off; it allows for frequency scaling and phase shifting.
*   **Dynamic Filter Array:** An array of digitally controlled filters (LC or switched capacitor) integrated into the clock path. Each filter can be independently tuned to suppress specific frequencies. These filters will be tuned *proactively* based on the predictions from the Interference Engine.
*   **Clock Redirection Module:** A module that can dynamically redirect the camera clock signal to a secondary, shielded clock path in the event of extreme interference. This provides a "safe mode" for critical imaging operations.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **RF Monitoring:** The RF Environment Sensor continuously monitors the RF spectrum.
2.  **Interference Prediction:** The Predictive Interference Engine analyzes the RF data and generates interference predictions. This includes frequency, amplitude, and timing.
3.  **Dynamic Filter Tuning:** Based on the predictions, the Dynamic Filter Array is tuned to suppress the predicted interference frequencies *before* they impact the camera clock. The prediction algorithm will attempt to suppress these frequencies prior to their occurrence.
4.  **Clock Gating Adjustment:** Simultaneously, the Clock Gating Network adjusts the camera clock frequency and duty cycle to minimize the impact of any remaining interference.
5.  **Redirection (If Necessary):** If the predicted interference is severe, the Clock Redirection Module switches the camera clock to the shielded path.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** The system continuously monitors the camera clock signal for interference and adjusts the filters and clock gating accordingly, refining the prediction model over time.

**IV. Pseudocode (Predictive Interference Engine):**
