## Dynamic Loyalty Tiering via Proximity & Predicted Spend

**Concept:** Extend the check-in system beyond simple transaction enablement to create a dynamic loyalty program based on real-time proximity, predicted spending, and immediate reward triggers.

**Specs:**

*   **Proximity Fencing:** Define multiple concentric proximity fences around each merchant location (e.g., 50ft, 100ft, 200ft, 500ft).
*   **Predicted Spend Model:** Leverage historical transaction data and user profiles to predict likely spend amount *before* the user enters the merchant location.  Factors include: time of day, day of week, past purchases at that category of merchant, and current promotional offers.
*   **Dynamic Tier Assignment:** Based on proximity *and* predicted spend, assign the user to a temporary loyalty tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum) valid for that specific visit. Tier assignment happens *before* the user makes a purchase.
*   **Immediate Reward Triggers:**  Each tier unlocks an immediate reward â€“ not a points accrual, but a *direct* benefit. Examples:
    *   **Bronze:**  "Welcome! Enjoy a free sample with any purchase."
    *   **Silver:** "Show this message to your server for 10% off your total."
    *   **Gold:** "Complimentary appetizer with your entree."
    *   **Platinum:** "Exclusive access to a premium service/item."
*   **Check-in Integration:** The check-in event triggers the tier assignment and reward notification. The cloud wallet system communicates the tier and reward to the merchant's POS system or a merchant-facing app.
*   **API Enhancements:**  Expand the existing API to support:
    *   Transmission of predicted spend data.
    *   Tier assignment requests.
    *   Reward confirmation (merchant reports reward delivered).
*   **User Interface:**  A dedicated section within the user's wallet app to display their current tier for the visit, the associated reward, and a timer indicating the reward's expiration (e.g., 30 minutes).

**Pseudocode (Cloud Wallet System):**

```
function handleUserCheckIn(userID, merchantID) {
  predictedSpend = calculatePredictedSpend(userID, merchantID);
  tier = assignTier(predictedSpend);
  reward = getRewardForTier(tier);

  sendNotificationToUser(userID, "You've entered " + merchantName + "! You are a " + tier + " member and qualify for " + reward);

  sendTierAndRewardToMerchant(merchantID, userID, tier, reward);
}

function calculatePredictedSpend(userID, merchantID) {
  // Access historical data, user profile, time of day, day of week, etc.
  // Apply machine learning model to predict spend amount.
  return predictedAmount;
}

function assignTier(predictedAmount) {
  if (predictedAmount > 50) {
    return "Platinum";
  } else if (predictedAmount > 25) {
    return "Gold";
  } else if (predictedAmount > 10) {
    return "Silver";
  } else {
    return "Bronze";
  }
}

function getRewardForTier(tier) {
  // Retrieve reward details based on tier.
  return rewardDetails;
}
```

**Innovation:** This expands beyond simple transaction facilitation to create a hyper-personalized, immediate-gratification loyalty experience. It incentivizes check-ins, boosts spending, and creates a sense of exclusivity. The dynamic nature of the tiers adds a gamification element, encouraging users to visit more often and spend more to reach higher tiers.
