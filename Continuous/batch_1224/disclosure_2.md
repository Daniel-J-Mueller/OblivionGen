## Personalized Sensory Query System

**Concept:** Expand beyond telephony to incorporate multi-sensory input and output, creating a dynamically personalized query experience. The core idea stems from the patent's focus on reaching respondents via their preferred communication channel (telephony). We extend this to *all* senses, and adapt the query *content* based on real-time sensory feedback.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensory Input Modules:**
    *   **Audio:** High-fidelity microphone array for nuanced voice analysis (emotion, stress, hesitation).
    *   **Visual:** Integrated camera for facial expression recognition, gaze tracking, and environmental context analysis.
    *   **Haptic:** Wearable haptic device (wristband/glove) to detect subtle physiological responses (skin conductance, heart rate variability).
    *   **Olfactory/Gustatory (Optional):** Miniature scent/taste diffusers for targeted sensory priming (requires careful safety/allergy considerations).
*   **Real-time Sensory Fusion Engine:**
    *   Combines data from all sensory input modules.
    *   Utilizes machine learning models to infer respondent’s emotional state, cognitive load, engagement level, and potential biases.
*   **Dynamic Query Adaptation Module:**
    *   Adjusts query content (wording, complexity, media format) in real-time based on sensory feedback.
        *   If respondent shows signs of confusion, simplify the question.
        *   If respondent seems disengaged, introduce more stimulating visual/auditory elements.
        *   If respondent exhibits negative emotional responses, rephrase the question or offer an option to skip it.
*   **Personalized Sensory Output Module:**
    *   Delivers query content via multiple sensory channels:
        *   Spatialized audio for immersive soundscapes.
        *   Dynamic lighting effects to influence mood and attention.
        *   Haptic feedback to provide subtle cues or confirmations.
        *   Integrated scent/taste profiles to evoke specific memories or associations.
*   **Data Store & Analytics:**
    *   Stores all sensory data, query responses, and adaptation parameters.
    *   Provides analytics dashboards for identifying patterns, optimizing query effectiveness, and improving personalization algorithms.

**Pseudocode – Dynamic Query Adaptation:**

```
function AdaptQuery(sensoryData, currentQuery) {
  emotionalState = AnalyzeEmotion(sensoryData);
  cognitiveLoad = AnalyzeCognitiveLoad(sensoryData);
  engagementLevel = AnalyzeEngagementLevel(sensoryData);

  if (emotionalState == "negative") {
    currentQuery = RephraseQuery(currentQuery, "softerTone");
    //Or skip query
  }

  if (cognitiveLoad == "high") {
    currentQuery = SimplifyQuery(currentQuery);
  }

  if (engagementLevel == "low") {
    currentQuery = AddStimulus(currentQuery, "visualCue");
  }

  return currentQuery;
}
```

**Novelty:**

*   This system transcends the limitations of voice-based interaction by incorporating a full spectrum of sensory input and output.
*   The dynamic query adaptation module enables a level of personalization that goes far beyond simple demographic targeting.
*   The integration of physiological sensors provides objective measures of respondent’s emotional state and cognitive load, enabling more accurate and effective query design.
