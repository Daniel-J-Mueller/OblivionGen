## Adaptive Deletion Granularity

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts the granularity of deletion operations based on access patterns and storage medium characteristics. This expands on the conditional deletion concept by introducing a tiered approach, moving beyond simple object-level cancellation.

**Rationale:** The existing patent focuses on preventing deletion *if* modification occurs. This system introduces the possibility of *partial* deletion or data tiering, allowing for nuanced responses to access patterns *around* a deletion candidate. 

**Components:**

1.  **Access Pattern Analyzer:** Continuously monitors read/write requests associated with keys identified as deletion candidates. Tracks frequency, recency, and type of access (read vs. write).
2.  **Storage Tier Manager:** Defines and manages multiple storage tiers with varying performance/cost characteristics (e.g., SSD, NVMe, HDD, tape).
3.  **Granularity Controller:**  Determines the optimal deletion granularity based on data from the Access Pattern Analyzer and Storage Tier Manager. Granularity levels:
    *   **Full Deletion:** Standard object removal.
    *   **Metadata-Only Deletion:** Remove the object's metadata, but retain the underlying data blocks in a lower-cost storage tier (e.g., archival storage).  Metadata is updated to indicate data is archived.
    *   **Selective Data Deletion:** Identify and delete specific data blocks within the object based on access patterns.  Frequently accessed blocks are retained, infrequently accessed blocks are moved or deleted. This requires the object to be internally structured for granular operations.
    *  **Data Shadowing:** Create a 'shadow' copy of the data before 'deletion,' moving the shadow to a lower tier. The original is deleted but reconstruction is possible.

**Workflow:**

1.  An object is identified as a deletion candidate based on retention policies (as in the original patent).
2.  The Access Pattern Analyzer begins monitoring access to the object.
3.  Based on the access pattern *and* configured storage tier characteristics, the Granularity Controller selects the optimal deletion granularity.
4.  The chosen granularity is executed.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Controller):**

```
function determineDeletionGranularity(objectKey, accessPatternData, storageTierConfig):
    if accessPatternData.frequency < thresholdLow AND accessPatternData.recency > thresholdOld:
        return "Full Deletion"
    elif accessPatternData.frequency < thresholdMedium AND accessPatternData.recency > thresholdMedium:
        if storageTierConfig.archivalTierAvailable:
            return "Metadata-Only Deletion"
        else:
            return "Full Deletion"
    elif storageTierConfig.granularDeletionSupported:
        #Analyze data block access within the object
        blockAccessData = analyzeBlockAccess(objectKey)
        frequentlyAccessedBlocks = filterBlocks(blockAccessData, thresholdFrequent)
        #Retain frequently accessed blocks, delete/archive others
        performSelectiveDeletion(objectKey, frequentlyAccessedBlocks)
        return "Selective Data Deletion"
    else:
        return "Full Deletion"
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `AccessPatternData`: `{frequency: int, recency: timestamp}`
*   `StorageTierConfig`: `{archivalTierAvailable: boolean, granularDeletionSupported: boolean, costPerGB: float}`
*   `BlockAccessData`: `{blockID: int, accessCount: int, lastAccess: timestamp}`

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Granularity:** Utilize machine learning to predict future access patterns and optimize deletion granularity accordingly.
*   **Data Reconstruction:** Implement a data reconstruction mechanism to restore data from archived or selectively deleted blocks.
*   **User-Configurable Granularity:** Allow users to define custom deletion granularity policies based on their specific needs.
