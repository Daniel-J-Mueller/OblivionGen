## Adaptive Directive Prioritization with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the cross-functionality component framework to include a predictive resource allocation system. This system anticipates device resource contention *before* directive dispatch, dynamically adjusting directive prioritization and potentially preempting lower-priority directives to ensure critical functions aren't delayed.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Introduce a "Predictive Resource Manager" (PRM) cross-functionality component.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Current device resource utilization (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, battery level - if applicable).
    *   Historical device usage patterns (learned through machine learning).
    *   Directive queue information (pending directives, estimated execution time, resource requirements).
    *   User-defined priority levels for different actions/skills (e.g., safety-critical actions have the highest priority).
*   **PRM Logic:**
    1.  **Resource Prediction:** Based on historical data and current utilization, predict future resource availability.
    2.  **Contention Analysis:** Identify potential resource contention between pending directives.
    3.  **Priority Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust directive priorities based on predicted contention and user-defined priorities.
    4.  **Preemptive Dispatch:** If contention is unavoidable, preempt lower-priority directives to ensure higher-priority directives are executed promptly.
    5.  **Directive Re-queueing:** Re-queue preempted directives with adjusted scheduling parameters (e.g., reduced resource allocation, delayed execution).
*   **Integration with Existing Framework:**
    *   PRM intercepts directives *before* the third cross-functionality component (the directive dispatcher).
    *   PRM communicates resource predictions and priority adjustments to the directive dispatcher.
    *   The directive dispatcher adjusts the directive queue and dispatch order accordingly.
*   **Pseudocode (PRM Component):**

```
function process_directive(directive):
  resource_prediction = predict_resources(current_state, directive.resource_needs)
  contention = analyze_contention(resource_prediction, pending_directives)

  if contention:
    priority = adjust_priority(directive.priority, contention)
    directive.priority = priority

    if preempt_lower_priority(directive, pending_directives):
      preempted_directives = find_preempted(directive, pending_directives)
      requeue_directives(preempted_directives)

  return directive
```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ResourceProfile`: Stores historical resource usage data.
    *   `DirectivePriority`: Represents a priority level (e.g., critical, high, medium, low).
    *   `ContentionReport`: Stores information about resource contention (affected directives, severity).

*   **Machine Learning Model:** A time series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) can be used to predict future resource utilization. The model can be trained on historical resource usage data.
*   **Implementation Notes:** The system should be designed to minimize latency and overhead. Resource prediction should be performed proactively, before directives are dispatched.  Consider using a distributed architecture to handle a large number of devices and directives.
