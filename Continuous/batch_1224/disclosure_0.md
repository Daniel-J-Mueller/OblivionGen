## Adaptive Frequency Hopping Based on Proximity & Object Material

**Concept:** Extend the transmit power reduction triggered by proximity detection to incorporate frequency hopping, adapting the hopping pattern based not only on *presence* of an object, but also an *estimated material composition* of the object. This aims to minimize interference and maximize signal integrity in complex environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Material Estimation Module:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a short-range Radio Frequency (RF) material sensor alongside existing proximity sensors (e.g., capacitive, infrared). The RF sensor operates at a low power, scanning for dielectric properties.
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   RF sensor data is fed into a Material Classification Algorithm (MCA).
    *   MCA utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, or Neural Network) to classify materials (e.g., human tissue, metal, plastic, wood) based on dielectric constant and loss tangent.
    *   Confidence level is assigned to material classification.
*   **Output:** Material classification (primary) and confidence level (0-100%).

**2. Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) Controller:**

*   **Input:** Proximity detection signal (binary: present/absent), Material Classification, Confidence Level.
*   **AFH Table:** Predefined table linking material classifications and proximity levels to specific frequency hopping patterns.
    *   Patterns prioritize frequencies with minimal attenuation through the detected material.
    *   Example:
        *   Human Tissue (High Confidence) & Close Proximity: Pattern A (frequencies < 1 GHz, avoiding water absorption peaks).
        *   Metal (High Confidence) & Close Proximity: Pattern B (frequencies > 2 GHz, minimizing reflection).
        *   Plastic (High Confidence) & Close Proximity: Pattern C (optimized for plastic transmission).
        *   Unknown Material (Low Confidence): Default Pattern (broadband, lower power).
*   **Logic:**
    1.  If Proximity = Absent, use Standard Hopping Pattern (predefined).
    2.  If Proximity = Present:
        a.  Retrieve Material Classification from Material Estimation Module.
        b.  If Confidence Level > Threshold (e.g., 75%):
            i.  Select corresponding AFH Pattern from AFH Table.
        c.  Else (Low Confidence):
            i.  Select Default AFH Pattern.
*   **Transmit Power Scaling:** AFH Pattern selection should also influence transmit power. Lower attenuation materials may allow for increased power while maintaining acceptable interference levels.

**3. System Integration:**

*   Material Estimation Module, AFH Controller, and RF front-end are integrated within the user device (e.g., smartphone, e-reader).
*   Software updates allow for refining the Machine Learning model in the Material Estimation Module.
*   Energy efficiency considerations â€“ Material Estimation Module operates intermittently or upon initial proximity detection to minimize power consumption.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
AFH_Table = LoadAFHPatterns()
ML_Model = LoadMLModel()

// Main Loop

OnProximityDetected():
    MaterialClassification, Confidence = ML_Model.Predict(SensorData)

    If Confidence > 75%:
        AFH_Pattern = AFH_Table[MaterialClassification]
        SetFrequencyHoppingPattern(AFH_Pattern)
        AdjustTransmitPower(MaterialClassification) // Optimized power scaling
    Else:
        SetFrequencyHoppingPattern(DefaultPattern)
        SetTransmitPower(LowPower)
```
