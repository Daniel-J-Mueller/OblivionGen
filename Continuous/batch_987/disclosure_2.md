## Adaptive Resonance Biofeedback System

**Concept:** Extend the postural/activity monitoring into a closed-loop system that actively shapes the user’s neurological responses via targeted auditory and tactile stimulation, promoting desired states (focus, calm, energy) beyond simple alert/correction. Leverage principles of neuroplasticity and resonance to enhance learning and adaptation.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution IMUs (torso, neck, potentially limbs) - as per existing patent.
    *   EEG Sensors (3-5 dry electrode cap) - Frontal and Parietal lobes.
    *   GSR Sensor - Palmar surface.
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Sensor - Photoplethysmography (PPG).
    *   Ambient Sound Microphone - Captures environmental audio for noise cancellation/augmentation.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded system capable of real-time signal processing and machine learning.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:**
    *   Bone Conduction Headphones – Deliver precisely timed auditory stimuli.
    *   Haptic Actuators – Distributed within the neck band; capable of varied vibration patterns and intensities.
    *   Subtle Thermal Regulation - Peltier elements embedded in the neck band.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Real-time Signal Processing Pipeline:**
        *   IMU data -> Posture/Activity estimation.
        *   EEG data -> Feature extraction (Alpha, Beta, Theta wave power).
        *   GSR & HRV -> Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) state estimation.
        *   Ambient Sound Analysis -> Noise profiling/augmentation.
    *   **Adaptive Resonance Algorithm:**
        *   **State Estimation:** Combine sensor data to derive a current ‘neuro-physiological state’ – a vector representing the user's posture, activity level, emotional arousal, and cognitive state.
        *   **Target State Selection:**  Allow user to select a desired state (e.g., "Focus," "Relax," "Energize").  Each target state is associated with a specific EEG/ANS profile.
        *   **Feedback Modulation:** Generate a complex feedback signal based on the difference between the current state and the target state. This signal controls the bone conduction headphones, haptic actuators, and thermal regulation.
            *   **Auditory Stimuli:** Binaural beats, isochronic tones, or pink noise tailored to specific brainwave frequencies.
            *   **Haptic Patterns:**  Rhythmic vibrations designed to entrain the user’s nervous system.
            *   **Thermal Modulation:** Subtle temperature changes to influence arousal levels.
    *   **Machine Learning Component:**  Employ reinforcement learning to personalize the feedback parameters for each user over time.  The system learns which combinations of stimuli are most effective in guiding the user towards their desired state.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Initialization
define target_states = { "Focus": { EEG_alpha: low, EEG_beta: high }, "Relax": { EEG_alpha: high, EEG_beta: low } }
current_state = read_sensors()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    current_state = read_sensors()
    target_state = user_selected_state

    error = calculate_state_error(current_state, target_state)

    //Feedback modulation
    auditory_signal = generate_auditory_signal(error)
    haptic_signal = generate_haptic_signal(error)
    thermal_signal = generate_thermal_signal(error)

    play_auditory_signal(auditory_signal)
    apply_haptic_signal(haptic_signal)
    apply_thermal_signal(thermal_signal)

    //Reinforcement learning
    reward = user_feedback()
    update_feedback_parameters(reward)
}
```

**Novelty:** This extends simple postural/activity *alerts* to active neuro-modulation, using real-time feedback to *shape* the user’s mental and emotional state. The adaptive resonance algorithm and reinforcement learning component create a personalized and dynamic feedback loop, going beyond static or pre-programmed responses. This transforms the device from a passive monitor to an *active training tool* for cognitive and emotional regulation.
