## Dynamic Partition Sharding Based on Access Entropy

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of partitioning data across storage nodes, but introduce dynamic sharding *within* partitions, driven by real-time access entropy analysis. This aims to optimize for both read/write performance *and* failure isolation beyond what static partitioning allows.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Entropy Analyzer Module (EAM)
*   **Input:** Access logs for each partition (timestamp, node accessed, operation type – read/write, data key).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Entropy Calculation:** EAM calculates Shannon entropy for each data key within a partition over a sliding time window (e.g., 1 hour). Higher entropy indicates more random access patterns. Lower entropy indicates sequential or predictable access.
    2.  **Sharding Decision:**  Based on entropy thresholds (configurable per partition), EAM dynamically determines whether to shard a partition further.
    3.  **Dynamic Shard Creation/Merging:**
        *   **High Entropy:** If a key's entropy exceeds a threshold, EAM triggers the creation of a new micro-shard for that key and associated data, assigned to a different subset of storage nodes than the original partition.  This isolates hot spots and distributes load.
        *   **Low Entropy:** If a key’s entropy falls below a threshold for a sustained period, EAM merges the micro-shard back into the original partition, reducing metadata overhead.
    4. **Metadata Management:** A dedicated Metadata Service stores the mapping between data keys, micro-shards, and assigned storage nodes.  This service *must* be highly available and consistent.
*   **Component:** Adaptive Routing Layer (ARL)
*   **Input:** Access requests (data key).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  ARL consults the Metadata Service to determine the correct micro-shard location for the requested data key.
    2.  Routes the request directly to the appropriate subset of storage nodes for that micro-shard.
*   **Data Consistency:** Employ a Raft-based consensus algorithm for micro-shard creation/merging and metadata updates to ensure consistency across the Metadata Service and storage nodes.
*   **Failure Handling:**  If a node fails, the ARL automatically reroutes requests to replicas of the affected micro-shard, leveraging the existing partitioning scheme.

**Pseudocode (ARL):**

```
function routeRequest(request):
  key = request.dataKey
  shardInfo = MetadataService.getShardInfo(key)
  if shardInfo == null:
    // Key not found – handle error/default routing
    return error("Key not found")
  
  subsetOfNodes = shardInfo.nodes
  
  // Select a node from the subset (e.g., round-robin, least load)
  selectedNode = selectNode(subsetOfNodes)
  
  // Forward request to selected node
  forwardRequest(request, selectedNode)
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Metadata Service must be horizontally scalable (e.g., sharded, replicated).
*   EAM should be distributed and operate asynchronously to avoid impacting request latency.
*   Micro-shard size should be configurable to balance overhead and performance.
