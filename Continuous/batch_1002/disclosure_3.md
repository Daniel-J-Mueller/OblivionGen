## Adaptive Kernel Anisotropic Pooling for Multi-Scale Contextual Embedding

**Concept:** Extend anisotropic pooling to dynamically adjust kernel sizes *during* the iterative encoding loop, based on feature activation maps. This facilitates capturing contextual information at multiple scales within the biological sequence without fixed-size limitations.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Dynamic Kernel Size Determination:**
    *   Introduce a “Scale Prediction Network” (SPN). This is a small CNN (e.g., 3 convolutional layers with ReLU activation) that takes an activation map from a layer of the ML model (specifically, the output of a convolutional layer *before* anisotropic pooling) as input.
    *   The SPN outputs a scale factor (e.g., a floating-point number between 0.5 and 2.0). This factor is applied to the base kernel size of the anisotropic pooling layer.
    *   A clamping function restricts the scaled kernel size to a defined range to prevent instability.

2.  **Iterative Encoding Loop Integration:**
    *   Within each iteration of the iterative encoding loop:
        *   A convolutional layer generates multi-dimensional data.
        *   The output of the convolutional layer is fed into the SPN.
        *   The SPN outputs a scale factor.
        *   The anisotropic pooling layer uses the scaled kernel size based on the scale factor.
        *   The output of the anisotropic pooling layer is fed back into the convolutional layer for the next iteration.

3.  **Anisotropic Scaling:**
    *   The scale factor is applied *differently* to the height and length dimensions of the anisotropic pooling kernel. This allows for finer-grained control over contextual information capture.
    *   Define separate scaling parameters (e.g., `scale_height`, `scale_length`) that modulate the height and length dimensions independently. The SPN could output two values for these parameters.

4.  **Implementation Details:**

    ```pseudocode
    # Inside Iterative Encoding Loop
    function iterative_encoding(convolutional_output):
      # 1. Scale Prediction
      scale_factor = SPN(convolutional_output)
      
      # 2. Anisotropic Kernel Size Calculation
      kernel_height = base_kernel_height * scale_factor
      kernel_length = base_kernel_length * scale_factor
      
      # 3. Anisotropic Pooling
      contextual_embedding = anisotropic_pooling(convolutional_output, kernel_height, kernel_length)
      
      return contextual_embedding
    ```

5.  **Training Considerations:**
    *   Train the SPN jointly with the main ML model.
    *   Use a loss function that encourages the SPN to generate scale factors that maximize the accuracy of downstream tasks (e.g., vaccine production).
    *   Regularization techniques (e.g., L1 or L2 regularization) can be used to prevent the SPN from overfitting.

6.  **Hardware Acceleration:** Implement the SPN using a dedicated hardware accelerator (e.g., an FPGA or ASIC) to speed up the scaling prediction process.

7.  **Biological Sequence Padding:** Implement padding strategies to handle variable-length sequences and ensure uniform input sizes for the SPN. This could involve zero-padding or sequence truncation.
