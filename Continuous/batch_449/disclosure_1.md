## Dynamic Key Sharding with Biometric Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the "heartbeat" mechanism to dynamically shard encryption keys and distribute portions to multiple HSMs, requiring biometric attestation from authorized users *before* key reconstruction and cryptographic operations are permitted. This introduces a layer of physical security and prevents single-HSM compromise from fully exposing sensitive data.

**Specifications:**

*   **Key Shard Generation:** The primary HSM (or a designated key management service) will split a master encryption key into *n* shards using a secure multi-party computation (MPC) scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).
*   **Shard Distribution:** These shards are distributed to geographically diverse HSMs. No single HSM possesses the complete key.
*   **Biometric Attestation Protocol:**
    *   Authorized users are registered with the system, linking their biometric data (fingerprint, iris scan, voiceprint) to their access privileges.
    *   Before a cryptographic operation is initiated, the requesting user must provide biometric authentication.
    *   A designated “Attestation Service” verifies the biometric data against registered profiles. Successful authentication triggers a “request for key reconstruction” message.
*   **Key Reconstruction Orchestration:**
    *   The Attestation Service coordinates with the HSMs holding the key shards.
    *   Each HSM performs a local challenge based on a pre-shared secret and the request for reconstruction. Successful challenge verification confirms the HSM's integrity.
    *   The HSMs each contribute their shard to a secure aggregation process (managed by the Attestation Service) to reconstruct the full key.
    *   The reconstructed key is held in a transient, secure enclave *only* for the duration of the cryptographic operation.
*   **Heartbeat Integration:**  Each HSM holding a key shard must maintain a valid heartbeat signal. Failure of a heartbeat signal triggers automatic key re-sharding and distribution, enhancing resilience against compromise.
*   **Access Control:**  The Attestation Service enforces access control policies based on user identity, role, and the specific data being accessed.
*   **Dynamic Re-sharding:** The system periodically re-shards the encryption key and redistributes the shards to different HSMs, further complicating potential attacks.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
// Attestation Service

function reconstructKey(userID, dataID):
  if not verifyBiometrics(userID):
    return ERROR_INVALID_BIOMETRICS

  shardHSMList = getShardHSMList(dataID) // List of HSMs holding shards

  for hsm in shardHSMList:
    challenge = generateChallenge()
    response = hsm.verifyHSM(challenge)
    if not response.isValid():
      return ERROR_HSM_COMPROMISED // One HSM failed verification

  // All HSMs verified; begin key reconstruction
  keyShards = []
  for hsm in shardHSMList:
    keyShards.append(hsm.getKeyShard())

  reconstructedKey = reconstructKeyFromShards(keyShards) // MPC

  // Perform cryptographic operation with reconstructedKey
  operationResult = performOperation(reconstructedKey, dataID)

  return operationResult
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multiple HSMs with secure storage and cryptographic capabilities.
*   Secure communication channels between HSMs and the Attestation Service.
*   Biometric scanners (fingerprint, iris, voice).
*   High-performance computing infrastructure for MPC and key reconstruction.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security against single-HSM compromise.
*   Increased resilience against attacks.
*   Stronger access control and authentication.
*   Reduced risk of data breaches.
