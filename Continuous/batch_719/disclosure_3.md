**Decentralized Session Key Management with Blockchain Anchoring**

**Concept:** Expand upon the short-term credential/session key concept by leveraging a permissioned blockchain to anchor and verify session key validity, enhancing security and auditability beyond centralized validation.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Blockchain Layer:** A permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda) managed by the resource-owning organization.  This acts as the source of truth for valid session key mappings. Nodes are operated by trusted entities within the organization.
*   **Key Registration Service (KRS):** A service responsible for registering session keys with the blockchain.  This is invoked when a session is initiated.
*   **Session Validator (SV):**  A component integrated into resource access points.  It verifies the validity of presented session keys by querying the blockchain.
*   **Credential Issuance Service (CIS):** Handles the initial long-term key exchange and role assignment as in the original patent. It triggers the KRS upon successful role assumption.

**2. Data Structures (Blockchain Ledger):**

*   **Session Key Record:**
    *   `session_key_id` (UUID): Unique identifier for the session key.
    *   `role_identifier`:  The role associated with the session.
    *   `user_account_id`: The user account that initiated the session.
    *   `issue_timestamp`:  Timestamp when the session key was issued.
    *   `expiration_timestamp`: Timestamp when the session key expires.
    *   `revocation_status`: Boolean flag indicating if the session key has been revoked.
    *   `digital_signature`: Signature of the KRS verifying the record's authenticity.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Role Assumption:** User in Region 2 requests to assume a role in Region 1, as per the original patent.
2.  **Session Key Generation:**  CIS generates a session key and associated session token.
3.  **Blockchain Registration:** CIS calls the KRS, providing the session key details. The KRS creates a `Session Key Record` on the blockchain, signs it, and returns a transaction ID to the CIS.
4.  **Token Delivery:** CIS delivers the session token (including the transaction ID) to the user in Region 2.
5.  **Resource Access:** User in Region 2 attempts to access a resource in Region 1, presenting the session token.
6.  **Validation:** The SV at the resource access point:
    *   Extracts the session key and transaction ID from the token.
    *   Queries the blockchain using the transaction ID to retrieve the `Session Key Record`.
    *   Verifies the digital signature on the `Session Key Record` to ensure authenticity.
    *   Checks the `revocation_status` and `expiration_timestamp`.
    *   If all checks pass, grants access.

**4. Revocation Mechanism:**

*   When a session needs to be revoked (e.g., due to compromise), the KRS creates a new `Session Key Record` with the same `session_key_id` but sets `revocation_status` to `true`. This overwrites the previous record on the blockchain.
*   The SV always fetches the latest record, ensuring immediate revocation enforcement.

**5. Pseudocode (Session Validator):**

```
function validateSession(sessionToken):
  sessionKeyId = extractSessionKeyId(sessionToken)
  transactionId = extractTransactionId(sessionToken)

  sessionRecord = blockchain.query(transactionId)

  if sessionRecord == null:
    return ACCESS_DENIED // Transaction not found

  if sessionRecord.revocation_status == true:
    return ACCESS_DENIED // Session revoked

  if sessionRecord.expiration_timestamp < currentTime:
    return ACCESS_DENIED // Session expired

  if verifySignature(sessionRecord, trustedKRSKey) == false:
    return ACCESS_DENIED // Signature invalid

  return ACCESS_GRANTED
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Blockchain immutability prevents tampering with session key records.
*   **Improved Auditability:**  All session key transactions are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent audit trail.
*   **Decentralized Trust:** Reduces reliance on a single centralized authority for session key validation.
*   **Real-time Revocation:** Immediate enforcement of revocation requests.
