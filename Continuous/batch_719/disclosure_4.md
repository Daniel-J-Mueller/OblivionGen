## Dynamic Explainer Composition with Modular Prediction Decomposition

**Concept:** Extend the existing explainability system by decomposing complex model predictions into contributions from individual feature interactions and creating a dynamic “explainer composition” tailored to each observation. This goes beyond identifying rules linked to single features and delves into identifying *how* features collectively drive the prediction.

**Specs:**

1.  **Prediction Decomposition Module:**
    *   Input: Trained classification model, observation record.
    *   Process: Employ Shapley values or similar attribution techniques to decompose the model’s prediction for the observation into contributions from each feature and all possible feature interactions (pairs, triplets, etc.).  A configurable maximum interaction order should be available (e.g., up to 3-way interactions).
    *   Output:  A weighted set of “prediction components,” each representing the contribution of a specific feature or feature interaction to the final prediction.  Each component has a weight representing its contribution magnitude and a sign indicating whether it contributed positively or negatively.

2.  **Component Explainer Library:**
    *   A pre-built library of explainer templates, categorized by the type of prediction component (individual feature, 2-way interaction, 3-way interaction, etc.).
    *   Templates utilize natural language generation (NLG) and/or visual representations (e.g., interaction plots) to express the component’s contribution in a human-understandable way.
    *   Each template is parameterized to allow customization based on the specific feature values and contribution weight.  Example: "Feature A increased the prediction by X%, given that Feature B is at level Y.”

3.  **Dynamic Explainer Composer:**
    *   Input: Decomposition results, Component Explainer Library, Observation Record.
    *   Process:
        *   Rank prediction components by absolute contribution weight.
        *   Select the top N components (configurable parameter).
        *   For each selected component:
            *   Retrieve the appropriate explainer template from the library.
            *   Populate the template with the component’s specific feature values and contribution weight.
        *   Assemble the individual explainer templates into a coherent explanation narrative.  Prioritize components with larger weights.

4.  **Confidence Scoring for Component Explanations:**
    *   Estimate the confidence in each component explanation using techniques like bootstrapping or Monte Carlo simulation. Generate multiple slight variations of the input observation and re-run the decomposition process. Calculate the variance in the component weights to estimate its reliability.  Display confidence scores alongside the explanations.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Explainer Composer):**

```
function composeExplanation(decompositionResults, explainerLibrary, observationRecord, topN):
  rankedComponents = sort(decompositionResults, by absolute weight)
  selectedComponents = rankedComponents[0:topN]
  explanationFragments = []

  for component in selectedComponents:
    componentType = component.type  // e.g., "feature", "interaction"
    template = explainerLibrary.getTemplate(componentType)
    fragment = template.generateExplanation(component, observationRecord)
    fragment.confidence = calculateConfidence(component)
    explanationFragments.append(fragment)

  // Assemble fragments into coherent narrative.  Prioritize higher weights.
  finalExplanation = assembleNarrative(explanationFragments)
  return finalExplanation
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond explaining predictions based on individual features or simple rules. It decomposes predictions into the contributions of feature *interactions*, providing a more nuanced and complete understanding of the model’s behavior. The dynamic composition allows tailoring explanations to each specific observation and highlights the most influential factors. The confidence scoring adds a layer of trustworthiness.
