## Autonomous Device Swarm Acoustic Mapping & Localization

**Concept:** Extend the autonomous motion & beamforming principles to a *swarm* of small, networked devices, creating a dynamic acoustic map of an environment and enabling precise, collaborative localization – far beyond what a single device can achieve.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Hardware:**
    *   Micro-robotic platform (approx. 5cm diameter, wheeled/legged hybrid for varied terrain).
    *   4-6 Micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) microphones arranged in a spherical array.
    *   Miniaturized, low-power speaker.
    *   Onboard processing unit (ARM Cortex-M7 or equivalent).
    *   Short-range wireless communication (UWB or similar).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU).
    *   Power: Small, high-density battery (solid-state preferred).

*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Distributed Beamforming:** Each device performs independent beamforming, as described in the patent, *but* with dynamic beam steering coordinated via swarm communication.
    *   **Acoustic Mapping:** Devices transmit short, broadband “ping” signals. Reflected signals are captured by *all* devices in the swarm. A central (or distributed) processing unit fuses this data to create a 3D acoustic map of the environment – identifying surfaces, obstacles, and potentially even object characteristics based on reflection signatures.
    *   **Localization Algorithm:** Utilizing Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) of the “ping” signals, each device can calculate its precise position relative to *other* devices and fixed landmarks in the acoustic map. This creates a robust, self-correcting localization system.
    *   **Swarm Coordination:** A leader-follower (or decentralized) control algorithm manages swarm movement. The leader can be a designated device or a virtual “centroid” based on the acoustic map.
    *   **Adaptive Noise Cancellation:**  Utilizes null beamforming to suppress noise from external sources and interference from other devices in the swarm.

*   **Pseudocode (Localization):**

```
// Device i:
// 1. Transmit "ping" signal.
// 2. Receive "ping" signals from other devices (j).
// 3. Calculate TDoA between signals from j and k.
// 4. Use TDoA to estimate the distance between device i and j.
// 5. Triangulate position based on distances from multiple devices.
// 6. Fuse triangulated position with IMU data for improved accuracy.
// 7. Share position data with neighboring devices.
// 8. Repeat process periodically.

//Central Processing (optional):
//1. Collect position data from all devices.
//2. Perform global optimization to refine position estimates.
//3. Create and maintain a consistent acoustic map.
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Autonomous exploration and mapping of complex environments (e.g., disaster zones, underground mines).
    *   Precision indoor localization for robotics and augmented reality.
    *   Acoustic surveillance and monitoring.
    *   Collaborative robotics for assembly and manipulation tasks.
    *   Search and Rescue operations.

*   **Novelty:** Extends the single-device beamforming concept to a *swarm*, enabling significantly improved environmental awareness, localization accuracy, and robustness. It moves beyond merely compensating for Doppler effects to actively *building* a detailed acoustic understanding of the surrounding space.
