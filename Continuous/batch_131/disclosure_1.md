## Adaptive Link Profiling with Predictive QoS

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of measuring TCP throughput, not just *between* two devices, but to create a continuously updated, predictive Quality of Service (QoS) profile of *every* hop in the network path. This allows proactive adjustment of traffic prioritization and routing *before* congestion impacts performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Profiling Agent (Software/Firmware â€“ deployable on devices similar to the patent's 'first device'):**

*   **Packet Generation:** Modifies existing packets *in use by applications* (not synthesized packets).  Intercepts outbound TCP packets.
*   **Hop-by-Hop Marking:**  Adds a unique, incrementally increasing "Hop ID" to the IP header's DSCP field (or a similar QoS field).  Each router/AP encountered increments the Hop ID.  Initial Hop ID = 0 at the source.
*   **Round Trip Time (RTT) Tracking:** Logs the timestamp when the packet is sent and when the acknowledgement (ACK) is received.  Calculates precise RTT *per Hop ID*.
*   **Loss Detection:**  Detects packet loss based on ACK timeouts.  Associates loss *with a specific Hop ID*.
*   **Throughput Calculation:** Measures the data rate achieved for packets associated with each Hop ID over a rolling time window.
*   **Adaptive Probing Rate:** Dynamically adjusts the rate at which probing packets are sent based on observed network stability. Higher variability = more frequent probes.
*   **Data Aggregation & Reporting:** Periodically transmits aggregated QoS profiles (RTT, loss, throughput per hop) to a central controller/analytics platform.

**2. Central Controller/Analytics Platform:**

*   **Topology Discovery:** Uses received QoS profiles to automatically discover and map the network topology.  (Hop IDs reveal the path.)
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series forecasting, regression) to predict future network congestion based on historical QoS data.
*   **QoS Policy Generation:**  Automatically generates QoS policies (e.g., traffic shaping, prioritization) to optimize network performance.
*   **Policy Distribution:** Distributes QoS policies to network devices (routers, APs) using standard protocols (e.g., NetConf, RESTCONF).
*   **Real-time Monitoring & Alerting:** Provides real-time monitoring of network performance and generates alerts when congestion is predicted or detected.

**3. Network Device Integration (Routers, APs):**

*   **Hop ID Processing:**  Extracts and logs the Hop ID from incoming packets.
*   **QoS Policy Enforcement:** Enforces QoS policies received from the central controller.
*   **Telemetry Export:**  Exports local network performance metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage) to the central controller.
*   **Active Queue Management (AQM):** Integrates with AQM algorithms to proactively manage queue lengths and reduce congestion.

**Pseudocode (Profiling Agent):**

```
OnOutboundPacket(packet):
  HopID = GetHopIDFromPacket(packet) //If null, start at 0
  timestamp = getCurrentTime()
  recordPacket(packet, HopID, timestamp, "sent")

OnInboundAck(ack):
  HopID = GetHopIDFromAck(ack)
  timestamp = getCurrentTime()
  recordPacket(ack, HopID, timestamp, "received")
  calculateRTT(HopID)
  calculateThroughput(HopID)

GetHopIDFromPacket(packet):
  //Extract from DSCP field or a similar QoS field.

calculateRTT(HopID):
  //Calculate Round Trip Time based on timestamps

calculateThroughput(HopID):
  //Calculate throughput based on packet sizes and time intervals.
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple throughput measurement to create a *dynamic, predictive* model of network performance at a granular, hop-by-hop level. It moves from *reactive* congestion management to *proactive* optimization. The ability to identify specific hops contributing to congestion is a key differentiator.
