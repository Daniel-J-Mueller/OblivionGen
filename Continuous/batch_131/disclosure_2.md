## Adaptive Prediction with Temporal Contextualization

**Concept:** Enhance video decoding efficiency by predicting future NAL unit boundaries *before* receiving the full bitstream, leveraging temporal context from previously decoded frames and a probabilistic model. This goes beyond merely knowing the location of a boundary; it anticipates *where* boundaries are likely to occur.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Context Analyzer:** 
    *   Input: Decoded video frames (past N frames – configurable parameter).
    *   Process: Analyzes motion vectors, inter-frame redundancies, and scene changes within the historical frames.  Creates a "context vector" representing the temporal characteristics of the video sequence. This vector captures the rate of scene changes, the predominant motion patterns, and the overall complexity of the video content.
    *   Output: Context Vector.

2.  **Probabilistic Boundary Model:**
    *   Input: Context Vector, Training Data (pre-calculated statistics from a large corpus of video content – categorized by video type/codec).
    *   Process: Uses the Context Vector to query a pre-trained probabilistic model (e.g., a Bayesian Network, Hidden Markov Model, or Neural Network). This model estimates the probability distribution of NAL unit lengths and the likelihood of boundary locations. The model must be configurable for different video codecs and resolutions.
    *   Output:  Probability Map – representing the likelihood of a boundary occurring at each bit position within the expected fragment size.

3.  **Predictive Boundary Insertion:**
    *   Input: Probability Map, Fragment Size Estimate.
    *   Process: Dynamically inserts "prediction markers" into the fragment size estimate. These markers indicate potential NAL unit boundary locations based on the Probability Map. The density of prediction markers adjusts according to the confidence level of the model.
    *   Output: Augmented Fragment Size Estimate – with prediction markers.

4.  **Early Boundary Verification & Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Received Bitstream, Augmented Fragment Size Estimate.
    *   Process:  As the bitstream is received, the decoder compares the actual boundary locations to the prediction markers.  If a marker is confirmed, the decoder immediately initiates decoding for the next NAL unit. If a marker is incorrect, the decoder adjusts the Probability Map and the remaining prediction markers. A feedback loop continuously refines the model’s accuracy.
    *   Output: Confirmed Boundary Locations, Updated Probability Map.

**Pseudocode (Early Boundary Verification):**

```
function verifyBoundary(receivedBitstream, augmentedFragmentSize, probabilityMap):
  currentBitPosition = 0
  while currentBitPosition < augmentedFragmentSize:
    if predictionMarkerPresent(augmentedFragmentSize, currentBitPosition):
      potentialBoundary = checkBoundary(receivedBitstream, currentBitPosition)
      if potentialBoundary:
        confirmedBoundary = currentBitPosition
        decodeNextNALUnit()
        updateProbabilityMap(probabilityMap, success) // Reinforce the prediction
        currentBitPosition = confirmedBoundary + NALUnitLength
      else:
        updateProbabilityMap(probabilityMap, failure) // Penalize the prediction
        currentBitPosition += 1 // Continue searching
    else:
      currentBitPosition += 1
  return confirmedBoundaryLocations, updatedProbabilityMap
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated processing unit for the Temporal Context Analyzer and Probabilistic Boundary Model.
*   Fast access memory for the Probability Map and augmented Fragment Size Estimate.
*   Configurable pipeline to support variable prediction accuracy and processing overhead.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced decoding latency by anticipating NAL unit boundaries.
*   Improved energy efficiency by minimizing the need to scan the entire bitstream.
*   Increased robustness to network jitter and packet loss.
*   Adaptive decoding based on video content characteristics.
