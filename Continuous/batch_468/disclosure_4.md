## Dynamic Recommendation Environments

**Concept:** Extend personalized application recommendations beyond simple app suggestions to encompass *dynamic environments* tailored to user activity. Instead of just suggesting *what* app to use, suggest *how* to use apps together, or even modify device settings to optimize the user experience *during* specific app usage.

**Specs:**

*   **Environment Definition:**  A "Dynamic Environment" is a configuration consisting of:
    *   A primary application (the app currently in focus).
    *   Secondary application recommendations (apps to launch *in conjunction* with the primary app).
    *   Device setting modifications (volume levels, screen brightness, Do Not Disturb status, Bluetooth connections, NFC triggers, etc.).
    *   Contextual triggers (time of day, location, detected activity – walking, driving, stationary).

*   **Usage Graph Expansion:**  The existing usage associations data set (graph) is extended. New edge types are added:
    *   `co-usage`: Represents frequency of simultaneous or near-simultaneous use of two applications.
    *   `setting-association`: Represents correlation between app usage and specific device settings.  (e.g., "User always turns on Bluetooth when using music app.")
    *   `context-association`: Represents correlation between app usage and contextual triggers. (e.g. "User always opens navigation app when arriving at airport")

*   **Environment Recommendation Engine:**
    *   **Input:**  Current app in use, user usage data, contextual data.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  Identify primary app.
        2.  Traverse the expanded usage graph to find strongly connected nodes (co-used apps).
        3.  Identify relevant device settings and contextual triggers associated with the primary app and co-used apps.
        4.  Rank potential Dynamic Environments based on:
            *   Strength of graph connections (co-usage frequency, setting correlation).
            *   User preference weighting (explicit feedback – “Useful Environment,” “Not Useful”).
            *   Contextual relevance (time of day, location, detected activity).
        5.  Present top-ranked Dynamic Environments to the user as "Suggested Environments" – which would involve launching suggested apps *and* modifying device settings with a single action.

*   **User Interface:**
    *   “Environments” tab in app switcher.
    *   Suggested Environments presented as cards with:
        *   Primary App Icon
        *   List of suggested secondary app icons.
        *   Icon representations of modified settings (e.g., volume level, Bluetooth icon).
        *   "Activate Environment" button.
    *   User ability to:
        *   Create custom Environments.
        *   Provide feedback on suggested Environments.
        *   Disable Environment suggestions entirely.

*   **Pseudocode (Environment Recommendation):**

```
function recommendEnvironment(primaryApp, userUsageData, contextualData):
  environments = []
  coUsedApps = getCoUsedApps(primaryApp, userUsageData)
  settingAssociations = getSettingAssociations(primaryApp, userUsageData)
  contextAssociations = getContextAssociations(primaryApp, contextualData)

  for each app in coUsedApps:
    environment = new Environment(primaryApp)
    environment.addApp(app)

    for each setting in settingAssociations:
      environment.addSetting(setting)

    if contextAssociations is not empty:
      environment.addContext(contextAssociations)

    environment.calculateScore()  //Based on graph strength, user feedback, context
    environments.add(environment)

  environments.sort(by score descending)
  return top 3 environments
```
