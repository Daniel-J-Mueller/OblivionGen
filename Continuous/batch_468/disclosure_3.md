**Variable Aperture Array for Computational Light Field Capture**

**Concept:** Expand the single variable aperture concept to an array of micro-apertures, each individually controllable. This allows for dense sampling of the light field *during* a single capture, eliminating the need for mechanical scanning or multiple sensors. The captured data can then be used for advanced computational photography techniques, including refocusing, viewpoint shifting, and enhanced depth estimation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Array:** 64x64 array of micro-lenses positioned above a monolithic CMOS sensor. Each micro-lens is paired with a digitally controllable liquid crystal (LC) aperture.
*   **Aperture Control:** Each LC aperture operates independently, capable of transitioning between fully open, fully closed, and multiple intermediate states.  Control is achieved via a dedicated driver chip interfacing with the CMOS sensor readout. Aperture size can be defined in steps of 1% from fully open to fully closed.
*   **Capture Modes:**
    *   *Light Field Mode:* During capture, the array cycles through various aperture configurations (e.g., sparse sampling, dense sampling, gradients) rapidly, collecting data at each configuration. This creates a 4D dataset (x, y, aperture configuration, intensity). This cycle time is programmable.
    *   *Multi-Aperture Imaging:*  Fixed aperture configurations are used to capture multiple images simultaneously, enabling higher dynamic range or color accuracy.
    *    *Standard Imaging:* All apertures open, functioning as a traditional camera sensor.
*   **Data Acquisition:**  The CMOS sensor is designed for high-speed readout, capable of capturing data from all pixels at a minimum frame rate of 60Hz, even during variable aperture operation. Data is streamed to an on-board processor for real-time processing and storage.
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  *Calibration:* A calibration procedure is required to map pixel positions to aperture configurations and correct for optical distortions. This is a one time process.
    2.  *Light Field Reconstruction:* A computational light field reconstruction algorithm is applied to the captured data, creating a representation of the light field.
    3.  *Refocusing and Viewpoint Shifting:* Algorithms are used to digitally refocus the image at different depths and shift the viewpoint.
    4.  *Depth Estimation:* Depth maps are generated based on light field data.
*   **Mechanical Specs:**  Sensor array dimensions: 10mm x 10mm.  Total camera dimensions: 30mm x 30mm x 20mm.
*   **Power Requirements:** 5V, 2A.

**Pseudocode (Capture Sequence - Light Field Mode):**

```
// Initialization
initializeSensor()
initializeApertureDrivers()

// Capture Loop
while (captureEnabled) {
    // Select Aperture Pattern
    pattern = selectNextPattern(patternsArray) //Cycles through pre-defined aperture configurations
    
    // Apply Aperture Pattern
    for (int i = 0; i < arrayRows; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < arrayCols; j++) {
            setAperture(i, j, pattern[i][j]) //Sets the LC aperture size for each element
        }
    }
    
    // Capture Image
    image = captureImage()
    
    // Store Image + Aperture Configuration
    storeData(image, pattern)

    //Delay for optimal frame rate
    delay(frameTime)
}

//Function to select the next aperture pattern
pattern = selectNextPattern(patternsArray) {
  //Cycle through an array of predetermined aperture patterns
  currentPatternIndex++
  if (currentPatternIndex >= patternsArray.length) {
    currentPatternIndex = 0
  }
  return patternsArray[currentPatternIndex]
}
```

**Innovation:** This expands the variable aperture idea into a 2D array, enabling real-time capture of rich light field data *without* the mechanical complexity of existing systems. The programmable nature of the apertures allows for highly customized sampling patterns, enabling advanced computational photography techniques. This is effectively a "light field on a chip".
