## Automated Micro-Fluidic Die Coating & Inspection System

**Concept:** Instead of a static coating application post-dicing, integrate a micro-fluidic coating system *during* the dicing process. This allows for precise, localized coating application directly into the saw streets *as* the die are being separated, and immediate post-application inspection.

**System Components:**

1.  **Modified Dicing Saw:** The standard dicing saw is outfitted with multiple micro-fluidic nozzles positioned *adjacent* to the blade. These nozzles are connected to a reservoir of the epoxy adhesive/coating material.
2.  **Micro-Fluidic Control System:** A high-precision pump and valve system regulates the flow of coating material to each nozzle. This allows for variable coating thickness and composition, tailored to specific die designs or requirements.
3.  **Vision System (Integrated):** High-resolution cameras, positioned *above and below* the wafer, monitor the coating process in real-time. This system performs the following functions:
    *   **Street Detection:** Identifies the saw streets based on the cutting path of the blade.
    *   **Coating Monitoring:**  Monitors the volume and distribution of the coating material within the streets. Detects voids, bubbles, or unevenness.
    *   **Post-Coating Inspection:**  Inspects the coated die for any defects (e.g., coating spills, incomplete coverage) *immediately after* separation.
4.  **Automated Wafer Handling System:**  A robotic system loads, positions, and removes wafers from the dicing/coating station.
5.  **Closed-Loop Control System:** The vision system provides feedback to the micro-fluidic control system, adjusting the coating flow to ensure optimal coverage and quality.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  Wafer is loaded onto the dicing/coating station.
2.  Dicing blade and micro-fluidic nozzles are aligned with the first saw street.
3.  Blade initiates cutting. Simultaneously, the micro-fluidic nozzles dispense the coating material into the saw street *ahead* of the blade.
4.  The closed-loop control system adjusts the coating flow based on the vision systemâ€™s feedback.
5.  The process repeats for each saw street.
6.  Once all die are separated, the vision system performs a final inspection.
7.  The separated die are automatically transferred to the next stage of the manufacturing process.

**Pseudocode (Control System Logic):**

```
// Variables
streetWidth = // measured from wafer map
bladeSpeed = //current blade speed
coatingFlowRate = //initial flow rate
visionData = //data from the vision system

// Main Loop (executed for each saw street)
while (street not fully cut):
    coatingFlowRate = initialFlowRate * (bladeSpeed / targetBladeSpeed)
    dispenseCoating(coatingFlowRate, streetWidth)
    visionData = captureVisionData(street)
    if (visionData.voidDetected == True):
        increaseCoatingFlowRate(coatingFlowRate * 1.1) //adjust flow
    if (visionData.spillDetected == True):
        decreaseCoatingFlowRate(coatingFlowRate * 0.9)
    if (visionData.coverageIncomplete == True):
        increaseCoatingFlowRate(coatingFlowRate * 1.05)
    updateCoatingFlowRate(coatingFlowRate)
    wait(timeStep)

```

**Material Specifications:**

*   Coating Material: UV-curable epoxy adhesive with optimized viscosity for micro-fluidic dispensing.
*   Nozzle Material: Chemically resistant polymer (e.g., PTFE) with precise micro-machined orifice.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced Coating Defects: Precise, localized coating minimizes spills and voids.
*   Improved Throughput: Coating and dicing are performed simultaneously.
*   Enhanced Process Control: Real-time inspection and feedback.
*   Reduced Material Waste: Optimized coating application.
