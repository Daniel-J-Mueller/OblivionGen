## Modular, Bio-Inspired Aerial Vehicle Propulsion – ‘Flapping Wing’ Augmentation

**Concept:** Integrate small, bio-inspired “flapping wing” modules *in addition to* traditional propeller-based propulsion on the aerial vehicle. These modules wouldn’t *replace* propellers, but augment them, particularly during low-speed maneuvers, hovering, and potentially, for improved energy efficiency at certain flight regimes.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** Approximately 6” x 2” x 1” (adjustable based on vehicle scale). Each module housing a miniature flapping wing mechanism.
*   **Wing Material:** Lightweight, flexible polymer composite with embedded piezoelectric actuators.
*   **Actuation:** Piezoelectric actuators control wing articulation – frequency and amplitude are dynamically adjusted.
*   **Power:** Dedicated DC-DC converters within each module, fed from the main battery through the supervisory controller.  Each converter outputs between 12-24V.
*   **Mounting:** Modular mounting points on the airframe – potentially replacing or supplementing existing fairings or structural elements. Multiple modules distributed across the vehicle (e.g., two per side, positioned near the center of lift).
*   **Control System Integration:**
    *   Supervisory controller receives commands from the flight controller.
    *   Each module has a dedicated microcontroller for local control of the piezoelectric actuators.
    *   Communication:  CAN bus or similar robust communication protocol between the supervisory controller and each module’s microcontroller.
    *   Sensor Fusion: Each module incorporates an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to provide feedback on wing motion and overall vehicle attitude.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   Hierarchical control structure.
    *   High-level commands from the flight controller specify desired overall thrust and maneuver profile.
    *   Supervisory controller distributes commands to individual modules.
    *   Each module’s microcontroller executes a control algorithm to optimize wing motion for the given command.
    *   Real-time control loop with feedback from the IMU to stabilize wing motion and improve performance.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Augmented Hover:** Modules provide supplemental lift and stability during hovering, reducing load on the propellers.
    *   **Low-Speed Maneuvering:** Modules enable tighter turns and improved control at low speeds.
    *   **Energy Optimization:** At certain cruise speeds, modules may contribute to lift, reducing propeller RPM and saving energy.
    *   **Emergency Stabilization:** If a propeller fails, modules can provide limited thrust and control to aid in a safe landing.
*   **Safety Features:**
    *   Redundant power supply to each module.
    *   Fail-safe mechanism to retract or lock wings in case of malfunction.
    *   Temperature monitoring and overcurrent protection.

**Pseudocode (Module Control Algorithm):**

```
// Inputs:
//   desired_thrust (float): Target thrust from module
//   vehicle_attitude (vector): Vehicle’s attitude (roll, pitch, yaw)
//   imu_data (vector): IMU data (acceleration, angular velocity)

// Outputs:
//   actuator_signals (vector): Signals to control piezoelectric actuators

// Parameters:
//   max_actuation_frequency (float): Maximum allowable actuation frequency
//   kp_thrust (float): Proportional gain for thrust control
//   kp_attitude (float): Proportional gain for attitude control

// Calculate error between desired thrust and actual thrust
thrust_error = desired_thrust - calculate_actual_thrust(imu_data)

// Calculate error between desired attitude and actual attitude
attitude_error = desired_attitude - imu_data.attitude

// Calculate actuator signals based on error and gains
actuator_signals = kp_thrust * thrust_error + kp_attitude * attitude_error

// Limit actuator signals to maximum allowable frequency
actuator_signals = clamp(actuator_signals, 0, max_actuation_frequency)

// Send actuator signals to piezoelectric actuators
send_actuator_signals(actuator_signals)
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simply improving propeller efficiency and explores fundamentally different methods of generating lift and control. The bio-inspired approach could lead to more agile, efficient, and quieter aerial vehicles, particularly in urban environments.  The modularity allows for scalability and customization based on vehicle size and mission requirements.
