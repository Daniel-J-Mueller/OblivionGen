## Modular Bin System with Integrated Environmental Sensors

**Concept:** A bin system that transcends simple waste containment, evolving into a localized environmental monitoring and data collection hub. The core idea is to move beyond a static bin and create a modular, interconnected network of "smart" bins.

**Modules:**

*   **Base Unit:** Standard bin form factor, constructed from recycled, durable plastic. Includes standard waste containment area.
*   **Sensor Module:** Attaches to the base unit. Includes:
    *   Air Quality Sensor (PM2.5, VOCs, CO2)
    *   Temperature/Humidity Sensor
    *   Sound Level Sensor
    *   Fill Level Sensor (Ultrasonic or Infrared)
*   **Compaction Module:** Motorized compaction system to increase bin capacity. Solar powered or low-voltage AC.  Activated by fill level sensor reaching a threshold.
*   **Sorting Module:** Basic automated sorting (e.g., plastic bottles, aluminum cans) using image recognition and pneumatic actuators. Requires user pre-sorting into broad categories.
*   **Power Module:** Solar panel integrated into the lid or side, with battery storage for powering sensors and compaction.
*   **Communication Module:**  LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, or cellular connectivity for data transmission to a central server.
*   **Aesthetic Module:** Interchangeable outer shells allowing customization of the bin’s appearance.

**System Architecture:**

1.  **Data Collection:** Sensors continuously gather data on air quality, temperature, sound levels, and fill level.
2.  **Local Processing:**  A microcontroller within the bin processes the raw sensor data. Basic anomaly detection (e.g., unusually high VOC levels) can be performed locally.
3.  **Data Transmission:** Processed data is transmitted wirelessly to a central server.
4.  **Central Server:**  Data is aggregated, analyzed, and visualized on a dashboard. City planners, waste management companies, and researchers can access the data.  Alerts can be triggered based on pre-defined thresholds (e.g., high pollution levels).
5.  **Modular Interconnectivity:** Bins communicate with each other, forming a mesh network to extend coverage and improve data reliability.

**Pseudocode (Data Flow – Sensor Module):**

```
loop:
  readAirQualitySensor() -> airQualityData
  readTemperatureSensor() -> temperatureData
  readSoundSensor() -> soundData
  readFillLevelSensor() -> fillLevelData

  //Basic Error Checking (example)
  if (airQualityData.PM25 > threshold) {
    logEvent("High PM2.5 detected")
    triggerAlert()
  }

  packageData = {
    timestamp: getCurrentTimestamp(),
    airQuality: airQualityData,
    temperature: temperatureData,
    soundLevel: soundData,
    fillLevel: fillLevelData
  }

  transmitData(packageData)

  delay(60 seconds) // Sample every minute
end loop
```
