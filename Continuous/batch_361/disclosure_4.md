## Dynamic Range Key Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the range key functionality by dynamically synthesizing range keys based on query parameters. Instead of relying solely on pre-existing attributes as range keys, the system generates temporary, composite range keys at query time. This unlocks querying capabilities beyond static attribute ranges.

**Specification:**

1.  **Query Parameter Analysis:** The system analyzes incoming queries for parameters suitable for range key synthesis. These parameters aren't necessarily stored attributes but represent query conditions (e.g., time since last action, calculated score based on multiple attributes, proximity to a geographic location).

2.  **Synthesis Function Registry:** Maintain a registry of synthesis functions. Each function accepts query parameters and existing item attributes as input and outputs a synthesized range key value. These functions are dynamically loadable/configurable.

3.  **Temporary Range Key Attribute:** When a query uses parameters suitable for synthesis, the system creates a temporary attribute in the item schema *during query processing*. This attribute holds the synthesized range key value. The value is calculated on-the-fly for each item being evaluated.

4.  **Indexing with Synthetic Key:**  The query is then executed using the synthesized key as the range key component. This enables efficient filtering based on the dynamically generated criteria.

5.  **Query Optimization:**  The system estimates the cardinality of the synthesized key. If the cardinality is low (meaning many items will have the same synthesized range key value), a traditional range scan is performed. If the cardinality is high, the system can leverage partitioning to distribute the workload across computing nodes.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function processQuery(query) {
  // 1. Analyze query for synthesis parameters
  synthesisParams = analyzeQuery(query);

  if (synthesisParams != null) {
    // 2. Retrieve synthesis function from registry
    synthesisFunction = getSynthesisFunction(synthesisParams.functionName);

    // 3. Iterate through items in relevant hash key partition
    for each item in partition {
      // 4. Calculate synthesized range key value
      synthesizedKey = synthesisFunction(item, synthesisParams);

      // 5. Compare synthesized key to query range
      if (synthesizedKey within query range) {
        // 6. Return item
        return item;
      }
    }
  } else {
    // 7. Standard query processing
    processStandardQuery(query);
  }
}
```

**Example Synthesis Function (Time Since Last Action):**

```python
def time_since_last_action(item, params):
  now = time.time()
  last_action_timestamp = item.get("last_action_timestamp")
  if last_action_timestamp is None:
    return float('inf') # Treat items with no action as very old
  return now - last_action_timestamp
```

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Dynamically Loadable Code Module System
*   In-Memory Cache for Synthesis Functions
*   Enhanced Query Planner to consider Synthesis Function cardinality estimates
*   Monitoring system to track Synthesis Function performance and resource usage.
