## Adaptive Network Behavioral Profiling & Predictive False Positive Mitigation

**Concept:** Expand upon the VPC flow log analysis to create *dynamic* behavioral profiles for network entities (IP addresses, domains) and *predict* potential false positives *before* they are flagged, leveraging time-series anomaly detection. This moves beyond reactive analysis (identifying false positives *after* flagging) to proactive prevention.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** VPC Flow Logs (as per the provided patent), DNS resolution data, WHOIS data (domain registration info), threat intelligence feeds (optional â€“ for context, not primary analysis).
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Time-Series Data:** Extract numerical features from flow logs over sliding time windows (e.g., 5m, 15m, 1h). Examples:
        *   Bytes transferred (in/out)
        *   Packet count (in/out)
        *   Unique destination IPs contacted
        *   Number of SYN packets
        *   Number of failed connection attempts.
    *   **Categorical Feature Encoding:**  Encode categorical data (e.g., protocol type, port numbers) using techniques like one-hot encoding or embedding layers.
    *   **WHOIS/DNS Features:** Incorporate domain age, registration country, DNS record types, and changes in DNS records as static features.
*   **Output:**  Structured feature vectors representing network entity behavior over time, suitable for time-series modeling.

**2. Time-Series Modeling & Anomaly Detection Module:**

*   **Model Selection:** Employ a combination of time-series models:
    *   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks:** Capture temporal dependencies in network behavior.  Train separate LSTMs per network entity type (IP address, domain).
    *   **Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL):**  Identify and remove seasonal patterns (e.g., daily/weekly traffic fluctuations) to focus on anomalies.
    *   **Prophet:** A forecasting procedure for time series data, which can be used to predict future traffic patterns.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:** Each model generates an anomaly score based on the deviation of observed behavior from predicted behavior. Implement multiple scoring methods:
    *   **Residual Error:**  Measure the difference between predicted and actual values.
    *   **Statistical Control Limits:** Define upper and lower control limits based on historical data.
    *   **Reconstruction Error:** For LSTM models, measure the reconstruction error (difference between input and reconstructed output).
*   **Dynamic Thresholding:** Implement dynamic thresholds based on the historical anomaly score distribution for each network entity. This allows for adaptive sensitivity and reduces false alarms.

**3. Predictive False Positive Mitigation Module:**

*   **Pre-Flagging Assessment:** *Before* a domain/IP is flagged as malicious by an external source, the system assesses its anomaly score.
*   **Confidence Score Generation:** Combine anomaly score, dynamic threshold, and WHOIS/DNS data to generate a "confidence score" indicating the likelihood of the entity being legitimately malicious.
*   **Alert Suppression/Delay:**  If the confidence score is below a certain threshold, the system:
    *   **Suppresses** the alert from the external source (requires integration with the source).
    *   **Delays** the alert, triggering further investigation (e.g., sandboxing, manual review).
*   **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate feedback from manual review/sandboxing to retrain the time-series models and improve prediction accuracy.  Use a Reinforcement Learning model to learn optimal thresholds for suppression/delay.

**4. Architecture:**

*   **Distributed System:** Deploy the modules as microservices for scalability and fault tolerance.
*   **Data Storage:** Use a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for efficient storage and retrieval of flow log data.
*   **Stream Processing:** Use a stream processing framework (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache Flink) for real-time data ingestion and processing.
*   **API Integration:** Expose APIs for integrating with external threat intelligence sources and security tools.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Scoring):**

```
function calculate_anomaly_score(flow_log_data, lstm_model, historical_data):
  predicted_values = lstm_model.predict(flow_log_data)
  residual_error = calculate_residual_error(flow_log_data, predicted_values)

  std_dev = calculate_standard_deviation(historical_data)
  z_score = residual_error / std_dev

  anomaly_score = abs(z_score)

  return anomaly_score
```
