## Adaptive Resonance Thermal Imaging

**Concept:** Combine infrared polarization imaging (as in the provided patent) with localized thermal modulation and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) neural networks to create a dynamic, self-learning biometric signature. This moves beyond static palm feature extraction to a dynamic understanding of individual thermoregulatory responses.

**Specs:**

*   **Thermal Modulation Array:** A thin-film array of micro-Peltier elements embedded within a hand-scanning enclosure. Resolution: 100 x 100 elements.  Capable of localized heating/cooling within a range of 20-40°C, with millisecond-level response times.
*   **Polarized Infrared Camera System:** A multi-spectral camera system, similar to the base patent, with the addition of a high-speed shutter (capable of >100 fps) and improved thermal sensitivity (<20mK).  Two polarization filters (linear and circular) will be employed.
*   **ART Neural Network:** A fast-learning, self-organizing neural network based on Adaptive Resonance Theory (specifically, ART1 or ART2).  Input layer size: 10,000 (representing the combined thermal and polarized IR data). Category layer size: dynamically adjusted based on user population.
*   **Scanning Protocol:**
    1.  Initial Baseline Scan:  Acquire polarized IR images without thermal modulation.
    2.  Thermal Perturbation Sequence: Apply a pseudo-random sequence of localized heating/cooling patterns to the palm using the thermal modulation array.  Patterns will vary in frequency, amplitude, and spatial distribution.
    3.  Dynamic IR Acquisition: Simultaneously acquire polarized IR images *during* the thermal perturbation sequence.  High-speed capture is critical.
    4.  Data Preprocessing: Normalize IR data and correct for environmental variations.
*   **Feature Extraction & Signature Creation:**
    1.  Time-Series Analysis: Analyze the temporal changes in IR signature across each thermal modulation element.
    2.  ART Training: Train the ART neural network using the time-series IR data.  The network will learn to associate specific thermal perturbation patterns with unique thermoregulatory responses.
    3.  Signature Generation: The ART network’s learned category weights will represent the user’s dynamic thermal signature. This signature will be a multi-dimensional vector representing the network's internal state.

**Pseudocode (Signature Generation):**

```
function generateSignature(thermalPerturbationSequence, irImageSequence):
  // Preprocess IR images (noise reduction, normalization)

  // Input: thermalPerturbationSequence (array of heating/cooling patterns)
  //        irImageSequence (array of polarized IR images captured during perturbation)

  // Apply thermal perturbation sequence to hand

  // Capture IR images during perturbation

  // Calculate temporal changes in IR signature

  // Input: temporalChanges (time-series IR data)

  // Initialize ART Neural Network

  // Train ART network using temporalChanges

  // Extract category weights from trained ART network

  // Return categoryWeights (user's dynamic thermal signature)
end function
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Dynamic signatures are significantly harder to spoof than static biometric data.
*   **Individual Variability:** Thermoregulatory responses are highly individual, providing a unique identifier.
*   **Robustness:** Less susceptible to surface variations (skin temperature, moisture) compared to traditional palm print analysis.
*   **Potential for Health Monitoring:**  Can provide insights into an individual’s circulatory health and thermal regulation.
