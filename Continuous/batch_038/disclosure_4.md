## Dynamic Query Expansion with Generative Scene Context

**Core Concept:** Augment tail queries not just with *similar* head queries, but with generative contextual scene descriptions derived from predicted user intent, then use these scenes to expand the search space *before* reformulation.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses heavily on mapping queries to existing historical data. This design introduces *new* search space based on predicted *situations* a user might be in. This moves beyond simply finding what others searched for, to anticipating needs.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Intent Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Tail query (text string).
    *   Process: Employ a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned for intent classification.  Outputs a probability distribution over pre-defined intent categories (e.g., "gift-giving," "home improvement," "outdoor activity"). Also outputs a ‘scene descriptor prompt’ – a text string summarizing the likely user scenario.
    *   Output: Intent category probabilities, Scene Descriptor Prompt.

2.  **Scene Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Scene Descriptor Prompt.
    *   Process: Utilize a text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) to generate a representative image of the predicted user scenario. This image acts as a visual 'scene context'.
    *   Output: Image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG).

3.  **Multi-Modal Embedding Space:**
    *   Creation:  Train a multi-modal embedding model (e.g., CLIP) to map both text queries (head and tail) *and* generated scene images into a common embedding space.
    *   Process: The embedding space is crucial.  Queries and scenes are represented as vectors.

4.  **Dynamic Query Expansion:**
    *   Input: Tail query embedding, scene image embedding.
    *   Process:
        1.  Retrieve the *k* nearest neighbor head query embeddings to the tail query embedding.
        2.  Calculate the cosine similarity between the tail query embedding and the scene image embedding.
        3.  Expand the initial set of nearest neighbors by adding the *k* nearest neighbor head query embeddings to the scene image embedding.  This introduces contextual relevance beyond direct query similarity.
        4.  Re-rank the expanded set of head queries based on a weighted combination of cosine similarity to both the tail query and the scene image.

5.  **Reformulation & Search:**
    *   Input: Re-ranked list of head queries.
    *   Process: Select the top *n* head queries.  Use these to generate a reformulated query.
    *   Output: Reformulated query.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def expand_query(tail_query, scene_image, embedding_model, k, n):
    tail_embedding = embedding_model.encode(tail_query)
    scene_embedding = embedding_model.encode(scene_image)

    # Find nearest head query embeddings to tail query
    tail_neighbors = find_nearest_neighbors(tail_embedding, head_query_embeddings, k)

    # Find nearest head query embeddings to scene image
    scene_neighbors = find_nearest_neighbors(scene_embedding, head_query_embeddings, k)

    # Combine and re-rank
    combined_neighbors = tail_neighbors + scene_neighbors
    ranked_neighbors = re_rank(combined_neighbors, tail_embedding, scene_embedding)

    # Select top n for reformulation
    top_n_queries = [query for query, score in ranked_neighbors[:n]]

    # Reformulate (implementation detail - could be averaging, etc.)
    reformulated_query = " ".join(top_n_queries)

    return reformulated_query
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU for LLM and diffusion model inference.
*   Large RAM for storing embeddings and model weights.
*   Fast storage for model and data access.

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond purely lexical or historical query reformulation.  By generating scene context, it attempts to understand the *situation* driving the query, opening the door to more relevant and anticipatory search results. The combination of multi-modal embeddings and scene-based expansion is a unique contribution.
