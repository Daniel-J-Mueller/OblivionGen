## Dynamic Resource Partitioning via Predictive Execution

**Specification:** A system enabling client devices to dynamically partition computational resources – both local and remote – based on *predicted* execution paths of webpage content. This moves beyond simply determining *where* to execute (local vs. remote) to *how much* of each resource to allocate *before* full rendering/execution begins.

**Core Concept:** Webpages are analyzed (client-side, pre-rendering) to build an execution dependency graph. This graph isn’t just about function calls, but also estimates *resource intensity* (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) for each node (function/component).  A predictive model (potentially a lightweight ML model residing on the client) uses this graph to forecast resource requirements for *multiple* potential execution paths – branching logic, user interaction variations.  

**System Components:**

1.  **Resource Estimator (Client-Side):**  A component within the browser responsible for analyzing webpage code (HTML, JavaScript, CSS) and estimating the resource intensity of each function/component. It utilizes heuristics based on code complexity, data size, and known performance characteristics of common web technologies.  It outputs a probabilistic resource demand curve for each potential execution path.

2.  **Predictive Execution Planner (Client-Side):** Uses the probabilistic resource demand curves from the Resource Estimator to generate a resource allocation plan. This plan specifies how much local CPU/memory/bandwidth to reserve, and how much remote processing to request from the network computing provider. The plan accounts for potential contention with other browser tabs/applications.

3.  **Dynamic Resource Broker (Network Computing Provider):** A server-side component that manages remote processing resources and dynamically allocates them to client devices based on the resource allocation plans. It can scale resources up or down as needed, and prioritize requests based on client priority and available capacity.

4. **Execution Orchestrator (Client & Server):** Coordinates execution of components either locally or remotely according to the execution plan. This component handles serialization/deserialization of data, and ensures that components can communicate with each other seamlessly.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side – Predictive Execution Planner):**

```
function generateResourcePlan(executionDependencyGraph):
  resourceDemandCurves = analyzeGraph(executionDependencyGraph) //Generate resource requirements per node

  potentialExecutionPaths = findPossiblePaths(executionDependencyGraph)
  
  for path in potentialExecutionPaths:
    predictedResourceDemand = calculateDemand(path, resourceDemandCurves)

    if predictedResourceDemand.cpu > localCPUThreshold:
      remoteCPUAllocation[path] = predictedResourceDemand.cpu - localCPUThreshold
    else:
      remoteCPUAllocation[path] = 0
      
    if predictedResourceDemand.memory > localMemoryThreshold:
      remoteMemoryAllocation[path] = predictedResourceDemand.memory - localMemoryThreshold
    else:
      remoteMemoryAllocation[path] = 0
      
  return remoteCPUAllocation, remoteMemoryAllocation
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Browser loads webpage.
2.  Resource Estimator analyzes webpage code.
3.  Predictive Execution Planner generates a resource allocation plan.
4.  Browser sends a request to the Dynamic Resource Broker, specifying the requested remote resources.
5.  Dynamic Resource Broker allocates resources and provides a connection to the client.
6.  Browser begins rendering/executing the webpage, dynamically allocating resources based on the execution plan.
7.  Execution Orchestrator monitors resource usage and adjusts allocations as needed.

**Innovation:**

*   **Proactive Resource Allocation:** Moves beyond reactive resource allocation to proactively reserve resources based on predicted demand.
*   **Granular Control:** Enables fine-grained control over resource allocation, optimizing performance and reducing latency.
*   **Scalability:**  Leverages the scalability of the network computing provider to handle fluctuating resource demands.
*   **Adaptive Execution:** Allows the system to adapt to changing conditions, such as network congestion or server load.
* **Client Side Prediction:** Enables prediction without server interaction for speed and privacy.
