## Adaptive Proximity-Based Sensory Augmentation

**Concept:** Leverage the proximity detection and user profile data to dynamically adjust the user’s sensory experience through haptic, auditory, or visual augmentation based on the detected merchant type and user preferences.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Mobile device with existing location services (GPS, Bluetooth beacons, Wi-Fi triangulation).
    *   Haptic feedback actuators integrated into wearable devices (wristband, gloves, vest – configurable by user preference).
    *   Bone conduction headphones or miniature directional speakers.
    *   Optional augmented reality glasses or heads-up display.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Proximity Engine*: Detects merchant presence via location services (similar to existing patent's detection mechanism).  Refines location data using sensor fusion (accelerometer, gyroscope) to filter false positives.
    *   *User Profile Manager*:  Stores user preferences related to sensory augmentation (intensity, type of feedback, preferred merchant categories).
    *   *Sensory Mapping Engine*: Translates merchant category and user preference into specific sensory output profiles.  This engine utilizes a rule-based system *and* machine learning to adapt to user responses over time. (e.g. if a user consistently decreases the intensity of a particular haptic feedback, the engine learns to reduce that intensity in future encounters).
    *   *Sensory Output Driver*: Controls the haptic actuators, headphones/speakers, and AR displays to deliver the designated sensory experience.
*   **Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed continuously on mobile device)

1.  LOCATION = GetCurrentLocation();
2.  MERCHANTS = DetectNearbyMerchants(LOCATION); //Returns list of merchants
3.  FOR EACH MERCHANT IN MERCHANTS:
    4.  IF UserHasTrustedMerchantProfile(MERCHANT.ID):
        5.  PREFERENCE = GetUserPreference(MERCHANT.Category);
        6.  SENSORY_PROFILE = MapMerchantCategoryToSensoryProfile(MERCHANT.Category, PREFERENCE);
        7.  ActivateSensoryOutput(SENSORY_PROFILE);  //Haptics, Audio, Visual
        8.  RecordUserResponse(SENSORY_PROFILE); //Collect data for adaptation
    END FOR
```

*   **Sensory Profile Examples:**
    *   *Coffee Shop:* Gentle warming sensation on wrist, subtle aroma simulation via micro-speaker (if available), soft ambient coffee shop soundscape.
    *   *Bookstore:*  Subtle vibration pattern simulating turning pages, quiet background music, visual highlighting of book covers (via AR glasses) based on user's reading history.
    *   *Clothing Store:*  Simulated texture feedback on fingertips (via haptic gloves) as user browses virtual clothing options (via AR), personalized style recommendations delivered via bone conduction headphones.
    *   *Grocery Store*: Tactile ‘breadcrumb’ trail via wrist-mounted haptics guiding user to items on shopping list.
*   **Data Collection & Adaptation:**
    *   User feedback (explicit ratings, intensity adjustments).
    *   Biometric data (heart rate, skin conductance) to measure emotional response.
    *   Usage patterns (frequency of visits, time spent browsing).
    *   Machine learning algorithms (reinforcement learning) to optimize sensory profiles over time.
