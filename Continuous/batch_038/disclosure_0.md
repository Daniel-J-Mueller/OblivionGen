**Dynamic Path Stitching & Predictive Collision Avoidance System**

**Concept:** Extend the mobile drive unit coordination beyond simple reservation of path *segments* to dynamically stitch together optimal paths *between* reservations, factoring in predictive collision avoidance based on drive unit momentum and potential trajectory deviations. The current patent focuses on segment-level access; this builds on that by optimizing the *entire* journey.

**Specs:**

*   **Drive Unit Augmentation:**
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Each mobile drive unit is equipped with a 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer).
    *   **Short-Range Radar/LiDAR:** Each unit has a forward-facing short-range radar or LiDAR sensor for real-time obstacle detection *beyond* the immediate path segment. Range: 5-10 meters.
    *   **Enhanced Communication:** Drive units broadcast:
        *   Current position & velocity (from IMU & localization system).
        *   Planned trajectory (list of reserved path segments & estimated travel time).
        *   Momentum vector (calculated from IMU data – mass * velocity).
        *   Deviation risk factor (calculated based on IMU variance and localized environment assessment).

*   **Management Module Augmentation:**
    *   **Predictive Trajectory Engine:**  A module that receives data from all drive units and predicts their trajectories over a 5-10 second horizon.
    *   **Collision Risk Assessment:**  This engine continuously calculates collision risk based on predicted trajectories, momentum vectors, and deviation risk factors. Uses a time-to-collision (TTC) metric with adjustable sensitivity.
    *   **Dynamic Path Stitching Algorithm:**
        1.  Receives reservation requests for path segments.
        2.  Calculates multiple potential paths between origin & destination, considering reserved segments & available free space.
        3.  The Collision Risk Assessment module evaluates each path.
        4.  The algorithm dynamically stitches together the optimal path, *minimizing* collision risk and travel time. This may involve temporarily "overriding" lower-priority reservations (with negotiation & re-routing).
        5.  Transmits the finalized path to the requesting drive unit.
    *   **Real-Time Path Adjustment:**  The system continuously monitors drive unit positions & trajectories. If a collision risk increases significantly, the system can *dynamically adjust* paths in real-time (sending new instructions to drive units).
    *   **Deviation Factor:** In cases of high-risk deviation, the system provides a "smoothing" instruction – requesting a slight adjustment to speed or trajectory to mitigate the risk.

*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Path Stitching):**

```
function findOptimalPath(origin, destination, reservedSegments):
  potentialPaths = generatePotentialPaths(origin, destination, reservedSegments)
  for path in potentialPaths:
    collisionRisk = assessCollisionRisk(path)
    path.riskScore = collisionRisk
  
  optimalPath = selectOptimalPath(potentialPaths) // Select based on lowest risk score, shortest distance, etc.
  
  return optimalPath

function assessCollisionRisk(path):
  for segment in path:
    for otherUnit in allUnits:
      if otherUnit.predictedTrajectory intersects segment:
        riskScore += calculateCollisionProbability(intersection)
  return riskScore

function calculateCollisionProbability(intersection):
  // factors: relative velocities, distances, momentum, deviation risk
  probability = // complex formula based on factors
  return probability
```

*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Dedicated high-bandwidth, low-latency communication channel for trajectory data & collision alerts.
    *   Standardized message format for trajectory updates, collision warnings, and path adjustment commands.

*   **Safety Mechanisms:**
    *   Emergency stop functionality triggered by imminent collision.
    *   Fail-safe mechanism to revert to a pre-defined safe state in case of communication failure.
