## Dynamic Contextual GUI Elements

**Concept:** A display screen GUI that dynamically alters element appearance *and* functionality based on predicted user intent, derived from biometric and behavioral data. It goes beyond simple personalization to create an interface that anticipates needs.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   **Biometric Sensors:** Integrated heart rate sensor, skin conductance sensor (galvanic skin response), and eye-tracking. Data sampled at 30Hz.
    *   **Behavioral Tracking:**
        *   Touch/Gesture velocity, pressure, and trajectory.
        *   Dwell time on elements.
        *   Application usage patterns (frequency, duration).
        *   Time of day/location data (optional, user permission required).
*   **Intent Prediction Engine:**
    *   Machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) trained on user data and a large dataset of task-completion patterns.
    *   Input: Biometric data, behavioral data, contextual data.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over a set of predefined user intents (e.g., “compose email,” “navigate home,” “play music,” “make a phone call”).
*   **Dynamic GUI Adaptation:**
    *   **Element Morphing:** GUI elements visually transform to suggest potential actions aligned with predicted intent. (e.g., If “compose email” probability > 0.7, the email icon expands and animation cues suggest text input).
    *   **Functionality Priming:** Frequently used functions for the predicted intent are pre-loaded into memory. (e.g., if “navigate home,” the navigation app opens, destination pre-filled with “home” address).
    *   **Contextual Toolbars:** Temporary toolbars appear offering functions relevant to the predicted intent. These toolbars fade after a period of inactivity.
    *   **Adaptive Color Schemes:** The GUI dynamically adjusts its color scheme to optimize readability and reduce eye strain based on predicted cognitive load.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   Modular design with separate modules for data acquisition, intent prediction, and GUI adaptation.
    *   API for integrating with existing applications.
    *   User-configurable privacy settings to control data collection and personalization.

**Pseudocode (GUI Adaptation Module):**

```
function updateGUI(intentProbabilities):
  for each element in GUI:
    element.resetToDefault()

  predictedIntent = getHighestProbabilityIntent(intentProbabilities)

  if predictedIntent == "compose email":
    expandEmailIcon()
    showTextInputCue()
    preloadEmailApp()
  else if predictedIntent == "navigate home":
    expandNavigationIcon()
    preloadNavigationAppWithDestination("home")
  // Add more intent-specific adaptations

  updateColorSchemeBasedOnCognitiveLoad(intentProbabilities)
```
