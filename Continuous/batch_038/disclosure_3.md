## Dynamic Network Persona Assignment

**Concept:** Leverage the edge device selection mechanism described in the patent to create and dynamically assign "network personas" to individual computing nodes. This goes beyond simple traffic routing; it allows a node to *appear* to be located at different geographic locations or associated with different network characteristics, controlled by the selected edge device.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A “Persona” is a configuration file stored on a central management server, defining network parameters: egress IP address range, geographic location metadata (for geolocation-based services), default MTU, supported protocols (e.g., IPv6 prioritization).
*   **Node Registration:** Each computing node registers with the central management server, providing identity information and a list of desired Persona capabilities (e.g., "low latency," "high bandwidth," "privacy focused").
*   **Dynamic Persona Assignment:** The manager module, on boot or when network conditions change, requests a Persona assignment from the central server. The server selects a Persona based on node capabilities, current network load, policy, or even user preference.
*   **Edge Device Mapping:** The Persona assignment includes a mapping to one or more specific edge devices. The manager module then leverages the existing edge device selection mechanism in the patent to consistently route traffic through the assigned edge device(s).
*   **Traffic Shaping/QoS:** The edge device applies traffic shaping and Quality of Service (QoS) rules based on the assigned Persona.
*   **Persona Switching:** The system supports dynamic Persona switching. Based on application requirements (e.g., a video conference needing low latency, a large file transfer needing high bandwidth), the manager module can request a new Persona assignment, triggering a seamless switchover.
*   **Health Monitoring:** Each edge device reports its health and capacity to the central management server. The server uses this information to optimize Persona assignments and avoid overloading any single device.

**Pseudocode (Manager Module):**

```
on boot:
  register with central management server
  request initial persona assignment

on persona assignment received:
  store persona configuration (IP range, QoS, location metadata)
  store associated edge device(s)
  configure network interface with persona IP settings
  configure edge device selection to prioritize assigned device(s)

on application request (e.g., video conference):
  if request requires specific network characteristics:
    request new persona assignment with those characteristics
  else:
    use current persona settings

on edge device failure:
  notify central management server
  request new persona assignment
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Content Delivery Optimization:** Assign nodes to edge devices geographically closer to content sources for faster downloads.
*   **Privacy Enhancement:** Route traffic through edge devices with enhanced privacy features (e.g., anonymization, encryption).
*   **Geographic Spoofing:** Mask the true location of a node for access to geo-restricted content or services.
*   **Network Resilience:** Dynamically reroute traffic through different edge devices in the event of network outages or congestion.
*   **Testing and Simulation:** Create virtual network environments with different characteristics for application testing.
