## Adaptive Frequency Modulation via Harmonic Mixing

**Concept:** Expand the non-integer division concept beyond simple frequency scaling. Utilize harmonic mixing to *modulate* the target clock’s frequency around a central value, creating a dynamically shifting frequency profile.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:**  A Harmonic Mixer module integrated *after* the described clock divider. This mixer takes two inputs: the output of the clock divider (the ‘base’ frequency) and a low-frequency oscillator (LFO).
*   **LFO Characteristics:**
    *   Waveform:  Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Square – selectable via control register.
    *   Frequency Range:  Adjustable from 0.1Hz to 100Hz via control register.
    *   Amplitude Control:  Controls the extent of frequency modulation.  Expressed as a percentage of the base frequency.
*   **Clock Divider Modification:** The clock divider *must* operate in a feedback loop, receiving a signal from a frequency counter monitoring the harmonic mixer output. This allows the divider ratios to be dynamically adjusted to maintain a *target average frequency*. The feedback loop is essential for stability.
*   **Frequency Counter:** High-resolution frequency counter to accurately monitor the harmonic mixer output. Resolution of at least 1 part in 10^6.
*   **Control Circuit:** Microcontroller or FPGA responsible for:
    *   Setting LFO parameters (waveform, frequency, amplitude).
    *   Managing the feedback loop.
    *   Adjusting the clock divider ratios.
    *   Providing a status register for monitoring system health.
*   **Digital Calibration Routine:**  An automated calibration routine to compensate for component tolerances and ensure accurate frequency modulation.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
// Initialization
set_LFO_waveform(SINE);
set_LFO_frequency(10Hz);
set_LFO_amplitude(5%);
set_target_average_frequency(100MHz);

while (true) {
  read_output_frequency(harmonic_mixer);
  error = target_average_frequency - output_frequency;

  // Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control
  integral += error * dt;
  derivative = (error - last_error) / dt;
  adjustment = Kp * error + Ki * integral + Kd * derivative;

  // Adjust clock divider ratios to minimize error
  adjust_divider_ratios(adjustment);

  last_error = error;
  wait(dt); // Sample time
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Jitter Reduction:** Precisely modulating the clock frequency can be used to cancel out jitter.
*   **Spread Spectrum Clocking:**  Creating a spread spectrum clock to reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI).
*   **Dynamic Power Management:** Adjusting clock frequency based on workload.
*   **Advanced Timing for High-Speed Data Transmission:**  Using frequency modulation to improve signal integrity.
