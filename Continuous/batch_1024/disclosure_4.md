**Dynamic Palette Morphing via Temporal Coherence**

**Concept:** Extend color palette generation beyond static images to incorporate video or live camera feeds. Instead of generating a single palette, create palettes that *evolve* over time, maintaining visual coherence while highlighting changing dominant colors. This creates a "living" color scheme that reacts to the visual input.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Input:** Video stream or sequence of images (frames).
2.  **Frame Analysis:** Each frame is analyzed to determine a preliminary color palette using a method similar to the provided patent. The preliminary palette generation leverages existing methods for identifying representative colors, weighting, and thresholds.
3.  **Palette Smoothing & Transition:** A key component: Instead of abruptly switching to a new palette for each frame, a smoothing algorithm is applied. This algorithm calculates the “distance” between the current palette and the newly generated palette for the current frame (e.g., using CIELAB color difference).
4.  **Temporal Coherence Weighting:** A ‘coherence weight’ parameter controls how strongly the new palette influences the current palette. High weight = faster transitions, lower weight = slower, more stable transitions. The coherence weight can be user-adjustable or dynamically determined based on the amount of color change detected between frames.
5.  **Dominance Tracking:** Track the ‘dominance’ of individual colors *over time*. Colors that consistently appear in the top N of the palette (across multiple frames) are considered “stable” and their transitions are smoothed more aggressively. Transient colors (appearing only briefly) are allowed to fade in/out more quickly.
6.  **Palette Output:** The resulting, dynamically evolving palette is output as a set of color values (RGB, Hex, etc.) with associated weights.  This palette can be used to drive visual effects, UI elements, or any other application where a responsive color scheme is desired.
7.  **Pseudocode (Smoothing Algorithm):**

    ```
    function smooth_palette(current_palette, new_palette, coherence_weight):
        smoothed_palette = {}
        for color in current_palette:
            # Find closest color in new_palette
            closest_color = find_closest_color(color, new_palette)
            # Calculate weighted average of current and new color values
            smoothed_color = (1 - coherence_weight) * current_palette[color] + coherence_weight * new_palette[closest_color]
            smoothed_palette[color] = smoothed_color
        return smoothed_palette
    ```

8. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts the color distance threshold used in palette generation based on the overall color variance detected in the video stream. A high variance stream requires a higher threshold to avoid excessive color fragmentation, while a low variance stream can benefit from a lower threshold for more nuanced palette generation.
9. **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/palette/generate`: Accepts video stream, returns dynamically evolving palette.
    *   `/palette/set_coherence_weight`: Sets the temporal coherence weight.
    *   `/palette/get_palette`: Returns the current palette.
