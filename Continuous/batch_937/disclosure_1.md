## Dynamic Data Lineage with Behavioral Profiling

**Specification:** A system extension to the existing metadata catalog to automatically discover and visualize data lineage *and* behavioral patterns of data transformations.

**Core Concept:** Extend the catalog to not just store *what* transformations occur, but *how* they occur – identifying patterns in the transformation logic itself, and alerting on anomalies. This builds on the existing metadata by layering behavioral analytics.

**Components:**

1.  **Transformation Interception Module:**  A lightweight agent deployed alongside data processing pipelines (Spark jobs, data warehouses, ETL processes). It doesn't modify the data, but passively observes the transformation logic – what functions are called, what parameters are used, the data types involved.  This interception happens *without* requiring code changes in the existing pipelines whenever possible – utilizing tracing/observability tools where available.

2.  **Behavioral Profiler:**  This component analyzes the intercepted transformation data. It creates profiles for each transformation step, capturing statistical information like:
    *   Frequency of function calls.
    *   Distribution of input parameter values.
    *   Data type usage patterns.
    *   Execution time statistics.
    *   Resource consumption (CPU, memory).

3.  **Lineage Graph Enhancement:**  The existing lineage graph (which shows *what* data flows where) is extended with behavioral metadata.  Each edge in the graph now has associated behavioral profiles for the transformation that created that edge.

4.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:** This engine monitors the behavioral profiles over time. It uses statistical methods (e.g., time series analysis, outlier detection) to identify anomalies – significant deviations from expected behavior.  For example:
    *   A sudden increase in the execution time of a transformation.
    *   Unexpected changes in the distribution of input parameter values.
    *   The use of a function that was not previously observed.

5.  **Alerting and Visualization:**  When an anomaly is detected, the system generates an alert and visualizes the affected lineage path.  The visualization highlights the anomalous transformation step and provides detailed information about the anomaly.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
function detect_anomaly(transformation_profile, historical_profiles):
  # Calculate a similarity score between the current profile and historical profiles
  similarity_score = calculate_similarity(transformation_profile, historical_profiles)

  # If the similarity score is below a threshold, flag the transformation as anomalous
  if similarity_score < anomaly_threshold:
    anomaly_details = {
      "transformation_id": transformation_profile.id,
      "anomaly_type": "Behavioral Deviation",
      "details": "Significant deviation from historical behavior."
    }
    return anomaly_details
  else:
    return None
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `TransformationProfile`: Contains metadata about a transformation step (ID, function name, input data types, output data types, execution time statistics, resource consumption statistics).
*   `LineageGraph`: A graph data structure representing the data lineage. Each node represents a data asset, and each edge represents a transformation. Edges are annotated with `TransformationProfile` objects.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Data Quality Monitoring:** Detect anomalies that may indicate data quality issues.
*   **Security Monitoring:** Detect unauthorized changes to data transformation logic.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Identify performance bottlenecks in data pipelines.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Quickly identify the root cause of data quality or performance issues.
