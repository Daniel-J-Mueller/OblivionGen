## Dynamic Multi-Modal Similarity for Tariff Classification

**Concept:** Expand the item similarity scoring to incorporate not just attributes and values, but also visual and textual data extracted from sources *beyond* the item description – specifically, social media posts, online forums, and product review sites. This creates a dynamic, context-aware similarity assessment.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion Module:**
    *   Input: New item data (attributes, values), item image, item description.
    *   API connections to:
        *   Social Media Platforms (Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest – using appropriate APIs for data access).
        *   Online Forums (Reddit, Quora – web scraping with robust error handling).
        *   Product Review Sites (Amazon, Yelp – web scraping and API access where available).
    *   Processing: Extract relevant text and images associated with items *similar* to the new item (based on initial attribute/value matching – a lightweight first pass).  Filter noise (ads, irrelevant posts).
*   **Multi-Modal Feature Extraction:**
    *   **Textual Data:**  Use pre-trained language models (BERT, RoBERTa) to generate embeddings for extracted text.  Focus on capturing *use cases* and *user perceptions* of the item.
    *   **Visual Data:** Utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) – ResNet, Inception – to extract feature vectors from images.  Include images from social media/reviews, not just the provided item image. Consider object detection within images to identify key features.
    *   **Attribute/Value Data:** Standardized vector representation as in the base patent.
*   **Dynamic Similarity Scoring:**
    *   **Weighted Sum:** Combine similarity scores from attribute/value, textual, and visual features.
    *   **Attention Mechanism:** Implement an attention mechanism to dynamically adjust the weights based on the context of the new item. For example, if the item is fashion-related, visual and textual data might receive higher weights than attributes.
    *   **Contextual Embedding:**  Combine the embeddings from all modalities into a single contextual embedding representing the item.
*   **Classification Engine:**
    *   Utilize a similarity search algorithm (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) to compare the contextual embedding of the new item with embeddings of previously classified items.
    *   Assign the item classification code associated with the closest match.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor the accuracy of classifications.
    *   Implement a system for manual review and correction of misclassifications.
    *   Use the corrected data to retrain the language models and CNNs, improving accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode (Similarity Scoring):**

```
function calculate_similarity(new_item, previously_classified_items):
  attribute_similarity = calculate_attribute_similarity(new_item, previously_classified_items)
  textual_embedding = extract_textual_embedding(new_item)
  visual_embedding = extract_visual_embedding(new_item)

  for item in previously_classified_items:
    item_textual_embedding = extract_textual_embedding(item)
    item_visual_embedding = extract_visual_embedding(item)
    textual_similarity = cosine_similarity(textual_embedding, item_textual_embedding)
    visual_similarity = cosine_similarity(visual_embedding, item_visual_embedding)

    # Dynamic Weighting (example – adjust based on item category)
    if item_category == "Fashion":
      weight_text = 0.3
      weight_visual = 0.4
      weight_attribute = 0.3
    else:
      weight_text = 0.2
      weight_visual = 0.2
      weight_attribute = 0.6

    overall_similarity = (weight_attribute * attribute_similarity) + (weight_text * textual_similarity) + (weight_visual * visual_similarity)
    append (overall_similarity, item)

  return highest_similarity_item
```

This approach moves beyond static attributes and values to incorporate how items are *perceived* and *used* in the real world, significantly improving classification accuracy and reducing manual intervention. It leverages the collective intelligence available online to create a more robust and dynamic tariff classification system.
