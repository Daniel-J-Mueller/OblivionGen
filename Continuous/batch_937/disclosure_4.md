## Dynamic Expiration Based on User Affinity

**Concept:** Extend the expiration data system to incorporate user-specific data, creating a tiered expiration system based not just on resource popularity, but on individual user affinity for that resource.

**Specs:**

*   **User Profile Integration:** Each user (identified via cookies, login, etc.) maintains a local “affinity score” for each cached resource. This score starts at a baseline (e.g., 0) and increases with each access. Decay mechanisms are also needed - the score reduces over time if the resource isn't accessed.
*   **Tiered Expiration:**  Instead of a single expiration time based on hierarchy level, implement three tiers:
    *   **Tier 1 (High Affinity):**  Resources with a user's high affinity score receive extremely short expiration times at edge caches - nearly real-time refresh.
    *   **Tier 2 (Medium Affinity):**  Resources with a medium affinity receive standard expiration times as described in the existing patent.
    *   **Tier 3 (Low/No Affinity):** Resources with low or no affinity receive longer expiration times and are prioritized for eviction.
*   **Cache Server Modification:** Cache servers must be modified to query a user profile service (or access a local cache of user profiles) to determine a user’s affinity score for the requested resource.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Affinity scores are not static. A machine learning model analyzes user behavior (access patterns, time of day, device type, etc.) to refine affinity score calculation and prediction.
*   **Hierarchical Override:** The hierarchical expiration rules from the base patent *still* apply as a fallback. If a user profile is unavailable or the affinity score is undetermined, the standard hierarchical expiration is used.

**Pseudocode (Cache Server Request Handling):**

```
function handleResourceRequest(request):
    resourceId = request.resourceId
    userId = request.userId // or extract from request headers

    affinityScore = getUserAffinity(userId, resourceId)

    if affinityScore > HIGH_AFFINITY_THRESHOLD:
        expirationTime = VERY_SHORT_EXPIRATION
    elif affinityScore > MEDIUM_AFFINITY_THRESHOLD:
        expirationTime = STANDARD_EXPIRATION // From patent
    else:
        expirationTime = LONG_EXPIRATION

    // Apply hierarchical override if needed

    if resource is in cache and time hasn't expired:
        return cached resource
    else:
        fetch resource
        cache resource with calculated expirationTime
        return resource
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Latency:**  Frequently accessed, user-specific resources are served instantly.
*   **Improved User Experience:**  Personalized caching makes the application feel more responsive and tailored.
*   **Optimized Cache Usage:**  Cache space is dynamically allocated based on individual user preferences.
*   **Enhanced Personalization:**  The system learns user preferences over time, further improving the user experience.
