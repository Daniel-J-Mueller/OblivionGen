## Dynamic Access Request Shunting with Predictive Pre-Authorization

**Concept:** Extend the independently configurable access device to not just *control* access, but to *predict* access needs and proactively pre-authorize requests *before* they fully materialize. This dramatically reduces latency and improves system responsiveness, particularly for frequently accessed resources.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** 'Access Prediction Engine' (APE) integrated within the independently configurable access device.
*   **Data Input:** APE receives real-time access request patterns (resource ID, user ID, access type - read/write/execute), historical access logs, and predictive modeling data.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** APE employs machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, Markov models) to forecast future access requests. These models adapt based on observed patterns and changing workloads.  Model training occurs offline, but the APE dynamically adjusts prediction weights.
*   **Shunting Mechanism:** The APE identifies potential future requests (high confidence predictions). Instead of waiting for the full request, it initiates a "shadow authorization" – a preliminary access check against the access control policies.
*   **Pre-Authorization Cache:** The results of shadow authorizations are stored in a dedicated “Pre-Authorization Cache” – a fast, low-latency memory.
*   **Request Interception & Completion:**  When a predicted request arrives, the access device *intercepts* it.  It checks the Pre-Authorization Cache.
    *   If a valid pre-authorization exists, the request is immediately granted.
    *   If no pre-authorization exists (or is invalid), the device falls back to the standard access control lookup process.
*   **Dynamic Cache Invalidation:** Pre-authorization entries have a Time-To-Live (TTL) based on the prediction confidence and resource volatility.  The system also supports explicit cache invalidation triggered by resource updates or policy changes.
*   **Protection Type Parameter Handling:** Extend existing protection type parameter handling to include a 'prediction confidence level' parameter.  The device can selectively apply different levels of pre-authorization based on this confidence.
*   **Hardware Implementation:** Optimized for ASIC/SoC implementation. Leverage dedicated hardware accelerators for the ML models and cache access.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function processAccessRequest(request):
    request.predictionConfidence = getPredictionConfidence(request)

    if request.predictionConfidence > threshold:
        cacheKey = generateCacheKey(request)
        preAuthResult = lookupPreAuth(cacheKey)

        if preAuthResult.isValid:
            // Grant access immediately
            applyPreAuth(request, preAuthResult)
            return granted
        else:
            // Fallback to standard access control
            result = performStandardAccessControl(request)
            return result
    else:
        // Standard access control – no prediction
        result = performStandardAccessControl(request)
        return result

function performStandardAccessControl(request):
    // Existing access control logic (lookup user/host policies)
    // ...
    return result

function lookupPreAuth(cacheKey):
    // Lookup in Pre-Authorization Cache
    // Check TTL and validity
    return preAuthResult

function applyPreAuth(request, preAuthResult):
    // Apply pre-authorized permissions to the request
    // ...

function getPredictionConfidence(request):
    // Access Prediction Engine (APE) – ML model
    // Returns a confidence level (0.0 - 1.0)
    return confidenceLevel
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced Latency: Significantly faster access for frequently used resources.
*   Improved Throughput: Handles more requests with the same hardware.
*   Enhanced Security: Proactive access checks can prevent malicious activity.
*   Scalability: Enables better scaling of interconnected systems.
