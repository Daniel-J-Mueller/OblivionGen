**Dynamic Attribute Weighting for Price Suggestion**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A 'Relevance Engine' residing within the existing price suggestion application.
*   **Data Input:** Historical sales data (as currently used), user search queries (keywords, filters), real-time market data (competitor pricing, supply/demand indicators), and user behavioral data (browsing history, purchase history, saved items).
*   **Attribute Database:** An expanded attribute database, going beyond the initial item classifications. This includes sentiment analysis of product reviews (e.g., 'comfortable', 'durable'), image analysis (identifying visual features like color, style), and textual feature extraction (identifying key selling points).
*   **Weighting Algorithm:** A machine learning model (e.g., neural network) trained to dynamically assign weights to each attribute based on the input data.  The model learns which attributes are most predictive of price for a given item and context.
*   **Contextual Factors:** The Relevance Engine considers contextual factors like time of year (seasonality), geographical location (local demand), and current trends (popularity).
*   **User Profile Integration:**  Integrate a user profile to personalize attribute weighting.  For example, a user who frequently purchases high-end items might have a higher weight assigned to 'quality' attributes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_suggested_price(item, user):
  // 1. Retrieve historical sales data for similar items
  historical_data = get_historical_data(item)

  // 2. Retrieve user profile data
  user_profile = get_user_profile(user)

  // 3. Analyze current market data
  market_data = analyze_market_data(item)

  // 4. Determine attribute weights
  attribute_weights = calculate_attribute_weights(item, user_profile, market_data)

  // 5. Calculate a weighted average price
  weighted_price = calculate_weighted_price(historical_data, attribute_weights)

  // 6. Adjust price based on contextual factors (seasonality, location, etc.)
  adjusted_price = adjust_price_contextual(weighted_price)

  return adjusted_price

function calculate_attribute_weights(item, user_profile, market_data):
  // Machine Learning Model
  // Input: Item attributes, user profile, market data
  // Output: Weight for each attribute
  weights = ML_Model.predict(item, user_profile, market_data)
  return weights
```

**Innovation Details:**

This system moves beyond static attribute weighting to a dynamic approach. Instead of predefining the importance of attributes, the system *learns* which attributes are most influential in determining price. This allows for more accurate and personalized price suggestions, particularly in dynamic markets where consumer preferences and trends are constantly changing. 

The integration of user behavioral data and real-time market data adds another layer of sophistication, ensuring that price suggestions are relevant to the current context.  The ML model can also identify emerging trends and adjust attribute weights accordingly, proactively adapting to changing market conditions. The system can also utilize a 'confidence' metric to indicate the reliability of the price suggestion, and provide users with insights into the factors that influenced the price.
