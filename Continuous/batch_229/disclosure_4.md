## Dynamic Backup ‘Shadowing’ with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the prioritized backup system with a ‘shadowing’ component that anticipates user needs by pre-fetching likely-to-be-accessed files *before* they are explicitly requested, staging them on faster storage. This creates a tiered backup/access system where frequently used "shadow" copies are immediately available, while comprehensive backups handle long-term archival.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `ShadowEntry`:
    *   `fileID`: Unique identifier for the file.
    *   `location`: Current primary storage location.
    *   `shadowLocation`: Location of the shadow copy.
    *   `accessProbability`:  A floating-point value representing the likelihood the file will be accessed soon (initialized low, updated continuously).
    *   `lastAccessTime`: Timestamp of the last file access.
    *   `preFetchStatus`: Enum {NotQueued, Queued, InProgress, Completed, Error}
    *   `shadowAge`:  Timestamp indicating when the shadow copy was created.

*   `ShadowQueue`: A priority queue of `ShadowEntry` objects, sorted by `accessProbability` (descending) *and* `shadowAge` (ascending – prioritize refreshing older shadows).

**2. Core Components:**

*   **Activity Monitor:**  Continuously monitors file system activity (reads, writes, modifications) as in the provided patent.  Crucially, it also tracks *patterns* of access – e.g., files frequently opened together, files accessed after specific application launches.

*   **Probability Engine:**
    *   Uses the monitored activity to calculate and update the `accessProbability` for each file.
    *   Factors in:
        *   Frequency of recent access.
        *   Recency of access.
        *   Correlation with other file accesses (pattern recognition).
        *   User role/profile (different users have different usage patterns).
        *   Time of day/week (usage patterns vary).
    *   Employs a decay function to reduce probability over time if a file isn’t accessed.

*   **Pre-Fetch Manager:**
    *   Maintains the `ShadowQueue`.
    *   Periodically (or on system idle) examines the queue.
    *   Initiates pre-fetching of files from the primary storage to a designated "shadow storage" tier (e.g., SSD, fast NVMe).
    *   Handles error conditions (e.g., storage full, network issues).
    *   Prioritizes pre-fetch based on the queue order.

*   **File Access Interceptor:**
    *   Before a file is accessed, checks if a shadow copy exists.
    *   If a shadow copy is present and valid (not too old), redirects the access to the shadow copy, bypassing the primary storage.
    *   Logs the file access event for use by the Probability Engine.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:**  The system starts monitoring file system activity. The `ShadowQueue` is initially empty.
2.  **Activity Monitoring:** The Activity Monitor detects file access events.
3.  **Probability Calculation:** The Probability Engine updates the `accessProbability` for the accessed file and other correlated files.
4.  **Queue Management:** Files with sufficiently high `accessProbability` are added to the `ShadowQueue`.
5.  **Pre-Fetch Execution:** The Pre-Fetch Manager selects files from the `ShadowQueue` and copies them to shadow storage.
6.  **Access Interception:** When a user requests a file, the File Access Interceptor checks for a valid shadow copy.  If found, the access is redirected to the shadow copy.
7.  **Queue Update:** The `ShadowQueue` is continuously updated based on user activity and the calculated probabilities.
8.  **Background Sync:** The system periodically synchronizes the shadow storage with the primary storage to ensure data consistency.  Differences are resolved.



**Pseudocode (Pre-Fetch Manager):**

```pseudocode
while (true) {
  if (ShadowQueue is not empty) {
    ShadowEntry entry = ShadowQueue.peek(); // Get highest priority entry
    if (entry.preFetchStatus == NotQueued) {
      entry.preFetchStatus = Queued;
      //Start copy of file from primary storage to shadow storage
      startFileCopy(entry.fileID, entry.location, entry.shadowLocation);
      entry.preFetchStatus = InProgress;
    }
    if (entry.preFetchStatus == InProgress) {
      if(fileCopyComplete(entry.fileID)){
        entry.preFetchStatus = Completed;
      }
    }

    if (entry.preFetchStatus == Completed) {
      ShadowQueue.remove(entry); //remove from Queue
    }
  } else {
    sleep(5); // Wait before checking again
  }
}

```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Predictive Shadowing:** Use machine learning to predict future file access patterns based on historical data and user behavior.
*   **Dynamic Tiering:** Automatically move files between shadow storage and primary storage based on access frequency and predicted usage.
*   **Network Optimization:**  Pre-fetch files over the network during off-peak hours.
*   **Integration with Managed Storage Services:** Seamlessly integrate with cloud-based storage solutions for shadow copies.
