## Dynamic AGV Swarm Topology for Disaster Response

**System Overview:**

A network of AGVs designed not for standardized delivery, but for *adaptive* exploration and resource distribution in dynamically changing environments – specifically, disaster zones. Instead of pre-defined meeting areas and orders, the AGVs operate as a swarm, collaboratively mapping the environment and prioritizing resource delivery based on real-time needs communicated through a decentralized mesh network.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **AGV Base:** Ruggedized all-terrain platform with high ground clearance.
*   **Propulsion:** Independent wheel drive with adaptive suspension.  Each wheel has integrated torque sensors.
*   **Storage:** Modular payload bays configurable for various supplies (water, medical kits, communication equipment). Bays must be rapidly swappable in the field.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   LiDAR: 360° coverage for environment mapping.
    *   Thermal Camera: Detect life signs in debris.
    *   Microphone Array:  Detect sounds of distress.
    *   IMU: Precise location tracking.
    *   Short-Range Radio: Mesh networking.
    *   Long-Range Radio: Communication back to base/emergency services.
    *   Gas Sensors: Detect hazardous materials.
*   **Power:** High-capacity, fast-charging batteries with redundant power systems. Wireless charging capability at designated 'hotspots'.
*   **Communication:** Mesh network utilizing ad-hoc routing. Long-range communication via satellite or cellular.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Swarm Intelligence Algorithm:** A decentralized algorithm enabling AGVs to collaboratively explore, map, and prioritize tasks.  Key components:
    *   **Virtual Force Field:** Each AGV experiences ‘attractive’ forces towards areas of high need (based on detected distress signals) and ‘repulsive’ forces from other AGVs and obstacles.
    *   **Gradient Descent Optimization:** AGVs iteratively move towards the lowest ‘potential energy’ in the virtual force field.
    *   **Task Allocation:** AGVs bid on tasks (e.g., delivering water to a specific location) based on their current position, battery level, and payload capacity.
    *   **Dynamic Path Planning:**  A* or similar algorithm, continuously updated based on real-time environmental changes.
*   **Mapping & Localization:** Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using LiDAR and IMU data.  Creation of a 3D map of the disaster zone.
*   **Distress Signal Processing:** Algorithm to filter out noise and prioritize genuine distress signals (e.g., human voices, radio beacons).
*   **Resource Management:** Algorithm to track available resources and optimize delivery routes.
*   **Hotspot Designation:** System for identifying and designating areas as 'hotspots' – charging stations and resource replenishment areas.
*   **User Interface:** Tablet-based interface for emergency responders to monitor AGV activity, request resources, and designate priority areas.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Swarm Algorithm):**

```
// AGV Initialization
Initialize position, battery level, payload capacity
Join mesh network

// Main Loop
while (batteryLevel > criticalLevel) {
    // Sense environment (LiDAR, thermal camera, microphones)
    environmentData = senseEnvironment()

    // Receive data from mesh network (distress signals, resource requests, AGV locations)
    networkData = receiveNetworkData()

    // Calculate virtual force field based on environmentData and networkData
    forceField = calculateForceField(environmentData, networkData)

    // Calculate desired velocity based on force field
    desiredVelocity = calculateVelocity(forceField)

    // Plan path to desired velocity, avoiding obstacles
    path = planPath(desiredVelocity, obstacles)

    // Execute path
    executePath(path)

    // Transmit location and status to mesh network
    transmitStatus()

    //Check Battery Level
    if (batteryLevel < rechargeThreshold){
        findNearestHotspot();
        navigate_to_hotspot();
        recharge();
    }
}
//If Battery Low - transmit 'need assistance' to network and await rescue
transmit_assistance();
```

**Novelty:** The innovation lies in the fully decentralized swarm behavior and adaptability to dynamic, unpredictable environments.  Existing AGV systems rely on pre-programmed routes and centralized control. This system prioritizes resilience and adaptability, enabling effective disaster response in scenarios where traditional methods are impractical or impossible. The dynamic hotspot designation and autonomous recharging capability further enhance the system's endurance and reliability.
