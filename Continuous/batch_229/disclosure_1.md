**Secure Data 'Lifecycles' & Dynamic Policy Enforcement**

**Specification:**

*   **Core Concept:** Expand beyond location-triggered security to incorporate a data lifecycle model. Assign 'decay' rates and policy shifts based on time *and* location. Think of data having a 'half-life' of security.
*   **Data Tagging Expansion:** Add a 'lifecycle' tag alongside the existing security protocol tag. This tag includes:
    *   `creation_timestamp`
    *   `initial_security_level` (e.g., Confidential, Restricted, Public)
    *   `decay_rate` (a numerical value indicating how quickly security degrades)
    *   `policy_shift_triggers` (location *and* time-based conditions that alter security levels)
*   **Dynamic Policy Engine:** Implement an engine that continuously monitors the data lifecycle tag, current location, and current time. This engine dynamically adjusts security policies on the fly.
*   **Policy Examples:**
    *   A document created in a secure facility (high initial security) decays in security level as time passes and/or if it leaves the secure facility. It might become ‘Restricted’ after 24 hours outside the facility, then ‘Public’ after a week.
    *   Data tagged for ‘emergency response’ may have a very short decay rate – losing all security after a defined time period to ensure information doesn't become stale and misleading.
*   **Client-Side Enforcement:** The client device (phone, laptop) monitors the data lifecycle. It dynamically alters access controls, rendering options, and transmission protocols based on the current security level.
*   **Server-Side Validation:** Server infrastructure validates client-side security decisions to prevent tampering or bypass.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```
function process_data_request(data_file, action):
  data_lifecycle = get_data_lifecycle_tag(data_file)

  current_time = get_current_time()
  current_location = get_current_location()

  security_level = calculate_current_security_level(data_lifecycle, current_time, current_location)

  if action == "backup":
    if security_level == "Confidential":
      backup_to_secure_remote_server(data_file, encryption=True)
    else:
      backup_to_standard_storage(data_file)

  if action == "share":
    authorized_devices = get_authorized_devices(security_level)
    if requesting_device in authorized_devices:
      transfer_data(requesting_device, data_file)
    else:
      deny_access()

  if action == "render":
    allowed_interfaces = get_allowed_output_interfaces(security_level, current_location)
    if requesting_interface in allowed_interfaces:
      render_data(requesting_interface, data_file)
    else:
      deny_access()
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Secure Element (SE) or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) on client devices to store cryptographic keys and enforce security policies.
*   Real-time location services (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons) for accurate location tracking.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Data Provenance Tracking:**  Log all data lifecycle events (creation, access, modifications, transfers) to provide a complete audit trail.
*   **Machine Learning-Based Policy Adaptation:**  Use machine learning to analyze data access patterns and automatically adjust lifecycle policies for optimal security and usability.
*   **Automated Decay Rate Assignment:**  Develop algorithms to automatically assign appropriate decay rates based on data sensitivity, industry regulations, and organizational policies.
