## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping for Personalized AEC

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic step-size control by incorporating a real-time acoustic environment map. Instead of *just* reacting to NSCC and signal strength, proactively *anticipate* changes in the acoustic environment based on detected spatial audio cues. This would allow for even faster convergence and better stability, especially in dynamic, multi-user environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4 microphones) integrated into the device. (Existing)
    *   Dedicated DSP or FPGA for real-time acoustic processing. (Existing, but may require upgrade for complexity)
    *   Optional: Low-resolution camera for visual environment mapping (supplementary, for static obstacle detection).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Spatial Audio Analyzer:** Processes microphone array input to determine the direction and proximity of sound sources. Algorithms: GCC-PHAT, MUSIC, or similar. Output: Azimuth, elevation, distance to dominant sound sources.
    *   **Acoustic Environment Mapper:**  Creates a probabilistic map of the acoustic environment. This map stores the likelihood of reflections originating from specific surfaces or locations.  Data structure: Octree or similar spatial partitioning. Update frequency: 10-20 Hz.
    *   **Reflection Prediction Engine:** Uses the acoustic environment map and the Spatial Audio Analyzer to *predict* potential reflections.  This module models how sound will propagate based on room geometry and material properties (estimated through machine learning - see below).
    *   **Adaptive Step-Size Controller:** (Modified from existing patent) â€“ Now incorporates the predicted reflection characteristics (strength, delay, frequency response) as inputs *in addition* to NSCC and signal strength.
    *   **Material Property Estimator (MLE):**  Machine Learning model (trained offline on a large dataset of acoustic measurements in different environments) to estimate the acoustic properties of surfaces (absorption, reflection coefficients) based on camera image data (optional) and audio analysis.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Microphone array captures audio.
    2.  Spatial Audio Analyzer determines sound source locations.
    3.  Acoustic Environment Mapper updates the probabilistic acoustic map.
    4.  Reflection Prediction Engine predicts potential reflections.
    5.  Adaptive Step-Size Controller calculates step sizes for each adaptive filter, factoring in predicted reflection characteristics.
    6.  AEC filters adjust based on calculated step sizes.
    7.  (Optional) Camera provides visual data for MLE to refine surface property estimates.
*   **Pseudocode (Adaptive Step-Size Calculation):**

```
function calculateStepSize(NSCC, signalStrength, predictedReflectionData):
    reflectionStrength = predictedReflectionData.strength
    reflectionDelay = predictedReflectionData.delay
    reflectionFrequencyResponse = predictedReflectionData.frequencyResponse

    scaleFactor = calculateScaleFactor(NSCC) // Existing logic from patent
    weight = calculateWeight(signalStrength) // Existing logic from patent

    // Adjust step size based on predicted reflections
    if reflectionStrength > threshold:
        stepSize = scaleFactor * weight * nominalStepSize * (1 + reflectionStrength)
    else:
        stepSize = scaleFactor * weight * nominalStepSize

    return stepSize
```

*   **Training Data Requirements:** Large dataset of acoustic measurements in diverse environments (rooms, cars, offices, etc.), labeled with room geometry, surface materials, and sound source positions.
*   **Computational Complexity:** High, requiring significant processing power. Optimization techniques (e.g., model quantization, pruning) may be necessary for real-time performance.
*   **Potential Applications:**  Enhanced AEC performance in conference calls, voice assistants, and immersive audio experiences, particularly in dynamic and noisy environments. Also useful for beamforming, source separation and virtual reality.
