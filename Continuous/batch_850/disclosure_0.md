## Adaptive Acoustic Calibration via Sonic Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the visual calibration methodology to include *auditory* calibration, creating a complete sensory profile of the display environment. This goes beyond basic speaker equalization; it dynamically maps the acoustic properties of the room and adjusts both visual and auditory outputs for optimal sensory experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Mobile device with integrated or connected high-frequency microphone array (minimum 8 mics).
    *   Existing display with integrated speakers or connected sound system.
    *   Optional: Dedicated ultrasonic emitter/receiver pair for room geometry mapping.
*   **Software - Core Modules:**
    *   **Sonic Mapping Engine:**  Utilizes the microphone array to analyze room acoustics (reverberation, reflections, frequency response) in 3D space.  The optional ultrasonic system assists with boundary detection.  Output: a dynamic acoustic map of the room.
    *   **Visual-Auditory Correlation Engine:**  Identifies the relationship between visual and auditory stimuli in the captured environment.  Example: bright scenes might increase perceived loudness, necessitating dynamic audio adjustment.
    *   **Calibration Profile Generator:** Creates a unified calibration profile containing both visual and auditory settings, tailored to the specific room and display setup.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment Module:**  Monitors ambient sound levels and visual content in real-time, applying adjustments to both display and audio outputs.
*   **Workflow (Pseudocode):**

```
INIT:
    1. User places mobile device facing display.
    2. System prompts user to initiate sonic mapping sequence.

SONIC MAPPING SEQUENCE:
    1. Mobile device emits short burst of calibrated sound.
    2. Microphone array captures reflections and reverberations.
    3.  Sonic Mapping Engine processes audio data:
        a. Calculates Room Transfer Function (RTF).
        b. Creates 3D acoustic map of the room (identifying surfaces, absorption coefficients).
    4.  Optional: Ultrasonic sweep for room geometry verification.

VISUAL-AUDITORY CORRELATION:
    1. Display a series of calibrated visual stimuli (varying brightness, color palettes).
    2. Simultaneously analyze ambient sound captured by the microphone array.
    3.  Identify correlation between visual stimuli and perceived sound changes.

CALIBRATION PROFILE GENERATION:
    1. Combine acoustic map, visual-auditory correlation data, and display/audio system characteristics.
    2.  Generate optimal visual settings (brightness, contrast, color balance).
    3.  Generate optimal audio settings (equalization, volume normalization, spatialization).

DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT LOOP:
    WHILE (System Running):
        1. Analyze ambient sound levels in real-time.
        2. Analyze visual content being displayed (brightness, color histograms).
        3.  Adjust display settings based on ambient sound and visual content.
        4.  Adjust audio settings based on ambient sound and visual content.
        5.  Loop

*   **Output:** A complete calibration profile stored on the mobile device and potentially synced to a cloud account. The profile can be applied to the display and audio system via wireless communication (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi).
*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Personalized Calibration:**  Learns user preferences over time.
    *   **Multi-User Support:** Stores multiple calibration profiles for different users.
    *   **Content-Aware Calibration:**  Adjusts settings based on the type of content being displayed (movies, games, sports).
    *   **Virtual Room Modeling:** Allows users to virtually ‘place’ the display in a different room to preview calibration settings.
