## Adaptive Subcomponent Virtualization

**Concept:** Extend the device shadowing concept to allow *virtual* subcomponents – representations of functionality that doesn’t currently exist on the physical device, but could be provisioned or emulated. This enables proactive adaptation and feature rollout without requiring immediate physical hardware changes.

**Specs:**

*   **Virtual Subcomponent Definition:** Introduce a “VirtualSubcomponentDescriptor” data structure. Fields include:
    *   `SubcomponentID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `VirtualizationType`: Enum (e.g., `Emulation`, `CloudProxy`, `FeatureFlag`).
    *   `RequiredHardware`: List of minimum hardware specifications to *eventually* support native implementation.
    *   `CloudServiceEndpoint`: URL for CloudProxy virtualization.
    *   `EmulationRules`: Ruleset for emulating functionality.
    *   `FeatureFlagKey`: Key for controlling feature availability via a feature flag service.
*   **Shadowing Service Extension:** Modify the shadowing service to handle `VirtualSubcomponentDescriptor` alongside physical subcomponent representations.
*   **State Management for Virtual Subcomponents:** Extend state management to include virtual subcomponents.  States can reflect emulation status, cloud proxy connection quality, or feature flag status.
*   **Dynamic Provisioning Trigger:** Implement a monitoring system that evaluates device hardware against `RequiredHardware` lists in `VirtualSubcomponentDescriptor` records.  When hardware meets requirements, automatically transition the virtual subcomponent to a native implementation.
*   **API Extension:** Add API calls to:
    *   `RegisterVirtualSubcomponent(DeviceID, VirtualSubcomponentDescriptor)`
    *   `GetVirtualSubcomponentState(DeviceID, SubcomponentID)`
    *   `ForceNativeImplementation(DeviceID, SubcomponentID)` – useful for testing.

**Pseudocode (Shadowing Service Adaptation):**

```
function UpdateSubcomponentState(deviceID, subcomponentID, newState):
    subcomponent = GetSubcomponentRepresentation(deviceID, subcomponentID)

    if subcomponent.isVirtual():
        if newState == "Provisioned":  //Hardware meets requirements
            //Transition to native implementation. Load drivers, configure hardware.
            subcomponent.setNative()
        else:
            //Maintain virtual state. Update emulation/cloud proxy connection.
            UpdateVirtualState(subcomponent, newState)
    else:
        //Native subcomponent - standard state update.
        RecordState(subcomponent, newState)

function UpdateVirtualState(subcomponent, newState):
    if subcomponent.VirtualizationType == "Emulation":
        ApplyEmulationRules(subcomponent, newState)
    elif subcomponent.VirtualizationType == "CloudProxy":
        EstablishCloudConnection(subcomponent)
        SendStateToCloud(subcomponent, newState)
    //Other Virtualization Types
```

**Innovation Focus:** Moves beyond simply *reflecting* device state to *shaping* device capability.  Enables “future-proofing” by allowing devices to respond to software updates even without immediate hardware upgrades. A device can signal that a feature *will* work, and prepare for its arrival, even if the hardware isn't there yet.
