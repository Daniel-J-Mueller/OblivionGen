## Dynamic Predictive Sizing for Multi-Tiered Data

**Concept:** Expand the sizing window concept to not just control the *number* of items considered for sorting, but to *predictively* populate tiered data structures â€“ effectively pre-computing and caching sort results at multiple granularities. This drastically reduces latency for complex, multi-attribute sorts, especially in dynamic environments.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Tiering:**

*   **Tier 1: Coarse Granularity (Summary Tier):**  A highly condensed representation of the data.  This tier might store pre-calculated aggregates (average price, max shipping cost, etc.) for each item, plus a primary sorting key (e.g., price). This tier is small and extremely fast to load/sort.
*   **Tier 2: Medium Granularity (Feature Tier):** Stores a subset of the full data, focusing on key features used for common sorts (price, rating, shipping). Includes more detailed data than Tier 1.  Sorted based on the Tier 1 key, then the attributes within this tier.
*   **Tier 3: Full Granularity (Detailed Tier):**  The complete dataset, used only when the user requires attributes not present in the upper tiers, or the number of items needing consideration falls outside the dynamically-sized windows.

**2. Dynamic Windowing & Prediction:**

*   **Initial Window (Tier 1):** Load a small initial window of Tier 1 data based on basic filtering (category, availability).
*   **User Interaction Monitoring:** Track user sort requests (price, rating, shipping).  Maintain a weighted history of these requests.
*   **Predictive Tier Loading:** Based on user history, *predict* the next likely sort criteria.  Pre-load and sort Tier 2 (or Tier 3) data for the predicted criteria *in the background*.
*   **Adaptive Window Size:** Calculate optimal window size for each tier based on:
    *   **Data Volume:**  Total number of items.
    *   **Sort Complexity:** Number of attributes used for sorting.
    *   **User Latency Threshold:** Acceptable delay for sort results.
    *   **Resource Availability:** CPU, memory, network bandwidth.
*   **Caching:**  Aggressively cache pre-sorted results at each tier.  Implement a cache invalidation strategy based on data changes (price updates, rating changes).

**3. Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function process_request(user_request, data_source):

  // 1. Load initial Tier 1 data
  tier1_data = load_tier1(data_source, user_request.filters)

  // 2. Predict next sort criteria based on user history
  predicted_sort_criteria = predict_sort(user_history)

  // 3. Load/Sort Tier 2 (or Tier 3) data in background
  if predicted_sort_criteria not in cache:
    background_task(load_and_sort_tier(data_source, predicted_sort_criteria))

  // 4. User requests a sort
  user_sort_criteria = user_request.sort

  // 5. Check if pre-sorted data exists
  if user_sort_criteria in cache:
    sorted_data = cache[user_sort_criteria]
  else:
    // 6. Sort the data (potentially using Tier 2/3)
    sorted_data = sort_data(tier1_data, user_sort_criteria) //fallback if no higher tier available
    //cache results

  return sorted_data

function background_task(task):
  //execute task in background thread
  execute(task)
  //cache the result
```

**4.  Data Structures:**

*   **Tiered Data Object:** Each item should be represented as a tiered data object, containing data at each tier.
*   **Cache:** A multi-level cache (L1, L2) to store pre-sorted results.
*   **User History:** A data structure to store user sort requests and frequency.

**5. API Endpoints:**

*   `/items?filters=[...]&sort=[...]`: Main endpoint for retrieving items.
*   `/history`: Endpoint for retrieving user sort history.

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond simply resizing a window of existing data. It proactively *pre-computes* and caches data at multiple granularities, anticipating user requests and dramatically reducing latency, especially in environments with high data volume and complex sorting requirements.  The tiered data structure and predictive loading are key differentiators.
