## Adaptive Aerodynamic Control Surfaces & Energy Harvesting

**System Overview:** Integrate small, dynamically morphing control surfaces *within* the propeller blades themselves, coupled with a refined energy harvesting system. These aren't traditional ailerons or flaps, but micro-actuated sections of the blade that change camber and angle of attack *during* free rotation, maximizing energy capture and providing limited directional control even with power loss.

**Core Innovation:** Move beyond simply *harvesting* energy from free rotation. *Actively control* the airflow over the blades to both increase energy harvest *and* provide a degree of steering during descent. 

**Specifications:**

*   **Blade Modification:** Each propeller blade will be segmented into 5-7 independently controlled sections. These sections will utilize a shape memory alloy (SMA) or electroactive polymer (EAP) matrix bonded to a lightweight core.
*   **Micro-Actuators:** Each segment will house a miniature, low-power linear actuator (piezoelectric or SMA-based) connected to the SMA/EAP matrix. Control signals will be sent wirelessly from the central flight controller (if functional) or a dedicated, isolated emergency power source.
*   **Emergency Power Source:** A small, solid-state battery (lithium-polymer or similar) will be dedicated *solely* to powering the morphing blade system. This ensures functionality even with complete failure of the main flight battery. Include a supercapacitor bank as well.
*   **Airflow Sensors:** Integrate miniature pitot-static tubes or hot-wire anemometers *within* each blade segment. These sensors will provide real-time airflow data to the control system, enabling adaptive control.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Initial Loss of Control):** System detects loss of power/uncontrolled descent. Enable free rotation and activate airflow sensors.
    *   **Phase 2 (Energy Harvesting):**  The control algorithm will maximize energy harvest from the free rotation by adjusting the camber and angle of attack of each blade segment. This leverages the asymmetry of airflow and optimizes rotational speed.
    *   **Phase 3 (Directional Control):** Utilize differential camber/angle of attack adjustments between blade segments to create a limited yaw and pitch moment. This will allow for minor course corrections during descent, potentially steering the UAV away from obstacles. Prioritize reducing descent rate.
*   **Energy Storage:** Dedicated capacitor and supercapacitor array, separate from flight power system.  Voltage regulation circuit manages charging/discharging.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy beacon to transmit diagnostic and flight data.
*   **Materials:** Lightweight carbon fiber composite for blade structure.  Flexible, durable EAP/SMA matrix.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
loop:
    read_airflow_sensors()
    calculate_optimal_camber_angle(airflow_data)
    calculate_differential_camber_angle(obstacle_detection_data)
    set_actuator_positions(optimal_camber_angle, differential_camber_angle)
    monitor_energy_storage_level()
    if energy_storage_level < threshold:
        reduce_actuator_activity() //Prioritize sustaining control
    end
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond passive energy harvesting and limited steering to create an *active aerodynamic* system that utilizes the propeller itself as a control surface *during* a failure scenario. Itâ€™s not about stopping the fall, but mitigating damage by slightly altering trajectory and maximizing available energy for deployment of other safety features (e.g., airbags, parachutes).
