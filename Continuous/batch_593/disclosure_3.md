## Adaptive Data Volume Sharding with Predictive Recovery

**Specification:** A system for dynamically sharding data volumes *before* recovery events, coupled with predictive recovery agent instantiation.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on *reacting* to recovery events with multiple agents. This specification proposes a proactive approach—sharding volumes based on access patterns and anticipated failure modes—to minimize recovery scope *and* accelerate agent responsiveness.

**Components:**

1.  **Volume Access Pattern Analyzer (VAPA):** Continuously monitors read/write access patterns for each data volume. It identifies:
    *   **Hotspots:** Frequently accessed data segments.
    *   **Coldspots:** Infrequently accessed data segments.
    *   **Access Correlations:** Data segments often accessed together.
    *   **Temporal Patterns:** Access frequency changes over time.

2.  **Predictive Failure Model (PFM):**  Utilizes historical data (hardware logs, system metrics, past failures) and machine learning to predict the likelihood of failure for individual storage nodes *and* data segments.  Factors include node age, disk utilization, error rates, and temperature.  Outputs a risk score for each segment.

3.  **Dynamic Sharding Engine (DSE):** Based on VAPA and PFM outputs, DSE dynamically shards data volumes.
    *   **Hotspot/Coldspot Separation:** Separates frequently and infrequently accessed data into separate shards.
    *   **Correlation-Based Sharding:**  Places correlated data segments within the same shard to minimize cross-shard transactions.
    *   **Risk-Aware Placement:** Distributes shards across storage nodes based on the PFM risk scores, prioritizing placement on more reliable nodes.
    *   **Automated Re-Sharding:** Periodically re-evaluates access patterns and risk scores, triggering re-sharding as needed.

4.  **Pre-Provisioned Recovery Agent Pool (PRAP):** Maintains a pool of pre-provisioned, lightweight recovery agents.  These agents are spun up *before* a recovery event, based on the predicted risk score for each shard. The number of agents per shard is proportional to the shard’s risk score and size.

5.  **Recovery Orchestrator (RO):** When a failure is detected:
    *   Identifies the affected shard(s).
    *   Activates the pre-provisioned recovery agents assigned to those shard(s).
    *   Orchestrates the recovery process, leveraging the shard's pre-existing agent pool.
    *   Minimizes recovery time by reducing agent provisioning overhead and recovery scope.



**Pseudocode (Recovery Orchestrator):**

```pseudocode
function on_failure_detected(shard_id, failure_node_id):
  // Retrieve pre-provisioned agents for the shard
  agents = PRAP.get_agents(shard_id)

  // Activate agents
  for agent in agents:
    agent.activate(shard_id, failure_node_id)

  // Orchestrate recovery (agent-specific logic)
  recovery_status = agent.recover_shard()

  // Report status
  report_recovery_status(shard_id, recovery_status)
end function
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shard Metadata:** Contains shard ID, size, list of data segments, assigned recovery agents, risk score, node placement.
*   **Agent Pool:** Map of shard ID to list of pre-provisioned recovery agents.

**Considerations:**

*   **Overhead:** Re-sharding introduces overhead. The frequency and granularity of re-sharding must be carefully tuned to minimize disruption.
*   **Consistency:** Maintaining consistency across shards requires robust synchronization mechanisms.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be scalable to handle a large number of data volumes and storage nodes.
