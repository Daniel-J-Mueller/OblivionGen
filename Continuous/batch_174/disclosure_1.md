**Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Biofeedback Integration**

**Concept:** Extend implicit target selection to dynamically create and adjust acoustic zones within an environment, shaped by both user voice commands *and* real-time physiological data (biofeedback) from the user(s). This goes beyond simply selecting devices; it actively sculpts the soundscape.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensors:** Integrate wearable sensors (smartwatch, headband, clothing) to capture physiological data: heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA – skin conductance), and potentially EEG (brainwave activity).  Data is transmitted wirelessly to a central processing unit.

2.  **Acoustic Zone Definition:** Define zones within the environment using a combination of:
    *   Device locations (existing speakers/audio outputs)
    *   Spatial mapping (using cameras/LiDAR for room geometry)
    *   User-defined virtual boundaries (via voice or app).

3.  **Real-Time Data Fusion:**  Combine voice command data with biofeedback data.  For example:
    *   *High EDA (stress):*  Automatically reduce volume in the user’s immediate zone, switch to calming ambient sounds, and prioritize sound direction *away* from the user.
    *   *Low HRV (relaxation):* Increase volume in the zone, switch to more dynamic audio, and enhance spatial effects.
    *   *Detected frustration in voice (speech analytics):* Mute all but essential audio notifications, and offer assistance via synthesized voice.

4.  **Dynamic Zone Adjustment:**
    *   Implement an algorithm to continuously adjust zone boundaries and audio parameters based on real-time data fusion. Zones "flex" and reshape based on user state and environment.
    *   Prioritize audio delivery to zones occupied by users exhibiting specific states (e.g., direct speech to a stressed user, directional music to a relaxed user).

5.  **Predictive Audio Shaping:**
    *   Use machine learning to predict user state changes based on historical data and current sensor readings.
    *   Preemptively adjust audio parameters to create a more seamless and personalized experience.

**Pseudocode (Zone Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION adjust_zones(speech_data, bio_data, environment_map)

  // 1. Analyze Speech Data
  command = analyze_speech(speech_data)
  target_device = determine_target_device(command)  // Existing Logic

  // 2. Analyze Biofeedback Data
  stress_level = calculate_stress(bio_data)
  relaxation_level = calculate_relaxation(bio_data)

  // 3. Determine Zone Priority
  IF stress_level > threshold THEN
    zone_priority = "calming"
    volume_reduction = 0.5  // Reduce volume by 50%
    sound_direction = "away"
  ELSE IF relaxation_level > threshold THEN
    zone_priority = "immersive"
    volume_increase = 0.3
    sound_direction = "direct"
  ELSE
    zone_priority = "neutral"

  // 4. Adjust Zone Parameters
  FOR each zone IN environment_map
    IF user IN zone THEN
      IF zone_priority == "calming" THEN
        zone.volume *= volume_reduction
        zone.sound_direction = sound_direction
        zone.audio_type = "ambient"
      ELSE IF zone_priority == "immersive" THEN
        zone.volume *= volume_increase
        zone.sound_direction = sound_direction
        zone.audio_type = "dynamic"
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  RETURN updated_environment_map
ENDFUNCTION
