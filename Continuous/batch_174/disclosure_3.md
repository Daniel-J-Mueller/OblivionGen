## Dynamic Projection Surface Material Control

**Concept:** Instead of *correcting* for the projection surface, actively *control* it. Embed micro-actuators and chromatic materials within the projection surface itself, responding to the projected image data to optimize color and contrast *at the source*.

**Specifications:**

*   **Projection Surface Composition:** Multi-layered material.
    *   **Base Layer:** Flexible substrate (e.g., a specialized polymer film).
    *   **Actuator Layer:** Grid of micro-actuators (MEMS or similar technology). Each actuator controls the angle/shape of a tiny reflective element.
    *   **Chromatic Layer:** Layer of micro-encapsulated dichroic or thermochromic materials. These materials change color based on electrical stimulation or temperature â€“ controlled by the actuators.
    *   **Protective Layer:** Transparent, durable coating.

*   **System Components:**
    *   **High-Resolution Camera:** Captures the projected image *on* the surface. Critical for feedback.
    *   **Image Processor:** Analyzes captured image data.
    *   **Control System:** Drives actuators and chromatic materials based on processed data.
    *   **Projector:** Standard projector, potentially modified for data transmission.

*   **Operational Pseudocode:**

```
LOOP:
    1.  Project initial image frame.
    2.  Capture image of projection surface with high-resolution camera.
    3.  Image Processor:
        a.  Analyze captured image data for color and contrast discrepancies.
        b.  Calculate optimal actuator and chromatic material settings for each micro-element on the surface.
        c.  Generate control signals for each micro-element.
    4.  Control System:
        a.  Transmit control signals to the projection surface.
        b.  Actuators adjust reflective element angles.
        c.  Chromatic materials adjust color.
    5.  Repeat from step 1.
```

*   **Actuator Control Strategy:**
    *   **Angle Adjustment:** Adjust the angle of the reflective elements to maximize light reflection toward the viewer, minimizing light loss due to surface irregularities or non-ideal viewing angles.
    *   **Chromatic Control:**
        *   **Color Compensation:** Actively compensate for color casts or imperfections in the projection surface material.
        *   **Contrast Enhancement:** Increase contrast by selectively adjusting the color of micro-elements to create a more vibrant and detailed image.
        *   **Dynamic Masking:** Implement a dynamic masking effect by controlling the color and reflectivity of micro-elements, effectively creating a high-contrast display without the need for traditional black levels.

*   **Data Transmission:**
    *   The projector will be able to transmit data to the projection surface.
    *   Wireless or wired communication.
    *   Data must include the intended image frame, as well as the specific settings for each micro-element.

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   High-end home theater
    *   Immersive gaming
    *   Advanced visualization
    *   Interactive displays

This isn't about *correcting* a passive surface. It's about building a *responsive* surface that actively participates in the image creation process.
