## Proximity-Based Dynamic Audio Zones

**Concept:** Leverage the proximity detection from the patent to create dynamically shifting audio zones, effectively ‘beamforming’ audio to follow a user’s movement *without* traditional directional speakers. Instead of a fixed link *between* devices, focus on creating individualized audio ‘bubbles’ within a larger space.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of low-power, spatially distributed microphone/speaker units (nodes). These nodes are *not* paired; they function as sensors and emitters within a mesh network.  Nodes are approximately palm-sized.
    *   Each node contains:
        *   Microphone array (minimum 4 elements) for accurate sound source localization.
        *   Small, full-range speaker.
        *   Ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for precise proximity detection (down to centimeters).
        *   Local processing unit (low-power ARM Cortex-M series).
        *   Power source (rechargeable battery or low-voltage power supply).
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Proximity Mapping:** Nodes continuously broadcast UWB signals and listen for responses from other nodes (and potentially wearable tags associated with users).  This creates a real-time map of node and user proximity.  Data is not necessarily centralized; local nodes perform initial processing.
    2.  **Audio Source Determination:**  A designated "source node" (e.g., user's phone or a dedicated audio server) initiates audio playback.
    3.  **Beamforming Simulation:** Instead of *directing* sound, the system calculates the optimal *gain* for each node's speaker based on the target user's location.  Nodes closest to the user play the audio at a higher volume, while distant nodes play at a significantly reduced volume.  This creates a localized ‘bubble’ of audio around the user. Algorithm utilizes inverse square law principles to refine gain calculation based on distance.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** As the user moves, the proximity map updates, and the gain calculations are adjusted in real-time. The system prioritizes minimizing audio spillover to other areas.
    5.  **Multi-User Support:** When multiple users are present, the system can create overlapping audio zones, potentially with individualized audio streams for each user.
    6. **Adaptive EQ:** Utilizing the microphone array data, the system will analyze the acoustic characteristics of the surrounding environment (e.g. reverberation, reflections) and apply real-time equalization to optimize the audio quality within the user's zone.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Mesh network using a low-power, reliable protocol (e.g., Thread or Zigbee).
    *   Nodes communicate proximity data and audio control signals.
    *   The source node streams the audio data.

**Pseudocode (Node Processing):**

```
LOOP:
  Receive UWB proximity signals from other nodes/tags.
  Calculate distance to each node/tag.
  Transmit UWB proximity signals.
  Receive audio control signal (gain level) from central controller.
  Receive audio stream (if designated as active emitter).
  Play audio at calculated gain level.
  Update local proximity map.
  Transmit updated proximity map data to neighbors.
ENDLOOP
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Open-plan offices:**  Private calls or focused listening without disturbing colleagues.
*   **Museums/Exhibits:**  Personalized audio guides that follow visitors as they move.
*   **Home entertainment:**  Immersive audio experience for individual viewers.
*   **Retail:** Targeted audio advertisements or product information to shoppers.
