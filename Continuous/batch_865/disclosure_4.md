**Secure Peripheral Authorization & Dynamic Capability Injection**

**Concept:** Expand the authenticator’s role beyond simple access control to include dynamic capability injection into the connected device. This allows the authenticator to not only *verify* it’s a trusted peripheral, but also *define* what capabilities the device grants it, beyond a simple ‘on/off’ switch for command acceptance. This creates a highly adaptable security profile.

**Specifications:**

*   **Authenticator Hardware:**
    *   Secure Element (SE) with cryptographic engine.
    *   Non-volatile memory for storing authentication keys, certificates, and *capability descriptors*.
    *   Physical interface (USB-C, Thunderbolt) for connection to host device.
*   **Capability Descriptor Format:** A standardized data structure defining the allowed operations.  Fields include:
    *   `Capability ID`: Unique identifier for a specific function (e.g., “Secure Erase”, “Data Encryption Key Exchange”, “Firmware Update”).
    *   `Access Level`:  Permissions (Read, Write, Execute).
    *   `Parameter Restrictions`: Allowed values/ranges for parameters required by the function.
    *   `Digital Signature`: Authenticates the capability descriptor.
*   **Host Device Implementation:**
    *   **Capability Broker:** Software component responsible for parsing capability descriptors and enforcing access control.
    *   **API Interception Layer:**  Intercepts calls to sensitive functions within the device.
    *   **Dynamic Function Binding:** Based on the capability descriptor, the interception layer dynamically enables/disables access to specific functions.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Connection & Authentication:** Authenticator connects to host device. Standard authentication protocol (as in the provided patent) is executed.
2.  **Capability Descriptor Exchange:** Upon successful authentication, the authenticator transmits its capability descriptor to the host device.
3.  **Capability Broker Processing:** The Capability Broker parses the descriptor and builds a runtime access control policy.
4.  **API Interception & Enforcement:** When an application attempts to call a sensitive function:
    *   The API Interception Layer intercepts the call.
    *   The Capability Broker checks if the requested function is permitted based on the active capability descriptor.
    *   If permitted, the call is allowed to proceed.  Otherwise, the call is blocked and an error is returned.

**Pseudocode (Capability Broker):**

```
function check_capability(function_name, parameters):
  capability = get_active_capability() // Retrieves descriptor from authenticator

  if capability == null:
    return false // No authenticator active

  allowed = capability.is_allowed(function_name, parameters)

  return allowed

function is_allowed(function_name, parameters):
    if function_name in capability.allowed_functions:
        //Validate parameters against restrictions
        if parameters_valid(parameters, capability.allowed_functions[function_name].restrictions):
            return true
        else:
            return false
    else:
        return false
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Capability Chaining:**  Allow multiple authenticators to contribute to a combined capability profile.
*   **Time-Limited Capabilities:**  Dynamically revoke capabilities after a certain period.
*   **Remote Capability Management:** Allow an administrator to remotely modify the capability profile of an authenticator.
