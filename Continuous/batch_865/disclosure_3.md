## Dynamic Inventory Re-Organization via Predictive Modeling & Robotic Swarm

**Concept:** Implement a predictive modeling system integrated with the floor plan generation and mobile drive unit control to proactively reorganize inventory within the storage blocks, optimizing for predicted future demand and minimizing travel time for retrieval. This moves beyond static floor plan optimization to *dynamic* inventory management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Demand Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical inventory data (SKU, quantity, location), real-time sales data (POS, online orders), external factors (seasonal trends, marketing campaigns, weather data – optional).
*   **Algorithm:** Hybrid time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) combined with machine learning regression models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict future demand for each SKU.  Model selection based on SKU-specific performance metrics (RMSE, MAE).
*   **Output:** Predicted demand for each SKU over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 24-72 hours).  Demand prioritized as 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'.

**2. Dynamic Storage Allocation Module:**

*   **Input:** Predicted demand data, current inventory levels, floor plan map (including storage block locations), mobile drive unit capabilities (payload, speed).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Hot/Cold Zoning:** Designate storage blocks as 'Hot' (High demand), 'Warm' (Medium demand), and 'Cold' (Low demand).
    *   **Proximity Optimization:** Prioritize relocating high-demand SKUs to storage blocks closest to inventory stations and frequently travelled paths.
    *   **Swarm Assignment:**  Divide relocation tasks into smaller units and assign them to a ‘swarm’ of mobile drive units. Algorithm must consider unit capabilities and prevent collisions.
    *   **Simulation:** Before executing any relocation, run a simulation to estimate travel time, resource utilization, and potential bottlenecks.  Adjust swarm assignment if necessary.
*   **Output:** Relocation Task List (SKU, source location, destination location, assigned mobile drive unit(s)).

**3. Robotic Swarm Control System:**

*   **Communication:** Mobile drive units communicate with a central controller via Wi-Fi/5G.
*   **Navigation:** Utilize floor plan map with fiducial marker tracking for precise navigation.
*   **Collision Avoidance:** Implement real-time sensor data (LiDAR, cameras) for dynamic obstacle detection and avoidance.
*   **Task Management:**
    *   Controller distributes tasks to individual mobile drive units.
    *   Units confirm task acceptance and report progress.
    *   Controller dynamically re-assigns tasks in case of unit failure or unexpected delays.
*   **Synchronization:** Implement a time-stamping system and synchronization protocol to prevent bottlenecks and ensure efficient swarm operation.

**4. Floor Plan Integration & Update:**

*   **Dynamic Map Generation:** System must be capable of generating updated floor plan maps in real-time to reflect inventory re-organization.
*   **Fiducial Marker Management:** System must track the location of fiducial markers and update the map accordingly.
*   **Map Distribution:** Updated maps are distributed to all mobile drive units and the central controller.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Assignment):**

```
function assign_swarm_tasks(relocation_tasks, mobile_drive_units):
    // Calculate cost matrix: distance to source/destination + payload capacity
    cost_matrix = calculate_cost_matrix(relocation_tasks, mobile_drive_units)

    // Use assignment algorithm (Hungarian Algorithm, Linear Sum Assignment)
    assignment = linear_sum_assignment(cost_matrix)

    // Create task list for each mobile drive unit
    for (unit_index, task_index) in assignment:
        if task_index is not None:
            mobile_drive_units[unit_index].add_task(relocation_tasks[task_index])

    //Simulate task execution to check validity and refine assignments if necessary
    simulation_results = simulate_task_execution(mobile_drive_units)
    if simulation_results.conflicts == True:
        //recalculate assignment with higher penalty values for conflicting tasks
        assign_swarm_tasks(relocation_tasks, mobile_drive_units)

    return mobile_drive_units
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance server for running predictive models and task management.
*   Robust Wi-Fi/5G network infrastructure.
*   Mobile drive units equipped with LiDAR, cameras, and robust navigation systems.
*   Fiducial markers with high visibility and durability.
