## Dynamic Interrupt Prioritization via MMIO & Queue Metadata

**Concept:** Expand the MMIO transaction capabilities to include not just interrupt unmasking/delay, but *dynamic interrupt prioritization*. The network device will maintain metadata *within* the completion queue entries (CQEs) themselves, indicating the relative importance of the completed packet. The host, upon processing a CQE, will use this metadata to dynamically adjust interrupt priorities on the fly.

**Specification:**

*   **CQE Metadata Field:** Add a 4-bit field to each CQE, designated "Interrupt Priority Level" (IPL). Values 0-15 represent increasing levels of importance. '0' is lowest, '15' is critical.
*   **MMIO Transaction Extension:** The existing MMIO transaction for completion queue updates will be extended with a "Priority Update Enable" (PUE) flag. When PUE is set, the host acknowledges that it will actively respond to IPL values.
*   **Host-Side Interrupt Priority Manager:**
    *   The host OS will include an interrupt priority manager component specifically for network device interrupts.
    *   Upon receiving a CQE with PUE set, the manager reads the IPL field.
    *   Based on IPL, the manager dynamically adjusts the priority of the network device's interrupt line.  A mapping table will define the relationship between IPL values and actual interrupt priority levels.
    *   The manager monitors interrupt latency. If an interrupt from the device is consistently delayed despite high priority, it logs the event for debugging.
*   **Device-Side IPL Assignment:** The network device's processing logic will determine IPL based on packet type, source/destination address, or application-specific requirements.  Examples:
    *   Real-time traffic (VoIP, video conferencing): High IPL.
    *   Control plane packets (routing updates): Medium IPL.
    *   Bulk data transfer: Low IPL.
*   **Default IPL:** If PUE is not set in the MMIO transaction, or the host does not implement the IPL manager, the device will use a fixed default IPL for all interrupts.

**Pseudocode (Host-Side Interrupt Manager):**

```
function process_CQE(CQE):
  if CQE.PUE == 1:
    IPL = CQE.IPL
    priority_level = map_IPL_to_priority(IPL) // Lookup table
    set_interrupt_priority(network_device_interrupt_line, priority_level)
    monitor_interrupt_latency(network_device_interrupt_line)
  else:
    // Use default interrupt priority
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Minor adjustments to the bus interface to accommodate the extended MMIO transaction.
*   Sufficient SRAM within the network device to store the IPL metadata alongside each CQE.
*   Possible DMA optimizations to efficiently transfer the IPL metadata along with the CQE data.
