## Adaptive Queue Weighting Based on Real-Time Sentiment Analysis

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the weighting of individual queues within the forecasting model based on real-time sentiment analysis of customer interactions *before* they even reach the queue. This anticipates shifts in contact drivers and refines prediction accuracy beyond historical volume/handling time.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Integrate with existing speech/text analytics platforms that provide real-time sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) for incoming contacts *prior to queue assignment*. This could involve analyzing IVR selections, initial chatbot interactions, or pre-queue survey responses.
*   **Sentiment Bucketing:** Categorize sentiment scores into predefined buckets (e.g., Highly Positive, Positive, Neutral, Negative, Highly Negative).
*   **Dynamic Weight Assignment:** Implement a weighting algorithm that adjusts the contribution of each queue to the overall forecasting model based on the *current distribution* of sentiment scores.
    *   High proportion of 'Negative' sentiment -> Increased weight for queues handling escalations/complaints.
    *   High proportion of 'Positive' sentiment -> Increased weight for queues handling proactive support/sales.
*   **Forecasting Integration:** Modify the existing machine learning models to accept a ‘sentiment weight vector’ as an input feature. This vector represents the current distribution of sentiment across all queues.
*   **Model Retraining:** Regularly retrain the models with historical data that *includes* the sentiment scores, enabling the model to learn the relationship between sentiment, queue demand, and handling times.
*   **Alerting System:** Implement an alerting mechanism that triggers if sentiment distribution deviates significantly from historical norms, indicating a potential shift in contact drivers or a developing customer service issue.

**Pseudocode (Weight Calculation):**

```
// Input: Current sentiment distribution across queues (sentiment_distribution)
//        Historical average sentiment distribution (historical_avg)
//        Weighting factor (alpha) – controls sensitivity to sentiment changes

function calculate_queue_weights(sentiment_distribution, historical_avg, alpha):
    weights = {}
    for queue in queues:
        // Calculate sentiment difference
        sentiment_diff = sentiment_distribution[queue] - historical_avg[queue]

        // Calculate weight adjustment based on difference and alpha
        weight_adjustment = alpha * sentiment_diff

        // Apply adjustment to base weight (e.g., equal weights initially)
        weights[queue] = 1.0 + weight_adjustment

    // Normalize weights to sum to 1.0
    total_weight = sum(weights.values())
    for queue in queues:
        weights[queue] /= total_weight

    return weights
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sufficient processing power to perform real-time sentiment analysis and weight calculations.
*   Low-latency network connection to ingest sentiment data from analytics platforms.
*   Scalable infrastructure to handle increasing volumes of contacts and data.
