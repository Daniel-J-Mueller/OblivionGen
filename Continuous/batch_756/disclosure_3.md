## Adaptive Pre-Charge & Wireless Power Transfer System

**Concept:** Expand the pre-charge concept to incorporate wireless power transfer (WPT) *during* the pre-charge phase, and adapt the pre-charge resistance dynamically based on detected battery characteristics and energy harvesting potential.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Battery Compartment:** Modified to include a WPT coil aligned with the battery terminals when the battery is partially inserted (pre-charge position).
*   **Charging Circuitry:**  A combined pre-charge/WPT receiver circuit. This circuit intelligently switches between resistive pre-charge (via the existing system) and WPT reception.
*   **Dynamic Resistance Control:** A microcontroller-controlled switching network to dynamically adjust the pre-charge resistance. This network provides discrete resistance values, but could be extended to analog control.
*   **Energy Harvesting Module:** Integrated piezoelectric or inductive energy harvesting module to capture ambient vibrations or RF energy.  Harvested energy feeds directly into the pre-charge circuit.
*   **Battery Characterization Module:**  Basic impedance spectroscopy or voltage/current monitoring during the initial insertion phase to estimate battery capacity, internal resistance, and state of charge.
*   **Mechanical Linkage:**  Refined mechanical linkage for reliable contact with both the resistive pre-charge terminals *and* WPT coil during the pre-charge phase.

**2. Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Insertion & Initial Contact:** Battery is inserted, making initial contact with the pre-charge terminals and aligning with the WPT coil.
2.  **Battery Characterization:** Battery Characterization Module assesses battery properties.
3.  **Dynamic Pre-Charge Adjustment:** Based on the characterization data, the microcontroller sets the initial pre-charge resistance. Lower resistance for nearly depleted batteries; higher resistance for batteries with some charge.
4.  **Hybrid Charging:**  The microcontroller simultaneously activates both the resistive pre-charge and WPT receiver.  WPT provides a trickle charge supplementing the resistive pre-charge. Energy harvesting module boosts WPT or resistive pre-charge.
5.  **Adaptive Control:** The microcontroller monitors battery voltage and current during the pre-charge phase. It dynamically adjusts the pre-charge resistance and WPT/harvesting contribution to optimize charging speed and minimize heat generation.
6.  **Full Insertion & Switchover:** Once the battery is fully inserted, the mechanical linkage closes the final power switch, bypassing the pre-charge circuit and connecting the battery directly to the main power system.

**3. Hardware Components:**

*   **WPT Coil:** Planar or helical coil optimized for the battery compartment geometry and operating frequency (e.g., 6.78 MHz, Qi standard).
*   **WPT Receiver:**  Rectifier and voltage regulator to convert the received WPT energy into a DC voltage suitable for charging the battery.
*   **Microcontroller:**  Low-power ARM Cortex-M series microcontroller with ADC, PWM, and communication interfaces.
*   **Switching Network:**  Array of discrete resistors controlled by MOSFET switches.
*   **Energy Harvesting Module:**  Piezoelectric generator, inductive coil, or RF energy harvester.
*   **Mechanical Linkage:** Precision-engineered mechanical components for reliable contact and switch activation.

```pseudocode

enable_energy_harvesting()

// Main Loop
while (battery_not_fully_inserted) {

  battery_current = read_ADC(battery_current_pin)

  } else if (battery_voltage > threshold_high) {
    precharge_resistance = high_resistance
  } else {
    precharge_resistance = medium_resistance
  }

  set_precharge_resistance(precharge_resistance)

  // Monitor current and voltage for safety limits
  if (battery_current > current_limit) {
    reduce_precharge_resistance()
  }

  // Adjust WPT power based on available energy
  WPT_power = harvested_energy + external_WPT
  set_WPT_power(WPT_power)

  delay(10ms)
}

// Battery fully inserted, bypass pre-charge circuit
enable_main_power()
```

**5. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Wireless Communication:** Integrate a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module for remote monitoring of battery status and pre-charge progress.
*   **Machine Learning:** Implement a machine learning algorithm to predict battery health and optimize the pre-charge strategy based on historical data.
*   **Thermal Management:** Incorporate a thermal sensor and fan to prevent overheating during pre-charge.
