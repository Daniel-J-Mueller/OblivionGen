## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Thread Migration

**Concept:** Extend the multi-threaded verification by introducing dynamic data sharding and predictive thread migration based on node access patterns. This moves beyond static work queues to a system where data is proactively moved *to* the threads most likely to need it, minimizing contention and maximizing parallel processing.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sharding Module:**

*   **Function:** Divides the hierarchical data structure into shards based on key ranges or sub-tree structure.  Shards are not fixed; their boundaries dynamically shift based on access patterns.
*   **Implementation:**  A ‘Shard Manager’ component responsible for:
    *   Monitoring node access times.
    *   Identifying frequently accessed node clusters.
    *   Dynamically splitting/merging shards to optimize access locality.
    *   Maintaining a shard-to-thread affinity map (explained in Thread Migration).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Shard`: Represents a contiguous portion of the hierarchical data structure. Contains:
        *   `keyRangeStart`: Lower bound of the shard's key range.
        *   `keyRangeEnd`: Upper bound of the shard's key range.
        *   `nodes`:  Pointer to the underlying nodes contained within the shard.
        *   `accessCount`: Integer representing the number of access attempts to nodes in this shard.
        *   `lastAccessTime`: Timestamp of the last access.
    *   `ShardMap`: A hash map storing shard keys to shard objects.

**2. Predictive Thread Migration:**

*   **Function:**  Predicts which threads will need specific shards based on hierarchical traversal patterns. Proactively moves data to those threads’ local memory to minimize network latency and contention.
*   **Implementation:** A ‘Thread Predictor’ component that:
    *   **Traversal Pattern Analysis:** Monitors thread access patterns to identify common traversal paths (e.g., descending from root, traversing sibling nodes).
    *   **Predictive Model:**  Uses a Markov Chain model to predict the next node a thread is likely to access based on its current node and historical access patterns.  This doesn’t need to be perfect; even a probabilistic prediction can improve performance.
    *   **Data Prefetching:**  When the predictor determines a thread will likely need a shard *not* currently in its local memory, a prefetch request is sent to the Shard Manager.
    *   **Thread Affinity:**  Maintain a "thread affinity" map assigning threads to specific shards.  Threads are preferentially assigned shards they access most frequently.

**3. Work Unit Generation Modification:**

*   Instead of generating work units from the root down, the system generates work units from shards assigned to threads.
*   Each thread processes only shards assigned to it.
*   Work units encapsulate not just node data, but also a *shard ID*.

**Pseudocode (Thread Execution):**

```
function thread_execute() {
  while (running) {
    shard_id = get_assigned_shard()
    work_unit = get_work_unit(shard_id)
    if (work_unit == null) {
      // No work for this shard - sleep or check for new work
      sleep(1ms)
      continue
    }
    node = work_unit.node
    key = work_unit.key

    // Perform verification/processing on node and key

    child_nodes = get_child_nodes(node)

    for each child in child_nodes {
      // Generate work unit for child node, associated with this thread’s shard
      child_work_unit = create_work_unit(child)
      add_work_unit_to_queue(child_work_unit)
    }
  }
}
```

**4.  Dynamic Shard Resizing:**

*   Implement a background process to monitor shard sizes and access patterns.
*   If a shard becomes excessively large or access patterns change significantly, dynamically split or merge shards to maintain optimal balance.
*   Shard merging should prioritize combining shards assigned to the same thread to improve locality.

**5.  Memory Management:**

*   Employ a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache within each thread to store frequently accessed node data.
*   Implement a garbage collection mechanism to remove unused data from the cache.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced contention for shared data.
*   Improved thread utilization.
*   Lower latency for data access.
*   Enhanced scalability for large hierarchical data structures.
