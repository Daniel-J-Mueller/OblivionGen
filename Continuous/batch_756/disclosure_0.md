## Dynamic Page Component Orchestration via Declarative Dependency Graphs

**Specification:** A system for managing and rendering dynamic page components based on a declarative dependency graph, shifting away from direct service calls within page generation code.

**Core Concept:** Instead of the page code directly requesting data, we define a graph of component dependencies. Each node in the graph represents a component that requires data. Edges represent data dependencies â€“ what data a component needs from other components or data sources.

**Components:**

*   **Dependency Graph Builder:** A service that accepts component definitions (name, required data keys) and external data source definitions. It constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing data flow.
*   **Data Source Adapters:** Pluggable modules responsible for fetching data from various sources (databases, APIs, files, etc.).  Each adapter registers itself with the Dependency Graph Builder, identifying the data keys it can provide.
*   **Orchestration Engine:**  Traverses the dependency graph.  For each component, it determines the necessary data, identifies the data source adapters that can provide it, and initiates data requests. The engine handles concurrency and caching to optimize performance.
*   **Component Renderer:**  Receives fully resolved data for a component and renders it into the appropriate format (HTML, JSON, etc.).

**Data Flow:**

1.  Page request received.
2.  Page definition (listing required components) is loaded.
3.  Dependency Graph Builder constructs the DAG based on component dependencies and registered data source adapters.
4.  Orchestration Engine traverses the graph, triggering data requests from adapters.
5.  Adapters fetch and return data to the Orchestration Engine.
6.  The Orchestration Engine resolves data dependencies and passes fully resolved data to the Component Renderer.
7.  Component Renderer renders the page and returns it to the client.

**Pseudocode (Orchestration Engine - simplified):**

```pseudocode
function orchestrate(componentGraph):
  resolvedData = {}
  queue = componentGraph.getRoots() // Get starting nodes with no dependencies

  while queue is not empty:
    component = queue.dequeue()
    
    if component.data is not null:
      continue // Data already resolved

    component.data = fetchData(component.dependencies)

    for dependent in component.dependents:
      queue.enqueue(dependent)

  return componentGraph
  
function fetchData(dependencies):
  // Iterate through dependencies
  // For each dependency, find the appropriate data source adapter
  // Request data from the adapter
  // Return combined data
```

**Innovation:** 

This moves the data fetching *entirely* out of the page generation code.  Pages become declarative specifications of *what* they need, not *how* to get it.  

This enables:

*   **Centralized Data Management:** A single point of control for data access and security.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:**  Easily swap data sources or modify data retrieval logic without changing page code.
*   **Improved Caching:** The Orchestration Engine can intelligently cache data at various levels.
*   **Testability:** Pages become simpler to test, as they no longer contain data access logic.
*   **Scalability:**  The Orchestration Engine can be scaled independently of the page generation code.
*   **Realtime updates:** Data sources may push updates to the orchestration engine which cascade down to the end components as needed.

This is *not* just a caching layer. It's a fundamental shift in how dynamic pages are constructed and served.  It decouples content from presentation *and* data access, making the entire system more flexible and robust.
