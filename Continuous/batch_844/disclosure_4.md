## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Filtering

**Concept:** Expand beyond content filtering based on stated preferences (genre, keywords) to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of both the content *and* the user, dynamically adjusting the presented content stream to maintain an optimal emotional "resonance."

**Specs:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Emotional Analysis Engine (Content):**
    *   **Input:** Video/Audio stream.
    *   **Process:** Utilizes multimodal AI (Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Audio Analysis) to identify emotional cues *within* the content.  Detects facial expressions, tone of voice, language sentiment, scene composition, and musical cues. Outputs an "Emotional Profile" – a vector representing the dominant emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutrality) and their intensities.
    *   **Output:** Emotional Profile (vector).

*   **User State Sensor:**
    *   **Input:**  Multiple data streams:
        *   Wearable biometric data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle activity via EMG, brainwave activity via EEG – *optional, for advanced implementations*).
        *   Camera input for facial expression analysis.
        *   Keyboard/Controller input patterns (e.g., rapid clicking indicating excitement, slow/deliberate input indicating contemplation).
        *   Voice analysis (tone, pace, volume).
    *   **Process:** Integrates data from multiple sources to estimate the user’s current emotional state. Applies machine learning models trained on correlating biometric data, facial expressions, and behavior with self-reported emotional states.
    *   **Output:** User Emotional Profile (vector).

*   **Resonance Algorithm:**
    *   **Input:** Content Emotional Profile, User Emotional Profile, User Preference Profile (existing from the base patent), Resonance Target Profile (adjustable – see ‘II. Resonance Profiles’)
    *   **Process:**
        1.  **Emotional Distance Calculation:** Determines the "emotional distance" between the Content Emotional Profile and the User Emotional Profile using a weighted vector distance metric (Euclidean, Cosine Similarity).
        2.  **Resonance Score Calculation:** Compares the calculated Emotional Distance to the Resonance Target Profile.  The Resonance Target Profile defines acceptable ranges of Emotional Distance for different emotional states. The Resonance Score quantifies how well the content "resonates" with the user’s current emotional state.
        3.  **Content Selection/Adjustment:** Based on the Resonance Score:
            *   **High Resonance:** The content is deemed suitable and continues to play.
            *   **Low Resonance:**  The system selects alternative content from the stream based on a prioritized search (matching keywords, genre, etc.) with the aim of improving the Resonance Score.  *Dynamic Adjustment* options:
                *   **Scene Skipping:**  Identify and skip emotionally dissonant scenes within the current content.
                *   **Content Blending:**  Transition smoothly to alternative content with a similar emotional tone.
                *   **Tempo/Intensity Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjust the playback speed or audio volume to subtly shift the emotional impact.
*   **Learning Module:** Collects data on user interactions (pauses, skips, ratings, biometric responses) to refine the Resonance Algorithm and improve its accuracy over time.

**II. Resonance Profiles:**

*   **Neutral Resonance:**  Content that is emotionally balanced and avoids strong emotional stimuli. Useful for relaxation or background viewing.
*   **Positive Resonance:**  Content that evokes joy, excitement, or amusement. Useful for boosting mood or entertainment.
*   **Empathic Resonance:**  Content that mirrors the user's emotional state (e.g., sad content for a sad user). Useful for emotional validation or catharsis.
*   **Challenge Resonance:** Content which evokes a mix of emotions in order to engage the user with a richer emotional experience.

**III. Pseudocode – Resonance Algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateResonanceScore(content_profile, user_profile, target_profile):

    emotional_distance = CalculateEmotionalDistance(content_profile, user_profile)

    // Define acceptable ranges in the target_profile
    acceptable_distance_range = target_profile.acceptable_distance

    IF emotional_distance <= acceptable_distance_range:
        resonance_score = 100 // Perfect Resonance
    ELSE:
        resonance_score = 100 - (emotional_distance - acceptable_distance_range) * weight_factor

    RETURN resonance_score

FUNCTION SelectContent():
    candidate_contents = [content1, content2, content3...]
    best_content = NULL
    best_resonance_score = 0

    FOR content IN candidate_contents:
        resonance_score = CalculateResonanceScore(content.emotional_profile, user.emotional_profile, user.resonance_target)

        IF resonance_score > best_resonance_score:
            best_resonance_score = resonance_score
            best_content = content

    RETURN best_content
```

**IV. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution camera for facial expression analysis.
*   Wearable sensors (heart rate, skin conductance, EMG, EEG – *optional*).
*   Powerful processing unit for real-time emotional analysis.
*   High-bandwidth network connection for streaming content.

**V. Novelty:**  This system moves beyond passive content filtering based on stated preferences to *actively* adapt the content stream in real-time based on a dynamic assessment of the user’s emotional state.  The Resonance Algorithm and Resonance Profiles introduce a new level of personalization and emotional engagement.
