## Dynamic Scene Graph Integration for Predictive Skipping & Content Modification

**Concept:** Extend the frame and video-level classification with a dynamic scene graph that models object interactions and activity recognition *within* the video. This graph isn't static; it’s built and updated in real-time alongside the classification scores, and used to *predict* likely mature content *before* it fully manifests in a frame, enabling more proactive content modification beyond simple skipping.

**Specs:**

1.  **Scene Graph Construction Module:**
    *   Input: Video Frames, Frame-Level Classification Scores (from existing patent), Audio features.
    *   Process:
        *   **Object Detection:** Employ a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) to identify key objects in each frame (people, weapons, suggestive items, locations).
        *   **Activity Recognition:** Use a temporal action detection model (e.g., based on LSTM or Transformers) to identify actions being performed by/with those objects (e.g., "person approaching," "object being handled," "violent gesture").
        *   **Relationship Inference:** Establish relationships between objects and actions based on spatial proximity, co-occurrence, and action targets. (e.g., "Person A is handing Object B to Person C").
        *   **Graph Representation:**  Represent the scene as a dynamic graph where:
            *   Nodes: Represent objects, people, and actions.
            *   Edges: Represent relationships between nodes (e.g., “is near,” “is holding,” “is looking at”). Edges have weighted values reflecting the strength of the relationship.
    *   Output:  Dynamic Scene Graph (DSG) representing the current frame and its context.

2.  **Predictive Content Assessment Module:**
    *   Input: DSG, Frame-Level Classification Scores, Video-Level Classification Scores.
    *   Process:
        *   **Risk Propagation:**  Propagate risk scores (derived from classification) *through* the DSG. For example:
            *   If “Person A” is flagged as engaging in risky behavior, the risk score propagates to objects they are interacting with.
            *   The DSG identifies potential escalation scenarios (e.g., "Person A is approaching Person B with a weapon").
        *   **Temporal Reasoning:**  Use the DSG and temporal action detection to *predict* likely future content. This involves analyzing action sequences and potential outcomes. (e.g., if “Person A is winding up to punch” the system predicts a high probability of a violent act in the next frame(s)).
        *   **Predictive Risk Score:** Generate a "Predictive Risk Score" for each frame/scene based on the propagated risk, temporal reasoning, and potential escalation scenarios.
    *   Output: Predictive Risk Score for current and future frames.

3.  **Dynamic Content Modification Module:**
    *   Input: Predictive Risk Score, User Preferences (skip/blur/modify), Scene Boundaries.
    *   Process:
        *   **Adaptive Modification:** Based on the Predictive Risk Score and user preferences, apply different modification techniques:
            *   **Preemptive Skipping:** Skip entire scenes *before* the mature content fully appears.
            *   **Targeted Blurring/Pixelation:** Blur or pixelate specific objects/regions identified as potentially problematic in the Predictive Risk Score.
            *   **Content Replacement:**  Replace problematic content with alternative, benign content (e.g., replace a weapon with a harmless object).
            *   **Style Transfer:** Apply style transfer techniques to alter the aesthetic of a scene, reducing its problematic nature (e.g., making a violent scene appear cartoonish).
        *   **Seamless Integration:**  Ensure that modifications are applied seamlessly to maintain video flow and avoid jarring transitions.
    *   Output: Modified Video Stream.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Content Assessment):**

```
function assess_predictive_risk(DSG, frame_classification, video_classification):
  risk_score = 0

  # Propagate risk from frame classification through DSG
  for node in DSG.nodes:
    if node.type == "person" and frame_classification[node.id] > threshold:
      risk_score += frame_classification[node.id] * DSG.edge_weight(node, "interaction")

  # Temporal Reasoning – check for potential escalation scenarios
  if DSG.has_action("approaching") and DSG.has_object("weapon"):
    risk_score += escalation_factor

  # Combine with video-level classification for context
  risk_score = risk_score * video_classification

  return risk_score
```

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond reactive content filtering to *proactive* modification based on predicted content, enhancing user control and creating a more adaptable and nuanced filtering experience.  Integrates a dynamic scene graph, opening opportunities for sophisticated analysis of complex video content.
