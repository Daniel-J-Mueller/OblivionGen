## Dynamic Light Diffusion with Bio-Mimicry

**Concept:** A flood light incorporating a dynamic diffusion layer inspired by chromatophores found in cephalopods (squid, octopus). This allows for programmable light scattering, creating adaptable illumination patterns beyond simple intensity control.

**Specs:**

*   **Diffusion Layer:** Composed of microfluidic channels containing a suspension of micro-scale, light-scattering particles (e.g., titanium dioxide, silica).  Particle concentration & distribution within the channels are controlled via micro-pumps.
*   **Channel Architecture:**  Array of interconnected, hexagonal microfluidic channels.  Hexagonal layout maximizes packing density and allows for uniform diffusion. Channel dimensions: 50-100μm width, 20-50μm depth.  Spacing between channels: 10-20μm.
*   **Actuation System:**  Array of micro-pumps (MEMS-based piezoelectric or electrokinetic pumps) directly integrated with the microfluidic channels.  Each pump controls the flow rate within its associated channel.  Minimum pump resolution: 1μL/minute.
*   **Control System:**  Embedded microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M series) with dedicated digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for controlling pump voltages. Communication interface: Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for external control & pre-programmed patterns.
*   **Light Source Integration:**  High-intensity LED array positioned behind the diffusion layer.  LED wavelengths: RGB + UV (for specialized applications).  LED spacing: 5mm.
*   **Housing Material:**  Thermally conductive polymer (e.g., polycarbonate) with integrated heat sink.  Waterproof rating: IP67.
*   **Power Supply:**  Universal AC input (100-240V) with DC output (12V/5A).

**Operation:**

1.  The LED array illuminates the microfluidic diffusion layer.
2.  The control system activates micro-pumps, increasing or decreasing the concentration of light-scattering particles within specific channels.
3.  Localized changes in particle concentration alter the scattering of light, creating dynamic patterns.
4.  Patterns can be pre-programmed (e.g., slow color cycling, pulsating beam) or controlled in real-time via external communication.
5.  The UV LEDs can be pulsed for sterilization or used to activate fluorescent materials.

**Pseudocode for Pattern Generation:**

```
// Define channel map (2D array representing microfluidic channel layout)
channelMap[ROWS][COLS]

// Function to set pump rate for specific channel
function setPumpRate(row, col, rate) {
    channelMap[row][col].pump.setRate(rate)
}

// Pre-defined patterns:
pattern_wave() {
    for (i = 0; i < COLS; i++) {
        setPumpRate(0, i, MAX_RATE) // Activate channels in first row, moving across
        delay(50ms)
        setPumpRate(0, i, 0) // Deactivate channel
    }
    // Repeat for other rows, creating wave effect
}

pattern_pulse(row, col) {
  setPumpRate(row, col, MAX_RATE);
  delay(100ms);
  setPumpRate(row, col, 0);
  delay(200ms);
}

// Main loop
loop {
  // User input or pre-programmed sequence
  if (pattern == "wave") {
    pattern_wave()
  } else if (pattern == "pulse") {
      pattern_pulse(rand(ROWS), rand(COLS))
  } else {
    // Default: All channels at a constant rate
    for (i = 0; i < ROWS; i++) {
      for (j = 0; j < COLS; j++) {
        setPumpRate(i, j, DEFAULT_RATE)
      }
    }
  }
}

```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Architectural lighting with dynamic ambient effects.
*   Security lighting with adaptive beam patterns.
*   Signage and displays with programmable light animations.
*   Emergency lighting with attention-grabbing signals.
*   Agricultural lighting to optimize plant growth with variable spectra.
