## Aerial Vehicle Swarm Acoustic Mapping & Predictive Collision Avoidance

**System Overview:** A distributed acoustic sensing network deployed across a swarm of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for high-resolution environmental mapping and proactive collision avoidance, leveraging phased array acoustic beamforming and predictive trajectory modeling.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **UAV Platform:** Small-form-factor UAVs (approx. 200-500g) with integrated flight controller, GPS, IMU, and wireless communication module (802.11ax). Payload capacity: 100g.
*   **Acoustic Transducer Array:** Each UAV equipped with a circular array of 64 micro-machined ultrasonic transducers (MUTs) operating at 40-60 kHz. Each MUT individually addressable. MUT diameter: 3mm, spacing: 5mm.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded ARM Cortex-A72 quad-core processor with dedicated DSP for real-time signal processing. 8GB RAM, 64GB Flash storage.
*   **Power System:** 3S LiPo battery (2200mAh) providing 20-30 minutes of flight time.
*   **Communication:** Dedicated short-range (up to 500m) low-latency communication channel between UAVs for data synchronization and cooperative processing.
*   **Ground Station:** High-performance computing server for central data aggregation, visualization, and predictive modeling.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Distributed Beamforming Module:**
    *   Algorithm: Delay-and-sum beamforming with adaptive weighting based on signal-to-noise ratio (SNR).
    *   Beam Steering: Electronic beam steering allowing for 360Â° coverage.
    *   Resolution: Target resolution of 1cm at a range of 5m.
    *   Implementation: Parallelized processing across UAVs, each responsible for a portion of the acoustic scene.

2.  **Cooperative Localization Module:**
    *   Algorithm: Triangulation and multilateration using time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) measurements between UAVs.
    *   Synchronization: Precise time synchronization using network time protocol (NTP) and Kalman filtering.
    *   Accuracy: Achieve centimeter-level localization accuracy.

3.  **Object Detection and Classification Module:**
    *   Algorithm: Convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a dataset of acoustic signatures of various objects (e.g., trees, buildings, other UAVs).
    *   Feature Extraction: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) and other relevant acoustic features.
    *   Classification: Multi-class classification to identify object type.

4.  **Predictive Collision Avoidance Module:**
    *   Trajectory Prediction: Utilize Kalman filtering and motion modeling to predict the future trajectories of detected objects.
    *   Risk Assessment: Calculate the probability of collision based on predicted trajectories and uncertainty.
    *   Avoidance Maneuvering: Generate collision-free trajectories using a path planning algorithm (e.g., A*, RRT).
    *   Swarm Coordination: Coordinate avoidance maneuvers across the UAV swarm to avoid collisions.
    *   Pseudocode:

```
for each UAV in swarm:
    scan_environment()
    detect_objects()
    for each object:
        predict_trajectory(object)
        calculate_collision_risk(object)
        if collision_risk > threshold:
            plan_avoidance_maneuver()
            execute_maneuver()
            broadcast_maneuver_information()
```

5.  **Environmental Mapping Module:**
    *   Acoustic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping): Integrate acoustic data with IMU and GPS data to create a high-resolution 3D map of the environment.
    *   Data Fusion: Fuse acoustic data with other sensor data (e.g., LiDAR, cameras) to improve map accuracy and completeness.

6.  **Ground Station Software:**
    *   Real-time visualization of acoustic data, maps, and UAV positions.
    *   Remote control and monitoring of UAV swarm.
    *   Data logging and analysis.

**Operational Considerations:**

*   **Swarm Size:** Scalable to hundreds of UAVs.
*   **Communication Range:** Requires reliable wireless communication infrastructure.
*   **Power Management:** Optimize power consumption to maximize flight time.
*   **Environmental Conditions:** Performance may be affected by wind, temperature, and humidity.
*   **Safety:** Implement fail-safe mechanisms to prevent collisions and ensure safe operation.
