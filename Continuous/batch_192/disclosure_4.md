## Dynamic Category Merging & Predictive Refinement

**Concept:** Extend user-defined categories beyond simple saved searches to *dynamically merged* categories that learn from user interaction. Instead of static category definitions, these categories evolve based on item views, purchases, and explicit user feedback, offering a more personalized and relevant browsing experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Category Core:**

*   **Data Structure:** Each user-defined category isn’t just a saved search query, but a weighted collection of search terms, item IDs, and associated metadata (tags, attributes).
*   **Weighting System:** Weights are dynamically adjusted based on user activity:
    *   **View Weight:** Items viewed within a category increase the weight of associated terms/attributes.
    *   **Purchase Weight:** Items purchased have a higher weight impact.
    *   **Explicit Feedback:** "Like/Dislike" buttons on items within a category directly adjust weights.
    *   **Temporal Decay:** Older interactions have reduced weight, prioritizing recent interests.
*   **Category "Fuzziness":** Introduce a "fuzziness" parameter. Higher fuzziness expands the category scope (e.g., returns similar items even if they don’t *exactly* match the saved search). Lower fuzziness provides a more precise result set.

**2. Predictive Refinement Engine:**

*   **Similarity Algorithm:** Employ a machine learning algorithm (e.g., cosine similarity, collaborative filtering) to determine item similarity based on weighted category data.
*   **"Refine Category" Feature:** Users can highlight items *outside* the current category that they feel *should* be included. This immediately adjusts category weights and expands the search scope.  Conversely, they can exclude items, shrinking the category.
*   **"Category Suggestion" Feature:**  Based on user browsing history, the system *suggests* new category merges or splits. For example, if a user frequently views both "hiking boots" and "backpacks," the system might suggest a "Hiking Gear" category.
*   **"Category Chain" Visualization:**  Display category relationships visually.  Show how categories are merging, splitting, and influencing each other. This allows users to understand the system’s logic and control category evolution.

**3. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

```
// Category Data Structure
Class Category {
  String name;
  String originalQuery;
  Dictionary<String, Double> termWeights; // Term -> Weight
  Dictionary<ItemID, Double> itemWeights; // ItemID -> Weight
  Double fuzziness;
}

// Refine Category Function
Function refineCategory(UserID, CategoryID, ItemID, action) {
  Category category = getCategory(CategoryID);
  Item item = getItem(ItemID);

  if (action == "include") {
    // Extract terms from item description/tags
    List<String> terms = extractTerms(item);
    for (term in terms) {
      category.termWeights[term] += 0.1; // Increase term weight
    }
    category.itemWeights[ItemID] += 0.2; // Increase item weight
  } else if (action == "exclude") {
    // Reduce weights -  negative impact
    List<String> terms = extractTerms(item);
    for (term in terms) {
      category.termWeights[term] -= 0.05;
    }
    category.itemWeights[ItemID] -= 0.1;
  }
  saveCategory(category);
}

// Category Suggestion Engine
Function suggestCategories(UserID) {
  // Analyze browsing history
  List<Item> history = getBrowsingHistory(UserID);

  // Identify frequently co-viewed items
  Map<ItemPair, Integer> coViewCount = calculateCoViewCount(history);

  // Suggest new categories based on co-viewed items
  List<CategorySuggestion> suggestions = generateCategorySuggestions(coViewCount);

  return suggestions;
}
```

**4. User Interface Elements:**

*   **Category Evolution Graph:** A visual representation of how categories are merging and splitting over time.
*   **"Refine This Category" Button:** Triggers the refinement process, allowing users to include/exclude items.
*   **"Suggest New Category" Panel:** Displays algorithmically generated category suggestions.
*   **Fuzziness Slider:** Allows users to control the scope of each category.
