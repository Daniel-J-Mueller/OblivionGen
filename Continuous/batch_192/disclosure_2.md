## Dynamic Hardware Specialization via Runtime Bitstream Composition

**Concept:** A system enabling dynamic specialization of FPGAs *after* initial configuration, by composing smaller, pre-validated bitstream "modules" at runtime. This builds on the idea of a logic repository but moves beyond static bitstream delivery to *on-demand* hardware construction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Bitstream Module Repository:**

*   **Format:** Standardized bitstream module format. Each module encapsulates a specific, validated hardware function (e.g., a neural network layer, a video codec, a cryptographic accelerator).  Includes metadata: function description, resource requirements (LUTs, DSPs, memory), input/output interfaces, dependencies on other modules.
*   **Validation:** Rigorous pre-validation process. Modules are tested against a suite of benchmarks and security checks.  A "provenance" record tracks validation history.
*   **Versioning:**  Version control for modules. Allows rollback to previous versions if issues arise.
*   **Categorization:**  Modules are tagged with keywords for easy discovery.

**2. Runtime Composition Engine:**

*   **Request Interface:**  API for requesting specific hardware functionality.  Requests specify desired function, performance requirements (throughput, latency), and constraints (power, resource limits).
*   **Dependency Resolution:**  Engine analyzes request and resolves dependencies between modules.  Handles conflicting requirements (e.g., two modules requiring the same resource).
*   **Placement & Routing:**  Algorithm dynamically places and routes modules within the FPGA fabric.  Prioritizes performance, resource utilization, and power efficiency. Incorporates a 'congestion map' of the FPGA, learning from previous placements.
*   **Partial Bitstream Generation:**  Engine generates a *partial* bitstream containing only the newly placed and routed modules.  This minimizes reprogramming time and disruption.
*   **Runtime Verification:** Before applying the partial bitstream, perform lightweight functional verification of the composed hardware. Compare outputs of the newly integrated module with known-good test vectors.

**3. Host Logic Integration:**

*   **Host Logic Interface:** A standardized interface allowing communication between the host processor and the dynamically composed hardware. This interface allows the host to configure the dynamic logic, transfer data, and receive results.
*   **Security Firewall:** Host Logic implements a security firewall to prevent malicious or faulty dynamically loaded modules from compromising the entire system.
*   **Resource Management:**  Host Logic monitors resource usage (power, temperature) of the FPGA and dynamically adjusts module allocation to prevent overheating or instability.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Composition Engine):**

```
function ComposeHardware(request):
  modules = FindModules(request.function, request.performance)
  dependencies = ResolveDependencies(modules)
  if dependencies == ERROR:
    return ERROR
  
  placement = PlaceModules(modules, dependencies, FPGA_map)
  if placement == ERROR:
    return ERROR
  
  routing = RouteModules(placement, FPGA_map)
  if routing == ERROR:
    return ERROR
  
  partial_bitstream = GeneratePartialBitstream(routing)
  
  verification_result = VerifyBitstream(partial_bitstream)
  if verification_result == FAIL:
    return FAIL
  
  ApplyPartialBitstream(partial_bitstream)
  return SUCCESS
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simply storing and deploying pre-built bitstreams. It allows for *runtime* hardware specialization, enabling adaptive systems that can respond to changing workloads and requirements. The runtime verification and security features are crucial for building reliable and secure dynamically reconfigurable hardware. This differs from previous FPGA-as-a-service models that primarily focused on static bitstream delivery.
