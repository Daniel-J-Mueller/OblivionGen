## Dynamic Container Resilience through Predictive Layer Reconstruction

**Concept:** Proactively rebuild container layers *before* a threat is detected, creating a “shadow” container ready for instant switchover. This aims to minimize downtime and data loss beyond simple threat detection and remediation. The system leverages threat intelligence *and* performance metrics to predict likely compromise points within container layers.

**Specs:**

1.  **Layer Dependency Graph (LDG) Generation:**
    *   Each container's layered filesystem is analyzed at runtime to build an LDG. This graph maps each layer to its dependencies (parent layers) and the services/applications relying on it.
    *   LDG stored as JSON objects associated with the container ID. Example:
        ```json
        {
            "container_id": "app-123",
            "layers": [
                {"layer_id": "base-image", "dependencies": [], "services": ["webserver"]},
                {"layer_id": "app-code", "dependencies": ["base-image"], "services": ["webapp", "api"]},
                {"layer_id": "data-volume", "dependencies": ["app-code"], "services": ["database"]}
            ]
        }
    ```

2.  **Threat/Performance Score Calculation:**
    *   Each layer receives a continuously updated score based on two primary inputs:
        *   **Threat Intelligence Feed:** External feeds providing vulnerability data for software components within each layer. Score increases with identified vulnerabilities.
        *   **Runtime Performance Anomaly Detection:** Monitoring resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and identifying deviations from baseline behavior within the layer's processes. Score increases with detected anomalies.
    *   Score normalization to a 0-100 scale.

3.  **Predictive Layer Reconstruction Engine:**
    *   Monitors layer scores. If a layer’s score exceeds a defined threshold (adjustable per environment), the engine initiates a “shadow” rebuild of that layer.
    *   Rebuild process utilizes a dedicated pool of compute resources, minimizing impact on running containers.
    *   Rebuilt layer is stored as an immutable image in a secure registry.

4.  **Automated Container Switchover:**
    *   Upon threat *detection* (using existing methods), or *proactive* decision based on high predictive score, the system triggers an automated switchover to the pre-built shadow container.
    *   Switchover involves:
        *   Stopping the compromised/potentially compromised container.
        *   Starting a new container based on the rebuilt layers.
        *   Redirecting traffic to the new container.

5.  **Rollback Mechanism:**
    *   Store a snapshot of the original container’s state before switchover.
    *   If the switchover results in unforeseen issues, allow a rollback to the original container.

6.  **Metadata & Tagging:**
    *   Each rebuilt layer is tagged with a timestamp and the reason for reconstruction (e.g., “Vulnerability CVE-2023-XXXX”, “Performance Anomaly”).
    *   Metadata is stored alongside the image in the registry.

**Pseudocode (Switchover Process):**

```
function switch_container(container_id):
  // 1. Get layer IDs
  layer_ids = get_layer_ids(container_id)

  // 2. Check for pre-built shadow layers
  for layer_id in layer_ids:
    shadow_image = check_shadow_image(layer_id)
    if shadow_image == null:
      // Rebuild layer (expensive operation)
      shadow_image = rebuild_layer(layer_id)

  // 3. Stop current container
  stop_container(container_id)

  // 4. Create new container from shadow layers
  new_container_id = create_container(shadow_layers)

  // 5. Start new container
  start_container(new_container_id)

  // 6. Redirect traffic
  redirect_traffic(container_id, new_container_id)
```

**Considerations:**

*   Storage overhead of storing shadow layers.
*   Computational cost of rebuilding layers.
*   Network latency during traffic redirection.
*   Sophisticated anomaly detection algorithms required.
*   Integration with existing container orchestration platforms (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).
