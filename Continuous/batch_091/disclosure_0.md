## Multi-Procurement Option Prediction & Automated Adjustment

**Concept:** Leverage user behavior and external data to *predict* preferred procurement options and *automatically adjust* the displayed multi-procurement ordering section to prioritize likely choices, reducing user decision fatigue.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Profiling Module:**

*   **User History:** Track user selections within the multi-procurement ordering section (payment source, delivery address, shipping speed, gift wrapping). Store as weighted preferences.
*   **Contextual Data:** Integrate data from:
    *   **Time of Day:** Prioritize faster shipping during peak hours.
    *   **Location (IP-based):** Default to nearby delivery addresses.
    *   **Calendar Integration (Optional, with user permission):** Identify upcoming birthdays/events to suggest gift options.
    *   **Purchased Item Category:** Infer likely shipping preferences (fragile items = special handling).
*   **External Data (Optional):** Integrate with logistics providers for real-time shipping estimates/delays.
*   **Profile Storage:** User profiles stored securely, anonymized where appropriate, adhering to privacy regulations.

**2. Prediction Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., collaborative filtering, neural network) trained on user behavior data.
*   **Scoring:** Assign a score to each procurement option based on predicted likelihood of selection.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Real-time scoring based on current context and user behavior.

**3.  Multi-Procurement Ordering Section Interface Adaptation:**

*   **Prioritized Display:**  Display procurement options sorted by predicted score.  Top 3-5 options prominently displayed.
*   **“Recommended” Label:** Visually highlight the highest-scoring option.
*   **Collapsible Sections:**  Allow users to expand/collapse less frequently used options.
*   **"Smart Defaults":** Automatically select the highest-scoring option upon page load (user can override).
*   **A/B Testing:** Implement A/B testing to optimize the interface and algorithm based on user engagement.

**4.  Automated Adjustment Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateProcurementOptions(userID, itemCategory, timeOfDay, location)

  // Fetch user profile and preferences
  userProfile = GetUserProfile(userID)

  // Calculate base scores for each procurement option
  FOR EACH option IN procurementOptions
    score = 0
    // Add score based on user preferences
    IF option.paymentMethod IN userProfile.preferredPaymentMethods THEN
      score += 0.4
    ENDIF
    IF option.deliveryAddress IN userProfile.preferredAddresses THEN
      score += 0.3
    ENDIF

    // Add contextual scores
    IF timeOfDay > 9:00 AND timeOfDay < 17:00 THEN
      IF option.shippingSpeed = "Express" THEN
        score += 0.2
      ENDIF
    ENDIF

    IF itemCategory = "Fragile" THEN
      IF option.shippingHandling = "Careful" THEN
        score += 0.2
      ENDIF
    ENDIF

    //Apply location based weighting
    distance = CalculateDistance(location, option.deliveryAddress)
    IF distance < 10 THEN
        score += 0.1
    ENDIF

    option.score = score
  ENDFOR

  //Sort options by score (descending)
  procurementOptions.sort(descending)

  //Display top 5 options, with "Recommended" label on top option
  DisplayOptions(procurementOptions[0:5])

END FUNCTION
```

**5. Error Handling & Fallback:**

*   If user profile is unavailable, display default options (based on location).
*   Monitor prediction accuracy; if consistently low, revert to a static display.
*   Allow users to easily override automated selections.
