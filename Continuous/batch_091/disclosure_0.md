## Dynamic Host Logic Shell Composition

**Specification:** A system for composing host logic shells from modular, pre-verified components, allowing for runtime adaptation of FPGA functionality beyond simple configuration bitstream switching.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of monolithic host logic shells selected *before* configuration data generation, the system allows for a shell to be *assembled* from functional blocks *during* configuration data generation, and even *after* initial FPGA programming. This provides extreme flexibility and allows for features to be added/removed from the host logic *without* a full FPGA re-program.

**Components:**

*   **Functional Block Library:** A repository of pre-verified, parameterized FPGA blocks representing common host-side functions (e.g., PCIe interface, Ethernet MAC, memory controller, security enclave, debugging probes, power management).  Each block has well-defined input/output interfaces.  Metadata associated with each block includes resource usage (LUTs, registers, DSPs), power consumption, and performance characteristics.
*   **Composition Engine:**  A software module that takes a high-level “feature request” (e.g., "enable remote debugging," "add secure boot," "increase PCIe bandwidth") and translates it into a composition plan. This plan details which functional blocks from the library are needed and how they should be interconnected.  The engine uses constraint satisfaction algorithms to ensure compatibility and optimize resource usage. It incorporates an AI-driven cost model to estimate resource usage and potential performance trade-offs.
*   **Dynamic Partial Bitstream Generator:**  A tool that generates partial bitstream updates for only the *changed* portions of the host logic shell. This minimizes reconfiguration time and avoids disrupting the running application logic. It leverages existing partial reconfiguration techniques but extends them to manage a modular composition process.
*   **Runtime Shell Manager:**  An FPGA-resident module that manages the loading, unloading, and interconnection of functional blocks.  It provides an API for the host system to request feature additions or removals.  It also handles error detection and recovery in case of a failed reconfiguration.  Uses a network-on-chip (NoC) architecture internally for flexible interconnectivity.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Feature Request:** The host system sends a request to the Runtime Shell Manager, specifying the desired FPGA functionality.
2.  **Composition Planning:** The Runtime Shell Manager communicates with the Composition Engine, which selects the appropriate functional blocks and creates a composition plan.
3.  **Partial Bitstream Generation:** The Dynamic Partial Bitstream Generator creates a partial bitstream update for the selected functional blocks.
4.  **Runtime Reconfiguration:** The Runtime Shell Manager loads the partial bitstream update into the FPGA, interconnecting the new functional blocks with the existing application logic.  This reconfiguration is performed without interrupting the main application.
5.  **Verification:**  The Runtime Shell Manager runs internal verification tests to ensure that the new functional blocks are operating correctly.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Shell Manager - Feature Addition):**

```
function addFeature(featureName):
  compositionPlan = CompositionEngine.getPlan(featureName)
  partialBitstream = DynamicBitstreamGenerator.generate(compositionPlan)
  
  beginPartialReconfiguration()
  loadBitstream(partialBitstream)
  establishInterconnections(compositionPlan.interconnections)
  endPartialReconfiguration()
  
  runVerificationTests()
  return success
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond selecting a pre-defined host logic shell to *building* one on-demand. This allows for unprecedented flexibility, enabling features to be added or removed without a full FPGA reprogram. It leverages dynamic partial reconfiguration in a new way, creating a truly adaptable FPGA platform.  The AI-driven cost model and automated composition engine further enhance the system's usability and efficiency.
