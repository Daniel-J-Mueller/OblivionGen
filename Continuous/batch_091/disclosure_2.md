**Dynamic Lenticular Projection Mapping**

**Concept:** Extend the lenticular image capture/display system to incorporate real-time projection mapping onto physical surfaces, creating interactive, dynamic lenticular displays that aren't limited to a screen. Imagine a building facade or a tabletop becoming a lenticular display.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Multi-Camera Array:**  At least four high-resolution cameras arranged in a tetrahedral or similar spatial configuration. This provides depth information and broad coverage for accurate 3D reconstruction.
*   **Spatial Mapping Sensor:** LiDAR or Time-of-Flight sensor for generating a detailed 3D mesh of the target surface.  Range: 0.5m - 20m. Resolution: 5mm.
*   **High-Lumen Projectors (xN):**  Array of pico-projectors with automatic keystone correction and blending capabilities.  Brightness: Minimum 5000 lumens each. Contrast Ratio: 2000:1.  Wavelength: RGB laser for vibrant colours. Number of Projectors: Scalable, based on surface area.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):**  6-axis IMU integrated into the computing device to track precise movement and orientation.
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** High-performance processor (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson) for real-time 3D reconstruction, lenticular image generation, and projector control.
*   **Wireless Communication:** 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for seamless data transfer and control.
*   **Power Supply:** High-capacity battery pack with fast charging capabilities.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Real-time 3D Reconstruction:** Algorithms to fuse data from the multi-camera array and LiDAR sensor, generating a dense point cloud and a textured 3D mesh of the target surface.
*   **Lenticular Image Rendering Engine:**
    *   Takes a series of 2D images or video frames as input.
    *   Calculates the necessary viewpoints for creating a lenticular effect.
    *   Renders each viewpoint onto a virtual lenticular array.
    *   Outputs a composite image optimized for projection onto the 3D mesh.
*   **Projection Mapping Algorithm:**
    *   Maps the rendered lenticular image onto the 3D mesh, taking into account surface geometry, texture, and lighting conditions.
    *   Performs keystone correction, blending, and warping to compensate for projection distortions.
*   **Motion Tracking & Viewpoint Control:**
    *   Uses IMU data to track the device's movement and orientation in real-time.
    *   Adjusts the viewpoint of the lenticular image based on the device's position, creating a parallax effect as the user moves around.
*   **Interactive Gesture Recognition:**  Allows users to interact with the projected lenticular display using hand gestures or other input methods.
*   **API/SDK:**  Provides a software interface for developers to create custom lenticular applications and integrate them with other systems.

**Pseudocode (Motion-Adaptive Viewpoint Calculation):**

```
FUNCTION calculate_viewpoint(device_rotation, target_surface_normal):
  // device_rotation: Quaternion representing the device's orientation
  // target_surface_normal: Normal vector of the surface at the current projection point

  // 1. Convert device rotation to rotation matrix
  rotation_matrix = quaternion_to_matrix(device_rotation)

  // 2. Calculate the viewing direction based on the device's orientation
  viewing_direction = rotation_matrix * [0, 0, -1] // Assuming device's forward direction is [0, 0, -1]

  // 3. Calculate the angle between the viewing direction and the surface normal
  angle = arccos(dot_product(viewing_direction, target_surface_normal))

  // 4. Determine the appropriate viewpoint based on the angle
  IF angle < 30 degrees:
    viewpoint = "Front View"
  ELSE IF angle > 60 degrees:
    viewpoint = "Side View"
  ELSE:
    viewpoint = "Intermediate View"

  RETURN viewpoint
```

**Application Examples:**

*   **Interactive Architecture:** Buildings that respond to user movement with dynamic lenticular displays.
*   **Immersive Tabletop Gaming:** Table surfaces that become 3D game boards with parallax effects.
*   **Dynamic Product Displays:** Products that appear to float in mid-air with holographic lenticular projections.
*   **Augmented Reality Art Installations:** Large-scale art installations that blend virtual and physical worlds with dynamic lenticular imagery.
