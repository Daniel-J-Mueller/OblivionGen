## Dynamic Event Weighting for Real-Time Personalization

**Concept:** Extend the existing item association system by dynamically weighting event types based on real-time user session data. Instead of static event type pairings (view -> purchase), the system infers user intent *during* a session and adjusts event weighting accordingly.

**Specification:**

1.  **Session Data Collection:** Capture granular user interactions within a session: dwell time on items, scrolling behavior, zoom level, cursor movements, add-to-cart actions (even if abandoned), search refinements, category browsing, etc.

2.  **Intent Inference Module:** Employ a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a decision tree) trained to infer user intent from session data. Intent categories could include:
    *   **Exploratory:**  Browsing broadly, little interaction with specific items.
    *   **Comparative:** Viewing multiple items within a category, comparing specifications.
    *   **Intent-to-Purchase:**  Adding items to cart, viewing checkout information.
    *   **Research:**  Viewing detailed product information, reading reviews.

3.  **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**  Based on the inferred intent, adjust the weights assigned to different event types.  For example:
    *   **Exploratory:**  Increase the weight of ‘item view’ and ‘category browse’ events.  Reduce the weight of ‘purchase’ events (since the user isn’t ready to buy).
    *   **Comparative:**  Increase the weight of ‘item view’ and ‘specification comparison’ events.
    *   **Intent-to-Purchase:**  Increase the weight of ‘add-to-cart’ and ‘checkout view’ events.
    *   **Research:** Increase the weight of ‘item view’ + 'review read' events.

    Weight adjustment can be implemented using a scaling factor. Example:

    `WeightedEventScore = BaseEventScore * IntentScalingFactor`

4.  **Real-Time Item Association Update:**  Re-calculate item associations on-the-fly, using the dynamically weighted event scores.  This requires a fast, in-memory data structure for storing item associations.

5.  **API Extension:**  Add a new API parameter to the recommendation request: `session_data`. This parameter will contain the raw session data collected from the user. The service will use this data to infer user intent and adjust event weighting accordingly.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function getRecommendations(userId, firstItem, sessionData):
    intent = inferIntent(sessionData)
    weightedEventScores = calculateWeightedEventScores(intent)
    associatedItems = calculateItemAssociations(firstItem, weightedEventScores)
    return associatedItems
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Session Data:** JSON object containing timestamped user interactions.
*   **Intent Category:** Enum (Exploratory, Comparative, Intent-to-Purchase, Research)
*   **Intent Scaling Factors:** Dictionary mapping Intent Category to a dictionary of Event Type to Scaling Factor.

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   The Intent Inference Module needs to be lightweight and fast to avoid impacting response times.
*   The in-memory data structure for storing item associations needs to be scalable and resilient.
*   A/B testing will be crucial to validate the effectiveness of dynamic event weighting.
