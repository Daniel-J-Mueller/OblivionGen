## Spatial Audio Reconstruction with Dynamic Microphone Masking

**Concept:** Enhance beamforming by dynamically masking microphones contributing to noise or distortion *within* the selected beam, improving signal clarity beyond simple beam steering. This addresses scenarios where a primary sound source isn’t perfectly isolated, or where reflections/reverberation corrupt the chosen beam.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Microphone Array: Existing array as per the patent. Minimum 8 microphones.
*   Processing Unit: High-performance DSP or GPU capable of real-time audio processing.
*   Audio Interface: Low-latency audio interface for input and output.

**II. Software Modules:**

1.  **Beamforming Engine:** (Base functionality – inherited from existing patent implementation). Responsible for initial beam steering and signal extraction.
2.  **Microphone Quality Assessment (MQA):**  This is the core innovation.
    *   *Input:* Raw audio data from each microphone in the array.
    *   *Process:*
        *   **Transient Detection:** Identify short-duration audio events (clicks, pops, distortion) on each microphone channel.
        *   **Spectral Analysis:**  Analyze the frequency content of each microphone signal. Identify frequencies where a microphone exhibits anomalous behavior (e.g., increased noise floor, harmonic distortion).
        *   **Coherence Analysis:**  Compare the signal from each microphone to the overall beamformed signal. Low coherence indicates a problematic microphone.
        *   **Quality Score:** Assign each microphone a real-time “Quality Score” based on a weighted combination of the above metrics. Weights adjustable via configuration.
    *   *Output:* Per-microphone Quality Score (0.0 - 1.0, 1.0 being best).
3.  **Dynamic Microphone Masking (DMM):**
    *   *Input:* Beamformed signal, Per-microphone Quality Scores.
    *   *Process:*
        *   **Mask Generation:**  For each time frame, generate a "microphone mask" based on Quality Scores. Microphones with low scores are assigned lower weights in the mask.  A threshold can be applied to completely mute severely degraded microphones.  Masks are applied *within* the selected beamformed direction.
        *   **Weighted Summation:** Re-calculate the beamformed signal using the microphone mask as weighting factors.  This effectively attenuates or removes the contribution of problematic microphones.
        *   **Spatial Smoothing:** Apply a spatial smoothing filter to the microphone mask over time to prevent rapid fluctuations and maintain stability.
    *   *Output:* Enhanced Beamformed Signal.
4.  **Adaptive Thresholding:**  Dynamically adjusts Quality Score thresholds based on the overall noise floor and signal strength, maximizing sensitivity in quiet environments and preventing false positives in noisy environments.
5.  **Configuration Interface:**  GUI or API for adjusting parameters such as Quality Score weights, thresholds, smoothing filters, and masking levels.

**III. Pseudocode (DMM Core):**

```
function EnhanceBeamform(beamformed_signal, microphone_data, quality_scores):
  // microphone_data is a 2D array (channels x time frames)
  // quality_scores is a 1D array (channels) - current frame
  
  mask = calculate_mask(quality_scores) // Function to create mask based on scores
  
  enhanced_signal = 0
  for channel in range(num_channels):
    enhanced_signal += microphone_data[channel] * mask[channel]
  
  return enhanced_signal

function calculate_mask(quality_scores):
  // Apply a sigmoid function to the quality scores
  //  to create a smooth mask
  mask = sigmoid(quality_scores)
  
  // Option to apply a threshold to completely mute bad mics
  // for i in range(len(mask)):
  //   if mask[i] < threshold:
  //     mask[i] = 0.0
  
  return mask

function sigmoid(x):
  return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
```

**IV. Future Considerations:**

*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Train a machine learning model to predict microphone quality based on historical data and environmental conditions.
*   **Source Localization Enhancement:** Use the microphone masking to refine source localization algorithms by reducing the impact of noisy or distorted microphones.
*   **Acoustic Scene Classification:** Integrate acoustic scene classification to adapt the masking parameters based on the current environment (e.g., office, home, outdoors).
*   **Real-time Noise Cancellation**: Use the signal from the masked channels to inform a noise cancellation algorithm.
