## Dynamic Slot Type Merging & Conflict Resolution

**Specification:** A system enabling real-time merging of multiple slot type definitions with intelligent conflict resolution, facilitated by a probabilistic model informed by utterance context.

**Core Concept:** Existing slot type systems treat definitions as static. This design proposes a system where slot types can be dynamically composed at runtime, leveraging multiple definitions to increase coverage and accuracy, particularly in complex, multi-domain conversational scenarios.

**Components:**

1.  **Slot Type Repository:** Stores individual slot type definitions (as in the provided patent) along with metadata including domain, confidence score, and version.

2.  **Context Analyzer:**  Processes incoming utterances to identify the conversational domain(s) and user intent. Outputs a probability distribution across known domains.

3.  **Slot Type Selector:** Based on the Context Analyzerâ€™s output, identifies relevant slot type definitions from the Repository.  A threshold is applied to filter out definitions with low probability scores.

4.  **Conflict Resolver:**  This is the core of the innovation. When multiple selected definitions contain overlapping slot values, the Conflict Resolver utilizes a probabilistic model to determine the most appropriate value. 

    *   **Model Input:**  Utterance context (from Context Analyzer),  slot value definitions (from selected slot types), historical usage data (frequency of value across all utterances), and a configurable weighting scheme.
    *   **Probabilistic Calculation:**  Assigns a probability score to each conflicting value based on the model inputs.  Values with higher probability are preferred.
    *   **Resolution Strategies:** Configurable strategies:
        *   *Highest Probability:* Selects the value with the highest probability.
        *   *Weighted Random:*  Samples a value based on its probability.
        *   *Contextual Override:*  If the utterance contains explicit cues (e.g., keywords) favoring a specific value, it overrides the probabilistic calculation.

5.  **Merged Slot Type:** The Conflict Resolver outputs a dynamically merged slot type, containing a unified set of values and associated confidence scores.  This merged type is used for utterance analysis.

**Pseudocode (Conflict Resolver):**

```
FUNCTION ResolveConflicts(utterance, selectedSlotTypes):
    conflicts = {}
    FOR EACH slotType IN selectedSlotTypes:
        FOR EACH value IN slotType.values:
            IF value EXISTS IN conflicts:
                conflicts[value].add(slotType.domain, slotType.confidence)
            ELSE:
                conflicts[value] = [slotType.domain, slotType.confidence]

    FOR EACH value IN conflicts:
        probability = 0
        totalWeight = 0
        FOR i IN RANGE(LENGTH(conflicts[value])):
            domain = conflicts[value][i].domain
            confidence = conflicts[value][i].confidence
            weight = GetDomainWeight(domain) * confidence //Weighting based on domain relevance
            probability += weight
            totalWeight += weight

        value.probability = probability / totalWeight

    //Apply Contextual Override (if applicable)
    IF utterance CONTAINS keyword FOR specific value:
       value.probability = 1

    RETURN sorted(values) BY probability DESC //Return values sorted by probability
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **SlotTypeDefinition:** `name`, `domain`, `values` (list of strings), `confidence` (float)
*   **ValueConflict:** `value` (string), `domains` (list of strings), `probabilities` (list of floats)

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Multi-Domain Assistants:** Improved accuracy in handling conversations spanning multiple topics.
*   **Personalized Experiences:** Dynamically adapting slot types based on user preferences and history.
*   **Robustness to Ambiguity:**  Handling ambiguous utterances by combining information from multiple slot type definitions.
