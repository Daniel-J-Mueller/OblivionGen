## Secure Device 'Beacon' & Dynamic Reward System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply disabling a lost device and displaying a return message. Implement a continuously broadcasting, encrypted ‘beacon’ signal with escalating reward offers, incentivizing *any* finder – not just the owner – to return the device quickly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Beacon Signal Generation:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate a low-power Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) chip dedicated to beacon transmission, separate from the primary device communication systems.  This ensures functionality even if the main device power is critically low or the OS is compromised.
*   **Encryption:** Implement AES-256 encryption for the beacon payload. Encryption key derived from a combination of device serial number, owner account ID, and a time-sensitive component.  This prevents unauthorized modification of reward details or location data.
*   **Payload Structure:**
    *   Device Identifier (Serial Number)
    *   Encrypted Reward Amount (Initial Value)
    *   Encrypted Location Hint (Coarse granularity – e.g., city, postal code - updated periodically)
    *   Timestamp (Updated every broadcast)
    *   Checksum (for data integrity)
*   **Broadcast Frequency:** Variable, adjustable via server control. Starts at 1Hz. Increases to 5Hz if no 'acknowledgement' signal is received after 24 hours, and up to 10Hz if 72 hours pass.

**2. Reward Escalation & Finder App Integration:**

*   **Initial Reward:** Predefined by the owner or a default value.
*   **Escalation Algorithm:** Reward increases dynamically based on time since loss. Example:
    *   0-24 hours: Base Reward
    *   24-48 hours: Base Reward * 1.5
    *   48-72 hours: Base Reward * 2
    *   72+ hours: Base Reward * 3 (maximum)
*   **Finder App:** Dedicated mobile application that scans for beacon signals.
    *   Decrypts the payload using a publicly available decryption key (derived from a master key known only to the reward system server).
    *   Displays the current reward amount and a brief message to the finder.
    *   Provides a secure communication channel to the reward system server (authentication via phone number or social media account).
    *   Facilitates return coordination (provides return shipping label or coordinates a local meetup).
    *   Handles reward disbursement (funds transferred to finder's preferred payment method after device verification).

**3. Server-Side Management:**

*   **Device Registration:**  Securely registers each device with the reward system. Associates device serial number with owner account ID and reward preferences.
*   **Loss Reporting:** Allows owners to report a device as lost via a web portal or mobile app. Activates the beacon signal.
*   **Reward Management:** Processes reward payouts to finders.  Fraud detection algorithms to prevent abuse.
*   **Location Tracking (Optional):** If device has active GPS, periodically transmit approximate location via encrypted beacon signal (privacy considerations apply – user consent required).

**Pseudocode (Finder App - Beacon Scan):**

```
function scanForBeacons() {
  beacons = scanBLEDevices();
  for each beacon in beacons {
    if (beacon.deviceID matches registered beacon format) {
      encryptedPayload = beacon.payload;
      decryptedPayload = decrypt(encryptedPayload, publicKey);
      rewardAmount = decryptedPayload.rewardAmount;
      displayReward(rewardAmount);
      if (user clicks "Report Found Device") {
        sendDeviceID(decryptedPayload.deviceID);
        // Initiate return process
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond passive 'lost mode' functionality. The escalating reward, combined with the continuously broadcasting beacon signal, incentivizes *anyone* to participate in the device recovery process.  It leverages the ‘wisdom of the crowd’ to significantly increase the chances of a successful return, even in situations where the owner has limited ability to actively search. The integration with a dedicated finder app streamlines the return process and provides a secure mechanism for reward disbursement.
