## Adaptive Authentication Difficulty via Gamified Challenges

**Concept:** Extend the multi-layer authentication system with a dynamic difficulty adjustment based on user behavior and risk assessment, presented as a series of gamified challenges. This transforms authentication from a static barrier into an adaptive, engaging process.

**Specs:**

*   **Challenge Library:** A repository of authentication challenges categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and authentication factor (Knowledge-Based, Possession-Based, Inherence-Based). Examples:
    *   *Easy:* Simple math problems, image identification (select all squares with a car), security question.
    *   *Medium:*  Slightly more complex calculations, pattern recognition with timed responses, short audio clip identification.
    *   *Hard:*  Logic puzzles, complex image analysis requiring specific identification, biometrics with increased sensitivity.
*   **Risk Engine:** A module that assesses risk based on multiple factors:
    *   Geolocation (IP address, GPS data if available).
    *   Time of access.
    *   User history (past authentication successes/failures).
    *   Device fingerprinting.
    *   Network characteristics (VPN detection).
*   **Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm:**
    1.  Initial risk score calculation by the Risk Engine.
    2.  Starting challenge difficulty set to Medium.
    3.  User attempts a challenge.
    4.  *Success:* If successful, increase the risk threshold for maintaining the current difficulty level.
    5.  *Failure:*  Decrease the difficulty level by one step.
    6.  Repeat steps 4-5 until authentication is complete or the difficulty reaches the minimum.
    7.  If the risk score significantly increases at any point, immediately increase the difficulty level.
*   **Token Augmentation:** Authentication tokens will contain a 'challenge history' field, storing details of completed challenges. This history is used for adaptive difficulty adjustment on subsequent logins and also contributes to the risk engine’s assessment.
*   **User Profile Integration:** A user profile stores preferred authentication factors. The system prioritizes challenges aligning with these preferences, where feasible.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/challenge/request`:  Requests a challenge based on current risk score and user profile. Returns challenge details (type, instructions, expected response format).
    *   `/challenge/submit`:  Submits a response to a challenge. Returns success/failure status and updated risk score.
    *   `/challenge/history`: Retrieves a user’s challenge history.

**Pseudocode (Challenge Request):**

```
FUNCTION requestChallenge(userId, deviceId, ipAddress)
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(userId, deviceId, ipAddress)
  userPreferences = getUserPreferences(userId)

  IF riskScore > highThreshold THEN
    challengeType = "Hard"
  ELSE IF riskScore > mediumThreshold THEN
    challengeType = "Medium"
  ELSE
    challengeType = "Easy"

  // Filter for challenge types matching user preferences
  availableChallenges = filterChallenges(challengeType, userPreferences)

  //Select random challenge from available challenges
  selectedChallenge = chooseRandom(availableChallenges)

  RETURN selectedChallenge
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateRiskScore(userId, deviceId, ipAddress)
  //Implement scoring logic based on factors
  //e.g. Geolocation, device reputation, time of access
  score = 0

  //Geolocation
  IF geolocationIsSuspicious(ipAddress) THEN
    score += 20
  END IF

  //Device reputation
  deviceReputation = getDeviceReputation(deviceId)
  score += deviceReputation

  //Time of access
  IF accessTimeIsSuspicious() THEN
    score += 15
  END IF

  RETURN score
END FUNCTION
