## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Tagging for Dynamic Proximity

**Concept:** Extend the beaconing approach to incorporate dynamic frequency shifting within the beacon signals, creating unique "resonance tags" for devices. This moves beyond simple signal strength and identification data to establish a more robust and nuanced proximity determination system.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Modulation:** Beacons aren't fixed frequency. Each beacon cycle modulates the carrier frequency by a small, pseudo-random amount within a pre-defined bandwidth. The pseudo-random number generation (PRNG) is seeded with a device-specific key and current timestamp.
*   **Receiver Architecture:** Receiving devices employ a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) based spectrum analyzer to monitor for beacon signals across the defined bandwidth.  Instead of directly detecting a single frequency, the receiver *looks for the spectral 'signature' of the modulated beacon* â€“ the distribution of energy across the frequencies.
*   **Proximity Algorithm:**
    1.  **Beacon Capture:** Receiver continuously captures FFT spectra.
    2.  **Signature Extraction:** Algorithm extracts the spectral signature from each detected beacon. This is a vector representing the energy distribution across frequencies.
    3.  **Correlation:**  The receiver correlates its captured spectral signatures with a database of known signatures. This database can be pre-populated with expected signatures from trusted devices or built dynamically.  A high correlation score indicates a potential match.
    4.  **Resonance Matching:**  A 'resonance match' is declared when:
        *   The correlation score exceeds a threshold.
        *   The *rate of change* of the spectral signature matches the expected rate of change based on the PRNG algorithm and timestamp. (This prevents spoofing - a static or slowly changing signature won't match).
    5.  **Proximity Estimation:** Proximity is determined based on both correlation score *and* the time offset between the expected and received beacon cycles. Shorter time offsets indicate closer proximity.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Software Defined Radio (SDR) capable devices for both beacon transmission and reception.
    *   Real-time signal processing capabilities (FPGA or dedicated DSP).
    *   Secure key storage for PRNG seeding.
*   **Pseudocode (Receiver Side):**

```
function processSpectrum(spectrumData):
  signature = extractSignature(spectrumData)
  bestMatch = findBestMatch(signature, knownSignatures)

  if bestMatch.correlation > threshold and
     bestMatch.timeOffset < tolerance:
      designateProximate(bestMatch.deviceID)
      return

  //No match - potential anomaly or new device
  logAnomaly()

function extractSignature(spectrumData):
  // Perform FFT if necessary
  //Calculate energy distribution across frequency bands
  return signatureVector

function findBestMatch(signature, knownSignatures):
  bestMatch = null
  bestCorrelation = 0

  for each knownSignature in knownSignatures:
    correlation = calculateCorrelation(signature, knownSignature.signature)
    timeOffset = calculateTimeOffset(signature, knownSignature)

    if correlation > bestCorrelation:
      bestCorrelation = correlation
      bestMatch = knownSignature
      bestMatch.timeOffset = timeOffset

  return bestMatch

function calculateCorrelation(signature1, signature2):
  //Use a suitable correlation metric (e.g., Pearson correlation coefficient)
  return correlationValue

function calculateTimeOffset(signature1, signature2):
  //Compare the timing characteristics of the signatures
  return timeOffsetValue
```

**Novelty:** This approach isn't just about signal strength or identification. It introduces a temporal and spectral component to proximity detection, making it significantly more resistant to interference and spoofing. The dynamic frequency shifting acts as a unique "resonance tag," enabling more reliable identification and proximity estimation.
