## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Wearable Biometrics

**System Overview:** A wearable system integrating time-of-flight sensing, multi-spectral imaging, and localized haptic feedback to provide real-time confirmation of sensor contact and optimize biometric data acquisition.

**Inspiration:** The patent details focus on determining skin elevations to account for sensor compression. This inspires a system that actively *adjusts* compression via haptic feedback, not just compensates for it. 

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Miniaturized Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensor (range: 1-10mm, accuracy: 0.1mm).
    *   Multi-spectral imaging module (visible light, near-infrared).
    *   Array of micro-actuators capable of localized pressure variation (piezoelectric or microfluidic).
    *   Standard biometric sensors (ECG, PPG, GSR, temperature).
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded microcontroller with DSP capabilities.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transmission.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery.
*   **Form Factor:** Flexible patch designed for placement on limbs or torso.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Contact Optimization Algorithm:**
        1.  **Initial Scan:** TOF sensor performs a rapid scan of the skin surface to create a preliminary depth map.
        2.  **Pressure Mapping:** Based on the depth map, the algorithm calculates an optimal pressure profile to maximize sensor contact area and minimize air gaps.
        3.  **Actuator Control:** The algorithm sends signals to the micro-actuator array to apply localized pressure according to the calculated profile.
        4.  **Real-time Adjustment:** Multi-spectral imaging monitors skin perfusion (blood flow) in response to pressure. The algorithm adjusts actuator output to maintain optimal perfusion levels â€“ indicated by a specific range of NIR reflectance.
        5.  **Biometric Data Integration:**  Biometric data (ECG, PPG, etc.) is correlated with the optimized contact profile. This allows for data filtering and removal of artifacts caused by poor contact.
        6.  **User Feedback:**  A subtle, localized haptic pulse confirms optimal contact to the user.
*   **Pseudocode (Contact Optimization Algorithm):**

```
function optimizeContact():
    depthMap = scanWithTOF()
    pressureProfile = calculatePressureProfile(depthMap)
    applyPressure(pressureProfile)
    while true:
        skinPerfusion = measureSkinPerfusion()
        if skinPerfusion < minPerfusion:
            increasePressure(localizedArea)
        else if skinPerfusion > maxPerfusion:
            decreasePressure(localizedArea)
        else:
            // Optimal perfusion achieved
            break
    return optimizedBiometricData
```

**Innovation Details:**

The system *actively* creates optimal contact between sensors and the skin. Existing approaches primarily focus on *compensating* for poor contact. This system leverages real-time feedback from both skin topography (TOF) and perfusion (multi-spectral imaging) to dynamically adjust pressure.

The inclusion of haptic feedback for the user provides confirmation of optimal sensor placement, improving data quality and user trust. The integration with standard biometric sensors allows for enhanced data accuracy and artifact removal.  The system aims to maximize signal fidelity by proactively ensuring reliable sensor-skin contact, which significantly increases the potential for non-invasive monitoring applications.
