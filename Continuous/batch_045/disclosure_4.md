## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Extend the multi-path energy level calculation to not just *detect* audio characteristics, but to *compose* synthetic acoustic scenes based on real-time environmental analysis. This moves beyond simple wake-word detection and into proactive ambient audio augmentation or masking.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing microphone array (as in the provided patent), dedicated DSP co-processor, small broadband speaker array (minimum 4 speakers, strategically positioned).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Environmental Analyzer:** Inherits the multi-path energy level calculation from the existing patent. Refined to identify dominant sound *types* (speech, music, traffic, nature, mechanical) and their respective energy levels. Outputs a dynamic ‘acoustic fingerprint’ of the environment.
    *   **Sound Library:** A curated library of high-fidelity soundscapes, individual sound events (e.g., bird song, rain, coffee machine), and generative audio patches. Categorized by sound type and tagged with associated energy level characteristics.
    *   **Composition Engine:** This is the core innovation. It dynamically selects and mixes sounds from the Sound Library based on the output of the Environmental Analyzer. The goal is to either *augment* desirable sounds or *mask* undesirable ones.
        *   **Augmentation Mode:** If a desirable sound is detected (e.g., faint music), the Composition Engine subtly boosts its volume and adds complementary harmonic content.
        *   **Masking Mode:** If an undesirable sound is detected (e.g., loud traffic), the Composition Engine generates a counter-soundscape to reduce its perceived annoyance. This could involve introducing broadband noise, natural sounds, or rhythmic patterns.
    *   **Spatialization Engine:**  Responsible for positioning the generated sounds in 3D space using the speaker array.  Employs head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to create a realistic auditory experience.
    *   **User Profile Manager:** Allows users to customize the acoustic scene composition based on their preferences.  Options include preferred masking sounds, augmentation levels, and overall ambient sound profile.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Reactive Mode:** The system continuously analyzes the environment and adjusts the acoustic scene in real-time.
    *   **Proactive Mode:** The system anticipates potential noise disturbances based on time of day, location, and user activity.  It pre-generates a masking soundscape to minimize annoyance.
*   **Pseudocode (Composition Engine):**

```
function compose_scene(environmental_fingerprint, user_profile):
  // Extract dominant sound types and energy levels from fingerprint
  dominant_sounds = extract_dominant_sounds(environmental_fingerprint)
  energy_levels = extract_energy_levels(environmental_fingerprint)

  // Determine desired action (augment or mask) for each sound
  actions = determine_actions(dominant_sounds, energy_levels, user_profile)

  // Select sounds from library based on actions
  selected_sounds = select_sounds_from_library(actions)

  // Adjust sound levels based on energy levels and user preferences
  adjusted_sounds = adjust_sound_levels(selected_sounds, energy_levels, user_profile)

  // Spatialization
  spatialized_sounds = spatialize_sounds(adjusted_sounds)

  // Output to speaker array
  output_to_speaker_array(spatialized_sounds)
```

*   **Speaker Array Configuration:** Speakers should be positioned to create a wide soundstage and minimize localization cues. Consider using directional speakers to focus the sound in specific areas.
*   **DSP Requirements:** The DSP must be capable of real-time audio processing, including FFT analysis, sound synthesis, and spatialization algorithms.
*   **Potential Applications:** Noise cancellation, immersive audio experiences, productivity enhancement, therapeutic applications (e.g., masking tinnitus).
