## Predictive Leakage Mapping via Acoustic Emission & AI

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple flood/freeze *detection* to *predictive* leakage mapping using a network of micro-acoustic emission sensors embedded within building materials and connected to a localized AI for pattern recognition.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Network:** Deploy a dense network of MEMS-based acoustic emission sensors (piezoelectric) embedded within drywall, flooring underlayment, or even concrete during construction. Sensor density: 1 sensor per 0.5mÂ². Sensors should be capable of detecting acoustic emissions in the 20Hz-100kHz range.
*   **Sensor Node Hardware:** Each sensor node will include:
    *   MEMS acoustic emission sensor.
    *   Low-power, wide-dynamic range ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter).
    *   Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) with wireless communication (LoRaWAN, Zigbee, or Wi-Fi).
    *   Battery (rechargeable via inductive charging or energy harvesting).
    *   Encapsulation: Waterproof and structurally integrated with building material.
*   **Gateway:** A central gateway collects data from all sensor nodes.
    *   High-bandwidth wireless communication.
    *   Edge computing capabilities for pre-processing data.
    *   Connection to cloud-based AI platform.
*   **AI Platform:** Cloud-based AI for anomaly detection and leakage mapping.
    *   **Data Ingestion:** Real-time streaming of acoustic emission data from gateways.
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from acoustic emission signals (e.g., energy, frequency content, time-frequency analysis).
    *   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to learn the baseline acoustic signature of the building.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify deviations from the baseline signature, indicating potential leaks or structural weaknesses. Utilize clustering algorithms (e.g., k-means) to identify spatial patterns of anomalies.
    *   **Leakage Mapping:** Create a 3D map of the building, visualizing the location and severity of potential leaks. Display the map on a user-friendly interface (web or mobile app).
*   **Calibration & Baseline Establishment:** During initial setup, the system learns the baseline acoustic signature of the building. This process involves recording acoustic emissions under normal conditions (e.g., no leaks, no significant vibrations).
*   **Alerting System:** When a potential leak is detected, the system sends an alert to the user (e.g., email, SMS, mobile app notification). The alert includes the location of the leak, its severity, and recommended actions.
*   **Data Visualization:** Provide a comprehensive data visualization dashboard for monitoring the health of the building. The dashboard should include:
    *   Real-time acoustic emission data.
    *   Leakage map.
    *   Historical data.
    *   Alert logs.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Data stream from sensor network
sensorData = getSensorDataStream()

// Pre-process data (noise filtering, normalization)
preprocessedData = preprocess(sensorData)

// Feature extraction
features = extractFeatures(preprocessedData)

// Load trained LSTM model
model = loadModel("leakDetectionModel.h5")

// Predict anomaly score
anomalyScore = predict(model, features)

// Define anomaly threshold
threshold = 0.8

// Check if anomaly score exceeds threshold
if anomalyScore > threshold:
  // Flag as potential leak
  leakDetected = True
  // Get sensor location
  sensorLocation = getSensorLocation(sensorId)
  // Send alert
  sendAlert(sensorLocation, anomalyScore)
else:
  leakDetected = False
```
