## Adaptive Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Collision Avoidance System

**Concept:** Expand the spatial awareness of the core patent by building a continuously updated 3D reconstruction of the environment. This reconstruction is not merely for identification, but for *prediction* â€“ anticipating object trajectories and providing proactive collision avoidance, particularly for dynamic objects.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Camera Array:** Integrate a minimum of four synchronized cameras with overlapping fields of view. Cameras should support high frame rates (60+ fps) and have rolling shutter minimization for dynamic scene capture. Baseline inter-camera distance: 15-20cm.
*   **Depth Sensor:** Integrate a short-range LiDAR or Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor to augment camera data with precise depth information, especially in low-texture environments.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** High-precision IMU for accurate pose estimation of the wearable device. Sample rate: 200Hz+.
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** A dedicated processor (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano or similar) to handle real-time processing of camera, depth, and IMU data. Minimum RAM: 8GB. Storage: 256GB SSD.
*   **Wireless Communication:**  High-bandwidth, low-latency Wi-Fi 6E or 5G connectivity for potential cloud-based augmentation and data logging.

**II. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Sensor Fusion Module:**  
    *   Input: Camera images, depth data, IMU data.
    *   Process: Utilize a Kalman filter or similar state estimation technique to fuse sensor data and estimate the wearable device's pose (position and orientation) with high accuracy.
2.  **3D Reconstruction Module:**
    *   Input: Calibrated camera images and depth data.
    *   Process: Implement a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to build a dense 3D point cloud representation of the environment. Consider using a rolling window approach to maintain a manageable memory footprint.
    *   Output: A continuously updated 3D point cloud.
3.  **Object Tracking & Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: 3D point cloud, object identities (from existing patent), and IMU data.
    *   Process: Utilize object tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filtering, Particle filtering) to estimate the position, velocity, and acceleration of identified objects. Implement predictive models (e.g., linear extrapolation, polynomial regression) to forecast object trajectories.
4.  **Collision Detection & Avoidance Module:**
    *   Input: Predicted object trajectories, wearable device pose, and a customizable safety margin.
    *   Process: Continuously check for potential collisions between the wearable device and predicted object trajectories.  
        *   Generate alerts (visual, auditory, haptic) to the user.
        *   Optionally, provide suggested avoidance maneuvers (e.g., slight course correction, speed adjustment).
5.  **Scene Semantic Understanding Module:**
    *   Input: 3D point cloud and visual data
    *   Process: Implement algorithms to categorize environmental objects and their roles.
    *   Output: Data points about the scene (e.g. 'stairs ahead', 'doorway to the left', 'pedestrian approaching')

**III. Pseudocode (Collision Avoidance):**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Get sensor data
  sensorData = getSensorData();

  // Update 3D Reconstruction
  reconstruct3D(sensorData);

  // Identify & Track Objects
  objects = trackObjects();

  // Predict Object Trajectories
  predictedTrajectories = predictTrajectories(objects);

  // Check for Collisions
  for each (trajectory in predictedTrajectories) {
    if (trajectoryIntersects(trajectory, wearableDevicePose, safetyMargin)) {
      // Generate Alert
      generateAlert(collisionWarning);

      // Suggest Avoidance Maneuver
      suggestAvoidanceManeuver();
    }
  }
}
```

**IV. Advanced Features:**

*   **Cloud-Based Mapping:**  Leverage cloud computing to store and share environmental maps, enabling collaborative mapping and improved accuracy.
*   **Augmented Reality Overlay:**  Project predicted trajectories and safety zones onto the user's field of view using AR glasses or a heads-up display.
*   **Learned Avoidance Strategies:**  Utilize machine learning to analyze user responses to alerts and optimize avoidance maneuvers for different scenarios.
