## Dynamic Code Coverage Weighting based on Module Interdependence

**Specification:** A system and method for dynamically weighting code coverage metrics based on identified interdependencies between software modules.

**Rationale:** The provided patent focuses on *achieving* coverage thresholds for promotion. This system expands that by recognizing that not all code is created equal. Code in highly interdependent modules should contribute *more* to the overall "quality" score than isolated code, even if both meet basic coverage criteria. This encourages more thorough testing of critical system components.

**Components:**

*   **Dependency Graph Generator:**  A component that analyzes source code, commit history, and runtime behavior to construct a dependency graph. Nodes are software modules. Edges represent dependencies (e.g., function calls, data sharing, message passing). Weighting of edges reflects the *strength* of the dependency (e.g., number of calls, amount of data transferred).
*   **Coverage Data Aggregator:**  Receives code coverage data (line, branch, function coverage) from testing. Identifies the module associated with each coverage report.
*   **Weighted Coverage Calculator:** This is the core of the system. It combines the coverage data with the dependency graph.  For each module:
    1.  Determine the module's "influence score" based on its position in the dependency graph. This could be calculated using PageRank, centrality measures, or similar graph algorithms. Higher influence = more critical.
    2.  Multiply the module’s coverage percentage by its influence score. This yields a “weighted coverage score.”
    3.  Aggregate the weighted coverage scores for *all* modules to produce an overall system quality score.
*   **Promotion Engine:**  Compares the overall system quality score (and potentially individual module weighted scores) to promotion criteria.  Adjusts promotion thresholds dynamically based on the complexity and interdependence of the system.
* **Historical Coverage Database:** Stores coverage reports and dependency graphs over time to enable trend analysis and identify areas of increasing or decreasing risk.



**Pseudocode (Weighted Coverage Calculation):**

```
// Input:
//   coverage_data: Map of module_id -> coverage_percentage (0-100)
//   dependency_graph: Graph data structure representing module dependencies
//   influence_scores: Map of module_id -> influence_score (calculated from dependency graph)

function calculate_weighted_coverage(coverage_data, influence_scores):

  weighted_coverage_scores = {}
  total_weighted_coverage = 0.0

  for module_id, coverage_percentage in coverage_data.items():
    if module_id in influence_scores:
      weighted_coverage = coverage_percentage * influence_scores[module_id]
      weighted_coverage_scores[module_id] = weighted_coverage
      total_weighted_coverage += weighted_coverage
    else:
      // Handle modules not in the dependency graph (e.g., isolated modules)
      weighted_coverage_scores[module_id] = coverage_percentage
      total_weighted_coverage += coverage_percentage

  // Normalize to a system-wide score (optional)
  system_quality_score = total_weighted_coverage / number_of_modules

  return system_quality_score, weighted_coverage_scores
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Automated Dependency Graph Generation:** Investigate techniques for automatically generating and maintaining accurate dependency graphs from source code, build systems, and runtime telemetry.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  Develop algorithms for dynamically adjusting promotion thresholds based on the system's overall complexity and the criticality of the modules involved.
*   **Integration with CI/CD Pipelines:**  Seamlessly integrate the system into existing CI/CD pipelines to provide real-time feedback on code quality and promotion readiness.
*   **Predictive Coverage Analysis**: Utilize machine learning to predict likely coverage gaps based on dependency graph structure and historical coverage data, suggesting specific tests to run.
