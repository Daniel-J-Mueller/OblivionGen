## Dynamic Data Capsule Generation & Federated Access

**Concept:** Expand the “export file type definition” to encompass not just *what* data is shared, but *how* it’s processed and presented on the receiving end – creating self-contained ‘Data Capsules’.  These Capsules aren’t just files, but instructions for rendering and interacting with the data. Introduce a federated access layer leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to enable controlled data sharing *without* revealing the underlying data itself.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Capsule Format:**

*   **Core:**  A JSON schema defining the data structure, rendering instructions (UI components, charting libraries, etc.), and access control policies.
*   **Data Payload:**  The actual data, compressed and encrypted.
*   **Rendering Engine Specification:**  Identifies the required rendering engine – a sandboxed execution environment (e.g., WebAssembly module) providing the necessary tools to interpret the rendering instructions.
*   **Metadata:** Versioning, author, creation date, cryptographic hash for integrity.

**2. Capsule Generation Process:**

*   **API:** `generateCapsule(data, renderingProfile, accessPolicy)`
*   **Rendering Profile Selection:** Predefined or customizable profiles dictating how data is visualized (e.g., “Interactive 3D Chart,” “Document Viewer,” “AR Overlay”).
*   **Access Policy Definition:** Granular controls over who can access the Capsule, what they can do with it (view, edit, export), and for how long. Based on cryptographic access tokens.

**3. Federated Access Layer:**

*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):**  Instead of sharing the data directly, applications generate ZKPs demonstrating they meet specific access criteria (e.g., “User is authorized to view sales data for region X”).
*   **Access Token Exchange:** Applications exchange access tokens, verified by a central authority or through a distributed ledger, to prove their legitimacy.
*   **Encrypted Capsule Delivery:** The Capsule is delivered in an encrypted form, accessible only with the correct decryption key (obtained after successful ZKP verification).

**4.  Rendering Engine Architecture:**

*   **Sandboxing:** Capsules run within a sandboxed environment, preventing malicious code from compromising the system.
*   **Plugin System:**  Allows developers to extend the rendering engine with custom UI components, charting libraries, and data processing tools.
*   **Remote Rendering:** Option to offload rendering to a remote server, reducing the load on the client device.

**Pseudocode (Capsule Generation):**

```
function generateCapsule(data, renderingProfile, accessPolicy) {

  // Validate input parameters

  // Create JSON schema based on renderingProfile

  // Encrypt data

  // Create Capsule metadata

  // Serialize Capsule data into a single file (e.g., .dcp – Data Capsule Package)

  // Sign Capsule with creator’s private key

  return capsuleFile;
}
```

**Pseudocode (Access Request):**

```
function requestAccess(capsuleFile, userCredentials) {

  // Verify Capsule signature

  // Generate ZKP demonstrating user meets access criteria defined in accessPolicy

  // Send ZKP to Capsule provider

  // If ZKP is valid, Capsule provider sends decryption key

  // Decrypt Capsule data

  // Render data using rendering engine
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Secure data sharing in healthcare:** Patients control access to their medical records, proving specific attributes (e.g., “has allergy X”) without revealing their entire history.
*   **Financial data privacy:**  Credit agencies verify income levels without accessing detailed bank statements.
*   **Supply chain transparency:** Companies share product origin data while preserving competitive information.
*   **Interactive AR/VR Experiences:** Share complex 3D models and scenes with specific rendering instructions for immersive experiences.
