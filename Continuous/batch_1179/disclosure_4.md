## Adaptive Predictive Gaze Correction System

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the concept of orientation determination by proactively predicting gaze direction *before* capturing an image, and dynamically adjusting capture parameters to optimize for accurate facial recognition, even with significant head movement or non-frontal viewing angles. It moves beyond reactive selection of 'good' frames to *creating* optimal capture conditions.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Spectral Sensor Array:** Includes standard RGB camera, depth sensor (ToF or structured light), and near-infrared (NIR) illuminator/camera. Crucially, adds a micro-Doppler radar module.
2.  **Predictive Gaze Engine (PGE):** A machine learning model trained on a diverse dataset of head movements, eye tracking data, and facial expressions. This is the core innovation. It predicts gaze direction based on initial sensor input.
3.  **Dynamic Capture Control (DCC):** Software module that controls camera settings (focus, exposure, aperture), IR illumination intensity, and active stabilization mechanisms (gimbal or digital image stabilization) in real-time.
4.  **Biofeedback Integration (Optional):** Uses subtle physiological signals (e.g., electromyography from facial muscles, galvanic skin response) to refine gaze prediction and anticipate intentional head movements.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Initial Acquisition:** System detects a potential subject (motion, heat signature).
2.  **Pre-Capture Scan:** Low-resolution scan using RGB, depth, and micro-Doppler radar. The radar module detects subtle movements and breathing patterns, providing an early indication of head position and potential movement.
3.  **Gaze Prediction:** PGE analyzes the initial scan data and *predicts* the subject's gaze direction. It doesnâ€™t wait for the subject to look at the camera; it anticipates where they *will* look.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** DCC adjusts camera settings and stabilization systems *before* capturing a full-resolution image:
    *   **Focus/Aperture:** Pre-adjusted to maximize depth of field around the predicted gaze point.
    *   **IR Illumination:** Intensity adjusted based on ambient lighting and predicted gaze angle to enhance eye detection.
    *   **Stabilization:** Activated to compensate for predicted head movement.
5.  **Capture:** A high-resolution image is captured with optimized settings.
6.  **Refinement Loop:**  Initial facial recognition attempts are made on the captured image. If the recognition fails or is low confidence, the PGE re-analyzes the data, refines its prediction, and initiates another dynamic adjustment/capture cycle.

**Pseudocode (PGE - Simplified):**

```
function predictGazeDirection(sensorData):
  # sensorData includes RGB image, depth map, micro-Doppler data, biofeedback (if available)

  # Feature Extraction
  headPose = estimateHeadPose(sensorData.depthMap)
  microMotion = analyzeMicroDoppler(sensorData.microDopplerData) # Detects subtle head movements
  facialFeatures = detectFacialFeatures(sensorData.RGBImage)

  # Prediction Model (e.g., LSTM neural network)
  predictedGaze = LSTMModel.predict(headPose, microMotion, facialFeatures)

  return predictedGaze # Returns 3D coordinates of predicted gaze point
```
