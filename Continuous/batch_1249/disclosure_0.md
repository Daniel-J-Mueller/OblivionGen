## Dynamic Template Stitching for Polyglot Service Orchestration

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Extend the template-based response generation to *stitch* together fragments of templates from *different* versions of a service, dynamically assembling a response tailored to a client's capabilities and the specific operation requested. This moves beyond simply *selecting* a version-specific template to *composing* a response from multiple versions.

**II. Components:**

*   **Template Repository:** A database storing template fragments. Fragments are tagged with:
    *   Service Version
    *   Operation Name
    *   Data Element (e.g., "user_name", "account_balance")
    *   Data Type (e.g., String, Integer, JSON)
    *   Response Section (e.g., "header", "body", "footer")
    *   Client Capability (e.g. "supports_json", "requires_xml")

*   **Request Analyzer:**  Identifies the requested operation, the client's declared capabilities (via headers or other mechanisms), and the requested service version (if specified).

*   **Template Composer:** The core engine.
    *   Receives output from the Request Analyzer.
    *   Queries the Template Repository for relevant fragments, prioritizing fragments matching the client's capabilities and requested version.  If a direct match isnâ€™t found, it searches for compatible fragments (e.g., a JSON fragment is compatible with a client that supports JSON, even if the version differs).
    *   Constructs a composite template by assembling the selected fragments based on Response Section tags.
    *   Handles fragment conflicts (e.g., multiple fragments defining the same data element) using a configurable priority scheme (version priority, capability priority, or user-defined rules).

*   **Data Populator:**  Populates the composite template with data from the appropriate data sources, as specified in the template metadata.

**III.  Workflow:**

1.  Client sends a request.
2.  Request Analyzer extracts operation name, client capabilities, and requested version.
3.  Template Composer queries the Template Repository.
4.  Template Composer assembles a composite template.
5.  Data Populator fills the composite template with data.
6.  System sends the generated response to the client.

**IV. Pseudocode (Template Composer):**

```pseudocode
function ComposeTemplate(operationName, clientCapabilities, requestedVersion):
    fragmentList = QueryTemplateRepository(operationName, clientCapabilities, requestedVersion)

    # Prioritize fragments (version, capability, custom rules)
    sortedFragments = SortFragments(fragmentList)

    compositeTemplate = CreateEmptyTemplate()

    for fragment in sortedFragments:
        if fragment.ResponseSection == "header":
            compositeTemplate.header += fragment.content
        elif fragment.ResponseSection == "body":
            compositeTemplate.body += fragment.content
        elif fragment.ResponseSection == "footer":
            compositeTemplate.footer += fragment.content

    return compositeTemplate
```

**V.  Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Flexibility:**  Adapt responses to different clients and versions without maintaining entirely separate templates.
*   **Reduced Template Maintenance:**  Focus on creating reusable fragments rather than complete templates.
*   **Faster Development:**  Easily integrate new features and support new versions by adding or modifying fragments.
*   **Improved Client Experience:** Provide responses tailored to each client's specific capabilities and preferences.
