## Adaptive Context Isolation via Dynamically Reconfigurable Translation Units

**Concept:** Extend the IOMMU’s context switching capability with hardware that allows *partial* context pre-loading and dynamic reconfiguration of the translation unit itself, enabling finer-grained isolation and performance improvements. The existing system relies on pre-loading the *entire* translation cache. This proposal creates a system capable of only pre-loading sections or ‘slices’ of the translation map relevant to the switching context, and then dynamically reconfiguring the translation unit's hardware to reflect the active context's translation rules.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Slice Controller:** A dedicated hardware block responsible for managing translation map slices. It divides the overall address space into configurable slices (e.g., 16MB, 32MB, etc.). Each slice holds a portion of the complete translation table.
*   **Translation Unit (TU) Reconfiguration Engine:** This engine allows dynamic rewiring of the translation unit's internal logic. It can selectively enable/disable specific translation rules (page table entries) within the TU based on the active context and slice configuration.  This could utilize a configurable interconnect network within the TU itself.
*   **Context Metadata Store:** Stores metadata about each context, including which slices are active for that context and any custom translation rules applied. This could be a small, fast SRAM.
*   **Hardware Translation Cache (HTC):**  The existing HTC is retained, but its effective size is managed in conjunction with the Slice Controller and TU Reconfiguration Engine.
*   **MMIO Interface:**  Standard MMIO interface for configuration and control of the Slice Controller, Context Metadata Store, and TU Reconfiguration Engine.

**2. Operation:**

*   **Context Creation:** When a new context is created, the system administrator defines which slices are allocated to that context.  The Context Metadata Store is updated to reflect this allocation.
*   **Context Switching:**  Instead of pre-loading the entire HTC, the Slice Controller only loads the translations corresponding to the active slices into the HTC. This significantly reduces the context switching overhead.
*   **Address Translation:** When an address is translated:
    1.  The system checks the active context.
    2.  It determines which slice the address falls within.
    3.  The TU Reconfiguration Engine dynamically configures the translation unit to use the appropriate translation rules for that slice.
    4.  The translation proceeds as normal, utilizing the pre-loaded translations in the HTC.
*   **Dynamic Slice Adjustment:**  The system should allow dynamic resizing or reallocation of slices during runtime. This is achieved by updating the Context Metadata Store and reconfiguring the TU accordingly.
*   **Fine-Grained Permissions:** The Slice Controller will support configuring individual slices with different permission flags (read-only, execute-only, etc.).

**3. Pseudocode (Context Switch):**

```
function context_switch(old_context, new_context):
  // 1. Retrieve slice configuration for new_context from Context Metadata Store
  slice_config = get_slice_config(new_context)

  // 2. Disable translation rules associated with old_context in the TU
  disable_translation_rules(old_context)

  // 3. Load translations for active slices of new_context into HTC
  for each slice in slice_config:
    load_translations(slice, new_context)

  // 4. Enable translation rules associated with new_context in the TU
  enable_translation_rules(new_context)

  // 5. Update active context register
  set_active_context(new_context)
```

**4.  Interrupt Handling:**

*   Interrupts can be assigned to specific slices, allowing for isolation of interrupt sources.
*   The Slice Controller will filter interrupts based on the active context and slice configuration.



**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond simple cache pre-loading to a dynamically reconfigurable translation unit, enabling finer-grained isolation, reduced context switching overhead, and potentially improved performance. The ability to assign interrupts to slices adds another layer of security and control. This isn't merely faster; it fundamentally alters how memory isolation is handled.
