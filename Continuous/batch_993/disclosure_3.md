## Adaptive Aerodynamic Fin System - "MorphWing"

**Concept:** Implement actively morphing aerodynamic fins around the UAV body, dynamically adjusting shape and orientation for enhanced maneuverability and efficiency beyond propeller-based control. These fins will operate in conjunction with, *not as a replacement for*, the existing dual-propeller system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Fin Quantity:** 4 (arranged symmetrically around the UAV body – fore, aft, port, starboard)
*   **Fin Material:** Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) composite with embedded carbon fiber for structural rigidity. SMP allows for programmed deformation based on electrical current.
*   **Actuation:** Each fin will be controlled by a network of miniature, high-precision servo motors and heating elements embedded within the SMP. These actuators will independently control fin curvature and angular orientation.
*   **Sensing:** Each fin incorporates:
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – to track fin orientation and acceleration.
    *   Pressure sensors – to measure airflow over the fin surface, providing feedback for optimal shaping.
    *   Strain gauges – to monitor SMP deformation and ensure structural integrity.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated processor (“FinController”) will manage the fin actuation, utilizing data from the sensors and input from the primary UAV flight controller.
*   **Communication:** FinController communicates with the UAV flight controller via a high-speed SPI bus.
*   **Power:** Dedicated power supply for FinController and fin actuators, separate from the primary UAV power system.

**Operation & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Initialization:** At startup, the FinController runs a self-calibration routine, establishing baseline fin positions and sensor readings.
2.  **Flight Mode Integration:** The UAV flight controller transmits flight mode information (e.g., hover, forward flight, aggressive maneuver) to the FinController.
3.  **Adaptive Shaping:**
    *   **Hover Mode:** Fins maintain a slight upward deflection, creating a subtle downforce effect that enhances stability.
    *   **Forward Flight:** Fins transition to a streamlined profile, minimizing drag and contributing to lift.
    *   **Maneuver Mode:**  The FinController dynamically adjusts fin shapes and angles in response to pilot input or autonomous navigation commands. This will involve asynchronous operations.

    ```pseudocode
    FUNCTION adjust_fins(flight_mode, pilot_input, sensor_data)
        IF flight_mode == "hover" THEN
            SET fin_angle to 5 degrees upward
        ELSE IF flight_mode == "forward_flight" THEN
            SET fin_angle to 0 degrees
        ELSE IF flight_mode == "maneuver" THEN
            // Calculate desired fin adjustments based on pilot input and sensor data
            desired_angle = calculate_angle(pilot_input, sensor_data)
            SET fin_angle to desired_angle
        ENDIF

        // Apply PID control to ensure accurate fin positioning
        error = desired_angle - current_angle
        output = PID(error)
        SET servo_position to servo_position + output

    END FUNCTION

    FUNCTION calculate_angle(pilot_input, sensor_data)
        // Complex algorithm utilizing sensor data (IMU, pressure sensors)
        // and pilot input to determine optimal fin angles
        // This algorithm will require extensive testing and tuning
        // Return desired fin angles for each fin
    END FUNCTION
    ```
4.  **Real-time Feedback:** The FinController continuously monitors sensor data and adjusts fin positions to maintain optimal performance.
5.  **Safety Features:**
    *   Emergency fin retraction mechanism (in case of actuator failure).
    *   Fail-safe mode – fins revert to a neutral position.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased maneuverability, especially at low speeds.
*   Improved energy efficiency.
*   Enhanced stability and control.
*   Reduced reliance on propeller thrust for maneuvering, allowing for finer control.
