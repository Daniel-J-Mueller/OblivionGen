## Adaptive Data Reconstruction with Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** A system to reconstruct data fragments across tiered storage, proactively anticipating data access needs based on incomplete data availability.

**Concept Origin:** The patent details mention transparent storage tiering and transferring data *after* access patterns are observed. This system flips that – initiating reconstruction *during* access, using predictive algorithms to prefetch missing fragments.

**System Components:**

1.  **Fragmentor:** Divides files into fixed or variable-sized fragments.  Metadata tracking fragment location is crucial.
2.  **Tiered Storage Manager:** Manages multiple storage tiers (SSD, HDD, Object Storage, etc.). Responsible for fragment placement and retrieval.
3.  **Access Pattern Predictor:** Machine learning model trained on file access patterns (sequence of fragment requests).  Outputs probability distribution of likely next fragments to be accessed.
4.  **Reconstruction Engine:**  Assembles requested fragments.  If a fragment is missing, it initiates a prefetch request *before* the client experiences latency.
5.  **Prefetch Coordinator:**  Manages prefetch requests, prioritizing based on predictive score and network bandwidth. Implements a 'graceful degradation' strategy – if prefetch fails, fallback to standard retrieval.
6.  **Dynamic Fragment Resizing:**  Analyzes access patterns. Frequently accessed fragments are dynamically resized to smaller units to improve prefetching accuracy. Infrequently accessed fragments are combined into larger units.

**Pseudocode – Reconstruction Engine:**

```
function reconstruct_fragment(request_id, fragment_id):
  fragment_data = storage_manager.get_fragment(fragment_id)
  if fragment_data == null:
    prediction = access_pattern_predictor.predict_next_fragments(request_id)
    if prediction.confidence > threshold:
      prefetch_coordinator.prefetch_fragment(prediction.fragment_id)
      // Wait for prefetch to complete (with timeout)
      fragment_data = storage_manager.get_fragment(prediction.fragment_id)
      if fragment_data == null:
        // Standard retrieval (from original location or replicate)
        fragment_data = standard_retrieval(fragment_id)
    else:
      // Standard retrieval (low confidence in prediction)
      fragment_data = standard_retrieval(fragment_id)
  return fragment_data
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **File Metadata:** `FileID, FragmentList, FragmentLocationMap, AccessHistory`
*   **Prediction Output:** `FragmentID, ConfidenceScore`

**Novelty:**  Existing systems react to missing data. This system *anticipates* missing data based on predicted access patterns.  The dynamic fragment resizing further optimizes prefetching accuracy, particularly for unpredictable access sequences.  This isn't about caching; it's about proactively assembling data *before* it's requested, minimizing latency even in tiered storage environments.
