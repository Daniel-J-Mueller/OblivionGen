## Distributed Predictive Caching with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the distributed storage system to incorporate a predictive caching layer that anticipates data access based on temporal patterns and proactively caches replicas closer to likely access points. This moves beyond simple replication for redundancy and introduces intelligence to minimize latency.

**Specs:**

**1. Temporal Pattern Analyzer (TPA):**

*   **Input:** Access logs (namespace, key, timestamp) from the existing system.
*   **Function:** Employ time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to identify repeating access patterns.  Patterns are expressed as probabilities of access for a given key at a given time.
*   **Output:**  A "Temporal Access Profile" (TAP) for each key. TAP contains a weighted probability distribution of future access times.  The weighting incorporates confidence levels based on historical data consistency.
*   **Implementation:**  A microservice deployed alongside the keymap instance.  Uses a sliding window of access logs (configurable) for analysis.

**2. Predictive Cache Controller (PCC):**

*   **Input:** TAP from TPA, Current Time, Keymap (locator information).
*   **Function:**  
    *   Calculates a “Cache Priority Score” (CPS) for each key. CPS = (Probability of Access within a defined window) * (Data Size) * (Access Frequency).  The window size is configurable.
    *   Based on CPS, initiates “Proactive Replication”.  This creates additional replicas of frequently accessed data on storage nodes geographically closer to predicted access points.
    *   Implements a "Temporal Decay" mechanism.  Replicas created through proactive replication have an associated "Time to Live" (TTL) determined by the confidence level of the prediction. As confidence decreases (or time passes without access), the replica is automatically deleted.  TTL is configurable.
*   **Implementation:** A distributed service that communicates with storage nodes and the TPA. Uses a priority queue to manage proactive replication requests.

**3. Storage Node Enhancement:**

*   **Feature:** Add support for TTL-based replica management.
*   **Function:** Storage nodes monitor the TTL of replicas. When a TTL expires, the replica is automatically deleted.
*   **Implementation:**  Modifies the existing storage node software to include a background thread for TTL monitoring and deletion.

**Pseudocode (PCC):**

```
function process_access_logs(access_logs):
    for log in access_logs:
        key = log.key
        timestamp = log.timestamp
        TPA.update_profile(key, timestamp)

function calculate_cache_priority(key):
    tap = TPA.get_profile(key)
    probability = tap.probability_of_access_within_window()
    data_size = get_data_size(key)
    access_frequency = get_access_frequency(key)
    cps = probability * data_size * access_frequency
    return cps

function proactive_replication(key):
    cps = calculate_cache_priority(key)
    if cps > threshold:
        best_node = find_closest_node(predicted_access_location)
        create_replica(key, best_node)
        set_ttl(key, predicted_confidence)

function cleanup_expired_replicas():
    for key in keymap:
        if replica.ttl_expired():
            delete_replica(key)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Temporal Access Profile (TAP):**  {Key: String, Probability Distribution: [Timestamp: Float], Confidence Level: Float}
*   **Cache Priority Score (CPS):**  Float.

**Scalability:**

*   TPA can be horizontally scaled using a distributed message queue (e.g., Kafka) to handle high volumes of access logs.
*   PCC can be distributed across multiple nodes, each responsible for managing a subset of keys.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency for frequently accessed data.
*   Improved user experience.
*   Optimized storage utilization.
*   Proactive caching adapts to changing access patterns.
