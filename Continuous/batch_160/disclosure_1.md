## Dynamic Psychoacoustic Masking Profile for Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Instead of solely focusing on overall loudness equalization, create a system that dynamically adjusts gain *per frequency band* and *per spatial location* based on psychoacoustic masking principles and perceived source direction. This system doesn't just make things equally loud, it makes them *perceived* as equally loud, leveraging how the human ear naturally suppresses quieter sounds masked by louder ones.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-channel audio signal (minimum stereo, ideally 5.1 or higher), with associated spatial metadata (pan positions, HRTF data, or ambisonics).
*   **Processing Blocks:**
    *   **Spectral Analysis:** Perform a short-time Fourier transform (STFT) on each channel to obtain frequency-domain representation.
    *   **Spatial Decomposition:** Decompose the audio into spatial 'sources' based on pan/HRTF data. For example, in a stereo setup, left and right channels could be treated as individual sources. In ambisonics, decompose into spherical harmonics.
    *   **Masking Threshold Calculation:** For *each* frequency band and *each* spatial source:
        *   Determine the masking threshold based on the energy of the *strongest* frequencies within a critical band (following ISO 226:2003 or similar standard).
        *   Apply a directional masking function - sounds originating from the same direction are more easily masked. Modulate the masking threshold based on angular separation between sounds. Smaller angles = lower threshold.
    *   **Gain Calculation:** Calculate the gain required for each frequency band and spatial source to reach the target loudness (determined by user setting). The gain is limited by the calculated masking threshold. If a frequency is already masked, little or no gain is applied.
    *   **Spatial Reconstitution:** Apply the calculated gains to each frequency band of its corresponding spatial source.
    *   **Inverse STFT:** Perform an inverse STFT to convert the processed signal back to the time domain.
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `Target Loudness`: User-adjustable parameter controlling the overall perceived loudness.
    *   `Masking Model`: Selectable masking model (e.g., ISO 226, A-weighting, custom).
    *   `Directional Masking Factor`: Adjustable parameter controlling the strength of directional masking.
    *   `Critical Band Resolution`: Adjustable parameter controlling the width of critical bands used in masking calculations.
*   **Output:** Multi-channel audio signal with dynamically adjusted gain per frequency band and spatial location.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: multi-channel audio, spatial metadata
// Output: processed multi-channel audio

for each channel:
    perform STFT -> frequency domain representation

for each spatial source:
    for each frequency band:
        calculate masking threshold based on strongest frequencies in critical band
        calculate directional masking factor based on spatial separation
        calculate target gain based on user setting and current energy
        apply gain, limited by masking threshold and directional masking factor

perform inverse STFT -> time domain representation
output processed audio
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   More natural and immersive listening experience.
*   Improved clarity and detail in complex audio mixes.
*   Reduced listener fatigue.
*   Potential for intelligent audio compression/bandwidth reduction (by exploiting masking effects).
*   Adaptation to different listening environments.
