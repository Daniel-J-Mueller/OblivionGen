**Dynamic Player Archetype Generation & Session Morphing**

**Concept:** Expand beyond static behavior/preference matching to *dynamically* generate player archetypes *during* a game session and morph the session itself based on emergent player interactions. This isn't about *finding* compatible players; it's about *creating* a compatible experience *as* players interact.

**Specs:**

1.  **Real-time Behavior Vectorization:** Each player's in-game actions are continuously fed into a behavior vector. This vector isn’t pre-defined; it evolves. Key actions (combat style, resource gathering, social interaction frequency, objective focus, etc.) contribute to the vector's dimensions.  A rolling average/decay function is applied to prevent instantaneous shifts due to isolated actions.

    ```pseudocode
    function updateBehaviorVector(player, action, timestamp):
      //action is a string representing the in-game action
      //timestamp is the current game time

      //Define the contribution weight based on action type
      weight = getActionWeight(action)

      //Apply decay to previous values
      player.behaviorVector = decayVector(player.behaviorVector, 0.01) //0.01 is a decay rate

      //Update relevant dimensions
      player.behaviorVector[actionDimension] += weight * (1 - player.behaviorVector[actionDimension]) //Smooth increase

    ```

2.  **Archetype Synthesis:**  A clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN) operates on the behavior vectors of all active players, *in real-time*. This creates dynamic archetypes (e.g., “Aggressive Leader,” “Supportive Protector,” “Cautious Explorer”).  The number of archetypes isn’t fixed; it adjusts based on player distribution. A minimum archetype size is enforced to prevent overly granular/unstable clusters.

    ```pseudocode
    function synthesizeArchetypes(playerList, minArchetypeSize):
      //Collect behavior vectors
      vectors = [player.behaviorVector for player in playerList]

      //Apply clustering algorithm
      clusters = applyClustering(vectors, desiredNumberOfClusters)

      //Filter clusters based on size
      validClusters = [cluster for cluster in clusters if len(cluster) >= minArchetypeSize]

      //Assign archetypes
      archetypes = generateArchetypeNames(validClusters) //Archetype name generator based on cluster characteristics

      return archetypes
    ```

3.  **Session Morphing Engine:** This engine monitors archetype distribution and initiates changes to the game session. This includes:
    *   **Dynamic Objective Generation:**  New objectives appear or existing ones shift to cater to the dominant archetypes.  For example, if “Aggressive Leaders” are prevalent, more competitive objectives are introduced. If “Supportive Protectors” are common, objectives requiring cooperation and defense are prioritized.
    *   **Environmental Adaptation:**  The game environment changes dynamically.  A map favoring ranged combat might shift to a more enclosed space if “Aggressive Leaders” are dominating, or it might open up if “Cautious Explorers” are abundant.  Resource distribution can also be adjusted.
    *   **NPC Behavior Modification:** NPC actions and roles are altered to complement the archetype distribution. If “Supportive Protectors” are common, NPCs might be more inclined to request assistance.
    *   **Temporary Alliances/Rivalries:** The engine can subtly nudge players toward alliances or rivalries based on archetype compatibility/conflict.

    ```pseudocode
    function morphSession(archetypeDistribution):
      //Calculate archetype weights
      weights = calculateArchetypeWeights(archetypeDistribution)

      //Generate/Modify Objectives
      newObjectives = generateObjectives(weights)
      applyObjectives(newObjectives)

      //Adapt Environment
      newEnvironment = adaptEnvironment(weights)
      applyEnvironment(newEnvironment)

      //Modify NPC behavior
      newNPCBehavior = modifyNPCBehavior(weights)
      applyNPCBehavior(newNPCBehavior)

      //Adjust Alliances/Rivalries (subtle nudges)
      adjustRelationships(weights)
    ```

4.  **Player Role Assignment (Optional):**  Based on the archetype synthesis, players can be subtly assigned roles within the session (e.g., “Leader,” “Scout,” “Defender”). This isn’t explicit; it’s conveyed through objective design and NPC interactions.

5.  **Session History & Learning:** The system records session data (archetype evolution, morphing events, player responses). This data is used to train a reinforcement learning model to optimize the morphing engine over time.  The goal is to create sessions that are consistently engaging and enjoyable for diverse player groups.



This isn't about *matching* players; it's about creating an experience that *adapts* to them.  The system constantly analyzes and adjusts to ensure that players are engaged and challenged, regardless of their initial preferences.
