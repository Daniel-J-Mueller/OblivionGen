## Adaptive Resource Masking via Dynamic Shell Composition

**Concept:** Extend the permissioning system to dynamically construct shell environments at runtime, layering restrictions *on top* of base OS access, and tailoring those layers based on real-time risk assessment. This goes beyond simply limiting commands a user *can* execute, to actively shaping *how* they interact with the system.

**Specification:**

1.  **Risk Engine Integration:** Integrate a risk engine that analyzes user behavior (commands entered, data accessed, time of access, network activity) *during* a remote session. This engine assigns a real-time risk score.

2.  **Shell Composition Layers:** Design a system where shells aren’t launched as monolithic entities, but are built from layers. These layers are configurable modules that intercept and modify shell behavior. Examples:
    *   **Input Filter:**  Examines commands before execution, applying pre-defined rules (e.g., blocking `rm -rf /`).
    *   **Output Redactor:** Sanitizes output to prevent sensitive data leakage.
    *   **Command Aliaser:**  Automatically rewrites commands to use safer alternatives (e.g., `ls -l` becomes `ls -la` with restricted flags).
    *   **Network Proxy:** Forces all network traffic from the shell through a monitored proxy.
    *   **File System Virtualizer:** Presents a virtualized file system, hiding sensitive files or directories.

3.  **Dynamic Layer Application:** The risk engine dynamically adds, removes, or modifies shell layers based on the user's real-time risk score. Higher risk = more restrictive layers. Layer changes are applied *without* interrupting the ongoing session.

4.  **Layer Configuration API:** Provide an API to define and manage shell layers.  This allows administrators to create custom layers to address specific security concerns.  Layers should be modular and reusable.

5.  **Layer Metadata:** Each layer should include metadata describing its purpose, impact on performance, and required privileges. This metadata informs the risk engine’s decision-making process.

**Pseudocode (Risk Engine Logic):**

```
function assess_risk(user_activity):
  risk_score = 0

  if user_activity.command contains "rm -rf /":
    risk_score += 100
  if user_activity.data_access contains sensitive_data:
    risk_score += 50
  if user_activity.network_activity.destination == external_host:
    risk_score += 30

  return risk_score

function apply_layers(risk_score):
  layers = []

  if risk_score > 80:
    layers.append(InputFilter(strict_mode=True))
    layers.append(OutputRedactor())
  elif risk_score > 50:
    layers.append(InputFilter(moderate_mode=True))
  # More conditions for adding/removing layers

  return layers

# Main loop
while remote_session_active:
  user_activity = get_user_activity()
  risk_score = assess_risk(user_activity)
  layers = apply_layers(risk_score)

  # Dynamically apply layers to the shell
  shell.apply_layers(layers)

  # Process user input
  shell.process_input()
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Operating System with robust process isolation capabilities (e.g., Linux with namespaces and cgroups).
*   Containerization technology (e.g., Docker) for isolating shell layers.
*   Real-time monitoring and analytics platform.
*   API Gateway for managing layer configuration.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security through dynamic, context-aware permissioning.
*   Reduced attack surface by limiting user access to only necessary resources.
*   Improved auditability and compliance.
*   Adaptability to changing threat landscape.
