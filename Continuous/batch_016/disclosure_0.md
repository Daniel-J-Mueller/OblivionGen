## Autonomous Item Reconciliation & Predictive Restocking – ‘Project Nightingale’

**System Overview:** This system extends item tracking *beyond* simple location and agent association. It aims to proactively identify discrepancies *before* they impact fulfillment, and initiate automated restocking requests based on predictive modeling of tote contents.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced RFID/UWB Tagging:** All items receive a combined RFID/UWB tag. RFID for broad identification, UWB for precise location tracking *within* a tote and for density assessment.
*   **Tote-Integrated Computational Unit (TICU):** Each tote contains a low-power, edge-computing device (Raspberry Pi equivalent). This handles local data processing, UWB signal analysis, and communication with the central system.
*   **High-Density Reader Arrays:** Reader arrays positioned *above* conveyor belts and in ‘transition zones’ (receiving/shipping areas). These provide high-resolution scans of tote contents.
*   **Drone-Based Inventory Verification:** Small, autonomous drones equipped with RFID/UWB readers and cameras to conduct periodic inventory checks of totes and transition areas. This serves as a secondary verification layer.

**Software Components & Pseudocode:**

1.  **‘Content Mapping’ Module (TICU):**
    *   Continuously scans for UWB signals from items within the tote.
    *   Uses signal strength and triangulation to build a 3D ‘heat map’ of item distribution within the tote. This allows for density assessment – is the tote overfilled? Are items potentially damaged?
    *   Updates a local ‘content list’ with item IDs and approximate position data.
    *   Periodically transmits the content list and heat map to the central system.
    
    ```pseudocode
    function updateContentList()
    {
        scanUWBSignals()
        triangulateItemPositions()
        buildHeatMap()
        updateLocalContentList()
        transmitDataToCentralSystem()
    }
    ```

2.  **‘Reconciliation Engine’ (Central System):**
    *   Receives content lists from multiple TICUs.
    *   Compares the TICU-reported content list with the expected ‘tote item list’ from the Warehouse Management System (WMS).
    *   Identifies discrepancies – missing items, extra items, or items in the wrong quantity.
    *   Employs a Bayesian filtering algorithm to account for potential reading errors and signal interference.
    *   Initiates automated alerts for discrepancies exceeding a predefined threshold.
    
    ```pseudocode
    function reconcileToteContents(toteID, expectedItemList, actualItemList)
    {
        calculateDiscrepancyScore(expectedItemList, actualItemList)
        if (discrepancyScore > threshold)
        {
            generateAlert(toteID, discrepancyDetails)
            triggerInvestigationWorkflow() // e.g., assign to agent for manual verification
        }
        else
        {
            logSuccessfulReconciliation(toteID)
        }
    }
    ```

3.  **‘Predictive Restocking’ Module (Central System):**
    *   Analyzes historical tote content data.
    *   Identifies patterns and correlations between items.  (e.g., Item A is frequently paired with Item B).
    *   Predicts the likely contents of a tote based on its destination and historical data.
    *   Automatically generates restocking requests for items that are predicted to be low in stock.
    *   Integrates with the WMS to prioritize restocking tasks.

    ```pseudocode
    function predictToteContents(destination, historicalData)
    {
        calculateProbabilityOfEachItem(destination, historicalData)
        generatePredictedItemList(probabilityThreshold)
        comparePredictedItemListWithCurrentStockLevels()
        generateRestockRequestsIfNeeded()
    }
    ```

4.  **‘Drone Verification Workflow’:**
    *   Periodically sends drones to scan designated areas.
    *   Drone scans tote contents using RFID/UWB.
    *   Compares drone-scanned data with the centrally-maintained tote contents list.
    *   Highlights discrepancies for agent investigation.

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Discrepancy Detection:** Identifies issues *before* they reach the shipping dock.
*   **Predictive Restocking:** Reduces stockouts and improves order fulfillment rates.
*   **Real-Time Density Mapping:** Prevents damage to items during transit.
*   **Automated Drone Verification:** Provides an additional layer of inventory control.
