## Dynamic Inventory 'Shadowing' with Predictive User Action

**Concept:** Extend the user disambiguation system to *predict* user actions based on observed patterns and dynamically adjust inventory presentation (e.g., lighting, AR overlays) to facilitate efficient picking *before* an action is even initiated. This turns the system from reactive to proactive.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing antenna array/identifier readers (from patent).
    *   High-resolution, wide-angle cameras covering each inventory location. (RGB-D for depth sensing)
    *   Addressable LED lighting system per inventory location (color and intensity control).
    *   AR-capable headsets/tablets for pickers (optional, but enhances experience).
    *   Edge computing units at each inventory location to process camera/sensor data.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **User Tracking & Prediction Engine:**
        *   Input: User identifier (RFID/Visual), position data, historical pick data (items, frequency, routes), real-time task list.
        *   Process: Bayesian Network or LSTM-based model to predict the *next likely item* a user will pick.  Considers task list priority, item location, pick history, and potentially collaboration with other pickers.
        *   Output: Probability distribution over all inventory items for each user.
    *   **Dynamic Inventory Presentation Module:**
        *   Input: Probability distribution from User Tracking & Prediction Engine.
        *   Process:
            *   **Lighting Cueing:**  Increase illumination on items with high probability scores.  Color-coding to indicate priority (e.g., red = highest, yellow = medium, green = low).
            *   **AR Overlay (Optional):** Project picking instructions, item outlines, or optimal picking paths onto the user's AR device. Highlight the predicted item.
            *   **‘Shadowing’ Inventory:** If the system is highly confident (probability > threshold) of a user’s intended action, *pre-fetch* the item via a small automated conveyor or robotic arm. Present the item *as* the user approaches, minimizing reach/movement time.  This requires a buffer system within the inventory location.
    *   **Confidence Score Calibration:**
        *   Adaptive learning algorithm to tune the prediction model.  Monitor pick times, error rates, and user feedback to refine the confidence threshold.
        *   A/B testing of different lighting/AR presentation schemes to optimize user performance.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  User enters inventory location.  RFID/Visual ID detected.
    2.  User Tracking & Prediction Engine calculates probability distribution of next pick.
    3.  Dynamic Inventory Presentation Module adjusts lighting/AR overlays based on probabilities.
    4.  If confidence exceeds threshold, 'shadowing' system pre-fetches item.
    5.  User performs pick.  System records pick time, errors, and user feedback.
    6.  Confidence Score Calibration updates prediction model.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Inventory Presentation Module):**

```
function adjustInventoryPresentation(user_id, probability_distribution):
  for item in inventory:
    probability = probability_distribution[item]
    if probability > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
      activateShadowing(item)
    if probability > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
      setLEDColor(item, "yellow")
    if probability > LOW_THRESHOLD:
      setLEDColor(item, "green")
    else:
      setLEDColor(item, "white")

    if AR_ENABLED:
      highlightItem(item, probability)  // Intensity based on probability
```

**Novelty:** This builds on the existing user disambiguation by introducing *predictive* elements and dynamically adjusting the environment *before* an action is taken.  The 'shadowing' inventory concept is a significant step towards a truly automated and optimized picking process.  It shifts from simply *identifying* who did what to *anticipating* what they will do.
