**Adaptive Token Granularity & Lifecycle**

**Specification:** A system allowing dynamic adjustment of token scope and duration based on real-time service dependencies and predicted access patterns.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent centers around handling data store *unavailability* with temporary tokens. This builds on that by recognizing that *all* tokens – even valid ones – represent potential bottlenecks and security risks. We can move beyond simple temporary/valid states to a system where token *granularity* (what a token allows access to) and *lifecycle* (how long it's valid) are constantly adjusted.

**Components:**

1.  **Dependency Graph Analyzer:**  A service that continuously monitors service interactions to build and maintain a dependency graph.  This graph details which services rely on others, and the specific data/operations they require.

2.  **Access Pattern Predictor:**  Utilizing machine learning, this component analyzes historical access logs to predict future data access needs for each service.  It forecasts *what* data will be needed, *when*, and *by whom*.

3.  **Token Granularity Engine:** Based on the dependency graph and access predictions, this engine dynamically adjusts token scope.  If a service only needs a subset of a data block, the engine issues a token limited to that subset.

4.  **Adaptive Token Lifespan Manager:** This component controls token validity duration.  Tokens are issued with a minimal lifespan sufficient to fulfill predicted needs. If access patterns change, lifespans are dynamically extended or revoked.

5.  **Token Revocation Service:**  Allows for immediate revocation of tokens if security threats are detected or access patterns deviate significantly from predictions.

**Pseudocode (Token Issuance):**

```
function issueToken(serviceID, dataBlockID):
  dependencyGraph = getDependencyGraph()
  accessPredictions = getAccessPredictions(serviceID, dataBlockID)

  requiredDataSubset = determineRequiredDataSubset(dependencyGraph, accessPredictions)
  minimalLifespan = calculateMinimalLifespan(accessPredictions)

  token = createToken(serviceID, requiredDataSubset, minimalLifespan)

  return token
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Dependency Graph:**  Graph structure representing service dependencies.  Nodes are Service IDs, edges represent data/operation requirements.
*   **Access Prediction:**  Time series data representing predicted data access volume and type for each service.
*   **Token:**  Data structure containing Service ID, data access scope (e.g., specific data fields or operations), validity start/end time, and revocation status.

**Interaction Flow:**

1.  A service requests access to a data block.
2.  The system queries the Dependency Graph Analyzer and Access Pattern Predictor.
3.  The Token Granularity Engine determines the minimal necessary access scope.
4.  The Adaptive Token Lifespan Manager assigns an appropriate validity duration.
5.  A token is issued to the service.
6.  The system continuously monitors access patterns and adjusts token scope/lifespan as needed.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced attack surface:  Minimized token scope limits potential damage from compromised tokens.
*   Improved performance:  Smaller tokens require less processing overhead.
*   Enhanced scalability:  Adaptive token management optimizes resource utilization.
*   Proactive security:  Dynamic adjustments respond to changing threat landscape.
