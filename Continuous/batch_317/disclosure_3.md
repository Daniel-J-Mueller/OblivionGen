## Dynamic Provider-Based Cache Tiering

**Concept:** Expand the idea of reserved cache space to introduce dynamic, tiered caching based on provider reputation, content type, and real-time performance metrics. This goes beyond simply reserving space; it actively *prioritizes* and *shapes* cache behavior for different providers.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Scoring System:**

*   **Metrics:**
    *   Content Validity: Automated checks for malware, copyright infringement, and broken links.
    *   Request Success Rate: Provider’s consistently successful delivery of content.
    *   Latency: Average response time from the provider’s origin servers.
    *   User Engagement: (Optional, requires integration with analytics) Measures of how users interact with content from a provider (views, clicks, shares).
*   **Scoring:** Each provider receives a dynamic reputation score calculated from these metrics. This score is updated continuously.
*   **Tier Assignment:** Providers are assigned to one of several cache tiers (e.g., Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on their reputation score.

**2. Tier-Based Cache Allocation & Eviction:**

*   **Reserved Space Allocation:** Each tier receives a pre-defined *percentage* of the total cache capacity. Platinum tier gets the largest allocation, Bronze the smallest.
*   **Eviction Priority:** During cache eviction, objects are prioritized based on provider tier.
    *   Platinum: Lowest eviction priority. Objects are evicted *last*.
    *   Bronze: Highest eviction priority. Objects are evicted *first*.
    *   Silver & Gold: Intermediate eviction priority.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The percentage allocation for each tier can be dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   Real-time CDN load.
    *   Current demand for content from each provider.
    *   Changes in provider reputation scores.

**3. Content Type Aware Tiering:**

*   **Content Classification:** Automatically classify content based on type (e.g., video, images, static HTML, software downloads).
*   **Tier Multipliers:** Apply multipliers to tier-based cache allocation based on content type.
    *   Example: Video content from a Platinum provider receives a higher cache allocation than static images.
    *   Rationale: Some content types are more cache-friendly or have higher user demand.

**4. Real-Time Performance Monitoring & Adjustment:**

*   **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Monitor the following KPIs for each provider:
    *   Cache Hit Ratio
    *   Average Response Time
    *   Error Rate
*   **Automated Adjustment:** Based on KPI thresholds, automatically adjust:
    *   Tier assignments
    *   Cache allocation percentages
    *   Eviction priorities

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Function to calculate provider reputation score
function calculateReputationScore(provider, metrics) {
  score = 0
  // Weight metrics and calculate score
  return score
}

// Function to assign tier based on score
function assignTier(score) {
  if (score > 90) return "Platinum"
  if (score > 70) return "Gold"
  if (score > 50) return "Silver"
  return "Bronze"
}

// Function to determine eviction priority
function getEvictionPriority(tier) {
  if (tier == "Platinum") return 1 // Highest priority (evict last)
  if (tier == "Gold") return 2
  if (tier == "Silver") return 3
  return 4 // Lowest priority (evict first)
}

// Main CDN Cache Management Loop
loop {
  for each provider {
    reputationScore = calculateReputationScore(provider, metrics)
    providerTier = assignTier(reputationScore)
    evictionPriority = getEvictionPriority(providerTier)

    // Adjust cache allocation and eviction priority based on tier
  }

  // Perform cache eviction based on eviction priorities
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved CDN performance and user experience.
*   Prioritization of high-quality content providers.
*   Reduced costs by optimizing cache utilization.
*   Increased resilience to provider outages.
*   Automated and dynamic cache management.
