## Dynamic Spectrum Allocation via Bio-Inspired Swarm Intelligence

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Spectrum Sensing Units (SSUs):** Integrated within each chipset (first & second – 802.11/BT & 802.15.4), constantly monitoring frequency bands for utilization.  SSUs report signal strength, frequency, and estimated bandwidth.  Minimum of 3 SSUs per chipset for spatial diversity.
*   **Swarm Intelligence (SI) Engine:**  A centralized (or distributed) processing unit implementing a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.  PSO parameters (inertia weight, cognitive/social coefficients) are dynamically adjustable.
*   **Negotiation Protocol:**  A lightweight communication protocol between chipsets (via a dedicated, low-bandwidth channel *separate* from the primary data channels). This protocol facilitates exchange of spectrum sensing data and negotiation of access rights.
*   **Priority Override Mechanism:**  Hardware-based override to guarantee critical communication types (e.g., emergency alerts, safety-critical data) always have precedence, independent of SI negotiation.
*   **Adaptive Learning Module:**  Records historical spectrum usage patterns, communication priorities, and SI negotiation outcomes to refine PSO parameters and improve future allocation decisions.

**II. Functional Description:**

1.  **Spectrum Sensing:** Each SSU within each chipset continuously scans its operating frequency band, creating a real-time "spectrum map."
2.  **Data Aggregation & Exchange:**  SSU data is aggregated at the chipset level.  Each chipset broadcasts its spectrum map to all other chipsets via the Negotiation Protocol.
3.  **PSO Initialization:** The SI Engine represents each available frequency band as a "particle" in the PSO algorithm.  The “fitness” of each particle is determined by a combination of:
    *   **Bandwidth Availability:**  Based on SSU reports.
    *   **Interference Level:**  Detected by SSUs.
    *   **Communication Priority:**  Weighted based on the type of data being transmitted.
    *   **Historical Usage:** Favor bands previously used successfully for similar communications.
4.  **Swarm Optimization:** The PSO algorithm iteratively adjusts the "position" of each particle (frequency band) to maximize fitness.  Each chipset participates in the swarm optimization, contributing its local spectrum data and communication priorities.
5.  **Dynamic Allocation:** The SI Engine assigns frequency bands to chipsets based on the optimized particle positions.  The allocation is *dynamic*, adjusting in real-time based on changing spectrum conditions and communication demands.
6.  **Negotiation & Arbitration:**  If multiple chipsets request the same frequency band, the SI Engine utilizes a negotiation protocol to arbitrate access rights. Factors considered:
    *   Communication Priority.
    *   Duration of Communication.
    *   Signal Strength.
7. **Priority Override:** Critical communications bypass the negotiation process and are granted immediate access to the required frequency band, preempting lower-priority communications.

**III. Hardware & Software Requirements:**

*   **SSU Hardware:** Low-power, wideband RF front-ends with high sensitivity and dynamic range.
*   **SI Engine:** Multi-core processor with sufficient memory to handle PSO calculations and data storage. Dedicated hardware acceleration for PSO calculations is desirable.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Low-latency, reliable communication protocol optimized for short-range communication.
*   **Software:** Real-time operating system (RTOS) with support for multi-threading and interrupt handling. Machine learning algorithms for adaptive learning.

**IV. Pseudocode (SI Engine - PSO Update):**

```pseudocode
// PSO Parameters
inertiaWeight = 0.7
cognitiveCoefficient = 1.4
socialCoefficient = 1.4

// Particle Structure
particle.frequencyBand
particle.velocity
particle.position
particle.fitness

// Loop for each particle (frequency band)
for each particle in frequencyBands:

  // Calculate new velocity
  velocity = (inertiaWeight * velocity) +
             (cognitiveCoefficient * random() * (particle.position - particle.bestPosition)) +
             (socialCoefficient * random() * (globalBestPosition - particle.position))

  // Update position (frequency band)
  position = position + velocity

  // Calculate fitness (bandwidth, interference, priority)
  fitness = calculateFitness(position, communicationPriority, interferenceLevel)

  // Update particle's best position
  if fitness > particle.bestFitness:
    particle.bestFitness = fitness
    particle.bestPosition = position

  // Update global best position
  if fitness > globalBestFitness:
    globalBestFitness = fitness
    globalBestPosition = position

end loop

// Return updated frequency allocation map
return frequencyAllocationMap
```
