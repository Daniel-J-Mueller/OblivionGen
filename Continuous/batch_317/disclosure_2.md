## Aerial Vehicle Swarm Acoustic Mapping - ‘EchoNet’

**Concept:** Leverage the perpendicular array technology for collaborative, high-resolution 3D mapping using a swarm of aerial vehicles. Instead of focusing on single-vehicle object detection, create a dynamically adjusting acoustic ‘mesh’ for environmental reconstruction.

**Specs:**

*   **Vehicle Count:** Scalable swarm - minimum 5 vehicles, optimal 10-20 for large areas.
*   **Acoustic Array:** Each vehicle maintains the perpendicular transmitting/receiving array described in the source patent. However, transmission power is significantly reduced - emphasis on collaborative reception, not singular powerful emissions.
*   **Frequency Modulation:** Transmitters cycle through a range of frequencies (e.g., 20kHz-80kHz) - allowing for varied material penetration & reflection characteristics. Frequency selection is dynamic, dictated by swarm ‘learning’.
*   **Swarm Communication:** Vehicles communicate via a low-latency mesh network – sharing received signal data, estimated object locations, and adjusting transmission/reception parameters.
*   **Dynamic Mesh Formation:** Vehicles self-organize into a 3D ‘mesh’ – maintaining approximately equal spacing to maximize acoustic coverage and minimize signal interference. Vehicle positioning is adjusted via GPS and onboard IMUs.
*   **Triangulation Refinement:**  Refine triangulation data using not only first reflections, but also multiple reflections (echoes of echoes). Implement algorithms that can filter noise and identify genuine multi-bounce paths.
*   **‘Acoustic Fingerprinting’:**  Develop algorithms that identify materials based on unique frequency response characteristics.
*   **Data Fusion:** Aggregate data from all vehicles to create a coherent, high-resolution 3D map of the environment. Map is visualized in real time.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Coordination):**

```
// Vehicle initialization
setVehicleID(uniqueID)
setTransmissionFrequency(initialFrequency)
setMovementMode(swarmMode)

// Main loop
while(true) {
    // Receive data from neighboring vehicles
    receiveSwarmData(swarmData)

    // Analyze swarm data to estimate environmental features
    environmentalFeatures = analyzeData(swarmData)

    // Adjust transmission frequency based on detected materials
    if(materialDetected(environmentalFeatures)) {
        setTransmissionFrequency(optimalFrequencyForMaterial(materialDetected))
    }

    // Calculate optimal position based on neighbor positions and environmental features
    optimalPosition = calculateOptimalPosition(neighborPositions, environmentalFeatures)

    // Move towards optimal position
    moveTowards(optimalPosition)

    // Transmit acoustic signal
    transmitSignal()

    // Receive acoustic reflections
    receiveReflections()

    // Process received reflections
    processedReflections = processReflections(receiveReflections())

    // Send processed reflection data to swarm
    sendSwarmData(processedReflections)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Underground mapping (mines, caves)
*   Search and rescue operations in complex environments
*   Precision agriculture – detailed field mapping
*   Infrastructure inspection (bridges, tunnels)
*   Autonomous navigation in GPS-denied environments.
