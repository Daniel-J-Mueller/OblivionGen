## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Tiered Transaction Limits

**Concept:** Expand upon the tiered transaction amount thresholds by introducing a dynamic trust score influenced by behavioral biometrics and external data sources. This allows for a more nuanced and adaptable security system, potentially enabling higher transaction limits for trusted users while proactively mitigating risk.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Data Collection Module:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data during transactions (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, touch screen pressure, device orientation, scrolling speed, app usage patterns).
*   **Processing:** Utilizes machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks) to create a baseline behavioral profile for each user.
*   **Output:**  A ‘Behavioral Risk Score’ ranging from 0-100 (100 = low risk). This score is updated in real-time during transactions.
*   **Data Storage:** Encrypted and anonymized behavioral data stored securely.  Data retention policies defined and compliant with privacy regulations.

**2. External Data Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Access to (with user consent) publicly available data sources (e.g., credit bureau data, social media activity, device reputation services, IP address geolocation). *Note: This requires careful legal review and user consent mechanisms.*
*   **Processing:**  Analyzes external data for anomalies or red flags (e.g., recent address changes, fraudulent account activity, high-risk IP address).
*   **Output:** An ‘External Risk Score’ ranging from 0-100 (100 = low risk).
*   **Data Storage:** Limited data retention of external data sources, adhering to privacy regulations.

**3. Trust Score Calculation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Behavioral Risk Score, External Risk Score, Transaction History (amount, frequency, location, recipient).
*   **Processing:** Weighted average calculation combining the inputs to generate a ‘Trust Score’ (0-100). Weights are adjustable and dynamically tuned based on machine learning models.
*   **Algorithm (Pseudocode):**
    ```
    TrustScore = (BehavioralRiskScore * Weight_Behavioral) + (ExternalRiskScore * Weight_External) + (TransactionHistoryScore * Weight_Transaction)
    // Weights dynamically adjusted via ML
    // TransactionHistoryScore calculated based on past successful transactions, age of account, etc.
    ```
*   **Output:** A dynamic Trust Score assigned to each user.

**4. Tiered Transaction Limit Management Module:**

*   **Input:** User Trust Score.
*   **Processing:** Maps Trust Score to a predefined Tiered Transaction Limit Table.
*   **Table Example:**
    *   Trust Score 0-30: Transaction Limit: $50
    *   Trust Score 31-60: Transaction Limit: $250
    *   Trust Score 61-80: Transaction Limit: $1000
    *   Trust Score 81-100: Transaction Limit: $5000+ (with potential for real-time increase based on transaction success)
*   **Output:** Dynamic Transaction Limit assigned to the user.

**5. Real-time Risk Assessment & Adaptive Authentication Module:**

*   **Input:** Trust Score, Transaction Details (amount, recipient, location), Real-time Behavioral Data.
*   **Processing:** Monitors transaction activity for anomalies. If the Trust Score drops below a threshold or anomalies are detected, trigger adaptive authentication methods (e.g., multi-factor authentication, biometric verification, knowledge-based authentication).
*   **Output:** Real-time risk assessment and adaptive authentication trigger.



**Integration:** This system integrates seamlessly with the existing transaction account verification system by dynamically adjusting transaction limits based on a comprehensive risk assessment. It offers a more adaptive and secure system that can proactively mitigate fraud while minimizing friction for trusted users. The system is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of new data sources and authentication methods.
