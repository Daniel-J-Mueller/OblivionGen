## Adaptive Multi-Tiered Reordering System with Predictive Consumption Modeling

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon automated reordering by incorporating multi-tiered product categorization, dynamic threshold adjustment based on environmental factors, and advanced predictive consumption modeling leveraging both individual user data and aggregated external datasets. It moves beyond simple weight/quantity monitoring to understand *why* consumption changes.

**Hardware Components:**

1.  **Reorder Device:** Similar to the patent’s base, includes NFC/RFID reader, weight sensor, timestamping. *Addition*: Embedded environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light level) and a small, low-resolution camera.
2.  **Edge Compute Unit:**  Located within the reorder device or a nearby hub.  Processes sensor data locally, performs initial data filtering/compression, and handles basic predictive modeling.  Connectivity: Wi-Fi/Bluetooth/Cellular.
3.  **Cloud Backend:**  Centralized data storage, advanced machine learning models, user profile management, order fulfillment integration, external data source integration.

**Software Components & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Tiered Product Classification:**  Products are categorized into tiers (1-3) based on perishability, usage patterns, and value.
    *   Tier 1:  High Perishability/High Value (e.g., fresh produce, medicine).  Frequent monitoring, aggressive reordering.
    *   Tier 2:  Moderate Perishability/Moderate Value (e.g., snacks, cleaning supplies).  Standard monitoring, adaptive reordering.
    *   Tier 3:  Low Perishability/Low Value (e.g., paper towels, batteries).  Infrequent monitoring, bulk reordering.

2.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  Reorder thresholds aren't static. They're adjusted based on environmental factors and learned user behavior.
    ```pseudocode
    function calculateReorderThreshold(product, currentThreshold, environmentalData, userConsumptionData):
        environmentalFactor = calculateEnvironmentalFactor(environmentalData)
        consumptionTrend = calculateConsumptionTrend(userConsumptionData)
        adjustedThreshold = currentThreshold * environmentalFactor * consumptionTrend
        return adjustedThreshold
    ```
    *   `calculateEnvironmentalFactor`:  Factors in temperature (spoilage), humidity (spoilage, usage – e.g., more beverages in humid weather), light levels (affecting shelf life of certain items).
    *   `calculateConsumptionTrend`: Analyzes historical consumption data to identify patterns (daily, weekly, seasonal) and predict future needs.  Uses time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing).

3.  **Predictive Consumption Modeling:**
    *   **Individual Model:**  A personalized model is built for each user, using their historical consumption data, environmental data, and external data (see below). Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forests, Gradient Boosting) are used.
    *   **Aggregated Data:** Leverage anonymized data from other users with similar profiles (demographics, lifestyle, location). This provides a broader context and improves prediction accuracy.
    *   **External Data Integration:**
        *   **Weather Data:** Predicts increased consumption of certain items during hot/cold weather.
        *   **Calendar Events:**  Identifies upcoming events (parties, holidays) and adjusts reordering accordingly.
        *   **Local Events:**  Detects nearby events (concerts, festivals) that might affect consumption.
        *   **Social Media Trends:** Monitors social media for trending products or recipes.
    ```pseudocode
    function predictConsumption(product, user, timeHorizon):
        individualPrediction = individualModel.predict(user, timeHorizon)
        aggregatedPrediction = aggregatedModel.predict(user, timeHorizon)
        externalFactor = calculateExternalFactor(weather, calendar, events, socialMedia)
        finalPrediction = (individualPrediction * 0.7) + (aggregatedPrediction * 0.2) + (externalFactor * 0.1)
        return finalPrediction
    ```

4.  **Camera-Based Inventory Assessment:**
    *   The small camera on the reorder device periodically captures images of the product.
    *   Computer vision algorithms analyze the images to estimate remaining quantity/volume, even for items that aren't directly weighed. This is particularly useful for irregularly shaped items.
    *   Data from the camera is combined with weight sensor data for increased accuracy.

**Order Fulfillment Integration:**

*   The system integrates with various order fulfillment services (Amazon, Walmart, local grocery stores).
*   It automatically places orders when predicted consumption exceeds the reorder threshold.
*   Users receive notifications about upcoming orders and estimated delivery times.

**User Interface:**

*   A mobile app allows users to:
    *   View their reorder history.
    *   Customize reorder thresholds.
    *   Pause or cancel orders.
    *   Provide feedback on the system's accuracy.
