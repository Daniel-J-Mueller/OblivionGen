## Modular Robotic Busway Extension System

**System Overview:**

A robotic system designed for fully automated extension, reconfiguration, and maintenance of power busway systems. This system moves beyond incremental extensions to offer dynamic power distribution and fault isolation.

**Core Components:**

*   **Robotic Crawler:** A self-propelled robotic unit capable of traversing existing busway infrastructure. Multiple independently driven wheels/tracks for stability and maneuverability.
*   **Modular Busway Segments:** Standardized, lightweight busway segments incorporating quick-connect power and communication interfaces. Segments feature integrated sensors (temperature, vibration, current).
*   **Robotic Arm/Manipulator:** Mounted on the crawler, capable of precisely manipulating and connecting modular busway segments. Incorporates force sensors for safe connection.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Secure, high-bandwidth wireless link for remote control, data streaming, and system monitoring.
*   **Central Control System:** Software platform for task planning, robot control, data analysis, and predictive maintenance.

**Functional Specifications:**

1.  **Autonomous Navigation:** The robotic crawler autonomously navigates the existing busway, using a combination of:
    *   LiDAR/SLAM for mapping and localization.
    *   Visual markers/RFID tags for precise positioning.
    *   Obstacle avoidance sensors (ultrasonic, infrared).
2.  **Segment Handling:** The robotic arm securely grips and manipulates modular busway segments. Gripper force is adjustable based on segment weight and material.
3.  **Connection Procedure:**
    *   Robotic arm positions a new segment adjacent to an existing one.
    *   Automatic alignment using visual/force feedback.
    *   Quick-connect mechanism ensures secure electrical and mechanical connection.
    *   Connection quality is verified via built-in sensors.
4.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** The system can dynamically reconfigure power distribution based on load demand or fault conditions.
5.  **Fault Isolation:** In case of a fault, the system automatically isolates the affected segment and reroutes power to unaffected segments.
6.  **Predictive Maintenance:** System collects data from integrated sensors to predict potential failures and schedule maintenance proactively.

**Pseudocode (Connection Procedure):**
