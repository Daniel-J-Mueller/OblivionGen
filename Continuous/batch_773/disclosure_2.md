## Active Duct Modulation for Directed Sound Emission

**Concept:** Extend the active airflow channel concept to not just *disrupt* airflow for noise reduction or efficiency, but to *shape* and *direct* it for targeted sound emission. Essentially, turning the drone into a localized sound source – a mobile speaker.

**Specs:**

*   **Duct Modification:** The existing cylindrical duct is segmented into independently actuatable ‘petals’. Think of a flower opening and closing. Each petal is a section of the duct's interior surface.
*   **Actuation Mechanism:** Each petal is driven by a miniature linear actuator (piezoelectric or solenoid preferred for speed and precision). The actuators are embedded *within* the duct structure, minimizing aerodynamic disruption when petals are at rest.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller manages the actuation of each petal, based on input from a sound processing unit.
*   **Sound Processing Unit:** Accepts audio input (wireless or wired).  Performs FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to analyze the frequency spectrum of the audio.  This data drives the petal actuation patterns.
*   **Petal Actuation Patterns:** Based on the FFT data, the microcontroller commands petals to open/close in a coordinated manner.
    *   **Low Frequencies:** Large-scale, slow pulsations of multiple petals create constructive interference for bass frequencies.
    *   **Mid Frequencies:**  Precise, localized actuation of individual petals shapes the sound wave and steers it in a desired direction.
    *   **High Frequencies:** Rapid, fine-grained control of petals focuses the sound beam, achieving directional audio emission.
*   **Duct Material:** Duct constructed from a lightweight, high-strength composite material with integrated wiring channels for actuators and sensors.
*   **Power Source:** Dedicated battery pack integrated into the drone’s power system.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Microphones embedded within the duct monitor the emitted sound, providing feedback for closed-loop control and calibration.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Input: Audio stream
// Output: Actuation commands for each petal

function generate_actuation_commands(audio_stream):
  fft_data = perform_fft(audio_stream)
  petal_commands = []

  for i in range(number_of_petals):
    command = calculate_petal_command(fft_data, i)
    petal_commands.append(command)

  return petal_commands

function calculate_petal_command(fft_data, petal_index):
  //Analyze FFT data to determine amplitude and phase for each frequency
  //Map frequency data to petal actuation parameters (angle, velocity)
  //Use a phase-matching algorithm to create constructive interference
  //Adjust actuation based on feedback from duct microphones
  return actuation_parameters

//Main Loop:
while True:
  audio = get_audio_input()
  commands = generate_actuation_commands(audio)
  send_commands_to_petals(commands)
```
