## Dynamic Foveated Rendering with Predictive Fragment Streaming

**Concept:** Extend the selective decoding approach by anticipating user gaze and pre-streaming only the *necessary* fragments of a virtual scene *before* they enter the user’s foveated (central) view. This minimizes latency and bandwidth, especially crucial for high-resolution VR experiences.

**Specifications:**

**1. Gaze Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Head tracking data (position, orientation), eye tracking data (gaze direction, pupil dilation), user movement history.
*   **Algorithm:** Implement a Kalman filter or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict the user's gaze point over the next 50-100ms. The RNN should be trained on historical gaze data and current movement.
*   **Output:** Predicted gaze point (x, y, z coordinates) and confidence interval.

**2. Scene Graph & Fragment Hierarchy:**

*   The virtual environment is represented as a scene graph, where each node corresponds to a 3D object or part of an object.
*   Each object is further divided into fragments (tiles) based on a spatial partitioning scheme (e.g., octree or quadtree). Fragments are the basic unit of streaming and rendering.
*   A hierarchical representation of fragments is maintained, allowing for Level of Detail (LOD) selection.

**3. Predictive Fragment Request Manager:**

*   **Input:** Predicted gaze point, confidence interval, scene graph, fragment hierarchy.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Identify fragments within a predicted ‘cone of interest’ centered around the predicted gaze point. The cone of interest is defined by an angle based on the confidence interval.
    2.  Prioritize fragments based on their proximity to the predicted gaze point and their LOD. Higher LOD fragments closer to the gaze point receive higher priority.
    3.  Generate requests for missing or low-LOD fragments.
    4.  Pre-fetch fragments *before* they enter the foveated view.
*   **Output:** List of fragment requests.

**4. Streaming & Decoding Pipeline:**

*   Fragments are encoded using a scalable video codec (e.g., AV1, VVC) with multiple layers. Base layers provide low-resolution content, while enhancement layers add detail.
*   The streaming server prioritizes requests based on the priority list from the Predictive Fragment Request Manager.
*   Fragments are decoded on the client device. The decoder dynamically adjusts the LOD based on the fragment's distance from the gaze point.
*   Fragments are composited to form the final rendered image.

**5. Adaptive LOD Control:**

*   Implement a feedback loop that adjusts the LOD selection based on rendering performance and visual quality.
*   Monitor frame rates and rendering times.
*   Dynamically adjust the LOD of fragments to maintain a target frame rate.
*   Allow users to customize the LOD settings.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Fragment Request Manager):**

```pseudocode
function generateFragmentRequests(predictedGaze, confidenceInterval, sceneGraph):
  fragmentsToRequest = []
  coneOfInterest = calculateConeOfInterest(predictedGaze, confidenceInterval)
  
  for each fragment in sceneGraph:
    if fragment is within coneOfInterest:
      requiredLOD = calculateRequiredLOD(fragment, predictedGaze)
      currentLOD = fragment.LOD
      
      if currentLOD < requiredLOD:
        fragmentsToRequest.append(requestFragment(fragment, requiredLOD))
  
  return fragmentsToRequest
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution VR headset with eye tracking.
*   Powerful GPU for rendering.
*   High-bandwidth network connection.
*   Dedicated processing unit for gaze prediction (optional).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved responsiveness.
*   Minimized bandwidth requirements.
*   Enhanced visual quality in the foveated area.
*   Scalable to high-resolution VR experiences.
