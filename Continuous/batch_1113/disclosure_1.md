## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Tiered Modification Permissions

**Concept:** Expand the risk assessment beyond simple "lockout" potential to establish a dynamic trust score for the user and the initiating device, and link that score to tiered modification permissions. This moves beyond a binary "approve/deny" and introduces granular control over what changes are allowed based on context.

**Specifications:**

**I. Trust Score Components:**

*   **Device Trust:**
    *   Hardware Attestation: Verify device integrity via secure boot/TPM.
    *   Geolocation Consistency: Flag anomalous location shifts.
    *   Usage History: Track frequency, patterns, and anomalies in access.
    *   Software Integrity: Scan for rooted/jailbroken status, malware, & known vulnerabilities.
*   **User Behavior:**
    *   Authentication Method: Prioritize strong authentication (biometrics, MFA).
    *   Time of Day/Day of Week: Flag out-of-pattern activity.
    *   Modification History: Track frequency and type of modifications attempted.
    *   Communication Channel Usage: Analyze preferred channels and detect shifts.
*   **Network Context:**
    *   IP Address Reputation: Leverage threat intelligence feeds.
    *   Network Type (Home, Public, Corporate): Assign risk levels.
    *   VPN/Proxy Detection: Flag potential obfuscation.

**II. Tiered Modification Permissions:**

*   **Tier 0 (Low Trust – New Device, Anomalous Activity):** Read-only access. No modification capabilities. Requires extensive verification (e.g., SMS code, email confirmation, physical security question).
*   **Tier 1 (Moderate Trust – Registered Device, Standard Activity):** Limited modifications (e.g., password resets, security question updates, non-critical profile information). Requires standard authentication.
*   **Tier 2 (High Trust – Trusted Device, Consistent Behavior):** Broad modification permissions (e.g., contact information, communication preferences, payment method updates). Requires standard authentication, potentially with a time-based delay.
*   **Tier 3 (Exceptional Trust – Frequent, Secure Access):** Unrestricted access. May allow automated updates and critical configuration changes. Requires strong authentication and potentially continuous behavioral analysis.

**III. Implementation Details:**

1.  **Trust Score Calculation:** Implement a weighted scoring system where each component contributes to the overall trust score. Weights should be configurable and adaptable.
2.  **Dynamic Permission Assignment:** Based on the real-time trust score, automatically assign appropriate modification permissions.
3.  **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Integration:** Integrate MFA with tiered permissions. Higher-risk modifications may require additional verification.
4.  **Behavioral Analytics Engine:** Implement a machine learning model to detect anomalous behavior and adjust the trust score accordingly.
5.  **Notification System:** Send tailored notifications to users about modifications, including the reason for any restrictions.
6.  **Auditing & Reporting:** Maintain a detailed audit log of all modifications and trust score changes.
7. **Pseudocode for Permission Check:**

```
function checkPermission(user, device, modificationType) {
  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(user, device);
  permissionLevel = determinePermissionLevel(trustScore, modificationType);

  if (permissionLevel == "Denied") {
    logEvent("Permission Denied for " + modificationType);
    return false;
  } else if (permissionLevel == "RequiresVerification"){
    triggerVerificationProcess(user, modificationType);
    return false;
  } else {
    logEvent("Permission Granted for " + modificationType);
    return true;
  }
}

function calculateTrustScore(user, device) {
    score = 0;
    // Add score based on device trust factors
    score += device.hardwareAttestationScore * weight_hardware;
    score += device.geolocationConsistencyScore * weight_geo;
    //Add user behavior factors
    score += user.authMethodScore * weight_auth;
    score += user.modHistoryScore * weight_modhistory;

    return score;
}

function determinePermissionLevel(trustScore, modificationType) {
    if (trustScore < threshold_low) {
        return "Denied";
    } else if (trustScore < threshold_medium){
        if (modificationType == "critical_setting"){
            return "RequiresVerification";
        }
        else{
            return "Allowed";
        }
    }
    else{
        return "Allowed";
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Reputation System:** Integrate with third-party reputation services to assess device and network risk.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Use machine learning to continuously refine trust score weights and thresholds based on observed behavior.
*   **Policy-Based Permissions:** Allow administrators to define custom permission policies based on user roles and organizational requirements.
