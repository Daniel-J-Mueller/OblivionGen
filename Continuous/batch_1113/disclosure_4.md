## Adaptive Spatial Audio Personalization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** A system that dynamically adjusts spatial audio rendering (beyond simple volume adjustments) based on real-time biometric data, aiming to create a more immersive and personalized listening experience tailored to the user's current physiological and psychological state.  This goes beyond categorizing *audio* - it personalizes the *rendering* of audio, adapting how sounds are perceived in 3D space.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Input:**
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) sensor (e.g., chest strap, optical sensor)
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) sensor (headset-based, minimal contact) – focusing on alpha/theta wave activity related to relaxation/focus.
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor (finger or palm-based) - measuring emotional arousal.
    *   Optional: Eye-tracking for gaze direction and pupil dilation.
*   **Audio Rendering Engine:**
    *   Spatial Audio Renderer:  Utilizing HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) customization.  A library of HRTFs will be maintained, and blended/modified in real-time.
    *   Ambisonics or Object-Based Audio Support:  Capable of processing and rendering 3D audio scenes.
    *   Dynamic Occlusion and Reflection Modeling: Adjust the perceived soundscape based on virtual environmental properties.
*   **Data Processing & Mapping:**
    *   Real-time Biometric Data Acquisition:  Sampling rates appropriate for each sensor (HRV: 50-200 Hz, EEG: 250-1000 Hz, GSR: 1-10 Hz).
    *   Feature Extraction:  Calculate relevant features from biometric data (e.g., RMSSD for HRV, alpha/theta power spectral density for EEG, skin conductance level for GSR).
    *   Mapping Functions:  Define non-linear mapping functions between biometric features and spatial audio parameters:
        *   **HRV (RMSSD) -> Spatial Width/Ambience:**  Higher RMSSD (indicating relaxation) -> Wider soundstage, increased ambience.  Lower RMSSD -> Narrower, more focused sound.
        *   **EEG (Alpha/Theta Ratio) -> Sound Elevation/Immersion:** Higher Alpha/Theta (relaxed focus) -> Sounds appear more 'grounded' and closer. Lower Alpha/Theta -> Sounds are elevated, creating a more expansive feel.
        *   **GSR -> Dynamic Sound ‘Focus’:** Increasing GSR -> Sounds become sharper and more focused, enhancing alertness. Decreasing GSR -> Softer, diffused audio, promoting relaxation.
        *   **Eye Tracking (optional) -> Adaptive Audio Panning:** Audio sources subtly pan with gaze direction to create a heightened sense of presence.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Embedded Processor:  Handles real-time data acquisition, processing, and audio rendering. (e.g., ARM Cortex-A series)
    *   Wireless Communication: Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for data transmission and control.
    *   Power Management: Optimized for low power consumption.
*   **Calibration Procedure:**
    *   Baseline Biometric Recording: Capture baseline biometric data in a neutral state.
    *   Personalized Mapping Adjustment: Allow the user to fine-tune the mapping functions based on subjective preferences.  A simple UI will present variations in spatial audio (width, elevation, focus) while the user provides feedback.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop

while (true) {
  // Acquire Biometric Data
  hrv = readHRV();
  eeg = readEEG();
  gsr = readGSR();

  // Calculate Features
  rmssd = calculateRMSSD(hrv);
  alphaThetaRatio = calculateAlphaThetaRatio(eeg);
  skinConductanceLevel = calculateSkinConductanceLevel(gsr);

  // Apply Mapping Functions
  soundstageWidth = mapRMSSDToSoundstageWidth(rmssd);
  soundElevation = mapAlphaThetaRatioToSoundElevation(alphaThetaRatio);
  audioFocus = mapSkinConductanceLevelToAudioFocus(skinConductanceLevel);

  // Render Audio
  renderAudio(soundstageWidth, soundElevation, audioFocus);

  // Output Audio
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Gaming: Dynamically adjust the soundscape to match the player's emotional state, enhancing immersion and creating a more compelling experience.
*   VR/AR:  Personalize the audio environment to create a more realistic and engaging virtual world.
*   Meditation/Relaxation:  Create a customized soundscape that promotes relaxation and reduces stress.
*   Accessibility:  Tailor the audio environment to the needs of individuals with sensory processing disorders.
