## Dynamic Predictive Maintenance via Correlated Device ‘Whispers’

**Concept:** Extend the device state notification system to incorporate *predictive* failure analysis based on subtle, correlated deviations from baseline states – “device whispers” – *before* a full alarm state is triggered. This goes beyond simple alarm/normal and anticipates issues.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Baseline Creation:**

*   **Data Sources:** Receive telemetry data beyond simple “normal/alarm” states. Include:
    *   CPU/GPU utilization (if applicable)
    *   Memory usage
    *   Network latency/bandwidth
    *   Power consumption
    *   Sensor drift (for sensors like weight sensors, cameras) – crucial
    *   Internal error logs (formatted for parsing)
*   **Baseline Profiles:** For each device type (camera, weight sensor, etc.), create dynamic baseline profiles. These aren’t static averages. They’re rolling windows of historical data, weighted towards more recent behavior. Utilize Kalman filtering or similar techniques for noise reduction and accurate trend estimation.
*   **Profile Granularity:** Baselines are not just per-device *type* but also per-device *instance* and potentially, per-device *operational mode*. (e.g., a camera in low-light mode will have a different baseline than in bright light).

**2. "Whisper" Detection & Correlation Engine:**

*   **Deviation Metrics:** Define deviation metrics for each telemetry data point. These aren’t simple thresholds. They’re calculated as Z-scores or similar, relative to the dynamic baseline.
*   **Whisper Classification:** A deviation exceeding a low threshold (much lower than alarm thresholds) is flagged as a "whisper." These are initially non-critical.
*   **Correlation Matrix:** Construct a correlation matrix between whispers across *all* devices in a device set. This is the core innovation. The system searches for *coordinated* whispers – meaning, multiple devices exhibiting subtle deviations simultaneously.
*   **Correlation Weighting:**  Whispers from critical devices (e.g., the camera in a loss prevention system) receive higher weighting in the correlation analysis.
*   **Anomaly Score:** Calculate an "Anomaly Score" for each device set based on the weighted sum of correlated whispers. This score represents the likelihood of a developing issue.

**3. Predictive Alerting & Mitigation:**

*   **Escalation Levels:** Define escalation levels based on the Anomaly Score:
    *   **Level 1 (Whisper Stage):** No alert to the user. Internal logging and increased data collection frequency for affected devices.
    *   **Level 2 (Caution):**  System suggests proactive maintenance (e.g., “Weight sensor calibration recommended”).
    *   **Level 3 (Warning):** Alert user to potential issue and suggest diagnostic steps.
    *   **Level 4 (Alarm):**  Standard alarm triggered.
*   **Automated Mitigation:** If possible, the system attempts automated mitigation (e.g., rebooting a device, recalibrating a sensor).
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** The system provides a probabilistic root cause analysis based on the correlated whispers. (e.g., "High correlation between camera CPU usage and weight sensor drift suggests potential network congestion impacting data transfer.")

**4. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Ingestion Module
function ingestTelemetry(deviceId, telemetryData) {
    // Store telemetryData in time-series database
    // Update dynamic baseline for deviceId
}

// Whisper Detection Module
function detectWhispers(deviceId, telemetryData, baseline) {
    // Calculate deviation metrics
    // Return list of whispers (deviceId, metric, deviation)
}

// Correlation Engine
function calculateCorrelation(whispers, deviceSet) {
    // Construct correlation matrix based on shared whispers
    // Apply weighting based on device criticality
    // Calculate Anomaly Score for deviceSet
    return AnomalyScore
}

// Alerting Module
function generateAlerts(AnomalyScore, deviceSet) {
    // Based on AnomalyScore, escalate alert level
    // Suggest proactive maintenance or diagnostic steps
    // Trigger automated mitigation if possible
}
```

**Data Storage:** Time-series database (InfluxDB, Prometheus) for telemetry data. Graph database (Neo4j) to represent device relationships and correlations.
