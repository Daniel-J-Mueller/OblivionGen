## Adaptive Credential Rotation via Biometric-Triggered Shards

**Concept:** Expand upon the portable data store aspect, not for simple storage, but as a system for dynamically rotating and fragmenting credentials based on biometric authentication and user behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Generation & Distribution:**

*   Upon initial authentication manager setup, a master credential is generated. This is *never* directly used for logins.
*   The master credential is algorithmically fragmented into multiple “credential shards.” The number of shards and shard size are configurable, prioritizing security vs. usability. (e.g., 5-10 shards, each 25-50% of the original)
*   Each shard is encrypted with a unique key derived from a combination of:
    *   A static seed.
    *   A biometric template (fingerprint, facial recognition data - locally stored & processed).
    *   A time-based component.
*   Shard locations are dynamically managed. Primary storage is the portable data store. Secondary storage is a secure, ephemeral cache within the client device’s memory.
*   A 'health check' system monitors the portable data store. If it's disconnected for a period, shards are migrated to secondary storage – triggering a review of the biometric template.

**2. Authentication Process:**

*   When a user attempts to log in to a network site, the authentication manager does *not* send a complete credential.
*   Instead, it initiates a biometric scan.
*   Upon successful scan, the system identifies a subset of shards (determined randomly or based on network site/account risk profile).
*   The identified shards are decrypted using the biometric data and the time-based component.
*   The decrypted shard data is assembled and sent to the network site.
*   A rolling hash is calculated on the assembled data and sent with it, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.

**3. Credential Rotation & Revocation:**

*   The system periodically (configurable) rotates the master credential. 
*   Rotation involves generating a new master credential, fragmenting it, and re-encrypting the shards.
*   The system can also trigger immediate credential rotation based on detected anomalies (e.g., unusual login attempts, portable data store compromise).
*   Revocation is handled by wiping the master credential and shards from the portable data store and triggering a new credential generation process.

**4. Portable Data Store Integration:**

*   The authentication manager supports multiple portable data store types (USB drives, SD cards, secure microchips).
*   Data store access is governed by strict permissions and encryption.
*   A tamper-detection system monitors the data store for physical intrusion.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Flow):**

```
function authenticate(networkSite):
  biometricData = scanBiometrics()
  if biometricData is invalid:
    return authenticationFailed()

  shardSubset = selectShards(networkSite, biometricData)
  decryptedShards = decryptShards(shardSubset, biometricData)
  assembledCredential = assembleCredential(decryptedShards)
  hash = calculateHash(assembledCredential)

  sendToNetworkSite(assembledCredential, hash)
  if networkSite accepts credential:
    return authenticationSuccessful()
  else:
    return authenticationFailed()
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Secure Enclave or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for biometric data storage and cryptographic operations.
*   Hardware-based random number generator for generating cryptographic keys.
*   Tamper-resistant portable data store interface.
