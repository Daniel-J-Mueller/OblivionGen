**Dynamic Behavioral Biometrics Integration for Adaptive Authentication**

**Concept:** Augment knowledge-based authentication with real-time behavioral biometrics to create a continuously adapting and more secure authentication process. Instead of *replacing* the dynamic knowledge-based questions, use them as a ‘seed’ for establishing a baseline behavioral profile.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Continuously monitor user interactions with the application/system *after* successful initial (or reset) authentication via the dynamic knowledge-based questions.
    *   Capture data points including:
        *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, rhythm).
        *   Mouse/touchpad movement (speed, acceleration, patterns).
        *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns).
        *   Device orientation/movement (if applicable - mobile devices).
        *   Application usage patterns (frequency, duration, features used).
*   **Baseline Profile Creation:**
    *   Establish a personalized behavioral profile for each user based on the collected data.
    *   Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to model typical user behavior.
    *   Profile updates occur continuously with a weighting algorithm that prioritizes recent behavior (e.g., exponential decay).
*   **Adaptive Authentication Engine:**
    *   During subsequent login attempts, *before* initiating knowledge-based questions, analyze real-time behavioral data.
    *   Calculate a ‘Behavioral Similarity Score’ comparing current behavior to the established baseline.
    *   **Authentication Levels:**
        *   **High Similarity (Score > 0.8):** Grant access without knowledge-based questions.
        *   **Medium Similarity (0.5 < Score < 0.8):** Present a *reduced* set of dynamic knowledge-based questions (e.g., fewer questions, simpler questions).
        *   **Low Similarity (Score < 0.5):** Present the full set of dynamic knowledge-based questions.
    *   The threshold values for Similarity Scores are configurable.
*   **Anomaly Detection & Alerting:**
    *   If behavioral data deviates significantly from the baseline, trigger anomaly detection.
    *   Potential actions:
        *   Increase the difficulty of knowledge-based questions.
        *   Require multi-factor authentication (e.g., SMS code).
        *   Alert security administrators.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   Data collection should be transparent to the user.
    *   Collected data must be anonymized and encrypted.
    *   Users should have the ability to opt-out of behavioral biometrics (with a fallback to standard authentication).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Authentication Engine):**

```
function authenticateUser(userId, behavioralData):
  baselineProfile = getBaselineProfile(userId)
  similarityScore = calculateSimilarityScore(behavioralData, baselineProfile)

  if similarityScore > 0.8:
    grantAccess()
    return

  if similarityScore > 0.5:
    reducedQuestions = generateReducedKnowledgeBasedQuestions()
    presentQuestionsToUser(reducedQuestions)
    if userAnswersCorrectly(reducedQuestions):
      grantAccess()
      return
    else:
      presentFullKnowledgeBasedQuestions()
      // ... handle full question set ...
  else:
    presentFullKnowledgeBasedQuestions()
    // ... handle full question set ...
```
