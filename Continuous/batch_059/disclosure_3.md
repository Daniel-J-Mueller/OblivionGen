**Dynamic Cluster Weighting Based on Temporal User Engagement**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**

The existing patent focuses on static cluster assignment and filtering. This expands on that by introducing *temporal weighting* to clusters, reflecting a user’s changing interests *over time*.  Instead of simply classifying a cluster as “dislike” or “like”, the system maintains a dynamic “engagement score” for each cluster.  This score isn't fixed; it decays over time if the user doesn't interact with items from that cluster, and increases with positive interaction.

**II. Data Structures:**

*   `UserClusterEngagement`:  A dictionary keyed by `UserID` and then `ClusterID`. The value is a float representing the engagement score (0.0 - 1.0).
*   `ClusterInteractionLog`: A log storing user interactions (views, ratings, purchases) with items in each cluster.  Includes a timestamp.
*   `DecayRate`: A configurable parameter (e.g., 0.01) determining how quickly engagement scores decay.
*   `BoostFactor`: A configurable parameter determining how much engagement increases with positive interaction.

**III. Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:** When a new user joins, or after a significant period of inactivity, initialize all `UserClusterEngagement` scores to a baseline value (e.g., 0.5).
2.  **Engagement Decay:** Every hour (or configurable interval), iterate through all `UserClusterEngagement` scores.  Apply the following decay function:

    `EngagementScore = EngagementScore * (1 - DecayRate)`

3.  **Engagement Boost:** When a user interacts with an item in a cluster (view, rating > 3, purchase), boost the corresponding `UserClusterEngagement` score:

    `EngagementScore = min(1.0, EngagementScore + BoostFactor)`

4.  **Recommendation Filtering:** During recommendation generation, modify the existing filtering process. Instead of a hard “dislike” threshold, factor in the `UserClusterEngagement` score. Calculate a weighted distance between the recommended item and the cluster’s centroid. A higher `UserClusterEngagement` score reduces the impact of the distance, while a lower score increases it. The final filtered set should prioritize recommendations aligned with clusters with high engagement scores.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```python
# Constants
DECAY_RATE = 0.01
BOOST_FACTOR = 0.05

# Data Structures (Assume these are populated elsewhere)
user_cluster_engagement = {} # {UserID: {ClusterID: EngagementScore}}
cluster_interaction_log = [] # [(UserID, ClusterID, Timestamp, InteractionType)]

def decay_engagement(user_id):
  for cluster_id in user_cluster_engagement[user_id]:
    user_cluster_engagement[user_id][cluster_id] *= (1 - DECAY_RATE)

def boost_engagement(user_id, cluster_id):
  user_cluster_engagement[user_id][cluster_id] = min(1.0, user_cluster_engagement[user_id][cluster_id] + BOOST_FACTOR)

def filter_recommendations(user_id, recommended_items, cluster_centroids):
  filtered_items = []
  for item in recommended_items:
    closest_cluster = find_closest_cluster(item, cluster_centroids) # Function to find the closest cluster to the item
    distance = calculate_distance(item, cluster_centroids[closest_cluster]) # Function to calculate the distance between the item and the cluster centroid
    engagement_score = user_cluster_engagement.get(user_id, {}).get(closest_cluster, 0.5)
    weighted_distance = distance * (1 - engagement_score) # Lower engagement -> higher weighted distance
    if weighted_distance < threshold: # Configurable threshold
      filtered_items.append(item)
  return filtered_items

#Example usage:
#For each user:
#decay_engagement(user_id)

#When user interacts with item:
#boost_engagement(user_id, cluster_id)

#When generating recommendations:
#filtered_recommendations = filter_recommendations(user_id, recommended_items, cluster_centroids)
```

**V.  Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires a real-time data processing pipeline to track user interactions and update engagement scores.
*   Potentially benefits from distributed caching to store engagement scores for fast access.
*   Scalable database solution to store `UserClusterEngagement` data.
*   Integration with existing recommendation engine.
