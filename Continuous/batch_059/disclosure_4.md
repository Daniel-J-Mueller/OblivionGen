## Merchant-Integrated Proactive Service Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand the implicit review system to proactively adjust service *during* an engagement, rather than solely post-engagement. Leverage real-time data to infer customer dissatisfaction and trigger automated service adjustments (e.g., offering a discount, expediting an order, proactively offering assistance).

**Specs:**

**1. Real-Time Data Collection Module:**

*   **Inputs:**
    *   Engagement Data: Transaction amounts, item types, time elapsed, interactions with service personnel (chat logs, audio analysis of vocal tone - sentiment analysis), location data (dwell time in specific areas), biometric data (heart rate via wearable integration - *optional, requires explicit consent*), device motion (indicating frustration - e.g. rapid tapping).
    *   Merchant Data: Item availability, staffing levels, current promotions, historical customer feedback, peak hours.
*   **Processing:**  Time-series analysis to identify patterns indicative of customer dissatisfaction.  Establish baseline behavior for each customer (based on historical data).  Calculate a "Dissatisfaction Score" dynamically.
*   **Outputs:** Dissatisfaction Score, identified potential issues (e.g., long wait times, item out of stock), triggers for automated service adjustments.

**2. Automated Service Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Inputs:** Dissatisfaction Score, identified potential issues, Merchant Data, pre-defined adjustment rules.
*   **Adjustment Rules:** A configurable set of rules that map Dissatisfaction Scores and potential issues to specific service adjustments. Examples:
    *   If Dissatisfaction Score > 0.7 AND Wait Time > 10 minutes: Offer 10% discount.
    *   If Item Out of Stock AND Dissatisfaction Score > 0.5: Proactively offer a similar alternative with free expedited shipping.
    *   If Negative Sentiment Detected in Chat AND Dissatisfaction Score > 0.6:  Alert a human support agent to intervene.
*   **Outputs:** Commands to execute service adjustments (e.g., apply discount to transaction, trigger expedited shipping, alert support agent).

**3.  A/B Testing & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Mechanism:** Randomly assign customers to control and experimental groups.  Experimental group receives proactive service adjustments.
*   **Metrics:** Track key metrics such as:
    *   Customer satisfaction (via post-engagement surveys).
    *   Transaction completion rate.
    *   Average transaction value.
    *   Repeat business.
*   **Analysis:** Use A/B testing results to refine adjustment rules and optimize performance. The machine learning model would be trained to predict which adjustments are most effective for specific customers and scenarios.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Real-time data collection module
While (engagement ongoing) {
  data = collectEngagementData();
  dissatisfactionScore = calculateDissatisfactionScore(data);
  issue = identifyIssue(data);

  if (dissatisfactionScore > threshold) {
    triggerServiceAdjustment(issue, dissatisfactionScore);
  }
}

//calculateDissatisfactionScore Function:
function calculateDissatisfactionScore(data) {
  // Apply machine learning model trained on historical data
  // Inputs: Engagement Data
  // Output: Dissatisfaction Score (0-1)
}

//triggerServiceAdjustment Function:
function triggerServiceAdjustment(issue, score) {
  // Determine appropriate adjustment based on issue and score
  // (using predefined rules and/or machine learning model)
  adjustment = selectAdjustment(issue, score);
  executeAdjustment(adjustment);
}
```
