## Adaptive Item Authority via Generative Models

**Concept:** Extend the item authority system to *generate* missing attribute values for item descriptions, improving matching accuracy and expanding the system's applicability to incomplete data. Instead of solely relying on existing attributes, utilize generative AI to fill in gaps, creating a more robust comparison.

**Specs:**

**1. Generative Attribute Completion Module:**

   *   **Input:** Item Description (textual), Existing Attributes (key-value pairs)
   *   **Model:** Fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) - specifically, a model trained on product catalogs and descriptions. Models like BERT, RoBERTa, or specialized e-commerce LLMs are suitable.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  The LLM receives the Item Description and Existing Attributes.
        2.  The LLM is prompted to *predict* missing attributes relevant to the item category. The prompt should be dynamic, incorporating known attributes to guide generation (e.g., “Given a ‘red cotton t-shirt’ and known attribute ‘size: large’, predict the ‘material’ and ‘sleeve length’ attributes”).
        3.  The LLM outputs a set of predicted attribute-value pairs with associated confidence scores.
   *   **Output:** Enhanced Item Description – Original Item Description + Predicted Attributes (with confidence scores).

**2. Dynamic Similarity Weighting:**

   *   **Integration:**  Connects to the existing similarity score calculation engine.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  For each attribute, calculate a ‘reliability weight’. This weight is derived from the confidence score generated by the Generative Attribute Completion Module.  Higher confidence = higher weight.
        2.  Adjust the attribute similarity score based on its reliability weight.  The formula: `Weighted Attribute Score = Attribute Score * Reliability Weight`.
        3.  Aggregate the weighted attribute scores to derive the overall similarity score.

**3. Category-Specific Generative Models:**

   *   **Architecture:** Maintain a library of specialized generative models, each trained on a specific product category (e.g., electronics, clothing, books).
   *   **Selection:** An initial classification module (using a pre-trained NLP model) determines the item category based on the Item Description.
   *   **Routing:** The system routes the Item Description to the appropriate category-specific generative model.

**4. Active Learning Loop:**

   *   **Monitoring:** Track instances where the system identifies ambiguous matches or low-confidence predictions.
   *   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Present these instances to human reviewers for validation and correction.
   *   **Retraining:**  Use the validated data to continuously retrain and improve the generative models.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_similarity(item_description, item_definition):
  # 1. Enhance Item Description with Generative Model
  enhanced_description = generate_missing_attributes(item_description)

  # 2. Calculate Attribute Scores for all attributes
  attribute_scores = calculate_attribute_scores(enhanced_description, item_definition)

  # 3. Apply Reliability Weights
  weighted_scores = {}
  for attribute, score in attribute_scores.items():
    reliability_weight = get_reliability_weight(attribute, enhanced_description)
    weighted_scores[attribute] = score * reliability_weight

  # 4. Aggregate Weighted Scores
  overall_similarity_score = sum(weighted_scores.values())

  return overall_similarity_score
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large, high-quality product catalog data for training generative models.
*   Labeled data for active learning (human-validated matches and corrections).
*   Category taxonomy for routing to category-specific models.
