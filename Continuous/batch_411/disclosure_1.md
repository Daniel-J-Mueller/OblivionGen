## Dynamic Environmental Storytelling via Robotic Navigation

**Concept:** Expand the robotic navigation system to actively *create* a narrative experience for humans within a physical space, layering 'story beats' onto the environment via nuanced movement and interaction. The robot isn’t simply *avoiding* obstacles; it's *composing* an environmental story.

**Specifications:**

*   **Narrative Engine:** A hierarchical narrative structure defines possible 'story arcs' for a given environment. These arcs are composed of 'beats' - specific locations and/or actions. Beats are weighted based on context (time of day, detected user emotion/intent – via camera/microphone data, environmental factors – temperature, lighting).
*   **Beat Mapping:** Each beat is associated with a ‘movement profile’ – not just a destination, but a specific *way* of moving through that area (speed, path curvature, pauses, minor ‘exploration’ detours). These profiles are designed to evoke specific emotional responses or communicate information.
*   **Environmental Cue Integration:** The robot's sensors are used to actively respond to environmental cues. For example:
    *   **Light/Shadow Interaction:** The robot dynamically adjusts its speed/path to accentuate existing shadows or highlights.
    *   **Sound Response:** The robot’s movement is synchronized or contrasted with existing soundscapes.
    *   **Temperature/Airflow Awareness:** The robot subtly adjusts its trajectory to 'follow' or 'avoid' perceived airflow.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction Layer:**
    *   **Proximity-Based Narrative Adjustment:** The robot dynamically modifies the narrative arc based on the proximity of humans.
    *   **Gaze Tracking & Intent Inference:** If gaze tracking is available, the robot infers user interest and adjusts the narrative to emphasize relevant aspects of the environment.
*   **Algorithm - Narrative Path Generation:**

    ```pseudocode
    FUNCTION GenerateNarrativePath(environment_map, user_data, time_of_day):
        narrative_arcs = SelectPossibleArcs(environment_map, user_data, time_of_day)
        best_arc = SelectBestArc(narrative_arcs, user_data)
        path = []
        FOR beat IN best_arc.beats:
            location = beat.location
            movement_profile = beat.movement_profile
            path.append((location, movement_profile))
        RETURN path
    ```

*   **Sensor Suite Enhancement:**
    *   **Microphone Array:** Capture ambient sound and human speech for contextual awareness.
    *   **Thermal Camera:** Detect temperature gradients and human presence in low-light conditions.
    *   **Airflow Sensor:** Measure subtle air currents for dynamic environmental interaction.
*   **Implementation Details:** The robot integrates the ‘beat’ information into its path planning algorithm. Instead of purely minimizing travel time or obstacle avoidance, the path planner prioritizes movement profiles associated with the current narrative beat.
