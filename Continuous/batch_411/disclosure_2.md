## Dynamic Partition Sizing for Accelerator Memory

**Concept:** Extend the DMA multicast approach to enable *dynamic* resizing of partitions within the state buffer based on data characteristics *during* the transfer. This allows for efficient handling of variable-length data streams and adaptive model architectures.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Extensions:**

*   **Partition Metadata Table (PMT):**  A small, dedicated memory region accessible by the DMA controller.  Stores partition size information (start address, length) for each row of the systolic array. Initially populated with default sizes, but dynamically updated during operation.
*   **Data Analysis Unit (DAU):** A lightweight processing unit integrated within the DMA engine.  Responsible for analyzing incoming multicast data to determine optimal partition sizes.  Could be a simplified ALU with pre-defined heuristics.
*   **DMA Controller Modification:**  Enhanced DMA controller capable of reading and writing to the PMT, and adjusting multicast write operations based on PMT values.

**2. Software/Firmware Components:**

*   **Partition Sizing Algorithm:** Implemented in firmware, this algorithm dictates how the DAU analyzes data and calculates new partition sizes.  Examples:
    *   **Max Length:** Find the maximum element length within the incoming data stream and set the partition size accordingly.
    *   **Average Length:** Calculate the average element length and use that to determine the partition size.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Set a threshold.  If any element exceeds the threshold, increase the partition size.
*   **PMT Update Protocol:**  A protocol for safely updating the PMT during data transfer.  Needs to handle concurrent access from the DAU and the DMA controller.  Could utilize a lock-free algorithm or a simple mutex.

**3. Operational Flow:**

1.  Initial Setup: The PMT is populated with default partition sizes.
2.  Data Arrival: Multicast data begins streaming into the DMA engine.
3.  Data Analysis: The DAU analyzes the incoming data.
4.  Partition Size Calculation: Based on the analysis, the DAU calculates new partition sizes for one or more rows.
5.  PMT Update: The DAU updates the PMT with the new partition sizes.
6.  DMA Multicast: The DMA controller reads the PMT and performs multicast write operations using the updated partition sizes.
7.  Repeat: Steps 3-6 are repeated for each subsequent data stream.

**Pseudocode (DAU Partition Sizing Algorithm - Max Length):**

```
function calculate_partition_size(data_stream, row_index):
  max_length = 0
  for element in data_stream:
    length = get_element_length(element) // Function to determine the length of an element
    if length > max_length:
      max_length = length

  // Add a small buffer for overhead
  partition_size = max_length + 16

  return partition_size
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Improved Memory Utilization:** Avoids allocating unnecessarily large partitions, leading to more efficient use of state buffer memory.
*   **Support for Variable-Length Data:** Enables processing of data streams with varying element lengths.
*   **Adaptive Model Architectures:** Facilitates deployment of models with dynamic structures.
*   **Reduced Data Padding:** Minimizes the amount of padding required to fit data into fixed-size partitions.
