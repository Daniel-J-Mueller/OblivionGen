## Adaptive Focus & Predictive Tracking for Augmented Reality Overlays

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A combined optical/inertial measurement unit (IMU) integrated with the camera system described in the provided patent.
*   **Optical Component:**  High frame rate (minimum 240Hz), global shutter camera with a variable focal length lens (liquid lens preferred, as noted in the patent).  Resolution: 1920x1080 minimum.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** 9-axis IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) – sampling rate synchronized with camera frame rate.  Must provide data streams for linear acceleration and angular velocity.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated edge TPU/NPU (Neural Processing Unit) for real-time data fusion and prediction.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   **Kalman Filter:**  Implementation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse camera-derived depth data (from focus adjustments) with IMU data.  State vector: 3D position, 3D velocity, orientation (quaternion).
    *   **Predictive Tracking Module:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN – LSTM or GRU) trained on motion capture data of common object types (people, vehicles, packages).  Input: IMU data, historical object position/velocity. Output: Predicted object trajectory for the next 30-60ms.
    *   **Augmented Reality Overlay Engine:**  Engine responsible for rendering AR content and aligning it with the tracked object.  Supports both static and dynamic AR elements.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** System calibrates camera and IMU.  Initial object detection and size estimation performed using existing patent techniques.
2.  **Data Acquisition:** Camera and IMU continuously capture data.
3.  **Depth Estimation & State Update:**  Camera adjusts focus based on initial size estimation. EKF fuses depth data with IMU readings to update object’s state (position, velocity, orientation).
4.  **Trajectory Prediction:** RNN predicts object’s future trajectory based on its current state and historical motion patterns.
5.  **Predictive Focus Adjustment:** Based on the predicted trajectory, the system preemptively adjusts the camera focus *before* the object reaches that predicted location.  This minimizes motion blur and ensures optimal AR overlay alignment.
6.  **AR Overlay Rendering:** AR content is rendered and aligned with the tracked object, taking into account its predicted position and orientation.
7.  **Feedback Loop:** The system continuously monitors the quality of the AR overlay and adjusts the focus and tracking parameters as needed.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Focus Adjustment):**

```
// Input:
//   current_focus_setting: Current camera focus setting
//   predicted_position: Predicted 3D position of the object (from RNN)
//   current_position: Current 3D position of the object (from EKF)
//   known_item_size: Known size of the tracked item
// Output:
//   new_focus_setting: The new camera focus setting

function calculate_new_focus_setting(current_focus_setting, predicted_position, current_position, known_item_size):
  // Calculate the distance to the predicted position
  predicted_distance = distance(predicted_position, camera_position)

  // Calculate the difference between the predicted and current distances
  distance_difference = predicted_distance - distance(current_position, camera_position)

  // Determine the amount to adjust the focus setting based on the distance difference
  // (This value needs to be empirically tuned)
  focus_adjustment = distance_difference * focus_sensitivity_factor

  // Calculate the new focus setting
  new_focus_setting = current_focus_setting + focus_adjustment

  // Clamp the new focus setting to the valid range
  new_focus_setting = clamp(new_focus_setting, min_focus_setting, max_focus_setting)

  return new_focus_setting
```
