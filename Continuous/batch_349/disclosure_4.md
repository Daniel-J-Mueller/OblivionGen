## Environmental Audio Beacon Network

**Concept:** Expand the environment-aware audio routing to create a persistent, localized audio “beacon” network. Instead of just routing *from* a device as the user moves, create a network of audio beacons within spaces, managed by the hands-free units, which proactively anticipate and handoff audio streams *to* users based on predicted movement.

**Specs:**

*   **Beacon Unit:** Each hands-free unit acts as an audio beacon. Maintains a localized audio profile – a collection of prioritized audio streams (music, podcasts, notifications, etc.) assigned to users detected within its zone.
*   **Zone Definition:** Each beacon defines a coverage zone using a combination of:
    *   Bluetooth/UWB triangulation with user devices.
    *   Spatial audio mapping (visual/LiDAR) to define physical boundaries.
    *   Environmental data (sound levels, occupancy) to dynamically adjust zone size.
*   **Predictive Handoff:** Using machine learning, the system predicts user movement *between* beacon zones. Factors include:
    *   Historical movement patterns.
    *   Real-time velocity/direction from device sensors.
    *   Zone entry/exit probabilities.
*   **Seamless Streaming:** Before the user physically enters a new zone, the system proactively establishes a streaming connection to the target beacon. Audio handoff is seamless – no interruption.
*   **Priority Layers:**  Audio streams are assigned priority levels. Critical alerts (emergency notifications) always take precedence, even if it means temporarily interrupting lower-priority streams.
*   **Dynamic Beacon Formation:** Beacons can dynamically form temporary clusters to cover larger areas or adapt to changing environmental conditions (e.g., a temporary event space).
*   **User Profiles:** User profiles store preferred audio streams and personalization settings. These settings are automatically applied when the user enters a beacon zone.
*   **Audio Mixing:**  Each beacon can intelligently mix audio streams from multiple sources (user devices, local media, environmental sounds) to create a rich and immersive auditory experience.
*   **Network Topology:** A mesh network architecture allows beacons to communicate with each other and dynamically route audio streams.

**Pseudocode (Handoff Logic):**

```
function predict_next_zone(user_id, current_zone) {
  // Analyze historical movement data, real-time sensor data, and zone probabilities
  next_zone = machine_learning_model.predict_next_zone(user_id, current_zone)
  return next_zone
}

function initiate_handoff(user_id, current_zone, next_zone) {
  // Establish a connection to the next beacon
  connection = network.connect(user_id, next_zone)

  // Pre-fetch audio streams associated with the user
  audio_streams = user_profile.get_audio_streams(user_id)
  next_zone.prefetch_audio(audio_streams)

  // Sync audio playback position
  next_zone.sync_playback(current_zone.get_playback_position())
}

function handle_zone_exit(user_id, exiting_zone) {
  // Release resources and terminate connections
  exiting_zone.release_user(user_id)
}

// Main Loop (executed on each beacon)
while (true) {
  for (each user in zone) {
    next_zone = predict_next_zone(user.id, current_zone)
    if (next_zone != current_zone) {
      initiate_handoff(user.id, current_zone, next_zone)
    }
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart homes: Personalized audio experiences that follow users seamlessly from room to room.
*   Retail spaces: Targeted audio advertising and announcements based on user location.
*   Museums/Exhibits: Immersive audio guides that adapt to user movements.
*   Event venues: Dynamic audio routing for concerts, conferences, and sporting events.
*   Offices: Personalized audio profiles for employees, enhancing productivity and focus.
