## Dynamic Authentication Orchestration via Predictive Device Harmony

**Concept:** Expand the idea of predicting secondary authentication devices to proactively *harmonize* a user's authentication experience across *all* devices, anticipating needs *before* explicit requests. This moves beyond simply choosing the 'best' device for a code and towards building a constantly adapting authentication 'mesh'.

**Specs:**

**1. Harmony Score Calculation:**

*   Each device associated with a user is assigned a ‘Harmony Score’ (HS).
*   HS is calculated based on:
    *   **Proximity:** Geolocation data (if available) & network proximity to user.
    *   **Usage History:** Frequency of device use for authentication, general app/service usage.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Time of day, location (home, work, travel), activity (stationary, moving).
    *   **Biometric/Behavioral Data:** Device handling patterns (if authorized), typing speed (for keyboards), touch patterns.
    *   **Security Posture:** Device security settings (screen lock, encryption), OS update status.
*   HS is a weighted average of these factors, configurable via user preference or system defaults.
*   HS is updated in real-time.

**2. Predictive Authentication Trigger:**

*   System monitors user activity *across all* devices (with appropriate privacy controls).
*   Triggers are based on:
    *   **App/Service Access:** Attempting to access a sensitive application or service.
    *   **Location Change:** Significant change in location.
    *   **Time-Based Rules:** Scheduled authentication checks.
    *   **Behavioral Anomalies:** Deviation from established usage patterns.
*   Upon trigger, system initiates ‘Harmony Check’.

**3. Harmony Check & Orchestration:**

*   Harmony Check evaluates HS for *all* associated devices.
*   Identifies ‘Lead Device’ – highest HS.
*   Instead of sending code, system intelligently adapts authentication *method* based on Lead Device:
    *   **High HS & Trusted Device:** Silent authentication (e.g., push notification approval, biometric prompt).
    *   **Medium HS & Trusted Device:** Low-friction authentication (e.g., auto-filled code).
    *   **Low HS or Untrusted Device:** Traditional MFA (code, challenge question).
*   If Lead Device is unavailable: System cascades to next highest HS device.
*   If no devices are available: System falls back to standard MFA.

**4. Adaptive Learning & Profile Management:**

*   System tracks successful/failed authentication attempts.
*   Adjusts HS weighting based on user behavior.
*   Allows users to manually adjust device preferences and HS weights.
*   Supports creation of multiple authentication profiles (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Travel").

**Pseudocode (Harmony Check):**

```
function HarmonyCheck(userID):
  devices = GetUserDevices(userID)
  for device in devices:
    device.HarmonyScore = CalculateHarmonyScore(device)
  sortedDevices = SortDevicesByHarmonyScore(devices, descending)
  leadDevice = sortedDevices[0]

  if leadDevice.TrustLevel == "High":
    InitiateSilentAuthentication(leadDevice)
  elif leadDevice.TrustLevel == "Medium":
    AutoFillCode(leadDevice)
  else:
    SendMFACode(leadDevice)

  return leadDevice
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   Integration with digital assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa).
*   Support for decentralized identity solutions.
*   Advanced anomaly detection algorithms.
*   User-definable ‘trust’ levels for devices.
