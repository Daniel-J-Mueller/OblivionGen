## Proactive Resource Prediction & Pre-Provisioning

**Concept:** Extend the voice-driven monitoring system to *predict* resource needs before they are explicitly requested, and automatically pre-provision those resources. This moves beyond reactive monitoring to proactive optimization.

**Specs:**

1.  **Time-Series Data Integration:**  Integrate historical resource usage data (CPU, memory, network I/O, disk space) into a predictive analytics engine. This engine should support various time granularities (minute, hour, day, week) and be capable of handling seasonal patterns.

2.  **Predictive Modeling:** Employ machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet) to forecast future resource demand based on historical data, current trends, and potentially external factors (e.g., marketing campaign schedules, known event dates).

3.  **Voice-Triggered Override:** Allow users to temporarily override the automated pre-provisioning via voice command. Example: “Pause pre-provisioning for web servers for the next hour.” This provides manual control when predictions are inaccurate or when a planned outage is occurring.

4.  **Confidence Thresholds:** Implement confidence intervals for predictions. Pre-provisioning should only occur when the prediction confidence exceeds a defined threshold. This minimizes unnecessary resource allocation.

5.  **Resource Tagging & Association:**  Resources should be tagged with metadata (application, owner, environment) to facilitate accurate prediction and allocation.  The voice service needs to understand how a user's verbal requests map to these resource tags.

6.  **Automated Provisioning Pipeline:** Integrate the predictive analytics engine with an automated provisioning pipeline (e.g., Terraform, Ansible) to automatically provision resources when predicted demand exceeds current capacity.

7.  **Voice-Based Status Reporting:** Expand the voice service to provide proactive status reports on predicted resource needs and pre-provisioning actions. Example: "Predicting 20% increase in database load next week. Pre-provisioning two additional database replicas."

**Pseudocode (Simplified Predictive Engine):**

```
function predict_resource_need(resource_type, historical_data, current_usage, external_factors):
  # Train ML model (e.g., LSTM) with historical_data
  model = train_model(historical_data)

  # Predict future resource usage
  predicted_usage = model.predict(current_usage, external_factors)

  # Calculate resource need (predicted_usage - current_capacity)
  resource_need = predicted_usage - current_capacity

  # Calculate confidence interval
  confidence_interval = calculate_confidence_interval(model, predicted_usage)

  if confidence_interval > confidence_threshold:
    return resource_need, confidence_interval
  else:
    return 0, 0 # No need to provision

function main():
  resource_type = "web servers"
  historical_data = get_historical_data(resource_type)
  current_usage = get_current_usage(resource_type)
  external_factors = get_external_factors()

  resource_need, confidence = predict_resource_need(resource_type, historical_data, current_usage, external_factors)

  if resource_need > 0:
    provision_resources(resource_type, resource_need)
```
