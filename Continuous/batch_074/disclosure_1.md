## Multi-Layered Asynchronous Data Streaming with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Expand upon the unidirectional channel concept by layering multiple asynchronous data streams, each with predictive buffering tailored to anticipated data types. This allows for a highly flexible and efficient communication system, particularly useful in environments with varying data priorities and intermittent connectivity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Asynchronous Data Stream Manager (ADSM). This is software/firmware running on a dedicated microcontroller or integrated into the existing controller.
*   **Channel Architecture:**
    *   Multiple (N) unidirectional data channels. Each channel is assigned a unique identifier and priority level.
    *   Each channel utilizes a circular buffer for data storage.
    *   Each channel possesses an associated ‘Data Profile’.
*   **Data Profiles:**
    *   Dynamically adjustable parameters defining expected data types, frequencies, and burst lengths.
    *   Includes a predictive buffering algorithm. This algorithm analyzes incoming data patterns and pre-allocates buffer space for anticipated data bursts. Algorithm types: Markov Chain prediction, simple time-series forecasting, or neural network-based prediction.
    *   Each profile can define specific error handling and retry mechanisms.
*   **Hardware Interfaces:**
    *   Leverages existing internal/external interface designs (e.g., SPI, I2C) for physical layer connectivity.
    *   Requires a DMA controller for efficient data transfer between internal interfaces and circular buffers.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   A lightweight header is prepended to each data packet, indicating:
        *   Channel ID
        *   Packet Sequence Number
        *   Data Length
        *   Error Checksum
    *   No handshaking or acknowledgement is required on the physical layer. Reliability is handled within the ADSM through sequence numbering and error checksums.
*   **ADSM Functionality:**
    *   **Channel Creation/Deletion:** Dynamically create or delete channels based on application needs.
    *   **Data Routing:** Route incoming data from internal interfaces to the appropriate channel based on header information.
    *   **Predictive Buffering:** Implement the predictive buffering algorithm for each channel. Adjust buffer allocation dynamically based on observed data patterns.
    *   **Error Detection/Correction:** Detect errors using the checksum. Implement error correction mechanisms (e.g., re-requesting data) if necessary.
    *   **Data Prioritization:** Prioritize data streams based on channel priority. Allocate bandwidth and buffer space accordingly.
    *   **Channel Statistics:** Maintain statistics for each channel, including data throughput, error rate, and buffer occupancy.

**Pseudocode (ADSM Core Loop):**

```
loop:
    // Read data from each internal interface (non-blocking)
    for each internal_interface in internal_interfaces:
        data = internal_interface.read_data()
        if data is not null:
            // Extract Channel ID from data header
            channel_id = data.header.channel_id

            // Get the corresponding channel profile
            channel_profile = get_channel_profile(channel_id)

            // Write data to the circular buffer for the channel
            channel_profile.buffer.write(data)

            // Trigger predictive buffering algorithm (if enabled)
            channel_profile.predictive_buffer()

    // Process data from each channel (non-blocking)
    for each channel in channels:
        if channel.buffer.has_data():
            data = channel.buffer.read()
            // Route data to the corresponding external interface
            send_data_to_external_interface(data, channel.external_interface)

    // Monitor channel statistics and adjust buffer allocation accordingly
    monitor_channel_statistics()
    adjust_buffer_allocation()

    // Sleep for a short period of time
    sleep(1ms)
```
