## Dynamic Key Sharding with Bio-Authentication

**Concept:** Enhance secure key provisioning by fracturing the provisioning key into multiple shares, distributed across biometric signatures and device hardware elements. This adds a layer of resilience against compromise, as multiple, diverse factors are needed to reconstruct the key.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Secure Enclave:** Existing secure enclave within the processor, used for initial key storage and biometric authentication.
*   **Biometric Sensor:** Integrated biometric sensor (fingerprint, iris, voice) for user authentication. Must support secure template storage and comparison within the secure enclave.
*   **True Random Number Generator (TRNG):** Hardware TRNG for generating secure random numbers used in key sharding and share creation.
*   **Tamper-Resistant Storage:** Non-volatile memory for storing key shares, preferably utilizing physical unclonable functions (PUFs) for enhanced security.

**2. Key Sharding Algorithm:**

*   **Secret Sharing Scheme:** Employ a Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) algorithm or similar. This splits the provisioning key into *n* shares, where *k* shares are required for reconstruction (e.g., 5 shares, requiring 3 for access).
*   **Share Binding:** Each key share is bound to a unique biometric signature. The biometric data is processed within the secure enclave to generate a secure template. The share is encrypted using a key derived from the biometric template.
*   **Hardware Binding:** At least one share is bound directly to the hardware PUF. This requires the physical presence of the device for access.

**3. Provisioning Process:**

1.  **Initial Key Generation:** The provisioning key is generated by a secure key management system.
2.  **Key Sharding:** The provisioning key is split into *n* shares using SSS.
3.  **Share Encryption:** Each share is encrypted using a unique key derived from a biometric signature and/or the hardware PUF.
4.  **Share Distribution:** Shares are distributed across secure storage locations within the device – secure enclave, tamper-resistant memory, and possibly even distributed across multiple hardware modules.
5.  **Biometric Enrollment:** The user enrolls their biometric signature. A secure template is created and stored within the secure enclave.

**4. Key Reconstruction & Usage:**

1.  **Authentication Request:** When access to the provisioning key is required, the user is prompted for biometric authentication.
2.  **Biometric Verification:** The secure enclave verifies the user’s biometric signature against the enrolled template.
3.  **Share Retrieval:** If authentication is successful, the secure enclave retrieves the biometric-bound key shares.
4.  **Key Reconstruction:** The secure enclave uses the appropriate algorithm (e.g., Lagrange interpolation) to reconstruct the original provisioning key from the retrieved shares.
5.  **Secure Operation:** The reconstructed provisioning key is used to decrypt other secret material or perform other secure operations.

**5. Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstruct_key(shares[], biometric_data):
  if biometric_data is valid:
    decrypted_shares = []
    for share in shares:
      decrypted_share = decrypt(share, biometric_key(biometric_data))
      decrypted_shares.append(decrypted_share)

    provisioning_key = reconstruct_sss_key(decrypted_shares)
    return provisioning_key
  else:
    return error "Invalid Biometric Data"

function biometric_key(biometric_data):
  //Secure key derivation function using biometric data
  //Consider incorporating salt and other security measures
  derived_key = KDF(biometric_data, salt)
  return derived_key
```

**6. Failure Scenarios & Recovery:**

*   **Biometric Failure:** If biometric authentication fails, the provisioning key cannot be reconstructed.
*   **Hardware Compromise:** If the hardware PUF is compromised, the associated share is lost. Implement redundancy with multiple PUF implementations if feasible.
*   **Share Corruption:** Implement error detection and correction codes to protect against share corruption.
*   **Recovery Mechanism:** Implement a secure key recovery mechanism, potentially involving a trusted authority and a multi-factor authentication process.
