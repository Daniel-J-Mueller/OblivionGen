## Dynamic Seed Rotation with Bio-Signal Integration

**Concept:** Enhance security by dynamically rotating the seed value used for OTP generation, not based on time, but on biometric signals from the user. This moves away from predictable time-based vulnerabilities and ties authentication directly to the userâ€™s current physiological state.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Sensor Integration:** Device incorporates a multi-modal biometric sensor array (e.g., ECG, GSR, facial micro-expression analysis) to capture real-time physiological data.
*   **Signal Processing Module:** A dedicated module processes the raw biometric signals, filters noise, and extracts key features. This module employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to establish a baseline "physiological signature" for each user.
*   **Seed Derivation Function:**  A cryptographic function (e.g., SHA-3) takes the processed biometric features and combines them with a master seed value (known only to the provider) to derive a new seed value for OTP generation. The function must be designed to be highly sensitive to even minor variations in the biometric signal.
*   **Dynamic Rotation Frequency:** The seed value is rotated *every* OTP generation request. The biometric signal is captured, processed, and used to derive a new seed *just* before the OTP is generated.
*   **Bloom Filter Adaptation:** Extend the existing bloom filter concept. Instead of simply hashing OTPs with a time identifier, hash the derived seed value *and* the OTP. This provides an additional layer of protection against replay attacks and brute-force attempts.
*   **Failure Mode Handling:** If biometric data capture fails (e.g., sensor malfunction, user refusal), the system reverts to a time-based seed rotation fallback mechanism, but at a significantly reduced interval (e.g., every 5 seconds). An alert is logged, and the user is prompted to resolve the issue.
*    **API Integration:** Define a standardized API for biometric sensor integration, allowing compatibility with various hardware devices. 

**Pseudocode (Seed Derivation):**

```
function derive_seed(master_seed, biometric_features):
    // Concatenate master seed and biometric features
    combined_data = master_seed + biometric_features

    // Apply a cryptographic hash function
    derived_seed = SHA3(combined_data)

    return derived_seed

function generate_otp(derived_seed, current_time):
    //Standard OTP generation using derived seed and time (e.g. TOTP)
    otp = TOTP(derived_seed, current_time)
    return otp
```

**Implementation Details:**

1.  **Biometric Data Acquisition:** Utilize a secure hardware enclave to protect biometric data during capture and processing.
2.  **Machine Learning Model Training:** Train the machine learning model on a large dataset of biometric signals from various users to ensure accurate identification and minimize false positives.
3.  **Encryption:** Encrypt all biometric data at rest and in transit using strong encryption algorithms.
4.  **Revocation:** Implement a robust revocation mechanism to invalidate compromised seed values or biometric signatures.
5.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor the system for anomalies and suspicious activity, such as unusual biometric patterns or frequent failed authentication attempts.
