## Dynamic Geofence & Item-Specific Access Profiles

**System Overview:** Expand the access control system to integrate dynamic geofencing *around* the delivery agent's device *and* item-specific access profiles. This moves beyond simple proximity and introduces layers of conditional access based on both location *and* the item being delivered.

**Core Components:**

*   **Dynamic Geofence Generator:** Software module on the remote access server.
*   **Item Database:**  Stores metadata about deliverable items, including security classifications (e.g., 'high value,' 'fragile,' 'requires signature').
*   **Access Profile Engine:**  Combines geofence data, item classifications, and user-defined rules to create unique access profiles.
*   **Delivery Agent App:**  Transmits location data, identifies the item being delivered, and receives access permissions.
*   **Monitoring Device Enhancement:**  Capable of receiving and interpreting dynamic access profiles.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Geofence Generation:**
    *   The Dynamic Geofence Generator calculates a geofence radius around the delivery agent’s location. Radius isn’t fixed; it dynamically adjusts based on:
        *   Speed of delivery agent (faster speeds = larger radius)
        *   Item classification (higher security = smaller radius)
        *   Environmental factors (urban vs. rural – denser environments necessitate smaller radii)
    *   Geofence shape is not limited to a circle; it can be a polygon defined by pre-defined boundaries or real-time obstacle detection.

2.  **Item Identification & Classification:**
    *   The Delivery Agent App scans item barcodes/QR codes or receives item details from the remote server.
    *   The Item Database contains attributes such as:
        *   `item_id`: Unique identifier.
        *   `security_level`: Integer representing the security classification (1-5).
        *   `fragility`: Boolean.
        *   `requires_signature`: Boolean.
        *   `special_instructions`: Text field for specific handling.

3.  **Access Profile Creation (Pseudocode):**

```
function createAccessProfile(deliveryAgentLocation, itemDetails):
    geofenceRadius = baseRadius  // Start with a default radius

    // Adjust radius based on speed
    if (deliveryAgentSpeed > speedThreshold):
        geofenceRadius = geofenceRadius * speedMultiplier

    // Adjust radius based on item security
    geofenceRadius = geofenceRadius - (itemDetails.security_level * securityRadiusReduction)

    // Access requirements based on item details
    accessRequirements = {}
    if (itemDetails.requires_signature):
        accessRequirements.signatureRequired = true
    if (itemDetails.fragility):
        accessRequirements.handleWithCare = true

    // Create final access profile
    accessProfile = {
        geofence: calculateGeofencePolygon(deliveryAgentLocation, geofenceRadius),
        accessRequirements: accessRequirements
    }
    return accessProfile
```

4.  **Monitoring Device Integration:**
    *   Monitoring Device receives Access Profile from Monitoring Hub.
    *   Monitoring Device verifies Delivery Agent is *within* the dynamic geofence *and* any required access conditions are met.
    *   Monitoring Device reports status to Monitoring Hub.

5.  **Alerting and Escalation:**
    *   If Delivery Agent attempts access *outside* the geofence, or doesn't meet access requirements, an alert is sent to the remote access server.
    *   Remote access server can trigger escalation procedures (e.g., require manual authorization).
