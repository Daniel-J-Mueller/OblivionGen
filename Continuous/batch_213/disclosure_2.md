## Adaptive Message Weighting & Dynamic Tier Assignment

**Concept:** Enhance the multi-tiered queue processing system with adaptive message weighting and dynamic tier assignment. The system currently appears to focus on strict ordering. This adaptation introduces a mechanism to prioritize messages *within* tiers and dynamically adjust which tiers a message progresses through based on computed importance and real-time system load.

**Specification:**

**1. Message Weighting Module:**

*   **Input:** Original message content.
*   **Process:** Employ a configurable set of weighted features to calculate a “message weight.” Features may include:
    *   Message timestamp (recent messages receive higher weight).
    *   Message type (critical messages receive higher weight).
    *   Content analysis (e.g., keyword detection indicating urgency).
    *   External data sources (e.g., real-time sensor data indicating an anomaly).
*   **Output:**  A normalized `message_weight` value (0.0 to 1.0).  This is appended as metadata to the original message.

**2. Tier Assignment Logic:**

*   **Configuration:** Define a tiered structure (e.g., Tier 0, Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.). Each tier has:
    *   `capacity`: Maximum concurrent messages.
    *   `processing_cost`: An estimated cost for processing a message in this tier.
    *   `priority_threshold`: A minimum `message_weight` required for messages to enter this tier directly.
*   **Initial Tier Assignment:** Upon receiving a message:
    *   If `message_weight` >= `Tier N priority_threshold`, assign to Tier N.
    *   Otherwise, assign to Tier 0 (default).
*   **Dynamic Tier Promotion:**  A background process monitors tier utilization.
    *   If a Tier N is underutilized *and* there are messages in a lower tier (Tier M) with `message_weight` > `Tier N priority_threshold`, promote those messages to Tier N. This is done based on a configurable promotion rate.
* **Demotion Logic:** If a tier exceeds capacity *and* contains messages with a low `message_weight`, demote these messages to lower tiers with available capacity.

**3. Queue Client Adaptations:**

*   Each queue client layer (Tier 1, Tier 2, etc.) now incorporates `message_weight` into its processing logic.
*   Higher-weight messages are prioritized for processing within each tier.
*   Queue clients can dynamically adjust processing rates based on message weight, ensuring critical messages are handled promptly.

**4. Pseudocode (Tier 1 Queue Client):**

```pseudocode
function process_message(message):
  weight = message.message_weight
  if weight > threshold_high:
    process_message_critical(message)
  else if weight > threshold_medium:
    process_message_normal(message)
  else:
    process_message_low_priority(message)

  enqueue_transformed_message(transformed_message)
```

**5. System Monitoring & Adaptation:**

*   Implement a system monitoring tool to track:
    *   Tier utilization.
    *   Message processing latency.
    *   Message weight distribution.
*   Use this data to dynamically adjust:
    *   Tier capacities.
    *   Priority thresholds.
    *   Weighting feature configurations.
    *   Promotion/Demotion rates.

**6.  Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Responsiveness:** Critical messages are prioritized, reducing latency.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Dynamic tier assignment ensures resources are used efficiently.
*   **Adaptability:** The system adapts to changing workloads and message characteristics.
*   **Scalability:** The system can scale more effectively by balancing load across tiers.
