**Adaptive Retail Environment Projection System**

**Concept:** Augment the live video shopping experience with a dynamically projected retail environment directly onto the user’s physical space, creating a mixed-reality shopping experience. This builds upon the ability to identify products in the live video stream and overlay annotations.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Wide-angle, high-resolution projector (integrated into the remote computing device or a dedicated base station). Minimum 1080p, ideally 4K.
    *   Depth sensor (e.g., LiDAR or time-of-flight camera) on the remote computing device to map the user’s environment.
    *   High-quality microphone array for voice commands and communication.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Environment Mapping:** Real-time 3D reconstruction of the user's physical space based on depth sensor data.
    *   **Product Modeling:** A database of 3D models for all products supported by the system. These models are dynamically loaded and scaled.
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:** Algorithms that warp and blend the projected image onto the mapped environment, accounting for surfaces, obstacles, and lighting conditions.
    *   **Annotation Projection:**  Extends existing annotation functionality to project the annotations *onto* the projected product within the user’s space, not just on the screen.
    *   **Remote Control Integration:** Maintains existing remote control functionality, allowing the remote user to manipulate the projected environment and products.
    *   **AI-Driven Scene Adjustment:** Utilizes AI to dynamically adjust the projected scene based on user interaction, voice commands, and detected ambient lighting.

**Pseudocode (Scene Initialization and Update):**

```
//Initialization
function initializeScene() {
  scanEnvironment() //Capture depth data and create 3D map
  loadProductDatabase() //Load 3D models of supported products
  establishSessionWithRemoteDevice() // Connect with mobile device capturing product streams
}

//Main Loop
function updateScene(productData, remoteAnnotations, remoteControlCommands) {

  // 1. Identify Products & Position
  identifiedProducts = analyzeProductStream(productData)
  for each product in identifiedProducts {
    product3DModel = loadProductModel(product.id)
    projectedPosition = calculateProjectedPosition(product.position, environmentMap)
    renderProduct(product3DModel, projectedPosition, environmentMap)
  }

  // 2. Apply Annotations
  for each annotation in remoteAnnotations {
    projectAnnotation(annotation.type, annotation.position, environmentMap)
  }

  // 3. Handle Remote Control
  if (remoteControlCommands.rotateProduct) {
    rotateProjectedProduct(remoteControlCommands.productID, remoteControlCommands.rotationAngle)
  }

  // 4. Scene Lighting
  adjustLighting(ambientLightLevel)
}

//Function to determine ambient light level:
function determineAmbientLightLevel() {
    //Use camera to read color and luminance of the environment, and adjust accordingly.
    //This can also determine ideal colors to blend with the room's ambiance
}
```

**Operational Details:**

1.  The remote computing device scans the user’s room.
2.  As the mobile device streams product imagery, the system identifies products and loads corresponding 3D models.
3.  The 3D models are projected onto the user’s physical space, seamlessly blending with the existing environment.
4.  Annotations from the remote user appear *on* the projected products, creating an immersive experience.
5.  The remote user can remotely manipulate the projected products (e.g., rotate, zoom) using the existing remote control functionality.
6.  AI analyzes environmental factors (lighting, obstacles) and dynamically adjusts the projection to ensure optimal visual quality.

**Potential Expansion:**

*   Haptic feedback integration (e.g., using wearable devices) to simulate the feeling of touching projected products.
*   Integration with augmented reality glasses or headsets for a more immersive experience.
*   Personalized shopping experience based on user preferences and past purchases.
*   Multi-user support, allowing multiple users to collaborate in the same projected environment.
