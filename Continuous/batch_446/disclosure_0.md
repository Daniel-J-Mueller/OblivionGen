## Dynamic Sensor Array Morphing

**Concept:** The patent details a fixed sensor module. This design proposes a sensor module capable of physically *morphing* its configuration – specifically, dynamically adjusting the spacing and angle of individual microphone and camera elements – to optimize for source localization and scene capture based on detected user positions and environmental conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Construction:** The sensor module will be composed of a rigid frame containing individually addressable and controllable micro-actuators. These actuators will allow for precise linear and rotational movement of individual microphone and camera elements. Materials: Lightweight polymer composite reinforced with carbon fiber for rigidity and minimal weight.
*   **Sensor Elements:**
    *   Microphone Array: 8-12 individual microphones, each mounted on a 2-axis micro-actuator. Spacing adjustable from 2cm to 10cm.
    *   Camera:  A multi-camera array (3-5 cameras) instead of a single camera. Each camera on a 2-axis micro-actuator.  Individual cameras will have a smaller FOV but higher resolution, allowing for image stitching and greater detail when combined.
    *   Radar: Remains largely static, providing a foundational spatial map.
*   **Actuation System:** Piezoelectric micro-actuators chosen for their speed, precision, and low power consumption.  Each actuator will be individually addressable via a microcontroller.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Spatial Mapping:** Radar and initial camera data establish a basic 3D map of the surrounding environment.
    *   **User Detection:**  Algorithms identify user positions via audio source localization (beamforming with the microphone array) and visual tracking.
    *   **Morphing Logic:**
        *   **Focusing:** The microphone array focuses on the primary audio source (e.g., the user speaking) by adjusting microphone positions to maximize signal strength and minimize noise.
        *   **Wider Capture:** When multiple users are detected, the microphone and camera array expands its coverage to capture a wider area.
        *   **Zooming/Tracking:** Individual camera elements can zoom in on a user’s face or track their movements.
        *   **Obstruction Avoidance:** Microphones and cameras can adjust to avoid obstructions in the environment.
    *   **Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
create SpatialMap()
detect Users()

//Main Loop
while(true){
    update UserPositions()

    if(NumberOfUsers == 1){
        FocusOnUser()
    } else {
        ExpandCaptureArea()
    }

    if(ObstructionDetected()){
        AdjustSensorPositionsToAvoidObstruction()
    }
}

//Functions
function FocusOnUser(){
    //Calculate optimal microphone positions for beamforming
    AdjustMicrophonePositions(UserPosition)

    //Zoom camera on user’s face
    AdjustCameraZoom(UserPosition)
}

function ExpandCaptureArea(){
    //Increase spacing between microphones
    IncreaseMicrophoneSpacing()

    //Widen camera FOV
    WidenCameraFOV()
}
```

*   **Power:** Low-power microcontroller and efficient actuators. Power budget of <5W.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) with the main processing unit.
*   **Mounting:** Compatible with existing mounting interfaces described in the patent.

This dynamic sensor array will enhance audio and video quality, improve user experience, and enable new applications such as advanced voice control, immersive telepresence, and detailed environmental monitoring.
