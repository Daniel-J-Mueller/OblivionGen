**Dynamic DNS Reputation Scoring & Adaptive Filtering**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a dynamic reputation scoring system for DNS queries, going beyond simple threshold-based filtering. This system learns patterns associated with legitimate and malicious traffic *in real time*, adapting filtering strategies accordingly.

**II. Components:**

*   **Reputation Engine:** A machine learning model trained on features extracted from DNS queries. Features include:
    *   Query frequency (rate limiting).
    *   Domain age & registration details (WHOIS data).
    *   Geographic origin of the query.
    *   Historical resolution patterns (has this domain been associated with malicious activity before?).
    *   Query type (A, MX, TXT, etc.).
    *   Entropy of the query name (high entropy may indicate DGA – Domain Generation Algorithm).
*   **Adaptive Filter:**  The component that applies filtering rules based on the Reputation Engine’s score. Instead of a hard threshold, the filter uses a tiered approach:
    *   **High Reputation:** Queries are passed without inspection.
    *   **Medium Reputation:** Queries undergo further analysis (e.g., sinkholing, redirection to a CAPTCHA page).
    *   **Low Reputation:** Queries are blocked or rate-limited.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Crucially, the system incorporates a feedback loop.  
    *   **Manual Review Queue:**  A queue where flagged queries (medium reputation) are presented to security analysts for manual review.  Analyst feedback is used to refine the Reputation Engine’s model.
    *   **Automated Validation:**  Integrate with threat intelligence feeds to automatically validate flagged domains.
*   **Distributed Scoring:**  Each DNS server participating in the system contributes to the Reputation Engine’s scoring. This improves accuracy and reduces the load on any single server.

**III. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function processDNSQuery(query):
  reputationScore = ReputationEngine.scoreQuery(query)

  if reputationScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    // Pass query to resolver
    response = resolver.resolve(query)
    return response
  elif reputationScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    // Flag for manual review/sinkholing
    reviewResult = ManualReviewQueue.process(query)
    if reviewResult == "MALICIOUS":
      blockQuery(query)
      return null
    else:
      //Resolve and return
      response = resolver.resolve(query)
      return response

  else:
    // Low Reputation - Block/Rate Limit
    blockQuery(query)
    return null
```

**IV. Network Topology Adaptations**

*   Each DNS node will maintain its own reputation scores for each query, with periodic synchronization/averaging of reputations across the network.
*   A 'reputation bloom filter' would be effective at reducing data synchronization load.

**V.  Expansion Possibilities**

*   **Behavioral Analysis:** Track query patterns over time.  Sudden changes in behavior (e.g., a domain suddenly requesting a large number of different subdomains) could indicate compromise.
*   **DNS Firewall Integration:**  Integrate with existing DNS firewalls to provide a more comprehensive security solution.
*   **Client-Side Reputation:**  Extend the reputation system to the client-side.  Clients could share reputation scores with the server, providing an additional layer of security.
