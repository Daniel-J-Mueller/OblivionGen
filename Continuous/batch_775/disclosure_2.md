## Dynamic Resource Isolation via Ephemeral Network Fabrics

**Concept:** Extend the event-specific credential system to dynamically create and tear down isolated network fabrics for each event, enhancing security and resource control beyond simple permission management.  The current patent focuses on *what* a resource instance can access; this extends it to *how* it connects and isolates itself.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component: Network Fabric Manager (NFM)**

*   **Function:** Orchestrates the creation, configuration, and teardown of ephemeral network fabrics.  Communicates with the Resource Allocation Service and credentialing system.
*   **Inputs:** Event metadata (including triggering event type, required resources, and event-specific credential), resource requirements (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), and a base network template.
*   **Outputs:**  A network configuration (VLAN IDs, subnet assignments, firewall rules, routing tables) and instructions for the Resource Allocation Service to deploy the resource instance within the fabric.
*   **Internal Logic:**
    *   Receives event metadata.
    *   Selects a base network template (pre-defined for common event types or dynamically generated).
    *   Modifies the base template based on event-specific credential requirements (e.g., restricting communication to specific IP ranges or services).  The credential data *defines* the network topology for the event.
    *   Allocates network resources (VLANs, subnets, firewall rules) from a pool.
    *   Generates a network configuration file (e.g., JSON, YAML) for the Resource Allocation Service.
    *   Sets a Time-To-Live (TTL) on the network fabric, automatically tearing it down after the event is processed or a timeout occurs.

**2. Component: Resource Allocation Service (RAS) – Modified**

*   **Function:**  Manages the allocation and execution of resource instances.  Modified to integrate with the NFM.
*   **Inputs:**  Event data, event-specific credential, network configuration from NFM, resource requirements.
*   **Outputs:**  Deployed resource instance (VM, container) running the registered function.
*   **Internal Logic:**
    *   Receives event data and network configuration.
    *   Configures the network interface of the resource instance according to the received network configuration.
    *   Deploys the resource instance within the allocated network fabric.
    *   Passes the event data and event-specific credential to the resource instance.

**3. Credential Format Extension:**

*   Introduce a “NetworkPolicy” section within the event-specific credential.  This section contains data relevant to the network fabric configuration, such as:
    *   Allowed source/destination IP ranges.
    *   Allowed protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP).
    *   Required ports.
    *   Firewall rules (e.g., deny all inbound traffic except on specific ports).
    *   Service Mesh integration parameters.

**Pseudocode (NFM):**

```
function createNetworkFabric(eventMetadata, eventCredential, resourceRequirements):
  baseTemplate = selectBaseNetworkTemplate(eventMetadata.eventType)
  networkPolicy = eventCredential.NetworkPolicy
  fabricConfig = modifyTemplate(baseTemplate, networkPolicy)
  allocateResources(fabricConfig.resourcesNeeded)
  generateConfig(fabricConfig)
  setTTL(fabricConfig.ttl)
  return fabricConfig
```

**Integration Flow:**

1.  Event occurs.
2.  Resource Allocation Service receives event data.
3.  RAS requests an event-specific credential.
4.  Credentialing system generates the credential, including a NetworkPolicy section.
5.  RAS sends event metadata, credential, and resource requirements to the NFM.
6.  NFM creates the network fabric and returns the configuration to the RAS.
7.  RAS deploys the resource instance within the fabric, configuring the network interface.
8.  Resource instance executes the registered function, processing the event.
9.  After completion or timeout, the NFM tears down the network fabric.
