## Adaptive Event Granularity & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of event reporting based on system load *and* predicted future load, coupled with proactive scaling of the event processing infrastructure.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on capturing events for metric generation. However, a static level of granularity may be inefficient. During low load, high-granularity events provide detailed insight, but create overhead. During high load, detailed events can overwhelm the system. This design adapts to *both* current and *predicted* load, optimizing resource usage and ensuring timely metric generation.

**System Specs:**

*   **Event Granularity Controller (EGC):** A dedicated module responsible for dynamically adjusting event reporting levels. It resides on the service-generating machines (the "first computing device" in the patent).
*   **Load Predictor:** Utilizes time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future system load based on historical event data, resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O), and potentially external factors (e.g., scheduled tasks, user activity patterns).
*   **Granularity Levels:** Defined as a set of pre-configured reporting profiles. Each profile specifies:
    *   Event Types to Report: (e.g., Start, Complete, Error, Warning, Debug)
    *   Event Data Payload: (Minimal, Standard, Detailed) â€“ Controlling the amount of data included in each event.
    *   Reporting Frequency: (e.g., Report every event, sample every N events, aggregate events over a time window).
*   **Event Buffer with Prioritization:** Implement a buffer on the service-generating machines that prioritizes events based on their associated granularity level and predicted impact on system health. Higher granularity events (more detailed data) are given lower priority during periods of high load.
*   **Event Processing Infrastructure Autoscaler:**  Monitors the rate of incoming events and the current load on the event processing infrastructure ("second computing device").  Proactively scales the infrastructure (e.g., adding more processing nodes, increasing memory allocation) based on predicted event volume and desired processing latency.

**Pseudocode (EGC):**

```
function adjustEventGranularity():
  currentLoad = getSystemLoad()
  predictedLoad = loadPredictor.predictLoad(timeHorizon)

  if predictedLoad > highThreshold:
    granularityLevel = "Minimal"
    reportingFrequency = "Aggregated"
  elif currentLoad > mediumThreshold:
    granularityLevel = "Standard"
    reportingFrequency = "Sampled"
  else:
    granularityLevel = "Detailed"
    reportingFrequency = "EveryEvent"

  configureEventReporting(granularityLevel, reportingFrequency)

  // Communicate the current reporting level to the event processing infrastructure
  sendReportingLevelUpdate(reportingLevel)
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Services generate events.
2.  EGC determines the appropriate granularity level based on current and predicted load.
3.  Services report events at the configured granularity.
4.  Event processing infrastructure scales proactively based on predicted event volume and current load.
5.  Metrics are generated and used for monitoring, alerting, and further load prediction refinement.

**Novelty:** The combination of *predictive* scaling and adaptive event granularity, based on a time horizon, offers a significant improvement over purely reactive scaling mechanisms. It optimizes resource utilization and ensures timely metric generation even under fluctuating workloads.  Existing systems typically focus on reactive scaling *after* a load increase is detected.
