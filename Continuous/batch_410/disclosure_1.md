## Dynamic Attribute Importance Weighting

**Concept:** Expand the classifier training beyond static weight vectors for attributes. Introduce a dynamic weighting system that adjusts attribute importance based on contextual cues *within* the image itself. This allows the system to prioritize certain attributes over others, improving accuracy and handling nuanced depictions.

**Specs:**

1.  **Contextual Feature Extraction:**
    *   Augment the existing feature extractor to identify *relationships* between objects within the image. This could be achieved through object detection and relationship prediction models (e.g., scene graph generation).
    *   Identify 'key' objects or regions in the image which serve as contextual anchors. These anchors influence the weighting of associated attributes.
    *   Example:  A handbag image. If a prominent 'shoulder strap' is detected, the attribute 'has shoulder strap' receives a higher weight.

2.  **Contextual Weighting Module:**
    *   Develop a module that takes the output of the contextual feature extraction and the existing attribute weight vectors as input.
    *   This module calculates a 'contextual multiplier' for each attribute. The multiplier is derived from the proximity, interaction, or relative prominence of objects in relation to the attribute.
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        attribute_weight[i] = base_weight[i] * contextual_multiplier[i]
        ```

3.  **Training Data Augmentation:**
    *   Expand the training dataset to include images with diverse contextual variations.
    *   Generate synthetic training data by manipulating the context of existing images (e.g., adding or removing objects, changing lighting conditions).
    *   Annotate the training data with 'contextual labels' that describe the relationships between objects.

4.  **Dynamic Weight Vector Generation:**
    *   Modify the classifier training process to learn a mapping from contextual features to attribute weights.
    *   Employ a neural network (e.g., a multi-layer perceptron) to predict the optimal attribute weights based on the contextual features.
    *   Training Loss Function: Combine traditional classification loss with a regularization term that encourages the learned weights to be contextually consistent.

5. **Implementation Details**
    *   Framework: TensorFlow or PyTorch
    *   Hardware: GPU acceleration essential for training and inference.
    *   Dataset: Extend existing catalog image datasets with additional contextual annotations.

6.  **Scalability**
    *   Design the system to handle a large number of attributes and contextual features.
    *   Employ distributed training techniques to accelerate the training process.
    *   Implement model compression and optimization techniques to reduce the memory footprint and latency of the system.
