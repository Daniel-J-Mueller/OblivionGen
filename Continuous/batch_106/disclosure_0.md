**Adaptive Sub-Pixel Color Mixing via Micro-Lens Array & Fluidic Control**

**Concept:** Expand on the fluidic control aspect of the patent by implementing a sub-pixel color mixing system within each picture element. Instead of relying solely on grayscale manipulation through fluid positioning, we’ll create miniature “color cells” within each pixel using microfluidics and a micro-lens array.

**Specs:**

*   **Pixel Structure:** Each picture element (pixel) consists of an array of sub-pixels (e.g., 3x3 or 4x4).
*   **Sub-Pixel Color Cells:** Each sub-pixel contains three microfluidic color cells: Red, Green, and Blue. These cells are formed by a network of microchannels etched into a transparent substrate.
*   **Fluid Composition:** Each color cell contains a colored fluid (e.g., a dye solution or a suspension of colored particles) immiscible with the primary display fluid (the one used for light/dark contrast as described in the base patent).
*   **Microfluidic Actuation:** Each color cell is controlled by an individual micro-actuator (e.g., electro-wetting, dielectrophoresis, or a miniature piezoelectric pump) to precisely control the volume of colored fluid exposed within the cell.
*   **Micro-Lens Array:** A micro-lens array is positioned *above* the sub-pixel array. Each micro-lens is aligned with a corresponding sub-pixel and focuses the light emitted/reflected by that sub-pixel. The curvature/focus of each micro-lens can be dynamically adjusted using micro-actuators.
*   **Electrode Configuration:** Utilize the existing electrode structure from the base patent, but modify it to include individual control electrodes for each micro-actuator and micro-lens.
*   **Control System:** The display controller implements an algorithm that modulates the voltage applied to each electrode, controlling the position of the display fluid *and* the volume of colored fluid in each sub-pixel, *and* the focus of each micro-lens.
*   **Fluidic Layer:** Create a fluidic layer *beneath* the electrode layer, encapsulating all fluidic channels.

**Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
For Each Pixel:
    For Each Sub-Pixel:
        TargetColor = DesiredColorForSubPixel
        CalculateRed, Green, Blue components of TargetColor
        RedVolume = Map(RedComponent, 0, 1, 0, MaxRedVolume)
        GreenVolume = Map(GreenComponent, 0, 1, 0, MaxGreenVolume)
        BlueVolume = Map(BlueComponent, 0, 1, 0, MaxBlueVolume)

        ApplyVoltageToRedActuator(RedVolume)
        ApplyVoltageToGreenActuator(GreenVolume)
        ApplyVoltageToBlueActuator(BlueVolume)

        // Adjust Lens Focus for Brightness/Contrast
        LensFocus = CalculateLensFocus(DesiredBrightness, DesiredContrast)
        ApplyVoltageToLensActuator(LensFocus)

    // Adjust Main Fluid for overall brightness/darkness of pixel
    PixelBrightness = CalculatePixelBrightness()
    ApplyVoltageToMainFluidElectrode(PixelBrightness)
```

**Innovation Details:**

*   **Enhanced Color Gamut:** By precisely controlling the mix of red, green, and blue fluids at the sub-pixel level, we can achieve a significantly wider color gamut than traditional displays.
*   **Improved Contrast Ratio:** Dynamic lens control allows us to focus or defocus light, increasing perceived contrast.
*   **Reduced Power Consumption:** By selectively activating sub-pixels, we can reduce overall power consumption.
*   **Increased Viewing Angles:** Micro-lens array helps to maintain brightness and color accuracy at wider viewing angles.
*   **Dynamic Pixel Restructuring**: This system allows for a degree of 'pixel restructuring', enabling the display to shift between sub-pixel configurations. For instance, in low-light conditions, subpixels can be combined to increase perceived brightness.
