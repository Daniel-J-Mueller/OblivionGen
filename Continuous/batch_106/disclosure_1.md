## Dynamic Frequency Allocation via Predictive Interference Modeling

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-band radio transceiver (Wi-Fi 6E/7 capable), dedicated hardware acceleration for FFT/signal processing, high-precision timing module (GPS/atomic clock sync), dedicated low-power processor for model execution.
*   **Software:** Machine learning framework (TensorFlow Lite/PyTorch Mobile), real-time operating system (RTOS), custom interference prediction model, dynamic frequency allocation algorithm, data logging/telemetry system.

**Innovation Description:**

The system predicts interference *before* it happens, allowing proactive frequency hopping, rather than reactive avoidance, in wireless communication. It builds upon the idea of identifying frequencies susceptible to interference but moves beyond simple error rate measurement.

1.  **Interference Landscape Mapping:** Continuously scan the RF environment, not just for current interference, but to build a probabilistic ‘map’ of interference sources. This goes beyond identifying the *presence* of interference, it tries to anticipate *when* interference will occur based on learned patterns. This includes location, time of day, day of week, and even correlating with external data sources (e.g. known event schedules in a stadium). This will require the dedicated hardware for fast FFT/signal processing.
2.  **Predictive Modeling:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network - RNN/LSTM, or transformer network) is trained on historical interference data. Input features: time, location, signal strength of neighboring networks, detected Bluetooth/Zigbee activity, external event data. Output: Probability of interference on each frequency band/channel over a short time horizon (e.g., next 5-10 seconds).
3.  **Dynamic Frequency Hopping:** Instead of simply switching frequencies when interference is *detected*, the system proactively hops to frequencies predicted to be *least* susceptible to interference. This is achieved using a dynamic frequency allocation algorithm. The algorithm will have a 'cost function' that considers both predicted interference probability and channel utilization.
4.  **Reinforcement Learning Feedback:** The system uses reinforcement learning to continuously improve the accuracy of its interference predictions. The reward function will be based on successful data transmission rates and minimizing packet loss. This allows the system to adapt to changing RF environments and learn the behavior of interference sources.
5.  **Multi-Radio Coordination:** In a multi-radio environment (e.g., a device with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth), the system coordinates frequency allocation across all radios to minimize interference between them. This involves sharing interference predictions and coordinating frequency hopping patterns.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Frequency Allocation Algorithm):**

```
// Initialize:
interference_map = {} // Dictionary: frequency -> interference probability
current_frequency = initial_frequency

// Main Loop:
while (true) {

    // 1. Update Interference Map:
    interference_map = predict_interference(current_time, location, surrounding_networks)

    // 2. Calculate Cost for each available frequency:
    for each frequency in available_frequencies:
        cost = interference_map[frequency] + channel_utilization[frequency]

    // 3. Select optimal frequency with lowest cost:
    optimal_frequency = frequency with minimum cost

    // 4. Switch to optimal frequency:
    switch_frequency(optimal_frequency)

    // 5. Update current_frequency
    current_frequency = optimal_frequency
}
```

**Data Logging/Telemetry:**

The system logs all interference data, frequency hopping patterns, and performance metrics (packet loss, throughput) to a central server. This data can be used to further train the interference prediction model and optimize the dynamic frequency allocation algorithm.
