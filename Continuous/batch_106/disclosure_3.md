**Automated Schema Remediation & Synthetic Data Generation**

**Core Concept:** Extend the database migration service to not just *identify* schema incompatibilities, but to *automatically remediate* them using a combination of rule-based transformations and AI-driven synthetic data generation. The goal is to minimize or eliminate manual re-coding, dramatically accelerating migration timelines and reducing risk.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Schema Remediation Engine (SRE) â€“ integrated module within the existing Database Migration Service.
*   **Input:** Source schema, target schema, identified incompatibilities (from existing compatibility analysis).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Rule-Based Transformation:** SRE applies a library of pre-defined transformation rules to address common schema incompatibilities (e.g., data type conversions, column renaming, splitting/merging columns).  Rules are configurable and extensible.
    2.  **AI-Driven Synthetic Data Generation:** For complex incompatibilities that require semantic understanding (e.g., restructuring hierarchical data), the SRE leverages a generative AI model (e.g., a Transformer-based architecture) trained on a large corpus of schema and data patterns. This model generates *synthetic* data representative of the source data, but conforming to the target schema.  
    3.  **Validation & Refinement:**  Synthetic data is validated against business rules and data quality constraints defined by the user.  An iterative refinement process adjusts the generative model to improve the accuracy and relevance of the synthetic data.
    4.  **Automated Schema Update:**  The SRE automatically updates the target schema based on the transformed data and synthetic data patterns.

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  User initiates migration and specifies source and target databases.
    2.  Compatibility analysis identifies incompatibilities.
    3.  SRE attempts rule-based transformations.
    4.  If transformations fail, SRE invokes the AI model to generate synthetic data.
    5.  Synthetic data is validated against user-defined constraints.
    6.  Target schema is updated.
    7.  Data migration proceeds using the updated target schema.

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /schema-remediation/transform`:  Initiates schema transformation. Takes source schema, target schema, and transformation rules as input. Returns transformed schema.
    *   `POST /schema-remediation/generate-data`:  Generates synthetic data.  Takes source schema, target schema, and constraints as input. Returns synthetic data.
    *   `GET /schema-remediation/status`: Retrieves the status of a schema remediation operation.

*   **Pseudocode (AI Model Training):**

```
function train_ai_model(source_schemas, target_schemas, data_corpus):
    model = TransformerModel()
    optimizer = AdamOptimizer()

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        for source_schema, target_schema, data in data_corpus:
            # Encode source schema and data
            source_encoding = encode_schema(source_schema)
            data_encoding = encode_data(data)

            # Predict target schema
            predicted_target_schema = model.predict(source_encoding, data_encoding)

            # Calculate loss (difference between predicted and actual target schema)
            loss = calculate_schema_loss(predicted_target_schema, target_schema)

            # Update model weights
            optimizer.update(model.weights, loss)

    return model
```

*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Transformation rule library stored in a database.
    *   Trained AI models stored in a model registry.
    *   Validation rules and constraints stored in a user profile.
