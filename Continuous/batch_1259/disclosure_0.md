## Adaptive Honeypot Network based on Client Addressing Combinations

**Concept:** Leverage the existing system of distributing unique addressing information combinations to clients to create a dynamic, adaptive honeypot network *within* the content delivery system. Instead of statically defined honeypots, the system intelligently designates clients receiving specific, rarely-used address combinations as potential honeypots, monitoring their traffic for malicious activity.

**System Components:**

*   **Honeypot Designation Engine:** A module within the name resolution server that probabilistically designates clients as honeypots based on the uniqueness and relative inactivity of the address combination they receive.  Rarer combinations = higher probability. A ‘honeypot lifetime’ parameter is also introduced.
*   **Traffic Mirroring & Analysis:**  All traffic destined for the address combinations assigned to designated honeypots is mirrored to a dedicated analysis engine. This analysis engine uses behavioral analysis (rather than signature-based detection) to identify malicious activity.
*   **Dynamic Reputation System:** Honeypots aren't treated equally. Performance metrics (attack rate, type of attack) feed into a dynamic reputation system. High-reputation honeypots get increased monitoring & potentially trigger more aggressive countermeasures.
*   **Adaptive Countermeasures:** Upon detection of malicious activity, the system can dynamically adjust countermeasures. This could include rate limiting, packet dropping, or redirecting traffic to a blackhole.  The intensity of the response is tied to the honeypot’s reputation and the severity of the attack.
*   **Address Combination Pool:** A pool of rarely used addressing information sets that are used specifically for the adaptive honeypot network. This is separate from the main addressing pool.

**Pseudocode (Honeypot Designation Engine):**

```
function designate_honeypots(client_identifier, address_combination_pool):
  // Probability scales with rarity of combination
  combination_rarity = calculate_rarity(address_combination_pool, address_combination)

  // Adjust probability based on historical attack data for that combination
  historical_attack_risk = get_historical_attack_risk(address_combination)

  // Calculate a combined probability score
  probability_score = combination_rarity * (1 - historical_attack_risk)

  // Randomly designate as honeypot based on score
  if random() < probability_score:
    mark_as_honeypot(client_identifier, address_combination)
    set_honeypot_lifetime(client_identifier, random(MIN_LIFETIME, MAX_LIFETIME))
  end if
end function

function set_honeypot_lifetime(client_identifier, lifetime):
  // Set timer to remove honeypot designation after 'lifetime'
  set_timer(remove_honeypot_designation, client_identifier, lifetime)
end function

function remove_honeypot_designation(client_identifier):
  // Remove client from honeypot list
  remove_from_honeypot_list(client_identifier)
end function
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Honeypot List:**  A list of client identifiers currently designated as honeypots, along with their assigned address combinations and remaining lifetime.
*   **Address Combination Statistics:**  Stores usage statistics for each address combination – how often it's assigned, to whom, and any associated attack data.

**Innovation:** This moves beyond static honeypots by leveraging the existing address allocation system to create a *distributed, adaptive* honeypot network. It’s a reactive defense that learns from attack patterns and dynamically adjusts the honeypot landscape. The address allocation system effectively hides the honeypots *in plain sight*, making them more difficult for attackers to identify.
