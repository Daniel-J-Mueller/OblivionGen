## Adaptive Request Fingerprinting with Dynamic Thresholds

**Concept:** Instead of relying solely on honeypot credentials and static fraud score heuristics, create a system that builds a behavioral profile of *all* users, not just those flagged by honeypots. This allows for detection of subtle anomalies that might indicate compromised accounts or novel attack vectors. The system dynamically adjusts thresholds based on observed user behavior and environmental factors.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Feature Extraction:**
    *   Capture a wide range of request characteristics:
        *   API call frequency and patterns.
        *   Data volume transferred per request/session.
        *   Geographic location (IP address).
        *   Time of day/week of requests.
        *   User agent strings.
        *   Request payload entropy (measure of randomness).
        *   Sequential API call patterns (e.g., user always creates a VM then attaches storage).
    *   Normalize and scale all features to a consistent range (0-1).

2.  **User Profile Creation:**
    *   For each user, maintain a rolling window of behavioral features (e.g., last 30 days).
    *   Calculate the mean and standard deviation for each feature within the window.
    *   Represent the user's profile as a vector of (mean, standard deviation) pairs for each feature.

3.  **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   For each incoming request:
        *   Extract the same set of behavioral features.
        *   Calculate the Mahalanobis distance between the request’s feature vector and the user’s profile vector. This metric accounts for correlations between features.
        *   Calculate a baseline anomaly score based on the Mahalanobis distance.

4.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   **Environmental Factors:** Incorporate external data sources like threat intelligence feeds, known DDoS attack patterns, and global event information (e.g., major data breaches) to adjust anomaly thresholds.
    *   **Behavioral Clustering:** Periodically cluster users based on their behavioral profiles (using k-means or similar).  Adjust thresholds *per cluster*. This accounts for legitimate variations in user behavior. For example, developers will have very different API usage patterns than end-users.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Continuously refine thresholds based on confirmed fraudulent activity and false positives.  Use a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize threshold adjustments.

5.  **Scoring and Action:**
    *   Combine the anomaly score with the dynamic threshold to generate a final fraud score.
    *   Actions based on the fraud score:
        *   **Low Score:** Allow the request to proceed normally.
        *   **Medium Score:** Trigger multi-factor authentication, CAPTCHA, or rate limiting.
        *   **High Score:** Block the request, alert security personnel, or initiate further investigation.
        *   **Adaptive Degradation:**  Instead of just blocking, dynamically reduce the resources allocated to the request (similar to the original patent), but with finer granularity.  Instead of just "lower performance," introduce "throttled bandwidth," "delayed processing," or "reduced data precision."

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
function calculate_anomaly_score(request_features, user_profile):
  # Calculate Mahalanobis distance
  distance = mahalanobis_distance(request_features, user_profile)
  return distance

function determine_fraud_score(anomaly_score, cluster_threshold):
  # Adjust anomaly score with cluster-specific threshold
  adjusted_score = anomaly_score + cluster_threshold
  # Cap score at a maximum value
  fraud_score = min(adjusted_score, 1.0)
  return fraud_score
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `User Profile`: { user_id: int, features: { feature_name: str, mean: float, std_dev: float } }
*   `Cluster Thresholds`: { cluster_id: int, threshold: float }
*   `Threat Intelligence Feed`: { indicator: str, severity: int, confidence: float }
