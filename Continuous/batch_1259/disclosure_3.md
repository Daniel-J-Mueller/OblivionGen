## Adaptive Content Fragmentation & Reconstruction

**Core Concept:** Dynamically fragment content into smaller, independently routable pieces, and reconstruct them client-side. This increases resilience to attacks, improves caching efficiency, and facilitates personalized content delivery.

**Specification:**

**1. Content Fragmentation Service (CFS):**

*   **Input:** Raw content (video, image, document, etc.) and a fragmentation policy.
*   **Policy Parameters:**
    *   `fragment_size`: Maximum size of each fragment (configurable per content type).
    *   `redundancy_level`: Number of redundant fragments to create (0-N).  Higher levels increase resilience but also bandwidth usage.
    *   `distribution_pattern`:  Algorithm for distributing fragments across available POPs (e.g., consistent hashing, random distribution, geographical proximity).
    *   `encryption_key_rotation_interval`: Frequency of rotating encryption keys for individual fragments.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Divide content into fragments of `fragment_size`.
    2.  Generate redundant fragments based on `redundancy_level`. Redundancy can be achieved through erasure coding (e.g., Reed-Solomon) or simple replication.
    3.  Encrypt each fragment with a unique, randomly generated key (or derived from a master key).
    4.  Distribute fragments across POPs according to the `distribution_pattern`.
    5.  Generate a *manifest* file containing:
        *   List of all fragments and their corresponding POP locations.
        *   Encryption keys for each fragment.
        *   Checksums for fragment integrity verification.
        *   Fragment order for reconstruction.
*   **Output:** Fragmented content distributed across POPs and a manifest file.

**2.  Client-Side Reconstruction Module (CSRM):**

*   **Input:** Manifest file.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Fetch fragments from the POPs listed in the manifest using parallel connections.
    2.  Verify fragment integrity using checksums.
    3.  Decrypt fragments using the corresponding keys.
    4.  Reassemble fragments in the correct order according to the manifest.
    5.  Deliver reconstructed content to the user.
    6.  Dynamic adaptation: If a fragment is unavailable or slow to load, the CSRM attempts to fetch it from an alternate POP or reconstruct it using redundant fragments.

**3.  Attack Mitigation Integration:**

*   **DDoS Detection:** If a DDoS attack is detected targeting specific POPs, the CFS automatically increases the `redundancy_level` for content served from those POPs and redistributes fragments across unaffected locations.
*   **Fragment Prioritization:** During attacks, the CSRM prioritizes fetching critical fragments (e.g., those containing keyframes in a video) to maintain a minimal level of service.
*   **Adaptive Manifest Generation:** The CFS can dynamically generate multiple manifests with different levels of redundancy and fragmentation to optimize resilience based on real-time network conditions and attack patterns.

**4.  Pseudocode (CSRM - Fragment Fetching):**

```
function fetchFragments(manifest):
  fragments = manifest.getFragments()
  fetch_threads = []

  for fragment in fragments:
    thread = createThread(fetchFragment, fragment)
    fetch_threads.append(thread)
    thread.start()

  for thread in fetch_threads:
    thread.join() // Wait for all threads to complete

  reconstructContent()

function fetchFragment(fragment):
  url = fragment.getUrl()
  try:
    response = httpGet(url)
    if response.statusCode == 200:
      fragment.setContent(response.body)
      fragment.verifyChecksum()
      fragment.decrypt()
    else:
      // Attempt to fetch from alternate POP (if available)
      // Or request from a redundant fragment
      retryFetch(fragment)
  except Exception as e:
    // Log error and retryFetch(fragment)
    pass

function retryFetch(fragment):
    // Implementation for fetching from alternate POPs or redundant fragments
    pass

function reconstructContent():
    //Implementation for combining the content.
    pass
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased resilience to DDoS attacks.
*   Improved caching efficiency (smaller fragments are easier to cache).
*   Personalized content delivery (fragments can be tailored to individual users).
*   Reduced latency (fragments can be fetched from geographically closer POPs).
*   Dynamic adaption to network conditions.
