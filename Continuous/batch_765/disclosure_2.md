## Dynamic Contextual Clipping & Re-Assembly

**Concept:** Expand the virtual notebook functionality beyond simple text/image clipping to allow for dynamic re-assembly of clipped content into new, interactive documents.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing device specifications (stylus, touch sensor, reflective display, magnetometer) supplemented with:
    *   Increased memory capacity to accommodate complex document structures.
    *   Haptic feedback module integrated into the stylus for precision document manipulation.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Content Parser:* Analyzes clipped content (text, images, diagrams, etc.) to identify elements and relationships.
    *   *Dynamic Canvas:* A virtual workspace for re-assembling clipped content. Allows users to move, resize, rotate, and connect clipped elements.
    *   *Relationship Engine:* Enables users to define relationships between clipped elements (e.g., “This image illustrates this paragraph,” “This table summarizes these data points”).
    *   *Presentation Layer:* Renders the re-assembled document as a cohesive, navigable unit on the reflective display.
*   **Interaction Flow:**
    1.  User selects content via existing underlining/clipping gesture.
    2.  Instead of directly transferring to the virtual notebook, a prompt appears: “Transfer to Notebook as Static Clip?” or “Open in Dynamic Canvas?”
    3.  If “Dynamic Canvas” is selected, the clipped content is added to the canvas.
    4.  User can now manipulate the content:
        *   Drag and drop elements to rearrange them.
        *   Use the stylus to draw connections between elements, defining relationships.
        *   Add annotations, highlights, and notes.
        *   Resize and rotate elements to create custom layouts.
    5.  The Relationship Engine analyzes the connections drawn by the user and automatically suggests relationships based on the content.
    6.  User can accept, reject, or modify these suggestions.
    7.  Once the user is satisfied with the re-assembled document, they can save it to the virtual notebook.
*   **Pseudocode (Relationship Engine):**

```
function analyze_connections(connections, content_elements):
  relationships = []
  for connection in connections:
    element1 = connection.element1
    element2 = connection.element2
    relationship_type = determine_relationship_type(element1, element2) // Based on content types and connection style
    relationships.append(relationship_type)
  return relationships

function determine_relationship_type(element1, element2):
  if element1.type == "text" and element2.type == "image":
    return "illustration"
  if element1.type == "table" and element2.type == "text":
    return "summary"
  if element1.type == "diagram" and element2.type == "text":
    return "explanation"
  return "related"
```

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   **Smart Layout:** Automatically arranges elements based on their relationships and content type.
    *   **Live Data Linking:** Link clipped data to live sources for real-time updates.
    *   **Collaborative Editing:** Allow multiple users to collaboratively edit re-assembled documents.
    *   **Export Formats:** Export re-assembled documents to various formats (e.g., PDF, Word, interactive web pages).

This allows the device to move beyond simple clipping and become a powerful tool for knowledge synthesis and creative expression. It enables users to not only capture information but also actively re-assemble it into new, meaningful forms.
