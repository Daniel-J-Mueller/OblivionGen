## Adaptive Sensor Fusion with Bio-Inspired Neural Oscillations

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on relative motion estimation using sensor data and a fixed frame of reference. This design expands on that, implementing a bio-inspired neural oscillation-based sensor fusion system that dynamically adjusts sensor weighting based on environmental 'predictability'. Environments with high predictability (e.g., smooth, straight flight) would rely more on inertial sensors, while unpredictable environments (e.g., dense foliage, turbulent air) would emphasize external sensors like cameras and lidar. The system uses neural oscillations – specifically, theta and gamma bands – to modulate sensor trust and fusion weights.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Existing sensor modules (IMU, camera, lidar, ultrasonic) + dedicated hardware accelerator for neural network execution (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano or equivalent).
*   **Oscillator Network:**  Custom FPGA or ASIC implementing a network of coupled oscillators (approx. 50-100 oscillators). These oscillators represent different sensor modalities. Each oscillator’s frequency and amplitude are dynamically adjusted.
*   **Analog-to-Digital/Digital-to-Analog Converters:** High-resolution ADCs/DACs to interface the oscillator network with the digital signal processing chain.
*   **Microcontroller:** Responsible for overall system control, data acquisition, and communication.

**2. Software/Algorithms:**

*   **Environmental Predictability Metric:** Develop an algorithm to estimate environmental predictability. This could use:
    *   **Sensor Variance:** Calculate the variance of sensor readings over a short time window. High variance indicates unpredictability.
    *   **Feature Flow:** Analyze the optical flow from camera data. Erratic flow suggests unpredictable environments.
    *   **Lidar Point Cloud Density:** Monitor the density of lidar point clouds. Lower density suggests sparse environments and increased unpredictability.
*   **Oscillator Modulation:** Implement algorithms to modulate the oscillator network based on the environmental predictability metric:
    *   **Theta Band (4-8 Hz):** Represents broad environmental context. Higher predictability = stronger, more coherent theta oscillations.
    *   **Gamma Band (30-80 Hz):** Represents rapid, localized environmental changes. Higher unpredictability = stronger, more erratic gamma oscillations.
*   **Sensor Weighting:**  Develop a mapping between oscillator activity and sensor weighting.
    *   **Oscillator Amplitude:** Higher amplitude = higher sensor trust.
    *   **Phase Coherence:**  Stronger phase coherence between oscillators representing related sensors = increased fusion weight.
*   **Kalman Filter Adaptation:** Integrate the oscillator-derived sensor weights into an extended Kalman filter (EKF) for state estimation (position, velocity, orientation).  Dynamically adjust the process noise covariance matrix based on oscillator activity.

**3. Pseudocode (Sensor Fusion Loop):**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
Initialize EKF with initial state estimate and covariance matrix
Initialize Oscillator Network

// Main Loop
While (System Running) {

  // 1. Sensor Data Acquisition
  IMU_Data = Read IMU()
  Camera_Data = Read Camera()
  Lidar_Data = Read Lidar()

  // 2. Environmental Predictability Estimation
  Variance = CalculateSensorVariance(IMU_Data, Camera_Data, Lidar_Data)
  OpticalFlow = AnalyzeOpticalFlow(Camera_Data)
  LidarDensity = CalculateLidarDensity(Lidar_Data)
  Predictability = CombineMetrics(Variance, OpticalFlow, LidarDensity) // Weighted combination

  // 3. Oscillator Modulation
  ThetaAmplitude = MapToAmplitude(Predictability) // High Predictability -> High Theta
  GammaAmplitude = MapToAmplitude(1 - Predictability) // High Unpredictability -> High Gamma
  ModulateOscillatorNetwork(ThetaAmplitude, GammaAmplitude)

  // 4. Sensor Weighting
  IMU_Weight = GetOscillatorAmplitude(IMU_Oscillator)
  Camera_Weight = GetOscillatorAmplitude(Camera_Oscillator)
  Lidar_Weight = GetOscillatorAmplitude(Lidar_Oscillator)

  // 5. State Estimation
  Prediction = Predict(EKF, IMU_Data)
  Update(EKF, Prediction, Camera_Data, Lidar_Data, IMU_Data, Camera_Weight, Lidar_Weight, IMU_Weight)
  StateEstimate = GetStateEstimate(EKF)

  // Output State Estimate
}
```

**4. Advanced Considerations:**

*   **Spiking Neural Networks:** Explore using spiking neural networks to more accurately model neural oscillations and sensor fusion.
*   **Neuromorphic Hardware:** Implement the oscillator network on dedicated neuromorphic hardware for improved energy efficiency and real-time performance.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Incorporate machine learning algorithms to adapt the mapping between oscillator activity and sensor weights based on past performance.
*    **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Extend the concept to a swarm of UAVs, allowing them to dynamically adjust their sensor fusion strategies based on the environmental predictability observed by neighboring agents.
