## Adaptive Intent Drift Correction via Multi-Modal Feedback

**Concept:** The core idea is to proactively identify and correct ‘intent drift’ – where a user's underlying intent subtly changes over time, leading to misinterpretations by the speech processing system – by leveraging not just explicit user feedback, but also implicit cues from multi-modal data (e.g., facial expressions, body language captured via a camera, prosody/tone of voice).

**System Specs:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input Module:**
    *   Audio Input: Standard microphone input for speech capture.
    *   Visual Input: Camera input for capturing facial expressions and body language.  Minimum resolution: 720p. Frame rate: 30fps.
    *   Data Synchronization: Precise timestamping of both audio and video data streams. Latency tolerance: <50ms.
*   **Feature Extraction Module:**
    *   Audio:  Extract prosodic features (pitch, intensity, speaking rate, pauses) using established signal processing techniques.
    *   Video: Utilize a pre-trained facial expression recognition model (e.g., based on convolutional neural networks) to detect key expressions (happiness, sadness, frustration, confusion).  Also employ pose estimation to track body language (e.g., head nods, shoulder shrugs).
*   **Intent Drift Detection Module:**
    *   Baseline Intent Profile:  Maintain a user-specific baseline profile representing their typical intent expressions for common requests. This profile is built using initial interactions and continuously updated.
    *   Drift Score Calculation: Compute a 'drift score' based on the divergence between the current multi-modal features and the user’s baseline profile.  This score will have several components:
        *   Prosodic Drift: Measured as the Euclidean distance between current and baseline prosodic feature vectors.
        *   Facial Expression Drift:  Calculated as the divergence between the probability distributions of detected facial expressions.
        *   Body Language Drift:  Quantified using the change in pose estimation parameters.
        *   Combined Drift: Weighted sum of the individual drift components. Weights are adjustable and can be learned through user data.
    *   Thresholding: Trigger an alert when the combined drift score exceeds a predefined threshold.
*   **Adaptive Correction Module:**
    *   Contextual Re-Ranking: When intent drift is detected, re-rank the potential intent interpretations based on the multi-modal cues. For example, if the user seems frustrated, prioritize interpretations that suggest assistance or clarification.
    *   Proactive Clarification:  Generate clarifying questions or suggestions based on the detected drift. These suggestions are presented audibly. E.g., "Did you mean X or Y?" or "Would you like me to try a different approach?"
    *   Feedback Loop: Incorporate user responses to the clarification prompts as additional feedback data to refine the baseline intent profiles and improve drift detection accuracy.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanisms will be trained to model the relationship between multi-modal features, intent drift, and user responses. The model will be continuously updated using online learning techniques to adapt to individual user patterns and improve drift detection and correction performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize baseline intent profiles for each user
function initialize_user_profile(user_id) {
  // Load historical data or create empty profile
  profile = load_or_create_profile(user_id)
  return profile
}

// Process incoming audio and video data
function process_input(audio_data, video_data, user_profile) {
  // Extract audio and video features
  audio_features = extract_audio_features(audio_data)
  video_features = extract_video_features(video_data)

  // Calculate drift score
  drift_score = calculate_drift_score(audio_features, video_features, user_profile)

  if (drift_score > threshold) {
    // Intent drift detected
    // Re-rank intent interpretations
    reranked_interpretations = rerank_interpretations(drift_score)

    // Generate clarification prompt
    clarification_prompt = generate_clarification_prompt(reranked_interpretations)

    // Output clarification prompt
    output_audio(clarification_prompt)

    // Get user response
    user_response = get_user_response()

    // Update user profile based on response
    update_user_profile(user_response)
  } else {
    // No drift detected, process as usual
    process_intent(audio_data)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond traditional feedback mechanisms by actively monitoring and interpreting non-verbal cues, allowing it to proactively identify and correct intent drift *before* it leads to errors.  The combination of multi-modal data analysis, dynamic drift scoring, and proactive clarification makes it a more robust and user-friendly speech processing system. It moves away from *reactive* error correction, and instead employs a *predictive* system.
