## Dynamic Cross-Channel Persona Generation with Generative AI

**System Overview:**

A system designed to dynamically generate and refine audience personas based on a fusion of OTT and traditional TV viewership data, enriched by generative AI to predict behavioral patterns and content preferences. This moves beyond static demographic probability vectors to create evolving, individualized profiles.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Data Ingestion Module:** Receives OTT advertisement impression data (metadata, content) and user activity data (TV viewership, potentially web browsing, app usage).  Integrates with existing survey data, expanding beyond simple day-part information.
2.  **Initial Vector Generation:**  Similar to the patent, creates initial demographic probability vectors (OTT & TV) representing age range probabilities.
3.  **Generative AI Persona Engine:**
    *   **Model:** A large language model (LLM) fine-tuned on a massive dataset of content metadata, viewership patterns, and associated behavioral data (e.g., purchase history, social media activity - optional, data privacy considered).
    *   **Persona Seed:** The initial demographic probability vectors (OTT and TV) serve as 'seed' input to the LLM.
    *   **Persona Expansion:** The LLM expands the seed into a multi-dimensional persona profile encompassing:
        *   **Content Preferences:** Predicted genres, themes, actors, directors, program formats (reality, drama, news, etc.).
        *   **Viewing Habits:** Preferred time slots, binge-watching tendencies, device preferences, preferred streaming services.
        *   **Behavioral Traits:**  Inferred lifestyle characteristics (e.g., fitness enthusiast, foodie, traveler) based on content consumption patterns.
        *   **Propensity to Engage:** Predicted likelihood of responding to different ad formats (video, banner, interactive) and calls to action.
    *   **Contextual Blending:** Incorporates real-time contextual data (e.g., weather, location, current events) to adjust persona profiles dynamically.
4.  **Cross-Channel Exposure Estimation Module:** Utilizes the generated persona profiles to estimate cross-channel exposure with significantly improved accuracy.  The system can identify viewers across OTT and TV platforms even without deterministic identifiers.
5.  **Adaptive Ad Targeting Module:**  Delivers highly targeted OTT advertisements based on the refined persona profiles.  The system utilizes reinforcement learning to optimize ad delivery strategies and maximize engagement.
6.  **Persona Evolution Loop:** Continuously refines persona profiles based on user interactions and feedback.  This creates a self-learning system that adapts to changing viewer preferences.

**Pseudocode - Persona Generation:**

```pseudocode
function generatePersona(ottVector, tvVector, contextData):
  // Combine vectors with weighted average
  combinedVector = (weightOtt * ottVector) + (weightTv * tvVector)

  // Input to LLM with context
  prompt = "Generate a detailed viewer persona based on the following data: " + combinedVector + " Context: " + contextData

  // LLM generates persona profile (JSON format)
  personaProfile = LLM(prompt)

  // Refine persona profile based on survey data (if available)
  if surveyDataAvailable:
    personaProfile = refinePersona(personaProfile, surveyData)

  return personaProfile
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Demographic Probability Vector:**  Array of floats representing probabilities for each age range.
*   **Persona Profile:** JSON object containing multi-dimensional viewer characteristics (content preferences, viewing habits, behavioral traits, propensity to engage).
*   **Context Data:** JSON object containing real-time contextual information (weather, location, current events).

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Multi-Modal Data Integration:** Incorporate image and audio analysis of content to enhance persona profiles.
*   **Emotional Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze user interactions (social media posts, review comments) to infer emotional states and tailor ad messaging accordingly.
*   **Ethical Considerations:** Implement robust data privacy safeguards and ensure transparency in data collection and usage practices.
*   **Federated Learning:** Train the LLM using data from multiple sources without sharing sensitive user information.
