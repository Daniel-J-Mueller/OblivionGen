## Dynamic Key Sharding with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the key rotation idea by *sharding* encryption keys and introducing a temporal decay factor. Instead of a single key rotation, we’ll distribute key components across multiple HSMs/secure enclaves and dynamically rebuild/update these components based on time and access patterns. This adds a layer of resilience against compromise and allows for granular access control.

**Specs:**

*   **Key Shard Generation:**  Initial key generation occurs as normal, but the resulting key is algorithmically split into *n* shards. Each shard is encrypted with a unique key derived from a master key and a time-based seed. These seeds change at regular intervals (e.g., hourly, daily) controlled by a central Key Management Service (KMS).
*   **Shard Distribution:**  Each key shard is stored within a separate HSM or secure enclave.  The KMS maintains a mapping of shards to locations.
*   **Decryption Process:**
    1.  A request for decryption arrives.
    2.  The KMS retrieves the shard locations for the target key.
    3.  The KMS initiates parallel requests to each HSM/enclave for their respective shard.
    4.  Each HSM/enclave decrypts its shard using the current time-based seed and returns the decrypted shard to the KMS.
    5.  The KMS reassembles the complete key from the decrypted shards.
    6.  Decryption proceeds using the reassembled key.
*   **Key Rotation/Regeneration:**
    1.  At defined intervals (or triggered by security events), the KMS generates new time-based seeds.
    2.  New key shards are created using the new seeds.
    3.  The old shards are marked for deletion (but retained for a defined period for auditing/rollback).
    4.  The process seamlessly transitions to using the new shards without downtime.
*   **Temporal Decay:**
    1.  Each shard is assigned a “decay factor.” This factor determines how quickly the shard's relevance diminishes over time. 
    2.  The KMS continuously monitors access patterns to the shards.  Shards that are rarely accessed have their decay factor increased.
    3.  When a shard’s decay factor reaches a threshold, it’s removed from the rotation and a new shard is generated.  This creates a dynamically adapting key structure.
*   **Access Control:**
    1.  Access to shards can be controlled based on user roles or data sensitivity. 
    2.  A user might only have access to a subset of the shards needed to decrypt specific data.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation):**

```
function rotateKey(keyID, newSeed) {
  // Get all shards associated with the keyID
  shardList = getShards(keyID);

  // Create new shards encrypted with the newSeed
  newShardList = [];
  for each shard in shardList {
    newShard = encryptShard(shard, newSeed);
    newShardList.add(newShard);
  }

  // Update the key mapping to point to the new shards
  updateKeyMapping(keyID, newShardList);

  //Mark old shards for deletion (after a grace period)
  markOldShardsForDeletion(keyID);
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Multiple HSMs/Secure Enclaves.
*   Central Key Management Service (KMS) with robust access control.
*   Secure communication channels between KMS and HSMs.
*   Software agents within HSMs to handle shard encryption/decryption.
*   Auditing and logging capabilities.
