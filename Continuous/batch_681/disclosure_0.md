## Digital Legacy Orchestration – Adaptive Asset Delegation

**Concept:** Expand upon the share-based access control to encompass not just asset *access*, but dynamic asset *delegation* based on pre-defined life events and recipient capabilities. The system evolves from simply granting access to actively transferring ownership/control based on complex criteria.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Data Structures:**

*   `AssetRecord`:  (Asset ID, Asset Type, Current Owner, Delegation Rules List)
*   `DelegationRule`: (Trigger Event, Recipient List, Asset Transfer Percentage, Capability Requirements, Timeout Period)
*   `Capability`: (Capability Type, Proficiency Level) – e.g., “Financial Management – Advanced”, “Software Maintenance – Intermediate”, “Physical Access – Full”
*   `LifeEvent`: (Event Type, Verification Method) – e.g., “Death – Verified by Legal Documentation”, “Incapacity – Verified by Medical Professional”, “Relocation – GPS Geofencing & User Confirmation”.
*   `VerificationMethod`: (Method Type, Data Source, Validation Parameters)

**2. System Components:**

*   **Life Event Monitor:**  Continuously monitors data sources (legal databases, medical APIs, GPS, user input) for defined `LifeEvent` triggers.
*   **Delegation Engine:**  Evaluates `DelegationRule`s based on triggered `LifeEvent`s and `Recipient` capabilities.
*   **Capability Assessment Module:** Periodically (or on-demand) assesses recipient capabilities via questionnaires, skill tests, or integration with professional certification databases.
*   **Secure Asset Transfer Protocol (SATP):** A standardized protocol for transferring ownership of digital assets across various platforms (crypto wallets, cloud storage, software licenses).
*   **Timeout & Reversion Mechanism:** Allows delegation rules to expire or revert ownership if specified conditions are not met (e.g., a recipient fails a capability assessment within a defined timeframe).

**3. Pseudocode – Delegation Engine:**

```
FUNCTION EvaluateDelegationRules (LifeEvent, AssetRecord)

    rules = AssetRecord.DelegationRulesList
    eligibleRules = []

    FOR each rule in rules:
        IF rule.TriggerEvent matches LifeEvent:
            eligibleRules.append(rule)

    IF eligibleRules is empty:
        RETURN // No applicable rules

    // Sort rules by priority (e.g., based on urgency or importance)
    eligibleRules.sort(priority)

    FOR each rule in eligibleRules:
        recipients = rule.RecipientList
        transferPercentage = rule.AssetTransferPercentage

        FOR each recipient in recipients:
            IF recipient meets all CapabilityRequirements:
                // Initiate asset transfer via SATP
                TransferAsset(AssetRecord, recipient, transferPercentage)
                LogTransfer(AssetRecord, recipient, transferPercentage)
                
                IF transferPercentage == 100:
                    RemoveRecipientFromList(AssetRecord, recipient)

    // Check for timeout/reversion conditions
    EvaluateTimeoutReversion(AssetRecord)

END FUNCTION
```

**4. Novel Features:**

*   **Dynamic Ownership Percentages:** Rules can transfer partial ownership, allowing for phased delegation or co-ownership scenarios.
*   **Capability-Based Delegation:** Delegation is contingent upon recipients possessing specific skills/knowledge, ensuring responsible asset management.
*   **Automated Reversion:**  If a recipient fails to meet ongoing capability requirements or violates terms of ownership, assets can automatically revert to the original owner or designated secondary recipient.
*   **Integration with Smart Contracts:**  Leverage blockchain technology to enforce delegation rules transparently and immutably.
*   **Asset-Specific Rules:**  Rules can be tailored to the type of asset being delegated (e.g., different rules for crypto wallets vs. social media accounts).

**5. Use Cases:**

*   **Estate Planning:** Automate asset distribution based on death or incapacitation.
*   **Business Succession:**  Smoothly transfer ownership of digital assets to designated successors.
*   **Grant Management:**  Release funds to recipients based on achievement of milestones.
*   **Digital Rights Management:**  Control access to digital content based on user permissions and licensing agreements.
