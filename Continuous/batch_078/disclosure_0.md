## Adaptive Predictive Frame Interpolation with Perceptual Hash Guidance

**Concept:** Leverage the downscaling/upscaling logic already present in the patent, but instead of just reducing power consumption, *predict* future frames based on downscaled representations, enhancing perceived smoothness even with lower overall frame rates. This system will dynamically switch between traditional encoding, predictive interpolation, and even *hallucinated* frames based on perceptual similarity.

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Predictive Frame Generator (PFG)
*   **Input:** Raw video stream (variable resolution/frame rate). Image data characteristics.
*   **Output:** Enhanced video stream (potentially lower overall bit rate with improved perceived quality)

**Modules:**

1.  **Perceptual Hash Analyzer (PHA):**
    *   Calculates perceptual hashes (pHash) for each incoming frame. (e.g., Average Hash, Difference Hash, Wavelet Hash).
    *   Stores a history of pHashes (buffer size configurable).
    *   Determines the "similarity score" between the current frame’s pHash and those in the history.

2.  **Downscale Module:** (Utilizes existing patent downscaling techniques)
    *   Accepts raw frame.
    *   Applies variable downscaling based on image complexity (derived from image data characteristics) and predicted motion.
    *   Outputs downscaled frame.

3.  **Motion Estimation Module:**
    *   Analyzes consecutive downscaled frames to estimate global motion vectors. (Optical flow algorithms)
    *   Outputs motion vector field.

4.  **Frame Prediction Module:**
    *   Uses the motion vector field and the downscaled previous frame to *predict* the current frame.
    *   Generates a predicted frame.

5.  **Hallucination Module:**
    *   If PHA determines the current frame has *extremely* low similarity to previous frames (indicating significant scene change or rapid action), utilize a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on similar video content to *hallucinate* an entirely new frame. This is a high-cost operation reserved for extreme cases.

6.  **Frame Selection Module:**
    *   Compares the original frame, predicted frame, and hallucinated frame (if generated) based on a perceptual metric (e.g., Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)).
    *   Selects the "best" frame based on perceptual quality and predicted encoding cost.

7.  **Encoding Module:** (Standard video encoder – H.265, AV1, etc.)
    *   Encodes the selected frame.

**Pseudocode (Frame Selection Module):**

```
function select_frame(original_frame, predicted_frame, hallucinated_frame):
  ssim_original = calculate_ssim(original_frame)
  ssim_predicted = calculate_ssim(predicted_frame)
  ssim_hallucinated = calculate_ssim(hallucinated_frame)

  encoding_cost_original = estimate_encoding_cost(original_frame)
  encoding_cost_predicted = estimate_encoding_cost(predicted_frame)
  encoding_cost_hallucinated = estimate_encoding_cost(hallucinated_frame)

  if (ssim_predicted > threshold_ssim AND encoding_cost_predicted < encoding_cost_original):
    return predicted_frame
  else if (ssim_hallucinated > threshold_ssim AND encoding_cost_hallucinated < encoding_cost_original):
    return hallucinated_frame
  else:
    return original_frame
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `PHA_history_size`: Number of frames to store in the perceptual hash history.
*   `threshold_ssIM`: Minimum SSIM score for accepting a predicted or hallucinated frame.
*   `downscale_factor_dynamic`: Adaptive downscaling factor based on image complexity and motion.
*   `hallucination_threshold`: Similarity score below which the hallucination module is activated.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved perceived smoothness with potentially lower frame rates.
*   Reduced bandwidth requirements (by selectively encoding predicted/hallucinated frames).
*   Enhanced video quality in challenging conditions (e.g., fast motion, low light).
*   Adaptive power consumption.
