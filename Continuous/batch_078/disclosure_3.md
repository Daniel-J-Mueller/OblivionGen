## Adaptive Packet Payload Reconstruction & Contextualization

**Specification:** Implement a system capable of dynamically reconstructing fragmented packets *and* enriching the reconstructed payload with contextual metadata before delivery to the virtual function. This goes beyond simple reassembly; it provides the virtual function with information about the packet’s journey and potential security implications.

**Components:**

*   **Fragment Interception Module:** Operates inline with packet flow, identifying and intercepting fragmented packets based on IP/TCP/UDP fragmentation flags.
*   **Dynamic Reassembly Engine:**  Assembles fragmented packets, but *also* stores metadata related to each fragment – source interface, timestamp, initial TTL, any observed anomalies (e.g., out-of-order fragments).
*   **Contextual Metadata Injection Module:**  Adds a custom header or appends metadata to the reassembled packet. This metadata includes:
    *   Fragment Arrival Sequence Number
    *   Time Difference between Fragment Arrival (to detect potential replay attacks)
    *   Source Interface ID
    *   Hop Count (estimated)
    *   Anomaly Flags (based on fragment analysis)
*   **Virtual Function Interface:** Delivers the fully reassembled packet *with* the contextual metadata to the virtual function.
*   **Trusted Domain Integration:**  Allows the trusted domain to define policies for metadata injection (e.g., which metadata fields to include, threshold for anomaly flags).

**Pseudocode (Contextual Metadata Injection Module):**

```
function inject_metadata(reassembled_packet, fragment_metadata_list):
    metadata = {}
    metadata["fragment_arrival_sequence"] = fragment_metadata_list.sequence_number
    metadata["arrival_time_diff"] = fragment_metadata_list.time_difference
    metadata["source_interface"] = fragment_metadata_list.interface_id
    metadata["hop_count"] = estimate_hop_count(fragment_metadata_list.ttl)
    metadata["anomaly_flags"] = detect_anomalies(fragment_metadata_list)

    //Option 1: Add as custom header (e.g., IP Option or Extension Header)
    //add_custom_header(reassembled_packet, metadata)

    //Option 2: Append to Payload (requires padding if necessary)
    append_metadata_to_payload(reassembled_packet, metadata)

    return reassembled_packet
```

**Operational Details:**

1.  The Fragment Interception Module identifies fragmented packets.
2.  The Dynamic Reassembly Engine buffers fragments, tracks metadata, and reassembles the complete packet.
3.  The Contextual Metadata Injection Module adds or appends the generated metadata.
4.  The virtual function receives the complete packet *with* contextual data.
5.  The trusted domain configures metadata injection policies and anomaly detection thresholds.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced Security: Provides the virtual function with information to detect and mitigate attacks (e.g., replay, fragmentation-based denial-of-service).
*   Improved Network Diagnostics:  Provides detailed insights into packet flow and network conditions.
*   Application-Level Optimization: Enables applications to adapt to network conditions based on contextual metadata.
*   Proactive threat analysis: The enriched packets provide additional data for network-wide security analysis and threat detection.
