## Dynamic Narrative Stitching from Multi-Viewpoint Data

**Concept:** Expand beyond single-video analysis to leverage multiple synchronized video streams capturing the same event from different perspectives.  The system will dynamically stitch together segments from these streams, not based on simple scene cuts, but on *narrative flow* as determined by object interaction and emotional cues.

**Specifications:**

**1. Input:**

*   Multiple synchronized video streams (minimum 2, ideally 4-8). Streams must have timestamp synchronization metadata.
*   Annotation data for each stream (as in the source patent), identifying objects, faces, actions, and ideally, basic emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, angry) derived from facial expressions and vocal tone.
*   User-definable "Narrative Focus" parameters:  This could be a specific object, a person, or an action (e.g., "focus on the ball," "follow John," "show the goal").
*   “Emotional Weight” parameter: A numerical value from 0-10 controlling how much emotional response detection impacts scene selection.

**2. Processing Pipeline:**

*   **Cross-Stream Object Tracking:** Utilize annotation data to track objects across multiple video streams.  Establish object IDs and maintain consistent tracking even when objects are temporarily obscured in one stream.
*   **"Narrative Salience" Score:** Calculate a "Narrative Salience" score for each video segment (e.g., 2-5 second clips) in each stream. This score combines:
    *   Object interaction frequency and complexity.
    *   Emotional intensity (from facial/vocal analysis).
    *   Proximity to the “Narrative Focus” (user-defined).
    *   A dynamic ‘surprise’ factor based on unexpected object behavior or changes in emotional states.
*   **Dynamic Scene Graph Construction:**  Build a scene graph representing all available video segments, weighted by their Narrative Salience scores. Nodes represent video segments, and edges represent transitions.
*   **Optimal Pathfinding:**  Employ a pathfinding algorithm (e.g., A*) to determine the optimal sequence of video segments to create a compelling narrative.  The algorithm will prioritize high-salience segments and smooth transitions between them. The Emotional Weight parameter will affect the cost of edges – highly emotional segments will be favored even if the transition isn’t perfect.
*   **Viewpoint Selection & Transition Smoothing:**  For each segment in the optimal path, select the most advantageous viewpoint (video stream) based on:
    *   Object visibility.
    *   Emotional expressiveness.
    *   Camera motion (favoring stable, visually pleasing shots).
    *   Implement transition effects (cross-dissolves, wipes, etc.) to smoothly blend between segments and viewpoints.
* **AI-Driven Re-Annotation:** Feed the generated stitched video back into the AI for re-annotation. The AI refines object tracking and emotional state detection based on the combined video data.

**3. Output:**

*   A single stitched video with dynamic viewpoint selection and smooth transitions.
*   A "Narrative Map" visualizing the selected segments and transitions.
*   AI-refined object tracking and emotion annotation data.

**Pseudocode (Pathfinding):**

```
function findOptimalPath(sceneGraph, narrativeFocus, emotionalWeight):
  // Initialize data structures
  openSet = [startingNode] // Nodes to explore
  cameFrom = {} // Map of node to its predecessor in optimal path
  gScore[startingNode] = 0 // Cost from start node to current node
  fScore[startingNode] = heuristic(startingNode, narrativeFocus) // Estimated cost from start to goal

  while openSet is not empty:
    current = node in openSet with lowest fScore

    if current is goalNode:
      return reconstructPath(cameFrom, current)

    remove current from openSet

    for neighbor in neighbors(current):
      tentative_gScore = gScore[current] + cost(current, neighbor, emotionalWeight)

      if tentative_gScore < gScore[neighbor]:
        cameFrom[neighbor] = current
        gScore[neighbor] = tentative_gScore
        fScore[neighbor] = gScore[neighbor] + heuristic(neighbor, narrativeFocus)

        if neighbor not in openSet:
          add neighbor to openSet

  return null // No path found
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance multi-core processor
*   Dedicated GPU for video processing and AI acceleration
*   Large RAM capacity (minimum 32GB)
*   AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
*   Video editing software API (for transition effects)
*   Multi-stream video capture and synchronization hardware
