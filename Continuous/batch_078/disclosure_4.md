**Dynamic Mesh Network Localization with Acoustic Ranging Augmentation**

**Concept:** Extend indoor localization beyond purely RF-based ranging (like FTM) by integrating a distributed acoustic ranging system within the existing wireless mesh network. This creates a hybrid localization solution with increased accuracy, particularly in challenging RF environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Node Types:**
    *   *Localization Nodes (LN):* Standard wireless nodes *plus* miniature microphone/speaker arrays. These form the base for the acoustic ranging system.
    *   *Anchor Nodes (AN):*  Nodes with known, fixed positions.  These act as reference points for both RF and acoustic ranging.
    *   *Mobile Nodes (MN):* Devices being localized (UEs).
*   **Acoustic Ranging Protocol:**
    *   *Chirp Sequence*: MN transmits a unique, swept-frequency chirp signal.
    *   *Time-of-Flight (ToF) Measurement*: LNs within range receive the chirp. ToF is measured via cross-correlation.
    *   *Multi-Lateration*:  ToF measurements are used in a multi-lateration algorithm to estimate MN position relative to LNs.
*   **RF/Acoustic Fusion:**
    *   *Kalman Filtering*: A Kalman filter combines RF range measurements (from FTM) and acoustic range measurements.
    *   *Weighting*: Filter weights are dynamically adjusted based on signal quality (SNR for both RF and acoustic) and estimated error covariance.
    *   *Outlier Rejection*: Robust outlier rejection algorithms are implemented to mitigate the impact of multi-path effects or noise.
*   **Mesh Networking Integration:**
    *   *Distributed Processing*: Localization calculations are distributed across the mesh network to reduce latency and processing load on individual nodes.
    *   *Node Discovery*: A node discovery protocol identifies available LNs and ANs.
    *   *Synchronization*:  Precise time synchronization across the mesh network is critical for accurate ToF measurements. Use a combination of IEEE 1588 and local clock correction algorithms.
*   **Pseudocode - Localization Calculation (executed on a designated coordinator node):**

```
// Inputs: RF_Ranges (array of FTM ranges), Acoustic_Ranges (array of ToF-based ranges),
//         Anchor_Positions (array of known anchor node positions)

function calculate_position(RF_Ranges, Acoustic_Ranges, Anchor_Positions):
    // Initialize state vector (position, velocity)
    state = [0, 0, 0, 0] // x, y, vx, vy

    // Kalman Filter Loop
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        // Prediction Step
        predict_state(state)

        // Measurement Update Step
        // Combine RF and Acoustic measurements
        combined_measurements = merge_measurements(RF_Ranges, Acoustic_Ranges)

        // Calculate Kalman Gain
        kalman_gain = calculate_kalman_gain(state, combined_measurements)

        // Update State Estimate
        state = update_state_estimate(state, combined_measurements, kalman_gain)

    // Return estimated position
    return state[0], state[1]
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Low-power, wideband MEMS microphones.
    *   Miniature ultrasonic speakers.
    *   Edge processing capabilities on each node (e.g., ARM Cortex-M7).
    *   Secure communication channels for ranging data.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Beamforming with microphone arrays to improve SNR and direction-of-arrival estimation.
    *   Acoustic mapping to model sound propagation characteristics within the environment.
    *   Machine learning algorithms to adaptively adjust filter weights and optimize localization accuracy.
