## Dynamic Content "Weather" System

**Concept:** Extend the content rating system to forecast potential objectionable content *within* a video, creating a "content weather" map overlaid on the playback experience. This allows users to proactively adjust their viewing experience or skip sections based on personalized thresholds.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Segmentation:** Video is processed into short, overlapping segments (e.g., 5-second clips).
2.  **Feature Extraction (Expanded):** Beyond nudity, violence, and inappropriate words, extract features like:
    *   **Emotional Intensity:** Using facial expression analysis and audio tone detection.
    *   **Pace/Kinetic Energy:** Detect rapid cuts, quick movements, and high-energy scenes.
    *   **Thematic Resonance:** Using NLP, identify potentially triggering themes (e.g., political conflict, medical procedures, animal cruelty).
3.  **Content "Intensity" Score:** Each segment receives an intensity score for each extracted feature, weighted by user preference (see Configuration).
4.  **Dynamic Heatmap Generation:** A visual heatmap is generated and overlaid on the video timeline or playback controls.
    *   Color-coding indicates intensity levels (e.g., green = low, yellow = moderate, red = high).
    *   Users can toggle specific feature heatmaps (e.g., only show violence, only show emotional intensity).
5.  **User Configuration:**
    *   **Threshold Adjustment:** Users define acceptable intensity levels for each feature.
    *   **Feature Selection:** Users choose which features to monitor and display.
    *   **Notification Settings:** Users can enable notifications when a segment exceeds their thresholds.
6.  **Predictive Analysis:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict upcoming content intensity based on previous segments. This allows for proactive warnings or automatic skipping of potentially objectionable content.
7.  **Data Feedback Loop:** User interactions (skipping, pausing, adjusting thresholds) are used to refine the machine learning models and improve the accuracy of content predictions.

**Pseudocode (Content Intensity Calculation):**

```
function calculate_segment_intensity(segment, user_preferences):
  intensity = 0

  # Extract features
  nudity_score = detect_nudity(segment)
  violence_score = detect_violence(segment)
  emotional_intensity_score = detect_emotional_intensity(segment)
  # ... other features

  # Apply user weights
  intensity += nudity_score * user_preferences.nudity_weight
  intensity += violence_score * user_preferences.violence_weight
  intensity += emotional_intensity_score * user_preferences.emotional_intensity_weight
  # ... other weights

  return intensity
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance video processing hardware (GPU recommended).
*   Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Cloud infrastructure for model training and data storage.
*   User-friendly interface for configuration and visualization.
