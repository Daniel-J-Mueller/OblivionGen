## Adaptive Tag Inheritance & Temporal Context

**Concept:** Extend the digitally signed tagging system to incorporate tag *inheritance* based on resource relationships and *temporal context* to manage tag validity over time. This goes beyond simple authorization – it introduces a dynamic tag lifecycle.

**Specification:**

**1. Resource Relationship Graph (RRG):**

*   A globally accessible (within the multi-tenant environment) directed graph database.
*   Nodes represent resources.
*   Edges represent relationships (e.g., "parent_of", "component_of", "depends_on").  Relationships are themselves digitally signed by the entity defining them.
*   Each edge contains metadata regarding the type of inheritance allowed (e.g., “all tags,” “specific tags,” “no tags”).

**2. Temporal Tag Definitions:**

*   Tags now include a `valid_from` timestamp and a `valid_until` timestamp.  A tag with no `valid_until` is considered perpetually valid (until explicitly revoked).
*   When a tag is applied, the system checks for conflicting tags (same key, overlapping validity periods). Conflicts are resolved based on a pre-defined priority scheme (e.g., explicit tag overrides inherited tag, most recent tag wins).

**3. Inheritance Resolution Engine:**

*   A service responsible for resolving inherited tags.
*   Input: Resource ID.
*   Process:
    1.  Traverse the RRG, starting from the input resource, identifying parent resources.
    2.  For each parent:
        1.  Retrieve all tags associated with the parent, filtering by tags allowed for inheritance (based on the relationship edge metadata).
        2.  Filter inherited tags by validity period, considering the current time.
        3.  Merge inherited tags with tags directly applied to the resource.  Apply conflict resolution rules.
    4.  Output: Complete set of effective tags for the resource.

**4. Tag Revocation Service:**

*   Allows authorized entities to revoke tags.
*   Revocation records are digitally signed and timestamped.
*   The Inheritance Resolution Engine considers revocation records when determining effective tags.  A revoked tag is excluded, even if its validity period has not expired.

**5.  Workflow Integration:**

*   When a resource is created or modified, the system automatically triggers a recalculation of effective tags using the Inheritance Resolution Engine.
*   Changes to the RRG (resource relationships) also trigger recalculations.

**Pseudocode (Inheritance Resolution Engine):**

```
function resolveInheritedTags(resourceId):
  effectiveTags = getDirectTags(resourceId) // Tags directly applied to the resource

  parents = getParents(resourceId) // Using RRG

  for each parent in parents:
    allowedTags = getInheritableTags(parent) // Based on relationship metadata

    parentTags = getTags(parent) // Retrieve all tags from parent

    inheritedTags = filterTags(parentTags, allowedTags) // Apply inheritance rules

    inheritedTags = filterByValidity(inheritedTags, currentTime)

    effectiveTags = mergeTags(effectiveTags, inheritedTags) // Resolve conflicts

  return effectiveTags
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple tag propagation. It introduces a dynamic, time-aware system where tags can inherit, expire, be revoked, and have their inheritance controlled by the resource relationships.  The integration with a relationship graph provides a flexible and powerful mechanism for managing tags across complex systems. It facilitates fine-grained access control and simplifies tag management, particularly in large, multi-tenant environments.
