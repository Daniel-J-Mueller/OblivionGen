## Dynamic OS Personality Injection

**Concept:** Extend offline volume modification to include ‘personality’ profiles – pre-configured sets of application installs, registry tweaks, and service configurations – allowing rapid, customized VM instantiation and a differentiated customer experience. Think of it as ‘flashing’ a VM’s personality during the offline modification stage.

**Specifications:**

*   **Personality Profile Format:**  JSON or YAML.  Contains:
    *   `applications`: List of MSI/EXE installers with silent installation flags.
    *   `registry_tweaks`:  Array of registry key/value pairs.
    *   `service_config`:  List of services to enable/disable/configure. Includes configuration parameters.
    *   `scripts`:  List of PowerShell/Bash scripts to execute post-application installation.
*   **Profile Storage:**  Centralized repository (cloud-based) accessible via API.  Version control for profiles. Authentication/authorization mechanisms to control access.
*   **Agent Modification:** Extend existing agent to:
    1.  Receive a `personality_profile_id` as part of the VM configuration request.
    2.  Download the corresponding profile from the repository.
    3.  Apply the profile during the offline volume modification.
        *   Execute installers silently.
        *   Modify registry keys.
        *   Configure services.
        *   Execute post-install scripts.
    4.  Log all actions and errors for auditing and troubleshooting.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/profiles/{profile_id}` – Retrieve a profile. (GET)
    *   `/profiles` – List available profiles. (GET)
    *   `/profiles` – Create/Update a profile. (POST/PUT) - Requires Admin authentication
*   **VM Request Format:**  JSON.
    ```json
    {
        "vm_name": "MyNewVM",
        "os_image_id": "WindowsServer2022",
        "personality_profile_id": "DeveloperTools",
        "resource_allocation": {
            "cpu": 4,
            "memory": 8
        }
    }
    ```
*   **Boot Process Integration:** Ensure boot process checks for and applies any final configuration adjustments dictated by the ‘personality’ profile.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If a ‘personality’ profile application fails, the agent should revert the volume to its pre-modification state. Snapshotting functionality on the volume is desired.
*   **Security Considerations:** All profile downloads and applications should be signed and validated to prevent malicious profile injections.

**Pseudocode (Agent Modification - Apply Profile):**

```
function ApplyPersonalityProfile(volume, profile_id) {
  try {
    profile = DownloadProfile(profile_id)

    //Apply applications
    for each app in profile.applications {
      ExecuteInstaller(app.path, app.silent_flags)
    }

    //Apply registry tweaks
    for each tweak in profile.registry_tweaks {
      SetRegistryKey(tweak.key, tweak.value)
    }

    //Configure services
    for each service in profile.service_config {
      ConfigureService(service.name, service.state, service.parameters)
    }

    //Execute post-install scripts
    for each script in profile.scripts {
      ExecuteScript(script.path)
    }

    Log("Profile applied successfully")
  }
  catch (error) {
    Log("Profile application failed: " + error)
    RollbackVolume(volume) // Revert to pre-modification state
    throw error
  }
}
```
