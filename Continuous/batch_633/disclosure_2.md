## Dynamic Annotation Contextualization

**Concept:** Expand the annotation process beyond simple object detection/segmentation to incorporate *relational* understanding and contextual reasoning. The system will generate annotations not just *of* objects, but *about* the relationships between objects and their environment, creating a richer dataset for advanced AI training.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Scene Graph Generation Module:**  After the initial bounding box/segmentation annotation (as per the provided patent), this module analyzes the image to construct a scene graph. Nodes represent detected objects, and edges represent relationships (e.g., "on top of," "next to," "part of," "occluding").  This leverages existing computer vision techniques for relationship detection but *integrates it directly into the annotation pipeline*.

    ```pseudocode
    function generate_scene_graph(image, bounding_boxes, segmentations):
      scene_graph = {}
      for box in bounding_boxes:
        object_id = generate_unique_id()
        scene_graph[object_id] = {"box": box, "segmentation": segmentations[box], "relationships": []}

      for object_id_1 in scene_graph:
        for object_id_2 in scene_graph:
          if object_id_1 != object_id_2:
            relationship = detect_relationship(scene_graph[object_id_1], scene_graph[object_id_2])
            if relationship != "none":
              scene_graph[object_id_1]["relationships"].append((object_id_2, relationship))
      return scene_graph
    ```

2.  **Contextual Attribute Annotation:**  Beyond object class and bounding box, annotators will add *contextual attributes* to objects.  These attributes describe the object's state, purpose, or effect *within the scene*. Examples: "broken," "active," "providing shade," "blocking view," "reflecting light." These are selected from a predefined ontology, but with free-text fields for exceptions.

    *   GUI:  A dropdown menu with common contextual attributes alongside a “describe” text box.
    *   Data Storage:  Each annotated object stores: `class`, `bounding_box`, `segmentation`, `contextual_attributes` (list).

3.  **Reasoning Prompt Integration:** During annotation, the system will present annotators with *reasoning prompts*. These prompts ask *why* a particular object is labeled a certain way or why a specific contextual attribute applies.

    *   Example:  "You labeled this object 'providing shade'. Describe how it is doing so." or “This is flagged as a ‘hazard’. Explain the specific hazard.”
    *   The annotator's response is stored as a text string associated with the annotation.

4.  **Dynamic Ontology Expansion:** The system learns from the reasoning prompts and annotator responses. A natural language processing (NLP) component analyzes the responses to identify new contextual attributes or relationships not already in the ontology.  These suggested additions are presented to a curator for review and inclusion.

5.  **Output Format:** Each annotated image becomes a structured data object containing:

    *   Image File Path
    *   List of Objects (each with: `class`, `bounding_box`, `segmentation`, `contextual_attributes`, `reasoning_response`)
    *   Scene Graph (adjacency list representing object relationships)
    *   Annotation Metadata (annotator ID, timestamp, etc.)

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   GUI must be intuitive and efficient for annotators to handle the increased annotation complexity.
*   The NLP component needs to be robust to handle the variability of natural language responses.
*   Scalable data storage and processing infrastructure are required to handle the large volume of structured annotation data.
*   Active learning techniques can be used to prioritize annotation of images that are most informative for improving the system's performance.
