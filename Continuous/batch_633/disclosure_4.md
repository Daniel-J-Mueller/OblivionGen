## Data Object Provenance & Recomputation Graph

**Specification:** Enable tracking of data object transformations via a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of applied owner-defined code, allowing for recomputation of objects from source data and transparent auditing of modifications.

**Core Concept:**  Extend the existing owner-defined code insertion framework to not only *apply* transformations but also *record* them as nodes in a provenance graph.  This graph represents the lineage of each data object – what source object(s) it originated from and which owner-defined code modules were used to create it.

**Components:**

*   **Provenance Graph Database:**  A persistent store (e.g., graph database, relational database) maintaining the provenance graph. Each node represents an execution of owner-defined code. Edges represent data dependencies – the input and output data objects of each execution.
*   **Provenance Tracking Module:** Integrated into the object storage service, this module intercepts all owner-defined code executions. Before and after execution, it captures metadata:
    *   Execution ID (unique identifier)
    *   Owner-Defined Code Module ID
    *   Input Data Object IDs (and versions/hashes)
    *   Output Data Object IDs (and versions/hashes)
    *   Execution Timestamp
    *   Execution Environment (e.g., resource allocation, configuration)
*   **Recomputation Engine:**  Allows triggering recomputation of data objects. Given a target data object, the engine traverses the provenance graph backwards to identify all contributing source objects and the transformations applied. It then re-executes the transformations in the correct order to recreate the target object.
*   **Auditing & Compliance Module:** Enables inspection of the provenance graph to verify data integrity, identify unauthorized modifications, and demonstrate compliance with data governance policies.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Owner registers owner-defined code:**  As before.
2.  **Owner associates code with IO path:** As before.
3.  **IO request arrives:**
4.  **Provenance Tracking Module intercepts execution:** Records execution metadata *before* the code runs.
5.  **Owner-defined code executes:**
6.  **Provenance Tracking Module records output metadata:** After the code runs, recording output object(s) and associated metadata.  The provenance graph is updated.
7.  **Normal IO operation completes.**

**Recomputation Example:**

An owner wants to recreate a transformed data object because of suspected data corruption.

1.  Owner initiates recomputation request for the object ID.
2.  Recomputation Engine traverses the provenance graph backwards from the object ID.
3.  It identifies all source objects and transformations.
4.  The engine queues the transformations for re-execution in the correct dependency order.
5.  The engine retrieves the source data.
6.  The engine executes the transformations, producing a new copy of the target object.

**Pseudocode (Recomputation Engine):**

```
function recomputeObject(targetObjectId):
  graph = getProvenanceGraph()
  dependencies = findDependencies(graph, targetObjectId)  // Returns list of (objectId, transformationId)
  
  queue = []
  for (dep in dependencies):
    queue.add(dep)

  results = {}  // Store results of recomputed objects

  while (queue.length > 0):
    (objectId, transformationId) = queue.dequeue()

    if (objectId in results):
      continue  // Already recomputed

    sourceObjects = findSourceObjects(graph, objectId)

    for (srcObj in sourceObjects):
      if (srcObj not in results):
        queue.add(srcObj)
        
    // Execute transformation on source objects
    outputData = executeTransformation(transformationId, sourceObjects)
    results[objectId] = outputData

  return results[targetObjectId]
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Data Auditing & Forensics:**  Trace the origin of data and identify any unauthorized modifications.
*   **Data Recovery:**  Recreate corrupted or lost data objects.
*   **Data Versioning & Rollback:**  Recreate previous versions of data objects.
*   **Data Lineage Visualization:**  Visualize the data lineage graph to understand data dependencies.
*   **Debugging & Troubleshooting:**  Identify the source of errors in data transformations.
