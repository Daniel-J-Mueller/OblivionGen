## Adaptive Haptic Biofeedback System

**Concept:** A wearable device that utilizes sensor data to generate personalized haptic feedback patterns, not simply to *conserve* power, but to proactively influence user state – specifically, promoting relaxation, focus, or alertness through subtle tactile stimulation. This goes beyond simply *monitoring* the user; it actively *shapes* their experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Sensor – High resolution, sampling at 200Hz minimum.
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) Sensor – For measuring sympathetic nervous system activity.
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope – Detailed motion tracking (6-axis minimum).
    *   Optional: Skin Temperature Sensor, EMG (muscle activity).
*   **Haptic Actuators:**
    *   Array of micro-actuators (e.g., piezoelectric, voice coil) distributed across a wristband or patch. Minimum density: 10 actuators/cm².
    *   Actuators capable of variable frequency (1-200Hz) and amplitude.
    *   Actuators capable of generating complex patterns – not just simple vibrations.
*   **Processor:**
    *   Low-power ARM Cortex-M7 processor or equivalent.
    *   Dedicated signal processing unit (DSP) for real-time sensor data analysis.
    *   Secure element for data encryption and user authentication.
*   **Memory:**
    *   256MB RAM.
    *   1GB Flash storage for data logging and pattern storage.
*   **Wireless Communication:**
    *   Bluetooth 5.2 for connection to smartphone/computer.
    *   Optional: Low-power Wi-Fi for direct cloud connectivity.
*   **Power:**
    *   Rechargeable Lithium-Polymer battery (minimum 200mAh).
    *   Wireless charging support.

**Software/Algorithms:**

1.  **State Estimation:** Implement a Kalman filter or similar state estimator to fuse data from all sensors, creating a real-time estimate of the user's physiological and emotional state (e.g., stress level, focus, relaxation).
2.  **Haptic Pattern Library:** Develop a library of pre-defined haptic patterns designed to elicit specific responses (e.g., slow, rhythmic patterns for relaxation, sharp, pulsing patterns for alertness).
3.  **Adaptive Haptic Engine:** Core algorithm. This engine takes the output of the State Estimation module and selects/generates a haptic pattern based on the user’s current state *and* a pre-defined user profile.
    *   **User Profile:** Allows the user to customize the haptic feedback – intensity, frequency, pattern preferences.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically adjust the haptic patterns over time, optimizing for the desired response based on user feedback (explicit ratings or implicit measures like HRV change).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Haptic Engine):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(currentState, userProfile):
  // currentState: Dictionary of sensor data (HRV, EDA, motion, etc.)
  // userProfile: Preferences for haptic feedback (intensity, patterns)

  targetState = userProfile.desiredState // e.g., "relaxed", "focused"

  if currentState is close to targetState:
    return userProfile.preferredPattern // Use a pre-defined pattern
  else:
    // Calculate the difference between current and target state
    stateDifference = calculateStateDifference(currentState, targetState)

    // Select a pattern based on the state difference
    pattern = selectPattern(stateDifference) // Algorithm chooses best pattern

    // Adjust the pattern based on user preferences
    pattern.intensity = userProfile.intensity
    pattern.frequency = userProfile.frequency

    return pattern

function selectPattern(stateDifference):
  // Algorithm for choosing the best pattern based on the state difference.
  // Could use a rule-based system, a decision tree, or a machine learning model.
  // The goal is to select a pattern that will nudge the user towards the desired state.
  // Return pattern from library
```

**Novelty:**

This differs from the reference patent by not focusing solely on *conserving* power. Instead, it proactively *influences* user state through personalized haptic feedback. It combines physiological monitoring with adaptive haptic stimulation and reinforcement learning to create a closed-loop system for emotional and cognitive regulation. The emphasis is on *augmentation* of the user experience, rather than simply *extending* battery life.
