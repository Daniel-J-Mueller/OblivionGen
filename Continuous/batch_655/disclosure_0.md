## Dynamic Persona-Driven Content Injection

**Concept:** Extend the managed hosting environment to allow for real-time content variation based on detected user personas, going beyond simple A/B testing and into fully dynamic, individualized webpage experiences *without* requiring code deployment by the customer.

**Specification:**

**I. Persona Detection Module:**

*   **Input:** Client request (HTTP headers, cookies, IP address, potentially browser fingerprinting – with appropriate privacy controls and consent mechanisms).
*   **Process:**  Utilize a machine learning model (hosted as a microservice within the hosting environment) to infer a user persona. This persona could be based on demographic data, browsing history (if permitted and available), purchase history, expressed preferences, or predicted intent.  The model should be continuously trained and updated with anonymized data from all hosted customers (opt-in required).
*   **Output:**  A `persona_id` – a unique identifier representing the detected user persona. This `persona_id` is appended to the request headers before forwarding it to the customer’s application.

**II. Content Injection Proxy:**

*   **Location:** Sits in front of the customer’s machine instances.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Intercepts the HTTP request.
    2.  Reads the `persona_id` from the request headers.
    3.  Accesses a “Content Variation Store” (described below).
    4.  Based on the `persona_id` and the requested URL, retrieves a set of content modification rules. These rules could specify:
        *   Text replacements (e.g., personalized greetings, product recommendations).
        *   Image swaps.
        *   Section additions/removals.
        *   Full page redirects to alternative versions.
    5.  Applies the modifications to the request or response *before* forwarding it to/from the customer’s application.
    6.  Logging of rule applications for performance analysis and debugging.

**III. Content Variation Store:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A key-value store (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB) optimized for fast lookup.
*   **Key:**  Combination of `persona_id` and requested URL path.
*   **Value:**  A list of content modification rules (expressed in a simple declarative language – see example below).
*   **Management Interface:**  A web-based GUI allowing customers to define and manage content variation rules *without* code deployment.  Rules should be versioned and A/B tested.

**IV. Rule Language (Example):**

```json
[
  {
    "selector": "#hero-headline",
    "operation": "replace",
    "value": "Special Offer for {{persona.loyalty_tier}} Members!"
  },
  {
    "selector": ".recommended-products",
    "operation": "insert",
    "content": "<img src='personalized_product.jpg' alt='Recommended for You'>"
  },
  {
    "selector": "#call-to-action",
    "operation": "replace",
    "value": "Get Your Exclusive Discount!"
  }
]
```

**Pseudocode (Content Injection Proxy):**

```python
def handle_request(request):
  persona_id = request.headers.get("X-Persona-Id")
  url = request.url
  
  rules = content_variation_store.get(persona_id, url)
  
  if rules:
    modified_request = apply_rules(request, rules)
  else:
    modified_request = request
  
  response = customer_instance.handle(modified_request)
  
  return response
```

**Scaling & Resilience:**

*   The Persona Detection Module and Content Injection Proxy should be horizontally scalable.
*   Caching should be employed to reduce latency and load on the Content Variation Store.
*   Monitoring and alerting should be implemented to detect and address performance issues.
