**Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Predictive Beamforming**

**Concept:** Extend the hands-free switching concept beyond simply moving a device *to* a new voice-enabled unit. Create dynamically shaped acoustic zones, and *predict* user movement to proactively steer audio beams.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Multi-Microphone Array Integration:** Each voice-enabled device (VED) incorporates a dense, high-fidelity microphone array (minimum 32 microphones, spatial resolution < 5cm at 2m distance).
2.  **Real-Time Spatial Audio Mapping:** VEDs continuously perform real-time spatial audio mapping of the environment. This involves:
    *   Sound source localization (SSL) with sub-degree accuracy.
    *   Reverberation mapping to create a ‘sonic fingerprint’ of the space.
    *   Identification of stationary vs. moving sound sources.
3.  **User Device Tracking Enhancement:** The system utilizes a combination of techniques for robust user device tracking.
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beaconing from user devices.
    *   Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging for precise positioning.
    *   Audio-based tracking (using SSL on user's voice) as a fallback/supplement.
4.  **Predictive Beamforming Algorithm:** A core algorithm predicts user movement based on:
    *   Historical movement data (learning user's routines).
    *   Real-time movement tracking.
    *   Contextual awareness (time of day, location, calendar events).
    *   Velocity and acceleration analysis.
    *   Algorithm: Kalman filter-based prediction with adaptive noise covariance.
5.  **Dynamic Acoustic Zone Creation:** Based on predicted user location, the system dynamically creates and steers acoustic zones.
    *   Zones are shaped as ellipsoids, optimized for user's head position.
    *   Beamforming weights are adjusted in real-time to maximize signal-to-noise ratio within the zone.
    *   Zones can overlap to create seamless transitions between VEDs.
6.  **Inter-VED Communication Protocol:** VEDs communicate seamlessly via a low-latency protocol (e.g., Wi-Fi 6 Direct, custom UDP implementation).  Handover is transparent to the user. Protocol includes:
    *   Zone boundary data.
    *   Beamforming weights.
    *   Audio stream synchronization timestamps.
7.  **Adaptive Noise Cancellation:** The system leverages the spatial audio mapping to create highly effective adaptive noise cancellation.  Noise sources are identified and actively suppressed within the acoustic zone.
8.  **User Profile Integration:** System remembers user preferences:
    *   Preferred audio quality.
    *   Noise cancellation levels.
    *   Zone size and shape.
9.  **Pseudocode (Handover Logic):**

```
// On VED_A (current VED)
IF (predicted_user_location is closer to VED_B AND distance < handover_threshold) THEN
    // Calculate handover parameters (beamforming weights, audio timestamps)
    handover_params = calculate_handover_parameters(predicted_user_location, VED_B)
    // Send handover request to VED_B
    send_handover_request(VED_B, handover_params)
    // Fade out audio output
    fade_out_audio()
    // Notify computing device of handover
    notify_computing_device(VED_B)
ENDIF

// On VED_B (target VED)
ON_RECEIVE_HANDOVER_REQUEST(handover_params)
    // Apply handover parameters
    apply_handover_parameters(handover_params)
    // Fade in audio output
    fade_in_audio()
END
```

10. **Hardware Requirements:** High-performance DSPs for real-time signal processing.  Fast, reliable wireless communication.  Calibrated microphone arrays.

This system goes beyond simple switching by proactively anticipating user movement and steering audio beams, creating a seamless and immersive audio experience. The integration of predictive algorithms and spatial audio mapping creates an entirely new level of hands-free functionality.
