## Predictive Content Source Priming

**Concept:** Extend the feature score system to *proactively* prime content sources based on predicted user intent *before* a spoken request is fully articulated. This anticipates user needs and reduces latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Prediction Model:**

*   **Sensor Input:** Utilize a combination of sensor data *beyond* audio input. This includes:
    *   **Time of Day:** Correlate time with common content choices (e.g., news in the morning, music during commute).
    *   **Location Data (Optional/User Permitted):**  Infer activity (e.g., gym = workout playlist, home = relaxing music/podcast).
    *   **Calendar Integration (Optional/User Permitted):**  Predict content based on scheduled events (e.g., meeting prep audio, travel playlist).
    *   **Device Usage Patterns:** Track app usage, browser history (with appropriate privacy considerations) to establish broader content preferences.
*   **Intent Prediction Engine:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical user data (speech patterns, sensor data, content choices).  
    *   **Input:** Time series data from sensors & initial audio fragments.
    *   **Output:** Probability distribution over potential content entities (artist, track, genre, topic) & a “confidence score” for each prediction.
*   **Data Privacy:** All sensor data collection requires explicit user permission. Data must be anonymized/pseudonymized where possible and locally processed to minimize data transmission.

**2. Proactive Content Source Priming:**

*   **Priming Queue:**  Maintain a queue of “primed” content sources for each predicted intent. The queue size is limited to prevent resource exhaustion.
*   **Source Ranking:**  Rank potential content sources based on a weighted score:
    *   **Historical Preference (Weight: 50%):** User's past usage of the source for similar content.
    *   **Predicted Relevance (Weight: 30%):** How well the source matches the predicted content entity.
    *   **Network Latency (Weight: 10%):** Minimize access time.
    *   **Resource Availability (Weight: 10%):** Avoid overloading sources.
*   **Pre-fetching (Optional):**  For high-confidence predictions, initiate limited pre-fetching of likely content from the top-ranked sources. Caching locally to speed up delivery.

**3. Request Handling Modification:**

*   **Early Source Selection:** When the user begins speaking, the system *immediately* prioritizes sources from the primed queue.
*   **Confidence Threshold:**  Only use the primed sources if the confidence score of the prediction exceeds a certain threshold. If below, fall back to the original feature score system.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously refine the prediction model and weighting factors based on user interactions. Track whether primed sources were actually selected and whether the user was satisfied with the content.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// System Initialization
initialize PredictionModel()
initialize PrimingQueue()

// Continuous Loop (Sensor Data Processing)
while (true):
    sensorData = getSensorData()
    predictedIntent = PredictionModel.predictIntent(sensorData)
    populatePrimingQueue(predictedIntent)

// Request Handling
onReceiveAudioSignal():
    initialAudioFragment = getInitialAudioFragment()
    confidenceScore = PredictionModel.getConfidenceScore(initialAudioFragment)
    if (confidenceScore > confidenceThreshold):
        prioritizedSources = PrimingQueue.getPrioritizedSources()
        // Use prioritizedSources in content selection process
    else:
        // Fallback to original feature score system
```

**Innovation Rationale:** This moves beyond reactive content selection to *anticipatory* selection. It reduces perceived latency, provides a more seamless user experience, and allows for a more intelligent content delivery system. It's a significant refinement of the existing feature score approach.
