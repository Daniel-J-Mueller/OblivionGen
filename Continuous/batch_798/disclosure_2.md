## Dynamic Model Partitioning with Federated Learning Integration

**Concept:** Extend the secure model deployment strategy to incorporate federated learning principles, enabling continuous model refinement *at the edge* while maintaining data privacy and reducing bandwidth demands. The existing patent focuses on static partitioning – secure vs. unsecure portions – at deployment. This builds on that by *dynamically* adjusting the partitioning based on real-world performance and data characteristics *and* allowing edge devices to contribute to model updates without sharing raw data.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Hub Device:** Maintains a global model (initially deployed as described in the patent). Implements a secure execution environment (TPM/Secure Enclave). Includes a Federated Learning Aggregation Module. Monitors edge device performance metrics (latency, accuracy, resource usage).
*   **Edge Devices:** Execute unsecure model portions. Collect local data. Calculate gradients based on local data and unsecure model portions. Encrypt gradients using differential privacy techniques. Transmit encrypted gradients to the Hub.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Secure, authenticated communication channel between Hub and Edge devices. Utilizes a publish/subscribe model for gradient updates.

**2. Dynamic Partitioning Algorithm:**

*   **Performance Monitoring:** Hub collects performance data from edge devices (inference time, accuracy, resource usage).
*   **Partitioning Decision:** Based on collected data, the Hub determines if re-partitioning the model is beneficial. Criteria:
    *   **Latency Bottleneck:** If a particular layer in the unsecure portion consistently causes high latency, consider moving it to the secure portion.
    *   **Accuracy Improvement:** If a layer significantly impacts accuracy, moving it to the secure portion (allowing for more precise computation) may be beneficial.
    *   **Resource Constraints:** If an edge device struggles with a specific layer, offload it to the secure hub.
*   **Model Update:** The Hub initiates a model update. This involves:
    *   Generating a new model configuration reflecting the partitioning change.
    *   Sending the updated unsecure portions to the edge devices.
    *   Updating the secure portion and deploying it within the secure environment.

**3. Federated Learning Integration:**

*   **Local Training:** Edge devices perform local training on their data using the unsecure portions of the model.
*   **Gradient Calculation:** After training, each edge device calculates the gradient of the model's loss function.
*   **Gradient Encryption:** The gradients are encrypted using differential privacy techniques (e.g., adding noise) to protect sensitive data.
*   **Gradient Aggregation:** The Hub receives encrypted gradients from multiple edge devices. It aggregates these gradients using a secure aggregation protocol.
*   **Model Update:** The aggregated gradient is used to update the global model (within the secure environment).

**4. Secure Aggregation Protocol:**

*   **Homomorphic Encryption:** Utilizes homomorphic encryption to allow the Hub to perform computations on encrypted gradients without decrypting them.
*   **Secret Sharing:**  Splits the aggregated gradient into multiple shares and distributes them to different servers to prevent a single point of failure.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**  Edge devices provide zero-knowledge proofs to verify that their gradients are valid and haven't been tampered with.

**Pseudocode (Hub – Partitioning Decision):**

```
function determine_repartitioning(edge_performance_data):
  for layer in unsecure_layers:
    if layer.latency > latency_threshold:
      move_layer_to_secure_portion(layer)
    if layer.accuracy_impact > accuracy_threshold:
      move_layer_to_secure_portion(layer)
  return updated_model_configuration
```

**Pseudocode (Edge – Local Training & Gradient Upload):**

```
function local_training(unsecure_model_portion, local_data):
  // Perform training on local data
  calculated_gradients = calculate_gradients(local_data, unsecure_model_portion)
  encrypted_gradients = encrypt_gradients(calculated_gradients)
  upload_gradients(encrypted_gradients)
```

**Novelty:**  This design extends static model partitioning with dynamic adaptation based on real-time performance *and* integrates federated learning principles for continuous model refinement at the edge, enhancing privacy and reducing bandwidth requirements. The combination of these elements is not present in the original patent.
