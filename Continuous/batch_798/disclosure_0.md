## Dynamic Experiment State Injection via Ambient Computing

**Concept:** Leverage ambient computing principles – specifically, environmental sensors and contextual awareness – to *dynamically* adjust experiment states assigned to client devices *during* a session, based on real-world conditions. This goes beyond pre-assigned states and introduces a level of reactivity previously unavailable.

**Specification:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Client Device Integration:**  Existing client devices (phones, tablets, laptops) equipped with standard environmental sensors: microphone, accelerometer, gyroscope, ambient light sensor, proximity sensor, potentially barometer.
*   **Server-Side Context Engine:**  A server component responsible for processing sensor data and determining appropriate experiment state adjustments. This could be cloud-based.
*   **Low-Energy Broadcast System:** Utilizing Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons deployed in relevant environments (retail spaces, offices, public transit). These beacons transmit environment identifiers *and* real-time environmental data (temperature, humidity, noise level, light intensity).  This supplements client device sensor data.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Client-Side Agent:** A lightweight agent installed on client devices.
    *   Continuously collects sensor data.
    *   Scans for BLE beacon signals.
    *   Transmits aggregated sensor & beacon data to the Server-Side Context Engine.
    *   Receives updated experiment state assignments from the Context Engine.
    *   Implements the new experiment state (feature activation/deactivation, UI adjustments).
*   **Server-Side Context Engine:**
    *   Receives sensor & beacon data from client devices.
    *   Utilizes machine learning models to correlate environmental conditions with optimal experiment states. (Examples: louder environments may benefit from simplified UI; higher light levels may suggest prioritizing visual features; movement patterns indicating user is in transit could trigger a different feature set.)
    *   Dynamically assigns experiment states based on the ML model output.
    *   Implements a state injection mechanism to seamlessly update the experiment state on the client device during the session.
*   **Experiment Management System (Existing):** Integrates with the Context Engine to define experiment parameters and track results.

**III. Pseudocode – Server-Side Context Engine:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessClientData(clientID, sensorData, beaconData):
  // 1. Aggregate Data
  combinedData = Combine(sensorData, beaconData)

  // 2. Feature Extraction
  features = ExtractFeatures(combinedData) // (e.g., noiseLevel, lightIntensity, movementSpeed, proximityToObjects)

  // 3. Prediction
  predictedState = PredictExperimentState(features, MLModel)

  // 4. State Injection – Check if state is different than current.
  current_state = GetClientCurrentState(clientID)
  IF predictedState != current_state:
    InjectExperimentState(clientID, predictedState)
    LogStateChange(clientID, current_state, predictedState)

  RETURN predictedState
```

**IV. State Injection Mechanism:**

*   **Lightweight Messaging Protocol:**  Utilize a low-latency, bidirectional messaging protocol (e.g., WebSockets) for state injection.
*   **Incremental Updates:**  Send only the *differences* between the current and new experiment states to minimize bandwidth usage.
*   **Graceful Degradation:**  Implement fallback mechanisms in case of network connectivity issues or server unavailability.

**V. Example Use Case:**

Retail Environment: A client device detects that the user is near a product display (via BLE beacon). The server-side engine dynamically switches the experiment state to activate an augmented reality feature that provides product information and reviews. As the user moves away, the experiment state reverts to the original.

**VI. Refinement:**

*   **User Profiles:** Integrate user profile data (preferences, demographics) into the ML model to personalize experiment state assignments.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Continually A/B test different state injection strategies and ML models to optimize performance.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Implement robust privacy safeguards to protect user data and ensure transparency.
