## Automated Database Persona Generation & Dynamic Access Control

**Concept:** Extend self-service database administration with automated persona creation, tied to dynamic access control policies, informed by user activity and machine learning.

**Specification:**

**I. Persona Definition & Generation:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with existing identity management systems (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP) and application usage logs.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:** Employ machine learning algorithms (clustering, classification) to identify patterns in user database interactions. Key metrics:
    *   Frequency of queries
    *   Types of queries (read-only, write, administrative)
    *   Tables/schemas accessed
    *   Data sensitivity (based on schema metadata and/or data masking policies)
*   **Persona Types:** Define a set of pre-defined personas (e.g., "Data Analyst – Read Only," "Application Developer – Limited Write," "Report Generator – Specific Schema"). Allow administrators to create custom personas.
*   **Persona Assignment:**  Automatically suggest persona assignments based on behavioral analysis. Administrator approval required. Manual assignment also supported.
*   **Dynamic Persona Adjustment:** Continuously monitor user activity and automatically adjust persona assignments if behavior deviates significantly from the assigned persona profile.  Alert administrators for review.

**II. Dynamic Access Control Implementation:**

*   **Policy Engine:** Develop a rule-based policy engine that translates persona assignments into database access control rules (e.g., SQL view restrictions, row-level security, column masking).
*   **API Integration:** Extend the existing self-service API to allow administrators to define and manage personas and associated access control policies.
*   **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Implement support for row-level security, column masking, and dynamic data masking based on user persona and data sensitivity.
*   **Auditing & Reporting:** Track all access control decisions and provide detailed audit logs for compliance and security analysis. Generate reports on persona assignments, access patterns, and potential security violations.
*   **Workflow Integration:** Integrate with existing workflow systems to automate the process of requesting and approving access to sensitive data.

**III. System Components:**

*   **Persona Management Service:**  Responsible for persona creation, assignment, and monitoring.
*   **Policy Engine:** Translates personas into database access control rules.
*   **Database Access Control Interceptor:**  Intercepts all database queries and enforces access control policies. (Could be implemented as a database proxy or a middleware component).
*   **Data Usage Monitoring Service:** Collects data usage metrics and feeds them into the Persona Management Service for behavioral analysis.
*   **Reporting & Analytics Dashboard:** Provides a user interface for monitoring personas, access patterns, and security violations.

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function enforceAccessControl(user, query, databaseSchema) {
  persona = getPersona(user);
  accessRules = getAccessRules(persona, databaseSchema);

  if (accessRules == null) {
    denyAccess();
    return;
  }

  // Apply row-level security rules
  filteredQuery = applyRowLevelSecurity(query, accessRules.rowSecurityRules);

  // Apply column masking rules
  maskedQuery = applyColumnMasking(filteredQuery, accessRules.columnMaskingRules);

  // Execute the masked query
  result = executeQuery(maskedQuery);

  return result;
}
```

**Extending the Existing API:**

*   `/personas`:  CRUD operations for managing personas.
*   `/users/{userId}/persona`:  Assign/remove a persona from a user.
*   `/accessPolicies`: CRUD operations for access policies.
*   `/schemas/{schemaName}/policies`:  Retrieve/update access policies for a schema.
