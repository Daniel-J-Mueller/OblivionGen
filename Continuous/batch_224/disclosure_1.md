## Dynamic Workspace Illumination & Task Guidance

**Concept:** Integrate the wearable display system with dynamic workspace illumination, creating a 'guided workflow' where not just instructions are displayed *on* the optical element, but the *workspace itself* is subtly illuminated to highlight next steps and resource locations.

**Specs:**

*   **Illumination System:**  Array of micro-projectors & directed LED emitters integrated into workstation infrastructure (overhead, mounting arms). These are networked with the wearable computing device. Resolution of the projected light must be sufficient to clearly indicate areas/objects on the workstation.
*   **Wearable Integration:**  The wearable device's imaging system *not only* identifies items/resources but also *maps* the workstation geometry in 3D. This is a continuous process, updating as items are moved.
*   **Instruction Encoding:** Instructions are broken down into 'illumination directives' + display text.  Directives include:
    *   `HIGHLIGHT(resource_ID, color, intensity)`:  Illuminates a specific resource with a designated color & intensity.
    *   `PATH(start_point, end_point, color, animation_style)`: Projects a glowing line/arrow indicating a movement path (e.g. item to container).
    *   `AREA(coordinates, color, intensity)`: Highlights a specific area on the workstation surface (e.g. packing zone).
*   **Workflow Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION PrepareItem(item_ID):
    item_data = GET_ITEM_DATA(item_ID)
    shipping_requirement = item_data.shipping_requirement
    resource_list = DETERMINE_RESOURCES(shipping_requirement)
    
    FOR EACH instruction IN GENERATE_INSTRUCTIONS(resource_list):
        resource_ID = instruction.resource_ID
        action = instruction.action
        
        //Send Illumination Directive
        SEND_ILLUMINATION_DIRECTIVE(resource_ID, action.color, action.intensity)
        
        //Display Textual Instruction
        DISPLAY_INSTRUCTION(instruction.text)
        
        //Wait for Acknowledgment (user completes step)
        WAIT_FOR_ACKNOWLEDGEMENT()
    END FOR
END FUNCTION
```

*   **User Interaction:** Voice control and gesture recognition for acknowledging completion of steps.  Wearable device tracks hand/eye movements to refine illumination/display focus.
*   **Safety Features:**  Illumination intensity automatically adjusts based on ambient light levels.  Emergency stop button to disable all projected illumination.
*   **Advanced Feature: Predictive Illumination:** Based on worker performance data, the system *pre-illuminates* likely next steps/resources *before* the instruction is fully given, reducing reaction time.
