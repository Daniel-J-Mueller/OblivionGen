## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Consistency

**Concept:** Extend the isolated object storage approach by implementing dynamic data sharding based on access patterns *and* predictive consistency modeling. Instead of purely resolving incomplete transactions post-interruption, proactively shard data based on anticipated access, and pre-calculate consistency states.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Sharding Module:**

*   **Input:** Data object (file, directory, etc.), access logs, predictive model.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze access logs to identify frequently co-accessed data.
    *   Utilize a predictive model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained on access history to forecast future co-access patterns.
    *   Dynamically shard data objects based on predicted access patterns, distributing shards across multiple object data stores.
    *   Maintain a shard map indicating the location of each shard.
*   **Output:** Sharded data objects, shard map.

**2. Predictive Consistency Engine:**

*   **Input:** Shard map, transaction details, access logs.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor transactions and access patterns in real-time.
    *   Pre-calculate potential consistency states for each shard based on transaction details and access patterns.
    *   Store pre-calculated consistency states in a distributed cache.
    *   Use pre-calculated states to resolve consistency conflicts quickly, minimizing latency.
*   **Output:** Consistency state cache.

**3. Interruption Handling & Recovery:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Upon service interruption, the system enters a recovery mode.
    *   During recovery, the system utilizes the shard map to identify the location of each shard.
    *   The system leverages the consistency state cache to resolve any remaining incomplete transactions quickly.
    *   The system reconstructs data objects from shards.
*   **Output:** Restored data objects, resolved transactions.

**Pseudocode (Recovery Phase):**

```
function recover_data(data_object_id):
  shard_map = get_shard_map(data_object_id)
  incomplete_transactions = get_incomplete_transactions(data_object_id)

  for transaction in incomplete_transactions:
    consistency_state = get_consistency_state(transaction, shard_map)
    resolve_conflict(transaction, consistency_state) // Apply fix or roll back

  reconstruct_data(shard_map) // Assemble shards into full object

  return data_object
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Cache:** Redis or similar for fast consistency state access.
*   **Predictive Model:** TensorFlow, PyTorch or similar for training and deploying the access pattern prediction model.
*   **Object Data Stores:** Scalable object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).
*   **Inter-process Communication:** gRPC or similar for communication between modules.
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana for monitoring performance and health.
