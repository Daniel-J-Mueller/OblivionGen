## Multi-Modal Package Feedback System â€“ Integrating Haptics & AR

**System Overview:** Expand the existing visual feedback system by adding localized haptic feedback for the associate *and* augmented reality (AR) overlays projected onto the package itself. This creates a multi-sensory guidance system, drastically reducing cognitive load and improving stowage accuracy.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Existing System:** Retain the existing camera, computer vision system, and directional lighting array.
*   **Haptic Wristbands:** Lightweight wristbands worn by associates. These bands contain localized vibration motors capable of delivering distinct patterns.
*   **AR Projectors:** Miniature, low-power projectors integrated into the mounting plate above the container. These projectors are configured to project directly onto the surface of packages as they approach the container.
*   **Real-time Processing Unit:** Dedicated processor to manage AR projection and haptic feedback synchronization.

**Software & Logic:**

1.  **Package Identification & Destination:** The computer vision system continues to identify packages and determine their destinations as before.
2.  **Haptic Cue Generation:**
    *   *Correct Destination:* When a package is approaching the correct container, the wristband delivers a gentle, pulsating vibration pattern. The intensity of the vibration *increases* as the package gets closer to the correct location.
    *   *Incorrect Destination:* If a package is approaching the *wrong* container, the wristband emits a sharp, distinct vibration pattern.
    *   *Unreadable Barcode:* A slow, continuous vibration indicates a barcode issue.
3.  **AR Overlay Generation:**
    *   *Correct Destination:* A green outline or "halo" appears around the package as it nears the correct container. The halo brightens/expands as proximity increases.
    *   *Incorrect Destination:* A red outline appears around the package.  The outline *pulses* to draw attention.
    *   *Unreadable Barcode:* A question mark icon is projected onto the package surface, signaling a read error.
4.  **Synchronization:** The real-time processing unit ensures that the haptic feedback and AR overlays are perfectly synchronized. This is critical for minimizing confusion and maximizing usability.
5.  **Adaptive Feedback:** The system should *learn* associate behavior.  If an associate consistently ignores a particular color cue, the system can adjust the feedback (e.g., increase vibration intensity, change AR overlay color) to gain their attention.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Logic):**

```
// Variables
packageDestination = ComputerVision.GetDestination(packageID)
containerID = CurrentContainerID
distanceToContainer = Sensor.GetDistance(packageID, containerID)
vibrationIntensity = 0

// Logic
IF packageDestination == containerID THEN
  vibrationPattern = "pulsating"
  vibrationIntensity = Map(distanceToContainer, 0, maxDistance, 0, maxIntensity)
  HapticWristband.SetVibration(packageID, vibrationPattern, vibrationIntensity)
ELSE
  vibrationPattern = "sharp"
  HapticWristband.SetVibration(packageID, vibrationPattern, maxIntensity)
ENDIF

IF BarcodeUnreadable == TRUE THEN
  vibrationPattern = "continuous"
  HapticWristband.SetVibration(packageID, vibrationPattern, mediumIntensity)
ENDIF
```

**Calibration & Configuration:**

*   **Wristband Pairing:** Each wristband needs to be paired with the system.
*   **Projection Calibration:** The AR projectors need to be calibrated to ensure accurate projection onto the package surface.
*   **Associate Profiles:** Customizable profiles allow associates to adjust vibration intensity, AR overlay colors, and other preferences.
