## Dynamic Resource Allocation via Predictive Transaction Mapping

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Transaction Mapper (PTM) – a hardware/software co-processor integrated within each SoC.
*   **Memory:** Local PTM memory (SRAM) – 64KB per SoC. Global Transaction History Database (THDB) – distributed, scalable, SSD-backed (minimum 1TB capacity for a 100-SoC system).
*   **Interconnect:** Leverages existing interconnect infrastructure, but adds dedicated “prediction channels” – low-latency, prioritized communication paths.
*   **SoC Integration:** PTM integrates with existing address decoders (like the one described in the provided patent) *before* final routing decisions are made.

**Functional Description:**

The PTM aims to proactively allocate interconnect resources *before* transactions are fully decoded, based on predicted destination and criticality.

1.  **Transaction Interception:**  Upon initiating a transaction, the source node sends a "pre-amble" – a minimal packet containing transaction type, estimated data size, and initiating node ID – to the local PTM.

2.  **Prediction Engine:** The PTM's Prediction Engine operates in parallel with the address decoder. It employs a multi-layered approach:
    *   **Local History:**  Tracks recent transaction patterns *from this specific source node*. Uses a Bloom filter to quickly identify frequently accessed destinations.
    *   **Global History:** Queries the THDB to access transaction patterns across the *entire system*. This leverages data from all SoCs, identifying system-wide trends.  The THDB is updated asynchronously with completed transaction metadata.
    *   **Machine Learning Model:**  A lightweight neural network (trained offline and updated periodically) predicts the destination SoC and target node *based on* the pre-amble data and historical patterns.

3.  **Resource Reservation:**  Based on the prediction, the PTM attempts to reserve interconnect resources along the predicted path. This includes:
    *   **Prediction Channels:**  Attempts to secure a dedicated prediction channel for low-latency communication.
    *   **Bandwidth Allocation:**  Requests a specific bandwidth allocation from the interconnect controller.
    *   **Buffer Pre-Allocation:**  Requests pre-allocation of buffers in destination SoCs to avoid queuing delays.

4.  **Address Decoder Collaboration:** The PTM communicates its predictions to the address decoder. The address decoder *prioritizes* transactions with pre-allocated resources.  If the address decoder’s final routing matches the PTM’s prediction, the transaction proceeds with minimal delay.

5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   **Prediction Failure:** If the address decoder’s routing differs from the PTM’s prediction, the PTM releases the reserved resources and updates its models to reduce future errors.
    *   **Congestion Detection:** The PTM monitors interconnect congestion in real-time. It dynamically adjusts resource allocations to prioritize critical transactions and avoid bottlenecks.

**Pseudocode (PTM Core Loop):**

```
while (true) {
  preamble = receivePreamble();
  prediction = predictDestination(preamble);
  resourcesReserved = reserveResources(prediction);

  if (resourcesReserved) {
    sendPredictionToDecoder(prediction);
    decoderRouting = receiveDecoderRouting();

    if (decoderRouting == prediction) {
      // Transaction proceeds with pre-allocated resources
    } else {
      // Release resources and update prediction models
    }
  } else {
    // No resources available – transaction follows standard routing
  }
}
```

**Hardware/Software Partitioning:**
