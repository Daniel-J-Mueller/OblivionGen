## Adaptive Graph Partitioning for Dynamic Abuse Detection

**Concept:** Enhance abuse detection by dynamically partitioning the computational node graph based on evolving risk profiles, enabling focused analysis and more efficient resource allocation. The existing patent focuses on label propagation within a static graph. This builds on that by making the graph *itself* adaptive.

**Specifications:**

**1. Risk-Aware Partitioning Module:**

   *   **Input:** The computational node graph, initial risk scores for nodes (derived from the existing label propagation methods), a partitioning parameter 'k' (desired number of partitions).
   *   **Process:**
        1.  Employ a modularity-based graph partitioning algorithm (e.g., Louvain algorithm) modified to incorporate node risk scores as weights. Higher risk nodes will influence partition boundaries, encouraging their separation or clustering based on a configurable 'risk sensitivity' parameter.
        2.  Calculate a ‘risk density’ for each potential partition, representing the average risk score of nodes within it.
        3.  Iteratively refine partitions, attempting to minimize the within-partition risk variance and maximize the between-partition risk difference.  A cost function will balance partition size and risk separation.
   *   **Output:**  A set of dynamically generated partitions, each containing a subset of computational nodes and associated risk density metrics.

**2.  Localized Label Propagation & Anomaly Scoring:**

   *   **Input:**  Partitions from the Risk-Aware Partitioning Module, known abusive nodes, current risk scores.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  For each partition, perform independent label propagation using the existing graph-based label propagation algorithms. This allows for parallel processing and faster updates.
        2.  Calculate an 'anomaly score' for each node *within* a partition. This score combines the propagated risk score with a measure of deviation from the partition’s average risk profile (e.g., Z-score of the node’s risk score within the partition).
        3.  Implement a dynamic thresholding mechanism for the anomaly score, adjusting the threshold based on the overall risk density of the partition. Higher-risk partitions will have lower anomaly score thresholds.
   *   **Output:** Updated risk scores and anomaly scores for each node, along with partition-specific risk metrics.

**3.  Adaptive Graph Re-Partitioning Trigger:**

   *   **Input:**  Partition-specific risk metrics (average risk, risk variance, number of flagged nodes), a pre-defined re-partitioning threshold.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  Monitor the partition-specific risk metrics over time.
        2.  If any partition exceeds the re-partitioning threshold (e.g., a significant increase in average risk or the number of flagged nodes), trigger a re-partitioning of the entire graph.
        3.  The re-partitioning process will incorporate the latest risk scores and anomaly scores, ensuring that the graph remains responsive to evolving abuse patterns.
   *   **Output:**  Signal to initiate graph re-partitioning.

**Pseudocode (Re-Partitioning Trigger):**

```
function check_repartitioning(partitions, threshold):
  for partition in partitions:
    if partition.average_risk > threshold.risk_limit or partition.num_flagged_nodes > threshold.node_limit:
      print("Repartioning Graph")
      return True

  return False
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Partition:**  {nodes: [node_id], average_risk: float, risk_variance: float, num_flagged_nodes: int}
*   **Threshold:** {risk_limit: float, node_limit: int}

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Scalability:**  Partitioning enables parallel processing, improving scalability for large networks.
*   **Responsiveness:**  Dynamic re-partitioning allows the system to adapt to evolving abuse patterns in real-time.
*   **Accuracy:**  Localized label propagation and anomaly scoring improve the accuracy of abuse detection.
*   **Resource Efficiency:** Focused analysis on smaller partitions reduces computational overhead.
