**Dynamic Rack-Level Energy Harvesting & Redistribution**

**Core Concept:** Implement a system where each rack in the data center isn’t solely reliant on central power feeds, but actively harvests and redistributes energy *within* the rack itself, supplementing or even temporarily replacing primary power. This creates localized energy resilience and optimizes power usage.

**Specifications:**

*   **Rack Integration:** Each rack will house a network of micro-turbines (piezoelectric or similar kinetic energy capture) mounted on the rear doors and potentially integrated into heatsink fins of high-power components. These turbines capture airflow from the cooling system. Additionally, thermoelectric generators (TEGs) will be mounted on the backs of high-power components (CPUs, GPUs, memory) to capture waste heat.

*   **Energy Storage:** Each rack will contain a bank of high-density, solid-state capacitors (or emerging battery tech like zinc-air) capable of storing harvested energy. Capacity will be dynamically scalable based on rack density and power demands, targeting at least 10-15 minutes of full load runtime based on the rack's average draw.

*   **Intelligent Power Controller (IPC):** A rack-mounted IPC will manage energy harvesting, storage, and distribution. It will monitor power draw from each component, dynamically route harvested energy to reduce reliance on primary power, and manage capacitor charging/discharging.

*   **Component-Level Power Regulation:** The IPC will interface with power supplies in individual servers/components to intelligently regulate voltage and current based on available harvested energy. This allows prioritization of critical components during a power event.

*   **Rack-to-Rack Communication:** Racks will communicate via a low-latency network (e.g., using existing data center networking infrastructure) to share energy surpluses/deficits.  A rack with excess energy can temporarily supply power to a neighboring rack facing a shortfall, creating a localized ‘microgrid’.

*   **Predictive Load Balancing:** The IPC will employ machine learning algorithms to predict future power demands based on historical data, workload patterns, and real-time monitoring. This allows proactive energy harvesting and storage optimization.

*   **Failure Mode Handling:** In the event of a primary power failure, the IPC will seamlessly switch to harvested energy, prioritizing critical components. If harvested energy is insufficient, the IPC will orchestrate controlled component shutdown to prevent overload.

**Pseudocode (IPC Logic):**

```
// Variables
RackPowerDemand = 0
HarvestedEnergy = 0
StoredEnergy = 0
CriticalComponentList = [] // List of vital servers/components
PriorityLevel = {Server1: High, Server2: Medium, Server3: Low}

// Main Loop
While (True):

    // Monitor Power Demand
    RackPowerDemand = CalculateRackPowerDemand()

    // Harvest Energy
    HarvestedEnergy = CollectEnergyFromTurbinesAndTEGs()
    StoredEnergy = StoredEnergy + HarvestedEnergy

    // Calculate Power Deficit/Surplus
    PowerDeficit = RackPowerDemand - StoredEnergy

    If (PowerDeficit > 0):
        // Prioritize Components
        SortComponentsByPriority(PriorityLevel)

        // Reduce Power to Lower Priority Components
        ReducePowerToNonCriticalComponents(PowerDeficit)

        If (PowerDeficit > 0):
            // Request Energy from Neighboring Racks
            RequestEnergyFromNeighbors(PowerDeficit)

    If (HarvestedEnergy > 0):
        DistributeHarvestedEnergy(HarvestedEnergy) //Feed back into power supply
    End

End
```
