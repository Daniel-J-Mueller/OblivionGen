**Dynamic Wardrobe Generation via Generative AI & Environmental Context**

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:**
    *   User Profile: Stores user preferences (styles, colors, brands, fit), wardrobe inventory (images, descriptions, metadata), social media linkages (optional, for style trend analysis).
    *   Environmental Data: Real-time access to weather data (temperature, precipitation, wind speed), location data (GPS or IP-based), calendar events (user-defined).
    *   Trend Data: API access to fashion trend databases, social media fashion influencers, e-commerce sales data.

2.  **AI Core – Generative Wardrobe Module:**
    *   Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture – specifically a StyleGAN variant optimized for clothing/accessory generation. Trained on a massive dataset of fashion imagery.
    *   Input Parameters: User profile, environmental data (temperature, precipitation probability, wind speed), calendar event type (e.g., "business meeting", "casual brunch", "formal gala"), and specified ‘vibe’ (e.g., “minimalist”, “bohemian”, “streetwear”).
    *   Output: Generates a set of complete outfit proposals (including clothing, shoes, accessories) rendered as realistic images or 3D models. Output includes metadata for each item (style, color, material, estimated cost).
    *   Outfit Variation: Algorithm to introduce subtle variations in generated outfits (e.g., different scarf patterns, shoe styles) to provide a range of options.

3.  **Wardrobe Integration & Virtual Try-On:**
    *   Existing Wardrobe Matching: System analyzes generated outfit proposals and identifies items the user already owns. Highlights these items in the generated outfit.
    *   Virtual Try-On: Uses augmented reality (AR) to allow the user to “try on” generated outfits using their smartphone or tablet camera. Enables realistic visualization of clothing on the user's body.
    *   Purchase Integration: Seamless integration with e-commerce platforms allows the user to purchase missing items directly from the app.

4.  **Contextual Adaptation Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    function generateOutfit(userProfile, environmentalData, calendarEvent, vibe) {
      // 1. Determine base outfit based on vibe and event type
      baseOutfit = selectBaseOutfit(vibe, eventType)

      // 2. Adjust outfit for weather conditions
      if (environmentalData.temperature < 10) { // Celsius
        addLayer(baseOutfit, "heavy coat")
        addAccessory(baseOutfit, "warm scarf")
      } else if (environmentalData.precipitationProbability > 0.5) {
        addLayer(baseOutfit, "waterproof jacket")
        addAccessory(baseOutfit, "umbrella")
      }

      // 3. Adapt to activity/location (Calendar Event)
      if (calendarEvent.type == "business meeting") {
        adjustFormality(baseOutfit, "formal")
      } else if (calendarEvent.location.type == "outdoor") {
        adjustComfort(baseOutfit, "comfortable")
      }

      // 4. Generate variations using GAN
      variations = generateVariations(baseOutfit, GAN)

      // 5. Rank variations based on user preferences and contextual relevance
      rankedVariations = rankVariations(variations, userProfile, environmentalData, calendarEvent)

      return rankedVariations
    }
    ```

5.  **User Interface (UI):**
    *   Visually appealing and intuitive interface.
    *   Outfit browsing and filtering options.
    *   Interactive AR try-on experience.
    *   Personalized recommendations and styling tips.
    *   Social sharing features.

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple color palette recommendations. It utilizes generative AI to *design* outfits dynamically, adapting to a wide range of contextual factors in real-time. The integration of environmental data and calendar events creates a truly personalized styling experience. The AR try-on feature enhances user engagement and facilitates purchase decisions. The system *creates* instead of simply suggests.
