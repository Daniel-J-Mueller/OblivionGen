**Dynamic Highlight Contextualization & 'Echo' System**

**Concept:** Extend the ‘shared highlighting’ concept to build a dynamic, contextual information layer *around* highlighted sections, creating a shared ‘echo’ of understanding that evolves with user interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** Each highlight isn’t just a text span, but a node in a directed graph. Nodes contain:
    *   Highlighted Text Span
    *   User ID of Highlighter
    *   Timestamp
    *   ‘Echo’ Data (see below)
    *   Link to Source Material (e.g., book chapter, article section)
*   **‘Echo’ Data:** This is where the innovation lies. Each highlight can accumulate:
    *   **User Tags:**  Users can add free-form tags to highlights (e.g., “key argument,” “historical context,” “unreliable narrator”).
    *   **Linked Highlights:** Users can *link* their highlights to other highlights within the same document or across different documents.  This creates explicit connections between ideas.
    *   **External Links:** Users can add links to external resources relevant to the highlighted section (e.g., Wikipedia articles, news reports, academic papers).
    *   **Short-Form Commentary:**  A limited-character text field for brief explanations or questions.
    *   **AI-Generated Summaries/Explanations:** (Future enhancement)  An integrated AI could generate short summaries of the highlighted section or provide alternative explanations.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   **Highlight Density Map:** A visual overlay on the text showing the density of highlights.  Areas with high density indicate sections of particular interest to the community.
    *   **‘Echo’ Bubble:**  Clicking on a highlighted section reveals a bubble displaying the ‘Echo’ data: tags, linked highlights, external links, commentary.
    *   **Graph View:**  A dedicated view displaying the network of linked highlights as a graph.  Users can explore connections between ideas and discover new perspectives.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:**  The ‘Echo’ data isn’t static.  A weighting algorithm prioritizes information based on:
    *   **User Reputation:** Highlights from users with a high reputation (based on contributions, ratings, etc.) are given more weight.
    *   **Tag Frequency:** Tags that are frequently used by multiple users indicate important themes.
    *   **Link Strength:** Links between highlights that are frequently traversed indicate strong connections.
*   **Algorithm (Simplified):**
    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_highlight_weight(highlight_node) {
        weight = 0;
        weight += user_reputation(highlight_node.user_id) * 0.4;
        for (tag in highlight_node.tags) {
            weight += tag_frequency(tag) * 0.2;
        }
        for (linked_highlight in highlight_node.linked_highlights) {
            weight += link_strength(linked_highlight) * 0.1;
        }
        return weight;
    }

    function sort_highlights_by_weight(highlight_list) {
        return highlight_list.sort(function(a, b) {
            return calculate_highlight_weight(b) - calculate_highlight_weight(a);
        });
    }
    ```

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/highlights/{document_id}`: Retrieve all highlights for a document.
    *   `/highlight/{highlight_id}`: Retrieve a specific highlight.
    *   `/highlight/{highlight_id}/tags`: Add/remove tags from a highlight.
    *   `/highlight/{highlight_id}/links`: Add/remove links to other highlights.
    *   `/search/highlights`: Search for highlights based on keywords, tags, or users.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Collaborative Learning:** Students can collaboratively annotate and discuss texts.
*   **Research:** Researchers can share and synthesize information from multiple sources.
*   **Knowledge Management:** Organizations can build a shared knowledge base of annotated documents.
*   **Enhanced Reading Experience:** Readers can discover new perspectives and deepen their understanding of texts.
