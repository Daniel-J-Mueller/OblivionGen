## Dynamic Rack Power Allocation & Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Enhance data center power resilience and efficiency by implementing a system that dynamically allocates power *within* racks, not just *to* racks, and proactively balances load based on predictive modeling of individual component power draw. This goes beyond simply switching to reserve power; it aims to *avoid* overloads in the first place by intelligently redistributing power at the rack level.

**Specs:**

*   **Rack Power Distribution Unit (R-PDU):** A modular, digitally controlled PDU installed *within* each rack. This is *not* the primary PDU described in the patent, but a secondary unit for fine-grained control. It features:
    *   Individual outlet monitoring (voltage, current, power).
    *   Digitally controlled circuit breakers for each outlet (solid-state switching preferred).
    *   Communication interface (Ethernet/IP, Modbus TCP) for centralized control.
    *   Local processing capability (microcontroller) for basic autonomous operation during network outages.
*   **Power Allocation Controller (PAC):** A centralized server responsible for:
    *   Real-time monitoring of all R-PDUs.
    *   Predictive load modeling based on historical data and current workload information. This leverages machine learning algorithms to forecast power consumption of individual servers and components.
    *   Dynamic power allocation algorithms to optimize power distribution within racks.
    *   Overload prevention strategies: Proactively shedding low-priority loads or migrating workloads to different racks *before* exceeding power limits.
*   **Workload Management Integration:** The PAC integrates with existing workload management systems (e.g., Kubernetes, VMware vCenter) to facilitate workload migration and dynamic resource allocation.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**  A software component that utilizes time-series analysis and machine learning (e.g., LSTM networks, Random Forests) to forecast power consumption based on historical data, current workload, and environmental factors (temperature, humidity).
*   **Priority Tiering:** A system for categorizing workloads and servers based on their importance. This enables the PAC to prioritize critical workloads during overload situations.
*   **Automated Circuit Breaker Control:** Software routines to dynamically switch the current limit on circuit breakers.

**Pseudocode (PAC - Power Allocation Algorithm):**

```
function allocatePower(rackData):
  // rackData contains data from R-PDU: current draw per outlet, server status, workload information
  predictedRackLoad = predictRackLoad(rackData) // Use Predictive Modeling Engine
  currentRackLoad = calculateCurrentRackLoad(rackData)

  if predictedRackLoad > rackCapacity:
    //Overload imminent
    sortServersByPriority(rackData) // Based on configured priority tiers
    for server in sortedServers:
      if server.priority == "low" and server.workloadMigratable:
        migrateWorkload(server) // Move to a different rack
        if predictedRackLoad < rackCapacity:
          break
      elif server.priority == "low" and not server.workloadMigratable:
        shutdownServer(server)
        if predictedRackLoad < rackCapacity:
          break
  //Fine tuning
  for outlet in rackData.outlets:
    if outlet.current > outlet.threshold:
      adjustPowerLimit(outlet, newLimit)
```

**Innovation Details:**

This system differs from the provided patent by focusing on *intra*-rack power management. The patent deals with switching between primary and reserve power sources. This design aims to *optimize* power usage and *prevent* overloads within the rack itself, reducing the need to switch to reserve power in the first place. The predictive modeling and workload management integration create a proactive system that adapts to changing conditions. This is more than an 'automatic transfer switch'; it's a dynamic power allocation engine. Further, utilizing machine learning to predict draw enhances the adaptive features of the system as well.
