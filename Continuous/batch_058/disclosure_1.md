## Dynamic Feature Weighting for Scene Understanding

**Concept:** Extend the probabilistic matching system to incorporate dynamic weighting of features based on environmental context and object relationships. This moves beyond purely local descriptor matching to a more holistic scene understanding approach.

**Specs:**

**1. Environmental Context Module:**

*   **Sensor Input:**  RGB-D camera or similar depth-sensing device.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Segment the scene into regions (e.g., using semantic segmentation).
    *   For each region, determine contextual properties:
        *   Illumination level (low/medium/high).
        *   Surface Material (reflective/diffuse/transparent - estimated from RGB-D).
        *   Occlusion level (percentage of area obscured).
    *   Create a context vector representing these properties for each region.

**2. Relationship Mapping Module:**

*   **Input:**  Detected features (using SIFT or similar), segmented regions.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Establish spatial relationships between features within and across regions (e.g., adjacency, containment, overlap).
    *   Infer object relationships (e.g., "cup on table", "person holding phone").  This could utilize a knowledge base or learned models.
    *   Create a relationship graph representing these connections.

**3. Dynamic Feature Weighting:**

*   **Input:** Local descriptor values, context vectors, relationship graph.
*   **Processing:**
    *   For each feature, calculate a weight based on:
        *   **Contextual Relevance:**  How well the feature aligns with the context of its region.  (e.g., features emphasizing edges may be more important in low-illumination scenarios).  Use a learned model (neural network) to determine this based on context vector inputs.
        *   **Relational Strength:**  How strongly the feature is connected to other features in the relationship graph. Features central to many relationships receive higher weight.  Calculate using graph centrality metrics.
        *   **Descriptor Confidence:** Traditional SIFT score or other descriptor quality measure.
    *   Scale the local descriptor value by the calculated weight *before* probability calculation.

**4. Probability Calculation & Ranking:**

*   Use the weighted local descriptor values in the existing probability calculation framework.
*   Rank distributions based on these weighted probabilities.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Weighting):**

```
function calculate_feature_weight(feature, context, relationship_graph):
  context_weight = neural_network(context) // Learned model
  relationship_weight = graph_centrality(feature, relationship_graph)
  descriptor_confidence = feature.sift_score

  weight = context_weight * relationship_weight * descriptor_confidence

  return weight

//Within the probability calculation:
weighted_descriptor = descriptor * calculate_feature_weight(descriptor, context_vector, relationship_graph)
probability = calculate_probability(weighted_descriptor, distribution_data)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   RGB-D camera or similar.
*   High-performance computing platform (GPU recommended).
*   Deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Graph database or library (Neo4j, NetworkX).
