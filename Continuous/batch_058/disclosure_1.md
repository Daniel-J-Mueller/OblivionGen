## Dynamic Acoustic Environment Synthesis for Personalized ASR

**Concept:** Augment the ASR pipeline with real-time synthesis of acoustic environments to drastically improve performance in noisy or reverberant conditions, specifically tailored to the *user's* typical acoustic surroundings. This goes beyond simple noise cancellation or beamforming – it aims to *recreate* the user’s listening environment digitally.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Acoustic Profile Creation:**
    *   **Data Acquisition:** Continuously (or periodically) capture ambient audio from the user’s device microphone(s).
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant acoustic features:
        *   Reverberation Time (RT60) estimation
        *   Noise Floor calculation
        *   Dominant Frequency analysis
        *   Spatial audio characteristics (using multiple microphones, if available)
        *   Classification of acoustic environment type (e.g., 'home office', 'car interior', 'busy street') using a pre-trained classifier.
    *   **Profile Storage:**  Store the acoustic profile as a weighted combination of acoustic parameters. Profiles are associated with user ID and optionally with context (time of day, location via GPS, calendar events).
*   **Module 2: Real-time Environment Synthesis:**
    *   **Profile Retrieval:** Upon receiving audio data from the user, retrieve the most relevant acoustic profile.
    *   **Synthesis Engine:** Employ a digital signal processing (DSP) engine to synthesize the target acoustic environment. Techniques include:
        *   **Convolution Reverb:** Convolve the input audio with impulse responses (IRs) generated or selected based on the retrieved profile.  A database of pre-recorded IRs representing common environments is maintained.
        *   **Parametric Reverberation:** Model the reverberation characteristics using parametric models (e.g., Schroeder reverberator) adjusted based on the profile.
        *   **Noise Injection:** Add realistic noise samples (from a database or generated procedurally) with characteristics matching the profile.  Noise types should include speech babble, environmental sounds, and machine noise.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:** Apply adaptive filtering to fine-tune the synthesized environment based on real-time analysis of the input audio and the user’s immediate surroundings (using microphone data).
*   **Module 3: ASR Integration:**
    *   **Pre-processing:** Apply the synthesized acoustic environment to the incoming audio signal *before* feeding it to the ASR engine.
    *   **ASR Engine:** Leverage a standard ASR engine, optimized for clean speech, but operating on the processed audio.
    *   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor ASR performance (e.g., word error rate) and adjust the environment synthesis parameters to minimize errors. Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize the synthesis process over time.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Standard microphone array on client device. Cloud or edge-based processing resources for the synthesis engine and reinforcement learning.
*   **Pseudocode (Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesizeEnvironment(audioInput, acousticProfile):
  // Load parameters from acousticProfile (RT60, noiseFloor, IR, etc.)

  // Generate impulse response based on RT60, IR, and audio characteristics
  impulseResponse = generateIR(acousticProfile)

  // Convolve audioInput with impulseResponse
  reverberatedAudio = convolve(audioInput, impulseResponse)

  // Generate noise based on noiseFloor and acousticProfile
  noise = generateNoise(noiseFloor, acousticProfile)

  // Add noise to reverberatedAudio
  synthesizedAudio = reverberatedAudio + noise

  return synthesizedAudio
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply *removing* noise or *correcting* for reverberation. It actively *recreates* the user's typical acoustic surroundings, allowing the ASR engine to operate in a more familiar and predictable environment. This adaptation could lead to a significant reduction in word error rate, especially in challenging acoustic conditions.
