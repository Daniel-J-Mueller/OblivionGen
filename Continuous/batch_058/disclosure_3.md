## Contextual Data Masking with Dynamic Granularity

**Specification:** A system to dynamically mask personal information based on requestor context *and* data sensitivity levels, going beyond simple authorization.

**Core Concept:** Instead of just granting or denying access, the system will redact or obfuscate portions of personal information based on a tiered sensitivity profile linked to each data field *and* the verified context of the requestor. This allows for controlled data sharing where only *necessary* information is revealed.

**Components:**

*   **Data Sensitivity Profiles:**  A metadata layer attached to each personal data field.  Profiles define:
    *   **Sensitivity Level:** (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Restricted).
    *   **Masking Rules:**  Specific instructions on how to transform the data based on requestor context.  Examples:
        *   Replace digits with '*' characters.
        *   Truncate portions of a string (e.g., street address, but keep city/state).
        *   Replace with a generalized value (e.g., age range instead of exact age).
        *   Statistical aggregation (e.g. provide average spending instead of individual transactions).
*   **Request Context Verification Module:** Extends the existing system to not only verify identity and basic authorization but also to evaluate the *purpose* of the request. This might involve analyzing the requesting application, the userâ€™s role within that application, and a pre-defined policy governing access for that purpose.
*   **Dynamic Masking Engine:**  Responsible for applying the masking rules defined in the Data Sensitivity Profiles based on the verified Request Context.
*   **Auditing & Logging:**  Detailed logs recording *what* information was accessed, *how* it was masked, *who* requested it, and the *purpose* of the request.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Masking Engine):**

```
function maskData(personalData, requestContext, dataSensitivityProfiles):
  maskedData = {}
  for each field in personalData:
    if field in dataSensitivityProfiles:
      sensitivityProfile = dataSensitivityProfiles[field]
      sensitivityLevel = sensitivityProfile.level
      maskingRule = sensitivityProfile.rules[requestContext.purpose] // Access rule based on request purpose

      if maskingRule == "REPLACE_DIGITS":
        maskedData[field] = replaceDigits(personalData[field])
      elif maskingRule == "TRUNCATE_ADDRESS":
        maskedData[field] = truncateAddress(personalData[field])
      elif maskingRule == "GENERALIZE_AGE":
        maskedData[field] = generalizeAge(personalData[field])
      else:
        maskedData[field] = personalData[field] // No masking applied

    else:
      maskedData[field] = personalData[field] // No sensitivity profile defined

  return maskedData
```

**Integration with Existing System:**

The system would sit *between* the data storage and the requesting service. When a request for personal information is received:

1.  The Request Context Verification Module validates the request.
2.  The Dynamic Masking Engine retrieves the relevant Data Sensitivity Profiles.
3.  The Engine applies the masking rules to the requested data.
4.  The masked data is returned to the requesting service.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Privacy:** Minimizes data exposure.
*   **Granular Control:** Allows for fine-tuned data sharing.
*   **Compliance:** Supports data privacy regulations.
*   **Flexibility:** Adapts to changing data privacy requirements.
*   **Reduced Risk:** Mitigates the impact of data breaches.
