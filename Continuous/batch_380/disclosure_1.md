## Dynamic Catalog Cohesion via Generative Product Relationships

**Concept:** Extend the accuracy estimation beyond classifications to *catalog cohesion*. The current patent focuses on verifying if products are *correctly* categorized. This expands to assess if the *relationships between* product groupings make sense for the user experience. Leverage generative AI to *propose* relationships, and utilize user interaction data to refine these proposed relationships and update the catalog structure.

**Specifications:**

**1. Relationship Graph Generation:**

*   **Input:** Electronic catalog data (product titles, descriptions, images, existing groupings, transaction history).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a large language model (LLM) – PaLM 2 or similar – to analyze product data.
    *   Generate a “relationship graph” where nodes represent product groupings, and edges represent the *likelihood* of a user needing/browsing both groupings in the same session.  Weight edges based on:
        *   **Semantic Similarity:** LLM determines similarity of products within each grouping.
        *   **Co-Purchase Data:** Historical transaction data identifies frequently co-purchased items.
        *   **Browsing Patterns:** Website analytics reveal groupings frequently visited in the same session.
        *   **Generative ‘Need’ Mapping:** The LLM *predicts* if a user needing items in grouping A might *also* need items in grouping B (e.g., “Someone buying a camping tent might also need a portable power station”).
*   **Output:** Weighted relationship graph.

**2. Cohesion Score Calculation:**

*   **Input:** Weighted relationship graph, actual user session data (browsing history, purchases).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each user session, traverse the relationship graph based on the groupings visited.
    *   Calculate a “cohesion score” based on the *strength* of the edges traversed.  High cohesion indicates a natural user flow; low cohesion suggests disjointed catalog structure.
    *   Use a scoring system such as:
        *   `Cohesion Score = Σ (Edge Weight) /  Total Number of Groupings Visited`
*   **Output:**  Cohesion Score for each user session, and an average cohesion score for the entire catalog.

**3. Dynamic Catalog Restructuring:**

*   **Input:** Average Cohesion Score, User Session Data, Relationship Graph.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Low Cohesion Triggers:** If average cohesion falls below a threshold, initiate restructuring.
    *   **AI-Proposed Restructuring:**
        *   Utilize the relationship graph to identify candidate groupings for merging or splitting.
        *   The LLM *generates* descriptions of the new/modified groupings, *justifying* the change based on user needs.
        *   The system presents the proposed changes (with justification) to catalog managers for review.
    *   **A/B Testing:** Implement A/B testing of proposed catalog changes to assess impact on key metrics (conversion rate, average order value, bounce rate).
*   **Output:** Updated catalog structure.

**4. Feedback Loop & Model Retraining:**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously collect user interaction data (browsing, purchases, search queries).
*   **Model Retraining:** Regularly retrain the LLM and relationship graph generation models using the collected data.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Adjust cohesion score thresholds based on seasonal trends and catalog changes.



**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Function: generate_relationship_graph(catalog_data)
#   Input: catalog_data (product groupings, descriptions, etc.)
#   Output: weighted_graph (nodes = groupings, edges = relationship strength)
#   Uses LLM to analyze data and predict relationships
def generate_relationship_graph(catalog_data):
  #... LLM analysis and graph creation ...
  return weighted_graph

# Function: calculate_cohesion_score(session_data, weighted_graph)
#   Input: session_data (user's browsing path), weighted_graph
#   Output: cohesion_score (0-1)
def calculate_cohesion_score(session_data, weighted_graph):
  #... Traverse graph, sum edge weights, normalize ...
  return cohesion_score

# Main Loop
while True:
  for session in user_sessions:
    weighted_graph = generate_relationship_graph(catalog_data)
    cohesion_score = calculate_cohesion_score(session, weighted_graph)
    if cohesion_score < threshold:
      propose_restructuring(catalog_data, weighted_graph)
  retrain_models(user_data)
