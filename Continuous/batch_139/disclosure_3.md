## Temporal Webpage Snapshots with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the ‘consistent link sharing’ concept by not just storing *a* version of a webpage, but creating a series of temporally ordered snapshots, *and* employing predictive prefetching based on user behavior and webpage volatility. This allows a user to not just access a stored version, but to *rewind* to previous states of a webpage, and experience the page as it existed at a specific point in time.

**Specs:**

**1. Snapshotting Service:**

*   **Triggering:** Snapshots are triggered by:
    *   User explicit request (“Save State”)
    *   Time-based interval (configurable per URL/domain)
    *   Change detection (via hashing or semantic analysis of page content – see Section 3)
*   **Data Storage:**  Each snapshot stores:
    *   Full HTML source code.
    *   All associated assets (CSS, Javascript, images) – either embedded or referenced with unique identifiers.
    *   Timestamp of snapshot creation.
    *   Metadata: User ID (if applicable), triggering event (user request, time interval, change detection).
*   **Versioning:** Implement a robust versioning system (e.g., Git-like) to efficiently store and retrieve snapshots.  Delta compression should be used to minimize storage space.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/snapshot/create`: Trigger a snapshot of a given URL.
    *   `/snapshot/get/{url}/{timestamp}`: Retrieve the webpage as it existed at a specific timestamp.
    *   `/snapshot/list/{url}`: List available snapshots for a given URL.

**2. Predictive Prefetching Engine:**

*   **User Behavior Tracking:** Monitor user interactions with stored webpages:
    *   Frequency of accessing different snapshots.
    *   Typical ‘rewind’ patterns (e.g., frequently jumping back to the previous day's version).
    *   Time spent viewing each snapshot.
*   **Webpage Volatility Analysis:**  Determine how frequently a webpage’s content changes.
    *   Monitor content hashes.
    *   Analyze update frequency from external sources (e.g., RSS feeds, website change monitoring services).
*   **Prediction Algorithm:**  Employ a machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network) to predict the likelihood of a user accessing a specific snapshot in the near future.  Factors to consider:
    *   User’s historical behavior.
    *   Webpage volatility.
    *   Time since last access.
*   **Prefetching Mechanism:**  Automatically download and cache snapshots that are predicted to be accessed soon.

**3. Change Detection Module:**

*   **Hashing:** Calculate cryptographic hashes of the webpage’s HTML and assets.
*   **Semantic Analysis:** Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to identify significant content changes.  Focus on changes to the main content areas, ignoring minor cosmetic updates.
*   **Thresholding:** Define a threshold for content change.  If the detected change exceeds the threshold, trigger a new snapshot.

**4. User Interface Integration:**

*   **Timeline Visualization:** Display a timeline of available snapshots for each webpage.
*   **Playback Controls:** Allow users to navigate through the timeline and view snapshots at specific points in time.
*   **Snapshot Management:** Allow users to delete or mark snapshots as favorites.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Allow users to disable tracking or delete their historical data.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Prefetching Engine:**

```
function predict_next_snapshot(user_id, url):
  history = get_user_history(user_id, url)  // Get user's viewing history for this URL
  volatility = get_webpage_volatility(url) // Get webpage's change frequency
  current_time = get_current_time()

  //  Use a trained ML model to predict the probability of accessing each snapshot
  probabilities = ml_model.predict(history, volatility, current_time)

  // Sort snapshots by probability
  sorted_snapshots = sort_snapshots_by_probability(probabilities)

  // Return the top N snapshots to prefetch
  return sorted_snapshots[:N]
```
