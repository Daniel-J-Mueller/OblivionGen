**Adaptive Haptic Contextual Menu**

**Concept:** Expand the contextual menu concept beyond visual display to incorporate dynamic haptic feedback, creating a spatially aware and tactile interface. This goes beyond simple vibration; it allows the user to ‘feel’ the menu options and interact with them without looking, enhancing accessibility and efficiency.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution haptic actuator array integrated into the bezel of the device (smartphone, tablet, wearable). Array density: minimum 100 actuators/inch².
    *   Ultrasonic transducers to create localized air pressure variations for enhanced haptic sensations.
    *   Proximity sensors to detect user finger position relative to the bezel.
    *   Miniaturized gyroscope and accelerometer for orientation awareness.
*   **Software:**
    *   Context Engine: Identifies user context (location, time, activity, application usage, messaging content – as in the source patent).
    *   Haptic Mapping Module: Translates contextual data into a 3D haptic map.  Higher relevance applications/actions have more prominent/textured haptic 'nodes'.
    *   Gesture Recognition:  Detects swipe/edge-touch gestures to navigate the haptic menu.
    *   Dynamic Haptic Rendering:  Renders haptic feedback in real-time based on gesture input and application state.
    *   User Profile Manager: Allows users to customize haptic feedback intensity, texture, and node arrangement.
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  Upon detecting a designated edge-swipe gesture, the Context Engine activates the Haptic Mapping Module.
    2.  The module generates a 3D haptic map representing relevant applications/actions, ‘projected’ onto the bezel near the swipe initiation point.
    3.  The user can ‘feel’ the raised/textured haptic nodes representing each option. Node prominence scales with application relevance score.
    4.  Swiping *along* the bezel navigates the haptic menu. Haptic nodes 'snap' into focus as the user’s finger passes over them, providing tactile feedback.
    5.  A short ‘press’ (applying pressure to a selected node) launches the associated application or executes the action.
    6.  The system learns user preferences over time, dynamically adjusting the haptic map layout and node prominence.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Map Generation):**

```
function generateHapticMap(contextData, relevanceScores):
  // contextData: Location, Time, Activity, Messaging Content
  // relevanceScores: Dictionary of App/Action : Score

  hapticMap = new Array()
  nodeSpacing = 10 // pixels

  for (app, score in relevanceScores):
    nodeSize = score * 5 + 5 // Scale size with relevance

    x = app.id * nodeSpacing
    y = contextData.timeOfDay * 2 + 5 // Slight vertical offset based on time
    z = score * 1 // Z-axis indicates prominence

    hapticMap.append(Node(x, y, z, app, nodeSize))

  return hapticMap
```

**Further Development:**

*   **Multi-Layered Haptics:** Utilize multiple haptic actuators to create more complex textures and sensations.
*   **Adaptive Resistance:** Vary the resistance of the haptic actuators to simulate different object types (e.g., a button press, a slider control).
*   **Biofeedback Integration:** Adjust haptic feedback based on user physiological signals (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance).
*   **Spatial Audio Integration:** Combine haptic feedback with spatial audio cues to create a more immersive and intuitive interface.
*   **Haptic Notifications:** Use subtle haptic pulses to convey notifications or alerts.
