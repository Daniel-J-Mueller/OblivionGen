## Dynamic Data Pipeline Self-Repair & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the data lineage tracking to not just *record* pipeline events, but to *predict* potential failures based on deviations from established lineage patterns, and *automatically initiate self-repair* via dynamic rerouting.

**Specifications:**

**1. Enhanced Lineage Graph:**

*   **Node Attributes:** Each data set node stores:
    *   `data_quality_score`: A quantifiable metric representing the dataset's health (completeness, accuracy, timeliness). Updated continuously via data quality checks.
    *   `expected_arrival_time`: Predicted arrival time based on historical lineage.
    *   `actual_arrival_time`: Timestamp of actual arrival.
    *   `processing_latency`: Time taken for computation at a stage.
*   **Edge Attributes:** Each event/edge stores:
    *   `execution_status`: (Success, Failure, Warning)
    *   `resource_utilization`: CPU, Memory, Disk I/O used during event execution.
    *   `event_timestamp`: Precise timestamp of event occurrence.

**2. Anomaly Detection Engine:**

*   **Input:** Enhanced lineage graph data.
*   **Algorithms:**
    *   **Time Series Analysis:** Detect deviations from `expected_arrival_time` and `processing_latency` baselines.  Utilize techniques like ARIMA, Prophet, or LSTM for forecasting.
    *   **Statistical Outlier Detection:** Identify data quality scores falling outside acceptable ranges (e.g., using Z-score or IQR).
    *   **Pattern Recognition:**  Identify unusual sequences of events (e.g., repeated failures at a specific stage). Utilize machine learning models trained on historical lineage data.
*   **Output:**  Anomaly score for each event and data set node.  Triggers alerts based on configurable thresholds.

**3. Dynamic Rerouting & Self-Repair Module:**

*   **Rerouting Rules Engine:** Defines alternative data paths based on detected anomalies.  Rules can be simple (e.g., “if stage X fails, route data to backup stage Y”) or complex (e.g., “if data quality score of dataset Z falls below threshold, route data to enrichment stage A”).
*   **Automated Remediation:**  Based on rerouting rules, the module automatically:
    *   Redirects data flow to alternative processing stages.
    *   Triggers data reprocessing with different parameters.
    *   Scales resources at affected stages.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Records the effectiveness of self-repair actions to refine rerouting rules and anomaly detection models.  Uses reinforcement learning to optimize rerouting strategies over time.

**4.  Predictive Lineage Modeling:**

*   **Historical Data Collection:**  Gather historical lineage data, including successful and failed pipelines.
*   **Predictive Model Training:**  Train machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, neural networks) to predict the likelihood of pipeline failures based on current lineage graph data.
*   **Proactive Remediation:**  Based on predictive models, proactively scale resources or trigger preventative maintenance before failures occur.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection & Rerouting):**

```
function detect_anomaly(lineage_graph):
  for each node in lineage_graph:
    calculate_expected_arrival_time(node)
    calculate_data_quality_score(node)

  for each edge in lineage_graph:
    calculate_execution_status(edge)

  anomaly_scores = calculate_anomaly_scores(lineage_graph)
  return anomaly_scores

function trigger_rerouting(anomaly_scores, lineage_graph):
  for each node in lineage_graph:
    if anomaly_scores[node] > threshold:
      rerouting_path = find_alternative_path(node)
      redirect_data(node, rerouting_path)

function find_alternative_path(node):
  # Implementation details for finding a valid alternate route
  # Based on predefined rules and available resources
  return alternative_path

function redirect_data(node, path):
  # Implementation details for redirecting data to the specified path
  # Ensures data integrity and consistency
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Lineage Graph:** Graph database (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph) to store nodes (datasets) and edges (events).
*   **Rerouting Rules:** Configuration file or database table defining alternative data paths.
*   **Anomaly Thresholds:** Configurable parameters defining acceptable levels of deviation.
*   **Historical Lineage Data:** Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) to store historical lineage data for anomaly detection and predictive modeling.
