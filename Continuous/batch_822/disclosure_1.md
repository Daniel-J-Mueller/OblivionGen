## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Spatial Audio Mapping

**Concept:** Expand echo cancellation beyond simply *removing* reflections to actively *reconstructing* the acoustic scene. Instead of aiming for "silence", aim for accurate spatial audio rendering based on captured reflections.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Microphone Array:** High-density microphone array (64+ mics) embedded within the device (speaker, conferencing system, etc.).  Array geometry should prioritize both spatial resolution and accurate time-of-flight measurements.
*   **Reference Audio Inputs:**  Multiple (>=3) dedicated inputs for direct reference audio feeds from each speaker driver.
*   **High-Performance DSP/FPGA:**  Dedicated processing unit capable of real-time processing of a large number of audio channels and complex algorithms.
*   **Spatial Audio Renderer:** Hardware/software capable of rendering spatial audio using techniques like Wave Field Synthesis or Ambisonics.

**2. Software Modules:**

*   **Beamforming & Source Localization:** Advanced beamforming algorithms (e.g., MVDR, MUSIC) to accurately localize sound sources (speakers, voices) in the environment.  Utilize the microphone array for spatial sound source estimation.
*   **Impulse Response (IR) Capture:** Dynamically capture the impulse response between each speaker and the microphone array. This IR represents the acoustic path (reflections, diffraction, absorption) between the speaker and the microphones.
*   **Echo Cancellation with IR-Aware Adaptation:** Modified echo cancellation algorithm that *doesn’t* simply remove echo, but *estimates* the IR of the echo path. Instead of subtracting a scaled replica of the reference signal, it utilizes the estimated IR to model the echo and subtract a *convolved* replica. This preserves early reflections for spatial cues.
*   **Acoustic Scene Reconstruction Engine:**  Module that combines estimated IRs from all speakers and ambient noise sources. Creates a ‘point cloud’ representation of the acoustic environment, mapping sound sources and reflective surfaces.
*   **Spatial Audio Rendering Module:** Transforms the acoustic scene representation into a spatial audio output.  Uses techniques like Wave Field Synthesis or Ambisonics to recreate the sound field accurately.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation & Learning:**  Employ machine learning techniques (e.g., Reinforcement Learning) to dynamically adapt the IR estimation and spatial rendering parameters based on real-time feedback and user preferences.

**3. Algorithm Flow (Pseudocode):**

```
FOR each speaker:
    RECEIVE reference audio signal
    ESTIMATE IR between speaker and microphone array using adaptive filtering
    RECEIVE audio signal from microphone array
    CONVOLVE reference audio signal with estimated IR (creates estimated echo)
    SUBTRACT estimated echo from microphone signal (residual signal)
    UPDATE estimated IR based on residual signal and reference signal

FOREACH ambient sound source:
    ESTIMATE IR between source and microphone array using adaptive filtering.

CREATE acoustic scene representation (point cloud) using estimated IRs.

RENDER spatial audio output using acoustic scene representation.

UPDATE IR estimates and rendering parameters based on user feedback and real-time analysis.
```

**4. Novel Aspects:**

*   **IR-Based Echo Cancellation:** Moving beyond simple subtraction to a model-based approach.
*   **Acoustic Scene Reconstruction:**  Creating a dynamic model of the environment.
*   **Spatial Audio Output:**  Recreating a realistic sound field instead of eliminating echo.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:**  Learning and improving the reconstruction and rendering over time.

**5. Potential Applications:**

*   **Conference Rooms:**  Realistic telepresence experiences.
*   **Virtual Reality:**  Immersive audio experiences.
*   **Automotive:**  Enhanced in-car audio and communication.
*   **Gaming:**  Realistic spatial audio cues.
