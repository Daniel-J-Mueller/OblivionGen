## Dynamic Produce Ripening Prediction & Automated Recipe Suggestion

**System Overview:** A network of in-refrigerator sensors (weight, humidity, ethylene gas) paired with a cloud-based machine learning model to predict the ripening stage of produce, integrated with a recipe database, and delivered via voice/visual interface.

**Core Innovation:** Moves beyond simple inventory tracking to *anticipatory* food management, minimizing waste and inspiring culinary creativity.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **In-Refrigerator Sensor Array:**
    *   Weight Sensor: High-precision load cell integrated into produce drawer. Resolution: 1 gram.
    *   Humidity Sensor: Capacitive humidity sensor. Accuracy: ±2% RH.
    *   Ethylene Gas Sensor: Electrochemical sensor, range 0-10 ppm.
    *   Microcontroller: ESP32, WiFi enabled for data transmission.
    *   Power: USB powered or rechargeable battery.
*   **Refrigerator Interface:** Existing refrigerator display/speaker system utilized. Alternatively, dedicated smart display.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   Sensor reading frequency: Adjustable, default 15 minutes.
    *   Data transmission protocol: MQTT over WiFi.
    *   Data storage: Cloud-based time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB).
2.  **Ripening Prediction Model:**
    *   Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – LSTM preferred for time-series data.
    *   Training Data: Large dataset of produce ripening data (weight, humidity, ethylene, visual data).
    *   Output: Probability distribution representing the ripeness stage (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe) for each tracked item.
3.  **Recipe Database:**
    *   Comprehensive database of recipes tagged with ingredients and ripeness suitability.
    *   API for recipe search and retrieval.
4.  **User Interface:**
    *   Voice Control: Integration with existing voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant).
    *   Visual Display: Interactive touchscreen interface for viewing inventory, ripeness predictions, and recipe suggestions.

**Pseudocode - Recipe Suggestion Engine:**

```
FUNCTION suggest_recipes(produce_list, ripeness_predictions):
  // produce_list = list of produce items (e.g., "tomato", "banana")
  // ripeness_predictions = dictionary mapping produce item to ripeness stage (e.g., {"tomato": "ripe", "banana": "unripe"})

  filtered_recipes = []

  FOR each recipe IN recipe_database:
    recipe_ingredients = recipe.ingredients  // List of ingredients required for the recipe
    recipe_suitable = TRUE

    FOR each ingredient IN recipe_ingredients:
      IF ingredient IN produce_list:
        IF ripeness_predictions[ingredient] != recipe.required_ripeness[ingredient]:
          recipe_suitable = FALSE
          BREAK // Stop checking ingredients if one is unsuitable
      ELSE:
        // Ingredient not in inventory. Mark as unsuitable
        recipe_suitable = FALSE
        BREAK

    IF recipe_suitable:
      filtered_recipes.append(recipe)

  // Sort recipes by a 'suitability score' based on how closely the ripeness matches requirements
  sorted_recipes = sort(filtered_recipes, key=lambda recipe: recipe.suitability_score)

  RETURN top_n(sorted_recipes, 5) // Return the top 5 most suitable recipes
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  Sensors collect data on produce items in the refrigerator.
2.  Data is transmitted to the cloud-based machine learning model.
3.  The model predicts the ripeness stage of each item.
4.  The recipe suggestion engine identifies recipes that utilize those ingredients at their current ripeness.
5.  The user is presented with recipe suggestions via voice or visual interface.
6.  User selects a recipe, and system provides step-by-step instructions.
