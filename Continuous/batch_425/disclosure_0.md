## Dynamic Impression Sequencing & Predictive Channel Blending

**Concept:** Extend the incremental probability calculation to not just assess *individual* channel/message combinations, but to actively sequence impressions across channels based on predicted user journey and dynamically blend channels *during* a single conversion event.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `UserJourneyProfile`: Stores a probabilistic model of typical user behavior pre-conversion.  This includes:
    *   `ChannelSequenceProbabilities`: A matrix of probabilities indicating the likelihood of transitioning from one channel to another. (e.g., P(Email -> Push Notification -> In-App Message)).
    *   `TimeDecayFactors`:  Factors that decrease the value of past impressions based on time elapsed.
    *   `ChannelAffinityScores`:  Individual user preference scores for each channel (derived from historical engagement).
*   `ImpressionNode`: Represents a single impression delivered to a user. Contains:
    *   `ChannelID`: Identifier for the delivery channel.
    *   `MessageID`: Identifier for the delivered message.
    *   `Timestamp`: Time of delivery.
    *   `EngagementScore`: Measure of user interaction (click, open, etc.).
*   `ConversionEvent`: Records a completed conversion, linking it to the preceding `ImpressionNodes`.

**2. Algorithm (executed by a central prediction engine):**

```pseudocode
function predict_optimal_impression_sequence(user_profile, message_pool):
  journey_profile = user_profile.get_journey_profile()
  message_scores = calculate_initial_message_scores(message_pool, user_profile)

  impression_sequence = []
  current_channel = journey_profile.get_most_likely_start_channel()
  
  while conversion_probability < threshold AND max_impressions_reached == false:
    best_message = select_message(message_scores, current_channel)
    
    impression = deliver_message(best_message, current_channel, user_profile)
    impression_sequence.append(impression)

    # Calculate incremental probability for this impression
    incremental_probability = calculate_incremental_probability(impression, impression_sequence, user_profile)
    
    # Update message scores (decaying scores of less relevant messages)
    message_scores = update_message_scores(message_scores, incremental_probability, user_profile)
    
    # Predict next channel based on user journey profile and current impression
    next_channel = predict_next_channel(impression_sequence, journey_profile)
    current_channel = next_channel

  return impression_sequence
```

**3.  Dynamic Channel Blending:**

During a single conversion event (e.g., a purchase), the system can dynamically blend channels in real-time. For example:

*   User initiates checkout on web.
*   System detects cart abandonment.
*   Simultaneously sends:
    *   Push notification reminding of cart.
    *   Personalized email with special offer.
    *   In-app message (if user re-opens mobile app).

The weighting of each channel is determined by the user's `ChannelAffinityScores` and the current state of the conversion funnel.

**4.  Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Real-time data pipeline to ingest user engagement data.
*   Machine learning model to predict user journey and channel affinity.
*   A/B testing framework to evaluate different impression sequencing strategies.
*   Scalable messaging infrastructure to deliver personalized content across multiple channels.

**5. Pseudocode for `calculate_incremental_probability`:**

```pseudocode
function calculate_incremental_probability(impression, impression_sequence, user_profile):
  base_probability = user_profile.get_base_conversion_probability()
  
  #Calculate probability based on impression sequence, factoring in time decay
  sequence_probability = 1.0
  for prev_impression in impression_sequence:
    time_difference = current_time - prev_impression.timestamp
    sequence_probability *= (1 - time_difference * user_profile.decay_factor) * prev_impression.engagement_score

  # Add incremental contribution of the current impression
  incremental_probability = (base_probability * sequence_probability) + (impression.engagement_score * user_profile.channel_affinity[impression.channel_id])

  return incremental_probability
```

This system moves beyond simply *selecting* the best channel for a single impression. It actively *orchestrates* a sequence of impressions, dynamically blending channels to maximize the likelihood of conversion.
