## Predictive Fleet-Wide Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Leverage anomaly detection – as described in the provided patent – not just for *alerting* on performance deviations, but as a *leading indicator* for proactive resource allocation across a fleet of computing systems. Instead of simply flagging issues, we predict resource *needs* before they become bottlenecks.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Extend existing input data to include not just performance metrics (CPU, memory, etc.) but also queued task/request data *and* anticipated workload increases (scheduled batch jobs, projected user activity, external event triggers).
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**  Implement a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM neural network) trained on historical performance *and* workload data. This model will predict future resource utilization for *each* system in the fleet. The core here isn't anomaly detection of *current* state, but prediction of *future* need.
*   **Fleet-Wide Coordinator:** A central service responsible for aggregating predictions from all systems. This service determines overall fleet resource demand and identifies potential imbalances.
*   **Dynamic Resource Shifting:** The Coordinator initiates automated resource reallocation. This could involve:
    *   **Virtual Machine Scaling:** Automatically scaling up/down VMs based on predicted demand.
    *   **Container Orchestration:** Adjusting the number of container replicas.
    *   **Workload Migration:**  Dynamically migrating workloads from systems predicted to be overloaded to systems with available capacity.  This requires a workload profiling component to understand dependencies and minimize disruption.
*   **Anomaly-Triggered Adjustment:** Use the existing anomaly detection system as a feedback loop. If a system *still* experiences performance degradation *despite* the predictive allocation, the anomaly detection system triggers a more aggressive response (e.g., emergency scaling, task rescheduling).

**Pseudocode (Fleet-Wide Coordinator):**

```
// Every 'prediction_interval' (e.g., 5 minutes):

FOR EACH system IN fleet:
    predicted_resource_usage = system.predict_resource_usage() // Uses time-series model
    total_predicted_usage = total_predicted_usage + predicted_resource_usage

// Calculate total available resources in the fleet

IF total_predicted_usage > total_available_resources:
    // Resource shortage predicted

    // Identify systems with excess capacity

    // Migrate workloads/Scale VMs to balance load

    // Log resource allocation decisions
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond reactive anomaly detection to *proactive* resource management. The patent focuses on *detecting* problems; this system *prevents* them by predicting and addressing resource constraints *before* they impact performance. It’s shifting the focus from ‘what’s wrong’ to ‘what’s likely to go wrong.’ It also introduces the concept of predictive workload migration, rather than just immediate scaling.
