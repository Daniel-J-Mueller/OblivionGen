## Modular Vertical Farm Integration

**Concept:** Adapt the storage module concept for vertical farming, specifically aeroponics or hydroponics, creating a self-contained, automated plant-growing system.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** Standardized module width (matching existing storage module lateral dimension) and length. Variable height â€“ scalable in increments of 30cm.
*   **Guiderails:** Retain existing guiderail system for carrier movement.  Material: Food-grade, UV-resistant polymer.
*   **Inventory Carriers (Plant Trays):** Replace storage containers with shallow, food-grade plant trays.  Trays have integrated irrigation/misting nozzles and drainage systems.  Tray base material: Inert, porous material for root support. Tray dimensions adjusted for plant types.
*   **Lighting System:**  Integrated LED grow lights mounted *within* the guiderail structure, providing uniform illumination across all carriers. Light spectrum adjustable via central control.  Power supplied via conductive tracks embedded in guiderails.
*   **Nutrient Delivery System:**  Central reservoir containing nutrient solution. Micro-pumps (driven by the existing drivetrain) deliver precise nutrient amounts to each tray via integrated nozzles. Recirculation system with filtration to remove waste and maintain solution pH/EC.
*   **Environmental Control:**  Integrated sensors (temperature, humidity, CO2) within each module.  Ventilation fans (powered by drivetrain) for air circulation and humidity control.  Optional: Integrated heating/cooling elements for temperature regulation.
*   **Automated Harvesting:**  Extend the drivetrain to include a robotic arm (mounted on a dedicated carrier). Arm utilizes vision system to identify mature plants and gently harvest them. Harvested plants deposited into a collection container at module end.
*   **Drivetrain Modification:** Existing drivetrain repurposed to move carriers through the growing cycle (seed -> mature plant -> harvest). Programmable speed and dwell times for optimal growth. 
*   **Software Control:**  Central control software monitors sensor data, adjusts lighting/nutrient delivery, and controls the robotic arm.  Remote access and data logging capabilities. User interface for setting growing parameters.

**Pseudocode (Plant Tray Movement & Nutrient Delivery):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    for each tray in module {
        // Check tray status (seed, seedling, mature)
        status = getTrayStatus(tray);

        if (status == "seed") {
            // Activate misting nozzles for germination
            activateMisting(tray);
        } else if (status == "seedling") {
            // Deliver nutrient solution (low concentration)
            deliverNutrients(tray, lowConcentration);
            // Activate grow lights (blue spectrum)
            setGrowLights(tray, blueSpectrum);
        } else if (status == "mature") {
            // Deliver nutrient solution (high concentration)
            deliverNutrients(tray, highConcentration);
            // Activate grow lights (red spectrum)
            setGrowLights(tray, redSpectrum);
            // Check for harvest readiness (vision system)
            if (harvestReady(tray)) {
                // Activate robotic arm
                harvestPlant(tray);
            }
        }

        // Move tray to next position in cycle
        moveTray(tray, nextPosition);
    }
}
