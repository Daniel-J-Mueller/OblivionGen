## Dynamic Carrier Aggregation via Predictive Modeling & User Preference

**System Overview:**

A system designed to proactively aggregate carrier signals *before* a handoff is triggered, utilizing predictive modeling of signal quality and user-defined preferences for specific carrier characteristics (speed, cost, reliability). This goes beyond simply switching *to* a carrier; it aims to *combine* signals for increased bandwidth and resilience.

**Components:**

1.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:**  A machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network or long short-term memory network) trained on:
    *   Real-time signal strength (RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ) from all available carriers.
    *   Historical signal data correlated with location (GPS, cell tower triangulation).
    *   Network congestion data (estimated or provided by carriers).
    *   User-defined preferences (see #2).
2.  **User Preference Module:** Allows users to prioritize carriers based on:
    *   Cost (e.g., “Prefer free Wi-Fi when available, then lowest data cost carrier”).
    *   Speed (e.g., “Prioritize highest speed even if more expensive”).
    *   Reliability (e.g., “Favor carriers with consistently strong signals”).
    *   Specific Applications (e.g., "Prioritize low-latency carrier for gaming").
3.  **Carrier Aggregation Manager:** Controls the wireless modem and manages the combining of signals from multiple carriers.  Requires a modem capable of supporting carrier aggregation.
4.  **Signal Quality Monitor:** Continuously monitors signal quality from all available carriers, feeding data into the Predictive Modeling Engine.
5.  **Location Service:** Provides accurate location data to the Predictive Modeling Engine.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The Signal Quality Monitor and Location Service continuously collect data.
2.  The Predictive Modeling Engine analyzes the data, predicting future signal quality for each carrier based on location and historical trends.
3.  The Engine incorporates User Preferences to determine the optimal carrier combination.
4.  The Carrier Aggregation Manager proactively instructs the modem to begin aggregating signals from the selected carriers *before* signal degradation on the current carrier is significant.
5.  The system continuously monitors performance and adjusts the carrier aggregation as needed.

**Pseudocode (Carrier Aggregation Manager):**

```
function aggregate_carriers(predicted_carrier_list, user_preferences):
  // predicted_carrier_list is a ranked list of carriers
  // user_preferences defines desired characteristics (speed, cost, etc.)

  selected_carriers = []

  for carrier in predicted_carrier_list:
    if carrier meets user_preference criteria AND 
       signal_strength(carrier) > threshold:
      selected_carriers.append(carrier)
      if length(selected_carriers) == max_carriers:  //limit for hardware
        break

  if length(selected_carriers) > 0:
    initiate_carrier_aggregation(selected_carriers)
    monitor_aggregated_performance(selected_carriers)  //ongoing performance check
  else:
    //fallback to best available single carrier 
    connect_to_best_available_carrier()

function monitor_aggregated_performance(carriers):
  //Continuously monitor RSSI, RSRP, RSRQ, throughput for each carrier
  //If performance drops below acceptable levels, re-evaluate carrier selection
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Wireless modem supporting carrier aggregation (multiple RF front-ends).
*   GPS receiver or other location service.
*   Sufficient processing power to run the Predictive Modeling Engine.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased bandwidth and throughput.
*   Improved network reliability and resilience.
*   Seamless handoffs without interruption.
*   Optimized network performance based on user preferences.
*   Reduced data costs by leveraging cheaper carriers when possible.
