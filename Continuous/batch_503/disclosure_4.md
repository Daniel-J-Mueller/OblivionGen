## Dynamic Pricing & Predictive Bundling via Sentiment Analysis

**Concept:** Leverage real-time sentiment analysis of social media and product reviews to dynamically adjust bundle pricing *before* a customer adds items to a cart, and proactively suggest optimized bundles based on predicted purchase intent.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Processing Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Twitter API, Reddit API, Product Review APIs (Amazon, Best Buy, etc.), News APIs (for event-driven pricing - e.g., Super Bowl influencing snack bundle pricing).
*   **Sentiment Analysis Engine:** Employ a pre-trained NLP model (BERT, RoBERTa) fine-tuned on e-commerce data to classify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) towards specific products and categories.  Real-time sentiment scores assigned to each item.
*   **Trend Identification:** Algorithm to identify emerging trends and viral products based on rapidly changing sentiment scores and keyword frequency.
*   **Data Pipeline:** Kafka-based message queue for high-throughput data ingestion and processing.  Data stored in a time-series database (InfluxDB) for fast querying.

**II. Predictive Bundling Engine:**

*   **Association Rule Mining:** Apriori algorithm or similar to identify frequently co-purchased items. Initial bundle suggestions generated based on historical purchase data.
*   **Collaborative Filtering:** Implement a user-based or item-based collaborative filtering model to predict which items a user might be interested in based on their past behavior and the behavior of similar users.
*   **Sentiment-Weighted Recommendations:** Adjust recommendation scores based on real-time sentiment. Products with high positive sentiment receive a boost.  Products with negative sentiment may be downweighted or excluded from bundle suggestions.
*   **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm:**
    *   Calculate a baseline bundle price based on the sum of individual item prices.
    *   Adjust the bundle price based on:
        *   Average sentiment score of items in the bundle.
        *   Demand for individual items (tracked via real-time sales data).
        *   Competitor pricing (scraped from competitor websites).
        *   Inventory levels.
    *   Employ a reinforcement learning model (Q-learning) to optimize bundle pricing over time, maximizing revenue.

**III. User Interface Integration:**

*   **Proactive Bundle Suggestions:** Display a "Complete the Bundle" section on product pages, suggesting optimized bundles based on the user's current browsing activity and predicted purchase intent.
*   **Real-time Price Updates:**  Display dynamic bundle prices that reflect real-time sentiment and demand.
*   **"Sentiment Score" Indicator:** Optionally display a "Sentiment Score" next to each product in a bundle, giving the user insight into how well-received the product is by other customers.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Implement an A/B testing framework to compare the performance of different bundling strategies and pricing algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Bundle Pricing):**

```
function calculate_bundle_price(bundle_items):
    baseline_price = sum(item.price for item in bundle_items)
    sentiment_score = average(item.sentiment_score for item in bundle_items)
    demand_factor = calculate_demand_factor(bundle_items)  // Based on real-time sales data
    competitor_price = get_average_competitor_price(bundle_items)
    inventory_factor = calculate_inventory_factor(bundle_items) // based on low stock triggers

    price_adjustment = (sentiment_score * 0.1) + (demand_factor * 0.2) - (competitor_price * 0.1) + (inventory_factor * 0.05)

    final_price = baseline_price * (1 + price_adjustment)
    return final_price
```

**Scalability & Infrastructure:**

*   Microservices architecture.
*   Kubernetes for container orchestration.
*   Cloud-based infrastructure (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
*   Caching layer (Redis) for fast data access.
