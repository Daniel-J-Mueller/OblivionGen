## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Inventory System

**Concept:** Expand the sensor suite beyond weight/distance to include resonant frequency analysis of the stored item. Each item possesses a natural resonant frequency. By actively probing for this frequency, we move beyond simply *detecting* a change in amount, to *identifying* the item itself and its unique physical characteristics. This enables more accurate inventory, quality control, and predictive maintenance.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Load Cell (Existing - for baseline weight measurement)
    *   Time-of-Flight Sensor (Existing - for baseline distance/volume measurement)
    *   Miniature Exciter/Transducer: Capable of generating and detecting mechanical vibrations across a range of frequencies (10Hz – 10kHz).  Mounting point adjacent to the item storage location.
    *   Microphone Array:  High-sensitivity microphones to capture resonant frequencies.  Placement optimized for triangulation.
    *   Temperature Sensor: To compensate for temperature-related frequency shifts.
*   **ARD Processor Requirements:**
    *   Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) capability for frequency analysis.
    *   Machine Learning (ML) model for frequency signature identification. Training data derived from known item profiles.
    *   Adaptive Filtering algorithms to reduce noise and environmental interference.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    1.  **Excitation Phase:** The miniature exciter generates a swept sine wave across the defined frequency range.
    2.  **Acquisition Phase:** The microphone array captures the resulting vibrations.
    3.  **Signal Processing:** FFT applied to the captured audio data to identify dominant frequencies.
    4.  **Signature Matching:** The identified frequencies are compared against a database of known item signatures.
    5.  **Confidence Scoring:** A confidence score is assigned based on the degree of match.
    6.  **Anomaly Detection:** If the signature doesn’t match or the confidence score is low, an anomaly is flagged.
*   **Communication Protocol:** 
    *   Transmit not only quantity changes but *frequency signature data* to the backend.
    *   Backend updates item profiles based on aggregated frequency data from multiple ARDs (swarm learning).
*   **Power Management:**
    *   Frequency scanning performed periodically or triggered by weight/volume changes.
    *   Adaptive scan frequency range based on item type (learned from historical data).

**Pseudocode (ARD side):**

```
FUNCTION scan_item():
    GENERATE swept_sine_wave(frequency_range, duration)
    CAPTURE vibration_data(duration)
    frequencies = FFT(vibration_data)
    signature = identify_signature(frequencies)
    
    IF signature.confidence > threshold:
        RETURN signature
    ELSE:
        FLAG anomaly
        RETURN null
    
FUNCTION update_inventory(signature):
    // Calculate amount based on signature properties
    // Update inventory count
    
FUNCTION periodic_task():
    signature = scan_item()
    IF signature != null:
        update_inventory(signature)
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Quality Control:**  Deviations in resonant frequency could indicate damage, leaks, or other quality issues.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:** Monitor frequency shifts over time to anticipate failures.
*   **Item Authentication:** Use frequency signatures as a unique identifier for preventing counterfeiting.
*   **Material Composition Analysis:** Fine-grained frequency analysis could potentially reveal information about the material composition of the item.
