**Adaptive Font Substitution & Rendering for Enhanced Homograph Attack Mitigation**

**Concept:** The existing patent identifies homograph attacks by recognizing discrepancies between OCR’d text and the original. This builds on that by *actively* substituting fonts in real-time during rendering, based on detected locale and potential attack vectors, effectively ‘breaking’ the visual consistency required for successful attacks.

**Specs:**

1.  **Font Database:** A curated database of fonts, categorized by Unicode block and visual similarity to common homographic characters.  Each font entry contains metadata: Unicode coverage, visual characteristics (stroke width, serif/sans-serif, x-height), and a ‘disruption score’ indicating how much it alters the appearance of potentially malicious characters.

2.  **Locale & Threat Context Integration:** The system integrates with device locale settings (as in the original patent) *and* a dynamic threat feed. The threat feed provides information on known homograph attack vectors – specific character substitutions used in phishing or malware campaigns.

3.  **Real-time Font Substitution Engine:** 
    *   Intercepts text rendering requests (e.g., from a browser or application).
    *   Analyzes the text for characters present in the threat feed *or* known to be prone to homographic substitution.
    *   Based on device locale, threat feed data, and a configurable ‘security level’ (user adjustable), selects a substitute font. The selection prioritizes fonts with high disruption scores for identified characters, but minimizes overall visual disruption to maintain readability.
    *   The substitution is performed *before* rendering, so the user never sees the original potentially malicious characters.

4.  **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** Seamless integration with existing rendering pipelines (DirectX, OpenGL, Metal, WebGPU). This may require custom shaders or font rendering libraries.

5.  **Adaptive Security Level:**
    *   **Low:** Minimal font substitution, primarily focusing on high-confidence attack vectors. Prioritizes readability.
    *   **Medium:** Moderate font substitution, balancing readability and security.
    *   **High:** Aggressive font substitution, prioritizing security over readability. May significantly alter the appearance of text.  User adjustable.

6.  **Dynamic Learning:**  A machine learning component analyzes user interactions (e.g., mouse clicks, keystrokes) following font substitution. If the user behaves normally, the substitution is considered successful. If the user exhibits suspicious behavior (e.g., entering credentials), the system adjusts the disruption score or prioritizes different fonts.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function RenderText(text, font, locale, threatFeed) {
  if (threatFeed.contains(text)) { //Simplified check, could be more complex
    substitutedText = ApplyFontSubstitution(text, locale, threatFeed);
  } else {
    substitutedText = text;
  }

  render(substitutedText, font);
}

function ApplyFontSubstitution(text, locale, threatFeed) {
  for each character in text {
    if (threatFeed.isVulnerable(character, locale)) {
      replacementFont = SelectReplacementFont(character, locale, threatFeed);
      substitutedText += RenderCharacterWithFont(character, replacementFont);
    } else {
      substitutedText += character;
    }
  }
  return substitutedText;
}

function SelectReplacementFont(character, locale, threatFeed) {
  // Logic to select font with high disruption score, considering locale and threat data
  // Prioritize fonts that significantly alter the appearance of the character
  // Return selected font object
}

function RenderCharacterWithFont(character, font) {
  // Render the character using the specified font
  // Return rendered character string or image data
}
```

This isn't just detecting attacks; it's actively disrupting them at the rendering level, making it significantly harder for attackers to succeed. The adaptive learning component helps optimize the system for individual users and environments.
