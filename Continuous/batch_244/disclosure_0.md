## Dynamic Risk-Based Feature Flag Control

**Concept:** Expand the risk assessment beyond code *changes* to encompass feature *flags*.  Instead of just assessing the risk of deploying modified code, assess the risk of *enabling* a new or modified feature governed by a feature flag. This allows for phased rollouts with dynamically adjusted risk profiles.

**Specifications:**

**1. Feature Flag Metadata:**

*   **Flag ID:** Unique identifier for the feature flag.
*   **Code Path Impacted:** List of code paths (functions, modules, files) directly affected by the feature flag. This can be automatically extracted during code commit/PR.
*   **User Segment:** Defines the target user group for the feature (e.g., internal users, beta testers, percentage of total users).
*   **Baseline Metrics:** Capture pre-flag activation metrics for impacted code paths (CPU usage, memory usage, error rates, latency).
*   **Risk Profile:** Initial risk assessment based on code changes associated with the flag. (Leverage the existing patent's AST comparison and execution rate analysis, applying it to the code *behind* the flag.)
*   **Rollout Stage:** (e.g., “Internal Testing”, “Beta”, “Production – 1%”, “Production – 100%”).
*   **Automated Rollback Thresholds:** Define metric-based thresholds that automatically disable the flag if performance degrades beyond acceptable limits.

**2. Risk Assessment Engine Integration:**

*   Extend the existing risk assessment system to analyze code associated with feature flags.
*   When a new flag is created or modified, the system automatically performs AST comparison and execution rate analysis on the code paths controlled by the flag.
*   The risk score for the flag is calculated based on:
    *   Code change risk (from the patent’s method).
    *   Impacted user segment size (larger segments = higher risk).
    *   Criticality of the affected code paths (e.g., core functionality vs. non-essential features).

**3. Dynamic Rollout Control:**

*   Implement a dynamic rollout engine that adjusts the rollout schedule based on real-time metrics and the flag's risk score.
*   **Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    function adjustRollout(flag, currentRolloutPercentage, realTimeMetrics):
        riskScore = calculateRiskScore(flag)
        
        if riskScore > HighRiskThreshold:
            pauseRollout(flag) //Revert to previous state
            sendAlert(flag, "High risk detected, rollout paused")
        elif riskScore > MediumRiskThreshold AND currentRolloutPercentage < 50%:
            incrementRolloutPercentage(flag, 5%)
        elif riskScore < LowRiskThreshold AND currentRolloutPercentage < 100%:
            incrementRolloutPercentage(flag, 10%)
        else:
            maintainRolloutPercentage(flag)
    ```
*   Rollout increment/decrement values should be configurable.

**4. Real-time Monitoring & Alerting:**

*   Integrate with existing monitoring systems to track key metrics for code paths controlled by feature flags.
*   Define alerts based on pre-defined thresholds.
*   Automatic rollback functionality triggered by alerts.

**5. Historical Analysis & Learning:**

*   Store historical data on flag rollouts, metrics, and alerts.
*   Use machine learning to identify patterns and improve risk assessment accuracy over time.
*   Predict potential issues before they occur.
