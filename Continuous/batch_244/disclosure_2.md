## Dynamic Model Composition via Learned Dependency Graphs

**Concept:** Extend the patent's job queue and dependency management to facilitate *dynamic* model composition. Instead of solely training *one* model, the system learns a dependency graph of smaller, specialized models, composing them at inference time to optimize for specific input characteristics.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Graph Learning Module:**

*   **Input:** Training data, a library of pre-trained, specialized models (image classifiers, object detectors, text summarizers, etc.), and a performance metric definition (latency, accuracy, resource usage).
*   **Process:**
    *   Partition the training data into subsets representative of different input characteristics (e.g., image resolution, lighting conditions, text length, sentiment).
    *   For each subset, evaluate the performance of each pre-trained model.
    *   Construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent models and edges represent learned dependencies. Edge weight indicates the strength of the dependency (e.g., improvement in performance when model A is followed by model B).
    *   Employ reinforcement learning to explore different graph structures and optimize for the defined performance metric. The reward function should penalize complex graphs (number of nodes/edges) and reward performance improvement.
*   **Output:** A trained dependency graph representing optimal model composition for different input characteristics. This graph is stored as a system artifact.

**2. Input Characteristic Analyzer:**

*   **Input:** Incoming input data.
*   **Process:** Analyze input data to extract key characteristics (e.g., image resolution, dominant colors, text length, sentiment).
*   **Output:** A feature vector representing the input characteristics.

**3. Dynamic Composition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Input characteristic feature vector, trained dependency graph.
*   **Process:**
    *   Map the input characteristic feature vector to a subgraph within the dependency graph. This mapping is achieved using a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity).
    *   Execute the models within the selected subgraph in the order specified by the graph edges.
    *   Stitch together the outputs of the individual models to produce the final result.
*   **Output:** The final output, composed from the outputs of multiple specialized models.

**4. Job Queue Extension:**

*   The job queue must now support dependencies between *model instances* instead of just jobs. Each job in the queue will contain:
    *   Model ID.
    *   Input data.
    *   Dependencies (list of model instances that must complete before this job can start).
    *   Output data storage location.
*   A job scheduler will monitor dependencies and initiate jobs as their dependencies are satisfied.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Composition Engine):**

```
function compose_model(input_data, dependency_graph):
  input_features = analyze_input(input_data)
  best_subgraph = find_best_subgraph(input_features, dependency_graph)

  job_queue = create_job_queue()
  for model in best_subgraph:
    job = create_job(model, input_data)
    job_queue.add_job(job)

  results = execute_job_queue(job_queue)
  final_result = stitch_results(results)
  return final_result
```

**System Artifacts:**

*   Trained dependency graphs (serialized DAGs).
*   Pre-trained specialized models.
*   Input characteristic analysis models.
