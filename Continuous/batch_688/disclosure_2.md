## Dynamic Interference Mapping & Predictive Power Allocation

**Core Concept:** Leverage RSSI/RSQI data, not just for immediate power adjustments, but to build a *dynamic, localized interference map* and *predictive* power allocation scheme.  Instead of reacting to current signal conditions, anticipate future interference hotspots and proactively adjust transmission power *before* they impact communication.

**System Specs:**

*   **Interference Mapping Module:**
    *   Data Input: Continuous RSSI/RSQI readings from the transceiver (as in the base patent) *plus* timestamp and geolocation data (GPS, WiFi triangulation, or similar).
    *   Processing: 
        *   Spatial Binning: Divide the surrounding area into a grid of virtual "bins" (e.g., 10m x 10m).  Associate RSSI/RSQI readings with the bin corresponding to the signal source.
        *   Historical Averaging: Maintain a running average of RSSI/RSQI values *per bin* over a defined period (e.g., 5 minutes, 30 minutes, 24 hours).  Weight recent data more heavily.
        *   Interference Score: Calculate an "interference score" for each bin based on RSSI/RSQI and historical trends.  Higher scores indicate potential interference hotspots.
        *   Map Storage: Store the interference map in non-volatile memory.
*   **Predictive Power Allocation Module:**
    *   Data Input:  Current transmission parameters (frequency, modulation, data rate), interference map, predicted device movement (based on historical data or user input), and communication requirements (bandwidth, latency).
    *   Prediction Algorithm:
        *   Trajectory Estimation: Estimate the future trajectory of both the transmitting and receiving devices.
        *   Interference Projection: Project the estimated device trajectories onto the interference map.  Identify bins that are likely to become interference hotspots along the communication path.
        *   Power Adjustment Calculation: Calculate the optimal transmission power level based on:
            *   Path Loss:  Distance between devices.
            *   Interference Mitigation: Increase power in the direction of the receiver to overcome anticipated interference.
            *   Power Constraints:  Maximum allowed transmission power.
            *   Quality of Service (QoS) requirements.
    *   Power Control Implementation: Dynamically adjust the transmitter power level to meet the calculated optimal level.
*   **Communication Protocol Enhancement:**
    *   Beaconing: Periodically transmit "beacon" signals containing interference map updates to nearby devices.  Enable collaborative interference mapping.
    *   Negotiation:  Enable devices to negotiate power levels and frequencies based on shared interference map data.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Power Allocation Module):**

```
function calculateOptimalPower(currentTxParams, interferenceMap, deviceMovement, QoSRequirements):
  // Calculate path loss
  pathLoss = calculatePathLoss(deviceMovement.distance)

  // Project device trajectories onto interference map
  projectedBins = projectTrajectory(deviceMovement, interferenceMap)

  // Calculate interference impact
  interferenceImpact = 0
  for each bin in projectedBins:
    interferenceImpact += bin.interferenceScore * bin.distanceWeight 

  // Calculate base power level
  basePower = calculateBasePower(pathLoss, QoSRequirements.bandwidth, QoSRequirements.latency)

  // Adjust power level for interference
  adjustedPower = basePower + (interferenceImpact * interferenceWeight)

  // Cap power level at maximum allowed
  adjustedPower = min(adjustedPower, maxPowerLevel)

  return adjustedPower
```

**Novelty & Potential:**  This system moves beyond *reactive* power control to *proactive* interference mitigation.  By building a dynamic, localized interference map and predicting future conditions, it can improve communication reliability and efficiency in congested environments. Collaborative interference mapping enhances the system's awareness and adaptability. The predictive aspect allows the device to optimize power *before* encountering issues.
