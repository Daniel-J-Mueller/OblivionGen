## Adaptive Resolution & Predictive Buffering for Multi-User Panoramic Experiences - "Chameleon View"

**Concept:** Expand upon the buffering and resolution adaptation by introducing a personalized “Chameleon View” system.  Instead of simply increasing buffer size based on aggregate navigation *direction*, actively predict individual user gaze and pre-render/buffer high-resolution tiles centered on predicted gaze points.  Simultaneously, dynamically *degrade* peripheral areas *beyond* predicted gaze, going beyond simple low-resolution outside the field of view.  This will focus rendering power on what the user is *likely* to look at next, maximizing perceived quality while minimizing bandwidth.

**Specs:**

*   **Gaze Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Client device motion data (accelerometer, gyroscope), historical gaze data (if available, with user consent), panoramic video content data (scene understanding - semantic segmentation identifying objects/areas of interest).
    *   Algorithm:  Hybrid approach.  Short-term prediction: Kalman filter based on motion data.  Long-term prediction:  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on aggregated user gaze patterns within similar panoramic scenes. Scene understanding used to bias RNN towards areas with high saliency (e.g., objects, points of interest).
    *   Output: Probability map indicating likelihood of user gaze falling on various tiles within the panoramic video.  Top N tiles with highest probability selected for pre-rendering.

*   **Dynamic Tile Rendering & Degradation:**
    *   Tile Map: Panoramic video divided into a grid of tiles.
    *   Rendering Queue:  Tiles prioritized for rendering based on Gaze Prediction Module output.
    *   Resolution Levels: Minimum of 4 resolution levels per tile (Ultra High, High, Medium, Low).
    *   Degradation Strategy:  Beyond a defined “comfort zone” around predicted gaze (configurable), tiles progressively degraded.  Degradation methods:
        *   Resolution reduction.
        *   Selective blurring.
        *   Abstracted representation (e.g., simplified shapes/colors).
        *   Complete removal (replaced with a solid color or procedural texture).
    *   Bandwidth Adaptation: Based on network conditions, adjust the number of high-resolution tiles rendered, and/or the rate of degradation of peripheral tiles.

*   **Client-Side Implementation:**
    *   Rendering Engine: Optimized for rendering tile-based panoramic video.
    *   Buffering Strategy: Prioritize buffering high-resolution tiles within the predicted gaze area.
    *   Seamless Transition:  Implement smooth transitions between resolution levels and degradation strategies to minimize perceived visual artifacts.
    *   User Control: Allow users to override automated degradation settings (e.g., prioritize overall clarity vs. smooth panning).

*   **Server-Side Implementation:**
    *   Tile Server:  Store panoramic video content as a collection of pre-rendered tiles at multiple resolutions.
    *   Request Manager:  Handle client requests for tiles, prioritizing requests based on predicted gaze.
    *   Dynamic Tile Generation:  On-demand generation of tiles at specific resolutions, if not already available.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Request Handling):**

```
function handleClientRequest(clientID, requestData):
  userGazePrediction = getGazePrediction(clientID, requestData.currentView)
  requestedTiles = requestData.tileList
  prioritizedTiles = sortTilesByGazeProbability(requestedTiles, userGazePrediction)

  for tile in prioritizedTiles:
    if tile.resolution == "Ultra High" and networkBandwidth < threshold:
      tile.resolution = "High"
    if tile.distanceFromGaze > comfortZone:
      tile.resolution = degradeResolution(tile.resolution, distanceFromGaze)

    sendTile(tile)
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply buffering more data in the direction of movement. It anticipates *where* the user will look and *actively* adjusts the visual quality of different parts of the scene *before* they look at them. The dynamic degradation strategy allows for intelligent bandwidth management without sacrificing perceived quality in the area of focus. It moves from reactive buffering to *proactive* rendering.
