## Dynamic Anomaly 'Shadowing' with Synthetic Data Generation

**Concept:** Expand the feedback loop beyond simple threshold adjustment. Instead of *just* adjusting thresholds, actively generate synthetic anomalous data based on the confirmed anomalies and negative feedback, effectively 'shadowing' the evolving anomaly space. This synthetic data is then used to augment the training set, proactively improving the model's ability to detect nuanced anomalies *before* they become critical.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Feedback Aggregation & Anomaly Profiling Module.**
    *   Input:  Positive/Negative anomaly feedback, associated data points (features, timestamps).
    *   Process:
        *   For positive feedback: Extract key feature combinations and patterns characterizing the confirmed anomaly.  Employ dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) to identify core defining characteristics.
        *   For negative feedback:  Capture the feature space surrounding the misidentified anomaly. This 'negative space' is crucial for refining the model's understanding of what *isn’t* anomalous.
*   **Component 2: Synthetic Data Generator.**
    *   Input: Anomaly profile (from Component 1), base dataset statistics (mean, standard deviation, distribution types for each feature), random seed.
    *   Process:
        *   Utilize a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) or Variational Autoencoder (VAE).  Train the GAN/VAE on the base dataset to learn the 'normal' data distribution.
        *   Constrain the GAN/VAE generation process to produce data points that exhibit the characteristics of the confirmed anomaly (as defined by the anomaly profile). This is achieved by manipulating the latent space of the GAN/VAE. For instance, push the latent variables corresponding to the identified key features towards values observed in the confirmed anomalies.
        *   Generate a specified number of synthetic anomalous data points.
        *   Introduce controlled 'noise' into the synthetic data to simulate real-world variations.
*   **Component 3:  Model Retraining & Validation Module.**
    *   Input: Original training data, synthetic anomalous data, trained anomaly detection model.
    *   Process:
        *   Augment the original training dataset with the synthetic anomalous data.
        *   Retrain the anomaly detection model using the augmented dataset.
        *   Validate the retrained model on a separate holdout dataset.
        *   Monitor performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) to assess the effectiveness of the synthetic data augmentation.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (receiving feedback) {
  feedback_type = get_feedback_type()
  data_point = get_data_point()

  if (feedback_type == "positive") {
    anomaly_profile = extract_anomaly_profile(data_point)
    store_anomaly_profile(anomaly_profile)
  } else if (feedback_type == "negative") {
    negative_space = capture_negative_space(data_point)
    store_negative_space(negative_space)
  }

  // Generate Synthetic Data (periodically)
  if (time_to_regenerate()) {
    synthetic_data = generate_synthetic_data(anomaly_profiles, negative_spaces)
    retrain_model(original_data + synthetic_data)
  }
}
```

**Rationale:** Static threshold adjustments are reactive. By actively generating synthetic data, the system proactively learns to detect subtle anomalies and adapts to evolving attack surfaces or system behaviors.  The inclusion of ‘negative space’ data helps the model understand *what isn’t* an anomaly, reducing false positives.
