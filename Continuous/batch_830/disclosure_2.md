## Dynamic Media "Mood Sculpting"

**Concept:** Extend voice control beyond refinement of existing queues to *proactive* mood-based media generation and layering. Instead of simply adjusting a playlist, the system will dynamically construct a multi-layered sonic landscape responsive to spoken emotional cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Mood Engine". A module analyzing incoming audio via ASR and NLU (as in the referenced patent) not for specific song requests, but for *emotional valence* (positive/negative), *arousal* (energy level), and *dominant emotion* (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, peacefulness).
*   **Layered Media Approach:** Instead of a single play queue, the system manages *multiple* simultaneous media streams:
    *   **Foundation Layer:** Ambient soundscapes (nature, city, white noise) selected to match the overall mood.
    *   **Melody Layer:** Instrumental music (classical, electronic, jazz) chosen for emotional resonance.
    *   **Rhythmic Layer:** Percussion or rhythmic elements to modulate energy levels.
    *   **Content Layer:** Traditional songs, spoken word, or podcast segments layered *on top*.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Mood Engine continuously adjusts the volume, tempo, and selection of each layer based on ongoing emotional analysis of user speech.  A sudden spike in anger might increase the intensity of the rhythmic layer and introduce dissonant sounds. A calming statement would favor softer melodies and ambient soundscapes.
*   **"Sculpting" Commands:** Users can "sculpt" the mood using voice commands beyond simple requests:
    *   "More hopeful." -  Increase the major key components in the melody layer.
    *   "Less frantic." -  Reduce tempo and complexity of all layers.
    *   "Add a sense of mystery." – Introduce reverb and darker timbres.
    *   “Bring in the rain”. - Increase the volume and complexity of the foundation layer.
*   **User Profiles & Learning:** The system learns individual preferences over time. The same spoken emotion might trigger different responses for different users.
*    **Pseudocode for Mood Engine Core Logic:**

```
function analyze_audio(audio_input):
  text = ASR(audio_input)
  emotion = NLU(text) // Returns valence, arousal, dominant emotion
  return emotion

function select_media_layers(emotion, user_profile):
  foundation = select_ambient(emotion.valence, emotion.arousal, user_profile)
  melody = select_instrumental(emotion.dominant_emotion, user_profile)
  rhythm = select_percussion(emotion.arousal, user_profile)
  content = select_songs(emotion.dominant_emotion, user_profile)
  return foundation, melody, rhythm, content

function adjust_layers(emotion, layers):
  //Adjust volume, tempo, effects based on emotion
  //Example: if emotion.arousal is high, increase rhythm volume and tempo
  //Example: if emotion.valence is low, add reverb to melody layer
  adjusted_layers = layers  // placeholder
  return adjusted_layers

function main(audio_input):
  emotion = analyze_audio(audio_input)
  layers = select_media_layers(emotion, user_profile)
  adjusted_layers = adjust_layers(emotion, layers)
  play(adjusted_layers)
```

*   **Hardware Considerations**:  Requires robust noise cancellation in the microphone array to accurately capture emotional cues from speech. Potentially supports integration with wearable sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) for more accurate emotion detection.
