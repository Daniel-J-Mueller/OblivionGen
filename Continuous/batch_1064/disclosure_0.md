## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Interactive Set Extension

**Concept:** Leverage the scene division and cast member data within existing video content to enable dynamic reconstruction of 3D scenes and allow interactive set extension *within* the video itself for AR/VR applications or novel viewing experiences.

**Specs:**

1.  **Scene Mesh Generation:**
    *   Input: Video stream, existing scene division data (from patent), cast member positions per scene.
    *   Process: Utilize Structure from Motion (SfM) or Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms on video frames *within each scene*. Cast member position data acts as anchor points to constrain the 3D reconstruction, improving accuracy and reducing computational cost.  This creates a sparse or dense 3D mesh representing the set.
    *   Output: Per-scene 3D meshes, cast member skeleton data mapped to the mesh.

2.  **Set Extension Module:**
    *   Input: Per-scene 3D mesh, user input (AR/VR device).
    *   Process: Allows users to “step into” the video scene via AR/VR.  The system identifies surfaces within the reconstructed mesh and enables the placement of virtual objects *seamlessly integrated* with the existing set.  Object placement respects perspective and lighting within the original video.
    *   Output:  Augmented/Virtual scene visible to the user, interacting with the original video content.

3.  **Dynamic Content Insertion:**
    *   Input: Per-scene 3D mesh, cast member data, user input.
    *   Process:  The system identifies regions around cast members where virtual characters or objects can be realistically inserted into the scene.  Cast member skeletons guide animation and interaction of the inserted content.  Allows for real-time manipulation of inserted content within the scene.
    *   Output: Video stream with dynamically inserted and interactive content.

4.  **Data Pipeline:**
    *   `VideoInput -> SceneDivision(PatentData) -> SfM/MVS -> 3DMesh(PerScene) -> UserInteraction(AR/VR) -> DynamicContentInsertion -> OutputVideo/AR/VR Scene`

5.  **Pseudocode (Dynamic Content Insertion):**

```pseudocode
function insert_dynamic_content(scene_mesh, cast_member_data, user_input):
    available_space = find_empty_space_around_cast_member(scene_mesh, cast_member_data)
    if available_space:
        new_object = user_input.object_to_insert
        new_object.scale = calculate_realistic_scale(available_space, new_object)
        new_object.position = place_object_in_scene(available_space, new_object)
        new_object.animate_with_cast_member(cast_member_data)
        integrate_object_into_scene(new_object, scene_mesh)
    else:
        display_message("Not enough space to insert object")

function integrate_object_into_scene(object, scene_mesh):
    #apply lighting based on the scene mesh
    #cast shadows based on scene geometry
    #blend object with the video background
```

**Novelty:**  Unlike simple overlay effects, this approach creates a truly 3D environment from existing 2D video content, allowing for interactive exploration and manipulation *within* the original scene. The cast member data acts as crucial anchor points for robust 3D reconstruction and accurate integration of dynamic content. The system is designed to move past 'flat' AR/VR experiences.
