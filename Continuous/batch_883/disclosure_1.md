## Dynamic Schema Projection with Materialized Views

**Concept:** Extend the column reordering capability to encompass *dynamic schema projection* where the presented schema to clients isn't a direct reflection of the underlying storage schema.  This combines column reordering with column *inclusion/exclusion* at request time, underpinned by materialized views that pre-compute common projections.

**Specs:**

1.  **Projection Definition Language (PDL):** A simple language for clients to define the desired schema.  PDL includes column selection (include/exclude) and reordering.  Example: `PROJECT { include: [“name”, “email”], order: [“email”, “name”] }`.
2.  **Materialized View Manager:**
    *   Automatically identifies frequently used PDL projections (based on query logs).
    *   Creates and maintains materialized views for those projections.  These views are essentially pre-computed results with the requested schema.
    *   Materialized views are invalidated/updated based on underlying data changes (using change data capture or similar mechanisms).
3.  **Query Planner Integration:**
    *   When a query arrives with a PDL projection, the query planner checks for a matching materialized view.
    *   If a matching view exists, the query is rewritten to access the view directly, avoiding the need for dynamic reordering.
    *   If no view exists, the system falls back to the existing column reordering mechanism.
4.  **Dynamic View Creation (on-demand):**  If a frequently requested projection *doesn’t* yet have a materialized view, the system can *automatically* create one in the background. This is triggered when a threshold of requests for that specific projection is met.  This process can happen asynchronously to minimize impact on query performance.
5.  **Schema Versioning:** Associate each materialized view with the underlying schema version.  If the base table schema changes, invalidate/recreate views as necessary.

**Pseudocode (Query Planner):**

```
function planQuery(query, projectionDefinition):
  materializedView = findMaterializedView(projectionDefinition)

  if materializedView != null:
    // Rewrite query to access materialized view
    rewrittenQuery = rewriteQuery(query, materializedView)
    return executePlan(rewrittenQuery)
  else:
    // Fallback to dynamic reordering
    reorderedData = reorderColumns(query.data, projectionDefinition.order)
    return executePlan(query) //Execute query on reordered data

function findMaterializedView(projectionDefinition):
  // Search for materialized view matching projectionDefinition
  // (based on included columns and order)
  // Return materialized view if found, otherwise return null
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simple column reordering by allowing clients to define *arbitrary* schema projections.  The materialized view manager optimizes performance for common projections, while the dynamic view creation feature adapts to changing client needs. This improves query responsiveness and reduces the load on the database server. The schema versioning makes sure things don't break during database evolution.
