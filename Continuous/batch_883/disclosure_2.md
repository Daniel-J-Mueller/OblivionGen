## Dynamic Narrative Weaving with AI-Driven "Echo" Tasks

**Concept:** Expand upon the node layout system to create a dynamic, evolving narrative where completed tasks “echo” into future nodes, altering task parameters, introducing new tasks, or even creating entirely new branches in the node layout. This creates a persistent narrative “memory” within the content experience.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Echo Data Structures:**
    *   Each completed task will generate an "Echo" data packet. This packet contains:
        *   Task ID
        *   Completion Timestamp
        *   Player(s) Involved (optional, for multi-player influence)
        *   Key Variable Deltas: Changes to core game variables resulting from the task completion (e.g., Reputation +5, Resource gain -10, NPC Relationship change)
        *   "Influence Radius": A numeric value representing how far this Echo should propagate through the node layout.

2.  **Node Influence Calculation:**
    *   Each node in the layout will have an "Echo Sensitivity" parameter. This defines how receptive the node is to incoming Echoes.
    *   When a task is completed, its Echo is broadcast outwards.
    *   Nodes within the Echo's "Influence Radius" calculate an "Echo Score" based on:
        *   Proximity to the completed task (inverse distance weighting)
        *   Echo Sensitivity
        *   Relevance of Key Variable Deltas to the node’s associated task.

3.  **Dynamic Node Modification:**
    *   Based on the Echo Score, nodes can be modified:
        *   **Parameter Adjustment:** Task parameters (difficulty, rewards, NPC attitudes) are adjusted based on the influence of the Echo.  A positive Echo might increase rewards; a negative Echo might increase difficulty.
        *   **Task Introduction:** If the Echo Score exceeds a threshold, a new, related task is dynamically generated and added to the node layout. The new task's parameters are based on the influencing Echo.
        *   **Branch Creation:** High-scoring Echoes can trigger the creation of entirely new branches in the node layout, representing significant shifts in the narrative.
        *   **Node Locking/Unlocking:** Based on Echo score criteria, nodes can be locked, making them inaccessible, or unlocked, opening up new story avenues.

4.  **"Memory Decay" System:**
    *   Echoes will not persist indefinitely. Implement a "Memory Decay" system where Echo influence gradually diminishes over time.  This prevents the narrative from becoming overly static.
    *   Decay Rate: Adjustable per Echo, based on the significance of the task.

5.  **AI-Driven Echo Generation:**
    *   For nodes with low Echo Sensitivity, implement an AI to analyze completed tasks and *generate* synthetic Echoes, introducing subtle variations and preventing narrative stagnation.
    *   AI Parameters:
        *   Narrative Coherence: Ensures generated Echoes align with the overall story arc.
        *   Surprise Factor: Introduces unexpected twists and turns.

**Pseudocode (Node Influence Calculation):**

```
function calculateEchoScore(node, echo):
  distance = calculateDistance(node, echo.sourceNode)
  if distance > echo.influenceRadius:
    return 0

  sensitivity = node.echoSensitivity
  relevance = calculateRelevance(node.taskVariables, echo.variableDeltas)

  score = sensitivity * relevance * (1 / distance)
  return score
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   RPG games with truly dynamic storylines.
*   Educational content that adapts to student performance.
*   Interactive narrative experiences with emergent storytelling.
*   Simulations where player actions have long-term consequences.
