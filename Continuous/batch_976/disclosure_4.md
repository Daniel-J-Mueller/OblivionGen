## Dynamic Palette Evolution via User Interaction

**Concept:** Expand beyond static image-based palette generation to a system where the user *actively sculpts* the palette over time, driven by aesthetic feedback. This is achieved by linking the palette generation to a continuous stream of visual input (e.g., a video feed, live camera) and weighting color selections based on user 'gaze' or direct interaction.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Input Stream:** Accept a real-time visual input stream (camera, video file, screen capture).

2.  **Initial Palette Generation:**  Employ the core algorithm from the provided patent to generate an initial palette from a keyframe or short segment of the input stream.

3.  **Gaze/Interaction Tracking:** Integrate with eye-tracking hardware *or* mouse/touch input to identify regions of interest within the current frame.  The system must interpret this as 'aesthetic preference'.

    *   **Eye-tracking:**  Record dwell time (seconds) for each color within the gaze area.
    *   **Mouse/Touch:**  Record the number of clicks/taps and duration of interaction with regions containing specific colors.

4.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  For each color in the current palette:

    *   Calculate a 'preference score' based on the gaze/interaction data.  Higher dwell time/interaction frequency = higher score.
    *   Adjust the color weight in the palette based on the preference score.  The weight increase/decrease should be configurable (sensitivity parameter).
    *   Apply a decay factor to prevent the palette from becoming overly biased towards recent input.

5.  **Palette Re-Generation Trigger:**  Implement a trigger mechanism to initiate palette re-generation.  Options:

    *   **Time-based:**  Re-generate the palette every *n* seconds.
    *   **Preference Change:** Re-generate when the sum of all weight changes exceeds a threshold.
    *   **User Request:** Allow the user to manually trigger re-generation.

6. **Color Space Manipulation:**
    * Allow for a user configurable parameter to shift the palette towards analogous, complementary, or triadic schemes.
    * Apply real-time filters during palette generation to skew towards warmer or cooler tones based on user preference.

7.  **Palette Smoothing:**
    * Implement a smoothing algorithm to prevent abrupt changes in the palette. Average weights over a short time window.
    *  Introduce a "momentum" parameter, to favor colors which have consistently high weights.

**Pseudocode (Palette Update Cycle):**

```
// Assuming 'current_palette' is a list of (color, weight) tuples

FOR each frame in input_stream:

    // 1. Gaze/Interaction Tracking
    gaze_data = track_user_gaze(frame)   // Returns list of (color, dwell_time) or (color, interaction_count)

    // 2. Update Color Weights
    FOR each (color, weight) in current_palette:
        preference_score = 0
        IF color in gaze_data:
            preference_score = gaze_data[color]   // Dwell time or interaction count

        weight = weight + (preference_score * weight_sensitivity)
        weight = weight * (1 - weight_decay) // Apply decay

    // 3. Normalize Weights
    total_weight = sum(weight for color, weight in current_palette)
    current_palette = [(color, weight / total_weight) for color, weight in current_palette]

    // 4.  Regeneration trigger
    IF (regeneration_condition_met()):
        current_palette = generate_palette(frame, current_palette) //Use algorithm from patent, using 'current_palette' as a starting point
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard camera or video input
*   (Optional) Eye-tracking hardware

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time mood-based color scheme generation for lighting/ambient systems.
*   Adaptive UI/UX design that responds to user focus.
*   Dynamic color grading for video editing based on viewer attention.
*   Personalized art generation.
