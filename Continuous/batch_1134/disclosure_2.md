## Adaptive Node Granularity for Multi-Dimensional Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the node evaluation system to dynamically adjust node granularity based on observed data distribution and analysis goals. Instead of a fixed node structure, allow the system to recursively subdivide or aggregate nodes based on outlier detection and homogeneity metrics. This enables more nuanced and targeted insights, especially in high-dimensional datasets.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** `Granularity Manager`. This module interacts with the existing node evaluation system and oversees node splitting/merging operations.
*   **Data Input:** Existing node structure, item data within nodes, desired analysis granularity (user-defined or system-determined).
*   **Splitting Criteria:**
    *   **Outlier Density:** If the outlier detection (as per the provided patent) identifies a high concentration of outliers *within a specific region* of a node, trigger a split.
    *   **Variance Threshold:** Calculate the variance of key descriptive terms within a node. If variance exceeds a predefined threshold, trigger a split.
    *   **Dimensionality Reduction Signal:**  If dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE) applied to the nodeâ€™s data reveal distinct clusters, trigger a split along those cluster boundaries.
*   **Merging Criteria:**
    *   **Homogeneity Threshold:** If merging adjacent nodes results in a quality score (as defined in the patent) exceeding a specified threshold, merge the nodes.
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Analyze the correlation between descriptive terms in adjacent nodes. High correlation suggests potential for merging.
*   **Recursion Depth Limit:** Implement a maximum recursion depth to prevent infinite splitting/merging loops.
*   **Granularity Adjustment Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    function adjust_granularity(node, depth):
        if depth > max_depth:
            return node

        evaluate_node(node) // Use existing patent's quality score & outlier detection

        if outlier_density(node) > outlier_threshold OR variance(node) > variance_threshold:
            // Split Node
            split_results = split_node(node)
            for child_node in split_results:
                child_node = adjust_granularity(child_node, depth + 1)

            return split_results

        else:
            // Check for merge opportunities with adjacent nodes
            adjacent_nodes = get_adjacent_nodes(node)
            for adj_node in adjacent_nodes:
                if can_merge(node, adj_node):
                    merge_nodes(node, adj_node)
                    break  // Merge only one adjacent node per iteration

            return node
    ```

*   **Visualization Component:** Develop a visual interface that allows users to explore the dynamically adjusted node structure and understand the splitting/merging decisions.  Show quality scores, outlier densities, and relevant descriptive terms for each node.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `adjust_granularity(node_id, analysis_goal)`: Triggers the granularity adjustment process for a specified node.
    *   `get_node_structure(node_id)`: Returns the current node structure with all splits and merges applied.



This system moves beyond static node evaluation and enables adaptive exploration of complex data landscapes.  By dynamically adjusting granularity, it can reveal hidden patterns and provide more targeted insights than traditional fixed-node approaches.
