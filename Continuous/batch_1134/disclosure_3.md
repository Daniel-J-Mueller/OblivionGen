## Adaptive Endpoint Mirroring for Real-time Data Streams

**Concept:** Extend the idea of specifying multiple endpoints for a response to encompass *ongoing* data streams. Instead of simply receiving a response *to* a request, the server pushes a continuous stream of data to multiple, prioritized endpoints. This creates inherent redundancy and adaptability, and enables dynamic switching of active data receivers based on network conditions or endpoint capabilities.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Stream Initiation:** The API request includes a `stream_id` parameter and a prioritized list of endpoint identifiers (`endpoint_list`). This `stream_id` acts as a key for managing the stream.
*   **Stream Management Module (Server-Side):**
    *   Responsible for establishing and maintaining connections to endpoints in the `endpoint_list` according to priority.
    *   Initially connects to the highest priority endpoint.
    *   Monitors connection health (latency, packet loss, bandwidth) of all connected endpoints.
    *   If the primary connection degrades below a threshold, the module *automatically* switches to the next highest priority endpoint *without* interrupting the data stream.  This switch is transparent to the client.
    *   Supports dynamic addition/removal of endpoints to the `endpoint_list` during an active stream (via a separate API call).
    *   Implements a ‘heartbeat’ mechanism to verify endpoint availability.
*   **Data Serialization:** Data is serialized using a lightweight, efficient format (e.g., Protocol Buffers or MessagePack).
*   **Endpoint Health Metrics:** Health metrics (latency, packet loss, bandwidth) are collected for each endpoint and are exposed via a dedicated API endpoint for monitoring and diagnostics.
*   **Adaptive Bandwidth Control:** The server dynamically adjusts the data rate sent to each endpoint based on its reported bandwidth capacity and connection health.

**Pseudocode (Stream Management Module):**

```
function handle_stream_request(request):
  stream_id = request.stream_id
  endpoint_list = request.endpoint_list
  current_endpoint = endpoint_list[0]  // Start with highest priority

  // Establish initial connection to current_endpoint
  connect_to_endpoint(current_endpoint)

  while stream_is_active(stream_id):
    data = get_next_data_chunk()
    send_data(data, current_endpoint)

    health_metrics = get_endpoint_health(current_endpoint)

    if health_metrics.is_degraded():
      // Attempt to switch to next available endpoint
      next_endpoint = find_next_viable_endpoint(endpoint_list, current_endpoint)
      if next_endpoint:
        disconnect_from_endpoint(current_endpoint)
        connect_to_endpoint(next_endpoint)
        current_endpoint = next_endpoint

    // Implement a retry mechanism for connection failures

function find_next_viable_endpoint(endpoint_list, current_endpoint):
  for endpoint in endpoint_list:
    if endpoint != current_endpoint:
      try:
        // Attempt to establish a connection
        establish_test_connection(endpoint)
        return endpoint
      except ConnectionError:
        pass
  return null // No viable endpoint found
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Real-time Financial Data:** Ensure delivery of critical market data even in the event of network outages or endpoint failures.
*   **IoT Sensor Streams:** Robustly collect data from remote sensors, adapting to varying network conditions and device availability.
*   **Live Video Streaming:**  Dynamically switch to alternative receivers if a primary stream is interrupted, providing a seamless viewing experience.
*   **High-Availability Data Feeds:** Distribute critical data to multiple servers for redundancy and disaster recovery.
