## Dynamic Display Calibration via Multi-Spectral Scanning & AI-Driven Emulation

**System Specs:**

*   **Scanning Module:** High-resolution scanner capable of capturing images across the visible spectrum *and* extending into near-infrared (NIR) and ultraviolet (UV) ranges.  Resolution: 1000 DPI minimum.  Spectral Range: 380nm - 1100nm, in 20nm increments.  Includes polarized light filtering capability.  Scanning method: Linear array movement across display surface, similar to claim 8, but with integrated spectral analysis at each pixel.
*   **Reference Display:**  A standardized, meticulously calibrated display unit. Serves as the 'ground truth' for calibration.  Must match the target display's basic technology (LCD, OLED, etc.) as closely as possible.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance workstation with dedicated GPU. Minimum specifications: Intel i9 processor, NVIDIA RTX 4090, 64GB RAM.  Required software: Custom calibration algorithm (detailed below), AI model training framework (TensorFlow or PyTorch).
*   **AI Model:**  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture trained to map scanned spectral data from the reference display to the target display.  Model parameters: Input layer: Spectral data (RGB + NIR/UV channels).  Output layer: Color correction matrix and gamma curve.  Intermediate layers: Multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction. Training data:  Extensive library of scanned data from a variety of displays.
*   **Emulation Engine:** Real-time image processing pipeline implemented in GPU shaders. Applies the color correction matrix and gamma curve generated by the AI model to incoming video signals.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Integrated photometer system that measures the color and luminance of the calibrated display.  Data is fed back into the AI model to refine the calibration.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond simple defect detection (as implied in the patent claims) towards *dynamic* display calibration. The core idea is to use multi-spectral scanning and AI to create a detailed 'spectral fingerprint' of a reference display, and then *emulate* that fingerprint on a target display. 

Here's the workflow:

1.  **Reference Scan:** The reference display is scanned across the entire spectrum (visible, NIR, UV) to capture its spectral reflectance/emittance characteristics at every pixel. This data forms the 'ground truth'.
2.  **Target Scan:** The target display is scanned similarly.
3.  **AI Training:** The AI model is trained to map the spectral data from the reference display to the target display. The model learns the subtle differences in spectral response between the two displays.
4.  **Calibration Profile Generation:** The trained AI model generates a calibration profile: a color correction matrix and gamma curve that, when applied to the target display, will make it appear visually identical to the reference display.
5.  **Real-time Emulation:** The emulation engine applies the calibration profile to the incoming video signal in real-time.
6.  **Feedback & Refinement:** The photometer continuously measures the color and luminance of the calibrated display. This data is fed back into the AI model to refine the calibration profile over time, compensating for display drift and aging.

**Pseudocode (Calibration Profile Generation):**

```python
# Input: Reference Spectral Data (R_spec), Target Spectral Data (T_spec)
# Output: Color Correction Matrix (CCM), Gamma Curve (GC)

# 1. Feature Extraction (using CNN)
features_ref = CNN(R_spec)
features_target = CNN(T_spec)

# 2. Regression (mapping features to calibration parameters)
CCM, GC = RegressionModel(features_ref, features_target)

# 3. Validation (using validation dataset)
validation_error = Evaluate(validation_dataset, CCM, GC)

# 4. Optimization (adjusting model parameters to minimize error)
optimized_CCM, optimized_GC = Optimizer(validation_error)

return optimized_CCM, optimized_GC
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Professional color grading and editing
*   Medical imaging diagnostics (ensuring accurate color representation)
*   Virtual and augmented reality displays (creating immersive visual experiences)
*   Manufacturing quality control (detecting subtle color variations)
