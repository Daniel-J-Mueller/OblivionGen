## Temporal Relationship Graph with Predictive Edge Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the inconsistent cycle detection and pruning to incorporate a *temporal* dimension. Instead of static edge weights based purely on initial text analysis, dynamically adjust weights based on the *recency* and *frequency* of relationships appearing in subsequent text collections.  Introduce a predictive component: if a cycle is detected, *predict* the likelihood of the relationship remaining valid in future text, and prune accordingly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Temporal Tagging:**

*   Each text collection is tagged with a timestamp (or ordinal collection number representing its sequence).
*   The system maintains a sliding window of *N* recent text collections.  *N* is a configurable parameter.

**2. Enhanced Graph Generation:**

*   Nodes represent named entities as before.
*   Edges initially receive weights based on the original probability/confidence level as outlined in the provided patent.
*   A “last seen” timestamp is stored for each edge.
*   A “frequency” counter is initiated for each edge.

**3. Dynamic Edge Weight Adjustment:**

*   Whenever a new text collection is processed:
    *   Increment the “frequency” counter for edges representing relationships present in the collection.
    *   Update the “last seen” timestamp for those edges.
    *   Calculate a *temporal decay factor* based on the time elapsed since the “last seen” timestamp and the current timestamp.  The decay function should prioritize more recent relationships.  Example: `decay = exp(-lambda * (current_time - last_seen_time))`, where `lambda` is a configurable decay rate.
    *   Apply the temporal decay factor to the existing edge weight. This attenuates the weight of older relationships.

**4. Predictive Inconsistent Cycle Detection & Pruning:**

*   When an inconsistent cycle is detected:
    *   Instead of immediate pruning, calculate a *predicted weight* for each edge within the cycle. This prediction considers:
        *   The current edge weight.
        *   The temporal decay factor applied to the edge weight, projected forward a defined *prediction horizon* (configurable).
        *   A statistical model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model) trained on historical relationship data to predict the probability of the relationship *persisting* beyond the prediction horizon. This model would consider the edge's frequency and recent trend.
    *   Prune edges based on this *predicted weight*, using a configurable threshold.  Edges with the lowest predicted weights are pruned.

**5.  Edge Retention/Restoration Mechanism:**

*   If an edge is pruned and a significant amount of new evidence supporting the relationship appears in subsequent text collections, an algorithm should be able to restore the edge with a recalculated weight.
*   Introduce a "revival threshold" - an edge is restored only if its recalculated weight exceeds this threshold.

**Pseudocode (Pruning Logic):**

```
function prune_cycle(cycle, prediction_horizon):
  for edge in cycle:
    predicted_weight = edge.weight * exp(-lambda * prediction_horizon)
    predicted_weight = predicted_weight * persistence_probability(edge) // From HMM or other predictive model
  sorted_edges = sort(cycle, key=predicted_weight)
  for edge in sorted_edges:
    if edge.predicted_weight < pruning_threshold:
      remove_edge(edge)
      break //Prune only the lowest weight edge per cycle iteration

function persistence_probability(edge):
  // Access historical data via trained model (HMM, etc)
  // Return probability of the relationship persisting
  return model.predict(edge.entity1, edge.entity2)
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   *N* (Sliding window size)
*   *lambda* (Temporal decay rate)
*   *prediction_horizon* (Time horizon for prediction)
*   *pruning_threshold* (Minimum predicted weight for edge retention)
*   Revival threshold (Minimum weight to restore pruned edge).
