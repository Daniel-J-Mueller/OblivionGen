## Dynamic Data Component Stitching for Multi-Tenant Environments

**Concept:** Extend the existing idea of predefined data model component identifiers to enable *dynamic* component stitching within multi-tenant systems, creating highly personalized and context-aware views *without* duplicating data or code.

**Specification:**

**1. Component Registry & Metadata:**

*   **Data Structure:** A central "Component Registry" that stores metadata about each available data component. This metadata includes:
    *   `componentID`: Unique identifier (string).
    *   `dataType`: Data type of the component (e.g., string, integer, date, complex object).
    *   `dataSource`: Identifier for the data source (database, API endpoint, etc.).
    *   `tenantAccess`: List of tenants authorized to access this component.
    *   `renderingProfile`:  List of supported rendering profiles (see section 3).
    *   `dependencies`: List of other `componentID`s required for proper rendering.
    *   `securityLevel`:  Indicates the sensitivity of the data.
*   **API:** Registry API for adding, updating, and querying components.

**2. View Definition Language (VDL) Extension:**

*   **Stitching Directives:** Introduce new directives within the VDL to define how components are dynamically stitched together. Examples:
    *   `<stitch componentID="X" slot="Y" transform="Z">`: Inserts component `X` into slot `Y` within the view. `transform` specifies a transformation function (see section 4).
    *   `<conditional stitch="X" condition="A">`:  Only stitches component `X` if condition `A` is true.
    *   `<repeat stitch="X" collection="Y">`:  Repeats the stitching of component `X` for each item in collection `Y`.
*   **Slot Definitions:** Views define "slots" – placeholders where dynamic components can be inserted.  Slots have associated data types and constraints.

**3. Rendering Profiles:**

*   **Definition:** Rendering profiles define how a component is displayed based on the user’s device, location, preferences, and tenant.
*   **Profiles:** Example profiles include: “Mobile-Dark”, “Desktop-Light”, “Accessibility-HighContrast”, “Location-US”.
*   **Profile Selection:**  The system automatically selects the appropriate profile based on context. The VDL allows overriding the default profile.

**4. Transformation Functions:**

*   **Purpose:**  Transformation functions adapt data from one component to fit the requirements of another, or to format it for display.
*   **Implementation:** Functions are written in a secure scripting language (e.g., Lua, Javascript with sandboxing).
*   **Examples:**
    *   `formatDate(date, format)`: Formats a date according to the specified format.
    *   `convertCurrency(amount, fromCurrency, toCurrency)`: Converts currency.
    *   `truncateString(string, maxLength)`: Truncates a string.
    *   `applyTheme(data, theme)`: Applies a theme to the data.

**5.  System Architecture:**

*   **View Composer Service:** A central service responsible for composing views based on the VDL, Component Registry, and user context.
*   **Data Fetching Service:**  Fetches data from various data sources based on component definitions.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Renders the final view for presentation.

**Pseudocode – View Composer Service:**

```
function composeView(viewSpecification, userContext, tenantID) {
  viewDefinition = parseViewSpecification(viewSpecification)
  componentInstances = []

  for each stitchDirective in viewDefinition.stitchDirectives {
    componentID = stitchDirective.componentID
    componentDefinition = getComponentDefinition(componentID, tenantID)

    if (componentDefinition == null) {
      // Handle missing component (e.g., log error, display placeholder)
      continue
    }

    data = fetchData(componentDefinition.dataSource)

    // Apply transformation function
    transformedData = applyTransformation(data, stitchDirective.transform)

    componentInstance = createComponentInstance(transformedData, componentDefinition)
    componentInstances.push(componentInstance)
  }

  // Combine component instances into a final view
  finalView = renderView(componentInstances, viewDefinition)
  return finalView
}
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond static component mapping to a dynamic, context-aware system. The emphasis on transformation functions and rendering profiles enables highly personalized views without requiring code duplication. The architecture is well-suited for multi-tenant environments, providing flexibility and scalability. It also introduces a level of abstraction that simplifies view development and maintenance.
