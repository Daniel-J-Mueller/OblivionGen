## Adaptive Network ‘Shadowing’ with Predictive Loss Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the packet loss probability estimation beyond simple path calculation to create a dynamic ‘shadow’ network model. This model doesn't represent physical infrastructure but a statistically derived representation of likely network behavior, allowing for *proactive* mitigation rather than reactive adaptation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Network Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time packet transmission/loss data from network nodes (as in the provided patent). Topological information of the physical network. Historical network performance data (stored in a time-series database).
*   **Process:**
    *   Construct a probabilistic graph representing the network. Node weights represent node reliability (based on historical and real-time data). Edge weights represent link reliability.
    *   Employ a Monte Carlo simulation to generate multiple ‘shadow networks’ representing possible network states. Each simulation models packet transmission across the network, factoring in node and link reliability.
    *   Run simulations for a pre-defined duration, generating a statistical distribution of end-to-end packet loss probabilities for all source-destination pairs.
*   **Output:** A dynamic database of probabilistic network states and associated packet loss distributions. This represents the 'shadow' network.

**2. Predictive Loss Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Source-destination pair, current network state (from the Shadow Network Generation Module), traffic characteristics (bandwidth, packet size, priority).
*   **Process:**
    *   Query the Shadow Network database for the most likely network states affecting the source-destination pair.
    *   Based on the queried states and traffic characteristics, predict the probability of packet loss *before* transmission begins.
    *   Calculate the expected throughput for the connection based on the predicted loss.
*   **Output:** Predicted packet loss probability, expected throughput.

**3. Proactive Mitigation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted packet loss probability, expected throughput, application requirements (latency sensitivity, bandwidth requirements).
*   **Process:**
    *   If predicted loss exceeds a threshold, *proactively* implement mitigation strategies:
        *   **Path Diversification:** Pre-calculate alternative paths and select the least lossy path *before* the first packet is sent.
        *   **Forward Error Correction (FEC) Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust FEC coding rates based on predicted loss. Higher loss = more redundancy.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Reduce transmission rate to stay within acceptable loss thresholds.
        *   **Packet Prioritization:** Prioritize critical packets based on application requirements.
    *   Implement mitigation strategies via network device configuration (e.g., using SDN controllers).
*   **Output:** Configured network devices, optimized for minimal packet loss.

**Pseudocode (Mitigation Engine):**

```
function mitigate_loss(predicted_loss, throughput, requirements):
  if predicted_loss > loss_threshold:
    best_path = find_least_lossy_path()
    configure_path(best_path)

    if throughput < min_throughput:
      fec_rate = calculate_fec_rate(throughput)
      configure_fec(fec_rate)
    else:
      configure_fec(default_fec_rate)

    if latency_sensitive:
      prioritize_packets(critical_packets)
  else:
    configure_default_settings()
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shadow Network Database:** Time-series database storing network state probabilities.
*   **Path Graph:** Representation of the network topology, with weighted edges representing link reliability.
*   **Traffic Profile:** Data structure storing traffic characteristics (bandwidth, packet size, priority).

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond *reacting* to packet loss to *predicting* and *preventing* it. The 'shadow network' creates a virtual representation of network behavior, enabling proactive mitigation strategies. It introduces a probabilistic layer to network optimization, improving reliability and performance.
