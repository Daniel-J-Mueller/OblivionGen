## Adaptive Spatial Audio Personalization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback data (e.g., EEG, heart rate variability) into the spatial audio processing pipeline to dynamically adjust the perceived soundscape and optimize listener engagement/cognitive performance.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Bio-Signal Acquisition:**
    *   Utilize non-invasive sensors (EEG headset, wearable heart rate monitor) to capture real-time physiological data from the listener.
    *   Data sampling rate: EEG (minimum 250Hz), HRV (minimum 100Hz).
    *   Wireless communication protocol: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for seamless integration.

2.  **Feature Extraction & Mapping:**
    *   **EEG:** Extract relevant features from EEG data including:
        *   Alpha/Theta band power (reflecting relaxation/focus)
        *   Event-Related Potential (ERP) components (P300 for attention detection).
    *   **HRV:** Calculate Time-Domain (RMSSD, SDNN) and Frequency-Domain (LF/HF ratio) metrics.
    *   **Mapping Function:** Develop a machine learning model (e.g., neural network, support vector regression) to map bio-signal features to spatial audio parameters.  Parameters include:
        *   Interaural Level Difference (ILD) – affects sound localization
        *   Interaural Time Difference (ITD) – affects sound localization
        *   Reverberation – simulates acoustic environment
        *   Sound source width/distance – modulates perceived spaciousness
        *   Dynamic range compression – adjust amplitude based on focus.

3.  **Spatial Audio Processing Engine:**
    *   Implement a binaural audio rendering engine to synthesize 3D soundscapes.
    *   Utilize Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) customized to the individual listener (collected via HRTF measurement or generated via morphing from a database).
    *   Integrate the mapping function output to dynamically adjust the HRTFs and/or the spatial parameters of individual sound sources in the scene.

4.  **Adaptive Algorithm:**
    *   Implement a closed-loop control system.
    *   Define target bio-signal ranges for optimal listener state (e.g., focused attention, relaxed awareness).
    *   Continuously monitor bio-signal data.
    *   Adjust spatial audio parameters based on the difference between current and target bio-signal values.
    *   Employ an adaptive learning rate to optimize the mapping function over time.
    *   Implement safeguards to prevent excessive or jarring changes to the soundscape.

5.  **System Architecture**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Acquire Bio-Signals
    bioSignals = acquireBioSignals(); // EEG, HRV, etc.

    // 2. Extract Features
    features = extractFeatures(bioSignals); // Alpha/Theta power, RMSSD, etc.

    // 3. Map Features to Spatial Audio Parameters
    spatialParams = mappingFunction(features); // ILD, ITD, reverb, etc.

    // 4. Render 3D Soundscape
    soundscape = renderSoundscape(spatialParams, soundSources);

    // 5. Play Soundscape
    playSoundscape(soundscape);

    // 6. Monitor Performance & Adjust Mapping Function (Adaptive Learning)
    performance = evaluatePerformance(features, targetState);
    mappingFunction = adjustMappingFunction(mappingFunction, performance, learningRate);
}
```

6.  **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   EEG Headset (e.g., Muse 2, Emotiv EPOC X)
    *   Wearable Heart Rate Monitor (e.g., Polar H10)
    *   High-performance computing device (PC, embedded system)
    *   Headphones with accurate binaural reproduction capabilities

7.  **Potential Applications:**
    *   Enhanced gaming and VR/AR experiences
    *   Personalized music therapy
    *   Cognitive training and stress reduction
    *   Accessibility for individuals with sensory processing disorders.
    *   Optimizing focus during work/study.
