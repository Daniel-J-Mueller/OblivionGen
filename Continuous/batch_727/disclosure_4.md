## Adaptive Request Shadowing & Policy Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the policy evaluation system to proactively "shadow" requests as they propagate through multiple services, building a dynamic request lineage and applying/refining policies *at each step* of the chain, rather than solely at the final processing service. This anticipates potential policy violations *before* they occur, enabling more granular access control and pre-emptive mitigation.

**Specs:**

**1. Request Shadowing Component:**

*   **Interface:**  Receives a copy of all inter-service requests (via a sidecar proxy or similar mechanism).
*   **Data Structure:** Maintains a "Request Shadow" – a linked list or graph representing the request's journey. Each node contains:
    *   Request metadata (timestamp, originating user, request type).
    *   Service ID (the service handling the request).
    *   Policy evaluation results (detailed assessment of compliance).
    *   Lineage information (the service that initiated the request).
*   **Operation:**  As a request passes through each service:
    *   The Request Shadowing Component intercepts the request.
    *   It updates the Request Shadow with the current service ID and timestamp.
    *   It triggers a policy evaluation (see Policy Evaluation Engine – updated).
    *   It propagates the updated Request Shadow to the next service in the chain.

**2. Policy Evaluation Engine – Updated:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Request Shadow (complete lineage information).
    *   User profile.
    *   Global policy database.
*   **Operation:**
    *   **Dynamic Policy Generation:**  Based on the Request Shadow, the engine can dynamically generate *context-aware* policies. For example: "If a request originated from User X, passed through Service A, and now at Service B, only allow access to resource Y."
    *   **Policy Refinement:**  The engine can *refine* existing policies based on the request's lineage. This allows policies to be more specific and granular.
    *   **Pre-emptive Mitigation:**  If a policy violation is detected, the engine can trigger pre-emptive mitigation actions, such as:
        *   Request modification.
        *   Request blocking.
        *   Auditing and logging.
        *   Alerting.

**3. Inter-Service Communication Protocol Update:**

*   **Augment Request Headers:** Add a header field to carry a condensed, cryptographically signed version of the Request Shadow. This ensures that the receiving service can verify the authenticity and integrity of the lineage information.
*   **Shadow Propagation Mechanism:**  Define a standardized way for services to propagate the Shadow (or a pointer to it) to downstream services.

**Pseudocode (Policy Evaluation Engine):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(request, requestShadow, userProfile, globalPolicies):
  // 1. Build Context
  context = {
    request: request,
    requestShadow: requestShadow,
    userProfile: userProfile
  }

  // 2. Identify Applicable Policies
  applicablePolicies = findPolicies(context, globalPolicies)

  // 3. Dynamic Policy Generation (based on Request Shadow)
  dynamicPolicies = generateDynamicPolicies(requestShadow)
  applicablePolicies.append(dynamicPolicies)

  // 4. Policy Evaluation
  evaluationResults = evaluatePolicies(applicablePolicies, context)

  // 5. Mitigation (if applicable)
  if any(result.violation in evaluationResults):
    mitigationAction = determineMitigationAction(evaluationResults)
    applyMitigationAction(mitigationAction, request)

  return evaluationResults
```

**Innovation Rationale:** The original patent focuses on evaluating policies at the *end* of the request chain. This adaptation shifts the evaluation *throughout* the chain, providing more proactive and granular control. The dynamic policy generation capability allows the system to adapt to changing conditions and user behavior.  This is a preemptive measure, designed to reduce risk, and to increase trust within the system.
