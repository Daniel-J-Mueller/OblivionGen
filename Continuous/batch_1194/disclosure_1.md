## Dynamic Asset Synthesis for A/B Testing

**Concept:** Extend the similarity-based asset reduction to *create* new assets dynamically, instead of simply reducing the existing set. Leverage generative AI to synthesize variations of existing assets based on similarity metrics, then use those variations in A/B testing within the user interface experiment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Asset Vector Database:**

*   Maintain a vector database of all existing item assets (images, text, features).
*   Each asset is represented by a high-dimensional vector embedding generated by a pre-trained model (e.g., CLIP, BERT).

**2. Synthesis Engine:**

*   Implement a generative AI model (e.g., GAN, Diffusion Model) capable of creating new asset variations. The model should be trained on the existing asset data.
*   The synthesis engine accepts a source asset vector and a "divergence factor" as input.
*   The divergence factor controls the degree of variation from the source asset. A higher factor results in more significant changes.
*   The engine generates a new asset vector. This new vector is projected into the existing embedding space.
*   The generated asset is then decoded from the embedding space into a usable format (image, text).

**3. Similarity-Guided Synthesis:**

*   When a user indicates a desire for more variation (e.g., "Show me something different"), the system identifies assets that are *close* in the embedding space to the currently displayed asset.
*   A new asset is synthesized by blending the vector of the current asset with a vector representing an asset that is somewhat dissimilar. The blending is weighted by the divergence factor.
*   The synthesized asset is then displayed to the user.

**4. A/B Testing Framework:**

*   Integrate an A/B testing framework within the user interface experiment.
*   The framework automatically presents variations of assets to different user groups.
*   User interaction (clicks, views, conversions) is tracked for each variation.
*   The system identifies the most effective asset variations based on the user data.

**5. User Interface:**

*   Provide a "Variation Slider" that allows the user to control the degree of variation from the original asset.
*   Display a heatmap of asset similarity, highlighting clusters of similar assets.
*   Allow the user to “seed” the synthesis engine with a specific asset or keyword.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function synthesize_asset(source_asset_vector, divergence_factor, seed_asset_vector):
  # Calculate the difference vector between the seed and source
  difference_vector = seed_asset_vector - source_asset_vector
  # Apply the divergence factor
  weighted_difference = divergence_factor * difference_vector
  # Generate a new vector
  new_vector = source_asset_vector + weighted_difference
  # Decode the vector to a usable format
  new_asset = decode_vector(new_vector)
  return new_asset

function run_experiment(asset_set, user_group):
  for asset in asset_set:
    # Generate a slight variation on the asset
    variation = synthesize_asset(asset, divergence_factor, seed_asset)
    # Present the variation to a segment of the user group
    present_asset(variation, user_segment)
    # Track user interactions
    track_interactions(variation, user_segment)

function optimize_assets(asset_set, user_data):
  # Analyze user interaction data
  best_assets = analyze_data(user_data)
  # Refine the asset set based on the analysis
  refined_asset_set = refine_set(asset_set, best_assets)
  return refined_asset_set
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPU accelerated computing for generative AI models.
*   Sufficient memory to store large asset embeddings.
*   High-bandwidth network connection for data transfer.
