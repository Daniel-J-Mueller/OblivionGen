## Adaptive Segment Pre-fetching & Prediction

**Concept:** The patent details handling media segments and storage tiers. This inspires a system that *predicts* segment access *before* it happens, pre-fetching segments to the fastest storage tier *based on viewing patterns and content analysis*, and dynamically adjusting pre-fetch depth.

**Specs:**

**1. Segment Access Prediction Engine:**

   *   **Input:**
        *   Real-time user viewing data (timestamps, segments requested, playback rate).
        *   Content metadata (scene changes, action sequences, audio cues – extracted via automated analysis).
        *   Historical viewing data (aggregate patterns for similar content).
        *   Network conditions (bandwidth, latency).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on the input data.
        *   The LSTM predicts the *probability* of each segment being requested in the next 'n' seconds.  'n' is dynamically adjusted based on network conditions – lower bandwidth, higher 'n'.
        *   Content analysis data weights the LSTM predictions.  For example, a fast-action scene increases the probability of consecutive segment requests.
   *   **Output:** A prioritized list of segments, with associated probability scores.

**2. Adaptive Pre-fetch Manager:**

   *   **Input:** Prioritized segment list from the Prediction Engine, current storage tier availability (fast/slow), network bandwidth.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Maintain a "pre-fetch buffer" in the fastest storage tier.
        *   Segments exceeding a probability threshold are pre-fetched into the buffer.
        *   Dynamically adjust the buffer size and pre-fetch depth (number of segments to pre-fetch) based on:
            *   Prediction confidence (higher confidence = larger depth).
            *   Network bandwidth (lower bandwidth = smaller depth).
            *   Storage tier availability (limited fast storage = smaller depth).
        *   Implement a Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for the buffer.
   *   **Output:** Instructions to move segments between storage tiers.

**3. Content Analysis Module:**

   *   **Input:** Media file.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Video analysis: Scene detection, motion vector analysis (detects fast action), object detection (identifies key elements).
        *   Audio analysis: Music genre detection, sound event detection (explosions, dialogue).
        *   Generate a "content profile" – a vector representing the content's characteristics.
   *   **Output:** Content profile.

**4. System Architecture:**

   *   The Prediction Engine, Adaptive Pre-fetch Manager, and Content Analysis Module operate as microservices.
   *   Communication between microservices via REST APIs or message queues.
   *   Integration with existing CDN and storage infrastructure.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Pre-fetch Manager):**

```
function prefetch_segments(predicted_segments, bandwidth, fast_storage_available):
  buffer_size = calculate_buffer_size(bandwidth, fast_storage_available)
  
  for segment in predicted_segments:
    if segment not in buffer and len(buffer) < buffer_size:
      move_segment_to_fast_storage(segment)
      buffer.add(segment)
    else:
      #Segment already in buffer or buffer full
      pass

  #Evict segments using LRU
  if len(buffer) > buffer_size:
    evict_lru_segment()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced buffering and improved playback quality.
*   Lower latency and faster start-up times.
*   Optimized storage usage and cost savings.
*   Adaptive behavior to changing network conditions and user preferences.
