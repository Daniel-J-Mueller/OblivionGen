## Dynamic Voltage Allocation with Wireless Power Transfer

**Concept:** Integrate wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities into the power distribution system, coupled with dynamic voltage allocation based on real-time server load and efficiency metrics. This allows for localized power delivery, reduced cabling, and optimized voltage levels for individual server components.

**Specs:**

*   **WPT Transmitter Integration:** Replace or augment existing PDU output stages with WPT transmitter coils. These coils are strategically placed within server racks, aligned with receiver coils integrated into server components (motherboards, GPUs, SSDs).
*   **Receiver Coil Design:** Design receiver coils optimized for high efficiency and minimal interference. Utilize resonant inductive coupling for extended range and power transfer.  Receiver coils will be modular and adaptable to various server component form factors.
*   **Dynamic Voltage Regulation (DVR) Module:** Implement a DVR module within each server. This module receives power from both the traditional PDU connections *and* the WPT receiver. It intelligently blends these power sources based on real-time demand and efficiency.
*   **Load & Efficiency Monitoring:** Each server's DVR module continuously monitors component load (CPU, GPU, RAM) and efficiency metrics (voltage, current, temperature). Data is transmitted to a central management system.
*   **Central Management System:**  A centralized system receives data from all servers and dynamically adjusts both the PDU output voltage and the WPT power levels. Algorithms prioritize minimizing total energy consumption and maximizing system reliability.
*   **Voltage Levels:** Support a wide range of operating voltages (e.g., 12V, 5V, 3.3V) via DC-DC converters within the DVR module.  Allow for dynamic adjustment of voltage within specified limits based on component load and efficiency.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Utilize a secure, low-latency communication protocol (e.g., 5G, Wi-Fi 6E) for data exchange between servers, PDUs, and the central management system.
*   **Failover Mechanism:** Implement a redundant power delivery system. If WPT fails, the server seamlessly switches to traditional PDU power. If PDU fails, WPT attempts to supply power (assuming sufficient capacity).
*   **Power Budgeting:** The central management system maintains a power budget for each rack and the entire data center. It dynamically allocates power based on server demand and available capacity.

**Pseudocode (Central Management System):**

```
// Variables
powerBudgetTotal = Total Data Center Power Capacity
rackPowerBudgets = Array of Power Budgets per Rack
serverData = Array of Server Load/Efficiency Data

// Function: Update Power Allocation
function UpdatePowerAllocation() {
  for each rack in rackPowerBudgets {
    for each server in rack.servers {
      //Get current server load and efficiency from serverData
      serverLoad = serverData[server].load
      serverEfficiency = serverData[server].efficiency

      //Calculate ideal power consumption for server
      idealPower = serverLoad / serverEfficiency

      //Adjust PDU Output Voltage
      AdjustPDUOutput(server, idealPower)

      //Adjust WPT Power Level
      AdjustWPTPowerLevel(server, idealPower)
    }
  }
}

//Function: AdjustPDUOutput
function AdjustPDUOutput(server, power) {
    //Logic to adjust PDU output voltage for server based on calculated power requirement
    //Consider temperature, current draw and efficiency
}

//Function: AdjustWPTPowerLevel
function AdjustWPTPowerLevel(server, power) {
    //Logic to adjust WPT output level for server based on calculated power requirement
    //Balance power delivery between PDU and WPT for optimal efficiency
}

//Run UpdatePowerAllocation() periodically
setInterval(UpdatePowerAllocation, 500); //Update every 500ms
```
