## Dynamic Inventory ‘Swarm’ – Predictive Repositioning & Task Allocation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple storage location optimization to create a dynamic ‘swarm’ of inventory holders, proactively repositioned based on *predicted* multi-step task sequences, and allocated to tasks via a decentralized, auction-based system.

**Specs:**

*   **Inventory Holder Augmentation:** Each inventory holder (IH) equipped with:
    *   Short-range (UWB/Bluetooth) beacon for precise location tracking.
    *   Low-power processing unit.
    *   Wireless communication module.
    *   Small display (e-ink or similar) for visual task ID.
*   **Mobile Drive Unit (MDU) Network:** Expand MDU fleet beyond simple transport. Each MDU capable of:
    *   Cooperative tasking – multiple MDUs working together on a single IH move.
    *   Dynamic route planning – avoiding congestion and prioritizing critical moves.
    *   ‘IH Acceptance’ – MDUs ‘bid’ on accepting IH transport requests based on current location, workload, and energy levels.
*   **Predictive Task Sequencing Engine:** AI module analyzing:
    *   Historical task data.
    *   Current order streams.
    *   Supply chain forecasts.
    *   To predict *future* task sequences – e.g., not just ‘pick item X’, but ‘pick item X, then pack, then stage for shipping’.
*   **Decentralized Task Allocation (Auction System):**
    1.  Predictive engine identifies a multi-step task sequence.
    2.  System broadcasts ‘task request’ – includes sequence ID, priority, estimated completion time, and ‘reward’ (energy credit for MDU).
    3.  MDUs ‘bid’ based on current location/workload/energy.
    4.  Lowest-bidder (or combination of MDUs) accepts the task.
    5.  System dynamically assigns IHs to MDUs based on sequence steps.
*   **‘Swarm’ Repositioning:**
    *   Based on predicted task sequences, system proactively repositions IHs *before* they are needed.
    *   IHs ‘drift’ through the system, optimizing for future tasks, rather than simply reacting to current requests.
    *   Utilize a ‘potential energy’ map – IHs ‘flow’ towards locations with high predicted task demand.
*   **Energy Credit System:**
    *   MDUs earn energy credits for completing tasks.
    *   Credits used to recharge MDUs.
    *   Incentivizes efficient task completion and proactive task acceptance.

**Pseudocode (Task Allocation):**

```
FUNCTION AllocateTask(TaskSequence, Priority):
  // Broadcast task request to MDU network
  Broadcast(TaskSequence, Priority)

  // Collect bids from MDUs
  Bids = CollectBids()

  // Select lowest bidder (or combination of bidders)
  SelectedMDUs = SelectMDUs(Bids)

  // Assign IHs to SelectedMDUs based on TaskSequence steps
  FOR EACH Step IN TaskSequence:
    IH = FindNearestIH(Step.ItemID)
    AssignIH(IH, SelectedMDUs, Step)

  // Update MDU workload and energy levels
  UpdateMDUStatus(SelectedMDUs)

  RETURN Success
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION FindNearestIH(ItemID):
  // Query location tracking system for all IHs
  IHs = QueryIHLocations()

  // Filter for IHs containing ItemID
  FilteredIHs = FilterIHs(IHs, ItemID)

  // Calculate distance from each IH to current MDU location
  Distances = CalculateDistances(FilteredIHs)

  // Return closest IH
  RETURN ClosestIH
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple storage optimization and task allocation to a *proactive*, decentralized ‘swarm’ intelligence approach. By predicting multi-step task sequences and proactively repositioning inventory holders, it aims to significantly reduce bottlenecks, increase throughput, and improve overall system efficiency. The auction-based task allocation and energy credit system add another layer of intelligence and adaptability.
