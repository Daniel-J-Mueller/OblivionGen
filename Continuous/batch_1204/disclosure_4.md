## Dynamic Hardware Partitioning based on Trust Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the trust-group concept beyond compute instances/programs to *hardware* – dynamically partitioning physical processor cores based on trust levels, rather than solely relying on thread allocation within a core. This aims for stronger isolation and mitigates shared resource attacks *at the hardware level*.

**Specification:**

1.  **Hardware Monitoring Agent (HMA):** A low-level agent embedded in the processor/chipset that monitors core activity (cache usage, branch prediction, memory access patterns) and generates a 'trust score' for each currently executing thread. This score isn’t binary (trusted/untrusted) but a continuous value reflecting the observed behavior.

2.  **Trust Propagation Network (TPN):**  A communication infrastructure (e.g., utilizing existing on-chip interconnects) that allows HMAs to exchange trust scores. This creates a localized trust map across the available cores.  Trust isn’t simply propagated upwards; it’s *averaged* and *weighted* based on the relationship between the originating thread and the destination core.

3.  **Dynamic Core Partitioning (DCP):** A hypervisor/firmware component that receives the trust map from the TPN.  It then dynamically reconfigures the physical cores, creating "trust domains".  This isn’t a simple virtual machine isolation; it's a *physical* separation.  

    *   **Partitioning Granularity:** Cores are divided into smaller, configurable partitions (e.g., using physical memory controllers to restrict access, remapping cache lines).
    *   **Partition Assignment:** High-trust threads are assigned to dedicated partitions, isolating them from potentially malicious low-trust threads.
    *   **Partition Size:** Partition size is dynamically adjusted based on thread workload and trust score – ensuring efficient resource utilization while maintaining isolation.

4.  **Hardware-Enforced Isolation:** Utilize processor features (e.g., memory encryption, access control lists) to enforce the partition boundaries.  Attempts to access resources outside a partition trigger hardware exceptions.

**Pseudocode (DCP component):**

```
// Input: Trust Map (Core -> Thread -> Trust Score)
//        Workload Map (Thread -> Resource Demand)

function dynamicCorePartitioning(trustMap, workloadMap) {
  // 1. Calculate aggregate trust score for each core
  coreTrustScores = {}
  for each (core in trustMap) {
    coreTrustScore = 0
    for each (thread in trustMap[core]) {
      coreTrustScore += trustMap[core][thread]
    }
    coreTrustScores[core] = coreTrustScore
  }

  // 2. Determine optimal partition configuration
  partitions = {}
  for each (core in coreTrustScores) {
    if (coreTrustScores[core] > TRUST_THRESHOLD) {
      // High-trust core: Dedicate the entire core to trusted threads
      partitions[core] = TRUSTED
    } else {
      // Low-trust core: Divide into partitions based on workload
      partitionSize = calculatePartitionSize(workloadMap, core)
      partitions[core] = UNTRUSTED_PARTITIONED(partitionSize)
    }
  }

  // 3. Remap threads to partitions
  for each (thread in allThreads) {
    if (thread.trustLevel > THRESHOLD) {
      // Assign to trusted partition
      assignThreadToPartition(thread, findTrustedPartition())
    } else {
      // Assign to untrusted partition
      assignThreadToPartition(thread, findUntrustedPartition())
    }
  }

  // 4. Enforce partition boundaries (hardware assisted)
  enforcePartitionBoundaries()
}
```
