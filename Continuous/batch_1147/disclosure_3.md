## Dynamic Network Persona Creation & Predictive Shaping

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *reacting* to unexpected network activity. This builds on that by proactively creating “Network Personas” – behavioral models of individual users or user groups – and then *predictively shaping* network delivery to optimize their experience *before* activity spikes. It shifts from anomaly detection to personalized network optimization.

**Specs:**

**I. Persona Creation Module:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Real-time network traffic data (bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss).
    *   Application usage data (types of apps, frequency, duration).
    *   Device type and operating system.
    *   Geographic location (coarse-grained).
    *   Time of day/week.
    *   User-defined preferences (if available – e.g., streaming quality settings).
*   **Behavioral Modeling:**
    *   Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) - specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network - to learn temporal patterns in network usage.  The LSTM will predict future bandwidth demands based on historical data.
    *   Cluster users based on similarity of their LSTM-derived behavioral profiles.  This creates "Network Personas" – representative models of user groups.
    *   Each Persona will have a dynamically updated vector representing predicted bandwidth needs over a sliding time window (e.g., 5 minutes).
*   **Persona Storage:** Store Persona data in a key-value store optimized for rapid retrieval (e.g., Redis, Memcached).  The key will be a user ID or device ID.

**II. Predictive Shaping Module:**

*   **Demand Prediction:**
    *   For each active user/device, retrieve the associated Persona.
    *   Use the Persona's predicted bandwidth vector to anticipate future network demands.
*   **Resource Allocation:**
    *   Dynamically adjust Quality of Service (QoS) parameters for each user/device based on predicted demand.
        *   **Bandwidth Prioritization:** Allocate higher bandwidth to users with high predicted demand and low priority to those with low predicted demand.
        *   **Traffic Shaping:** Smooth out traffic bursts by delaying non-critical packets.
        *   **Caching Prefetching:**  Prefetch content likely to be requested by users based on their Persona’s browsing history.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor actual network usage after applying the predictive shaping adjustments.
    *   Compare actual usage to predicted usage.
    *   Use the difference as feedback to retrain the LSTM models in the Persona Creation Module, improving prediction accuracy over time.  Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to optimize the shaping adjustments.

**III. System Architecture:**

*   **Deployment:** Deploy as a microservice within the existing network infrastructure.
*   **API:** Expose a REST API for other network services to query Persona data and request shaping adjustments.
*   **Scalability:** Design for horizontal scalability using a distributed message queue (e.g., Kafka) to handle large volumes of network traffic data.

**Pseudocode (Demand Prediction & Shaping):**

```pseudocode
function predict_and_shape(user_id, current_traffic_data):
  persona = get_persona(user_id)  // Retrieve Persona from storage

  predicted_demand = persona.predict_bandwidth_demand(current_time) // LSTM prediction

  shaping_parameters = calculate_shaping_parameters(predicted_demand, current_traffic_data) // QoS adjustments

  apply_shaping_parameters(user_id, shaping_parameters)

  // Collect actual traffic data for feedback
  record_actual_traffic_data(user_id, current_traffic_data)
```

**Novelty:**  This shifts from reactive anomaly detection to *proactive* network optimization based on learned user behavior. The use of LSTMs and reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust QoS parameters represents a novel approach to network management. It transforms the network into a dynamically self-optimizing system.
