## Adaptive Contextual Audio Layering

**Concept:** Build upon the keyword detection and content delivery aspects of the patent to create a dynamic, layered audio experience *within* existing audio streams – not just appending content *after* detection. This focuses on subtle audio manipulation that augments the user's existing auditory environment based on detected keywords, creating a more immersive and personalized experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Core System - "Aural Weaver"**

*   **Input:** Real-time audio stream (e.g., phone call, music, environmental audio from microphone).
*   **Processing Modules:**
    *   *Keyword Detection Engine:* (Utilizes patent’s trigger/keyword logic) – Detects keywords within the audio stream. Prioritizes based on contextual relevance (see section 3).
    *   *Audio Layer Library:*  A vast database of short, high-quality audio snippets categorized by keyword, emotion, environment, and ‘sonic texture’ (e.g., ‘forest ambiance – gentle breeze’, ‘city soundscape – distant siren’, ‘positive affirmation – uplifting melody’).
    *   *Dynamic Audio Weaver:* The core processing unit. Receives keyword detections and selects appropriate audio layers from the library. Manipulates volume, panning, EQ, and applies subtle spatial audio effects to seamlessly blend the layer with the existing audio.
*   **Output:** Modified audio stream with layered audio elements.

**2. Layering Parameters & Control**

*   **Blending Mode:**  Control how layers interact. Options:
    *   *Additive:* Layer volume added to existing audio.
    *   *Subtractive:* Layer volume reduces certain frequencies in existing audio (useful for creating emphasis or removing noise).
    *   *Harmonic:* Layer adds harmonic richness to existing audio.
*   **Spatialization:** Utilize HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) data to create a 3D soundscape. Layers can be positioned around the user's head for immersive effect.
*   **Dynamic EQ:** Automatically adjust EQ settings of layers based on the frequency content of the existing audio to avoid muddiness or masking.
*   **Contextual Gain:** Adjust layer volume based on the emotional tone of the existing audio. For example, if the user is speaking in a stressed voice, a calming layer would be played at a higher volume.

**3. Contextual Relevance Engine**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   *User Profile:* Demographics, preferences, interests, recent activity.
    *   *Environmental Data:* Location, time of day, weather.
    *   *Audio Analysis:* Sentiment analysis, speech rate, pitch, tone.
    *   *Conversation Context:* (If applicable) - Use NLP to understand the topic of the conversation.
*   **Relevance Scoring:** Assign a score to each keyword based on its relevance to the current context.
*   **Priority Queue:** Maintain a priority queue of keywords based on their relevance scores.

**4. Pseudocode – Dynamic Audio Weaver**

```
function processAudio(audioStream, contextData) {
  keywords = detectKeywords(audioStream);
  relevantKeywords = filterKeywordsByContext(keywords, contextData);
  sortedKeywords = sortKeywordsByRelevance(relevantKeywords);

  for (keyword in sortedKeywords) {
    audioLayer = selectAudioLayer(keyword);
    if (audioLayer != null) {
      volume = calculateVolume(audioLayer, audioStream);
      position = calculateSpatialPosition(audioStream);
      modifiedAudio = blendAudio(audioStream, audioLayer, volume, position);
      audioStream = modifiedAudio;
    }
  }

  return audioStream;
}
```

**5. Application Scenarios**

*   **Enhanced Phone Calls:**  Subtly add ambient sounds related to the topic of conversation (e.g., ocean waves during a vacation planning call).
*   **Immersive Music Listening:**  Add contextual soundscapes that complement the genre or mood of the music (e.g., forest ambiance during a nature documentary soundtrack).
*   **Focus Enhancement:**  Play calming binaural beats or white noise to improve concentration.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide subtle auditory cues to help visually impaired users navigate their surroundings.
