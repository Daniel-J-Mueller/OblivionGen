## Dynamic Initialization Vector Metadata – Content Provenance & Rights Management

**Concept:** Expand the IV metadata beyond content *type* to embed verifiable provenance and rights information directly within the encryption process. This allows for granular access control and royalty tracking at the sample level, leveraging the existing IV framework.

**Specs:**

**1. IV Structure Enhancement:**

*   **Base IV:** Maintain the current structure (Content Type Code, Cryptographic Nonce, Counter).
*   **Provenance Block (16-32 bits):** Append a 'Provenance Block' to the IV. This block will contain:
    *   **Creator ID (8 bits):**  Unique identifier for the content creator/owner.
    *   **Timestamp (8 bits):**  Creation/Encoding timestamp (coarse-grained – e.g., day/hour).
    *   **Rights Flags (8 bits):**  Boolean flags indicating permitted uses (e.g., personal, commercial, derivative works).
*   **Checksum (8 bits):**  CRC8 checksum of the Provenance Block to ensure integrity.
*   **Total IV Length:**  Adjust IV length accordingly (e.g., 64-bit or 128-bit) to accommodate the extended structure.

**2. Encoding Process:**

*   When encoding media, the encoding application populates the Provenance Block with relevant metadata.
*   The application calculates the Checksum and appends it to the IV.
*   Encryption proceeds as normal, using the complete IV for each sample.

**3. Decoding Process:**

*   The decoding application extracts the IV.
*   It verifies the Checksum to ensure the Provenance Block’s integrity.
*   It reads the Creator ID, Timestamp, and Rights Flags.
*   Based on the Rights Flags, the application either:
    *   Permits playback/use of the content.
    *   Restricts playback/use and potentially logs the violation.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Encoding Application:** Modified to populate and manage the Provenance Block.
*   **Decoding Application:** Modified to extract, verify, and interpret the Provenance Block.
*   **Rights Management Server (Optional):**  Could be integrated to dynamically update Rights Flags based on subscription status or licensing agreements.  The decoder could query the server during playback.
*   **Blockchain Integration (Optional):** Creator ID and Timestamp could be registered on a blockchain to create a tamper-proof record of content origin.

**Pseudocode (Decoding Side):**

```
function DecodeSample(encryptedSample, IV, encryptionKey):
    checksum = calculateChecksum(IV[IV.length - 8:]) //Extract Checksum from IV
    if (verifyChecksum(IV[:IV.length-8], checksum)):
        creatorID = extractCreatorID(IV)
        timestamp = extractTimestamp(IV)
        rightsFlags = extractRightsFlags(IV)

        if (rightsFlags.personalUse == true):
            //Allow personal use
            unencryptedSample = decrypt(encryptedSample, IV, encryptionKey)
            return unencryptedSample
        else:
            //Check subscription/license
            if (isValidLicense(creatorID)):
                unencryptedSample = decrypt(encryptedSample, IV, encryptionKey)
                return unencryptedSample
            else:
                //Deny access
                return Error("Access Denied")
    else:
        return Error("IV Tampered With")
```

**Refinements:**

*   Implement a key derivation function that incorporates the Creator ID, making it more difficult to copy/re-distribute encrypted content.
*   Dynamically update the IV with usage data, creating an audit trail of content consumption.
*   Allow for multiple Creator IDs to support collaborative content creation.
