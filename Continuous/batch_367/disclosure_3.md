## Dynamic Predictive Camera Network with Multi-Layered Event Prioritization

**System Overview:** A distributed network of pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) and fixed-position cameras dynamically adjusting their fields of view *before* an event occurs, based on probabilistic event prediction and layered prioritization.  This goes beyond reactive event tracking to proactive scene pre-focus.

**Core Innovation:** The system doesn't just *react* to an identified object or area of interest. It anticipates potential events within a defined area, predicting likely trajectories and focusing camera resources accordingly. This prediction isn't based on identifying *what* will happen, but *where* something is likely to happen.

**Components:**

*   **Sensor Fusion Module:**  Integrates data from various sources: historical event data, environmental sensors (e.g., weather, sound), real-time location data (e.g., foot traffic, vehicle movement), and publicly available event schedules.  This data fuels the prediction engine.
*   **Probabilistic Prediction Engine:** A Bayesian network-based engine generates probability maps indicating areas with increased likelihood of events within specified time horizons (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).  The network learns from past events, adapts to changing conditions, and accounts for multiple influencing factors. The output is a heatmap representing event density.
*   **Layered Prioritization System:**  Events are categorized into layers with varying priority levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low). Priority is determined by pre-defined rules (configurable by operator) and real-time assessment of risk and impact. This is *not* object recognition. It's about zone importance.  For example, a zone near a high-value asset has higher priority.
*   **Dynamic Camera Control Module:**  This module receives priority maps and camera capabilities as input.  It dynamically adjusts PTZ camera angles, zoom levels, and fixed-camera recording parameters (frame rate, resolution) based on predicted event density and priority.  The goal is to maximize coverage of high-priority areas *before* an event occurs.
*   **Camera Network:** Consists of PTZ cameras (with wide dynamic range) and fixed-position cameras strategically deployed across the monitored area. Each camera reports its position, orientation, capabilities, and current status.
*   **Edge Processing Units:** Each camera (or small cluster of cameras) has an associated edge processing unit for pre-processing data (e.g., image enhancement, motion detection) and running local prediction models.

**Pseudocode - Dynamic Camera Adjustment**

```
// Global variables:
priorityMap: 2D array (representing event priority in each zone)
cameraList: List of Camera objects (each with position, orientation, capabilities)
predictionHorizon: Time horizon for prediction (e.g., 300 seconds)

function adjustCameraPositions():
  for each camera in cameraList:
    //1. Determine relevant zone within priorityMap based on camera's field of view.
    relevantZones = getRelevantZones(camera)

    //2. Calculate priority score for each relevant zone
    zoneScores = calculateZoneScores(relevantZones)

    //3.  If the calculated score exceeds a threshold, then adjust the cameras.
    if(max(zoneScores) > priorityThreshold):
        //4. Calculate new optimal pan, tilt, and zoom values.
        newPanTiltZoom = calculateOptimalPTZ(zoneScores, camera.capabilities)

        //5. Command the camera to adjust to the new values.
        camera.panTo(newPanTiltZoom.pan)
        camera.tiltTo(newPanTiltZoom.tilt)
        camera.zoomTo(newPanTiltZoom.zoom)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive tracking to proactive anticipation.  It doesn't require identifying *what* is happening to adjust camera resources; it only needs to know *where* something is likely to happen based on layered priorities and probabilistic prediction. It's about shifting resources preventatively, rather than reacting to an event in progress. The zone/priority system also means that camera assets are not solely devoted to tracking objects, but to monitoring important areas, increasing system resilience to false positives or occlusions.
