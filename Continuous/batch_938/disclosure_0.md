## Secure Hardware Attestation via Dynamic Root of Trust & Ephemeral Key Injection

**Concept:** Implement a system where firmware updates *and* ongoing hardware attestation are tied to a dynamically generated root of trust and utilize ephemeral key injection for secure communication. This expands beyond simply securing updates; it allows for continuous verification of hardware integrity *after* updates, preventing compromised hardware from operating normally.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dynamic Root of Trust (DRoT) Generation:**

*   **Hardware Component:** Dedicated Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 or equivalent secure enclave.
*   **Initialization:** Upon initial device power-up (or secure boot sequence), the DRoT is *not* a static key. Instead, a random seed is generated by a true random number generator (TRNG). This seed is used to derive the initial DRoT key using a Key Derivation Function (KDF) like HKDF-SHA256.
*   **Periodic Rotation:**  The DRoT key is *periodically rotated* (e.g., every 24 hours, or after a configurable number of attestation requests).  A new random seed is generated, and the KDF is applied, creating a new DRoT.  The old DRoT is securely archived (encrypted with the new DRoT) for rollback/audit purposes.
*   **Key Storage:** The DRoT (and archived DRoTs) are stored securely within the TPM, inaccessible to the main processor without authorization.

**2. Ephemeral Key Injection & Secure Communication:**

*   **Attestation Request:** When a device needs to prove its integrity, it initiates an attestation request.
*   **Ephemeral Key Generation:**  The device generates a new, ephemeral Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) key pair (e.g., using Curve25519) specifically for *this* attestation session.
*   **Challenge Response:** A central authority (e.g., a cloud server) issues a challenge to the device, encrypted using the device’s *current* DRoT.
*   **Signing with Ephemeral Key:** The device decrypts the challenge using the DRoT.  It then signs the challenge using its ephemeral private key.
*   **DRoT-Encrypted Response:**  The signed challenge (and the device's public ephemeral key) is *re-encrypted* using the *current* DRoT before being sent to the central authority.
*   **Verification:** The central authority decrypts the response using the *known* DRoT. It verifies the signature using the device’s public ephemeral key. Successful verification confirms both the device’s integrity *and* the validity of the attestation session.

**3. Firmware Update Protocol (integrated with DRoT & Ephemeral Keys):**

*   **Update Request:** The device requests a firmware update from the central authority.
*   **Signed Update Package:** The central authority provides a signed firmware update package. The signature is generated using a key known to both the device and the central authority.
*   **DRoT-Encrypted Update:** The firmware update package is encrypted using the *current* DRoT.
*   **Update Verification:** The device decrypts the firmware update using the DRoT. It verifies the signature before applying the update.
*   **DRoT Re-keying:** *Immediately* after a successful firmware update, the DRoT is re-keyed (rotated) as described above. This ensures that any compromise of the firmware *before* the update is not carried over to the updated system.



**Pseudocode (Attestation Process):**

```
// Device Side
function Attest():
  GenerateRandomSeed()
  DRoT = DeriveKey(RandomSeed)  // Key Derivation Function
  GenerateEphemeralKeyPair()
  Challenge = GetChallenge(DRoT)  // Get from Central Authority
  SignedChallenge = Sign(Challenge, EphemeralPrivateKey)
  EncryptedResponse = Encrypt(SignedChallenge, DRoT)
  Send(EncryptedResponse)


// Central Authority Side
function VerifyAttestation(EncryptedResponse, DeviceID):
  DRoT = GetDeviceDRoT(DeviceID) // Retrieve known DRoT
  SignedChallenge = Decrypt(EncryptedResponse, DRoT)
  DevicePublicKey = ExtractPublicKey(SignedChallenge)
  if VerifySignature(SignedChallenge, DevicePublicKey):
    return True // Attestation Successful
  else:
    return False // Attestation Failed
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   TPM 2.0 or equivalent secure enclave with TRNG.
*   Dedicated hardware cryptographic accelerator for ECC operations.
*   Secure storage for DRoT and archived DRoTs.

**Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security through dynamic root of trust.
*   Continuous hardware attestation.
*   Protection against rollback attacks.
*   Strong protection against firmware tampering.
*   Improved resilience against supply chain attacks.
