## Dynamic Trust Mapping via Environmental Resonance

**Concept:** Extend device onboarding beyond static confidence scores by establishing a ‘trust map’ based on real-time environmental resonance between devices, leveraging ambient sensors and localized RF fingerprinting. This builds a dynamic, contextual understanding of device relationships, drastically increasing security and reducing false positives during onboarding.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Resonance Nodes (RN):** Small, low-power devices deployed strategically within the secure LAN’s physical space. Each RN contains:
    *   Microphone array (for ambient sound analysis).
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light, air quality).
    *   RF fingerprinting module (captures unique RF characteristics of the immediate environment).
    *   Secure Element (for cryptographic operations and storage of RN identity).
    *   Short-range wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy, Zigbee).
*   **Device Agent (DA):** Software component integrated into all devices seeking to connect to the LAN. The DA communicates with Resonance Nodes and relays sensor data.
*   **Central Trust Engine (CTE):** Server-side component responsible for processing sensor data, generating trust maps, and making onboarding decisions.

**II. Software/Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Environmental Signature Generation:**
    *   Each RN continuously collects and aggregates sensor data.
    *   Data is processed using a feature extraction algorithm (e.g., Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients for audio, statistical analysis for other sensor data).
    *   The processed data creates a unique "Environmental Signature" representing the RN’s location. This signature is cryptographically signed using the RN's secure element.
2.  **Device Resonance Profiling:**
    *   Upon initial detection (e.g., Bluetooth scan), the DA attempts to establish a connection with nearby Resonance Nodes.
    *   The DA requests the current Environmental Signature from each RN.
    *   The DA's onboard sensors collect data identical to that of the RNs.
    *   The DA generates a ‘Device Resonance Profile’ by comparing its sensor data with the received Environmental Signatures, calculating a similarity score (e.g., cosine similarity). The highest similarity scores indicate proximity to trusted Resonance Nodes.
3.  **Trust Map Construction:**
    *   The CTE receives Device Resonance Profiles from all onboarding devices.
    *   The CTE constructs a "Trust Map" – a graph representation of device locations and relationships. Nodes represent Resonance Nodes and devices. Edges represent the similarity scores between device/node resonance profiles.
    *   Higher edge weights indicate stronger resonance, and thus a higher degree of trust.
4.  **Dynamic Confidence Scoring:**
    *   The confidence score for a new device is no longer solely based on static factors (e.g., SSID lists, RSSI).
    *   It’s dynamically calculated based on:
        *   The strength of the device’s connection to the Trust Map (how well its resonance profile aligns with trusted nodes).
        *   The ‘trustworthiness’ of the nodes it connects to (based on historical data and reputation).
        *   The device's history (successful connections, detected anomalies).
5.  **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   The CTE continuously monitors the Trust Map for anomalies:
        *   Devices attempting to connect from unexpected locations.
        *   Resonance profiles that deviate significantly from the expected baseline.
        *   Suspicious activity patterns.

**III. Pseudocode (Dynamic Confidence Scoring):**

```
function calculateConfidenceScore(device, trustMap):
    baseScore = 0.5 //Initial confidence
    resonanceScore = 0
    nodeTrustScore = 0
    historyScore = 0

    // Calculate Resonance Score
    for each node in trustMap:
        similarity = compareResonanceProfiles(device, node)
        resonanceScore += similarity * node.weight //Node weight based on reputation

    //Calculate History Score
    historyScore = getDeviceHistoryScore(device)

    // Combine Scores
    confidenceScore = baseScore + (resonanceScore * 0.4) + (historyScore * 0.1)

    return confidenceScore
```

**IV. System Interactions:**

1.  New device enters the LAN’s range.
2.  DA scans for Resonance Nodes.
3.  DA requests Environmental Signatures.
4.  DA generates Device Resonance Profile.
5.  DA sends profile to CTE.
6.  CTE constructs Trust Map and calculates confidence score.
7.  Based on the score, CTE either grants access, requests further authentication, or denies access.
8.  The Trust Map is continuously updated with new data and device interactions.
