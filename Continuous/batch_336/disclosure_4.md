## Dynamic Map Style Generation from User-Defined Aesthetic Parameters

**Concept:** Extend the core rendering comparison system to *generate* map styles based on high-level aesthetic parameters provided by the user, and then compare rendering engines based on their ability to faithfully reproduce those styles. This shifts the focus from identifying errors in *existing* styles to evaluating engines based on their *stylistic flexibility* and fidelity.

**Specs:**

1.  **Aesthetic Parameter Interface:** Develop a UI allowing users to define aesthetic parameters. Examples:
    *   **Color Palette:** User selects primary, secondary, accent colors, or imports a palette image.
    *   **Road Weight/Emphasis:** Slider controlling road width, color saturation, and hierarchical emphasis (major highways vs. local roads).
    *   **Land Cover Style:** Radio buttons or dropdown menu for selecting broad land cover styles (e.g., "Realistic," "Simplified," "Watercolor," "Topographic"). Each style defines how land cover is rendered (colors, textures, patterns).
    *   **Typography:** Font selection (with preview), size scaling, and style (bold, italic) for labels.
    *   **Water Style:**  Options for water rendering (flat color, simulated depth, wave patterns, reflectivity).
    *   **Night Mode/Dark Theme:** Toggle for switching between day and night rendering.
    *   **Saturation/Contrast Adjustment:** Global sliders for overall image appearance.

2.  **Style Definition Language (SDL):**  Implement an intermediate SDL that encodes the user-defined aesthetic parameters. This SDL should be engine-agnostic and describe the desired visual appearance in a structured format.  Example (JSON-like):

    ```json
    {
      "colors": {
        "primary": "#3498db",
        "secondary": "#2ecc71",
        "road_major": "#f39c12",
        "water": "#b3e5fc"
      },
      "road_weight": 0.7,
      "land_cover_style": "simplified",
      "typography": {
        "font": "Arial",
        "size": 12,
        "bold": true
      },
      "water_style": "flat_color"
    }
    ```

3.  **Rendering Engine Adaptation Layer:**  Create a layer that translates the SDL into engine-specific rendering instructions.  Each rendering engine will require a unique adapter module to interpret the SDL and apply the corresponding styles.

4.  **Automated Style Rendering & Comparison:**
    *   Select a region on a map.
    *   Generate the SDL based on user input.
    *   Send the SDL to each rendering engine via its adapter module.
    *   Each engine renders the map region according to the received style.
    *   The system captures screenshots of the rendered maps.
    *   A perceptual difference metric (e.g., SSIM, LPIPS) is used to quantify the visual differences between the rendered maps.
    *   A "Style Fidelity Score" is calculated for each engine, reflecting how well it adheres to the defined style.
    *   Display the rendered maps side-by-side with the Style Fidelity Scores.
    *   Highlight areas where the engines deviate significantly from the desired style.

5.  **Parameter Randomization/Fuzzing:** Introduce a module to randomly generate SDL parameters within defined ranges. This allows for automated testing of engine robustness and identification of edge cases where rendering breaks down.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
def generate_style_fidelity_report(region, style_parameters):
  """
  Generates a report comparing rendering engine fidelity to a given style.
  """
  engines = ["EngineA", "EngineB", "EngineC"]
  rendered_maps = {}

  for engine in engines:
    sdl = generate_sdl(style_parameters) # Convert parameters to SDL
    rendered_map = render_map(engine, region, sdl) # Engine renders map
    rendered_maps[engine] = rendered_map

  # Calculate perceptual differences and fidelity scores
  scores = calculate_style_fidelity(rendered_maps)

  # Display results and highlight deviations
  display_results(rendered_maps, scores)
```

This system moves beyond simply detecting errors to actively *evaluating* and *comparing* the stylistic capabilities of different rendering engines.  It provides a quantitative metric for stylistic fidelity and helps identify engines that are best suited for creating visually appealing and consistent maps. The fuzzing capability adds a layer of robustness testing.
