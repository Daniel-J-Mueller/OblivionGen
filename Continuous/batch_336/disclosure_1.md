## Automated RF Shielding Mesh & Dynamic Cage Configuration

**Specification:** Modular, dynamically reconfigurable RF shielding system for localized interference mitigation in complex automated environments.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of static Faraday cages, utilize a network of individually addressable RF shielding modules forming a temporary, localized mesh. This mesh can dynamically adapt to the location of interfering wireless devices and create shielding "bubbles" on demand.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **RF Shielding Modules:** Small (e.g., 30cm x 30cm x 5cm) units constructed with a lightweight, high-attenuation RF shielding material (e.g., a woven metal mesh embedded in a polymer composite). Each module incorporates:
    *   Microcontroller (ESP32 or similar) for network communication and control.
    *   Addressable LEDs for visual status/debugging.
    *   Short-range (e.g., UWB, Bluetooth mesh) communication capability.
    *   Magnetic mounting system for attachment to metallic surfaces (conveyors, robotic arms, structural supports).
    *   Power delivery via conductive rails or wireless power transfer.
*   **Sensor Network:** Distributed sensors (spectrum analyzers, RSSI meters) to detect RF interference sources. Data is fed into a central control system.
*   **Control System:**  Software running on a dedicated edge computing device.  This system:
    *   Receives interference data from the sensor network.
    *   Calculates the optimal configuration of RF shielding modules to isolate the interference.
    *   Sends commands to the modules to activate/deactivate and position themselves.
*   **Actuation System:** Small linear actuators integrated into mounting points to allow modules to subtly reposition for fine-tuning of shielding.

**Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Interference Mapping:** Sensor data is used to create a real-time map of RF interference levels within the workspace.
2.  **Shielding Path Planning:** An algorithm determines the shortest and most effective path to create a shielding "bubble" around the source of interference or the sensitive receiving device. This algorithm prioritizes minimizing the number of activated modules and maximizing shielding effectiveness. The algorithm will account for reflections and diffraction.
3.  **Module Activation & Positioning:** The control system sends commands to the RF shielding modules to activate and position themselves along the calculated shielding path.  The actuator system fine-tunes the position to maximize coverage and minimize gaps.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors interference levels and adjusts the shielding configuration in real-time to respond to changes in the environment (e.g., moving robots, new interference sources).
5.  **Adaptive Mesh Refinement:** The system can dynamically increase the density of shielding modules in areas with high interference levels, or reduce density in areas with low interference.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
sensorNetwork.init()
moduleNetwork.init()

//Main Loop
while (true) {
    interferenceMap = sensorNetwork.scan()
    shieldingPath = pathPlanningAlgorithm(interferenceMap)
    moduleNetwork.activate(shieldingPath)
    moduleNetwork.position(shieldingPath)

    // Feedback loop - continuously monitor and refine
    refinedPath = feedbackAlgorithm(sensorNetwork.scan(), shieldingPath)
    moduleNetwork.adjust(refinedPath)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-density automated warehouses.
*   Robotics workcells with multiple wireless-controlled robots.
*   Medical imaging facilities.
*   Secure communication environments.
*   Wireless testing & measurement labs.
