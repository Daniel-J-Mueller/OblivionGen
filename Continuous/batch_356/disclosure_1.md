## Adaptive Multi-Spectral Fire Detection System

**Concept:** Expand beyond visible light smoke detection to incorporate thermal and gas (CO, CO2) sensing, combined with advanced image fusion and AI-driven anomaly detection for early, highly reliable fire/smoke identification. This moves beyond *detecting* smoke to *predicting* fire events.

**System Components:**

1.  **Multi-Spectral Sensor Array:**
    *   Visible Light Cameras (2+): High resolution, wide dynamic range. Overlapping fields of view for improved composite image quality.
    *   Thermal Infrared (IR) Camera:  Detects heat signatures *before* visible smoke appears. Resolution sufficient to identify localized temperature increases indicative of smoldering materials.
    *   Gas Sensors (CO, CO2): Array of sensors strategically placed to detect elevated levels of these gases, common byproducts of combustion.  Digital outputs with calibrated readings.

2.  **Edge Processing Unit:** (Dedicated embedded system)
    *   High-performance processor capable of real-time image and sensor data processing.
    *   Local storage for temporary data buffering and algorithm execution.
    *   Network connectivity (Ethernet, WiFi) for data transmission to a central server.

3.  **Central Server:** (Cloud-based or on-premise)
    *   Database for storing historical sensor data, images, and event logs.
    *   Machine learning models for anomaly detection and predictive fire analysis.
    *   User interface for monitoring system status, viewing alerts, and accessing historical data.

**Software & Algorithms:**

1.  **Image Fusion Engine:**
    *   Combines visible light, IR, and potentially other spectral bands into a unified image.
    *   Dynamic weighting of spectral bands based on environmental conditions (lighting, humidity, etc.).
    *   Super-resolution techniques to enhance image clarity and detail.

2.  **Background Subtraction & Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Advanced background modeling algorithms (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) to accurately separate foreground objects from the background.
    *   Anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., autoencoders, one-class SVMs) to identify unusual patterns in the fused image data.
    *   Multi-sensor fusion: Combining visual anomalies with elevated gas levels and temperature increases.

3.  **Predictive Fire Modeling:**
    *   Machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks) trained on historical sensor data to predict the likelihood of fire events.
    *   Consideration of environmental factors (weather, time of day, occupancy) to improve prediction accuracy.

4.  **Alerting & Visualization:**
    *   Real-time alerts triggered by detected anomalies or predicted fire events.
    *   Interactive visualization tools for displaying sensor data, images, and alerts.
    *   Geolocation of detected events for rapid response.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Module):**

```
// Input: Fused Image Frame, Background Model, Gas Sensor Readings, Temperature Readings

function detectAnomaly(imageFrame, backgroundModel, gasReadings, temperatureReadings):
    // 1. Background Subtraction
    foregroundMask = subtractBackground(imageFrame, backgroundModel)

    // 2. Feature Extraction
    features = extractFeatures(foregroundMask) // e.g., size, shape, texture

    // 3. Anomaly Scoring
    anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(features)

    // 4. Sensor Data Integration
    if (gasReadings > gasThreshold) or (temperatureReadings > temperatureThreshold):
        anomalyScore += sensorBoost // Increase score if sensors indicate combustion

    // 5. Thresholding
    if (anomalyScore > anomalyThreshold):
        return true // Anomaly detected
    else:
        return false
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simple smoke/fire *detection* to focus on *prediction* using multi-spectral data fusion and machine learning.  By integrating gas and thermal data with visual information, it can identify potential fire hazards *before* they become visible, providing critical early warning.  The focus on *predictive* modeling is a key differentiator from existing systems.
