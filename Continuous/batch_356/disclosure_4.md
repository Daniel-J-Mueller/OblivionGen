**Dynamic Key Derivation via Environmental Sensors**

**Specification:** A system integrating environmental sensors with cryptographic key generation, extending the patent's core concept of embedding keys within URLs.

**Components:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**  Microphone, accelerometer, light sensor, temperature sensor, ambient RF scanner (detecting nearby Bluetooth/Wi-Fi signals). All integrated into a small, tamper-evident module.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):** A robust KDF (e.g., Argon2, scrypt) designed to take sensor data as primary input.  The KDF must be highly sensitive to minor variations in sensor readings.
*   **URL Encoding Module:**  Module responsible for encoding the derived key and request parameters within a URL, compatible with the existing system.  Includes error correction and redundancy.
*   **Service Provider Integration:**  Service provider infrastructure updated to receive URLs with sensor-derived keys and validate them using a synchronized sensor baseline.
*   **Secure Enclave:** A hardware-based secure enclave within the sensor module to protect raw sensor data and the initial stages of key derivation.

**Operation:**

1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:** The sensor module continuously samples data from its sensors.
2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Raw sensor data is preprocessed (noise filtering, normalization).
3.  **Key Derivation:** The preprocessed sensor data is fed into the KDF, generating a unique cryptographic key. The KDF uses a salt derived from a system-wide, regularly updated seed to prevent replay attacks.
4.  **URL Encoding:** The derived key, request parameters, and a timestamp are encoded into a URL.
5.  **Request Transmission:** The URL is transmitted to the service provider.
6.  **Key Validation:** The service provider receives the URL, extracts the key, and initiates a validation process.
7.  **Sensor Baseline Synchronization:** The service provider maintains a synchronized baseline of expected sensor readings based on the device's known location and environmental conditions. 
8.  **Key Comparison:** The service provider compares the extracted key, derived from the received sensor data, against a key derived from its own synchronized sensor baseline. A tolerance threshold is applied to account for minor environmental variations.
9.  **Request Fulfillment:** If the key comparison falls within the tolerance threshold, the request is considered valid and fulfilled. 
10. **Ephemeral Key Usage:** The key is used only for this single request and then discarded.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function deriveKey(sensorData, salt, seed):
  combinedData = sensorData + salt + seed
  hashedData = SHA256(combinedData)
  key = PBKDF2(hashedData, "encryption_salt", 100000, 32) // 32-byte key
  return key
```

**Innovation:** This expands on the concept of embedding keys within URLs by making those keys *dynamic* and dependent on the immediate environmental conditions. It adds a layer of physical security beyond just cryptographic methods, making it extremely difficult for attackers to replay captured requests or forge valid ones without precise knowledge of the deviceâ€™s environment. It necessitates a more complex but more secure architecture for both the requestor and the service provider.
