## Adaptive Content Sculpting with Generative Previews

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of device-specific formatting to *actively* reshape content based on predicted user interaction *before* the user interacts with it. This goes beyond simply swapping assets (like table to image) and delves into micro-content generation tailored to anticipated user needs.

**Specs:**

1.  **Interaction Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Device attributes (screen size, resolution, processing power, input method – touch, mouse, stylus), user profile (reading history, preferences – font size, color schemes, preferred content types), context (time of day, location – if available with permission), and initial content analysis (document structure, key entities, content complexity).
    *   Process: Employ a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM network) trained on user interaction data (scroll speed, zoom levels, tap/click locations, time spent on specific sections).  The model predicts likely user actions – sections to be viewed, zoom levels, potential search queries, and preferred summarization lengths.
    *   Output: Probability distribution of likely user interactions (e.g., 70% chance user will zoom in on diagrams, 30% chance user will skip to section 3).

2.  **Content Sculpture Module:**
    *   Input: Original content, interaction probability distribution.
    *   Process:  Dynamically modify content *proactively*. This can include:
        *   **Pre-rendered Summaries:** Generate short summaries of sections with high probability of being skipped.  These summaries appear as expandable tooltips on initial view.
        *   **Dynamic Diagram Simplification:** Simplify complex diagrams based on predicted zoom levels.  Lower zoom predictions lead to fewer details displayed.
        *   **Micro-Content Generation:** Generate micro-content (short explanations, definitions) for key terms with high probability of being searched for.  These appear as inline pop-ups.
        *   **Proactive Pagination:** Dynamically adjust pagination to prioritize sections with high predicted engagement.
        *   **Interactive Element Pre-Loading:** Pre-load interactive elements (e.g., 3D models, simulations) in sections with high probability of being explored.
    *   Output: Modified content ready for display.

3.  **Generative Preview Pipeline:**
    *   Process: Generate multiple preview "sculptures" of the content, each optimized for a different predicted interaction profile.  Display a low-resolution preview of each sculpture in a carousel format *before* the user fully loads the content.
    *   User Selection:  The user selects the preview that best matches their anticipated needs.  The system then loads the full version of the selected sculpture.
    *   Adaptive Refinement:  As the user interacts with the content, the system continuously refines the sculpture based on actual user behavior.

**Pseudocode (Content Sculpture Module):**

```
function sculptContent(content, interactionProbs):
  modifiedContent = content

  // Summarize sections with low view probability
  for section in content.sections:
    if interactionProbs.viewProbability(section) < 0.3:
      modifiedContent.addTooltip(section, generateSummary(section))

  // Simplify diagrams based on zoom probability
  for diagram in content.diagrams:
    if interactionProbs.zoomProbability(diagram) < 0.5:
      modifiedContent.simplifyDiagram(diagram)

  // Add micro-content for key terms
  for term in content.keyTerms:
    if interactionProbs.searchProbability(term) > 0.7:
      modifiedContent.addMicroContent(term, generateDefinition(term))

  return modifiedContent
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   This system requires a robust machine learning infrastructure for training and deploying the interaction prediction model.
*   Micro-content generation should be efficient and scalable to handle large volumes of content.
*   The generative preview pipeline should be optimized for performance to minimize loading times.
*   User privacy should be a primary consideration when collecting and using user data for interaction prediction.
*   Explore integration with existing content creation tools to allow authors to provide hints or guidelines for content sculpting.
