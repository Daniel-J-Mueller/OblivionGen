## Electronic Device - Haptic Projection System

**Concept:** An electronic device incorporating localized haptic feedback *projected* onto the user’s skin via ultrasonic transducers, creating the sensation of texture, shape, and even force without physical contact. This builds on the idea of a device’s surface as an interface, but removes the need for *actual* physical touch.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Form Factor:** Sleek, handheld device (approx. 150mm x 75mm x 10mm) with a smooth, curved front surface. Internal components housed within a durable polymer shell.
*   **Transducer Array:** 64 x 64 array of miniaturized ultrasonic transducers embedded beneath the front surface. Each transducer individually controllable in frequency and amplitude. Transducer frequency range: 20kHz - 80kHz. Spacing: 2mm between transducers.
*   **Focusing System:** Micro-lens array positioned above the transducer array. Allows for dynamic focusing of ultrasonic waves to create localized pressure points on the skin. Lens material: Acrylic or similar transparent polymer.  Adjustable focal length range: 5mm - 20mm.
*   **Processing Unit:** Integrated System-on-Chip (SoC) with dedicated hardware for real-time wave shaping and focusing control. Minimum requirements: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, 8GB RAM, dedicated GPU for rendering haptic textures.
*   **Power Source:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (3000mAh). Wireless charging capability (Qi standard).
*   **Software Interface:** API allowing developers to create haptic textures and effects. Support for common 3D modeling formats (OBJ, STL). Real-time texture streaming and rendering.
*   **Safety Features:** Automatic power shut-off if device is held too close to sensitive areas (eyes, ears). Maximum output power limit to prevent skin damage.  User adjustable intensity levels.
*   **Haptic Resolution:** Minimum addressable haptic ‘pixel’: 1mm x 1mm.
*   **Feedback Modes:**
    *   *Texture Mode:* Simulate the feeling of different materials (wood, metal, fabric).
    *   *Shape Mode:* Create the illusion of 3D shapes and contours.
    *   *Force Mode:* Provide localized pressure sensations (e.g., buttons, levers).
    *   *Dynamic Mode:*  Combine texture, shape, and force modes for complex haptic experiences.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Texture Rendering):**

```
Function RenderHapticTexture(textureData, targetArea) {
  // textureData: 2D array representing the texture map (height values)
  // targetArea: Coordinates of the target area on the skin

  For each pixel in textureData {
    x = pixel.x
    y = pixel.y
    height = pixel.height

    // Calculate corresponding transducer coordinates
    transducerX = x * transducerDensity
    transducerY = y * transducerDensity

    // Calculate the required amplitude and frequency for the transducer
    amplitude = height * intensityLevel
    frequency = baseFrequency + (height * frequencyOffset)

    // Send commands to the transducer controller
    transducerController.setAmplitude(transducerX, transducerY, amplitude)
    transducerController.setFrequency(transducerX, transducerY, frequency)
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Gaming: Immersive haptic feedback for enhanced gameplay.
*   Accessibility:  Providing tactile information for visually impaired users.
*   Medical:  Remote palpation and diagnostics.
*   Design & Prototyping:  Simulating the feel of products before physical creation.
*   Art & Entertainment:  Creating novel interactive experiences.
