# D768786

## Haptic Feedback Suit Integration

**Concept:** Extend game controller functionality by integrating haptic feedback *directly* into a full-body suit worn by the player. This moves beyond localized controller vibrations to deliver immersive, full-body sensations mirroring in-game events.

**Specifications:**

*   **Controller as Hub:** The existing game controller (D768786) serves as the central processing unit and wireless transmitter. All haptic data originates from the controller, interpreting game events and translating them into haptic signals.
*   **Suit Architecture:**  A lightweight, form-fitting suit constructed from a breathable, conductive fabric. The suit will incorporate an array of micro-pneumatic actuators strategically placed across key muscle groups (arms, legs, torso, back).  Actuators are arranged in a grid pattern for precise, localized feedback.
*   **Actuator Control:** Each actuator is individually addressable via a wireless communication protocol (Bluetooth 5.0 or higher) established with the controller.  The controller sends commands dictating the intensity and duration of each actuator's inflation/deflation.
*   **Sensor Integration (Optional):** Integrate stretch sensors within the suit fabric to detect player movement and posture.  This data can be relayed back to the controller, enabling dynamic haptic adjustments based on the playerâ€™s actions (e.g., stronger impact feedback when sprinting).
*   **Power:**  A rechargeable battery pack integrated into the suit's back panel. Battery life target: 8 hours of continuous use.
*   **Software Interface:** Software development kit (SDK) provided for game developers to easily integrate haptic suit support into their games.  The SDK will allow developers to map in-game events to specific haptic patterns.  Example: receiving damage in a shooter game triggers rapid, localized pressure on the torso.
*   **Haptic Profiles:** Pre-defined haptic profiles for different game genres (e.g., realistic gun recoil for shooters, wind resistance for racing games, impact sensations for fighting games).  Users can customize these profiles or create their own.
*   **Calibration Routine:** A built-in calibration routine to optimize haptic feedback based on individual body size and shape.

**Pseudocode (Controller Side):**

```
function process_game_event(event_type, event_data) {
  if (event_type == "impact") {
    impact_location = event_data["location"];
    impact_force = event_data["force"];
    
    // Map impact location to corresponding actuator groups in the suit
    actuator_groups = map_location_to_actuators(impact_location);
    
    // Calculate actuator intensity based on impact force
    intensity = scale(impact_force, 0, 100, 0, 255); 

    // Send command to suit actuators
    send_haptic_command(actuator_groups, intensity); 
  }
  // Repeat for other event types (e.g., weapon recoil, wind resistance)
}

function send_haptic_command(actuator_groups, intensity) {
  // Package command data (actuator group IDs, intensity)
  command_data = build_command_packet(actuator_groups, intensity);

  // Transmit command data to haptic suit via wireless connection
  wireless_transmit(command_data);
}
```
