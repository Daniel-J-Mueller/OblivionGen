## Automated Data Tiering Based on Access Entropy & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Dynamically tier storage across server systems not just based on immediate access patterns, but by *predicting* future access needs using entropy analysis and machine learning. This goes beyond simple hot/cold data separation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Access logs from all server systems (timestamp, data block ID, read/write operation).
*   **Process:**  Calculate Shannon entropy for each data block over sliding time windows (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours). Higher entropy indicates more unpredictable/random access, suggesting data that benefits from faster storage.  Track entropy *changes* over time - increasing entropy is a signal to proactively move data *before* performance degrades.
*   **Output:** Entropy score & rate of change for each data block.

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Input:** Historical entropy data, data block metadata (file type, owner, creation date, last modified), system load metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O), time-of-day/day-of-week.
*   **Process:**  Train a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict future entropy for each data block. Include feature engineering to incorporate metadata and system load.  Model should output a probability distribution of future entropy levels.
*   **Output:** Predicted entropy distribution for each data block over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 12 hours, 24 hours).

**3. Dynamic Tiering Manager:**

*   **Input:** Predicted entropy distributions, current storage tier assignments, available storage capacity on each tier, system policies (e.g., maximum tier cost, performance SLOs).
*   **Process:**
    *   Define threshold values for predicted entropy to determine tier assignments (e.g., High Entropy -> SSD Tier, Medium Entropy -> NVMe Tier, Low Entropy -> HDD Tier).
    *   Use an optimization algorithm (e.g., linear programming) to determine the optimal tier assignment for each data block, minimizing cost while meeting performance requirements.
    *   Consider data locality & network bandwidth when moving data between servers.
*   **Output:** Tier assignment recommendations for each data block.

**4. Automated Data Movement Service:**

*   **Input:** Tier assignment recommendations, data block IDs, target server IDs.
*   **Process:**
    *   Initiate data movement requests to the appropriate server systems.
    *   Employ data deduplication and compression techniques to minimize transfer bandwidth.
    *   Implement data integrity checks to ensure data consistency.
    *   Monitor data movement progress and report errors.

**Pseudocode (Tiering Manager):**

```
function determine_tier(data_block, predicted_entropy):
  if predicted_entropy > HIGH_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD:
    return "SSD"
  elif predicted_entropy > MEDIUM_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD:
    return "NVMe"
  else:
    return "HDD"

function optimize_tier_assignments(data_blocks, server_capacities, policies):
  // Linear Programming Optimization
  // Objective: Minimize total storage cost
  // Constraints:
  //   - Server capacity limits
  //   - Performance SLOs
  //   - Data locality preferences

  best_assignment = solve_optimization_problem(data_blocks, server_capacities, policies)
  return best_assignment

function move_data(data_block, source_server, destination_server):
  // Initiate data transfer request
  // Verify data integrity
  // Update metadata
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond reactive tiering based on historical access patterns. By using predictive modeling, it can proactively move data *before* performance issues occur, improving overall system efficiency and user experience. The entropy analysis adds a nuanced understanding of data access behavior, enabling more intelligent tiering decisions. This design anticipates data needs, rather than simply reacting to them.
