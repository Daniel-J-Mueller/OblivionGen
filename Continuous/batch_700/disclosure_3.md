## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Player Skill Trajectory

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on assigning resources based on current player attributes. This extends that by *predicting* future skill levels and proactively allocating resources to support anticipated needs, rather than reacting to current performance. This moves beyond simply matching a player to a VM; it anticipates their growth and scales resources accordingly.

**Specs:**

**1. Skill Trajectory Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical gameplay data (e.g., win rates, K/D ratios, in-game decisions, resource management, map awareness metrics) for each player.  Data ingested in real-time as gameplay occurs.
*   **Process:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model each player's skill progression. The LSTM is trained on a large dataset of anonymized player data.
*   **Output:**  A probabilistic skill trajectory. This isn't a single predicted skill level, but a distribution of possible skill levels over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 7 days, 30 days).  Expressed as a time-series of probability distributions.  Confidence intervals are crucial.

**2. Resource Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Skill trajectory (from Module 1). Game-specific resource requirements (CPU, GPU, memory, bandwidth) at various skill levels.  Latency targets (based on player location and network conditions).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each possible skill level in the trajectory, estimate the required resources. Use a lookup table or a trained regression model to map skill level to resource demands.
    *   Propagate the skill trajectory forward in time, continuously updating the estimated resource needs.
    *   Calculate the *maximum* predicted resource demand over the defined time horizon. This provides a buffer for unexpected skill jumps or challenging game scenarios.
*   **Output:** A predicted resource profile – a time-series indicating the required resources over the defined time horizon.

**3. Proactive Resource Allocation System:**

*   **Input:** Predicted resource profile (from Module 2). Available VM pool (with attributes like CPU, GPU, memory, location). Player location and network conditions.
*   **Process:**
    *   Continuously monitor the predicted resource profile.
    *   When the predicted demand exceeds the current allocation, proactively request additional VM resources.
    *   Prioritize requests based on player importance (e.g., paying subscribers, high-engagement players).
    *   Employ a distributed resource manager to allocate VMs across different geographical regions to minimize latency.  Leverage a Kubernetes-style container orchestration system.
    *   Implement an automated scaling system that dynamically adjusts the number of allocated VMs based on real-time demand and the predicted resource profile.
*   **Output:** Dynamically allocated VM resources – ensuring that each player has sufficient resources to support their current and anticipated skill level.

**4. Feedback Loop & Model Refinement:**

*   **Process:**  Monitor actual gameplay performance. Compare the predicted skill trajectory with actual performance metrics. Use this data to refine the LSTM model and improve the accuracy of future predictions. Implement reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation policies.
*   **Data:** Real-time gameplay data, player feedback (e.g., reports of lag or performance issues).

**Pseudocode (Resource Prediction Engine):**

```
function predictResources(skillTrajectory, gameResourceMap, timeHorizon):
  predictedResourceProfile = []
  for timeStep in range(timeHorizon):
    skillLevel = sampleFrom(skillTrajectory, timeStep) // Sample a skill level from the distribution
    resourceDemand = lookupResourceDemand(skillLevel, gameResourceMap) // Get resource demand for that skill level
    predictedResourceProfile.append(resourceDemand)
  maxResourceDemand = max(predictedResourceProfile)
  return maxResourceDemand
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond static or reactive resource allocation. By *predicting* player skill, the system can proactively allocate resources, improving the gaming experience and reducing the risk of performance issues. The use of LSTM networks and reinforcement learning provides a sophisticated and adaptable approach to resource management. This creates a better experience, more stable server load, and potential for tiered subscriptions based on predicted resource needs.
