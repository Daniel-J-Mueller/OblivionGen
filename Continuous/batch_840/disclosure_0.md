## Dynamic Patch Decomposition for Multi-Modal Fusion

**Concept:** Expand on the patch-based analysis in the provided patent by introducing a system that *dynamically* adjusts patch decomposition based not only on pixel attributes (as in the original patent) but also incorporates data from *multiple* sensor modalities (e.g., depth, thermal, infrared, audio). This allows for more robust and context-aware object recognition, especially in complex environments.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Input Layer:**

*   **Modalities:** System accepts input from a configurable set of sensors: RGB camera, depth sensor (ToF or stereo), thermal camera, infrared camera, microphone array.
*   **Synchronization:** Hardware/software synchronization module ensures time-aligned data streams from all sensors.
*   **Preprocessing:** Each sensor stream undergoes modality-specific preprocessing (noise reduction, calibration, normalization).

**2. Dynamic Patch Decomposition Engine:**

*   **Initial Patch Grid:** Image initially divided into a regular grid of patches (e.g., 32x32, 64x64 pixels).
*   **Attribute Vectors:** For each patch, construct an attribute vector encompassing:
    *   **Visual Attributes:** Mean pixel intensity, standard deviation, edge density (from RGB data).
    *   **Depth Attributes:** Mean depth, depth variance, object proximity (from depth sensor).
    *   **Thermal Attributes:** Mean temperature, temperature variance, heat signature patterns (from thermal sensor).
    *   **Infrared Attributes:** IR signature intensity, IR signature patterns.
    *   **Audio Attributes:** Sound intensity, dominant frequencies, sound source localization (from microphone array).
*   **Adaptive Subdivision:** A recursive subdivision algorithm operates on the patches:
    *   **Homogeneity Test:**  Evaluate the variance within the attribute vector for each patch.
    *   **Split Criterion:** If the variance exceeds a threshold, the patch is split into four sub-patches.
    *   **Recursion:** The homogeneity test and split criterion are applied recursively to the sub-patches until a minimum patch size is reached or the variance falls below the threshold.
    *   **Multi-Modal Weighting:** A weighting scheme dynamically adjusts the contribution of each modality to the homogeneity test based on environmental conditions (e.g., prioritize thermal data in low-light conditions).
*   **Patch Graph:** Represent the final patch decomposition as a graph structure, where nodes represent patches and edges represent adjacency relationships.

**3. Feature Extraction & Descriptor Generation:**

*   **Patch Feature Vector:** For each patch, extract a feature vector encompassing:
    *   **Mean/Standard Deviation:** For each attribute within the patch.
    *   **Histogram:**  Of attribute values within the patch.
    *   **Gradient Orientation:** Within the patch.
    *   **Edge Density:** Within the patch.
*   **Graph-Based Descriptor:** Generate a global descriptor for the entire image by aggregating features from the patch graph:
    *   **Node Features:** Utilize node features (from patch feature vectors).
    *   **Edge Features:** Represent relationships between patches using edge features (e.g., adjacency, spatial distance).
    *   **Graph Convolutional Network (GCN):** Apply a GCN to learn a compact and informative representation of the image from the patch graph.

**4. Object Recognition & Classification:**

*   **Classifier:** Train a machine learning classifier (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Convolutional Neural Network) on the graph-based descriptors.
*   **Multi-Class Support:**  Enable the classifier to recognize multiple object types.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Subdivision):**

```
function adaptive_subdivide(patch, threshold, min_size):
  if patch.width <= min_size or patch.height <= min_size:
    return patch

  attribute_vector = calculate_attribute_vector(patch)
  variance = calculate_variance(attribute_vector)

  if variance > threshold:
    # Split the patch into four sub-patches
    sub_patch1 = patch.split_top_left()
    sub_patch2 = patch.split_top_right()
    sub_patch3 = patch.split_bottom_left()
    sub_patch4 = patch.split_bottom_right()

    # Recursively subdivide each sub-patch
    sub_patch1 = adaptive_subdivide(sub_patch1, threshold, min_size)
    sub_patch2 = adaptive_subdivide(sub_patch2, threshold, min_size)
    sub_patch3 = adaptive_subdivide(sub_patch3, threshold, min_size)
    sub_patch4 = adaptive_subdivide(sub_patch4, threshold, min_size)

    # Combine the subdivided patches
    return [sub_patch1, sub_patch2, sub_patch3, sub_patch4]
  else:
    return patch
```

**Potential Applications:** Autonomous navigation, robotic perception, surveillance systems, medical imaging, and augmented reality.
