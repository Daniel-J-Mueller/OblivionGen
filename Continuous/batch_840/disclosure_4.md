## Adaptive Acoustic Beaconing

**Concept:** Extend keyword spotting beyond simple suspension of noise cancellation to create an 'acoustic beacon' system. Instead of *just* pausing cancellation on a keyword, the system actively shapes the audible environment to highlight the keyword and/or its immediate context. This offers improved clarity for both the user and those interacting with them, especially in noisy environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing noise-cancelling headphone/earbud/apparatus augmented with a directional microphone array (minimum 4 elements) and enhanced digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Keyword Spotting Module:* (Existing functionality – detects predetermined keywords.)
    *   *Acoustic Profiling Module:* Analyzes ambient noise in real-time to establish a baseline 'noise profile'.
    *   *Beamforming & Attenuation Module:* Manipulates the directional microphone array to achieve the following:
        *   *Keyword Enhancement:* When a keyword is detected, the microphone array focuses on the sound source of the keyword, amplifying its signal.
        *   *Noise Attenuation:* Simultaneously attenuates noise originating from directions *not* containing the keyword. This creates a localized ‘acoustic spotlight.’
    *   *Contextual Audio Injection Module:*  Based on pre-defined rules or AI analysis, briefly injects subtle audio cues *around* the keyword. This could be a very short ‘chime’ or ‘pulse’, or even a synthesized version of the keyword spoken at a very low volume. The goal is to create an added layer of clarity without being distracting.
    *   *Adaptive Learning Module:* Uses machine learning to refine the parameters of the beamforming, attenuation, and audio injection modules based on user feedback and environmental conditions.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   *Standard Mode:* Noise cancellation operates normally.
    *   *Beacon Mode:* Activated by keyword detection. Implements beamforming, attenuation, and optional audio injection. Noise cancellation is temporarily *shaped*, not completely suspended. This preserves some level of ambient sound awareness.
    *   *Contextual Mode:* Operates similarly to Beacon Mode, but allows for dynamic adjustment of the audio injection cues based on detected context (e.g., a different cue for an emergency keyword versus a casual phrase).
*   **Pseudocode (Core Logic - Keyword Detection & Beacon Activation):**

```
// Function: ProcessAudioFrame(audioFrame)

// 1. Analyze audioFrame for keywords using KeywordSpottingModule
keywordDetected = KeywordSpottingModule.detectKeyword(audioFrame)

if (keywordDetected) {

    // 2. Activate Acoustic Profiling to get current noise profile.
    noiseProfile = AcousticProfilingModule.getNoiseProfile()

    // 3. Determine the direction of the keyword source.
    sourceDirection = AcousticProfilingModule.getSourceDirection(audioFrame)

    // 4. Configure Beamforming & Attenuation Module
    BeamformingAttenuationModule.configure(sourceDirection, noiseProfile)

    // 5. Inject Contextual Audio (if enabled)
    if (ContextualAudioEnabled) {
        context = ContextualAnalysisModule.analyzeContext(audioFrame)
        audioCue = ContextualAudioModule.getAudioCue(context)
        audioCue = BeamformingAttenuationModule.attenuateAudioCue(audioCue)
        outputAudio = audioFrame + audioCue
    } else {
        outputAudio = audioFrame
    }

    // 6. Output Modified Audio
    outputAudio = BeamformingAttenuationModule.applyBeamforming(outputAudio)
    sendAudioToSpeaker(outputAudio)
} else {
    // Normal noise cancellation processing
    sendAudioToSpeaker(processNoiseCancellation(audioFrame))
}

```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced communication in noisy environments (e.g., airports, trains, busy offices).
*   Improved accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.
*   Emergency alert systems – highlight critical information over background noise.
*   Training & education – focus attention on key phrases during lectures or demonstrations.
