# 10952307

## Adaptive Ambient Projection System

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual light source control to encompass dynamic ambient projection, responding to both sensor input and networked device states to create immersive and reactive environments.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** "Ambient Core" - A central processing unit with integrated wireless transceiver, high-lumen micro-projector array (minimum 4, ideally 16+), and broad-spectrum light sensor.
*   **Networking:** Compatible with existing system (patent 10952307) – receives sensor data and control signals.  Also broadcasts its status and projection data.
*   **Projection Surface:** Designed for use with designated, light-diffusing surfaces (e.g., specially treated wall paint, translucent panels). Surfaces can be any shape or size.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Utilizes sensor data (motion, ambient light) from networked devices AND its own internal light/motion sensor.
*   **Dynamic Projection Mapping:** Algorithms create dynamic projection maps based on sensor input, device states, and user-defined parameters.
*   **Projection Modes:**
    *   **Reactive Ambient:** Projects patterns and colors responding to detected motion or light changes.  (e.g., a ‘flowing water’ effect triggered by nearby movement).
    *   **Contextual Information:** Displays relevant data (e.g., weather, time, notifications) through subtle visual cues.
    *   **Simulated Environments:** Creates the illusion of extended space or alters the perceived atmosphere (e.g., simulating a forest canopy, projecting a 'fireplace' effect).
    *   **Gamified Interactions:**  Turns the environment into an interactive play space (e.g., projecting targets for a laser pointer, creating a virtual ‘maze’ on the floor).
*   **User Control:** Mobile app or voice control for customization.
    *   Scene creation/editing (define projection patterns, colors, responsiveness).
    *   Device grouping and control.
    *   Networked integration (connect to other smart home devices).
*   **Power:**  AC power supply with PoE (Power over Ethernet) option for simplified installation.

**Pseudocode (Core Functionality - Reactive Ambient):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Get Sensor Data
    motionDetected = getMotionFromNetworkDevices() || getMotionFromInternalSensor();
    ambientLightLevel = getAmbientLightLevel();

    // Determine Projection Parameters
    if (motionDetected) {
        pattern = "flowingWaves";
        color = getRandomColor();
        intensity = map(ambientLightLevel, 0, 100, 20, 100); //Dimmer in bright light
    } else {
        pattern = "softGlow";
        color = "#FFFFFF";
        intensity = 50;
    }

    // Render Projection
    renderProjection(pattern, color, intensity);

    delay(10); //Adjust as needed
}
```

**Hardware Components (Beyond Core):**

*   **Wide-angle lens array:** for projectors to maximize coverage.
*   **Integrated calibration system:** For automated projection alignment and distortion correction.
*   **Optional depth sensor:** Enable more advanced interactions and spatial mapping.
