## Modular Propeller Guard System with Dynamic Aerofoil Shaping

**Concept:** Expand upon the adjustable wing/tailplane configurations by implementing a fully modular propeller guard system that isn't limited to extending/retracting existing wing/tailplane surfaces. This system uses independently controlled, small aerofoil sections (think miniature wings) which can dynamically assemble *around* the propellers, forming a protective shroud. These 'guardlets' are not rigidly attached to the main wing/tail, but are controlled by a dedicated micro-actuator network.

**Specs:**

*   **Guardlet Dimensions:** 10cm x 5cm x 1cm (variable depending on aerial vehicle scale). Constructed from lightweight carbon fiber composite. Each guardlet has a slightly concave surface facing the propeller.
*   **Actuation:** Each guardlet is connected to a 3-DoF micro-actuator (piezoelectric or miniature linear servo). This allows for independent control of pitch, yaw, and extension/retraction.  Actuators are embedded *within* the aerial vehicleâ€™s structure (wings, fuselage) for minimized drag when retracted.
*   **Guardlet Attachment:** Magnetic quick-release system. Guardlets are held in place by strong neodymium magnets embedded in both the guardlet and the aerial vehicle's body. This allows for rapid deployment/retraction and easy maintenance/replacement.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Each guardlet includes a micro-proximity sensor (infrared or ultrasonic) to detect obstacles and automatically adjust position for optimal protection.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller manages the guardlet array. Control algorithm prioritizes:
    *   Full propeller coverage in low-speed/hovering modes.
    *   Minimal drag in high-speed/horizontal flight (guardlets fully retracted or streamlined).
    *   Obstacle avoidance (real-time adjustment of guardlet positions).
*   **Power:** Dedicated micro-battery pack integrated into the wing/fuselage to power the guardlet actuators and sensors. Rechargeable via standard aerial vehicle charging system.
*   **Modular Design:** Guardlets are designed to be interchangeable. Different guardlet shapes/sizes can be used to optimize protection for different propeller types or operating conditions.
*   **Material:** Carbon fiber composite with a flexible polymer coating for impact resistance.

**Pseudocode for Control Algorithm:**

```
// Inputs:
//   propeller_speed
//   vehicle_speed
//   altitude
//   obstacle_distances[]
//   current_guardlet_positions[]

// Outputs:
//   target_guardlet_positions[]

function calculate_guardlet_positions():

  if (vehicle_speed < 5 m/s and altitude < 10m): //Low speed/hover mode
    //Deploy full guardlet coverage around propellers
    target_guardlet_positions = full_coverage_configuration
  else: //High speed/horizontal flight
    //Retract guardlets for minimal drag
    target_guardlet_positions = retracted_configuration

  //Obstacle avoidance
  for each obstacle in obstacle_distances:
    if (obstacle_distance < 20cm):
      //Adjust guardlet positions to shield propeller from obstacle
      target_guardlet_positions = adjust_positions_for_obstacle(obstacle_location)

  return target_guardlet_positions
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Explore the use of shape memory alloys (SMA) as an alternative actuation method.
*   Integrate machine learning algorithms to predict potential obstacles and proactively adjust guardlet positions.
*   Develop a self-healing material for the guardlet surfaces to improve durability.
*   Consider using a distributed sensor network on the guardlets to provide more accurate obstacle detection.
*   Investigate the possibility of using the guardlets as miniature control surfaces to enhance aerial vehicle maneuverability.
