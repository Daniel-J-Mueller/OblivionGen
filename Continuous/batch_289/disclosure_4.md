## Adaptive Data Sharding with Dynamic Key Rotation

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of encrypting data before server storage by introducing adaptive data sharding *combined* with continuous, dynamic key rotation, tailored to data access patterns and threat modeling.  Instead of a single encryption key per authorized user, implement a system where data is split into shards, each encrypted with a unique, short-lived key. Key access is managed by a decentralized, blockchain-inspired access control list (ACL).

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sharding & Encryption Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream (any type).
*   **Process:**
    *   Data is split into N shards (N configurable, dynamically adjusted based on data size & access frequency).
    *   Each shard is encrypted with a unique, randomly generated Symmetric Key (AES-256 preferred).
    *   Metadata (shard ID, encryption key ID, access control list ID) is generated for each shard.
    *   Shards & metadata are packaged for transmission.
*   **Output:** Encrypted shards and associated metadata.

**2. Key Management & Rotation System:**

*   **Key Generation:**  Utilize a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for secure key generation.  Each key has a limited Time-To-Live (TTL) configurable from minutes to hours.
*   **Decentralized ACL:** Implement a distributed, tamper-proof ACL based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) data structure. Nodes represent users/groups and their access permissions for specific encrypted shards.  Utilize a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus algorithm for ACL updates.
*   **Key Encryption:**  Each shard's encryption key is itself encrypted using a Key Encryption Key (KEK).  Each authorized user possesses a KEK.  The system supports key delegation, where a user can delegate their decryption privileges to another user.
*   **Automated Key Rotation:**  A scheduler periodically rotates encryption keys. New keys are generated, and data is re-encrypted (in the background). Old keys are securely destroyed.

**3. Data Storage & Retrieval Module:**

*   **Storage:** Shards are stored across multiple geographically distributed servers.  Erasure coding is used for data redundancy and fault tolerance.
*   **Retrieval:**
    1.  User requests data.
    2.  System identifies shards containing the requested data.
    3.  System queries the ACL to determine which shards the user is authorized to access.
    4.  System retrieves authorized shards from storage.
    5.  System retrieves corresponding encryption keys from the Key Management System.
    6.  System decrypts shards.
    7.  System reassembles decrypted shards to reconstruct the original data.

**4. Dynamic Shard Adjustment:**

*   **Access Pattern Monitoring:** Track data access patterns.  Identify frequently accessed data and infrequently accessed data.
*   **Shard Size Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjust shard sizes based on access frequency. Frequently accessed data is stored in smaller shards for faster retrieval. Infrequently accessed data is stored in larger shards to reduce storage overhead.
*   **Shard Replication:**  Replicate frequently accessed shards across multiple servers to improve performance and availability.

**Pseudocode (Key Retrieval):**

```
function getEncryptionKey(shardID, userID):
  aclID = getACLIDForShard(shardID)
  permissions = queryACL(aclID, userID)
  if permissions.canDecrypt:
    keyID = getKeyIDForShard(shardID)
    encryptedKey = retrieveEncryptedKey(keyID)
    decryptedKey = decryptKey(encryptedKey, userID.KEK)
    return decryptedKey
  else:
    return null // Access denied
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Auditing:** Implement comprehensive auditing of all key management and data access operations.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to scale horizontally to accommodate growing data volumes and user base.
*   **Integration with Existing Systems:** Provide APIs for seamless integration with existing applications and infrastructure.
*   **Quantum Resistance:** Explore the use of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms to protect against future threats.
