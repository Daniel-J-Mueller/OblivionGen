## Dynamic Workflow "Heatmaps" with Predictive Branching

**Concept:** Extend the workflow visualization beyond simply *showing* what happened, to *predicting* likely future paths based on aggregated user behavior. This creates a dynamic "heatmap" overlaid on the workflow visualization, guiding service representatives towards the most effective resolution strategies.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Collect workflow data as per the original patent: navigation events, screen captures, keystroke logs.
    *   Introduce a “resolution flag” – a binary indicator (success/failure) associated with each completed workflow session.
    *   Augment the data store with session metadata: user role, product type, issue category.
*   **Behavioral Analysis Module:**
    *   Algorithm: Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical workflow data.
    *   Input: Sequence of network pages visited (encoded numerically), session metadata.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over the next possible network pages.  Higher probabilities indicate more likely subsequent steps.
    *   Training: Continuous training/retraining based on new data to adapt to evolving workflows and resolutions.
*   **Visualization Extension:**
    *   Overlaid Heatmap:  On top of the existing workflow visualization, display a heatmap representing the RNN’s probability distribution.
        *   Color Intensity:  Brighter colors indicate higher probability.
        *   Dynamic Updates:  The heatmap updates *in real-time* as the service representative navigates the workflow, reflecting the predicted likelihood of each subsequent step.
    *   Branch Prediction Lines: Draw faint, predictive lines extending from the current visual element to the most likely next elements, showing the anticipated flow. These lines fade as probability decreases.
    *   "Deviation Indicator": Display a visual cue (e.g., a highlighted border) on visual elements representing steps where the current session deviates significantly from the predicted norm.
*   **Representative Interface:**
    *   Optional Overlay Toggle: Allow the service representative to toggle the heatmap overlay on/off for a cleaner view when necessary.
    *   Confidence Level Display: Show a numerical confidence level associated with the predicted next step.
    *   "Alternative Path" Suggestion:  If the confidence level is low, suggest alternative, less probable paths that have historically led to successful resolutions.
*   **Pseudocode (Behavioral Analysis Module):**

```
// Function: AnalyzeWorkflow(session_data)
// Input:  session_data - current workflow session's navigation events
// Output: probability_distribution - probability of next network page

function AnalyzeWorkflow(session_data) {

  encoded_session = EncodeNetworkPages(session_data); // Convert page names to numerical IDs
  input_vector =  [encoded_session, session_metadata]; // Combine encoded session and metadata

  prediction = RNN(input_vector);  // Run RNN model

  probability_distribution = Softmax(prediction); // Normalize to get probabilities

  return probability_distribution;
}
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond a purely historical visualization. It *proactively* guides the user with predictive insights based on aggregate data, potentially improving resolution times and service quality. The dynamic heatmap and branch prediction create a novel, intelligent user interface.
