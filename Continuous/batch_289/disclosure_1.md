## Dynamic Load Shaping via Predictive Modeling

**Specification:** A system to dynamically shape load tests based on predicted service behavior, moving beyond fixed TPS or duration parameters.

**Core Concept:** Instead of prescribing a static load profile (e.g., 100 TPS for 5 minutes), the system *learns* the expected service response under varying load and proactively adjusts the test load to reveal performance bottlenecks *before* they manifest as failures. This uses a predictive model built upon historical load test data and, crucially, real-time production telemetry.

**Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Ingestion:** System consumes real-time metrics from the production service – request latency, error rates, CPU/Memory usage, queue depths.  This forms the 'ground truth' for model training and dynamic adjustment.
2.  **Historical Load Test Database:** Stores data from *all* previous load tests – load profiles applied, resulting metrics, identified bottlenecks.  Acts as a knowledge base.
3.  **Predictive Model:**  A time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet, or a custom neural network) trained on the combined historical load test and production telemetry data.  Predicts service behavior (latency, error rates) under *new*, unseen load conditions.  The model outputs a predicted performance curve for a given load profile.
4.  **Load Shaping Engine:**  The core component.  It receives the predicted performance curve from the Predictive Model and *dynamically adjusts* the load test parameters (TPS, concurrency) to achieve specific goals:
    *   **Bottleneck Discovery:**  Proactively increase load until a predicted performance degradation (e.g., latency exceeding a threshold) is observed, pinpointing the limiting factor.
    *   **Stress Testing:**  Drive the service towards its breaking point, identifying the maximum sustainable load.
    *   **Capacity Planning:**  Estimate the service’s capacity under predicted future production load.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The results of each dynamic load test (observed metrics) are fed back into the Historical Load Test Database to continuously improve the Predictive Model’s accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Load Shaping Engine):**

```
function shape_load(target_performance_metric, threshold, current_load):
    predicted_performance = PredictiveModel.predict(current_load)

    if predicted_performance < threshold:
        //Increase load to find the breaking point
        new_load = current_load * 1.1  //Increase by 10%

    elif predicted_performance > target_performance_metric:
        //Reduce load to maintain stability
        new_load = current_load * 0.9 //Reduce by 10%
    else:
        //Maintain current load
        new_load = current_load

    //Apply new_load to the load test generator
    LoadTestGenerator.set_load(new_load)
    return new_load
```

**Deployment:** This system could be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.  After each code change, a dynamic load test is run, automatically adjusting the load to find potential regressions or performance improvements.

**Novelty:** The combination of real-time production telemetry, historical load test data, a predictive model, and a dynamic load shaping engine creates a proactive and intelligent load testing system far beyond traditional fixed-profile approaches. This system can adapt to the specific characteristics of each service and uncover bottlenecks that would be missed by static tests.
