## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend touch target optimization beyond visual adjustments to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a more intuitive and accurate touch experience. The system will dynamically adjust not only the *size* of touch targets but also the intensity and texture of haptic feedback delivered through the touchscreen.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Haptic Profile Database:**  A database storing haptic profiles categorized by display element type (buttons, links, sliders, etc.) and device type. Each profile defines a range of haptic feedback parameters – intensity, frequency, waveform, and duration.

2.  **User Interaction Monitoring:** Continuously monitor user interactions – touch location, pressure, speed, dwell time – and correlate these with visual touch target adjustments made by the existing system.  Crucially, also track *missed* touch attempts – where the user intends to select an element but touches nearby.

3.  **Haptic Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   If the existing system increases a touch target’s size, *also* increase the intensity of haptic feedback when the user’s finger nears the enlarged target.
    *   For frequently missed targets, introduce a subtle “attraction” effect –  a slight increase in haptic feedback intensity as the user’s finger *approaches* the intended target, even before contact. This isn't a forceful pull, but a gentle guide.
    *   For small, densely packed elements (e.g., radio buttons), use distinct haptic *textures* to differentiate them.  A button might have a short, crisp pulse, while a slider provides a continuous, textured vibration.
    *   Dynamically adjust haptic feedback based on *swipe* speed. Fast swipes might receive minimal feedback, while slow, deliberate touches trigger more pronounced responses.

4.  **Device-Specific Calibration:**
    *   Each device model will have a calibration profile to account for variations in touchscreen hardware and haptic actuator performance.
    *   A brief user calibration sequence (run once per device) will optimize haptic feedback levels based on individual user preferences and finger characteristics.

5.  **System Architecture:**
    *   The existing touch target optimization system will be extended with a “Haptic Control Module.”
    *   The Haptic Control Module will interface with the touchscreen’s haptic actuator driver.
    *   User interaction data and touch target adjustment information will be passed from the existing system to the Haptic Control Module.
    *   The Haptic Control Module will generate haptic control signals and transmit them to the touchscreen.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
function adjustHaptics(touchTarget, userInteractionData):
  targetSizeAdjustment = getTargetSizeAdjustment(touchTarget)
  missedTouchAttempts = getMissedTouchAttempts(touchTarget)

  hapticIntensity = baseHapticIntensity
  hapticTexture = defaultHapticTexture

  if targetSizeAdjustment > 0:
    hapticIntensity += (targetSizeAdjustment * intensityScaleFactor)

  if missedTouchAttempts > threshold:
    hapticAttraction = calculateAttractionForce(userInteractionData)
    hapticIntensity += hapticAttraction

  if displayElementType == "radio_button":
    hapticTexture = radioButtonTexture

  // Apply Calibration
  hapticIntensity = calibrateHapticIntensity(hapticIntensity, userCalibrationProfile)

  // Send haptic control signals to touchscreen
  sendHapticSignals(hapticIntensity, hapticTexture)

```
