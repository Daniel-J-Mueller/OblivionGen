## Dynamic Highlight ‘Ecosystem’ – Shared & Evolving Annotations

**Concept:** Extend personal and popular highlights into a dynamic, interconnected “ecosystem” where highlights aren’t static, but *evolve* based on user interactions and external data feeds.

**Specs:**

**1. Highlight ‘Lifespan’ & Decay:**

*   Each highlight (personal or popular) possesses a configurable lifespan. After expiration, the highlight’s visual prominence *decreases* – color fades, opacity reduces, etc. – but doesn’t disappear entirely. It becomes a ‘ghost’ highlight, still visible but less intrusive.
*   Lifespan is user-definable (hours, days, weeks, indefinite). Popular highlights’ lifespan is determined by a community average or algorithm (more interactions = longer lifespan).

**2. ‘Highlight Seeds’ & Propagation:**

*   Users can designate highlights as ‘seeds.’ Seeds are highlights intended to *grow* based on related content.
*   The system scans the current content *and* external data sources (news articles, academic papers, social media) for information *related* to the highlighted passage.
*   When related information is found, the system automatically generates *linked annotations* that appear as extensions of the original highlight. These extensions are visually distinct (e.g., branching lines, smaller text) and contain summaries of the linked information with sources.
*   Users can approve/reject/edit linked annotations.  Approved annotations contribute to a ‘knowledge graph’ associated with the highlighted passage.

**3. ‘Highlight Remixing’ & Collaborative Evolution:**

*   Users can ‘remix’ existing highlights (personal or popular). Remixing allows combining multiple highlights into a single, more complex annotation.
*   Remixed highlights are versioned, allowing users to revert to previous versions or explore different interpretations.
*   Remixes are shareable, creating a collaborative annotation chain.
*   The system tracks the lineage of remixes, providing a visual representation of the evolution of a particular idea or concept.

**4. ‘Sentiment Analysis’ & Highlight Coloring:**

*   The system performs sentiment analysis on the highlighted passage *and* any linked annotations.
*   The highlight’s color is dynamically adjusted to reflect the overall sentiment (e.g., green for positive, red for negative, blue for neutral).
*   Users can override the automated sentiment coloring.

**Pseudocode (Highlight Evolution):**

```
function evolveHighlight(highlight, content, externalData):
  lifespanCheck(highlight) // Reduce prominence if expired

  relatedInfo = findRelatedInfo(highlight.passage, content, externalData)

  for info in relatedInfo:
    newAnnotation = createAnnotation(info)
    linkAnnotation(highlight, newAnnotation)

  sentiment = analyzeSentiment(highlight.passage + getAnnotationsText(highlight))
  highlight.color = getColorFromSentiment(sentiment)
end function
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Requires a robust natural language processing (NLP) engine for finding related information and performing sentiment analysis.
*   Needs a scalable data storage solution for managing the growing knowledge graph of linked annotations.
*   User interface should provide clear visual cues for indicating the lifespan, sentiment, and lineage of highlights.
*   External data sources should be configurable (e.g., user-defined URLs, APIs).
