## Temporal Data Shadows & Predictive Conflict Resolution

**Concept:** Expand the idea of a merge signature to include not just *what* changed, but *when* those changes were likely to be requested/committed *from the perspective of the client*.  This enables a form of predictive conflict resolution.

**Specification:**

**1. Client-Side Timestamping & Shadowing:**

*   Each client application interacting with the database will maintain a local “request timestamp” for every data modification operation (read, write, delete).  This timestamp represents when the client *initiated* the operation, *not* when it was committed.
*   Alongside the standard transaction data, each client will also transmit a "shadow record".  The shadow record consists of:
    *   Transaction ID.
    *   Operation Type (Read, Write, Delete).
    *   Data Key(s) affected.
    *   Client-Initiated Timestamp.
    *   Estimated Completion Time (based on network latency/processing estimates).

**2. Server-Side Temporal Merge Signature:**

*   The server’s merge signature will be extended to include temporal information.  Instead of simply a list of sequence numbers representing committed operations, it will become a *temporal range map*.
*   Temporal Range Map Structure:  A data structure associating sequence number ranges with time intervals.  Each entry will be:
    *   Start Time: Earliest client-initiated timestamp for operations within the range.
    *   End Time: Latest client-initiated timestamp for operations within the range.
    *   Sequence Number Range:  Start Sequence Number – End Sequence Number.
*   The server aggregates client shadow records, constructing this temporal map.

**3. Predictive Conflict Detection & Resolution:**

*   Upon receiving a new transaction:
    1.  The server analyzes the transaction’s data keys and operation type.
    2.  It queries the temporal merge signature for overlapping time intervals and sequence number ranges.
    3.  If overlaps are detected:
        *   A "Conflict Probability Score" is calculated, based on:
            *   Degree of temporal overlap.
            *   Type of operation (Writes have higher conflict probability than Reads).
            *   Number of concurrent clients.
        *   Based on the score, the server can take proactive steps:
            *   **Optimistic Locking:**  Assume no conflict and proceed with the transaction.  Monitor for conflicts during commit.
            *   **Preemptive Retry:**  Immediately retry the transaction with a modified request.
            *   **Client Notification:**  Alert the client about potential conflicts.
            *   **Stall:** Pause transaction processing until conflict window closes.

**4. Pseudocode (Conflict Probability Calculation):**

```
function calculateConflictProbability(transaction, temporalMap):
    overlapScore = 0
    for key in transaction.dataKeys:
        for entry in temporalMap:
            if key in entry.dataKeys and transaction.time < entry.endTime and transaction.time > entry.startTime:
                overlapScore += 1
    operationWeight = {
        "Read": 0.1,
        "Write": 0.9,
        "Delete": 0.9
    }
    concurrentClients = getNumberOfConcurrentClients()
    probability = (overlapScore * operationWeight[transaction.operation]) / concurrentClients
    return probability
```

**5. Implementation Notes:**

*   The temporal merge signature will require a robust indexing scheme to allow efficient range queries.  A B-tree or similar structure is recommended.
*   The client-side timestamping must be synchronized (using NTP or similar) to minimize skew.
*   The threshold for conflict probability will need to be tuned based on the specific application and workload.
*   Additional metadata could be added to the shadow record, such as the client’s geographical location or the type of device being used, to further refine the conflict probability calculation.
