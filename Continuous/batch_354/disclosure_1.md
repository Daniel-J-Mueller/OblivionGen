## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Antenna Array

**Concept:** Leverage the conductive structure's resonant frequency characteristics, not just for signal reception/transmission and sensing, but as the core of an adaptive antenna array. This goes beyond a single multi-functional element to a dynamically configurable array.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Architecture:** A grid or tessellated arrangement of conductive structures, each individually addressable. Minimum 3x3 array, scalable.
*   **Material:** Conductive structures composed of a shape-memory alloy (SMA) overlaid with a highly conductive material (e.g., copper, silver).
*   **Actuation:** Micro-actuators (piezoelectric or micro-electromechanical systems - MEMS) bonded to the SMA. These actuate the SMA, subtly altering the shape and thus the resonant frequency of each conductive structure.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller with a real-time operating system (RTOS). This handles the following:
    *   **Frequency Scanning:**  The controller sweeps the resonant frequencies of the array elements.
    *   **Beamforming:**  Algorithmically adjusts the phase and amplitude of signals transmitted/received by each element to create a focused beam in a desired direction.
    *   **Environmental Mapping:** Uses the proximity/touch sensing capabilities of each element *in conjunction with* the frequency shift to create a localized environmental map.  Changes in proximity cause slight resonant frequency shifts – this data adds another layer to the mapping.
    *   **Self-Calibration:**  A built-in routine to compensate for manufacturing variations and temperature-induced frequency drift.
*   **Frequency Range:** Primary operating range: 1.5 GHz - 2.5 GHz (expandable via software).  Secondary sensing range: kHz frequencies (as per patent).
*   **Power:** Low-power consumption design, optimized for mobile applications.  Energy harvesting via ambient RF signals considered.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Beamforming):**

```
// Array Dimensions
arrayWidth = 3
arrayHeight = 3

// Target Angle (degrees)
targetAngle = 45

// Calculate Phase Shift for each element
for i = 0 to arrayWidth - 1
  for j = 0 to arrayHeight - 1
    distance = i + j // Simplified distance calculation
    phaseShift[i][j] = (distance * sin(targetAngle)) / wavelength 
    // wavelength = speed of light / frequency 
end for

// Signal Processing 
for i = 0 to arrayWidth - 1
  for j = 0 to arrayHeight - 1
    elementSignal = receiveSignal(i, j) 
    phaseShiftedSignal = applyPhaseShift(elementSignal, phaseShift[i][j])
    summedSignal += phaseShiftedSignal
end for

outputSignal = summedSignal / (arrayWidth * arrayHeight)
```

**Innovation Detail:** This differs from existing antenna arrays by integrating resonant frequency tuning *directly into* the antenna element itself. The SMA/actuator combination enables a much faster and more precise frequency adjustment compared to traditional mechanically steered arrays.  Combining this with the proximity/touch sensing creates a truly multi-functional surface – an antenna that also “sees” its environment.  The environmental mapping aspect could enable gesture recognition, object identification, and even basic imaging.
