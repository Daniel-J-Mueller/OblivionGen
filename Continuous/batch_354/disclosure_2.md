## Adaptive Container Geometry System

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on jam clearing *within* fixed-geometry containers. This design proposes actively reshaping containers *around* items to prevent jams and optimize space utilization.

**Specs:**

*   **Container Material:** Shape-memory polymer (SMP) composite with embedded micro-actuators and tactile sensors. The SMP provides structural integrity while allowing controlled deformation.
*   **Actuation:** Each container incorporates a mesh of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or micro-electromechanical systems - MEMS) controlled by a local microcontroller. These actuators create localized pressure, enabling the SMP to bulge, retract, or otherwise change shape.
*   **Sensor Network:** A dense array of tactile sensors embedded within the SMP continuously monitors the pressure distribution from the contained item.
*   **Control System:** A central control system (or distributed edge computing) receives sensor data and calculates optimal container geometry. This system uses machine learning algorithms trained on item profiles (size, shape, fragility) and jam prediction models.
*   **Container Frame:** Each SMP container is housed within a rigid, but low-friction, frame. This frame maintains overall structural stability and guides the SMP deformation.
*   **Item Profiling:** A preliminary scan (camera/laser) determines item dimensions and fragility *before* placement. This data feeds the control system.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously adjusts container shape *during* the filling/sorting process based on sensor feedback and predicted jam risks.
*   **Power/Data:** Wireless power transfer (inductive coupling) and data communication (Bluetooth/Zigbee) eliminate the need for physical connections to each container.

**Operation:**

1.  **Item Scan:** Item enters the system, undergoing a brief scan to determine size, shape, and fragility.
2.  **Initial Shape:** Control system calculates an initial container shape optimized for the item. Micro-actuators deform the SMP accordingly.
3.  **Real-time Adjustment:** Tactile sensors monitor pressure distribution. If sensors detect uneven pressure, a potential jam, or an opportunity to optimize space, the control system adjusts actuator signals, reshaping the container.
4.  **Jam Prevention:** By proactively adapting to the item's geometry, the system minimizes the risk of jams.
5.  **Space Optimization:**  The system can dynamically reduce container volume around the item, maximizing storage density.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Input: Item Profile (size, shape, fragility)
// Input: Sensor Data (pressure distribution from container)

function calculateContainerShape(itemProfile, sensorData) {

  //Predict potential Jam Points
  predictedJamPoints = predictJams(itemProfile);

  //Adjust Container Shape to avoid jam points
  containerShape = initialShape;

  //Iterate through the Sensor Data
  for each sensor reading in sensorData {

    if (sensor reading > pressureThreshold) {

      //Adjust Container to relieve pressure.
      actuatorSignals = calculateActuatorSignals(sensorLocation, pressureDifference);
      applyActuatorSignals(actuatorSignals);
    }
  }

  //Space Optimization
  optimizedShape = optimizeSpace(containerShape);
  return optimizedShape;
}

function applyActuatorSignals(signals) {
  //Send signals to the micro-actuators
}

function predictJams(itemProfile) {
 //Machine Learning algorithm predicts jam locations
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Self-healing Materials:** Incorporate self-healing polymers to repair minor damage to the SMP.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate haptic feedback to alert operators to potential issues.
*   **AI-Powered Learning:**  Train the AI model on a vast dataset of item profiles and jam events to continuously improve jam prediction and prevention accuracy.
*   **Automated Container Cleaning**: Internal coating to avoid stickiness.
