**Dynamic Encryption Sharding with Temporal Key Decay**

**Concept:** Expand upon the layered encryption scheme by introducing dynamic sharding of the encrypted file *before* upload, combined with a temporal decay mechanism for encryption keys. This dramatically increases security and mitigates risk even if a single key is compromised.

**Specifications:**

1.  **File Pre-Processing (Client-Side):**
    *   Upon user selection, the file is split into *n* shards. *n* is a configurable value (default: 10-20), determined by file size and sensitivity level.
    *   Each shard is encrypted with a unique, randomly generated symmetric key (AES-256).
    *   A master metadata file is created. This file contains:
        *   List of all shard locations (within the encrypted file repository).
        *   Encryption key for *each* shard.
        *   A “Key Assembly Key” (KAK) – used to encrypt the individual shard keys.
        *   A temporal decay schedule for the KAK.

2.  **Secure Repository Interaction:**
    *   All shards and the master metadata file are uploaded to the secure repository.
    *   The repository assigns random file names and locations as per the existing patent.
    *   The system acknowledges successful upload and provides the shard/metadata locations.

3.  **Transmission & Decryption (Receiver-Side):**
    *   The encrypted metadata file (containing encrypted shard keys) is transmitted to the intended receiver.
    *   The receiver decrypts the metadata using their device key and the public component (as described in the provided patent).
    *   The receiver retrieves all shards from the repository.
    *   The receiver decrypts each shard using the corresponding key from the decrypted metadata.
    *   Shards are reassembled into the original file.

4.  **Temporal Key Decay:**
    *   The KAK has an associated time-to-live (TTL). After the TTL expires, the KAK is automatically destroyed on the server.
    *   If a receiver requests the file *after* the KAK’s TTL expires, the system rejects the request, rendering the shards unrecoverable.
    *   The system can offer options for extending the KAK’s TTL (with appropriate authentication) or creating a new KAK.

5.  **Dynamic Shard Count:**
    *   The number of shards (*n*) is not fixed. It can be dynamically adjusted based on file sensitivity, user preference, or system load. A higher *n* provides greater security, but also increases computational overhead.

**Pseudocode (Key Decay Implementation - Server-Side):**

```
function storeMetadata(metadata, KAK, TTL):
  # Encrypt the metadata with KAK
  encryptedMetadata = encrypt(metadata, KAK)
  store(encryptedMetadata)

  # Schedule KAK deletion
  scheduleTask(deleteKAK, KAK, TTL)

function deleteKAK(KAK):
  # Remove KAK from storage
  delete(KAK)
  # Log deletion event
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   The KAK must be securely generated and stored.
*   The TTL should be carefully chosen based on the file’s sensitivity and intended lifespan.
*   Robust access controls are essential to prevent unauthorized access to the KAK.
*   Key rotation policies should be implemented to further enhance security.
