## Temporal Knowledge Graph Completion with Probabilistic Reasoning

**Concept:** Extend the knowledge graph completion process to incorporate temporal information and probabilistic reasoning about the *reliability* of information sourced from external documents. The existing patent focuses on identifying missing facts. This expands it to assess *when* a fact is true and *how confident* we are in that truth.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Temporal Fact:** A triple `(entity, relation, value, timestamp, confidence)` where:
    *   `entity`, `relation`, `value` are standard knowledge graph elements.
    *   `timestamp` represents the time the fact is considered valid (e.g., start and end date).  Can be a range, or a single point in time.
    *   `confidence` is a probability score (0.0 to 1.0) representing the reliability of the fact.
*   **Source Metadata:** For each fact sourced from a document, store:
    *   `document_id`: Unique identifier for the document.
    *   `extraction_method`: How the fact was extracted (e.g., rule-based, machine learning model).
    *   `extraction_score`: Score assigned by the extraction method.
    *   `document_relevance_score`: A score representing how relevant the document is to the entity/relation being considered.

**2. Algorithm:**

*   **Phase 1: Temporal Fact Extraction:**
    1.  Identify missing relations for entities as described in the base patent.
    2.  For each missing relation, formulate search queries, but *also* incorporate temporal constraints.  E.g., “\[entity] \[relation] \[value] before \[date]” or “\[entity] \[relation] \[value] between \[date1] and \[date2]”.
    3.  Search web documents and extract potential facts, along with associated timestamps (if present) and source metadata.

*   **Phase 2: Confidence Estimation:**
    1.  **Base Confidence:** Calculate a base confidence score for each extracted fact based on:
        *   `extraction_score`
        *   `document_relevance_score`
        *   A pre-defined quality score for the source document (e.g., based on domain authority, trustworthiness).
    2.  **Temporal Decay:** Apply a temporal decay function to reduce confidence over time.  Facts become less reliable the further they are in the past.  The decay rate can be tuned based on the type of relation. Example: `confidence = confidence * exp(-decay_rate * (current_time - timestamp))`
    3.  **Conflict Resolution:** If multiple facts exist for the same entity, relation, and timestamp, combine their confidence scores using a weighted average (e.g., weighted by source quality).
    4.  **Probabilistic Fact Storage:** Store the fact with its calculated confidence score in the temporal knowledge graph.

*   **Phase 3: Temporal Reasoning & Querying:**
    1.  **Temporal Constraints:**  Support queries with temporal constraints (e.g., “What was \[entity]'s \[relation] as of \[date]?”).
    2.  **Confidence Thresholding:**  Allow users to specify a minimum confidence threshold for query results.
    3.  **Trend Analysis:** Analyze the evolution of facts over time to identify trends and patterns.
    4.  **Prediction:** Using the collected data, attempt to predict future values of certain relations based on past trends and confidence levels.

**3. Pseudocode (Confidence Estimation):**

```pseudocode
function calculate_confidence(extracted_fact, source_metadata):
  base_confidence = (source_metadata.extraction_score * weight_extraction) + \
                   (source_metadata.document_relevance_score * weight_relevance) + \
                   (source_metadata.document_quality * weight_quality)

  timestamp = extracted_fact.timestamp
  time_difference = current_time - timestamp
  temporal_decay = exp(-decay_rate * time_difference)

  confidence = base_confidence * temporal_decay

  return confidence
```

**4.  Engineer Deliverables:**

*   Implement the data structures for Temporal Facts and Source Metadata.
*   Develop the Confidence Estimation algorithm and integrate it into the existing knowledge graph completion pipeline.
*   Create a query engine that supports temporal constraints and confidence thresholding.
*   Build a visualization tool to explore the evolution of facts over time.

This expands the system beyond simply *finding* missing facts, to assessing *when* those facts are true and *how sure* we are about them – a crucial step for building a more reliable and trustworthy knowledge base.
