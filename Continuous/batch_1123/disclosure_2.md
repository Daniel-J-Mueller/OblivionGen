**Adaptive UI Mirroring with Predictive Assistance**

**Concept:** Extend screen sharing beyond simple mirroring. Implement a system that *predicts* user intent on the assisted device and proactively overlays augmented reality (AR) guidance onto the user’s screen, visible *only* to the remote assistant.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Functionality:**  Mirror the UI of the user’s device (phone, tablet, laptop) to a remote device. This is a baseline, similar to existing screen sharing.
*   **Intent Prediction Engine:**  A machine learning model trained on user interaction data (taps, swipes, voice commands, app usage patterns) to predict the *next* likely action.  This model must operate on the assisted device itself, *before* data is sent.
*   **AR Overlay Generation:** Based on the intent prediction, generate an AR overlay.  This overlay isn't displayed on the user's device. Instead, it's rendered *only* on the remote assistant's screen. Examples:
    *   **Navigation App:** If the model predicts the user is about to input a destination, highlight the search bar on the remote screen, anticipating the action.
    *   **Shopping App:** When the model detects a product being viewed, overlay potential “add to cart” or “compare” buttons on the remote screen.
    *   **Generic UI:**  Highlight likely interactive elements (buttons, fields) based on contextual analysis.
*   **Confidence Threshold:**  The AR overlay only appears on the remote screen if the intent prediction confidence exceeds a configurable threshold.
*   **Remote Control Integration:** The remote assistant can still take full control of the user's device (as in the original patent), but the AR overlay offers a passive, predictive assistance mode.
*   **Data Transmission:** Minimal data is transmitted – primarily the screen content and intent prediction confidence score.  The AR overlay rendering is done entirely on the remote device.
*   **Privacy Consideration:** The intent prediction model operates locally. No user interaction data is sent to the remote server.  Data is strictly limited to screen content and model confidence.
*   **User Opt-In:** The user must explicitly opt-in to enable the predictive assistance feature.

**Pseudocode (assisted device):**

```
loop:
  capture_screen()
  user_interaction = get_user_interaction()
  intent_prediction = predict_intent(user_interaction, historical_data)
  intent_confidence = intent_prediction.confidence

  if intent_confidence > confidence_threshold:
    ar_overlay_data = generate_ar_overlay(intent_prediction.predicted_action)
  else:
    ar_overlay_data = null

  send_screen_data(screen_data)
  send_ar_overlay_data(ar_overlay_data)
end loop
```

**Pseudocode (remote device):**

```
loop:
  screen_data = receive_screen_data()
  ar_overlay_data = receive_ar_overlay_data()

  if ar_overlay_data != null:
    render_ar_overlay(screen_data, ar_overlay_data)
  
  display_screen_data(screen_data)
end loop
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Assisted device: Sufficient processing power for local ML model execution.
*   Remote device:  AR rendering capabilities (depending on overlay complexity).

**Potential Applications:**

*   Remote technical support with proactive guidance.
*   Assisting elderly or less tech-savvy users.
*   Remote training and demonstration.
*   Accessibility features for users with disabilities.
