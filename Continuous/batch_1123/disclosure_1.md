## Adaptive Message Resonance

**Concept:** Expand the selective message delivery system to incorporate *resonance* â€“ dynamically adjusting message content *before* delivery based on recipient device state and predicted behavioral response. This moves beyond simple routing to active message shaping.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Resonance Engine:** A module integrated with the message processing service. It receives the processed message *before* publication and incorporates resonance logic.
*   **Device State Repository:** A persistent store containing real-time and historical data about each registered device. This includes:
    *   Resource availability (CPU, memory, bandwidth)
    *   Application context (currently running apps, user interaction)
    *   Historical response data (message acceptance rates, processing times, error rates)
    *   Predicted behavioral model (AI/ML based, estimating response to different message characteristics)
*   **Resonance Profile Database:** A collection of pre-defined or dynamically generated profiles outlining how to modify messages for different recipient states and predicted responses. These profiles specify:
    *   Message compression levels
    *   Data payload prioritization
    *   Request/Response flag toggling
    *   Content simplification/abstraction
    *   Redundancy levels (error correction)
    *   Delivery scheduling/batching parameters.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  Message Processing Service receives a message and identifies the target subset of devices (as per the existing patent).
2.  *Before* publishing, the message is routed to the Resonance Engine.
3.  The Resonance Engine queries the Device State Repository for each recipient device's current state.
4.  Based on device state and a predictive model, the Engine selects an appropriate Resonance Profile for that device.
5.  The Engine modifies the message payload and metadata according to the selected Resonance Profile.
6.  The modified message is published on the second topic.

**III. Pseudocode (Resonance Engine Core):**

```pseudocode
function modifyMessage(message, recipientDeviceID) {

    deviceState = getDeviceState(recipientDeviceID)
    resonanceProfile = selectResonanceProfile(deviceState)

    modifiedMessage = message.clone()

    // Apply Resonance Profile Transformations
    modifiedMessage.compressionLevel = resonanceProfile.compressionLevel
    modifiedMessage.payloadPriority = resonanceProfile.payloadPriority
    modifiedMessage.redundancyLevel = resonanceProfile.redundancyLevel

    if (resonanceProfile.simplifyPayload) {
        modifiedMessage.payload = simplifyPayload(modifiedMessage.payload)
    }

    if (resonanceProfile.batchDelivery) {
        addMessageToBatch(modifiedMessage) //Handles queuing for batching
        return //Do not immediately publish
    }

    publishMessage(modifiedMessage)
}
```

**IV.  Expansion Paths:**

*   **Dynamic Profile Generation:** Employ reinforcement learning to automatically refine Resonance Profiles based on observed device behavior.
*   **Cross-Device Resonance:**  Adjust message content not only for individual devices but also to optimize the collective response of a network.
*   **Predictive Maintenance Triggering:**  Shape messages to proactively trigger diagnostic routines on recipient devices based on predicted failure rates.
*    **A/B testing**: Test message variations for certain recipient types to improve response and performance.
