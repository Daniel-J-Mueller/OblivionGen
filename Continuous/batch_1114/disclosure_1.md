## Autonomous Drone Swarm for Dynamic Site Mapping & Anomaly Detection

**System Overview:** A multi-drone system leveraging the barcode/matrix code detection outlined in the provided patent, but expanding beyond static surveillance to create a real-time, dynamically updating 3D map of a site, identifying discrepancies against expected configurations.

**Core Components:**

*   **Drone Fleet:** Small, agile drones equipped with high-resolution cameras and barcode/matrix code readers. Each drone has a unique device identifier (IP address as suggested in the patent).
*   **Ground Control Station (GCS):** Centralized system for mission planning, drone control, data ingestion, and visualization.
*   **Persistent Data Structure:**  A spatial database (e.g., a point cloud database with associated metadata) storing 3D map data, drone positions, detected barcode/matrix code locations, and expected site configurations.
*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection Engine:** Analyzes the real-time 3D map against a baseline model of expected configurations, flagging anomalies.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initial Site Scan & Baseline Creation:** The drone swarm performs an initial scan of the site.  As drones capture images, they decode matrix barcodes or other machine-readable targets.  This data is used to create a 3D point cloud map and define an “expected” configuration.  For example, each barcode might identify a piece of equipment, its expected location, and its operational status.  The GCS stores this data in the persistent data structure.
2.  **Continuous Monitoring & Dynamic Mapping:**  Drones autonomously patrol the site, continually updating the 3D map. As they scan, they detect matrix barcodes and compare the detected locations with the expected locations stored in the data structure.
3.  **Anomaly Detection:** The AI Engine analyzes deviations between the real-time map and the baseline configuration.  Anomalies could include:
    *   Misplaced equipment (barcode detected in an unexpected location).
    *   Missing equipment (barcode not detected when expected).
    *   Unexpected changes to equipment status (decoded data indicates a different configuration than expected).
    *   Obstructions blocking expected views.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
function detectAnomaly(currentFrameData, baselineData):
  // currentFrameData:  Data from the drone's current scan (3D point cloud, decoded barcodes)
  // baselineData:  Expected site configuration (3D model, barcode locations, statuses)

  anomalies = []

  // Iterate through expected barcode locations in baselineData
  for each expectedBarcode in baselineData:
    // Find the closest barcode in currentFrameData
    closestBarcode = findClosestBarcode(currentFrameData, expectedBarcode.location)

    // Check if a barcode was found within a tolerance
    if closestBarcode == null or distance(closestBarcode.location, expectedBarcode.location) > tolerance:
      anomalies.append({
        type: "Misplaced/Missing Equipment",
        expectedLocation: expectedBarcode.location,
        actualLocation: closestBarcode?.location ?? null
      })

    //Compare decoded configuration data
    if closestBarcode != null and closestBarcode.configuration != expectedBarcode.configuration:
        anomalies.append({
            type: "Configuration Change",
            expectedConfiguration: expectedBarcode.configuration,
            actualConfiguration: closestBarcode.configuration
        })

  // Check for obstructions by comparing depth maps (point clouds)
  obstructions = detectObstructions(currentFrameData.pointCloud, baselineData.expectedView)

  if obstructions.length > 0:
    anomalies.append({
      type: "Obstruction",
      locations: obstructions
    })

  return anomalies
```

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Drone Payload:** High-resolution camera (4K or higher), LiDAR/depth sensor, onboard processing unit (edge computing).
*   **Communication:** Secure wireless communication (e.g., 5G, dedicated RF link) between drones and GCS.
*   **Data Storage:** Scalable cloud storage for 3D maps and anomaly data.
*   **AI Engine:** Deep learning models trained on site-specific data for accurate anomaly detection.
*   **Mapping Resolution:** Configurable mapping resolution (e.g., 1cm to 10cm accuracy).

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond static surveillance to create a dynamic, continuously updated digital twin of the site. The combination of barcode/matrix code detection, real-time 3D mapping, and AI-powered anomaly detection enables proactive maintenance, security monitoring, and operational optimization. This is fundamentally different from simply identifying objects in an image; it’s about understanding the *relationship* between objects and their expected configurations within a defined space.
