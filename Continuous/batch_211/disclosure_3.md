## Adaptive Biometric Payload Fragmentation & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the secure transmission concept to accommodate variable bandwidth/intermittent connectivity scenarios by fragmenting biometric payloads and reconstructing them on the server-side. This isn’t just about smaller packets; it's about *intelligent* fragmentation guided by real-time network conditions *and* biometric data priority.

**Specifications:**

**I. Device-Side (Biometric Acquisition Unit - BAU)**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Biometric Sensor (existing - e.g., fingerprint, iris scanner).
    *   Cryptographic Processor (as per patent – secure key storage).
    *   Connectivity Monitor (WiFi, Bluetooth, Cellular - measures RSSI, latency, packet loss).
    *   Fragmenter Module (dedicated hardware or firmware).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Biometric Data Prioritization Engine:** Assigns priority levels to different biometric features (e.g., minutiae points vs. overall ridge pattern for fingerprint).  Higher priority data gets preferential fragmentation treatment.
    *   **Adaptive Fragmentation Algorithm:**
        1.  Acquire raw biometric data.
        2.  Apply priority levels to data segments.
        3.  Monitor network conditions via Connectivity Monitor.
        4.  Dynamically adjust fragment size based on network stability.
            *   Stable connection: Larger fragments for efficiency.
            *   Unstable connection: Smaller fragments for resilience.  Priority segments *always* get smaller fragment sizes.
        5.  Encrypt each fragment using a session key derived from the primary encryption key.
        6.  Digitally sign each fragment using the primary encryption key (from secure storage).
        7.  Add sequence numbers and total fragment count to each fragment.
        8.  Transmit fragments via the mutually authenticated channel.
*   **Pseudocode (Fragmentation):**

```
function fragmentPayload(rawBiometricData, networkConditions, primaryEncryptionKey):
  priorityMap = assignPriority(rawBiometricData)
  fragmentSize = determineFragmentSize(networkConditions)
  fragments = []
  fragmentCount = 0
  for segment in segment(rawBiometricData):
    priority = priorityMap[segment]
    fragmentSizeAdjusted = adjustFragmentSizeForPriority(fragmentSize, priority)
    encryptedSegment = encrypt(segment, deriveSessionKey(primaryEncryptionKey))
    signedSegment = sign(encryptedSegment, primaryEncryptionKey)
    fragment = {
      sequenceNumber: fragmentCount,
      totalFragments: len(rawBiometricData),
      payload: signedSegment
    }
    fragments.append(fragment)
    fragmentCount += 1
  return fragments
```

**II. Server-Side (Authentication & Reconstruction Unit - ARU)**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Cryptographic Processor (for key management & signature verification).
    *   Reconstruction Module (dedicated hardware or firmware).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Fragment Receiver:** Receives signed, encrypted fragments.
    *   **Signature Verifier:** Verifies the digital signature on each fragment using the established primary encryption key. Fragments with invalid signatures are discarded.
    *   **Decryption Module:** Decrypts fragments using the session key derived from the primary encryption key.
    *   **Reconstruction Engine:**
        1.  Buffers incoming fragments.
        2.  Checks for missing fragments based on sequence numbers and total fragment count. Requests retransmission of missing fragments.
        3.  Once all fragments are received, reassembles the original biometric payload.
        4.  Performs final biometric analysis on the reconstructed payload.
*   **Pseudocode (Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructPayload(fragmentStream, primaryEncryptionKey):
  fragments = []
  expectedSequence = 0
  while fragmentStream:
    fragment = fragmentStream.next()
    if fragment.sequenceNumber == expectedSequence:
      if verifySignature(fragment.payload, primaryEncryptionKey):
        encryptedPayload = decrypt(fragment.payload, deriveSessionKey(primaryEncryptionKey))
        fragments.append(encryptedPayload)
        expectedSequence += 1
      else:
        log("Signature verification failed for fragment " + fragment.sequenceNumber)
    else:
      log("Missing fragment " + expectedSequence + " received " + fragment.sequenceNumber)
      # Request retransmission
  if len(fragments) == expectedSequence:
    reconstructedPayload = concatenate(fragments)
    return reconstructedPayload
  else:
    log("Reconstruction failed. Missing or corrupt fragments.")
    return None
```

**III. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Fragment Loss Handling:** Implement a Forward Error Correction (FEC) scheme to mitigate fragment loss without requiring retransmission.  Add redundant data to certain fragments based on priority.
*   **Prioritization Algorithms:** Experiment with different biometric data prioritization schemes.  Higher priority should be given to unique and difficult-to-spoof features.
*   **Adaptive FEC:** Dynamically adjust the FEC redundancy based on network conditions and the criticality of the biometric data.
*   **Timestamping:** Include timestamps in fragments to detect and mitigate replay attacks.
*   **Multi-Channel Support:** Leverage multiple communication channels simultaneously to improve reliability and bandwidth.
