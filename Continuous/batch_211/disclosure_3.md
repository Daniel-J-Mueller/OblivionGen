**Adaptive Network Prioritization based on User Behavior & Predicted Congestion**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Instead of static or periodically updated preferred network lists, the system dynamically adjusts network prioritization *in real-time* based on individual user behavior *and* predicted network congestion. This goes beyond simply identifying 'good' vs. 'bad' networks; it anticipates network performance *before* connection attempts.

**II. Data Acquisition & Analysis:**

*   **User Behavioral Data:**  Collect data on app usage, data consumption patterns, frequently visited websites/services, and time of day usage for each user.  This data is *local* to the device initially.
*   **Crowdsourced Network Performance:** Aggregate anonymized network performance data (latency, throughput, packet loss) from *all* users in a geographic area.  This forms a real-time, hyper-local “heat map” of network performance.  Privacy is paramount – data must be fully anonymized and aggregated.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained on historical network performance data, current usage patterns, and time of day to *predict* network congestion levels.  This model should predict performance for the *next* 5-15 minutes.
*   **Service-Level Prioritization:** Users can assign priority levels to specific apps or services (e.g., "High" for video conferencing, "Medium" for email, "Low" for background updates).

**III.  Algorithm & Prioritization Logic:**

1.  **Base Score:**  Each network is assigned a base score based on historical performance and roaming agreements (similar to existing systems).
2.  **Behavioral Modifier:**  Adjust the base score based on the user’s current app usage.  If the user is on a video call, networks with low latency receive a significant boost.
3.  **Congestion Prediction:**  Apply a modifier based on the predicted congestion level for each network in the user's location.  Networks predicted to be heavily congested receive a penalty.
4.  **Service-Level Adjustment:** Further modify scores based on assigned priority levels. High priority apps give more weight to low latency and high throughput.
5.  **Dynamic List Generation:** Create a prioritized list of networks based on the adjusted scores. This list is refreshed every few seconds.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```
//Network Data Structure
struct Network {
    ID : Integer;
    BaseScore : Float;
    PredictedCongestion : Float (0-1, 1 = heavily congested);
    Latency : Float;
    Throughput : Float;
}

//User Data Structure
struct User {
    CurrentApp : String;
    AppPriority : Integer (1-3, 1 = High, 3 = Low);
}

function generatePrioritizedNetworkList(Network[] availableNetworks, User currentUser) {

    for (Network network : availableNetworks) {
        network.adjustedScore = network.BaseScore;

        //Apply congestion penalty
        network.adjustedScore -= network.PredictedCongestion * 0.5;

        //Apply app priority modifier
        if (currentUser.CurrentApp == "VideoCall") {
            network.adjustedScore += (1 - network.PredictedCongestion) * 0.3; //Boost low latency
        }

        //Adjust based on overall priority
        network.adjustedScore += (3 - currentUser.AppPriority) * 0.1;
    }

    //Sort networks by adjusted score (descending)
    sort(availableNetworks, by adjustedScore);

    return availableNetworks;
}
```

**V. Implementation Details:**

*   **Edge Computing:** Perform congestion prediction and prioritization on the device itself (where possible) to reduce latency and reliance on network connectivity.
*   **Federated Learning:**  Improve the accuracy of the congestion prediction model by using federated learning to train the model on data from multiple devices *without* sharing the raw data.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Implement strict privacy controls to ensure that user data is anonymized and aggregated.  Provide users with control over their data collection preferences.
