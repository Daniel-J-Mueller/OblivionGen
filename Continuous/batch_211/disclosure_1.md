## Dynamic Credential Aging with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:**

This system enhances credential rotation by dynamically adjusting the rotation frequency based on real-time behavioral biometric analysis of the user. Instead of fixed rotation intervals or purely random additive numbers, the system monitors user interaction patterns – keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, touch pressure, and even subtle variations in typing rhythm – to assess the risk level associated with the current session. 

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometric Sensor Suite:** Software component integrated into the client application capturing the specified biometric data during user interaction. Data is collected passively without requiring explicit user actions.
2.  **Risk Engine:** A machine learning model trained on a dataset of legitimate and fraudulent user behaviors. The Risk Engine analyzes the data stream from the Behavioral Biometric Sensor Suite in real-time, generating a continuous risk score.
3.  **Adaptive Rotation Controller:**  This module receives the risk score from the Risk Engine and dynamically adjusts the additive number used in the credential rotation process.  Higher risk scores translate to more frequent credential rotations (smaller additive numbers or more iterations), while lower risk scores allow for less frequent rotations (larger additive numbers or fewer iterations).
4.  **Credential Rotation Module:** This module is identical to that described in the referenced patent, but utilizes the dynamically adjusted additive number provided by the Adaptive Rotation Controller.

**Workflow:**

1.  User initiates a session with the client application.
2.  Behavioral Biometric Sensor Suite begins collecting data.
3.  Risk Engine analyzes the data and generates a risk score.
4.  Adaptive Rotation Controller receives the risk score and calculates the appropriate additive number for the current credential rotation.
5.  Credential Rotation Module executes the rotation process using the calculated additive number.
6.  Steps 2-5 repeat continuously throughout the session, adjusting the rotation frequency in real-time based on the user's behavior.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Rotation Controller):**

```
function calculate_additive_number(risk_score):
  // Define risk thresholds and corresponding additive number ranges
  low_risk_threshold = 0.2
  medium_risk_threshold = 0.5
  high_risk_threshold = 0.8

  // Define the range of possible additive numbers.
  min_additive_number = 1 
  max_additive_number = 100

  if risk_score <= low_risk_threshold:
    additive_number = max_additive_number # Low risk, infrequent rotation
  else if risk_score <= medium_risk_threshold:
    additive_number = int(max_additive_number * (1 - (risk_score - low_risk_threshold) / (medium_risk_threshold - low_risk_threshold))) # Moderate risk, intermediate rotation
  else:
    additive_number = min_additive_number # High risk, frequent rotation
  
  return additive_number
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond static or random credential rotation to a *proactive*, *behavior-driven* approach. By continuously assessing risk, it can significantly reduce the burden on legitimate users while simultaneously increasing security against unauthorized access. This also provides a means to tune rotation frequency based on user experience. A user who is obviously themselves might have less frequent rotations, while someone behaving strangely will have them more often.
