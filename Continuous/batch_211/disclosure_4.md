## Adaptive Privacy Zones & Behavioral Learning

**Concept:** Extend the motion detection/alert system to incorporate behavioral learning and dynamically adjust privacy zones based on observed user behavior *and* contextual awareness. This moves beyond simple radius definitions to a proactive, intelligent privacy system.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing A/V device with motion sensors & camera. Add a low-power edge TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for on-device machine learning. Microphone array for audio context analysis.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Behavioral Engine:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on anonymized user activity data (motion patterns, audio cues – laughter, speech, silence, etc.). The RNN predicts likely activity zones *before* motion is detected.  Initial training data is pre-loaded; ongoing learning adapts to individual user habits.
    *   **Contextual Analyzer:** Access to external data sources: time of day, weather, calendar events (with user permission). Example: if the calendar shows a “meeting” scheduled and the weather is inclement, the system anticipates activity *inside* the home and adjusts sensitivity/zones accordingly.
    *   **Dynamic Zone Manager:**  Based on Behavioral Engine & Contextual Analyzer output, this module generates a probability map of likely activity. This map dictates the sensitivity and alert thresholds for different zones within the camera’s field of view.  Zones are not static; they continuously morph based on predicted behavior.
    *   **Privacy Filter:** A real-time image processing module. When motion is detected *outside* the high-probability zones, this filter applies a configurable level of obfuscation (blurring, pixelation, color distortion) to the video stream *before* it’s sent/recorded.  User selectable filter strength.  Can operate in “alert only” mode (alert is suppressed, video recorded normally).
    *   **User Interface:** Mobile app or web portal.
        *   Visualization of probability map overlaid on camera feed.
        *   Adjustable filter strength & alert settings per zone.
        *   Option to “teach” the system specific behaviors (e.g., "When I'm cooking, the kitchen is a high-priority zone.").
        *   Privacy mode selector (off, alert only, filter on).

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Zone Manager):**

```
function update_zones(current_time, weather_data, calendar_events, behavioral_prediction):
    // Blend behavioral prediction with contextual data
    contextual_weight = calculate_contextual_weight(weather_data, calendar_events)
    blended_prediction = (1 - contextual_weight) * behavioral_prediction + contextual_weight * contextual_data

    // Normalize blended prediction to create probability map
    probability_map = normalize(blended_prediction)

    // Apply thresholding to define high/low probability zones
    high_probability_zones = regions_above_threshold(probability_map, threshold=0.7)
    low_probability_zones = regions_below_threshold(probability_map, threshold=0.3)

    return high_probability_zones, low_probability_zones

function calculate_contextual_weight(weather_data, calendar_events):
    // Weight based on confidence level of context.  (e.g. a firm calendar appointment is high confidence)
    weight = 0.0
    if(calendar_events != NULL){
        weight += 0.5 * confidence(calendar_events);
    }
    if(weather_data != NULL){
        weight += 0.2 * confidence(weather_data);
    }
    return weight;
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond static zones and predefined radii to a predictive privacy system that learns user behavior and adapts dynamically. It integrates contextual awareness for increased accuracy and provides granular control over privacy levels. The on-device learning minimizes latency and bandwidth usage, while preserving user privacy.
