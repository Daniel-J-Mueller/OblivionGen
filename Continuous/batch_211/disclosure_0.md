## Dynamic Predictive Stitching with Environmental Context

**Concept:** Extend the field-of-view merging concept by incorporating real-time environmental data – not just visual alignment, but *predictive* alignment based on known spatial relationships and object permanence. Instead of solely reacting to detected matches, anticipate where objects *will* be in the combined view and proactively stitch based on that prediction.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), GPS, and potentially LiDAR or depth sensors into each image capture device.
*   **Environmental Mapping:** Each device maintains a localized environmental map (point cloud or similar) that is continuously updated. This map focuses on static elements – buildings, trees, ground plane, etc. – to provide a stable reference frame.
*   **Object Tracking & Prediction:** Implement robust object tracking algorithms.  Extend this to predictive modeling – estimate the future trajectory of moving objects (vehicles, pedestrians). Kalman filters or similar techniques are appropriate.
*   **Stitching Engine:** 
    *   **Phase 1: Static Alignment:**  Initially align based on static environmental map features. This provides a coarse but stable base.
    *   **Phase 2: Dynamic Prediction & Stitching:**  For each frame:
        *   Predict object positions in the combined view based on tracking data.
        *   Use these predicted positions as anchor points for stitching.  
        *   Employ a weighted blending approach.  Give higher weight to areas with strong feature matches *and* high prediction confidence.
    *   **Phase 3: Refinement:** Continuously refine the stitch based on incoming visual data and updated predictions.
*   **Data Fusion:** Implement a Kalman filter (or equivalent) to fuse data from all sensors (IMU, GPS, vision, LiDAR) to create a unified state estimate for each device. This provides a robust and accurate pose estimate, even in challenging conditions (e.g., GPS denial, poor lighting).
*   **Communication Protocol:**  A low-latency, high-bandwidth communication link between the image capture devices is essential for real-time data exchange.  Wi-Fi 6E or 5G are potential options.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Engine - Core Logic):**

```
function stitch_frames(frame1, frame2, state_estimate1, state_estimate2):
  # state_estimate: Contains pose (position, orientation) + object tracking data

  # 1. Static Alignment (Initial coarse alignment based on environmental map)
  aligned_frame2 = align_using_static_map(frame2, frame1, state_estimate1, state_estimate2)

  # 2. Dynamic Prediction & Stitching
  predicted_object_positions = predict_object_positions(state_estimate1, state_estimate2)

  stitch_mask = create_stitch_mask(frame1, aligned_frame2, predicted_object_positions)  # Weight mask based on prediction confidence + feature matches

  merged_frame = blend_frames(frame1, aligned_frame2, stitch_mask)

  # 3. Refinement (Optional: Apply image enhancement/correction techniques)

  return merged_frame
```

**Innovation Notes:** 

*   This system moves beyond reactive stitching to proactive alignment.
*   By incorporating environmental context, it can handle more challenging scenarios (e.g., low texture, dynamic scenes).
*   The predictive element improves the smoothness and stability of the combined view.
*   Potential applications: Autonomous vehicles, drones, augmented reality, immersive video conferencing.
