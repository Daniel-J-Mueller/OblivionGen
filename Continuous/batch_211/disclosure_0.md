## Dynamic Object Masking & Relighting

**Core Concept:** Extend the image alignment and averaging to incorporate dynamic object masking and relighting based on identified object materials and environmental lighting estimation. This allows for not just stitching images together, but intelligently *reconstructing* scenes with improved realism and control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Object Material Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** A structured database storing material properties (reflectance, roughness, subsurface scattering, etc.) for common objects. This database is seeded with known values but dynamically updated via image analysis (see section 4). Material data is indexed by object type and potentially by specific instance (e.g., "wood - oak - sample1").
*   **Storage:** Cloud-based, accessible by all processing nodes.

**2. Environmental Lighting Estimation:**

*   **Input:** The set of images (reference and subsequent).
*   **Process:** Employ computer vision algorithms to estimate the direction and intensity of primary and secondary light sources within each image. This includes:
    *   Specular highlight detection.
    *   Shadow analysis.
    *   Color temperature estimation.
*   **Output:** A 3D lighting map representing the light environment at the time of capture.

**3. Dynamic Object Masking:**

*   **Input:** Set of images, 3D lighting map, material database.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Object Segmentation:** Utilize advanced object segmentation techniques (e.g., Mask R-CNN, Segment Anything Model) to identify and delineate objects in each image.
    *   **Material Assignment:** Based on identified object type and visual cues (color, texture), assign a material from the database. If the object is not recognized, trigger a material analysis process (see section 4).
    *   **Mask Generation:** Create a per-pixel alpha mask for each object, defining its boundaries.

**4. Material Analysis & Database Update:**

*   **Trigger:**  Unrecognized object in material assignment (section 3).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Specular/Diffuse Decomposition:** Analyze the object's reflectance patterns in multiple images to estimate specular and diffuse components.
    *   **BRDF Estimation:**  Approximate the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of the object's surface.
    *   **Material Creation/Update:** Based on the BRDF, create a new material entry in the database or refine an existing one.

**5. Image Averaging with Relighting:**

*   **Input:** Set of images, object masks, material properties, 3D lighting map.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Per-Object Processing:** For each object:
        *   Extract the object from each image using the generated mask.
        *   Apply a physically-based rendering (PBR) shader to the extracted object, using the estimated lighting map and material properties. This relights the object as if it were illuminated consistently across all images.
        *   Average the relit object from each image.
    *   **Composite Image Generation:**  Combine the averaged objects with the averaged background from the remaining image areas to create a final composite image.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function process_images(image_set):
  lighting_map = estimate_lighting(image_set)
  for each image in image_set:
    objects = segment_objects(image)
    for each object in objects:
      material = get_material(object)
      if material is null:
        material = analyze_material(object)
        add_material_to_database(material)
      masked_object = apply_mask(image, object)
      relit_object = render_with_lighting(masked_object, lighting_map, material)
      averaged_object += relit_object

  background = average_background(image_set)
  composite_image = combine(averaged_object, background)
  return composite_image
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration is crucial for rendering and image processing.
*   Cloud-based infrastructure for storage and parallel processing.
*   Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for object segmentation and material analysis.
*   Physically-based rendering engine (e.g., Unreal Engine, Unity) for relighting.
