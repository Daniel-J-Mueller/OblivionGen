## Autonomous Mobile Device - Acoustic Localization & Multi-Dock System

**Concept:** Extend docking capabilities beyond a single dock by implementing a system of distributed, acoustically-marked docking stations. Instead of relying solely on inductive sensors for *final* positioning, use a network of low-power acoustic beacons strategically placed within each dock, combined with an AMD equipped with an array of microphones. This allows for broader coverage, greater flexibility in dock placement, and facilitates a 'swarm' docking system for larger deployments.

**System Specs:**

*   **AMD Hardware:**
    *   Microphone Array: Minimum of 8 microphones arranged in a circular pattern on the AMD's underside, covering a 180-degree arc.  Sampling rate: 44.1kHz minimum.
    *   Acoustic Processing Unit: Dedicated DSP or FPGA for real-time audio processing.
    *   Inductive Sensors: Retain existing inductive sensors, but repurpose for *initial* proximity detection and coarse alignment.
    *   IMU: Existing IMU retained for stabilization and acceleration data.
*   **Dock Hardware:**
    *   Acoustic Beacons: Low-power, battery-operated ultrasonic beacons (frequency range: 18kHz – 22kHz) positioned within each dock. Each dock must have at least 3 beacons, arranged in a non-linear configuration to prevent ambiguity.
    *   Metallic Reflectors: Small metallic reflectors (e.g., aluminum tape) placed around the acoustic beacons to enhance signal clarity and directionality.
    *   Charging Contacts: Standard charging contacts, compatible with AMD battery system.
*   **Software/Algorithm (AMD):**
    1.  *Initial Approach:*  Use existing inductive sensors to detect the general vicinity of any dock within range.
    2.  *Acoustic Mapping:* Once in proximity, activate the microphone array and begin listening for acoustic beacons.
    3.  *Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) Calculation:* Using TDoA algorithms, calculate the AMD’s position relative to each beacon. Employ cross-correlation techniques for robust signal detection in noisy environments.
    4.  *Triangulation/Multilateration:* Using the calculated distances from multiple beacons, triangulate/multilaterate the AMD’s position within the dock.
    5.  *Fine Alignment:* Utilize the calculated position and orientation to guide the AMD into the final docked position, using a PID controller.
    6.  *Dock Selection (Swarm Docking):* If multiple docks are within range, implement an algorithm to select the optimal dock based on factors such as battery level, available bandwidth, and task prioritization.
    7.  *Collision Avoidance:* Incorporate a collision avoidance system based on IMU data and acoustic mapping to prevent collisions with obstacles or other AMDs.

**Pseudocode (Dock Selection & Approach):**

```
// AMD Core Logic

function scanForDocks():
    inductiveReadings = readInductiveSensors()
    if inductiveReadings > threshold:
        return true  // Dock in proximity
    else:
        return false

function acousticMapping():
    audioData = recordAudio(duration = 0.5)
    beaconLocations = identifyBeacons(audioData)
    return beaconLocations //list of [x,y,z] coordinates

function selectOptimalDock(beaconLocations):
    // Criteria: Battery Level (Dock), Bandwidth, Task Priority
    optimalDock = findBestDock(beaconLocations)
    return optimalDock

function approachDock(optimalDock):
    // Use TDoA/Triangulation to calculate relative position
    relativePosition = calculateRelativePosition(optimalDock)

    // PID Control
    steeringCommands = pidControl(relativePosition)

    // Execute steering commands
    moveAMD(steeringCommands)

    // Final Alignment (Inductive Sensors)
    fineTuneAlignment()

    // Dock and Charge
    dockAndCharge()
```

**Innovation:** Shifts the primary localization method from purely inductive to a hybrid inductive/acoustic system, allowing for greater flexibility, robustness, and scalability in docking scenarios. This is especially useful for environments where dock placement is constrained or dynamic. The multi-dock functionality enables a more efficient 'swarm' deployment of AMDs, optimizing resource utilization and task completion.
