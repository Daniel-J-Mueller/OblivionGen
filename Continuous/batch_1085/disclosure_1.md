## Adaptive Watermarking via Key-Dependent Fractal Decomposition

**Concept:** Extend the key-derived decryption process to embed a subtly unique, fractal-based watermark *within* the decrypted content. This watermark is not visible to the naked eye but is deeply integrated into the data itself, making it exceptionally resistant to traditional removal techniques. The fractal nature ensures the watermark's complexity and minimizes its impact on perceived quality.

**Specs:**

**1. Fractal Decomposition Module:**
   *   **Input:** Raw video/image frame.
   *   **Process:** Decompose the frame into a multi-resolution fractal representation using a modified fractal image compression algorithm (e.g., Partitioned Iterated Function Systems - PIFS). The level of decomposition (number of iterations, partition size) is determined by a key-derived parameter set.  This parameter set influences the 'granularity' of the fractal representation.
   *   **Output:** Fractal representation of the frame.

**2. Watermark Embedding Module:**
   *   **Input:** Fractal representation, Key, Watermark Data (e.g., Device ID, Timestamp, User ID - encoded as a bitstream).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Key-derived pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) creates a 'mask' based on the key.  The mask selects specific fractal domain blocks (partitions) for modification.
        *   Watermark data bits are mapped to subtle adjustments within the selected domain blocks. Adjustments include:
            *   Affine transformation parameter tweaking (rotation, scaling, translation).
            *   Palette adjustments (for indexed images).
            *   Slight modifications to fractal domain codebook values.
        *   The intensity of these adjustments is controlled by another key-derived parameter, balancing watermark strength and perceptual impact.
   *   **Output:** Watermarked Fractal Representation.

**3. Fractal Reconstruction & Decryption Module:**
   *   **Input:** Watermarked Fractal Representation, Key.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Uses the key to derive the correct parameters for the fractal reconstruction process.
        *   Reconstructs the image/video frame from the fractal representation.  The key-dependent parameters ensure the watermark is seamlessly integrated into the reconstructed frame.
        *   Standard decryption occurs *after* reconstruction (using techniques outlined in the original patent).
   *   **Output:** Decrypted, Watermarked Image/Video Frame.

**4. Watermark Extraction Module:**
    *   **Input:** Decrypted, Watermarked Image/Video Frame, Key.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Performs fractal decomposition on the decrypted frame.
        *   Uses the key to identify the modified fractal domain blocks.
        *   Extracts the watermark data from the subtle adjustments within those blocks.
    *   **Output:** Extracted Watermark Data.

**Pseudocode (Watermark Embedding):**

```
function embedWatermark(fractalRep, key, watermarkData):
  keyDerivedParams = deriveParameters(key)
  mask = generateMask(keyDerivedParams)
  adjustmentIntensity = keyDerivedParams.adjustmentIntensity

  bitIndex = 0
  for each domainBlock in fractalRep:
    if mask[domainBlock.index]:
      bit = watermarkData[bitIndex]
      adjustment = (bit == 1) ? adjustmentIntensity : -adjustmentIntensity
      domainBlock.affineTransform.translationX += adjustment
      bitIndex++
      if bitIndex >= watermarkData.length:
        break

  return fractalRep
```

**Key Considerations:**

*   The fractal decomposition algorithm must be robust to minor adjustments without significant quality loss.
*   The key derivation function must be designed to create a sufficiently complex and unpredictable mask.
*   The adjustment intensity must be carefully tuned to balance watermark strength and perceptual impact.
*   A robust error correction scheme should be incorporated into the watermark data.
