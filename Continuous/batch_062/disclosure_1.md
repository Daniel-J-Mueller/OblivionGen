## Dynamic Sensory Tagging & Projection

**Concept:** Extend the keyword/timecode mapping to *all* sensory data within the media file, and then dynamically project relevant sensory 'slices' onto external devices based on user context. 

**Specs:**

*   **Sensory Data Extraction Module:**
    *   Input: Media file (audio, video, potentially others – haptics, spatial data).
    *   Function: Extract all available sensory data streams. This goes beyond just audio transcripts. For video: object recognition, scene classification, facial expressions, color palettes. For spatial data (if available): 3D object models, point clouds, spatial audio cues.
    *   Output: Stream of tagged sensory data 'packets', each with a precise timecode and descriptive metadata.

*   **Contextual Awareness Engine:**
    *   Input: User device data (location, biometrics – heart rate, eye tracking, brainwave data via wearable, device orientation, ambient light levels, detected emotional state).
    *   Function: Analyze user context to determine relevant sensory preferences and needs. Example: User is stressed – prioritize calming visual elements and soothing audio cues. User is walking – prioritize spatial audio cues to enhance situational awareness. User is looking at a specific object – prioritize visual details of that object.
    *   Output: Contextual Sensory Profile (CSP) – a weighted list of preferred sensory attributes.

*   **Dynamic Sensory Projection System:**
    *   Input: CSP, Sensory Data Packets, User Request (e.g., "show me moments related to 'joy'").
    *   Function:
        1.  Query the Sensory Data Index (created from the Sensory Data Packets) based on the user request and the CSP.
        2.  Select the most relevant sensory data packets.
        3.  Dynamically project the selected sensory data onto external devices (smart glasses, augmented reality displays, haptic feedback suits, spatial audio systems). This projection is not limited to a simple 'playback' of the media file. It's a selective, context-aware rendering of specific sensory elements.

*   **Sensory Data Index:**
    *   Structure: Timecode -> (Sensory Data Type (audio, video, haptic, etc.), Data Payload, Descriptive Metadata, Relevance Score). The Relevance Score is dynamically adjusted based on the CSP.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Sensory Projection System):**

```
function ProjectSensoryData(userRequest, CSP, SensoryDataIndex):
  relevantPackets = []
  for packet in SensoryDataIndex:
    if packet.Metadata matches userRequest AND packet.RelevanceScore > threshold:
      relevantPackets.append(packet)

  relevantPackets.sort(by: RelevanceScore, descending: True)

  for packet in relevantPackets:
    if packet.SensoryDataType == "audio":
      PlayAudio(packet.DataPayload)
    elif packet.SensoryDataType == "video":
      DisplayVideo(packet.DataPayload)
    elif packet.SensoryDataType == "haptic":
      ApplyHapticFeedback(packet.DataPayload)
    # ... other sensory data types
```

**Innovation:** This extends the idea of keyword/timecode mapping from simply retrieving segments of a media file to dynamically constructing personalized sensory experiences. It leverages contextual awareness to deliver truly immersive and relevant content. It moves beyond "watching" or "listening" to "feeling" the media. This is applicable to entertainment, education, therapy, and accessibility.
