## Dynamic Resource Weighting via Client-Reported Resource Quality

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically weighting available CDN cache servers based on *real-time* quality metrics reported directly from client devices accessing content.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on server-side routing decisions based on bandwidth, cost, and susceptibility. This expands that by incorporating *client-experienced* quality, creating a feedback loop for more granular and responsive routing.

**Components:**

1.  **Client-Side Agent:** A lightweight Javascript or native agent embedded within client applications (web browsers, mobile apps). This agent continuously monitors key performance indicators (KPIs) related to content delivery:
    *   **Initial Load Time:** Time to first byte/pixel.
    *   **Buffering Rate:**  (For video/audio) Frequency and duration of buffering events.
    *   **Perceived Quality:**  (For video/audio)  Reported video quality level (e.g., 1080p, 720p, auto).
    *   **Error Rate:**  Number of failed content requests or segments.
    *   **Jitter:**  Variation in latency.

2.  **Quality Metric Aggregation Service:** A server-side component responsible for receiving and aggregating quality metric data from client agents. This service:
    *   **Time-Series Data Storage:** Stores quality metrics as time-series data, indexed by CDN cache server (IP address), content identifier, and geographic region.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies cache servers exhibiting consistently poor performance based on statistical analysis of received metrics.
    *   **Weight Calculation:**  Assigns a ‘weight’ to each cache server. Weights are dynamically adjusted based on aggregated quality metrics. Higher weights indicate better performance. Formula Example:  `Weight = BaseWeight * (1 - (AverageBufferingRate + ErrorRate))` (where BaseWeight is a default value, and buffering rate and error rate are normalized).

3.  **Modified DNS Resolution Service:**  The existing patent's DNS server is modified to incorporate server weights into its routing decisions.
    *   **Weighted Random Selection:** Instead of simply selecting the “best” server, the DNS server uses a weighted random selection algorithm to choose a cache server. Servers with higher weights have a proportionally greater chance of being selected.
    *   **A/B Testing Integration:** Allows for A/B testing of different weighting algorithms and threshold values to optimize performance.
    *   **Regional Granularity:** The system should support regional weighting.  Clients in a specific region should prioritize cache servers located in that region, even if those servers have slightly lower weights than servers in other regions.

**Pseudocode (DNS Resolution Service):**

```
function resolveDNSRequest(request):
  contentID = request.contentID
  clientLocation = request.clientLocation

  availableCacheServers = getAvailableCacheServers(contentID, clientLocation)

  // Apply regional preference (boost weight of nearby servers)
  for each server in availableCacheServers:
    if server.location == clientLocation:
      server.weight *= 1.2 // Example boost

  // Calculate total weight
  totalWeight = sum(server.weight for server in availableCacheServers)

  // Generate random number between 0 and totalWeight
  randomNumber = random.uniform(0, totalWeight)

  // Select cache server based on weighted random selection
  cumulativeWeight = 0
  for server in availableCacheServers:
    cumulativeWeight += server.weight
    if randomNumber <= cumulativeWeight:
      selectedCacheServer = server
      break

  return selectedCacheServer.IPAddress
```

**Innovation:**

*   **Client-Centric Optimization:** Moves beyond server-side metrics to directly optimize for the end-user experience.
*   **Adaptive Routing:**  Provides a more dynamic and responsive routing system that can adapt to changing network conditions and server performance.
*   **Proactive Problem Detection:**  Identifies and mitigates performance issues *before* they impact a large number of users.
