## Adaptive Region Proposal via Gaze-Contingent Enhancement

**Concept:** Expand the localized enhancement to actively *propose* regions for analysis based on user gaze and predictive modeling of likely content, preemptively enhancing those regions *before* the user explicitly focuses on them. This shifts from reactive enhancement to proactive, predictive enhancement.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing Camera System (as per patent).
*   Eye-tracking component (integrated or external - IR emitters/cameras, pupil tracking algorithms). Minimal resolution to accurately determine gaze point on the display.
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time gaze analysis and image processing.
*   Display screen.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Gaze Tracker Module:** Captures and processes eye-tracking data, determining gaze coordinates on the display screen in real-time. Outputs normalized gaze coordinates (0-1 range for x & y).
*   **Predictive Region Proposal Module:** This module utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on user interaction data (past gaze locations, areas of focus, content type, etc.).
    *   *Training Data:* Historical gaze data combined with ground truth annotations of important regions in images (e.g., text blocks, objects of interest).
    *   *Model Output:* Probability map indicating the likelihood of important content existing in various regions of the current image.  The map is spatially aligned with the image.
*   **Dynamic Region Enhancement Module:**  Receives the probability map from the Predictive Region Proposal Module.  Identifies regions exceeding a dynamically adjusted threshold. Dynamically adjusts this threshold based on factors like available processing power, battery life, and user preferences.
    *   Applies the localized image enhancement techniques described in the base patent (denoising, contrast stretching, etc.) to these proposed regions *before* the user's gaze actually lands on them.
*   **Fusion Module:** Combines the results of both the proactive enhancement (from proposed regions) and the reactive enhancement (triggered by direct gaze). Prioritizes regions enhanced proactively.
*   **OCR/Visual Recognition Interface:** Receives the enhanced images and processes them using the existing OCR/visual recognition engines.

**3. Algorithm/Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Train LSTM model on historical gaze and image data
Define enhancement parameters (denoising, contrast, etc.)
Set dynamic threshold for region proposal

// Real-time loop
Capture image from camera
Get gaze coordinates (x, y) from eye-tracker
Generate probability map using LSTM model based on image and gaze (x,y)
Identify regions exceeding dynamic threshold in probability map
Apply localized image enhancement to identified regions
If gaze coordinates fall within an enhanced region:
    Prioritize that region for OCR/visual recognition
Else:
    Apply reactive enhancement to region under gaze (as per original patent)
Process enhanced image with OCR/visual recognition engine
Update LSTM model with user interactions and new data
```

**4. Adaptive Thresholding Mechanism:**

*   The dynamic threshold is adjusted based on:
    *   **Processing Load:**  If CPU/GPU usage is high, increase the threshold to reduce the number of regions being enhanced.
    *   **Battery Level:**  Lower the threshold on low battery to conserve power.
    *   **User Preferences:**  Allow the user to configure a sensitivity setting for proactive enhancement.
    *   **Content Type:** Different thresholds for text, images, or mixed content.

**5. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-user adaptation:**  Train the LSTM model on data from multiple users to improve generalization.
*   **Contextual awareness:** Integrate information about the user's environment (location, time of day, etc.) to further refine the region proposal.
*   **Semantic segmentation:**  Combine region proposal with semantic segmentation to identify specific objects or elements within the image.
