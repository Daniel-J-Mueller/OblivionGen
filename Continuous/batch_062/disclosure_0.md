## Dynamic Feed Prioritization & “Pulse” Detection

**Concept:** Extend the feed monitoring beyond simply *detecting* a first referral. Introduce a system that dynamically prioritizes feeds based on real-time "pulse" detection – identifying bursts of activity within the referral network *before* a referral is even received. This allows for proactive resource allocation and potentially preemptive caching/pre-fetching of item data.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** “Pulse Listener” – a background application running alongside the Item Feed Application and Feed Monitoring Application.
*   **Data Source:** Referral Network API – Access real-time (or near real-time) activity data from the referral network. This isn’t limited to *referrals*; it includes metrics like page views of item listings, ‘add to cart’ events, search queries related to items in the feed, and user session activity.
*   **Pulse Calculation:** The Pulse Listener employs a time-series analysis algorithm (e.g., Exponential Weighted Moving Average - EWMA, or a more advanced anomaly detection technique) to calculate a “pulse score” for each item feed.  The score reflects the *rate of change* in the referral network activity – a rapidly increasing score indicates a surge in interest.  Consider weighting certain actions (e.g. ‘add to cart’) higher than others (e.g. page views).
*   **Dynamic Prioritization:**  The Item Feed Application uses the pulse scores to dynamically prioritize feed generation and transmission.  High-pulse feeds are generated and transmitted *more frequently* and potentially with *increased bandwidth allocation*. Lower-pulse feeds are generated less frequently.
*   **Pre-fetch Trigger:**  A threshold on the pulse score triggers a “pre-fetch” event. This causes the system to proactively retrieve the latest data for the items in the high-pulse feed (from the electronic commerce system) and cache it locally, anticipating a surge in referrals.
*   **Feedback Loop:** The Feed Monitoring Application contributes to the Pulse Listener’s calculations.  Confirmed referrals, processing delay times, and conversion rates are all fed back into the pulse calculation algorithm, refining its accuracy over time.
*   **Configuration:** The system includes a configurable “sensitivity” setting to control how aggressively feeds are prioritized. A lower sensitivity means the system will only prioritize feeds with very strong pulse signals.
*   **Alerting:**  An anomaly detection module flags unusually high or low pulse scores, potentially indicating a problem with the feed, the referral network, or a sudden shift in market demand.

**Pseudocode (Pulse Listener):**

```
// Initialize:
feed_pulse_scores = {} // Dictionary to store pulse scores for each feed
pulse_history = {} // Dictionary to store past pulse values for smoothing

// Every X seconds:
for each feed in active_feeds:
  // Get recent activity data from Referral Network API
  activity_data = get_referral_network_activity(feed_id)

  // Calculate pulse score (using EWMA or similar)
  pulse_score = calculate_pulse_score(activity_data, feed_pulse_scores[feed_id])

  // Update pulse history
  pulse_history[feed_id].append(pulse_score)

  // Store the updated pulse score
  feed_pulse_scores[feed_id] = pulse_score

  // Send updated pulse scores to Item Feed Application for prioritization
  send_pulse_scores(feed_pulse_scores)

  // Anomaly detection: check for unusual pulse score changes
  if is_anomaly(pulse_score):
      trigger_alert()
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Geographic Pulse:** Calculate pulse scores based on geographic location to identify regional trends.
*   **Personalized Pulse:**  Factor in user profiles and past purchase history to generate personalized pulse scores.
*   **Competitive Pulse:** Monitor competitor activity on the referral network to proactively adjust feed prioritization.
