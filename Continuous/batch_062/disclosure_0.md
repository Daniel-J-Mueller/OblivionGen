## Adaptive Certificate Revocation via Distributed Ledger

**Specification:** Implement a system where certificate revocation isn’t solely reliant on Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), but leverages a permissioned distributed ledger (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) for near-instantaneous revocation confirmation.

**Components:**

*   **Revocation Authority (RA):**  Entities authorized to submit revocation requests to the distributed ledger. These could be the original certificate issuers, or delegated authorities.
*   **Distributed Ledger (DL):** A permissioned blockchain storing a record of revoked certificates. Each entry includes the certificate serial number, revocation timestamp, and RA signature.
*   **Validator Nodes:**  Nodes within the DL network responsible for verifying and committing revocation transactions.
*   **Application Verification Module:** A component integrated into the application (described in the original patent) responsible for verifying certificate validity. It functions as follows:

    1.  Receive a certificate to be verified.
    2.  Check local cache for revocation status.
    3.  If not cached, query the distributed ledger for the certificate’s revocation status.
    4.  If the certificate is found in the DL as revoked, reject it.
    5.  If not found in the DL, consider it valid (pending CRL/OCSP fallback).
    6.  Cache the revocation status for a configurable duration.

**Pseudocode (Application Verification Module):**

```
function verifyCertificate(certificate):
  cacheKey = certificate.serialNumber
  cachedStatus = getCache(cacheKey)

  if cachedStatus != null:
    return cachedStatus

  revocationStatus = queryDistributedLedger(certificate.serialNumber)

  if revocationStatus == "REVOKED":
    setCache(cacheKey, "REVOKED", cacheDuration)
    return "REVOKED"

  #Fallback to CRL/OCSP (optional)
  if useFallback:
      fallbackStatus = checkCRL_OCSP(certificate)
      if fallbackStatus == "REVOKED":
          setCache(cacheKey, "REVOKED", cacheDuration)
          return "REVOKED"

  setCache(cacheKey, "VALID", cacheDuration)
  return "VALID"
```

**Data Structures (DL Entry):**

```
RevocationEntry {
    certificateSerialNumber: String,
    revocationTimestamp: Long,
    revocationAuthoritySignature: String,
    transactionID: String
}
```

**Network Interaction:**

1.  When a certificate needs to be revoked, the RA submits a transaction to the distributed ledger containing the certificate's serial number and a digitally signed revocation request.
2.  Validator nodes verify the RA’s signature and commit the revocation transaction to the ledger.
3.  Applications querying certificate validity contact the DL to check for revocation records.

**Enhancements:**

*   **Short-Lived Certificates:** Integrate with systems issuing short-lived certificates to minimize the impact of revocation.
*   **Privacy:** Implement privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., zero-knowledge proofs) to protect sensitive information stored on the DL.
*   **Interoperability:** Design the system to support multiple certificate authorities and distributed ledger platforms.
