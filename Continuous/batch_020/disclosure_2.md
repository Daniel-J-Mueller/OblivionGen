**Dynamic Encoding Recipe Composition via AI-Driven User Behavior Analysis**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**  An AI system which observes user interactions *across multiple* video delivery channels (not just within a single profile instantiation) to dynamically compose and optimize encoding "recipes" – parameter sets – in real-time.  This differs from the patent’s static profile/parameter approach. We’re building a system that *learns* optimal settings based on observed viewing habits, network conditions, and device capabilities *across the entire user base*.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collection Agent:**  A lightweight agent deployed on client devices (smart TVs, mobile phones, web browsers) that collects data points including:
    *   Buffering events (frequency, duration)
    *   Resolution switching events
    *   Frame rate drops
    *   Network bandwidth measurements
    *   Device model/capabilities
    *   Geographic location (coarse-grained)
    *   Time of day
*   **Centralized Data Lake:**  A scalable data store to ingest and store the collected behavioral data.
*   **AI-Powered Recipe Composer:** A machine learning model (e.g., reinforcement learning, Bayesian optimization) trained on the data lake to predict optimal encoding parameters (codec, bitrate, resolution, frame rate, etc.) given the observed user behavior and device characteristics.  It must support multi-objective optimization (balancing video quality, bandwidth usage, and computational cost).
*   **Dynamic Encoding Pipeline:** A video encoding pipeline that can ingest the AI-generated encoding parameters and dynamically adjust the encoding settings in real-time.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:**  A mechanism to continuously evaluate the performance of different encoding recipes and identify improvements.

**III.  Workflow:**

1.  **Data Collection:** The Behavioral Data Collection Agent gathers data from client devices.
2.  **Data Ingestion & Processing:** The data is ingested into the Data Lake and preprocessed (cleaned, transformed, aggregated).
3.  **Recipe Generation:** The AI-Powered Recipe Composer analyzes the data and generates optimized encoding recipes. These recipes are not tied to a specific channel profile upfront, but rather dynamically generated.
4.  **Pipeline Application:**  The Dynamic Encoding Pipeline applies the generated recipes to encode video content.
5.  **Real-time Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors user behavior and adjusts the encoding settings in real-time.
6.  **A/B Testing & Refinement:** The A/B Testing Framework evaluates the performance of different recipes and provides feedback to the AI model for further refinement.

**IV.  Pseudocode (Recipe Generation):**

```
function generate_recipe(user_behavior_data, device_capabilities, network_conditions):
  // Input: User viewing history, device specs, network stats
  // Output: Encoding parameters (codec, bitrate, resolution, etc.)

  // Feature engineering: Create relevant features from input data
  features = extract_features(user_behavior_data, device_capabilities, network_conditions)

  // Predict optimal encoding parameters using the AI model
  predicted_parameters = ai_model.predict(features)

  // Apply constraints and sanity checks
  final_parameters = apply_constraints(predicted_parameters)

  return final_parameters
```

**V. Novelty:**

The patent focuses on *parameterizing* existing profiles. This system *creates* the profiles dynamically based on observed behavior *across the entire user base*, not just within a single profile instantiation. It moves beyond static configuration to adaptive, data-driven optimization.  It’s a shift from a pre-defined configuration to a continuous learning system. We aren’t creating profiles, we are creating dynamic instructions to encode.
