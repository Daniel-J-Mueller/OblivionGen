## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted User Behavior Profiles

**Concept:** Extend predictive capacity management beyond program execution to proactively allocate resources based on *predicted user behavior* impacting resource demand, not just historical program usage. This aims to anticipate needs before programs even *start* consuming resources.

**Specs:**

**1. User Behavior Profiler Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** System logs (application usage, login times, data access patterns), network traffic analysis, potentially integrated data from user-facing applications (with appropriate privacy controls).
*   **Profiling Algorithm:** Hybrid approach –
    *   **Rule-Based System:** Initial configuration based on common user roles and expected activity (e.g., "Marketing User – High email/CRM usage during business hours").
    *   **Machine Learning Model (Recurrent Neural Network - LSTM):** Learns complex sequential patterns in user behavior. Input: Time-series data of resource requests (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) mapped to user IDs. Output: Predicted resource demand for the next *n* time intervals.
*   **Profile Storage:**  User profiles stored in a scalable NoSQL database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) – allows for rapid updates and retrieval. Each profile includes:
    *   Baseline Resource Demand (average usage)
    *   Activity Patterns (daily, weekly, monthly cycles)
    *   Anomaly Detection Thresholds (flags unusual activity)
    *   Predicted Demand Curve (output from LSTM)

**2. Predictive Resource Allocator Module:**

*   **Input:** User profiles (from User Behavior Profiler), Program Execution Predictions (from existing patent), Real-time Resource Availability.
*   **Resource Allocation Algorithm:**
    *   **Weighted Sum:** Combines predicted program execution capacity with predicted user behavior demand. Weights adjusted dynamically based on confidence levels (e.g., higher weight for program predictions if the program has a stable history).
    *   **Resource Negotiation:** If resource contention exists, the system prioritizes requests based on user roles, service-level agreements (SLAs), and predicted impact on overall system performance.
*   **Resource Provisioning:**
    *   **Dynamic VM Scaling:** Adjusts the number of virtual machines allocated to specific user groups based on predicted demand.
    *   **Container Orchestration (Kubernetes):**  Scales the number of container instances dynamically to match resource needs.
    *   **Storage Tiering:**  Moves data between different storage tiers (e.g., SSD, HDD) based on predicted access frequency.

**3. Feedback Loop & Adaptive Learning:**

*   **Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of resource utilization and application performance.
*   **Performance Metrics:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as response time, throughput, and error rate.
*   **Model Retraining:**  Periodically retrain the LSTM model with new data to improve accuracy and adapt to changing user behavior patterns.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify and flag unusual resource usage patterns that may indicate security threats or system issues.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation):**

```
// For each user group:
predicted_program_capacity = GetProgramCapacityPrediction(user_group)
predicted_user_demand = GetUserDemandPrediction(user_group)

// Combined Prediction
combined_prediction = (weight_program * predicted_program_capacity) + (weight_user * predicted_user_demand)

// Allocate Resources
allocated_resources = AllocateResources(combined_prediction, available_resources)

// Monitor & Adjust
MonitorResourceUtilization(allocated_resources)
If (utilization > threshold) {
    IncreaseResources(allocated_resources)
} else if (utilization < threshold) {
    DecreaseResources(allocated_resources)
}
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond purely program-centric resource allocation to proactively anticipate the needs of *users*, creating a more responsive and efficient system. It acknowledges that resource demand is not solely driven by program execution but also by how users *interact* with those programs.
