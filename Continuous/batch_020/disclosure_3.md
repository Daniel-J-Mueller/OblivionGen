## Dynamic Acoustic Zones with Predictive Beamforming

**Concept:** Expand upon cloud-based device discovery to create dynamically adjustable “acoustic zones” within a space. These zones prioritize audio delivery to specific users or locations, leveraging predictive beamforming based on user activity and environmental data.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of networked, spatially distributed audio output devices (speakers). Each speaker should have:
        *   Multiple drivers for beamforming.
        *   Microphone array for ambient noise analysis and user localization.
        *   Wireless network connectivity (Wi-Fi 6E or better).
        *   Edge processing capability (sufficient for basic signal processing & network communication).
    *   Centralized server/cloud infrastructure for zone management, predictive modeling & data aggregation.
    *   User devices (phones, laptops, smartwatches) with location services & microphone access (optional, for improved localization).

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Zone Definition:** A user interface (app/web portal) allowing creation & naming of acoustic zones (e.g., “Living Room”, “Office”, “Kitchen”). Zones are defined spatially via a 3D map or by designating associated devices.
    *   **User Tracking:** Real-time tracking of users within the defined space. Methods:
        *   Device-based location (Bluetooth beacons, Wi-Fi triangulation).
        *   Audio-based localization (microphone array processing, sound source localization). Requires user consent.
        *   Camera-based tracking (optional, with privacy considerations).
    *   **Predictive Beamforming:** Algorithms that anticipate a user’s next location and adjust beamforming parameters accordingly. Factors:
        *   User's historical movement patterns.
        *   Environmental context (time of day, detected activity).
        *   Real-time user input (e.g., voice commands, app interactions).
    *   **Content Prioritization:** System intelligently prioritizes audio streams based on the active zone & user preferences.
        *   Multi-channel audio mixing & routing.
        *   Noise cancellation optimized for the current zone.
    *   **Cloud Integration:**
        *   Device discovery & registration (as per the original patent).
        *   Centralized zone management & data analytics.
        *   Firmware updates & algorithm improvements.

*   **Pseudocode - Predictive Beamforming Algorithm:**

```
// Variables:
// user_location: Current 3D coordinates of the user
// user_history: List of previous locations & timestamps
// environmental_data: Time of day, detected activity (e.g., "watching TV", "cooking")
// speaker_array: List of speakers in the space
// beamforming_parameters: Set of parameters controlling beamforming (azimuth, elevation, gain)

function predict_next_location(user_location, user_history, environmental_data):
  // Use a machine learning model (e.g., RNN, LSTM) trained on historical data
  // to predict the most likely next location based on current location,
  // historical movement patterns, and environmental context.
  predicted_location = ML_model.predict(user_location, user_history, environmental_data)
  return predicted_location

function adjust_beamforming(predicted_location, speaker_array):
  // Calculate the optimal beamforming parameters for each speaker
  // to maximize audio delivery to the predicted location.
  for each speaker in speaker_array:
    beamforming_parameters = calculate_optimal_parameters(speaker, predicted_location)
    apply_parameters(speaker, beamforming_parameters)

function calculate_optimal_parameters(speaker, predicted_location):
    // Based on speaker position and predicted location, calculate azimuth,
    // elevation, and gain to focus audio beam.
    azimuth = calculate_azimuth(speaker.position, predicted_location)
    elevation = calculate_elevation(speaker.position, predicted_location)
    gain = calculate_gain(distance(speaker.position, predicted_location))
    return (azimuth, elevation, gain)
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Home Entertainment:** Personalized audio experience for each family member, following them as they move around the room.
*   **Open Office:** Focus audio delivery to an individual's workstation, minimizing distractions.
*   **Smart Retail:** Targeted audio messaging to customers in specific areas of the store.
*   **Accessibility:** Improved audio clarity for individuals with hearing impairments.
