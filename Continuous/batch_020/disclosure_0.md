## Dynamic DNS-Based Reputation Scoring & Prioritization

**Concept:** Extend the DNS resolution process to incorporate real-time reputation scoring of content sources *before* content delivery. This builds on the patent's location-based routing by adding a layer of security and quality control, dynamically prioritizing content based on observed performance and security metrics.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Data Store:**

*   **Data Structure:** A key-value store where keys are domain names/content sources (e.g., `video.example.com`) and values are reputation scores (ranging from 0-100, 100 being highest). The value also contains timestamp of last update, and contributing factors (see section 3).
*   **Storage:** Distributed, highly available database (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB).
*   **Initial Population:** Seed with known reputable sources, potentially leveraging existing threat intelligence feeds.

**2. DNS Interception & Scoring Module:**

*   **Integration Point:** Inserted into the existing DNS resolution path (likely within the content delivery network's DNS servers).
*   **Process Flow:**
    1.  Receive DNS query.
    2.  Extract domain name.
    3.  Lookup domain name in Reputation Data Store.
    4.  If domain name is not found, assign a default score (e.g., 50) and initiate monitoring (see section 4).
    5.  Modify DNS response based on reputation score:
        *   **High Score (80-100):** Return standard A/AAAA record(s).
        *   **Medium Score (50-79):** Return A/AAAA record(s) with a reduced TTL (Time To Live) - forcing more frequent checks.
        *   **Low Score (0-49):** Return a "shadow" A/AAAA record pointing to a honeypot or redirection server, *or* return a SERVFAIL error. The choice is configurable based on severity and desired action.

**3. Contributing Factors:**

*   **Performance Metrics:** RTT (Round Trip Time), packet loss, throughput.
*   **Security Signals:**
    *   **Malware Detection:** Integration with threat intelligence feeds and malware scanning services.
    *   **DDoS Attack Detection:** Monitoring for anomalous traffic patterns.
    *   **Content Integrity Checks:** Verification of content hash values.
    *   **SSL/TLS Certificate Validation:** Ensuring certificate validity and trustworthiness.
*   **User Feedback:**  (Optional) â€“ Reporting of malicious or low-quality content.

**4. Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Deploy agents at various points within the content delivery network to collect performance and security metrics.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** A weighted scoring algorithm that combines contributing factors to generate the reputation score.  Weights can be adjusted based on priority and evolving threats. (Pseudocode example):
    ```
    reputationScore = (performanceWeight * performanceScore) + (securityWeight * securityScore) + (userFeedbackWeight * userFeedbackScore)
    ```
*   **Dynamic Updates:** Reputation scores are updated in real-time based on monitored data.
*   **Thresholds & Alerts:** Configure thresholds for reputation scores to trigger alerts and automated actions (e.g., blocking a malicious domain).

**5.  IP Address Reputation:**

*   Extend the system to score *source IP addresses* based on observed behavior.
*   Use IP reputation data to prioritize traffic from trusted sources and rate-limit or block traffic from malicious sources.
*   Leverage this to mitigate botnet attacks and protect against abuse.



**Engineer Notes:**

*   The system must be highly scalable and resilient to handle a large volume of DNS queries.
*   Consider using a distributed caching layer to improve performance.
*   Implement robust security measures to protect the Reputation Data Store from tampering.
*   Design the system to be easily extensible to support new contributing factors and scoring algorithms.
*   Ensure compliance with privacy regulations when collecting and processing user feedback.
