## Dynamic Data Provenance & Repair System

**Concept:** Extend the concept of precomputation and backfill to encompass *dynamic* data provenance tracking and automated repair, moving beyond simple value recalculation to include contextual understanding of data origins and potential corruption pathways.

**Specifications:**

**1. Provenance Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Nodes:** Each value in storage is represented as a node in a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
*   **Process Nodes:**  Each modification process (like those described in the patent) is a process node.
*   **Edges:** Edges connect process nodes to data nodes they modify, and process nodes to other process nodes that trigger them.  Edge data includes timestamps, process IDs, user IDs, and a ‘confidence score’ reflecting the reliability of the process.
*   **Metadata:** Each node stores metadata: data type, size, checksum, last modified time, owner, access control list.
*   **Graph Storage:** A distributed, scalable graph database (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph) is employed to store the provenance graph.

**2. Anomaly Detection & Isolation:**

*   **Checksum Verification:** Periodically verify checksums of data nodes.
*   **Deviation Analysis:** Monitor values for deviations from expected ranges (based on historical data or defined rules).
*   **Provenance Tracing:** When an anomaly is detected, trace the provenance graph *backwards* from the affected data node to identify potential sources of corruption.
*   **Confidence Scoring:**  Use the confidence scores on edges to weight the probability of corruption originating from a particular process or data source.
*   **Isolation:**  Flag potentially compromised processes or data sources.

**3. Automated Repair & Validation:**

*   **Repair Strategies:** Based on the provenance graph and anomaly type, select an appropriate repair strategy:
    *   **Re-execution:** Re-execute the identified corrupt process.
    *   **Rollback:** Revert to a known good state (from a historical snapshot stored within the provenance graph).
    *   **Data Reconstruction:** Reconstruct the corrupted value from upstream data sources (using the provenance graph to identify dependencies).
    *   **Manual Intervention:** Flag the issue for human review.
*   **Validation:** After repair, validate the corrected value by comparing it to expected values and/or by running validation tests.
*   **Graph Update:** Update the provenance graph to reflect the repair process and its success or failure.

**4. Dynamic Process Prioritization:**

*   **Dependency Analysis:**  Analyze the provenance graph to identify dependencies between processes.
*   **Impact Assessment:**  Estimate the impact of process failures on downstream data.
*   **Priority Assignment:** Assign priorities to processes based on their impact and reliability.
*   **Queue Management:**  Use a dynamic queue management system to prioritize processes based on their assigned priorities.  This builds on the patent’s concept of managing access to storage, but adds real-time prioritization.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Queue Management):**

```
function enqueueProcess(process, dependencyGraph) {
    priority = calculatePriority(process, dependencyGraph);
    insertProcessIntoPriorityQueue(process, priority);
}

function calculatePriority(process, dependencyGraph) {
    impact = calculateImpact(process, dependencyGraph);
    reliability = calculateReliability(process);
    priority = impact * reliability;  // Or a more complex weighting
    return priority;
}

function calculateImpact(process, dependencyGraph) {
    // Traverse the dependency graph to determine the number of downstream
    // processes and data nodes affected by a failure of this process.
    // Return a score representing the impact.
}

function calculateReliability(process) {
    // Based on historical data, determine the probability of failure
    // for this process.
    // Return a score representing the reliability.
}
```

**Infrastructure Requirements:**

*   Distributed graph database.
*   Scalable queue management system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
*   Monitoring and alerting system.
*   Historical data storage for reliability calculations.
*   Automated testing framework for validation.
