## Dynamic Item ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization

**Concept:** Extend the relationship mapping beyond simple ‘related items’ to create a dynamic, visually explorable ‘ecosystem’ of items, leveraging user session data and potentially external knowledge graphs.

**Specs:**

1.  **Data Input:**
    *   Core: User session data (items viewed within a session – as in the patent).
    *   Augmented: External knowledge graph integration (e.g., Wikidata, product ontologies). This adds semantic relationships – “is a type of”, “has part”, “used for” – beyond co-viewing.
    *   Real-time Session Data: Continuously ingest and process new user session data.

2.  **Ecosystem Graph Construction:**
    *   Node Representation: Each item is a node.
    *   Edge Representation:
        *   Co-viewed (primary): Edge weight based on frequency of co-viewing within sessions (as in the patent).
        *   Semantic (secondary): Edges derived from knowledge graph relationships. Edge weight based on strength of semantic connection.
        *   Purchase Correlation: Incorporate purchase data *as a tertiary edge* – showing items frequently bought together.  This is deliberately a weaker signal to prioritize browsing behavior first.
    *   Dynamic Weighting: Algorithm to dynamically adjust edge weights based on time decay. Recent co-views have higher weight.

3.  **Visualization Interface:**
    *   Force-Directed Graph: Use a force-directed graph layout to visually represent the ecosystem. Items frequently co-viewed/related are clustered closer together.
    *   Interactive Exploration:
        *   Zoom & Pan: Standard graph navigation.
        *   Node Highlighting: Highlighting a node (item) reveals its direct connections.
        *   “Ecosystem Radius” Control: User-adjustable radius to control how many levels of connections are displayed.  A small radius shows immediate relationships. A larger radius reveals more distant, indirect connections.
        *   Filtering: Ability to filter items based on category, price, or other attributes.
    *   "Ecosystem Drift" Visualization: Algorithmically animate the graph over time, showing how relationships shift based on incoming user session data.  This provides a sense of the evolving ‘ecosystem’.

4.  **Personalization Layer:**
    *   "My Ecosystem":  Each user has a personalized ecosystem graph constructed from their browsing history.
    *   "Ecosystem Recommendations": Algorithm to suggest items within a user’s ecosystem that they haven't yet viewed. This goes beyond simple “related items” – it surfaces items that are indirectly connected within their personalized ecosystem.
    *   "Ecosystem Insights": Display visual summaries of a user’s ecosystem – e.g., “You frequently browse items related to ‘photography’ and ‘travel’”.

**Pseudocode (Ecosystem Recommendation):**

```
function recommend_ecosystem_items(user_id, current_item, ecosystem_graph, N):
  // ecosystem_graph is a graph data structure
  // N is the number of recommendations to generate

  // 1. Get the user's personalized ecosystem graph
  user_ecosystem = get_user_ecosystem(user_id)

  // 2. Find nodes directly connected to the current item in the user ecosystem
  connected_items = get_neighbors(current_item, user_ecosystem)

  // 3. Perform a breadth-first search (BFS) to find items within a radius of 2-3 hops from the current item
  candidates = BFS(current_item, user_ecosystem, depth=3)

  // 4. Filter out items the user has already viewed
  filtered_candidates = [item for item in candidates if item not in user_viewed_items]

  // 5. Sort candidates by a combined score:
  //    - Edge weight in the ecosystem graph (higher weight = more related)
  //    - Number of common neighbors with the current item
  sorted_candidates = sort_by_score(filtered_candidates)

  // 6. Return the top N candidates
  return sorted_candidates[:N]
