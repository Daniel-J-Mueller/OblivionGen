## Virtual Network "Shadowing" for Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network simulation capability to create a “shadow” network mirroring live production traffic, but with injected, controlled failures. This allows for proactive testing of failure scenarios *without* impacting live users.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Traffic Mirroring Module:**
    *   Captures a configurable percentage (0-100%) of live network traffic.
    *   Traffic selection based on source/destination IP, port, protocol, or application signature.
    *   Traffic duplication with minimal latency impact on the live network.
    *   Configuration via API or GUI, including filtering options.

*   **Component 2: Shadow Network Instance:**
    *   Creates a dynamically scalable virtual network instance.
    *   Configuration matches (or closely approximates) the live production network topology.
    *   Virtual machines (VMs) deployed within the shadow network mimic the functionality of production VMs.
    *   Option to selectively replicate VM states (memory, disk) for higher fidelity.
    *   Ability to isolate shadow network from external access.

*   **Component 3: Failure Injection Engine:**
    *   API-driven system for injecting controlled failures into the shadow network.
    *   Supported failure types:
        *   **Link Failure:** Simulate network link outages.
        *   **VM Failure:** Simulate VM crashes or resource exhaustion.
        *   **Latency Injection:** Introduce artificial network latency.
        *   **Packet Loss:** Simulate packet loss rates.
        *   **Corruption:** Introduce bit errors into packets.
    *   Failure injection granularity:
        *   Specific VM
        *   Network link
        *   Traffic flow (based on 5-tuple)
    *   Configurable failure duration and repetition patterns.

*   **Component 4: Monitoring and Analytics Dashboard:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of shadow network performance metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O, application response time).
    *   Correlation of failure injection events with performance degradation.
    *   Alerting system for critical performance thresholds.
    *   Automated report generation detailing failure scenarios and impact.
    *   Ability to compare shadow network performance with baseline data (from the live network).

**Pseudocode (Failure Injection Example):**

```
function inject_failure(failure_type, target_component, duration, parameters) {

  if (failure_type == "link_failure") {
    disable_network_interface(target_component);
    start_timer(duration);

    on_timer_expiration {
      enable_network_interface(target_component);
    }
  }

  else if (failure_type == "vm_failure") {
    shutdown_vm(target_component);
    start_timer(duration);

    on_timer_expiration {
      start_vm(target_component);
    }
  }
  // ... other failure types
}
```

**Deployment:**

*   The system could be deployed as a cloud service or on-premise.
*   Requires sufficient compute and network resources to support the shadow network.
*   Integration with existing network monitoring and management tools.

**Value Proposition:**

*   Proactive identification of potential failure points in the network.
*   Reduced downtime and improved service availability.
*   Faster root cause analysis of network issues.
*   Validation of disaster recovery plans.
*   Risk-free testing of network changes and upgrades.
