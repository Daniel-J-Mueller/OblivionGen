## Dynamic Risk Weighting via Real-Time Behavioral Signals

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust topic/item risk scores based on real-time user behavioral data, layered on top of the existing machine learning model.

**Core Concept:** The existing system appears to rely on static or periodically updated risk scores. This introduces latency and fails to capture rapidly evolving risk landscapes. Behavioral signals—how users *interact* with items flagged as potentially risky—provide immediate feedback and enable proactive risk mitigation.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Signal Collection:** Capture the following signals in real-time:
    *   **View Duration:** How long does a user spend viewing an item page?  Shorter durations may indicate a 'drive-by' or suspicious activity.
    *   **Scroll Depth:** How far down the page does a user scroll?  Limited scrolling suggests disinterest or a quick scan for specific information.
    *   **Zoom/Image Interaction:**  Are users zooming in on specific areas of images?  (e.g., looking for details of a prohibited item).
    *   **"Report" Actions:**  Track user reports of suspicious items.
    *   **Add-to-Cart/Purchase Rate (Post-Flag):**  Track if flagged items are still being purchased.  A high purchase rate suggests the risk assessment may be flawed or circumvented.
    *   **Session Characteristics:** IP address, location, time of day, browser fingerprint. Anomalous patterns may suggest bot activity or malicious intent.

2.  **Real-time Feature Engineering:** Process raw behavioral signals into meaningful features:
    *   **Weighted Signal Aggregation:** Combine multiple signals into a single risk score using a weighted sum. Weights can be adjusted via A/B testing or machine learning.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns in user behavior using statistical methods (e.g., z-score, isolation forest).
    *   **Session Risk Score:** Calculate a risk score for each user session based on their behavioral patterns.

3.  **Dynamic Risk Weighting Module:** Integrate behavioral data into the existing risk assessment framework:
    *   **Risk Score Modulation:**  Apply a multiplier to topic/item risk scores based on the session risk score.  Higher session risk = higher effective risk score.
    *   **Threshold Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the threshold for triggering item removal based on real-time risk levels.
    *   **Feedback Loop:**  Use behavioral data to retrain the machine learning model, improving its ability to identify and assess risks.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_effective_risk_score(item_risk_score, session_risk_score):
  // Session Risk Score is normalized between 0 and 1 (0 = low risk, 1 = high risk)

  // Apply a multiplier to the item risk score
  multiplier = 1 + (session_risk_score * 0.5)  // Adjust 0.5 for sensitivity
  effective_risk_score = item_risk_score * multiplier

  return effective_risk_score

function process_item_page(item_page, session_data):
  item_risk_score = calculate_item_risk_score(item_page) //Existing ML Model
  session_risk_score = calculate_session_risk_score(session_data) //New Module

  effective_risk_score = calculate_effective_risk_score(item_risk_score, session_risk_score)

  if effective_risk_score > threshold:
    remove_item_page(item_page)
  else:
    display_item_page(item_page)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Real-time data streaming infrastructure (e.g., Kafka, Apache Pulsar).
*   Fast, scalable data storage (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
*   Machine learning platform for model training and deployment.
*   Web analytics tracking library to capture user behavior.
