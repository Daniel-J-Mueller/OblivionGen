## Autonomous Device Swarm & Predictive Interaction

**Core Concept:** Extend the autonomous device’s ability to identify and track a user by leveraging a swarm of smaller, networked devices. These devices *predict* user intent through environmental data and subtle biometrics, proactively adjusting the primary device’s behavior and establishing a richer, more seamless interaction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device Network – ‘Echoes’:**

*   **Hardware:** Miniature, low-power devices (approx. 2cm diameter) containing:
    *   Microphone array (beamforming capable)
    *   Passive Infrared (PIR) sensor
    *   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceiver
    *   Ultra-Wideband (UWB) transceiver (for precise location)
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope
    *   Limited processing capability (edge computing)
*   **Deployment:** Designed to be subtly integrated into the environment – clipped onto clothing, attached to furniture, or dispersed within a room. Maximum swarm size: 20 devices.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable via inductive charging or replaceable coin-cell batteries.

**2. Data Fusion & Prediction Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers.
*   **Input Data:**
    *   Audio data (speech, ambient sounds) from all ‘Echo’ devices.
    *   PIR data (motion detection) from all ‘Echo’ devices.
    *   UWB location data of all ‘Echo’ devices relative to each other and the primary autonomous device.
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope data from ‘Echo’ devices (detecting subtle movements, gestures).
    *   Historical user interaction data (preferences, routines).
*   **Output:**
    *   Probability distribution of user intent (e.g., “likely to adjust thermostat,” “likely to request music,” “likely to make a phone call”).
    *   Predicted gaze direction.
    *   Emotional state estimation (based on vocal tone and micro-movements).

**3. Primary Autonomous Device Integration:**

*   **Communication:** Secure, encrypted connection with the ‘Echo’ swarm via BLE/UWB.
*   **Behavioral Adaptation:**
    *   **Proactive UI adjustment:** Display relevant information *before* the user explicitly requests it (e.g., show thermostat controls when predicting temperature adjustment).
    *   **Automated actions:** Execute simple tasks based on predicted intent (e.g., dim lights when predicting relaxation, start music playlist when predicting activity).
    *   **Gaze-aware interaction:** Adjust display content and input methods based on predicted gaze direction.
    *   **Adaptive audio focus:** Prioritize audio sources based on predicted attention (e.g., focus on speech during conversation, prioritize music during activity).

**4. Pseudocode (Primary Device – Prediction Loop):**

```
// Initialize prediction engine with user profile

WHILE (device is active) {

    // Receive data from Echo swarm
    swarmData = receiveSwarmData();

    // Process swarm data
    processedData = processSwarmData(swarmData);

    // Run prediction engine
    prediction = predictIntent(processedData);

    // Adapt device behavior based on prediction
    adaptDeviceBehavior(prediction);

    //Update user model with observed actions
    updateUserModel(prediction, observedActions)

    //Delay loop for efficient processing.
    delay(50ms);

}
```

**5. Scalability & Privacy:**

*   **Modular Design:** Easy to add/remove ‘Echo’ devices to adjust coverage and precision.
*   **Edge Computing:** Most data processing occurs on the ‘Echo’ devices and primary device, minimizing data transmission to the cloud.
*   **Privacy Controls:** User-configurable settings to control data collection, sharing, and prediction accuracy. Full opt-out option. Local processing mode.
