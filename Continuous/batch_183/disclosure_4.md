## Dynamic Node Personality System

**Concept:** Extend the node-based visual programming paradigm with a “personality” system. Nodes aren't just functional blocks, but possess inherent behavioral traits influencing execution and interaction.

**Specification:**

1.  **Personality Definitions:** Introduce a separate file format (e.g., `.nps`) defining node personalities. These files specify:
    *   **Trait List:** A set of key-value pairs representing personality traits (e.g., “optimistic: 0.8”, “verbose: 0.2”, “riskAverse: 0.5”). Values are floats between 0.0 and 1.0 representing the strength of the trait.
    *   **Execution Modifiers:** Functions that modify node behavior based on trait values. Examples:
        *   `errorHandling(traitValue, errorType)`: Determines how a node handles errors (e.g., ignore, retry, escalate) based on its “riskAverse” trait.
        *   `loggingLevel(traitValue)`: Adjusts the amount of logging output based on the “verbose” trait.
        *   `performanceOptimization(traitValue)`: Selects different optimization strategies based on an “efficiency” trait.
    *   **Interaction Protocols:** Define how nodes communicate with each other, influenced by traits like “cooperative” or “competitive”.

2.  **Node Assignment:** Within the visual programming interface, allow developers to assign personality files to individual nodes. A node can also have a default personality.

3.  **Dynamic Behavior:** During execution, the deterministic execution engine integrates personality traits.  For instance:
    *   A node with high “optimistic” and low “riskAverse” might automatically retry failed operations multiple times without reporting errors.
    *   Two nodes with high “cooperative” traits might automatically share data and resources.
    *   Nodes with conflicting traits (e.g., high “competitive” and low “cooperative”) might exhibit unpredictable behavior, potentially triggering debugging tools.

4.  **Trait Propagation:** Introduce a mechanism for traits to propagate between connected nodes. For example, a node with high “verbose” could influence its downstream neighbors to also increase their logging levels.

5.  **Personality Editor:** Within the visual programming interface, create a dedicated editor for creating and modifying personality definitions. This editor should allow developers to define traits, create execution modifiers, and test personality behaviors.

**Pseudocode (Execution Stage Logic)**

```
function executeStage(stageNodes) {
  for each node in stageNodes {
    personality = node.getPersonality()
    errorHandlingStrategy = personality.getExecutionModifier("errorHandling", "default")
    loggingLevel = personality.getExecutionModifier("loggingLevel", "default")

    try {
      node.execute()
      log(loggingLevel, "Node executed successfully")
    } catch (error) {
      handleError(errorHandlingStrategy, error)
    }
  }
}

function handleError(strategy, error) {
  if (strategy == "ignore") {
    // Do nothing
  } else if (strategy == "retry") {
    retryOperation()
  } else if (strategy == "escalate") {
    throw error // Propagate the error to a higher level
  } else {
    // Default error handling
    log("Error: " + error.message)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply defining *what* nodes do to defining *how* they do it, creating more adaptable, predictable, and debuggable visual programs. It allows for emergent behaviors and a more nuanced control over program execution.
