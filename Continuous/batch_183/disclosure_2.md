## Adaptive Disconnection Granularity

**Specification:** Implement a system allowing for dynamic adjustment of disconnection granularity beyond per-node disconnection. Current implementation focuses on disconnecting entire nodes. This adaptation allows for disconnection of *sub-components* within a node – specific processes, memory segments, or network interfaces – while maintaining core node functionality.

**Components:**

1.  **Resource Inventory Module:** Continuously monitors all resources (processes, memory, network connections) within each node.  Maintains a real-time inventory with associated metadata (resource type, dependencies, criticality).
2.  **Dependency Graph Generator:** Creates and maintains a dynamic dependency graph showing relationships between resources within and across nodes.  This graph is updated automatically based on runtime observation.
3.  **Disconnection Policy Engine:**  Defines configurable policies that govern disconnection behavior. Policies specify criteria for disconnecting resources (e.g., resource type, dependency level, network traffic patterns, CPU usage). Policies can be dynamically updated.  Supports both 'allow' and 'deny' rules.
4.  **Adaptive Disconnection Manager:** Orchestrates the disconnection process based on the Disconnection Policy Engine and Dependency Graph. It intelligently selects resources to disconnect, minimizing impact on overall system stability.
5.  **Isolation Layer:** Provides a mechanism to isolate disconnected resources from the rest of the system.  This can be achieved using virtualization, containerization, or process-level sandboxing.
6.  **Sanitization Interface:**  Provides tools for sanitizing disconnected resources (e.g., memory scrubbing, process termination, file system checks). Leverages existing malware scanning tools, file integrity checks, and secure deletion mechanisms.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - Runs on each node
while (true) {
    ResourceInventoryModule.updateInventory();
    DependencyGraphGenerator.updateGraph();

    // Check for disconnection triggers (e.g., security alerts, resource overload)
    if (DisconnectionPolicyEngine.triggerDetected()) {
        // Determine resources to disconnect based on policy
        List<Resource> resourcesToDisconnect = DisconnectionPolicyEngine.selectResources();

        // Disconnect resources
        foreach (Resource resource : resourcesToDisconnect) {
            IsolationLayer.disconnectResource(resource);
            SanitizationInterface.sanitizeResource(resource);
        }
    }
}
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The system continuously monitors node resources.
2.  If a disconnection trigger occurs (e.g., security alert), the Disconnection Policy Engine evaluates the situation and selects resources for disconnection.
3.  The Adaptive Disconnection Manager isolates the selected resources.
4.  The Sanitization Interface cleans the disconnected resources.
5.  Disconnected resources remain isolated until they are deemed safe or no longer needed.
6.  The Dependency Graph is updated to reflect the changes.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Granularity:** Allows for more targeted disconnection, minimizing impact on critical services.
*   **Improved Security:** Provides a more effective way to isolate compromised resources.
*   **Enhanced Resilience:** Improves the system's ability to withstand attacks and failures.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Enables the system to adapt to changing security threats and resource demands.
*   **Reduced Downtime:** Minimizes the need for full node restarts.
