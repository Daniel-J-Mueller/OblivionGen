## Adaptive Resource Prioritization via Predictive User Agent Negotiation

**Concept:** Expand the user agent string modification to dynamically prioritize resource delivery based on predicted user behavior *before* the request is fully processed. This moves beyond simply altering the user agent to *influence* content delivery, to actively shaping it based on predictive analytics.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Analytics Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User browsing history (local or cloud-synced, with user consent).
    *   Real-time user interaction data (mouse movements, scrolling speed, keystrokes – anonymized and aggregated).
    *   Network conditions (latency, bandwidth, packet loss).
    *   Content type (image, video, text, script).
    *   Time of day, location (coarse-grained).
*   **Model:** Utilize a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or decision tree) trained to predict the *probability* of specific user actions (e.g., scrolling to view an image, clicking a link, watching a video).  The model outputs a ‘priority vector’ representing the likely importance of different content types.
*   **Update Frequency:** Model updates occur in the background, utilizing federated learning techniques to improve accuracy without requiring central data collection.

**2. User Agent Negotiation Engine:**

*   **Integration with Existing System:**  The engine intercepts the original request *before* user agent modification.
*   **Priority Vector Input:** Receives the priority vector from the Predictive Analytics Module.
*   **User Agent String Augmentation:** The engine doesn’t just *replace* the user agent string; it *augments* it with a dynamically generated ‘priority tag’.  This tag is a standardized string that signals the content provider about the predicted user priorities.
    *   Example Tag: `priority=[image:0.8,video:0.2,text:0.5]` (values represent probabilities)
*   **Content Provider Communication:** The system maintains a database of content providers and their support for the priority tag.  If a provider supports the tag, it’s included in the request.  If not, the request proceeds with the standard user agent modification.

**3. Content Provider Adaptation (Optional):**

*   The content provider, upon receiving the request with the priority tag, can adapt its content delivery:
    *   Pre-load high-priority resources.
    *   Compress or reduce the quality of low-priority resources.
    *   Prioritize the delivery of high-priority content in the network queue.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Request Initiation
priorityVector = PredictiveAnalyticsModule.predict(userHistory, networkConditions, contentType);

userAgentString = originalRequest.userAgent;

if (ContentProviderDatabase.supportsPriorityTag(request.url)) {
  priorityTag = "priority=[" + priorityVector.image + "," + priorityVector.video + "," + priorityVector.text + "]";
  modifiedUserAgentString = userAgentString + " " + priorityTag;
} else {
  // Use existing user agent modification logic
  modifiedUserAgentString = UserAgentNegotiationEngine.modifyUserAgent(userAgentString, resourceConfig);
}

request.userAgent = modifiedUserAgentString;

sendRequest(request);
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Sufficient processing power on the client device to run the Predictive Analytics Module (optimization for low-power devices is critical).
*   Low-latency network connection for data synchronization (optional).

**Software Requirements:**

*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow Lite, Core ML).
*   Secure data storage for user browsing history.
*   API for content provider communication.
*   Federated learning infrastructure.
