## Temporal Feature Lineage Tracking & Predictive Drift Analysis

**Specification:** A system extension to the existing feature store to track not just feature *values* but also the *origin* of those values, their transformations, and predicted drift over time. This allows for proactive model retraining and debugging of feature engineering pipelines.

**Components:**

1.  **Lineage Metadata Store:**  A graph database (Neo4j or similar) to store feature lineage. Nodes represent:
    *   **Raw Data Source:**  (e.g., database table, API endpoint).
    *   **Transformation Step:**  (e.g., scaling, one-hot encoding, aggregation). Includes code pointer (Git commit SHA) or descriptive name.
    *   **Feature:** The final feature stored in the feature store.
    *   **Model:** The ML model consuming the feature.

    Edges represent the flow of data/transformation.  Each edge stores timestamps for when the transformation occurred.

2.  **Drift Prediction Engine:**
    *   Monitors feature statistics (mean, std, distribution) over time.
    *   Employs time-series forecasting models (Prophet, LSTM) to predict future feature values.
    *   Calculates a ‘drift score’ based on the divergence between predicted and observed values.  A threshold-based alert system notifies data scientists when drift is detected.
    *   Stores drift score time series in a dedicated database.

3. **Feature Versioning Extension:** The existing feature store versioning is extended to incorporate lineage metadata. Every version of a feature includes a pointer to the complete lineage graph and the drift score history up to that version.

**Pseudocode (Drift Prediction Engine):**

```python
class DriftPredictionEngine:
    def __init__(self, feature_name, history_window=30):
        self.feature_name = feature_name
        self.history_window = history_window # Days
        self.time_series_model = Prophet() # Or LSTM, etc.

    def train(self, historical_data):
        # historical_data: List of (timestamp, feature_value)
        self.time_series_model.fit(historical_data)

    def predict(self, future_timestamps):
        predictions = self.time_series_model.predict(future_timestamps)
        return predictions

    def calculate_drift_score(self, observed_value, predicted_value):
        # Simple example: Percentage difference
        drift_score = abs(observed_value - predicted_value) / observed_value
        return drift_score

    def monitor_drift(self, observed_data):
        # observed_data: (timestamp, feature_value)
        future_timestamps = [observed_data[0] + timedelta(days=i) for i in range(1, 8)] #Predict 7 days ahead
        predictions = self.predict(future_timestamps)

        drift_score = self.calculate_drift_score(observed_data[1], predictions[0])

        return drift_score

```

**Workflow:**

1.  When a new feature is created, the data scientist defines the lineage graph – detailing the source, transformations, and dependencies.
2.  The Drift Prediction Engine is initialized for the feature, and trained on historical data.
3.  The engine continuously monitors the feature, predicts future values, and calculates the drift score.
4.  Alerts are triggered when the drift score exceeds a predefined threshold, prompting investigation.
5.  Versioned lineage and drift data allows rollback to previous feature states and debugging of pipeline issues.
