## Adaptive Payload Simulation & Predictive Control

**Concept:** Expand upon actuator data analysis to create a real-time payload simulation, informing a predictive motion controller that anticipates, rather than reacts to, payload mass changes.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate high-resolution current sensors on all drive actuators (wheel motors, lifting mechanisms, rotational actuators). Add six-axis inertial measurement units (IMUs) to both the mobile drive unit *and* the docking head/payload interface.
*   **Real-time Data Acquisition:** Implement a dedicated microcontroller/FPGA to collect current data (sampled at >1kHz) and IMU data (sampled at >100Hz). Timestamp all data with high precision.
*   **Payload Simulation Engine:**
    *   **Mass Estimation:** Utilize the existing current-to-mass conversion logic but extend it.  Create a dynamic model that factors in *acceleration* profiles. Higher acceleration = greater current draw, which can refine mass estimation.
    *   **Center of Gravity (CoG) Estimation:** Leverage IMU data.  Analyze angular momentum changes during acceleration and deceleration to approximate CoG position.  This is inherently noisy, so employ a Kalman filter for smoothing.  The filter also predicts CoG drift.
    *   **Rigidity/Flexibility Mapping:** Introduce a "flexibility factor" based on current draw *and* IMU readings.  High current *and* significant angular displacement suggest a flexible/shifting payload. This impacts simulation fidelity.
*   **Predictive Motion Controller:**
    *   **Trajectory Planning:** Utilize the payload simulation to pre-calculate optimal trajectories *before* execution.  This includes anticipating necessary acceleration/deceleration profiles to accommodate varying payload mass/CoG.
    *   **Feedforward Control:** Incorporate feedforward terms based on the predicted trajectory and payload simulation into the motor control loop.  This proactively compensates for anticipated forces/torques.
    *   **Adaptive Gain Scheduling:** Dynamically adjust control gains (PID loops) based on the estimated payload mass, CoG, and flexibility.  Heavier/more flexible payloads require lower gains for stability.
    *   **Collision Avoidance:** The predictive controller should anticipate the outcome of a collision based on payload dynamics, and have safe stopping mechanisms in place.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Implement an automated calibration procedure using known masses at various positions. This refines the current-to-mass conversion and CoG estimation algorithms.
*   **Data Logging & Analysis:** Log all sensor data, control signals, and simulation outputs for offline analysis and algorithm refinement.

**Pseudocode (Motion Controller Update):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Acquire Sensor Data
  current_data = read_current_sensors();
  imu_data = read_imu_sensors();
  timestamp = get_current_timestamp();

  // 2. Payload Simulation Update
  estimated_mass, estimated_cog, flexibility = update_payload_simulation(current_data, imu_data, timestamp);

  // 3. Trajectory Planning
  optimal_trajectory = plan_trajectory(target_position, estimated_mass, estimated_cog, flexibility);

  // 4. Control Signal Generation
  control_signals = generate_control_signals(optimal_trajectory, estimated_mass, estimated_cog);

  // 5. Apply Control Signals to Actuators
  apply_control_signals(control_signals);

  // 6. Log Data
  log_data(current_data, imu_data, estimated_mass, estimated_cog, control_signals);
}
```

This builds on the original patent by not only *determining* payload properties but *actively simulating* their behavior to optimize motion control *before* movements are made, leading to increased efficiency, safety, and responsiveness.
