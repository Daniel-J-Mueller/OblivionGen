## Dynamic Data Provenance & Predictive Pre-Loading

**Concept:** Extend the shared data concept to incorporate detailed provenance tracking *and* predictive pre-loading of data into VM instances based on anticipated execution paths. This moves beyond simply *accessing* shared data to proactively preparing it for likely use.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Provenance Module:**

*   **Function:** Tracks all modifications to shared data, recording the VM instance ID, timestamp, operation type (read, write, delete), and specific data elements modified.
*   **Implementation:** A lightweight, distributed logging system integrated with the shared data storage. Logs are appended-only to ensure immutability.
*   **Data Structure:**  
    `{ timestamp: epoch_ms, vm_id: string, operation: enum(READ, WRITE, DELETE), data_key: string, data_value: any }`
*   **Output:**  A provenance graph representing the history of each data element.

**2. Execution Path Prediction Engine:**

*   **Function:** Analyzes historical execution data (provenance logs, program code analysis, user behavior) to predict likely execution paths for given program code.
*   **Implementation:**  A machine learning model (e.g., Markov chain, recurrent neural network) trained on historical data.
*   **Input:** Program code identifier, user identifier, recent execution history.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of likely data elements to be accessed in the near future.  Associated confidence scores for each prediction.

**3. Predictive Data Pre-Loading Service:**

*   **Function:** Monitors incoming requests for program execution. Based on the Execution Path Prediction Engine's output, proactively pre-loads likely data elements into the target VM instance's memory or cache *before* the program actually requests it.
*   **Implementation:** A service running alongside the virtual compute system. Utilizes a shared cache or memory pool accessible to all VM instances.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
on request_received(request):
    program_code = request.program_code
    user = request.user
    vm_instance = select_vm_instance()

    predicted_data = predict_data_access(program_code, user) // Calls Prediction Engine

    for data_key, confidence in predicted_data:
        if confidence > threshold: // Confidence threshold tunable
            preload_data(data_key, vm_instance) // Loads data into VM cache/memory

    execute_program(program_code, vm_instance, request)
```

**4. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Function:** Adapt the `confidence threshold` in the Predictive Data Pre-Loading Service based on real-time performance metrics (latency, throughput).
*   **Implementation:**  A feedback loop that monitors latency. If latency is high, lower the threshold to pre-load more data. If latency is low, raise the threshold to reduce pre-loading overhead.

**5. Data Tiering & Eviction:**

*   Implement a tiered caching system (e.g., L1, L2, L3) to optimize for both speed and capacity.
*   Employ an eviction policy (e.g., Least Recently Used, Least Frequently Used) to manage cache space.



This system aims to drastically reduce latency by anticipating data needs, going beyond simply *sharing* data to *proactively preparing* it for execution.  The dynamic adjustment and tiering components ensure efficiency and scalability.
