## Adaptive Key Derivation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system extending the existing key derivation framework by incorporating real-time behavioral biometric data as a dynamic input to the Key Derivation Function (KDF). This aims to enhance security by making key derivation dependent on *how* a user is accessing data, not just *who* they are.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Sensor Suite:** Captures real-time user behavioral data. This includes:
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Timing variations between keystrokes.
    *   **Mouse/Touchpad Movement:** Speed, acceleration, pressure, patterns.
    *   **Scroll Behavior:** Speed, patterns, regions of focus.
    *   **Device Orientation:** (Mobile devices) – Angle, speed of movement.
2.  **Behavioral Feature Extractor:** Processes raw sensor data to extract relevant features. For example:
    *   Mean and standard deviation of keystroke inter-key times.
    *   Velocity and acceleration profiles of mouse movements.
    *   Entropy of scroll patterns.
3.  **Behavioral Profile Generator:** Creates a baseline behavioral profile for each user through initial learning. This profile represents the user’s typical behavior.
4.  **Real-Time Behavioral Anomaly Detector:** Compares real-time behavioral data to the user's established profile. Flags deviations beyond a configurable threshold.
5.  **Adaptive KDF Input:** The anomaly score generated by the Behavioral Anomaly Detector is incorporated as an *input* to the KDF.
6.  **Modified KDF:** The existing KDF is augmented to accept the anomaly score. The anomaly score is weighted within the KDF algorithm to affect the generated key material.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Existing KDF Input Parameters
sharedSecret
informationParameter

// New Input Parameter
anomalyScore = BehavioralAnomalyDetector(realtimeBehavioralData, userProfile)

// Modified KDF Algorithm
function AdaptiveKDF(sharedSecret, informationParameter, anomalyScore):
  // Concatenate inputs
  combinedInput = sharedSecret + informationParameter + anomalyScore

  // Apply a hash function (e.g., SHA-256)
  hashedInput = SHA256(combinedInput)

  // Derive key material from the hash
  keyMaterial = DeriveKey(hashedInput)

  return keyMaterial
```

**Operation:**

1.  During initial system access, a user’s baseline behavioral profile is established.
2.  As the user interacts with the system, the Behavioral Sensor Suite continuously captures data.
3.  The Behavioral Feature Extractor processes the data and the Real-Time Behavioral Anomaly Detector compares it to the user’s profile.
4.  Any significant deviations trigger an anomaly score.
5.  The Adaptive KDF incorporates this score into the key derivation process.
6.  Keys generated will subtly vary based on the user's current behavior, making it significantly harder for an attacker to compromise the system even with stolen credentials.



**Scalability:**  The Behavioral Sensor Suite can be implemented as a software library or integrated into existing operating systems.  The Behavioral Profile Generator and Anomaly Detector can be deployed as microservices to handle a large number of users.

**Security Implications:**  This adds an additional layer of security beyond traditional authentication.  An attacker would need to not only compromise credentials but also convincingly mimic the user's behavior to derive the correct keys.
