## Dynamic Network Path Weaving with Predictive Congestion Avoidance

**Concept:** Expand upon the multi-path communication idea in the provided patent, but instead of *selecting* the best path, dynamically *weave* data packets across multiple paths, adapting in real-time *before* congestion is detected, based on predictive modeling of network latency and bandwidth. This creates a more resilient and efficient system.

**Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   **Network Interface Controller (NIC) – Enhanced:** Modified NIC capable of transmitting and receiving packets across multiple physical or logical network connections simultaneously.
    *   **Predictive Engine:** A machine learning model running on the sending/receiving devices. This model predicts network latency and bandwidth for each available path. It learns from historical data and real-time monitoring.
    *   **Packet Weaver:** Software component responsible for splitting, interleaving, and reassembling packets across multiple network paths.
    *   **Path Monitoring Agent:** Continuously monitors each path for key performance indicators (KPIs): latency, packet loss, jitter, bandwidth utilization. Feeds data to the Predictive Engine.

*   **Operation:**
    1.  **Path Profiling:** At system startup and periodically, the Path Monitoring Agent probes each available network path to establish a baseline profile of latency and bandwidth.
    2.  **Predictive Modeling:** The Predictive Engine uses historical data, real-time monitoring data, and potentially external network intelligence (e.g., internet exchange point data) to predict future network conditions for each path.
    3.  **Packet Splitting & Interleaving:** The Packet Weaver splits outgoing data into smaller fragments. These fragments are interleaved and transmitted across multiple network paths.  The interleaving pattern is determined by the Predictive Engine – paths predicted to have lower latency and higher bandwidth receive more fragments.
    4.  **Dynamic Path Weighting:** The Predictive Engine continuously adjusts the "weight" assigned to each path, determining the proportion of data fragments sent via that path. Weights are adjusted based on predicted network conditions.
    5.  **Packet Reassembly:** The receiving device’s Packet Weaver reassembles the fragments into the original data stream. Sequence numbers embedded in each fragment ensure correct ordering.
    6.  **Adaptive Learning:** The Predictive Engine continuously learns from past performance, refining its models to improve prediction accuracy.

*   **Pseudocode (Simplified - Sender Side):**

```
// Initialization
paths = [path1, path2, path3]; // List of available network paths
predictiveEngine = new PredictiveEngine();
packetWeaver = new PacketWeaver();

// For each outgoing packet
packet = getNextPacket();
fragments = packetWeaver.splitPacket(packet);

// Determine path weights based on prediction
pathWeights = predictiveEngine.predictPathWeights(paths);

// Distribute fragments across paths based on weights
for (i = 0; i < fragments.length; i++) {
    pathIndex = selectPath(pathWeights); // Weighted random selection
    sendFragment(fragments[i], paths[pathIndex]);
}
```

*   **Data Structures:**

    *   `PathProfile`: Stores KPI data for each path (latency, bandwidth, packet loss, jitter).
    *   `PathWeight`: A floating-point value representing the proportion of data to send via a given path.
    *   `Fragment`: A portion of the original packet, containing sequence number, path identifier, and data.

*   **Enhancements:**

    *   **Path Diversity:** Prioritize paths that offer different routing characteristics to improve resilience against network outages.
    *   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** Use machine learning to detect unusual network behavior and proactively adjust path weights.
    *   **Integration with SDN:** Integrate with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) controllers to dynamically provision and manage network paths.
