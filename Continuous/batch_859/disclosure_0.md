## Adaptive Resource Allocation Based on Code Complexity Metrics

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Code Complexity Analyzer (CCA) – a module integrated into the resource allocation system.
*   **Input:** Source code of the program to be executed.
*   **CCA Functionality:**
    *   Static analysis of the source code to determine Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead Volume, and lines of code.
    *   Dynamic analysis (during initial execution phases) to capture branch coverage and identify frequently executed code paths.
    *   Normalization of complexity metrics into a single "Complexity Score."
*   **Resource Allocation Module:**
    *   Receives Complexity Score from CCA.
    *   Maintains a lookup table mapping Complexity Scores to suggested resource allocations (CPU cores, memory, network bandwidth).  This table is initially populated with default values but learns over time via machine learning (see Learning Module).
    *   If a virtual machine instance doesn’t have sufficient resources, the system requests a new instance or dynamically scales an existing one.
*   **Learning Module:**
    *   Monitors the performance of program execution (response time, error rate, CPU utilization).
    *   Uses reinforcement learning to refine the mapping between Complexity Scores and resource allocations in the lookup table.  The reward function is based on maximizing performance while minimizing resource consumption.
    *   Personalized profiles: The Learning Module also builds profiles for specific users/applications to tailor resource allocation even further.
*   **Containerization:** Programs are always executed within containers to facilitate resource isolation and dynamic scaling.
*   **Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of container resource utilization during program execution to detect anomalies and trigger further adjustments if needed.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On receiving a code execution request:

ComplexityScore = CodeComplexityAnalyzer(ProgramCode)

SuggestedAllocation = LookupTable[ComplexityScore]

If VMInstance.AvailableResources < SuggestedAllocation:
    RequestNewVMInstance(SuggestedAllocation)
    VMInstance = NewVMInstance

CreateContainer(VMInstance, SuggestedAllocation)
ExecuteProgram(Container, ProgramArguments)

// During Execution:
MonitorContainerResources(Container)
If ResourceUsage > Threshold:
    AdjustAllocation(Container, Increase/Decrease)

// Learning Module (background process):
For Each Completed Execution:
    Reward = PerformanceMetric - ResourceCost
    UpdateLookupTable(ComplexityScore, Reward)
```

**Innovation Detail:**

This system goes beyond simply reacting to performance failures (like the provided patent) by *proactively* predicting resource needs based on code complexity. The focus is on preventing bottlenecks *before* they occur. It’s a shift from reactive to predictive resource allocation.

The use of code complexity metrics (Cyclomatic Complexity, Halstead Volume) provides a quantifiable measure of the inherent difficulty of the program.  Combining this with dynamic analysis (branch coverage) gives a more accurate picture of what parts of the code are most likely to be resource-intensive. The reinforcement learning component allows the system to adapt to different workloads and user behaviors, continuously improving its accuracy over time.  Personalization can ensure that users with resource intensive applications have sufficient availability.
