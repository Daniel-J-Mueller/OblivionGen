**Adaptive Multi-Modal Alert System**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing call notification system to incorporate real-time environmental awareness and personalized multi-modal alerts beyond audio. The system will not just *announce* an incoming call, but *adapt* how it alerts based on user activity, environment, and pre-defined preferences, and importantly, *anticipate* needs.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced Adapter:** The existing adapter will be upgraded to include:
    *   **Microphone Array:** For advanced noise cancellation and source localization.
    *   **Environmental Sensors:**  Temperature, light, motion detection.
    *   **Bluetooth/Zigbee Module:**  For communication with wearable devices and smart home systems.
    *   **Low-Power Processor:**  For edge computing and sensor data processing.
*   **Wearable Integration:** Support for integration with smartwatches, fitness trackers, and other wearables capable of haptic feedback and displaying notifications.
*   **Smart Home Integration:**  Compatibility with popular smart home platforms (e.g., Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit) for control of lighting, thermostats, and other devices.

**III. Software & Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Core Function: ProcessIncomingCall(callData, userData, environmentalData)

function ProcessIncomingCall(callData, userData, environmentalData) {
    // 1. User Activity Detection (from wearable data)
    activity = GetUserActivity(userData.wearableData); // e.g., "walking", "driving", "meeting", "sleeping"

    // 2. Environmental Context (from adapter sensors & smart home)
    environment = GetEnvironmentalContext(environmentalData); // e.g., "loud environment", "dark room", "home", "office"

    // 3. Alert Mode Selection (based on activity & environment)
    alertMode = SelectAlertMode(activity, environment, userData.preferences);

    // 4. Alert Execution
    ExecuteAlert(alertMode, callData);
}

function SelectAlertMode(activity, environment, preferences) {
    if (activity == "driving") {
        return "HapticSteeringWheel" + "VoiceGuidance";
    } else if (activity == "meeting" && environment == "office") {
        return "VibrateWatch" + "SilentNotification";
    } else if (activity == "sleeping") {
        return "GentleVibration" + "DoNotDisturb"; //Minimal disturbance
    } else if (environment == "loud environment") {
        return "StrongVibration" + "VisualNotification"; //Overcome noise
    } else {
        return preferences.defaultAlertMode; //User-defined
    }
}

function ExecuteAlert(alertMode, callData) {
    if (alertMode.includes("HapticSteeringWheel")) {
        SendHapticSignalToCar(callData.callerID);
    }
    if (alertMode.includes("VibrateWatch")) {
        SendVibrationToWatch(callData.callerID);
    }
    if (alertMode.includes("VoiceGuidance")) {
        SpeakCallerID(callData.callerID);
    }
    if (alertMode.includes("VisualNotification")) {
        DisplayCallerIDOnSmartDisplay();
    }
    if (alertMode.includes("SilentNotification")) {
        SendSilentNotificationToPhone();
    }
    if (alertMode.includes("GentleVibration")) {
       SendGentleVibrationToWearable();
    }
}
```

**IV.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Predictive Alerting:**  The system learns user routines and predicts when calls are likely to be important (e.g., during work hours, family dinner time) and adjusts alerting accordingly.
*   **Emotional Tone Detection:** Analyze the callerâ€™s voice (using cloud-based processing) and adjust alert intensity. For example, a distressed caller would trigger a more urgent alert.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  If the system detects that the user is engaged in a critical task (e.g., driving, presenting), it could automatically send an auto-reply message to the caller.
*   **Priority Contact List:** Allow users to assign priority levels to contacts, affecting alert intensity and notification methods.
*   **Geo-Fencing:** Trigger different alerts based on the user's location (e.g., more discreet alerts in public places).

**V.  Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with augmented reality headsets for visual caller identification and contextual information.
*   Support for emergency alerts and automatic connection to emergency services.
*   Integration with healthcare devices to prioritize calls from medical professionals.
