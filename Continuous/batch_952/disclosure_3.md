## Adaptive Emotional Response System – Media Immersion

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of detecting user perception *during* media consumption, but shift the focus from purely technical quality (audio, video, network) to *emotional* response. Instead of adjusting technical parameters, adjust the *content itself* – not by altering the core media, but by layering supplementary sensory input.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Audio stream (primary content)
    *   Video stream (primary content)
    *   Real-time ASR transcript of user vocalizations (adjacent audio)
    *   Biometric data: heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (GSR) – captured via wearable sensor.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Emotion Classification Module:** Trained AI model classifying user emotional state (joy, sadness, fear, anger, neutral) based on ASR transcript *and* biometric data.  Prioritize biometric data as ground truth, using ASR for contextual understanding.
    *   **Sensory Layer Database:** Library of pre-recorded, short-duration sensory stimuli categorized by emotional valence (positive/negative) and arousal level (high/low). Stimuli include:
        *   **Haptic Patterns:**  Vibrations delivered via wearable device (vest, wristband). Intensity and pattern correlate to emotional state.
        *   **Ambient Lighting:**  Dynamic color and intensity changes via smart lighting system.
        *   **Spatial Audio Cues:**  Subtle sound effects (e.g., gentle wind, crackling fire) delivered via spatial audio headphones.
        *   **Aromatic Diffusion:**  Controlled release of scents (e.g., lavender for calm, citrus for energy) via wearable diffuser.
    *   **Adaptive Layering Engine:**  Algorithm selecting and triggering appropriate sensory stimuli based on:
        *   Current classified emotional state.
        *   Content being consumed (genre, scene type – pre-tagged metadata).
        *   User preference profile (sensitivity levels for each sensory modality).
*   **Output:**
    *   Triggered sensory stimuli delivered via connected devices.
    *   Adaptive adjustments to stimulus intensity and pattern over time.
    *   Logged emotional response data for ongoing system refinement.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Load User Profile (preferences, sensitivities)
Load Sensory Layer Database
Establish Connection to Sensory Output Devices

// Real-time Processing Loop
While (Media Session Active) {
  Capture Audio Stream & Video Stream
  Capture Biometric Data (HRV, GSR)
  Transcribe Audio Stream to Text (ASR)
  Classify Emotional State (Emotional State = Analyze(Biometric Data, ASR))
  Determine Content Context (Context = Analyze(Video Stream, Metadata))
  Select Sensory Stimulus (Stimulus = SelectStimulus(Emotional State, Context, User Profile))
  Trigger Sensory Stimulus (Activate(Stimulus))
  Log Emotional Response & Stimulus (Save(Emotional State, Stimulus))
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond technical quality adjustment. It actively shapes the *user's emotional experience* during media consumption. The layered sensory stimuli create a more immersive and personalized experience, and the system can potentially influence the user's emotional state.  The combination of biometric and linguistic analysis is key, prioritizing physiological data for accuracy while using language for contextualization.
