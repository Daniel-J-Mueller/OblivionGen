## Predictive Failure Escalation & Automated Remediation Orchestration

**Specification:** A system that leverages diagnostic test metadata, aggregated metrics, and machine learning to predict *escalation* needs *before* a threshold is exceeded, then automatically orchestrates remediation workflows, dynamically adapting based on real-time feedback.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Escalation Predictor:**
    *   Input: Aggregated diagnostic information, historical metrics, diagnostic test metadata (functional attributes), time-series data.
    *   Model:  A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained on historical data of failures, escalations, and corresponding remediation actions.  The LSTM will analyze temporal patterns in the diagnostic data to predict the *probability of escalation* – not just failure – over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 30 minutes, next 2 hours).
    *   Output:  Escalation Probability Score (0.0 - 1.0) and a recommended escalation priority level (P1 - Critical, P2 - High, P3 - Medium, P4 - Low).

2.  **Remediation Workflow Orchestrator:**
    *   Input: Escalation Probability Score, recommended priority, diagnostic test results, affected host details, service level agreement (SLA) parameters.
    *   Logic:  A rule-based system *combined* with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent.
        *   **Rule-Based Component:** Defines initial remediation workflows based on specific diagnostic signatures and priority levels.  Example:  If the ‘CPU Utilization’ diagnostic test consistently returns ‘High’ and the Escalation Probability is > 0.8, initiate a ‘Scale-Up’ workflow.
        *   **RL Agent:**  Observes the outcome of remediation actions (success/failure, time to resolution) and learns to *optimize* remediation workflows over time. The RL agent will utilize Q-learning to determine the optimal action to take given the current state of the system.
    *   Output:  A sequence of automated remediation actions (e.g., restart service, scale up resources, isolate host, trigger automated script).

3.  **Dynamic Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitoring:  Continuously monitors the outcome of remediation actions using diagnostic tests and metrics.
    *   Adjustment:  Feeds the results back into the RL agent, allowing it to refine its policies and improve the effectiveness of remediation workflows. The RL agent will update its Q-table based on the observed rewards and penalties.
    *   Alerting:  If remediation actions fail or are ineffective, the system escalates the issue to a human operator, providing detailed diagnostic information and recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Remediation Workflow Orchestrator):**

```
function orchestrate_remediation(escalation_probability, priority, diagnostic_results, host_details, sla_parameters):
  if escalation_probability > 0.9 and priority == "P1":
    action = "isolate_host"
    execute_action(action, host_details)
  else if escalation_probability > 0.7 and priority == "P2":
    action = "scale_up_resources"
    execute_action(action, host_details)
  else:
    # Utilize RL agent to determine optimal action
    state = get_system_state(diagnostic_results, host_details)
    action = rl_agent.choose_action(state)
    execute_action(action, host_details)

  outcome = monitor_remediation(action, host_details)

  if outcome == "success":
    reward = 1
  else:
    reward = -1

  rl_agent.update_policy(state, action, reward)

  return outcome
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DiagnosticTestResult`:  {test_name: string, result: string, timestamp: datetime, metadata: dictionary}
*   `SystemState`: {cpu_utilization: float, memory_usage: float, disk_io: float, network_latency: float, diagnostic_results: list<DiagnosticTestResult>}
*   `QTable`:  {state: string, action: string, q_value: float}

**Novelty:** The combination of proactive escalation prediction (going beyond simple failure detection) with dynamic, reinforcement learning-based remediation orchestration creates a self-optimizing system that reduces downtime and improves service reliability. It moves from reactive problem solving to preventative action.
