**Personalized Predictive Asset Streaming for Augmented Reality Environments**

**Specification:**

**I. System Overview**

The system comprises three core modules: a Predictive Analysis Engine (PAE), an Asset Management System (AMS), and an AR Environment Interface (AEI).  It’s designed to proactively stream digital assets (3D models, textures, audio, procedural generation seeds) to an AR device *before* the user explicitly requests them, optimized for seamless AR experiences.  Unlike pre-caching based on general popularity, this leverages a multi-faceted predictive model focusing on *contextual* user intent *within* the AR environment.

**II. Predictive Analysis Engine (PAE)**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **AR Environment State:** Real-time data from the AEI regarding the user’s location within the AR environment, objects the user is looking at (via eye-tracking or AR camera data), detected gestures, and environmental factors (lighting, sound).
    *   **User History:** Browsing history, purchasing history (as per the provided patent), app usage, previously viewed/interacted with AR assets, and explicit user preferences (if available).  Crucially, this is augmented with *implicit* feedback gathered from within the AR environment – duration of gaze on an object, frequency of interaction, and proximity to specific assets.
    *   **Social Context:**  Optional integration with social networks or AR multi-user environments to analyze the assets other users nearby are interacting with, inferring potential interest.
    *   **World Knowledge Graph:** A dynamically updated knowledge graph containing semantic relationships between AR objects, locations, and user intents. For example, if the user is looking at a historical building, the graph could suggest relevant artifacts or historical figures.
*   **Prediction Model:** A hybrid model combining:
    *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):** Trained on sequential AR environment state data to predict the user’s next point of interest or intended action.
    *   **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):**  Used to reason over the world knowledge graph and identify relevant assets based on the user’s current context.
    *   **Collaborative Filtering:** Leverages user history and social context to recommend assets that similar users have found interesting.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of predicted assets, along with a confidence score and a delivery time estimate.

**III. Asset Management System (AMS)**

*   **Asset Repository:** A distributed storage system optimized for streaming high-fidelity AR assets.
*   **Asset Adaptation:**  Dynamically adjusts asset quality (resolution, polygon count, texture size) based on the user’s device capabilities, network conditions, and predicted viewing distance.  Supports both lossless and lossy compression techniques.
*   **Progressive Streaming:**  Breaks down assets into smaller chunks and streams them progressively, allowing the user to start interacting with the asset before the entire file is downloaded.
*   **Asset Prioritization:**  Based on the PAE’s confidence scores and delivery time estimates, prioritizes asset streaming to ensure that the most relevant assets are available when the user needs them.

**IV. AR Environment Interface (AEI)**

*   **Real-time State Capture:** Captures real-time data about the AR environment, including the user’s location, gaze direction, gestures, and detected objects.
*   **Asset Rendering:**  Renders the streamed assets within the AR environment, seamlessly integrating them with the real-world surroundings.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Provides feedback to the PAE about the user’s interactions with the assets, allowing the predictive model to be continuously refined.

**Pseudocode – Predictive Asset Streaming Loop:**

```
WHILE AR_Environment_Active:
    environment_state = AEI.capture_state()
    predicted_assets = PAE.predict(environment_state, user_history)

    FOR asset IN predicted_assets:
        IF asset.not_already_streamed:
            adapted_asset = AMS.adapt(asset, device_capabilities, network_conditions)
            AMS.stream(adapted_asset, delivery_time)

    user_interaction = AEI.capture_interaction()
    PAE.update_model(user_interaction)
END WHILE
```

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simply preloading based on historical data. It actively *predicts* what assets the user will need *within* the AR environment, based on their current context and a dynamically updated knowledge graph. This allows for a much more seamless and immersive AR experience. The integration of a feedback loop continuously improves the accuracy of the predictive model. It’s fundamentally different from static pre-caching or reactive asset loading.
