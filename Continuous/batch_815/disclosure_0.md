## Temporal Data Reconstruction via Predictive Caching

**Concept:** Expand the validity map concept to incorporate *predictive* caching based on user behavior patterns and data dependencies. Instead of simply marking data as overwritten or not, the system anticipates future data needs and proactively caches versions likely to be requested *before* they are explicitly overwritten. This allows for seamless rollback and reconstruction of user data states at specific points in time, even if the overwritten data is no longer directly accessible.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler:**
    *   Module responsible for monitoring user data access patterns.
    *   Records timestamps, data IDs, and user actions associated with data access.
    *   Employs machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to predict future data access based on historical patterns.
    *   Outputs a “probability of access” score for each data portion.

2.  **Dependency Graph:**
    *   Maintains a graph representing dependencies between data portions.  (e.g., an object in a game references textures, sounds, and other game assets)
    *   Updates automatically based on data creation and modification events.
    *   Used to identify data portions likely to be affected by an overwrite operation.

3.  **Predictive Cache:**
    *   Separate storage tier (e.g., fast SSD or in-memory cache).
    *   Data portions are cached based on:
        *   High “probability of access” score from the Behavioral Profiler.
        *   Identification as a dependent of a data portion being overwritten (from the Dependency Graph).
        *   A configurable “time-to-live” (TTL) for cached data.
    *   Implements a Least Recently Used (LRU) or similar eviction policy.

4.  **Enhanced Validity Map:**
    *   Expands the original validity map to include:
        *   A “generation count” for each data portion (incremented with each overwrite).
        *   A “cached status” flag indicating whether the data portion is present in the Predictive Cache.
    *   Used by the Retrieval Entity to select the appropriate data version.

5.  **Retrieval Entity Logic:**
    *   Upon a data request:
        1.  Check the Enhanced Validity Map for the data portion.
        2.  If the “cached status” is set, retrieve the data from the Predictive Cache.
        3.  If not cached, retrieve the latest version from Authoritative Storage.
        4.  If a specific generation count is requested (e.g., for rollback), check the Predictive Cache for that version. If not found, attempt retrieval from archival storage.

**Pseudocode (Retrieval Entity):**

```
function retrieveData(dataID, generationCount = null):
  validityMapEntry = getValidityMapEntry(dataID)

  if validityMapEntry.cachedStatus:
    data = getFromPredictiveCache(dataID)
    return data

  if generationCount != null:
    data = getFromPredictiveCache(dataID, generationCount)
    if data == null:
        data = getFromArchivalStorage(dataID, generationCount)
  else:
    data = getFromAuthoritativeStorage(dataID)

  return data
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ValidityMapEntry`:  `{dataID: String, generationCount: Int, cachedStatus: Boolean}`
*   `DependencyGraph`: `Adjacency List: {dataID: [dependentDataIDs]}`

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time collaborative editing (undo/redo functionality)
*   Game development (rollback to previous game states)
*   Version control systems
*   Data recovery and forensic analysis.
