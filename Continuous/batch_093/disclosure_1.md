## Autonomous System Digital Twin for Proactive Failure Prediction & Mitigation

**Concept:** Create a real-time digital twin of monitored Autonomous Systems (AS), leveraging the routing data described in the patent, but extending it with predictive modeling based on historical data and simulated traffic patterns. This moves beyond reactive health assessment to *proactive* failure prediction and automated mitigation.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Normalization Layer:**

*   **Input Sources:**
    *   External Routing Data (BGP, as in the patent).
    *   Internal Routing Data (from client networks).
    *   Network Performance Metrics (RTT, latency, jitter - *expand beyond* what’s in claim 15, adding packet loss, queue depth).
    *   Historical Network Logs (syslog, netflow – critical for building baselines).
    *   Geopolitical/External Event Feeds (potential for correlating external events with network anomalies -  think scheduled maintenance, large-scale events, cyberattacks).
*   **Normalization:**  Standardize data formats, timestamps, and metrics across all sources. Use a time-series database optimized for high ingestion rates and complex queries.
*   **Data Retention Policy:**  Adjustable retention based on data type and cost (e.g., raw metrics - 30 days, aggregated data - 1 year, event logs - indefinite).

**2. Digital Twin Construction:**

*   **Topology Mapping:**  Dynamically create a graph representation of each monitored AS based on routing data. Nodes represent routers/network devices, edges represent network links.  Implement link weighting based on bandwidth, latency, and cost.
*   **State Variables:**  Assign state variables to each node and edge (e.g., utilization, error rate, buffer occupancy). Update these variables in real-time based on ingested data.
*   **Traffic Simulation Engine:**  Develop a discrete-event simulation engine capable of modeling traffic flow through the digital twin. This will be used for predictive analysis and what-if scenarios.
*   **Baseline Generation:**  Establish baseline behavior for each AS based on historical data. Use statistical methods (e.g., time-series analysis, anomaly detection algorithms) to identify normal operating conditions.

**3. Predictive Modeling & Anomaly Detection:**

*   **Machine Learning Models:** Train ML models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks) to predict future network behavior.  Input features will include historical data, current state variables, and external event feeds.
*   **Anomaly Detection Algorithms:**  Implement anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., isolation forests, one-class SVMs) to identify deviations from baseline behavior.  Set customizable thresholds for alerting.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Develop algorithms to automatically identify potential root causes of anomalies (e.g., overloaded links, failing devices, misconfigured routers).

**4. Automated Mitigation & Control Plane Integration:**

*   **Dynamic Path Optimization:**  Implement algorithms to dynamically adjust routing paths based on predicted congestion or failures.  This could involve leveraging software-defined networking (SDN) principles.
*   **Traffic Shaping & Prioritization:**  Automatically adjust traffic shaping and prioritization policies to mitigate congestion and ensure critical applications receive sufficient bandwidth.
*   **Automated Failover:**  Trigger automated failover procedures to switch traffic to redundant paths or devices in the event of a failure.
*   **Control Plane Integration:** Integrate with existing network management systems and SDN controllers to automate mitigation actions.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Path Optimization):**

```
function optimize_path(source, destination, current_path, predicted_congestion):
    // Simulate traffic flow along current_path
    simulated_congestion = simulate_traffic(current_path, predicted_congestion)

    // Evaluate simulated congestion
    if simulated_congestion > threshold:
        // Find alternative paths
        alternative_paths = find_alternative_paths(source, destination)

        // Evaluate alternative paths
        best_path = evaluate_paths(alternative_paths, predicted_congestion)

        // Return best path
        return best_path
    else:
        // Return current path
        return current_path
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Failure Prediction:**  Moves beyond reactive health monitoring to predict and prevent failures before they occur.
*   **Real-Time Digital Twin:**  Creates a dynamic, up-to-date model of the network, enabling accurate simulation and analysis.
*   **Automated Mitigation:**  Automates the process of identifying and resolving network problems, reducing manual intervention.
*   **Integration with External Event Feeds:**  Considers external factors that may impact network performance, improving prediction accuracy.
