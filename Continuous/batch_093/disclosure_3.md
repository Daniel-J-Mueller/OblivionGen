## Dynamic Rule Composition & Predictive Caching

**Concept:** Expand beyond pre-computed results for *known* rules to a system that dynamically composes rules based on content characteristics and *predictively* caches results for rule combinations *before* a request is even made. This addresses the scalability issues of pre-computation when dealing with highly variable content and rule sets.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Content item (text, image, video, etc.).
*   **Process:** Extract a vector of features representing the content. Features include:
    *   Textual: Keywords, sentiment score, topic modeling output, entity recognition results.
    *   Visual: Dominant colors, object detection (people, cars, logos), aesthetic quality score.
    *   Metadata: Author, creation date, geographic location.
*   **Output:** Feature vector – a numerical representation of the content.

**2. Rule Library & Composition Engine:**

*   **Rule Representation:** Rules are defined as composable functions that operate on the content feature vector.  Example: `Rule_Prurulent_Content(feature_vector)` returns a boolean.
*   **Dynamic Composition:**
    *   Based on the content feature vector, a “rule profile” is generated. This profile identifies the most relevant rules to apply.  (e.g., if the sentiment score is negative, include rules related to offensive content; if logos are detected, include rules related to copyright.)
    *   Rules within the profile are combined to create a composite rule. This composite rule defines the overall evaluation logic.
*   **Output:** Composite rule (a function that takes a feature vector and returns a decision – present/block/modify).

**3. Predictive Caching Layer:**

*   **Prediction Model:** Trained on historical content access patterns and feature similarities.  The model predicts which content items are likely to be requested next.
*   **Pre-Computation Queue:** Based on the prediction model, a queue of content items is maintained for pre-computation.
*   **Cache Update:** As content items are accessed, the cache is updated with the pre-computed results of the composite rule applied to that item.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement a time-to-live (TTL) for cached results, as rules may change or content may be updated.

**4. Request Handling Flow:**

1.  Receive request for content item.
2.  Extract feature vector from content item.
3.  Generate rule profile based on feature vector.
4.  Compose composite rule from rule profile.
5.  **Cache Lookup:** Check if the result for this content item and composite rule is in the cache.
    *   **Cache Hit:** Return cached result.
    *   **Cache Miss:**
        *   Apply composite rule to content item (asynchronously).
        *   Store result in cache.
        *   Return result.

**Pseudocode for Request Handling (Simplified):**

```
function handleRequest(contentItem):
  featureVector = extractFeatures(contentItem)
  ruleProfile = generateRuleProfile(featureVector)
  compositeRule = composeRule(ruleProfile)

  cachedResult = cache.lookup(contentItem, compositeRule)

  if cachedResult:
    return cachedResult
  else:
    result = compositeRule(featureVector)
    cache.store(contentItem, compositeRule, result)
    return result
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Cache:** Utilize a distributed caching system (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to handle a large volume of cached results.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** Offload the rule application and cache update tasks to a worker queue (e.g., Celery, RabbitMQ) to avoid blocking the request thread.
*   **Feature Vector Compression:** Compress the feature vector to reduce storage and transmission costs.
*   **Cache Partitioning:** Partition the cache based on content type or other criteria to improve performance.
