## Dynamic Textile Mapping & Robotic Assembly

**Concept:** Extend the panel arrangement and automated cutting to include real-time textile defect detection *during* printing and dynamic re-mapping of panel layouts to avoid defects, coupled with a multi-robot assembly system that integrates directly with the cutting output.

**Specs:**

**1. Defect Detection Module:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** High-resolution camera system (visible light + infrared) integrated into the textile printer carriage.  Integrated near-field acoustic sensor to detect yarn breaks or weave inconsistencies.
*   **Real-Time Analysis:**  Onboard edge computing capable of running image/acoustic processing algorithms.  Algorithms trained to identify:
    *   Color variations exceeding a defined threshold.
    *   Weave/knit distortions.
    *   Yarn breaks/thin spots.
    *   Stains/blemishes.
*   **Defect Mapping:** Creates a live digital map of textile defects with precise coordinates.  This map is integrated into the panel layout algorithm.

**2. Dynamic Panel Layout Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Tech pack data, textile type, defect map, order priority.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Initial layout generated based on tech pack and textile type (as per the base patent).
    2.  Defect map overlaid on the layout.
    3.  Algorithm iteratively adjusts panel positions to:
        *   Avoid placing critical areas of panels over defects.
        *   Minimize textile waste around defects.
        *   Prioritize defect avoidance for panels with high aesthetic requirements.
    4.  If a defect is unavoidable for a critical panel area, the algorithm flags the panel for potential material substitution or manual inspection.
    5.  Outputs updated panel layout with precise cutting coordinates.
*   **Optimization:**  Algorithm balances defect avoidance, waste minimization, and production time.  User-defined parameters allow adjustment of these priorities.

**3. Robotic Assembly System:**

*   **Configuration:** Multiple (minimum 3) collaborative robots (cobots) equipped with:
    *   Vacuum grippers with adjustable suction force.
    *   Vision systems for panel identification.
    *   Force/torque sensors for delicate manipulation.
*   **Integration:**  Cobots positioned directly after the textile cutter.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Panel Identification:** Cobot uses vision system to identify panels based on unique identifiers (as per patent claims 10-13), or by visually identifying the panel's shape.
    2.  **Panel Transfer:** Cobot picks up panel from cutting table and places it into a designated assembly tote.
    3.  **Assembly Tote Routing:**  Assembly totes are automatically routed to different assembly stations based on the product type. (Claim 13 of source patent)
    4.  **Assembly Instructions Delivery:** Digital assembly instructions (from tech pack - Claim 2 of source patent) are displayed at each assembly station, guiding workers through the assembly process.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Panel Layout Algorithm - simplified):**

```
FUNCTION generateLayout(techPack, textileType, defectMap):
  INITIALIZE layout WITH basic panel arrangement BASED ON techPack AND textileType
  FOR EACH defect IN defectMap:
    FOR EACH panel IN layout:
      IF panel OVERLAPS defect:
        FIND alternate position FOR panel THAT minimizes waste AND avoids defects
        IF alternate position found:
          MOVE panel TO alternate position
        ELSE:
          FLAG panel FOR manual inspection
  RETURN updated layout
```

**Material Considerations:** Develop a textile coating that allows for easier identification of defects via automated sensing systems. Consider integrating micro-tags within the textile weave during production to create a more robust defect tracking system.
