## Dynamic Complexity-Based GOP Structuring

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive encoding concept by dynamically adjusting the GOP structure itself – not just encoding *within* a GOP – based on scene complexity *and* predicted viewer attention.

**Specifications:**

**1. Complexity Assessment Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw video frames.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Spatial Complexity:** Calculate a per-frame spatial complexity score using a combination of:
        *   Variance of luma values.
        *   Edge density (using Sobel or similar operators).
        *   Texture analysis (e.g., using Local Binary Patterns).
    *   **Temporal Complexity:**  Calculate a per-frame temporal complexity score by:
        *   Optical flow analysis – measuring the magnitude and direction of motion vectors.
        *   Frame differencing – calculating the sum of absolute differences between consecutive frames.
        *   Scene change detection – identifying abrupt transitions in luminance, color, or motion.
    *   **Combined Complexity Score:**  Weighted sum of spatial and temporal complexity scores. Weights are adjustable parameters.
*   **Output:** Per-frame complexity score.

**2. Attention Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Video frames, audio track (if available).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Visual Saliency:** Use a deep learning model (trained on eye-tracking data) to predict visual saliency – areas in the frame that are most likely to attract viewer attention.
    *   **Auditory Saliency:**  Analyze the audio track for prominent sounds (speech, music, sound effects) that might draw viewer attention.
    *   **Combined Attention Score:** Weighted sum of visual and auditory saliency scores. Weights are adjustable parameters.
*   **Output:** Per-frame attention score.

**3. Dynamic GOP Structuring Module:**

*   **Input:** Per-frame complexity scores, per-frame attention scores, target bitrate/quality.
*   **Process:**
    *   **GOP Length Determination:**
        *   **High Complexity/Attention:** Short GOP length (e.g., 2-4 frames). This ensures faster error recovery and minimizes the impact of transmission errors on important scenes.
        *   **Low Complexity/Attention:** Long GOP length (e.g., 8-16 frames).  This improves compression efficiency and reduces overhead.
    *   **Keyframe Placement:**
        *   Keyframes are strategically placed at the beginning of high-complexity/attention segments.
        *   The frequency of keyframes is dynamically adjusted based on the rate of change in complexity/attention.
    *   **B-Frame Utilization:**
        *   Increase the number of B-frames in low-complexity/attention segments to maximize compression.
        *   Reduce the number of B-frames in high-complexity/attention segments to reduce encoding/decoding complexity and improve responsiveness.
*   **Output:** GOP structure parameters (GOP length, keyframe placement, B-frame utilization).

**4. Encoding Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Video frames, GOP structure parameters.
*   **Process:**
    *   Integrate the dynamic GOP structure parameters into the video encoder.
    *   Encode the video using the specified GOP structure and encoding parameters.
*   **Output:** Encoded video stream.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic GOP Structuring Module):**

```
function determine_gop_structure(complexity_score, attention_score, target_bitrate):
  if complexity_score > threshold_high and attention_score > threshold_high:
    gop_length = 2
    keyframe_interval = 1
    bframe_ratio = 0.2
  elif complexity_score > threshold_medium or attention_score > threshold_medium:
    gop_length = 4
    keyframe_interval = 2
    bframe_ratio = 0.4
  else:
    gop_length = 8
    keyframe_interval = 4
    bframe_ratio = 0.6

  return gop_length, keyframe_interval, bframe_ratio
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved video quality, especially in complex and attention-grabbing scenes.
*   Reduced bandwidth consumption during less important segments.
*   Faster error recovery and more robust video playback.
*   Enhanced user experience.
