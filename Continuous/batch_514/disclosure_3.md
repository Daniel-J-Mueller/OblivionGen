## Personalized Meal Component Prediction & Automated Grocery Integration

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:** Historical order data (as per the patent), real-time contextual data (location, activity, calendar, weather, traffic), biometric data (heart rate variability, sleep patterns - *optional, user opt-in only*), declared dietary preferences & restrictions, declared health goals (weight loss, muscle gain, etc.).
*   **Core Component:** A multi-layered prediction model.
    *   Layer 1: *Meal Timing Prediction* – Uses historical data & real-time context to predict *when* a user will likely want a meal (existing functionality in the patent).
    *   Layer 2: *Meal Type Prediction* – Predicts *what type* of meal the user will want (e.g., Italian, Salad, Sandwich) based on historical data, context, and declared preferences. This is a classification problem.
    *   Layer 3: *Component Prediction* – This is the novel layer.  Predicts the *individual components* of the meal the user will want (e.g., grilled chicken, brown rice, steamed broccoli). This leverages a knowledge graph of food pairings and nutritional profiles.
*   **Knowledge Graph:** A structured database containing:
    *   Food items and their nutritional information (calories, macronutrients, vitamins, minerals).
    *   Food pairings – which ingredients commonly appear together in meals.  This is derived from a massive dataset of recipes and menu items.
    *   Ingredient substitutes – alternatives for ingredients based on dietary restrictions or preferences (e.g., tofu for chicken, quinoa for rice).
    *   Nutritional synergy – ingredients which combine to offer enhanced nutritional benefits.
*   **Grocery Integration:**  Direct API integration with grocery delivery services (Instacart, Amazon Fresh, etc.).
*   **User Interface:**  Minimalist. Primarily operates in the background.  Provides the user with:
    *   Predicted meal suggestions (optional preview).
    *   Ability to override predictions.
    *   Control over data sharing preferences.
*   **Hardware:** Standard mobile device, server infrastructure for data processing & model training.

**Pseudocode (Component Prediction):**

```
FUNCTION PredictMealComponents(user_id, current_context):
  // 1. Retrieve user's historical data
  historical_orders = GetHistoricalOrders(user_id)
  preferences = GetUserPreferences(user_id)

  // 2. Determine likely meal type based on historical data & context
  meal_type = PredictMealType(historical_orders, current_context, preferences)

  // 3. Query the knowledge graph for components associated with the meal type
  candidate_components = QueryKnowledgeGraph(meal_type)

  // 4. Filter candidate components based on user preferences & dietary restrictions
  filtered_components = FilterComponents(candidate_components, preferences)

  // 5. Score components based on:
  //    - Frequency of appearance in user's historical orders
  //    - Nutritional synergy with other components
  //    - Current context (e.g., weather, activity - a light salad on a hot day)
  scored_components = ScoreComponents(filtered_components, historical_orders, current_context)

  // 6. Select top N components (e.g., 3-5)
  predicted_components = SelectTopN(scored_components, N)

  // 7. Check if the user has enough ingredients on hand. If not, add to grocery list.
  FOR component IN predicted_components:
    IF component NOT IN user_pantry:
      AddIngredientToGroceryList(component)

  RETURN predicted_components
```

**Innovation Summary:** This extends predictive ordering beyond simply *when* and *what type* of meal, to *specifically what components* the user will want, proactively adding any missing ingredients to a grocery list. It aims to simplify meal preparation and promote healthier eating habits. The core is a dynamic knowledge graph and layered prediction model.
