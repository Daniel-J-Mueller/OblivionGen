**Personalized Sensory Environments – “MoodCast”**

**Specification:** A system leveraging pre-travel data & onboard content distribution to proactively curate personalized sensory experiences for passengers. This extends beyond audio/video to incorporate subtle environmental controls.

**Components:**

*   **Pre-Travel Profiler:** User app/web interface. Gathers:
    *   Travel itinerary (flight/train details, duration).
    *   Biometric data (optional, via wearable integration – heart rate variability, sleep patterns).
    *   Mood/preference questionnaire (calming, energizing, focus, etc.).
    *   Ambient preference selections (color palettes, scent profiles - digitally recreated).
*   **“MoodCast” Server:** Central processing unit.
    *   Receives pre-travel data.
    *   Analyzes data to generate a "sensory profile" for the passenger.
    *   Selects & prepares content packages:
        *   Audio (music, ambient soundscapes, guided meditations).
        *   Visual (dynamic lighting schemes, curated image/video playlists, abstract animations).
        *   Haptic (subtle seat vibrations – frequency/pattern determined by sensory profile).
        *   Olfactory (digital scent diffusion – onboard scent cartridge control – lavender, citrus, pine, etc.).
*   **Onboard Distribution Network:**
    *   Existing cloud content system (as in the provided patent).
    *   Extended to control:
        *   Seat-integrated lighting.
        *   Seat-integrated haptic transducers.
        *   Localized scent diffusion system (individual vents near passenger head).
*   **Passenger Control Interface:** Limited override controls within the passenger interface (brightness, volume, scent intensity). The system is designed to be largely automated to maximize effect.
*   **AI Learning Loop:** System monitors passenger biometric data (if available) *during* travel to refine the sensory profile in real time and improve future experiences.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// On MoodCast Server:

function generateSensoryProfile(travelData, moodData, biometricData):
  profile = {}
  profile.travelDuration = travelData.duration
  profile.mood = moodData.preferences
  profile.biometrics = biometricData

  if profile.mood == "calming":
    profile.lighting = "blue/green hues"
    profile.audio = "ambient soundscapes"
    profile.haptics = "low-frequency vibrations"
    profile.scent = "lavender"
  else if profile.mood == "energizing":
    profile.lighting = "bright orange/yellow"
    profile.audio = "upbeat music"
    profile.haptics = "pulsating vibrations"
    profile.scent = "citrus"
  // ... other mood profiles ...

  return profile

function prepareContentPackage(sensoryProfile):
  package = {}
  package.audio = selectAudio(sensoryProfile)
  package.visual = selectVisuals(sensoryProfile)
  package.haptics = generateHapticPattern(sensoryProfile)
  package.scent = selectScent(sensoryProfile)
  return package

// Onboard System:
function applySensoryProfile(contentPackage):
  controlLighting(contentPackage.visual)
  playAudio(contentPackage.audio)
  activateHaptics(contentPackage.haptics)
  diffuseScent(contentPackage.scent)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple content delivery to active environmental manipulation. The integration of multiple sensory modalities (visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory) offers a more immersive and personalized experience. The AI learning loop creates a dynamically adaptive system that continually improves its effectiveness. This goes beyond entertainment – it aims to enhance well-being and reduce travel stress.
