**Automated Personal Shopping Assistant - ‘Follow Me’ Mode**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Mobile Robotic Unit (MRU) - Roughly the size of a large shopping basket, equipped with:
    *   High-resolution multi-spectral camera array (visible, thermal, depth).
    *   Lidar and ultrasonic sensors for obstacle avoidance.
    *   Secure compartment for item storage (locking mechanism).
    *   High-bandwidth wireless communication (5G/WiFi 6E).
    *   Internal power supply (rechargeable).
    *   Audio input/output for voice commands/feedback.
*   **User Interface:** Dedicated mobile application (iOS/Android) + optional smart-glasses integration.
*   **Facility Integration:** Requires pre-mapping of the materials handling facility (warehouse, store, etc.).  Digital twin of the facility stored locally on the MRU and on central servers.  Integration with existing inventory management systems (API access).

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** User launches the mobile app, authenticates, and selects "Follow Me" mode. The app establishes a secure connection with a designated MRU.
2.  **MRU Activation:** The MRU powers on and begins navigating to the user’s current location (determined via Bluetooth beacon, UWB, or app-based location services).
3.  **‘Follow Me’ Engagement:** The MRU enters a ‘follow’ state. It maintains a pre-defined safe distance from the user, utilizing sensor fusion (lidar, camera, ultrasonic) to avoid collisions.  The safe distance is adjustable via the mobile app.
4.  **Item Selection:** The user physically picks items as usual.  A high-resolution camera system integrated into the MRU scans each item *as it is placed within the MRU’s compartment*.  The system automatically identifies the item using computer vision and image recognition (trained on a vast database of product images).  If the item is not immediately recognized, the user can manually input the item's barcode or a keyword via the app.
5.  **Real-time Inventory Tracking:** The app displays a real-time list of items added to the MRU, along with the current total cost.
6.  **Navigation Assistance:**  If the user requests assistance finding a specific item (via voice command or app input), the MRU’s onboard navigation system can guide them to the appropriate location within the facility, displaying a route on the app and providing verbal directions.
7.  **Automated Checkout:** Upon exiting the transition area (or upon user command), the MRU automatically initiates a checkout process via secure API integration with the facility’s payment gateway. The user’s pre-authorized payment method is charged for the items in the MRU.
8.  **Receipt and Delivery:**  A digital receipt is sent to the user’s mobile app. The MRU then navigates to a designated delivery point (e.g., the user’s vehicle, a shipping station).

**Pseudocode (MRU Core Logic):**

```
// Initialization
connect_to_user_app()
load_facility_map()
activate_sensors()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  get_user_location()
  follow_user(user_location, safe_distance)

  scan_for_item_placement()
  if (item_placed) {
    identify_item()
    add_item_to_inventory()
    update_user_app()
  }

  if (exit_transition_detected()) {
    initiate_checkout()
    send_receipt()
    navigate_to_delivery_point()
    break
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply tracking items picked. It actively *follows* the user, becoming a mobile shopping cart and assistant. It’s a proactive rather than reactive system. The MRU isn't just a passive receiver of information; it’s an intelligent, autonomous agent.  It eliminates the need for traditional checkout lines and provides a more personalized and convenient shopping experience. It anticipates the user's needs and streamlines the entire process.
