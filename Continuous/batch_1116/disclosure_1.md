## Dynamic Spectral Response Mapping for Ambient Light Estimation

**Concept:** Extend ambient light estimation beyond simply correcting for infrared reflection. Introduce a system that actively maps the spectral response of surfaces in a scene and uses this information to refine ambient light calculations, improving accuracy across various lighting conditions and surface compositions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Hyperspectral Sensor Integration:** The camera device incorporates a miniature hyperspectral sensor alongside the standard RGB/IR sensor. This sensor captures light across a wider range of wavelengths than traditional sensors, enabling detailed surface spectral analysis. Resolution: 30-50 bands across the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400nm – 1000nm).
2.  **Spectral Database & Material Library:** A pre-populated database stores spectral signatures for common materials (wood, metal, plastic, fabric, skin tones, etc.). This database will be continuously updated via cloud connectivity and user contributions. Each entry includes a baseline reflectance curve and potential variation parameters.
3.  **Real-Time Spectral Analysis:** Incoming hyperspectral data is analyzed to identify the dominant materials within the scene. This employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., spectral angle mapper, support vector machines) to compare captured spectra to the database entries.
4.  **Dynamic Reflectance Map Generation:** The system creates a dynamic reflectance map for the scene. This map assigns a reflectance curve to each pixel or region of interest, reflecting the material’s spectral properties under the current lighting conditions. The map is a layer overlaid on the standard image data.
5.  **Lighting Environment Capture:** Alongside the scene, a secondary hyperspectral sensor captures the spectral distribution of the ambient light source. This provides a baseline for accurately calculating the effect of light on surfaces.
6.  **Adaptive Ambient Light Calculation:**
    *   Using the reflectance map, the captured ambient light spectrum, and a physically based rendering model, the system simulates the light interaction with each surface in the scene.
    *   This generates a refined estimate of the amount of light reflected from each surface.
    *   The refined light estimates are combined to calculate a more accurate overall ambient light value.
7.  **IR/Spectral Weighting:** The ambient light estimate considers the weighting of various spectral bands, including infrared. The weighting is adaptive and based on the dominant materials and lighting conditions.
8.  **Cloud-Based Calibration and Learning:** Device calibration data and user-provided environmental information are uploaded to the cloud. This data is used to refine the material library, improve the accuracy of the spectral analysis algorithms, and personalize the ambient light estimation for individual devices and users.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Capture data
hyperspectral_data = capture_hyperspectral_data()
ambient_light_spectrum = capture_ambient_light_spectrum()
image_data = capture_image_data()

// Material Identification
material_map = identify_materials(hyperspectral_data, material_library)

// Reflectance Map Generation
reflectance_map = generate_reflectance_map(material_map, ambient_light_spectrum)

// Light Simulation
simulated_light_values = simulate_light_interaction(reflectance_map, ambient_light_spectrum)

// Ambient Light Estimation
estimated_ambient_light = calculate_ambient_light(simulated_light_values)

// Apply Correction (if applicable)
corrected_ambient_light = apply_ir_correction(estimated_ambient_light, image_data)

// Output
output_ambient_light = corrected_ambient_light
```
