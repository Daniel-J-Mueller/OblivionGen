## Adaptive Predictive Warm Input Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the warm input concept to proactively prefetch and cache *multiple* potential future IDR/GOP sequences based on probabilistic prediction, creating a multi-layered, dynamically adjusted cache. This anticipates input switches *before* they are commanded, minimizing latency and buffering.

**Specs:**

*   **Prediction Engine:** A neural network trained on historical streaming data (GOP structure, IDR frequency, content type metadata – sports, news, movies) to predict upcoming IDR/GOP characteristics.  Outputs a probability distribution of likely future IDR/GOP sequences.
*   **Multi-Layer Cache:**  Instead of a single cache, maintain multiple "warm layers."
    *   **Layer 0 (Current):** The standard warm cache, holding the most recent IDR/GOP.
    *   **Layer 1-N (Predictive):**  Layers holding pre-fetched and decoded IDR/GOP sequences based on the prediction engine’s probability distribution.  Higher probability sequences are stored in more readily accessible layers (Layer 1 being fastest).
*   **Dynamic Layer Adjustment:**
    *   **Probability-Based Allocation:** The number of layers and the depth (number of IDR/GOPs stored) in each layer are dynamically adjusted based on the prediction engine’s confidence level and the probabilities of predicted sequences. High confidence = more layers/depth.
    *   **Resource Management:**  A resource manager component governs cache size. If resource constraints occur, lower probability layers are purged first.
*   **Switch Command Interception:**  When an input switch command arrives:
    *   The system *first* checks if a matching IDR/GOP sequence is already present in any warm layer.
    *   If found, the system immediately switches to that layer, bypassing the initial decoding phase.
    *   If not found, the system falls back to the standard warm cache or starts decoding from the live stream.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitor actual IDR/GOP structure against predictions. Use this data to refine the neural network and improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Parallel Decoding:** Continue decoding the live stream in parallel with prefetching and caching to ensure the predictive cache remains current.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Prediction Engine (Simplified)
function predictNextIDR(historicalData, contentMetadata):
    // Neural network processing
    probabilityDistribution = neuralNetwork.predict(historicalData, contentMetadata)
    return probabilityDistribution // e.g., {IDR_Sequence_A: 0.6, IDR_Sequence_B: 0.3, IDR_Sequence_C: 0.1}

// Warm Input Manager
onReceiveInputSwitchCommand(command):
    predictedSequences = predictNextIDR(historicalData, contentMetadata)
    for sequence, probability in predictedSequences:
        if sequenceExistsInWarmLayer(sequence):
            switchToWarmLayer(sequence)
            return // Switch successful
    switchToStandardWarmCache() // Fallback
    // Or, decode from live stream
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The neural network could be trained on a large dataset of streaming media.
*   The warm layers could be implemented using a fast, in-memory cache.
*   The resource manager should prioritize caching the most likely IDR/GOP sequences.
*   Consider using a hybrid approach, combining probabilistic prediction with a rule-based system.
