## Adaptive Hardware Root of Trust with Dynamic Attestation

**Concept:** Extending the signature/verification system to create a dynamically updating root of trust, embedded within the programmable logic itself, and leveraging time-sensitive signatures for enhanced security and resilience against replay attacks. This goes beyond simple configuration verification to actively *prove* ongoing hardware integrity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Component – Dynamic Root of Trust (DRT) Core:**

*   **Implementation:** A dedicated, hardened block within the programmable logic (FPGA/CPLD). This core is *not* reconfigurable via the second configuration data – it’s fixed during manufacturing or initial provisioning.
*   **Seed Generation:** The DRT core contains a true random number generator (TRNG) used to generate a unique, device-specific seed. This seed is *never* exposed outside the core.
*   **Signature Generation:** The DRT core uses the seed, a monotonic counter (incremented on each boot/reconfiguration cycle), and a cryptographic hash function (SHA-256 or better) to generate a primary hardware signature.
*   **Time-Based Augmentation:** A high-resolution real-time clock (RTC) is integrated. The current time (down to milliseconds) is incorporated into the signature generation process, creating a time-sensitive hardware signature.
*   **Secure Storage:**  A tamper-resistant, physically unclonable function (PUF) derived key is used to encrypt the seed and RTC value before storage within the DRT core.
*   **Attestation Interface:** A dedicated interface (e.g., JTAG or a custom protocol) allows external components to request an attestation challenge.

**2. System Architecture:**

*   **Boot Sequence:** Upon power-up, the DRT core initializes and generates its initial signature. This signature is used to seed the rest of the system.
*   **Configuration Verification:** The existing signature verification system continues to validate the programmable logic configuration data.  However, the *primary* signature verification now focuses on the DRT core's signature.
*   **Dynamic Attestation:**
    1.  An external attestation server sends a challenge to the device.
    2.  The DRT core uses the challenge, its seed, the current time, and a cryptographic function to generate a unique attestation token.
    3.  The device sends the attestation token to the server.
    4.  The server verifies the token using the known device seed (provisioned during manufacturing) and the expected time range.
*   **Reconfiguration Handling:** Any attempt to reconfigure the programmable logic triggers a new signature generation by the DRT core. The verification circuit compares the new signature against the expected signature (derived from the challenge). A mismatch indicates a potential compromise.

**3. Pseudocode (DRT Core Signature Generation):**

```
function generate_signature():
  seed = get_seed()
  timestamp = get_current_timestamp()
  combined_data = seed + timestamp
  signature = hash(combined_data)
  return signature

function generate_attestation_token(challenge):
  seed = get_seed()
  timestamp = get_current_timestamp()
  combined_data = seed + timestamp + challenge
  token = hash(combined_data)
  return token
```

**4.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Signature Rotation:** The seed can be periodically rotated (using a deterministic process based on the monotonic counter) to further enhance security.
*   **Remote Revocation:** A mechanism to remotely revoke a compromised device by updating the expected signature on the attestation server.
*   **Hardware-Based Key Derivation:** The DRT core can derive encryption keys based on the seed and timestamp for secure communication.

**Innovation:** This moves beyond static configuration verification to create a continuously verifiable hardware root of trust. The time-sensitive signatures prevent replay attacks and provide strong assurance of ongoing hardware integrity. The dynamic attestation process allows for remote verification and revocation of compromised devices.  This is a substantial improvement over relying solely on signature verification of configuration data.
