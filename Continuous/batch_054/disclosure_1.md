**Autonomous Device Swarm Acoustic Mapping & Localization**

**Concept:** Expand the beamforming and autonomous movement aspects of the patent to create a system where *multiple* small, mobile devices cooperatively map and localize sound sources in a complex environment – not just compensating for Doppler shift, but *using* it as a signal. Think of it as a distributed, mobile acoustic sensor network.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Hardware:**
    *   Micro-robotic platform (approx. 10cm diameter, wheeled or legged) – low cost, high quantity.
    *   Microphone array (4-8 elements, optimized for frequency range of interest).
    *   Miniature loudspeaker (for inter-device communication and potential active sensing).
    *   Embedded processing unit (ARM Cortex-M7 or equivalent).
    *   Short-range wireless communication (UWB or similar for precise inter-device ranging).
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for localization.
    *   Power source (small rechargeable battery).

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Distributed Beamforming:** Each device performs beamforming as described in the patent, but also shares beamforming weights and target/null direction data with neighboring devices.
    *   **Doppler Velocity Profiling:** Instead of solely *compensating* for Doppler shift, calculate the *velocity* of sound sources based on the received Doppler shift. This turns the system into a rudimentary acoustic radar.
    *   **Collaborative Localization:** Devices share their position estimates (from IMU and/or visual SLAM) and acoustic data. A central server (or distributed consensus algorithm) fuses this data to create a high-resolution map of sound source locations and their velocities.
    *   **Swarm Coordination:**  A swarm algorithm (e.g., flocking rules, particle swarm optimization) guides the devices to explore the environment and focus on areas with high acoustic activity.  Devices should automatically adjust their positions to maximize acoustic coverage and minimize redundancy.
    *   **Acoustic Mapping:**  The system generates a 3D map of the environment, not just geometric features, but also acoustic "hotspots" and the movement of sound sources over time.

*   **Operation:**
    1.  A swarm of devices is deployed into the target environment.
    2.  Devices begin autonomous movement, guided by the swarm algorithm.
    3.  Each device uses its microphone array to capture audio data and perform beamforming, as in the original patent.
    4.  Devices analyze the Doppler shift of detected sounds to estimate the velocity of sound sources.
    5.  Devices share acoustic data, position estimates, and velocity information with neighboring devices.
    6.  A central server (or distributed algorithm) fuses this data to create a high-resolution map of sound source locations and velocities.
    7.  The map is used for various applications (see below).

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   **Industrial Monitoring:** Locate and diagnose machinery failures based on abnormal acoustic signatures.
    *   **Security & Surveillance:** Detect and track intruders based on sound.
    *   **Environmental Monitoring:** Monitor wildlife populations based on vocalizations.
    *   **Search & Rescue:** Locate trapped individuals based on cries for help.
    *   **Robotics:** Enable robots to "see" with sound and navigate complex environments.

*   **Pseudocode (Swarm Coordination):**

```
for each device in swarm:
    // Calculate attraction to nearby devices
    attraction = 0
    for each nearby_device:
        attraction += (nearby_device.position - device.position).normalize()

    // Calculate repulsion from obstacles
    repulsion = 0
    for each obstacle in range:
        if distance(device.position, obstacle.position) < obstacle_avoidance_radius:
            repulsion += (device.position - obstacle.position).normalize()

    // Calculate movement direction
    movement_direction = attraction + repulsion

    // Apply movement
    device.move(movement_direction * speed)
