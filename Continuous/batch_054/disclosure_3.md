**Data Store Mirroring & Predictive Token Generation**

**Concept:** Expand the temporary token system to proactively mirror data stores and *predict* potential unavailability, issuing temporary tokens *before* failures occur, coupled with a tiered token validation system.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Store Mirroring:**
    *   Implement a real-time mirroring system for critical data stores.  Mirrors should be geographically distributed.
    *   Mirroring should be asynchronous and optimized for eventual consistency, minimizing latency impact on primary data store.
    *   A health monitoring system continuously assesses primary and mirror data store health (latency, errors, capacity).

2.  **Predictive Unavailability Algorithm:**
    *   Employ a machine learning model trained on historical data store health metrics (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network latency, error rates).
    *   The model predicts the probability of data store unavailability within a defined time window (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).
    *   A configurable threshold determines when to proactively issue temporary tokens.  Lower thresholds generate more preemptive tokens, increasing robustness at the cost of potential overhead.

3.  **Tiered Token Validation System:**
    *   **Tier 1: Temporary Token (Proactive/Reactive):**  Issued when: (a) the predictive algorithm indicates potential unavailability, or (b) a data store becomes unavailable.  Grants limited access, suitable for read-only operations or queuing requests.
    *   **Tier 2: Provisional Token:** Issued after a data store becomes unavailable, and a failover to a mirror is in progress. Validates against the mirror, allowing read/write access to mirrored data. Limited lifespan.
    *   **Tier 3: Valid Token:**  Issued once the primary data store is fully restored, or a mirror has been promoted to primary. Full access to all data.

4.  **Token Orchestration Service:**
    *   A dedicated service manages token issuance, validation, and propagation.
    *   Communicates with the predictive algorithm, data store health monitoring, and mirroring system.
    *   Maintains a token registry with associated metadata (expiration time, access level, associated data store).

5.  **API Extensions:**
    *   New API endpoints for:
        *   `PredictiveTokenRequest(serviceId, dataBlockId)`:  Requests a predictive token for a specific service and data block.
        *   `TokenStatusCheck(tokenId)`:  Checks the validity and status of a token.
        *   `TokenRefresh(tokenId)`: Attempts to refresh a token (e.g., upgrade from temporary to valid).

**Pseudocode (Token Orchestration Service - Simplified):**

```
function handleDataBlockTokenizationCall(serviceId, dataBlockId):
  storeStatus = getDataStoreStatus(dataBlockId)

  if storeStatus == "unavailable":
    predictiveRisk = getPredictiveRisk(dataBlockId)
    if predictiveRisk > threshold:
      tokenId = generateTemporaryToken(serviceId, dataBlockId)
      issueToken(serviceId, tokenId)
      log("Issued preemptive token for service " + serviceId)

  //...Existing token handling logic...

  if storeStatus == "unavailable":
    failoverComplete = initiateFailover(dataBlockId)
    if failoverComplete:
      tokenId = generateProvisionalToken(serviceId, dataBlockId)
      issueToken(serviceId, tokenId)
      log("Issued provisional token for service " + serviceId)

  //...Existing token handling logic...

```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency during data store outages.
*   Improved application resilience.
*   Proactive mitigation of data store failures.
*   Enhanced user experience.
