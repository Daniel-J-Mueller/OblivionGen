## Dynamic Advertisement ‘Mood Boards’

**Concept:** Extend the user feedback loop beyond simple disinterest reasons, and move toward a dynamically generated ‘mood board’ of options, presented *within* the ad space, allowing for nuanced preference expression.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Source:** Existing user data (browsing history, purchase history, return history). Additionally, contextual data (time of day, location - if permissible, trending items, social media ‘vibes’ - topic modeling on publicly available data, *without* PII).

*   **Mood Board Generation:**
    *   Initial Ad Presentation: Standard ad for Item A. Alongside, a small (initially collapsed) 'Vibe Check' panel.
    *   'Vibe Check' Panel: Contains a 3x3 grid of visual ‘vibes’ – images/short video clips representing styles, aesthetics, or use-cases related to Item A.  These are *not* alternative items. Examples: “Minimalist”, “Outdoor Adventure”, “Luxury”, “Budget Friendly”, “Cozy”, “Modern”, “Rustic”, “High-Tech”, “Handmade”.  The initial vibes are algorithmically selected based on Item A's attributes and the user's profile.
    *   User Interaction: User clicks on 1-3 vibe squares. This doesn’t immediately replace the ad. Instead, the system registers these preferences.
    *   Refinement & Display: After a short delay (2-5 seconds), or on user hover/click of a ‘Refine’ button, the ad dynamically adjusts *within* the existing ad space.
        *   **Visual Adjustment:**  The item image is subtly re-rendered to align with selected vibes (e.g., applying a color filter, changing the background, adding props).
        *   **Copy Adjustment:**  Ad copy is rewritten to emphasize aspects aligned with the chosen vibes.
        *   **Alternative Item Display (Tier 2):** *Below* the dynamically adjusted primary ad, display 2-3 alternative items that strongly match the selected vibes *and* are related to Item A's category. These are smaller previews with direct links.
    *   'Disinterest' Integration: If the user selects a ‘Disinterested’ button (still present), the mood board data is also recorded, offering a richer reason for the rejection.

*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **Ad Server Integration:** Ad server needs to support dynamic content rendering within a standard ad unit.
    *   **Vibe Database:** Large database of images/videos categorized by aesthetic/lifestyle tags.
    *   **Content Generation Module:** AI-powered module to rewrite ad copy and dynamically adjust images based on vibe selection.  Utilizes image style transfer and text generation models.
    *   **User Preference Tracking:** Store user vibe selections alongside browsing/purchase history.

*   **Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION generateMoodBoard(item, user):
  vibeOptions = getVibeOptions(item, user) // Algorithmically selects 9 vibe options
  RETURN vibeOptions

FUNCTION adjustAd(item, selectedVibes):
  newImage = applyStyleTransfer(item.image, selectedVibes)
  newCopy = generateAdCopy(item, selectedVibes)
  alternativeItems = findAlternativeItems(item, selectedVibes)
  RETURN newImage, newCopy, alternativeItems

ON User Clicks 'Disinterested':
  recordDisinterest(item, selectedVibes)
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Standard ad server infrastructure.  GPU acceleration recommended for style transfer and content generation.
