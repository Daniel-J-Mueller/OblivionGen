## Secure Attestation of Virtual Machine Configuration via Hardware Root of Trust

**System Overview:**

This design extends the concept of hardware-validated trust to virtual machine (VM) configurations, allowing a customer to verify not just the host system, but the *intended* state of VMs before they are launched. It leverages a dedicated co-processor (similar to that described in the provided patent) as a hardware root of trust to measure and attest to VM configuration parameters.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Trusted Co-Processor:**  A dedicated co-processor, physically connected via PCI-e. Possesses its own secure memory and cryptographic engine.
*   **Host System:** The main computing platform running the hypervisor.
*   **VM Configuration Store:** Secure storage within the host, accessible to both the hypervisor and the co-processor.
*   **PCI-e Communication Channel:**  A secure, direct communication channel between the co-processor and the host.

**Software Components:**

*   **Hypervisor Agent:** A software component within the hypervisor responsible for interacting with the co-processor.
*   **Attestation Service:** A remote service that validates attestations from the co-processor.
*   **Customer API:**  An interface allowing the customer to request attestations and verify VM configurations.

**Operation:**

1.  **Configuration Measurement:** Before VM launch, the hypervisor agent measures key VM configuration parameters. These parameters include:
    *   VM Memory Allocation
    *   CPU Core Assignment
    *   Network Configuration (MAC address, VLAN ID)
    *   Disk Image Hash
    *   Bootloader Hash
    *   Kernel Command Line Parameters
    *   Installed Packages (list of package names + hash of manifests)

    These measurements are accumulated into a Merkle Tree.

2.  **Attestation Request:** The hypervisor agent sends the root hash of the Merkle Tree to the trusted co-processor.

3.  **Hardware-Backed Measurement:** The co-processor receives the root hash, securely stores it in its non-volatile memory, and signs a message containing the hash using its private key.

4.  **Remote Attestation:** The signed message (attestation) is sent to the remote Attestation Service.

5.  **Attestation Validation:** The Attestation Service verifies the co-processor's signature and the integrity of the root hash. If valid, the Attestation Service returns a confirmation.

6.  **Customer Verification:** The Customer API allows the customer to request the attestation from the Attestation Service. The customer compares the received attestation with the expected configuration parameters to verify the VM's intended state.  A successful verification allows VM launch.

**Pseudocode (Hypervisor Agent):**

```
function GenerateVMConfigMerkleTree(vm_config):
    // Collect all VM configuration parameters (memory, CPU, network, disk, etc.)
    config_params = ExtractConfigParameters(vm_config)

    // Calculate hashes of each parameter
    hashed_params = CalculateHashes(config_params)

    // Build Merkle Tree from hashed parameters
    merkle_tree = BuildMerkleTree(hashed_params)

    return merkle_tree.root_hash

function RequestAttestation(root_hash):
    // Securely send root_hash to the Trusted Co-Processor
    attestation_response = SendToCoProcessor(root_hash)

    return attestation_response

function LaunchVM(vm_config):
    root_hash = GenerateVMConfigMerkleTree(vm_config)
    attestation = RequestAttestation(root_hash)

    // Check attestation validity (Remote Attestation Service)
    if VerifyAttestation(attestation):
        LaunchVirtualMachine(vm_config)
    else:
        LogFailure("Attestation Failed. VM Launch Aborted.")
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   The Trusted Co-Processor must be physically secure and tamper-resistant.
*   The communication channel between the hypervisor and co-processor must be protected against eavesdropping and modification.
*   The Remote Attestation Service must be highly available and trusted.
*   Robust key management is critical.
