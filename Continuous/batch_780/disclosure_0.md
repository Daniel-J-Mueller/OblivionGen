## Dynamic Content-Aware Grid Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the grid-based navigation by making the grid *dynamic* and responsive to the content being displayed. Instead of a static grid overlay, the grid cells should *morph* in size and shape based on the visual prominence and interactive elements of the webpage content.

**Specs:**

*   **Visual Prominence Analysis:** Integrate a computer vision module that analyzes webpage content in real-time. This module should identify key visual elements (headings, images, buttons, forms, etc.) and assign them a "prominence score" based on size, contrast, color, and position.
*   **Interactive Element Detection:** Detect interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) and assign them a higher prominence score.
*   **Voronoi Diagram Generation:** Use the prominence scores to generate a Voronoi diagram (a space partitioned into regions closest to each point in a set) across the webpage.  The 'seed' points for the diagram are the prominent content elements.
*   **Dynamic Grid Cell Creation:**  The regions of the Voronoi diagram *become* the grid cells. This results in a non-uniform grid where larger, more prominent elements have larger associated cells.
*   **Navigation Adjustment:**  The arrow key navigation should now move the selection indicator to the *center* of the nearest grid cell, regardless of its shape or size.
*   **Hotkey Behavior:** Hotkeys should trigger actions based on the element *within* the current grid cell.
*   **Smoothing Algorithm:** Implement a smoothing algorithm to prevent rapid, jarring grid changes when content dynamically updates. This could involve a weighted average of the current and previous grid configurations.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to adjust the sensitivity of the prominence analysis and the degree of grid smoothing.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (webpage_updated) {
    // 1. Analyze Webpage Content
    prominence_scores = analyze_webpage_content() // Returns dict: {element: score}
    interactive_elements = detect_interactive_elements()

    // 2. Generate Voronoi Diagram
    voronoi_diagram = generate_voronoi_diagram(prominence_scores) // Creates grid cells

    // 3. Apply Smoothing
    smoothed_diagram = apply_smoothing(voronoi_diagram, previous_diagram, smoothing_factor)

    // 4. Handle User Input
    if (arrow_key_pressed) {
        target_cell = find_nearest_cell(selection_indicator, smoothed_diagram)
        move_selection_indicator(target_cell)
    } else if (hotkey_pressed) {
        element = get_element_in_cell(selection_indicator, smoothed_diagram)
        trigger_action(element, hotkey)
    }

    previous_diagram = smoothed_diagram
}
```

**Potential downstream AI Application:** Automated webpage usability assessment by analyzing the resulting grid structure.  A more "organic" grid suggests a more logically structured and user-friendly webpage.
