## Adaptive Power Harvesting Doorbell with Kinetic Energy Supplement

**System Overview:** A doorbell system supplementing standard AC/DC power input with harvested kinetic energy from button presses and/or vibrations, stored in a supercapacitor network, to provide extended functionality during power outages or reduce overall grid dependence.

**Core Components:**

*   **Kinetic Energy Harvester:** Piezoelectric transducers integrated *within* the doorbell button and potentially mounted to the doorframe. These capture mechanical energy from button presses and environmental vibrations. Multiple transducers arranged in a matrix for increased energy capture.
*   **Energy Management Circuit:**
    *   **Rectifier/Voltage Multiplier:** Converts the AC voltage generated by the piezoelectric transducers to DC.
    *   **DC-DC Boost Converter:** Increases the relatively low DC voltage to a level suitable for charging the supercapacitor network.
    *   **Supercapacitor Network:**  High-density supercapacitors (arranged in series/parallel configuration for voltage/capacitance optimization). Acts as an energy buffer, storing harvested energy and providing power during outages.
    *   **Load Switching Matrix:**  Intelligent switching circuit distributing power from either the AC/DC input or the supercapacitor network to doorbell components (camera, microphone, speaker, Wi-Fi module).
*   **Doorbell Unit:** Standard doorbell components (camera, microphone, speaker, Wi-Fi, processing unit).
*   **Smart Control Logic:** Embedded microcontroller managing energy harvesting, storage, and distribution.

**Functional Specifications:**

*   **Energy Harvesting:**  Piezoelectric transducers generate a minimum of 0.5V peak-to-peak per button press/vibration event.  Energy harvesting circuit converts this to DC voltage and charges the supercapacitor network.
*   **Supercapacitor Capacity:** Total supercapacitor capacity of at least 10 Farads. This allows the doorbell to operate for at least 30 minutes on harvested energy alone.
*   **Charging/Discharging Control:** The microcontroller dynamically switches between AC/DC input and supercapacitor power. Priority given to AC/DC when available. Supercapacitor used for seamless transition during outages.
*   **Low-Power Modes:** When idle, the doorbell operates in a low-power mode, utilizing the supercapacitor for minimal power consumption.
*   **Remote Monitoring:** Integrate with a cloud platform to monitor supercapacitor charge level, energy harvesting rates, and doorbell status.
*   **Button Press Energy:** Each button press generates at least 100mJ of energy, captured by the piezoelectric transducers.
*   **Vibration Harvesting:**  Continuous vibration harvesting (from door movement/traffic) contributes at least 50mW of average power.

**Pseudocode for Control Logic:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Check AC/DC input power status
  if (AC_DC_Power_Available()) {
    // Charge Supercapacitor
    Charge_Supercapacitor(AC_DC_Input_Voltage);
    // Power Doorbell from AC/DC
    Power_Doorbell(AC_DC_Input_Voltage);
  } else {
    // Check Supercapacitor Charge Level
    if (Supercapacitor_Charge_Level() > CRITICAL_THRESHOLD) {
      // Power Doorbell from Supercapacitor
      Power_Doorbell(Supercapacitor_Voltage);
    } else {
      // Doorbell in Sleep Mode (Minimal Power)
      Enter_Sleep_Mode();
    }
  }

  // Energy Harvesting Loop (Runs Continuously)
  Piezoelectric_Voltage = Read_Piezoelectric_Voltage();
  if (Piezoelectric_Voltage > THRESHOLD) {
    Rectify_and_Boost(Piezoelectric_Voltage);
    Charge_Supercapacitor(Boosted_Voltage);
  }

  // Monitor and report energy status to cloud platform
  Report_Energy_Status();
}
```

**Material Specifications:**

*   Piezoelectric Material: PZT (Lead Zirconate Titanate) or similar high-performance material.
*   Supercapacitors: Graphene-based supercapacitors for high energy density and long cycle life.
*   Enclosure: Weatherproof and durable plastic or metal housing.
