**Dynamic Component Assembly via Predictive User Interaction**

**Specification:**

**I. Overview**

This system extends the speculative generation of network page components by incorporating *real-time* prediction of user interaction to dynamically assemble page elements *before* full component generation. It anticipates user behavior (clicks, scrolls, form inputs) and prioritizes the generation of components most likely to be needed *immediately*. This contrasts with the patent's static probability calculations, shifting to an active, learning system.

**II. Components**

*   **Interaction Prediction Engine (IPE):** A machine learning model trained on user interaction data (clicks, scrolls, dwell time, form submissions, etc.).  This model outputs a probability distribution over potential user actions *given* the current page state.  Key: This is not just *what* they might click, but *when* (timing prediction).
*   **Component Dependency Graph (CDG):**  A directed graph representing the dependencies between network page components.  Nodes represent components; edges represent dependencies (e.g., Component A requires data from Component B).
*   **Speculative Generation Prioritizer (SGP):**  This module combines the IPE's interaction probabilities with the CDG to prioritize component generation.  Components that are likely to be needed soon *and* have long generation times are prioritized.
*   **Adaptive Component Cache (ACC):** A caching layer that intelligently evicts components based on predicted *future* usage.  Components predicted to be needed soon are retained; infrequently used or rarely predicted components are evicted.
*   **Partial Rendering Engine (PRE):**  Allows rendering of page fragments as components become available, providing a progressive user experience.

**III. Operational Flow**

1.  **Request Received:** User requests a network page.
2.  **Initial Page Load:**  A minimal "shell" of the page is loaded, including essential scripts and the PRE.
3.  **Interaction Monitoring:**  The PRE captures user interactions (mouse movements, clicks, scrolls) in real-time.
4.  **Interaction Prediction:** The IPE processes interaction data to predict likely next actions and assigns probabilities.
5.  **Dependency Graph Traversal:** The SGP, guided by the IPE's predictions, traverses the CDG to identify components needed for predicted interactions.
6.  **Speculative Generation:** The SGP initiates speculative generation of prioritized components.
7.  **Adaptive Caching:** The ACC manages the component cache, prioritizing components based on predictions.
8.  **Partial Rendering:**  As components become available, the PRE renders them incrementally, providing a progressively complete page.
9.  **Continuous Learning:** The IPE is continuously retrained with new interaction data, improving prediction accuracy over time.

**IV. Pseudocode (SGP - Speculative Generation Prioritizer)**

```pseudocode
function prioritize_generation(user_interaction_probabilities, component_dependency_graph):
  priority_queue = []

  for component in component_dependency_graph.nodes:
    probability_of_use = user_interaction_probabilities.get(component, 0.0)
    generation_time = estimate_generation_time(component)
    priority = probability_of_use * generation_time

    priority_queue.append((priority, component))

  priority_queue.sort(reverse=True) #Sorts descending (highest priority first)

  return priority_queue #Returns a list of (priority, component) tuples
```

**V. Novelty**

This system distinguishes itself from the source patent by:

*   **Dynamic Prioritization:** Shifting from static probability calculations to real-time prediction of user interaction.
*   **Proactive Generation:**  Generating components *before* user input, rather than reacting to it.
*   **Adaptive Caching:** Utilizing predicted usage to manage the component cache intelligently.
*   **Partial Rendering:** Delivering a progressive user experience by rendering components as they become available.
