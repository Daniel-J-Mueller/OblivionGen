## Dynamic Memory Granularity Shifting

**Concept:** The patent focuses on page-level activity tracking for memory tiering. This inspires a system that doesn't *just* move pages, but dynamically adjusts the granularity of memory blocks based on access patterns *within* a page. Instead of a fixed page size, the system will create variable-sized "memory fragments" within pages, moving these fragments between tiers.

**Specifications:**

**1. Fragment Table:**
   *   Data Structure: A hash table mapping virtual addresses to fragment metadata.
   *   Metadata:
        *   `start_address`: Physical address of the fragment’s beginning.
        *   `size`: Size of the fragment in bytes.
        *   `tier`:  Integer representing the memory tier (0 = fastest, higher numbers = slower).
        *   `access_count`: Integer counter for tracking fragment access.
        *   `dirty_bit`: Boolean flag indicating if the fragment has been modified.

**2. Intercept Logic Enhancement:**
   *   Modify the existing memory access request intercept to operate at a finer granularity than a full page.
   *   On each memory access:
        *   Calculate the fragment ID based on the virtual address.
        *   Increment the `access_count` for that fragment.
        *   Set the `dirty_bit` if a write operation occurs.

**3. Fragment Management Engine:**
   *   A background process that periodically scans the Fragment Table.
   *   Logic:
        *   Identify "hot" fragments: Fragments with high `access_count`.
        *   Identify "cold" fragments: Fragments with low `access_count`.
        *   Implement a migration policy:
            *   Move hot fragments to faster tiers.
            *   Move cold fragments to slower tiers.
            *   Consider fragment size when moving – larger fragments may incur higher migration costs.
        *   Implement a fragmentation/coalescing policy:
            *   If many small fragments exist in a tier, attempt to coalesce them into larger, more efficient blocks.
            *   If a large fragment is rarely accessed, split it into smaller fragments.

**4. Hardware Assistance:**
   *   **TLB Extension:** Augment the TLB with fragment size information. This allows the MMU to quickly translate virtual addresses to physical addresses, considering the variable fragment sizes.
   *   **Page Table Entry Modification:**  Introduce a “fragment size” field within the page table entry to store the size of the fragment.

**5. Pseudocode (Fragment Management Engine):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION manageFragments(fragmentTable, migrationThreshold, coalescingThreshold):
  FOR EACH fragment IN fragmentTable:
    IF fragment.access_count > migrationThreshold AND fragment.tier > 0:
      migrateFragment(fragment, 0) // Move to fastest tier
    ELSE IF fragment.access_count < migrationThreshold AND fragment.tier < maxTier:
      migrateFragment(fragment, fragment.tier + 1) // Move to slower tier

  // Coalescing
  FOR EACH tier IN allTiers:
    fragmentsInTier = getFragmentsInTier(tier)
    IF fragmentsInTier.size() > coalescingThreshold:
      coalesceFragments(fragmentsInTier)

  resetAccessCounts(fragmentTable) // Reset access counts for next cycle
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION migrateFragment(fragment, newTier):
  // Allocate space in newTier
  newPhysicalAddress = allocateMemory(newTier, fragment.size)

  // Copy data from old location to new location
  copyMemory(fragment.start_address, newPhysicalAddress, fragment.size)

  // Update Fragment Table with new information
  fragment.start_address = newPhysicalAddress
  fragment.tier = newTier

  // Release old memory
  releaseMemory(fragment.start_address, fragment.size)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION coalesceFragments(fragments):
    // Sort fragments by physical address
    sort(fragments, by physical address)

    // Iterate through fragments, merging adjacent ones if possible
    FOR i FROM 0 TO fragments.size() - 1:
        IF i + 1 < fragments.size() AND fragments[i].end_address == fragments[i+1].start_address:
            // Merge fragments[i] and fragments[i+1]
            fragments[i].size += fragments[i+1].size
            remove(fragments[i+1])
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Fine-Grained Tiering:** More efficient use of memory resources by adapting to specific application access patterns.
*   **Reduced Migration Overhead:**  By moving smaller fragments, the cost of migration may be reduced compared to moving entire pages.
*   **Improved Performance:**  Optimized memory layout can improve cache hit rates and reduce latency.
