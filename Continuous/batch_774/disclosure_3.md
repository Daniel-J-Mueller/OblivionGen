## Dynamic Media Asset "Mood Boards" via Generative AI

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple similarity-based recommendations to construct dynamic "mood boards" of media assets. These mood boards aren't just lists, but evolving compositions shaped by user interaction and generative AI.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Data Structure: "Mood Board Blueprint"**

*   **Blueprint ID:** Unique identifier.
*   **Seed Assets:** Initial set of media assets (images, video clips, audio tracks) – potentially derived from the existing patent’s similarity matching.
*   **Style Vectors:** Numerical representations of aesthetic qualities (e.g., "warm," "energetic," "minimalist"). These are derived from analyzing the Seed Assets, and can be weighted.
*   **Evolution Rules:** A set of rules that govern how the Mood Board changes over time. These include:
    *   **Expansion Rate:** How quickly new assets are added.
    *   **Diversity Threshold:**  A measure of how different new assets must be from existing ones.
    *   **User Feedback Weight:** How strongly user reactions (likes, dislikes, skips) influence the selection of new assets.
    *   **Generative AI Prompt Template:**  A text prompt used to guide a generative AI model (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL-E) in creating new assets *specifically* tailored to the current Mood Board's aesthetic. This template is populated with keywords derived from the Style Vectors and existing asset metadata.

**II.  Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:** The system begins with a Mood Board Blueprint.  Seed Assets are loaded, and Style Vectors are calculated.
2.  **Asset Generation/Selection:**
    *   **AI Generation:**  The Generative AI Prompt Template is populated with relevant keywords.  The AI model generates a set of candidate assets.
    *   **Similarity Search:** The existing patent’s similarity matching algorithm is used to identify assets similar to those already in the Mood Board.
    *   **Combined Pool:**  The AI-generated assets and the similarity-matched assets are combined into a pool of candidates.
3.  **Filtering & Ranking:**
    *   **Diversity Filter:**  Candidates are filtered based on the Diversity Threshold.  Assets too similar to existing ones are discarded.
    *   **Aesthetic Scoring:**  Each candidate is scored based on its alignment with the Style Vectors. This can be done using image/audio analysis techniques.
    *   **User Feedback Incorporation:**  If user feedback is available, it’s used to adjust the scoring.
4.  **Asset Addition:** The highest-scoring candidate is added to the Mood Board.
5.  **Iteration:** Steps 2-4 are repeated, continuously evolving the Mood Board.

**III.  Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
function evolveMoodBoard(blueprint, userFeedback) {
  generateAICandidates(blueprint.styleVectors) -> aiCandidates
  findSimilarAssets(blueprint.seedAssets) -> similarAssets
  combinedCandidates = aiCandidates + similarAssets

  filteredCandidates = filterByDiversity(combinedCandidates, blueprint.diversityThreshold)

  scoredCandidates = scoreByAesthetic(filteredCandidates, blueprint.styleVectors)
  scoredCandidates = incorporateUserFeedback(scoredCandidates, userFeedback)

  bestCandidate = getHighestScoredCandidate(scoredCandidates)

  addAssetToMoodBoard(bestCandidate)
  updateBlueprintStyleVectors(bestCandidate) //Refine Style Vectors based on newly added Asset
  return moodBoard
}
```

**IV.  Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure for running generative AI models.
*   Large-scale storage for media assets and metadata.
*   Real-time data streaming capabilities for user feedback.
*   Machine learning frameworks for aesthetic scoring and style vector refinement.
*   APIs for integration with generative AI services (e.g., OpenAI, Stability AI).
