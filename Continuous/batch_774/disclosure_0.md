## Dynamic Schema Visualization & Interactive Repair

**Concept:** Extend the schema modification tooling to include a real-time, interactive visual representation of the schema *and* automated repair suggestions based on dependency analysis.

**Specification:**

**I. Visual Schema Graph:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A directed graph where nodes represent schema objects (tables, columns, indexes, views, stored procedures, etc.). Edges represent dependencies (e.g., foreign key constraints, view definitions referencing tables, stored procedure calls).
*   **Rendering:**  The graph should be rendered in a user-friendly interface (web-based preferred).  Nodes should be color-coded to indicate object type and status (e.g., green = healthy, yellow = potential issue, red = broken).
*   **Interactive Exploration:**  Users can zoom, pan, and select nodes to view detailed information about the object.  Selecting an edge highlights the dependency relationship.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The graph automatically updates as schema modifications are proposed or applied.  Dependency changes are visually indicated.

**II. Automated Dependency Analysis & Repair Suggestions:**

*   **Dependency Engine:** A backend service that analyzes the schema metadata to build and maintain the dependency graph. This engine should be capable of inferring dependencies beyond explicit constraints (e.g., analyzing SQL code to identify implicit table references).
*   **Impact Analysis:**  When a user proposes a schema modification (e.g., dropping a column), the system performs an impact analysis to identify all dependent objects.  These objects are highlighted in the visual graph.
*   **Repair Suggestion Engine:** Based on the impact analysis, the system generates repair suggestions.  Examples:
    *   **Column Drop:** "Dropping column 'X' will break view 'Y'.  Consider adding a default value or modifying the view definition."
    *   **Table Drop:** "Dropping table 'Z' will impact stored procedure 'W'. Consider renaming the stored procedure or creating a new view."
    *   **Data Type Change:** "Changing data type of column 'A' in table 'B' may cause errors in application 'C'.  Review code for compatibility."
*   **Automated Repair Scripts:**  Where possible, the system should generate automated scripts to implement the repair suggestions (e.g., ALTER VIEW, ALTER PROCEDURE).  These scripts should be presented to the user for review and approval.

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **UI Module:**  Provides the user interface for interacting with the visual schema graph and repair suggestions. Communicates with the API Gateway.
2.  **API Gateway:**  Handles requests from the UI Module and routes them to the appropriate backend services.
3.  **Metadata Service:**  Provides access to schema metadata (table definitions, constraints, stored procedure code, etc.).  Responsible for caching and updating the metadata.
4.  **Dependency Engine:**  Analyzes the schema metadata to build and maintain the dependency graph.
5.  **Repair Suggestion Engine:**  Generates repair suggestions based on the impact analysis.
6.  **Script Generation Service:**  Generates automated scripts to implement the repair suggestions.
7.  **Database Connectivity Layer:** Provides secure connections to the target databases.

**IV. Pseudocode (Impact Analysis):**

```
function analyzeImpact(schemaModification, schemaMetadata):
  dependentObjects = []
  if schemaModification.type == "drop_column":
    tables = schemaMetadata.getTablesReferencingColumn(schemaModification.column)
    dependentObjects.extend(tables)
    views = schemaMetadata.getViewsReferencingColumn(schemaModification.column)
    dependentObjects.extend(views)
    procedures = schemaMetadata.getProceduresReferencingColumn(schemaModification.column)
    dependentObjects.extend(procedures)
  else if schemaModification.type == "drop_table":
    views = schemaMetadata.getViewsReferencingTable(schemaModification.table)
    dependentObjects.extend(views)
    procedures = schemaMetadata.getProceduresReferencingTable(schemaModification.table)
    dependentObjects.extend(procedures)
  return dependentObjects
```

**V. Future Enhancements:**

*   **AI-powered repair suggestions:** Use machine learning to predict potential issues and suggest more sophisticated repair strategies.
*   **Integration with CI/CD pipelines:** Automate schema changes and validation as part of the development process.
*   **Collaboration features:** Allow multiple users to collaborate on schema changes and review repair suggestions.
