## Adaptive ID Obfuscation with Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the ID generation service to proactively obfuscate IDs based on observed usage patterns, creating 'chameleon IDs' that change over time to hinder tracking while maintaining internal consistency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection:**

*   **Data Points:** Track request origin (IP, User Agent), ID request frequency, associated data fields (if any) sent *with* the ID request, and time-of-day patterns.  Do *not* store personally identifiable information (PII). Focus solely on behavioral metadata.
*   **Aggregation:** Aggregate data at the component level (e.g., website X, app Y) to build behavioral profiles. Use rolling windows (e.g., 7-day, 30-day averages) to detect anomalies and shifts in usage.
*   **Profile Storage:** Store behavioral profiles in a dedicated datastore optimized for time-series data (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus).

**2. Obfuscation Engine:**

*   **Obfuscation Algorithms:** Implement a library of obfuscation algorithms, including:
    *   **Rotating Hashes:** Periodically re-hash the ID using a different seed value (based on time or a pseudo-random number generator).
    *   **Bit Shifting/XORing:**  Apply bitwise operations to the ID to alter its value.
    *   **Canonicalization/Normalization:** Modify the ID's format (e.g., case sensitivity, whitespace) without changing its core meaning.
    *   **Substitution Ciphers:** Utilize a rotating key to substitute portions of the ID with other characters.
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose an obfuscation algorithm *dynamically* based on the component’s behavioral profile and a pre-defined 'risk score'.  Components exhibiting high-frequency, predictable ID requests receive stronger obfuscation.
*   **Obfuscation Metadata:** Store metadata about the applied obfuscation (algorithm, seed value, timestamp) alongside the original ID in the data storage.

**3. ID Resolution Service:**

*   **Reverse Obfuscation:** When a component requests data associated with an ID, the resolution service first checks if the ID is obfuscated.
*   **Metadata Lookup:** If obfuscated, the service retrieves the obfuscation metadata.
*   **De-obfuscation:** The service applies the reverse obfuscation process to map the obfuscated ID back to its original value.
*   **Cache Layer:** Implement a cache layer to store resolved IDs and reduce latency.

**4. API Extensions:**

*   **Obfuscation Level:**  Expose an API parameter allowing components to request a specific level of obfuscation (e.g., 'low', 'medium', 'high').
*   **Behavioral Profile Access:**  Provide an API endpoint for components to query their own behavioral profile (for debugging and monitoring purposes – limited data access only).
*   **Anomaly Detection Alerts:** Trigger alerts when a component’s behavioral profile deviates significantly from its historical pattern.

**Pseudocode (ID Resolution Service):**

```
function resolveID(obfuscatedID):
  metadata = lookupMetadata(obfuscatedID)

  if metadata is null:
    // ID is not obfuscated, return it directly
    return obfuscatedID

  algorithm = metadata.algorithm
  seed = metadata.seed
  timestamp = metadata.timestamp

  originalID = reverseObfuscate(obfuscatedID, algorithm, seed, timestamp)

  // Cache the resolved ID
  cache.put(obfuscatedID, originalID)

  return originalID

function reverseObfuscate(obfuscatedID, algorithm, seed, timestamp):
  // Apply the reverse transformation based on the algorithm
  // (implementation details depend on the chosen algorithm)
  if algorithm == "RotatingHash":
    // ...
  elif algorithm == "BitShifting":
    // ...
  // ...
  return originalID
```

**Data Storage Schema (ID Metadata):**
