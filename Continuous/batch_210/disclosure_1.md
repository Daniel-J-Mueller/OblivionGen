## Dynamic Policy Orchestration via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)

**Concept:** Extend the existing access control mechanism by incorporating Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to enable a more granular, dynamic, and trustless policy enforcement system. This moves beyond static IP-based access and allows for policies tied to the *entity* requesting access, not just its network location.

**Specification:**

**1. DID/VC Integration:**

*   Each client (computing device associated with a customer) is assigned a unique DID.
*   The service (hosted in the private network) issues VCs representing authorized access levels or specific permissions. These VCs are digitally signed by the service provider.
*   The external endpoint acts as a VC verifier. Before forwarding a request, it demands a valid, signed VC from the client.

**2. Policy Definition & Storage:**

*   Policies are defined using a standardized schema (e.g., JSON-LD) and stored in a decentralized, tamper-proof manner (e.g., a blockchain or distributed ledger). 
*   Policy rules specify which VCs are required for specific actions/resources.
*   Instead of relying solely on IP address whitelisting, access is granted based on *presentation* of a valid VC.

**3. External Endpoint Logic:**

*   Upon receiving a request:
    *   The external endpoint requests a signed VC from the client.
    *   The endpoint verifies the VCâ€™s signature and validity (expiry, revocation status).
    *   The endpoint checks if the presented VC satisfies the policy requirements for the requested action.
    *   If authorized, the endpoint adds supplemental information (DID, VC details) to the request before forwarding it to the internal endpoint.
*   The endpoint maintains a lightweight cache of verified VCs to reduce verification overhead.

**4. Internal Endpoint Logic:**

*   The internal endpoint receives the supplemented request.
*   It uses the DID and VC information to further validate the request. (An extra layer of verification).
*   Access is granted or denied based on the combined policy evaluation.

**5. Dynamic Policy Updates:**

*   Policy changes are propagated through the decentralized storage system.
*   The external endpoint periodically synchronizes with the decentralized storage to ensure it has the latest policy definitions.
*   The internal endpoint can also subscribe to policy updates.

**Pseudocode (External Endpoint):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  clientDID = request.clientDID
  requestVC = request.requestVC

  if not requestVC:
    return Error("VC required")

  verificationResult = verifyVC(requestVC)

  if verificationResult != Success:
    return Error("VC verification failed")

  policy = getPolicy(request.resource)

  if not policy.isAuthorized(verificationResult):
    return Error("Access denied")

  supplementedRequest = request + { "clientDID": clientDID, "VC": verificationResult }

  forwardRequest(supplementedRequest)

  return Success
```

**Technology Stack:**

*   **DID Method:**  Choose a suitable DID method (e.g., DID:Web, DID:Key)
*   **VC Standard:** W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.0
*   **Decentralized Storage:** Blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric) or Distributed Ledger (e.g., IPFS)
*   **Cryptography:**  EdDSA, ECDSA for digital signatures
*   **API/Protocol:** RESTful APIs, gRPC for communication

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple IP-based access control to a more robust, dynamic, and trustless system based on verifiable credentials. It allows for fine-grained access control tied to the *entity* requesting access, not just its network location.  It's especially useful for scenarios where network addresses are dynamic or untrusted.
