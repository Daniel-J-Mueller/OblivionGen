## Adaptive Propeller Surface - Bio-Mimicry

**Concept:** Implement a dynamically morphing propeller surface inspired by shark skin (dermal denticles) and bird feathers to optimize airflow and reduce drag, with integrated gas micro-discharge for localized flow control.

**Specs:**

*   **Propeller Material:** Multi-layer composite – base layer of lightweight carbon fiber, embedded with shape memory alloy (SMA) actuators and a micro-channel network for gas distribution. Outer surface layer: flexible, durable polymer with embedded micro-scale “denticles” – small, overlapping, independently controllable flaps.
*   **Denticle Actuation:** Each denticle is linked to a SMA actuator. Individual denticle position is controlled by electrical current.
*   **Micro-Channel Network:** A network of micro-channels embedded within the propeller blades delivers a precisely controlled gas (air, nitrogen) to specific regions around the denticles. Channels are connected to a central gas reservoir within the aerial vehicle.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Pressure Sensors:** Distributed across the propeller surface to detect localized pressure gradients and stall conditions.
    *   **Flow Sensors:** Miniaturized hot-wire anemometers embedded near leading/trailing edges to measure airflow velocity and turbulence.
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** To track propeller orientation and rotational speed.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated microcontroller programmed with a predictive airflow model. Input: sensor data (pressure, flow, IMU), flight parameters (speed, altitude, attitude). Output: Control signals for SMA actuators and gas micro-discharge valves.
*   **Gas System:** Compact gas reservoir, miniature high-precision valves, and a micro-pump. Gas is discharged through micro-pores adjacent to denticles.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    READ SensorData (Pressure, Flow, IMU)
    READ FlightParameters (Speed, Altitude, Attitude)

    PREDICT AirflowPattern (using SensorData, FlightParameters, and AirflowModel)

    FOR EACH Denticle:
        CALCULATE OptimalDenticlePosition (based on PredictedAirflowPattern)
        SEND SignalToSMAActuator (to move Denticle to OptimalDenticlePosition)

        IF StallDetected OR TurbulenceHigh:
            ActivateMicroGasDischarge (at Denticle location) // disrupt airflow, re-energize boundary layer

    END FOR

    UPDATE AirflowModel (using current SensorData) // Adaptive Learning

    DELAY (Control Loop Frequency - e.g., 100Hz)
END LOOP
```

**Operation:**

The system dynamically adjusts the shape and texture of the propeller surface based on real-time flight conditions. By manipulating the denticles, the propeller can:

*   Reduce drag by streamlining airflow.
*   Delay stall by re-energizing the boundary layer.
*   Reduce noise by minimizing turbulence.
*   Fine-tune lift and thrust characteristics.

The gas micro-discharge system provides localized flow control, allowing the propeller to actively counteract adverse airflow conditions and optimize performance. Gas discharge will be focused on regions where boundary layer separation is detected by pressure sensors, delaying stall.
