## Adaptive Acoustic Event Prioritization & Pre-Encryption Buffering

**Concept:** Expand on the delayed encryption approach by dynamically prioritizing acoustic events for pre-encryption buffering *before* full ASR/NLU processing, based on estimated computational cost and potential sensitivity. This allows for immediate protection of high-value/cost data while optimizing resource allocation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing speech interface device with one or more processors, volatile memory, non-volatile memory. Addition of a small, dedicated hardware acceleration unit for basic signal analysis (energy, fundamental frequency estimation) is suggested.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Acoustic Event Analyzer (AEA):**  A real-time signal processing module. Operates *before* ASR/NLU.
        *   Input: Raw audio stream.
        *   Output:  Event metadata (estimated duration, energy profile, spectral characteristics, potential event type â€“ e.g., speech, alarm, glass break).  A 'Sensitivity Score' (1-10, 10 = highest) based on event type and energy levels.
    *   **Dynamic Buffer Manager (DBM):** Controls volatile memory allocation.
        *   Input: Event metadata from AEA, current system load, available volatile memory.
        *   Output: Buffer allocation requests, encryption priority flags.
    *   **Prioritized Encryption Engine (PEE):**  Manages encryption/decryption.
        *   Input: Audio data, encryption priority flags.
        *   Output: Encrypted audio data.
*   **Pseudocode (DBM):**

```
FUNCTION AllocateBuffer(eventMetadata)
  sensitivityScore = eventMetadata.sensitivityScore
  estimatedDuration = eventMetadata.estimatedDuration
  requiredBufferSpace = estimatedDuration * audioBitrate

  IF systemLoad > thresholdHigh OR availableMemory < requiredBufferSpace THEN
    IF sensitivityScore < thresholdLow THEN
      RETURN BufferAllocationFailure // Drop or significantly compress
    ELSE
      //Attempt to offload less critical tasks to free memory
      OffloadNonCriticalTasks()
      IF availableMemory < requiredBufferSpace THEN
        RETURN BufferAllocationFailure
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

  buffer = AllocateVolatileMemory(requiredBufferSpace)
  SetEncryptionPriority(buffer, sensitivityScore)
  RETURN buffer
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Sensitivity Scoring Examples:**
    *   Detected "glass break" sound: Sensitivity 9-10.
    *   Detected alarm/siren: Sensitivity 8-9.
    *   Detected human speech with high energy: Sensitivity 6-8.
    *   Background noise/low energy speech: Sensitivity 1-3.
*   **Encryption Prioritization:**
    *   Higher sensitivity scores trigger immediate encryption requests.
    *   Encryption engine prioritizes higher-priority buffers.
    *   Lower-priority buffers are encrypted during periods of low system load or after higher-priority data is secured.
*   **Non-Volatile Memory Storage:**
    *   Encrypted data is stored in non-volatile memory.
    *   Storage format includes metadata (timestamp, sensitivity score, event type).

**Innovation:**  Moves beyond simply delaying encryption.  It proactively identifies and protects potentially sensitive or computationally expensive audio events *before* full processing, enabling a tiered security and resource management approach. This is particularly valuable in edge devices with limited resources and potentially hostile environments. It introduces the concept of 'acoustic event intelligence' as a pre-processing step to enhance security and efficiency.
