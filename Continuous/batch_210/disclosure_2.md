## Resource Action Rule-Driven Predictive Maintenance & Automated Remediation

**Specification:** A system extending resource action rules to proactively predict resource failures and automatically initiate remediation workflows.

**Core Concept:**  Rather than simply reacting to resource state *after* an issue arises (as implied in the provided patent), this system uses historical data combined with real-time state to *predict* impending failures and preemptively address them.

**Components:**

1.  **Historical Data Repository:** Stores time-series data for all monitored resources.  Includes performance metrics (CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O), error logs, and historical remediation actions.  Data is indexed for rapid retrieval.
2.  **Predictive Analytics Engine:** Leverages machine learning models (time-series forecasting, anomaly detection) trained on the historical data.  This engine continuously analyzes real-time resource state data and generates a 'failure probability score' for each resource.  Different models can be used for different resource types.
3.  **Enhanced Resource Action Rules:** Rules now include 'prediction thresholds'. A rule might read: “IF CPU usage exceeds 90% *AND* failure probability score for the server exceeds 0.7, THEN initiate ‘Scale-Up’ workflow.”  Rules can also incorporate seasonal or cyclical patterns.
4.  **Automated Remediation Workflow Engine:** Orchestrates various remediation actions, including:
    *   Scaling resources (up/down)
    *   Restarting services
    *   Failing over to redundant resources
    *   Running diagnostic scripts
    *   Alerting administrators (with detailed diagnostics)
5.  **Feedback Loop:**  Remediation actions are logged, and their effectiveness is monitored.  This data is fed back into the historical data repository to improve the accuracy of the predictive analytics engine.

**Pseudocode (Rule Evaluation & Action):**

```
FUNCTION EvaluateResource(resourceID, resourceStateData, resourceActionRules)

  // Fetch applicable rules for the resource
  rules = SELECT * FROM resourceActionRules WHERE resourceType = resourceStateData.type

  FOR EACH rule IN rules

    // Evaluate prediction conditions
    predictionMet = FALSE
    IF rule.predictionType == "threshold"
      IF resourceStateData.metric > rule.predictionThreshold
        predictionMet = TRUE
    ELSE IF rule.predictionType == "probability"
      IF GetFailureProbability(resourceID) > rule.predictionThreshold
        predictionMet = TRUE

    // Evaluate standard conditions (as in original patent)
    conditionsMet = EvaluateConditions(rule.conditions, resourceStateData)

    IF conditionsMet AND predictionMet THEN
      // Initiate action
      ExecuteAction(rule.action, resourceID)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

ENDFUNCTION
```

**Specification Details:**

*   **Data Format:** Time-series data stored in a columnar database (e.g., ClickHouse) for fast aggregation and analysis.
*   **Machine Learning Models:**  Utilize a combination of models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forests) selected based on resource type and data characteristics.
*   **Workflow Engine:** Implement using a state machine or workflow orchestration tool (e.g., Apache Airflow).
*   **UI Integration:**  Enhanced UI displaying failure probability scores alongside resource state, allowing administrators to visualize predictive alerts and monitor remediation actions.  UI controls to modify prediction thresholds and workflow configurations.

**Novelty:** The core distinction is the proactive element of *predicting* failures based on historical data and failure probability scores, rather than merely reacting to current resource states. This shifts the paradigm from reactive maintenance to predictive maintenance, potentially reducing downtime and improving overall system reliability.  The integration of machine learning for failure prediction and the automated remediation workflows significantly enhance the functionality beyond the scope of the provided patent.
