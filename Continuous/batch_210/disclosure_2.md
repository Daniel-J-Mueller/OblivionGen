## Adaptive Contextual Overlay - "Echo"

**Concept:** Extend the visual overlay capability to project *potential* information based on predictive modeling of user intent and environmental factors. Instead of solely reacting to identified objects/users, the system proactively displays subtle “echoes” of information *before* the user consciously focuses on something. These echoes fade or sharpen based on gaze direction and proximity, creating a more intuitive and less intrusive AR experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing base apparatus (transceiver, processor, memory, transparent/semi-transparent interface, camera).
    *   Dedicated “Intent Engine” co-processor – optimized for rapid probabilistic modeling.
    *   High-resolution, low-latency eye-tracking integrated into the interface.
    *   Ambient sound sensor array for contextual awareness.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
        *   Input: Real-time camera feed, eye-tracking data, audio input, user profile (preferences, history), location data, time of day, calendar events.
        *   Process: Utilizes machine learning (LSTM, GRU networks) to predict user interest/intent based on gaze direction, environment, and past behavior.  Generates probability distributions over potential points of interest (POIs).
        *   Output: Ranked list of probable POIs with associated informational “tags” (text, icons, short videos).  Confidence scores for each tag.
    *   **Echo Overlay Manager:**
        *   Input: Ranked list of POIs from Predictive Modeling Engine, confidence scores, current camera view.
        *   Process:  Dynamically generates visual "echoes" – subtle, translucent overlays displaying the informational tags.
            *   Echoes are initially displayed around potential POIs, even if the user isn't directly looking at them.
            *   Echo intensity (opacity, size) is proportional to the confidence score and inversely proportional to the distance from the user’s gaze.
            *   As the user’s gaze approaches a POI, the echo intensifies and transitions into a full visual overlay.
            *   If the user ignores a POI, the echo fades out.
        *   Output: Rendered visual overlays for display on the interface.
    *   **Contextual Filtering:**
        *   Module that actively filters information based on user-defined preferences and 'quiet zones'. Users can define types of information to never display as echoes, or designate areas where echoes should be suppressed (e.g., during meetings).
    *   **Adaptive Learning:**
        *   Continuously refines the predictive model based on user interactions.  If the user consistently ignores certain echoes, the model learns to lower the probability of those POIs in the future.

**Pseudocode (Echo Overlay Manager):**

```
function render_echoes(poi_list, confidence_scores, gaze_direction, camera_view):
    for each poi in poi_list:
        distance = calculate_distance(poi.location, gaze_direction)
        echo_intensity = confidence_scores[poi] / (distance * scale_factor)
        echo_intensity = clamp(echo_intensity, 0, 1)

        render_overlay(poi.info, poi.location, echo_intensity)
    end for
end function
```

**Example Use Cases:**

*   **Navigation:** Displaying subtle echoes of street names or business logos *before* the user consciously searches for them.
*   **Shopping:** Showing echoes of product information or price comparisons as the user browses a store.
*   **Social Interaction:** Displaying echoes of names or relationships when encountering people in a crowd.
*   **Accessibility:** Providing subtle echoes of environmental cues for visually impaired users.
