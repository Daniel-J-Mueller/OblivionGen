## Dynamic Palette Morphing with Temporal Coherence

**Concept:** Expand the static color palette generation to create dynamically morphing palettes that respond to video or live feed input, maintaining visual coherence over time. This moves beyond a single image-derived palette to a *sequence*-aware palette.

**Specifications:**

**1. Input:**

*   Video stream or sequence of images (frames).
*   User-adjustable "morph speed" parameter (float: 0.0 - 1.0, representing seconds to transition).
*   Initial seed palette (can be generated via the existing patent method, or user-defined).
*   "Coherence strength" parameter (float: 0.0-1.0). Higher values prioritize maintaining colors from previous frames.

**2. Processing Pipeline:**

*   **Frame Analysis:** For each frame in the input sequence:
    *   Apply the existing color extraction algorithm (from the provided patent) to generate a candidate palette.
    *   Calculate a "palette difference score" between the candidate palette and the *current* active palette. This score represents the total color distance (e.g., CIEDE2000) between corresponding colors in the two palettes.
*   **Palette Blending:**
    *   Calculate a blend factor based on the palette difference score and the morph speed.  A higher difference score and slower morph speed will result in a lower blend factor (slower transition).
    *   Blend the colors from the current active palette with the colors from the candidate palette using the blend factor.  This creates the new active palette for the next frame.
    *   Apply the coherence strength parameter to weighting. Higher coherence values give greater weight to colors already in the active palette. Colors that *leave* the active palette due to the blending process have their weights decayed smoothly over time.
*   **Palette Color Weighting:** Maintain individual weights for each color in the active palette.
    *   Weights are boosted when the color is prominent in the current frame.
    *   Weights are decayed gradually over time, ensuring less frequent colors fade out of the palette.
    *   A minimum weight threshold can be established to prevent complete removal of colors.
*   **Output:** A continuously updating color palette with dynamically adjusted colors and weights.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize:
activePalette = generateInitialPalette(seedImage)
activePaletteWeights = initializeWeights(activePalette)

// For each frame in videoSequence:
candidatePalette = generatePaletteFromFrame(currentFrame)
paletteDifferenceScore = calculatePaletteDifference(activePalette, candidatePalette)
blendFactor = calculateBlendFactor(paletteDifferenceScore, morphSpeed)

// Blend palettes, weighting existing colors for coherence
newActivePalette = blendPalettes(activePalette, candidatePalette, blendFactor, coherenceStrength)
newActivePaletteWeights = updatePaletteWeights(newActivePalette, currentFrame)

activePalette = newActivePalette
activePaletteWeights = newActivePaletteWeights

output activePalette
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for the color extraction and blending operations.
*   Sufficient memory to store the active palette, candidate palette, and intermediate data.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Dynamic lighting effects in games or virtual environments.
*   Color grading and visual effects in video editing.
*   Adaptive user interfaces that respond to changing content.
*   Creation of visually appealing and engaging animations.
*   Stylistic image/video filters.
