## Dynamic Key Orchestration with Reputation-Based Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the trust score mechanism to not only determine *how* data is delivered (encrypted/plaintext) but also *where* the data encryption key resides, and even *which* key is used, via a reputation-based key sharding system. This allows for fine-grained access control and increases security by distributing key material.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Sharding & Distribution:**

*   The data encryption key (DEK) is not stored as a single entity. Instead, it’s split into multiple “key shares” using a secret sharing algorithm (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).  The number of shares (n) and the threshold (k) – the minimum number of shares needed to reconstruct the DEK – are determined dynamically based on the client's trust score.
*   Each key share is stored on a different Key Management Server (KMS).  A central Key Orchestration Service (KOS) manages the distribution and retrieval of these shares.
*   The KOS maintains a mapping between clients, their trust scores, and the KMS locations holding their corresponding key shares.

**2. Trust Score Integration:**

*   **High Trust (Score > 80):**  The client receives the complete, reconstructed DEK directly from the KOS (or the KOS provides the necessary shares for immediate reconstruction). Data decryption can occur client-side.  This minimizes server load.
*   **Medium Trust (Score 50-80):** The KOS provides *references* to the KMS locations holding the key shares. The client must contact the KMS servers to retrieve their assigned shares. The client reconstructs the DEK.  This adds a layer of complexity for potential attackers.
*   **Low Trust (Score < 50):**  The data is decrypted server-side. The client receives only the decrypted data.  The DEK *never* leaves the secure server environment.

**3. Dynamic Key Rotation & Versioning:**

*   Keys are rotated periodically.
*   Each key version is tracked.
*   The KOS manages the mapping between data, key versions, and client access rights.  This prevents replay attacks and ensures data integrity.

**4. Pseudocode (Key Retrieval - Medium Trust Scenario):**

```
function RetrieveKeyShares(clientID, dataID) {
  // 1. Verify Client Trust Score
  trustScore = GetClientTrustScore(clientID);

  if (trustScore > 80) {
    //High Trust – return full key
    key = GetFullKey(dataID);
    return key;
  }
  else if (trustScore <= 50) {
      //Low Trust -  Data is decrypted server-side.
      return "Server-Side Decryption";
  }
  else {
    // Medium Trust – retrieve key share locations

    keyShareLocations = GetKeyShareLocations(clientID, dataID);

    // Asynchronously retrieve key shares from KMS servers
    keyShares = []
    for (location in keyShareLocations) {
      share = RetrieveKeyShare(location);  //Asynchronous call to KMS
      keyShares.push(share);
    }

    //Reconstruct the DEK
    dek = ReconstructKey(keyShares);
    return dek;
  }
}
```

**5.  Key Management Server (KMS) API:**

*   `RetrieveKeyShare(shareID)`: Returns a key share given its ID. Authenticated access only.
*   `StoreKeyShare(share, shareID)`: Stores a key share. Secure storage, access control.

**6. Security Considerations:**

*   KMS servers must be highly secure and tamper-proof.
*   Communication between the KOS and KMS servers must be encrypted.
*   The secret sharing algorithm must be robust against attacks.
*   Regular audits of the key management system are essential.
