## Dynamic Data Sharding Based on Query Patterns

**Concept:** Extend the multi-tenant data store by dynamically sharding databases *not* based on tenant ID, but on frequently accessed data *within* tenants, determined through real-time query pattern analysis. This moves beyond static storage profiles to an adaptive system optimizing for read/write performance.

**Specifications:**

*   **Query Pattern Monitor:** A system component continuously monitors SQL queries (or equivalent) executed by each tenant. It identifies frequently accessed tables, columns, and query predicates.  This data is aggregated and analyzed using a sliding window (e.g., last 24 hours) to identify evolving access patterns.
*   **Shard Recommendation Engine:** Based on the query pattern analysis, the engine recommends logical shards for tables.  Shards are defined by ranges of values for frequently used filter columns (e.g., date ranges, customer ID ranges, product category ranges). The engine factors in data size, query frequency, and estimated shard size.  It proposes shard mappings, indicating which tenant and data ranges should reside on which physical shard.
*   **Dynamic Data Migration Service:**  A service that orchestrates the migration of data between physical shards. It employs a split-and-merge strategy to minimize downtime.
    *   **Phase 1: Shadow Reads:**  New shards are created, and all reads are temporarily duplicated – one from the original shard and one from the new shard.  Results are compared for consistency.
    *   **Phase 2: Incremental Writes:**  New writes are directed to both the original and new shards.
    *   **Phase 3: Cutover:**  Reads are switched to the new shards.  The original shard is deprecated (or archived).
*   **Storage Profile Integration:**  Storage profiles are expanded to include 'sharding strategy' parameters. These parameters specify the degree of sharding (e.g., none, coarse-grained, fine-grained), the sharding columns, and the acceptable migration window. The system uses these profiles to dynamically adjust the sharding strategy based on tenant needs and system load.
*   **Automated Rebalancing:** A background process monitors shard sizes and query performance. If a shard becomes overloaded or imbalanced, the rebalancing process automatically redistributes data across shards.

**Pseudocode (Rebalancing Process):**

```
function rebalanceShards() {
  for each shard in allShards {
    if (shard.size > maxShardSize || shard.queryLatency > maxLatency) {
      // Identify data to move
      dataToMove = findDataToMove(shard);

      // Identify target shard
      targetShard = findBestTargetShard(dataToMove);

      // Initiate data migration
      migrateData(dataToMove, targetShard);
    }
  }
}

function findDataToMove(shard) {
  // Analyze query logs to identify frequently accessed data
  // that can be moved without impacting other queries
  // Consider data locality and minimizing cross-shard joins
  return dataToMove;
}

function findBestTargetShard(dataToMove) {
  // Evaluate candidate shards based on current load, data locality,
  // and minimizing cross-shard joins
  return targetShard;
}

function migrateData(dataToMove, targetShard) {
  // Implement split-and-merge strategy as described above
  // Ensure data consistency during migration
}
```

**Expansion:** This system can leverage machine learning to predict future query patterns and proactively shard data *before* performance degradation occurs. It also opens opportunities for tiered storage – less frequently accessed shards can be migrated to cheaper, cold storage. The level of sharding can be dynamically scaled for each tenant based on their resources. This is not just tenant-aware, but *query*-aware.
