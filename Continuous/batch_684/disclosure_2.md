## Multi-Modal Priority Sorting & Proactive Notification System

**Core Concept:** Extend message prioritization beyond sender/recipient and acoustic features to incorporate real-time sensor data and predicted user intent, delivering proactive, multi-modal notifications.

**Specification:**

**1. Sensor Integration Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate data streams from device sensors: accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, ambient light, microphone (for environmental sound analysis – e.g., emergency sirens), camera (for scene understanding – recognizing locations, objects).
*   **Data Processing:** Raw sensor data is processed to extract relevant features: movement speed/type (walking, running, stationary), location (home, work, transit), ambient noise levels, visual context (meeting, outdoors, driving).
*   **Contextual Awareness:** A contextual awareness engine combines sensor data to infer user activity and environmental conditions.

**2. Intent Prediction Engine:**

*   **Historical Data:**  Analyze user message interaction history (response times, message content, frequently contacted individuals/groups).
*   **Behavioral Modeling:** Build a probabilistic model of user behavior, predicting likely actions based on time of day, location, activity, and incoming message content.
*   **Predictive Scoring:** Assign a predictive score to each incoming message indicating the likelihood of requiring immediate user attention.

**3. Multi-Modal Notification Manager:**

*   **Priority Calculation:** Calculate a composite priority score for each incoming message based on:
    *   Sender/Recipient Priority (as in the original patent).
    *   Acoustic Feature Analysis (as in the original patent).
    *   Sensor-derived Contextual Priority (higher if user is driving, in an emergency situation, or engaged in a critical task).
    *   Intent Prediction Score.
*   **Notification Modality Selection:** Dynamically select the most appropriate notification modality based on priority, context, and user preferences:
    *   **High Priority (Critical):**  Haptic feedback (distinct pattern), audible alert (emergency siren simulation), visual overlay on device screen (head-up display style), automatic voice assistant read-out.
    *   **Medium Priority:**  Standard visual notification, subtle haptic feedback, brief audio chime.
    *   **Low Priority:**  Delayed visual notification, grouped message summaries.
*   **Proactive Notification:**  Trigger notifications *before* the user explicitly requests messages under specific conditions:
    *   **Emergency Alert:** If a message indicates a potential emergency (keywords like "fire," "accident," "medical"), immediately trigger a high-priority alert.
    *   **Location-Based Reminder:** If a message contains a location-based reminder (e.g., "meet me at Starbucks"), trigger a notification as the user approaches the location.
    *   **Context-Aware Follow-Up:** If the user initiated an action via message (e.g., ordering food), provide a status update proactively.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously refine priority calculation and modality selection based on user feedback and behavior.

**Pseudocode (Notification Manager):**

```
function process_incoming_message(message):
  context = get_user_context()
  priority = calculate_priority(message, context)
  modality = select_modality(priority, context)
  send_notification(message, modality)

function calculate_priority(message, context):
  sender_priority = get_sender_priority(message)
  acoustic_priority = analyze_acoustic_features(message)
  contextual_priority = get_contextual_priority(context)
  intent_score = predict_intent(message, context)
  priority = (sender_priority * 0.3) + (acoustic_priority * 0.2) + (contextual_priority * 0.3) + (intent_score * 0.2)
  return priority

function select_modality(priority, context):
  if priority > 0.8 and context == "driving":
    return "haptic+audible+visual"
  elif priority > 0.7:
    return "audible+visual"
  elif priority > 0.5:
    return "visual+haptic"
  else:
    return "visual"
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Advanced haptic feedback actuators.
*   Directional audio speakers.
*   Low-power sensors for continuous data collection.
*   Edge processing capabilities to reduce latency and conserve battery life.
