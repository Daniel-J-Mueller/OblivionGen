## Dynamic Authorization Function Composition

**Concept:** Instead of invoking a single, pre-determined authorization function, orchestrate a *composition* of smaller, specialized functions chained together dynamically based on the request context. This allows for incredibly granular and flexible authorization logic without needing monolithic functions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Authorization Function Registry:** A central repository (database, distributed cache) holding a library of micro-authorization functions. Each function accepts a specific input type (request context, user profile, resource details) and returns a boolean (permit/deny) or a modified context. Functions are tagged with metadata describing their purpose, input requirements, and any dependencies.

*   **Policy Engine (Composition Orchestrator):**  This engine receives the initial authorization request and user context. It analyzes the request to determine a "composition plan"â€”an ordered list of authorization functions to execute. The plan is generated based on:
    *   Resource type
    *   Requested action
    *   User roles/attributes
    *   Time-of-day/location constraints (external data sources)
    *   Dynamic risk assessment (integrated threat intelligence)

*   **Execution Pipeline:**
    1.  The request context is passed to the first function in the composition plan.
    2.  The function executes and potentially modifies the context (e.g., adding a "verified" flag, enriching the user profile).
    3.  The modified context is passed to the next function in the chain.
    4.  This continues until all functions in the composition plan have executed.
    5.  A final aggregation function (e.g., AND, OR, weighted average) determines the overall authorization decision.

*   **Function Development/Deployment:**  Micro-authorization functions are designed to be small, independent, and easily deployable (e.g., using serverless functions, WASM modules). Developers can contribute new functions to the registry without impacting existing authorization policies.

*   **Context Propagation:** A standardized context object is passed between functions, ensuring consistent data flow and enabling complex conditional logic. The context should include:
    *   User identity
    *   Resource details (ID, type, attributes)
    *   Requested action
    *   Previous function outputs
    *   Risk score

**Pseudocode (Policy Engine):**

```
function generate_composition_plan(request_context, user_profile) {
  resource_type = request_context.resource_type
  action = request_context.action
  
  // Query Authorization Function Registry based on resource_type and action
  candidate_functions = query_registry(resource_type, action)
  
  // Apply filters based on user_profile (roles, attributes)
  filtered_functions = filter_functions(candidate_functions, user_profile)
  
  // Sort functions based on priority (e.g., risk assessment, security level)
  sorted_functions = sort_functions(filtered_functions)
  
  return sorted_functions
}

function execute_authorization_pipeline(request_context, composition_plan) {
  current_context = request_context
  
  for (function in composition_plan) {
    current_context = function.execute(current_context)
  }
  
  // Aggregate results (e.g., AND, OR)
  authorization_decision = aggregate_results(current_context)
  
  return authorization_decision
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Granular Control:** Fine-grained authorization policies tailored to specific scenarios.
*   **Flexibility:** Easy adaptation to changing security requirements and business logic.
*   **Scalability:**  Microservices architecture enables independent scaling of authorization functions.
*   **Auditability:**  Detailed logs of function execution provide a clear audit trail.
*   **Reduced Complexity:**  Smaller, more manageable authorization functions.
