## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Inventory Interaction

**Concept:** Expand the radio-frequency proximity detection to create a localized haptic feedback system, guiding users to items and confirming interactions without visual cues. This moves beyond simple detection to *active* guidance.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: User Wristband/Glove:**
    *   Miniature RF Transmitter/Receiver: Continuously transmits a low-power RF signal unique to the user. Receives signals from the fixture system.
    *   Haptic Actuators: Array of small, individually controllable vibration motors or shape-memory alloy actuators embedded in a flexible wristband or glove.
    *   Microcontroller: Processes received signals and controls haptic actuators.
    *   Power Source: Rechargeable battery.
*   **Component 2: Fixture Integration (per lane/item location):**
    *   RF Beacon Array: Small, low-power RF beacons positioned *within* each lane or item location. These beacons emit a unique signal *modulated* by the signal from the user’s wristband.  The modulation frequency/pattern indicates the specific item or lane.
    *   Antenna Array: Embedded within the fixture structure, detecting the user's wristband signal *and* the modulated beacon signals.
    *   Microcontroller:  Processes RF data, calculates signal strength and modulation characteristics, and transmits data to a central controller.
*   **Component 3: Central Control Unit:**
    *   Data Aggregation: Collects data from all fixture microcontrollers.
    *   Spatial Mapping: Maintains a real-time map of user hand position and item locations.
    *   Haptic Control Algorithm:  Calculates appropriate haptic feedback patterns for the user’s wristband/glove.
    *   Communication:  Transmits haptic control signals to individual wristbands/gloves.

**Operation:**

1.  User wears the wristband/glove.
2.  The wristband/glove continuously transmits a unique RF signal.
3.  As the user’s hand approaches the fixture, the fixture's antenna array detects the user’s RF signal.
4.  The fixture's RF beacons activate, their signals modulated by the user’s RF signature.
5.  The fixture's microcontroller detects the combined signals, identifies the closest item(s), and sends data to the central control unit.
6.  The central control unit calculates the optimal haptic feedback pattern based on the user’s hand position and the target item(s).
7.  The central control unit transmits the haptic control signal to the user’s wristband/glove.
8.  The wristband/glove activates the appropriate haptic actuators, guiding the user’s hand to the target item.
9.  Upon successful item interaction (determined by a stronger RF signal indicating close proximity or touch), the haptic feedback confirms the interaction.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Control Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateHapticFeedback(userHandPosition, targetItemPosition):
    distance = CalculateDistance(userHandPosition, targetItemPosition)
    IF distance > thresholdDistance:
        // Directional Guidance
        directionVector = Normalize(Subtract(targetItemPosition, userHandPosition))
        hapticIntensity = Map(distance, thresholdDistance, 0, maxIntensity, linear)
        SetHapticActuator(directionVector, hapticIntensity) //Activate actuators corresponding to direction
    ELSE IF distance < confirmationDistance:
        // Confirmation Feedback
        SetHapticActuator(allActuators, confirmationIntensity) //Activate all actuators briefly
    ELSE:
        // No Feedback
        SetHapticActuator(allActuators, 0)
    END
END
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Assisted Picking: Guides workers to the correct items in a warehouse or fulfillment center.
*   Accessibility: Provides tactile guidance for visually impaired individuals.
*   Training:  Instructs users on the proper handling of delicate items.
*   Inventory Navigation: Allows users to locate items within a complex storage system without looking at labels.
