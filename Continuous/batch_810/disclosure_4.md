## Dynamic Network Address 'Shadowing' for Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Expand the idea of advertising network addresses with varying specificity to include a ‘shadowing’ mechanism. Instead of just advertising *what* is available, proactively advertise *potential* availability based on predicted load or failure scenarios. This creates a pre-emptive failover environment, reducing latency significantly.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Analytics Module (PAM):**
   *   Located within each Point of Presence (PoP).
   *   Constantly monitors internal PoP health (CPU, Memory, Network I/O).
   *   Monitors external network conditions – latency to peered PoPs, packet loss rates.
   *   Employs time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to predict potential overload or failure within a defined time window (e.g., 5-30 seconds).
   *   Outputs a ‘Risk Score’ – a numerical value representing the probability of failure or overload.

**2. Shadow Address Advertisement:**
   *   Each PoP periodically broadcasts ‘Shadow Advertisements’ in addition to standard advertisements.
   *   Shadow Advertisements contain the same network address ranges, but tagged with the PoP’s current Risk Score.
   *   Risk Score is encoded within a dedicated field in the advertisement packet (e.g., 8-bit integer).
   *   Advertisements are differentiated via a specific flag indicating it is a ‘Shadow Advertisement’.

**3. Edge Routing Layer Modification:**
   *   Edge routers maintain a modified routing table that incorporates Risk Scores.
   *   Routing table entries now include:
        *   Network Address Range
        *   PoP Association
        *   Specificity Level
        *   Risk Score
   *   Routing Algorithm:
        *   Prioritize routes with the *lowest* Risk Score.
        *   If multiple routes have the same Risk Score, fall back to the highest specificity level.
        *   Introduce a ‘Risk Threshold’ – a configurable value. Routes with a Risk Score exceeding the threshold are temporarily disabled.

**4. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
   *   Implement a feedback loop to dynamically adjust the Risk Threshold based on network conditions.
   *   Monitor the number of successful/failed packet deliveries for each route.
   *   If the failure rate exceeds a predefined threshold, lower the Risk Threshold to prioritize more resilient routes.

**Pseudocode (Edge Routing Layer):**

```
function routePacket(packet):
  destinationAddress = packet.destinationAddress
  candidateRoutes = getRoutesForAddress(destinationAddress)

  # Sort candidate routes by Risk Score (ascending) then Specificity (descending)
  sortedRoutes = sortRoutes(candidateRoutes)

  bestRoute = sortedRoutes[0]

  if bestRoute.riskScore <= riskThreshold:
    forwardPacket(packet, bestRoute.poP)
  else:
    # Route to alternative PoP (if available, or drop the packet)
    forwardPacket(packet, alternativePoP)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   PAM can be implemented as a software module running on standard server hardware within each PoP.
*   Edge routers may require software updates to support the modified routing table and algorithm.
*   Consider using a dedicated hardware accelerator for PAM to improve performance.
*   Secure communication between PoPs and Edge Routers is critical to prevent spoofing.
