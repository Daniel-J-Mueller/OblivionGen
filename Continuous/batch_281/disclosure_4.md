## Dynamic Role Graph Reconstruction with Real-Time Threat Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the role reachability analysis by dynamically reconstructing the role graph based on real-time threat modeling and observed network behavior. Instead of a static or periodically updated graph, the system adapts to potential attacks *during* role assumption, adding or removing edges and nodes to represent compromised or actively exploited roles/resources.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Threat-Aware Graph Reconstructor (TAGR)
*   **Input:**
    *   Initial Role Graph (from existing system)
    *   Real-time Network Traffic Data (e.g., logs, IDS/IPS alerts, firewall data)
    *   Threat Intelligence Feeds (e.g., known malicious IPs, attack patterns)
    *   Role Session Data (user, role, accessed resources, timestamps)
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Behavioral Anomaly Detection:** TAGR monitors role session activity for deviations from established baselines (access patterns, resource usage, timing). This uses machine learning models trained on normal behavior.
    2.  **Threat Correlation:** Incoming threat intelligence is correlated with active roles and resources. If a role or resource is flagged as compromised, its representation in the graph is updated.
    3.  **Dynamic Edge/Node Manipulation:**
        *   **Compromised Role/Resource:**  Node is marked as ‘suspect’. Edges connecting it to other nodes are weighted to reflect the probability of compromise propagation.  New ‘shadow’ nodes representing attacker-controlled versions of the role/resource are created.
        *   **Active Attack:** If an attack is detected on a role/resource, edges representing potential attack paths are dynamically added to the graph. These edges have very high weights.
        *   **Adaptive Firewall Rules:**  Based on the updated graph, temporary firewall rules are generated to block potential attack paths.
    4.  **Role Reachability Re-evaluation:** The role reachability analysis is performed *continuously* on the dynamically updated graph. This allows the system to detect potential privilege escalation attacks or unauthorized access attempts in real-time.
*   **Output:**
    *   Dynamically updated Role Graph
    *   Real-time Alerts (e.g., “Potential privilege escalation detected – Path from Role A to Role B through compromised Resource X”)
    *   Adaptive Firewall Rules
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
function update_role_graph(network_traffic, threat_intelligence, current_graph):
  anomaly_score = detect_anomalies(network_traffic)
  compromised_nodes = check_threat_intelligence(threat_intelligence, current_graph)

  for node in current_graph.nodes:
    if node in compromised_nodes:
      mark_node_as_compromised(node)
      create_shadow_node(node) # Attacker controlled version
      update_edge_weights(node, increased_weight) # High propagation risk

  #Add edges to represent active attacks
  attack_paths = detect_attack_paths(network_traffic)
  for path in attack_paths:
    add_edge_to_graph(path.source, path.destination, high_weight)

  #Re-evaluate role reachability
  new_reachability = perform_role_reachability_analysis(new_graph)

  return new_graph, new_reachability
```

*   **Engineering Considerations:**
    *   High-performance graph database required (e.g., Neo4j).
    *   Scalable machine learning models for anomaly detection.
    *   Real-time data ingestion pipeline.
    *   Automated threat intelligence feed integration.
    *   Robust error handling and failover mechanisms.
