## Mobile Drive Unit - Dynamic Workspace Mapping & Predictive Collision Avoidance

**Concept:** Integrate a low-resolution, real-time 3D mapping system with the mobile drive unit's existing obstacle and position sensors to create a dynamically updated workspace model. This model isn’t for high-fidelity navigation, but for *predictive* collision avoidance specifically during rotation maneuvers.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera (resolution: 320x240) mounted at a 45-degree angle, providing a wide field of view.
    *   Existing obstacle sensors (ultrasonic, IR) retained for close-range detection.
    *   Existing position sensors (fiducial mark detection) retained for global localization.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - 6DoF – for accurate rotation tracking.
*   **Mapping Module:**
    *   Data Fusion: Combine ToF data, obstacle sensor data, and IMU data to generate a sparse 3D point cloud map of the immediate surroundings (radius: 5 meters).
    *   Map Update Rate: 10 Hz.
    *   Map Representation: Octree-based for efficient storage and retrieval.
    *   Dynamic Object Tracking: Implement a simple Kalman filter to track the movement of dynamic objects within the map.
*   **Predictive Collision Avoidance:**
    *   Rotation Trajectory Planning: When a rotation maneuver is initiated, the system generates a predicted trajectory of the inventory holder's movement, considering the rotation speed and radius.
    *   Collision Prediction: Project the predicted trajectory onto the 3D map and check for potential collisions with static or dynamic objects.
    *   Adaptive Rotation Speed: If a collision is predicted, dynamically adjust the rotation speed to avoid the collision.  A tiered system: Slow, Moderate, Fast.
    *   Emergency Stop: Implement an emergency stop mechanism if a collision is imminent.
*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   Wireless communication with the management module to transmit map data and receive updates on the workspace layout.
*   **Processing Unit:**
    *   Embedded system with sufficient processing power to handle sensor data fusion, map generation, and collision prediction in real-time.  (Nvidia Jetson Nano equivalent)
*   **Power Requirements:**
    *   Integrated into the existing mobile drive unit power system.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Collision Avoidance):**

```
function predict_collision(predicted_trajectory, 3d_map):
  for each point in predicted_trajectory:
    if point intersects with any object in 3d_map:
      return True
  return False

function adjust_rotation_speed(current_speed, predicted_collision):
  if predicted_collision:
    if current_speed == "Fast":
      current_speed = "Moderate"
    elif current_speed == "Moderate":
      current_speed = "Slow"
    else:
      emergency_stop()
  return current_speed

loop:
  receive rotation instruction from management module
  generate predicted rotation trajectory
  if predict_collision(trajectory, 3d_map):
    new_speed = adjust_rotation_speed(current_speed, True)
  else:
    new_speed = current_speed
  execute rotation at new_speed
  update 3d_map with new sensor data
```

**Innovation:** Traditional collision avoidance systems react *to* obstacles. This system *predicts* collisions during a specific maneuver (rotation) and proactively adjusts the operation to avoid them, increasing safety and efficiency. The low-resolution mapping keeps processing requirements manageable while providing sufficient information for predictive collision avoidance.
