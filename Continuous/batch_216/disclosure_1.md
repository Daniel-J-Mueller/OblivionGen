## Adaptive Equipment Calibration via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Expand the system to incorporate real-time biofeedback data (e.g., electromyography - EMG, galvanic skin response - GSR) to *dynamically calibrate* the “placement criteria” for equipment. This moves beyond static definitions of “proper placement” to account for individual physiology and real-time adjustments.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate support for commercially available biofeedback sensors (EMG for muscle activation, GSR for stress/tension, potentially even rudimentary EEG for cognitive load).  API for sensor data input (Bluetooth, USB).
*   **Baseline Calibration Phase:**
    *   User performs a series of standardized movements/tasks while wearing the equipment *and* biofeedback sensors.
    *   System records biofeedback data during these movements.
    *   Algorithm identifies optimal biofeedback signatures (e.g., minimal muscle strain, steady GSR) associated with correctly positioned equipment.  This creates a personalized "ideal profile".
*   **Real-Time Adaptive Adjustment:**
    *   During operation, the system continuously monitors biofeedback signals.
    *   If biofeedback deviates significantly from the personalized "ideal profile", the system provides subtle visual or haptic feedback to the user, guiding them to adjust equipment positioning.
    *   The system records these adjustments and *updates* the personalized "ideal profile" over time, creating a continuously refining model.
*   **Data Fusion & Filtering:** Implement a Kalman filter to fuse image-based equipment detection with biofeedback data, smoothing out noise and improving accuracy.
*   **Confidence Threshold Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjust the confidence threshold for “proper placement” based on biofeedback. If biofeedback indicates discomfort, lower the threshold and flag even slight deviations.
*   **Equipment-Specific Profiles:** Maintain separate calibration profiles for each type of equipment.
*   **API for Third-Party Sensor Integration:**  Allow developers to create custom sensor integrations.

**Pseudocode (Calibration Phase):**

```
FUNCTION calibrateEquipment(equipmentType, userID):
  // Initialize biofeedback sensors
  sensors = getBiofeedbackSensors()
  sensors.start()

  // Prompt user to perform standardized movements
  displayInstructions("Please perform the following movements while wearing the equipment...")

  // Record biofeedback data during movements
  data = sensors.recordData(duration=60 seconds)

  // Analyze data to identify optimal biofeedback signatures
  idealProfile = analyzeBiofeedbackData(data) //Algorithm to identify signatures

  // Store idealProfile associated with userID and equipmentType
  saveProfile(userID, equipmentType, idealProfile)

  sensors.stop()
  displayMessage("Calibration complete!")
END FUNCTION
```

**Pseudocode (Real-Time Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION analyzePlacement(image, equipment, userID):
  // Detect equipment and user pose
  equipmentPosition = detectEquipment(image)
  userPose = detectPose(image)

  // Retrieve personalized ideal profile
  idealProfile = loadProfile(userID, equipment)

  // Get real-time biofeedback data
  biofeedbackData = getBiofeedbackData()

  // Calculate deviation from ideal profile
  deviation = calculateDeviation(biofeedbackData, idealProfile)

  // If deviation exceeds threshold:
  IF deviation > threshold:
      //Provide feedback to user (visual/haptic)
      provideFeedback(feedbackType = "adjustPosition")

      // Update ideal profile with new data (adaptive learning)
      updateProfile(userID, equipment, biofeedbackData)
  ENDIF

  //Determine if equipment is properly placed
  isProperlyPlaced = determineProperPlacement(equipmentPosition, userPose)
  return isProperlyPlaced
END FUNCTION
