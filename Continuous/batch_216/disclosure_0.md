## Adaptive Granularity Transfer Scheduling

**Specification:** Implement a dynamic transfer scheduling system that adapts the granularity of data transfer between the computing device and the physical GPU based on predicted access patterns and network conditions.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Predictor:** A machine learning model trained on application access logs and GPU state. Predicts future memory access patterns (spatial locality, temporal locality) for the local buffer.
*   **Network Condition Monitor:** Continuously monitors network latency, bandwidth, and packet loss between the computing device and the GPU server.
*   **Transfer Granularity Controller:**  Adjusts the size of data chunks transferred between the computing device and GPU.  Possible granularities include:
    *   **Coarse:** Entire local buffer transferred at once.
    *   **Medium:** Page-sized chunks (e.g., 4KB) transferred.
    *   **Fine:** Cache-line sized chunks (e.g., 64 bytes) transferred.
    *   **Sub-Cacheline:**  Individual data elements transferred (for very specific, predictable access).
*   **Transfer Queue Manager:** Prioritizes and schedules data transfers based on predicted access urgency and network conditions.  Utilizes multiple transfer threads for parallelization.
*   **Metadata Augmentation:** Extend existing metadata to include:
    *   Transfer Granularity:  Indicates the size of the last transfer.
    *   Predicted Access Time:  Timestamp when the data is expected to be accessed.
    *   Transfer Priority:  Based on access urgency and application requirements.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Inside the virtual compute instance

function handle_memory_access(address, access_type) {
  if (local_buffer_protected()) {
    generate_exception();
    mark_buffer_for_transfer();
    schedule_transfer();
  }
}

function schedule_transfer() {
  access_pattern = access_pattern_predictor.predict(current_accesses);
  network_conditions = network_condition_monitor.get_conditions();

  transfer_granularity = determine_optimal_granularity(access_pattern, network_conditions);

  transfer_size = calculate_transfer_size(transfer_granularity);

  transfer_queue_manager.enqueue(buffer_address, transfer_size, transfer_priority);
}

function determine_optimal_granularity(access_pattern, network_conditions) {
    //Heuristic based on access pattern & network conditions
    if(network_conditions.latency > threshold && access_pattern.locality == low){
        return fine_granularity;
    } else if (network_conditions.bandwidth < threshold && access_pattern.locality == high){
        return coarse_granularity;
    } else {
        return medium_granularity;
    }
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  The application issues a memory access.
2.  If the local buffer is protected, an exception is generated, and the buffer is marked for transfer.
3.  The `schedule_transfer()` function is called.
4.  The access pattern predictor predicts future access patterns.
5.  The network condition monitor assesses network characteristics.
6.  The `determine_optimal_granularity()` function selects the best transfer granularity.
7.  The transfer queue manager enqueues the transfer with appropriate priority.
8.  The transfer is executed by a dedicated transfer thread.
