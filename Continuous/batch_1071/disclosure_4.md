## Dynamic Data Sharding with Predictive Pre-Computation

**Concept:** Extend the horizontal scaling concept by adding a layer of predictive pre-computation, dynamically adjusting sharding *before* data arrives, based on anticipated load and data characteristics. This moves beyond reactive distribution to proactive optimization.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Load Modeling Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical time series data (from existing system), real-time event streams (e.g., application logs, user activity), external data sources (e.g., weather, holidays).
*   **Process:** Utilizes time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict incoming data volume and distribution characteristics (e.g., value ranges, frequency of specific events) for short time horizons (e.g., 5-60 minutes).  This model must support rapid re-training and adaptation to changing data patterns.  Employs anomaly detection to identify unexpected shifts in anticipated load.
*   **Output:** Predicted load profile – a probabilistic distribution of expected data volume and characteristics over the prediction horizon.  Anomaly score indicating the degree of deviation from expected patterns.

**2. Dynamic Shard Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Predicted load profile (from Predictive Load Modeling Module), current shard configuration (number of shards, data ranges assigned to each), hardware resource availability (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
*   **Process:** Based on the predicted load and resource availability, dynamically adjusts the shard configuration.  This includes:
    *   **Shard Splitting/Merging:** Splits existing shards to handle increased load in specific data ranges, or merges shards to reduce overhead when load is low.
    *   **Data Replication:**  Replicates data to shards experiencing high predicted load to distribute the processing burden.
    *   **Shard Migration:** Migrates data between shards to balance load based on predicted access patterns.
*   **Output:**  Updated shard configuration – a mapping of data ranges to physical shards.

**3. Pre-Computation Module:**

*   **Input:** Updated shard configuration, predicted data characteristics.
*   **Process:**  Before data arrives, pre-computes aggregates or summaries for the predicted data ranges within each shard. This might involve calculating rolling averages, histograms, or performing other data transformations. The type of pre-computation is configurable based on the anticipated query patterns.
*   **Output:** Pre-computed aggregates/summaries stored within each shard.

**4.  Data Ingestion Pipeline Modification:**

*   **Process:**  The existing data ingestion pipeline is modified to incorporate the pre-computed aggregates. When data arrives, it's first processed against the pre-computed data to quickly satisfy common queries.  Any remaining processing is then performed against the raw data.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Shard Adjustment Engine):**

```pseudocode
function adjustShards(predictedLoad, currentConfiguration, resources):
  if predictedLoad.anomalyScore > threshold:
    // Aggressive re-sharding strategy
    newConfiguration = calculateOptimalSharding(predictedLoad, resources, aggressiveMode=True)
  else:
    // Conservative re-sharding strategy
    newConfiguration = calculateOptimalSharding(predictedLoad, resources, aggressiveMode=False)

  if newConfiguration != currentConfiguration:
    migrateData(currentConfiguration, newConfiguration)
    updateShardMetadata(newConfiguration)

  return newConfiguration

function calculateOptimalSharding(predictedLoad, resources, aggressiveMode):
  // Logic to determine optimal number of shards and data ranges
  // based on predicted load and available resources.
  // Considerations:
  //  - Minimize data skew across shards
  //  - Maximize parallel processing opportunities
  //  - Minimize communication overhead
  //  - Handle hot spots effectively
  // Aggressive mode might prioritize over-provisioning
  // to ensure responsiveness under high load.

  return new ShardConfiguration

function migrateData(oldConfiguration, newConfiguration):
  // Logic to migrate data between shards based on the new configuration.
  // Considerations:
  //  - Minimize downtime
  //  - Ensure data consistency
  //  - Handle data conflicts

  // Example: Data can be migrated in batches during off-peak hours.
  // For critical data, replication can be used to ensure availability.
```

**Novelty:** This system isn't just *reacting* to load; it's *predicting* it and proactively adjusting the data distribution. The pre-computation module further accelerates query performance by providing pre-calculated results. This moves beyond the reactive approach of the original patent to a more proactive and efficient system.
