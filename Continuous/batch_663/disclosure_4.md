## Acoustic Holography for Dynamic Room Correction

**Concept:** Leverage the principles of acoustic holography combined with a microphone array to dynamically correct for room acoustics *before* beamforming, effectively creating a 'cleaner' input signal for the beamformer to process.  This moves beyond simply correcting for surface reflections impacting individual microphones and aims to reshape the entire acoustic field *within* the array’s listening space.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-density microphone array (64+ elements) – hemispherical or spherical configuration preferred.
    *   High-performance DSP/FPGA for real-time processing.
    *   Calibration speaker for initial acoustic mapping.
    *   Optional:  Array of small, individually addressable acoustic radiators (e.g., MEMS speakers) positioned around the array to actively shape the acoustic field.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Acoustic Mapping (Calibration Phase):**
        *   Emit a series of swept-sine or white noise signals from the calibration speaker.
        *   Record the resulting signals on the microphone array.
        *   Employ Time-Difference-of-Arrival (TDOA) and beamforming techniques to create a 3D map of the room’s impulse response *within* the array's effective listening volume.  This is not a full room impulse response, but a localized one focused on the area immediately around the array.
        *   The map will represent the amplitude and phase of sound waves arriving at each microphone from various points within the defined listening space.  Essentially, a holographic representation of the acoustic field.
    2.  **Real-Time Acoustic Correction:**
        *   Incoming audio signal captured by the microphone array.
        *   **Holographic Subtraction:**  Using the pre-computed acoustic map, *subtract* the modeled reflections and reverberations from the incoming signal. This is done in the frequency domain, applying appropriate amplitude and phase shifts to counteract the modeled acoustic artifacts.
        *   This produces a “corrected” signal that represents the sound source as if it were in an anechoic environment.
        *   **Beamforming Application:** Apply standard beamforming algorithms (as outlined in the provided patent) to the corrected signal.
    3.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**
        *   Continuously monitor the acoustic environment using the microphone array.
        *   Employ adaptive filtering techniques (e.g., Recursive Least Squares) to refine the acoustic map and correct for changes in the environment (e.g., people moving, objects being added/removed).
        *   If active acoustic radiators are deployed, use the adaptive filtering output to dynamically adjust their output, creating a more precise acoustic correction field.

**Pseudocode (Real-Time Correction Stage):**

```
// Input: Raw audio signal from microphone array (micSignal[])
//       Pre-computed acoustic map (acousticMap[][])
// Output: Corrected audio signal (correctedSignal[])

function correctAudio(micSignal[], acousticMap[]) {

    // 1. FFT of raw signal
    fftSignal = FFT(micSignal);

    // 2. Apply correction based on acoustic map
    for (i = 0; i < numFrequencies; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < numMicrophones; j++) {
            // Get modeled reflection/reverberation component from acoustic map
            reflectionComponent = acousticMap[j][i];

            // Subtract modeled component from frequency bin
            fftSignal[j][i] = fftSignal[j][i] - reflectionComponent;
        }
    }

    // 3. Inverse FFT to get corrected time-domain signal
    correctedSignal = IFFT(fftSignal);

    return correctedSignal;
}
```

**Novelty:**

This approach differs from standard beamforming by addressing room acoustics *before* beamforming.  The goal is to create a "cleaner" input for the beamformer, potentially improving its performance, particularly in challenging acoustic environments. The use of holographic principles and dynamic adaptation provides a level of precision and flexibility not found in traditional approaches.
