## Adaptive Request Synthesis for Proactive Capacity Planning

**Concept:** Extend the replay system to *synthesize* new, plausible request data based on observed patterns, rather than solely relying on captured data. This allows for proactively testing beyond the bounds of historical data and anticipating future load scenarios.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Synthesis Engine
*   **Location:** Integrated with Controller(s)
*   **Function:** Generate new production request data based on statistical modeling of captured data.
*   **Input:** Historical production request data (from Data Store), current system metrics (CPU, memory, network latency), external data feeds (e.g., marketing campaign schedules, public events).
*   **Output:** Synthesized production request data conforming to the same format as captured data.

**Detailed Design:**

1.  **Data Profiling:** The Synthesis Engine continuously profiles the captured production request data. This includes:
    *   Request types and their frequency
    *   Payload sizes and distributions
    *   Dependencies between requests (e.g., request A must precede request B)
    *   Timing characteristics (inter-arrival times, execution durations)
    *   Correlation with external data feeds (e.g., increased request rate during marketing campaigns).
2.  **Model Creation:** Based on the data profiling, the Synthesis Engine builds a probabilistic model of the production request data. This could involve:
    *   Markov chains to model request sequences.
    *   Gaussian Mixture Models to represent payload sizes and timing characteristics.
    *   Regression models to predict request rates based on external data feeds.
3.  **Request Generation:** The Synthesis Engine uses the probabilistic model to generate new production request data. This data should be statistically similar to the captured data, but not identical. Parameters can be tweaked to explore different load scenarios.
4.  **Test Plan Integration:** The Controller(s) can incorporate the synthesized request data into the test plan. This allows for testing scenarios that are beyond the bounds of the captured data.
5.  **Real-time Adjustment:** The synthesis engine monitors system metrics during testing. If performance degrades under synthesized load, it adjusts synthesis parameters to explore more stressful conditions or generate more representative traffic.
6.  **Feedback Loop:** The results of testing with synthesized data are fed back into the data profiling and model creation process. This allows the Synthesis Engine to continuously improve its ability to generate realistic and challenging test loads.

**Pseudocode (Controller Integration):**

```
function createTestJobs(testPlan):
  jobs = []
  for i in range(testPlan.jobCount):
    if random() < testPlan.synthesisRatio:
      # Generate synthetic request data
      requestData = synthesisEngine.generateRequestData(testPlan.profile)
    else:
      # Retrieve request data from data store
      requestData = dataStore.getRequestData(testPlan.requestIndex)

    job = createJob(requestData)
    jobs.append(job)

  return jobs
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Increased processing power for the Synthesis Engine (GPU acceleration recommended)
*   Sufficient memory for storing the probabilistic models.
*   Network bandwidth for transferring the synthesized request data.
