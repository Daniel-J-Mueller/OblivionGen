## Adaptive AOR Weighting for Proactive Call Routing & Contextual Awareness

**System Overview:**

This system extends the AOR/VAOR concept by introducing dynamic weighting to AORs based on user behavior, environmental factors, and predicted communication needs. The goal is to move beyond simple routing to *proactive* call/communication delivery, anticipating where a user is most likely to be reachable and adjusting routing priorities accordingly.

**Specifications:**

*   **AOR Weighting Engine:** A core module responsible for calculating and updating AOR weights. Weights are numerical values representing the likelihood of a user being actively reachable through devices registered to that AOR.
*   **Data Input Sources:**
    *   **Historical Communication Data:** Logs of incoming/outgoing calls, messages, app usage – indicating preferred communication channels and times.
    *   **Location Data (Optional):** If user consent is given, location data (GPS, Wi-Fi positioning) to infer context (home, work, travel).
    *   **Calendar Integration (Optional):** Access to user calendars to predict meetings, appointments, and likely availability.
    *   **Environmental Sensors (Optional):** Data from smart home devices (motion sensors, noise levels) to infer user activity (e.g., user is likely engaged in a meeting if motion sensors detect activity and a conferencing system is active).
    *   **Device State:** Monitoring of device status (screen on/off, audio playing, connected to headphones) to infer user engagement.
*   **Weighting Algorithm:** A machine learning model (e.g., a regression model or a neural network) trained on the data input sources. The model predicts the AOR weight based on the current context.
    *   **Weight Decay:** A mechanism to gradually reduce AOR weights if a device associated with that AOR hasn’t been used recently. This prevents stale weights from dominating routing decisions.
    *   **Contextual Boost:** Allows specific contextual factors (e.g., a calendar entry for a meeting) to significantly boost the weight of a particular AOR.
*   **Proactive Routing Logic:**
    *   The communication management system queries the AOR Weighting Engine for the current weights of all AORs associated with the target recipient.
    *   The system prioritizes routing attempts to devices registered to AORs with the highest weights.
    *   If an initial routing attempt fails (e.g., no answer), the system attempts to reach the recipient through devices registered to AORs with the next highest weights.
*   **Dynamic AOR Creation/Adjustment:**  A module that automatically creates or adjusts AORs based on learned user behavior.
    *   **Temporary AORs:**  Creates temporary AORs for specific events (e.g., travel) based on location data and calendar entries.
    *   **Device Grouping:**  Dynamically groups devices into AORs based on usage patterns.

**Pseudocode (Call Routing):**

```
function routeCall(recipient, audioInputData):
  targetAORs = getTargetAORs(recipient) //Returns list of AORs
  weightedAORs = []

  for aor in targetAORs:
    weight = getAORWeight(aor)  //Queries AOR Weighting Engine
    weightedAORs.append((aor, weight))

  weightedAORs.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) //Sort by weight

  for (aor, weight) in weightedAORs:
    devices = getDevicesForAOR(aor)
    for device in devices:
      try:
        connectCall(device)
        return //Call connected successfully
      except ConnectionFailed:
        continue //Try next device

  log("Call routing failed for recipient")
  return //Call failed after trying all devices
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Predictive Call Screening:** Use AOR weighting to predict whether a recipient is likely to answer a call, and automatically route the call to voicemail or a different device if the likelihood is low.
*   **Context-Aware Notifications:** Use AOR weighting to deliver notifications to the most appropriate device based on the recipient’s current context.
*   **Smart Home Integration:** Integrate with smart home devices to create more accurate user context profiles and improve routing decisions.
