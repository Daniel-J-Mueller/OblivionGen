## Dynamic Cascade Specialization via Federated Learning

**Concept:** Leverage federated learning to personalize detection cascades *on-device*, tailoring them to specific user environments and audio characteristics *without* transmitting raw audio data. This moves beyond simply ordering stages based on latency; it dynamically alters *which* stages are included in the cascade, and their thresholds, for each user.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Central Server:** Maintains a global model representing a base detection cascade (e.g., the one described in the provided patent). Stores stage definitions (models, parameters) and manages federated learning rounds.
*   **Client Devices:** Smartphones, smart speakers, IoT devices with audio input. Each device runs a local instance of the detection cascade and participates in federated learning.
*   **Federated Learning Framework:**  A secure, privacy-preserving framework (e.g., TensorFlow Federated) handles model aggregation and updates.

**2. Cascade Stage Library:**

*   A diverse library of detection stages, each representing a different model trained on various audio features (MFCCs, spectrograms, etc.). Stages are modular and swappable.
*   Stages are categorized by complexity (computational cost) and specialization (e.g., keyword spotting in noisy environments, voice command recognition, specific accent detection).
*   Each stage has associated detection and rejection thresholds, which are tunable parameters.

**3. On-Device Adaptation Process:**

*   **Initial Cascade:** Upon device activation, a base cascade (downloaded from the server) is loaded.
*   **Data Collection:** Device passively collects audio snippets during normal usage.  *No* raw audio is transmitted.  Instead, only aggregated statistics are sent. (See Data Aggregation below).
*   **Local Training:** Using the collected statistics, the device performs a few epochs of local training. This involves adjusting the weights of select stages *and* re-evaluating which stages are most effective in the user’s environment. Stages with consistently low performance are removed from the local cascade.  New stages are added based on observed characteristics of the audio.
*   **Model Aggregation:** The device sends the *changes* to its local model (weight deltas, stage selections) to the central server. These changes are aggregated using a secure aggregation algorithm.
*   **Global Model Update:** The central server updates the global model based on the aggregated changes. The updated model is then pushed to client devices.

**4. Data Aggregation:**

*   Instead of transmitting raw audio, the following statistics are collected and sent:
    *   Activation rates of each stage in the cascade.
    *   Average detection scores for each stage.
    *   Frequency of false positives/negatives.
    *   Ambient noise levels.
    *   User’s location (coarse-grained, for environmental context).
*   Data is anonymized and differentially private to protect user privacy.

**5. Dynamic Cascade Configuration:**

*   The cascade configuration (stage order, thresholds) is updated on-device after each federated learning round.
*   The system can dynamically adjust the cascade complexity based on available resources (battery life, processing power).
*   A “confidence score” is associated with each stage, reflecting its performance in the user’s environment. Stages with low confidence are bypassed or re-ordered.

**Pseudocode (On-Device Adaptation):**

```
// Initialize cascade with downloaded configuration
cascade = load_cascade_from_server()

// Main loop
while (true):
    // Collect audio data
    audio_data = collect_audio()

    // Run cascade
    detection_result = run_cascade(audio_data, cascade)

    // Collect statistics
    statistics = collect_statistics(audio_data, detection_result, cascade)

    // Send statistics to server
    send_statistics(statistics)

    // Receive updated model from server
    updated_model = receive_updated_model()

    // Apply updates to local cascade
    cascade = apply_updates(cascade, updated_model)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved detection accuracy in diverse environments.
*   Reduced latency by dynamically adjusting cascade complexity.
*   Enhanced privacy by keeping raw audio data on-device.
*   Personalized user experience.
