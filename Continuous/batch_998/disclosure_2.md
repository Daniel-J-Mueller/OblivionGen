## Adaptive Haptic Notification System – ‘SenseBridge’

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Components:** Micro-vibration actuators (piezoelectric preferred) integrated into wearable devices (wristbands, rings, clothing), a central processing unit (CPU) – potentially cloud-based or edge-computed depending on latency requirements, a wireless communication module (Bluetooth Low Energy, Ultra-Wideband), environmental sensors (microphone, accelerometer, proximity), and user profile/preference storage.
*   **Actuator Density:** Variable. Wristbands: 3-5 actuators. Rings: 1-2 actuators. Clothing (vest/jacket): 10-20 actuators distributed across torso/shoulders.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Bidirectional. Wearable communicates status (connected, battery life) and receives notification instructions. Central processing unit sends coded vibration patterns.
*   **Power Management:** Low-power consumption prioritized.  Wearables designed for multi-day operation. Wireless charging support.

**Innovation Description:**

SenseBridge leverages the core concept of device status awareness from the provided patent—specifically understanding whether a device *has* an audio output—but extends it dramatically. Instead of *replacing* audio, it *augments* it or provides an alternative notification *mode*. It does this by translating incoming communication data (voice, text, alerts) into complex haptic patterns delivered directly to the user's skin.

**Functional Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Incoming Communication Event (Call, Message, Alert)
ON IncomingCommunication(data) {

    // Determine Communication Type (Voice, Text, Alert)
    communicationType = data.type

    // Check Device Capabilities (Audio Output Available?)
    audioAvailable = CheckDeviceAudioStatus()

    // User Preference Check (Haptic Mode Enabled?)
    hapticEnabled = GetUserHapticPreference()

    // If Haptic Mode Enabled OR Audio Unavailable
    IF (hapticEnabled || !audioAvailable) {

        //  Pattern Generation
        pattern = GenerateHapticPattern(communicationType, data)

        // Pattern Execution
        ExecuteHapticPattern(pattern)
    }

    // IF Audio Available AND Haptic Enabled - Simultaneous Output
    IF(audioAvailable && hapticEnabled){
        ExecuteHapticPattern(pattern);
        PlayAudio(data);
    }
}

// Generate Haptic Pattern Function
FUNCTION GenerateHapticPattern(communicationType, data) {
    //Voice Call - Pulsating wave pattern across wrist/shoulder actuators
    IF(communicationType == "Voice Call"){
        pattern = CreateWavePattern(frequency = 2Hz, amplitude = 70%, duration = infinite);
    }
    //Text Message - Series of taps corresponding to message length
    ELSE IF(communicationType == "TextMessage"){
        messageLength = LENGTH(data.message);
        pattern = CreateTapPattern(numberOfTaps = messageLength, tapInterval = 200ms);
    }
    //Alert - Distinct rhythmic vibration sequence
    ELSE IF(communicationType == "Alert"){
        alertType = data.alertType;
        //Define vibration sequences for various alert types
        IF(alertType == "LowBattery"){
            pattern = [200ms pulse, 50ms pause, 200ms pulse, 50ms pause, 200ms pulse];
        }
        ELSE IF(alertType == "CalendarEvent"){
            pattern = [100ms pulse, 100ms pause, 100ms pulse, 300ms pause];
        }
    }
}
```

**Key Features:**

*   **Contextual Haptics:**  Haptic patterns are dynamically generated based on the type of communication and potentially even the sender/recipient (user-defined profiles).
*   **Directional Awareness:** Multi-actuator systems can create the *illusion* of sound direction (e.g., a vibration moving from left to right to indicate the source of a call).
*   **Emotional Encoding:** Experiment with vibration frequency, intensity, and pattern complexity to convey emotional tone (e.g., urgency, calmness).
*   **Environmental Adaptation:** The system integrates data from environmental sensors (microphone, accelerometer) to adjust haptic patterns. For example, if the user is in a noisy environment, the vibration intensity will be increased.
*   **Biometric Integration**: Integrate biofeedback sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) to adjust notification patterns based on user stress levels.



SenseBridge aims to create a richer, more nuanced communication experience that transcends the limitations of traditional audio notifications.  It's particularly relevant for users in noisy environments, those with hearing impairments, or those who simply prefer a more subtle and discreet notification method.
