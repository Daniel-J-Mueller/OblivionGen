**Adaptive Depth-Based Relighting System**

**Concept:** Enhance the realism of captured images/video by dynamically adjusting lighting based on detected depth information and ambient conditions. Instead of *stabilizing* an image, we *re-render* it with more accurate lighting, effectively creating a localized HDR effect that follows the subject.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor for high-resolution depth mapping (minimum 640x480).
    *   RGB camera (synchronized with ToF).
    *   High dynamic range (HDR) ambient light sensor.
    *   Optional: Infrared (IR) illuminator (controllable intensity).
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) or GPU.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Depth Map Generator:** Processes ToF data to create a high-resolution depth map. Noise filtering and outlier removal crucial.
    *   **Ambient Light Analyzer:** Determines ambient light intensity and color temperature.
    *   **Relighting Engine:** The core module. This is where the magic happens.
        *   **Shader-Based Rendering:** Utilize physically-based rendering (PBR) shaders to simulate light interaction with surfaces.
        *   **Dynamic Lighting Parameters:** Adjust light intensity, color, and direction based on depth map and ambient light analysis.
        *   **Localized HDR:** Apply HDR effects primarily to the foreground object identified by the depth map, maintaining a more natural look for the background.
        *   **Shadow Casting:** Generate realistic shadows based on the simulated light sources and the depth map.
        *   **Bloom/Glow Effect:** Controlled bloom effect to enhance the realism of the relit foreground object.
    *   **User Interface:** (Optional) Allows manual adjustment of relighting parameters (intensity, color, bloom) and selection of relighting presets.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  RGB camera and ToF sensor capture simultaneous data.
    2.  Depth Map Generator creates a depth map from ToF data.
    3.  Ambient Light Analyzer measures ambient light conditions.
    4.  Relighting Engine processes depth map, ambient light data, and RGB image to generate a relit image.
    5.  Relit image is displayed or saved.

**Pseudocode (Relighting Engine):**

```
function relightImage(rgbImage, depthMap, ambientLight):
  // Normalize depth map to a 0-1 range
  normalizedDepthMap = normalize(depthMap)

  // Calculate light intensity based on depth and ambient light
  lightIntensity = calculateLightIntensity(normalizedDepthMap, ambientLight)

  // Calculate light color based on ambient light and desired effect
  lightColor = calculateLightColor(ambientLight)

  // Loop through each pixel in the RGB image
  for each pixel (x, y) in rgbImage:
    // Get depth value for the pixel
    depthValue = normalizedDepthMap[x, y]

    // Calculate diffuse lighting based on depth, light intensity, and light color
    diffuseColor = calculateDiffuseColor(depthValue, lightIntensity, lightColor)

    // Calculate specular highlights based on depth, light direction, and surface properties
    specularColor = calculateSpecularColor(depthValue)

    // Combine diffuse and specular colors
    finalColor = combineColors(diffuseColor, specularColor)

    // Apply bloom effect based on finalColor
    bloomedColor = applyBloom(finalColor)

    // Set the pixel color in the final image
    finalImage[x, y] = bloomedColor

  return finalImage
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced video conferencing.
*   Improved portrait photography/videography.
*   Realistic augmented reality experiences.
*   Real-time virtual production.
*   Low-light video enhancement.
