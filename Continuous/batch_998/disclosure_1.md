## Temporal Data Weaving – Multi-Resolution Predictive Surfaces

**Concept:** Expand beyond single continuous functions representing time series to *weave* multiple, predictive continuous surfaces representing different resolutions and forecast horizons. This facilitates not just analysis of *what was*, but dynamically informed prediction of *what could be*, at varying granularities.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Ingestion & Resolution Layering:**

*   **Input:** Raw time-series data streams (multiple streams permissible, with defined relationships – e.g., sensor readings, financial indicators, user behavior logs).
*   **Resolution Decomposition:** Implement a multi-resolution decomposition algorithm (Wavelet Transform, Discrete Cosine Transform, or custom adaptive method) to separate incoming data into distinct resolution layers. Example: Layer 1 – Millisecond granularity, Layer 2 – Second, Layer 3 – Minute, Layer 4 – Hour, Layer 5 – Daily.  The number of layers and their spans configurable per data stream.
*   **Data Storage:** Store each resolution layer as a separate time-series within the database, optimized for its respective granularity. (Consider columnar storage formats).

**II. Predictive Surface Generation:**

*   **Model Selection:**  For *each* resolution layer, permit configuration of a predictive model. Options include:
    *   ARIMA/SARIMA
    *   Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)
    *   Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU) – with configurable network architectures and training parameters.
    *   Prophet (Facebook's time-series forecasting tool).
*   **Dynamic Model Training:** Models are automatically retrained periodically (configurable interval) using the latest data from their respective resolution layers.
*   **Forecast Horizon:**  Each model is configured with a specific forecast horizon (how far into the future it predicts). Shorter horizons for high-resolution layers, longer horizons for lower-resolution layers.
*   **Surface Construction:**  The output of each model is a continuous function (the predictive surface) representing the forecasted values for its resolution layer and forecast horizon.

**III. Temporal Weaving & Querying:**

*   **Weaving Algorithm:**  A novel “temporal weaving” algorithm combines the predictive surfaces from all resolution layers into a unified, multi-resolution surface. This isn't a simple merge. The algorithm must:
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Handle conflicts between predictions from different layers (e.g., high-resolution prediction contradicts low-resolution trend).  Use a weighted averaging scheme based on model confidence scores (derived from training metrics – RMSE, MAE, etc.).
    *   **Seamless Transition:** Ensure a seamless transition between resolution layers.  As the query time approaches the end of a layer’s forecast horizon, seamlessly switch to the next lower-resolution layer’s prediction. Interpolation techniques (splines, etc.) are crucial.
*   **Query Interface:** Expose a query interface that allows users to request predictions at *any* time and *any* resolution. The system dynamically selects the appropriate resolution layer and forecast horizon to satisfy the query.
*    **Confidence Bands:** Along with the prediction, the system returns confidence bands based on the model’s uncertainty and the weaving algorithm’s confidence scores.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function processQuery(queryTime, desiredResolution):
    resolutionLayer = selectResolutionLayer(desiredResolution)
    if queryTime within layer's forecast horizon:
        return layer.predict(queryTime), layer.confidence(queryTime)
    else:
        // Query time beyond forecast horizon, switch to next lower resolution layer
        nextLayer = getNextLowerResolutionLayer(resolutionLayer)
        return nextLayer.predict(queryTime), nextLayer.confidence(queryTime)
```

**IV. Adaptive Sampling & Anomaly Detection (Extension):**

*   Integrate adaptive sampling techniques to dynamically adjust the sampling rate of incoming data based on data volatility.  Higher volatility = higher sampling rate.
*   Use the multi-resolution predictive surface as a baseline for anomaly detection.  Deviations from the predicted surface (weighted by confidence bands) are flagged as anomalies.
