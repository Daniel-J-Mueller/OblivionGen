## Dynamic Contextual Resolution Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the video generation system to intelligently scale video resolution *during* sequence generation, based on detected content complexity and user-defined aesthetic priorities. Current systems likely operate with a fixed output resolution. This design allows for dynamic adjustment, optimizing for visual impact and computational efficiency.

**Specs:**

1.  **Complexity Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Individual frames or short video clips from the encoding process (first, second, third videos, etc.).
    *   Function: Analyze frame content for visual complexity:
        *   Object Count: Number of discernible objects.
        *   Texture Density: Measure of visual texture variation.
        *   Motion Vector Variance: Analysis of motion vectors to gauge dynamic range.
    *   Output: A complexity score (0.0 – 1.0) representing overall visual information density.

2.  **Aesthetic Priority Input:**
    *   User Interface: Allow users to define aesthetic priorities:
        *   “Detail Focus” – Prioritize high resolution for intricate details.
        *   “Motion Smoothness” – Prioritize higher frame rates at a moderate resolution.
        *   “Balanced” –  Adaptive approach balancing detail and smoothness.
    *   Data Storage: Store user preferences as weighting factors for complexity and motion.

3.  **Resolution Scaling Engine:**
    *   Input: Complexity score, aesthetic weighting factors, target frame rate, maximum output resolution.
    *   Function:  Calculate an adaptive resolution for each frame or clip:
        *   Base Resolution: Start with a default resolution.
        *   Complexity Adjustment: Increase resolution based on complexity score, weighted by user preferences.
        *   Motion Adjustment: Increase resolution (or frame rate) if high motion is detected.
        *   Resolution Capping: Ensure resolution does not exceed the maximum allowed.
    *   Pseudocode:

```
function calculate_resolution(complexity, motion, user_detail_weight, user_motion_weight, max_resolution):
    base_resolution = 1080p  // Example
    detail_adjustment = complexity * user_detail_weight * 200 // scale factor
    motion_adjustment = motion * user_motion_weight * 100

    adaptive_resolution = base_resolution + detail_adjustment + motion_adjustment

    if adaptive_resolution > max_resolution:
        adaptive_resolution = max_resolution

    return adaptive_resolution
```

4.  **Frame/Clip Encoding Pipeline Integration:**
    *   Modify the encoding pipeline to receive the dynamically calculated resolution for each frame or clip.
    *   Ensure compatibility with existing encoding codecs and formats.

5.  **Trellis Graph Integration (Extension):** Extend the trellis graph concept. Edges in the graph could now be weighted not just by camera shot and scene similarity, but also by the calculated resolution for each video segment.  Higher resolution segments might incur a computational cost, influencing the optimal path through the graph.  This adds a dimension of resource management to the sequence generation process.
