## Dynamic Precision Weighting in Systolic Arrays

**Concept:** Extend the systolic array architecture to dynamically adjust the precision of weight values during matrix multiplication, optimizing for both performance and energy efficiency.  Instead of a fixed precision, the system will assess the sensitivity of each output element to variations in input weights, and allocate higher precision to more critical weights.

**Specifications:**

*   **Weight Precision Metadata:** Each weight value stored in memory will be associated with a metadata tag indicating its current precision level (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit floating point). This metadata is loaded *alongside* the weight value into the systolic array.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis Module:** A pre-processing stage (or an online analysis during initial training epochs) calculates a sensitivity score for each weight. This score represents the impact of a small change in the weight on the final output value.  Sensitivity calculation could use techniques like local Lipschitz constants or finite difference methods.  The sensitivity score is stored alongside the weight/metadata.
*   **Dynamic Precision Shifter:** Each Processing Element (PE) in the systolic array will incorporate a dynamic precision shifter. This shifter receives the weight value, the metadata indicating precision level, and the sensitivity score. It adjusts the precision of the weight value *before* performing the multiplication. Lower sensitivity weights are truncated/quantized to lower precision, while higher sensitivity weights are maintained or even increased in precision (within hardware limits).
*   **PE Architecture Modification:**
    *   **Precision Control Logic:** Digital logic to control the width of the multiplier and adder based on the shifted precision.
    *   **Truncation/Quantization Unit:** Hardware unit to truncate or quantize the weight value to the appropriate precision level.
    *   **Variable-Width Multiplier/Adder:** A configurable multiplier and adder capable of operating on variable-width operands.
*   **Array Control Signals:** New control signals to manage the precision shifting process within the array. These signals would include:
    *   `enable_precision_shift`: Global enable for dynamic precision control.
    *   `shift_mode`:  Selects between different precision shifting modes (e.g., fixed, sensitivity-based).
*   **Calibration Phase:** An initial calibration phase to determine the optimal precision levels for different weights and sensitivity thresholds. This phase would involve running a small set of representative matrix multiplications and measuring the accuracy and performance of the system.

**Pseudocode (within each PE):**

```
// Input: weight_value, weight_metadata (precision level), sensitivity_score
// Output: scaled_weight_value

function process_weight(weight_value, weight_metadata, sensitivity_score):
    if (enable_precision_shift == 1):
        if (sensitivity_score < threshold_low):
            precision = 8
        else if (sensitivity_score > threshold_high):
            precision = 16
        else:
            precision = weight_metadata.precision //use pre-assigned precision

        if (precision < weight_metadata.precision):
            scaled_weight_value = truncate(weight_value, precision)
        else:
            scaled_weight_value = weight_value

    else:
        scaled_weight_value = weight_value

    return scaled_weight_value
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced energy consumption by operating on lower-precision weights when possible.
*   Improved performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be processed.
*   Increased accuracy by allocating higher precision to more critical weights.
*   Adaptability to different workloads and data distributions.
