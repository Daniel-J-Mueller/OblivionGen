## Experiential Reality Social Proxemics

**Concept:** Dynamically adjusting experiential reality (XR) environment parameters – specifically audio spatialization, haptic feedback intensity, and avatar scale – based on inferred social proximity between users, even when physical distance varies greatly. This goes beyond simple positional audio to create a richer, more believable sense of "personal space" within shared XR environments.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on efficient rendering of views. This inspires a system that makes the *experience* more efficient by leveraging perceptual psychology – specifically, how humans interpret social cues in a 3D space.  Rendering detailed visuals is only *part* of creating immersive co-presence.  Realistic social interaction relies heavily on subtle, non-visual cues.

**Specs:**

*   **System Components:**
    *   **Proximity Inference Engine:**  A module running on each user’s device that continuously analyzes multiple data streams:
        *   **Head/Hand Tracking:** XR headset/controller data provides absolute position and orientation.
        *   **Gaze Tracking:** Where the user is looking.
        *   **Voice Analysis:**  Speech volume, pitch, and detected emotional tone.
        *   **Biometric Data (Optional):** Heart rate variability, skin conductance (requires user consent and compatible hardware).
    *   **Social Proxemics Manager:** A central server (or distributed network) responsible for aggregating proxemics data from all users, calculating inferred social distances, and broadcasting adjustment parameters.
    *   **XR Environment Renderer:**  Modifies rendering parameters (audio spatialization, haptics, avatar scale) based on parameters received from the Social Proxemics Manager.

*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Each user's device gathers data via head/hand tracking, gaze, voice, and optional biometric sensors.
    2.  This data is transmitted to the Social Proxemics Manager.
    3.  The Manager calculates a “Social Distance Metric” for each user pair. This metric is *not* simply physical distance. It incorporates:
        *   **Physical Distance:** Euclidean distance between head positions.
        *   **Gaze Overlap:** Degree to which users are looking at each other.
        *   **Verbal Engagement:**  Speech volume and responsiveness.
        *   **Emotional Congruence:** Similarity of detected emotional tones.
        *   **Biometric Similarity (Optional):** Correlation of heart rate variability.
    4.  The Manager generates adjustment parameters for each user:
        *   **Audio Spatialization:**  Adjusts volume, direction, and reverb based on inferred social distance. Closer users have more directional, higher-quality audio.
        *   **Haptic Feedback Intensity:**  Simulates “personal space” violations or touches based on proximity.
        *   **Avatar Scale:**  Dynamically adjusts avatar size to subtly reinforce social hierarchies or intimacy.  A user feeling dominant might appear slightly larger; users seeking intimacy might appear closer in scale.
    5.  These parameters are broadcast to each user’s XR Environment Renderer.
    6.  The Renderer applies the adjustments in real-time.

*   **Pseudocode (Social Distance Metric Calculation):**

```
function calculateSocialDistance(user1Data, user2Data) {
  physicalDistance = distance(user1Data.headPosition, user2Data.headPosition);
  gazeOverlap = calculateGazeOverlap(user1Data.gazeDirection, user2Data.headPosition);
  verbalEngagement = calculateVerbalEngagement(user1Data.speechVolume, user2Data.speechVolume);
  emotionalCongruence = calculateEmotionalCongruence(user1Data.emotionalTone, user2Data.emotionalTone);

  //Weighting Factors (Tunable)
  weightPhysical = 0.3;
  weightGaze = 0.25;
  weightVerbal = 0.25;
  weightEmotional = 0.2;

  socialDistance = (weightPhysical * physicalDistance) +
                   (weightGaze * (1 - gazeOverlap)) +
                   (weightVerbal * (1 - verbalEngagement)) +
                   (weightEmotional * (1 - emotionalCongruence));

  return socialDistance;
}
```

*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   **Personal Space Customization:** Allow users to define their preferred personal space bubble.
    *   **Social Context Awareness:**  Adjust parameters based on the type of social interaction (e.g., formal meeting vs. casual hangout).
    *   **Multi-Modal Feedback:** Incorporate olfactory or temperature feedback to further enhance the sense of presence.
