## Dynamic Contextual Highlighting & "Knowledge Trails"

**Concept:** Expand the highlighting system to not just emphasize content *within* a document, but to actively build and visualize "Knowledge Trails" connecting related concepts *across* multiple documents and data sources.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Model – "Concept Nodes":**

*   Each highlighted segment of text (or other content – images, code, etc.) becomes a "Concept Node".
*   Concept Nodes store:
    *   Content snippet.
    *   Source document ID & location (page, paragraph, line).
    *   User ID who initiated the highlight.
    *   Reputation score of the user (as per the patent).
    *   **Semantic Tagging:** AI-driven tagging of the concept with relevant keywords, entities, and relationships. (e.g., "Quantum Physics", "Superposition", "Schrödinger's Cat"). This is crucial.
    *   **Relationship Scores:**  Scores representing the strength of relationships to *other* Concept Nodes.  Initialized to zero.

**2. Relationship Engine:**

*   **Automated Relationship Discovery:**  AI algorithms continuously analyze Concept Nodes for semantic similarity, co-occurrence, and contextual relatedness.
*   **Relationship Scoring:**
    *   **Semantic Similarity:** Based on tag overlap and embedding distance.
    *   **Co-occurrence:** How often concepts appear in the same document/context.
    *   **User Connections:**  If multiple users highlight related concepts, the relationship strength increases.
    *   **External Knowledge Graph Integration:** Link Concept Nodes to external knowledge graphs (e.g., Wikidata, DBpedia) to infer relationships.
*   **Relationship Update Rules:**
    *   New relationships discovered increase strength.
    *   Infrequent access to related concepts decreases strength.
    *   User feedback (e.g., "This is not related") can manually adjust strength.

**3. Visualization - "Knowledge Trails":**

*   **Interactive Graph View:** A visual graph displaying Concept Nodes and their relationships.
*   **Trail Generation:**  Users can select a starting Concept Node and request a "Knowledge Trail" based on relationship strength.
*   **Trail Filtering:**  Filter trails based on:
    *   Relationship Strength Threshold
    *   Semantic Tags
    *   User/Reputation
    *   Date Range of highlights.
*   **Dynamic Highlighting:** As the user navigates the trail, the corresponding highlighted content is dynamically displayed across all source documents.
*   **"Serendipity Mode":** Introduce random exploration of weakly connected but potentially relevant Concept Nodes.

**4. User Interface & Interaction:**

*   **Highlight Context Menu:** "Create Knowledge Trail", "Explore Related Concepts", "Serendipity Mode", "Adjust Relationship Strength".
*   **Trail Editor:**  Manually adjust trail paths, add/remove Concept Nodes, and annotate relationships.
*   **"Knowledge Map" Dashboard:** A personalized dashboard displaying the user's most frequently accessed and connected Concept Nodes.
*   **Collaboration Features:**  Share Knowledge Trails with other users and co-annotate relationships.

**Pseudocode (Trail Generation):**

```
function generateTrail(startNode, maxDepth, strengthThreshold):
  trail = [startNode]
  queue = [startNode]

  while queue is not empty and trail.length < maxDepth:
    currentNode = queue.dequeue()
    relatedNodes = getRelatedNodes(currentNode, strengthThreshold)

    for node in relatedNodes:
      if node not in trail:
        trail.append(node)
        queue.enqueue(node)

  return trail
```

**Novelty:**  While the patent focuses on aggregating highlighting within a single document, this expands the concept to create a dynamic, interconnected "Knowledge Web" *across* multiple documents and data sources.  It leverages AI to infer relationships and allows users to explore and curate their own personalized knowledge pathways.  The focus shifts from simple emphasis to knowledge discovery and exploration.
