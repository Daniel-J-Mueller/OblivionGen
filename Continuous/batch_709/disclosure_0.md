**Adaptive Acoustic Environment Mapping & Personalized Audio Projection**

**Core Concept:** Extend the device's awareness of its acoustic surroundings beyond simple power state adjustments. Map the physical environment's acoustic properties, then project audio tailored to the user's position *within* that map.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of miniature, high-bandwidth microphones (minimum 8, arranged in a circular or spherical pattern).
    *   Multiple micro-speakers (minimum 4), capable of independent audio output and beamforming.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - accelerometer and gyroscope – to track device orientation.
    *   Ultra-wideband (UWB) or similar precision location module (for initial environment mapping & device localization).
    *   Dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor) for real-time acoustic analysis & audio processing.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Environment Mapping Module:**
        *   Utilizes UWB/precision location to establish a coordinate system.
        *   Emits a series of precisely timed test tones.
        *   Microphone array captures reflections and reverberations.
        *   DSP analyzes Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and Frequency Response.
        *   Constructs a 3D acoustic map representing surface materials, distances, and reverberation characteristics.  Stores as a mesh or point cloud.
    *   **User Localization Module:**
        *   Continuously monitors microphone array for user speech source.
        *   Triangulates user position relative to the device using speech source localization techniques.
        *   Integrates IMU data for improved accuracy and stability.
    *   **Personalized Audio Projection Module:**
        *   Determines optimal speaker configuration and beamforming parameters based on user position and acoustic map.
        *   Projects audio content directly to the user's ears, minimizing reflections and maximizing clarity.
        *   Adaptive filtering to counteract ambient noise.
    *   **Power Management Integration:**
        *   Initial environment mapping performed while device is connected to external power.
        *   Learned acoustic map stored in non-volatile memory.
        *   When operating on battery, device leverages stored map to optimize audio projection and minimize power consumption.
        *   Optionally, allows for periodic re-mapping to account for environmental changes.

**Pseudocode (Personalized Audio Projection):**

```
function projectAudio(audioData, userPosition, acousticMap):
  // Calculate distance and angle to user from each speaker
  distances = calculateDistances(userPosition, speakerPositions)
  angles = calculateAngles(userPosition, speakerPositions)

  // Retrieve acoustic properties (reflection coefficient, absorption) for paths between speakers and user.
  pathProperties = getPathProperties(acousticMap, speakerPositions, userPosition)

  // Calculate optimal speaker gains based on distance, path properties, and desired sound pressure level.
  speakerGains = calculateSpeakerGains(distances, pathProperties, desiredSPL)

  // Apply beamforming weights to each speaker based on calculated gains and user position.
  beamformingWeights = calculateBeamformingWeights(speakerGains, userPosition)

  // Apply beamforming weights to audio data and output to speakers
  outputAudio(audioData, beamformingWeights)
```

**Novelty:**  Moves beyond reactive power adjustments to proactive acoustic environment analysis and personalized audio delivery. Combines spatial audio techniques with a dynamically updated environmental model. Aims to create a “personal sound bubble” for the user.
