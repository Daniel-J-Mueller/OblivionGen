## Dynamic Attestation Chains with Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Expand the attestation process beyond simple credential verification to incorporate a dynamic reputation scoring system for each subsystem. This builds upon the existing tiered approach by introducing a trust level that *changes* based on historical performance and anomaly detection, influencing the weight given to attestation results.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Attestation Logs: Records of successful/failed attestation requests, response times, and any detected anomalies.
    *   Performance Metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O operations for each subsystem.
    *   Security Event Logs: Intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts, firewall logs related to each subsystem.
    *   External Threat Intelligence: Feeds providing information on compromised systems or known vulnerabilities impacting subsystems.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:**
    *   Base Score: Each subsystem starts with a default trust score (e.g., 100).
    *   Positive Adjustments: Successful attestations, low resource usage, no security alerts contribute to score increases.
    *   Negative Adjustments: Failed attestations, high resource usage, security alerts, and matches to threat intelligence decrease the score.
    *   Decay Mechanism: Scores naturally decay over time to ensure ongoing validation.
    *   Weighting Factors:  Different data sources and metrics have different weights based on their importance.
*   **Reputation Storage:** Secure, tamper-proof storage (e.g., blockchain-inspired distributed ledger) for reputation scores.

**2. Dynamic Attestation Process:**

*   **Attestation Request Enrichment:** The initial attestation request includes a timestamp and a requestor identifier.
*   **Reputation Lookup:** Before processing the attestation request, the receiving subsystem queries the reputation module for the requestor's and the originating subsystem's reputation scores.
*   **Weighted Credential Evaluation:** The evaluation of attestation credentials is weighted by the reputation scores.
    *   Higher reputation = higher weight.
    *   Lower reputation = lower weight (potentially triggering additional verification steps or rejection).
*   **Reputation Update:** Upon successful/failed attestation, the reputation module updates the reputation scores of involved subsystems.
*   **Threshold-Based Actions:**
    *   Low Reputation Threshold: Trigger a secondary verification process (e.g., multi-factor authentication, hardware-based attestation).
    *   Critical Low Reputation Threshold: Reject the attestation request and isolate the subsystem.

**3. Pseudocode (Simplified Attestation Evaluation):**

```
function evaluateAttestation(request, credentials, subsystemReputation):
  requestorReputation = getReputation(request.requestorID)

  // Calculate weighted score
  weightedScore = (0.6 * subsystemReputation) + (0.4 * requestorReputation)

  if weightedScore >= threshold:
    return VALID
  else if weightedScore >= warningThreshold:
    // Perform secondary verification
    secondaryVerificationResult = performSecondaryVerification(credentials)
    if secondaryVerificationResult == SUCCESS:
      return VALID
    else:
      return INVALID
  else:
    return INVALID
```

**4. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Utilize Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) or Secure Enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX) for secure storage of reputation data and execution of reputation calculation algorithms.
*   Implement hardware-based attestation mechanisms to verify the integrity of reputation modules.

**5. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Reputation Propagation:** Allow reputation scores to propagate across a network of interconnected subsystems.
*   **Decentralized Reputation:** Explore a decentralized reputation system using blockchain technology.
*   **Anomaly Detection Integration:** Integrate machine learning algorithms to detect anomalous behavior and automatically adjust reputation scores.
