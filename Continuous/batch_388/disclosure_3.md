## Adaptive Read Repair with Predictive Sharding

**Concept:** Enhance data consistency and read performance by proactively repairing data inconsistencies *before* they impact read operations, coupled with a dynamic sharding strategy based on read/write access patterns. This builds on the idea of handling reads during network partitions but extends it to a proactive, predictive system.

**Specifications:**

**I. Component Architecture:**

*   **Read Repair Agent (RRA):** Deployed on each storage node. Monitors read requests and associated data versions.
*   **Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE):** Centralized service. Analyzes historical read/write patterns, network topology, and RRA reports.
*   **Dynamic Sharding Manager (DSM):**  Responsible for re-sharding data based on PAE recommendations.
*   **Version Vector Tracker (VVT):** Each node maintains a VVT for each replica group, tracking the latest known version of each data item.

**II. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Read Request Interception:**  When a client sends a read request, the request router forwards it to a potentially non-master replica (similar to the patent’s handling of partitioned scenarios).
2.  **Version Verification:** The receiving replica’s RRA checks its VVT for the requested data.  If the local version lags behind the latest known version (determined by comparing to other replicas), it initiates a background data sync.
3.  **Predictive Repair:**  The PAE continuously analyzes read request patterns. It identifies “hot spots” – data items frequently read but potentially stale.  The PAE proactively instructs RRAs to refresh those items *before* read requests arrive.
4.  **Dynamic Sharding:** Based on long-term read/write patterns, the PAE identifies imbalances in data access.  If certain data items are disproportionately read from specific nodes, the DSM re-shards the data.  This can involve moving replicas to nodes closer to frequent readers or creating additional replicas on heavily accessed nodes.
5.  **Adaptive Consistency Levels:**  The system dynamically adjusts consistency levels based on data sensitivity and access patterns. Frequently accessed, non-critical data might use eventual consistency, while sensitive data enforces stronger consistency.

**III. Pseudocode (PAE – Predictive Analysis):**

```
function analyze_access_patterns(read_logs, write_logs, network_topology):
  hot_spots = identify_frequent_reads(read_logs)
  stale_data = identify_outdated_replicas(hot_spots, write_logs)
  imbalanced_access = identify_replication_imbalances(read_logs, network_topology)

  repair_schedule = generate_repair_schedule(stale_data, repair_priority)
  sharding_recommendations = generate_sharding_recommendations(imbalanced_access)

  return repair_schedule, sharding_recommendations

function generate_repair_schedule(stale_data, priority):
  # Algorithm to prioritize repair based on read frequency, data sensitivity,
  # and network latency
  for each item in stale_data:
    priority_score = calculate_priority(item)
    schedule_repair(item, priority_score)

function generate_sharding_recommendations(imbalanced_access):
  # Algorithm to suggest replica movement or creation based on read load
  # and network topology
  for each item in imbalanced_access:
    recommend_replica_movement(item)
```

**IV.  Data Structures:**

*   **Version Vector:**  Array of (replica ID, version number) pairs.
*   **Access Pattern Log:**  Timestamped record of read/write requests, including data item ID, replica ID, and client location.
*   **Network Topology Map:**  Graph representing network connections and latency between storage nodes.

**V. Failure Handling:**

*   **RRA Failure:**  RRA responsibilities are taken over by neighboring RRAs.
*   **PAE Failure:**  The system falls back to a static sharding strategy and periodic data synchronization.
*   **Network Partition:** Nodes operate in a degraded mode, prioritizing local reads and attempting to synchronize when the network recovers.
