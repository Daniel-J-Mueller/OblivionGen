## Adaptive Snapshot Composition for Predictive Analytics

**Concept:** Extend snapshot technology to proactively compose snapshots based on predicted data access patterns, anticipating future analytical needs *before* they occur. This moves beyond simply storing point-in-time copies to creating ‘future-proof’ datasets optimized for emerging queries.

**Specs:**

*   **Prediction Engine:** Integrate a machine learning model trained on historical data access logs, query patterns, and application behavior. This engine predicts which data segments are *likely* to be needed for future analytics, data mining, or reporting. Output is a probability score for each block/segment of data.
*   **Dynamic Snapshot Layers:** Implement a layered snapshot architecture.
    *   **Base Layer:** Standard, full snapshots (as currently implemented).
    *   **Predictive Layer:** Composed of data segments identified as high probability by the Prediction Engine. These segments are copied *before* being accessed, creating a readily available, optimized dataset.
    *   **Delta Layer:** Captures changes to predictive segments *after* the predictive snapshot is created, minimizing storage overhead.
*   **Intelligent Caching & Pre-fetching:**  Combine predictive snapshots with a tiered caching system. Frequently accessed predictive segments are pre-fetched into faster storage tiers (e.g., NVMe).
*   **Query Optimization:** Modify query engines to automatically leverage predictive snapshots. If a query requires data covered by a predictive snapshot, the engine prioritizes access from that layer, bypassing the full snapshot or base layer.
*   **Data Governance & Versioning:** Maintain detailed metadata about predictive snapshot creation, including the prediction model version, data access history used for prediction, and the confidence score of each prediction. This allows for auditing and reproducibility.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Snapshot Composition):**

```
FUNCTION ComposePredictiveSnapshot(data_access_logs, prediction_model):
  predicted_segments = PredictionModel.predict(data_access_logs) // Returns list of segments with probability scores
  high_probability_segments = Filter(predicted_segments, probability > threshold)
  
  //Copy high probability segments from base snapshot to predictive layer
  FOR segment IN high_probability_segments:
      Copy(BaseSnapshot, segment, PredictiveLayer)
  
  //Create delta layer for changes in predictive segments
  MonitorChanges(PredictiveLayer)
  StoreChanges(DeltaLayer)

RETURN PredictiveLayer, DeltaLayer
```

**Component Breakdown:**

1.  **Data Access Log Collector:** Gathers access patterns from all applications accessing the block device.
2.  **Prediction Engine:** Machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, time series forecasting) trained on historical data access logs.  Output: Probability score for each data segment.
3.  **Snapshot Composer:** Orchestrates the creation of layered snapshots (base, predictive, delta).
4.  **Query Optimizer:** Modifies query plans to prioritize access from predictive snapshots.
5.  **Metadata Store:** Stores information about snapshots, prediction models, and data access history.
