## Dynamic Ambiguity Resolution via Proactive Contextual Priming

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A Predictive Context Engine (PCE).
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time utterance data.
    *   User profile data (preferences, history, device usage).
    *   Environmental data (location, time of day, detected activity – e.g., cooking, driving, meeting).
    *   A continually updated “Ambiguity Profile” for each user, detailing frequently encountered disambiguation points.
*   **Processing Flow:**
    1.  **Utterance Capture:** Voice input is received.
    2.  **Initial Processing:** Standard ASR and intent recognition.
    3.  **Ambiguity Prediction:** PCE analyzes the initial processing results *before* a definitive ambiguity is flagged. It leverages user profile, environmental data, and the Ambiguity Profile to predict potential ambiguity.
    4.  **Proactive Priming:** If ambiguity is *predicted*, the system proactively presents a set of clarifying options *before* requesting user input. These options are displayed visually on a secondary device (phone, tablet, smart display) and/or audibly via the voice assistant. The options are presented as simple, pre-defined choices (e.g., "Did you mean 'play music' or 'call Mom'?").
    5.  **Selection Handling:**
        *   If the user selects an option, the action is executed.
        *   If the user doesn't respond within a short timeframe, the system falls back to standard disambiguation techniques (e.g., "Which one did you mean?").
    6.  **Ambiguity Profile Update:** Regardless of the outcome, the PCE updates the user's Ambiguity Profile to improve future predictions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION ProcessUtterance(utteranceData, userProfile, environmentData):
    intent = PerformASR(utteranceData)
    potentialAmbiguities = PredictAmbiguities(intent, userProfile, environmentData)

    IF potentialAmbiguities.length > 0 THEN
        options = GenerateClarifyingOptions(potentialAmbiguities)
        DisplayOptions(options)
        userSelection = WaitForUserSelection(options)

        IF userSelection != NULL THEN
            ExecuteAction(userSelection)
        ELSE
            PerformStandardDisambiguation(utteranceData)
        ENDIF

        UpdateAmbiguityProfile(utteranceData, userSelection)

    ELSE
        ExecuteAction(intent)
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

Traditional disambiguation is *reactive* – it happens *after* the system detects an error. This system is *proactive* – it anticipates potential errors and attempts to resolve them *before* they occur. This should lead to a smoother, more efficient user experience. The Ambiguity Profile allows for personalized disambiguation, tailoring the options presented to the individual user’s specific needs and patterns. It moves away from a 'one-size-fits-all' approach, improving the speed and accuracy of resolutions.
