## Adaptive Packet Reconstruction with Temporal Context

**Concept:** Expand the ‘parse result vector’ beyond simple field extraction to include a temporal history of packet characteristics. This enables intelligent reconstruction of fragmented or corrupted packets by leveraging patterns observed across time. 

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** Introduce a ‘Temporal Context Buffer’ (TCB) associated with each active packet flow. The TCB stores a rolling window of parse result vectors *and* raw packet data (or statistically relevant hash values) for recent packets within that flow. The size of the rolling window is configurable.

*   **TCB Indexing:** Flows are indexed by a 5-tuple (source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, protocol) or a more advanced flow key.

*   **Packet Processing Modification:**  Modify the existing packet processing circuitry to:
    1.  Upon receiving a packet, retrieve the corresponding TCB (or create one if it doesn’t exist).
    2.  Populate the parse result vector as before.
    3.  Append the current parse result vector *and* a relevant portion of the raw packet data (e.g., the first 64 bytes, or a variable length based on packet type) to the TCB.
    4.  If the packet is fragmented (indicated by flags in the IP/TCP header), trigger a ‘reconstruction check’.

*   **Reconstruction Check:**
    1.  Examine the fragment offset and length.
    2.  Query the TCB for preceding fragments.
    3.  If preceding fragments are found *and* the current fragment fills a gap, attempt to reconstruct the complete packet.
    4.  If reconstruction is successful, forward the reconstructed packet.
    5.  If reconstruction fails (missing fragments, corrupted data), log the event and potentially employ error correction techniques.

*   **Error Correction:**  Implement a lightweight error detection/correction algorithm (e.g., Reed-Solomon coding) applied to the data stored in the TCB. This provides redundancy to mitigate data corruption.

*   **AI Integration:** Add a module that analyzes the TCB data for anomalous patterns.  This AI module could predict missing fragments, identify potential security threats, or optimize packet reassembly strategies.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Check):**

```
FUNCTION AttemptPacketReconstruction(packet, tcb):
  fragment_offset = packet.fragment_offset
  fragment_length = packet.fragment_length

  preceding_fragments = tcb.get_fragments(0, fragment_offset)

  IF preceding_fragments.length > 0 AND tcb.gap_exists(preceding_fragments, fragment_offset, fragment_length) THEN
    reconstructed_packet = reconstruct_packet(preceding_fragments, packet)
    IF reconstructed_packet.is_valid() THEN
      RETURN reconstructed_packet
    ELSE
      log_error("Reconstruction failed - invalid packet")
      RETURN NULL
    ENDIF
  ELSE
    log_warning("Missing preceding fragments")
    RETURN NULL
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   TCB storage will require dedicated memory (SRAM or DRAM). Memory bandwidth is crucial for efficient access.
*   The reconstruction algorithm can be implemented in hardware (FPGA or ASIC) for increased performance.
*   The size of the TCB window must be configurable to balance memory usage and reconstruction accuracy.
