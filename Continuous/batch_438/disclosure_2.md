## Dynamic Focal Point Adjustment via Gaze Tracking & AI-Driven Color Grading

**Concept:** Integrate real-time gaze tracking with the panoramic stitching and color adjustment system.  Instead of globally adjusting color based on overall scene analysis or pre-defined algorithms, dynamically prioritize color and contrast adjustments *around* the viewer's gaze point within the 360° video.  This creates a more immersive and perceptually optimized viewing experience.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Integration:**

*   **Gaze Tracking Module:** Integrate a high-resolution, low-latency eye-tracking system capable of accurately determining the viewer's gaze point within the 360° field of view.  This could be implemented via a headset-based system, or, potentially, room-based tracking for shared viewing experiences.  Resolution of at least 60Hz, with accuracy of <1° of visual angle.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Dedicated hardware acceleration (GPU/FPGA) for real-time gaze data processing and image manipulation.
*   **Panoramic Display System:**  Compatible with various 360° display technologies (VR headsets, cylindrical displays, multi-projector setups).

**II. Software Architecture:**

*   **Gaze Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   Receive gaze tracking data (x, y coordinates in 360° space, pupil diameter, blink detection).
    *   Filtering and smoothing algorithms to reduce noise and jitter.
    *   Calibration routine to account for individual user differences and display characteristics.
*   **AI-Driven Color Grading Module:**
    *   **Object Detection & Segmentation:**  Employ a deep learning model (e.g., YOLO, Mask R-CNN) to identify and segment objects within the panoramic video frame.
    *   **Interest Point Calculation:** Define a metric to determine the “interest” of each object (e.g., size, motion, texture, semantic importance).
    *   **Dynamic Color Adjustment:**
        *   **Gaze-Weighted Contrast:**  Increase contrast around the gaze point and gradually reduce it towards the periphery, drawing the viewer's attention.
        *   **Color Temperature Adjustment:**  Adjust color temperature around the gaze point to enhance perceived realism or mood. (Warm colors for focus, cool for periphery)
        *   **Selective Saturation:**  Increase saturation of key objects around the gaze point while desaturating the background.
*   **Panoramic Stitching Integration:** Interface with the existing stitching algorithm to apply color adjustments *before* final video rendering.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (video_playing) {

    // 1. Acquire Gaze Data
    gaze_x, gaze_y = get_gaze_coordinates()

    // 2. Object Detection & Segmentation
    objects = detect_objects(current_frame)

    // 3. Calculate Interest Points
    for each object in objects {
        interest_score = calculate_interest(object)
    }

    // 4. Determine Focus Region
    focus_region = calculate_focus_region(gaze_x, gaze_y, interest_scores, radius)

    // 5. Dynamic Color Adjustment
    for each pixel in current_frame {
        distance = calculate_distance(pixel, focus_region)
        
        if (pixel within focus_region) {
            contrast = increase_contrast(pixel, intensity)
            saturation = increase_saturation(pixel, intensity)
        } else {
            contrast = decrease_contrast(pixel, intensity * (1 - (distance / max_distance)))
            saturation = decrease_saturation(pixel, intensity * (1 - (distance / max_distance)))
        }

        pixel.color = apply_color_adjustment(pixel.color, contrast, saturation)
    }

    // 6. Stitch & Render Frame
    stitched_frame = stitch_frames(adjusted_frames)
    render_frame(stitched_frame)
}
```

**IV. Refinements:**

*   **Foveated Rendering:** Combine with foveated rendering techniques to reduce rendering load by lowering resolution in the peripheral vision.
*   **Adaptive Algorithms:** Employ reinforcement learning to adapt color adjustment parameters based on user feedback and viewing patterns.
*   **Multi-User Adaptation:** Extend to support multiple viewers, dynamically adjusting color adjustments based on the gaze of the majority.
*   **Content Awareness:** Integrate with semantic understanding algorithms to adjust color based on the content of the scene. (e.g., enhance colors of flowers, or desaturate distracting elements).
