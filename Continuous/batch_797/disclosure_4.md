## Dynamic Light Field Stitching for Volumetric Capture

**Concept:** Extend the multi-camera synchronization and compositing of the patent to enable *real-time* capture and rendering of dynamic light fields, creating volumetric scenes viewable from any perspective. This moves beyond static panoramas/stereoscopic images to a truly immersive, interactive experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Node Network:** A distributed network of cameras (minimum 4, ideally 8+) each with integrated light emitters (LED arrays capable of precise brightness and color control). Each camera acts as a ‘node’.
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** A high-performance server coordinating the network, handling synchronization, data ingestion, and compositing.
*   **Real-time Rendering Engine:**  A dedicated rendering pipeline optimized for light field data.  Nvidia OptiX or similar ray tracing infrastructure.
*   **User Interface (UI):**  Software to define capture zones, configure camera parameters, and control rendering parameters.

**2. Synchronization & Emission Protocol:**

*   **Timecode-Based Synchronization:** All cameras synchronized to a common timecode generated by the CPU.  Precision: < 1 microsecond.
*   **Adaptive Emission:** CPU calculates the optimal light emission profile for *each* camera node, based on:
    *   Scene geometry (estimated via depth sensors on each camera node or initial sparse reconstruction).
    *   Material properties (estimated or user-defined).
    *   Desired exposure and aesthetic.
    *   Ambient lighting conditions.
*   **Emission Command:** CPU sends commands to each camera node specifying:
    *   Light intensity (per LED).
    *   Color temperature.
    *   Emission duration.
    *   Capture timing.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Light emission and capture timing are continuously adjusted in response to changes in the scene or desired aesthetic.

**3. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Multi-View Image Capture:** Each camera captures a high-resolution image at its designated time, synchronized by the CPU.
*   **Depth Map Generation:** Each camera node generates a depth map of its field of view (using structured light, time-of-flight sensors, or stereo vision).
*   **Pose Estimation:** Each camera's pose (position and orientation) is accurately determined (using inertial measurement units (IMUs) and/or visual SLAM).
*   **Light Field Reconstruction:** CPU aggregates the images, depth maps, and pose data to reconstruct a dense light field representation of the scene.  Ray marching or voxel carving techniques.

**4. Rendering & Display:**

*   **Viewpoint Selection:** User interacts with the system to select a desired viewpoint within the captured volume.
*   **Ray Tracing:** The rendering engine traces rays from the viewpoint through the light field data to generate a realistic image.
*   **Stereoscopic or Holographic Display:** The rendered image is displayed on a stereoscopic display or holographic display for an immersive viewing experience.

**Pseudocode (Light Emission Control - CPU Side):**

```
// Assume 'cameras' is a list of camera objects
// Each camera object has methods: set_light_intensity(intensity), set_color_temp(temp), capture_image()

function control_light_emission(scene_geometry, material_properties, desired_exposure):
  for each camera in cameras:
    // Calculate optimal light intensity and color temperature based on
    // scene geometry, material properties, and desired exposure
    intensity = calculate_intensity(camera.position, scene_geometry, material_properties, desired_exposure)
    color_temp = calculate_color_temp(camera.position, scene_geometry, material_properties)

    camera.set_light_intensity(intensity)
    camera.set_color_temp(color_temp)
    camera.capture_image()
```

**Novelty:**  The focus on *dynamic* light field reconstruction driven by adaptive light emission sets this apart from existing multi-view stereo and light field capture techniques. The system isn’t just capturing static scenes, but creating a live, interactive volumetric experience. The coordinated light emission is critical for achieving high-quality results, especially in challenging lighting conditions.
