## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Ring

**Concept:** A wearable ring incorporating micro-actuators to provide localized haptic feedback correlated with call participant status and environmental audio cues, augmenting the light indicator system. This extends the notification system *beyond* visual cues, offering a more nuanced and private experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Lightweight, ergonomic ring constructed from biocompatible polymer or titanium alloy. Available in multiple sizes.
*   **Actuation:** Array of 6-8 miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) embedded within the ring band, capable of generating distinct vibration patterns.  Actuators positioned to maximize tactile perception on the finger.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Ambient Light Sensor:  Adjusts haptic intensity based on surrounding light levels.
    *   Microphone:  Captures environmental sounds to trigger specific haptic alerts.
    *   Proximity Sensor: Detects ring-to-body contact for auto-disable/enable.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection to the primary device (speaker/assistant).
*   **Power:**  Inductive charging. Battery life: 24 hours (typical use).
*   **Software Integration:**  API for integration with the voice assistant’s call management and audio processing systems.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Call Notification:**
    *   Incoming Call:  Distinct rhythmic pulse on the finger. Pattern differs based on caller profile (identified by the assistant).
    *   Call in Progress: Constant, low-intensity vibration.  Vibration intensity adjusts dynamically with speaker volume.
    *   Caller Identification:  Unique haptic “signature” for each registered caller, learned via user customization.  (e.g., a ‘buzz’ for family, a ‘tap’ for colleagues)
    *   Muted/Unmuted Status:  Sharp single ‘click’ vibration to indicate mute toggle.
2.  **Environmental Awareness:**
    *   Sound Event Detection:  Assistant analyzes ambient audio.
        *   Emergency Sirens: Rapid, escalating vibration pattern.
        *   Baby Crying/Dog Barking:  Distinct, attention-grabbing vibration.
        *   Doorbell: Unique vibration sequence.
    *   Directional Audio Alerts:  (Future development) – Attempt to translate directional audio cues (e.g., someone calling your name from the left) into localized haptic stimulation on the appropriate side of the finger.
3.  **Customization:**
    *   User-defined vibration patterns for different events and callers.
    *   Adjustable vibration intensity levels.
    *   Option to disable specific alerts.

**Pseudocode (Alert Generation):**

```
function generateAlert(eventType, callerProfile, environmentalData) {
  if (eventType == "incomingCall") {
    pattern = getCallerVibrationPattern(callerProfile);
    activateHapticEngine(pattern, intensity);
  } else if (eventType == "environmentalAlert") {
    if (environmentalData.type == "siren") {
      pattern = sirenVibrationPattern();
      activateHapticEngine(pattern, highIntensity);
    } else if (environmentalData.type == "babyCry") {
      pattern = babyCryVibrationPattern();
      activateHapticEngine(pattern, mediumIntensity);
    }
  } else if (eventType == "muteToggle") {
    activateHapticEngine(shortClickPattern(), lowIntensity);
  }
}

function getCallerVibrationPattern(callerProfile) {
  // Access caller profile database.
  // Return associated vibration pattern.
  // If no pattern exists, use default.
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Miniaturization of haptic actuators and power management circuitry.
*   Development of efficient algorithms for vibration pattern generation and control.
*   Biocompatibility and comfort of materials.
*   Robustness and water resistance.
