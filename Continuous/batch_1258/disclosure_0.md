## Adaptive Query Expansion via Simulated User Profiles

**Specification:** A system for proactively expanding user queries, particularly voice-initiated, by simulating diverse user profiles and predicting likely query refinements *before* the user completes their initial request. This differs from the patent's reactive affinity scoring by anticipating needs.

**Core Components:**

1.  **User Profile Database:** Stores simulated user profiles defined by:
    *   **Demographics:** Age, location, profession (used to establish baseline product interests).
    *   **Past Interaction History (Simulated):**  A randomly generated history of product views, purchases, and previously asked questions.  This history is probabilistic, weighted towards common user behaviors within the demographic.
    *   **Voiceprint/Accent Profile (Simulated):**  Variations in speech patterns (simulated, not requiring actual user data initially) impacting voice recognition accuracy.
    *   **Query Tendency:** A probabilistic model defining how a simulated user typically phrases requests (e.g., prefers detailed specifications vs. broad categories).

2.  **Query Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Initial Query Processing:** Receives the initial (potentially incomplete) voice input.
    *   **Profile Activation:** Selects a cohort of simulated user profiles based on keywords in the initial query (e.g., "running shoes" activates profiles with athletic interests).
    *   **Query Expansion Generation:**  For each activated profile, the engine generates a set of likely query refinements using the profile’s historical data and query tendency. This is achieved by:
        *   **Sequential Prediction:**  Predicting the most likely next words or phrases given the initial query and the profile's history using a language model (e.g., transformer-based).
        *   **Attribute Association:**  Identifying attributes frequently associated with the initial query within the profile’s history (e.g., if the profile often asks about “waterproof” features when querying outdoor gear, “waterproof” is added as a likely refinement).

3.  **Confidence Scoring:**
    *   Each generated refinement is assigned a confidence score based on:
        *   **Historical Frequency:** How often the refinement appeared in the profile’s history.
        *   **Language Model Probability:** The probability of the refinement given the initial query.
        *   **Community Data:** Aggregate data on frequently asked questions related to the initial query (providing a broader context).

4.  **Proactive UI Display:**
    *   The highest-confidence refinements are presented to the user *before* they finish speaking, as suggested completions in a visual interface or as spoken prompts (e.g., “Did you mean ‘waterproof running shoes’?”, “Are you interested in trail or road running shoes?”).
    *   The UI dynamically adapts based on user response. Acceptance of a refinement triggers the full query execution. Rejection signals the system to prioritize other refinements or request further clarification.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION PredictQueryRefinements(initialQuery, userProfiles):
    activeProfiles = SELECT userProfiles WHERE keywords(initialQuery) MATCH profileInterests
    refinements = []
    FOR profile IN activeProfiles:
        predictedWords = GENERATE(profile.history, initialQuery, languageModel)
        associatedAttributes = FIND(profile.history, initialQuery, attributeAssociations)
        refinements.EXTEND(predictedWords, associatedAttributes)
    scoredRefinements = SCORE(refinements, historicalFrequency, languageModelProbability, communityData)
    topRefinements = SELECT topN(scoredRefinements)
    RETURN topRefinements
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server for running language models and query prediction engine.
*   Large database for storing user profiles and historical data.
*   Voice recognition software for processing voice input.
*   UI framework for displaying suggested refinements.
