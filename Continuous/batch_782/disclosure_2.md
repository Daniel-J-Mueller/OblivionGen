## Adaptive Network Traffic Shaping via Predictive AI

**System Overview:**

This system aims to proactively shape network traffic based on predicted usage patterns, moving beyond reactive logging and analysis. It leverages AI to anticipate application needs and dynamically adjust network resources *before* congestion or performance degradation occurs.

**Core Components:**

1.  **AI Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical network traffic data (similar to the logs detailed in the provided patent, but used for prediction, not just analysis). It predicts future bandwidth requirements for each virtual computer system instance and its associated applications.  Features include:
    *   Time of day
    *   Day of week
    *   Application type (identified via deep packet inspection or behavioral analysis)
    *   User behavior profiles
    *   Real-time application performance metrics
2.  **Dynamic Traffic Shaper:** A software-defined networking (SDN) component that intercepts and manipulates network packets.  It receives instructions from the AI Prediction Engine.
3.  **Resource Allocation Manager:** Manages available network resources (bandwidth, QoS settings) and allocates them to virtual computer system instances based on the predictions and allocated budget.
4.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitors actual network performance and feeds the data back into the AI Prediction Engine to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (AI Prediction Engine - simplified):**

```
function predict_bandwidth(instance_id, current_time):
  historical_data = get_historical_data(instance_id)
  current_metrics = get_current_metrics(instance_id)
  
  //Feature engineering: combine historical data and current metrics
  features = create_features(historical_data, current_metrics, current_time)

  //Model prediction (e.g., using a time-series forecasting model)
  predicted_bandwidth = model.predict(features)

  return predicted_bandwidth

function create_features(historical_data, current_metrics, current_time):
    // Extract relevant features:
    time_of_day = current_time.hour
    day_of_week = current_time.weekday()
    average_historical_bandwidth = calculate_average_bandwidth(historical_data)
    peak_historical_bandwidth = find_peak_bandwidth(historical_data)
    current_cpu_usage = current_metrics.cpu_usage
    // ... other relevant features

    // Combine features into a vector
    feature_vector = [time_of_day, day_of_week, average_historical_bandwidth, peak_historical_bandwidth, current_cpu_usage, ...]
    return feature_vector
```

**Workflow:**

1.  The AI Prediction Engine continuously analyzes historical data and real-time metrics to predict future bandwidth requirements for each virtual computer system instance.
2.  The prediction results are sent to the Dynamic Traffic Shaper.
3.  The Dynamic Traffic Shaper proactively adjusts network resources (bandwidth allocation, QoS settings) to meet the predicted demands. This might involve:
    *   Prioritizing traffic from critical applications.
    *   Limiting bandwidth for non-critical applications.
    *   Allocating additional bandwidth to instances that are expected to experience high traffic.
4.  The Resource Allocation Manager manages the overall allocation of network resources to ensure that all instances have sufficient bandwidth.
5.  The Feedback Loop monitors actual network performance and feeds the data back into the AI Prediction Engine to improve its accuracy.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced network congestion.
*   Improved application performance.
*   Enhanced user experience.
*   Proactive resource allocation.
*   Optimized network utilization.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers to run the AI Prediction Engine and Dynamic Traffic Shaper.
*   Network infrastructure with support for SDN and QoS.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   SDN controller.
*   Network monitoring tools.
*   Custom software to integrate the different components.
