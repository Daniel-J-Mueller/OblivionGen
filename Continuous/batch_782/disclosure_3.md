## Dynamic Schema Sharding & Federated Access

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical data structure concept to a multi-directory/multi-provider environment via schema sharding and federated access control. Instead of extensions being limited to a single directory service, allow schema extensions to be distributed *across* multiple directory services, effectively creating a sharded schema.  This allows for modularity, scalability, and a more distributed ownership model for data definitions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Schema Sharding Protocol:**

*   **Shard Keys:** Define a mechanism for identifying schema shards. Shard keys are globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) associated with each schema extension.
*   **Shard Registration:** A central "Schema Registry" service (independent of the directory services) maintains a mapping of shard keys to the directory service hosting the corresponding schema extension.  This registry is accessible via a standardized API.
*   **Schema Resolution:** When an application requests access to an object, the directory service consults the Schema Registry. If the required schema extension resides in another directory service, the request is *federated* â€“ forwarded to the hosting directory service.

**2. Federated Access Control:**

*   **Cross-Service Authentication:** Implement a standardized authentication/authorization protocol (e.g., OAuth 2.0 with claims-based authorization) to securely pass user credentials across directory services.
*   **Policy Propagation:** Define a mechanism for propagating access control policies across shards. This could involve a central policy engine or a distributed policy enforcement system. Policies are attached to shard keys.
*   **Delegated Authorization:**  Allow directory services to delegate authorization decisions to other services (e.g., a dedicated authorization service).

**3. API Specifications:**

*   `SchemaRegistry.RegisterShard(shardKey, directoryServiceAddress)`: Registers a schema shard with the Schema Registry.
*   `SchemaRegistry.ResolveShard(shardKey)`:  Returns the address of the directory service hosting the specified shard.
*   `DirectoryService.FederateRequest(userCredentials, shardKey, accessRequest)`: Forwards an access request to another directory service.
*   `AuthorizationService.EvaluatePolicy(userCredentials, shardKey, accessRequest)`: Evaluates an access control policy.

**Pseudocode (Access Flow):**

```
function AccessObject(userCredentials, objectID):
  directoryService = LocalDirectoryService()
  shardKeys = directoryService.GetObjectShardKeys(objectID)

  for shardKey in shardKeys:
    shardLocation = SchemaRegistry.ResolveShard(shardKey)
    if shardLocation != LocalDirectoryServiceAddress:
      federatedResponse = shardLocation.FederateRequest(userCredentials, shardKey, accessRequest)
      // Process federated response
    else:
      // Process local request
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Use a consistent data format for schema extensions (e.g., JSON Schema, Protocol Buffers).
*   Implement robust error handling and fault tolerance.
*   Consider using a caching layer to reduce latency.
*   Security is paramount. Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
