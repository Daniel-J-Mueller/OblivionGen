## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Intent Prediction

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the multi-device speech input concept by introducing dynamically adjustable acoustic zones coupled with predictive intent modeling. The goal is to enhance speech recognition accuracy and anticipate user needs *before* full utterance completion, minimizing latency and maximizing responsiveness. It moves beyond simply *receiving* audio from multiple sources to *actively shaping* the audio environment and proactively interpreting potential commands.

**Hardware Components:**

1.  **Base Unit:** Equipped with a far-field microphone array (minimum 8 elements) and directional speaker array. Includes a processing unit capable of real-time audio beamforming, noise cancellation, and intent prediction model execution.
2.  **Handheld Remote:** Maintains existing microphone and talk button functionality. Incorporates a miniature inertial measurement unit (IMU) - accelerometer & gyroscope.
3.  **Environmental Sensors (Optional):** Networked sensors (temperature, humidity, ambient noise) integrated into the room environment, feeding data into the system.
4.  **Zone Control (Optional):** Integration with smart home/building automation to dynamically adjust room acoustics (e.g., closing/opening drapes, adjusting HVAC).

**Software Components:**

1.  **Acoustic Zone Manager:**
    *   **Dynamic Beamforming:** Real-time adjustment of microphone beam patterns based on detected audio source (base unit/remote) and user location (estimated via IMU data & potential visual input – camera optional). The system prioritizes the dominant speech source.
    *   **Acoustic Shadowing:**  Minor directional sound output from the base unit’s speaker array to selectively attenuate noise originating from specific directions (e.g. a TV) or to create a quiet zone around the user.
    *   **Zone Prioritization:** If multiple speakers are detected, algorithm determines which voice to focus on. This can be based on user profiles or contextual cues.
2.  **Intent Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Partial Utterance Analysis:**  Leverages a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a vast corpus of speech data.  RNN analyzes partial utterances in real-time to predict potential user intents.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:**  Integrates data from environmental sensors, user profiles, historical interactions, and external sources (e.g., calendar, news) to refine intent predictions.
    *   **Proactive Response Generation:** Based on high-confidence intent predictions, the system preemptively prepares relevant information or actions (e.g., displays a list of potential options on a screen, initiates a search query).
3.  **Adaptive Learning Module:**
    *   Continuously refines acoustic models, intent prediction models, and system parameters based on user feedback and observed interactions.
    *   Personalizes the system to individual user’s voice characteristics, speech patterns, and preferences.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction Engine):**

```
FUNCTION predict_intent(audio_signal, user_profile, context_data):
  // Extract acoustic features from audio_signal
  features = extract_features(audio_signal)

  // Combine features with user profile and context data
  combined_input = concatenate(features, user_profile, context_data)

  // Pass combined input through RNN
  output = RNN(combined_input)

  // Normalize output probabilities
  probabilities = softmax(output)

  // Select top N intents with highest probabilities
  top_intents = select_top_n(probabilities, N=3)

  RETURN top_intents
```

**Operational Scenario:**

User is holding the remote, watching TV. They start to say "Dim the…".  The remote’s IMU detects motion associated with speech, and the system begins processing audio.  The Intent Prediction Engine predicts “lights” with a high probability, based on the partial utterance and user’s historical lighting control interactions. The system *preemptively* displays lighting control options on a screen and prepares to execute the command. The user completes the utterance "Dim the lights". The system instantly executes the command, without waiting for the full utterance to complete.
