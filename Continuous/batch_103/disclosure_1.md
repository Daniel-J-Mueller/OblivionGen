## Personalized Environmental Storytelling

**Concept:** Extend environmental control beyond simple parameter adjustments to create dynamically shifting, immersive "environmental stories" synchronized with augmented reality experiences and/or biometric data. This isn’t about *comfort* – it’s about *narrative*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core System - "Atmosphere Weaver"**

*   **Input:**
    *   AR System Data: Position, orientation, and content being displayed within the augmented reality environment.
    *   Biometric Sensors: Heart rate, skin conductance, EEG (optional), body temperature.
    *   User Voice Input:  Keywords, phrases, and emotional tone analysis.
    *   External Data:  Time of day, weather (location-based).
*   **Processing:**
    *   "Story Engine": A rules-based and AI-driven system that interprets incoming data and maps it to pre-defined or dynamically generated environmental "scenes."  Scenes are composed of combinations of environmental parameters (temperature, humidity, airflow, lighting, scent, subtle vibrations).  Examples:
        *   "Rainforest Trek": Increased humidity, warmer temperature, subtle fan variations to simulate breezes, rainforest soundscape.
        *   "Arctic Exploration": Decreased temperature, cold air flow, dim blue lighting, simulated wind noises.
        *   "Cozy Fireplace": Warm temperature, gentle airflow, flickering orange/red light, crackling fire soundscape.
    *   Biometric Feedback Loop:  Environmental parameters are *dynamically adjusted* based on the user's biometric response. If the user's heart rate increases during a "horror" scene, the temperature might decrease slightly and airflow intensify.
    *   AR Synchronization:  Environmental changes are precisely timed and synchronized with events happening in the augmented reality experience. (e.g., a virtual explosion is accompanied by a burst of warm air and flickering light).
*   **Output:**
    *   Control Signals: Sent to secondary devices (temperature regulators, humidifiers, fans, lighting systems, scent diffusers, haptic feedback devices).
    *   Audio Output: Dynamically generated soundscapes synchronized with environmental changes.

**2.  "Mood Palette" - User Customization & Creation**

*   Users can define their own environmental "moods" or scenes. This isn't a simple parameter preset, but a "storyboard" where they define how environmental changes should respond to specific AR events or biometric triggers.
*   A visual editor allows users to drag-and-drop environmental parameters, define trigger conditions (e.g., "When the virtual dragon breathes fire..."), and set the intensity/duration of the environmental response.
*   A “share” function allows users to share their custom moods with others.

**3.  "Environmental AI" - Dynamic Scene Generation**

*   AI learns the user's preferences and generates new environmental scenes on the fly based on their activity and biometric data.
*   AI analyzes user voice tone to determine their emotional state, and adjusts the environmental atmosphere accordingly (e.g., calming scents and cool air if the user sounds stressed).
*   AI can generate "surprise" environmental events to enhance immersion (e.g., a sudden gust of wind when encountering a virtual creature).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  arData = getARData();
  biometricData = getBiometricData();
  voiceData = getVoiceData();

  scene = determineScene(arData, biometricData, voiceData); // AI or rule-based

  // Adjust environmental parameters
  temperature = scene.temperature;
  humidity = scene.humidity;
  airflow = scene.airflow;
  lighting = scene.lighting;
  scent = scene.scent;

  setEnvironmentalParameters(temperature, humidity, airflow, lighting, scent);

  playAudio(scene.soundscape);
}
```

**Hardware Requirements (Beyond existing patent):**

*   Advanced Scent Diffuser: Capable of rapidly switching between multiple scents.
*   Haptic Feedback System: Subtle vibration devices integrated into chairs or clothing.
*   Micro-climate control system: localized environmental control around the user.
*   High fidelity microphone array for accurate voice analysis.
