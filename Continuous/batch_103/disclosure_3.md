## Dynamic Key Rotation Based on Usage Entropy

**Concept:** Extend the uniqueness constraint monitoring to *proactively* rotate cryptographic keys based on the entropy of their usage patterns, rather than reacting to constraint violations. This aims to minimize the window of opportunity for exploitation *before* a violation even occurs, and adapt to evolving threat landscapes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Entropy Monitoring Module:**

   *   **Input:** Stream of digital signature metadata (key ID, timestamp, associated data hash, potentially geographic location of signing device).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Maintain a sliding window of signature events for each key.
        *   Calculate Shannon entropy of the associated data hashes within the window. Higher entropy indicates more diverse usage (good). Lower entropy suggests potential predictability/attack vector.
        *   Calculate a 'usage diversity score' combining data entropy with temporal diversity (are signatures clustered in time, indicating automated attacks?).
        *   Define configurable thresholds for 'low usage diversity' per key.
   *   **Output:**  Usage Diversity Score, Alert signal if score falls below threshold.

**2. Dynamic Key Rotation Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Alert signal from Entropy Monitoring Module, Key ID, current Key Rotation Policy (defined by administrators - e.g., rotation interval, allowed downtime, key derivation algorithm).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Upon receiving a 'low usage diversity' alert:
            *   Initiate key rotation process for the identified key.
            *   Derive a new key pair using a deterministic key derivation function (e.g., HKDF) seeded with the existing key and a unique, cryptographically random nonce. This allows for auditability and potential key recovery.
            *   Gracefully transition to the new key pair. This may involve:
                *   Publishing a certificate revocation list (CRL) for the old key.
                *   Using a short-lived grace period where both old and new keys are accepted.
                *   Providing mechanisms for signing devices to seamlessly update to the new key.
        *   Maintain a log of all key rotations, including the reason for rotation (low entropy), the time of rotation, and the keys involved.
   *   **Output:** New Key Pair, CRL update, Rotation Log entry.

**3.  Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**

   *   **Process:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., a reinforcement learning agent) that dynamically adjusts the entropy thresholds based on observed attack patterns and system performance. 
   *   **Input:** Historical usage data, attack logs, system performance metrics (e.g., signature verification latency).
   *   **Output:** Updated entropy thresholds for each key or key group.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation Engine):**

```
function rotate_key(key_id, reason):
  new_key_pair = derive_new_key(key_id)
  publish_crl(old_key_id)
  set_grace_period(duration)
  update_signing_devices(new_public_key)
  log_rotation(key_id, reason, new_key_pair)
  return new_key_pair

function derive_new_key(key_id):
  nonce = generate_random_nonce()
  seed = hash(old_key_id + nonce)
  new_key_pair = HKDF(seed, "KeyDerivationAlgorithm")
  return new_key_pair

function monitor_entropy(signature_data):
  data_hashes = extract_hashes(signature_data)
  entropy = calculate_shannon_entropy(data_hashes)
  diversity_score = calculate_diversity_score(entropy, timestamp_distribution)
  if diversity_score < threshold:
    trigger_key_rotation(key_id, "Low Usage Entropy")

```

**Novelty:** This extends the reactive uniqueness checking to a proactive, adaptive security posture. By monitoring usage entropy, the system anticipates potential vulnerabilities *before* a violation occurs, and automatically rotates keys to minimize the attack surface. The integration of machine learning allows the system to adapt to evolving threat landscapes and optimize key rotation frequency.
