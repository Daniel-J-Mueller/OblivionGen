## Dynamic Ambiance Sculpting with Predictive Device Grouping

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic device grouping concept to proactively *shape* a user’s environment through synchronized audio, visual, and haptic feedback, anticipating needs based on contextual data and learned preferences.  This isn’t just about controlling existing output, but creating a *predictive* and layered ambiance.

**Core Innovation:** Predictive Device Grouping & Ambiance Layering.  The system identifies a "comfort zone" based on a user’s habits (time of day, location, activity, current media consumption) and *pre-positions* devices to deliver a subtly evolving, multi-sensory experience *before* the user explicitly requests it.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Sensory Device Inventory:**  The system manages a database of connected devices categorized by sensory output type (audio – speakers, headphones; visual – displays, smart lighting; haptic – smart fabrics, localized temperature control, wearable vibration devices).  Each device has an associated “influence radius” defining its effective area of impact.
*   **Contextual Data Inputs:**
    *   **Real-time Data:** Location (GPS, Bluetooth beacons), time of day, activity (accelerometer, microphone analysis), ambient sound levels, current weather.
    *   **Learned Preferences:** User profiles tracking preferred ambiance settings for different contexts (e.g., “relaxing evening” = low lighting, ambient music, gentle warmth; “focused work” = bright, cool lighting, white noise).  Machine learning algorithms continuously refine these preferences.
    *   **Calendar Integration:**  Access to user’s calendar to anticipate upcoming events (meetings, appointments) and prepare the environment accordingly.
*   **Predictive Engine:** 
    *   **Comfort Zone Mapping:** Based on contextual data and learned preferences, the system generates a "comfort zone" map defining the desired ambiance characteristics for the user’s current environment.
    *   **Device Group Formation:** Dynamically forms device groups based on device capabilities, proximity to the user, and influence radius. Prioritizes devices that can contribute to the desired ambiance characteristics.
    *   **Ambiance Layering:** Creates “layers” of sensory output to achieve a nuanced and immersive experience. Example layers:
        *   *Base Layer:*  Subtle ambient sounds and background lighting creating a general mood.
        *   *Content Layer:*  Audio and visual output directly related to the user’s current media consumption.
        *   *Adaptive Layer:*  Dynamically adjusts lighting and sound levels based on ambient noise and user activity.
        *   *Haptic Layer:*  Provides subtle tactile feedback (e.g., gentle warmth, localized vibration) to enhance immersion.
*   **Command Structure:**
    *   `CREATE_AMBIENCE_LAYER(layer_id, layer_type, parameters)`: Creates a new ambiance layer with specified characteristics.
    *   `ASSIGN_DEVICE_TO_LAYER(device_id, layer_id)`: Assigns a device to a specific ambiance layer.
    *   `ADJUST_LAYER_PARAMETERS(layer_id, parameters)`: Modifies the characteristics of an existing ambiance layer.
    *   `BLEND_LAYERS(layer_ids, blend_factor)`:  Combines multiple ambiance layers with specified blend factor.
    *   `PREDICTIVE_AMBIENCE(context_data)`:  Initiates a predictive ambiance sequence based on provided context data.
*   **Pseudocode – Predictive Ambiance Sequence:**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION PredictiveAmbiance(contextData)
  // 1. Analyze Context Data
  userLocation = contextData.location
  currentTime = contextData.time
  userActivity = contextData.activity
  calendarEvents = contextData.calendarEvents

  // 2. Determine Preferred Ambiance Profile
  ambianceProfile = GetAmbianceProfile(userLocation, currentTime, userActivity, calendarEvents)

  // 3. Form Device Group
  deviceGroup = FormDeviceGroup(ambianceProfile.devicesNeeded, userLocation)

  // 4. Create Ambiance Layers
  baseLayer = CREATE_AMBIENCE_LAYER(1, "base", ambianceProfile.baseSettings)
  contentLayer = CREATE_AMBIENCE_LAYER(2, "content", {}) //Initialise. Content will be driven by media
  adaptiveLayer = CREATE_AMBIENCE_LAYER(3, "adaptive", ambianceProfile.adaptiveSettings)

  // 5. Assign Devices to Layers
  FOR device IN deviceGroup
      IF device.type == "speaker"
          ASSIGN_DEVICE_TO_LAYER(device.id, 1)  //Base Layer
          ASSIGN_DEVICE_TO_LAYER(device.id, 2) //Content Layer
      ELSE IF device.type == "light"
          ASSIGN_DEVICE_TO_LAYER(device.id, 1) //Base Layer
      ELSE IF device.type == "haptic"
          ASSIGN_DEVICE_TO_LAYER(device.id, 1) //Base Layer
      ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  // 6. Blend Layers
  BLEND_LAYERS([1, 2, 3], 0.7) //Prioritize layering.

  // 7. Continuously Monitor and Adjust (Adaptive Layer)
  LOOP
      ambientNoise = GetAmbientNoiseLevel()
      adaptiveSettings = AdjustAdaptiveSettings(ambientNoise)
      ADJUST_LAYER_PARAMETERS(3, adaptiveSettings)
      DELAY(5) //Check every 5 seconds
  ENDLOOP
ENDFUNCTION
```

This allows for a more proactive and immersive experience, moving beyond simply responding to user input to anticipating needs and shaping the environment accordingly.
