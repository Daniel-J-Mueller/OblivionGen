## Dynamic Voltage Allocation & Predictive Failure Mitigation – Multi-Tiered Storage

**Concept:** Expand upon the series-connected DC power delivery by introducing tiered voltage allocation *and* predictive failure analysis integrated with dynamic power reallocation. Instead of a fixed series connection, implement a dynamically reconfigurable network of storage devices, each with individual DC-DC converters. This allows for granular voltage control *and* proactive mitigation of device failures.

**Specifications:**

*   **Network Topology:** Storage devices are arranged in a mesh-like network, interconnected via DC power lines and a dedicated communication bus (PCIe Gen 5 preferred). This is *not* a strict series configuration.
*   **DC-DC Conversion:** Each storage device possesses a highly efficient DC-DC converter capable of accepting a wide range of input voltages (240V-400V as per patent) and outputting a precisely regulated voltage suitable for the SSD/storage controller.
*   **Centralized Power Management Unit (PMU):** A dedicated PMU governs the entire system. This unit monitors voltage, current, temperature, and performance metrics from each device in real-time.  The PMU utilizes advanced machine learning algorithms to predict potential failures *before* they occur.
*   **Predictive Failure Analysis:**  The ML models in the PMU analyze historical data, current operating conditions, and predicted wear levels (based on TBW – Terabytes Written – tracking) to identify devices at risk of failure.  Critical parameters: temperature gradients, read/write error rates, voltage/current fluctuations.
*   **Dynamic Voltage Allocation:**  The PMU dynamically adjusts the voltage supplied to each device based on workload demands and predicted health.  Healthy devices performing intensive workloads receive slightly higher voltages for optimal performance. Devices nearing failure receive reduced voltages to minimize stress and extend lifespan (sacrificing some performance).
*   **Automated Load Shifting:**  If a device is predicted to fail imminently, the PMU automatically migrates all data from that device to healthy devices *before* the failure occurs. This happens transparently to the user.
*   **Redundant Power Paths:** Each storage device will have at least two independent DC power input paths, fed from different points in the network. This ensures continued operation even if one power line fails.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A dedicated, low-latency communication protocol (based on PCIe Gen 5) enables the PMU to communicate with each device and monitor its status in real-time.
*   **Data Integrity Verification:**  After a load shift, a comprehensive data integrity verification process is initiated to ensure that all data has been migrated correctly.  This includes checksum validation and error correction.
*   **Power Supply Scalability:** The power supply will be modular and scalable, allowing for easy addition or replacement of power modules as needed.

**Pseudocode (PMU – simplified):**

```
// Monitoring loop
while (true) {
  for each device in network {
    get device status (voltage, current, temperature, errors, TBW)
    update health score based on status
    predict potential failure using ML model
    if (failure predicted) {
      initiate data migration to healthy device
      reduce voltage to failing device
      log failure event
    }
    if (device workload high) {
      increase voltage (within safe limits)
    }
  }
  sleep(10ms)
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly improved system reliability and data integrity.
*   Proactive failure mitigation reduces downtime and data loss.
*   Optimized power consumption through dynamic voltage allocation.
*   Increased lifespan of storage devices.
*   Scalable architecture supports large storage capacities.
