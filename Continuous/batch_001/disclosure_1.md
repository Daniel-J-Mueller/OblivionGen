## Dynamic IP Address Space Sharding & Migration

**Concept:** Extend the ability to add/remove IP address spaces to a virtual network by implementing a dynamic sharding and migration system. Instead of treating IP address spaces as monolithic blocks, divide them into smaller, manageable shards. These shards can be independently migrated between virtual networks or even provisioned/de-provisioned on-demand.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shard Size:** Configurable, default 1024 IP addresses (e.g., /23 subnet).  Minimum: /28. Maximum: /20.
*   **Shard Metadata:** Each shard will have associated metadata:
    *   `Network ID`: The Virtual Private Network it currently resides within.
    *   `Status`:  `Available`, `In-Use`, `Migrating`, `Reserved`.
    *   `Resource Count`:  Number of VMs currently using IPs within this shard.
    *   `Last Accessed`: Timestamp of last IP allocation/deallocation.
*   **Shard Manager Service:**  A centralized service responsible for:
    *   Shard creation & deletion.
    *   Shard allocation to Virtual Private Networks.
    *   Tracking shard metadata.
    *   Enforcing shard policies (e.g., maximum shard count per network).
*   **Migration Process:**  When a shard needs to be moved:
    1.  Mark shard as `Migrating`.
    2.  Stop new IP allocations from the shard.
    3.  For each VM using an IP in the shard:
        *   Initiate a temporary network interface shutdown.
        *   Assign a new IP address from a different available shard.
        *   Restart the network interface.
    4.  Once all VMs have migrated, update shard metadata with the new `Network ID`.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /shards`:  Create a new shard (specify size and initial network).
    *   `DELETE /shards/{shard_id}`: Delete a shard (check `Resource Count` == 0).
    *   `GET /shards/{shard_id}`:  Retrieve shard metadata.
    *   `POST /networks/{network_id}/shards/{shard_id}`:  Allocate a shard to a network.
    *   `DELETE /networks/{network_id}/shards/{shard_id}`:  Deallocate a shard from a network (initiates migration if in use).
*   **Eventing:**  The Shard Manager will emit events for shard creation, deletion, allocation, deallocation, and migration completion.  These events can be consumed by other services for monitoring and automation.
*   **Control Plane Integration:**  The existing control plane will be modified to interact with the Shard Manager when adding/removing IP address spaces to a Virtual Private Network.
*   **Pseudocode (Deallocate Shard):**

```
function deallocateShard(networkId, shardId):
  shard = ShardManager.getShard(shardId)
  if shard.ResourceCount > 0:
    // Initiate VM migration process
    migrationTasks = []
    for vm in getVMsUsingShard(shardId):
      migrationTasks.add(migrateVM(vm, shardId))
    waitForAllTasksComplete(migrationTasks)
  shard.NetworkID = null
  shard.Status = "Available"
  emitEvent("shard.deallocated", {shardId: shardId, networkId: networkId})
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Granular Scalability:** Enables more precise allocation of IP addresses, reducing waste.
*   **Faster Provisioning:**  New networks can be provisioned more quickly by allocating pre-existing shards.
*   **Improved Resource Utilization:**  Allows for dynamic redistribution of IP addresses based on demand.
*   **Reduced Network Disruption:** Migration process minimizes downtime for VMs.
