## Adaptive Multi-Channel Presence & Intent Routing

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple agent availability to a proactive, predictive system that anticipates user needs *before* a contact request is even initiated, and dynamically adjusts communication channels based on real-time context and user preference learning.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Ingestion:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate data from multiple sources:
    *   User’s current application/website activity (screen scraping, event tracking).
    *   Geolocation (with user permission).
    *   Device type & operating system.
    *   Historical interaction data (CRM, contact history).
    *   Real-time system monitoring (detecting errors or outages the user may be experiencing).
    *   Sentiment analysis of user-generated content (social media, forums, reviews – if linked/permitted).
*   **Data Processing:** Employ a machine learning model to analyze ingested data and identify:
    *   User's *intent* (e.g., troubleshooting, purchase assistance, information request).
    *   User's *emotional state* (e.g., frustration, urgency, satisfaction).
    *   User's *preferred communication channels* (learned over time).
    *   *Potential issues* before the user reports them.

**2. Predictive Contact Initiation:**

*   **Proactive Triggers:** Based on contextual analysis, initiate contact *before* the user explicitly requests it. Examples:
    *   Detecting a user repeatedly attempting a failed transaction -> automatically offer assistance via chat.
    *   Identifying a user navigating a complex help article -> proactively offer a screen-sharing session.
    *   Detecting a service outage affecting the user's location -> automatically notify them via SMS.
*   **Contact Preferences:** Prioritize communication channels based on:
    *   User's historical preferences.
    *   User's current context (e.g., mobile user -> SMS or in-app messaging).
    *   Severity of the issue (e.g., critical error -> phone call).

**3. Dynamic Channel Adjustment:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the communication channel's effectiveness:
    *   Chat response times.
    *   Call quality.
    *   User feedback (e.g., thumbs up/down).
*   **Automated Switching:**  If the current channel is ineffective or the user expresses dissatisfaction, automatically switch to a different channel:
    *   Slow chat response -> escalate to a phone call.
    *   Poor call quality -> switch to video chat.
    *   User requests a different channel -> honor the request immediately.
*   **Channel Blending:**  Support seamless transitions between channels during a single interaction:
    *   Start with chat for initial troubleshooting, then switch to screen sharing for a more detailed explanation.
    *   Use SMS for quick updates and confirmations, then switch to a phone call for complex discussions.

**4. Agent-Side Integration:**

*   **Unified Agent Interface:** Display all relevant contextual data and communication channels within a single agent interface.
*   **Automated Routing:** Route contacts to the most appropriate agent based on:
    *   Agent skills and expertise.
    *   Agent availability.
    *   User's intent and emotional state.
*   **AI-Powered Assistance:** Provide agents with real-time suggestions and resources based on the user's context and conversation history.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function handle_user_interaction(user_id):
    user_context = get_user_context(user_id)
    user_intent = analyze_user_intent(user_context)
    preferred_channel = get_preferred_channel(user_id, user_context)

    if proactive_contact_needed(user_context, user_intent):
        initiate_contact(user_id, preferred_channel, "Proactive Assistance")

    while interaction_in_progress:
        message = receive_message(user_id)
        response = generate_response(message, user_context)
        send_message(user_id, response, preferred_channel)

        channel_quality = monitor_channel_quality(preferred_channel)
        if channel_quality < threshold:
            new_channel = select_alternative_channel(user_context)
            switch_to_channel(new_channel)
            preferred_channel = new_channel
```
