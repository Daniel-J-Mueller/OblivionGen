## Dynamic Outfit Generation with Procedural Texture Application

**Concept:** Extend the outfit recommendation system to *generate* outfits â€“ not just recommend existing ones. Combine this with procedural texture application to create visually unique outfits even from basic models.

**Specs:**

1.  **Outfit Graph Database:**  A graph database storing clothing item *components* (sleeves, collars, pant legs, skirt panels, etc.) rather than full items.  Each component has associated:
    *   3D base mesh.
    *   Material parameter ranges (color, texture scale, roughness, metallic).
    *   Connection points (where it can attach to other components).
    *   Style tags (e.g., "formal", "casual", "bohemian").

2.  **Outfit Assembly Engine:** 
    *   Takes a user-defined style profile (expressed as weighted style tags) as input.
    *   Uses a graph traversal algorithm to assemble an outfit by:
        *   Selecting a core item (e.g., a shirt).
        *   Finding compatible components (sleeves, collars) based on connection points and style tags.  Compatibility is scored and ranked.
        *   Iteratively adding layers (jacket, accessories) to complete the outfit.
        *   Randomness is introduced with weighted probabilities to create diverse outfits even with the same style profile.

3.  **Procedural Texture Generator:**
    *   For each component in the assembled outfit:
        *   Generate a procedural texture based on material parameter ranges defined for that component.  Parameters can include:
            *   Base color (randomly selected within a range).
            *   Texture pattern (e.g., stripes, polka dots, floral) with adjustable scale, density, and color.
            *   Roughness and metallic properties.
            *   Fabric-like details (e.g., weave patterns, stitching)
        *   Apply the generated texture to the 3D mesh of the component.

4.  **State Vector Integration:** Incorporate the existing state vector system.  The state vector represents the user's past preferences. Instead of recommending *from* existing items, the system *adjusts* the procedural texture generation to favor colors, patterns, and styles reflected in the state vector. For example:

```pseudocode
function generate_texture(component, state_vector):
    base_color = random_color_in_range(component.color_range)
    
    // Influence base color with state vector.
    color_influence = dot_product(state_vector.color_preference, component.color_range)
    adjusted_color = base_color + color_influence
    
    // Adjust texture parameters based on state vector
    pattern_scale = state_vector.pattern_preference * component.pattern_scale_range
    
    return texture(adjusted_color, pattern_scale)
```

5.  **Rendering Pipeline:** A real-time rendering pipeline that can handle dynamic texture generation and rendering of assembled outfits.

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond recommendation to *creation*.  Procedural textures provide infinite visual variety. Integration with the state vector personalizes the generated outfits. This allows for outfits that are truly unique to each user, while still aligning with their preferences.
