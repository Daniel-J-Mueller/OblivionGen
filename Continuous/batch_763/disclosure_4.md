## Adaptive Network Slicing via Predictive Congestion

**Concept:** Extend the centralized RRM to dynamically slice the wireless mesh network based on *predicted* congestion, not just reactive adjustments. This goes beyond channel assignment and introduces a form of ‘virtual network’ creation tailored to application needs and anticipated load.

**Specs:**

**1. Predictive Congestion Engine (PCE):**

*   **Input:** Historical network data (from time-series databases as described in the patent - RSSI, channel load, PER, FER, airtime, etc.), real-time network metrics, application profiles (QoS requirements - bandwidth, latency, jitter), and external event data (e.g., scheduled events, known user density fluctuations).
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network, Prophet) trained on historical data.  The model predicts congestion levels for each network segment (defined by clusters of mesh nodes) over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 5-30 minutes). Account for seasonality, trends, and external event impacts.
*   **Output:**  A congestion prediction map, detailing anticipated congestion levels for each network segment and associated confidence intervals.

**2. Dynamic Network Slice Manager (DNSM):**

*   **Input:** Congestion prediction map from PCE, application profiles, available network resources (channels, bandwidth, node capacity).
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   Define network slice templates based on application requirements (e.g., high bandwidth/low latency for VR, best effort for background data).
    *   Based on the congestion prediction map, dynamically allocate network slices to network segments. Prioritize slices based on application priority and anticipated congestion.
    *   Utilize a resource allocation algorithm (e.g., auction-based, proportional fairness) to allocate channels and bandwidth to each slice.  The goal is to minimize interference and maximize overall network throughput.
    *   Implement a ‘slice steering’ mechanism to dynamically route traffic through the optimal slice based on real-time conditions.
*   **Output:** Slice configuration parameters (channel assignments, bandwidth allocation, routing rules) for each network segment.

**3. Enhanced Controller Device Functionality:**

*   Integrate PCE and DNSM into the existing controller device.
*   Extend the channel assignment algorithm to consider slice membership when assigning channels.
*   Implement a slice monitoring module to track slice performance (throughput, latency, jitter) and provide feedback to the DNSM.
*   Develop a slice handover mechanism to seamlessly migrate traffic between slices if congestion patterns change.

**Pseudocode (DNSM Slice Allocation):**

```pseudocode
// Input: Congestion Prediction Map, Application Profiles, Available Resources
// Output: Slice Configuration Parameters

for each Network Segment:
  // Determine Application Demand
  application_demand = get_application_demand(Network Segment)

  // Select Optimal Slice Template
  slice_template = select_slice_template(application_demand)

  // Calculate Resource Requirements
  resource_requirements = calculate_resource_requirements(slice_template, application_demand)

  // Check Resource Availability
  if resource_available(resource_requirements):
    // Allocate Resources
    allocate_resources(resource_requirements, Network Segment)
    // Configure Network Segment with Slice Parameters
    configure_network_segment(Network Segment, slice_parameters)
  else:
    // Resource contention – prioritize or degrade service
    handle_resource_contention(Network Segment)
```

**Novelty:** This extends the proactive channel assignment of the patent to a full network slicing paradigm, driven by predictive congestion analysis.  It moves beyond simply optimizing channel usage to creating dynamically adaptable ‘virtual networks’ tailored to application needs, significantly improving network efficiency and user experience. The use of time-series forecasting to *predict* congestion is a key differentiator.
