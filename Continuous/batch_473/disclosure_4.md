## Aerial Swarm Acoustic Mapping & Localization – “EchoNet”

**System Overview:** A distributed system utilizing synchronized, low-frequency acoustic pings from a swarm of UAVs to create real-time 3D maps of enclosed or obscured environments, and simultaneously localize each UAV within that map. This goes beyond simple time-of-flight; it’s about building a dynamic acoustic ‘point cloud’ akin to LiDAR, but using sound.

**Core Components:**

*   **UAV Node:** Each UAV incorporates:
    *   Low-Frequency Transducer Array: Optimized for transmitting and receiving frequencies between 20Hz – 2kHz (penetrates foliage, structures).
    *   High-Precision Clock: Synchronized via GPS *and* inter-UAV communication (see Synchronization Protocol below). Crucially, clock drift must be minimized.
    *   MEMS Microphone Array: For receiving pings from other UAVs and reflections off the environment.
    *   Edge Computing Unit: Processes acoustic data, estimates Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA), and performs initial localization calculations.
    *   Radio Communication: For inter-UAV synchronization and data exchange.
*   **Ground Station:** Receives processed data from the UAV swarm. Runs a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm to construct a global 3D map.  Provides mission planning and control.

**Synchronization Protocol:**

1.  **GPS Initial Sync:** Each UAV obtains a precise time from GPS.
2.  **Inter-UAV Pinging:** UAVs periodically transmit short ‘synchronization’ pings to neighboring UAVs.
3.  **TDoA Calculation:** Receiving UAVs calculate the TDoA of the synchronization ping.
4.  **Clock Drift Correction:** Using TDoA and known inter-UAV distances (estimated via radio triangulation), UAVs correct their local clock drift.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Steps 3 & 4 are repeated continuously to maintain clock synchronization.  Kalman filtering is applied to reduce noise.

**Mapping and Localization Algorithm:**

1.  **Ping Schedule:** UAVs transmit ‘mapping’ pings on a pre-defined schedule, ensuring sufficient coverage of the target area.
2.  **TDoA Measurement:** Each UAV measures the TDoA of pings received from *all* other UAVs.
3.  **Geometric Localization:** Using TDoA measurements and known (or estimated) positions of transmitting UAVs, the receiving UAV calculates its own position. This is a multi-lateration problem.
4.  **SLAM Integration:** The Ground Station receives position estimates from all UAVs and integrates them into a SLAM algorithm (e.g., Extended Kalman Filter SLAM or Particle Filter SLAM) to construct a global 3D map.  
5.  **Reflection Mapping:**  Algorithm must differentiate between direct signal and reflected signals. Reflected signals provide mapping data for areas *not* directly visible.  Signal processing will leverage frequency shifting caused by the Doppler effect for detection.

**Pseudocode (UAV Node – Mapping Ping):**

```
// Initialization
Initialize clock via GPS
Initialize radio communication
Initialize acoustic transducer/microphone

// Main Loop
While (mission running)
    Get current time (t_now)
    If (t_now >= next_ping_time)
        Transmit mapping ping with timestamp (t_now)
        Record timestamp for next ping (next_ping_time + ping_interval)
    End If

    // Receive pings from other UAVs
    For each received ping:
        Get timestamp (t_tx) from ping
        Calculate Time of Arrival (ToA) = current time – t_tx
        Calculate Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) = ToA – ToA_reference (using a reference UAV)
        Estimate distance to transmitting UAV using TDoA and speed of sound.
        Update position estimate using multi-lateration.
        Transmit updated position estimate to Ground Station.
    End For
End While
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Search and Rescue (mapping collapsed buildings, caves)
*   Industrial Inspection (mapping interiors of tanks, pipelines)
*   Environmental Monitoring (mapping forest structure, cave systems)
*   Autonomous Navigation in GPS-Denied Environments (mines, tunnels)
