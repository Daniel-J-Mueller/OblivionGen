## Adaptive Sketch Resolution with Hierarchical Aggregation

**Concept:** Enhance cardinality estimation accuracy by dynamically adjusting the resolution of the Count-Min-Sketch (CMS) based on observed data distribution, coupled with a hierarchical aggregation strategy for improved top-N list maintenance.

**Problem:** Fixed-resolution CMS can suffer from inaccuracies when dealing with highly skewed or rapidly changing data distributions. Maintaining a top-N list solely based on estimated counts can also be brittle.

**Solution:** Introduce a multi-resolution CMS system where the resolution (number of hash functions and counter array size) can be dynamically increased or decreased for individual data segments. These segments are aggregated hierarchically, providing both granular and summarized views of contributor frequencies.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Segmentation:** Incoming data stream is divided into time windows or data segments (e.g., 5-minute intervals).  Segment size is configurable.

2.  **Resolution Controller:**  Each segment has an associated "Resolution Controller" component. This monitors the variance of observed counts within the segment.
    *   If variance exceeds a threshold, the Resolution Controller increases the CMS resolution for that segment (more hash functions, larger counter array).
    *   If variance falls below a threshold for a sustained period, the resolution is decreased.
    *   Resolution changes trigger a re-estimation of contributor frequencies within the segment.

3.  **Hierarchical Aggregation:**  Segments are organized into a hierarchy (e.g., hourly segments composed of 5-minute segments, daily segments composed of hourly segments).
    *   Each level in the hierarchy maintains a consolidated top-N list based on the aggregated frequencies from its child segments.
    *   Aggregation can use different strategies:
        *   **Summation:** Simple sum of counts from child segments.
        *   **Weighted Average:** Apply weights based on segment "confidence" (inverse of variance).
        *   **Sketch Merging:**  Combine sketches from child segments using techniques like the "harmonic mean" sketch combination.

4.  **Top-N List Maintenance:** The top-N list is maintained at each level of the hierarchy.
    *   When a segmentâ€™s top-N list changes significantly (detected by a drift detection algorithm), the changes are propagated up the hierarchy.
    *   Instead of solely relying on estimated counts, maintain a "relevance score" for each contributor based on both estimated frequency and the stability of the estimate (inverse of variance). The relevance score determines the ranking in the top-N list.

5.  **Sketch Storage & Retrieval:** Implement a tiered storage system:
    *   High-resolution sketches for recent segments are stored in fast memory.
    *   Lower-resolution sketches for older segments are compressed and stored on disk.
    *   Implement caching strategies to pre-fetch frequently accessed sketches.

**Pseudocode (Resolution Controller):**

```
function update_resolution(segment_data, current_resolution, variance_threshold_high, variance_threshold_low, max_resolution) {

  variance = calculate_variance(segment_data);

  if (variance > variance_threshold_high && current_resolution < max_resolution) {
    current_resolution = current_resolution * 2;  // Increase resolution
    recalculate_sketch(segment_data, current_resolution);
  } else if (variance < variance_threshold_low && current_resolution > 1) {
    current_resolution = current_resolution / 2;  // Decrease resolution
    recalculate_sketch(segment_data, current_resolution);
  }

  return current_resolution;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy in cardinality estimation, especially for skewed or dynamic data.
*   More robust top-N list maintenance.
*   Scalability through hierarchical aggregation and tiered storage.
*   Adaptability to changing data patterns.
