## Dynamic Vector Map Augmentation with Semantic Object Recognition

**Concept:** Enhance the vector map not just with geometric data (lines representing edges) but with semantic understanding of the objects those edges define. This allows for more robust navigation, task planning, and environmental interaction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Augmentation:**

*   **Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion:** Integrate a lightweight, low-power semantic camera (e.g., Intel RealSense with depth and RGB-D) alongside the existing range sensor.
*   **Edge TPU/Neural Compute Stick:** Include an on-board edge TPU or similar neural compute stick for real-time semantic segmentation and object recognition.
*   **IMU Integration:** Utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) to aid in pose estimation and sensor fusion.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Semantic Segmentation Module:** This module processes RGB-D data from the semantic camera to identify and classify objects in the environment (e.g., "shelf," "box," "door," "person"). Output: Pixel-wise semantic labels and confidence scores.
*   **Object-Aware Line Merging:** Modify the line merging algorithm to consider semantic information.
    *   If matched line segments are part of the same semantic object, prioritize merging with a higher confidence.
    *   Implement a semantic consistency check: If merging line segments would create a geometrically valid but semantically impossible object (e.g., a shelf floating in mid-air), suppress the merge.
*   **Dynamic Object Tracking:** Extend the vector map to include dynamic object tracking.
    *   Objects identified as "dynamic" (e.g., people, moving boxes) are represented by a bounding box and velocity vector in the map.
    *   The map is updated in real-time to reflect the movement of dynamic objects.
*   **Vector Map Layers:** Organize the vector map into multiple layers:
    *   **Static Layer:** Represents fixed objects (walls, floors, shelves).
    *   **Dynamic Layer:** Represents moving objects.
    *   **Semantic Layer:** Stores semantic labels and associated metadata for each object.

**3. Algorithm Pseudocode (Object-Aware Line Merging):**

```
function merge_lines(line1, line2, semantic_data):
    # Check geometric overlap (as in original patent)
    if not geometric_overlap(line1, line2):
        return False

    # Get semantic labels for objects containing the lines
    object1 = get_object_from_line(line1, semantic_data)
    object2 = get_object_from_line(line2, semantic_data)

    if object1 == None or object2 == None:
        # Lines don't belong to any known object – proceed with standard merge check
        return standard_merge_check(line1, line2)

    if object1 != object2:
        # Lines belong to different objects – do not merge
        return False

    # Lines belong to the same object – merge with high confidence
    return True
```

**4. Data Structures:**

*   **Vector Map Entry:**
    *   Line Segment: (x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2)
    *   Semantic Label: (string – e.g., "shelf", "box")
    *   Confidence Score: (float – 0.0 to 1.0)
    *   Object ID: (unique identifier for the object)
    *   Dynamic Flag: (boolean – true if object is moving)
    *   Velocity Vector: (x, y, z)

**5. Potential Applications:**

*   **Advanced Navigation:** Robots can navigate more intelligently by understanding the semantic meaning of the environment.
*   **Task Planning:** Robots can plan tasks more effectively by reasoning about objects and their relationships.
*   **Human-Robot Interaction:** Robots can interact with humans more naturally by understanding their actions and intentions.
*   **Environmental Monitoring:** Robots can monitor the environment for changes and anomalies.
