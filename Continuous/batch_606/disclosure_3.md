## Dynamic Dimensional Profiles & Predictive Grouping

**Concept:** Expand the ability to group items beyond simple size/weight matching, leveraging machine learning to predict dimensional compatibility based on *visual* similarity and product category. This moves beyond strict dimensional data to encompass ‘soft’ compatibility – items that *look* like they should fit together, even if dimensions aren’t identical.

**Specs:**

**1. Visual Input Module:**

*   **Input:** Accept image uploads or live camera feed of products.
*   **Processing:** Utilize a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a massive dataset of product images categorized by type (furniture, electronics, apparel, etc.). This CNN extracts visual features representing shape, style, and relative size characteristics.
*   **Output:** A feature vector representing the visual profile of the input product.

**2. Dimensional Data Enhancement:**

*   **Data Source:** Leverage existing dimensional data (weight, length, width, height) where available.
*   **Data Imputation:** For products *without* existing dimensional data, use the CNN's visual features to predict dimensions based on similar products in the dataset. Confidence levels for imputed data should be tracked.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Allow users to *override* predicted or existing dimensions, creating a user-corrected baseline. This feedback loop continuously improves the CNN's accuracy.

**3. Compatibility Scoring Engine:**

*   **Input:** Visual feature vectors and dimensional data (actual or imputed) for two or more products.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Calculate a dimensional compatibility score based on standard deviation/difference between measurements.
    *   Calculate a visual compatibility score based on the cosine similarity between the visual feature vectors.
    *   Combine these scores using a weighted average (weights adjustable based on product category).
*   **Output:** A compatibility score representing the likelihood that the products are dimensionally and visually compatible.

**4. Predictive Grouping Interface:**

*   **User Action:** User selects a 'seed' product.
*   **System Response:** System automatically suggests other products from the catalog based on the compatibility score. Display includes:
    *   Product image
    *   Compatibility score
    *   A 'dimensional confidence' indicator (high, medium, low, based on available data)
    *   Options to:
        *   Add to group
        *   View detailed dimensions
        *   Provide feedback on compatibility

**5. Group Management & Recommendation System:**

*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** When a product is added to a group, re-evaluate the compatibility of *all* members. This ensures cohesion and prevents outliers.
*   **Cross-Category Compatibility:** Allow users to create groups that span different product categories (e.g., "Living Room Setup" containing furniture, electronics, and decor).
*   **Personalized Recommendations:** Utilize group data to recommend complementary products to the user.



**Pseudocode (Compatibility Scoring Engine):**

```
function calculate_compatibility(product1, product2, category):
  // Extract features
  features1 = get_visual_features(product1)
  features2 = get_visual_features(product2)

  // Get dimensions
  dimensions1 = get_dimensions(product1)
  dimensions2 = get_dimensions(product2)

  // Calculate dimensional compatibility
  dimensional_compatibility = calculate_dimensional_difference(dimensions1, dimensions2)

  // Calculate visual compatibility
  visual_compatibility = cosine_similarity(features1, features2)

  //Adjust weightings depending on category
  if category == "furniture":
      weight_dimensional = 0.7
      weight_visual = 0.3
  else:
      weight_dimensional = 0.5
      weight_visual = 0.5

  // Combine scores
  compatibility_score = (weight_dimensional * dimensional_compatibility) + (weight_visual * visual_compatibility)

  return compatibility_score
```
