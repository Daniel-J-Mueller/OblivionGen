# 9646104

**Dynamic Contextual Webpage Stitching & Anticipatory Rendering**

**Core Concept:** Leveraging the browsing history tracking from the provided patent as a *predictive* engine to dynamically assemble webpages *before* the user explicitly requests them, and proactively render key content sections. This moves beyond simple user characteristic association to active webpage construction.

**System Specs:**

*   **History Aggregation Module:** (Existing from Patent 9646104) Continuously monitors user browsing history, identifies visited URLs, and associated user characteristics.  This module outputs a “context vector” representing the user’s current interests and likely next actions.
*   **Webpage Component Database:** A centralized repository storing webpage fragments (sections, widgets, images, code blocks) tagged with metadata.  Tags include:
    *   Content type (e.g., product description, review, image gallery)
    *   Associated user characteristics (from History Aggregation Module)
    *   Dependencies (other components required for rendering)
    *   Rendering priority (determines order of assembly)
*   **Anticipatory Rendering Engine:** The core of the new system.
    *   Input: Context Vector (from History Aggregation Module)
    *   Process:
        1.  **Component Selection:**  Queries the Webpage Component Database to identify components with high relevance to the Context Vector. Relevance is determined by a weighted scoring algorithm considering user characteristics, historical data, and contextual factors (time of day, location, current events).
        2.  **Dependency Resolution:** Identifies any missing dependencies for selected components. Automatically fetches or renders these dependencies.
        3.  **Dynamic Assembly:** Constructs a partially or fully rendered webpage by assembling selected components.  This occurs *before* the user explicitly requests a new page.
        4.  **Pre-fetching:** Pre-fetches necessary assets (images, CSS, JavaScript) to ensure smooth rendering.
*   **Client-Side Integration:**
    *   Lightweight JavaScript library embedded on the target website.
    *   Intercepts user navigation events (clicks, form submissions).
    *   Checks if a pre-rendered version of the requested page exists.
    *   If available, instantly displays the pre-rendered page, bypassing the traditional server request-response cycle.
    *   If not available, falls back to traditional rendering.
*   **Context Vector Enhancement:** The system monitors the *success* or *failure* of its anticipatory rendering.  If a user immediately navigates away from a pre-rendered page, the system reduces the weight of the contributing user characteristics. This ensures the Context Vector remains accurate and responsive.

**Pseudocode (Anticipatory Rendering Engine):**

```
FUNCTION RenderAnticipatoryPage(contextVector)

    componentList = QueryDatabase(contextVector) // Fetch relevant components
    dependencyList = ResolveDependencies(componentList) // Identify missing dependencies
    assembledPage = AssemblePage(componentList, dependencyList) // Construct the page

    RETURN assembledPage

FUNCTION AssemblePage(componentList, dependencyList)
    pageHTML = ""
    FOR each component IN componentList
        pageHTML += RenderComponent(component)
    END FOR

    RETURN pageHTML

FUNCTION RenderComponent(component)
    // Render component HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    RETURN componentHTML
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond passive user profiling to *proactive* webpage creation. By anticipating user needs based on browsing history, it can dramatically reduce page load times and improve the user experience. It creates a more fluid and responsive browsing environment where content appears almost instantaneously. The addition of feedback loops to adjust the weighting of user characteristics ensures ongoing relevance and accuracy.
