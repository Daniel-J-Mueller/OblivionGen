## Dynamic Container Allocation Based on Real-Time Weight & Balance

**Concept:** Expand beyond static weight/volume constraints for container allocation to incorporate *real-time* weight distribution and balance calculations during the packing process. This aims to optimize space utilization *and* ensure safe handling during transit, particularly for oddly shaped or fragile items.

**Specs:**

1.  **Integrated Scale System:** Each packing station is equipped with a high-precision scale integrated into the container platform.  This scale continuously monitors the weight of the container *and* can determine the center of gravity (CoG) via multiple load cells.

2.  **3D Item Scanning:** Before packing, each item is briefly scanned (using depth sensors or structured light) to create a 3D model and determine its precise weight and dimensions. This data is fed into the system.

3.  **Dynamic CoG Calculation:** Software continuously calculates the container's CoG based on the weight and 3D model of each added item.

4.  **“Tilt Factor” Constraint:** Introduce a “Tilt Factor” – a customizable parameter representing the maximum acceptable deviation from a perfectly centered CoG.  This factor adjusts based on the fragility of the contents and carrier requirements.  The system prevents placing items that would violate the Tilt Factor.

5.  **AI-Driven Placement Suggestions:** The system uses an AI model (trained on historical packing data and physics simulations) to suggest optimal item placement within the container, maximizing space utilization *while* adhering to the Tilt Factor. Suggestions are displayed to the packer on a screen.

6.  **Automated Re-Packing Recommendation:** If the system detects that the container is nearing the Tilt Factor limit or is poorly balanced, it automatically recommends re-packing certain items to improve stability.

7.  **Transit Monitoring Integration:** (Optional) Integrate with transit monitoring systems. If a container experiences unexpected shifts during transit (detected by accelerometers), the system can provide alerts and potentially adjust delivery routes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION packItem(item, container):
  itemWeight = getItemWeight(item)
  itemDimensions = getItemDimensions(item)
  containerWeight = getContainerWeight(container)
  containerCoG = getContainerCoG(container)
  
  predictedCoG = calculatePredictedCoG(item, containerCoG, containerWeight, itemWeight, itemDimensions)
  
  IF predictedCoG violates Tilt Factor:
    display message “Item placement will cause instability.  AI suggests alternative position.”
    suggestAlternativePositions(item, container)
    WAIT for packer approval/adjustment
  
  placeItem(item, container)
  updateContainerWeight(container)
  updateContainerCoG(container)

```
