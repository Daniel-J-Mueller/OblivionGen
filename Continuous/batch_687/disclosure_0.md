## Dynamic Content Blocks with AI-Driven Population

**Concept:** Expand the grid layout to incorporate “Dynamic Content Blocks” (DCBs). These aren't just cells for text/image, but containers with pre-defined content *types* (e.g., "Product Carousel," "Customer Testimonial," "Blog Post Teaser," "Social Feed"). Crucially, these DCBs aren’t initially populated with user content; instead, they leverage AI to auto-populate with *relevant* content.

**Specs:**

*   **DCB Definition:** New UI element within the grid editor. Allows the user to select a DCB type from a predefined list (extensible via plugins). Each type specifies data requirements (e.g., “Product Carousel” needs a list of product IDs, “Blog Post Teaser” needs a blog ID and number of posts).
*   **AI Content Population:** Upon DCB insertion, a background process initiates an AI content request. This request targets a content API (internal or external) providing relevant data.  The AI intelligently selects content matching the store type (as defined in the base patent) and potentially user preferences (if available).
*   **Content Preview & Editing:**  The AI-populated content is displayed as a preview within the DCB. The user can then *override* the AI’s choices with their own content, or refine the AI’s selection criteria.
*   **Content Refresh:**  Implement a "Refresh Content" button within each DCB. This re-triggers the AI content population, providing updated information.  Set configurable refresh intervals.
*   **DCB Templates:** Allow users to save customized DCB configurations (type, AI settings, default content) as reusable templates.

**Pseudocode (Content Population Process):**

```
function populateDCB(dcbType, storeType, userPreferences) {
  // 1. Construct AI Request
  requestData = {
    type: dcbType,
    storeType: storeType,
    userPreferences: userPreferences
  }

  // 2. Call Content API
  response = callContentAPI(requestData)

  // 3. Handle API Response
  if (response.success) {
    content = response.data
    // 4. Populate DCB with content
    displayContent(content)
  } else {
    // 5. Handle Error (display default or error message)
    displayErrorMessage("Failed to fetch content.")
  }
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Content Scoring:** The AI assigns a “relevance score” to each content item, helping it select the best choices.
*   **A/B Testing:** Automatically test different content variations within DCBs to optimize performance.
*   **Integration with Analytics:** Track the performance of each DCB to provide insights into user engagement.
*   **Content Suggestion Engine:**  Proactively suggest relevant content to users based on their site design and store type.
