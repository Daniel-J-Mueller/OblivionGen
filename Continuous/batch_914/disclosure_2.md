## Dynamic Tag Forum 'Ecosystems' & Sentiment-Driven Expansion

**Concept:** Expand the tag forum functionality into a dynamic, interconnected 'ecosystem' where forum visibility, content weighting, and even creation are governed by real-time sentiment analysis of user interactions *across* all forums and related item data. This goes beyond simply triggering forum creation at a threshold; it builds a responsive, evolving network of discussions.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Sentiment Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   All forum posts (text, emojis).
    *   Item review data (text, star ratings).
    *   User profile data (expressed preferences, purchase history).
    *   Social media feeds *related* to tagged items (optional, with user consent).
*   **Analysis:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) models to determine sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) for each data source.  Granularity should extend to *aspect-based* sentiment analysis (e.g., "The battery life is great, but the screen is dim.").
*   **Output:**  Real-time sentiment scores associated with each tag, item, and user.

**II. Dynamic Forum Visibility & Weighting:**

*   **Visibility Score:** Calculated based on:
    *   Average sentiment score for the tag.
    *   Volume of recent activity in the forum.
    *   Userâ€™s personal sentiment towards the tag/item.
*   **Forum Placement:** Forums with higher Visibility Scores are prioritized in placement (e.g., higher up on a web page, more prominent in search results).  Personalized placement based on user sentiment.
*   **Content Weighting:** Within a forum, posts with higher sentiment scores (positive for positive-sentiment tags, negative for negative-sentiment tags) are given greater visibility (e.g., pinned to the top, highlighted).

**III.  Automated Forum 'Budding' & 'Pruning'**

*   **Budding:** When a tag receives a sustained influx of *negative* sentiment (below a defined threshold) *and* a corresponding increase in activity, a *new, dedicated 'problem-solving'* forum is automatically created.  This separates constructive criticism from general discussion.
*   **Pruning:** Forums with consistently *low* sentiment and inactivity are automatically archived or merged with related forums.
*   **Forum 'Splitting':**  If a single forum receives consistently divergent sentiment regarding *different aspects* of a tag (identified through aspect-based sentiment analysis), the forum is automatically split into sub-forums focused on specific aspects.

**IV.  'Sentiment-Driven' Tag Recommendations**

*   Based on a user's expressed sentiment towards existing tags, the system recommends *related* tags with similar or contrasting sentiment profiles.
*   A 'sentiment filter' allows users to prioritize recommendations based on desired sentiment (e.g., "Show me tags that are generally praised," or "Show me tags that are often debated.").

**Pseudocode (Forum Budding):**

```
function check_forum_budding(tag):
  sentiment_score = calculate_average_sentiment(tag)
  activity_volume = get_recent_activity_count(tag)

  if sentiment_score < NEGATIVE_SENTIMENT_THRESHOLD and activity_volume > ACTIVITY_THRESHOLD:
    if not forum_exists_for_tag(tag, "problem_solving"):
      create_forum(tag, "problem_solving")
      log_event("New problem-solving forum created for tag: " + tag)
```

**V.  'Emotional Contagion' Monitoring**

*   Track how sentiment within a forum *influences* sentiment towards the tagged item/tag itself.
*   Identify 'emotional contagion' effects (e.g., a forum primarily filled with negative reviews leading to a drop in item sales).
*   Provide insights to item owners/managers on how to address negative sentiment and foster positive engagement.
