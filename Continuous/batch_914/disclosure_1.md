## Task-Attribute Propagation & Predictive Subscription Refinement

**Concept:** Extend the subscription model by not only matching static task attributes, but by *propagating* those attributes across tasks and *predictively* refining subscriptions based on observed performer behavior and task relationships. This goes beyond simple attribute matching – it anticipates what a performer *will* likely be interested in, even if it's not explicitly stated in their subscription.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:**  "Task Graph" – a directed graph where nodes are tasks, and edges represent relationships. Edge weights indicate relationship strength (determined algorithmically - see below). Task nodes hold all standard attributes *plus* a "derived attribute vector" – this is where the propagated attributes reside.

*   **Relationship Algorithm:**  Determine edge weights based on:
    *   **Co-occurrence:** Tasks frequently selected by the same performers get stronger edge weights.
    *   **Attribute Overlap:**  Tasks sharing many attributes get weighted connections.
    *   **Sequential Selection:** If a performer consistently selects Task A *then* Task B, the edge weight between A and B increases.
    *   **Requester Similarity:**  Tasks from the same requester (or similar requesters – determined by task categories & attributes) receive a connection boost.

*   **Attribute Propagation Algorithm:**
    *   Run periodically (e.g., hourly) or triggered by new task submission.
    *   For each task, examine its neighbors in the Task Graph.
    *   Transfer a fraction (adjustable parameter – 'propagation factor') of attributes from neighbors to the current task’s derived attribute vector.  Higher weight edges = stronger attribute transfer.  Attribute values can be averaged or combined based on the relationship type.
    *   This creates a 'halo' of attributes around each task, influenced by related tasks.

*   **Predictive Subscription Refinement Algorithm:**
    *   Run continuously in the background.
    *   For each performer, analyze their task selection history.
    *   Calculate a "preference vector" based on attributes of selected tasks.  Weight attributes based on recency and frequency of selection.
    *   For each *unselected* task:
        *   Calculate a "similarity score" between the task’s derived attribute vector and the performer’s preference vector.
        *   If the similarity score exceeds a threshold (adjustable), *temporarily* add the task to the performer’s "recommended tasks" list (a shadow subscription).
        *   Track the performer’s interaction with these recommended tasks. If they select a recommended task, permanently add the corresponding attributes to their subscription.

*   **User Interface Enhancement:**
    *   "Explore Similar Tasks" button on each task page.
    *   "Subscription Insights" dashboard showing a visual representation of the performer’s subscription attributes and how they are evolving.
    *   "Recommended Tasks" feed that’s constantly updated with tasks predicted to be of interest.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Refinement):**

```pseudocode
//For each performer
performerPreferenceVector = calculatePreferenceVector(performer.taskHistory)

//For each unselected task
similarityScore = cosineSimilarity(task.derivedAttributeVector, performerPreferenceVector)

if similarityScore > threshold:
  add task to performer.recommendedTasks
  track interaction with task
  if performer selects task:
    add task.attributes to performer.subscription
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability: The Task Graph and attribute propagation algorithms will require significant computational resources. Use distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Spark) to handle the load.
*   Attribute Normalization:  Normalize attribute values to prevent certain attributes from dominating the similarity calculations.
*   Parameter Tuning: The propagation factor, similarity threshold, and other parameters will need to be carefully tuned to optimize performance.
*   Cold Start Problem:  For new performers with no task history, use a default preference vector based on overall task popularity.
