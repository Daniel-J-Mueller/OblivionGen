## Dynamic Fluidic Lens Array with Electrowetting Control

**Concept:** Leverage electrowetting principles not for display, but to create a dynamically adjustable lens array. Instead of switching pixels on/off, modulate the curvature of individual fluidic lenses within the array to achieve optical zoom, focus adjustment, and even rudimentary beam steering.

**Specifications:**

*   **Array Architecture:** Microfluidic chip containing an NxN array of sealed, individual lens chambers. N = 64 minimum, scalable up to 512x512.
*   **Lens Fluid:**  A two-fluid system. Primary fluid: a non-conducting, high refractive index oil. Secondary fluid: An electrically conductive polar liquid (similar to that used in the referenced patent) dispersed within the primary fluid as microdroplets.
*   **Electrode Configuration:** Each lens chamber has a transparent ITO electrode on one surface. The ITO is patterned with a micro-grid to provide finer control over droplet distribution.
*   **Control Matrix:** Individual control lines to each ITO electrode, allowing for precise voltage application.
*   **Chamber Geometry:** Chambers are initially spherical. Applying a voltage causes the conductive droplets to migrate towards the electrode, deforming the sphere into a prolate spheroid (elongated).  The degree of deformation is directly proportional to the applied voltage.
*   **Optical Properties:** By controlling the voltage to each chamber, we control the focal length of that chamber's lens.
*   **Frame Rate:** Target frame rate of 60 Hz for smooth optical adjustments.
*   **Power Requirements:** Low voltage operation (0-5V) to minimize power consumption.

**Pseudocode for Dynamic Zoom Implementation:**

```
// Parameters
int arraySize = 64; //NxN array
float voltageScale = 5.0; // Maximum voltage
float zoomFactor = 2.0; // Desired zoom level

// Function to calculate voltage for each lens based on zoom level
float calculateLensVoltage(int row, int col, float zoom) {
    // Calculate the desired focal length for this lens
    float focalLength = baseFocalLength / zoom;

    // Calculate the voltage required to achieve this focal length
    float voltage = (focalLength - baseFocalLength) * voltageScale / (baseFocalLength);

    // Clamp voltage to ensure valid range
    voltage = max(0.0, min(voltageScale, voltage));
    return voltage;
}

// Main Loop
for (frame = 0; frame < totalFrames; frame++) {
    for (row = 0; row < arraySize; row++) {
        for (col = 0; col < arraySize; col++) {
            // Calculate the voltage for this lens
            float voltage = calculateLensVoltage(row, col, zoomFactor);

            // Apply voltage to the corresponding electrode
            setElectrodeVoltage(row, col, voltage);
        }
    }
    // Display the resulting image or data
    displayImage();
}

```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Compact cameras with variable focal length
*   Microscopic imaging with dynamic focus adjustment
*   Adaptive optics for real-time image correction
*   Light field displays
*   Holographic projection systems
