## Multi-Spectral Touch & Proximity Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the touch/antenna integration to incorporate multiple frequency ranges (infrared, ultraviolet, terahertz) to create a multi-spectral proximity and touch mapping system. This goes beyond simple capacitive touch and enables “seeing” through certain materials, detecting material composition under touch, and creating layered interaction possibilities.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Integrate multiple micro-antenna/sensor elements within each touch control electrode. Each element is tuned to a specific frequency range (e.g., 600MHz-10GHz for standard wireless, 3THz for material detection, 940nm for infrared proximity).
*   **Excitation & Detection:** Each frequency range requires a dedicated excitation source (micro-transmitter) and receiver connected to the radio controller.  The radio controller will multiplex signals across these frequencies.
*   **Material Signature Database:**  Develop a database of material spectral signatures (terahertz reflectivity, infrared absorption) to identify materials under touch.
*   **Layered Interaction:** Design software to interpret the multi-spectral data to differentiate between layers. For example:
    *   User touches a screen covered with a thin cloth: System detects the cloth and filters out the touch signal.
    *   User touches *through* the cloth: System detects the cloth *and* the underlying touch point.
    *   User places a specific material (identified via spectral signature) on the surface: Triggers a unique action.
*   **Signal Processing:**
    *   **Frequency Domain Analysis:** Utilize Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) to analyze received signals in each frequency range.
    *   **Phase Shift Measurement:** Track phase shifts in the reflected signals to determine distance to the object.
    *   **Signal Attenuation Measurement:** Quantify signal attenuation to determine material properties.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified for one spectral range):**

```
//Spectral Range: 3THz
function processSpectralData(receivedSignal){
    fftResult = FFT(receivedSignal);
    peakFrequency = findPeakFrequency(fftResult);
    materialSignature = lookupMaterialSignature(peakFrequency);

    if (materialSignature == "Unknown"){
        // Default to capacitive touch detection
    } else {
        // Apply action based on material signature
        // e.g.  If materialSignature == "Steel" then activate magnetic lock.
    }

}
```

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   Multi-frequency RF transceiver chip.
    *   Miniature terahertz emitter/receiver module.
    *   High-speed Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC).
    *   Dedicated signal processing unit (FPGA or DSP).
*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Advanced security systems (material identification).
    *   Medical diagnostics (non-invasive tissue analysis).
    *   Interactive art installations (material-reactive displays).
    *   Industrial quality control (material defect detection).
    *   Enhanced augmented reality interfaces.
