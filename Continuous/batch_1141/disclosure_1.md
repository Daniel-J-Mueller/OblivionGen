## Automated Recipe Generation & Dynamic Display System

**Concept:** Extend the system's item identification and user association to facilitate a dynamic recipe/instruction display based on items *removed* from inventory, anticipating user needs *before* explicit request. This goes beyond simply identifying *what* was picked, to *why* it was picked, and suggesting a completion pathway.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing overhead camera system (as per patent).
    *   High-resolution, dynamically updating display screen *integrated into* the tote itself. (e-ink or similar low-power option preferred). Screen size: 6" diagonal minimum.
    *   Optional: Small haptic feedback module integrated into tote handle.
    *   Increased processing power to handle recipe database and suggestion algorithms.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Recipe Database:** Comprehensive database of recipes/instructions linked to inventory items.  Can be sourced from public APIs, internal datasets, or user contributions. Database must be structured to accommodate ingredient substitutions.
    *   **Item Action Analysis Module:** Modified existing image comparison software. Now, instead of *just* identifying item pick, it determines *how* the item is being taken (e.g., one unit, multiple units, specific orientation).
    *   **Recipe Suggestion Algorithm:** Core of the system.
        *   Based on items removed from inventory, algorithm queries the recipe database.
        *   Prioritizes recipes based on ingredient overlap. (e.g., if tomato, onion, and garlic are picked, suggest pasta sauce, salsa, etc.).
        *   Includes a "confidence score" for each suggestion based on user history (see User Profile section).
        *   Dynamically adjusts suggestions based on item pick order (e.g., picking meat *before* vegetables suggests grilling/cooking recipes).
    *   **User Profile:** Each user associated with the system has a profile storing:
        *   Dietary restrictions/preferences.
        *   Past recipe selections.
        *   Ingredient preferences.
        *   Skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced). â€“ impacting recipe complexity.
    *   **Dynamic Display Control:** Software managing display content.
        *   Displays prioritized recipe suggestions.
        *   Displays ingredient list for selected recipe.
        *   Provides step-by-step instructions with visual aids (images/videos).
        *   Allows user to manually search for recipes.
        *   Offers option to create/save custom recipes.
*   **Workflow:**

    1.  Overhead camera detects item pick.
    2.  Item Action Analysis Module identifies item and how it was picked.
    3.  Recipe Suggestion Algorithm queries database based on picked items and user profile.
    4.  Dynamic Display Control updates tote display with prioritized recipe suggestions.
    5.  User selects recipe.
    6.  Display shows ingredient list and step-by-step instructions.
    7.  System tracks recipe completion (optional - based on further item picks/lack thereof).

**Pseudocode (Recipe Suggestion Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION suggest_recipes(picked_items, user_profile):
  candidate_recipes = DATABASE.query(ingredients IN picked_items)
  
  # Score recipes based on:
  # 1. Ingredient overlap (higher = better)
  # 2. User preference (from user_profile)
  # 3. Recipe complexity (based on user skill level)
  
  FOR recipe IN candidate_recipes:
    overlap_score = calculate_ingredient_overlap(recipe, picked_items)
    preference_score = get_user_preference_score(recipe, user_profile)
    complexity_score = calculate_complexity_score(recipe, user_profile)
    
    recipe.score = (overlap_score * 0.5) + (preference_score * 0.3) + (complexity_score * 0.2)
  
  SORT recipes BY score DESCENDING
  
  RETURN TOP 3 recipes
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with voice control.
*   Real-time inventory tracking (suggest recipes based on available ingredients).
*   Automated shopping list generation.
*   Nutritional information display.
