## Dynamic Contextual Embedding for Multi-Modal Prediction

**Concept:** Expand the contextual data beyond static display content to incorporate *predicted* user intent based on ongoing interaction, creating a self-modifying contextual embedding. This anticipates user needs before explicit utterance, refining NLU accuracy, and enabling proactive assistance.

**Specs:**

**1. Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time stream of user interactions (e.g., gaze tracking, mouse movements, touch events, app usage patterns) alongside the current display content.
*   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a GRU or LSTM – trained to predict likely user actions or intents *within the current context*. This model does *not* directly process speech; it's focused on non-verbal cues.
*   **Output:** A probability distribution over potential user intents (e.g., “likely to search for X”, “likely to click on Y”, “likely to ask about Z”). These are *predicted* intents, not user utterances.

**2. Contextual Embedding Generation:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Static display content data (as in the original patent).
    *   Predicted intent distribution from the Prediction Module.
    *   Current utterance (audio data).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Encode the static display content data into a fixed-length vector (as in the original patent).
    2.  Encode the predicted intent distribution into a fixed-length vector.  A weighted average of intent vectors could be used, prioritizing high-probability intents.
    3.  Concatenate or fuse the static content vector and the predicted intent vector.  An attention mechanism could be used to dynamically weight the contribution of each vector.
    4.  Feed the fused vector, alongside the text data from the utterance, into the NLU model.

**3. NLU Model Adaptation:**

*   The NLU model (LSTM, Transformer, etc.) should be trained with data that includes this augmented contextual embedding.  Training data should include examples of utterances made *in conjunction* with predicted user intents (even if those intents weren’t explicitly stated in the utterance).
*   Employ a contrastive learning approach. The model is trained to differentiate between utterances made in a given context with a *correct* predicted intent, and utterances made in the same context with an *incorrect* predicted intent.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Embedding Generation):**

```python
def generate_contextual_embedding(display_content_data, predicted_intent_distribution):
  """Generates a contextual embedding by fusing display content and predicted intent."""

  # Encode display content
  display_embedding = encode_display_content(display_content_data)

  # Encode predicted intent
  intent_embedding = encode_predicted_intent(predicted_intent_distribution)

  # Fuse embeddings (example: concatenation)
  context_embedding = concatenate(display_embedding, intent_embedding)

  return context_embedding

def encode_predicted_intent(intent_distribution):
  """Encodes a probability distribution over intents into a vector."""
  # Example: Weighted average of intent vectors
  intent_vectors = {
      "search_x": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3],
      "click_y": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
      "ask_z": [0.7, 0.8, 0.9]
  }
  weighted_sum = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
  for intent, probability in intent_distribution.items():
    if intent in intent_vectors:
      for i in range(len(intent_vectors[intent])):
        weighted_sum[i] += probability * intent_vectors[intent][i]
  return weighted_sum
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond *reactive* contextual understanding (analyzing what the user *said* in light of what's on the screen) to *proactive* contextual understanding (anticipating what the user *might say* based on their behavior). This enables the system to provide more relevant and timely assistance, even before the user explicitly requests it.
