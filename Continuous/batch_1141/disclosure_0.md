## Dynamic Audio-Spatial Notification System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple audio tone association to create a notification system that uses spatial audio and contextual awareness to deliver information *around* the user, rather than directly *to* them. This system moves away from simple alerts and towards an ambient, information-rich environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of low-power, beamforming microphones (4-8 minimum) integrated into a wearable (glasses, headband, clip-on device).
    *   Miniature spatial audio emitters (bone conduction or localized micro-speakers) distributed around the wearable.
    *   Onboard processing unit (low-power ARM processor or equivalent).
    *   Bluetooth/Wi-Fi connectivity.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Environmental Mapping:** Continuously analyze microphone input to create a real-time 3D audio map of the user’s surroundings. Identify surfaces, obstacles, and potential echo points.
    *   **Object/Event Correlation:** Utilize data from the original patent (device type, settings, object detection) to categorize incoming events.
    *   **Spatial Audio Engine:**  A core component that dynamically generates and directs audio signals to specific locations in the user's perceived space. This isn’t about simple panning; it’s about creating the *illusion* of sound originating from a source.
    *   **Contextual Rules Engine:** Allows users (or automated systems) to define rules for how notifications are presented. Examples:
        *   “When the security camera detects motion, project a gentle chime *from the direction of the camera*.”
        *   “If a package arrives, announce ‘Package Delivery’ *as if the voice is coming from the front door*.”
        *   “When the oven timer goes off, project the sound *as if it is coming from the kitchen*."
    *   **User Profile Management:** Stores individual preferences for notification style, volume, and priority.
*   **Pseudocode (Event Processing):**

```
function processEvent(eventData):
  deviceType = eventData.deviceType
  eventName = eventData.eventName
  location = eventData.location // (X, Y, Z) coordinates
  audioProfile = getAudioProfile(deviceType, eventName) // Retrieve pre-defined audio profile

  if audioProfile != null:
    soundEffect = audioProfile.soundEffect
    volume = audioProfile.volume
    spatializationCue = audioProfile.spatializationCue

    // Adjust volume and spatialization based on user preference and environmental analysis
    adjustedVolume = adjustVolume(volume, userPreferences, ambientNoiseLevel)
    adjustedSpatialization = adjustSpatialization(spatializationCue, location, environmentMap)

    // Direct sound to the appropriate location
    emitSpatialAudio(soundEffect, adjustedVolume, adjustedSpatialization, location)
  else:
    // Default notification (visual or simple tone)
    displayNotification(eventData)
```

*   **Expansion Possibilities:**
    *   Integration with Augmented Reality (AR) glasses for visual reinforcement of spatial audio cues.
    *   AI-powered learning of user habits and automatic adaptation of notification profiles.
    *   Multi-user environments – notifications can be localized to individual users in a shared space.
    *   Integration with smart home ecosystems to create a truly responsive and immersive environment.
