## Aerial Bioluminescence Mapping & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Adapt the time-gated laser system to detect and map bioluminescent organisms in natural environments, creating dynamic 3D reconstructions of underwater or nocturnal life. 

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Replace standard laser reflection sensor with a highly sensitive, multi-spectral (blue/green range optimized) photon counting detector.  Detector must have adjustable gain and cooling for optimal signal/noise ratio. Integrate a narrow-band optical filter to block ambient light and isolate bioluminescence wavelengths.
*   **Emission Profile:** Implement a pulsed, multi-wavelength (selectable within blue/green spectrum) LED array *instead* of a laser.  This allows for stimulation of different bioluminescent organisms and potentially differentiating species based on emission spectra. Pulse duration adjustable from nanoseconds to microseconds.
*   **UAV Flight Pattern:** Autonomous flight patterns optimized for scanning pre-defined areas or following natural features (coastlines, riverbanks).  Flight altitude variable, with data logging for accurate positioning.  Must include obstacle avoidance.
*   **Time-Gating Adaptation:** Modify time-gating to operate not on *reflected* laser light, but on *emitted* bioluminescence.  The system calculates expected arrival times of bioluminescence from a given volume based on UAV position, and gates the sensor accordingly.
*   **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Raw Data Acquisition:**  Record photon counts, arrival times, sensor gain, UAV position (GPS/IMU), and ambient light levels.
    *   **Noise Reduction:** Implement advanced filtering algorithms (e.g., Kalman filtering) to remove noise and spurious signals.
    *   **Bioluminescence Source Localization:** Utilize time-of-flight information and triangulation to estimate the 3D location of each bioluminescent source.
    *   **Species Identification:** Employ machine learning algorithms trained on known bioluminescence spectra to classify detected organisms. (Requires initial data collection and labeling).
    *   **3D Reconstruction:** Generate a dynamic 3D model of the bioluminescent environment.  Model should visualize organism locations, densities, and potentially track their movements.

**Pseudocode (Data Processing):**

```
FOR each sensor reading:
    IF photon_count > noise_threshold:
        arrival_time = sensor.timestamp
        uav_position = get_uav_position(arrival_time)
        distance = calculate_distance(uav_position, sensor.location)  //Using arrival time and speed of light
        IF distance is valid:
            source_location = calculate_source_location(uav_position, distance)
            species = identify_species(sensor.spectrum)
            ADD source_location, species TO 3D_model
END
```
