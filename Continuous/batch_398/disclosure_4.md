## Adaptive Request Weaving

**Concept:** Extend shadow request testing to incorporate a dynamic 'weaving' of shadow requests *into* live traffic, not just alongside it. This aims to stress-test the system with realistic concurrency and contention, and also allow for live-data driven testing of shadow versions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Request Interleaving Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for managing the interleaving of shadow requests with live user requests. Operates *within* the existing allocation module framework.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Live Request Stream: Incoming user requests.
    *   Shadow Request Generator: Generates shadow requests based on allocation rules.
    *   Interleaving Policy: Configurable rules governing *how* shadow requests are interleaved. Policies can be based on:
        *   Request Type: Prioritize interleaving shadow requests mirroring specific critical request types.
        *   User Segment:  Interleave shadow requests reflecting activity from defined user segments (e.g., high-value users, new users).
        *   System Load:  Dynamically adjust interleaving density based on real-time system load metrics.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Combined Request Stream: A single stream of requests containing both live and interleaved shadow requests.  Each request is tagged with its origin (live or shadow).

**2. Data Masking & Injection Module:**

*   **Function:** Prepares shadow requests with realistic data, drawing from anonymized or synthetic live data. Crucially, it allows for *controlled* data manipulation within shadow requests.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Live Data Stream (Anonymized): Access to a stream of anonymized live data.
    *   Shadow Request Payload: The initial payload of the shadow request.
    *   Data Injection Rules: Rules defining how data from the live stream should be injected into the shadow request payload.  Examples:
        *   Replace specific fields with live data.
        *   Introduce variations in data values (e.g., slightly modify monetary amounts).
        *   Simulate edge-case data scenarios.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Modified Shadow Request Payload: The shadow request payload with injected/modified data.

**3. Correlation Engine:**

*   **Function:** Tracks the flow of individual requests (live and shadow) through the system, allowing for detailed performance analysis and issue identification.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Request Stream (Tagged): The combined request stream with live/shadow tags.
    *   System Logs: Logs from all relevant system components (web servers, application servers, databases, etc.).
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Request Trace Data: Detailed information about the execution path of each request, including latency, resource usage, and error codes.
    *   Correlation Reports: Reports highlighting performance differences between live and shadow requests, identifying potential bottlenecks or bugs.

**Pseudocode (Interleaving Policy Application):**

```
function applyInterleavingPolicy(liveRequestStream, shadowRequestStream, policy) {
  combinedStream = []
  liveRequestCount = 0
  shadowRequestCount = 0

  if (policy.type == "requestTypePrioritization") {
    targetRequestType = policy.requestType
    while (liveRequestStream.hasNext() || shadowRequestStream.hasNext()) {
      if (liveRequestStream.hasNext() && liveRequestStream.peek().type == targetRequestType) {
        combinedStream.add(liveRequestStream.poll())
        liveRequestCount++
      } else if (shadowRequestStream.hasNext()) {
        combinedStream.add(shadowRequestStream.poll())
        shadowRequestCount++
      } else {
        combinedStream.add(liveRequestStream.poll())
        liveRequestCount++
      }
    }
  } else if (policy.type == "loadBased") {
    currentLoad = getSystemLoad()
    interleavingRatio = calculateInterleavingRatio(currentLoad, policy.minLoad, policy.maxLoad, policy.baseRatio)

    while (liveRequestStream.hasNext() || shadowRequestStream.hasNext()) {
      if (random() < interleavingRatio && shadowRequestStream.hasNext()) {
        combinedStream.add(shadowRequestStream.poll())
        shadowRequestCount++
      } else if (liveRequestStream.hasNext()) {
        combinedStream.add(liveRequestStream.poll())
        liveRequestCount++
      }
    }
  } else {
    //Default: simple interleaving
    while (liveRequestStream.hasNext() || shadowRequestStream.hasNext()) {
      if (random() < 0.5 && shadowRequestStream.hasNext()) {
        combinedStream.add(shadowRequestStream.poll())
        shadowRequestCount++
      } else if (liveRequestStream.hasNext()) {
        combinedStream.add(liveRequestStream.poll())
        liveRequestCount++
      }
    }
  }

  return combinedStream
}
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simply running shadow requests in parallel. It actively *weaves* them into the live traffic, creating a more realistic and challenging test environment. The data injection and correlation engine provide the tools to analyze the results and pinpoint issues that might not be apparent in traditional shadow testing.
