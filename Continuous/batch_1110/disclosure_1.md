## Automated Remediation Workflow Chaining & Predictive Non-Compliance

**Concept:** Expand the automated remediation system to support chained workflows and proactively predict potential non-compliance based on resource behavior and historical data, triggering preventative remediation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workflow Definition Language (WDFL):**

*   **Purpose:** A declarative language for defining complex remediation workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
*   **Elements:**
    *   *Node:* Represents a remediation action (e.g., terminate instance, modify security group).  Nodes inherit properties from a base action library.
    *   *Edge:* Defines dependencies between nodes. Edges can specify success/failure conditions for triggering subsequent nodes.  Conditionals utilize a simplified expression language (e.g., `if resource_type == 'database' and error_code == 503`).
    *   *Input/Output Variables:* Nodes can accept and pass variables, allowing data to be propagated through the workflow.
*   **Example:**

```WDFL
workflow high_cpu_remediation {
  node check_cpu_usage {
    action: monitor_cpu
    threshold: 90%
    duration: 5m
  }
  node scale_instance {
    action: resize_instance
    instance_type: m5.xlarge
  }
  node send_notification {
    action: notify_slack
    channel: "#operations"
    message: "High CPU detected on {{resource_id}}, scaled to {{instance_type}}"
  }
  edge check_cpu_usage -> scale_instance (condition: cpu_usage > 90)
  edge scale_instance -> send_notification (always)
}
```

**2. Predictive Non-Compliance Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Resource Configuration History (drift detection)
    *   Resource Performance Metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O)
    *   Application Logs
    *   Security Event Logs
    *   External Threat Intelligence Feeds
*   **Model Training:** Utilize time-series forecasting and anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA, Isolation Forest) to predict potential non-compliance. The system learns from historical data and identifies patterns indicating future violations.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each resource based on predicted non-compliance probability and severity of potential violation.
*   **Proactive Remediation:**  Based on risk score thresholds, automatically trigger relevant remediation workflows *before* a violation occurs.

**3. Workflow Orchestration Service:**

*   **Execution Engine:** Responsible for executing workflows defined in WDFL. Supports parallel and sequential execution of nodes.
*   **State Management:** Tracks the state of each workflow instance.
*   **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling and rollback mechanisms.
*   **Auditing:** Logs all workflow executions for compliance and troubleshooting.
*   **API Endpoints:** Provide programmatic access to workflow management and execution.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Remediation Workflow):**

```
function predict_non_compliance(resource):
  data = collect_resource_data(resource)
  prediction = run_model(data)  // Use trained model
  risk_score = calculate_risk(prediction)
  return risk_score

function trigger_remediation(resource, workflow):
  execute_workflow(resource, workflow)
  log_event("Remediation triggered for " + resource)

main loop:
  for each resource in monitored_resources:
    risk_score = predict_non_compliance(resource)
    if risk_score > threshold:
      remediation_workflow = select_workflow(risk_score)
      trigger_remediation(resource, remediation_workflow)
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond reactive remediation to a proactive, predictive approach.  Chaining workflows allows for more complex and nuanced responses to non-compliance.  The WDFL provides a standardized and declarative way to define remediation logic, improving maintainability and collaboration.
