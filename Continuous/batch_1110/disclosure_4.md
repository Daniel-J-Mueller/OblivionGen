## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Temporal Echo Mapping

**Concept:** Expand on the microphone array compensation by using compensated signals not just for beamforming/localization, but to *reconstruct* an acoustic ‘echo map’ of the environment over time. This creates a dynamic 3D model representing sound reflections and their changes.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microphone array (64+ microphones minimum, distributed spatially)
    *   High-speed ADC for each microphone (minimum 96kHz sampling rate)
    *   Edge computing unit with dedicated DSP/FPGA for real-time processing
    *   Optional: IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for array orientation tracking.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Compensation Engine:** Identical to the core compensation described in the patent – frequency-dependent gain applied to each microphone signal.
    *   **Time-Frequency Analysis:** STFT (Short-Time Fourier Transform) applied to compensated signals. Parameters: window size = 1024 samples, hop size = 256 samples.
    *   **Ray Tracing Module:**  A simplified ray tracing algorithm implemented in the DSP/FPGA. This module takes the time-frequency representation of the compensated signals and estimates the origin and path of sound reflections.  Algorithm should prioritize early reflections (first 100ms). Ray tracing parameters:
        *   Room dimensions (user-defined or estimated via SLAM)
        *   Surface material properties (absorption coefficients – pre-defined library or user input)
        *   Sound source location (initial guess from beamforming, refined with reflection analysis).
    *   **Echo Map Builder:** Constructs a point cloud representing the estimated locations of reflecting surfaces.  Points are weighted by the energy of the corresponding reflection.  Temporal smoothing applied to reduce noise and create a dynamic map.
    *   **Scene Reconstruction:** From the Echo Map, construct a mesh surface representing the acoustic environment. Use techniques like Poisson Surface Reconstruction or Ball Pivoting Algorithm.
    *   **Visualization:** Real-time display of the reconstructed 3D acoustic scene, highlighting areas of high reflectivity.

**Pseudocode (Echo Map Update):**

```
FOR each frequency bin f IN STFT output:
    FOR each microphone m:
        compensated_signal[m, f] = original_signal[m, f] * gain[m, f]
    
    FOR each reflection candidate r:
        path_length = distance(sound_source, microphone) + distance(microphone, reflection_point)
        arrival_time = path_length / speed_of_sound
        
        IF abs(arrival_time - current_time) < time_window:
            reflection_energy = abs(compensated_signal[microphone, f])
            
            echo_map[reflection_point] += reflection_energy
    
    Apply temporal smoothing to echo_map (moving average filter)

```

**Applications:**

*   **Enhanced Audio Conferencing:** Suppress noise and reverberation by modeling the room acoustics.
*   **Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Create more immersive soundscapes by accurately simulating sound reflections.
*   **Robotics/Autonomous Navigation:**  Enable robots to “see” with sound, allowing them to navigate complex environments.
*   **Security/Surveillance:** Detect and locate sound sources in challenging acoustic environments.
*   **Acoustic Mapping:** Generate detailed 3D maps of indoor spaces based on sound reflections.
