## Dynamic Event Re-Mix System

**Concept:** Leverage the core idea of segmented media delivery, but extend it beyond simply providing highlights. Create a system that allows *real-time*, user-directed remixing of event media into personalized short-form content.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Live or pre-recorded event media stream (video, audio, potentially sensor data - crowd noise, player stats).  Metadata stream describing event actions (goals scored, key plays, speaker changes, etc.).
*   **User Interface:** Mobile application allowing users to define “Remix Rules”.  These rules specify criteria for segment selection and combination. Examples:
    *   “Show all goals scored by Player X.”
    *   “Combine all segments featuring high crowd noise with clips of the speaker mentioning ‘innovation’.”
    *   “Create a montage of all ‘successful’ plays (as defined by game statistics) with upbeat music.”
    *   “Show all moments where the camera focuses on a specific person in the audience.”
*   **Remix Engine (Server-Side):**
    1.  **Event Decomposition:** Incoming media is continuously broken down into short, semantic segments.  Segmentation relies on both time-based division *and* event metadata.
    2.  **Rule Matching:**  User-defined Remix Rules are evaluated against each segment.  A segment is flagged as “selected” if it matches the rule criteria.
    3.  **Dynamic Assembly:** Selected segments are assembled into a new media stream based on user preferences (e.g., segment order, transitions, music overlay).
    4.  **Rendering & Delivery:** The assembled media stream is rendered (video encoding, audio mixing) and delivered to the user's device.
*   **AI Enhancement (Optional):**
    *   **Automatic Highlight Detection:**  AI models trained to identify compelling event moments based on visual and auditory cues.  These detected highlights can be used to pre-populate Remix Rules or supplement user-defined criteria.
    *   **Music Selection:** AI models that automatically select appropriate background music based on the event type and user preferences.
    *   **Transition Generation:** AI algorithms that create visually appealing transitions between segments.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   Event media segments (short-form clips)
    *   User-defined Remix Rules
    *   User preferences (music genre, transition style)

**Pseudocode (Remix Engine):**

```
function processEventStream(eventStream, metadataStream) {
  segments = decomposeEventStream(eventStream, metadataStream);

  for each segment in segments {
    if (segmentMatchesRemixRules(segment, userRemixRules)) {
      selectedSegments.add(segment);
    }
  }

  assembledMedia = assembleSelectedSegments(selectedSegments, userPreferences);
  deliverMedia(assembledMedia);
}

function segmentMatchesRemixRules(segment, remixRules) {
  // Evaluate segment metadata against each rule in remixRules
  // Return true if the segment satisfies at least one rule
}

function assembleSelectedSegments(segments, preferences) {
  // Sort segments according to user preferences
  // Add transitions between segments
  // Overlay music and audio effects
  // Encode the final media stream
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond passive viewing of event highlights.  It empowers users to actively curate their own personalized event experiences, creating unique short-form content tailored to their interests. It's a "DJ for events" type of system, turning event footage into a remixable medium. This also creates a new layer of engagement with event content beyond replay of the full recording.
