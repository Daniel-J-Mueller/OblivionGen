## Dynamic Sentiment-Driven Review Summarization with Temporal Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the existing review excerpt extraction by incorporating a temporal weighting factor, prioritizing more recent reviews and dynamically adjusting summary sentiment based on evolving consumer opinions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Decay Function:**

*   **Parameter:** `decay_rate` (float, 0.0 - 1.0). Higher values emphasize recent reviews more strongly. Default: 0.95.
*   **Calculation:** Assign a weight to each review based on its age: `weight = decay_rate ^ (current_time - review_time)`.  `review_time` is the timestamp of the review submission.
*   **Implementation:** Integrate this weighting into the ranking of reviews within each category (Claims 1, 4, 21).  Modify the "usefulness scores" (Claims 1, 4, 21) by multiplying them by the temporal weight before ranking.

**2.  Sentiment Drift Detection:**

*   **Analysis Window:** Define a sliding time window (e.g., 30 days) to analyze sentiment trends within each category.
*   **Sentiment Calculation:**  Utilize a sentiment analysis engine (e.g., VADER, TextBlob) to calculate the average sentiment score for reviews within the analysis window.
*   **Drift Threshold:** Define a threshold (e.g., 0.1 on a -1 to 1 sentiment scale) to detect significant sentiment shifts.
*   **Dynamic Summary Adjustment:**  If sentiment drift is detected in a category, prioritize excerpts reflecting the *new* sentiment, even if they have lower usefulness scores.  This could involve:
    *   Temporarily boosting the ranking of excerpts with the new sentiment.
    *   Dynamically adjusting the `positive/negative` sentiment ratio in the extracted excerpts (Claim 1).

**3.  Multi-Aspect Sentiment Analysis:**

*   **Aspect Extraction:** Employ topic modeling (e.g., LDA, NMF) or keyword extraction to identify key product aspects mentioned in the reviews (e.g., battery life, screen quality, comfort).
*   **Aspect-Specific Sentiment:**  Determine the sentiment associated with each aspect. For example, a review might be generally positive but express negative sentiment about the product's camera.
*   **Weighted Summarization:** When generating the summary, prioritize aspects that are most important to the consumer (based on consumer preference data – Claim 4, 21) and reflect the sentiment towards those aspects.

**4. Review Source Weighting**

*   **Source Identification:**  Determine the source of each review (e.g., official website, social media, blog).
*   **Trust Score:** Assign a trust score to each source based on factors like reputation, verification status, and historical accuracy.
*   **Weighted Contribution:**  When ranking and selecting excerpts, incorporate the source’s trust score as a multiplier.  Higher trust scores increase the weight of excerpts from that source.

**Pseudocode (Integration into existing system – Claim 1, 4, 21):**

```
function extract_review_excerpt(item, user_preferences):

  reviews = get_all_reviews(item)
  categories = categorize_reviews(reviews, item)

  ranked_categories = rank_categories(categories, user_preferences)

  for category in ranked_categories:
      weighted_reviews = []
      for review in category.reviews:
          weight = calculate_temporal_weight(review)
          weighted_score = review.usefulness_score * weight
          weighted_reviews.append((review, weighted_score))

      weighted_reviews.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

      # Sentiment Drift Detection
      drift = detect_sentiment_drift(category.reviews)
      if drift:
          boost_new_sentiment_excerpts(weighted_reviews)

      # Select Excerpt
      excerpt = select_excerpt(weighted_reviews, category.aspects)

      #Display
      display_excerpt(excerpt)
```

This expanded system aims to provide a more dynamic, relevant, and nuanced review summary that reflects evolving consumer opinions and prioritizes key product aspects. The weighting factors provide a mechanism for adapting to changing trends and ensuring that the summary accurately represents the current state of consumer sentiment.
