## Dynamic Service Bundling & Predictive Dispatch

**Concept:** Leverage real-time location data and service provider capabilities to dynamically bundle services and proactively dispatch providers *before* a user explicitly requests them, anticipating needs based on user behavior and contextual data.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   User Profile Data: Historical service requests, stated preferences, demographic information.
    *   Contextual Data: Time of day, day of week, weather conditions, local events (sports games, concerts), traffic patterns, publicly available social media data (sentiment analysis regarding needs – e.g., “stuck in traffic and need a jumpstart”).
    *   Service Provider Data: Capabilities (plumbing, electrical, towing, food delivery, etc.), current location, availability, estimated time to arrival (ETA), pricing structure, skill ratings/certifications, vehicle type.
    *   IoT Data: Integration with smart home devices (e.g., a smart thermostat indicating a potential HVAC issue), vehicle diagnostics (flat tire detected, low oil).
*   **Predictive Engine:**
    *   Machine Learning Model: Trained on historical data to identify patterns and predict service needs.  Model factors: User behavior, contextual data, service provider availability.
    *   Scoring System: Assigns a “need score” to each user based on the predictive model. Higher scores indicate a higher probability of needing a service.
    *   Thresholds: Configurable thresholds for need scores trigger proactive service bundling and dispatch.
*   **Dynamic Service Bundling:**
    *   Service Combination Logic: Identifies complementary services based on user profile and context.  Example: User frequently requests car washes and oil changes – bundle these into a monthly maintenance package.
    *   Personalized Offers: Creates customized service bundles tailored to individual user needs and preferences.
    *   Real-time Pricing: Dynamic pricing adjustments based on demand, provider availability, and bundle composition.
*   **Proactive Dispatch:**
    *   Geofencing: Defines virtual boundaries around areas with high predicted service demand.
    *   Provider Staging:  Dispatches service providers to areas within geofences *before* a user request is received.
    *   Automated Routing:  Optimizes provider routes to minimize response times.
*   **User Interface (Mobile App):**
    *   “Anticipated Needs” Section:  Displays proactively suggested service bundles.
    *   “Nearby Providers” Map: Shows staged providers in the user’s vicinity.
    *   One-Tap Request:  Allows users to instantly request a pre-bundled service.
    *   Opt-in/Opt-out Control:  Users can disable proactive dispatch or customize bundle preferences.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Dispatch Logic):**

```
FUNCTION ProactiveDispatch(user, currentTime)
  needScore = CalculateNeedScore(user, currentTime)

  IF needScore > threshold THEN
    potentialServices = IdentifyPotentialServices(user)

    availableProviders = FindAvailableProviders(potentialServices, user.location)

    IF availableProviders.count > 0 THEN
      closestProvider = FindClosestProvider(availableProviders, user.location)

      IF closestProvider.distance < stagingDistance THEN
        stageProvider(closestProvider, user.location) // Dispatch to staging area
        SendNotificationToUser("We've staged a provider nearby for potential needs.")
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION stageProvider(provider, userLocation)
  provider.status = "STAGED"
  provider.stagingLocation = userLocation
  // Update provider's location on map
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateNeedScore(user, currentTime)
  // Machine learning model to assess need score
  score =  historicalRequestFrequency(user) * 0.4 +
           contextualFactor(currentTime) * 0.3 +
           userPreferenceScore(user) * 0.3

  RETURN score
END FUNCTION
