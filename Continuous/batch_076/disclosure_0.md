## Dynamic Interest Synthesis from Multi-Modal Sensor Data

**Concept:** Expand user interest determination beyond activity data (browsing, purchases) to *real-time* sensor data from the user’s device and environment to create a constantly evolving, highly nuanced interest profile. This moves beyond declared or historical preferences to *predicted* intent.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Input:** Data streams from device sensors:
    *   GPS (location, speed, direction)
    *   Microphone (ambient sound analysis – music genres, speech keywords, environmental sounds)
    *   Camera (image/video analysis – object recognition, scene understanding, facial expressions)
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope (activity recognition – walking, running, driving, stationary)
    *   Bluetooth/WiFi (proximity to known POIs – restaurants, stores, landmarks)
*   **Processing:** Real-time data streaming and pre-processing (noise reduction, feature extraction).  Sensor fusion to create a unified environmental context.
*   **Output:** Structured data representing the user’s current activity, location, and surrounding environment.

**2.  Interest Inference Engine:**

*   **Input:** Structured sensor data, historical user activity data (from existing systems), and a knowledge graph containing information about POIs, activities, and interests.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Activity Recognition:** Identify user activities based on sensor data (e.g., “user is attending a jazz concert” based on location, sound analysis, and accelerometer data).
    *   **Contextual Analysis:**  Interpret the meaning of activities within the user’s current context (e.g., attending a jazz concert after visiting an art museum suggests an interest in arts and culture).
    *   **Interest Synthesis:** Combine contextual analysis with historical data to dynamically update the user’s interest profile. Employ Bayesian networks to model the relationships between activities, contexts, and interests.  For example:

        ```pseudocode
        // Update Interest Profile
        function update_interest_profile(sensor_data, historical_data, knowledge_graph):
          activity = recognize_activity(sensor_data)
          context = analyze_context(activity, sensor_data, knowledge_graph)
          interest_update = calculate_interest_update(activity, context, historical_data)
          user_interest_profile = update_profile(user_interest_profile, interest_update)
          return user_interest_profile
        ```

*   **Output:**  A dynamically updated user interest profile represented as a weighted graph of interests. Weights reflect the strength of the user’s interest based on real-time and historical data.

**3.  Proactive POI Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:**  Dynamically updated user interest profile, current location, mapped route (if available), and knowledge graph.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **POI Filtering:**  Identify POIs in the vicinity of the user that match the user’s interests.
    *   **Route Deviation Analysis:**  Calculate the potential route deviation required to visit each POI.
    *   **Proactive Suggestion:**  Predict POIs the user might be interested in *before* they explicitly request them. Rank POIs based on interest level, route deviation, and estimated travel time.  Implement a “serendipity factor” to occasionally suggest POIs slightly outside the user’s established interests.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of proactive POI suggestions.

**4.  Privacy Controls:**

*   Granular control over which sensors are used for interest inference.
*   Ability to review and edit the inferred interest profile.
*   Option to disable real-time interest inference altogether.



This system goes beyond simply reacting to user requests; it anticipates user needs based on a richer understanding of their current context and evolving interests. It allows for far more personalized and relevant POI suggestions, enhancing the user experience.
