## Adaptive Channel Hopping with Predictive Congestion Avoidance

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-radio wireless node (similar to existing mesh stations/APs) with at least three radios – primary communication, dedicated monitoring, and fast-switching reserve. High-speed switching circuitry for radio selection.
*   **Software:** Embedded software with machine learning (ML) capabilities. Core components: Channel Monitor, Prediction Engine, Switching Controller, and Data Aggregator.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond static or reactive channel selection. It aims to *predict* congestion before it happens and proactively hop to a less burdened channel. It’s more than just ‘listen before talk’ – it anticipates.

1.  **Channel Monitoring:** The dedicated monitoring radio continuously scans multiple channels (primary, adjacent, and potentially further). It collects data on signal strength (RSSI), noise floor, channel utilization (percentage of time the channel is occupied), and packet collision rates. Data is timestamped.
2.  **Prediction Engine:**  This is the core innovation. It’s a trained ML model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network - RNN or Long Short-Term Memory - LSTM) that analyzes historical channel monitoring data. The model learns patterns indicative of impending congestion. Key features input to the model:
    *   Time of day
    *   Day of week
    *   Recent channel utilization trends
    *   Packet collision rates
    *   Neighboring AP/station activity (estimated from beacon signals)
3.  **Switching Controller:** Based on the Prediction Engine’s output (a ‘congestion risk score’ for each channel), the Switching Controller initiates a channel hop. A hop is triggered when the risk score for the current channel exceeds a predefined threshold.  The Controller selects the channel with the *lowest* predicted risk.
4.  **Fast Channel Switching:** The reserve radio is pre-tuned to the predicted optimal channel. Switching occurs *before* significant congestion develops, minimizing disruption. Seamless handover is achieved through buffering of in-flight packets.
5.  **Data Aggregation & Model Retraining:** Each node aggregates channel monitoring data and sends it (periodically) to a central server (or distributed network). This data is used to retrain the ML model, improving its predictive accuracy over time. The model can be personalized per node/geographic area for improved performance.
6.  **Beacon Enhancement**: APs/Stations beacon with not just standard info, but a 'congestion score' to share their local load to nearby devices.

**Pseudocode (Switching Controller):**

```
// Variables:
currentChannel = InitialChannel;
congestionThreshold = 0.7;  //Example Value
dataBuffer = Empty;
predictionEngine = InitializedMLModel();

loop:
  monitoringData = ChannelMonitor.getData();
  congestionRisk = predictionEngine.predictCongestion(monitoringData, currentChannel);

  if congestionRisk > congestionThreshold:
    newChannel = predictionEngine.selectOptimalChannel(monitoringData);
    //Fast channel switch - prep reserve radio, transition traffic
    switchChannel(newChannel);
    currentChannel = newChannel;

  sendData(dataBuffer, currentChannel);
  dataBuffer = Empty;
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **QoS Awareness:** Integrate Quality of Service (QoS) requirements into the channel selection algorithm. Prioritize channels suitable for delay-sensitive applications (e.g., voice/video).
*   **Multi-Hop Coordination:**  Coordinate channel hopping among neighboring nodes to avoid interference and optimize overall network capacity.
*    **Jamming/Interference Detection:**  Extend the Prediction Engine to identify and avoid channels experiencing external interference (e.g., from microwave ovens or other wireless devices).
