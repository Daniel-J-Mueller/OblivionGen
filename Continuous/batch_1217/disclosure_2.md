## Dynamic Expertise Layer & Temporal Question Weighting

**Concept:** Augment the location-based question/answer system with a dynamic expertise layer that prioritizes question routing not only by subject matter *and* location, but also by *temporal relevance* of expertise. Essentially, establish a 'freshness' score for user expertise alongside traditional reputation metrics.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `UserExpertiseRecord`: `{ userID: string, expertiseTags: [string], lastActiveDate: date, expertiseScore: float, locationHistory: [geoCoordinates] }`
    *   `QuestionRecord`: `{ questionID: string, poiID: string, timestamp: date, expertiseTags: [string], answerCount: int, freshnessWeight: float }`
*   **New Modules:**
    *   *Expertise Decay Engine:*  Monitors `UserExpertiseRecord.lastActiveDate` and adjusts `expertiseScore` downwards over time if a user hasn't actively contributed (answered questions, confirmed useful responses, etc.).  Formula: `newExpertiseScore = baseExpertiseScore * decayFactor ^ (currentTime - lastActiveDate)` (where `decayFactor` is a tunable parameter, e.g., 0.99).
    *   *Temporal Relevance Filter:*  Within the question routing algorithm, a filter evaluates the `freshnessWeight` of potential answerers. This weight is calculated based on the time elapsed since their last relevant contribution, giving higher priority to those who have recently demonstrated expertise in the specific `expertiseTags` associated with the question.  The `freshnessWeight` is applied as a multiplier to the `expertiseScore`.
    *    *POI-Specific Expertise Profiles*:  Instead of a global expertise score, each Point of Interest maintains a localized expertise ranking.  User expertise is weighted higher for POIs theyâ€™ve frequently visited or contributed to questions about.

*   **Algorithm (Question Routing):**

    1.  Receive `QuestionRecord` (including `expertiseTags` and `poiID`).
    2.  Query for all users within predefined proximity of `poiID`.
    3.  Filter users based on matching `expertiseTags` (partial matches receive reduced weight).
    4.  For each matching user:
        *   Retrieve `UserExpertiseRecord`.
        *   Calculate `freshnessWeight` based on `lastActiveDate` and `expertiseTags`.
        *   Calculate `adjustedExpertiseScore = expertiseScore * freshnessWeight`.
        *   Add user to candidate list, sorted by `adjustedExpertiseScore` (descending).
    5.  Route question to the top-ranked candidate.
    6. If no match above a threshold, expand radius and/or relax expertise matching criteria.

*   **Client-Side Integration:**
    *   Display a 'freshness' indicator alongside user names in the question/answer interface. This could be a simple visual cue (e.g., a colored badge) or a timestamp indicating their last contribution.
    *   Allow users to filter questions by 'expertise freshness'.

*   **Pseudocode (Expertise Decay Engine - Background Process):**

```
FOREACH user IN userDatabase:
    currentTime = getCurrentTime()
    lastActiveDate = user.lastActiveDate

    timeElapsed = currentTime - lastActiveDate

    IF timeElapsed > threshold:  //e.g. 30 days
        decayFactor = 0.95 //Adjustable value.  Higher = slower decay
        user.expertiseScore = user.expertiseScore * decayFactor
        saveUser(user)
```

**Rationale:**  Traditional reputation systems can become stale.  Experts change, information evolves, and local conditions vary.  Prioritizing recently active expertise enhances the quality and relevance of answers, improves user engagement, and fosters a more dynamic knowledge base within the location-based community.  The POI-specific expertise profiles cater to the localized nature of the system.
