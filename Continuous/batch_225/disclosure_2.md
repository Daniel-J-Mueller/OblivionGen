## Dynamic Trust Network for Micro-Transactions & Reputation

**Concept:** Extend the verification concept to build a decentralized trust network fueled by micro-transactions and dynamic reputation scores, moving beyond simple payment confirmation.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Trust Tokens (TT):**  A cryptocurrency/blockchain-based token used for micro-transactions within the network.  These are *not* intended as a general currency, but solely for facilitating trust-building within the system.  Initial distribution is based on network participation (merchant/customer account creation, initial transaction).
*   **Reputation Engine:** A dynamic scoring system that assigns a "Trust Score" to each user (merchant & customer).  This score is influenced by transaction history, user feedback (verified ratings), and TT staking/burning (see below).
*   **Verification Relay:** A distributed network (potentially leveraging existing blockchain infrastructure) that securely relays verification data and TT transactions.
*   **Mobile SDK:** Software Development Kit for integrating the system into mobile applications (customer & merchant).

**II. Transaction Flow & Trust Score Adjustment:**

1.  **Initiation:** Customer selects a merchant (as in the base patent).
2.  **Payment Request:** Merchant requests payment via the mobile app.
3.  **TT Stake (Optional):** *Before* payment is sent, the *customer* can optionally stake a small amount of TT.  This signals increased confidence in the transaction and boosts the merchant's temporary Trust Score. This stake is returned to the customer upon successful transaction *and* positive feedback.
4.  **Payment Transfer:** Payment is initiated.
5.  **Verification Data Transfer:** The verification data (image, code, etc. - as in the base patent) is transferred.
6.  **Feedback & TT Burning/Return:**
    *   *Customer provides feedback (rating/review) through the app.*
    *   *If feedback is positive:* The staked TT is *returned* to the customer, and the merchant’s Trust Score is permanently increased.
    *   *If feedback is negative:* The staked TT is *burned* (removed from circulation), and the merchant’s Trust Score is decreased. The customer receives a partial refund of the original transaction amount, proportionally to the decrease in the merchant’s Trust Score.
7.  **Trust Score Propagation:** The updated merchant’s Trust Score is propagated across the network.

**III. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Mobile App (Customer)
function initiateTransaction(merchantId, amount):
  stakeAmount = prompt("Stake TT to increase trust? (optional)")
  if stakeAmount > 0:
    stakeTT(merchantId, stakeAmount)
  transferPayment(merchantId, amount)
  verificationData = receiveVerificationData()
  provideFeedback(verificationData)

// Mobile App (Merchant)
function requestPayment(customerId, amount):
  transferVerificationData()

//Verification Relay
function receiveVerificationData(merchantId, customerId):
  //Securely relays verification data
  //Records transaction details for Trust Score calculation

function calculateTrustScore(merchantId):
  //Factors: transaction volume, feedback ratings, TT staked/burned
  return trustScore

//Trust Token Contract (Blockchain)
function stakeTT(merchantId, amount):
  //Records stake transaction
  //Locks tokens

function burnTT(merchantId, amount):
  //Destroys tokens
  //Records burn transaction
```

**IV. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard mobile device (smartphone/tablet).
*   Optional: Secure Element (SE) or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for enhanced security of TT transactions.
*   Network connectivity (WiFi/Cellular).

**V. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Dynamic Verification Data:** Instead of static images, use frequently changing codes or data streams.
*   **Trust Score-Based Discounts:** Merchants with high Trust Scores can offer discounts to customers.
*   **Decentralized Dispute Resolution:** Implement a decentralized system for resolving disputes between customers and merchants.
*   **Integration with Social Networks:** Allow customers to share their positive experiences with merchants on social media.
