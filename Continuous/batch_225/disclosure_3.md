## Dynamic Resonance Tuning & Spatial Power Mapping

**Concept:** A charging station capable of not just selecting an antenna, but *dynamically altering the resonant frequency* of each antenna, and mapping the resulting power density in 3D space to optimize charging efficiency and coverage.

**Specifications:**

*   **Antenna Array:** A dense grid of microstrip patch antennas (minimum 100 individual antennas) embedded within the charging surface (and potentially extending slightly above it – see ‘Surface Topology’ below). Each antenna must be individually addressable.
*   **Tunable Components:** Each antenna incorporates a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) based tunable capacitor or varactor diode to adjust its resonant frequency. Frequency range: 100 MHz - 1 GHz, with resolution of 1 MHz.
*   **3D Power Mapping System:**
    *   **Sensor Array:** An array of miniature RF power sensors (e.g., Schottky diodes with analog front-ends) positioned *above* the charging surface, creating a 3D grid. Sensor density: 5cm spacing.
    *   **Automated Positioning System:** A small robotic arm or gantry system to move the sensors through the 3D space above the charging surface.
    *   **Data Acquisition:** High-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) to capture the RF power readings from the sensors.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Processor:** A high-performance embedded processor (e.g., ARM Cortex-A72 or equivalent).
    *   **Software:**
        *   **Resonance Tuning Algorithm:** An algorithm to sweep the resonant frequency of each antenna and identify the frequencies that produce the strongest power output at a given location.
        *   **Spatial Mapping Algorithm:**  An algorithm to create a 3D map of the power density across the charging surface based on the data from the sensors.
        *   **Device Detection:** Algorithm using the 3D map to identify the presence and approximate location of devices to be charged.
        *   **Adaptive Beamforming:** Algorithm to select and tune antennas to maximize power transfer to the detected device, accounting for its position and orientation.
*   **Surface Topology:** A slightly concave charging surface with micro-lenses or reflectors positioned above each antenna.  These lenses focus and steer the RF energy, increasing the effective range and precision of the charging.  The concave shape helps to contain the RF field.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wireless communication (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy) to exchange information with the device (if supported) about its charging requirements and antenna operating frequency.
*   **Power Supply:** High-efficiency power amplifiers to drive the antenna array.  Must support individual antenna power control.
*   **Shielding:** Comprehensive electromagnetic shielding to minimize interference and ensure compliance with safety regulations.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Beamforming):**

```
// Initialization
Create 3D Power Map (empty)
Initialize Antenna Array

// Device Detection & Localization
Scan area with low-power RF signals
Analyze reflections to identify device presence & approximate location
Refine location using 3D power map data

// Adaptive Beamforming
For each antenna:
    Set initial resonant frequency
    Transmit low-power signal
    Measure received power at device location (using device feedback or 3D power map)
    Adjust resonant frequency to maximize received power
    Repeat until optimal frequency is found

Select subset of antennas with strongest signal strength
Adjust power levels of selected antennas to focus energy on device
Continuously monitor power transfer rate
Dynamically adjust antenna selection & power levels to maintain optimal charging efficiency
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems primarily focus on *selecting* from a pre-defined antenna array. This design adds a dynamic tuning element, optimizing *each* antenna's performance in real-time, combined with a full 3D mapping system. The combination allows for drastically improved charging efficiency, coverage, and the ability to charge multiple devices simultaneously with high performance. It is not about *where* the device is, but about *how* the power is sculpted to the device.
