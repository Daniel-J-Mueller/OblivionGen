## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Delivery Tag

**Concept:** Expand the “modifiable display area” beyond visual changes to incorporate localized haptic feedback. The delivery tag will not only visually change (as per the patent) but also *feel* different to the touch, conveying information about delivery status and potential anomalies.

**Specifications:**

*   **Tag Structure:** Maintain a structure capable of attaching to a package. Integrate a thin layer of shape-memory alloy (SMA) beneath the modifiable display area. This SMA layer will form a grid of individually controllable 'bumps' or textures.
*   **Haptic Actuation:** Each SMA element will be individually addressable via the delivery management module. Applying an electric current will cause the SMA to change shape, creating a raised bump or altering the surface texture.
*   **Display Area Integration:** The modifiable display area (lenticular display or similar) will be mounted *above* the SMA grid, allowing visual changes without obstructing haptic feedback.
*   **Delivery Management Module Enhancement:** The delivery management module must be expanded to include haptic pattern generation and control. This will involve a lookup table mapping delivery status/anomalies to specific haptic patterns.
*   **Haptic Patterns:**
    *   **Normal Delivery:** Smooth surface, no raised areas.
    *   **Geospatial Boundary Breach (Minor):**  A brief, localized 'pulse' of small bumps around the perimeter of the tag.
    *   **Geospatial Boundary Breach (Major/Prolonged):** A sustained, textured pattern covering a significant portion of the tag. Perhaps a repeating 'warning' symbol formed by raised bumps.
    *   **Delivery Confirmation:** A distinct, repeating 'check mark' pattern formed by raised bumps.
    *   **Tamper Detection:**  A rapid, randomized pattern of bumps to indicate potential package interference.
*   **Power Source:** Implement a low-power, flexible battery integrated into the tag structure. Consider energy harvesting (e.g., vibration) to supplement battery life.
*    **Fluid Integration:** The existing fluid emission system will be maintained. The fluid can be a scent, or a conductive liquid to enable capacitive touch input, or both. The capacitive touch would allow a user to 'confirm' the delivery by touching the tag, changing the haptic feedback to the 'delivery confirmation' pattern.
*   **Pseudocode (Delivery Management Module):**

```
function updateTagState(locationInfo, deliveryRange, fluidDetected) {

  if (locationInfo outside deliveryRange) {
    breachCount++
    if (breachCount > threshold) {
      hapticPattern = "Major Breach"
      fluidEmission = true; // activate fluid emission as confirmation
    } else {
      hapticPattern = "Minor Breach"
    }

  } else {
    hapticPattern = "Normal"
  }

  if (fluidDetected && hapticPattern != "Normal") {
    // Package was outside of boundary and a leak was detected
    hapticPattern = "Anomaly Confirmed"; // unique tactile feedback
  }

  if (deliveryConfirmed) {
    hapticPattern = "Delivery Confirmed";
  }
  
  sendHapticCommand(hapticPattern);
  sendVisualCommand(barcodeVersion); // existing visual update
}

function sendHapticCommand(pattern) {
  // iterate through SMA grid elements
  for each element in grid {
      if pattern requires element to be raised {
          applyCurrent(element, HIGH); // activate SMA element
      } else {
          applyCurrent(element, LOW); // deactivate SMA element
      }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** Combines visual and haptic feedback, providing a richer information channel. Adds a layer of "physical" confirmation of delivery status/anomalies, reducing reliance solely on visual or electronic indicators. The integration of fluid emission with haptic feedback creates multi-modal sensory confirmation.
