## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Extend adaptation beyond individual user characteristics to dynamically model and synthesize acoustic environments for improved speech recognition. The core idea is to capture “acoustic fingerprints” of locations and blend them with user-specific adaptations to create a more robust and accurate speech recognition model.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate data from multiple sensors:
    *   High-fidelity microphone array (capturing spatial audio).
    *   Ambient light sensor (correlated with indoor/outdoor environments).
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope (detecting movement/vibration – indicative of transport/activity).
    *   Optional: Barometer (altitude/weather conditions).
*   **Acoustic Fingerprint Extraction:**  Process sensor data to generate an “Acoustic Scene Vector” (ASV).
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Compute features from audio data:  Reverberation time (RT60), background noise spectral density, echo characteristics.
    *   **Environmental Metadata:**  Combine audio features with metadata from other sensors (light level, movement, etc.).
    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:**  Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or similar techniques to reduce ASV dimensionality while preserving key characteristics.

**2.  Acoustic Scene Composition Engine:**

*   **Scene Database:** Maintain a database of pre-recorded/synthesized acoustic scenes (e.g., “busy coffee shop”, “quiet office”, “moving vehicle”).  Each scene is represented by its ASV.
*   **Real-time Scene Analysis:**  Analyze incoming audio to estimate the current ASV.
*   **Scene Blending:**  Combine the estimated ASV with the pre-recorded scene ASVs to create a blended acoustic model.  This could be a weighted average or a more sophisticated blending algorithm.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** The ASV weights will change in real time, based on user voice data.

**3.  Speech Recognition Integration:**

*   **Feature Transformation:** Transform speech features using the blended acoustic model before feeding them to the speech recognition engine.
*   **Model Adaptation:** Fine-tune the speech recognition model using the blended acoustic model as an additional adaptation layer.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Incorporate the confidence score of the acoustic scene analysis into the overall speech recognition confidence score.

**Pseudocode (Scene Blending):**

```
function blend_acoustic_scenes(current_asv, scene_database, user_adaptation_data):
  // Retrieve top N most similar scenes from the database based on distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance)
  similar_scenes = get_similar_scenes(current_asv, scene_database, N=3)

  // Calculate weights based on similarity (higher similarity = higher weight)
  weights = calculate_weights(current_asv, similar_scenes)

  // Combine acoustic models using weighted averaging
  blended_model = weighted_average(similar_scenes, weights)

  // Incorporate user adaptation data
  final_model = combine_models(blended_model, user_adaptation_data)

  return final_model
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Edge AI capable Processor (for real-time ASV extraction and scene blending).
*   High-quality microphone array.
*   Sensor suite (light, accelerometer, barometer).

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved speech recognition in noisy and complex environments.
*   Personalized voice assistants that adapt to the user’s surroundings.
*   Enhanced voice control for IoT devices.
*   Acoustic profiling of spaces for automated environmental control.
