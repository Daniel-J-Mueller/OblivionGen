## Adaptive Fragment Prioritization & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Leverage client-side AI to predictively buffer *not* the next fragment, but the most *critical* frames within upcoming fragments, prioritizing based on visual importance and predicted user attention. This moves beyond simple sequential downloading to a dynamic, AI-driven prioritization system.

**Specs:**

*   **Visual Importance Engine:** An on-device AI model (likely a convolutional neural network) trained to assess the visual importance of individual frames within a media segment. Factors considered: motion vectors, scene changes, object detection (faces, key elements), color saturation, and perceptual saliency maps. Output: a "visual importance score" (0.0 - 1.0) for each frame.
*   **Attention Prediction Module:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) model tracking user viewing patterns (eye-tracking if available, otherwise proxy data like mouse movement, touch events, and dwell time). This module predicts which areas of the screen the user is *likely* to focus on in upcoming frames.
*   **Dynamic Fragment Partitioning:** Incoming media fragments are logically subdivided into “priority blocks.”  A priority block comprises frames with high visual importance *and* predicted user attention.
*   **Adaptive Download Scheduler:**  The download scheduler prioritizes priority blocks over other parts of the fragment. This means critical frames are downloaded first, enabling faster rendering of key content.
*   **Buffering Strategy:** The client maintains a dynamic buffer. The buffer is not filled sequentially. Rather, it is filled with the highest-priority frames available. The system aims to *always* have a few seconds of the *most visually important* content buffered, even if it doesn’t have the entire next fragment.
*   **Quality Level Adaptation:**  If bandwidth is constrained, the system can dynamically adjust the quality level of lower-priority frames *without* impacting the perceived visual quality of the most important content.
*   **Server Integration:** The server provides metadata alongside the media fragments. This metadata includes pre-calculated visual importance scores (as a fallback or hint for the client AI) and scene change detection information.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Download Scheduler):**

```
// Assume 'fragment' is the current media fragment being processed
// 'priority_blocks' is a list of frame ranges representing high-priority content
// 'low_priority_blocks' are the remaining frames

function schedule_download(fragment, priority_blocks, low_priority_blocks):

  // Create a download queue
  queue = []

  // Add priority blocks to the queue (sorted by frame index)
  for block in priority_blocks:
    queue.append(block)

  // Add low-priority blocks to the queue
  for block in low_priority_blocks:
    queue.append(block)

  // Download loop
  while queue is not empty:
    block = queue.pop(0) //Get the first block
    download_block(block)  // Asynchronously download the block.
    
    //If bandwidth is critical, throttle low priority downloads
    if (bandwidth < threshold):
        throttle(low_priority_blocks)

  //Mark fragment as ready for playback
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires on-device AI processing capability (Neural Engine, dedicated AI accelerator).
*   Sufficient RAM to store dynamically prioritized buffer.
*   Fast storage to support asynchronous download and playback.
