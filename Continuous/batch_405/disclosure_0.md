## Dynamic Verification Context with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system extending stateless verification by incorporating continuous behavioral biometric analysis alongside the existing code-based verification. This creates a multi-factor authentication system without requiring explicit user action beyond initial account setup and normal device usage.

**Components:**

*   **Baseline Establishment Module:** During initial account creation (or after a user opts-in), this module collects behavioral biometrics from the user's interaction with the client device (mouse movements, typing speed/rhythm, scrolling patterns, touch pressure, etc.). This data forms a personalized baseline profile.  Data is *not* stored directly; instead, a feature vector is derived and used for comparison.
*   **Real-Time Behavioral Analysis Module:** Continuously monitors user interaction with the client device.  Extracts the same feature set as the baseline module.
*   **Verification Scoring Engine:** Compares the real-time feature set to the established baseline.  Calculates a “Verification Score” based on the similarity.  A threshold is set; scores above the threshold indicate legitimate user activity.
*   **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:** The Verification Score threshold is dynamically adjusted based on contextual factors:
    *   **Transaction Value:** Higher value transactions require a higher Verification Score.
    *   **Location:** Unusual locations (based on IP address or GPS) increase the threshold.
    *   **Time of Day:**  Unusual activity times increase the threshold.
    *   **Device:**  New or unrecognized devices dramatically increase the threshold.
*   **Code Verification Integration:** The existing code-based verification (via SMS, email, etc.) acts as a fallback or secondary confirmation when the Verification Score is borderline or falls below the threshold.
*   **Client-Side Pre-Processing:**  A significant portion of behavioral data collection and feature extraction is performed *on the client device* to minimize data transmission and enhance privacy.



**Pseudocode (Verification Process):**

```
FUNCTION VerifyUser(userData, transactionData, deviceData):
    // 1. Client-side behavioral data collection & feature extraction
    clientFeatures = GetClientBehavioralFeatures()

    // 2. Transmit features to server (encrypted)
    SendFeaturesToServer(clientFeatures, userData)

    // 3. Server-side Verification
    userBaseline = RetrieveUserBaseline(userData)
    similarityScore = CalculateSimilarity(clientFeatures, userBaseline)

    // 4. Contextual Threshold Adjustment
    adjustedThreshold = CalculateAdjustedThreshold(transactionData, deviceData)

    // 5. Verification Decision
    IF similarityScore >= adjustedThreshold THEN
        RETURN "Verified"
    ELSE
        // Initiate code-based verification
        InitiateCodeVerification(userData)
        IF CodeVerificationSuccessful() THEN
            RETURN "Verified (with code)"
        ELSE
            RETURN "Verification Failed"
        ENDIF
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User interacts with client application.
2.  Client application collects behavioral data and computes feature vectors.
3.  Feature vectors are encrypted and sent to the server.
4.  Server retrieves the user's baseline profile.
5.  Similarity is calculated, and the threshold is dynamically adjusted.
6.  Verification decision is made. If inconclusive, code-based verification is triggered.

**Privacy Considerations:** Behavioral data is anonymized and aggregated whenever possible.  Users have control over the types of data collected and can opt-out at any time.  Data is stored securely with appropriate encryption and access controls.
