## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple signal processing *on* the audio to actively *reconstruct* the acoustic environment, and then dynamically tailor processing based on that reconstruction. The core idea is to create a virtual ‘acoustic model’ of the space the audio originates from, allowing for more intelligent and nuanced signal manipulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+), high-fidelity ADC, dedicated DSP/FPGA co-processor. A small IMU (inertial measurement unit) integrated within the device.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:** Uses beamforming, time-delay estimation, and potentially frequency-domain techniques to identify sound source locations and reflections.  IMU data assists in compensating for device movement during mapping.  Output:  A probabilistic 3D point cloud representing the acoustic scene.
    *   **Material Identification:** Utilizing machine learning (trained on a database of acoustic signatures), analyze reflections to *infer* surface materials (e.g., carpet, wall, glass).  Output: Material classification for surfaces within the acoustic scene.
    *   **Virtual Source Deconvolution:** Deconstruct the received signal into its constituent sources, separating direct sound from reflections and reverberation. Output:  Individual source signals.
    *   **Dynamic Processing Profile Selection:** Based on the reconstructed acoustic scene (material types, source locations, virtual source deconvolution output), select an optimal signal processing profile. This profile isn’t limited to noise cancellation/reduction; it can include customized EQ, spatial audio effects, and targeted reverb control.
    *   **Adaptive Beamforming/Spatial Filtering:**  Focus processing on the desired audio source while suppressing noise and interference from other sources, dynamically adjusting the beamforming pattern based on the reconstructed acoustic scene.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Processing Profile Selection):**

```
// Input: Acoustic Scene Data (3D Point Cloud, Material Types)
//        Source Signal Data (Deconvolved Source Signals)

function select_processing_profile(acoustic_scene, source_signal) {

    // 1. Scene Analysis
    room_size = estimate_room_size(acoustic_scene);
    reverberation_level = calculate_reverberation(acoustic_scene);
    dominant_material = identify_dominant_material(acoustic_scene);

    // 2. Source Analysis
    source_type = classify_source_type(source_signal); // Speech, Music, Environmental Noise
    source_distance = estimate_source_distance(source_signal);

    // 3. Profile Selection Logic
    if (source_type == "Speech") {
        if (room_size == "Small" && reverberation_level == "High") {
            profile = "Speech_SmallRoom_HighReverb"; // Aggressive noise reduction, de-reverberation
        } else if (room_size == "Large" && reverberation_level == "Low") {
            profile = "Speech_LargeRoom_LowReverb"; // Minimal processing, focus on clarity
        } else {
            profile = "Speech_Default"; // Balanced processing
        }
    } else if (source_type == "Music") {
        if (dominant_material == "Hard Surfaces") {
            profile = "Music_HardRoom"; // Add warmth, reduce harshness
        } else {
            profile = "Music_Default"; // Transparent processing
        }
    } else { // Environmental Noise
        profile = "Noise_Suppression_Aggressive";
    }

    return profile;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Advanced Conferencing:** Create immersive telepresence experiences by accurately recreating the acoustic environment of the remote participant’s location.
*   **Smart Home Audio:** Optimize audio playback based on room acoustics and listener preferences.
*   **AR/VR Audio:** Generate realistic and spatially accurate soundscapes for augmented and virtual reality applications.
*   **Hearing Aids:** Personalized audio processing based on the user’s environment.
