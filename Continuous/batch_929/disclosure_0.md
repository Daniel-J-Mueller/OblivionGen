## Adaptive Partitioning & Predictive Prefetching for Operation Record Streams

**Concept:** Extend the existing OR publishing framework with dynamic data partitioning and a predictive prefetching mechanism to reduce latency and improve throughput, especially for read-heavy workloads. This builds upon the idea of partitioning data objects but introduces *adaptive* partitioning based on observed access patterns and prefetches ORs *before* they are requested.

**Specs:**

**1. Adaptive Partitioning Service (APS):**

*   **Function:** Monitors OR stream access patterns across data objects. Dynamically adjusts the partitioning scheme (number and boundaries of partitions) for each object based on real-time read/write ratios and access skew.
*   **Metrics Collected:**
    *   Read/Write ratio per partition.
    *   Access frequency per partition.
    *   Latency per partition.
    *   Partition size.
*   **Algorithm:** A reinforcement learning agent observes the metrics and iteratively adjusts the partitioning scheme to minimize average read latency.  Reward function prioritizes minimizing read latency while considering the overhead of repartitioning.
*   **Implementation:** Microservice deployed alongside PCCs, communicating via a message queue (e.g., Kafka).

**2. Predictive OR Prefetcher:**

*   **Function:** Predicts which ORs will be requested based on historical access patterns and prefetches them to client-side caches or edge nodes.
*   **Prediction Model:**  Utilizes a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM network) trained on OR request sequences. Model predicts the probability of a particular OR being requested within a specific time window.
*   **Prefetch Trigger:**  If the predicted probability exceeds a configurable threshold, the OR is prefetched to the clientâ€™s cache or an edge node.
*   **Cache Invalidation:**  Cache invalidation mechanism based on write operations to ensure data consistency.  Uses a combination of time-to-live (TTL) and write-through caching.
*   **Implementation:** Integrated into the OR submitter and the durable log publisher. OR submitter tags ORs with prefetch hints. Publisher delivers ORs with these hints to caching layers.

**3.  Modified OR Submitter:**

*   **Function:**  Extends existing functionality to include prefetch hints in OR metadata and facilitate prefetching.
*   **New Metadata Field:** `prefetch_score`: A numerical value indicating the probability of the OR being requested. Generated by the Predictive OR Prefetcher.
*   **Batching Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjusts OR batch size based on `prefetch_score`.  Higher `prefetch_score` ORs are prioritized for earlier transmission.

**4.  Modified Durable Log Publisher:**

*   **Function:**  Modifies existing replication logic to prioritize replication of ORs with high `prefetch_score`.
*   **Replication Prioritization:**  Uses a weighted round-robin algorithm for replication, giving higher weight to ORs with higher `prefetch_score`.

**Pseudocode - Adaptive Partitioning Service:**

```
// Initialization
partitions = initial_partition_scheme
RL_agent = new ReinforcementLearningAgent()

// Main Loop
while (true):
  metrics = collect_metrics()
  reward = calculate_reward(metrics)
  next_partition_scheme = RL_agent.choose_action(metrics, reward)

  if (next_partition_scheme != partitions):
    repartition_data(partitions, next_partition_scheme)
    partitions = next_partition_scheme
```

**Pseudocode - Predictive OR Prefetcher:**

```
// Training Phase:
train_model(historical_request_sequences)

// Prediction Phase:
request_sequence = current_request_sequence
predicted_probabilities = predict_next_OR_probabilities(request_sequence)

// Prefetching Logic:
for each OR in predicted_probabilities:
  if (OR.probability > prefetch_threshold):
    prefetch_OR(OR)
```
