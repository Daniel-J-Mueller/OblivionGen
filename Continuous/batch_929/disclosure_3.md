## Dynamic Resource Allocation based on Workload ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Bursting

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Instead of solely relying on historical utilization data *of a single workload* to predict burstable instance suitability, we create a ‘shadow’ workload profile. This shadow is a composite, statistically derived profile built from the collective behaviors of similar workloads (defined by tagging/metadata – see Section III). This allows for more robust prediction, particularly for new or infrequently run workloads lacking sufficient historical data.  Furthermore, we introduce ‘predictive bursting’ – proactively scaling resources *before* a burst is detected, leveraging the shadow workload’s predicted behavior.

**II. System Architecture:**

1.  **Workload Profiler:**  Monitors resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O, network) of all running workloads. Collects time-series data.
2.  **Workload Tagging/Metadata Service:**  Allows assignment of descriptive tags to workloads (e.g., ‘image processing’, ‘database – read heavy’, ‘web server – low latency’).  This enables grouping of similar workloads.  Tags can be automatically assigned based on process analysis and system calls.
3.  **Shadow Profile Generator:**  
    *   Input: Workload Tag(s), Historical Utilization Data from Tagged Workloads.
    *   Process:
        *   Selects historical data from workloads sharing the input tag(s).
        *   Normalizes utilization data (e.g., percentage of allocated resources).
        *   Creates a statistical model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) representing the typical utilization patterns of the tagged workloads.  This model is the ‘shadow profile’.
        *   Calculates confidence intervals for predicted utilization based on the statistical model.
    *   Output: Shadow Profile (statistical model, confidence intervals).
4.  **Predictive Scaling Engine:**
    *   Input: Current Workload Utilization Data, Shadow Profile, Confidence Intervals.
    *   Process:
        *   Compares current workload utilization to the shadow profile's predicted utilization (and confidence intervals).
        *   If the current utilization is exceeding the lower bound of the predicted confidence interval, the engine proactively scales resources (e.g., allocates more CPU cores, increases memory allocation).  Scaling decisions consider cost-benefit analysis.
        *   The engine can also anticipate bursts based on historical patterns derived from the shadow profile (e.g., scaling up resources during known peak hours).
    *   Output: Scaling Commands.
5.  **Resource Manager:** Executes scaling commands, allocating/deallocating resources.

**III.  Pseudocode (Predictive Scaling Engine):**

```
FUNCTION PredictiveScale(currentUtilization, shadowProfile, confidenceInterval):
  // currentUtilization:  Array of resource utilization metrics (CPU, Memory, I/O)
  // shadowProfile: Statistical model of historical utilization
  // confidenceInterval:  Range of expected utilization values

  FOR EACH metric IN currentUtilization:
    predictedValue = shadowProfile.predict(metric) // Use shadow profile to predict expected value
    lowerBound = predictedValue - confidenceInterval.lowerMargin
    upperBound = predictedValue + confidenceInterval.upperMargin

    IF metric > upperBound:
      //Initiate scaling up of resources
      scalingFactor = (metric - upperBound) * scalingSensitivity // Scaling sensitivity is a tunable parameter
      requestResourceAllocation(scalingFactor)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  //Anticipate Burst
  IF currentTimestamp MOD burstPredictionInterval == 0:
    predictedBurst = shadowProfile.predictBurst()
    IF predictedBurst > currentResources:
      requestResourceAllocation(predictedBurst - currentResources)
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

  RETURN
END
```

**IV.  Novelty & Differentiation:**

*   **Shadow Workloads:**  Leveraging the collective behavior of similar workloads instead of relying solely on individual workload history provides more accurate prediction, especially for new or infrequently run workloads.
*   **Predictive Bursting:**  Proactively scaling resources *before* a burst occurs, reducing latency and improving performance. This is a shift from reactive scaling.
*   **Confidence Intervals:** Incorporating confidence intervals into scaling decisions provides a more robust and reliable system.
*    **Tunable Sensitivity:**  Adjustable scaling sensitivity allows for fine-grained control over resource allocation.
