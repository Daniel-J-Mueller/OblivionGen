## Personalized Skill Chaining & Anticipatory Execution

**Concept:** Expand the device-specific skill processing to include *chained* skill execution based on learned user behavior and *anticipatory* execution based on probabilistic modeling.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** User input (voice, text, sensor data – location, time of day, activity), skill invocation history, contextual data (device state, connected services).
*   **Modeling:**  Employ a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to model user behavior sequences.  The model learns probabilities of transitioning between skills given the current context and preceding skill invocations.
*   **Output:**  A behavioral profile representing the user’s preferred skill sequences and associated probabilities. Profile is dynamically updated with each interaction.

**2. Skill Graph:**

*   **Structure:**  A directed graph where nodes represent skills (device-specific or general) and edges represent learned transitions between skills (probabilities derived from the Behavioral Profiling Module).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Edge weights (probabilities) are updated in real-time based on user interactions, creating a dynamically adapting skill graph.  Low-confidence transitions are pruned.
*   **Contextual Enrichment:**  Edges can be labeled with contextual information (e.g., "morning routine," "driving mode") that influences transition probabilities.

**3. Anticipatory Execution Engine:**

*   **Prediction:** Given the current context and the user’s behavioral profile, the engine traverses the Skill Graph to predict the most likely next skill to invoke.
*   **Confidence Threshold:**  A configurable confidence threshold determines when to proactively invoke a skill.  Lower thresholds lead to more proactive behavior but potentially higher false positives.
*   **Confirmation Step:** For high-confidence predictions, a non-intrusive confirmation step (e.g., a subtle visual cue) can be presented to the user before executing the skill.  This allows the user to override the prediction if necessary.
*   **Parallel Processing:** The Engine performs parallel NLU processing on both the current input *and* the predicted next skill to assess relevance and context.

**4. Skill Prioritization & Conflict Resolution:**

*   **Scoring System:**  A scoring system combines the likelihood from the primary NLU processing, the prediction confidence from the Anticipatory Execution Engine, and contextual factors (e.g., device state, urgency).
*   **Conflict Resolution Rules:** Predefined rules resolve conflicts between the primary NLU interpretation and the predicted skill execution. These rules may prioritize user intent, device state, or safety considerations.
*   **User Override Mechanism:** A clear and accessible mechanism allows the user to explicitly override the automated skill prioritization and select a different skill.

**Pseudocode (Anticipatory Execution Engine):**

```
function predictNextSkill(context, userProfile, skillGraph) {
  // 1. Get possible next skills from the skill graph based on current context.
  possibleSkills = getNextSkills(skillGraph, context);

  // 2. Score each possible skill based on user profile and graph weights.
  scoredSkills = [];
  for (skill in possibleSkills) {
    score = calculateSkillScore(skill, userProfile, skillGraph);
    scoredSkills.push({skill: skill, score: score});
  }

  // 3. Sort skills by score in descending order.
  sortedSkills = sortSkills(scoredSkills);

  // 4. Return the top-ranked skill if the score exceeds the confidence threshold.
  if (sortedSkills[0].score > confidenceThreshold) {
    return sortedSkills[0].skill;
  } else {
    return null; // No confident prediction.
  }
}

function calculateSkillScore(skill, userProfile, skillGraph) {
  // Combine user profile data (skill usage frequency) with graph edge weight.
  // Also factor in contextual relevance (e.g., time of day, location).
  score = userProfile.skillUsageFrequency[skill] * skillGraph.edgeWeight[skill] * contextualRelevance;
  return score;
}
```

This system allows for a more proactive and personalized user experience by anticipating user needs and executing skills before they are explicitly requested. The dynamic learning and conflict resolution mechanisms ensure that the system adapts to changing user preferences and maintains a high level of accuracy.
