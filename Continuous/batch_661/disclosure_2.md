## Dynamic Histogram Aggregation with Predictive Sub-Bucketing

**Concept:** Extend the multi-level histogram approach by introducing *predictive sub-bucketing*. Instead of static sub-bucket creation based on configuration requests, dynamically create and refine sub-buckets based on real-time data distribution patterns. This addresses potential inefficiencies of pre-defined sub-buckets which may not align with actual metric behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Stream Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw metric data stream (e.g., latency, response time).
*   **Function:** Continuously analyzes incoming data to identify emerging distribution patterns. Utilizes a sliding window to capture recent behavior.
*   **Algorithm:** Employ a change point detection algorithm (e.g., CUSUM, E-Divisive) to identify significant shifts in data distribution. The algorithm determines when a sub-bucket is warranted.
*   **Output:** Trigger signal indicating the need for a new sub-bucket, and recommended value range for that sub-bucket.

**2. Adaptive Sub-Bucket Manager:**

*   **Input:** Trigger signal & recommended range from Data Stream Analysis Module, existing histogram structure (first-level & second-level buckets), memory constraints.
*   **Function:**
    *   Allocates memory for the new sub-bucket.
    *   Splits an existing second-level bucket (or a portion thereof) to create the new sub-bucket. The split point is determined by the recommended range.
    *   Adjusts the value ranges of adjacent buckets to maintain continuity.
    *   Implements a "least recently used" (LRU) eviction policy for sub-buckets. If memory is constrained, LRU sub-buckets are merged back into their parent buckets.
    *   Tracks the "age" of each sub-bucket (time since creation). Sub-buckets that are not actively capturing significant data are candidates for removal.
*   **Output:** Updated histogram structure.

**3. Hierarchical Histogram Representation:**

*   **Data Structure:** A tree-like structure.
    *   Root: First-level buckets (coarse granularity).
    *   Branches: Second-level buckets (medium granularity).
    *   Leaves: Dynamically created sub-buckets (fine granularity).
*   **Access Pattern:**
    *   Data points are first assigned to a first-level bucket.
    *   Within the first-level bucket, the appropriate second-level bucket is identified.
    *   Within the second-level bucket, the appropriate sub-bucket is identified. If no suitable sub-bucket exists, one is created (if memory allows).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Sub-Bucket Manager):**

```
function manageSubBuckets(dataPoint, histogram):
  firstLevelBucket = findFirstLevelBucket(dataPoint, histogram)
  secondLevelBucket = findSecondLevelBucket(dataPoint, firstLevelBucket)

  subBucket = findSubBucket(dataPoint, secondLevelBucket)
  if subBucket is null:
    if memoryAvailable():
      newSubBucket = createSubBucket(dataPoint, secondLevelBucket)
      subBucket = newSubBucket
    else:
      // LRU eviction if no memory available
      evictedSubBucket = findLeastRecentlyUsedSubBucket(secondLevelBucket)
      mergeSubBucket(evictedSubBucket, secondLevelBucket)
      subBucket = findSubBucket(dataPoint, secondLevelBucket) //Try again
      if subBucket is null:
           //Assign to the second level bucket as a fallback.
           updateSecondLevelBucket(dataPoint, secondLevelBucket)
           return

  updateSubBucket(dataPoint, subBucket)
```

**4. Transmission Protocol:**

*   Periodically transmit summary statistics of the histogram (bucket counts, min/max values) to the metric manager.
*   When a new sub-bucket is created or removed, send a delta update to the metric manager indicating the change.

**Innovation:** This approach dynamically adapts to changing data distributions, potentially reducing memory usage compared to static sub-bucketing, and increasing the accuracy of performance analysis. The tiered structure and delta updates minimize transmission overhead.
