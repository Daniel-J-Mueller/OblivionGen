## Predictive Maintenance & Dynamic Setpoint Adjustment via Acoustic Emission

**System Overview:** Integrate acoustic emission (AE) sensors directly into the chiller and evaporative cooler system to monitor component health *and* dynamically adjust the setpoint temperature based on predicted performance degradation.

**Core Innovation:** Current systems react to performance drops. This system *predicts* drops via AE signature analysis, preemptively adjusting the setpoint to maintain optimal efficiency *before* a performance loss is observed.

**Components:**

*   **AE Sensor Array:** Multiple high-frequency AE sensors mounted on critical chiller components (compressor, pump, heat exchangers) *and* the evaporative cooler (fan motor, water distribution system, fill media).
*   **Signal Conditioning & Data Acquisition:** Hardware to amplify, filter, and digitize AE signals.
*   **AI-Powered Feature Extraction & Anomaly Detection:** A neural network trained on baseline AE signatures of healthy components. This network extracts relevant features (energy, amplitude, frequency content) and flags anomalies indicating potential failures or degradation.
*   **Performance Degradation Prediction Module:** Based on anomaly detection, a regression model predicts the *rate* of performance degradation (e.g., reduction in cooling capacity, increase in energy consumption) over a defined time horizon.
*   **Dynamic Setpoint Adjustment Algorithm:**  Algorithm that adjusts the evaporative cooler setpoint based on the predicted performance degradation. The goal is to proactively compensate for the anticipated loss of cooling capacity or efficiency, maintaining a stable chilled water output temperature *and* minimizing energy consumption.
*   **System Integration & Communication:** Interface with the existing chiller control system to receive operating data (load, flow rate, temperatures) and to implement setpoint adjustments.
*   **Cloud Connectivity (Optional):** For data logging, remote monitoring, and model updates.

**Pseudocode (Setpoint Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
// Input Variables:
// predicted_performance_degradation (percentage loss per hour)
// current_chiller_load (percentage)
// current_chilled_water_temperature (degrees Celsius)
// desired_chilled_water_temperature (degrees Celsius)
// current_evaporative_cooler_setpoint (degrees Celsius)
// minimum_evaporative_cooler_setpoint (degrees Celsius)
// maximum_evaporative_cooler_setpoint (degrees Celsius)
// approach_temperature (Evaporative Cooler)

function adjustSetpoint(inputs) {

  // Calculate required cooling capacity adjustment
  requiredAdjustment = predicted_performance_degradation * current_chiller_load;

  //Determine the impact on chilled water temperature
  deltaTemperature = requiredAdjustment * temperatureCoefficient;

  //Calculate new setpoint
  newSetpoint = current_evaporative_cooler_setpoint - deltaTemperature;

  //Constrain setpoint to minimum and maximum limits
  newSetpoint = max(newSetpoint, minimum_evaporative_cooler_setpoint);
  newSetpoint = min(newSetpoint, maximum_evaporative_cooler_setpoint);

  return newSetpoint;
}
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  AE sensors continuously monitor components.
2.  AI analyzes AE signals for anomalies.
3.  Performance degradation is predicted.
4.  Setpoint adjustment algorithm calculates the optimal evaporative cooler setpoint.
5.  Setpoint is adjusted in real-time.
6.  System continuously learns and improves prediction accuracy based on historical data.

**Novelty:**  The combination of real-time acoustic emission analysis for predictive maintenance *and* dynamic setpoint adjustment to proactively compensate for predicted performance loss is a significant advancement over reactive control strategies. This system moves beyond symptom detection to true preventative maintenance, optimizing energy efficiency and extending equipment lifespan.
