## Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment via Simulated Player "Ghosts"

**Concept:** Expand upon the replay and notification system to introduce a dynamic difficulty adjustment feature driven by “ghost” players representing historical gameplay data.

**Specs:**

*   **Ghost Data Capture:** During live gameplay, record comprehensive player action data: movement vectors, aiming data, ability usage, resource consumption, decision points (e.g., path choices, engagement/disengagement). This data is associated with the player’s profile and stored for each game session.
*   **Ghost Creation:**  Generate AI-controlled “ghost” players based on historical data. Each ghost embodies the playstyle of a specific player (or an aggregated average/archetype). Ghost behavior is driven by the captured action data – essentially replaying past decisions in similar game scenarios.  A “weighting” system will prioritize recent data, allowing player adaptation over time.
*   **Scenario Matching:** During a replay or live session, the system analyzes current game state (player positions, enemy types, objectives) to identify analogous scenarios within the historical data.  A similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity of state vectors) determines the best-matching ghosts.
*   **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment:**  The selected ghosts are integrated into the game environment as "opponents" or "cooperative agents". Their behavior affects the difficulty of the session in real time. 
    *   *Opponent Ghosts:*  Opponent ghosts mimic aggressive or skilled play, providing a more challenging experience. They can be scaled based on a difficulty setting or player skill level.
    *   *Cooperative Ghosts:* Cooperative ghosts assist the player, demonstrating optimal strategies or providing tactical support. These can be used for tutorial purposes or to alleviate frustration.
*   **Replay Integration:**  During replay sessions, the system can activate ghost players to simulate a full team or opposing force, recreating the conditions of the original game.
*   **Notification Integration:**  When a replay is initiated, the system notifies players of the option to include “ghosts” of other players in the replay session. Players can customize which ghosts are included and their difficulty level.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Scenario Matching):**

```
function find_matching_ghosts(current_game_state, ghost_data_store, num_ghosts_to_return):
  ghost_similarities = []
  for ghost in ghost_data_store:
    similarity = calculate_similarity(current_game_state, ghost.historical_game_states) // Use cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or similar
    ghost_similarities.append((ghost, similarity))

  ghost_similarities.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True) // Sort by similarity
  selected_ghosts = [ghost for ghost, similarity in ghost_similarities[:num_ghosts_to_return]]

  return selected_ghosts
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `GhostData`: Stores player action data for a game session. Includes timestamps, movement vectors, ability usage, decision points, and player profile information.
*   `GhostProfile`: Stores aggregated data for a player's playstyle. Used to create generalized ghosts.
*   `GameStateVector`: Represents the current state of the game. Includes player positions, enemy types, objectives, and resource levels.
