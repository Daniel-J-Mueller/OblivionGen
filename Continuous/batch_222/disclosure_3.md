## Adaptive Metric Granularity & Predictive Scaling

**System Specification:** A tiered metric collection and analysis system tied to predictive scaling of host resources.

**Core Concept:** The existing system appears focused on *reporting* performance. This builds on that by dynamically adjusting the *granularity* of collected metrics *based on predicted resource needs* and *automatically scaling* host resources preemptively.  It moves from observation to anticipation.

**Components:**

1.  **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Historical metric data (from existing system), system load forecasts (business calendars, event schedules, user projections), real-time system usage.
    *   Algorithm: A hybrid time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).  The model predicts future resource demand (CPU, memory, network I/O) for each host.  Confidence intervals are generated alongside predictions.
    *   Output: Resource demand predictions (per host, per metric) with associated confidence levels.

2.  **Granularity Controller:**
    *   Input: Prediction Engine output, Host resource status.
    *   Logic:
        *   **High Confidence, High Demand:** Collect *detailed* metrics (e.g., per-process CPU usage, memory allocation details, disk I/O per file).  High frequency sampling.
        *   **High Confidence, Low Demand:** Collect *aggregated* metrics (e.g., total CPU usage, total memory usage). Lower frequency sampling.
        *   **Low Confidence, High or Low Demand:** Collect a *moderate* level of detail and increase sampling frequency.
        *   A ‘noise’ factor: Randomly increase detail/frequency briefly to capture unusual spikes.
    *   Output: Configuration settings for the Metric Collection Agent (see below).

3.  **Metric Collection Agent (MCA):**
    *   Runs on each host.
    *   Receives configuration settings from the Granularity Controller.
    *   Collects metrics *according to the received configuration*.
    *   Pre-aggregates/filters data locally before transmission to reduce network load.
    *   Can be extended with custom metric collection modules.

4.  **Resource Scaling Manager:**
    *   Input: Prediction Engine output, Host resource status, scaling policies.
    *   Logic: Based on predictions and confidence levels, proactively scale resources (e.g., add/remove virtual machines, adjust memory allocations) before demand exceeds capacity.  Scaling policies define acceptable performance thresholds and cost constraints.
    *   Output: Scaling commands to the cloud infrastructure.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Controller):**

```
function adjustGranularity(prediction, hostStatus):
  confidence = prediction.confidence
  demand = prediction.demand
  resourceStatus = hostStatus.resourceStatus

  if confidence > 0.8:
    if demand > 0.7:  // 70% of capacity
      granularity = "detailed"
      frequency = "high"
    else:
      granularity = "aggregated"
      frequency = "low"
  else:
    granularity = "moderate"
    frequency = "medium"

  // Introduce noise
  if random() < 0.05:
    if granularity == "aggregated":
      granularity = "moderate"
    frequency = "high"

  return {granularity: granularity, frequency: frequency}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Prediction Engine runs periodically, generating demand predictions.
2.  Granularity Controller receives predictions and adjusts metric collection settings.
3.  MCA on each host receives configuration settings and collects metrics accordingly.
4.  Resource Scaling Manager uses predictions to proactively scale resources.
5.  Collected metrics are used for monitoring, analysis, and future prediction.
