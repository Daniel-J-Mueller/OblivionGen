## Dynamic Test Case Synthesis via Generative Models

**Concept:** Leverage generative AI models to dynamically create test cases tailored to specific code updates *during* deployment pipeline execution, going beyond pre-defined contributed tests. This moves from *detecting* failures to proactively generating scenarios that expose potential issues *before* they manifest.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Code Update Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Diff of code update (compared to previous version).
    *   Processing:
        *   Static analysis to identify modified functions, classes, and modules.
        *   Dependency graph analysis to determine impacted components.
        *   Semantic understanding (using LLMs) to infer *intent* of the code change (e.g., "improves error handling for network timeouts," "adds support for a new data format").
    *   Output: Semantic description of the code update and impacted component list.

*   **Module 2: Test Case Generator:**
    *   Input: Semantic description from Module 1, impacted component list, and a ‘test case template library’.
    *   Processing:
        *   LLM-powered generation of test scenarios based on the semantic description. The LLM utilizes the template library for structuring test cases (e.g., input/output pairs, boundary conditions, error injection).
        *   Generation of synthetic data for test inputs, tailored to the data types and constraints of the impacted components.
        *   Prioritization of generated test cases based on code coverage analysis and potential impact (e.g., changes to critical functionality receive higher priority).
    *   Output: A set of dynamically generated test cases, expressed in a standard test format (e.g., JUnit, pytest).

*   **Module 3: Test Execution & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Input: Dynamically generated test cases, deployed code update.
    *   Processing:
        *   Automated execution of the generated test cases within the deployment pipeline.
        *   Real-time monitoring of test results.
        *   Feedback loop: Test results are used to refine the test case generation process (e.g., adjust generation parameters, add new templates).
        *   Integration with SLA monitoring: If a generated test case fails, the SLA violation process is triggered.
    *   Output: Test results, SLA status, refined test generation parameters.

**Pseudocode (Module 2 - Test Case Generator):**

```python
def generate_test_cases(semantic_description, impacted_components, template_library):
  """
  Generates test cases based on a semantic description of a code update.
  """

  # 1. Generate test scenarios using an LLM
  prompt = f"Generate test scenarios for code update: {semantic_description}.  Focus on testing {impacted_components}."
  scenarios = llm.generate_text(prompt)

  # 2.  Select relevant templates from the template library
  templates = template_library.find_templates(scenarios)

  # 3. Populate templates with data (using synthetic data generation)
  test_cases = []
  for scenario, template in zip(scenarios, templates):
      synthetic_data = generate_synthetic_data(template.input_schema) # using a schema for data types
      test_case = template.populate(synthetic_data)
      test_cases.append(test_case)

  return test_cases
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond pre-defined tests to actively *creating* tests during deployment, responding dynamically to each code update. The LLM-powered generation allows for more creative and comprehensive testing, potentially uncovering edge cases missed by traditional methods. This isn’t merely automating existing tests, but generating *new* tests on the fly.
