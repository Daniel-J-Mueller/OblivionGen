## Adaptive Mesh Beaconing with Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Extend the beaconing system to facilitate a self-organizing, predictive mesh network. Instead of solely focusing on connecting to an *established* network, the system proactively builds a temporary mesh amongst devices *before* a connection to an established network is even attempted. This mesh enables faster discovery, load balancing, and predictive handovers between devices.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Roles:** Devices operate in three modes: Initiator, Relay, and Listener.
*   **Initiator:** Starts the beaconing process at a high rate (similar to the original patent). Collects signal strength & channel quality data from surrounding devices.
*   **Relay:** Receives beacon signals, amplifies/rebroadcasts (with minor modifications to reduce interference – see Interference Mitigation below), and reports signal data back to the Initiator.
*   **Listener:**  Receives beacons, passively reports signal data to the Initiator/Relays.
*   **Beacon Payload Enhancement:**  Beacons include:
    *   Device Role (Initiator, Relay, Listener)
    *   Signal Strength (RSSI) of received beacons
    *   Channel Quality (SNR)
    *   Estimated Device Density (based on beacon reception rate)
    *   Network Access Credential Availability (boolean – indicating if the device has credentials for known networks)
*   **Mesh Formation Algorithm:**
    1.  Initiator starts high-rate beaconing.
    2.  Listeners respond with passive signal reports. Relays actively report.
    3.  Initiator constructs a localized network graph based on received signals. Nodes represent devices, edges represent signal strength/quality.
    4.  Algorithm identifies optimal relay paths to maximize coverage and minimize latency.
    5.  Devices dynamically adjust their roles (e.g., a Listener becoming a Relay) based on network conditions.
*   **Predictive Handover:**
    1.  As a device moves, signal strength to current Relay/Initiator decreases.
    2.  Mesh network data predicts the next best Relay/Initiator based on real-time signal data.
    3.  Seamless handover occurs *before* signal loss, minimizing disruption.
*   **Interference Mitigation:**
    *   **Channel Hopping:** Relays dynamically adjust their transmission channel based on interference detected from other nearby wireless networks or other mesh networks.
    *   **Power Control:** Relays adjust their transmission power to minimize interference with neighboring devices.
    *   **Beamforming (Optional):**  More advanced devices could utilize beamforming to focus signal strength towards the intended recipient.
*   **Established Network Integration:**
    1.  Once a device has network access credentials, it broadcasts this information through the mesh.
    2.  Other devices can then leverage this connection (acting as a proxy).
    3.  Mesh gradually dissolves as more devices connect to the established network.
*   **Pseudocode (Initiator):**

```
initializeNetworkGraph()
startHighRateBeaconing()

while (networkNotEstablished) {
  receiveBeaconResponses()
  updateNetworkGraph(beaconResponses)
  identifyOptimalRelayPaths()
  adjustRelayRoles()

  if (deviceHasNetworkCredentials) {
    broadcastNetworkCredentials()
    // Start transitioning devices to established network
  }
}

dissolveMeshNetwork()
```

**Hardware Considerations:**  Requires devices with multiple antennas and sufficient processing power to run the mesh network algorithms.  Software Defined Radio (SDR) capability would be beneficial for dynamic channel selection.
