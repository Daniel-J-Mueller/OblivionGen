**Microfluidic Lens Array with Dynamic Focal Control**

**Concept:** Leverage electrowetting principles to create a microfluidic lens array where each lens's focal length is individually controllable via applied voltage. This allows for real-time optical zoom, aberration correction, and complex image manipulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** Hexagonal close-packed arrangement of micro-lenses. Each lens approximately 200µm diameter, with 50µm spacing. Array size scalable (e.g., 10x10, 50x50).
*   **Micro-Lens Structure:** Each micro-lens comprised of two parallel glass plates.  The space between the plates filled with a clear, electrically conductive fluid (e.g., ionic liquid).
*   **Electrowetting Control:** Each lens incorporates a micro-electrode array on the underside of the top plate, directly facing the conductive fluid. The electrode array divides each lens into multiple, individually addressable segments (e.g., 4 segments per lens).
*   **Fluid Properties:**  Conductive fluid chosen for high dielectric constant, low viscosity, and compatibility with glass surfaces. Surface tension controllable via applied voltage.
*   **Addressing Scheme:**  Each electrode segment driven by a dedicated driver circuit (TFT backplane).  Individual segment voltages adjusted to control the local curvature of the fluid interface, thus altering the lens's focal length.
*   **Optical Considerations:** Anti-reflective coating applied to both glass plates. Fluid selected for minimal light scattering and absorption.
*   **Housing/Mounting:**  Array embedded in a transparent polymer housing. Mounting points for integration into optical systems.
*   **Control Interface:** Serial communication interface (SPI/I2C) for programming lens array parameters. Software library for controlling array.

**Pseudocode (Focal Length Adjustment):**

```
// Define constants
const int NUM_SEGMENTS = 4; // Number of segments per lens
const float MAX_VOLTAGE = 5.0; // Maximum applied voltage
const float FOCAL_LENGTH_SCALE = 0.1; // Scale factor for focal length adjustment

// Function to set voltage for a single segment
void setSegmentVoltage(int segmentID, float voltage) {
    // Ensure voltage is within valid range
    voltage = constrain(voltage, 0.0, MAX_VOLTAGE);

    // Send voltage control signal to segment driver
    sendControlSignal(segmentID, voltage);
}

// Function to adjust focal length of a lens
void adjustFocalLength(int lensID, float focalLengthOffset) {
    // Calculate voltage adjustment per segment
    float voltageDelta = focalLengthOffset * FOCAL_LENGTH_SCALE;

    // Calculate voltage for each segment
    float segmentVoltages[NUM_SEGMENTS];
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SEGMENTS; i++) {
        segmentVoltages[i] = voltageDelta * (float)(i + 1);
    }

    // Set voltage for each segment
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_SEGMENTS; i++) {
        setSegmentVoltage(lensID * NUM_SEGMENTS + i, segmentVoltages[i]);
    }
}
```
