## Adaptive Credential 'Lifeline' with Behavioral Biometrics

**System Overview:**

A dynamic credential management system that extends the core concept of short-lived credentials by integrating continuous behavioral biometric authentication. Instead of fixed expiration times, credential validity is tied to ongoing user behavior matching a learned profile. If behavioral drift is detected, credentials are revoked *before* their scheduled expiration, triggering a re-authentication process.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Behavioral Biometric Engine (BBE):**
    *   Captures user interaction data: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scroll patterns, touch gestures (if applicable), application usage patterns, time-of-day access frequency.
    *   Employs machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, LSTM networks) to create a baseline behavioral profile for each user/agent.
    *   Calculates a ‘Behavioral Drift Score’ (BDS) – a real-time metric indicating the deviation of current behavior from the established baseline.
    *   Configurable sensitivity threshold for the BDS – determines the level of deviation required to trigger a credential review.

*   **Component 2: Credential Lifecycle Manager (CLM):**
    *   Receives BDS data from the BBE.
    *   Monitors the BDS against the configured threshold.
    *   If the BDS exceeds the threshold:
        *   Immediately revokes the current set of credentials.
        *   Initiates a re-authentication process, potentially involving multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Generates a new set of credentials.
    *   If the BDS remains within acceptable limits, extends the validity of the current credentials – potentially up to a maximum lifespan.

*   **Component 3: Agent Integration Module (AIM):**
    *   Integrates with existing application servers and agents (as described in the provided patent).
    *   Receives credentials from the CLM.
    *   Transmits behavioral data to the BBE.
    *   Receives revocation signals from the CLM.

**Pseudocode (CLM):**

```
function process_behavioral_data(user_id, behavioral_data):
  bds = BehavioralBiometricEngine.calculate_drift_score(behavioral_data)
  threshold = Configuration.get_bds_threshold(user_id)

  if bds > threshold:
    revoke_credentials(user_id)
    new_credentials = generate_new_credentials(user_id)
    provide_credentials_to_agent(user_id, new_credentials)
  else:
    extend_credential_lifetime(user_id)
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User interacts with an application.
2.  Agent captures interaction data and sends it to the BBE.
3.  BBE calculates the BDS and sends it to the CLM.
4.  CLM monitors the BDS against the threshold.
5.  If the BDS exceeds the threshold, the CLM revokes the credentials, generates new credentials, and provides them to the agent.
6.  If the BDS remains within acceptable limits, the CLM extends the credential lifetime.

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond fixed-time credential expiration by introducing *continuous* authentication. It adapts to user behavior, providing increased security against compromised credentials without disrupting legitimate user access. It's a dynamic system which adapts, rather than simply expiring, and therefore is more robust.
