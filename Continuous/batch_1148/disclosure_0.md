## Dynamic Patch Decomposition with Learned Attention Masks

**Specification:** A system for adaptive image partitioning leveraging attention mechanisms to dynamically determine optimal cell boundaries *within* a patch, moving beyond fixed row/column targeting. This system prioritizes feature retention rather than strict grid alignment.

**Core Concept:** Instead of predefining the number of columns and rows, the system *learns* optimal decomposition boundaries based on feature importance within the input patch.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   GPU with CUDA/TensorFlow/PyTorch support
*   Image sensor (optional, for real-time application)
*   Sufficient RAM for model and image processing.

**Software Components:**

*   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – Specifically, a U-Net architecture modified to output attention masks.
*   Attention Mechanism – Scaled Dot-Product Attention
*   Image Processing Library (OpenCV, PIL)

**System Operation:**

1.  **Input Patch:** Receive an image patch (e.g., 64x64 pixels).
2.  **Feature Extraction:** Pass the patch through a series of convolutional layers to extract a feature map.
3.  **Attention Mask Generation:** The feature map is fed into the U-Net. The U-Net's output is a set of attention masks—one for each potential cell boundary (both horizontal and vertical).  Each mask represents the "importance" of a specific pixel in determining a boundary.  Values closer to 1 indicate a strong boundary suggestion, while values near 0 suggest a weak boundary.
4.  **Dynamic Boundary Determination:**  A thresholding operation is applied to the attention masks. Pixels with attention values exceeding the threshold are identified as boundary points.
5.  **Cell Segmentation:** Using the identified boundary points, the patch is segmented into a variable number of cells. Cells are not constrained to be rectangular; they can be irregular polygons defined by the boundary points.
6.  **Feature Aggregation:** Features within each cell are aggregated (e.g., mean, max, or a learned pooling operation).
7.  **Descriptor Generation:** A descriptor is generated from the aggregated cell features. This descriptor can be used for object recognition, image classification, or other computer vision tasks.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Input: image_patch (e.g., 64x64 image)

# Feature Extraction:
feature_map = CNN(image_patch)

# Attention Mask Generation:
horizontal_masks, vertical_masks = U_Net(feature_map)

# Thresholding (dynamic, based on mask distribution):
horizontal_threshold = calculate_threshold(horizontal_masks) #Statistical measure, e.g. percentile
vertical_threshold = calculate_threshold(vertical_masks)

horizontal_boundaries = threshold(horizontal_masks, horizontal_threshold)
vertical_boundaries = threshold(vertical_masks, vertical_threshold)

# Cell Segmentation:
cells = segment_image(image_patch, horizontal_boundaries, vertical_boundaries)

# Feature Aggregation:
cell_features = []
for cell in cells:
    aggregated_feature = aggregate_features(cell)
    cell_features.append(aggregated_feature)

# Descriptor Generation:
descriptor = generate_descriptor(cell_features)

# Output: descriptor
```

**Innovation:**

This approach moves beyond a predetermined grid structure, enabling the system to adapt to the underlying image content. The learned attention masks allow for flexible decomposition, potentially capturing more meaningful features and improving recognition accuracy. The dynamic nature of the boundaries reduces information loss that might occur with rigid grid alignment. This is unlike the original patent which seems to enforce fixed column and row counts. The resulting cells aren't necessarily rectangular.
