## Dynamic Operation Profiling for Tiered Billing

**Specification:** A system to dynamically profile software operations *during* runtime, creating granular billing ‘atoms’ beyond pre-defined units, and allowing for tiered pricing based on operational complexity.

**Core Concept:**  The existing patent focuses on billing based on *occurrences* of billable units. This expands on that by profiling *what* those units *are* in terms of computational cost, memory usage, and external service calls *while* the software is running.  It then aggregates these profiles into atomic billing units, allowing the service provider to offer extremely nuanced and potentially tiered pricing.

**Components:**

1.  **Runtime Profiler:** Embedded within the software product.  Monitors execution, capturing:
    *   CPU cycles per operation
    *   Memory allocation/deallocation per operation
    *   Network I/O per operation (bytes sent/received, latency)
    *   Disk I/O per operation
    *   External API calls (number, latency, data size)
2.  **Operation Categorizer:**  Analyzes profiled data and categorizes operations based on their resource consumption. Uses a dynamic, machine learning-based categorization engine.  Categories might include: "Simple Data Retrieval," "Complex Calculation," "High-Bandwidth Transfer," "External Service Integration."
3.  **Billing Atom Generator:**  Combines categorized operations into ‘billing atoms’.  A billing atom represents a discrete unit of work, with an associated resource cost.  Algorithms dynamically adjust the size of atoms based on usage patterns and system load.
4.  **Tiered Pricing Engine:** Assigns different prices to different billing atom categories.  Higher complexity categories (e.g., "Complex Calculation") have higher prices. Prices are also dynamic, potentially adjusted based on time of day, system load, or customer subscription level.
5.  **Real-Time Billing Data Stream:** Transmits billing atom data to the billing service in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Profiler - simplified):**

```
function executeOperation(operationName, parameters):
  startTime = getCurrentTime()
  cpuUsage = measureCPUUsage()
  memoryUsage = measureMemoryUsage()
  networkIO = measureNetworkIO()

  result = performOperation(operationName, parameters)

  endTime = getCurrentTime()
  duration = endTime - startTime

  operationProfile = {
    name: operationName,
    cpuCycles: cpuUsage,
    memoryBytes: memoryUsage,
    networkBytes: networkIO,
    duration: duration
  }

  sendOperationProfileToCategorizer(operationProfile)

  return result
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **OperationProfile:**  { name: string, cpuCycles: int, memoryBytes: int, networkBytes: int, duration: float }
*   **BillingAtom:** { category: string, cost: float, count: int }

**Implementation Details:**

*   The Runtime Profiler should be designed to minimize overhead.  Sampling techniques can be used to reduce the amount of data collected.
*   The Operation Categorizer should be trained on a representative dataset of software operations.  Reinforcement learning could be used to optimize the categorization algorithm.
*   The Tiered Pricing Engine should be configurable to allow the service provider to adjust prices based on market conditions.



This system shifts billing from simply counting *instances* of operations to valuing the *cost* of those operations. This enables a far more accurate and potentially lucrative billing model.
