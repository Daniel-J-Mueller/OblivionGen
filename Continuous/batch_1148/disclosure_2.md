## Dynamic Content Segmentation & Predictive Pre-Rendering

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply tracking usage of *portions* of content to *dynamically* segment content based on observed user interaction *during* a session, and then *predictively* pre-render segments likely to be viewed next. This moves from passive tracking to active optimization of the user experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Real-time Interaction Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Continuous stream of user interaction data (mouse movements, scrolling speed, gaze tracking, clicks, key presses).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Heatmap Generation:** Create a dynamic heatmap of user attention within the content, updated in real-time.  Not just click-based, but incorporates dwell time, scrolling velocity, and even subtle cues like hesitation or re-reading.
    *   **Segmentation Algorithm:** Employ a clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, k-means) to identify areas of high user engagement *as they happen*.  The algorithm needs to be adaptable – segment sizes should vary based on content density and user behavior. Thresholds for segment creation are adjustable (dwell time, area size, etc.).
    *   **Segment ID Assignment:** Assign a unique ID to each dynamically created segment. This is crucial for tracking and predictive rendering.

**2. Predictive Rendering Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Segment ID stream from the Real-time Interaction Analysis Module, historical usage data (as in the original patent), and current session data.
*   **Prediction Model:**  Employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically an LSTM or GRU – trained on historical and current session data to predict the *next* segment(s) the user is likely to view.
    *   **Feature Vector:** The RNN's input feature vector should include:
        *   Sequence of recently viewed segment IDs
        *   Dwell time on each segment
        *   Scrolling direction and speed
        *   User profile data (if available)
        *   Content type and metadata
    *   **Probability Threshold:**  A configurable probability threshold determines when a segment is pre-rendered. Higher threshold = fewer pre-renders, but potentially more delays.
*   **Pre-Rendering Queue:** A queue manages pre-rendering requests.  Prioritization can be based on probability score, segment size (smaller segments render faster), and available system resources.
*   **Content Caching:** Pre-rendered segments are cached locally.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side Component:** A lightweight JavaScript library embedded in the web page collects interaction data and communicates with the server.
*   **Server-Side Component:**
    *   **Interaction Data Receiver:** Handles incoming interaction data from clients.
    *   **Segmentation & Prediction Service:** Runs the segmentation algorithm and RNN prediction model.
    *   **Content Delivery Service:** Provides pre-rendered segments to the client.
    *   **Database:** Stores historical usage data, segment metadata, and prediction model parameters.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predictNextSegment(sessionData, historicalData):
  # sessionData = [segmentID_1, segmentID_2, ..., segmentID_n]
  # historicalData = large dataset of user interactions
  
  # Prepare input feature vector
  featureVector = createFeatureVector(sessionData, historicalData)
  
  # Run RNN prediction model
  predictedSegmentProbabilities = rnnModel.predict(featureVector)
  
  # Sort probabilities in descending order
  sortedProbabilities = sort(predictedSegmentProbabilities, descending=True)
  
  # Select the top N segments (configurable)
  topNSegments = sortedProbabilities[:N]
  
  return topNSegments
```

**Innovation:** This goes beyond simply tracking what *was* viewed to *anticipating* what will be viewed next.  The dynamic segmentation allows for finer-grained analysis and more accurate predictions, leading to a smoother, more responsive user experience. This is akin to a 'smart scroll' that proactively prepares content for the user.
