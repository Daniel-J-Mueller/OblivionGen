## Adaptive Data Tiering with Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** Implement a multi-tiered storage system for time-series data that dynamically adjusts data placement based on access patterns *and* predicted future access. This extends beyond simply hot/cold separation.

**Components:**

*   **Data Tier Hierarchy:**
    *   **Tier 0: RAM Cache:**  Fastest access, limited capacity. Holds most recently accessed data points.
    *   **Tier 1: NVMe SSD:** High-performance, moderate capacity. Stores frequently accessed data, and pre-fetched data.
    *   **Tier 2: QLC SSD:**  Lower cost, higher capacity. Stores less frequently accessed data, serves as a buffer before archival.
    *   **Tier 3: Object Storage (Cloud/On-Prem):**  Lowest cost, highest capacity.  Long-term archival.

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** Monitors data access patterns *at the series level* (not just partition level). Tracks frequency, recency, seasonality, and trends.  Uses time-series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future access.

*   **Prefetching Engine (PFE):**  Based on APA predictions, proactively fetches data from lower tiers to higher tiers *before* it's requested. The PFE considers prediction confidence and available capacity.  It employs a weighted scoring system:
    *   `Score = (PredictionConfidence * AccessFrequency) / (DataSize * TierLatency)`

*   **Dynamic Tiering Manager (DTM):**  Controls data movement between tiers.  It uses the following criteria:
    *   **Recency:** How recently was the data accessed?
    *   **Frequency:** How often is the data accessed?
    *   **Prediction Score:** The score generated by the PFE.
    *   **Tier Capacity:** Available space in each tier.

**Pseudocode (DTM Logic):**

```
function tier_data(series_data, series_metadata):
    recency = calculate_recency(series_metadata.last_access_time)
    frequency = calculate_frequency(series_metadata.access_count)
    prediction_score = get_prediction_score(series_data)

    combined_score = (recency * 0.3) + (frequency * 0.4) + (prediction_score * 0.3)

    if combined_score > 0.8:
        target_tier = Tier.Tier0  // RAM Cache
    elif combined_score > 0.5:
        target_tier = Tier.Tier1  // NVMe SSD
    elif combined_score > 0.2:
        target_tier = Tier.Tier2  // QLC SSD
    else:
        target_tier = Tier.Tier3  // Object Storage

    current_tier = get_current_tier(series_data)

    if current_tier != target_tier:
        move_data(series_data, current_tier, target_tier)
        update_series_metadata(series_data, target_tier)
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Compression:** Utilize different compression algorithms for each tier based on performance and storage constraints.
*   **Data Locality:**  Prioritize keeping related time-series data (e.g., from the same sensor) on the same tier to minimize latency.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Integrate anomaly detection algorithms to identify unexpected access patterns, potentially indicating security breaches or system errors.
*   **Metadata Management:** Maintain rich metadata about each time-series data segment, including access history, prediction scores, and tier location.
*   **Cold Data Compaction:** Periodically compact cold data in Tier 3 to reduce storage costs and improve query performance.
