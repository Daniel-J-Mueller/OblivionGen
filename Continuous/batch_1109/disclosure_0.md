## Dynamic Delivery Workflow Stitching – Predictive Node Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond pre-defined delivery workflows. Implement a system that *predictively* generates delivery nodes *during* a delivery based on real-time conditions and operator feedback, then seamlessly stitches these into the existing or dynamically created workflow.

**Specs:**

*   **Real-time Data Inputs:**
    *   Vehicle Telemetry: Speed, acceleration, braking, turn signals, GPS location.
    *   Environmental Data: Weather (rain, snow, fog), traffic density (API integration), road closures (API integration).
    *   Operator Feedback: Voice commands ("Obstruction ahead," "Best parking spot is further down"), AR annotations (highlighting hazards, preferred routes).
    *   Sensor Data: LiDAR/Radar data from delivery vehicle for obstacle detection and precise location relative to surroundings.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:**
    *   Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network trained on historical delivery data, environmental data, and operator feedback.
    *   Model predicts potential delivery nodes (parking locations, temporary drop-off zones, detour points) based on current conditions.
    *   Confidence score assigned to each predicted node based on the algorithm’s certainty.
*   **Dynamic Workflow Stitching Module:**
    *   Evaluates predicted nodes against delivery constraints (vehicle type, time windows, delivery type).
    *   If a predicted node meets criteria and confidence score is above a threshold, it's dynamically inserted into the delivery workflow.
    *   Automatically recalculates the optimal route based on the new node and delivery schedule.
*   **Augmented Reality Interface Updates:**
    *   Seamlessly updates the AR display with the new delivery node, including 3D visualization of the location, turn-by-turn directions, and relevant information.
    *   Provides the operator with a visual preview of the updated route and any changes to the delivery schedule.
    *   The system highlights the proposed new node and allows the operator to accept or reject the modification via voice command or AR gesture.
*   **Node Types:**
    *   **Contingency Node:** Created in response to unexpected obstacles (road closures, traffic jams). The system suggests alternative routes or temporary drop-off locations.
    *   **Optimization Node:** Created to optimize the delivery route based on real-time traffic conditions or changes to the delivery schedule.
    *   **Customer Request Node:** Created in response to a customer request for a specific delivery location or time.
*   **Data Logging & Learning:**
    *   All data related to dynamically generated nodes (sensor data, operator feedback, environmental data) is logged.
    *   The system uses this data to refine the predictive algorithm and improve the accuracy of dynamically generated nodes.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Stitching):**
