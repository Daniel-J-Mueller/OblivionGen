## Predictive Device State Management

**System Overview:**

The core concept is to move beyond *reacting* to search queries with device actions, to *proactively* anticipating device states based on user search behavior and external data. Instead of waiting for a query like "turn on wifi," the system predicts the *need* for wifi based on search patterns and contextual awareness.

**Components:**

1.  **Contextual Data Ingestion:** Gather data from multiple sources:
    *   Search Queries (from multiple engines – Google, DuckDuckGo, etc.)
    *   Device Sensor Data (location, motion, ambient light, Bluetooth proximity)
    *   Calendar Information (meetings, travel)
    *   External APIs (weather, traffic)
    *   App Usage Patterns

2.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:** A multi-layered model built upon a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
    *   **Layer 1: Query Embedding:** Convert search queries into vector representations.
    *   **Layer 2: Contextual Feature Fusion:** Combine query embeddings with contextual data (sensor data, calendar, external APIs) into a unified feature vector.
    *   **Layer 3: State Prediction:**  LSTM network predicts the *probability* of various device states (e.g., Wi-Fi on/off, Bluetooth connected/disconnected, Do Not Disturb mode, screen brightness level, volume level, charging state).  The output layer uses a sigmoid function for each predicted state to produce a probability score between 0 and 1.

3.  **Action Trigger & Confidence Threshold:**
    *   Define a confidence threshold (e.g., 0.8).  If the predicted probability of a device state exceeds the threshold, an action is triggered.
    *   Implement a “grace period” or delay before triggering an action. This prevents overly aggressive or disruptive behavior.

4.  **User Feedback & Reinforcement Learning:**
    *   Track user overrides of predicted actions.  If a user manually changes a device state shortly after a predicted action, it's considered a negative feedback signal.
    *   Use reinforcement learning (e.g., Q-learning) to adjust the model’s parameters based on user feedback, continuously improving prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Data Ingestion
query = get_search_query()
sensor_data = get_sensor_data()
calendar_data = get_calendar_data()

// Feature Engineering
features = combine(query, sensor_data, calendar_data)

// Prediction
probabilities = predict_device_states(features) // Output: {wifi: 0.9, bluetooth: 0.2, dnd: 0.1}

// Action Trigger
for state, probability in probabilities:
  if probability > confidence_threshold:
    trigger_device_action(state)

// User Feedback Loop
if user_overrides_action():
  adjust_model_parameters(negative_feedback)
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user searches for "directions to airport" while at home. The system detects the query, combined with location data, calendar information (showing a flight scheduled for later), and potentially traffic data. The predictive model predicts a high probability that the user will need navigation and Bluetooth connectivity (for car audio). The system *proactively* enables Bluetooth and starts the navigation app *before* the user explicitly requests it.

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simple query-action mapping to a probabilistic, predictive system that anticipates user needs.  The incorporation of multiple contextual data sources and reinforcement learning creates a dynamically adapting, intelligent system. The focus is on *preventing* the user from having to manually adjust device settings, rather than simply responding to requests.
