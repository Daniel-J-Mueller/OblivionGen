**Stereo Inertial Measurement Unit (SIMU) for Dynamic Calibration & Predictive Alignment**

**Concept:** Expand beyond purely optical alignment to integrate inertial measurement for *predictive* alignment and dynamic calibration of the stereo camera array, especially during UAV maneuvers.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** High-precision, miniature IMU (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) rigidly mounted to the frame *between* the stereo cameras, as close to the optical center as possible.  Specifications:  Accelerometer range ±50g, resolution 100 μg; Gyroscope range ±2000 dps, resolution 1 μrad/s.
    *   **Microcontroller:** Dedicated microcontroller (STM32H7 series or equivalent) for IMU data acquisition, filtering (Kalman filter implementation), and communication with the main management device.
    *   **Actuator Interface:**  Dedicated PWM/SPI interface to control the existing actuator(s) responsible for camera positioning, allowing for fine-grained adjustments.
    *   **Optical Communication Enhancement:**  Reflecting devices will utilize retroreflective materials for increased signal strength and reduced noise.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Sensor Fusion:** Implement a Kalman filter to fuse IMU data (angular rates, accelerations) with optical sensor data (reflections from the existing system). This creates a highly accurate estimate of the relative pose (position & orientation) of the cameras *in real-time*.
    *   **Predictive Alignment:** Utilize the fused IMU/optical data to *predict* camera misalignment due to UAV motion. Based on this prediction, proactively command the actuator to *pre-correct* the camera position *before* significant misalignment occurs.
    *   **Dynamic Calibration:**  Continuously refine the calibration parameters (intrinsic and extrinsic) of the stereo camera array *during flight* using the fused sensor data.  This compensates for thermal drift, vibration, and other environmental factors.
    *   **Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
initial_calibration = perform_initial_calibration();
imu_data_filter = initialize_kalman_filter();

//Main Loop
while(UAV_is_active()){
    //Read sensor data
    imu_data = read_imu();
    optical_data = read_optical_sensors();

    //Filter IMU data
    filtered_imu_data = kalman_filter(imu_data, optical_data);

    //Predict camera misalignment
    predicted_misalignment = predict_misalignment(filtered_imu_data);

    //Calculate actuator commands
    actuator_commands = calculate_actuator_commands(predicted_misalignment);

    //Send commands to actuator
    send_actuator_commands(actuator_commands);

    //Dynamic Calibration
    refined_calibration = perform_dynamic_calibration(filtered_imu_data);
}
```

*   **Communication:**
    *   High-speed SPI/UART interface between the microcontroller and the main management device for transmitting fused sensor data and receiving actuator commands.

*   **Power:**
    *   Dedicated power supply for the SIMU, isolated from the main UAV power system to minimize noise.

**Rationale:**  Current systems react to misalignment.  Adding an IMU allows the system to *anticipate* misalignment, providing a smoother, more accurate stereo vision experience, especially during aggressive maneuvers.  Dynamic calibration ensures long-term accuracy in varying environmental conditions.
