## Adaptive Key Zones & Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Expand upon the key zone concept by making zones *fluid* and dynamically adjusting trust based on real-time behavioral analysis of accessing entities. Instead of static key zones, define zones that shift based on access patterns and perceived risk.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Profiling Module:**

   *   **Input:** Access requests (message, signature, parameters), entity identifiers (user, device, application), historical access data.
   *   **Process:**  
        *   Employ machine learning algorithms (anomaly detection, clustering) to establish baseline behavioral profiles for each entity. Profiles capture access frequency, resource types accessed, time of day, location (if available), and patterns in the use of key restrictions.
        *   Calculate a “Trust Score” for each entity based on deviations from its baseline profile. High deviation = lower score.  Introduce weighted factors for different deviation types (e.g., accessing unusual resources carries higher weight).
   *   **Output:** Real-time Trust Score for each accessing entity.

**2. Dynamic Key Zone Adjustment:**

   *   **Input:** Trust Scores, existing key zone definitions, resource metadata (sensitivity level, criticality).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Define thresholds for Trust Scores. Entities falling below a threshold are automatically moved to a more restricted “shadow zone” – a temporary key zone with stricter access controls.
        *   Adjust key derivation parameters *on the fly* based on the current key zone and Trust Score.  This could involve:
            *   Increasing the entropy of the derived key.
            *   Adding extra restriction parameters (e.g., requiring multi-factor authentication).
            *   Reducing the validity period of the key.
        *   The system will monitor the entity's behavior within the shadow zone. Positive behavior (returning to normal access patterns) will gradually increase the Trust Score and eventually move the entity back to its original zone.
   *   **Output:** Adjusted key derivation parameters and dynamic key zone assignment.

**3. Key Derivation Enhancement:**

   *   **Algorithm:**  Modify the key derivation process to incorporate the Trust Score as a crucial input.
        ```pseudocode
        function deriveKey(secretCredential, parameters, trustScore):
            combinedInput = concatenate(secretCredential, parameters, trustScore)
            hashValue = SHA256(combinedInput)  // Or another suitable hash function
            key = deriveKeyFromHash(hashValue)
            return key
        ```
   *   The `deriveKeyFromHash` function can be customized to apply additional transformations or restrictions based on the key zone and Trust Score.  

**4.  Distributed Trust Validation:**

   *   Implement a distributed ledger or blockchain-based system for sharing Trust Scores across different key zones or organizations.
   *   This allows for a more holistic view of an entity's reputation and facilitates cross-domain trust validation.
   *   The distributed ledger can also store historical Trust Score data for auditing and analysis.



**Integration with Existing System:** This system will need to monitor signature validity and access control. Trust score should be a pre-check. The signature check can be gated, so if the trust score is below a certain threshold, the signature is invalid.
