## Adaptive Predictive Command Mapping for Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the existing command map system to not only *control* media devices, but to *predict* user intent based on device state and generate haptic feedback on the controlling device. This anticipates user actions, enhancing the user experience and reducing cognitive load.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Profile Database:** A database storing haptic feedback profiles associated with specific media device actions. These profiles define vibration patterns, intensity, and duration.  Profiles are categorized by media type (audio, video, gaming, etc.).
*   **State Vector Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of the media device’s state – volume level, playback position, current song/video, active game scene, etc. This data forms a ‘state vector’.
*   **Intent Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network or Long Short-Term Memory network preferred) trained on user interaction data. The model inputs the state vector and predicts the *next* likely user action (e.g., increasing volume, pausing playback, fast-forwarding, selecting a menu option).
*   **Haptic Feedback Trigger:** Upon prediction of an action *before* the user physically performs it, the system triggers a corresponding haptic feedback pattern on the controlling device (e.g., a subtle vibration when the system predicts the user will increase the volume).
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The system continuously learns from user behavior. If the user *doesn't* perform the predicted action, the prediction confidence is lowered, and the system adjusts its model accordingly. Conversely, correct predictions reinforce the model.
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to customize the intensity, type, and even disable haptic feedback entirely. Profiles could also be created, shared, or downloaded.
*   **Command Map Integration:** The existing command map is extended to include entries for haptic feedback triggers.  Each command map entry now includes data on *when* to activate haptic feedback, not just what action to perform.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction Engine):**

```
function predictNextAction(stateVector, userHistory):
    // Input: Current device state (stateVector), User interaction history (userHistory)
    // Output: Predicted next action (string)

    // 1. Feature Extraction: Process stateVector & userHistory to extract relevant features
    features = extractFeatures(stateVector, userHistory)

    // 2. Model Prediction: Use trained ML model to predict the next action based on features
    prediction = model.predict(features)

    // 3. Confidence Scoring: Calculate confidence level of the prediction
    confidence = calculateConfidence(prediction)

    // 4. Filtering/Thresholding: If confidence is below a threshold, return "no prediction"
    if confidence < CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
        return "no prediction"

    return prediction
```

**Example Scenario:**

User is listening to music at a moderate volume. The system predicts the user is likely to increase the volume based on the song's energy level and past user behavior.  A subtle vibration is sent to the controlling device *before* the user touches the volume control, providing a proactive cue and potentially reducing the need to visually confirm the volume level.  If the user doesn't increase the volume, the system adjusts its prediction model.
