## Adaptive Cache Partitioning via Error-Correlation Mapping

**Concept:** Dynamically partition the cache based on detected error correlations between cache lines, not just individual line error rates. This moves beyond simply invalidating/deactivating problematic lines and aims to isolate error *sources* by grouping potentially correlated lines into dedicated cache partitions with independent error handling.

**Specs:**

*   **Error Correlation Matrix (ECM):** A dedicated hardware module maintaining a matrix representing the correlation between all cache lines. Correlation is determined by co-occurrence of errors within a sliding time window.  Higher frequency of simultaneous/near-simultaneous errors increases correlation score. The ECM is updated continuously.
*   **Partitioning Algorithm:** A clustering algorithm (e.g., hierarchical clustering, k-means) operates on the ECM to identify groups of highly correlated cache lines.  This algorithm runs periodically (configurable frequency).  Parameters:  Minimum cluster size, correlation threshold for inclusion in a cluster.
*   **Dynamic Partition Manager (DPM):** A hardware module responsible for reconfiguring the cache based on the output of the Partitioning Algorithm. The DPM can remap cache lines to different physical partitions.
*   **Partition Isolation Levels:** Each partition has configurable error handling levels:
    *   **Normal:** Standard error detection and correction.
    *   **Aggressive:** Increased error checking frequency, potentially at the cost of performance.
    *   **Quarantine:**  Dedicated error handling, logging, and potential memory scrubbing.  Lines in this partition are prioritized for refresh cycles.
*   **Cache Architecture Modification:**  The cache is logically partitioned.  The DPM maintains a mapping table that translates logical cache line addresses to physical cache line addresses within the partitions. The mapping table is updated dynamically.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Track access patterns within each partition to identify performance bottlenecks resulting from the partitioning. This data feeds back into the Partitioning Algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Partitioning Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION partitionCache(ECM, minClusterSize, correlationThreshold):
    clusters = []
    unassignedLines = all cache lines

    WHILE unassignedLines is not empty:
        seedLine = select a line from unassignedLines
        newCluster = [seedLine]
        unassignedLines.remove(seedLine)

        FOR each line in unassignedLines:
            IF correlation(seedLine, line) > correlationThreshold:
                newCluster.append(line)
                unassignedLines.remove(line)

        IF size(newCluster) >= minClusterSize:
            clusters.append(newCluster)

    RETURN clusters
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   Dedicated hardware for ECM maintenance and clustering algorithm execution.
*   Additional multiplexing logic within the cache controller to manage partition mapping.
*   Increased memory bandwidth requirements for partition scrubbing and error logging.
