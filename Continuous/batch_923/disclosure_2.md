**Dynamic Emotional Palette Generation & Affective Image Retrieval**

**Core Concept:** Expand the color palette generation beyond static image analysis and user-defined criteria to incorporate real-time emotional data derived from biometric sensors (heart rate, skin conductance, facial expression analysis) to create palettes reflecting the user's *current* emotional state.  Then, retrieve images not just based on color matching, but on an assessment of emotional resonance between the image's dominant colors and the user’s emotional palette.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Biometric Data Input Module:**
    *   Interfaces with wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers, dedicated biometric devices) and/or camera-based facial expression analysis.
    *   Data Types: Heart rate variability (HRV), skin conductance (electrodermal activity), facial action units (AU detection).
    *   Sampling Rate: Minimum 10Hz for HRV/EDA, 30Hz for facial analysis.
    *   Preprocessing: Noise filtering, artifact removal, data smoothing.

2.  **Emotional State Estimation Engine:**
    *   Algorithm:  Hybrid approach combining machine learning (Support Vector Machines, Random Forests) and physiological modeling.
    *   Emotion Categories:  Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, Disgust, Neutral. (Expandable)
    *   Output:  Probability distribution across emotion categories, reflecting the user's current emotional state.

3.  **Dynamic Palette Generation Module:**
    *   Input:  Emotional state probability distribution.
    *   Color Mapping:  Predefined or learnable mapping between emotions and color ranges. (e.g., Joy = Warm yellows/oranges, Sadness = Cool blues/greys, Anger = Reds/blacks).  The mapping *learns* over time based on user feedback.
    *   Palette Size: Configurable (e.g., 5-10 colors).
    *   Palette Generation Algorithm:
        *   Weighted color selection based on emotion probabilities.
        *   Color harmony rules (complementary, analogous, triadic) to ensure aesthetic coherence.
        *   Output: Dynamic color palette (RGB, Hex, or other color space representation).

4.  **Affective Image Retrieval Module:**
    *   Image Database:  Large-scale image repository with color metadata (dominant colors, color histograms).
    *   Image Analysis:  Extract dominant colors from each image using k-means clustering or similar techniques.
    *   Emotional Resonance Score:
        *   Calculate the color distance between the image’s dominant colors and the user’s dynamic palette. (Use CIE76 or similar color distance formula).
        *   Weight the color distance by the emotional intensity of the corresponding colors (based on the emotional mapping).
        *   Combine weighted color distances to generate an overall emotional resonance score.
    *   Ranking & Filtering: Rank images based on emotional resonance score.  Provide filtering options (e.g., image category, image style).

5.  **User Interface:**
    *   Real-time visualization of the user's emotional state and generated palette.
    *   Interactive controls for adjusting palette parameters and filtering options.
    *   Feedback mechanism for refining the emotional mapping and palette generation process (e.g., "This palette feels too intense," "I like this color combination").
    *   Ability to save and share palettes.

**Pseudocode for Emotional Resonance Score:**

```
function calculateEmotionalResonanceScore(imageColors, userPalette, emotionalMapping):
  score = 0
  for each color in imageColors:
    closestPaletteColor = findClosestColor(color, userPalette)  // Use CIE76 distance
    emotionalIntensity = emotionalMapping[closestPaletteColor] // Get emotional weight
    colorDistance = calculateColorDistance(color, closestPaletteColor)
    score += (1 - colorDistance) * emotionalIntensity
  return score
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Personalized mood boards & visual inspiration.
*   Adaptive user interfaces that respond to emotional state.
*   Emotional content recommendation systems.
*   Art therapy & emotional expression tools.
*   Marketing & advertising personalization based on real-time emotional response.
