## Dynamic Seed Rotation & Biometric Correlation

**Concept:** Augment the OTP system with a dynamically rotating seed value, correlated to biometric data of the user, to provide an extra layer of security and account for potential seed compromise. This isn't about *replacing* the OTP, but layering on top of it, making the seed itself more resilient.

**Specifications:**

**1. Seed Generation & Rotation Module (SG&RM):**

*   **Input:** User Biometric Data (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint – selectable), a master seed known *only* to the provider, and a time component.
*   **Process:**
    1.  The SG&RM hashes the user's biometric data with the master seed *and* the current time (down to the second).
    2.  The output of this hash becomes the device-specific seed value.
    3.  This seed is *not* static. It rotates every X minutes (configurable, default 5 minutes).  The rotation is based on a predictable algorithm known to both the SG&RM and the device, driven by the current time.
    4.  The algorithm should be based on a cryptographic one way function.
*   **Output:** Device-specific seed value.

**2. Device Integration:**

*   The device must be capable of capturing/accessing biometric data.
*   The device stores the rotation algorithm *not* the seed itself.
*   The device requests a “time sync” from the provider server at regular intervals (e.g., every minute). This isn't for absolute time, but to ensure the device's rotation algorithm stays synchronized with the server.
*   The device uses the synchronized time and the rotation algorithm to derive the current seed value.

**3. OTP Generation Modification:**

*   The existing OTP generation process is modified to *incorporate* the dynamically rotated seed value.
*   Instead of just a master seed, the OTP generation utilizes the combination of the device-specific seed (derived from biometrics) *and* a provider-controlled component.
*   The OTP generation hash function becomes: `OTP = Hash(MasterSeed + DeviceSeed + Time)`

**4. Verification System Modification:**

*   The verification system *cannot* directly access the biometric data.
*   The verification system receives the attempted OTP code.
*   The verification system requests the current time from the device (via API call).
*   The verification system independently derives the device-specific seed (using only the time received from the device and the rotation algorithm).
*   The verification system then recreates the expected OTP hash using the Master Seed, the derived Device Seed, and the time.
*   If the recreated hash matches the received OTP, the authentication succeeds.

**5. Failure Handling & Account Recovery:**

*   If biometric data is unavailable (e.g., fingerprint scanner failure), a secondary authentication method (e.g., PIN, security question) is required.
*   Account recovery mechanisms must *not* rely on biometric data directly.

**Pseudocode (Verification System):**

```
function verifyOTP(otp_received, device_id, time_from_device):
  device_seed = deriveDeviceSeed(time_from_device) // uses rotation algorithm
  expected_otp = hash(master_seed + device_seed + time_from_device)

  if expected_otp == otp_received:
    return true
  else:
    return false
```

**Innovation:** This adds a constantly rotating, biometric-linked seed to the existing OTP system, making seed compromise significantly harder. While biometric data is not transmitted or stored on the verification server, it provides a powerful secondary factor tied directly to the device, enhancing security. It's more than just multi-factor authentication; it’s a dynamically adapting security layer.
