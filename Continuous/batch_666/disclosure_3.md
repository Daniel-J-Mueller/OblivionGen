## Dynamic Threat Landscape Simulation & Predictive Mitigation

**Concept:** Leverage the graph-based threat modeling described in the patent to create a dynamic simulation environment. Instead of *reacting* to detected threats, proactively simulate potential attack vectors within the resource graph *before* they occur, and pre-emptively adjust security postures.

**Specs:**

**1. Simulation Engine Core:**

*   **Input:** The resource graph generated by the patent’s system.  Nodes represent resources, edges represent relationships (network connections, data flow, dependencies).  Also accepts real-time system telemetry (CPU usage, network traffic, process creation).
*   **Attack Vector Library:** A database of known attack patterns (e.g., privilege escalation, data exfiltration, denial of service), represented as graph traversal algorithms. Each algorithm defines a sequence of actions an attacker might take.
*   **Simulation Execution:**
    *   The engine iterates through the attack vector library.
    *   For each vector, the engine attempts to traverse the resource graph, starting from a potential entry point (e.g., an externally facing service).
    *   Traversal success/failure depends on the current security posture of the involved resources (firewall rules, access control lists, software versions, active defenses).
    *   Each traversal step logs the attempted action, the resource involved, and the outcome (success/failure).
*   **Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each simulated attack vector based on:
    *   Probability of success (determined by the simulation).
    *   Potential impact (data loss, system downtime, financial loss).
    *   Severity of vulnerabilities exploited.

**2. Predictive Mitigation Module:**

*   **Automated Policy Adjustment:** Based on simulation results, automatically adjust security policies to mitigate predicted threats.
    *   **Example:** If the simulation reveals a vulnerability in a web server allowing remote code execution, automatically update the web server software or deploy a web application firewall (WAF) rule.
    *   Policy adjustments are *staged*. Instead of applying changes directly to the production environment, changes are first applied to a mirrored "shadow" environment for testing and validation.
*   **Security Rule Generation:** Generate new security rules based on simulated attacks.
    *   **Example:** If the simulation identifies a potential data exfiltration path, automatically create a firewall rule to block that specific traffic pattern.
*   **Adaptive Resource Allocation:** Dynamically allocate security resources (e.g., intrusion detection system (IDS) sensors, honeypots) to protect critical resources identified by the simulation.

**3.  "What-If" Analysis Interface:**

*   Allow security analysts to manually modify the resource graph or attack vector library.
*   Run simulations with the modified parameters to assess the impact of different security configurations or potential threats.
*   Visualize simulation results using interactive graphs and dashboards.

**Pseudocode – Simulation Step:**

```
function simulateAttack(attackVector, resourceGraph, securityPosture):
  currentResource = attackVector.entryPoint
  path = []

  while currentResource != null:
    path.append(currentResource)

    nextResource = null
    for edge in currentResource.outgoingEdges:
      if edge.targetResource is reachable(currentResource, edge.targetResource, securityPosture):
        nextResource = edge.targetResource
        break

    if nextResource == null:
      return path, "Attack Failed"

    currentResource = nextResource

  return path, "Attack Succeeded"
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Resource`: Node in the graph, containing metadata (OS version, installed software, access control lists).
*   `Edge`:  Connection between resources, defining the type of relationship (network connection, data flow).
*   `AttackVector`:  Sequence of actions an attacker might take, defined as a graph traversal algorithm.
*   `SecurityPosture`: Set of security rules and configurations applied to the resources.
