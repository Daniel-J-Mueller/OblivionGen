## Adaptive Iconography - "FlowState"

**Concept:** A user interface element system where iconography *morphs* based on real-time user biometrics and application context, aiming to reduce cognitive load and enhance intuitive interaction.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Input:** Integration with wearable sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, eye tracking).  Application-level permission required for data access.  Data is processed *locally* on the device; only aggregated 'state' signals are sent to the UI.

2.  **State Definition:** Define core ‘FlowStates’ –  e.g., ‘Focused’, ‘Stressed’, ‘Relaxed’, ‘Distracted’. These are determined by an algorithm analyzing biometric data. A baseline is established per user during initial setup.

3.  **Iconographic Library:** A foundational library of vector-based icons.  Each icon has multiple ‘morph’ variations – subtle alterations to shape, color, and animation. Variations are designed to be visually associated with the FlowStates. For example:

    *   A “play” icon might become more angular and vivid red when ‘Stressed’, indicating urgency.
    *   A “settings” icon might soften in color and feature a slow, pulsing animation when ‘Relaxed’, implying a non-critical, exploratory state.
    *   A ‘message’ icon could slightly increase in size and brighten when 'Focused' to draw attention.

4.  **Contextual Awareness:** The UI considers the *application* currently in use. This influences which icon morphs are applied.  A ‘compose’ icon in an email app will have different morphs than a ‘build’ icon in a coding environment.

5.  **Morph Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    function applyIconMorph(iconID, flowState, applicationContext):
        // Retrieve base icon vector data
        baseIcon = getIconData(iconID)

        // Retrieve morph variations for the current FlowState and application
        morphVariations = getMorphs(iconID, flowState, applicationContext)

        // If no specific morphs are available, use a default scaling/color shift
        if morphVariations is empty:
            morphVariations = getDefaultMorph(flowState)

        // Apply morph to base icon (vector-based transformation)
        morphedIcon = applyVectorTransformations(baseIcon, morphVariations)

        return morphedIcon
    ```

6.  **Animation System:** Subtle, flowing animations are crucial. Avoid abrupt changes. Morphing should be smooth and organic, reinforcing the ‘FlowState’. Animations are driven by device frame rate, optimized for performance.

7.  **User Customization:**  Allow users to adjust the intensity of morphing and the overall aesthetic.  Offer pre-defined themes (e.g., ‘Minimalist’, ‘Vibrant’).

8.  **Accessibility:**  Provide options to disable morphing entirely or to use high-contrast visual cues for users with visual impairments.  Audio cues can accompany morphs as an additional signal.

9.  **API:** Expose an API for developers to integrate FlowState into their applications, allowing them to define custom morphs and behaviors.
