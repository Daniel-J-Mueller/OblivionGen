## Dynamic Resource Allocation with Predictive Burst Handling

**Concept:** Extend the token bucket approach to incorporate predictive burst handling. Instead of solely reacting to current resource usage, proactively anticipate potential bursts in demand and pre-allocate resources. This moves beyond reactive throttling to a predictive, preventative system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Metrics:** Collect historical usage data *per tenant* and *per resource type*. Key metrics include:
    *   Request rate (requests/second)
    *   Request size (data volume/request)
    *   Request duration (processing time/request)
    *   Time of day/day of week patterns
    *   Correlation between different resource types (e.g., database requests preceding compute spikes)
*   **Modeling:** Employ time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM neural networks) to predict future resource demand for each tenant and resource type.  The models should generate probabilistic forecasts, providing confidence intervals around the predictions.  Retrain models periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) using updated usage data.
*   **Burst Definition:** Define "bursts" based on exceeding statistically significant thresholds derived from the probabilistic forecasts (e.g., 95th percentile upper confidence bound).

**2. Pre-Allocation & Shadow Buckets:**

*   **Shadow Buckets:** For each tenant, maintain a "shadow bucket" in addition to the standard token bucket. The shadow bucket represents the predicted future demand based on the forecasting model.
*   **Pre-Allocation:** Based on the shadow bucket, *proactively* reserve a portion of the available resources. This pre-allocation does *not* consume the tenantâ€™s standard token bucket. Resources remain available for other tenants until the tenant actually initiates a request.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor actual usage against predicted usage. If actual usage consistently exceeds predictions, increase the pre-allocation. If actual usage is consistently lower, decrease pre-allocation.

**3. Hybrid Throttling & Prioritization:**

*   **Standard Bucket Enforcement:** Continue to use the existing token bucket system for standard throttling and ensuring fair resource allocation.
*   **Pre-Allocation Advantage:** When a request arrives, *first* check if pre-allocated resources are available. If so, fulfill the request using these resources *without* consuming tokens from the standard bucket.
*   **Hybrid Handling:** If pre-allocated resources are insufficient, fulfill the request using tokens from the standard bucket.
*   **Priority Queues:** Implement priority queues to prioritize requests that can be fulfilled using pre-allocated resources. This helps minimize latency and ensure a smoother user experience.

**4.  Pseudocode:**

```
function processRequest(tenantId, resourceType, requestSize):
  // 1. Check pre-allocation
  preAllocatedResources = getPreAllocatedResources(tenantId, resourceType)
  if preAllocatedResources >= requestSize:
    fulfillRequestUsingPreAllocation(tenantId, resourceType, requestSize)
    return SUCCESS

  // 2. Check standard bucket
  tokensAvailable = getTokens(tenantId)
  if tokensAvailable >= requestSize:
    chargeTokens(tenantId, requestSize)
    fulfillRequestUsingTokens(tenantId, resourceType, requestSize)
    return SUCCESS

  // 3. Throttle request
  throttleRequest(tenantId)
  return FAILURE
```

**5. Scalability & Monitoring:**

*   **Distributed Architecture:** Implement a distributed architecture for the forecasting models and resource allocation system to handle a large number of tenants and resources.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Monitor key metrics such as forecast accuracy, pre-allocation effectiveness, and throttling rates to identify areas for improvement.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify administrators when forecast accuracy falls below a certain threshold or throttling rates exceed acceptable levels.
