## Adaptive Environmental Sonification via Beacon Network

**Concept:** Extend proximity-based automation to incorporate real-time environmental data and translate it into localized, adaptive soundscapes. Instead of *controlling* devices, the system uses beacons to curate an auditory experience reflecting the environment around a network-addressable device.

**Specifications:**

**1. Beacon Enhancement:**

*   **Multi-Sensor Integration:** Beacons must be upgraded to incorporate environmental sensors: temperature, humidity, air quality (CO2, VOCs), light level, ambient sound level.
*   **Mesh Networking:** Beacons should form a self-healing mesh network to ensure robust data transmission and coverage, even in large spaces.
*   **Edge Processing:**  Beacons incorporate microcontrollers capable of basic data processing (averaging, filtering) before transmission. This reduces network load.

**2. Central Server (Sonification Engine):**

*   **Data Aggregation:** Receives sensor data from beacon network.
*   **Sonification Mapping:**  Defines how environmental data translates into sound parameters:
    *   Temperature -> Pitch
    *   Humidity -> Volume
    *   Air Quality -> Timbre/Instrument selection
    *   Light Level -> Stereo Panning
    *   Ambient Sound -> Layered sound effects
*   **Sound Synthesis:**  Utilizes a modular sound synthesis engine capable of generating a wide range of sounds (tones, textures, ambient loops).  Must support both pre-defined sound palettes and real-time sound generation.
*   **Device Profiles:** Maintains profiles for network-addressable devices, specifying audio output capabilities and preferred sound palettes.
*   **Dynamic Soundscape Generation:**  Creates a localized soundscape tailored to the environmental data and device profile.

**3. Network-Addressable Device Integration:**

*   **Audio Output:** Devices must have audio output capabilities (speakers, headphone jacks, Bluetooth audio).
*   **Proximity Detection:** Devices continue to detect beacon signals to establish location.
*   **Soundscape Reception:** Devices receive the dynamic soundscape from the central server.
*   **User Customization:** Devices may offer basic user customization of the soundscape (volume, overall tone).

**Pseudocode (Central Server):**

```
function processBeaconData(beaconID, sensorData):
    // sensorData = {temperature, humidity, airQuality, lightLevel, ambientSound}

    // Fetch device profiles associated with beaconID

    // Map sensor data to sound parameters (using defined mappings)
    soundParameters = mapSensorDataToSound(sensorData)

    // Generate soundscape based on sound parameters and device profile
    soundscape = generateSoundscape(soundParameters, deviceProfile)

    // Send soundscape to network-addressable devices in proximity to beaconID
    sendSoundscapeToDevices(soundscape, devices)
```

**Example Scenario:**

A user enters a room. Their smartphone detects a beacon. The beacon transmits environmental data (temperature: 22C, humidity: 60%, air quality: good). The central server maps this data to a calming ambient soundscape: a soft, evolving synth pad, subtle rain sounds, and a gentle breeze. The soundscape is streamed to the user's phone via Bluetooth headphones.  If the air quality degrades, the soundscape might incorporate a slightly dissonant tone, alerting the user to a potential issue.
