## Dynamic Gaze-Contingent Environmental Adjustment

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing gaze tracking hardware (IR emitters, camera – as per patent).
    *   Smart environment control interface (compatible with existing ‘smart home’ standards – Zigbee, Z-Wave, WiFi).
    *   Ambient lighting system (RGB LED array capable of dynamic color/intensity control).
    *   Spatial audio system (array of speakers capable of directional sound).
    *   Optional: Haptic feedback system (localized vibration/temperature control).

*   **Software:**
    *   Gaze tracking module (refined from patent’s core technology – precision + calibration algorithms).
    *   Environmental control API (communication bridge between gaze tracking and smart environment).
    *   Dynamic Adjustment Engine (core logic – detailed below).
    *   User Profile Database (stores preferred environmental settings per user).
    *   Contextual Awareness Module (integrates external data - time of day, weather, calendar events).

**Dynamic Adjustment Engine – Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialize: Load user profile, establish environment control connection

LOOP:

    // 1. Gaze Data Acquisition:
    gaze_x, gaze_y = GetGazeCoordinates() // From Gaze Tracking Module

    // 2. Zone Determination:
    zone = DetermineGazeZone(gaze_x, gaze_y)  // Divide display/environment into zones (e.g., top-left, bottom-right)

    // 3. Contextual Data:
    time_of_day = GetCurrentTime()
    weather = GetCurrentWeather()
    event = GetCurrentCalendarEvent()

    // 4. Setting Calculation:
    settings = CalculateEnvironmentSettings(zone, time_of_day, weather, event, user_profile)

    // 5. Environmental Adjustment:
    AdjustLighting(settings.lighting_color, settings.lighting_intensity)
    AdjustAudio(settings.audio_direction, settings.audio_volume, settings.audio_profile)
    AdjustHaptics(settings.haptic_intensity, settings.haptic_location)

    //Delay for X milliseconds (adjust based on responsiveness needs)

END LOOP
```

**Detailed Function Breakdown:**

*   `DetermineGazeZone(gaze_x, gaze_y)`: Divides the display area (and consequently the surrounding physical environment) into distinct zones.  The algorithm maps gaze coordinates to these zones, triggering specific environmental adjustments based on the focused area.  For instance, gazing at the upper-left quadrant might subtly brighten lights in that area of the room, enhancing focus.
*   `CalculateEnvironmentSettings(...)`:  The core logic. This function integrates gaze zone, time of day, weather, calendar events, and user preferences to determine optimal environmental settings.
    *   Time of day:  Brighter, cooler lighting for mornings, warmer, softer lighting for evenings.
    *   Weather:  Subtly adjust lighting color temperature to counteract gloomy weather (brighter, warmer tones).
    *   Calendar Events: If a meeting is scheduled, subtly increase lighting brightness and reduce audio ambience.
    *   User Preferences: Load pre-defined profiles for each user, tailoring settings to their individual tastes.
*   `AdjustLighting()`, `AdjustAudio()`, `AdjustHaptics()`:  These functions directly control the smart environment devices, applying the calculated settings. The system will feature a smooth transition between settings, preventing jarring changes.
*   Haptic Feedback: Utilizing localized temperature and vibration, for subtle cues. Example: A slight cooling sensation when focusing on a document, or a gentle vibration to indicate an incoming notification.



**Innovation Rationale:**

This system goes beyond passive unlock/authentication.  It leverages gaze tracking to create a *responsive* and *adaptive* environment, subtly enhancing user experience and productivity.  The goal is to create a near-seamless connection between the digital and physical worlds, responding intuitively to user focus and activity. The modular approach allows customization and integration with a wide range of smart home devices.
