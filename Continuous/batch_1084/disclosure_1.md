## Predictive Anomaly Scoring with Temporal Graph Embeddings

**Concept:** Augment the existing graph-based anomaly detection with a predictive scoring mechanism leveraging temporal graph embeddings. Instead of solely reacting to anomalous activity *as it happens*, predict potential anomalous paths *before* they fully materialize, allowing for proactive intervention.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Graph Embedding Generation:**

*   **Input:** Event graph (as defined in the provided patent), event timestamps.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Temporal Edge Weighting:** Assign weights to edges based on the time elapsed between connected events. Shorter time deltas increase weight, longer deltas decrease it.  This captures event sequence importance. Formula: `weight = exp(-α * Δt)`, where `Δt` is the time difference and `α` is a tuning parameter.
    *   **Dynamic Graph Construction:** Create a series of ‘snapshot’ graphs at regular time intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes, tunable). Each snapshot captures the graph state at that moment.
    *   **Node Embedding Generation:**  Utilize a Graph Neural Network (GNN) – specifically, a Temporal Graph Network (TGN) – to generate embeddings for each node (entity) in each snapshot graph. TGNs are designed to capture temporal dependencies. Example:  A multi-layered perceptron trained on node features and neighboring edge features.
    *   **Temporal Embedding Concatenation/Aggregation:**  For each node, concatenate or average the embeddings generated from successive snapshots. This creates a ‘temporal embedding’ that represents the node’s behavior over time.  The averaging can be weighted, giving more importance to recent embeddings.
*   **Output:**  A dictionary mapping each entity (node) to its temporal embedding vector.

**2. Anomaly Prediction Model:**

*   **Input:** Temporal embeddings, current event stream (real-time events).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Path Encoding:** For each incoming event connecting entity A to entity B:
        *   Retrieve the temporal embeddings for A and B.
        *   Construct a ‘path encoding’ vector by concatenating the embeddings of the nodes involved in the *potential* path (i.e., considering a limited number of hops beyond A and B).
        *   Encode the directionality of the edge (A->B) into the path encoding.
    *   **Anomaly Scoring:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a transformer) to predict an ‘anomaly score’ based on the path encoding. The model is trained on historical event data labeled with anomalies.
    *   **Thresholding & Alerting:** If the anomaly score exceeds a predefined threshold, trigger an alert and initiate interdiction procedures.
*   **Output:**  Anomaly score, alert status.

**3. Proactive Interdiction & Pattern Identification:**

*   **Process:**
    *   **Simulate Potential Paths:** When a high anomaly score is generated, don’t just react; use the trained model to *simulate* potential paths that could lead to further anomalous activity.
    *   **Weighted Interdiction:** Assign different levels of interdiction based on the simulated risk. For example, a low-risk path might trigger monitoring, while a high-risk path triggers immediate communication suspension.
    *   **Anomaly Pattern Database:** Store the simulated paths and associated anomaly scores in a database to identify recurring patterns and refine the prediction model.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Prediction Model):**

```python
def predict_anomaly(entity_A_embedding, entity_B_embedding, current_event):
    path_encoding = concatenate(entity_A_embedding, entity_B_embedding, current_event.features) #concatenate embeddings
    anomaly_score = anomaly_prediction_model.predict(path_encoding) #predict anomaly score
    return anomaly_score
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   GPU-accelerated server for training and running the GNN and anomaly prediction model.
*   Scalable database for storing event data, temporal embeddings, and anomaly patterns.
*   Real-time event processing pipeline.
*   Machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
