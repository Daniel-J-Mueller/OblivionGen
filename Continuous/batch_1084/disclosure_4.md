## Dynamic Occlusion Prediction & Assisted Tracking

**Concept:** Extend the multi-camera tracking system with predictive modeling of occlusions *before* they happen, leveraging camera geometry and learned behavioral patterns. This isn't simply detecting *when* an occlusion happens, but anticipating *where* and *when* a subject might be hidden from certain cameras *before* it occurs, and proactively adjusting tracking parameters.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing multi-camera array, dedicated GPU for prediction model execution.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Occlusion Prediction Engine (OPE):*  Core module. Input: synchronized camera feeds, 3D subject model (from existing tracking), camera calibration data, behavioral database (see below). Output: Probability map of occlusion for each camera, time-to-occlusion estimate.
    *   *Behavioral Database (BDB):* Stores observed subject trajectories, interaction patterns, and typical movement speeds. Training data sourced from extended tracking sessions. Structured as a graph database to represent common actions & transitions.
    *   *Tracking Parameter Adjustment Module (TPAM):*  Receives outputs from OPE. Dynamically adjusts tracking parameters (e.g., Kalman filter covariance, search radius, feature weighting) *proactively* for cameras predicted to lose visibility.
    *   *Confidence Scoring Module:* Combines OPE probability with current tracking confidence.  Signals potential track loss before it occurs, allowing for smoother handoffs between cameras.

**Pseudocode (OPE):**

```
function predictOcclusion(camera_id, subject_3d_model, camera_calibration, behavioral_database):
  # 1. Geometric Analysis:
  potential_occluders = identify_objects_between(camera_id, subject_3d_model)
  visibility_loss_time = calculate_time_to_occlusion(potential_occluders, subject_3d_model)

  # 2. Behavioral Prediction:
  predicted_trajectory = predict_next_position(subject_3d_model, behavioral_database)

  # 3. Combine Predictions:
  occlusion_probability =  (visibility_loss_time AND predicted_trajectory) #Combine.  Low time + trajectory heading INTO occluder = High Probability

  # 4. Output:  Probability Map + Time Estimate
  return occlusion_probability, time_estimate
```

**Detailed Function Breakdown:**

*   **`identify_objects_between`**: Ray tracing from camera to subject's 3D model. Flags any intervening objects as potential occluders.
*   **`calculate_time_to_occlusion`**: Based on relative velocities and distances. Uses physics calculations to estimate how long until full occlusion.
*   **`predict_next_position`**: Queries BDB for similar trajectories. Uses a weighted average of observed actions to predict the most likely next position.
*   **TPAM Actions:**
    *   **Increased Search Radius:**  For cameras predicted to lose visibility, expand the search area for the subject.
    *   **Kalman Filter Covariance Adjustment:** Temporarily increase noise variance to allow for larger deviations in predicted positions.
    *   **Feature Weighting:** Prioritize tracking features visible from cameras with higher confidence.
    *   **Inter-Camera Handoff Prioritization**:  Cameras predicted to maintain visibility are given increased weight in inter-camera tracking data fusion.



**Innovation:** This moves beyond reactive occlusion handling to a proactive system. By anticipating occlusions, the tracking system can maintain smoother, more reliable tracking even in complex environments. The BDB component allows the system to learn environment-specific behavior, enhancing prediction accuracy.
