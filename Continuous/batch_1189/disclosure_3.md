## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-emptive Routing

**Concept:** Leverage machine learning to predict potential network disruptions *before* they occur, and proactively adjust routing to avoid those disruptions. This goes beyond reactive monitoring and remediation outlined in the provided patent.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time network telemetry (latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization, error rates) - as per the base patent.
    *   Historical network performance data (spanning months/years).
    *   External data feeds:
        *   Geopolitical events (potential infrastructure impacts).
        *   Weather patterns (severe weather impacting connectivity).
        *   Scheduled maintenance windows (planned outages).
        *   Social media feeds (reports of localized outages – processed for signal/noise).
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   Time-series decomposition of network metrics.
    *   Correlation analysis between different network segments.
    *   Anomaly detection using statistical methods (e.g., moving averages, standard deviations).
    *   Creation of 'risk scores' for individual network links and nodes based on historical and real-time data.
    *   Embedding of external data (geopolitical, weather) into the risk score calculation.

**2. Prediction Model:**

*   **Model Type:**  Hybrid approach – combining time-series forecasting with graph neural networks (GNNs).
*   **Time-Series Component:**  LSTM or Transformer models to predict near-future network performance based on historical data.  Predict key metrics (latency, packet loss) for each link.
*   **GNN Component:**  Represent the network as a graph, where nodes are network devices and edges are links. The GNN learns the relationships between network elements and predicts potential failures based on the current state of the network and the predicted performance from the time-series component.  Edge weights represent predicted risk scores.
*   **Training Data:** Large dataset of historical network performance data, labeled with known outages and disruptions.  Use reinforcement learning to refine the model based on observed performance.

**3. Proactive Routing Engine:**

*   **Path Computation:** Uses a modified Dijkstra’s or Bellman-Ford algorithm.  Instead of minimizing traditional metrics (latency, bandwidth), the algorithm minimizes the *predicted risk* based on the output of the prediction model.
*   **Dynamic Route Adjustment:** Continuously monitors the predicted risk scores and adjusts routes in real-time to avoid potential disruptions.
*   **Traffic Steering:**  Load balancing across multiple paths based on predicted risk and capacity.
*   **"Shadowing" Mechanism:**  Before switching traffic to a new path, perform a ‘shadow test’ – send a small amount of traffic over the new path to verify its performance.
*   **Constraint-Based Routing:**  Allow administrators to define constraints on routing (e.g., prioritize certain paths, avoid specific regions).

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Distributed Architecture:** Deploy prediction models and routing engines at multiple points within the network to reduce latency and improve scalability.
*   **Data Pipeline:**  Real-time data ingestion, processing, and feature engineering using tools like Kafka, Spark, and TensorFlow.
*   **API Integration:**  Expose APIs for integrating with existing network management systems and orchestrating routing changes.
*   **GUI/CLI:**  Provide a user interface for visualizing network topology, predicted risks, and routing changes.

**Pseudocode (Routing Engine):**

```
function compute_optimal_path(source, destination):
  risk_map = get_predicted_risk_map()
  paths = find_all_paths(source, destination)
  optimal_path = null
  min_risk = infinity

  for path in paths:
    total_risk = 0
    for link in path:
      total_risk += risk_map[link]

    if total_risk < min_risk:
      min_risk = total_risk
      optimal_path = path

  return optimal_path
```

**Novelty:**  The core innovation is the proactive use of machine learning to *predict* network disruptions before they occur, allowing the system to preemptively adjust routing and avoid outages.  This goes beyond the reactive monitoring and remediation described in the base patent. The combination of time-series forecasting and GNNs provides a robust and accurate prediction model.
