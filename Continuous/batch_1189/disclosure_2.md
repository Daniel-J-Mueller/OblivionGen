## Adaptive Audio Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Leveraging the low-latency audio pipeline to create a real-time, spatial audio reconstruction of the user's environment, enabling augmented reality (AR) experiences or advanced noise cancellation/audio focusing.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing microphone array on device (smartphone, tablet, etc.). Minimum 3 microphones recommended, though performance scales with array size.
    *   High-speed processor for real-time signal processing.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - accelerometer, gyroscope – for head/device tracking.
    *   Optional: Depth sensor (ToF, structured light) for improved spatial mapping.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Low-Latency Audio Capture:** Utilizing the existing pipeline for minimal delay.
    *   **Beamforming & Source Localization:** Implement algorithms (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, MUSIC, or deep learning-based techniques) to determine the direction-of-arrival (DoA) of sound sources.  The IMU data compensates for device movement.
    *   **Spatial Audio Reconstruction Engine:**  Creates a 3D “sound map” of the environment.  Each detected sound source is represented as a point in space with associated audio data (frequency, amplitude, etc.).
    *   **AR Integration Module:** (Optional)  Exports the sound map data to an AR framework (e.g., ARKit, ARCore).  Allows AR applications to visually represent sound sources or interact with the audio environment.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering & Noise Cancellation:**  Based on the reconstructed sound map, intelligently filters out unwanted noise or focuses on specific sound sources.
    *   **Real-time Raytracing Module:** Utilizes the reconstructed sound map to simulate sound propagation. This can create a more realistic and immersive audio experience.

**Pseudocode (Spatial Audio Reconstruction):**

```
// Input:  Array of audio signals from microphones
//         IMU data (orientation, acceleration)

function reconstructSpatialAudio(audioSignals, imuData) {

  // 1. Preprocessing: Noise reduction, signal normalization
  preprocessedSignals = preprocessAudio(audioSignals);

  // 2.  Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) Estimation
  doaEstimates = estimateDOA(preprocessedSignals); // Using beamforming or other techniques

  // 3.  Source Localization: Convert DoA to 3D coordinates
  //     Use IMU data to account for device orientation and movement
  sourceLocations = localizeSources(doaEstimates, imuData);

  // 4.  Sound Map Creation:  Organize sources into a 3D map
  soundMap = createSoundMap(sourceLocations, preprocessedSignals);

  // 5.  Optional:  Apply raytracing to simulate sound propagation

  return soundMap;
}
```

**Innovation & Refinement:**

*   **Dynamic Sound Map Updates:** Real-time update the sound map based on changing audio and device position.
*   **Semantic Audio Understanding:** Integrate with speech recognition and object detection to identify *what* is making the sound. (e.g., “car horn”, “person speaking”).
*   **Personalized Audio Profiles:** Learn the user’s acoustic environment and adjust the sound map accordingly.
*   **Sound Source Isolation:**  Allows the user to focus on a specific sound source while suppressing others.
*   **Audio “Zoom”:**  Simulate moving closer to or further from a sound source.

**Potential Applications:**

*   AR/VR experiences
*   Advanced noise cancellation for headphones/earbuds
*   Improved speech recognition in noisy environments
*   Accessibility features for the hearing impaired
*   Smart home applications (e.g., voice-controlled devices that respond to specific sound sources)
*   Enhanced teleconferencing experiences.
