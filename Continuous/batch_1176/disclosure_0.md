## Modular Sensor Array with Bio-Mimicry

**Concept:** A distributed sensor array mimicking the olfactory system of insects, capable of detecting a wider range of hazardous gases beyond smoke and CO, and pinpointing their *source* within a defined area.  The aesthetic moves away from the typical plastic housing, opting for a more organic, almost fungal-like design.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Modules:** Individual "petal" shaped modules (~5cm diameter, 2cm height) containing micro-cantilever gas sensors. Each module specializes in detecting a specific gas (CO, smoke particulate, methane, ammonia, VOCs, etc.).  Each module communicates wirelessly (LoRaWAN preferred for range, Bluetooth for local data).
*   **Array Configuration:**  Modules are mounted on a central, organically shaped base (~20cm diameter).  The base contains the primary processor, power source (rechargeable battery, potentially solar assisted), and wireless communication hub. The number of petals is configurable (6-12 recommended).  Modules can be individually replaced/upgraded.
*   **Bio-Inspired Airflow:**  The base incorporates a micro-fan system creating a laminar airflow *over* the sensor petals. This airflow is not constant. It emulates insect antennae "flicking" â€“ short bursts of airflow directed across each petal in a semi-random pattern.  Pattern is algorithmically generated. This enhances detection sensitivity and allows for triangulation.
*   **Triangulation Algorithm:** Data from each petal is fed into a triangulation algorithm. This algorithm estimates the direction and distance to the gas source based on the relative signal strength received by each petal, factoring in airflow patterns.
*   **Visual Feedback:**  The base incorporates RGB LEDs. The color and intensity of the LEDs indicate the *type* of gas detected and the *proximity* of the source. The LEDs aren't static; they pulse and shift in color to visually represent the gas plume location.
*   **Housing Material:** Bio-plastic composite with a textured surface mimicking fungal mycelium. The housing is designed to promote airflow and diffuse light from the LEDs.  Color options: earthy tones (browns, greens, grays).
*   **Power:** Wireless charging via Qi standard. Battery life of 72 hours minimum.  Low power sleep mode.

**Pseudocode (Triangulation Algorithm - Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION triangulate(signalStrengths[], airflowPattern[])
  // signalStrengths is an array of signal strengths from each petal
  // airflowPattern is the airflow direction/speed during each reading
  
  maxSignal = MAX(signalStrengths)
  maxIndex = INDEX_OF(signalStrengths, maxSignal)
  
  //Calculate angle relative to max signal.
  angle = (maxIndex * (360/number of petals)) 

  //Factor in airflow influence
  adjustedAngle = angle + airflowPattern[maxIndex] 
  
  distance = 1 / signalStrength[maxIndex] //Simplified inverse relationship
  
  RETURN (adjustedAngle, distance)
END FUNCTION

//Main Loop:
FOREACH petal IN sensorPetals:
  signalStrength[petal] = readSensorValue(petal)
  //Get the latest airflow pattern for this petal.
END FOREACH

location = triangulate(signalStrength, airflowPattern)
displayLocation(location)
```

**Future Development:**  Incorporate machine learning to improve gas identification accuracy and predict potential hazards based on environmental conditions. Integrate with smart home systems for automated response (e.g., ventilation activation, emergency alerts).
