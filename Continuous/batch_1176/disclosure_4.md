## Adaptive Precision Scaling for Neural Network Layers

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the precision (number of bits) used for each layer *within* a neural network during inference, based on real-time sensitivity analysis. This goes beyond static quantization by responding to the input data itself.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on asymmetric quantization and reducing precision. This builds on that by *optimizing* where that reduction occurs. Some layers are more sensitive to quantization errors than others. This system aims to minimize error *while* maximizing compression.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Neural network hardware accelerator (as described in the patent claims). Modified to include a Sensitivity Analysis Engine (SAE) and a Precision Control Unit (PCU).
*   **SAE:** A small, dedicated circuit that runs alongside the main network computation. Takes input data and forward-propagates it through a simplified, representative model of each layer. Calculates an error metric (e.g., mean squared error of layer outputs) for different quantization levels.
*   **PCU:** Receives sensitivity data from the SAE and dynamically configures the quantization parameters (number of bits, scaling factors) for each layer *before* the main computation begins.
*   **Software:** A calibration phase (offline) to establish baseline sensitivity profiles for representative datasets. Runtime adaptation based on input characteristics.

**Algorithm (Runtime Adaptation):**

1.  **Input Data Analysis:** When a new input arrives, a small subset of data is fed to the SAE.
2.  **Sensitivity Estimation:** The SAE runs simplified forward passes for each layer, testing different quantization levels (e.g., 8-bit, 6-bit, 4-bit).  Error metrics are calculated.
3.  **Precision Map Generation:** The PCU creates a "precision map" â€“ a table indicating the optimal number of bits for each layer based on the error metrics.
4.  **Layer Configuration:** The PCU configures the hardware accelerator, setting the quantization parameters for each layer according to the precision map.
5.  **Inference:** The main neural network computation proceeds with the dynamically adjusted precision.

**Pseudocode (PCU Configuration):**

```
function configure_layers(precision_map, accelerator_hardware):
  for layer_index in range(num_layers):
    precision = precision_map[layer_index]
    accelerator_hardware.set_quantization_precision(layer_index, precision)
  end for
end function
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `precision_map`: Array of integers. Each integer represents the number of bits for the corresponding layer.
*   `layer_config`: Struct containing quantization parameters (precision, scale, zero point) for each layer.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Layer Grouping:** Group similar layers together and apply the same quantization level to reduce overhead.
*   **Adaptive Scaling:** Dynamically adjust scaling factors along with precision.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Use error metrics from downstream layers to refine quantization decisions in upstream layers.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Incorporate memory and compute constraints into the optimization process.
