## Dynamic Contextual Cue Weighting & Predictive Reflow

**Concept:** Expand beyond static contextual cue analysis to a system that *learns* and dynamically weights the importance of different cues based on document style, author tendencies, and even predicted reader engagement. Simultaneously, proactively reflow content *before* page breaks based on this dynamic weighting, rather than reacting to them.

**Specs:**

**1. Cue Data Collection & Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Digital document (text, images, formatting).
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze document for all potential contextual cues (indentation, punctuation, capitalization, spacing, grammar, font style, image proximity, section headers, list formatting, etc.).
    *   Extract features from each cue:
        *   **Magnitude:** Strength of the cue (e.g., indentation depth, font size).
        *   **Position:** Location of the cue relative to text boundaries.
        *   **Frequency:** Occurrence rate of the cue within the document/section.
        *   **Co-occurrence:** Frequency of other cues appearing nearby.
*   **Output:** Feature vector for each contextual cue within the document.

**2. Style & Author Profiler Module:**

*   **Input:** Document content, author metadata (if available), document style information (from feature extraction).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ machine learning (e.g., clustering, classification) to identify document style characteristics (e.g., formal vs. informal, technical vs. narrative).
    *   If author metadata exists, build an author profile based on previous writing style patterns.
*   **Output:** Style classification, author profile (if available), associated weighting biases for different cues.

**3. Predictive Reflow Engine:**

*   **Input:** Feature vectors, Style classification, Author profile (weighting biases), current page content.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Dynamic Cue Weighting:** Adjust the weight of each cue based on style, author, and learned preferences. A formal document might prioritize punctuation, while a narrative document might emphasize indentation.
    *   **Continuation Probability Calculation:** For each potential page break, calculate the probability of continuation based on weighted cue analysis.
    *   **Proactive Reflow:** *Before* reaching the page limit, proactively adjust text formatting (e.g., spacing, hyphenation) and potentially re-order minor elements to optimize flow and minimize the likelihood of awkward breaks. This could involve subtle re-arrangement of images or short phrases.
    *   **Hypothetical Rendering:** Generate a preview of the rendered document with the proactive reflow applied.
*   **Output:** Reflowed document content, preview of rendered document.

**4. Feedback & Learning Module:**

*   **Input:** Editor feedback on predicted continuation status, actual page breaks.
*   **Process:**
    *   Capture editor corrections to predicted continuation status.
    *   Use reinforcement learning to adjust cue weights and improve prediction accuracy over time.
    *   Identify “edge cases” – unusual document structures that consistently cause prediction errors – and flag them for manual review.
*   **Output:** Updated cue weights, improved prediction model.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Reflow Engine – core logic):**

```
function predict_continuation(text_group, context, style, author_profile):
  cue_vectors = extract_cues(text_group, context)
  weighted_scores = apply_weights(cue_vectors, style, author_profile)
  continuation_probability = calculate_probability(weighted_scores)
  return continuation_probability

function apply_weights(cue_vectors, style, author_profile):
  for each cue in cue_vectors:
    cue.weight = base_weight * style_multiplier * author_multiplier
  return weighted_cues

function calculate_probability(weighted_cues):
  // Combine weighted cue scores using a probabilistic model (e.g., logistic regression)
  return probability_score

function proactive_reflow(text, page_limit):
  while page_count < page_limit:
    for each text_group in text:
      continuation_probability = predict_continuation(text_group, context, style, author_profile)
      if continuation_probability > threshold:
        // Attempt to adjust formatting to avoid a break
        adjust_spacing(text_group)
        adjust_hyphenation(text_group)
        if still_likely_to_break:
          // Reorder minor elements (e.g., move a short phrase to the next paragraph)
          reorder_elements(text_group)
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond reactive continuation detection to *proactive* content reflow. The dynamic cue weighting and learning capabilities allow the system to adapt to a wider range of document styles and author preferences, creating a more seamless reading experience.
