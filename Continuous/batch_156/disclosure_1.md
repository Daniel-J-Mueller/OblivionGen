## Dynamic Contextual List Manipulation – "Orb Weaver"

**Concept:** Expand the ‘flipping list’ idea beyond simple addition/removal to a fully dynamic, context-aware list manipulation system visualized as interconnected “orbs” representing list items and their associated actions.

**Specs:**

**1. Visual Representation:**

*   List items are represented as glowing “orbs” in a 3D space. Orb size corresponds to item priority/value (user customizable).
*   Orbs are dynamically linked based on relationships – purchases frequently bought together, items within a category, complementary items, etc.  Link thickness/color represents relationship strength.
*   The user interface is a navigable 3D space.  The user can "fly" through the orb network or use a point-and-click interface.

**2. Core Interactions:**

*   **Add Item:**  Dragging an item *towards* the orb network creates a tether. Releasing adds the item. The system suggests optimal orb placement based on relationships.
*   **Remove Item:** Dragging an orb *away* from the network removes it.  A temporary “ghost” orb remains for a short period to prevent accidental removals.
*   **Modify Quantity/Details:** “Pinching” an orb opens a radial menu with modification options. Options are contextually relevant (e.g., size/color choices for clothing).
*   **Relationship Exploration:** Selecting a link between orbs highlights associated items and displays information about the relationship (e.g., “Customers who bought this also bought…”).

**3. Contextual Actions & "Weaving":**

*   The system analyzes user behavior and data (purchase history, browsing data, location, time of day, etc.) to suggest contextual actions. These are presented as glowing “threads” extending from an orb.
*   **Example:** If the user adds hiking boots, a thread might appear suggesting a hiking backpack, waterproof socks, or a trail map.
*   The user can "weave" these threads together to create custom bundles or scenarios.  Weaving strengthens the link between orbs.
*   **“Scenario Mode”:** The user can create named scenarios (e.g., “Camping Trip,” “Weekend Getaway”). The system automatically populates the scenario with appropriate orbs and suggestions.

**4. Pseudocode – Core Interaction Loop**

```
FUNCTION HandleUserInteraction(inputEvent)
    IF inputEvent.type == "DragStart" AND inputEvent.target == "Item" THEN
        CreateTether(inputEvent.target, "OrbNetwork")
    ELSE IF inputEvent.type == "DragEnd" AND inputEvent.target == "OrbNetwork" THEN
        AddOrbToNetwork(inputEvent.source)
        CalculateOrbPlacement(inputEvent.source) // based on relationships
        UpdateOrbNetworkVisuals()
    ELSE IF inputEvent.type == "Pinch" AND inputEvent.target == "Orb" THEN
        DisplayRadialMenu(inputEvent.target)
    ELSE IF inputEvent.type == "Select" AND inputEvent.target == "OrbLink" THEN
        HighlightRelatedOrbs(inputEvent.target)
        DisplayRelationshipInfo(inputEvent.target)
    END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**5.  Data Structures:**

*   `Orb`: Contains item data (name, image, price, etc.), position in 3D space, list of connected Orbs, visual properties.
*   `OrbLink`: Represents the connection between two Orbs. Contains strength value, relationship type, visual properties.
*   `Scenario`: Contains a list of Orbs and OrbLinks, a name, and user-defined metadata.

**6.  Hardware Considerations:**

*   Ideally suited for Augmented Reality (AR) or Virtual Reality (VR) environments.
*   Can be adapted for traditional 2D screens with a zoomable/rotatable interface.
*   Haptic feedback can be used to simulate the “feel” of weaving threads.
