## Dynamic Dataset Sharding with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the read-only database service to proactively shard datasets *based on anticipated query patterns*, not just size and transaction rate. Introduce predictive prefetching, bringing data closer to clients *before* requests are even made, leveraging AI to model access patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Query Pattern Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw query logs (anonymized/aggregated for privacy), dataset metadata (schema, data types, relationships).
*   **Process:** Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model query sequences. The LSTM should predict the *next* likely query based on a sliding window of previous queries.  This goes beyond simple frequency analysis – it captures *relationships* between queries.
*   **Output:** A "Query Access Probability Map" – a data structure indicating the probability of each data element (or range of elements) being accessed in the near future (e.g., next 5 seconds, next minute).  This map is updated continuously.

**2. Dynamic Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Query Access Probability Map, Dataset Metadata, Current Shard Configuration.
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate a "Shard Entropy" metric for each existing shard. Higher entropy indicates more diverse data within the shard.
    *   Identify shards with high entropy *and* a low probability of satisfying future queries (based on the Query Access Probability Map).
    *   Split these high-entropy/low-probability shards into smaller shards, strategically moving data based on the predicted access patterns. This ensures that frequently accessed data is concentrated in fewer, more focused shards.
    *   Create new shards based on predicted access patterns.
*   **Output:** Updated Shard Configuration, Data Migration Plan.

**3. Predictive Prefetching Service:**

*   **Input:** Query Access Probability Map, Client Location (optional - for geo-distributed deployments).
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on the Query Access Probability Map, identify data elements likely to be accessed by clients.
    *   Proactively fetch this data from the shards and cache it in a geographically distributed cache layer (e.g., a CDN or edge servers).
    *   Prioritize prefetching based on a “Prefetch Score” calculated from the access probability, data size, and network latency.
*   **Output:** Prefetched data cached in geographically distributed cache layer.

**4. Client Library Integration:**

*   Client library receives updated shard configuration and prefetch hints from the service.
*   Client library automatically redirects queries to the appropriate shard.
*   Client library verifies cached data exists before making a request to the shard.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Service):**

```
function prefetch_data():
  access_map = QueryPatternAnalysisModule.get_access_probability_map()
  for data_element, probability in access_map:
    prefetch_score = probability * data_size / network_latency
    if prefetch_score > threshold:
      data = ReadOnlyDatabase.get(data_element)
      CacheService.put(data_element, data)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Query Access Probability Map:**  `Dictionary<DataElement, Probability>`
*   **Shard Configuration:** `List<Shard>` (Shard = `List<DataElement>`)
*   **Prefetch Score:** `Float`

**Scalability:**

*   Sharding and caching are inherently scalable.
*   The Query Pattern Analysis Module can be parallelized across multiple machines.
*   The system should be designed to handle a high volume of queries and data updates.
