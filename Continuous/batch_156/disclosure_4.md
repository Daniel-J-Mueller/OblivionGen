## Dynamic Graph Sharding with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the directed graph resource resolution system with a dynamic sharding capability. Instead of a single, monolithic graph, partition the graph into shards, and predictively move nodes (data sources) between shards based on anticipated query load. This allows for parallel query execution and improved scalability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sharding Algorithm:**

*   **Initial Sharding:** Implement a consistent hashing algorithm to initially distribute data sources across a configurable number of shards (N).  The hash key is derived from a unique identifier of the resource class the data source represents.
*   **Dynamic Re-Sharding:** Monitor query patterns and resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O) for each data source.  Employ a predictive model (e.g., time-series forecasting) to estimate future query load for each data source.
*   **Migration Trigger:** If the predicted load for a data source exceeds a predefined threshold *and* the load on its current shard is above a target level, initiate a migration process.
*   **Migration Process:**  
    *   Temporarily duplicate the data source on the target shard.
    *   Redirect a percentage of incoming queries for that data source to the target shard.
    *   Monitor performance. If successful, remove the data source from the original shard. If unsuccessful, revert to the original shard.  This must be transactional.
    *   Migration decisions should prioritize minimizing query latency, maximizing throughput, and balancing shard load.
*   **Shard Metadata:** Maintain a globally accessible shard metadata service. This service maps resource classes to shard IDs.  This service must be highly available and consistent.

**2. Query Routing Layer:**

*   **Shard-Aware Resolver:** Modify the resource resolver to be shard-aware.
*   **Lookup:** Before issuing any queries, the resolver consults the shard metadata service to determine the correct shard for each data source involved in the query sequence.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Issue queries to multiple shards in parallel, maximizing throughput.
*   **Result Aggregation:**  Aggregate results from different shards into a single response.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** If a shard is unavailable, the resolver should attempt to route the query to a replica shard or fall back to an alternate query sequence.

**3. Predictive Modeling Component:**

*   **Data Collection:** Collect historical query logs, resource utilization metrics, and external factors (e.g., time of day, day of week, special events).
*   **Model Training:** Train a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future query load for each data source.
*   **Real-time Prediction:** Use the trained model to make real-time predictions of query load.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Continuously retrain the model with new data to improve accuracy.

**4. API Extensions:**

*   **Shard Management API:** Provide an API for administrators to manage shards, monitor performance, and trigger manual migrations.
*   **Configuration API:** Allow configuration of sharding parameters (e.g., number of shards, migration thresholds, prediction models).

**Pseudocode (Migration Process):**

```
function migrateDataSource(dataSource, sourceShard, targetShard):
  // Duplicate dataSource on targetShard
  duplicateDataSource(dataSource, targetShard)

  // Start redirecting percentage of queries to targetShard (e.g., 10%)
  redirectPercentageOfQueries(dataSource, targetShard, 0.1)

  // Monitor performance (latency, throughput, error rate)

  if performanceIsAcceptable():
    incrementRedirectPercentage(dataSource, targetShard, 0.1) // gradually increase
    repeat until redirectPercentage is 1.0
    removeDataSource(dataSource, sourceShard)
    logSuccess("Migration successful")
  else:
    revertRedirectPercentage(dataSource, sourceShard)
    logFailure("Migration failed")
```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Shard metadata service should be horizontally scalable.
*   Query routing layer should be stateless and highly available.
*   Predictive modeling component should be able to handle large volumes of data.
