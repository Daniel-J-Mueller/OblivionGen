## Predictive Cache Pre-population via Federated Learning

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic class determination to incorporate federated learning principles, allowing for prediction of content demand *before* observation at any single cache component. This shifts the system from reactive pre-loading to proactive anticipation, maximizing cache hit rates and minimizing latency.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Edge Agent (EA)** – Deployed on client devices (smartphones, smart TVs, IoT devices) and gathers anonymized usage data (content requests, app usage, time of day, location – optional and user-permissioned).  EA performs initial data processing (feature extraction) and model training *locally*. Data is *never* directly uploaded.

*   **Component 2: Federated Aggregation Server (FAS)** – A central server responsible for orchestrating the federated learning process. FAS *does not* have access to raw client data. It receives model updates (gradients) from EAs.

*   **Component 3: Content Prediction Engine (CPE)** – Integrated with the FAS. CPE utilizes the aggregated federated learning model to predict content demand for specific geographical regions or user segments *before* requests are received at cache components.

*   **Component 4: Cache Orchestration System (COS)** –  Controls the pre-population of content at CDN cache components based on predictions from the CPE. 

**Workflow:**

1.  **Local Training (EA):** Each EA trains a local model based on its user’s behavior. The model predicts the probability of requesting different content items.

2.  **Model Aggregation (FAS):** The FAS periodically requests model updates (gradients) from a randomly selected subset of EAs.  It aggregates these updates using a secure aggregation protocol (e.g., differential privacy) to create a global model.

3.  **Content Prediction (CPE):** The CPE uses the global model to predict content demand for specific regions or user segments.  This prediction considers contextual factors (time of day, day of week, local events).

4.  **Cache Pre-population (COS):** The COS identifies the cache components closest to the predicted demand and instructs them to pre-populate the predicted content.  The COS prioritizes content based on predicted demand and available cache space.

**Pseudocode (Cache Orchestration System):**

```
FUNCTION prePopulateCache(region, contentList, priority)

  // Identify cache components serving the specified region
  cacheComponents = getCacheComponents(region)

  // Sort cache components by available space (descending)
  sortedCacheComponents = sort(cacheComponents, by: availableSpace, descending: true)

  // Iterate through sorted cache components
  FOR EACH cacheComponent IN sortedCacheComponents

    // Check if content is already present
    FOR EACH content IN contentList
      IF content NOT IN cacheComponent.content
        // Preload content with specified priority
        preloadContent(cacheComponent, content, priority)
        break // Move to the next cache component
      ENDIF
    ENDFOR
  ENDFOR
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **EA:** Local Model (e.g., neural network), User Behavior Log (encrypted).
*   **FAS:** Aggregated Model, List of participating EAs.
*   **CPE:** Prediction Model, Demand Forecast (content, region, timestamp, probability).
*   **COS:** Cache Component List (location, available space, current content).

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive pre-loading based on observed behavior to *proactive* prediction driven by federated learning, enabling significantly improved cache hit rates and reduced latency.  The use of federated learning addresses privacy concerns associated with centralized data collection.
