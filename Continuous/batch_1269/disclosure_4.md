## Dynamic Light Diffusion with Micro-Lens Array

**Concept:** Enhance light uniformity and viewing angles by integrating a dynamic micro-lens array *within* the front light layer itself, controlled via localized dimming/illumination.

**Specs:**

*   **Front Light Layer Material:** Transparent polymer infused with liquid crystal micro-lenses (similar to those used in advanced LCDs, but optimized for light diffusion).
*   **Micro-Lens Array Density:** 500-1000 lenses per square inch, each lens diameter 50-100 microns.
*   **Lens Control:** Each micro-lens is individually addressable, with the ability to dynamically adjust focal length (via applied voltage) or switch between diffuse and focused states.
*   **Light Source:** Edge-mounted LED array, with precisely controlled intensity for each LED.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Ambient light sensor and optional eye-tracking sensor.
*   **Control Algorithm:**
    *   **Ambient Light Compensation:** Adjust LED intensity and micro-lens configuration to maintain consistent brightness in varying lighting conditions.
    *   **Viewing Angle Optimization:** Utilize eye-tracking data (if available) to focus light distribution towards the userâ€™s gaze, increasing perceived brightness and contrast.
    *   **Dynamic Brightness Zones:** Divide the display area into multiple zones, with independent brightness and micro-lens control for each zone.
*   **Light Barrier Adaptation:** Modify the light barrier material (foam, epoxy etc.) to include a micro-texture designed to scatter any stray light exiting the dynamic light layer.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Read Ambient Light Level
  ambientLight = readAmbientLightSensor();

  // 2. If Eye Tracking Enabled:
  if (eyeTrackingEnabled) {
    userGazeX = readEyeTrackingX();
    userGazeY = readEyeTrackingY();
  }

  // 3. Divide Display into Zones (e.g., 9 zones)
  for (zone = 0; zone < 9; zone++) {
    // 4. Calculate Zone Brightness based on ambient light and user gaze
    if (zone contains userGaze) {
      zoneBrightness = maxBrightness * (1 - ambientLightScale);
    } else {
      zoneBrightness = baseBrightness * (1 - ambientLightScale);
    }

    // 5. Set LED intensity for each zone
    setLEDIntensity(zone, zoneBrightness);

    // 6. Adjust micro-lens configuration for each zone
    setMicroLensConfiguration(zone, zoneBrightness); //e.g. focal length, diffusion level
  }
  delay(16ms); // approx 60 FPS
}
```

**Innovation:**  This approach moves beyond static light diffusion to create a highly adaptive display system. By combining individual LED control with a dynamically adjustable micro-lens array, it can optimize light distribution for varying ambient conditions and viewing angles, significantly enhancing the user experience and perceived image quality. The micro-texture light barrier further minimizes extraneous light.
