## Adaptive Resonance Alarm System

**Concept:** An alarm system that learns and adapts to the ambient soundscape, minimizing false positives and maximizing responsiveness to *unexpected* sound events. It moves beyond simple threshold detection to contextual awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Minimum of 8 MEMS microphones arranged in a circular pattern (diameter: 15cm).  Each microphone has a frequency response of 20Hz - 20kHz +/- 3dB.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) with a minimum of 1 TeraFLOPS of processing power.  Must support TensorFlow Lite or similar edge AI framework.
*   **Memory:** 8GB LPDDR5 RAM. 64GB eMMC storage.
*   **Power:**  5V USB-C, or 3.7V Li-ion battery (min 2000mAh).
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5.0.
*   **Alarm Output:** 90dB Piezoelectric buzzer, configurable frequency range (500Hz-3kHz).  Optional relay output for external devices.

**Algorithm/Software:**

1.  **Ambient Sound Profiling (Initialization Phase):**
    *   System passively records ambient sound for a defined period (e.g., 24 hours).
    *   Sound data is converted into spectrograms.
    *   A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is trained on the spectrograms to create a "baseline sound model" representing the typical soundscape.  The GAN learns the probability distribution of common sounds.
    *   The GAN is designed to *reconstruct* the typical soundscape, allowing it to identify deviations.

2.  **Real-time Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Incoming audio is converted into a spectrogram.
    *   The trained GAN attempts to reconstruct the incoming spectrogram.
    *   A "reconstruction error" metric (e.g., Mean Squared Error) is calculated.  High reconstruction error indicates an anomalous sound.

3.  **Adaptive Thresholding:**
    *   The threshold for triggering the alarm is *not* fixed.
    *   The system continuously monitors the reconstruction error during normal operation.
    *   A moving average of the reconstruction error is calculated.
    *   The alarm threshold is set dynamically as a multiple of the moving average (e.g., 3x the moving average). This allows the system to adapt to changing ambient noise levels.

4.  **Sound Classification (Optional):**
    *   A separate Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained to classify sounds (e.g., "glass breaking", "siren", "human voice").
    *   If a sound is classified as a critical event, the alarm is immediately triggered, bypassing the adaptive threshold.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Initialization Phase:
Train GAN on ambient sound data to create 'baseline_model'

// Real-time Loop:
Record audio -> spectrogram
reconstruction_error = baseline_model.reconstruct(spectrogram)
moving_average = calculate_moving_average(reconstruction_error)
threshold = moving_average * 3  // Adjustable multiplier

if reconstruction_error > threshold:
    Trigger alarm
```

**Novelty:**

This system differs from typical alarm systems by its use of a GAN to learn the ambient soundscape.  This allows it to adapt to changing conditions and significantly reduce false positives.  The dynamic thresholding further improves reliability. The combination of generative modeling and adaptive thresholding represents a novel approach to alarm design.
