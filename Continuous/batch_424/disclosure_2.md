## Autonomous Swarm Docking & Item Consolidation

**Concept:** Expand the robotic warehouse system to include a ‘swarm’ of smaller, independently navigating robots capable of docking with barges *while the barge is in motion*. These robots consolidate smaller items *onto* the barge from multiple processing stations simultaneously, increasing throughput and reducing reliance on single-point loading/unloading.

**Specifications:**

*   **Robot Designation:** ‘Flicker’ Units. Dimensions: 30cm x 30cm x 15cm. Payload Capacity: 5kg.
*   **Locomotion:** Omnidirectional wheels with magnetic adhesion for secure barge docking.
*   **Docking System:**  Electro-permanent magnets integrated into base. Communication via short-range RF to coordinate docking/release.  Docking speed: Up to 0.5 m/s relative to moving barge.
*   **Item Manipulation:**  Miniature, multi-axis robotic arm with suction/gripper end-effector. Capable of picking and placing items of varying size and fragility.
*   **Power:** Wireless inductive charging from barge power grid (supplemented by internal battery for emergency operation).
*   **Communication:** Mesh network linking all Flicker units and central warehouse controller.
*   **Barge Interface:** Barge surface embedded with inductive charging pads and fiducial markers for Flicker unit localization. Each barge designated with a ‘Flicker Zone’ map defining safe operating areas.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Localization Module:**  SLAM algorithm using onboard cameras, IMU, and fiducial marker recognition.
    *   **Path Planning Module:** Dynamic path planning algorithm accounting for barge movement, Flicker unit positions, and obstacle avoidance.
    *   **Task Allocation Module:**  AI-powered task assignment system distributing items to Flicker units based on proximity, capacity, and processing station availability.
    *   **Collision Avoidance System:** Redundant sensor system (LiDAR, ultrasonic) for preventing collisions between Flicker units and warehouse infrastructure.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Central controller receives order information.
    2.  Controller assigns items to appropriate processing stations.
    3.  Flicker units autonomously navigate to processing stations.
    4.  Flicker units pick up items.
    5.  Flicker units dock with moving barge in designated ‘Flicker Zone’.
    6.  Flicker units transfer items to designated locations on barge.
    7.  Flicker units undock and return to processing stations or standby mode.
*   **Safety Protocols:**
    *   Emergency stop button on each Flicker unit.
    *   Geofencing to prevent Flicker units from leaving designated operating areas.
    *   Remote override capability for human operators.
    *   Automated obstacle detection and avoidance system.
