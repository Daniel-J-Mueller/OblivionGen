## Adaptive Campaign Sequencing via Predictive Journey Mapping

**Specification:** A system and method for dynamically sequencing advertisement campaigns based on predicted user journey completion probability. This builds on the core idea of predicting user actions but expands it beyond simple ‘next action’ prediction to a full journey map, and uses this to orchestrate multi-stage campaigns.

**Core Concept:** Instead of simply targeting users who haven't purchased after viewing a product page (as per the patent), this system predicts the *probability of completing an entire user journey* (e.g., awareness -> consideration -> purchase -> advocacy). It then sequences campaigns to maximize this probability.

**System Components:**

1.  **Journey Definition Module:** Allows marketers to define standard user journeys for different products/services (e.g., "First Time Home Buyer Journey"). Each journey is comprised of sequential ‘Journey Steps’ (e.g., "View Blog Post", "Download Guide", "Request Consultation", "Schedule Showing", "Submit Offer", "Close Deal").
2.  **Probability Engine:** Utilizes a machine learning model (trained on historical user data, similar to the existing patent’s model) to calculate the probability of a user completing each Journey Step, *and* the overall Journey. This engine considers user attributes, past actions, contextual data (time of day, location), and potentially external factors. The model is continuously updated with real-time performance data.
3.  **Campaign Library:** A repository of pre-designed advertisement campaigns, each mapped to specific Journey Steps. Campaigns are categorized by objective (awareness, consideration, conversion, etc.) and target audience.
4.  **Orchestration Engine:** This is the core of the system. It continuously monitors users, calculates their Journey Completion Probability, and dynamically sequences campaigns to maximize this probability. 

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - runs continuously for each user

For each User:
    Calculate JourneyCompletionProbability(User, Journey)
    
    If JourneyCompletionProbability < Threshold:
        Determine NextBestCampaign(User, Journey) // Based on current Journey Step & lowest probability step
        DeliverCampaign(User, NextBestCampaign)
        LogCampaignDelivery(User, NextBestCampaign)
    
    UpdateModel(User, CampaignPerformance) // Retrain the probability engine with real-time data

// Function: CalculateJourneyCompletionProbability
Function CalculateJourneyCompletionProbability(User, Journey):
    Probability = 1.0
    For each Step in Journey:
        StepProbability = ProbabilityEngine.Predict(User, Step)
        Probability = Probability * StepProbability
    Return Probability

// Function: DetermineNextBestCampaign
Function DetermineNextBestCampaign(User, Journey):
    LowestProbabilityStep = FindStepWithLowestProbability(User, Journey) // Step with the biggest performance improvement potential
    Campaign = FindCampaignMatchingStep(LowestProbabilityStep)
    Return Campaign
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed user action logs (website visits, app usage, email opens, ad clicks, purchases).
*   Journey definitions (defining the steps in each user journey).
*   Campaign metadata (objectives, target audiences, creative assets).
*   Real-time campaign performance data (clicks, conversions, revenue).

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond predicting individual actions. It predicts *journey completion*, allowing for proactive orchestration of multi-stage campaigns. It dynamically adapts to user behavior, maximizing the likelihood of conversion and building long-term customer relationships. The focus shifts from simply targeting potential customers to *guiding* them through a desired journey. This also opens opportunities for personalized journey mapping, where the system creates unique journeys for each user based on their individual needs and preferences.
