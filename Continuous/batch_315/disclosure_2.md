## Adaptive Acoustic Zones with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend beamforming beyond simple speech isolation to create localized ‘acoustic zones’ around a user's head, dynamically adjusting to their activity and environment. Integrate haptic feedback to enhance the perception of these zones.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Existing wearable microphone array (as described in the provided patent).
*   **Haptic Array:** An array of micro-actuators embedded in the wearable (e.g., in a headband or collar). These actuators will deliver localized vibrations. Minimum 32 actuators, spaced approximately 2cm apart.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** High-precision 9-axis IMU to track head/body orientation and movement with a sampling rate of 200Hz.
*   **Proximity Sensors:** Short-range (0-50cm) proximity sensors (e.g., infrared or ultrasonic) mounted on the wearable to detect nearby objects and people.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge-based processor capable of running real-time beamforming algorithms, sensor fusion, and haptic control.

**2. Software Architecture:**

*   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Combines data from the microphone array, IMU, and proximity sensors to create a dynamic environmental model.
*   **Activity Recognition Module:** Uses IMU data to classify user activity (e.g., walking, talking, listening, static).
*   **Acoustic Zone Definition Module:** Defines virtual ‘acoustic zones’ around the user’s head based on activity, environmental context, and user preferences. These zones are not necessarily spherical; they can be customized shapes.
*   **Beamforming Control Module:** Dynamically adjusts the beamforming parameters to focus on sounds within the defined acoustic zones while suppressing sounds outside of them.
*   **Haptic Feedback Control Module:** Maps the acoustic characteristics of the zones (e.g., sound intensity, direction) to haptic patterns delivered through the haptic array. 
*   **User Interface:** Mobile app to customize acoustic zone parameters, haptic feedback patterns, and activity profiles.

**3. Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Sensor Data Acquisition
    micData = acquireMicrophoneData();
    imuData = acquireIMUData();
    proximityData = acquireProximityData();

    // 2. Activity Recognition
    activity = recognizeActivity(imuData);

    // 3. Environmental Modeling
    environmentModel = buildEnvironmentModel(proximityData);

    // 4. Acoustic Zone Definition
    acousticZones = defineAcousticZones(activity, environmentModel, userPreferences);

    // 5. Beamforming Control
    beamformingParameters = calculateBeamformingParameters(acousticZones);
    applyBeamforming(micData, beamformingParameters);

    // 6. Haptic Feedback Control
    hapticPattern = generateHapticPattern(acousticZones);
    applyHapticFeedback(hapticPattern);

    // 7. Update User Interface (optional)
    updateUI();
}
```

**4. Haptic Mapping Examples:**

*   **Sound Direction:** Vary the intensity of vibration in actuators corresponding to the direction of a sound source.
*   **Sound Intensity:** Map sound intensity to the frequency or amplitude of vibration.
*   **Zone Boundaries:** Create a subtle vibration at the edges of the acoustic zones to enhance awareness of the boundaries.
*   **Alerts/Notifications:** Use distinct haptic patterns to signal important events or notifications (e.g., incoming calls, alarms).

**5.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Personalized Acoustic Profiles:** Learn user preferences and automatically adjust acoustic zone parameters.
*   **Social Awareness Mode:**  Allow specific sounds (e.g., human speech) to penetrate the acoustic zones, enabling social interaction.
*   **Integration with Augmented Reality (AR):**  Combine acoustic zones with AR visuals to create immersive experiences.
*   **Directional Sound Projection:** Utilize multiple miniature speakers integrated into the wearable to project sound directly into the user’s ears, enhancing the perception of localized audio.
