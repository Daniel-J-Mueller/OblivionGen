## Temporal Data Reconstruction via Predictive Caching

**Concept:** Extend the snapshot and deletion-marking system to *predict* future deletions based on access patterns, proactively caching data *before* a snapshot to optimize snapshot creation time and reduce storage footprint. This moves beyond simply excluding deleted data *during* snapshot creation to preemptively reducing the data needing to be included in the first place.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Cache Manager (PCM) â€“ software module integrated with the block device driver and file system.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Access History Table (AHT):* Records access times, frequency, and type (read/write) for data blocks on the storage units. Indexed by storage unit ID and block address.
    *   *Deletion Probability Map (DPM):* Derived from the AHT, assigning a probability score to each data block indicating the likelihood of future deletion.  Algorithm:  (Recent Access Count / Total Access Count) * (1 - Age of Last Access).  Higher scores indicate higher probability.
    *   *Predictive Cache:* Dedicated high-speed storage (e.g., NVMe SSD) for caching frequently accessed and potentially soon-to-be-deleted data.

*   **Workflow:**

    1.  **Monitoring:** PCM continuously monitors data access via the block device driver. Access information is logged into the AHT.
    2.  **Probability Calculation:**  A background process periodically (e.g., every 5 minutes) calculates deletion probabilities for each data block based on the AHT and stores results in the DPM.
    3.  **Proactive Caching:**  Based on a configurable threshold (e.g., DPM score > 0.7), PCM proactively copies data blocks predicted to be deleted to the Predictive Cache.  Data is copied in a read-only state.
    4.  **Snapshot Integration:**  During snapshot creation:
        *   PCM provides the snapshot process with a list of data blocks currently in the Predictive Cache that have been marked as deleted.
        *   The snapshot process can *skip* these cached blocks entirely, as they are already stored in a consistent, historical state.
        *   A flag is embedded in the snapshot metadata indicating which blocks were excluded due to predictive caching.
    5.  **Cache Management:**
        *   Blocks in the Predictive Cache are retained for a configurable period (e.g., 24 hours) after being marked as deleted, allowing for rollback or recovery.
        *   Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy is applied to the Predictive Cache when capacity is reached.

*   **Pseudocode (Snapshot Process):**

```
function createSnapshot():
    deletedBlocks = PCM.getDeletedBlocksInCache()
    snapshotData = {}

    for block in storageUnits:
        if block not in deletedBlocks:
            snapshotData[block] = readData(block)

    saveSnapshotMetadata(snapshotData, deletedBlocks)
```

*   **Considerations:**

    *   Requires sufficient Predictive Cache capacity.
    *   False positives in deletion probability calculation can lead to unnecessary caching.  Algorithm tuning is critical.
    *   Data consistency must be maintained between the storage units and the Predictive Cache.
    *   Overhead of monitoring and probability calculation must be minimized to avoid performance degradation.
