# 11429503

**Adaptive Bus Topology Reconfiguration**

**Concept:** Dynamically alter the internal bus topology of the IC to bypass potentially faulty interconnects, building redundancy *after* a hang is detected, rather than just resetting.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** "Bus Weaver" â€“ A dedicated hardware unit integrated within the IC, responsible for monitoring bus transactions and re-routing signals.
*   **Topology:**  Internal bus is not a fixed structure. It consists of multiple parallel data paths and programmable interconnect switches (implemented with multiplexers).
*   **Monitoring:** Bus Weaver continuously monitors data transfer completion flags on each parallel data path. It also tracks transaction latency.
*   **Hang Detection:** When the faux transaction (as described in the provided patent) fails, *instead* of initiating a hard reset, Bus Weaver activates diagnostic routines. These routines send a series of test transactions over individual data paths.
*   **Fault Isolation:** The Bus Weaver identifies the specific data path(s) experiencing hangs.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:**  The Bus Weaver re-routes data traffic around the faulty path(s).  It activates spare data paths, effectively creating a new bus topology. Configuration is performed via programmable interconnect switches.
*   **Transaction Re-attempt:** After reconfiguration, the original (failed) transaction is automatically re-attempted over the new topology.
*   **Performance Adjustment:**  The Bus Weaver dynamically adjusts data transfer rates on the reconfigured bus to optimize performance.
*   **Error Logging:**  All fault detections and reconfiguration events are logged in a dedicated error register.

**Pseudocode (Bus Weaver core logic):**

```
FUNCTION handle_transaction_failure(transaction_ID)
  IF is_first_failure(transaction_ID) THEN
    initiate_diagnostic_routine()
    faulty_paths = identify_faulty_paths()
    reconfigure_bus(faulty_paths)
    retry_transaction(transaction_ID)
  ELSE
    // If retries consistently fail, *then* request hard reset
    request_hard_reset()
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION identify_faulty_paths()
  FOR EACH data_path
    send_test_transaction(data_path)
    IF test_transaction_failed(data_path) THEN
      add_to_faulty_paths(data_path)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
  RETURN faulty_paths
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION reconfigure_bus(faulty_paths)
  FOR EACH switch in interconnect matrix
    IF switch controls a faulty path THEN
      re-route_signal_to_spare_path(switch)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a significant number of programmable interconnect switches.
*   Bus Weaver requires dedicated memory to store the current bus topology configuration.
*   Implementation complexity is high, but offers significant fault tolerance.
*   Overhead from switching operations needs to be minimized.
