## Dynamic Feedback Weighting & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Expand the criterion-based feedback system to not only *gather* feedback but *predict* user preferences and dynamically adjust the presented feedback based on those predictions. Further, incorporate a weighting system that prioritizes feedback based on user history and overall system trends.

**Specifications:**

**1. User Profile Construction:**

*   **Data Points:** Track user interactions with feedback items (clicks, responses, time spent viewing, implicit feedback like scroll depth).
*   **Preference Vectors:** Generate preference vectors for each user based on their responses to different criteria.  These vectors will represent a user's “bias” beyond what’s simply detected by the existing system.  Expand bias detection to include nuanced preferences (e.g., preferring concise answers, detailed explanations, visual responses).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously update preference vectors with each interaction.

**2. Criterion Weighting System:**

*   **Global Trend Analysis:** Analyze feedback across *all* users to identify trending criteria.  Criteria receiving consistently high engagement and positive feedback should be automatically upweighted.
*   **Recency Bias:** Implement a decay function to prioritize recent feedback. Older feedback loses weight over time.
*   **Diversity Bonus:** Implement a system that *slightly* increases the visibility of less-frequently addressed criteria to encourage a broader range of feedback.
*   **Weight Calculation:**
    *   `Criterion Weight = (Global Trend Score * α) + (Recency Score * β) + (Diversity Bonus * γ)`
    *   α, β, and γ are configurable parameters.

**3. Predictive Feedback Presentation:**

*   **Prediction Model:**  Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, neural network) trained on user profiles and criterion weights. The model predicts which criteria a user will find most relevant.
*   **Presentation Logic:**
    1.  Generate a list of candidate criteria based on the item being reviewed.
    2.  Score each criterion using the prediction model.
    3.  Select the top N criteria to present to the user, prioritizing those with the highest scores.
    4.  Introduce a degree of randomization (configurable parameter) to avoid filter bubbles and expose users to a wider range of perspectives.
*   **Adaptive Interface:** Adjust the interface presentation (e.g., question order, visual prominence of certain criteria) based on predicted user preferences.

**4.  "Surprise Me" Feature:**

*   Implement a button that overrides the predictive model and presents a completely random criterion. This encourages exploration and the discovery of unexpected feedback.

**5. Pseudocode (Feedback Presentation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION PresentFeedback(user_id, item_id):
  candidate_criteria = GetRelevantCriteria(item_id)
  scored_criteria = []

  FOR criterion IN candidate_criteria:
    score = PredictRelevance(user_id, criterion)  // Uses prediction model
    scored_criteria.append((criterion, score))

  scored_criteria.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  // Apply Randomization:  Introduce a small chance of swapping elements
  IF random() < randomization_factor:
    swap(scored_criteria[0], scored_criteria[random_index])

  selected_criteria = [criterion FOR criterion, score IN scored_criteria[:N]]  // N = number of criteria to display

  RETURN selected_criteria
```

**6. Data Storage:**

*   User Profiles: Store user preference vectors, interaction history.
*   Criterion Weights: Store global trend scores, recency scores, diversity bonuses.
*   Model Parameters: Store the trained machine learning model and its configuration parameters.
