## Adaptive Resolution Streaming with Predictive Pre-Rendering

**Concept:** Leverage the server-side rendering capability to predictively pre-render multiple frames at *different* resolutions, then stream the optimal resolution frame based on client bandwidth *and* predicted client viewport focus.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Bandwidth Estimator:** Client-side component constantly measuring available bandwidth.
*   **Viewport Focus Predictor:** Client-side AI model predicting where the user is looking (or likely to look) within the game viewport. This could be based on player movement, game events, or even gaze tracking if available.
*   **Multi-Resolution Render Queue:** Server-side component managing a queue of frames to be rendered at multiple resolutions (e.g., 1080p, 720p, 480p).
*   **Adaptive Streaming Manager:** Server-side component responsible for selecting the optimal resolution frame from the queue based on bandwidth and predicted viewport focus.
*   **Frame Interpolation Module:** Server-side â€“ Optional component for smoother transitions between resolutions.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  The client continuously sends bandwidth estimates and viewport focus predictions to the server.
2.  The server receives these signals and adds frames to the Multi-Resolution Render Queue.  Each frame is rendered at multiple resolutions simultaneously. The number of resolutions is configurable.
3.  The Adaptive Streaming Manager selects the optimal resolution frame for each delivery based on:
    *   Current bandwidth.
    *   Predicted viewport focus (higher resolution for focused areas, lower for periphery).
    *   A configurable quality/performance tradeoff.
4.  The selected frame is transmitted to the client.
5.  The Frame Interpolation Module (if enabled) can interpolate between frames of different resolutions to reduce visual artifacts during resolution switching.

**3. Pseudocode (Adaptive Streaming Manager):**

```pseudocode
function select_frame(bandwidth, viewport_focus, frame_queue):
  if bandwidth < MIN_BANDWIDTH:
    resolution = LOWEST_RESOLUTION
  else if bandwidth < MEDIUM_BANDWIDTH:
    resolution = MEDIUM_RESOLUTION
  else:
    resolution = HIGH_RESOLUTION

  # Adjust resolution based on viewport focus
  focused_area_size = calculate_focused_area_size(viewport_focus)
  if focused_area_size < SMALL_AREA:
    resolution = reduce_resolution(resolution, 1) # Reduce resolution slightly
  elif focused_area_size > LARGE_AREA:
    resolution = increase_resolution(resolution, 1) # Increase resolution slightly

  # Select frame from queue
  selected_frame = find_frame_in_queue(frame_queue, resolution)
  if selected_frame is null:
    selected_frame = find_closest_frame_in_queue(frame_queue) #Fallback

  return selected_frame
```

**4.  Server Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPUs capable of rendering multiple frames simultaneously.
*   High-bandwidth network connectivity.
*   Scalable server architecture.
*   Machine learning infrastructure for viewport focus prediction (optional, could be offloaded to client).

**5. Client Software Requirements:**

*   Bandwidth estimation module.
*   Viewport focus prediction module (optional, can be server-side).
*   Video decoding/rendering pipeline.

**6. Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Foveated Rendering Integration:** Combine viewport focus prediction with foveated rendering to dramatically reduce rendering load.
*   **Dynamic Resolution Scaling:** Continuously adjust resolution based on real-time performance metrics.
*   **AI-Powered Scene Analysis:**  Use AI to analyze the game scene and prioritize rendering of visually important areas.
*   **Predictive Frame Generation:**  Generate future frames to reduce latency and improve responsiveness.
