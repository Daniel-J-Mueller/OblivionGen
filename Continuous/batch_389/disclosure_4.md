## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend the environmental audio optimization beyond physical location to incorporate real-time physiological data from users, creating personalized "acoustic zones" that dynamically adjust to individual states of relaxation, focus, or energy.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Non-invasive biometric sensors (integrated into seating, wearables, or ambient sensors):
        *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
        *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR)
        *   Electroencephalography (EEG) – optional, for advanced analysis.
        *   Facial Expression Analysis (via camera) - optional.
    *   Existing environmental sensors (from the base patent): Microphone arrays, object detection.

2.  **Data Processing & AI Engine:**
    *   Real-time physiological data stream acquisition and preprocessing (noise filtering, artifact removal).
    *   AI model trained to correlate physiological patterns with desired cognitive/emotional states (relaxation, focus, energy, stress).  This will require substantial initial data collection and labeling.
    *   State estimation:  Continuous assessment of each user’s current state based on biometric data.
    *   Acoustic profile assignment: User profiles define preferred audio characteristics for each state (EQ, reverb, volume, genre preferences, soundscapes).
    *   Zone definition:  Algorithm dynamically creates localized “acoustic zones” around each user based on their location and state, prioritizing individual audio experiences within a shared space.

3.  **Audio Rendering & Speaker Control:**
    *   Multi-channel audio engine capable of rendering individualized audio streams to localized zones.
    *   Smart speaker array: Speakers with beamforming capabilities, dynamically directing audio to specific zones. Support for both traditional speakers and phased array/holographic audio devices.
    *   Individual speaker volume and EQ control.
    *   Acoustic environment mapping: The system learns and adapts to the acoustic properties of the environment (room shape, materials) to optimize sound delivery.

4.  **User Interface & Control:**
    *   Mobile app for user profile creation, biometric sensor connection, and state preference configuration.
    *   Voice control for state selection ("Activate focus mode," "Play relaxing soundscape").
    *   Ambient visual feedback: Subtle lighting cues to indicate current acoustic zone and state.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Data Acquisition
  biometricData = getBiometricDataFromSensors()
  environmentalData = getEnvironmentalData()

  // 2. State Estimation
  userState = estimateUserState(biometricData) // AI Model

  // 3. Audio Profile Selection
  audioProfile = selectAudioProfile(userState)

  // 4. Acoustic Zone Creation & Rendering
  zoneMap = createAcousticZoneMap(userLocations, userStates)
  renderAudio(zoneMap, audioProfile)

  // 5. Environmental Adaptation (ongoing learning)
  adaptToEnvironment(environmentalData) //Room acoustics data
}

function estimateUserState(biometricData) {
  // AI Model: Trained on biometric data to classify user state
  // Input: HRV, GSR, EEG, Facial Expression Data
  // Output: User State (Relaxed, Focused, Energetic, Stressed)
}

function createAcousticZoneMap(userLocations, userStates) {
  // Creates a map defining acoustic zones around each user
  // Algorithm: Prioritize zones based on user state and location.
  // Considerations: Overlap, proximity, user preferences.
}

function renderAudio(zoneMap, audioProfile) {
  // Renders audio to each zone based on the selected audio profile
  // Utilizes beamforming and multi-channel audio rendering techniques
}
```

**Novelty:** Current systems focus on *physical* location. This extends that to *physiological* state, enabling a truly personalized and adaptive audio experience. This could be applied to home theaters, offices, meditation spaces, or even therapeutic settings.
