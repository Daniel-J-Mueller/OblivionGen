## Personalized Offer ‘Ecosystem’ – Dynamic Contextual Bundling

**Concept:** Expand beyond single product offers and leverage transaction data to construct dynamic, personalized ‘ecosystems’ of bundled products tailored to evolving user context.  Instead of suggesting ‘related’ or ‘similar’ products, create temporary, incentivized groupings that address perceived *needs* as they arise, rather than just past purchases.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Transaction History (as per the patent)
    *   Real-time Contextual Data:
        *   Location (GPS/WiFi)
        *   Time of Day/Day of Week
        *   Weather (API integration)
        *   Calendar Integrations (with user permission): Identify upcoming events, travel plans, etc.
        *   Social Media Feeds (optional, with explicit user consent): Infer current interests/activities.
        *   Connected Device Data (IoT):  Smart home devices (e.g., running low on coffee, printer ink), vehicle data (mileage, maintenance needs).
*   **Ecosystem Builder Module:**
    *   **Need Inference Engine:** Analyze combined data to infer current/anticipated user needs. (e.g., user at airport + rainy weather = potential need for umbrella, travel pillow, noise-canceling headphones).  Utilize machine learning models trained on historical purchase data correlated with contextual factors.
    *   **Product Affinity Mapping:** Dynamically calculate affinity scores between products based on combined transaction data and contextual factors.  This goes beyond simple ‘people who bought X also bought Y’ – it considers *when* and *where* purchases occurred.
    *   **Bundling Algorithm:** Create temporary product bundles (Ecosystems) with optimized pricing based on affinity scores, inventory levels, and profit margins.  Price the Ecosystem *below* the sum of individual product prices to incentivize purchase. Include a ‘timer’ to create scarcity.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Monitor user interaction with Ecosystem offers (views, clicks, purchases) and continuously refine the bundling algorithm and pricing model.

*   **User Interface:**
    *   "Ecosystems For You" Section: Dedicated area within the user’s app/website displaying personalized Ecosystems.
    *   Contextual Pop-ups: Display relevant Ecosystems based on current location/context (e.g., airport Ecosystem when user arrives at the airport).
    *   "Build Your Own Ecosystem" Option: Allow users to customize Ecosystems by adding/removing products.

**Pseudocode (Ecosystem Builder Module):**

```
function buildEcosystem(userID, currentContext) {
  needs = inferNeeds(userID, currentContext);
  candidateProducts = getRelevantProducts(needs);
  affinityScores = calculateAffinityScores(candidateProducts, userID);
  ecosystem = selectBestProducts(affinityScores, budget, inventory);
  price = calculateEcosystemPrice(ecosystem);
  return {
    products: ecosystem,
    price: price,
    timer: 60 // minutes
  };
}

function inferNeeds(userID, currentContext) {
    // Integrate Data: Transaction History, Location, Weather, Calendar, IoT.
    // Machine Learning Model predicts needs based on integrated data.
    return predictedNeeds;
}

function getRelevantProducts(needs) {
    // Filter Product Catalog based on predicted needs.
    return relevantProducts;
}

function calculateAffinityScores(products, userID) {
    // Calculate affinity between products based on historical transaction data,
    // contextual factors, and user preferences.
    return affinityScores;
}

function selectBestProducts(scores, budget, inventory) {
    // Select products based on affinity scores, budget, and inventory levels.
    return selectedProducts;
}

function calculateEcosystemPrice(products) {
    // Calculate price of ecosystem based on individual product prices,
    // affinity scores, and desired profit margin.
    return ecosystemPrice;
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple recommendations or bundling by *proactively* anticipating needs based on a holistic view of user context, not just past purchases. The time-limited pricing and personalized ‘Ecosystem’ framing create a sense of urgency and value, driving increased engagement and sales.
