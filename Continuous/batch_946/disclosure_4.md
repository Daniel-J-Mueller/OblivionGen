## Autonomous Drone-Based Container Health & Predictive Maintenance System

**System Overview:** Expand the real-time location tracking of containers with a drone-based system providing detailed health assessments and predictive maintenance alerts. This moves beyond simple location to incorporate condition-based monitoring.

**Core Components:**

*   **Drone Fleet:** A network of autonomous drones equipped with:
    *   High-resolution RGB cameras
    *   Thermal imaging cameras
    *   Lidar sensors
    *   AI-powered edge computing units
*   **Drone Base Stations:** Strategically positioned within the materials handling facility to provide charging, data offload, and flight planning.
*   **Central Server:** Manages drone fleet operations, data processing, predictive modeling, and integration with the existing shipping schedule system.
*   **Container-Mounted RFID/Bluetooth Beacons:** Small, low-power beacons attached to containers for precise identification and data association.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Automated Flight Planning:** The central server, using the updated shipping schedule and real-time location data, automatically generates flight plans for the drones. Priorities are given to containers nearing dispatch or with known maintenance schedules.
2.  **Container Scanning:** Drones autonomously navigate to designated container locations, scan them using all sensors (RGB, Thermal, Lidar), and capture high-resolution images and data.
3.  **Data Processing & Analysis:** Captured data is processed on the drone's edge computing unit for initial analysis (e.g., object detection, thermal anomaly detection). Processed data and raw data are then transmitted to the central server.
4.  **Condition Assessment:** The central server performs advanced data analysis:
    *   **Visual Inspection:** AI algorithms analyze images for damage (dents, cracks, corrosion), label integrity, and proper securing of contents.
    *   **Thermal Analysis:** Detects overheating components within the container (potentially indicating issues with refrigerated containers or hazardous material leaks).
    *   **Structural Analysis:** Lidar data creates 3D models of containers, identifying structural deformation or instability.
5.  **Predictive Maintenance & Alerting:** Based on the condition assessment:
    *   **Maintenance Scheduling:** The system automatically schedules maintenance for containers nearing failure.
    *   **Alerting:** Sends alerts to relevant personnel (maintenance teams, security) regarding critical issues (e.g., leaks, structural failure).
6.  **Schedule Integration:** The updated container health data and maintenance schedules are integrated into the existing shipping schedule system, allowing for proactive adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Alerting Logic):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateAlert(containerID, issueType, severity) {
  // Severity: Low, Medium, High, Critical

  alertMessage = "Container " + containerID + ": " + issueType + " (Severity: " + severity + ")";

  IF severity == "Critical" THEN
    // Initiate emergency procedures (e.g., isolate container, notify hazmat team)
    InitiateEmergencyProcedures(containerID);
    SendNotification("Emergency: " + alertMessage, "Hazmat Team, Security");
  ELSE IF severity == "High" THEN
    SendNotification(alertMessage, "Maintenance Team, Operations");
  ELSE IF severity == "Medium" THEN
    LogAlert(alertMessage); // Record for review
  ELSE
    LogAlert(alertMessage); // Record for review
  ENDIF
}

//Example Usage:
GenerateAlert("CNTR-12345", "Corrosion detected on structural support", "Medium");
```

**Data Structure (Container Health Record):**

```
ContainerHealthRecord {
  containerID: String;
  lastInspectionTimestamp: DateTime;
  visualInspectionResults: {
    damageDetected: Boolean;
    damageType: String[]; //e.g. "dent", "crack", "corrosion"
    imageURLs: String[];
  };
  thermalInspectionResults: {
    overheatingDetected: Boolean;
    temperatureReadings: Float[];
    thermalImageURLs: String[];
  };
  structuralAnalysisResults: {
    deformationDetected: Boolean;
    deformationMeasurements: Float[];
    3DModelURL: String;
  };
  maintenanceSchedule: {
    nextMaintenanceDate: DateTime;
    maintenanceTasks: String[];
  };
}
```

**Scalability & Redundancy:**

*   Multiple drone base stations to ensure continuous operation.
*   Drone fleet size adjustable based on facility size and throughput.
*   Data redundancy through multiple server locations.
*   Automated drone routing to avoid obstacles and maintain coverage.
