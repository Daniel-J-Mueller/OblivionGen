## Dynamic Proximity-Based Cart Adjustment & Predictive Checkout

**Concept:** Expand the sensor-driven cart system to actively *adjust* cart contents based on a user’s proximity to items *within* the store, combined with a predictive checkout system that anticipates purchase intent and initiates checkout *before* the user reaches the exit.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Network:**  Dense array of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons and/or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) sensors throughout the facility. These are *in addition* to exit/entry sensors.  Sensors are calibrated for precise location tracking (sub-meter accuracy).
*   **Wearable/Mobile Integration:**  User must have a registered account and associated mobile app *or* a provided wearable device (wristband, badge) equipped with BLE/UWB receiver and unique identifier. The app/device communicates with the sensor network and central system.
*   **Item Tagging:** All retail items are tagged with BLE beacons/RFID tags.  These tags transmit item ID and potentially price/description.
*   **Proximity Engine:**  Central processing unit running a proximity engine. This engine receives location data from the user's device and item tags, calculating distance and dwell time.  It uses machine learning to establish "interest thresholds" – how close/long a user must be near an item to be considered interested.
*   **Virtual Cart Adjustment:**  Based on proximity and interest thresholds, the virtual cart is automatically updated.
    *   *Adding Items:* User lingers near an item, it’s added to the cart. Confirmation prompt on the app/device. User can override.
    *   *Removing Items:* User actively moves away from an item *and* indicates disinterest (e.g., gesture on device, verbal command). Alternatively, the system detects an item is *returned* to the shelf.
*   **Predictive Checkout:**
    *   The system monitors user movement towards the exit.
    *   When a user is within a pre-defined “checkout zone” (e.g., 10 meters from the exit) *and* the virtual cart is stable for a set duration (e.g., 5 seconds), the checkout process initiates automatically.
    *   Payment is processed via pre-authorized payment method.
    *   Digital receipt generated and sent to the user’s device.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** System must handle edge cases and conflicts.
    *   Multiple users in close proximity. (User identification and individual tracking critical).
    *   Accidental cart additions (Easy override mechanism).
    *   Item misplacement/scanning errors. (Manual correction options for store associates).
*   **Data Analytics:** System collects data on user behavior (pathing, dwell times, cart adjustments) for store optimization and personalized recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Cart Adjustment):**

```
// User location data received from sensor network
userX, userY = GetUserLocation()

// Get item locations from item tag data
itemLocations = GetItemLocations()

// Iterate through item locations
FOR EACH item IN itemLocations:
    itemX, itemY = item.location
    distance = CalculateDistance(userX, userY, itemX, itemY)
    IF distance < interestThreshold:
        dwellTime = GetDwellTime(item) // How long user near item
        IF dwellTime > dwellThreshold:
            IF item NOT IN user.cart:
                Add item to user.cart
                Send confirmation prompt to user
    ELSE:
       IF user.cart CONTAINS item AND time since last seen > disinterestThreshold:
           Remove item from cart
           Send prompt to user ("Removed item from cart")
```

**Novelty:**  This expands beyond simply *detecting* what a user exits with. It actively manages the cart in real-time based on in-store behavior, creating a truly automated shopping experience. Predictive checkout eliminates queuing and speeds up the process. It moves beyond passive inventory tracking to a dynamic, responsive system.
