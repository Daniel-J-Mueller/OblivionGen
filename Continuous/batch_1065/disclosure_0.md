## Dynamic Category Visualisation & Predictive Bundling

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond static category display (tabs, item viewers) into a dynamically shifting, spatially-aware category map driven by user interaction *and* predictive AI, coupled with automatic bundle creation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Spatial Category Map:**

*   **Display:** Replace fixed category lists with a 2D/3D "cloud" of category representations on screen. Each category is a visual node (shape, colour, icon) in the cloud. Initial arrangement is based on pre-calculated semantic relationships (e.g., “coffee” near “sugar”, “breakfast foods”).
*   **User Interaction – ‘Gravity’ Effect:** User input (mouse movements, gaze tracking) creates a localized ‘gravitational’ pull on the category cloud. Moving the mouse towards a general area pulls relevant categories closer, enlarging their visual representation and highlighting associated items.
*   **Dynamic Relationships:**  Category positions shift *in real-time* based on user interaction. Frequent co-selection of items causes their categories to move closer together, creating personalized category maps.
*   **Zoom/Depth:** Allow user zoom/navigation through the category cloud. Deeper layers reveal sub-categories and related products.
*   **AR/VR Integration:** Extension to AR/VR environments – category cloud manifests as a holographic overlay in the user’s physical space.

**2. Predictive Bundling Engine:**

*   **AI Model:** Train an AI model on historical purchase data, browsing behaviour, and category relationships.
*   **Bundle Prediction:**  As user interacts with the category map (selects items, moves the ‘gravity’ point), the AI predicts potential bundles the user might want.
*   **Bundle Display:** Present predicted bundles as floating “package” icons near the user’s interaction point.  Bundles are visually weighted by probability (larger icon = higher probability).
*   **Bundle Customization:** Allow users to accept, reject, or customize predicted bundles. Customization triggers real-time AI retraining.
*   **Contextual Bundling:**  Integrate external data (time of day, weather, location) to refine bundle predictions.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Client-Side (Compute Device):**
    *   Category cloud rendering engine (WebGL, DirectX).
    *   User interaction handling (mouse, touch, gaze).
    *   Bundle visualization.
*   **Server-Side:**
    *   AI model hosting and retraining.
    *   Data ingestion (purchase history, browsing behaviour).
    *   Bundle recommendation API.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   User profiles.
    *   Purchase history.
    *   Category relationships.
    *   Bundle templates.

**Pseudocode - Bundle Prediction Logic:**

```
function predictBundles(userInteraction, selectedItems, currentCategoryMap):
  // Calculate contextual features (time, weather, location)
  contextualFeatures = calculateContextualFeatures()

  // Retrieve user’s purchase history and browsing behaviour
  userHistory = getUserHistory(user)

  // Get category relationships from current map
  categoryRelationships = getCurrentCategoryRelationships(currentCategoryMap)

  // Input features for AI model
  inputFeatures = [userHistory, categoryRelationships, contextualFeatures, selectedItems]

  // Run AI model to predict bundle probabilities
  bundleProbabilities = aiModel.predict(inputFeatures)

  // Filter and sort bundle probabilities (top N bundles)
  topBundles = filterAndSortBundles(bundleProbabilities, N)

  return topBundles
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Gamification:** Award points/badges for discovering new bundle combinations.
*   **Social Bundling:** Allow users to share/recommend bundles to friends.
*   **Voice Control:** Navigate the category map and create bundles using voice commands.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Provide tactile feedback during category map navigation.
