## Dynamic Policy Inheritance & Contextual Encryption

**Concept:** Extend the forced data transformation policy to enable inheritance *and* contextual application based on real-time data source attributes, creating a tiered encryption/transformation system. This goes beyond simply *where* data is stored (the logical container) and focuses on *how* it arrived.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Source Profiling Module:**

*   **Function:** Analyzes incoming data streams to identify characteristics – originator IP, device type, user role, data sensitivity tags (added *before* reaching our system), geographic location, time of day.
*   **Implementation:**  A lightweight machine learning model constantly updated with incoming data characteristics.  Training data sourced from both internal metadata and external threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Output:**  A “Context Profile” – a JSON object containing key data source attributes and a “Risk Score”.

**2. Policy Inheritance Engine:**

*   **Function:**  Extends the existing policy system.  Policies aren’t simply associated with logical containers; they are tagged with “Applicability Rules” based on Context Profile attributes.  Rules can be hierarchical – a high-level rule might state “All data from untrusted sources requires full encryption,” while a more specific rule might dictate “Data from mobile devices with low battery requires reduced transformation to conserve resources.”
*   **Data Structure:** Policy objects will include:
    *   `container_id`: The logical container this policy applies to.
    *   `transformation_type`: (e.g., "AES-256 encryption", "Data Masking", "Redaction")
    *   `key_id`: Cryptographic key to use.
    *   `applicability_rules`:  An array of conditions. Each condition is a JSON object:
        *   `attribute`: (e.g., "originator_ip", "device_type", "risk_score")
        *   `operator`: (e.g., "equals", "greater_than", "contains")
        *   `value`:  The value to compare against.
*   **Policy Resolution:** The engine evaluates incoming data’s Context Profile against the applicability rules of all policies associated with the target logical container.  The highest-priority (most specific) matching policy is applied.

**3. Dynamic Transformation Pipeline:**

*   **Function:** Adapts the transformation process based on the resolved policy.
*   **Implementation:** A modular pipeline where each transformation step (encryption, masking, etc.) is implemented as a separate microservice.  The pipeline orchestrator (a separate service) dynamically assembles the pipeline based on the policy's `transformation_type`.
*   **Resource Optimization:** Policies can specify resource constraints (e.g., “maximum CPU usage,” “maximum latency”) to prevent overload.

**4. Auditing & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Function:** Tracks policy application, transformation performance, and potential security incidents.
*   **Implementation:**  All policy resolutions and transformation events are logged with detailed metadata. Machine learning models analyze these logs to identify patterns and improve policy accuracy. 
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system automatically adjusts policies based on observed data and potential threats.



**Pseudocode (Policy Resolution):**

```
function resolvePolicy(data, containerId):
  policies = getPoliciesForContainer(containerId)
  matchingPolicies = []

  for policy in policies:
    isApplicable = true
    for rule in policy.applicability_rules:
      if not evaluateRule(data, rule):
        isApplicable = false
        break

    if isApplicable:
      matchingPolicies.append(policy)

  if matchingPolicies.isEmpty():
    return null // No applicable policy

  // Sort policies by specificity (more specific rules first)
  sortedPolicies = sortPoliciesBySpecificity(matchingPolicies)

  return sortedPolicies[0] // Return the most specific applicable policy
```
