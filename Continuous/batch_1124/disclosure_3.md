## Adaptive Anomaly Contextualization via Generative Time-Series Augmentation

**Concept:** The core idea is to proactively generate synthetic time-series data *around* detected anomalies to better contextualize their significance and improve the accuracy of magnitude assignment. This addresses the limitation of solely reacting to anomalies and instead introduces a predictive component to enhance understanding.

**Specifications:**

**1. Synthetic Data Generation Module:**

   *   **Input:** Detected anomaly (timestamp, metric, initial magnitude), historical time-series data for the corresponding metric, configuration parameters (augmentation factor, prediction horizon).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) specifically trained on the historical time-series data. The GAN's generator component will be used to create synthetic data. A Time Series GAN (TSGAN) architecture is preferred due to its ability to capture temporal dependencies.
        *   Generate multiple synthetic time-series instances, each extending a defined prediction horizon *forward* from the anomaly's timestamp. Vary the initial conditions for each generation.  Specifically, inject small, randomized perturbations *around* the anomaly point within the synthetic series.
        *   Introduce 'what-if' scenarios. Generate synthetic series conditioned on *different* external event profiles. For example, if the anomaly correlated with a specific network event, generate series assuming a slightly different network load profile.
   *   **Output:** A collection of synthetic time-series instances, each representing a possible future trajectory following the anomaly.

**2. Contextual Analysis Engine:**

   *   **Input:** Detected anomaly, original time-series, collection of synthetic time-series.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Trajectory Divergence Calculation:** For each synthetic series, calculate a divergence metric (e.g., Dynamic Time Warping distance, Kullback-Leibler divergence) between the synthetic trajectory *after* the anomaly and the actual observed time-series.  Higher divergence indicates a more significant impact from the anomaly.
        *   **Magnitude Refinement:**  Adjust the initial anomaly magnitude based on the average divergence across all synthetic series. A higher average divergence results in a larger magnitude. Introduce a weighting factor based on how closely the simulated external events mirror actual events.
        *   **Anomaly Clustering and Grouping:** Leverage the synthetic data to assess potential relationships between co-occurring anomalies. If multiple anomalies consistently lead to similar trajectories in the synthetic data, group them together.

**3.  Reporting Module Enhancement:**

   *   Visualizations: Extend the reporting to include the top N most divergent synthetic time-series alongside the actual observed data. This allows analysts to quickly grasp the potential range of impacts and assess the severity of the anomaly.
   *   Probabilistic Forecasting: Report not just the anomaly magnitude, but also a probabilistic range of potential future values based on the ensemble of synthetic time-series.

**Pseudocode (Magnitude Refinement):**

```
function refineMagnitude(anomaly, syntheticSeriesList, eventCorrelationWeight):
  totalDivergence = 0
  for series in syntheticSeriesList:
    divergence = calculateDivergence(series, anomaly.timestamp)
    totalDivergence += divergence

  averageDivergence = totalDivergence / length(syntheticSeriesList)

  refinedMagnitude = anomaly.magnitude * (1 + (averageDivergence * eventCorrelationWeight))
  return refinedMagnitude
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `augmentationFactor`: Number of synthetic series to generate per anomaly.
*   `predictionHorizon`: Length of the synthetic time-series (in time units).
*   `eventCorrelationWeight`:  Scales the impact of event correlation on magnitude refinement.
*   `divergenceMetric`:  Selection of divergence metric (DTW, KL, etc.).
*   `GAN Training Data`: Historical time-series data used to train the GAN.
*   `Perturbation Range`: Specifies the maximum magnitude of the randomized perturbations injected around the anomaly within the synthetic series.
