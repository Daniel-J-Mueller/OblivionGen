## Dynamic Focal Point Adjustment via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback (specifically, pupil dilation and electrodermal activity) into the bounding box generation process to dynamically adjust the focal point within the image.  Instead of a static region-of-interest focus determined solely by aggregate confidence, the system prioritizes areas where a user exhibits visual or emotional engagement.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**  Pupil dilation sensor (integrated into display or wearable), Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor (wearable â€“ wristband or fingertip).
*   **Data Acquisition:** Real-time streaming of pupil dilation and EDA data.  Sampling rate: 30-60 Hz.
*   **Preprocessing:** Noise filtering and baseline correction for both sensor streams.  Normalization of data to a 0-1 range.
*   **Engagement Metric:**  Combined engagement score calculated as:
    *   `Engagement = (PupilDilationWeight * NormalizedPupilDilation) + (EDAWeight * NormalizedEDA)`
        *   `PupilDilationWeight` and `EDAWeight` are tunable parameters (default: 0.5 each).  These weights could be learned per user or adjusted dynamically based on context.
*   **Confidence Map Modification:**  The aggregate confidence map (as generated by the existing patent) is multiplied element-wise by the engagement map (a spatial representation of the engagement metric).  The engagement map is constructed by smoothing the engagement metric across the image, weighted by the confidence map itself. This ensures focus on areas *both* confidently identified as containing a person *and* capturing user attention.
*   **Bounding Box Generation:** The bounding box algorithm (region growth, mean shift, etc.) operates on the modified confidence map.  This results in a bounding box that prioritizes areas of high confidence *and* high user engagement.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The entire process (data acquisition, confidence map modification, bounding box generation) is repeated at a rate of 10-30 Hz, allowing the bounding box to dynamically adjust in response to user attention shifts.
*   **Calibration:** Initial calibration step to establish a baseline for pupil dilation and EDA for each user. This accounts for individual differences in physiological responses.
*   **Visualization:** Optional overlay on the display showing the modified confidence map and the dynamically adjusted bounding box.



**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
sensor = initialize_sensors()
calibration_data = calibrate_user(sensor)

while(true):
  // Data Acquisition
  pupil_dilation = read_sensor(sensor, "pupil_dilation")
  eda = read_sensor(sensor, "eda")

  //Preprocessing
  pupil_dilation = filter_noise(pupil_dilation)
  eda = filter_noise(eda)
  pupil_dilation = normalize(pupil_dilation, calibration_data)
  eda = normalize(eda, calibration_data)

  //Engagement Metric
  engagement = (0.5 * pupil_dilation) + (0.5 * eda)

  //Confidence Map Modification
  confidence_map = generate_confidence_map() // Existing Patent Logic
  engagement_map = create_spatial_map(engagement, confidence_map)
  modified_confidence_map = multiply(confidence_map, engagement_map)

  //Bounding Box Generation
  bounding_box = generate_bounding_box(modified_confidence_map) // Existing Patent Logic

  //Display
  display_image_with_bounding_box(image, bounding_box)
