## Adaptive Sketch Resolution for Streaming Data

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the resolution (size/complexity) of sketch data structures *per cluster* based on observed data density and query patterns. This allows for efficient representation of both sparse and dense regions within the dataset, optimizing storage and query performance in streaming scenarios.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Cluster-Specific Sketch Configuration:**  Maintain a configuration table mapping each cluster (leaf node in the hierarchical representation) to a sketch resolution parameter (SRP). SRP dictates the memory allocated to the sketch – higher SRP, more accurate representation, higher memory cost. Initial SRP is a global default.

2.  **Density Monitoring:**  For each cluster, continuously monitor the rate of new data points being assigned to it. Calculate a ‘density score’ based on a moving average of incoming data point rates. 

3.  **Query Pattern Analysis:** Track the frequency with which queries are directed toward a specific cluster. Higher query frequency implies a need for more accurate data representation (lower error rates in approximate queries).

4.  **Adaptive Adjustment Logic:** Implement a control loop. 
    *   **If** (density score > high threshold) **OR** (query frequency > high threshold): Increase SRP for the cluster.
    *   **If** (density score < low threshold) **AND** (query frequency < low threshold): Decrease SRP for the cluster.
    *   Implement hysteresis to prevent oscillating adjustments.  A significant change in density/query rate is required to trigger a change in SRP.

5.  **Sketch Migration:**  When SRP changes, seamlessly migrate the sketch data to a new, appropriately sized data structure.  This can involve re-hashing or other appropriate data transfer mechanisms. Minimize downtime during migration.  Consider background migration for less critical clusters.

6.  **Hierarchical Propagation:**  Non-leaf nodes in the hierarchy should maintain aggregated SRP values from their child nodes. This allows for estimated resource allocation and optimization at higher levels.  A node’s SRP can be set as the maximum SRP of its children, providing a conservative estimate.

7. **Sketch Type Negotiation:** Allow each cluster to select from a predefined set of sketch types (Count-Min, AMS, etc.).  The sketch type is chosen based on the expected data distribution within the cluster. This selection is performed during initial cluster creation and can be revisited if data characteristics change significantly.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
FOR each cluster in cluster_list:
    density_score = calculate_moving_average(data_points_assigned_to_cluster)
    query_frequency = calculate_moving_average(queries_directed_to_cluster)

    current_SRP = cluster.SRP

    IF (density_score > HIGH_DENSITY_THRESHOLD OR query_frequency > HIGH_QUERY_THRESHOLD):
        new_SRP = min(MAX_SRP, current_SRP * SRP_INCREASE_FACTOR)
        IF (new_SRP != current_SRP):
            migrate_sketch(cluster, new_SRP)
            cluster.SRP = new_SRP

    ELSE IF (density_score < LOW_DENSITY_THRESHOLD AND query_frequency < LOW_QUERY_THRESHOLD):
        new_SRP = max(MIN_SRP, current_SRP * SRP_DECREASE_FACTOR)
        IF (new_SRP != current_SRP):
            migrate_sketch(cluster, new_SRP)
            cluster.SRP = new_SRP

END FOR
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Cluster`:  Contains:  `cluster_ID`, `sketch_data`, `SRP`, `density_score`, `query_frequency`.
*   `ConfigurationTable`:  Mapping `cluster_ID` to `SRP`.

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   Concurrency:  Ensure thread-safe access to cluster data and sketch structures.
*   Monitoring:  Implement metrics to track sketch resolution, resource usage, and query performance.
*   Scalability: Design the system to handle a large number of clusters and high data rates.
