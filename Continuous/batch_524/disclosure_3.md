## Adaptive Pipeline Stage Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the ability to configure pipeline stages beyond single parameter adjustments. Instead of *what* a stage does, control *how much* of a stage is applied. This allows for dynamic adjustment of processing intensity based on data characteristics and performance goals.

**Specification:**

**1. Stage Granularity Levels:**

*   **Coarse:** Full stage execution. (Current functionality).
*   **Medium:** Reduced dataset sampling for stage processing.  (e.g., process 20% of the data at this stage).
*   **Fine:**  Apply a simplified version of the stage’s algorithm, reducing computational complexity. (e.g. switch from a complex similarity metric to a simpler one.)
*   **Off:** Bypass the stage entirely.

**2. Granularity Control Interface:**

*   Add a “Granularity” parameter to each configurable pipeline stage.
*   Granularity accepts values: `Coarse`, `Medium`, `Fine`, `Off`.
*   Default value: `Coarse`.
*   Granularity settings are applied *during* pipeline training.

**3. Dynamic Granularity Adjustment Module:**

*   A new module within the ETL system monitors pipeline performance (latency, resource usage).
*   This module receives performance metrics from each stage.
*   It includes a rule engine to adjust Granularity settings *automatically*.
*   Rules are based on:
    *   Data characteristics (e.g., data volume, data complexity).
    *   Performance targets (e.g., maximum latency, resource budget).
    *   User-defined priorities (e.g., prioritize accuracy vs. speed).

**4.  Training Data Sampling for Granularity:**

*   During pipeline training, the system should *experiment* with different Granularity settings.
*   Use A/B testing or similar techniques to evaluate the impact of each setting on model accuracy and performance.
*   Store the results of these experiments to optimize Granularity settings for future runs.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Granularity Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustGranularity(stage, performanceMetrics, dataCharacteristics)

  IF dataCharacteristics.volume > thresholdHigh AND performanceMetrics.latency > thresholdHigh THEN
    stage.granularity = Medium
  ELSE IF performanceMetrics.resourceUsage > thresholdHigh THEN
    stage.granularity = Fine
  ELSE IF dataCharacteristics.complexity == High AND performanceMetrics.accuracy < targetAccuracy THEN
    stage.granularity = Coarse
  ELSE
    stage.granularity = Coarse //default
  ENDIF

  RETURN stage
END FUNCTION
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Each stage must be designed to support different Granularity levels. This may require implementing alternative algorithms or data processing techniques.
*   The Dynamic Granularity Adjustment Module should be configurable and extensible. Allow users to define custom rules and performance targets.
*   Monitoring and logging are crucial for tracking the impact of Granularity adjustments. 
*   Experimentation and A/B testing are essential for optimizing Granularity settings.
