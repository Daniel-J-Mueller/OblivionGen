## Adaptive Synchronization Granularity

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a system where synchronization granularity isn't fixed at the folder/file level, but *adapts* based on detected change patterns and network conditions. Instead of syncing entire files or folders when even a small change occurs, the system breaks down content into smaller "blocks" (similar to deduplication chunks, but dynamically sized) and syncs *only* those blocks that have changed.

**II. Block Definition & Hashing:**

*   **Dynamic Sizing:** Block size isn't fixed. The system analyzes file types and content. Text files might use smaller blocks (e.g., paragraph-sized), while binary files use larger blocks. Initial block size will be 64KB, but will be subject to adjustment.
*   **Content-Defined Chunking:** Blocks are created based on content similarity, not just byte offsets.  This leverages rolling hash algorithms (e.g., Rabin-Karp) to identify repeating patterns and create blocks that maximize deduplication potential *and* minimize the impact of minor changes.
*   **Multi-Level Hashing:** Each block receives multiple hash values:
    *   **Primary Hash:** A strong cryptographic hash (SHA-256) for integrity.
    *   **Similarity Hash:** A perceptual hash (pHash) to identify content similarity, even if the primary hash differs slightly. This is vital for media files (images, audio, video).
    *   **Delta Hash:**  A hash representing the *difference* between the current block and its previous version.  This enables efficient delta compression and transmission.

**III. Synchronization Protocol:**

1.  **Initial Scan & Baseline:** Perform a full scan of the shared folders to create a baseline of block hashes. This is a one-time operation or triggered after a significant change (e.g., file format conversion).
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor file system events for changes.
3.  **Block Identification:** When a change is detected, identify the affected blocks.
4.  **Hash Comparison:** Compare the hashes of the affected blocks with their corresponding remote counterparts.
5.  **Selective Synchronization:**
    *   If the primary hash matches, the block is identical, and no synchronization is needed.
    *   If the primary hash differs, but the similarity hash is close, attempt delta compression and transmission.
    *   If the primary hash differs significantly, transmit the entire block.
6.  **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a versioning system to handle conflicting changes.

**IV. Adaptive Granularity Control:**

*   **Change Rate Monitoring:** Track the rate of change for each file/folder.
*   **Network Condition Assessment:** Monitor network bandwidth, latency, and packet loss.
*   **Dynamic Block Size Adjustment:** Adjust block size based on change rate and network conditions.  Higher change rates and lower bandwidth = smaller block sizes.
*   **Synchronization Prioritization:** Prioritize synchronization of frequently changed files and folders.

**V. Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
function synchronize_files(local_folder, remote_folder):
  for each file in local_folder:
    if file has changed:
      blocks = create_blocks(file)
      for each block in blocks:
        if block has changed(block, remote_block):
          if network_bandwidth > threshold:
            transmit_block(block)
          else:
            compress_block(block)
            transmit_block(block)
```

**VI.  Technical Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** The system must be scalable to handle large numbers of files and folders.
*   **Security:** Implement encryption and authentication to protect data.
*   **Resource Usage:** Optimize resource usage (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to ensure data integrity.

This approach moves beyond simple file/folder syncing, enabling a more efficient and responsive synchronization experience, particularly in environments with limited bandwidth or high change rates. It's analogous to a video codec, adapting to the content being transmitted to minimize data transfer.
