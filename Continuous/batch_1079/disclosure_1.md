## Adaptive Predictive Illumination System

**Concept:** Extend the predictive focus system to dynamically adjust illumination *in conjunction* with focal length prediction. The current patent focuses on optimizing *focus*, but image clarity is equally dependent on *light*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Illumination Array:** A matrix of individually addressable micro-LEDs or similar high-efficiency light sources integrated into the imaging device housing. Resolution: Minimum 16x16, ideally 32x32 or greater.
*   **Ambient Light Sensor:** High dynamic range sensor to measure overall scene luminance and color temperature.
*   **IR Dot Projector:** Project a sparse pattern of infrared dots onto the scene.  Used for depth mapping independent of texture.
*   **IR Camera:** Captures the reflected IR dot pattern for depth map generation.  Matched to IR projector wavelength.
*   **Computational Unit:** Dedicated processor (DSP, FPGA, or integrated GPU) for real-time image processing and control.

**2. Software/Algorithm:**

*   **Scene Analysis:**
    *   Real-time analysis of incoming frames to identify regions of interest (ROIs) using semantic object recognition (as in the source patent).
    *   Depth map generation from IR dot pattern.
    *   Luminance and color temperature mapping of the scene.
*   **Predictive Illumination Model:**
    *   Algorithm learns the relationship between semantic objects, depth, and optimal illumination levels. Training data gathered from a large dataset of images and corresponding 'ground truth' illumination maps (created manually or through advanced rendering).
    *   Predicts the optimal illumination map for each frame *before* capture.
    *   Illumination map defines the intensity and color of each micro-LED in the array.
*   **Dynamic Illumination Control:**
    *   Micro-LED array adjusts dynamically based on the predicted illumination map.
    *   Intensity levels range from off to maximum brightness.
    *   Color temperature adjustment to match or enhance scene colors.
*   **Focal Length/Illumination Synchronization:**
    *   Algorithm simultaneously predicts the optimal focal length and illumination map for each frame.
    *   Illumination adjustments *precede* image capture to optimize conditions for the selected focal length.
*   **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Analyze captured images for blur, noise, and color accuracy.
    *   Refine the predictive model based on feedback to improve future illumination and focus predictions.

**4.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Selective Illumination:**  Illuminating *only* ROIs to reduce power consumption and minimize glare.
*   **Dynamic Range Enhancement:**  Adjusting illumination to maximize dynamic range in high-contrast scenes.
