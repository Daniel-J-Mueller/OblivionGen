## Adaptive Fragment Prediction & Prefetching

**Core Concept:** Predict future fragment requests based on observed playback patterns *and* network conditions, proactively prefetching fragments to reduce buffering and improve perceived quality, going beyond simple buffering thresholds.  This is a dynamic system which adapts to user viewing habits *and* fluctuating network performance.

**Specs:**

*   **Playback Pattern Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Stream of fragment request timestamps, fragment IDs, playback start/end times.
    *   Process:  Employ a Markov Model (order 2 or 3) to learn transition probabilities between fragments. Higher orders capture longer-range dependencies. Additionally, track viewing ‘sessions’ – sequences of fragments played without interruption.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over next likely fragments. Session information used as a weighting factor – fragments frequently played within a session get higher probability.

*   **Network Condition Monitor:**
    *   Input: Real-time network bandwidth, latency, packet loss.
    *   Process: Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) to smooth network data. Calculate a "Network Health Score" – a composite metric reflecting overall network quality.
    *   Output: Network Health Score (0-100).

*   **Prefetch Engine:**
    *   Input: Probability distribution from Playback Pattern Analyzer, Network Health Score.
    *   Process:
        1.  Calculate a “Prefetch Score” for each potential next fragment: `Prefetch Score = (Probability * Network Health Score)`.  Higher scores indicate fragments more likely to be needed *and* deliverable without buffering.
        2.  Maintain a “Prefetch Queue” – a list of fragments sorted by Prefetch Score.
        3.  Dynamically adjust the queue size based on Network Health Score.  Low score -> smaller queue. High score -> larger queue.
        4.  Initiate prefetching of fragments from the queue. Prioritize those with the highest score.
        5.  Implement a “Cost Function” to prevent excessive prefetching.  Factors include bandwidth usage, storage limitations, and prefetch latency.  Adjust queue size accordingly.

*   **Adaptive Bitrate Integration:**
    *   Integrate prefetching with existing Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms. If network conditions are favorable (high Network Health Score), prioritize prefetching higher-quality fragments.
    *   If network conditions deteriorate, dynamically switch to lower-quality fragments *and* reduce prefetch queue size.

*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed every N milliseconds)
function mainLoop() {
  patternAnalyzer.update(currentFragmentId); // Update playback pattern data
  networkMonitor.update();  // Update network condition data

  prefetchScore = patternAnalyzer.getProbability(nextFragmentId) * networkMonitor.getHealthScore();

  if (prefetchScore > threshold) {
    prefetchEngine.prefetch(nextFragmentId);
  }
}

// Prefetch Engine function
function prefetch(fragmentId) {
  //Check if fragment is already in buffer. If so, do nothing.
  if (fragment is not in buffer){
     requestFragment(fragmentId);
  }
}
```

*   **Hardware Considerations:** Requires sufficient memory to store prefetched fragments. A dedicated hardware accelerator could offload some of the processing (Markov Model calculations, network analysis).

*   **Potential Extensions:**  Implement a collaborative filtering approach – learn from the playback patterns of other users with similar viewing habits.
