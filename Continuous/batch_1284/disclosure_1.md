## Adaptive Threat Response via Predictive Graph Analysis

**Specification:** A system for proactive threat mitigation leveraging predictive graph analysis and automated response orchestration. This builds upon the concept of runtime graph generation but moves *beyond* reactive analysis to forecast potential compromises.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Predictive Graph Engine:** This module extends the runtime graph generation. It doesn't simply reflect the current state, but incorporates historical data, threat intelligence feeds, and machine learning models to *predict* future graph states. This prediction is based on observed behaviors, known vulnerabilities, and evolving threat landscapes.

    *   **Data Sources:**
        *   Runtime measurements (as per the base patent).
        *   Historical graph snapshots (time-series data).
        *   Threat intelligence feeds (STIX/TAXII compatible).
        *   Vulnerability databases (NVD, etc.).
        *   User/entity behavior analytics (UEBA) data.
    *   **Prediction Models:**
        *   Time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet).
        *   Graph neural networks (GNNs) for predicting edge/node creation/deletion.
        *   Reinforcement learning (RL) for modeling attacker behavior and predicting attack paths.
2.  **Risk Scoring Module:** Assigns a risk score to each node and edge in the predicted graph based on several factors:

    *   **Node criticality:** Based on the function/data the node represents.
    *   **Edge vulnerability:** Based on the type of connection and known exploits.
    *   **Predicted attack path probability:** Based on the RL model's prediction.
    *   **Deviation from baseline behavior:** Significant changes in node/edge characteristics.
3.  **Automated Response Orchestrator:**  Executes pre-defined or dynamically generated response actions based on the risk scores and predicted threats.

    *   **Response Actions:**
        *   **Micro-segmentation:**  Dynamically adjust network policies to isolate potentially compromised nodes.
        *   **Resource throttling:**  Limit the resources available to suspicious processes.
        *   **Process termination:**  Kill malicious processes.
        *   **Credential rotation:**  Automatically rotate compromised credentials.
        *   **Deception technology:** Deploy decoy resources to attract and trap attackers.

**Pseudocode - Predictive Graph Engine (simplified):**

```
function generate_predictive_graph(runtime_graph, historical_data, threat_feeds):
  // 1. Enrich runtime graph with threat intelligence
  enriched_graph = enrich_graph_with_threat_data(runtime_graph, threat_feeds)

  // 2. Predict future graph state based on historical data and enriched graph
  predicted_graph = predict_graph_state(enriched_graph, historical_data)

  // 3. Calculate risk scores for each node and edge in predicted graph
  risk_scores = calculate_risk_scores(predicted_graph)

  return predicted_graph, risk_scores
```

**System Architecture:**

The system integrates with existing security infrastructure (SIEM, EDR, firewalls) and operates as a layered defense. Agents collect runtime measurements, which are fed into the Predictive Graph Engine. The Engine generates predicted graphs and risk scores, which are then used by the Automated Response Orchestrator to execute appropriate security actions.

**Novelty:**

This approach shifts from reactive threat detection to *proactive* threat mitigation. By predicting future graph states and assessing potential risks before they materialize, the system can preemptively block attacks and minimize damage. The integration of machine learning models and threat intelligence feeds allows the system to adapt to evolving threats and improve its prediction accuracy.
