## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Circuit Board Diagnostics

**Concept:** Expand the idea of configurable connection points beyond simply accessing functions. Utilize these points to create a localized haptic feedback system *on* the custom circuit board itself, indicating signal flow, fault locations, or active functions directly through touch.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Grid:** Integrate a dense grid of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, shape memory alloy, or micro-electromagnetic) *beneath* a transparent or thin insulating layer on the configurable circuit board. The grid resolution should be high enough to create localized sensations.
*   **Signal Mapping:** The configurable connection points will not only route signals *to* and *from* the custom board, but also feed data to a dedicated microcontroller managing the haptic grid. This microcontroller will map signal activity (voltage, current, data flow) to specific locations on the grid.
*   **Dynamic Mapping Profiles:** Allow user-defined or automatically generated “mapping profiles.” These profiles dictate *how* signal activity is represented haptically. Examples:
    *   **Signal Flow:** A 'wave' of haptic sensation propagates along the path of a signal.
    *   **Fault Localization:** A sharp, localized vibration indicates a short circuit or open connection.
    *   **Function Activation:** A pulsing sensation indicates an active function.
    *   **Heat Mapping:** Visualizing thermal activity via intensity of haptic feedback.
*   **Touch Sensitivity Layer:** Integrate a capacitive or resistive touch sensor layer *above* the haptic grid. This allows the system to detect user touch and tailor the haptic feedback accordingly.  The user could "trace" a signal path, or isolate a specific component.
*   **Software Interface:**  Develop a software interface to:
    *   Configure mapping profiles.
    *   Adjust haptic intensity and frequency.
    *   Visualize signal flow and fault locations.
    *   Calibrate the touch sensitivity layer.
*   **Power Requirements:** Low-power operation, utilizing efficient microcontroller and actuator technology. Power sourced from the generic interface of the configurable board.
*   **Form Factor:** Maintain a low-profile design, minimizing interference with existing circuit board components.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Control Loop):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {

    // Read Signal Data from Configurable Connection Points
    signalData = readSignalData();

    // Apply Mapping Profile
    hapticPattern = applyMappingProfile(signalData, currentProfile);

    // Detect User Touch (if applicable)
    touchLocation = detectTouch();
    if (touchLocation != null) {
        hapticPattern = refineHapticPattern(hapticPattern, touchLocation);
    }

    // Drive Haptic Actuator Grid
    driveHapticGrid(hapticPattern);

    // Delay for update rate
    delay(updateRate);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Circuit board troubleshooting and repair.
*   Educational tool for learning electronics.
*   Real-time visualization of system behavior.
*   Accessibility tool for visually impaired users.
