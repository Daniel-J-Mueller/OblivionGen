# 10496692

## Resource Group Temporal Forecasting & Automated Remediation

**Specification:** A system integrating resource group definitions (as established in patent 10496692) with time-series forecasting to predict resource needs *within* a defined group and automate preemptive scaling or remediation actions.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Historical Data Collection:** Extend the existing system to passively monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) for resources *within* each defined resource group. KPIs include CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network bandwidth, latency, error rates, and cost data. This data is time-stamped and stored in a time-series database.

2.  **Forecasting Engine:** Implement a forecasting engine leveraging machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future resource demand *for each KPI within each resource group*.  The engine will:
    *   Automatically select the optimal forecasting model based on historical data characteristics (seasonality, trend, noise).
    *   Generate probabilistic forecasts (e.g., 95% confidence intervals) to quantify uncertainty.
    *   Allow for manual override and model tuning.

3.  **Threshold Definition & Alerting:**  Enable users to define dynamic thresholds for KPIs *based on forecast confidence intervals*.  For example, a threshold might be defined as “90% confidence that CPU utilization will exceed 80% within the next hour.”  Alerts are generated when forecasts predict threshold breaches.

4.  **Automated Remediation Actions:**  Link alerts to automated remediation actions, configurable per resource group. Examples:
    *   **Auto-Scaling:** Automatically scale up (or down) the number of instances within a resource group based on predicted demand.
    *   **Resource Rebalancing:** Migrate workloads from one resource to another within the group to optimize utilization.
    *   **Preemptive Patching/Maintenance:** Schedule maintenance during periods of predicted low demand.
    *   **Cost Optimization:**  Temporarily reduce resource allocation during predicted low utilization.
    *   **Automated Failover:** Trigger failover to redundant resources based on predicted error rates.

5. **Group Dependency Mapping:** Implement a method for users to define dependencies *between* resource groups. This enables cascading remediation actions. For instance: if “Database Group” is predicted to be overloaded, automatically scale up the “Web Server Group” to accommodate increased load.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Remediation Logic):**

```
FUNCTION HandleForecast(resource_group, kpi, forecast, confidence_interval):
  IF forecast > threshold AND confidence > confidence_threshold:
    action = GetRemediationAction(resource_group, kpi)
    IF action == "Auto-Scale":
      ScaleUp(resource_group)
    ELSE IF action == "Resource-Rebalance":
      RebalanceResources(resource_group)
    // ... other actions ...
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

// Main Loop:
FOREACH resource_group IN all_resource_groups:
  FOREACH kpi IN monitored_kpis:
    forecast = ForecastingEngine.Predict(resource_group, kpi)
    HandleForecast(resource_group, kpi, forecast, confidence_interval)
  ENDFOREACH
ENDFOREACH
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ResourceGroupDefinition`: (Existing from Patent) + `monitored_kpis` (list of KPIs), `remediation_actions` (dictionary mapping KPIs to actions).
*   `ForecastData`: `timestamp`, `resource_group`, `kpi`, `forecast_value`, `confidence_interval`.
