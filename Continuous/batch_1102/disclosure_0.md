## Aerial Vehicle Swarm Coordinated Payload Manipulation

**System Specs:**

*   **Vehicle Type:** Small, modular aerial vehicle (approx. 250-500g mass) utilizing ducted fan propulsion for stability and maneuverability.
*   **Payload Engagement:** Each vehicle equipped with a miniature, high-friction, electromagnetically actuated gripper. Gripper force adjustable via onboard microcontroller.
*   **Swarm Size:** Configurable, ranging from 3 to 12 vehicles.
*   **Communication:** Dedicated short-range, high-bandwidth mesh network utilizing UWB (Ultra-Wideband) radio.
*   **Sensing:** Each vehicle equipped with:
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 9-axis.
    *   Downward-facing LiDAR – for precise altitude and terrain mapping.
    *   Proximity sensors (IR or ultrasonic) – for collision avoidance and object detection.
*   **Central Control:** A ground-based computing system running a real-time operating system.

**Innovation Description:**

This system enables the coordinated manipulation of payloads by a swarm of aerial vehicles. Instead of a single drone carrying an object, multiple drones *collaboratively* lift and move the payload, allowing for increased lift capacity, enhanced stability, and the ability to manipulate objects with complex geometries.

The core concept involves a distributed control algorithm that dynamically adjusts the lift contribution of each drone based on:

1.  **Payload Center of Gravity Estimation:** Real-time estimation of the payload’s center of gravity using sensor data (IMUs, proximity sensors) from each drone engaged with the payload.
2.  **Distributed Force Control:** Each drone independently adjusts its thrust to maintain a desired portion of the total payload weight.
3.  **Swarm Formation Control:** The drones maintain a predefined formation around the payload, dynamically adjusting their positions to compensate for payload imbalances or external disturbances (wind gusts).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Each drone executes this code:

loop:
    // Read sensor data: IMU, proximity sensors, UWB location
    sensorData = readSensors()

    // Communicate with neighboring drones: share sensor data, estimated payload CG
    communicate(sensorData)

    // Aggregate data from swarm: calculate overall payload CG, total weight
    swarmData = aggregateSwarmData()

    // Calculate desired thrust contribution based on:
    //  - Swarm weight distribution
    //  - Vehicle position relative to payload CG
    desiredThrust = calculateDesiredThrust(swarmData)

    // Implement PID controller to adjust thrust and maintain desired position
    thrust = PIDController(desiredThrust, currentThrust)

    // Apply thrust to motors
    applyThrust(thrust)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Construction:** Collaborative lifting and positioning of construction materials.
*   **Logistics:** Transporting oversized or awkwardly shaped objects.
*   **Disaster Relief:** Carrying supplies to remote or inaccessible areas.
*   **Entertainment:** Creating dynamic aerial displays and manipulating large-scale props.
