## Dynamic Constraint Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the system to not only *satisfy* decision constraints but to *actively evolve* them based on observed outcomes and predicted information gain. The initial constraints represent the 'knowns', but the system should learn when and how to *relax* or *tighten* those constraints to explore more optimal solution spaces.

**Specs:**

1.  **Constraint Bank:**  Maintain a ‘Constraint Bank’ alongside the machine learning model. This bank holds multiple versions of each constraint – a ‘default’ constraint, a ‘relaxed’ version (allowing more flexibility), and a ‘tightened’ version (increasing stringency). Each version has an associated ‘exploration cost’ reflecting the potential risk/reward of deviating from the default.

2.  **Constraint Evaluation Module:**  Add a module that evaluates the current decision outcome *not just* against the active constraint, but *also* against the alternative constraint versions in the Constraint Bank. This evaluation uses a scoring system based on:
    *   **Outcome Improvement:**  How much better would the outcome have been if the alternative constraint had been used?
    *   **Information Gain Delta:**  How much more information would have been gained by exploring options under the alternative constraint?
    *   **Exploration Cost:** The associated cost of utilizing an alternate constraint.

3.  **Constraint Morphing Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the active constraint based on the evaluation:
    *   **If Outcome Improvement & Information Gain Delta exceed Exploration Cost:**  Transition to the alternative constraint.
    *   **If Outcome Improvement is minimal but Information Gain Delta is high:**  Temporarily explore options under the alternative constraint for a limited number of iterations.
    *   **If Outcome is significantly worse than predicted:** Tighten the constraint.

4.  **Constraint Generation Module**: A method to *automatically* create new constraints based on observed data. This could involve anomaly detection on outcomes or identifying 'edge cases' where existing constraints perform poorly. The system could then propose a new constraint tailored to those specific cases.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
ConstraintBank = { Constraint1: [Default, Relaxed, Tightened], Constraint2: [...] }
ActiveConstraints = [Default versions of each constraint]

//Decision Loop
For Each Decision:
    EvaluateOptions(ActiveConstraints)
    SelectBestOption()
    ImplementDecision()
    QuantifyResult()

    For Each Constraint in ActiveConstraints:
        Evaluate Constraint Against Result
        Calculate: OutcomeImprovement, InformationGainDelta, ExplorationCost
        If (OutcomeImprovement + InformationGainDelta > ExplorationCost):
            Switch to Alternate Constraint Version
        If (Result Significantly Worse Than Predicted):
            Tighten Constraint

        //Automatic Constraint Generation (Occasional)
        If (Anomaly Detected):
            Propose New Constraint Based on Anomaly
            Add to Constraint Bank
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Personalized Medicine:** Dynamically adjust treatment constraints based on patient response and predicted outcomes.
*   **Financial Trading:** Evolve risk constraints based on market volatility and predicted gains.
*   **Robotics:** Adapt movement constraints based on environmental changes and sensor data.
