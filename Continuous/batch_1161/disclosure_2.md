## Adaptive Trust Networks for Inter-Application Communication

**Concept:** Extend the application authorization framework to incorporate a dynamic, reputation-based trust network. Instead of solely relying on code signing certificates and whitelists, applications can assess the trustworthiness of other applications based on collective usage data and reported behavior.

**Specification:**

**1. Trust Score Calculation:**

*   Each application is assigned a "Trust Score," initialized at a neutral value (e.g., 50/100).
*   The Trust Score is dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   **Usage Frequency:** Higher usage by reputable applications increases the score.
    *   **Data Handling Reports:** Applications can report on the behavior of applications they interact with (e.g., “Application X requested excessive permissions,” “Application Y attempted unauthorized network access”). Reports contribute to score reduction.
    *   **User Feedback:**  Integrate user-reported issues and ratings.
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Identify patterns of suspicious behavior across multiple applications. If App A consistently leads to negative reports on App B, the correlation is factored into the Trust Score.
*   Trust Score decay: Scores gradually decrease over time if not reinforced by positive interactions.

**2. Application Interaction Protocol:**

*   When Application A initiates communication with Application B, Application A requests Application B’s current Trust Score from a central “Trust Authority” service (see section 3).
*   Application A configures a threshold Trust Score for acceptable interactions. If Application B’s score falls below the threshold, Application A can:
    *   Prompt the user for confirmation.
    *   Restrict the data shared with Application B.
    *   Terminate the interaction.
*   Application A reports its interaction experience (positive or negative) with Application B to the Trust Authority.

**3. Trust Authority Service:**

*   A centralized service responsible for:
    *   Maintaining Trust Scores for all registered applications.
    *   Receiving interaction reports from applications.
    *   Calculating Trust Scores based on collected data.
    *   Providing Trust Scores to requesting applications.
*   Trust Authority utilizes a distributed ledger (blockchain-inspired) to ensure data integrity and prevent manipulation of Trust Scores.
*   The Trust Authority service can be decentralized, leveraging a network of trusted nodes.

**4. Implementation Details:**

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/trust/score?appId={appId}`: Returns the Trust Score for a specified application.
    *   `/trust/report?appId={appId}&reporterId={reporterId}&rating={rating}&comment={comment}`: Submits an interaction report.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ApplicationInfo`: `{appId, name, version, signingCertificate, trustScore, lastUpdated}`
    *   `InteractionReport`: `{reporterId, targetAppId, rating, timestamp, comment}`
*   **Pseudocode (Application A interacting with Application B):**

```
function interactWithAppB(data) {
  trustAuthority = new TrustAuthorityService();
  appBTrustScore = trustAuthority.getTrustScore(appBId);

  if (appBTrustScore < acceptableThreshold) {
    displayUserPrompt("Application B has a low trust score. Proceed?");
    if (userChoosesCancel()) {
      return;
    }
  }

  sendDataToAppB(data);
  reportInteractionToTrustAuthority(appBId, positiveExperience);
}
```

**5. Advanced Features:**

*   **Context-Aware Trust:**  Adjust Trust Scores based on the specific context of the interaction (e.g., network location, time of day).
*   **Reputation Chains:**  Applications can vouch for other applications, creating a “web of trust”.
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Adjust acceptable Trust Score thresholds dynamically based on the sensitivity of the data being shared.
