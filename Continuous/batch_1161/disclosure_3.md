## Adaptive Data Obfuscation with Dynamic Sensitivity Mapping

**Concept:** Extend local data classification beyond simple sensitivity labeling to *proactively obfuscate* data based on classification *and* predicted access patterns. This creates a multi-layered security approach where data isnâ€™t just categorized, but its presentation is actively altered to minimize information leakage even in the event of a breach.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component: Predictive Access Engine (PAE)**

*   **Function:**  Monitors data access requests (who, what, when, where) within the client network. Utilizes machine learning to predict future access patterns.
*   **Data Input:**  Access logs, user roles, application context, time of day, data source, historical access data.
*   **Output:**  Probability scores for different access scenarios (e.g., "user X likely to access field Y within timeframe Z").  Access request anomaly detection.

**2. Component: Dynamic Obfuscation Module (DOM)**

*   **Function:**  Applies reversible obfuscation techniques to data *before* it's stored or transmitted.  Obfuscation level is determined by both data sensitivity *and* PAE predictions.
*   **Obfuscation Techniques:**
    *   **Tokenization:** Replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive tokens.  Tokens can be contextual (e.g., different tokens for different applications).
    *   **Data Masking:**  Partial redaction of data (e.g., masking all but the last four digits of a credit card number).  Masking patterns can be dynamic.
    *   **Encryption with Dynamic Keys:**  Encrypting data with keys that change periodically based on access patterns.
    *   **Data Shuffling:** Re-ordering data elements within a record to disrupt pattern recognition.  Shuffling is reversible.
    *   **Noise Injection:** Adding small, random perturbations to numerical data to preserve statistical properties while obscuring exact values.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Sensitivity-Obfuscation Mapping:  Defines the appropriate obfuscation techniques for each sensitivity level (e.g., "High Sensitivity" -> "Tokenization + Dynamic Encryption").
    *   Access Pattern Weighting:  Adjusts the obfuscation level based on the PAE's predicted access probability.  Higher probability = stronger obfuscation.

**3. Component: Reversible Transformation Layer (RTL)**

*   **Function:**  Responsible for de-obfuscating data when it's accessed by authorized users/applications.  This layer uses the same keys, tokens, and transformation parameters that were used during obfuscation.
*   **Key Management:** Securely stores and manages obfuscation keys and transformation parameters.
*   **Access Control Integration:** Enforces access control policies to ensure that only authorized users/applications can access de-obfuscated data.

**4. System Architecture:**

```pseudocode
// Local Data Classification Service (as in the patent)
function classifyData(data, source) {
  // ... existing classification logic ...
  return sensitivityLevel;
}

// Dynamic Obfuscation Pipeline
function obfuscateData(data, sensitivityLevel) {
  // 1. Get obfuscation parameters based on sensitivityLevel
  obfuscationParams = getObfuscationParams(sensitivityLevel);

  // 2. Predict access patterns using PAE
  accessPrediction = PredictiveAccessEngine.predictAccess(data);

  // 3. Adjust obfuscation level based on prediction
  adjustedParams = adjustObfuscationParams(obfuscationParams, accessPrediction);

  // 4. Apply obfuscation techniques
  obfuscatedData = applyObfuscation(data, adjustedParams);

  return obfuscatedData;
}

function deObfuscateData(obfuscatedData) {
  // 1. Retrieve obfuscation parameters
  obfuscationParams = getObfuscationParams(obfuscatedData);

  // 2. Apply reverse transformations
  deObfuscatedData = applyReverseTransformations(obfuscatedData, obfuscationParams);

  return deObfuscatedData;
}
```

**5. Data Flow:**

1.  Data is received from a data source.
2.  The Local Data Classification Service classifies the data and assigns a sensitivity level.
3.  The `obfuscateData` function is called to obfuscate the data.
4.  Obfuscated data is stored or transmitted.
5.  When authorized access is requested, the `deObfuscateData` function is called to de-obfuscate the data before it's presented to the user/application.

**6.  Security Considerations:**

*   Key Management:  Robust key management is crucial to protect obfuscation keys.
*   Access Control:  Strict access control policies must be enforced to prevent unauthorized access to obfuscated and de-obfuscated data.
*   Audit Logging:  All obfuscation and de-obfuscation operations should be logged for auditing purposes.

This system enhances data security by proactively obscuring data based on sensitivity and predicted access patterns. It provides an additional layer of defense against data breaches and minimizes the risk of information leakage.
