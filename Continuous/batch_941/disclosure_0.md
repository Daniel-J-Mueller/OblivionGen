**Dynamic Advertiser Reputation Propagation & Visualization**

**Concept:** Extend the weighted scoring system beyond individual ad submissions to create a dynamically updated, visually-represented reputation network for advertisers. Instead of solely flagging potential risks during initial submission, this system learns from interactions *after* the ad goes live – user reports, click-through rates, conversion rates, even dwell time on landing pages – and propagates that information to similar advertisers based on identified attributes.

**Specs:**

1.  **Attribute Extraction Module:** Analyze advertiser data (email domain, stated business type, website content, payment information) to extract a set of quantifiable attributes. These attributes are weighted based on their predictive power for identifying malicious actors (determined via machine learning on historical data).

2.  **Reputation Score Calculation:**  Each advertiser receives a baseline reputation score. This score is dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   **Initial Weighted Checks:** (As per the provided patent) - contribute to the baseline.
    *   **Post-Launch Interaction Data:**
        *   *User Reports:* Negative reports decrease the score.
        *   *Click-Through Rate (CTR):* Low CTR decreases the score.
        *   *Conversion Rate:* Low conversion decreases the score.
        *   *Dwell Time:* Short dwell time on landing pages decreases the score.
        *   *Payment Disputes:* Disputes significantly decrease the score.
    *   **Network Propagation:**  If Advertiser A is flagged for malicious activity, advertisers sharing similar attributes (identified by the Attribute Extraction Module) receive a *proportional* decrease in their reputation score. The degree of decrease is determined by the strength of the attribute similarity.

3.  **Visualization Layer:** Create a network graph visually representing advertisers as nodes. Node size and color intensity represent the reputation score.  Connections between nodes represent attribute similarity. This graph would be accessible to security analysts.

4.  **Automated Threshold Adjustment:** Implement an algorithm that automatically adjusts the thresholds for flagging potential risks based on the overall health of the advertising ecosystem. This prevents false positives and adapts to evolving threats.

**Pseudocode (Reputation Score Update):**

```
function updateReputationScore(advertiserID):
  baselineScore = calculateBaselineScore(advertiserID)
  interactionScore = 0

  // Calculate interaction score from user reports, CTR, conversion, etc.
  interactionScore = calculateInteractionScore(advertiserID)

  networkEffect = 0
  // Identify similar advertisers
  similarAdvertisers = findSimilarAdvertisers(advertiserID)
  // Calculate network effect based on reputation of similar advertisers
  for each advertiser in similarAdvertisers:
    networkEffect += advertiser.reputationScore * similarityWeight(advertiserID, advertiser.advertiserID)

  newReputationScore = baselineScore + interactionScore + networkEffect

  //Apply a smoothing factor to avoid drastic score changes
  smoothedScore = (0.7 * newReputationScore) + (0.3 * advertiser.reputationScore)

  advertiser.reputationScore = smoothedScore
  return advertiser.reputationScore
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Advertiser`: Object containing advertiser data (ID, email, website, reputationScore, attributes).
*   `Attribute`:  Object containing attribute name, weight, and value for a given advertiser.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with third-party threat intelligence feeds.
*   Machine learning models to predict malicious activity based on attribute combinations.
*   Automated quarantine of advertisers with persistently low reputation scores.
