## Adaptive Anomaly Thresholding via Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

**Concept:**  Instead of relying on a static normalcy score threshold, leverage a GAN to dynamically generate anomaly thresholds based on real-time data distributions. This addresses the issue of threshold drift and the inherent difficulty in setting a universal anomaly cutoff.

**Specifications:**

**1. GAN Architecture:**

*   **Generator (G):**  Takes a latent vector (z) as input and generates synthetic request data that *mimics* normal behavior, similar to the data used to train the initial autoencoder.  The output of the generator will be a reconstructed request vector (action, context, system ID).
*   **Discriminator (D):**  Takes as input either real request data (from the live system) or generated request data (from G).  D learns to distinguish between real and generated data.  The output of D is a probability score indicating the authenticity of the input.

**2. Training Process (Continuous Online Learning):**

*   **Initial Training:** Train the GAN using the same historical data initially used to train the autoencoder.  This provides a baseline understanding of "normal" behavior.
*   **Online Adaptation:**  Continuously monitor live system requests.
    *   Periodically, sample a batch of recent "normal" requests (requests that the autoencoder classified as non-anomalous with high confidence).
    *   Use these samples to retrain both G and D in an adversarial manner. This allows the GAN to adapt to evolving patterns of normal behavior.
    *   Implement a decay factor to gradually weight newer data more heavily during retraining, ensuring the GAN remains responsive to recent changes.

**3. Anomaly Scoring & Thresholding:**

*   **Autoencoder Reconstruction:** As in the original patent, use the trained autoencoder to reconstruct incoming requests.
*   **GAN-Generated Threshold:**
    *   Feed a large number of synthetic requests generated by G into the autoencoder.
    *   Calculate the reconstruction errors for these synthetic requests.
    *   Determine the 95th (or configurable percentile) percentile of these reconstruction errors. This serves as the dynamic anomaly threshold.
*   **Anomaly Determination:**  If the reconstruction error of a live request *exceeds* the GAN-generated threshold, flag the request as potentially anomalous.

**4.  System Components:**

*   **Data Ingestion Module:** Collects request data (attributes, context, system ID).
*   **Autoencoder Module:**  Performs reconstruction as described in the base patent.
*   **GAN Training Module:**  Handles training and updating of the GAN.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Module:**  Generates the anomaly threshold using the GAN-generated data.
*   **Anomaly Detection Module:**  Compares request reconstruction errors to the dynamic threshold and flags anomalies.
*   **Blocking/Alerting Module:**  Takes action on detected anomalies (blocking, alerting, logging).

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Module):**

```
function detect_anomaly(request):
  reconstruction_error = autoencoder.reconstruct(request)
  dynamic_threshold = dynamic_threshold_module.get_threshold()

  if reconstruction_error > dynamic_threshold:
    anomaly_flag = True
  else:
    anomaly_flag = False

  return anomaly_flag
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Addresses threshold drift and improves accuracy.
*   **Enhanced Robustness:**  The GAN learns the underlying distribution of normal behavior, making the system more resilient to noise and outliers.
*   **Reduced False Positives:** By learning the nuances of normal behavior, the GAN can more accurately distinguish between legitimate and anomalous requests.
