## Dynamic Network ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the automated change management system to incorporate a ‘shadow’ network environment for real-time validation *before* production deployment, coupled with a predictive rollback mechanism leveraging AI to anticipate failure modes *beyond* simple performance degradation.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadow Network Creation & Synchronization:**

*   **Component:** ‘Mirror Engine’ – software module residing on the server computer.
*   **Function:** Dynamically creates a virtualized or segmented replica of the production network (the ‘shadow’ network).
*   **Synchronization:** Near real-time data replication from production to shadow.  Utilizes network traffic mirroring, database replication (if applicable), and configuration state synchronization.  Prioritize critical traffic for mirroring.
*   **Scalability:**  Must support scaling shadow network size to match production, or a representative subset, depending on the scope of the change.
*   **API:** Provides an API to route test traffic to the shadow network, bypassing production.

**2.  AI-Powered Failure Mode Prediction:**

*   **Component:** ‘PreCog Module’ – integrated AI engine.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical network change data (successful and failed deployments).
    *   Real-time shadow network performance metrics (CPU, memory, latency, throughput).
    *   Network topology information.
    *   Configuration change scripts themselves (analyzed for potentially problematic commands or sequences).
*   **AI Model:** Hybrid approach - combination of supervised learning (trained on historical data) and reinforcement learning (dynamically learns from shadow network simulations).
*   **Prediction Output:**  Probability score for various failure modes: performance degradation, service outage, security vulnerability. Generates ‘rollback signatures’ - detailed instructions for reverting specific changes if a particular failure mode is predicted.

**3. Automated Validation & Rollback Workflow:**

*   **Phase 1: Shadow Deployment:** Configuration changes are *first* applied to the shadow network.
*   **Phase 2: Simulated Traffic & Monitoring:**  Simulated or sanitized production traffic is routed to the shadow network.  The PreCog Module monitors performance and predicts potential failures.
*   **Phase 3: Risk Assessment:** The PreCog Module assesses the overall risk based on predicted failure probabilities.  A ‘go/no-go’ decision is made for production deployment.
*   **Phase 4: Production Deployment (if approved):** Changes are deployed to production.
*   **Phase 5: Real-Time Monitoring & Predictive Rollback:**
    *   Monitor production performance in real-time.
    *   If performance degrades or the PreCog Module predicts a failure (based on real-time data), *automatically* trigger the rollback signature associated with the predicted failure mode. This happens *before* a major outage occurs.
*   **Pseudocode (Rollback Trigger):**

```
IF (PreCogModule.predictFailure(realTimeData) OR performanceDegraded(realTimeData)) THEN
    failureMode = PreCogModule.getFailureMode()
    rollbackSignature = PreCogModule.getRollbackSignature(failureMode)
    executeRollback(rollbackSignature)
ENDIF
```

**4. Rollback Signature Format:**

*   Structured data format (e.g., JSON) containing:
    *   List of configuration changes to revert.
    *   Order of reversion.
    *   Specific commands or scripts to execute.
    *   Dependencies between changes.
    *   Verification steps to confirm successful rollback.

**5. Analytics Integration:**

*   Collect data on:
    *   Number of changes validated on the shadow network.
    *   Accuracy of failure mode predictions.
    *   Number of rollbacks triggered.
    *   Time to rollback.
    *   Root cause of failures.
*   Use this data to continuously improve the AI model and the automated change management system.
