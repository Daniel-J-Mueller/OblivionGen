## Adaptive Projection Mapping with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** A projector device capable of dynamically adjusting projected content *based on real-time biofeedback from the viewer*. This moves beyond simple ambient lighting synchronization to create truly immersive and personalized experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Standard high-lumen projector with integrated high-resolution camera (minimum 4K).
*   **Biofeedback Sensors:**
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) sensor (integrated into a comfortable head-worn band – think lightweight headphones).
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor (integrated into the head-worn band, contact points on forehead/temples).
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) sensor (dry-electrode, multi-channel – integrated into head-worn band, focus on frontal lobe activity). *Optional for advanced implementation*.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated onboard processing unit (edge computing) capable of:
    *   Real-time biofeedback data acquisition and analysis.
    *   Image warping and blending.
    *   Content adaptation/selection logic.
    *   Communication with content source (local or network).
*   **Software Architecture:**
    1.  **Biofeedback Module:** Processes raw sensor data, filters noise, extracts relevant features (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance, alpha/beta brainwave ratios).
    2.  **Emotion/State Mapping:**  Utilizes machine learning algorithms to map biofeedback features to emotional states or cognitive states (e.g., relaxation, focus, excitement, anxiety).  *Pre-trained models for common states, with user-specific calibration/learning*.
    3.  **Content Adaptation Engine:**  Based on the inferred state, this module modifies the projected content in real-time:
        *   **Color Palette:** Adjusts color saturation, brightness, and hue to evoke specific moods. (e.g., calming blues and greens for relaxation, vibrant reds and oranges for excitement).
        *   **Motion Dynamics:**  Changes the speed and complexity of projected animations/patterns.  (e.g., slow, fluid motions for relaxation, fast, dynamic patterns for excitement).
        *   **Content Selection:**  Switches between pre-defined content ‘scenes’ based on the inferred state. (e.g., nature scenes for relaxation, abstract patterns for creativity).
        *   **Geometric Distortion:**  Subtle warping of the projected image to enhance emotional impact. (e.g. expansion during positive states, contraction during negative states)
    4.  **Projection Mapping Module:** Utilizes computer vision techniques to dynamically adjust the projection based on the environment, ensuring accurate alignment and distortion correction.
*   **Communication Protocols:**
    *   Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for content streaming and control.
    *   USB-C for data transfer and charging.
*   **Power Requirements:** Standard AC power with integrated power supply.

**Pseudocode (Content Adaptation Engine):**

```
function adaptContent(biofeedbackData) {
  // 1. Analyze biofeedback data
  state = analyzeBiofeedback(biofeedbackData); // Returns inferred state (e.g., "Relaxed", "Focused", "Excited")

  // 2. Select adaptation parameters based on state
  if (state == "Relaxed") {
    colorPalette = ["#ADD8E6", "#90EE90", "#F0FFF0"]; // Light blues, greens, and whites
    motionSpeed = 0.5;
    contentScene = "NatureScene1";
    geometricDistortion = 0.0;
  } else if (state == "Focused") {
    colorPalette = ["#F5F5DC", "#E6E6FA", "#FFFFFF"]; // Beige, Lavender, White
    motionSpeed = 0.8;
    contentScene = "AbstractPattern1";
    geometricDistortion = 0.0;
  } else if (state == "Excited") {
    colorPalette = ["#FF0000", "#FFA500", "#FFFF00"]; // Red, Orange, Yellow
    motionSpeed = 1.2;
    contentScene = "DynamicVisuals1";
    geometricDistortion = 0.1;
  } else {
    // Default parameters
    colorPalette = ["#FFFFFF"];
    motionSpeed = 1.0;
    contentScene = "DefaultScene";
    geometricDistortion = 0.0;
  }

  // 3. Apply adaptation parameters to projected content
  setColors(colorPalette);
  setMotionSpeed(motionSpeed);
  setContentScene(contentScene);
  setGeometricDistortion(geometricDistortion);
}
```

**Potential Applications:** Immersive entertainment, therapeutic applications (stress reduction, meditation), creative environments (enhancing flow state), personalized ambient lighting, interactive art installations.
