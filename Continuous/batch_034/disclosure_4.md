## Dynamic Constraint Propagation for Multi-Modal Route Optimization

**Concept:** Extend the reactive route planning system to actively *predict* and propagate constraints arising from real-time events across *all* potential routes – not just those currently in the candidate column pool – and across *multiple* transportation modes.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on reacting to changes (canceled/locked legs). This expands that to *anticipate* disruptions and proactively adjust potential routes *before* they become problems, and importantly, leverages multi-modal options to mitigate those disruptions. Think beyond just road transport – incorporate rail, air, and potentially even drone delivery – and the constraints *between* those modes.

**Specs:**

1.  **Real-Time Constraint Graph (RTCG):** A dynamically updated graph representing all potential legs and connections within the transportation network. Nodes represent locations, and edges represent legs with associated costs (time, distance, fuel), capacity, and *predicted* disruption probabilities (derived from historical data, weather forecasts, traffic patterns, news feeds, etc.).

2.  **Disruption Propagation Engine:**
    *   When a disruption is detected (e.g., road closure, flight delay), the engine identifies affected nodes and edges in the RTCG.
    *   It then propagates the disruption's impact *forward* and *backward* through the graph, recalculating costs and probabilities for affected legs.  This isn't just adding a fixed delay; it’s modeling cascading effects – a road closure might divert traffic, increasing congestion on alternative routes, and potentially impacting connections to rail hubs.
    *   The propagation isn't binary (disrupted/not disrupted). It assigns a “disruption score” to each leg, reflecting the severity and likelihood of impact.

3.  **Multi-Modal Route Planner:**
    *   Utilizes the RTCG and disruption scores to generate a wider range of candidate routes, including combinations of different transportation modes.
    *   Employs a cost function that considers not only traditional factors (distance, time, cost) but also disruption risk. Higher disruption scores increase the cost of a route.
    *   Includes constraints related to modal transfers (e.g., time required to transfer goods between truck and rail, availability of intermodal facilities).
    *   Can prioritize routes that are more resilient to disruptions, even if they are slightly longer or more expensive under normal conditions.

4.  **Predictive Constraint Generation:**
    *   Leverages machine learning models to predict potential disruptions *before* they occur. For example, predicting road closures based on weather forecasts and event schedules.
    *   These predicted disruptions are added to the RTCG as “soft constraints”, allowing the route planner to proactively adjust routes.

**Pseudocode (Route Generation):**

```
function generate_route(origin, destination, current_time):
  route_candidates = []
  
  // A* search algorithm adapted for multi-modal routes and disruption costs
  function a_star(node, path, cost):
    if node == destination:
      route_candidates.append((path, cost))
      return
    
    for neighbor in get_neighbors(node):
      edge_cost = get_edge_cost(neighbor, disruption_score)
      new_cost = cost + edge_cost
      
      if new_cost < max_cost: // Set a maximum cost to avoid infinite loops
        a_star(neighbor, path + [neighbor], new_cost)
  
  a_star(origin, [origin], 0)
  
  //Sort route candidates by total cost (distance, time, disruption risk)
  sorted_routes = sort_routes_by_cost(route_candidates)
  
  return sorted_routes[0] // Return the best route
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **RTCG Node:** `location, capacity, disruption_probability`
*   **RTCG Edge:** `origin_node, destination_node, distance, travel_time, cost, mode (truck, rail, air), disruption_score`
*   **Route Candidate:** `path (list of nodes), total_cost`

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased resilience to disruptions.
*   Improved route optimization in dynamic environments.
*   Enhanced utilization of multi-modal transportation options.
*   Proactive mitigation of potential delays and cost overruns.
