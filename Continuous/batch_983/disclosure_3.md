**Adaptive Actor Replay with Causal Inference**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the actor debugging system with the capability to *replay* not just the identified error-causing messages, but entire *causal chains* of messages leading up to the error, within a simulated environment. This allows for more comprehensive analysis and debugging beyond simply re-processing a single problematic message.  Furthermore, this system needs to adapt the replay length dynamically based on detected causal complexity.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Causal Graph Builder:** A module that, during normal operation, passively constructs a directed graph representing the message flow between actors.  Edges are weighted based on frequency of communication and latency.
*   **Error Condition Trigger:** Identical to the original patent's error detection mechanism.
*   **Causal Chain Extractor:** Upon error detection, this module traverses the Causal Graph *backwards* from the error-causing actor, identifying actors involved in the message chain leading to the error. A configurable “depth” parameter limits the traversal.  It prioritizes paths with highest cumulative edge weight (most frequent/lowest latency communication).
*   **Simulated Environment:**  A virtual environment mirroring the actor system's runtime. Actors are represented as software objects. This environment allows replay without impacting the live system.
*   **Adaptive Replay Engine:** The core replay mechanism.  It receives the extracted causal chain and the identified error message. It simulates the actor system within the Simulated Environment, replaying the messages in the causal chain *and* the error-causing message.
*   **Complexity Metric:**  A metric that estimates the causal complexity of the replayed scenario. This can be based on the number of actors involved, the length of the causal chain, the number of branching paths in the chain, or the degree of inter-actor communication.
*   **Replay Length Adaptor:**  Dynamically adjusts the length of the replayed causal chain based on the Complexity Metric. If complexity is low, the chain can be shortened for faster analysis. If complexity is high, the chain may need to be extended or replayed multiple times with different starting points to fully understand the error.

**III. Data Structures:**

*   **Message Object:** Contains message ID, sender ID, receiver ID, timestamp, message payload, and optionally, metadata for debugging (e.g., function call stack).
*   **Actor State Object:**  Represents the internal state of an actor at a given point in time. This is a snapshot of relevant variables and data structures.
*   **Causal Graph:**  A directed graph where nodes represent actors and edges represent message flow. Edge weights represent communication frequency/latency.

**IV. Pseudocode (Adaptive Replay Engine):**

```
function AdaptiveReplay(errorCondition, causalChain, complexityMetric):
    initialize SimulatedEnvironment()
    loadActorStates(causalChain) // Load initial states of actors in the chain

    replayLength = baseReplayLength // Default replay length

    if complexityMetric > highThreshold:
        replayLength = extendedReplayLength
    elif complexityMetric < lowThreshold:
        replayLength = shortenedReplayLength

    for message in causalChain + [errorCondition]:
        simulateMessage(message) // Process message in Simulated Environment

    // Capture actor states after replay
    finalActorStates = captureActorStates()

    // Return final actor states and replay statistics for analysis
    return finalActorStates, replayStatistics
```

**V. Operational Procedure:**

1.  During normal operation, the Causal Graph Builder passively monitors message flow and builds the Causal Graph.
2.  When an error condition is detected, the Error Condition Trigger signals the Causal Chain Extractor.
3.  The Causal Chain Extractor identifies the relevant causal chain.
4.  The Adaptive Replay Engine is invoked with the causal chain and error condition.
5.  The engine loads initial actor states, replays the messages, and captures final actor states.
6.  An analyst can examine the captured actor states to identify the root cause of the error.
7.  The Replay Length Adaptor dynamically adjusts the replay length based on the complexity of the scenario, optimizing analysis time.
