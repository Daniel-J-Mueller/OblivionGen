## Adaptive Camera Network with Predictive Power Allocation

**System Overview:** A distributed camera network leveraging edge processing and predictive analytics to dynamically allocate power and bandwidth based on anticipated events. This system moves beyond reactive triggering (like the provided patent’s ‘person of interest’ detection) to *proactive* resource management.

**Core Components:**

*   **Edge Nodes (EN):** Each camera (including the 'first' and 'second' cameras mentioned in the patent) functions as an Edge Node. Each EN has a local processing unit capable of running basic AI models.
*   **Central Coordinator (CC):** A server (or distributed server cluster) responsible for global event prediction and resource allocation.
*   **Communication Network:**  A low-latency network connecting ENs and the CC (can be wired, wireless, or a hybrid).

**Functional Specifications:**

1.  **Event Prediction Module (CC):**
    *   **Data Input:** Historical event data (motion detection, object recognition, time of day, day of week, weather data, social media trends – pulled from external APIs).
    *   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – trained to predict the probability of specific events occurring in the camera’s field of view. Example events: pedestrian traffic increase, vehicle entering a restricted area, package delivery, animal activity.
    *   **Output:**  A probability map indicating the likelihood of each event occurring within a defined time horizon (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).

2.  **Dynamic Power Allocation Module (CC):**
    *   **Input:** Event probability maps from the Event Prediction Module, camera power status (from ENs), available network bandwidth.
    *   **Algorithm:**
        *   Assign a "Priority Score" to each camera based on the predicted probability of events *and* the importance of those events (configurable by an administrator).  Higher probability, more important event = higher Priority Score.
        *   Allocate power and bandwidth proportionally to Priority Scores.  Cameras with high scores receive more resources.
        *   Implement a “Minimum Power Level” to ensure all cameras remain online for basic functionality (e.g., time synchronization, status reporting).
        *   Introduce a “Power Budget” – a maximum total power consumption for the entire network.

3.  **Edge Node Processing:**
    *   **Low-Power Mode:** Cameras operate in a low-power state, performing minimal processing (e.g., basic motion detection, time synchronization).
    *   **Prediction-Triggered Activation:**  When the CC predicts a high probability of an event, it sends a "Pre-Activation" signal to the relevant EN.
    *   **Pre-Activation Sequence:** The EN increases power to its processing unit and activates more advanced AI models (e.g., object recognition, facial recognition).  *Before* the event actually happens.
    *   **Event Confirmation:**  When the event occurs, the EN captures and transmits data to the CC.

**Pseudocode (CC – Dynamic Power Allocation):**

```
// Event Prediction Module outputs probability map: eventProbabilities[cameraID][eventID]

// Configuration:
minPowerLevel = 10W
powerBudget = 1000W
eventImportanceWeights[eventID]  // Assign weights to different event types

function allocatePower(eventProbabilities, cameraStatus):
  totalPriority = 0
  cameraPriorities = {}

  for cameraID in cameraIDs:
    priority = 0
    for eventID in eventIDs:
      priority += eventProbabilities[cameraID][eventID] * eventImportanceWeights[eventID]
    cameraPriorities[cameraID] = priority
    totalPriority += priority

  powerAllocations = {}
  remainingPower = powerBudget

  for cameraID in cameraIDs:
    allocation = (cameraPriorities[cameraID] / totalPriority) * powerBudget
    allocation = max(allocation, minPowerLevel) // Ensure minimum power
    allocation = min(allocation, remainingPower) // Respect budget
    powerAllocations[cameraID] = allocation
    remainingPower -= allocation

  // Distribute remaining power proportionally if any
  if remainingPower > 0:
    for cameraID in cameraIDs:
      powerAllocations[cameraID] += (cameraPriorities[cameraID] / totalPriority) * remainingPower

  return powerAllocations
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves *beyond* reactive event detection to *proactive* resource allocation. By predicting events, it can pre-activate cameras, reduce latency, and optimize power consumption, leading to a more efficient and responsive surveillance system. The key is the integration of predictive analytics with dynamic power allocation at the network level. This isn’t simply about turning cameras on/off; it’s about intelligently preparing the network for anticipated events.
