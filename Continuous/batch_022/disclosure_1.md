## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' & Predictive Fault Isolation

**Concept:** Extend the existing testing framework to create a ‘shadow’ network mirroring live traffic, allowing for proactive fault detection and predictive maintenance *before* issues impact production systems. This leverages the test infrastructure to continuously validate network health *without* interrupting live operations.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Network Creation:** A software module capable of dynamically replicating network traffic flows to a designated ‘shadow’ network. This necessitates packet capture/forwarding capabilities and the ability to map live devices to shadow counterparts.
*   **Traffic Mirroring Policy:** Granular control over which traffic is mirrored. Policies can be defined based on source/destination IP, port, protocol, VLAN, or other relevant criteria.  A "percentage-based mirroring" option would allow for reduced load on the primary network during testing.
*   **Shadow Device Emulation:** Shadow network devices should emulate the behavior of live devices as closely as possible, including protocol responses, stateful firewall rules, and application-level behavior. This may require limited virtualization or containerization.
*   **Automated Test Injection:** Integration with the existing test plan execution engine. The engine should be able to inject modified packets, simulate latency, introduce errors, or trigger specific events within the shadow network to test resilience.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** A machine learning-based system that analyzes traffic patterns within the shadow network. The engine learns ‘normal’ behavior and flags deviations as potential anomalies.
*   **Predictive Fault Isolation:** Based on anomalies, the system attempts to isolate the root cause of the issue *before* it manifests in the production environment. This may involve simulating different failure scenarios within the shadow network to determine the most likely cause.
*   **Dynamic Topology Update:** The shadow network’s topology must automatically adapt to changes in the production network. This requires a real-time synchronization mechanism and an ability to reconfigure the shadow devices accordingly.
*   **Reporting & Alerting:**  Detailed reports on shadow network activity, anomalies, and predictive fault analysis.  Alerts should be configurable based on severity and type of issue.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
function detectAnomaly(shadowNetworkTraffic):
  // Calculate baseline traffic metrics (e.g., packet rate, latency, bandwidth)
  baselineMetrics = calculateBaseline(historicalTrafficData)

  // Calculate current traffic metrics
  currentMetrics = calculateMetrics(shadowNetworkTraffic)

  // Calculate deviation from baseline
  deviation = calculateDeviation(currentMetrics, baselineMetrics)

  // Apply threshold to determine anomaly
  if deviation > anomalyThreshold:
    // Log anomaly details
    logAnomaly(anomalyDetails)
    // Trigger further investigation (e.g., failure simulation)
    triggerInvestigation()
  return anomalyDetected // Boolean
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   Utilize existing network taps or SPAN ports to capture live traffic.
*   Leverage virtualization/containerization technologies to create shadow devices.
*   Implement a distributed architecture for scalability and fault tolerance.
*   Provide a web-based interface for configuration, monitoring, and reporting.
*   Integrate with existing network management systems.
