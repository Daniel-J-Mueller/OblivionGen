## Adaptive Kernel Anisotropic Pooling for Multi-Scale Contextual Embeddings

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Innovation:** Implement an anisotropic pooling layer with dynamically adjustable kernel sizes per embedding dimension. This contrasts with static kernel sizes or uniform scaling.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** Standard GPU with sufficient memory for handling multi-dimensional data and iterative computations.
*   **Software Requirements:**  TensorFlow, PyTorch, or similar deep learning framework. Python 3.x. Libraries for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) handling (e.g., Biopython).

**Detailed Description:**

The current patent details a system using anisotropic pooling. This expansion focuses on *adaptively* adjusting the anisotropic pooling kernels based on the input data, improving contextual embedding, especially for variable-length biological sequences.

1.  **Input:** A multi-dimensional data tensor representing a sequence arrangement (e.g., MSA matrix) with dimensions [Batch Size, Length, Height, Embedding Dimension].

2.  **Kernel Size Prediction Module:**
    *   A small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained *concurrently* with the main embedding model.
    *   Input to the CNN:  A slice of the input tensor along the Embedding Dimension (e.g., a single 'channel' representing a specific amino acid property).
    *   Output of the CNN:  A vector of kernel sizes – one per embedding dimension. The kernel sizes are constrained to be positive integers.  Activation function: Softplus to ensure positivity.
    *   Training: The kernel size prediction module is trained using a loss function that encourages kernel size variation based on information content. Example: a loss term based on the entropy of the input slice – higher entropy should result in larger kernel sizes.

3.  **Adaptive Anisotropic Pooling Layer:**
    *   The kernel sizes generated by the Kernel Size Prediction Module are applied to the anisotropic pooling operation.
    *   Per Embedding Dimension:
        *   Kernel Size: Determined by the CNN.
        *   Stride: Fixed or determined by a separate small network.
        *   Pooling Operation: Max Pooling or Average Pooling.
    *   The anisotropic pooling is applied across the Height and Length dimensions, reducing the spatial resolution while preserving the embedding dimension.
    *   Multiple iterations of the Adaptive Anisotropic Pooling are possible, allowing the model to learn hierarchical representations.

4.  **Iterative Encoding Loop:** This adaptive anisotropic pooling layer is integrated into the iterative encoding loop alongside the convolutional layer as described in the original patent.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def adaptive_anisotropic_pooling(input_tensor):
    # Input: input_tensor [Batch, Length, Height, Embedding]

    # Kernel Size Prediction
    kernel_sizes = kernel_size_prediction_module(input_tensor) # [Batch, Embedding]

    # Adaptive Pooling
    output_tensor = []
    for batch in range(input_tensor.shape[0]):
        batch_output = []
        for embedding_dim in range(input_tensor.shape[3]):
            # Get kernel size for this embedding dimension
            kernel_size = kernel_sizes[batch, embedding_dim]

            # Perform anisotropic pooling
            pooled_feature = anisotropic_pool(input_tensor[batch, :, :, embedding_dim], kernel_size)
            batch_output.append(pooled_feature)
        output_tensor.append(np.stack(batch_output, axis=-1))
    return np.stack(output_tensor, axis=0)

def anisotropic_pool(feature_map, kernel_size):
  # implementation of anisotropic pooling, given a kernel size.
  # Assumes kernel_size is an integer.
  # Simplification: assumes stride equals kernel size.
  # can easily extend to different strides.
  pooled_map = []
  for i in range(0, feature_map.shape[0] - kernel_size + 1, kernel_size):
    for j in range(0, feature_map.shape[1] - kernel_size + 1, kernel_size):
      window = feature_map[i:i+kernel_size, j:j+kernel_size]
      pooled_map.append(np.max(window)) # Example: Max pooling
  return np.array(pooled_map)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Contextual Embedding:** Adapting the kernel sizes allows the model to capture features at different scales, leading to more informative contextual embeddings.
*   **Variable-Length Sequence Handling:**  The adaptive kernel sizes can handle variable-length sequences more effectively than fixed-size kernels.
*   **Increased Model Capacity:**  The kernel size prediction module introduces additional parameters, increasing the model's capacity and ability to learn complex patterns.
*   **Feature Selection:** The CNN learns to 'select' appropriate kernel sizes based on the input data, effectively performing feature selection.
