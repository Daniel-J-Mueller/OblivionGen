## Decentralized Key Shard Distribution & Rotation

**Concept:** Instead of a central Key Management Server generating and distributing one-time use keys, leverage a decentralized network (potentially a blockchain or distributed hash table) for key shard generation, distribution, and automated rotation. This increases resilience and reduces the single point of failure inherent in the original patent.

**Specs:**

**1. Shard Generation:**

*   **Input:** A master symmetric key (shared securely, potentially via Hardware Security Module - HSM). A device identifier. A rotation period (e.g., monthly).
*   **Process:**
    1.  A Key Shard Generator (KSG) service (could be a smart contract or a distributed application) takes the device identifier and master symmetric key.
    2.  KSG generates a pseudo-random number stream based on these inputs. This stream is the basis for key shard creation.
    3.  The stream is divided into *n* equally sized segments. Each segment represents a key shard.
    4.  Each shard is encrypted using a unique, ephemeral key derived from the segment's index and the master key (to ensure shards are not interchangeable).
    5.  The ephemeral key used to encrypt each shard is *not* stored.
*   **Output:** *n* encrypted key shards.

**2. Shard Distribution:**

*   **Network:** A permissioned or public blockchain, or a robust Distributed Hash Table (DHT) like IPFS.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Each key shard is stored on the network with a unique identifier derived from the device ID and shard index.
    2.  A "Shard Map" is created – a record linking the device ID to the list of shard identifiers on the network. The Shard Map is also stored on the network.
    3.  The device retrieves the Shard Map.
    4.  The device retrieves all *n* key shards using their identifiers.

**3. Key Reconstruction & Rotation:**

*   **Device Process:**
    1.  The device receives the encrypted key shards.
    2.  The device uses the master symmetric key to derive a decryption key for each shard. The derivation process utilizes the shard index (as in the shard generation step).
    3.  The device decrypts each shard.
    4.  The decrypted shards are concatenated to form the one-time-use private key.
*   **Rotation:**
    1.  Before the rotation period expires, a new set of key shards is generated and distributed.
    2.  The old shard map is marked as invalid.
    3.  The device automatically fetches the new shard map and new key shards during its next authentication cycle.
    4.  Old shards are automatically garbage collected based on network rules.

**4. Signature Generation:**

*   The device uses the reconstructed one-time-use private key to sign updates or messages as described in the original patent.

**Pseudocode (Device – Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructPrivateKey(deviceId, masterKey, shardMap):
  shards = []
  for shardId in shardMap:
    shard = retrieveShard(shardId)
    shards.append(shard)

  privateKey = ""
  for shard in shards:
    decryptionKey = deriveKey(masterKey, shard.index) // using shard index
    decryptedShard = decrypt(shard, decryptionKey)
    privateKey += decryptedShard

  return privateKey
```

**Considerations:**

*   Network overhead and latency of shard retrieval.
*   Cost of storing shards on a blockchain or DHT.
*   Security of the master symmetric key. HSM integration is critical.
*   Scalability – handling a large number of devices.
*   Robustness against network failures or malicious actors. Implement redundancy and data integrity checks.
