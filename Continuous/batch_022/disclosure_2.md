## Dynamic Focal Stack Rendering

**Concept:** Extend the focal region concept to create a dynamic depth-of-field effect *without* needing multiple cameras or complex depth sensors. The system will analyze video frames, identify moving objects, and dynamically adjust the “focal stack” – the range of pixels considered “in focus” – *per object*. This creates a cinematic depth-of-field effect, but computationally cheaper than traditional methods.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Standard video stream (any resolution/framerate)
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated hardware accelerator or optimized software library.
*   **Object Detection:** Integrate a lightweight, real-time object detection model (YOLOv8 Nano or similar). Prioritize speed over absolute accuracy.
*   **Focal Stack Definition:** Each detected object is assigned a "focal volume" – a 3D region around the object. The size and shape of the volume are configurable parameters.
*   **Pixel Blurring Algorithm:** Utilize a weighted averaging algorithm to selectively blur pixels outside the focal volumes. The weight is inversely proportional to the distance from the focal volume.  Gaussian blur is an acceptable base, but should be customizable.
*   **Temporal Smoothing:** Implement a temporal filter to smooth the transitions between frames, reducing flickering or jittering in the blurred regions.  A simple moving average filter applied to the blur weights is a good starting point.
*   **Output:** Modified video stream with dynamic depth-of-field effect.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each frame in video stream:
    // Object Detection
    objects = detect_objects(frame)

    // Create Focal Stacks
    focal_stacks = []
    FOR each object in objects:
        focal_stack = create_focal_stack(object, config)  // Creates a 3D volume around the object
        focal_stacks.append(focal_stack)

    // Pixel Processing
    modified_frame = copy(frame)
    FOR each pixel in modified_frame:
        blur_weight = 0.0
        FOR each focal_stack in focal_stacks:
            distance = calculate_distance(pixel, focal_stack)
            weight = calculate_blur_weight(distance)
            blur_weight += weight

        // Apply Blur (weighted average of neighboring pixels)
        blurred_pixel = apply_blur(pixel, blur_weight)
        modified_frame[pixel] = blurred_pixel

    //Temporal Smoothing
    smoothed_frame = apply_temporal_smoothing(modified_frame, previous_frame)

    output = smoothed_frame
    previous_frame = modified_frame
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `object_detection_threshold`: Confidence threshold for object detection.
*   `focal_volume_size`:  Dimensions of the focal volume (e.g., a cube with side length X pixels).
*   `blur_radius`: Radius of the blur applied to out-of-focus pixels.
*   `blur_strength`:  Intensity of the blur effect.
*   `temporal_smoothing_factor`: Weight assigned to the previous frame in the temporal filter.
