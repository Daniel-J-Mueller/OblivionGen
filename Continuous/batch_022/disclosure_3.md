## Adaptive Index Sharding with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the asynchronous indexing approach to a sharded index architecture, coupled with a predictive prefetching mechanism based on query history and data access patterns. This moves beyond simply distributing the index workload, towards *anticipating* where index data will be needed *before* a query is even issued.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Management Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for dynamically distributing index shards across available storage nodes.
*   **Algorithm:** Uses a consistent hashing scheme to map data keys to specific shards.  Shards are not fixed; the system monitors shard load and automatically rebalances based on read/write ratios.
*   **Metrics:** Tracks shard size, read latency, write throughput, and error rates.
*   **API:**
    *   `allocate_shard(key_range)`: Assigns a key range to a storage node. Returns node ID.
    *   `rebalance_shards()`: Initiates a shard rebalancing process.
    *   `get_shard_location(key)`: Returns the node ID hosting the shard containing the given key.

**2. Predictive Prefetch Engine:**

*   **Function:** Analyzes query logs and data access patterns to predict which index data will be required in the near future.  Proactively fetches that data into a read-optimized cache tier.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Query History Table:* Stores recent queries, including timestamps, involved keys/ranges, and associated shards.
    *   *Access Pattern Model:*  Utilizes a Markov Chain model to predict future key accesses based on historical sequences.  Supports multiple models for different data types/schemas.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Capture incoming queries and extract relevant key ranges.
    2.  Update Query History Table.
    3.  Update Access Pattern Model based on new query data.
    4.  Predict future key ranges using the Access Pattern Model.
    5.  Issue prefetch requests to the Shard Management Module for predicted key ranges.
*   **API:**
    *   `log_query(query, timestamp)`: Logs a query and its timestamp.
    *   `prefetch_keys(keys)`: Initiates a prefetch request for a list of keys.
    *    `update_model(query_data)`: updates the access pattern model.

**3. Asynchronous Indexing Pipeline (Enhanced):**

*   **Components:**
    *   *Write Queue:*  Receives index update requests.
    *   *Volatile Index Replica:*  Stores a rapidly accessible copy of the index in system memory.  Serves immediate queries.
    *   *Persistent Index Shard:* Stores the durable copy of the index data on persistent storage.  Managed by the Shard Management Module.
    *   *Replication Queue:* Buffers updates before sending them to Persistent Index Shards.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Write request arrives at Write Queue.
    2.  Update is applied to Volatile Index Replica.
    3.  Update is added to Replication Queue.
    4.  Asynchronous process reads updates from Replication Queue.
    5.  Update is written to the appropriate Persistent Index Shard (determined by key).
    6.   Shard Management Module monitors shard health.

**4. Cache Tier:**

*   **Type:**  In-memory cache (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
*   **Function:**  Stores pre-fetched index data for extremely fast access.
*   **Eviction Policy:**  LRU (Least Recently Used) with a priority boost for pre-fetched data.
*    **Integration:** Prefetch Engine populates the cache tier.  Query processor checks cache before accessing Persistent Index Shards.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Engine):**

```
function log_query(query, timestamp):
  store query and timestamp in Query History Table

function update_model(query_data):
  update Access Pattern Model based on query_data

function predict_keys():
  keys = Access Pattern Model.predict_next_keys()
  return keys

function prefetch_keys(keys):
  for key in keys:
    shard_location = Shard Management Module.get_shard_location(key)
    request data from shard_location
    store data in Cache Tier
```

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   **Horizontal Scaling:**  Shard Management Module and Persistent Index Shards can be scaled horizontally.
*   **Replication:**  Replicate Persistent Index Shards for fault tolerance.
*   **Leader Election:** Implement a leader election mechanism for Shard Management Module to ensure a single point of control.
