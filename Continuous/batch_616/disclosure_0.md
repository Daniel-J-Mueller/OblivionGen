## Decentralized Device Identity & Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Augment the device registration/authentication system with a blockchain-based, decentralized identity layer and a dynamic trust scoring system. This moves beyond solely relying on the central server for authentication and introduces a reputation-based security model.

**Specifications:**

**1. Decentralized Identity (DID) Generation:**

*   Upon initial manufacturer registration, a DID is generated for each device. This DID is a unique identifier stored on a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric).
*   The DID includes core device attributes (serial number, MAC address, manufacturer ID) cryptographically signed by the manufacturer.
*   The blockchain acts as a tamper-proof registry for initial device identity.

**2. Dynamic Trust Scoring:**

*   Each device accumulates a trust score based on its behavior and interactions within the system.
*   Trust score factors:
    *   Successful/Failed Authentication Attempts.
    *   Data Integrity Checks (ensuring data hasn't been tampered with).
    *   Resource Usage (detecting anomalous activity indicative of compromise).
    *   Adherence to System Policies (e.g., software update compliance).
    *   User Feedback (flagging suspicious behavior reported by users).
*   Trust score updates are recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and auditable history.

**3. Authentication Protocol Enhancement:**

*   Authentication process involves:
    1.  Device presents its DID.
    2.  System verifies DID on the blockchain.
    3.  System retrieves deviceâ€™s current trust score.
    4.  Authentication is granted based on a combined assessment of DID validity *and* trust score.
*   Thresholds for acceptable trust scores are dynamically adjusted based on the criticality of the requested service or function. Lower trust scores may trigger additional security measures (e.g., multi-factor authentication).

**4. Inter-Device Trust Network:**

*   Devices can establish trust relationships with each other based on shared attributes and interactions.
*   Trust scores can be propagated through the network, allowing devices to indirectly assess the trustworthiness of other devices.
*   This creates a self-regulating security ecosystem where malicious devices are automatically isolated.

**5. Pseudocode:**

```
// Device Authentication Function
function authenticateDevice(deviceID, requestData) {
  // 1. Retrieve DID from blockchain
  DID = getDIDFromBlockchain(deviceID);

  // 2. Verify DID signature
  if (!verifySignature(DID, devicePublicKey)) {
    return false; // Invalid signature
  }

  // 3. Get Trust Score
  trustScore = getTrustScoreFromBlockchain(deviceID);

  // 4. Check Trust Score against Threshold
  threshold = getThresholdForService(requestedService);

  if (trustScore < threshold) {
    // Request MFA or deny access
    triggerMFA(deviceID);
    return false;
  }

  // 5. Verify Request Data (using encryption/signatures)
  if (!verifyRequestData(requestData, devicePublicKey)) {
    return false;
  }

  // 6. Grant Access
  return true;
}

// Trust Score Update Function
function updateTrustScore(deviceID, eventType, weight) {
    currentScore = getTrustScoreFromBlockchain(deviceID)
    newScore = currentScore + weight
    saveTrustScoreToBlockchain(deviceID, newScore)
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Secure Element (SE) or Trusted Platform Module (TPM) within each device for DID storage and cryptographic operations.
*   Blockchain Node Connectivity: Devices need access to a permissioned blockchain network.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Blockchain SDK integration within the device software.
*   Cryptographic Libraries (for signature verification and data encryption).
*   Trust Score Calculation Engine.
*   Secure Boot and Firmware Update Mechanisms.
