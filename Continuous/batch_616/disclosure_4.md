## Dynamic Event Coalescence & Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Extend the event notification system to not just *react* to events, but *predict* potential issues and proactively coalesce related events into a single, actionable notification with pre-emptive failover orchestration. This reduces network chatter, simplifies client-side logic, and improves overall system responsiveness.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Analytics Module (Storage Server Side):**

*   **Data Collection:** Continuously monitor storage server metrics: IOPS, latency, error rates, storage capacity, network bandwidth, CPU utilization.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Employ time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) and machine learning models (e.g., Random Forests, Support Vector Machines) to identify anomalies in collected metrics.  Establish baseline performance profiles for each storage volume/client instance combination.
*   **Failure Prediction:** Train models to predict potential storage failures (disk errors, network outages, performance degradation) based on historical data and real-time metrics. Assign confidence scores to predictions.
*   **Event Correlation:** Identify correlations between seemingly disparate events. For example, a spike in latency *combined* with increasing error rates could indicate a pending disk failure.

**2. Event Coalescence Engine (Storage Server Side):**

*   **Event Queue:** Maintain a queue of incoming event notifications and predicted events.
*   **Time Window:** Define a configurable time window (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds) for event correlation.
*   **Correlation Rules:**  Implement a set of configurable rules to identify related events. These rules can be based on event type, storage volume ID, client instance ID, and predicted events.
*   **Combined Event Creation:** If multiple events are correlated within the defined time window, create a single, combined event notification. This notification will include:
    *   A summary of the correlated events.
    *   The highest severity level of the correlated events.
    *   A unified action recommendation (e.g., “Initiate failover to replica X”).

**3. Proactive Failover Orchestration (Storage Server & Client Side):**

*   **Pre-Failover Checks:**  Before sending a combined event notification, the storage server will perform pre-failover checks on the potential failover target. This includes verifying network connectivity, data consistency, and resource availability.
*   **Pre-emptive Failover Instruction:** If the pre-failover checks pass, the combined event notification will include instructions for the client to *immediately* failover to the designated failover target. The notification will include any necessary credentials or configuration parameters.
*   **Client-Side Failover Handling:** The client software will receive the notification and automatically initiate the failover process without requiring user intervention.
*   **Failback Mechanism:** Implement a mechanism for seamlessly failing back to the primary storage server when it becomes available.

**Pseudocode (Storage Server):**

```
function processEvent(event) {
  addEventToQueue(event)
  correlateEvents()
}

function correlateEvents() {
  for each event in queue {
    if event is correlated with existing events within time window {
      merge events into combined event
      remove original events from queue
    }
  }

  if combined event meets failover threshold {
    performPreFailoverChecks()
    if checks pass {
      sendFailoverNotification(combined event)
    }
  }
}

function sendFailoverNotification(event) {
  sendEventToClient(event)
}
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   `correlationTimeWindow`: Duration to correlate events (e.g., 5s, 10s).
*   `failoverThreshold`: Severity level or combination of events triggering failover.
*   `preFailoverCheckTimeout`: Timeout for pre-failover checks.
*   `mlModelUpdateInterval`: Frequency to retrain machine learning models.
