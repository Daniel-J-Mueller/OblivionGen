## Adaptive Anomaly Contextualization via Generative Temporal Fusion

**Concept:** Expand the multi-modal anomaly detection framework by incorporating a temporal dimension and leveraging generative models to predict ‘expected’ multi-modal feature spaces. Anomalies are then detected not just by static classification, but by deviations from these dynamically generated expectations. This allows for detection of subtle anomalies that wouldn't be apparent in a single snapshot, and better handling of environmental variations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   Multi-modal input: Expand beyond two modalities. Support *n* simultaneous input streams (e.g., visible light, infrared, acoustic, pressure).
*   Temporal Buffering: Each modality maintains a buffer of *t* consecutive frames/samples. *t* is a configurable parameter.
*   Feature Extraction:  Each modality’s buffered data is processed by a dedicated feature extractor (CNN, RNN, etc.) generating a feature vector *f<sub>i</sub>(t)* for modality *i* at time *t*.
*   Feature Synchronization: Implement a synchronization layer to align feature vectors across modalities, accounting for potential timing offsets.

**2. Temporal Fusion & Generative Modeling:**

*   Fusion Module: Concatenate synchronized feature vectors into a single vector *F(t)*.
*   Recurrent Generative Network (RGN): Train an RGN (e.g., LSTM-VAE, GRU-GAN) on sequences of *F(t)*. The RGN learns to predict future feature vectors *F̂(t+1)* given a history of past vectors.
*   Latent Space Mapping: The RGN’s latent space represents a compressed, probabilistic model of ‘normal’ multi-modal behavior over time.

**3. Anomaly Detection:**

*   Prediction Error: Calculate the error between the actual feature vector *F(t+1)* and the predicted vector *F̂(t+1)*.  Use a distance metric like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Cosine Similarity.
*   Anomaly Score: Accumulate prediction error over a sliding window of length *w*.  The anomaly score is the sum (or average) of the errors within the window.
*   Adaptive Thresholding: Implement an adaptive threshold based on the historical distribution of anomaly scores. This allows the system to adjust to changing environmental conditions and reduce false alarms.  Use a statistical control chart (e.g., Shewhart chart, EWMA chart) to dynamically update the threshold.
*   Discrepancy Mapping:  Instead of a single anomaly score, generate a ‘discrepancy map’ indicating which modalities contribute most to the anomaly. This provides valuable diagnostic information.

**4.  System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```python
class AnomalyDetector:
    def __init__(self, num_modalities, buffer_size, rgn_architecture):
        self.num_modalities = num_modalities
        self.buffer_size = buffer_size
        self.rgn = RGN(rgn_architecture) # Recurrent Generative Network
        self.feature_extractors = [FeatureExtractor(i) for i in range(num_modalities)] # Individual feature extractors for each modality
        self.history_buffer = []

    def process_frame(self, frame_data): # frame_data is a list of data from each modality
        # 1. Extract Features:
        extracted_features = [self.feature_extractors[i].extract(frame_data[i]) for i in range(self.num_modalities)]

        # 2. Fuse Features:
        fused_features = concatenate(extracted_features)

        # 3. Update History:
        self.history_buffer.append(fused_features)
        if len(self.history_buffer) > self.buffer_size:
            self.history_buffer.pop(0)

        # 4. Generate Prediction:
        predicted_features = self.rgn.predict(self.history_buffer)

        # 5. Calculate Error:
        error = calculate_error(predicted_features, fused_features)

        # 6. Update Anomaly Score:
        anomaly_score = update_anomaly_score(error)

        # 7. Check Threshold:
        is_anomaly = check_anomaly_threshold(anomaly_score)

        return is_anomaly, anomaly_score

```

**5. Hardware Considerations:**

*   FPGA or GPU acceleration for real-time feature extraction and prediction.
*   Multi-channel data acquisition system to capture data from multiple modalities simultaneously.
*   Edge deployment capabilities to reduce latency and bandwidth requirements.
