## Contextual Voice-Triggered AR Overlays

**Concept:** Extend voice command functionality to trigger and manipulate augmented reality (AR) overlays tied to physical objects detected by a device camera.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Device with camera, microphone, AR display capability (phone, tablet, AR glasses).
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Object Recognition Module:**  Utilizes computer vision (likely a pre-trained model) to identify objects within the camera’s field of view. Output: Object ID, confidence score, bounding box coordinates.
    *   **Voice Command Processor:** Receives audio input, performs speech-to-text conversion, and identifies intent/commands. Integrates with the existing voice trigger framework from patent 10741180.
    *   **AR Overlay Manager:** Responsible for loading, positioning, scaling, and animating AR content.  Content is stored locally or fetched from a remote server.
    *   **Contextual Mapping Database:**  A database linking identified objects to specific AR overlays and associated voice commands.  This allows custom actions to be tied to specific items.
    *   **Command Sequencing Engine:**  Handles complex, multi-step voice commands.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  User activates the system (e.g., by saying a wake word).
    2.  Object Recognition Module identifies objects in the camera view.
    3.  Voice Command Processor listens for user commands.
    4.  If a command is recognized *and* is associated with a detected object, the AR Overlay Manager loads the corresponding AR content.
    5.  The AR content is positioned relative to the detected object, and displayed on the device screen or AR glasses.
    6.  Additional voice commands can be used to manipulate the AR overlay (e.g., rotate, zoom, display information).
*   **Pseudocode (Command Processing):**

```
function processVoiceCommand(audioData):
    commandText = speechToText(audioData)
    detectedObjects = getDetectedObjects()

    if detectedObjects is empty:
        return "No objects detected"

    for object in detectedObjects:
        objectType = object.type
        commandMapping = lookupCommandMapping(objectType, commandText)

        if commandMapping is not null:
            executeAction(commandMapping.action, object)
            return "Command executed"

    return "Command not recognized"
```

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `CommandMapping`:
        *   `objectType`: String (e.g., "coffee mug", "laptop")
        *   `commandText`: String (e.g., "show instructions", "play music")
        *   `action`: Function pointer/identifier to the action to execute.
*   **Example Use Cases:**
    *   Point camera at a coffee mug and say "show instructions" – AR overlay displays brewing instructions.
    *   Point camera at a laptop and say "open documentation" – AR overlay presents a quick link to the laptop’s user manual.
    *   Point camera at a tool and say "show repair guide" - AR overlay displays a step-by-step guide.
*   **Expansion possibilities**:
    *   Integration with e-commerce platforms. Pointing at an object could trigger product information and purchase options.
    *   "Teach" the system new object/command mappings via voice and visual input.
    *   Multi-user AR experiences, where multiple users can interact with the same AR overlay.
