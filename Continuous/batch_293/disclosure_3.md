## Adaptive Projection Mapping with Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate physiological sensors with the automatic projection focusing system to dynamically adjust projected content *and* focus based on user emotional/cognitive state. Instead of purely optimizing for technical sharpness, the system aims to enhance user experience through subtle visual cues linked to their internal state.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) headband – capturing brainwave activity. (Focus: Alpha, Beta, Theta band power for cognitive load/relaxation).
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) sensor – measuring skin conductance for arousal/stress levels.
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) monitor – providing data on autonomic nervous system activity.
    *   Optional: Eye-tracking – to assess attention/gaze direction.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano) to handle sensor data processing, analysis, and control of projection system.
*   **Projection System:** Standard projector capable of automatic focus control (leveraging existing patent tech). High refresh rate preferred.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   Real-time signal processing library (e.g., MNE-Python) for EEG/GSR/HRV data.
    *   Machine Learning models (trained on labeled emotional/cognitive states) to map sensor data to corresponding states (e.g., “focused”, “relaxed”, “stressed”, “bored”).
    *   Content Generation/Adaptation Module:
        *   A library of adaptable visual elements (shapes, colors, textures, animations).
        *   Rules/algorithms that map emotional/cognitive states to specific visual adaptations.
*   **Calibration Protocol:** Initial user-specific calibration session to establish baseline physiological signatures for different emotional/cognitive states.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
calibrateUser() // Establish baseline physiological signatures
loadContentLibrary()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Data Acquisition
  eegData = readEEG()
  gsrData = readGSR()
  hrvData = readHRV()

  // Feature Extraction & Classification
  emotionalState = classifyState(eegData, gsrData, hrvData)

  // Content Adaptation
  adaptedContent = adaptContent(emotionalState, currentContent)

  // Focus Adjustment
  focusParameter = adjustFocus(emotionalState, adaptedContent) // Based on both content *and* state

  // Projection
  projectImage(adaptedContent, focusParameter)

  delay(100ms) // Adjust for refresh rate/processing time
}

// Function: adjustFocus(emotionalState, adaptedContent)
if (emotionalState == "focused") {
    // Sharpen focus – optimize for detail. Higher contrast.
    focusParameter = sharpFocusSetting
} else if (emotionalState == "relaxed") {
    // Slightly softer focus. Warmer colors.
    focusParameter = softFocusSetting
} else if (emotionalState == "stressed") {
    // Very soft focus. Muted colors.  Reduce visual complexity.
    focusParameter = ultraSoftFocusSetting
} else { // Bored/Neutral
    // Introduce subtle movement/animation. Increase contrast.
    focusParameter = dynamicFocusSetting
}
return focusParameter
```

**Novelty:** Current automatic focus systems are purely technical. This system extends that capability to *intentional* visual modification linked to user wellbeing. It's not about achieving perfect image clarity, but about creating an optimal visual experience tailored to the individual’s state. It moves beyond surface optimization to subjective experience optimization.
