## Dynamic Function Synthesis with Multi-Granularity Time Series

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple regression to synthesize continuous functions not just from the immediate time series data, but also leveraging correlated, coarser-grained time series data to improve accuracy and predictive power, particularly for sparse or noisy input.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Ingestion & Correlation:**

*   **Multi-Granularity Input:** Accept time series data at multiple granularities.  Example:  High-frequency sensor readings (1 Hz), daily aggregates, and weekly summaries.
*   **Correlation Engine:**  A module that identifies and quantifies correlations between different granularities of the same time series *and* between entirely different time series. This uses statistical methods (cross-correlation, mutual information) and potentially machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks trained on historical data) to determine the ‘influence’ of coarser-grained or related data on the target high-frequency series.  Correlation is represented as a weighted adjacency matrix.
*   **Metadata Enrichment:** Associate each time series with metadata defining its source, units, expected range, and correlation strength with other series.

**II. Dynamic Function Synthesis:**

*   **Hybrid Function Builder:** The core of the system.  Instead of applying a single regression model, it dynamically constructs a hybrid function composed of:
    *   **Local Regression:** Traditional regression (linear, polynomial, spline) applied to a short window of the high-frequency data.
    *   **Coarse-Grained Correction:**  A weighted sum of interpolated values from the coarser-grained time series, based on the correlation matrix. This acts as a ‘drift correction’ or baseline adjustment.
    *   **Related Series Influence:**  Similar to coarse-grained correction, but uses values from related time series, weighted by their correlation.
*   **Adaptive Windowing:**  Dynamically adjust the window size for local regression based on data density and noise levels.  Sparse data = larger window, noisy data = smaller window.
*   **Function Composition:** Combine the outputs of local regression, coarse-grained correction, and related series influence using a learned weighting scheme. This weighting scheme is trained on historical data and optimized to minimize prediction error. The composition function is: `f(t) = w1(t) * local_regression(t) + w2(t) * coarse_grained_correction(t) + w3(t) * related_series_influence(t)`, where `w1(t) + w2(t) + w3(t) = 1`.

**III. Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Storage:** Optimized time-series database with native support for multi-granularity data and correlation metadata.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Leverage distributed computing frameworks (e.g., Spark, Dask) to perform correlation analysis and function synthesis in parallel.
*   **API:** RESTful API for ingesting data, querying synthesized functions, and managing correlation metadata.

**IV. Pseudocode – Dynamic Function Synthesis:**

```python
def synthesize_function(time, time_series_data, correlation_matrix, conversion_parameters):
    # time: timestamp for which to synthesize the function
    # time_series_data: dictionary of time series at different granularities
    # correlation_matrix: weighted adjacency matrix of time series correlations
    # conversion_parameters: parameters for local regression (e.g., polynomial degree)

    # 1. Load relevant data within a window around 'time'
    high_freq_data = time_series_data['high_freq'][time - window:time]

    # 2. Interpolate coarser-grained data to 'time'
    coarse_grained_data = {}
    for series_name, series_data in time_series_data.items():
        if series_name != 'high_freq':
            coarse_grained_data[series_name] = interpolate(series_data, time)

    # 3. Calculate Local Regression
    local_regression_result = perform_regression(high_freq_data, conversion_parameters)

    # 4. Calculate Coarse-Grained Correction
    coarse_grained_correction = 0
    for series_name, value in coarse_grained_data.items():
        correlation_weight = correlation_matrix[series_name]
        coarse_grained_correction += correlation_weight * value

    # 5. Calculate Related Series Influence (Similar to Coarse-Grained Correction)

    # 6. Calculate Weights (w1, w2, w3) – Using a learned model or heuristic

    # 7. Combine Results
    synthesized_value = w1 * local_regression_result + w2 * coarse_grained_correction + w3 * related_series_influence

    return synthesized_value
```

This approach allows the system to create more accurate and robust continuous functions, especially when dealing with sparse, noisy, or incomplete time series data. It provides a mechanism for incorporating external knowledge and improving predictive power.
