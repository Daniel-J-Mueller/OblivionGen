## Dynamic Usage Model Composition & Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to not only *configure* usage models but to *compose* them dynamically based on real-time consumer behavior and *predict* future needs, proactively offering optimized access tiers.

**Specs:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collection:**  Instrument the Web service access points to capture granular data on consumer usage patterns: frequency of access, data volume consumed, API calls made, time of day, geographical location, device type, and any user-defined tags.  This data stream is anonymized/pseudonymized for privacy.
*   **Usage Profile Creation:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network with LSTM layers) to construct a dynamic "Usage Profile" for each consumer. This profile represents a probabilistic model of their anticipated future usage based on historical data. The profile will consist of:
    *   Expected access frequency (requests/hour)
    *   Expected data volume (MB/hour)
    *   Expected API call mix (vector of API call frequencies)
    *   Time-of-day usage weightings.
*   **Usage Model Component Library:**  Define a library of modular "Usage Model Components". These components represent individual restrictions or pricing parameters. Examples:
    *   `RateLimitComponent`: Limits requests per time window.
    *   `DataVolumeComponent`: Limits data transferred per time window.
    *   `TimeWindowComponent`:  Restricts access to specific times.
    *   `GeographicComponent`: Restricts access from specific locations.
    *   `SubscriptionTierComponent`:  Applies a fixed monthly cost for a certain level of access.
    *   `BurstAllowanceComponent`: Allows a limited number of requests exceeding rate limits.
    *   `PriorityAccessComponent`: Gives preferential access during peak times.
*   **Model Composition Engine:** This is the core of the innovation. The engine uses a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning or a policy gradient method) to *compose* the optimal set of Usage Model Components for each consumer, maximizing a defined reward function. The reward function will balance:
    *   Consumer satisfaction (minimizing access denials/throttling).
    *   Provider revenue (optimizing pricing based on predicted usage).
    *   Resource utilization (preventing overload).

    *Pseudocode:*

    ```
    function ComposeUsageModel(consumerID):
      usageProfile = GetUsageProfile(consumerID)
      candidateComponents = GetAvailableUsageModelComponents()
      qTable = InitializeQTable(candidateComponents)

      for episode in range(numEpisodes):
        state = GetCurrentState(usageProfile)
        action = SelectAction(state, qTable, epsilon) // epsilon-greedy exploration

        applyAction(consumerID, action) // Apply the selected action (e.g., add rate limit)
        reward = CalculateReward(consumerID, action)

        qTable[state][action] = qTable[state][action] + learningRate * (reward + discountFactor * max(qTable[nextState]))
        nextState = GetNextState(consumerID)

      return SelectBestUsageModel(qTable) // Returns the optimal composed usage model
    ```
*   **Proactive Tier Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors actual usage against the predicted profile. If significant deviations occur, the Model Composition Engine re-evaluates the usage model and proactively adjusts the consumer's access tier (e.g., suggesting an upgrade to a higher subscription level or applying more restrictive rate limits).  This is presented to the consumer with clear explanations.
*   **API for External Integration:**  Provide an API allowing third-party applications to integrate with the system, enabling them to dynamically adjust their access to Web services based on real-time usage patterns and pricing. This creates a new market for "usage-aware" applications.
