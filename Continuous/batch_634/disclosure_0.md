## Adaptive Acoustic Mapping & Predictive Remediation

**System Overview:**

The core idea is to expand beyond simple signal strength and connectivity metrics to create a dynamic, localized acoustic map of the environment *as perceived by* the speech-enabled device. This map, combined with predictive analytics, allows the system to proactively identify and mitigate network connectivity issues *before* the user experiences them, or before a voice command fails.

**Components:**

1.  **Acoustic Sensor Array:** Integrate a small microphone array (3-5 mics) into the speech-enabled device. This is beyond standard voice input; it’s for environmental analysis.
2.  **Acoustic Feature Extraction Module:** Software running on the device analyzes the raw audio from the microphone array. Extracts features like:
    *   Reverberation time (indicates room size/absorption).
    *   Noise floor (ambient noise level).
    *   Frequency response (identifies dominant frequencies, potentially revealing interference sources).
    *   Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation - pinpointing sources of sound.
3.  **Localized RF Mapping Module:** Correlate acoustic features with known RF characteristics.  The device 'learns' that certain acoustic environments *typically* correlate with poor Wi-Fi signal. For example:
    *   A small, highly reverberant room with metallic surfaces might indicate significant multi-path interference.
    *   The presence of a specific low-frequency hum (identified through DoA) might indicate nearby electrical interference affecting wireless signals.
4.  **Predictive Analytics Engine (Cloud-Based):**  Aggregates acoustic & RF data from *all* deployed devices.  Builds a global model of environmental factors impacting connectivity.  Predicts potential issues based on learned correlations.  
5.  **Proactive Remediation Engine:**  Based on predictions, the system proactively:
    *   Adjusts audio processing parameters (noise cancellation, beamforming) to optimize voice input.
    *   Initiates a ‘connectivity health check’ – a background scan for available networks and signal strength.
    *   Suggests optimal device placement *before* a voice command is issued ("To ensure the best performance, consider moving the device slightly to the left.").
    *   Automatically switches to a different Wi-Fi band or network if available.

**Data Flow:**

1.  Device continuously captures audio with the microphone array.
2.  Acoustic features are extracted locally.
3.  Acoustic features *and* current Wi-Fi metrics (RSSI, connection state) are periodically sent to the cloud.
4.  Cloud-based engine updates the global model.
5.  Engine sends personalized recommendations/adjustments back to the device.

**Pseudocode (Cloud-Side - Simplified):**

```
function predict_connectivity(device_id, acoustic_features, wifi_metrics):
  // Load latest global model
  model = load_model()

  // Combine acoustic & wifi data
  input_data = combine(acoustic_features, wifi_metrics)

  // Run prediction
  prediction = model.predict(input_data)

  // Determine recommended action
  if prediction.signal_quality < threshold:
    if prediction.interference_source == "microwave":
      recommendation = "Consider moving the device away from microwave ovens."
    else:
      recommendation = "Move device to improve signal."
  elif prediction.packet_loss > threshold:
      recommendation = "Restart your router."
  else:
    recommendation = None  //No Action Needed
  return recommendation
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems primarily rely on *reactive* network diagnostics. This system is *proactive*, anticipating problems based on environmental analysis.  The use of acoustic mapping as a proxy for RF conditions is the key innovation.  It isn’t simply about signal strength; it's about *understanding* the environment and predicting its impact on connectivity.
