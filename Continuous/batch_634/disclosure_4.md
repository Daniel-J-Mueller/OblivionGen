**Innovation Description:**

This system expands upon the concept of vibrometric signatures by integrating focused ultrasound excitation with high-resolution laser vibrometry. Instead of relying on broad-spectrum excitation (like the original patent suggests), this system utilizes focused ultrasonic beams to interrogate specific regions of a material. By scanning the focused beam across the sample, a 2D or 3D map of vibrometric signatures can be generated.

The key innovation is the use of machine learning to analyze these complex vibrometric signatures and identify subtle defects (cracks, voids, delaminations, etc.) that are invisible to conventional inspection methods. 

**Pseudocode for Defect Detection Algorithm:**

```
// Input: Vibrometric signature data (amplitude, frequency, phase) from LDV
// Output: Defect map with defect location and classification

1.  Preprocess LDV data: Noise reduction, outlier removal, data normalization
2.  Feature Extraction: 
    a. Calculate spectral features (peak frequencies, bandwidth, harmonic content)
    b. Calculate spatial features (vibration amplitude distribution, mode shapes)
    c. Calculate temporal features (time-frequency analysis)
3.  Machine Learning Model: Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Support Vector Machine (SVM) on a dataset of known defect signatures.
4.  Defect Detection: Input the extracted features into the trained ML model.
5.  Output: Generate a defect map with defect location (coordinates) and classification (crack, void, delamination, etc.) based on the ML model's output.
6.  Visualization: Display the defect map overlaid on a visual image of the sample.
```

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  Place the sample on the stage.
2.  Define the scanning area and parameters.
3.  The ultrasonic transducer scans the defined area.
4.  The LDV system measures the vibration response at each point.
5.  The data acquisition and processing unit collects and processes the data.
6.  The machine learning algorithm identifies and classifies defects.
7.  The defect map is displayed, providing a visual representation of the sample’s condition.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Non-destructive testing of aerospace components (e.g., composite materials, turbine blades).
*   Quality control of manufactured parts.
*   Material characterization and analysis.
*   Medical diagnostics (e.g., bone fracture detection).
*   Archaeological artifact analysis.
