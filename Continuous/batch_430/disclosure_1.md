## Dynamic Power Allocation & Predictive Charging for Swarm Robotics

**Concept:** Expand beyond individual MDU charging to a system where multiple MDUs *collaboratively* manage power, anticipating needs and transferring energy between units. This is geared toward scenarios with a high density of MDUs operating in close proximity – think automated warehouses or large-scale agricultural harvesting.

**Specifications:**

*   **MDU Hardware Augmentation:**
    *   **Bidirectional Wireless Power Transfer (BWPT) Module:** Each MDU equipped with a high-efficiency BWPT coil (resonant inductive coupling preferred).  Transmit/Receive capability. Power rating: 500W peak, 200W continuous.
    *   **Energy Storage Buffer:**  Supercapacitor bank (5kWh capacity) integrated alongside existing battery systems (lead-acid/lithium-ion). Acts as a rapid charge/discharge buffer and allows for power sharing.
    *   **Proximity/Communication Array:**  Ultra-wideband (UWB) radios for precise location tracking of nearby MDUs.  Mesh network capability for communication of energy status and task predictions.
    *   **Power Management Unit (PMU):** Dedicated microcontroller managing BWPT, supercapacitor charging/discharging, and communication.

*   **Centralized Management System (CMS):**
    *   **Task Prediction Engine:** AI model analyzing historical task data (inventory requests, delivery routes, etc.) to predict future energy demands of each MDU.
    *   **Energy Allocation Algorithm:**  Optimizes energy flow between MDUs based on predicted needs, current energy levels, and proximity. Prioritizes critical tasks.
    *   **Charging Station Integration:**  CMS coordinates with existing charging stations to supplement MDU-to-MDU energy transfer.  Predictive scheduling of charging station visits.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// MDU Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Broadcast Current Status (Energy Level, Task, Location)
    broadcast_status()

    // 2. Receive Status Updates from Nearby MDUs
    receive_status_updates()

    // 3. Request Energy (if needed)
    if (energy_level < threshold) {
        request_energy_from_nearby_mdus()
    }

    // 4. Provide Energy (if available and requested)
    if (energy_level > threshold && energy_request_received()) {
        initiate_bwpt_transfer()
    }

    // 5. Execute Task
    execute_task()

    // 6. CMS Updates
    update_cms_with_status()
}

// CMS Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Collect MDU Status Updates
    collect_mdu_updates()

    // 2. Predict Future Energy Demands
    predict_energy_demands()

    // 3. Optimize Energy Allocation
    optimize_energy_allocation()

    // 4. Schedule Charging Station Visits
    schedule_charging_station_visits()

    // 5. Send Energy Allocation Instructions to MDUs
    send_instructions_to_mdus()
}
```

**Novelty:**

This goes beyond simple opportunistic charging. The predictive aspect and the cooperative energy transfer create a dynamic power grid within the inventory system.  MDUs aren’t just charging when stationary, they are actively *sharing* energy to maximize operational efficiency and potentially reduce the overall charging infrastructure required. It moves beyond individual units and acts as a swarm.
