## Dynamic Query Decomposition & Reconstruction with Federated Learning

**Specification:** A system for intelligently decomposing complex queries into sub-queries, distributing those sub-queries across a federated network of database shards *and* dynamically reconstructing the final result set using a learned model of data relationships.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on routing queries to shards. This design shifts the focus *from* routing to actively *reconstructing* results from distributed data *after* decomposition, optimizing for latency and bandwidth in highly dynamic environments.  It leverages the potential of Federated Learning to adapt to changing data distributions *without* centralizing data.

**System Components:**

1.  **Query Decomposition Engine:**  Analyzes incoming queries (SQL, NoSQL, etc.) and splits them into smaller, independent sub-queries.  Uses a cost-based optimizer considering network latency, shard capacity, and data access patterns. Sub-queries aren't necessarily based on table partitioning, but on logical data segments.
2.  **Federated Learning Coordinator:** Manages the Federated Learning process. Maintains a global model of data relationships (e.g., embeddings, probabilistic graphs) shared across database nodes. 
3.  **Database Nodes (Shards):** Each node stores a portion of the overall dataset. Executes assigned sub-queries, and participates in the Federated Learning process by updating the global model based on its local data.
4.  **Result Reconstruction Module:**  Receives results from the Database Nodes.  Uses the global model (from Federated Learning) to intelligently reconstruct the final result set. This goes beyond simple aggregation - the model can infer missing data, correct inconsistencies, or enhance the result with derived insights.
5.  **Adaptive Query Planner:** Monitors query performance and Federated Learning model updates. Dynamically adjusts the query decomposition strategy, sub-query assignments, and reconstruction process to optimize for changing conditions.

**Pseudocode (Result Reconstruction Module):**

```
FUNCTION reconstruct_result(partial_results[], global_model):

  // Step 1: Data Alignment & Normalization
  aligned_data = align_data(partial_results)  // Align data based on common keys/identifiers

  // Step 2:  Model-Based Inference
  inferred_data = apply_global_model(aligned_data, global_model) // Use the global model to fill in gaps, correct errors, or enhance data.  This may involve:
    // - Imputation of missing values
    // - Anomaly detection and correction
    // - Semantic enrichment

  // Step 3:  Data Fusion & Aggregation
  fused_data = fuse_data(inferred_data) // Combine the enhanced data from different shards

  // Step 4:  Final Result Generation
  final_result = generate_result(fused_data)

  RETURN final_result
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  User submits query.
2.  Query Decomposition Engine splits query into sub-queries.
3.  Adaptive Query Planner assigns sub-queries to Database Nodes.
4.  Database Nodes execute sub-queries and return partial results.
5.  Result Reconstruction Module receives partial results, applies the global model, and reconstructs the final result.
6.  Final result is returned to the user.
7.  Database Nodes participate in Federated Learning, updating the global model based on local data.

**Novelty:**

*   **Active Reconstruction:** Moves beyond simply aggregating results to actively *reconstructing* the final answer, leveraging learned data relationships.
*   **Federated Learning Integration:** Enables continuous adaptation to changing data distributions without requiring data centralization.
*   **Dynamic Decomposition:** Adapts the query decomposition strategy based on real-time performance and model updates.
