## Adaptive Recommendation 'Echo' System

**Concept:** A system that doesn't just diversify *what* is recommended, but diversifies *how* recommendations are presented, adapting the 'voice' or presentation style based on user interaction with filtered items.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `UserPresentationProfile`:  Stores a vector of presentation style weights.  Weights determine the prominence of various presentation attributes (see section 2). Initialized to a neutral state.
*   `ItemPresentationData`:  Each item stores data about how it *should* be presented, including values for each presentation attribute. Can be generated algorithmically (based on item content) or manually curated.
*   `FilteredItemLog`: Logs every item filtered from the recommendation set, including *why* it was filtered (similarity to another item), and the user’s subsequent interaction (if any).

**2. Presentation Attributes (Example – expandable):**

*   `Formality`:  (0-1) –  From casual/colloquial phrasing to formal/technical language.
*   `Specificity`: (0-1) –  From broad descriptions to highly detailed specifications.
*   `EmotionalTone`: (-1 to 1) –  From negative/critical to positive/enthusiastic.
*   `VisualEmphasis`: (0-1) –  Degree of visual prominence (e.g., bolding, color).
*    `NarrativeStyle`: (0-1) – Extent to which a story-like introduction is preferred.

**3. System Flow:**

1.  **Initial Recommendation:** Generate a standard recommendation set as described in the base patent.
2.  **Filtering:**  Apply the similarity-based filtering algorithm. Log all filtered items into the `FilteredItemLog`.
3.  **Presentation Adaptation:**
    *   For each filtered item:
        *   Retrieve the `UserPresentationProfile`.
        *   Generate a 'counterfactual presentation' – how the item *would* have been presented if it *hadn't* been filtered. This presentation is generated using the `UserPresentationProfile` and the item's attributes.
        *   Present a concise 'echo' of the filtered item – a small visual cue (e.g., thumbnail, title) accompanied by the counterfactual presentation.
4.  **User Interaction:**  When the user interacts with the 'echo' (e.g., clicks, hovers):
    *   Update the `UserPresentationProfile`.  If the user shows positive engagement, increase the weight of the attributes used in the counterfactual presentation.  If negative, decrease the weight.
5.  **Iterative Refinement:** Repeat steps 3 and 4 for each subsequent recommendation cycle, progressively tailoring the presentation style to the user's preferences.

**4. Pseudocode (UserPresentationProfile Update):**

```
FUNCTION updatePresentationProfile(userProfile, interactionFeedback, presentationAttributes)
  // interactionFeedback: +1 for positive interaction, -1 for negative
  // presentationAttributes: Vector of attribute values used in the counterfactual presentation

  FOR each attribute IN presentationAttributes:
    userProfile[attribute] = userProfile[attribute] + (interactionFeedback * learningRate)
    // learningRate is a small constant (e.g., 0.01)
    // Ensure weights stay within a reasonable range (e.g., 0-1)
    userProfile[attribute] = constrain(userProfile[attribute], 0, 1)

  RETURN userProfile
END FUNCTION
```

**5.  Hardware Considerations:**

*   A dedicated processor or GPU to handle the real-time generation of counterfactual presentations.
*   Sufficient memory to store user profiles, item data, and presentation templates.

**Novelty:**

This system doesn’t merely diversify *items*; it diversifies *how* those items are presented, adapting to the user's implicit preferences revealed through their interaction with filtered suggestions. It builds on the filtering process itself as an opportunity for refinement, creating a feedback loop that personalizes not just *what* is recommended, but *how* it is communicated.
