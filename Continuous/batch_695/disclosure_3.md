## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Sparse Ray Decomposition & Neural Rendering

**Concept:** Augment ray-based acoustic modeling with sparse ray decomposition and neural rendering to create a dynamic, volumetric representation of an acoustic scene, enabling interactive manipulation and realistic auralization beyond static impulse response data.

**Motivation:** The provided patent focuses on static impulse response estimation. This design aims to move beyond static representations to create a dynamic acoustic scene model, allowing for real-time auralization from arbitrary viewpoints and interactive modification of acoustic properties.

**I. System Specs:**

*   **A. Input:**
    *   Multi-channel microphone array data (as in the patent).
    *   RGB-D video stream (depth data crucial for spatial mapping).
    *   Optional: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for improved pose estimation.
*   **B. Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution microphone array (minimum 8 channels).
    *   Depth sensor (e.g., LiDAR, time-of-flight camera).
    *   Processing unit with GPU acceleration (essential for neural rendering).
    *   Real-time audio output device.
*   **C. Software Modules:**
    *   **1. Sparse Ray Decomposition Module:**
        *   Algorithm:  Employs a modified ray tracing approach, not exhaustive, but selectively tracing rays based on visibility and acoustic significance.  Uses a voxel grid to represent the environment.  Ray density is adaptive â€“ higher in areas with complex geometry or high reflectivity.
        *   Data Structures: Octree for efficient spatial partitioning, Voxel Grid for acoustic property storage (reflection coefficient, scattering coefficient, absorption coefficient).
        *   Output: A sparse set of acoustic rays, each with associated amplitude, direction, and material properties.
    *   **2. Acoustic Property Estimation Module:**
        *   Algorithm: Uses machine learning (Convolutional Neural Network) trained on acoustic material datasets and microphone data to estimate acoustic properties of surfaces.  Uses RGB data as input to identify material types.
        *   Training Data: Large dataset of acoustic materials with corresponding reflectance, scattering, and absorption coefficients.
        *   Output: Material property map for the environment.
    *   **3. Neural Rendering Module:**
        *   Algorithm:  Uses a Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) or similar neural rendering technique to synthesize acoustic data from arbitrary viewpoints. NeRF learns a continuous volumetric representation of the acoustic scene.
        *   Input: Sparse rays, material property map, and user-defined viewpoint.
        *   Process: Ray marching algorithm to integrate acoustic pressure along each ray. Neural network predicts acoustic pressure based on ray properties and material properties.
        *   Output: Synthesized multi-channel audio data.
    *   **4. Interactive Control Module:**
        *   Interface: Allows users to modify acoustic properties of surfaces in real-time (e.g., change absorption coefficient of a wall).
        *   Integration: Modifies material property map and triggers re-rendering of acoustic data.

**II. Data Flow:**

1.  Capture microphone data and RGB-D video stream.
2.  Estimate acoustic properties of surfaces using Acoustic Property Estimation Module.

4.  Feed sparse rays and material property map to Neural Rendering Module.
5.  Synthesize multi-channel audio data based on user-defined viewpoint.
6.  Output synthesized audio data.
7.  Allow user to interactively modify acoustic properties.
8.  Repeat steps 4-7 to update synthesized audio data.
