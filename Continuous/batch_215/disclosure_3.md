## Adaptive Ambiance Projection

**Concept:** Extend user proximity awareness into dynamic environmental adjustments via localized projection mapping. Instead of *just* changing content delivery, actively reshape the physical environment *around* the user based on their presence and identified characteristics.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ultra-short throw projectors (multiple, networked). Aim for high lumen output and keystone correction.
    *   Depth sensors (ToF or structured light) â€“ Integrated into projectors or as separate networked units. Minimum resolution 720p, ideal 1080p+.
    *   Ambient light sensors (integrated into projectors).
    *   Microphone array (integrated into projectors) - for voice activation and sound source localization.
    *   Edge computing unit (integrated or networked) - for real-time processing and instruction generation.
    *   Network connectivity (WiFi 6E or Ethernet).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Proximity Engine:** Receives proximity data (count, specific user ID, type/role) from existing device network (leverages patent's base functionality).
    *   **Environmental Mapping Module:** Creates a dynamic 3D map of the projection space. Uses depth sensors and environmental mapping algorithms.
    *   **Ambiance Profile Library:** Pre-defined or customizable profiles linking proximity data to projection parameters (color palettes, textures, animated effects, localized 'auras').  Profiles can be user-specific, role-based (e.g., 'presenter', 'guest'), or context-aware (e.g., 'movie night', 'focus mode').
    *   **Projection Control System:**  Manages the networked projectors, dynamically adjusting keystone correction, brightness, color, and content based on the Ambiance Profile and Environmental Map.
    *   **AI-Powered Adaptation Engine:** Monitors user response (via camera, microphone, or dedicated sensors) and fine-tunes Ambiance Profiles in real-time.  Can learn user preferences and anticipate desired environmental adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Adaptation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION AdaptEnvironment(proximityData, sensorData, currentProfile)
  // proximityData: user count, user ID, user type
  // sensorData: camera input (facial expression, body language), microphone input (voice tone, volume)
  // currentProfile: active ambiance profile

  // 1. Analyze Sensor Data
  emotion = AnalyzeEmotion(sensorData.camera)
  vocalStress = AnalyzeVocalStress(sensorData.microphone)

  // 2. Adjust Profile Parameters based on Sensor Data & Proximity
  IF emotion == "stressed" AND vocalStress > 0.7 THEN
    currentProfile.colorPalette = "calmingBluesAndGreens"
    currentProfile.animationSpeed = "slow"
    currentProfile.projectionIntensity = "low"
  ELSE IF proximityData.userType == "presenter" THEN
    currentProfile.colorPalette = "professionalGraysAndBlues"
    currentProfile.animationSpeed = "medium"
    currentProfile.projectionIntensity = "medium"
  ELSE IF proximityData.userCount > 2 THEN
    currentProfile.colorPalette = "vibrantAndEnergetic"
    currentProfile.animationSpeed = "fast"
    currentProfile.projectionIntensity = "high"
  END IF

  // 3. Apply Adjusted Profile to Projection System
  ApplyProfile(currentProfile)

  // 4. Log data for future learning
  LogData(proximityData, sensorData, currentProfile)
END FUNCTION
