## Adaptive Notification Haptics & Biofeedback Integration

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond audio-based differentiated alerts to incorporate nuanced haptic feedback *synchronized with user biofeedback* for a richer, more contextually aware notification system.  Instead of simply varying volume or audio tone, the system dynamically adjusts haptic patterns (intensity, frequency, texture) *based on the user’s current physiological state* – stress levels, alertness, activity – to maximize noticeability *without* causing undue disruption.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**  Compatible with a range of wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers, dedicated biosensors) capable of monitoring:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
    *   Skin Conductance (Electrodermal Activity - EDA)
    *   Motion/Activity Level (accelerometer data)
    *   Potentially, EEG (for alertness/cognitive load, future expansion)

2.  **Haptic Actuator Control:**  Support for diverse haptic actuators:
    *   Linear Resonant Actuators (LRAs) for precise vibrations
    *   Eccentric Rotating Mass (ERM) motors for simpler vibrations
    *   Ultrasonic haptics (for mid-air tactile sensations – future expansion)
    *   Actuator placement: wrist-worn devices, phone casing, potentially clothing integration.

3.  **Dynamic Haptic Profile Generation:**
    *   **Baseline Establishment:** Initial calibration phase to establish user's typical physiological ranges.
    *   **Real-time Analysis:** Continuous monitoring of biofeedback data.
    *   **Contextual Mapping:**  Algorithm to map biofeedback data to haptic parameters.
        *   *High Stress/High Activity:* Strong, patterned vibrations (e.g., pulsing rhythm) to cut through distractions.
        *   *Low Stress/Sedentary:* Subtle, complex vibrations (e.g., texture-based patterns) for gentle awareness.
        *   *High Alertness/Cognitive Load:* Short, sharp bursts to indicate urgency.
        *   *Sleep Mode:*  No haptics unless critical alerts are designated.
    *   **Personalization:** User-adjustable sensitivity and pattern preferences.

4.  **Notification Priority & Layering:**
    *   Critical Alerts:  Strongest haptic patterns, potentially overriding user preferences.
    *   Non-Critical Alerts:  Subtler patterns, subject to user filtering.
    *   Layered Haptics: Combine haptic feedback with audio cues for redundancy.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Profile Generation):**

```
function generateHapticProfile(biofeedbackData, notificationPriority):
  // Input: biofeedbackData (HRV, EDA, activity), notificationPriority (Critical, Normal, Low)

  // Normalize biofeedback data to 0-1 range
  normalizedHRV = scale(biofeedbackData.HRV, minHRV, maxHRV, 0, 1)
  normalizedEDA = scale(biofeedbackData.EDA, minEDA, maxEDA, 0, 1)
  normalizedActivity = scale(biofeedbackData.Activity, minActivity, maxActivity, 0, 1)

  // Calculate weighted stress score
  stressScore = (0.5 * (1 - normalizedHRV)) + (0.3 * normalizedEDA) + (0.2 * normalizedActivity)

  // Determine base haptic intensity
  if (notificationPriority == "Critical"):
    baseIntensity = 0.8
  else if (notificationPriority == "Normal"):
    baseIntensity = 0.5
  else:
    baseIntensity = 0.2

  // Adjust intensity based on stress score
  intensity = baseIntensity + (stressScore * 0.3) // Max 0.3 adjustment

  // Select haptic pattern based on context (e.g., pulsing, texture, burst)
  pattern = selectPattern(stressScore) // Function to select based on stress range

  // Generate haptic profile (intensity, pattern, duration)
  hapticProfile = {
    "intensity": clamp(intensity, 0, 1),
    "pattern": pattern,
    "duration": 200 // milliseconds
  }

  return hapticProfile
```

**Future Considerations:**

*   **AI-driven Pattern Learning:** Use machine learning to personalize haptic patterns based on user responses.
*   **Integration with Augmented Reality (AR):**  Synchronize haptic feedback with visual AR cues.
*   **Emotional Recognition:**  Use facial expression analysis (via device camera) to refine haptic profile generation.
*   **Directional Haptics:**  Create the illusion of sound source location using an array of haptic actuators.
