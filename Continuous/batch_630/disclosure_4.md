## Adaptive Query Shaping with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the interruptible resource selection to *proactively* reshape queries *during* execution based on real-time resource availability and predictive modeling, rather than simply reacting to interruptions. This shifts from interruption *handling* to interruption *avoidance* and optimized resource utilization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Query Profile Analyzer:**

*   **Input:** Incoming query, historical query execution data (completion times, resource usage), real-time resource availability (CPU, memory, I/O) for both interruptible and non-interruptible resources.
*   **Process:**
    *   Decompose query into sub-queries/stages (e.g., filtering, aggregation, joins).
    *   Estimate resource needs for each stage.
    *   Identify stages that are:
        *   **Resource Intensive:** High estimated resource needs.
        *   **Interruptible:** Can tolerate minor delays or be re-executed.
        *   **Critical Path:** Directly impact overall query completion time.
*   **Output:** Detailed query profile with stage-level resource estimates and criticality flags.

**2. Predictive Resource Model:**

*   **Data Sources:** Historical resource usage data, scheduled maintenance windows, known workload patterns, predictive models for resource contention.
*   **Model Type:**  Time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) combined with machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest) to predict resource availability over the expected query execution duration.  Separate models for interruptible and non-interruptible resources.
*   **Output:** Probabilistic forecast of resource availability for each resource type, including confidence intervals.

**3. Dynamic Query Reshaper:**

*   **Input:** Query profile, resource forecast, current resource availability.
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on resource forecast and availability, dynamically adjust query execution plan:
        *   **Stage Reordering:** Prioritize execution of non-critical stages on interruptible resources when availability is high.
        *   **Resource Allocation:**  Allocate more resources to critical stages, potentially utilizing non-interruptible resources even if more expensive.
        *   **Query Partitioning:**  Break down resource-intensive stages into smaller, parallel tasks that can be executed across multiple resources.
        *   **Algorithm Selection:** Swap in alternative query algorithms based on resource availability (e.g., hash join vs. merge join).
        *   **Data Skew Mitigation:** Dynamically adjust data partitioning strategies to distribute workload evenly across resources.
*   **Output:** Modified query execution plan optimized for current and predicted resource conditions.

**4. Adaptive Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**

*   Monitor query execution performance in real-time.
*   Collect data on resource usage, completion times, and interruption rates.
*   Feed this data back into the Predictive Resource Model to refine its forecasts and improve accuracy.
*   Implement A/B testing of different query reshaping strategies to identify optimal configurations.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Query Reshaper):**

```
function reshapeQuery(queryProfile, resourceForecast):
  modifiedQueryPlan = queryProfile.plan
  for each stage in modifiedQueryPlan:
    if stage.criticality == TRUE:
      allocateResources(stage, resourceForecast.nonInterruptible)
    else:
      if resourceForecast.interruptible.availability > threshold:
        executeOnInterruptible(stage)
      else:
        // Option: Delay execution or attempt to redistribute load
        delayExecution(stage)

  return modifiedQueryPlan
```

**Innovation Focus:**  Moves beyond *reacting* to interruptions to *proactively anticipating* resource constraints and dynamically adapting queries to minimize disruption and maximize resource utilization. This is a shift from reactive fault tolerance to proactive resource orchestration.
