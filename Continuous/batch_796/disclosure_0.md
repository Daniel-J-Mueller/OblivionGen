## Dynamic Communication Spaces – “Ambient Presence”

**Concept:** Extend the idea of joining a communication session beyond simply adding another audio/video stream. Create dynamically generated “ambient presence” spaces that blend real-time communication with contextual data and simulated environmental elements for a more immersive experience.

**Core Idea:** The patent focuses on *who* joins a communication. This expands that to *where* the communication happens, building a shared, contextual space.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensory Input Module:**
    *   Microphone array (multi-directional, noise cancellation).
    *   High-resolution camera (RGB-D for depth sensing).
    *   Environmental sensors: Temperature, humidity, ambient light, air quality.
    *   Device orientation/motion sensors (IMU).
*   **Contextual Data Integration:**
    *   Location services (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation).
    *   Calendar integration (meeting purpose, attendees).
    *   Smart home/IoT integration (lighting, temperature control, device status).
    *   Public data feeds (weather, traffic, news).
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:**
    *   HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) processing for 3D audio rendering.
    *   Dynamic reverb and echo modeling based on virtual environment.
*   **Virtual Environment Renderer:**
    *   Real-time 3D graphics engine (e.g., Unreal Engine, Unity).
    *   Procedural generation of virtual spaces (rooms, landscapes, abstract environments).
    *   Support for mixed reality (MR) and augmented reality (AR) overlays.
*   **AI-Powered Environment Director:**
    *   Machine learning model trained on user preferences and contextual data.
    *   Dynamically adjusts the virtual environment to create a desired mood or atmosphere.
    *   Provides automated scene suggestions and environmental controls.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Session Initiation:** A communication session is started (voice, video, text). The system detects the initiating user's location and environmental conditions.
2.  **Ambient Space Creation:** The AI Environment Director generates a virtual space based on:
    *   Meeting purpose (e.g., a boardroom for a formal meeting, a beach for a casual chat).
    *   Attendee preferences (e.g., preferred colors, lighting, music).
    *   Real-time environmental data (e.g., current weather, time of day).
3.  **Spatial Mapping & Audio Rendering:** The system maps the physical space of each participant (using camera and microphone data) and renders the audio in 3D, creating a sense of spatial presence.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The AI Director continuously monitors the session and adjusts the environment based on user interactions, emotional cues (analyzed via audio/video), and contextual changes.
5.  **Cross-Reality Integration:** Participants can choose to experience the session in different ways:
    *   Fully immersive VR.
    *   Augmented reality overlays on their physical environment.
    *   Traditional 2D video/audio.

**Pseudocode (AI Director Core Logic):**

```
function adjust_environment(session_data, user_interactions, contextual_data):
  mood = analyze_audio_video(session_data)

  if mood == "stressed":
    lighting = "calming blue"
    ambient_sound = "nature sounds"
    virtual_environment = "serene forest"
  elif mood == "energetic":
    lighting = "bright white"
    ambient_sound = "upbeat music"
    virtual_environment = "modern cityscape"
  else:
    // Default settings based on session type and user preferences

  if contextual_data.weather == "rainy":
    virtual_environment = "cozy cabin"
    ambient_sound = "rain sounds"

  // Apply changes to virtual environment rendering engine
  render_engine.set_lighting(lighting)
  render_engine.set_ambient_sound(ambient_sound)
  render_engine.set_virtual_environment(virtual_environment)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Remote meetings with increased engagement and presence.
*   Virtual team building activities.
*   Immersive learning experiences.
*   Therapeutic interventions (e.g., virtual reality exposure therapy).
*   Enhanced gaming and entertainment.
