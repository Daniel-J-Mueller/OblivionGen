**Dynamic Condition-Based Marketplace & Automated Valuation**

**Core Concept:** Expand the pre-order/marketplace matching beyond simple price/condition matching to incorporate *automated, granular condition assessment* leveraging user-submitted media (images, video) and potentially integrated sensor data (if applicable to the product category). This enables a dynamic marketplace where condition dictates price *in real-time* and allows for the creation of highly specialized pre-orders.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Condition Profile Creation:**
    *   Each product category will have a defined “Condition Profile” outlining key assessment criteria (e.g., for electronics: screen quality, battery health, physical damage; for clothing: stains, tears, fading).
    *   Condition Profiles will define a tiered scale (e.g., "Excellent," "Good," "Fair," "Poor") with associated point values for each criterion.  Points are assigned by the seller during listing creation.
2.  **Automated Condition Assessment (ACA) Module:**
    *   **Image/Video Analysis:**  Utilize computer vision models to analyze uploaded media, identifying defects (scratches, dents, stains).  The ACA module provides a preliminary condition score.
    *   **Sensor Integration (Optional):** For certain product categories (e.g., smartphones, laptops), integrate with device APIs (with user permission) to assess battery health, storage capacity, and other relevant metrics.
    *   **Peer Review/Validation (Gamified):** Implement a system where users can validate (or dispute) ACA assessments, earning rewards for accurate contributions. This helps improve the accuracy of the system over time.  Disputes trigger manual review.
3.  **Dynamic Pricing Engine:**
    *   **Base Price Lookup:**  Retrieve a base price for the product based on its make, model, and age.
    *   **Condition Adjustment:**  Apply a price adjustment factor based on the ACA-determined condition score. The adjustment factor will be defined within the Condition Profile for each product category. (e.g., "Excellent" = +20%, "Good" = +5%, "Fair" = -10%, "Poor" = -30%).
    *   **Real-time Updates:**  The dynamic pricing engine should update prices in real-time based on changes in condition assessment or market demand.
4.  **Pre-Order Refinement:**
    *   **Granular Condition Requirements:**  Allow pre-order buyers to specify *precise* condition requirements beyond simple tiered scales. (e.g., "Screen must have no more than 2 dead pixels," "Battery health must be above 80%").
    *   **Automated Matching:** The system should automatically match pre-orders with marketplace listings that meet the specified condition requirements.
5.  **Seller Tools:**
    *   **Guided Condition Assessment:**  Provide sellers with a step-by-step guide to assess the condition of their products, ensuring consistency and accuracy.
    *   **Image/Video Capture Assistance:** Offer tools to help sellers capture high-quality images and videos that showcase the condition of their products.
    *   **Listing Optimization Suggestions:** Provide suggestions to optimize listings based on ACA results and market demand.

**Pseudocode (Matching Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION MatchPreOrder(preOrder, marketplaceListing)
  // preOrder:  Object containing pre-order details (condition requirements, max price)
  // marketplaceListing: Object containing listing details (condition assessment, price)

  conditionScorePreOrder = CalculateConditionScore(preOrder.conditionRequirements)
  conditionScoreListing = CalculateConditionScore(marketplaceListing.conditionAssessment)

  conditionMatch = CompareConditionScores(conditionScorePreOrder, conditionScoreListing)

  IF conditionMatch AND marketplaceListing.price <= preOrder.maxPrice THEN
    RETURN TRUE
  ELSE
    RETURN FALSE
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateConditionScore(conditionDetails)
  // Assigns a numerical score based on the provided condition details
  // (This function would be specific to each product category)
  // Returns a numerical score representing the overall condition
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CompareConditionScores(score1, score2)
  // Compares two condition scores and determines if they meet the
  // pre-order requirements.
  // Returns TRUE if the listing meets the condition requirements, FALSE otherwise
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Refurbished Electronics:**  Allows buyers to pre-order refurbished devices with specific performance guarantees.
*   **Collectible Items:** Enables buyers to pre-order collectible items with specified condition grades.
*   **Used Clothing/Accessories:** Facilitates the purchase of pre-owned items with guaranteed quality.
