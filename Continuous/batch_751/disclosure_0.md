## Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction for Anchoring

**Concept:** The patent focuses on distance metrics in a feature space. Instead of a fixed dimensional space for comparing anchor instances, we dynamically reduce dimensionality *specifically for each anchor*. This enhances discrimination by emphasizing the features most relevant to that *particular* anchor.

**Specs:**

1.  **Anchor-Specific Feature Selection:**
    *   For a given anchor instance, calculate the variance of the output values of all instances within the *same* category as the anchor.
    *   Rank features (dimensions of the output value) by this variance.
    *   Select the top *k* features (adjustable parameter). This creates a reduced feature space specific to the anchor’s category.

2.  **Projection Layer:**
    *   Train a small, dedicated projection layer *for each category*. This layer transforms the original output space into the selected *k*-dimensional space. The projection layer’s weights are learned during the training process.
    *   Input: Original output vector for a given instance.
    *   Output:  *k*-dimensional projected vector.

3.  **Distance Calculation in Reduced Space:**
    *   All distance calculations (between anchor and other instances) are performed in the *k*-dimensional projected space, not the original output space.
    *   Utilize a distance metric appropriate for the data (Euclidean, Manhattan, etc.).

4.  **Loss Function Integration:**
    *   Incorporate a regularization term into the loss function that penalizes the complexity of the projection layers. This encourages learning parsimonious projections.  (e.g. L1 regularization on projection layer weights).

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# During Training:

for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for anchor_image in input_images:
        category = anchor_image.category
        # Calculate feature variances within category
        feature_variances = calculate_feature_variances(category)
        # Select top k features
        selected_features = select_top_k_features(feature_variances, k)

        # Get projection layer for the category
        projection_layer = get_projection_layer(category)

        # Propagate anchor through network
        anchor_output = network.propagate(anchor_output)

        # Project anchor output
        projected_anchor = projection_layer.forward(anchor_output)

        # For each other image:
        for other_image in input_images:
            # Propagate through network
            other_output = network.propagate(other_output)

            # Project output
            projected_other = projection_layer.forward(other_output)

            # Calculate distance in projected space
            distance = calculate_distance(projected_anchor, projected_other)

            # Calculate TPR and loss (as in original patent)
            tpr, loss = calculate_tpr_loss(distance, ...)

            # Update network parameters
            optimizer.step(loss)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires storage to maintain projection layers for each category. (relatively minimal).
*   Adds a small computational overhead during both training and inference due to the projection layers.
*   Easily implemented in existing deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
