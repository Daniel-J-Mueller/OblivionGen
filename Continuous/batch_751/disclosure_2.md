## Dynamic Query Expansion via User-Specific Knowledge Graphs

**Concept:** Leverage user-specific knowledge graphs to dynamically expand semantically-related search queries *before* they are fed to the machine learning model for generating the final query. This moves the "semantic understanding" closer to the user and allows for more nuanced, personalized search results.

**Specs:**

**1. Knowledge Graph Construction:**

*   **Data Sources:** Aggregate data from:
    *   User search history (weighted by recency and frequency).
    *   User profile information (explicitly provided and inferred).
    *   User-created content (notes, lists, documents â€“ with user permission).
    *   Social connections (with user permission and privacy controls).
*   **Graph Structure:**  Nodes represent entities (concepts, items, people, places).  Edges represent relationships between entities (e.g., "is a," "part of," "related to," "used for").  Edge weights indicate the strength of the relationship (derived from data sources).
*   **Real-time Updates:**  Knowledge graph is dynamically updated with each user interaction.

**2. Query Processing:**

*   **Initial Query Analysis:** Parse the initial search query into its core concepts.
*   **Knowledge Graph Traversal:**  Starting from the core concepts, traverse the user's knowledge graph to identify related entities and concepts.  Limit the traversal depth to avoid excessive expansion.
*   **Expansion Weighting:** Assign weights to expanded concepts based on:
    *   Distance from the initial concepts in the knowledge graph.
    *   Edge weights of the traversed paths.
    *   User-defined preferences (e.g., prioritize certain types of relationships).
*   **Query Formulation:** Combine the initial concepts and expanded concepts into a weighted query.  Higher-weighted concepts are considered more important.

**3. Integration with ML Model:**

*   **Input to Model:**  The weighted query (from step 2) is passed as input to the existing machine learning model. The model generates the semantically-related search query *based on this expanded context*.
*   **Model Adaptation:**  Potentially retrain the ML model using a dataset enriched with user-specific knowledge graph data. This could improve the model's ability to generate relevant queries for diverse user contexts.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function expand_query(user_id, initial_query):
  // 1. Load user's knowledge graph
  knowledge_graph = load_knowledge_graph(user_id)

  // 2. Parse initial query into concepts
  concepts = parse_query(initial_query)

  // 3. Traverse knowledge graph starting from concepts
  expanded_concepts = traverse_knowledge_graph(knowledge_graph, concepts, max_depth=3)

  // 4. Assign weights to expanded concepts
  weighted_concepts = assign_weights(expanded_concepts)

  // 5. Combine weighted concepts with original concepts
  final_query = combine_queries(original_concepts, weighted_concepts)

  return final_query

function traverse_knowledge_graph(knowledge_graph, start_concepts, max_depth):
  queue = [(concept, 0) for concept in start_concepts]  // (node, depth)
  visited = set(start_concepts)
  expanded_concepts = set(start_concepts)

  while queue:
    node, depth = queue.pop(0)

    if depth < max_depth:
      for neighbor in knowledge_graph.neighbors(node):
        if neighbor not in visited:
          expanded_concepts.add(neighbor)
          visited.add(neighbor)
          queue.append((neighbor, depth + 1))

  return expanded_concepts

```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Search Relevance:** Queries are tailored to the user's specific interests and knowledge.
*   **Discovery of Unexpected Results:** Expansion can uncover relevant information that the user might not have explicitly searched for.
*   **Personalized Search Experience:**  Search results become more meaningful and engaging for each individual user.
*   **Contextual Understanding:** Accounts for the user's current context and long-term interests.
