## Modular Electronic Device with Bio-Integrated Sensing

**Concept:** An electronic device featuring a core module and swappable, bio-integrated sensor modules that attach magnetically. The core module handles processing, power, and connectivity. The sensor modules collect physiological data (heart rate, skin conductivity, temperature, muscle activity, brain activity - EEG) *without* direct skin contact – data is collected *through* clothing or via near-field sensing.

**Core Module Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions:** 60mm x 30mm x 8mm (roughly credit card sized, slightly thicker)
*   **Materials:** Lightweight aluminum alloy casing with a matte finish.
*   **Processor:** Quad-core ARM Cortex-A55 processor.
*   **Memory:** 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, 64GB eMMC storage.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth 5.2, Wi-Fi 6, NFC.
*   **Power:** 500mAh Li-Po battery, USB-C charging.
*   **Magnetic Interface:** Array of neodymium magnets, polarized for secure attachment of sensor modules.  Magnet strength calibrated to prevent accidental detachment, but allow easy swapping.
*   **LED Indicators:**  RGB LED for status indication (power, charging, connectivity, data transmission).

**Sensor Module Specifications (example – EEG module):**

*   **Dimensions:** 40mm x 20mm x 5mm (small and discreet)
*   **Housing:** Flexible, biocompatible polymer. Designed to be worn *under* clothing.
*   **Sensor Type:** Dry EEG sensors utilizing capacitive coupling.  No conductive gel required. Multiple electrode sites (8-16) arrayed on the underside.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Integrated low-noise amplifiers with analog-to-digital converters (24-bit resolution).
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication with core module via short-range radio frequency (proprietary protocol for minimizing interference).
*   **Power:** Powered wirelessly by core module through inductive coupling.
*   **Mounting:** Strong neodymium magnet embedded in the housing for secure attachment to the core module.  The magnet should be recessed to allow the module to lie flat when placed under clothing.

**Pseudocode (Data Flow):**

```
// Core Module
Initialize Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC
Initialize Magnetic Sensor Detection

Loop:
    Check for new Sensor Modules attached magnetically
    If new Sensor Module detected:
        Establish communication link with Sensor Module
        Request Sensor Module type
        Configure data acquisition based on Sensor Module type

    Receive data from attached Sensor Modules
    Process data (filtering, noise reduction)
    Store data locally or transmit via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi
    Update LED indicators based on status

//Sensor Module
Initialize sensors
Loop:
    Acquire sensor data
    Transmit data to core module
```

**Further Modules (potential expansion):**

*   **Muscle Activity (EMG):** For activity tracking and gesture recognition.
*   **Skin Conductance:** For stress level monitoring.
*   **Temperature:** For tracking body temperature variations.
*   **Heart Rate Variability (HRV):** For stress and recovery analysis.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Air quality, UV index.
