## Acoustic Environment Mapping with Temporal Gating

**Concept:** Leverage the time-delay neural network (TDNN) principles described in the patent, but extend it to create a dynamic acoustic environment map. Instead of solely focusing on trigger detection, map the *characteristics* of the soundscape itself, building a probabilistic representation of sound sources and their locations over time.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Minimum of 4 microphones, spatially distributed. Ideally, incorporate beamforming capabilities within each microphone unit.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuous audio stream from all microphones, sampled at 44.1kHz or higher.
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   **Beamforming:** Apply delay-and-sum beamforming to enhance signals from specific directions. Initial beam directions will be a grid pattern, covering 360 degrees horizontally and 90 degrees vertically.
    *   **Spectral Analysis:** Compute Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) for each beamformed signal, yielding a time-frequency representation.
*   **TDNN Architecture:**
    *   **Input Layer:** Accepts a sequence of STFT magnitude spectra from each beamformed signal.
    *   **Temporal Context Layers:** Multiple TDNN layers to capture temporal dependencies in the spectral features. Layer sizes should progressively decrease to reduce dimensionality. Utilize subsampling within the TDNN to capture long-range temporal patterns.
    *   **Spatial Mapping Layer:** A fully connected layer that maps the TDNN output to a 2D (or 3D) grid representing the acoustic environment. The grid cells represent the probability of a sound source being located at that position. The grid should be configurable in size (e.g., 10x10, 20x20 cells).
    *   **Output Layer:** Output a probability map indicating the locations of sound sources. This will be represented as a grid of probabilities, where each cell represents the likelihood of a sound source being present at that location.
*   **Training Data:** Large dataset of audio recordings with corresponding ground truth sound source locations (e.g., captured in controlled environments or using motion capture technology).
*   **Training Procedure:** Train the TDNN using a supervised learning approach. The loss function should be designed to minimize the difference between the predicted probability map and the ground truth sound source locations. Cross-entropy loss or mean squared error could be used.
*   **Temporal Gating Mechanism:**
    *   Introduce a "gating network" that modulates the output of the TDNN based on the current acoustic context. The gating network analyzes the acoustic features and determines which areas of the probability map should be emphasized or suppressed.
    *   The gating network could be implemented as a recurrent neural network (RNN) or a transformer network.
    *   The output of the gating network is used to scale the probability map, effectively highlighting the areas that are most relevant to the current acoustic context.
*   **Real-Time Operation:** Optimize the TDNN architecture and implementation for real-time operation. This may involve using model quantization, pruning, and other techniques to reduce computational complexity.
*   **Visualization:** Provide a visualization interface that displays the probability map in real-time. The interface should allow the user to pan and zoom the map, and to adjust the visualization parameters.

**Pseudocode (Core TDNN Processing):**

```
// Input: Audio data from microphone array (STFT magnitude spectra)
// Output: Probability map of sound source locations

// Preprocessing: Beamforming + STFT

for each time step t:
  // TDNN Layers
  x_t = TDNN_Layer_1(beamformed_spectra_t)
  x_t = TDNN_Layer_2(x_t)
  // ... more TDNN layers ...
  feature_vector_t = TDNN_Layer_N(x_t)

  // Spatial Mapping Layer
  probability_map_t = Spatial_Mapping_Layer(feature_vector_t)

  // Gating Network
  gate_value = Gating_Network(feature_vector_t)

  // Apply gate value to probability map
  final_probability_map_t = probability_map_t * gate_value

  // Accumulate probability maps over time (optional - can use a moving average)
```

**Innovation:** This expands the trigger *detection* framework into a dynamic *mapping* system. The gating network allows the system to focus on areas of interest, dynamically adapting to the acoustic environment. It's no longer about just finding *if* a trigger exists, but *where* sounds are coming from, and how the soundscape is evolving over time. Potential applications include autonomous navigation, security surveillance, and environmental monitoring.
