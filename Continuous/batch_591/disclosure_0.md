## Dynamic Data Sharding Based on Predictive Query Patterns

**Concept:** Proactively shard database data across compute nodes *before* idle periods, based on predicted query patterns, and then use those idle periods for localized data consolidation/rebalancing. This differs from standard sharding which is typically static or reactive to load.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Predictive Sharding Engine (PSE) - Runs as a service alongside the Leader Node.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Historical Query Logs (from Proxy Service) – Timestamped query types, involved tables, filtered columns.
    *   Database Schema – Table definitions, data types, indexes.
    *   Real-time Query Stream (from Proxy Service) –  Monitoring current queries for immediate pattern detection.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:**
    *   Time-Series Analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future query volumes for each table.
    *   Association Rule Mining (e.g., Apriori) to identify tables frequently accessed together in queries.
    *   Machine Learning Model (trained on historical data) to predict future query patterns (table access frequency, join patterns, filter criteria).  Output: Probability distribution of future queries.
*   **Sharding Strategy:**
    *   Based on prediction output, dynamically assign tables or table partitions to compute nodes.
    *   Prioritize co-location of frequently joined tables on the same node.
    *   Account for data size and node capacity.
*   **Idle Period Integration:**
    *   During detected idle periods, the Leader Node initiates localized data consolidation/rebalancing operations.
    *   Data is moved between nodes to optimize the sharding strategy.
    *   Vacuum operations are performed on nodes *before* data movement to reduce transfer size.
*   **Conflict Resolution:**
    *   Version control system for data shards.
    *   Conflict detection and resolution algorithms to handle concurrent updates during rebalancing.
*   **API:**
    *   `predict_query_pattern(timestamp, table_list)` – Returns predicted query volume and access patterns.
    *   `suggest_sharding_strategy(query_predictions, database_schema)` – Returns a recommended sharding strategy.
    *   `rebalance_data(sharding_strategy)` – Initiates data rebalancing operations.

**Pseudocode (Leader Node – Idle Period Handler):**

```
function handle_idle_period():
  sharding_strategy = PSE.suggest_sharding_strategy(current_query_predictions, database_schema)
  if sharding_strategy is different than current_strategy:
    log("New Sharding Strategy Detected")
    PSE.rebalance_data(sharding_strategy)
    current_strategy = sharding_strategy
  else:
    log("No Sharding Change Needed")
  perform_vacuum_operations() //Reduce transfer size
  log("Idle Period Completed")
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on reactive or static sharding. This system *predicts* future query needs and proactively adjusts the data layout *before* resources are needed, leveraging idle time for optimization. This minimizes latency and maximizes throughput.
