## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Classification with Confidence-Weighted Temporal Smoothing

**Concept:** Extend the false rejection rate estimation to *classify* entire acoustic scenes (e.g., "busy street," "quiet office," "restaurant") and leverage temporal smoothing to improve classification accuracy in noisy environments. This builds upon the confidence score analysis but shifts the application from keyword spotting to broader environmental understanding.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Acoustic Feature Extraction Module:** Processes incoming audio, extracting relevant features (MFCCs, spectrograms, etc.).
*   **Scene Classification Model:** A pre-trained deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, Transformer) capable of classifying audio into predefined acoustic scenes.  Initial training dataset must cover target acoustic environments.
*   **Confidence Score Generator:** Outputs a confidence score (0-1) for each scene classification prediction.
*   **False Rejection Rate (FRR) Estimator:** Based on the existing patent's principles, this module estimates the FRR for each acoustic scene classification.  Crucially, FRR is calculated *per scene*.
*   **Temporal Smoothing Filter:**  A weighted moving average filter that smooths the confidence scores *over time*.  The weighting is *dynamically adjusted* based on the estimated FRR for the currently predicted scene.  Higher FRR = heavier smoothing.
*   **Scene Decision Module:** Uses the smoothed confidence scores to determine the most likely acoustic scene.

**II. Algorithm â€“ Dynamic Temporal Smoothing:**

```pseudocode
// Input: Stream of audio samples, pre-trained Scene Classification Model, FRR Estimator

Initialize:
    smoothed_confidence_scores = []
    previous_scene = None

For each audio sample:
    // 1. Scene Classification
    scene, confidence = Scene Classification Model(audio sample)

    // 2. FRR Estimation
    frr = FRR Estimator(scene)

    // 3. Dynamic Smoothing Weight
    smoothing_weight = 1 - frr // Higher FRR = lower weight (more smoothing)
    smoothing_weight = constrain(smoothing_weight, 0.1, 0.9) // Limit weight to reasonable range

    // 4. Temporal Smoothing
    if smoothed_confidence_scores is empty:
        smoothed_confidence = confidence // First sample, no smoothing
    else:
        smoothed_confidence = (smoothing_weight * confidence) + ((1 - smoothing_weight) * smoothed_confidence)

    // 5. Scene Decision
    if smoothed_confidence > threshold: // Dynamically adjusted threshold
        current_scene = scene
    else:
        current_scene = previous_scene // Maintain previous scene if confidence is low

    previous_scene = current_scene

    Output: current_scene
```

**III.  Data Requirements & Training:**

*   **Extensive Acoustic Scene Dataset:** A large, labeled dataset of audio recordings representing various acoustic environments is required.
*   **FRR Estimation Training:**  Gather data *specifically* for FRR estimation.  This involves manually labeling audio samples with ground truth scene labels and calculating the FRR for each scene based on model predictions.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Calibration:** Implement a mechanism to calibrate the confidence score threshold based on the desired level of accuracy and the specific application.

**IV.  Potential Applications:**

*   **Smart Home Automation:** Adapt home automation routines based on the detected acoustic scene (e.g., automatically adjust lighting and temperature based on whether the home is "quiet" or "busy").
*   **Wearable Devices:**  Provide context-aware information and services based on the user's surrounding acoustic environment.
*   **Security Systems:**  Detect unusual acoustic events based on the expected acoustic scene.
*   **Improved Speech Recognition:** Enhance speech recognition accuracy by filtering out noise and distractions based on the detected acoustic scene.
