## Adaptive Compatibility ‘Shadowing’

**Concept:** Extend the compatibility testing framework to proactively ‘shadow’ user interactions with applications in a production environment, creating a dynamic, real-world compatibility dataset. This moves beyond pre-release testing to capture edge cases and user-specific issues that are impossible to predict.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadowing Agent:** A lightweight agent installed on user devices (with explicit consent and privacy controls). This agent doesn’t interfere with application operation but passively records key events:
    *   Application launch/termination
    *   UI element interactions (clicks, scrolls, input)
    *   System resource usage (CPU, memory, battery)
    *   Network requests/responses (excluding sensitive data)
    *   Crash reports/error logs

2.  **Event Stream:** The shadowing agent streams event data to a central collection service.  Data is anonymized/pseudonymized to protect user privacy. Prioritization of event transmission is needed; critical events (crashes, errors) are prioritized over less-critical UI interactions.

3.  **Replay Engine:**  A server-side replay engine can recreate user sessions based on the recorded event data.  This allows for:
    *   **Automated Regression Testing:** Replay sessions on different configurations (OS, devices, SDKs) to identify compatibility breaks.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:** Step-by-step replay to pinpoint the exact sequence of events leading to an issue.
    *   **Predictive Compatibility:**  Train machine learning models to predict compatibility issues based on replay data.

4.  **Compatibility Score:** Assign each application a ‘Compatibility Score’ based on the frequency and severity of issues detected through shadowing. Display this score prominently in the application catalog.

5.  **Dynamic Test Generation:** The replay engine can automatically generate new test scripts based on recorded user sessions. These scripts can then be used for automated testing, expanding the testing coverage beyond predefined test cases.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Test Generation):**

```
function generateTestScript(eventStream):
  testScript = new TestScript()
  for event in eventStream:
    if event.type == "UI_INTERACTION":
      testScript.addStep(action: event.action, target: event.target)
    elif event.type == "SYSTEM_EVENT":
      testScript.addCheck(condition: event.condition, expectedValue: event.value)
  return testScript
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard user devices (PCs, smartphones, tablets).
*   Scalable server infrastructure for event collection, storage, and replay.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Lightweight shadowing agent for user devices.
*   Event collection and processing pipeline.
*   Replay engine with automated test generation capabilities.
*   Machine learning framework for predictive compatibility.
*   Secure data storage and anonymization mechanisms.
