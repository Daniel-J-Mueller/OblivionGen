## Dynamic Focus & Semantic Zoom for Image Collections

**Concept:** Expand the 'slice' interaction to encompass not just visual expansion, but semantic understanding of image content. Instead of *always* expanding toward full resolution, the system intelligently anticipates user interest and presents relevant details *first*, even before full expansion.

**Specs:**

*   **Image Analysis Module:** Upon ingestion, each image undergoes content analysis (object detection, scene recognition, facial recognition – utilize existing APIs). Metadata is generated including bounding boxes for key objects, dominant colors, and semantic tags (e.g., "car," "beach," "portrait").

*   **Focus Regions:** Based on analysis, the system identifies "Focus Regions" – areas within the image deemed most likely to attract user attention. These regions are visually highlighted (subtle glow, thin border) in the initial slice configuration.

*   **Dynamic Slice Prioritization:** When the user interacts with a slice, the system *doesn’t* immediately expand the entire image. Instead:
    1.  It expands the Focus Regions first, providing a higher-resolution view of the most important elements.
    2.  Expansion is non-uniform. Focus Regions expand more aggressively than other areas.
    3.  Simultaneously, surrounding slices *contract* slightly, emphasizing the expanded region and creating a 'spotlight' effect.

*   **Semantic Zoom Levels:** Implement multiple "zoom levels" tied to semantic understanding.
    *   **Level 1 (Initial Slice):** Basic slice representation.
    *   **Level 2 (Focus Expansion):** Expanded Focus Regions, surrounding slices contracted.
    *   **Level 3 (Detail View):**  Full resolution of selected object/region within the image.  Remaining image remains in a blurred, lower-resolution state.  User can "pin" this detail view to see it while navigating other images.
    *   **Level 4 (Full Image):** Traditional full-resolution display.

*   **User Interaction:**
    *   **Hover/Touch:** Initiates Focus Region expansion/contraction.
    *   **Click/Tap (Focus Region):**  "Locks" the focus region and expands to Level 3 (Detail View).
    *   **Swipe/Drag (Detail View):** Allows the user to pan/explore the locked Detail View while navigating the larger image collection.
    *   **Double-Click/Tap (Anywhere):** Expands to Level 4 (Full Image).

**Pseudocode (Expansion Logic):**

```
function expandSlice(slice, userInteractionPoint):
  focusRegions = getFocusRegions(slice.image)

  // Calculate distance from userInteractionPoint to each focusRegion
  distances = calculateDistances(userInteractionPoint, focusRegions)

  // Sort focusRegions by distance (closest first)
  sortedRegions = sortRegionsByDistance(distances)

  for region in sortedRegions:
    // Calculate expansion amount based on distance (closer = faster expansion)
    expansionAmount = calculateExpansion(region, userInteractionPoint)

    // Expand the region
    expandRegion(region, expansionAmount)

    // Contract surrounding slices (amount proportional to expansion)
    contractSurroundingSlices(region, expansionAmount)

  if user clicks region:
      zoomToDetailView(region)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for image analysis and rendering.
*   Sufficient RAM to store image data at multiple resolution levels.
*   Responsive touch screen or high-precision mouse input.

**Potential Applications:**

*   E-commerce product browsing.
*   Photo/video editing.
*   Medical image analysis.
*   Virtual tourism.
