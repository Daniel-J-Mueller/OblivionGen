## Dynamic Gaze-Contingent Environmental Control

**System Overview:** A system augmenting the gaze-based unlock with broader environmental control, moving beyond device access to influence the *physical* environment surrounding the user, tailored to gaze patterns.

**Core Innovation:**  Instead of solely unlocking a device, the system learns to associate specific gaze paths, dwell times, and pupil dilation with *desired environmental states*. This creates a "gaze vocabulary" for controlling smart home devices, adjusting lighting, temperature, audio, and even triggering automated actions.

**Hardware Components:**

*   Existing Device:  Electronic device with gaze tracking (as per patent)
*   Smart Home Hub:  Compatible with standard smart home protocols (Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi).
*   Environmental Sensors: Temperature, humidity, ambient light, sound level.
*   Actuators: Smart lights, smart thermostats, smart blinds, smart speakers, robotic actuators (e.g., for minor physical adjustments).
*   IR Emitters/Cameras:  Enhanced system for more precise eye-tracking, particularly in varied lighting conditions.

**Software & Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Gaze Pattern Acquisition:**
    *   During initial setup, the user consciously "trains" the system.  They perform specific gaze paths (e.g., tracing a figure-eight) while *simultaneously* indicating the desired environmental change (via voice command, button press, or gesture).
    *   The system records gaze data (position, velocity, dwell time, pupil dilation, saccade patterns) alongside the corresponding environmental action.
    *   Machine learning algorithms (e.g., Recurrent Neural Networks – RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory – LSTMs) build a personalized "gaze vocabulary" mapping gaze patterns to actions.

2.  **Real-time Gaze Interpretation:**
    *   During normal operation, the system continuously tracks the user’s gaze.
    *   The recorded gaze data is compared to the learned “gaze vocabulary”.
    *   When a recognized gaze pattern is detected (with a confidence threshold), the system triggers the associated environmental action.

3.  **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   The system continuously refines its "gaze vocabulary" based on user feedback (explicit confirmation or correction of actions).
    *   Unrecognized gaze patterns are flagged for potential training (prompting the user to associate them with an action).
    *   The system learns to differentiate between intentional actions and accidental gaze movements.

4.  **Contextual Awareness:**
    *   Integration with environmental sensors provides contextual information. For example, a gaze-initiated lighting adjustment is scaled based on the current ambient light level.
    *   Time of day, location, and user activity (detected via other sensors) are used to filter and prioritize potential actions.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm):**

```
// Define confidence threshold
confidence_threshold = 0.8

// Function to interpret gaze pattern
function interpret_gaze(gaze_data) {
  // Compare gaze_data to learned gaze vocabulary
  best_match = find_best_match(gaze_data, vocabulary)

  // Check confidence level
  if (best_match.confidence > confidence_threshold) {
    // Trigger associated action
    trigger_action(best_match.action)
    return best_match.action
  } else {
    // Flag for potential training
    flag_for_training(gaze_data)
    return null
  }
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Capture gaze data
  gaze_data = capture_gaze_data()

  // Interpret gaze pattern
  action = interpret_gaze(gaze_data)

  // If action is null, continue to next loop iteration
}
```

**Example Use Cases:**

*   **Smart Lighting:** Tracing a circular path with the eyes dims the lights.
*   **Temperature Control:** Looking at a virtual thermostat icon increases the temperature.
*   **Entertainment Control:**  Gazing at a specific area of the screen pauses a video.
*   **Automated Tasks:** Looking at a window initiates the closing of blinds.
*   **Accessibility:** Providing a hands-free interface for individuals with limited mobility.
