## Dynamic Data Materialization with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the virtual column/index concept to proactively materialize data *before* it’s requested, using predictive algorithms to anticipate query needs. Instead of simply creating a virtual column on demand, this system creates and maintains pre-calculated “materialized views” of potential query results, tailored to individual user patterns.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Query Engine (PQE):**

*   **Input:** Workbook data, user query history (formulations, filter criteria, table joins), data change logs.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Pattern Recognition:**  Analyze user query history to identify frequent query patterns, common filter combinations, and frequently joined tables. Employ time-series analysis to detect trends in query frequency.
    *   **Query Graph Construction:** Represent query patterns as directed graphs, where nodes are tables/columns and edges represent joins/filters.
    *   **Cost Estimation:** Estimate the computational cost of evaluating different query paths within the graph. Consider data size, index availability, and join complexity.
    *   **Prefetch Scheduling:**  Prioritize the creation of materialized views based on cost, frequency, and predicted query arrival time.  Use a scheduling algorithm (e.g., earliest deadline first, least slack time) to optimize resource allocation.
*   **Output:**  A prioritized list of materialized views to create.

**2. Materialized View Manager (MVM):**

*   **Input:** Prioritized list of materialized views from PQE, workbook data.
*   **Process:**
    *   **View Creation:** Generate materialized views according to the PQE’s schedule.  Views are stored in a dedicated, high-performance memory store (e.g., NVRAM, in-memory database).  Views include metadata: the original formula that generated them, timestamp of creation, usage statistics.
    *   **Data Dependency Tracking:** Maintain a dependency graph between materialized views and underlying workbook data.  Whenever workbook data changes, identify affected views and trigger regeneration.
    *   **Incremental Update:** Implement incremental update mechanisms to minimize regeneration costs.  Only update portions of a view affected by data changes, rather than recalculating the entire view.
*   **Output:**  A store of pre-calculated query results.

**3. Query Interception and Redirection:**

*   **Process:** Intercept user queries. Before executing a query, check if a corresponding materialized view exists. If found, redirect the query to the materialized view, bypassing the need for on-demand calculation.
*   **Implementation:** Use a query rewrite engine to modify the original query to point to the materialized view.

**Pseudocode (Query Interception):**

```
function handleQuery(query):
  view = findMaterializedView(query)
  if view != null:
    rewrittenQuery = rewriteQueryToUseView(query, view)
    return executeQuery(rewrittenQuery) // Execute against materialized view
  else:
    return executeQuery(query) // Execute standard query
```

**4. Adaptive Learning and Optimization:**

*   **Process:** Monitor materialized view usage statistics (access frequency, latency).  Use this data to refine the predictive model and improve prefetching accuracy. Implement a feedback loop to adjust the prefetching schedule based on observed performance.
*   **Implementation:** Employ reinforcement learning techniques to optimize the prefetching schedule over time. Reward the system for accurate predictions and punish it for wasted prefetching effort.



This system goes beyond simple on-demand virtual columns by proactively preparing data for anticipated queries, leading to significant performance gains. The adaptive learning component ensures that the system continuously improves its ability to predict user needs. The usage of materialization and precalculation is novel, as the prior art focuses on indexing and calculation *during* query evaluation.
