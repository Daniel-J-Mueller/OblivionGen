## Delegated Resource Access with Temporal Policy Shadowing

**Concept:** Extend the delegated access framework to incorporate 'policy shadowing' where a delegate receives not just permissions, but a time-bound 'snapshot' of the delegator's *entire* policy context. This enables finer-grained, auditable, and adaptable delegation beyond simple permission grants.

**Specifications:**

**1. Policy Snapshot Generation:**

*   **Trigger:** Initiated by a delegator as part of a delegation request.
*   **Data:** Captures the delegator's currently active policy set – not just the permissions being delegated, but the full rule set governing their access. This includes resource definitions, conditions (time-of-day, location, device type, etc.), and any complex logic affecting access decisions.
*   **Format:** Policies are serialized into a standardized, immutable data structure (e.g., a signed JSON Web Token - JWT).
*   **Versioning:** Each policy snapshot is assigned a unique version number and a timestamp, representing the state of the policy at that specific moment.

**2. Credential Augmentation:**

*   Delegation requests include not only permission tokens but also references to the generated policy snapshots (e.g., a URL pointing to a secure storage location).
*   The delegate receives a combined credential – a permission token *and* a reference to the delegated policy snapshot.

**3. Request Interception & Policy Resolution:**

*   Resource access requests from the delegate are intercepted by a policy resolution service.
*   The service retrieves the delegate’s combined credential.
*   **Dual Policy Check:** The service performs *two* policy checks:
    *   **Explicit Permissions:**  Verifies if the requested action is permitted by the delegate’s explicit permission token.
    *   **Shadowed Policy Context:**  If the explicit permission check fails, the service retrieves the delegate’s associated policy snapshot.  It then *replays* the access request against the *shadowed* policy set as it existed at the snapshot’s timestamp.  This allows access even if the delegate lacks direct permission, but the delegator’s policies would have allowed it at the time the delegation occurred.

**4. Temporal Validity & Revocation:**

*   Policy snapshots have a defined time-to-live (TTL). After the TTL expires, access is restricted to the delegate’s explicit permissions only.
*   Delegators can revoke individual policy snapshots before the TTL expires, immediately restricting the delegate’s access.
*   Revocation events are logged for auditing purposes.

**5. System Components:**

*   **Delegation Service:** Manages delegation requests, generates policy snapshots, and issues combined credentials.
*   **Policy Snapshot Storage:** Securely stores policy snapshots.
*   **Policy Resolution Service:** Intercepts access requests, retrieves credentials and policy snapshots, and performs policy checks.
*   **Audit Logging Service:** Records delegation events, revocation events, and access attempts.

**Pseudocode (Policy Resolution Service):**

```
function resolveAccessRequest(request, credential):
  permissionToken = credential.permissionToken
  policySnapshotReference = credential.policySnapshotReference

  if checkPermission(request, permissionToken):
    return ALLOW

  if policySnapshotReference:
    policySnapshot = retrievePolicySnapshot(policySnapshotReference)
    if policySnapshot.timestamp < currentTime() and policySnapshot.timestamp + policySnapshot.ttl > currentTime():
      if checkPermission(request, policySnapshot.policySet):
        return ALLOW

  return DENY
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Dynamic Delegation:** Allows delegators to grant access based on evolving policy conditions.
*   **Reduced Complexity:** Simplifies access control by offloading complex policy logic to the delegator.
*   **Enhanced Auditability:** Provides a detailed record of delegated access and policy changes.
*   **Improved Security:** Enables fine-grained control over access rights and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
