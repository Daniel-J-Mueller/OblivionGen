## Dynamic Avatar ‘Mood’ Generation via Environmental Audio Analysis

**Specification:** A system which extends avatar animation beyond text/speech-driven responses by integrating real-time environmental audio analysis to influence avatar ‘mood’ and animation.

**Core Concept:** Instead of *only* reacting to what is said, the avatar subtly (or overtly) responds to *how* it is said and *where* it is being said. This creates a more immersive and believable presence.

**Components:**

1.  **Environmental Audio Input:** Microphone array or virtual audio input (e.g., from a VR environment).
2.  **Audio Analysis Engine:**  A real-time audio processing unit utilizing:
    *   **Noise Level Detection:**  Determines overall sound intensity.
    *   **Frequency Analysis:** Identifies dominant frequencies (e.g., low rumble for ‘serious’, high pitched for ‘excited’).
    *   **Sound Event Recognition:**  Identifies specific sounds (e.g., laughter, applause, sirens, music).  Uses a pre-trained model or allows for custom sound signature creation.
3.  **Mood Mapping Module:**  Associates audio analysis results with pre-defined ‘mood’ states. This module uses a weighted system for combined inputs. 
    *   Example: High noise level + low frequency = ‘intimidated’ mood. Specific sound event ‘applause’ = ‘happy’ mood.
    *   The module should allow for customizable mapping via a visual editor interface.
4.  **Animation Control System:** Translates mood states into avatar animations. This includes:
    *   **Subtle Facial Expressions:**  Micro-expressions reflecting the mood.
    *   **Body Language:**  Posture, gestures, and subtle movements reflecting mood.
    *   **Eye Gaze:**  Direction and focus of the avatar’s gaze.
    *   **Animation Blending:** Seamless transitions between mood-driven animations.
5.  **Avatar Engine Integration:** An API or plugin to integrate the system with existing avatar engines.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Main Loop

While (audio input available){

    audioData = getAudioInput();
    noiseLevel = analyzeNoiseLevel(audioData);
    frequencyData = analyzeFrequency(audioData);
    soundEvent = recognizeSoundEvent(audioData);

    mood = determineMood(noiseLevel, frequencyData, soundEvent);

    animationSequence = selectAnimationSequence(mood);

    applyAnimationSequence(animationSequence);
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Mood Object:** {moodName: string, noiseWeight: float, frequencyWeight: float, eventWeight: float, animationSequenceID: int}
*   **AnimationSequence Object:** {sequenceID: int, facialExpression: array of floats, bodyPosture: array of floats, eyeGazeDirection: array of floats}

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Utilize a modular architecture for easy expansion and customization.
*   Provide a user-friendly interface for creating and managing mood mappings.
*   Optimize performance for real-time processing.
*   Consider incorporating machine learning to dynamically adapt mood mappings based on user feedback.
*   The animation sequences should be created to be as subtle as possible, and allow the audio itself to communicate most of the information.
*   Consider allowing for an "intensity" factor which modifies the selected animation to amplify or dampen the expressed mood.
*   If a conflicting audio source is detected, prioritize based on a predefined order, or randomly select an animation to simulate unpredictability.
