## Dynamic Data Provenance & Recomputation Pipeline

**Concept:** Expand the on-demand function execution to not only *transform* data during retrieval, but also to track a complete provenance graph of all transformations.  Enable recomputation of any past state of the data, on demand, leveraging the function execution pipeline.

**Specs:**

1.  **Provenance Tracking Module:**
    *   Integrated within the code execution system.
    *   Automatically captures metadata for each executed function:
        *   Function ID/Hash
        *   Input Data Hash (of the portion processed)
        *   Output Data Hash (of the portion processed)
        *   Execution Timestamp
        *   Context Data (request source, location, access rights)
        *   Function Parameters
    *   Stores this metadata in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the dataâ€™s transformation history. Each node is a function execution; edges represent data flow.

2.  **Recomputation Request Interface:**
    *   API endpoint to request data as of a specific timestamp.  Example: `/data/{object_id}?as_of=2024-10-27T10:00:00Z`
    *   Request includes:
        *   Object ID
        *   Target Timestamp
    *   The system determines the minimum set of function executions required to reconstruct the data as it existed at the target timestamp.  This is achieved by traversing the provenance graph *backwards* from the latest state to the target timestamp.

3.  **Recomputation Engine:**
    *   Utilizes the code execution system to re-execute only the necessary functions in the correct order, starting from the original data object.
    *   Caches intermediate results to avoid redundant computation.
    *   Provides the reconstructed data as the response.

4.  **Data Versioning:**
    *   Option to materialize specific versions of data (at key timestamps) to persistent storage for faster retrieval.  This offers a trade-off between storage cost and recomputation time.  Materialization triggered by policy or manual intervention.

**Pseudocode (Recomputation Engine):**

```
function recomputeData(objectId, targetTimestamp):
  provenanceGraph = getProvenanceGraph(objectId)
  relevantExecutions = findRelevantExecutions(provenanceGraph, targetTimestamp) // Traverse graph backwards
  
  // Initialize data with original object
  data = getOriginalData(objectId)

  for execution in relevantExecutions:
    function = getFunction(execution.functionId)
    inputData = data // Or retrieved from previous execution in chain
    outputData = executeFunction(function, inputData, execution.parameters)
    data = outputData

  return data
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Auditing & Compliance:**  Easily demonstrate data lineage and adherence to regulations.
*   **Data Recovery:**  Restore data to a previous state after accidental modification or corruption.
*   **Debugging & Analysis:**  Trace the evolution of data to identify the root cause of errors.
*   **Experimentation & Modeling:**  Recreate historical data sets for testing and analysis.
