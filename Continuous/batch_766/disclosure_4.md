## Dynamic Content Overlay System for Physical Works

**Concept:** Extend the idea of linking physical ownership to digital access by creating a system that allows for *dynamic* content overlays on top of images of the physical work. Think augmented reality, but triggered by verified ownership and image recognition of the physical item. This goes beyond simply providing access *to* the work; it allows for interactive layers *on top* of it.

**Specs:**

1.  **Image Recognition Engine:** A server-side component utilizing computer vision algorithms capable of identifying specific pages, sections, or features within images of the physical work. Training data will be based on high-resolution scans of the physical work.
2.  **Ownership Verification Module:** Integrates with existing purchase verification systems (Claim 2, 3, 4, 5) to confirm user ownership.  A unique identifier is associated with each verified copy of the work.
3.  **Content Management System (CMS):** A web-based interface for creating and managing dynamic content overlays. This includes:
    *   **Overlay Types:** Support for various overlay types:
        *   Text annotations.
        *   Interactive diagrams with expandable sections.
        *   Video clips embedded within specific images.
        *   3D models that can be rotated and viewed from different angles.
        *   Links to external resources (websites, databases, etc.).
    *   **Targeting:** Ability to precisely target overlays to specific pages, sections, or features within the physical work (based on image recognition).
    *   **Versioning:**  Support for multiple versions of overlays, allowing for updates and corrections.
4.  **Client Application (Mobile/Desktop):** 
    *   **Camera Input:**  For capturing images of the physical work.
    *   **Image Processing:** Local image processing to enhance image quality and prepare it for recognition.
    *   **Recognition Request:**  Sending the processed image and user ID to the server.
    *   **Overlay Rendering:** Receiving overlay data from the server and rendering it on top of the displayed image.
    *   **Interactive Controls:**  Providing controls for interacting with the overlays (e.g., zooming, rotating, expanding sections).
5.  **API Integration:**  API endpoints to allow third-party developers to create custom overlays and integrate with the system.

**Pseudocode (Client Application - Image Capture & Overlay Request):**

```
function captureImage():
    image = captureImageFromCamera()
    processedImage = enhanceImage(image)
    return processedImage

function requestOverlayData(processedImage, userID):
    request = createRequest(processedImage, userID)
    response = sendRequestToServer(request)
    overlayData = parseResponse(response)
    return overlayData

function renderOverlay(image, overlayData):
    for each overlayElement in overlayData:
        position = overlayElement.position
        type = overlayElement.type
        content = overlayElement.content
        renderElement(image, position, type, content)
    displayImageWithOverlays(image)
```

**Example Use Case:** A user owns a physical repair manual. By scanning a page with the client application, interactive 3D models of the components on that page are overlaid onto the image, allowing the user to rotate and examine them from different angles. Clicking on a component highlights it in the image and displays detailed information about it.
