## Autonomous Network Topology Sculpting

**Concept:** Proactive, AI-driven modification of network device configurations *before* problems arise, based on predicted traffic patterns and device health, aiming for optimal network performance and resilience.  This builds on the idea of monitoring and rollback but shifts the focus from *reacting* to issues to *preventing* them.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Real-time network traffic data (flows, bandwidth utilization, latency)
    *   Historical traffic patterns (daily, weekly, monthly cycles)
    *   Device health metrics (CPU load, memory usage, temperature, error logs)
    *   Scheduled events (e.g., software deployments, anticipated traffic spikes)
    *   External data sources (e.g., weather forecasts influencing VPN usage)
*   **Process:** Utilize machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression, neural networks) to predict future traffic demand and potential device bottlenecks.  Models must be dynamically updated as new data becomes available.  Multiple model variants should run in parallel to provide confidence intervals and error estimation.
*   **Output:** Probabilistic forecasts of traffic volume, latency, and device resource utilization for the next 5-60 minutes, segmented by network segment and device. Confidence intervals for all predictions.

**2. Topology Sculpting Agent:**

*   **Input:**  Predictive forecasts from the Predictive Modeling Engine, current network topology (device connections, configurations), predefined performance policies (e.g., target latency, bandwidth allocation), rollback snapshots (as in the base patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Hypothesis Generation:** Generate multiple potential topology changes (e.g., adjusting routing weights, activating/deactivating redundant links, adjusting QoS settings, shifting traffic load across devices) that could improve predicted performance.
    *   **Simulation:** Use a network emulator (running in a sandboxed environment) to simulate the impact of each potential topology change on predicted traffic patterns.  Emulation must accurately model device behavior and network propagation delays.
    *   **Scoring & Ranking:**  Score each simulated topology change based on a weighted combination of key performance indicators (KPIs) – latency, bandwidth utilization, packet loss, resource utilization.  Rank the top N topology changes.
    *   **Staged Deployment:** Implement the highest-ranked topology change in a staged manner.
        *   **Phase 1: Canary Testing:**  Route a small percentage of real traffic through the modified topology. Monitor KPIs in real-time.
        *   **Phase 2: Incremental Rollout:** Gradually increase the percentage of traffic routed through the modified topology, continuously monitoring KPIs.
        *   **Phase 3: Full Implementation:**  Fully implement the modified topology.
*   **Output:** Adjusted network configurations, traffic routing policies.

**3. Rollback Mechanism (Enhanced):**

*   Prior to any topology change, a comprehensive snapshot of the network configuration is taken.
*   If KPIs degrade significantly during any phase of the staged deployment, the system automatically reverts to the previous configuration.
*   The system logs the reason for the rollback and initiates an analysis to identify the root cause of the performance degradation.
*   Ability to 'undo' individual configuration changes rather than a full rollback.

**Pseudocode (Topology Sculpting Agent):**

```
function SculptTopology(predictions, topology, policies):
  potential_changes = GenerateTopologyChanges(topology, policies)
  for change in potential_changes:
    simulated_topology = ApplyChange(topology, change)
    kpis = Simulate(simulated_topology, predictions)
    score = CalculateScore(kpis, policies)
    add (change, score) to ranked_changes

  best_change = ranked_changes[0] // top ranked change

  if ValidateChange(best_change, topology):
    ApplyChange(best_change, topology)
    LogChange(best_change)
  else:
    LogFailure(best_change)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Integration with existing network management systems (e.g., SNMP, NetFlow).
*   Support for various network devices (routers, switches, firewalls, load balancers).
*   Adaptive learning – the system continuously learns from its experience and improves its predictive accuracy.
*   Security considerations – ensure that topology changes do not introduce security vulnerabilities.
