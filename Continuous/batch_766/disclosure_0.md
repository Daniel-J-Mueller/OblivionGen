## Dynamic Skill Chaining & Predictive Skill Composition

**Concept:** Extend the post-dialog skill recommendation to a system that *chains* skills together based on predicted user needs, proactively composing a multi-step "workflow" before explicit user request.  Instead of simply recommending *a* skill, the system anticipates a series of related tasks and prepares a sequence of skills to fulfill them.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Contextual Workflow Profiler:**

*   **Input:** Dialog session data (utterances, NLU output, system responses), user profile data, time data, previous dialog session data (as per patent).  *Also*:  Real-time sensor data (location, device type, ambient conditions – optional but enhances prediction).
*   **Process:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanism. The RNN analyzes the historical and current dialog context, identifying patterns that suggest a likely *sequence* of user intents. The attention mechanism focuses on key utterances and entities that indicate workflow progression.  Output is a probability distribution over pre-defined workflow templates.
*   **Output:**  A ranked list of potential workflow templates. Each template represents a predicted sequence of skills and the expected data flow between them.  Template example: “Order Pizza” -> “Track Delivery” -> “Provide Feedback”.

**2.  Skill Composition Engine:**

*   **Input:** Ranked workflow templates from the Contextual Workflow Profiler, available skill library (metadata: skill name, input parameters, output parameters, dependencies), user preferences (skill prioritization, preferred communication channels).
*   **Process:** A graph search algorithm (e.g., A*) explores the skill library, constructing a skill composition graph based on the selected workflow template.  The algorithm prioritizes skills that align with user preferences and minimize data transformation overhead. *Dynamic skill insertion*: If a necessary skill is missing, the system identifies similar skills or suggests skill creation.
*   **Output:** An ordered list of skills to be executed, along with the data mapping between them.  This includes the initial data to be passed to the first skill.

**3.  Proactive Skill Presentation & Confirmation:**

*   **Process:**  The system presents the composed skill sequence to the user in a concise and visually appealing format (e.g., a card with skill names and a brief description).  The user can *approve* the entire sequence, *modify* the sequence (add/remove skills), or *cancel* the operation.  If the system has high confidence in the prediction, it can offer an "auto-approve" option.
*   **Output:** User confirmation (approve, modify, cancel).

**4.  Automated Skill Execution & Data Flow:**

*   **Process:** Upon user approval, the system initiates the skill execution sequence, passing data between skills according to the predefined data mapping.  Error handling and retry mechanisms are implemented to ensure robustness.
*   **Output:**  Completion of the skill sequence and delivery of the final output to the user.



**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_workflow(dialog_history, user_profile):
  workflow_probabilities = RNN(dialog_history, user_profile)
  ranked_workflows = sort(workflow_probabilities, descending=True)
  return ranked_workflows

function compose_skill_sequence(workflow, skill_library, user_preferences):
  graph = build_skill_graph(workflow, skill_library)
  path = A_star_search(graph, user_preferences)
  skill_sequence = extract_skills_from_path(path)
  return skill_sequence

function execute_skill_sequence(skill_sequence, initial_data):
  for skill in skill_sequence:
    output_data = execute_skill(skill, input_data)
    input_data = output_data
  return input_data
```
