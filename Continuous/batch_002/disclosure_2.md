## Dynamic Reflow with Stylistic Variance

**Concept:** Extend the reflowable image concept to incorporate stylistic alterations *within* the reflow. Instead of merely repositioning sub-images (reflow objects), the system dynamically adjusts the *visual style* of those objects based on screen size and context, prioritizing readability and aesthetic coherence.

**Specs:**

*   **Reflow Object Metadata:** Each reflow object includes:
    *   `baseImage`: The original sub-image data.
    *   `styleVariants`: A set of pre-defined stylistic profiles (e.g., “boldHeadline”, “smallCaption”, “standardParagraph”). Each profile contains parameters controlling:
        *   `fontFamily`: Font selection.
        *   `fontSize`: Font size.
        *   `fontWeight`: Font weight (bold, normal, light).
        *   `colorScheme`: A palette of colors for text and background.
        *   `shadowOffset`: Shadow parameters (offset, blur, color).
        *   `imageFilter`: Image filters (grayscale, sepia, blur).
    *   `stylePriority`: A ranking of style variants, used when screen size or context limits choices.
*   **Rendering Pipeline:**
    1.  **Screen Analysis:** Determine screen size (width, height), pixel density, and potentially ambient lighting conditions (via device sensors).
    2.  **Contextual Analysis:** Analyze surrounding reflow objects to determine the current “visual flow”.  Is this a heading, a paragraph, a list item?
    3.  **Style Selection:** Based on screen analysis, contextual analysis, and `stylePriority`, select the most appropriate style variant for each reflow object. This selection is not static; it can change dynamically as the user scrolls or resizes the window.
    4.  **Image Transformation:** Apply the selected style variant to the `baseImage`.  This involves:
        *   Text rendering (if the object represents text).
        *   Image filtering and color adjustments.
        *   Applying shadows or other visual effects.
    5.  **Layout and Reflow:** Determine the horizontal and vertical positions of the transformed reflow objects, considering the chosen styles and available screen space.  The algorithm should prioritize maintaining visual coherence and avoiding jarring style shifts.
    6.  **Rendering:** Draw the transformed and positioned reflow objects onto the output medium.

**Pseudocode (Style Selection):**

```
function selectStyle(reflowObject, screenSize, context):
  style = reflowObject.stylePriority[0] // Start with the highest priority style

  if (screenSize.width < 400):  // Example threshold
    style = reflowObject.stylePriority[1] // Switch to a smaller style
    if (context == "heading"):
      style = reflowObject.stylePriority[0] // Revert to high-priority style for headings

  // Further context-aware adjustments based on surrounding elements.
  if (surroundingElementIsBold()):
    style.fontWeight = "bold"

  return style
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Style Generation:**  Use machine learning to automatically generate new style variants based on a given aesthetic profile.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define their own style preferences, which are then applied to all reflowable content.
*   **Dynamic Theme Support:**  Integrate with the device’s operating system to automatically adapt the reflowable content to the current theme (light mode, dark mode).
*   **Accessibility Features:** Offer style variants optimized for users with visual impairments (e.g., high contrast, large font size).
