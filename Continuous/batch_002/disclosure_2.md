## Adaptive Request Chaining with Predictive Delegation

**Concept:** Extend the delegation model to support dynamically constructed request chains, predicting data needs *before* requests are fully formed, and proactively delegating sub-requests. This drastically reduces latency and improves efficiency in complex, multi-service computations.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Chain Construction Module (within First Service):**

    *   **Input:**  Initial computation request, dependency graph of the computation.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Analyze the dependency graph to identify data requirements at each stage.
        *   Decompose the computation into a series of sequential or parallel sub-computations.
        *   Construct a “request chain” outlining the order and type of service calls needed to fulfill data requirements. This chain includes placeholders for expected data outputs.
    *   **Output:**  Request Chain (data structure – see below).

**2. Request Chain Data Structure:**

    *   `ChainID`: Unique identifier for the request chain.
    *   `Nodes`: Array of `ChainNode` objects.
    *   `ChainNode`:
        *   `ServiceID`: Identifier of the service to call.
        *   `RequestPayload`:  Initial request data.
        *   `ExpectedData`: Data type/format expected from this service.
        *   `NextNodes`: Array of `ChainNode` IDs representing possible next steps (conditional branching based on data received).
        *   `Priority`:  Integer indicating the urgency of this request.

**3. Predictive Delegation Engine (within First Service):**

    *   **Input:** Request Chain, historical service performance data (latency, availability).
    *   **Process:**
        *   Analyze the Request Chain and predict potential bottlenecks.
        *   Proactively delegate the *initial* nodes of the Request Chain to downstream services.  (e.g., the first two or three service calls are initiated *before* the full computation is triggered).
        *   Implement a “shadowing” mechanism:  Duplicate the initial Request Chain and dispatch it to a secondary set of services (for redundancy and performance comparison).
        *   Monitor service performance and dynamically adjust delegation priorities.
    *   **Output:** Delegated Service Calls, performance metrics.

**4. Data Broker/Orchestrator (New Service):**

    *   **Input:** Delegated Service Calls, Request Chain information.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Manage the execution of the Request Chain across multiple services.
        *   Aggregate data from multiple services and route it to the appropriate downstream services.
        *   Implement a caching layer to store frequently accessed data.
        *   Handle errors and retries.
    *   **Output:** Aggregated Data, status updates.

**5.  Adaptive Delegation Protocol:**

    *   Services communicate using a new protocol extension to existing SOAP/REST APIs.
    *   Requests include “Delegation Tokens” allowing services to authorize sub-requests on their behalf.
    *   Services provide real-time performance metrics to the Data Broker/Orchestrator.
    *   The Data Broker/Orchestrator uses this data to dynamically adjust delegation priorities and routing decisions.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Delegation Engine):**

```pseudocode
function initiateChain(request, dependencyGraph)
  chain = buildRequestChain(request, dependencyGraph)
  // Build initial chain nodes
  initialNodes = getFirstNChainNodes(chain, 3)
  delegateInitialNodes(initialNodes)
  monitorChainPerformance()
end function

function delegateInitialNodes(nodes)
  for each node in nodes
    sendServiceCall(node.ServiceID, node.RequestPayload)
  end for
end function

function monitorChainPerformance()
  // Monitor service response times
  // Adjust delegation priorities based on performance data
  // Dynamically add or remove chain nodes
end function
```
