## Dynamic Application ‘Skill Trees’ & Predictive Learning Paths

**Concept:** Leverage application usage data, not just for recommendations, but to construct dynamic ‘skill trees’ for each application.  These skill trees represent the various functionalities and complexities *within* an application, and a user's progression through them. This allows for *predictive* learning paths – anticipating what features a user will need *next*, and proactively guiding them or recommending complementary applications.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Collection & Skill Tree Construction:**

*   **Application Decomposition:**  Each application is analyzed (initially through developer-provided metadata, later through automated usage pattern analysis) to identify core functionalities, categorized as ‘skills.’  Skills are hierarchical – e.g., "Image Editing" > "Color Correction" > "Hue Adjustment."
*   **Usage Data Mapping:**  User interactions with the application are mapped to these skills.  Time spent on a feature, frequency of use, specific parameters adjusted – all contribute to a ‘skill proficiency’ score.  Initial proficiency is estimated based on related user data and application complexity.
*   **Dynamic Tree Adjustment:** The skill tree itself *evolves* based on aggregated user behavior.  If a large percentage of users consistently skip a particular feature, its prominence in the tree is reduced. New features automatically add new branches to the tree.
*   **Skill Dependency Graph:** A graph database stores the dependencies between skills.  Mastering “Basic Photo Filters” is a prerequisite for “Advanced Retouching.”

**2. User Profiling & Predictive Pathing:**

*   **Skill Profile:** Each user has a skill profile – a representation of their proficiency in various skills across *all* applications.
*   **Usage Pattern Analysis:** Machine learning algorithms analyze a user’s skill profile and application usage to identify gaps in their skill set and predict what skills they will need to learn next.
*   **Personalized Learning Path:** The system generates a personalized learning path – a sequence of recommended features, tutorials, or even complementary applications designed to bridge those skill gaps.
*   **Adaptive Difficulty:** The learning path dynamically adjusts in difficulty based on the user’s progress.

**3.  Recommendation Engine Integration:**

*   **Skill-Based Recommendations:**  Recommendations are no longer based solely on *what* applications related users are using, but *how* they are using them.
*   **Feature Highlighting:** Within an app, the system can proactively highlight relevant features based on the user's predicted learning path.  A small tutorial bubble could appear, guiding them through a more advanced technique.
*   **Complementary App Discovery:** If a user is consistently hitting a limitation within one app, the system can recommend a complementary app that provides the missing functionality.
*   **Gamification:**  Skill progression can be gamified with badges, leaderboards, and rewards, encouraging users to explore more advanced features.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Generation):**

```
function generateRecommendations(targetUser):
  targetSkills = getTargetUserSkills(targetUser)
  predictedNeededSkills = predictNextSkills(targetSkills)
  
  candidateApps = findAppsWithSkills(predictedNeededSkills)  //Apps fulfilling need

  rankedApps = rankAppsByRelevance(candidateApps, targetUser) //Considering usage data

  recommendations = selectTopNApps(rankedApps, 5) //Limit recommendations
  
  return recommendations
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Skill Tree:** Graph database (Neo4j) representing skill hierarchy & dependencies.
*   **User Profile:** JSON document storing skill proficiency scores.
*   **Application Metadata:** JSON document describing application features & associated skills.
