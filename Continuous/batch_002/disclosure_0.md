## Adaptive Sparsity via Dynamic Kernel Selection

**Concept:** Leverage the dilated convolution framework to implement dynamic sparsity patterns at runtime. Instead of fixed dilation rates, the system selects from a library of small, pre-computed kernel variants based on the *local* activation patterns of the input data. This creates a form of adaptive sparsity, reducing computational load without sacrificing accuracy.

**Specifications:**

*   **Kernel Library:** A repository of small convolutional kernels (e.g., 3x3, 5x5) with varying dilation rates (including 0 – standard convolution). These kernels are pre-computed and stored in memory (potentially compressed).
*   **Activation-Based Kernel Selection:** A lightweight neural network (or rule-based system) analyzes the activations of a small region of the input feature map. This analysis determines the optimal kernel from the library to apply to that region.  Criteria could include entropy, variance, or the presence of specific features.
*   **Systolic Array Modification:** The systolic array needs to be configurable to handle variable kernel sizes and dilation rates. This can be achieved through programmable data pathways and control signals.
*   **Metadata Encoding:**  Each kernel in the library is associated with metadata indicating its size, dilation rate, and potentially, the type of activation pattern it’s best suited for.
*   **Dynamic Scheduling:** A scheduler dynamically loads the selected kernel’s weights and metadata into the systolic array, configures the data pathways, and initiates the convolution operation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Kernel Library: List of (Kernel_Weights, Kernel_Metadata)

// For each region of input feature map:
  // Analyze local activations (calculate entropy/variance/feature presence)
  activation_profile = analyze_activations(input_region)

  // Select best kernel from library
  best_kernel, best_metadata = select_kernel(activation_profile, kernel_library)

  // Load kernel weights and metadata into systolic array
  load_kernel(systolic_array, best_kernel, best_metadata)

  // Configure data pathways for selected kernel
  configure_systolic_array(systolic_array, best_metadata)

  // Perform convolution using systolic array
  output_region = perform_convolution(systolic_array, input_region)

  // Store output region
  store_output(output_region)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Configurable Systolic Array (programmable data pathways, control signals)
*   Fast on-chip memory for kernel library and metadata
*   Dedicated hardware for activation analysis (entropy/variance calculation)
*   Hardware scheduler for kernel loading and configuration

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced computational cost through dynamic sparsity.
*   Improved accuracy by adapting to local data patterns.
*   Increased energy efficiency.
*   Potential for hardware acceleration of activation analysis.
*   Reduced memory bandwidth requirements.
