## Modular Conveyance with Dynamic Gap Adjustment

**Concept:** Expand upon the rotatable divider concept by creating a conveyance surface composed of independently addressable, modular tiles. Each tile contains multiple, narrow, rotatable dividers, but instead of *just* operating/storage configurations, these dividers can create variable gaps. This allows the system to accommodate items of highly variable sizes *without* needing pre-defined slots or large gaps that reduce density.

**Specs:**

*   **Tile Dimensions:** 15cm x 15cm x 5cm (standardized, interlocking).  Modular for scalability and repair.
*   **Divider Count per Tile:** 10 dividers per tile, running the 15cm length.
*   **Divider Material:** Lightweight, high-strength polymer (e.g., carbon fiber reinforced nylon).
*   **Divider Rotation:** Each divider rotates 90 degrees (flat to upright/blocking). Individual, digitally controlled micro-servos drive each divider.
*   **Tile Communication:** Each tile connects to a central control system via a low-power, high-bandwidth wireless protocol (e.g., Zigbee, Bluetooth Mesh). Power delivered via conductive interlocking connections.
*   **Surface Material:** Low-friction, static-dissipative material covering the tile base.
*   **Control System:**  AI-powered image recognition system analyzes incoming items (size, shape).  Algorithms calculate optimal divider configurations for each item, maximizing density and stability.
*   **Gap Adjustment Range:** Dividers can create gaps from 0cm (fully upright) to 7.5cm (fully lowered/creating a half-tile gap).
*   **Power Requirements:** Each tile draws approximately 5W peak during divider adjustments.
*   **Data Input:** 3D Camera positioned at conveyor input scans incoming items.
*   **Software Architecture:** Python-based control system with TensorFlow integration for image analysis and path planning.

**Operation:**

1.  Incoming item passes under the 3D camera.
2.  The AI estimates the item's dimensions and calculates the necessary divider configuration.
3.  The control system sends commands to the relevant tiles.
4.  Tile-mounted micro-servos rotate dividers to create a customized “slot” for the item.
5.  Item is conveyed along the surface.
6.  As the item moves off the tile, the dividers return to a default flat configuration, ready for the next item.

**Pseudocode (Tile Control Logic):**

```python
class Tile:
    def __init__(self, tile_id, communication_module):
        self.tile_id = tile_id
        self.communication_module = communication_module
        self.dividers = [Divider(i) for i in range(10)] # 10 dividers per tile
        self.default_position = 0 # All dividers flat

    def set_divider_position(self, divider_index, angle):
        self.dividers[divider_index].set_angle(angle)

    def receive_command(self, divider_positions):
        # divider_positions is a list of angles (0-90 degrees) for each divider
        for i, angle in enumerate(divider_positions):
            self.set_divider_position(i, angle)

    def reset_to_default(self):
        for divider in self.dividers:
            divider.set_angle(0)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated warehouses & fulfillment centers.
*   Parcel sorting systems.
*   Airport baggage handling.
*   Retail product sorting/display.
