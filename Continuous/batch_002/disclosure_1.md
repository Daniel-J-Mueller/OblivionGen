## Secure Hardware State Replication & Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the hardware latch/master latch system not just for *preventing* modification, but for securely replicating and rolling back hardware configurations. This builds on the idea of a fixed state until power cycle, adding layers of verification and recovery.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Component:** "Configuration Shadow Register" (CSR) – a dedicated register set mirroring critical hardware configuration parameters (e.g., memory timings, PCIe lane assignments, boot order).  This shadow register set is physically separate from the actively used configuration registers.
*   **CSR Access:** Access to the CSR is restricted. Only the offload engine (as described in the patent) and a designated “Verification Engine” (VE) have write access. Normal system processes have read-only access for comparison.
*   **Verification Engine (VE):** A dedicated hardware module (FPGA-based or ASIC) responsible for:
    *   Periodically (or on-demand) reading both active configuration registers *and* the CSR.
    *   Performing a cryptographic hash (SHA-256 or similar) of both register sets.
    *   Comparing the hashes.
    *   Generating an alert if hashes do not match.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:** If a configuration mismatch is detected (hashes differ) *and* a pre-defined “rollback trigger” is activated (e.g., system instability detected by watchdog timer, operator intervention), the VE initiates a hardware-level configuration restoration. This is done by:
    *   Directly writing the contents of the CSR to the active configuration registers.
    *   Asserting a “safe reset” signal to the host computing device to ensure a clean transition.
*   **Master Latch Extension:** The master latch now controls not only modification prevention, but also the validity of the CSR.  A new bit within the master latch (“CSR Valid”) indicates whether the CSR contains a known-good configuration.  If “CSR Valid” is cleared, the VE will refuse to perform rollback, preventing the use of a corrupted CSR.
*   **CSR Population:** The CSR is populated during a controlled "golden configuration" phase *before* deployment.  This phase is initiated by the offload engine and requires physical access to the hardware.

**Pseudocode (VE – Configuration Verification):**

```
FUNCTION VerifyConfiguration()
  active_config = ReadActiveConfigurationRegisters()
  shadow_config = ReadShadowConfigurationRegisters()
  active_hash = CalculateHash(active_config)
  shadow_hash = CalculateHash(shadow_config)

  IF (active_hash != shadow_hash) THEN
    LogConfigurationMismatch()
    IF (RollbackTriggered()) THEN
      RestoreConfigurationFromShadow()
      LogConfigurationRestored()
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION RestoreConfigurationFromShadow()
  // Direct hardware write of shadow configuration to active registers
  WriteActiveConfigurationRegisters(shadow_config)
  AssertSafeReset()
END FUNCTION
```

**Rationale:** This adds a layer of resilience beyond simply preventing unauthorized modification. Even if a configuration drift occurs due to hardware failure or a subtle bug, the system can automatically revert to a known-good state.  The physical separation of the CSR and the controlled population process provide a strong defense against malicious attacks targeting configuration data. The 'safe reset' signal ensures that the rollback is performed cleanly without leaving the system in an unstable state.
