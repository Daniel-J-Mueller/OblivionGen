## Dynamic Contextual Keypoint Weighting for Multi-Subject Occlusion Handling

**Specification:** A system to improve human pose estimation and tracking in scenarios with multiple subjects and significant occlusion, by dynamically adjusting keypoint confidence weights based on inter-subject proximity and occlusion levels.

**Core Concept:** The patent describes leveraging keypoint confidence for improved human detection. This expands on that concept by not just *using* keypoint confidence, but *modulating* it based on the surrounding scene – specifically, the presence and proximity of *other* detected humans, and the degree to which keypoints are visibly occluded.  This aims to move beyond simple thresholding of keypoint confidence to a more nuanced, context-aware system.

**System Components:**

1.  **Human Detection & Tracking Module:**  Standard object detection and multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., Kalman filtering, SORT, DeepSORT) to identify and track individual humans in the scene. Outputs bounding boxes and unique IDs for each subject.
2.  **Keypoint Detection Module:**  Utilizes a pre-trained pose estimation model (e.g., OpenPose, HRNet) to detect keypoints (e.g., elbows, knees, wrists) for each detected human. Outputs keypoint coordinates and associated confidence scores.
3.  **Occlusion Estimation Module:** This is the novel component.
    *   **Proximity Mapping:** For each detected human, calculate the distance to all other detected humans.  Create a "proximity map" indicating the number of other humans within a defined radius (e.g., 1 meter, 2 meters).
    *   **Visibility Assessment:** For each keypoint, determine the degree of occlusion. This could be done through a combination of methods:
        *   **Bounding Box Overlap:** Calculate the overlap between the keypoint's estimated location and the bounding boxes of other humans.  Higher overlap indicates greater occlusion.
        *   **Depth Estimation:** If depth information is available (e.g., from a stereo camera or depth sensor), use it to directly determine if a keypoint is hidden behind another person.
        *   **Semantic Segmentation:** Use semantic segmentation to identify body parts and determine if a keypoint is likely occluded by another body part.
4.  **Dynamic Weighting Function:**  This module combines the proximity and occlusion information to dynamically adjust the weight assigned to each keypoint's confidence score.

    *   `weighted_confidence = original_confidence * (1 - occlusion_factor) * (1 / (1 + proximity_factor))`

        *   `original_confidence`: The initial confidence score output by the Keypoint Detection Module.
        *   `occlusion_factor`:  A value between 0 and 1 representing the degree of occlusion.  Higher occlusion means a higher factor, reducing the weighted confidence.
        *   `proximity_factor`:  A value based on the number of nearby humans.  More nearby humans increase the factor, reducing weighted confidence. This implements a “social distancing” effect on keypoint trust.

5.  **Pose Refinement Module:** This module takes the weighted keypoint confidences and uses them to refine the estimated pose. Techniques like weighted least squares or Kalman filtering can be used to combine the weighted keypoint locations and create a more accurate and robust pose estimate.

**Pseudocode (Pose Refinement):**

```
function refine_pose(keypoints, weights):
  // keypoints: List of (x, y) coordinates for each keypoint
  // weights: Corresponding confidence weights for each keypoint

  filtered_keypoints = []
  for i in range(len(keypoints)):
    if weights[i] > confidence_threshold:
      filtered_keypoints.append(keypoints[i])
    else:
      // Replace low-confidence keypoint with predicted location based on other keypoints.
      predicted_x, predicted_y = predict_keypoint_location(keypoints, i)
      filtered_keypoints.append((predicted_x, predicted_y))

  refined_pose = calculate_pose_from_keypoints(filtered_keypoints)
  return refined_pose
```

**Potential Improvements:**

*   **Learnable Weights:** The weighting function could be made learnable using a neural network trained on a dataset of occluded human poses.
*   **Contextual Reasoning:** Incorporate contextual information about the scene (e.g., furniture, walls) to improve occlusion estimation.
*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Fuse information from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, depth sensors, LiDAR) to create a more comprehensive understanding of the scene.
