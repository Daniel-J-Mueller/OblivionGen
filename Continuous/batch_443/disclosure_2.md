## Thread: Bioluminescent Step Lighting

**Concept:** Integrate bioluminescent bacteria or algae into the step light housing, creating a self-illuminating system that reduces or eliminates the need for electricity.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Housing Material:** Transparent or translucent bioplastic (PLA, PHA) with integrated microfluidic channels.  Must be UV resistant to protect the bioluminescent organisms.
2.  **Organism Containment:** Microfluidic channels maintain a sterile environment for *Aliivibrio fischeri* or genetically engineered bioluminescent algae. Channel dimensions: 0.5mm diameter, spaced 5mm apart throughout the light housing.
3.  **Nutrient Delivery System:**  A slow-release nutrient matrix embedded within the bioplastic provides essential nutrients (e.g., glycerol, amino acids) to the organisms. Replaceable cartridge system for nutrient replenishment - estimate 6-month lifespan per cartridge.
4.  **Oxygenation:** Micro-porous membrane integrated into the housing allows for passive oxygen diffusion. Design to maximize surface area exposure while maintaining sterility.
5.  **Light Output Control:**  A thin-film electrochromic layer surrounding the bioluminescent channels. Applying a small voltage alters the transparency, modulating the light output (dimming/brightening). Control via a low-power Bluetooth module.
6.  **Power Source:** Small, integrated solar cell to power the Bluetooth module and electrochromic layer. Supercapacitor for energy storage.
7.  **Sterilization/Maintenance:**  UV-C LED integrated into the housing for periodic sterilization of the microfluidic channels. Activated remotely via Bluetooth.
8.  **Form Factor:** Modular design allowing for variable light strip lengths and shapes.  Interlocking segments with waterproof seals.
9.  **Bio-Safety:** Housing sealed with multiple layers of bioplastic and UV-blocking agents to prevent accidental release of organisms. Fail-safe system to automatically shut down light output if seal integrity is compromised.

**Pseudocode for control system:**

```
// Initialization
solar_power_on()
bluetooth_on()
uv_led_off()
electrochromic_layer_transparent()

// Main loop
while (true) {
  if (bluetooth_data_received()) {
    command = parse_bluetooth_data()
    if (command == "dim") {
      electrochromic_layer_opacity += 0.1  // Increase opacity
    } else if (command == "brighten") {
      electrochromic_layer_opacity -= 0.1 // Decrease opacity
    } else if (command == "sterilize") {
      uv_led_on()
      delay(60 seconds)
      uv_led_off()
    }
  }

  if (seal_compromised()) {
    shut_down_all_systems()
    activate_warning_light()
  }
}
