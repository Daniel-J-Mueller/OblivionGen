## Acoustic Holography Speaker Array

**Concept:** Extend the multi-speaker concept into a full volumetric sound field generator capable of creating localized audio ‘holograms’ in space. This moves beyond directional audio and creates a truly immersive, spatially accurate sound experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Housing:** Spherical shell, approximately 30cm diameter, constructed of a rigid, acoustically transparent material (e.g., a perforated metal or a specialized polymer). The sphere is not fully sealed; it *must* allow air to pass through freely.
*   **Speaker Array:**
    *   Minimum of 64 individual micro-speakers (0.5-1cm diameter), arranged in a precisely mapped grid *inside* the spherical shell. Density is highest at the 'equator' of the sphere and diminishes toward the poles.
    *   Each speaker is independently addressable and digitally controlled.
    *   Speakers are back-loaded with a small, precisely shaped resonant cavity to optimize frequency response and minimize distortion. Cavity shape varies per speaker to tune for specific frequencies.
*   **Microphone Array:** 8-16 high-sensitivity microphones embedded within the spherical shell, evenly distributed. Used for real-time acoustic environment mapping and feedback control.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded high-performance processor with dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processing) hardware.  
    *   Capable of real-time ray tracing and wave propagation modeling.
    *   Runs advanced algorithms for beamforming, wavefront reconstruction, and spatial audio rendering.
*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer. Internal rechargeable battery for backup.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3.
*   **Control Interface:** Mobile App (iOS/Android) for configuration, content streaming, and scene creation.  Voice control integration.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: 3D Audio Scene Description (coordinates, sound events, textures)
// Input: Real-time Acoustic Environment Map (from Microphone Array)

function RenderAudioScene() {
  // 1. Spatial Audio Decomposition:
  //    Break down the audio scene into individual sound sources.
  //    Each source has a 3D location, amplitude, frequency spectrum, and spatial characteristics (e.g., directivity).

  // 2. Wavefront Reconstruction:
  //    For each sound source:
  //    a. Calculate the wavefront at each speaker location.  This involves:
  //       i. Calculating the distance from the source to each speaker.
  //       ii. Applying phase shifts to compensate for distance and create constructive/destructive interference.
  //       iii. Applying equalization to compensate for speaker frequency response and room acoustics.
  //       iv.  Implementing Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) for personalized spatialization.

  // 3. Speaker Driver Control:
  //    For each speaker:
  //    a. Calculate the optimal signal to drive the speaker. This is the sum of the signals from all sound sources, weighted by the wavefront calculations.
  //    b. Send the calculated signal to the speaker driver.

  // 4. Acoustic Feedback & Adaptation (Real-time):
  //    a. Capture ambient acoustic environment data using the microphone array.
  //    b. Analyze the captured data to detect reflections, standing waves, and other acoustic anomalies.
  //    c. Adjust the wavefront calculations and speaker driver signals to compensate for these anomalies and improve the accuracy of the spatial audio rendering.

**Novelty:**

This differs significantly from the claimed patent by shifting from discrete directional sound to *volumetric* sound field generation. The goal isn’t just to aim sound at a point, but to recreate the sound *itself* at a specific location in space, creating the illusion that sound originates from a virtual source independent of the physical speaker array. The incorporation of real-time acoustic feedback is crucial to adapting to varied environments and refining the sound field. This goes beyond typical spatial audio systems.
