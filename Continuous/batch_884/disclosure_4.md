## Dynamic Code Splitting & Collaborative Virtual Execution

**Concept:** Extend the existing annotation-driven migration to facilitate *dynamic* code splitting during runtime, coupled with a collaborative virtual execution model. This allows a single function call to transparently execute across multiple, geographically distributed virtual compute services, optimizing for latency, cost, and resource availability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Enhanced Annotation System:**

*   **Annotation Types:** Introduce new annotation types beyond simple migration.
    *   `@Splitable`: Indicates a function is eligible for dynamic splitting.
    *   `@GeoPreference(region: String)`:  Hints at desired execution region(s) for performance or compliance.
    *   `@ResourceConstraint(memory: Int, timeout: Int)`:  Specifies resource limits for the split function.
*   **Dynamic Annotation Updates:** Allow annotation modifications at runtime via a dedicated API endpoint. This enables adaptive optimization based on real-time conditions.

**2. Runtime Splitter & Orchestrator:**

*   **Call Interception:**  A runtime agent intercepts calls to `@Splitable` functions.
*   **Dependency Analysis:**  The agent performs a lightweight dependency analysis to determine the function's sub-components and data flow.
*   **Split Point Selection:**  Algorithm to identify optimal split points based on:
    *   Data dependencies (minimize data transfer).
    *   Computational complexity of sub-components.
    *   Available virtual compute services.
    *   Geo-proximity to data sources and users.
*   **Dynamic Deployment:** Automatically deploy sub-components as individual virtual compute service functions.

**3. Collaborative Execution Engine:**

*   **Distributed State Management:** A shared, distributed key-value store manages the state of the split function across different virtual compute service instances.
*   **Message Passing:** Inter-function communication via asynchronous message queues.
*   **Control Flow Orchestration:** A central orchestrator manages the execution order and data flow between the split function instances.  Uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent the execution plan.

**4. Resource Negotiation & Scaling:**

*   **Resource Bidding:** Virtual compute service instances bid for execution tasks based on available resources and cost.
*   **Automatic Scaling:** Dynamically scale the number of virtual compute service instances based on workload demands.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Algorithm to minimize overall execution cost by selecting the cheapest available virtual compute services.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Splitter):**

```pseudocode
function interceptCall(functionCall, functionDefinition):
  if functionDefinition.isAnnotatedWith("@Splitable"):
    splitPoints = identifySplitPoints(functionDefinition)
    subComponents = splitFunction(functionDefinition, splitPoints)
    
    for subComponent in subComponents:
      deployVirtualFunction(subComponent) #Deploy as virtual function
    
    executionPlan = generateExecutionPlan(subComponents) #DAG of execution
    
    orchestrator.submit(executionPlan, functionCall.arguments) #Execute
    
    result = orchestrator.waitForCompletion()
    return result
  else:
    return executeOriginalFunction(functionCall)

function identifySplitPoints(functionDefinition):
    #Static and dynamic analysis of function to find suitable split points
    #Based on dependency graph and code complexity
    return list_of_split_points

function deployVirtualFunction(subComponent):
    #Package and deploy to virtual compute service
    #Return function identifier
    return function_identifier
```

**API Endpoints:**

*   `/annotation/update`: Update function annotations at runtime.
*   `/split/analyze`: Request split point analysis for a function.
*   `/function/deploy`: Deploy a function as a virtual compute service.
*   `/execution/submit`: Submit an execution plan to the orchestrator.

This system moves beyond simple function migration toward a more dynamic and intelligent execution model, leveraging the power of serverless computing to optimize for performance, cost, and scalability.
