## Global Data Provenance Tracking with Temporal Merkle Trees

**System Specifications:**

**Core Component:** Temporal Merkle Tree (TMT)

*   **Data Structure:** A Merkle Tree where each leaf node represents a data version at a specific timestamp.  Each node incorporates a timestamp reflecting when the data version was valid.
*   **Versioning:**  Every write operation to a replicated table creates a new leaf node in the TMT, retaining all historical versions.  Deletion is handled by marking a version as ‘inactive’ rather than physical removal.
*   **Replication Strategy:** TMTs are fully replicated across all regional database nodes.
*   **Hashing Algorithm:** SHA-256 or equivalent cryptographic hash function.
*   **Timestamp Granularity:** Microsecond precision.

**Provenance Service:**

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `GET /provenance/{table}/{key}/{timestamp}`:  Returns the hash value of the data at a specific key and timestamp, proving its state at that time.  Returns error if timestamp predates earliest version.
    *   `GET /history/{table}/{key}`: Returns a list of all valid timestamps for a given key, ordered chronologically.
    *   `GET /audit_trail/{table}`:  Returns a list of all write operations performed on the table, including timestamp, key, user ID (if available), and operation type (insert, update, delete).
*   **Query Optimization:** Indexing TMT nodes by timestamp and key.
*   **Data Retention Policy:** Configurable data retention period for TMT data.

**Integration with Global Table Management System:**

*   **Write Interception:** Before any write operation is applied to the replicated table, the system creates a new TMT node representing the pre-write data version.
*   **Metadata Update:**  The TMT root hash for the table is stored as metadata associated with the global table.  This allows for verifying the integrity of the entire table at any point in time.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** During replication conflicts, the TMT can be used to determine the most recent and authoritative data version.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**  If a management operation fails on one or more replicas, the TMT can be used to revert the failed operation to a known good state.

**Pseudocode (Rollback Operation):**

```
function rollback_global_table(table_name, failed_replica, timestamp):
  // Retrieve the TMT root hash at the specified timestamp
  tmt_root_hash = get_tmt_root_hash(table_name, timestamp)

  // Calculate the expected state of the table based on the TMT root hash
  expected_table_state = calculate_table_state(tmt_root_hash)

  // Compare the current state of the failed replica to the expected state
  differences = compare_table_states(failed_replica, expected_table_state)

  // Apply the differences to revert the failed operation
  revert_changes(failed_replica, differences)

  // Log the rollback operation for auditing purposes
  log_rollback(table_name, failed_replica, timestamp)
```

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simple data replication by creating an immutable, time-stamped record of every data change.  It allows for full data provenance tracking, enabling auditing, compliance, and granular rollback capabilities.  The TMT approach offers a more robust and auditable solution than traditional versioning systems.  The integration with global table management allows for intelligent conflict resolution and simplifies disaster recovery.
