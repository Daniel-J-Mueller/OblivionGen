## Dynamic Mirror Array for Multi-Angle Item Scanning

**Concept:** Expand the single-mirror scanning concept into a dynamically adjustable array of miniature mirrors. This allows for simultaneous scanning from multiple angles, dramatically improving data capture and reducing the need for item movement or multiple passes. This moves beyond simple reflection to controlled light steering.

**Specs:**

*   **Mirror Array:** 16x16 grid of micro-mirrors (MEMS technology preferred), each individually addressable. Mirror size: 1mm x 1mm.  Material: Highly reflective, coated silicon.
*   **Enclosure:** Sealed unit with transparent viewing window. Dimensions: 20cm x 20cm x 10cm.  Material: Anodized aluminum. Features integrated gas flow ports aligned with the mirror array.
*   **Gas Flow System:** Pressurized air source (5-10 PSI).  Micro-nozzle array positioned *above* the mirror array. Nozzles direct a laminar flow of air *across* the mirror surfaces, removing dust and debris *before* it settles.  Independent control of airflow to each section of the array.
*   **Actuation System:**  Piezoelectric actuators controlling the tilt and rotation of each micro-mirror. Resolution: 0.1 degrees. Range of motion: +/- 15 degrees in two axes.
*   **Optical Sensor Array:** 16x16 array of miniature photodiode sensors, positioned directly opposite the mirror array. Each sensor aligned with a corresponding mirror.
*   **Control System:** Embedded microcontroller with real-time processing capabilities.  Algorithms for:
    *   Mirror array calibration.
    *   Dynamic angle adjustment based on item profile (using pre-programmed profiles or real-time sensing).
    *   Data fusion from multiple sensors.
    *   Gas flow control.
*   **Software Interface:**  GUI for configuration, monitoring, and data visualization. Options for:
    *   Profile creation.
    *   Scanning parameters.
    *   Data export.

**Pseudocode (Scanning Operation):**

```
// Initialization
calibrateMirrorArray()
initializeGasFlow()

// Scanning Loop
while (itemPresent()) {
    // Determine item profile (using pre-defined profile or sensor input)
    itemProfile = getItemProfile()

    // Calculate optimal mirror angles for multi-angle scan
    mirrorAngles = calculateMirrorAngles(itemProfile)

    // Set mirror angles
    setMirrorAngles(mirrorAngles)

    // Acquire data from sensor array
    sensorData = acquireSensorData()

    // Process sensor data (noise reduction, image reconstruction)
    processedData = processSensorData(sensorData)

    // Output processed data
    outputData(processedData)

    //Adjust gas flow based on dust detection
    dustLevel = detectDust()
    adjustGasFlow(dustLevel)

}
```

**Innovation:**

The dynamic mirror array moves beyond simple light reflection to create a controllable, multi-angle scanning system. The integrated gas flow system provides proactive dust removal, increasing scanning accuracy and reliability.  This allows for complete data capture even on complex item surfaces, and will decrease required processing time by providing more robust datasets.
