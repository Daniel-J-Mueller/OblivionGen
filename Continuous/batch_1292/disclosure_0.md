## Adaptive Emotional Response Synthesis for Virtual Avatars

**Concept:** Expand sentiment detection beyond categorization into *synthesis* of emotional responses within virtual avatars. Instead of simply identifying "happy" or "sad", the system will generate nuanced emotional displays – facial expressions, vocal intonation, subtle body language – based on a continuous sentiment 'vector' derived from audio analysis.

**Specs:**

**1. Sentiment Vector Generation:**

*   **Input:** Audio data stream (speech, vocalizations).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Utilize existing acoustic feature extraction (as in the provided patent).
    *   Add prosodic feature extraction: pitch contours, speaking rate, pauses, energy levels.
    *   Employ a dimensionality reduction technique (PCA, t-SNE) to map acoustic and prosodic features into a 128-dimensional 'sentiment vector'.  This vector represents a continuous space of emotional states, not discrete categories.  The vector’s components might represent valence (positive/negative), arousal (calm/excited), dominance (submissive/assertive), and other dimensions of emotion.
    *   Output: Sentiment Vector (128-float array).

**2. Avatar Control System:**

*   **Input:** Sentiment Vector. Avatar Skeletal Model. Blend Shape Library (facial expressions, body poses).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Mapping Layer:**  A neural network (specifically, a Multilayer Perceptron – MLP) trained to map the 128-dimensional sentiment vector to control parameters for the avatar’s:
        *   **Facial Blend Shapes:**  50+ blend shapes defining facial muscle movements (e.g., brow furrow, lip corner pull, eye widening).  The MLP outputs weights for each blend shape.
        *   **Body Pose:**  Joint angles for key body parts (head, shoulders, arms, hands). The MLP outputs target angles.
        *   **Vocal Synthesis:** Control parameters for a text-to-speech (TTS) engine, including pitch, rate, and energy, based on sentiment dimensions.
    *   **Smoothing & Blending:** Apply a moving average filter to the MLP’s output to reduce jitter and create smoother transitions. Blend the current pose/expression with the previous one.
    *   **Output:** Control signals for avatar skeletal model, facial blend shapes, and TTS engine.

**3.  Dynamic Calibration & Personalization:**

*   **User-Specific Models:**  Allow users to calibrate the system to their own vocal expressions and emotional displays.  This involves recording the user speaking in various emotional states and using machine learning to map their vocal features to the avatar’s emotional displays.
*   **Real-time Adaptation:** Implement a feedback loop where the system monitors the user’s emotional state (e.g., using facial expression recognition) and adjusts the avatar’s emotional display accordingly.
*    **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate contextual information (e.g., the content of the speech, the environment) to refine the avatar's emotional response.

**Pseudocode (Avatar Control System):**

```
function controlAvatar(sentimentVector, avatarModel, blendShapeLibrary):
  mlpOutput = MLP(sentimentVector) // Outputs weights for blend shapes, joint angles, TTS params
  blendShapeWeights = mlpOutput.blendShapeWeights
  jointAngles = mlpOutput.jointAngles
  ttsParams = mlpOutput.ttsParams

  smoothedBlendShapeWeights = movingAverageFilter(blendShapeWeights, previousBlendShapeWeights)
  smoothedJointAngles = movingAverageFilter(jointAngles, previousJointAngles)

  applyBlendShapes(avatarModel, blendShapeLibrary, smoothedBlendShapeWeights)
  setJointAngles(avatarModel, smoothedJointAngles)
  synthesizeSpeech(ttsParams)

  previousBlendShapeWeights = smoothedBlendShapeWeights
  previousJointAngles = smoothedJointAngles
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond sentiment *detection* to sentiment *expression*. Current systems largely categorize emotion; this synthesizes a richer, more nuanced emotional output in virtual avatars. The continuous sentiment vector allows for a much wider range of emotional expressions than discrete categories. The dynamic calibration and personalization features further enhance the realism and engagement of the avatar.
