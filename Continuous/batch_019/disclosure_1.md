## Adaptive Temporal Fusion for Enhanced Detail

**Core Concept:** Extend the temporal analysis beyond immediate preceding/succeeding frames to incorporate a weighted blend of multiple past *and* future frames. This creates a more robust and contextually aware enhancement, particularly for fast-moving scenes or those with complex occlusions. The weighting isn’t static; it dynamically adjusts based on motion vectors and scene content analysis.

**Specification:**

1.  **Temporal Buffer:** Maintain a buffer of ‘N’ frames surrounding the current frame being enhanced (e.g., N=7: 3 preceding, current, 3 succeeding).

2.  **Motion Vector Analysis:** Calculate dense optical flow (motion vectors) for each frame in the buffer. This reveals the direction and magnitude of motion within the scene.

3.  **Scene Segmentation:** Employ a semantic segmentation network to categorize pixels (e.g., sky, building, person, vehicle). This provides contextual understanding.

4.  **Weight Calculation:**
    *   For each pixel in the current frame, calculate a weight for each frame in the buffer.
    *   **Motion-Based Weight:** Higher weight is assigned to frames where the corresponding pixel exhibits similar motion (based on optical flow) to the current frame. Dissimilar motion results in lower weight. A Gaussian kernel can be applied to smooth the motion difference.
    *   **Semantic Weight:** Higher weight is assigned to frames where the corresponding pixel belongs to the same semantic category as the current frame. This helps maintain consistency for static objects.
    *   **Distance Weight:** A weight decay based on the temporal distance from the current frame. Frames closer in time have a higher base weight.
    *   Combined Weight = MotionWeight * SemanticWeight * DistanceWeight. Normalize weights across the buffer to sum to 1.

5.  **Fusion Process:**
    *   For each pixel in the current frame, calculate a weighted average of the corresponding pixels in all frames within the temporal buffer, using the calculated weights.
    *   This fused pixel value becomes the input to the existing neural network enhancement pipeline.

6.  **Neural Network Adaptation:** The existing neural network should be adapted to handle the fused input. This might require retraining, but could leverage transfer learning from the existing model. Consider incorporating a ‘fusion layer’ early in the network to explicitly process the temporal information.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function EnhanceFrame(currentFrame, temporalBuffer, motionVectors, semanticSegmentation):
    fusedFrame = empty frame with same dimensions as currentFrame

    for each pixel (x, y) in currentFrame:
        weightedSum = 0
        totalWeight = 0

        for each frame in temporalBuffer:
            motionDifference = calculateMotionDifference(motionVectors[frame], pixel, x, y)
            semanticMatch = compareSemanticCategories(semanticSegmentation[frame], pixel, x, y)
            temporalDistance = calculateTemporalDistance(frame, currentFrame)

            motionWeight = gaussianKernel(motionDifference)
            semanticWeight = semanticMatch ? 1 : 0
            distanceWeight = exponentialDecay(temporalDistance)

            combinedWeight = motionWeight * semanticWeight * distanceWeight

            pixelValue = getPixelValue(frame, x, y)
            weightedSum += pixelValue * combinedWeight
            totalWeight += combinedWeight

        fusedPixelValue = weightedSum / totalWeight
        setPixelValue(fusedFrame, x, y, fusedPixelValue)

    enhancedFrame = existingNeuralNetwork(fusedFrame)
    return enhancedFrame
```

**Hardware Considerations:** This approach increases computational complexity due to the temporal buffer and weight calculations. Consider using hardware acceleration (e.g., GPUs, specialized ASICs) to handle the increased workload. Optimized memory access patterns are crucial.
