## Dynamic Data Type Propagation & Predictive Indexing

**Core Concept:** Extend the hybrid datatype indexing to *propagate* datatype awareness across linked spreadsheets/data stores, and *predictively* build/optimize indexes based on anticipated query patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Type Propagation Layer:**

*   **Component:** “Type Weaver” – a background service operating across linked spreadsheets/databases.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Monitors data entering/changing in linked spreadsheets.
    *   Analyzes data to infer dominant/potential datatypes (even if not explicitly defined). Uses statistical methods & potentially lightweight machine learning for inference.
    *   Propagates datatype information to downstream linked spreadsheets/data stores.  For instance, if Sheet A’s column X is identified as containing mostly dates, Sheet B (linked to Sheet A) receives a ‘hint’ that column X (when referenced) should be treated as a date.
    *   Handles conflicts/ambiguity by establishing a “datatype lineage” – a record of how a datatype was inferred and propagated. This allows for debugging & manual overrides.
    *   Utilizes a lightweight protocol (e.g., REST API with JSON payloads) for datatype exchange between spreadsheets/databases.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DataTypeLineage`:  `{source_spreadsheet: string, source_column: string, inferred_datatype: string, confidence_score: float, propagation_path: list[string]}`
    *   `SpreadsheetMetadata`: `{spreadsheet_id: string, columns: [{column_id: string, datatype: string, lineage: DataTypeLineage}]}`

**2. Predictive Indexing Engine:**

*   **Component:** “Index Oracle” – a service operating in parallel with spreadsheet access.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Monitors query patterns against linked spreadsheets. Stores query logs, identifying frequently accessed columns, operators (e.g., =, >, <, LIKE), and key values.
    *   Uses query logs to build a “Query Prediction Model” – a statistical or machine learning model that anticipates future queries.
    *   Based on the Query Prediction Model, proactively builds/optimizes indexes for anticipated queries.  This includes:
        *   Creating indexes for frequently queried columns.
        *   Choosing the most efficient index type (hashed, tree-based, prefix/suffix tree) based on query patterns and data distribution.
        *   Pre-calculating frequently used filter criteria.
        *   Generating “Index Blueprints” – instructions for building and maintaining indexes.
    *   Integrates with the Type Weaver to leverage datatype information for optimized indexing.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `QueryLogEntry`: `{spreadsheet_id: string, column_id: string, operator: string, key_value: string, timestamp: datetime}`
    *   `QueryPredictionModel`:  (implementation details vary - could be a Markov model, decision tree, or neural network).  Outputs a probability distribution over future queries.
    *   `IndexBlueprint`: `{column_id: string, index_type: string, filter_criteria: list[tuple(field, value)]}`

**3.  Dynamic Index Update Mechanism:**

*   Monitors data changes in linked spreadsheets (via event listeners or polling).
*   When a significant data change occurs, the Index Oracle re-evaluates the Query Prediction Model and updates indexes accordingly.
*   Implements a tiered update strategy:
    *   **Incremental Updates:**  For minor data changes, update existing indexes incrementally.
    *   **Rebuilds:** For major data changes or model shifts, rebuild indexes from scratch.
    *   **Checkpointing:** Periodically create checkpoints of index data to enable fast recovery from failures.

**Pseudocode (Index Oracle - Simplified):**

```
function processQueryLog(queryLogEntry):
  update query frequency for column in queryLogEntry
  update query prediction model

function updateIndexes():
  for each column:
    predictedQueryFrequency = queryPredictionModel.predictFrequency(column)
    if predictedQueryFrequency > threshold:
      if column does not have an index:
        createIndex(column, chooseIndexType(column))
      else:
        optimizeIndex(column)
```
