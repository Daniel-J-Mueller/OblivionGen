## Dynamic Traffic Shaping via Predictive AI & Edge Computing

**Concept:** Shift from reactive rate limiting to *proactive* traffic shaping utilizing localized AI models running on network devices (edge computing) to *predict* potential congestion *before* it happens, dynamically adjusting traffic flow characteristics (beyond simple rate limiting) to optimize network performance and user experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. AI Model – Predictive Congestion Engine (PCE):**

*   **Type:**  Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.  LSTM is preferred for its ability to learn long-term dependencies in time series data.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time traffic rate measurements *from the network device itself* (as per the provided patent’s foundation).
    *   Historical traffic patterns – aggregated and anonymized, stored locally on the network device (rolling 7-day window).
    *   Network topology information – limited to immediate neighbors (upstream/downstream devices).
    *   Application-level hints (if available) – QoS markings, application type (e.g., video streaming, web browsing).
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Predicted congestion level (0-100 scale).
    *   Recommended traffic shaping parameters (see Section 2).
*   **Training:** Initial model trained centrally (cloud) with large-scale network data. Continuous local refinement via federated learning – each device trains on its own data and shares model updates with the central server (preserving privacy).

**2. Traffic Shaping Parameters:**

Beyond simple rate limiting, the system should support:

*   **Priority Queuing:** Assign different priorities to traffic based on application type or user.
*   **Delay Budgeting:**  Dynamically adjust allowable delay for different traffic flows. (Critical for real-time applications).
*   **Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) Modulation:**  Intelligently modulate ECN markings to encourage senders to reduce their transmission rate *before* congestion occurs.
*   **Packet Scheduling:** Implement advanced packet scheduling algorithms (e.g., Weighted Fair Queuing, Deficit Round Robin) to optimize resource allocation.
*    **Flow Isolation**:  Create logical 'lanes' for traffic flows to prevent interference.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Distributed Intelligence:** AI models run *directly on* network devices (routers, switches, firewalls) – no reliance on centralized control.
*   **Edge Computing:** Data processing and decision-making occur locally, minimizing latency and bandwidth requirements.
*   **Federated Learning:**  Model updates are shared between devices and a central server, enabling continuous improvement without compromising privacy.
*   **API Integration:**  Open API for integration with existing network management systems and orchestration platforms.
*   **Secure Enclave:**  AI models and sensitive data are protected by a secure enclave on the network device.

**4. Pseudocode (Network Device – PCE Operation):**

```
// Initialization
Load Pre-trained PCE Model
Initialize Historical Data Buffer

// Main Loop
While (Network Operational) {
    // Collect Data
    traffic_rate = GetCurrentTrafficRate()
    historical_data = GetHistoricalTrafficData()
    topology_info = GetTopologyInfo()
    application_hints = GetApplicationHints()

    // Predict Congestion
    congestion_level = PCE_Model.Predict(traffic_rate, historical_data, topology_info, application_hints)

    // Determine Traffic Shaping Parameters
    IF (congestion_level > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
        priority_queueing_enabled = TRUE
        delay_budget_reduced = TRUE
        ecn_modulation_increased = TRUE
    } ELSE IF (congestion_level > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
        priority_queueing_enabled = FALSE
        delay_budget_reduced = FALSE
        ecn_modulation_increased = FALSE
    }

    // Apply Traffic Shaping
    ApplyTrafficShaping(priority_queueing_enabled, delay_budget_reduced, ecn_modulation_increased)

    // Update Historical Data
    UpdateHistoricalDataBuffer(traffic_rate)
}
```

**5. Novelty & Potential:**

This approach moves beyond *reacting* to congestion to *anticipating* and *preventing* it.  By leveraging localized AI and edge computing, it offers significant advantages in terms of latency, scalability, and resilience. The combination of predictive modeling and dynamic traffic shaping allows for a more granular and proactive approach to network optimization, leading to improved user experience and resource utilization.  It moves the goalposts to a proactive stance, which may lend itself to more aggressive innovation downstream.
