## Adaptive Packet Steering via Predictive Load Modeling

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Instead of *reacting* to load imbalances (as the provided patent does), proactively *predict* them using a time-series model.  This allows for 'steering' packets *before* a host becomes overloaded, and distributing load based on predicted future capacity, not current capacity.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Load History Collectors (LHC):**  Deployed on each host, collecting granular load metrics (CPU, memory, bandwidth, active connections *per application component*) at short intervals (e.g., 100ms).  These are *not* just reporting current load, but maintaining a time-stamped history (e.g., 5 minutes).
2.  **Predictive Load Model (PLM):** A centralized service.  Each hostâ€™s LHC feeds its historical data into the PLM. The PLM employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to *predict* load on each host, for each application component, over a configurable time horizon (e.g., 5 seconds, 10 seconds). This horizon is critical; it must be long enough to allow packets to be re-routed, but short enough to maintain accuracy.
3.  **Steering Controller (SC):**  Resides within the load balancer infrastructure. It interfaces with the PLM, receiving predicted load data.  The SC then calculates a 'steering score' for each host, based on predicted available capacity.
4.  **Packet Interceptors (PI):** Placed *before* the traditional load balancer.  Incoming packets are intercepted. The PI queries the SC for the host with the highest steering score. The PI then *modifies* the destination IP/port (or relevant header fields) of the packet to direct it to the selected host *before* it reaches the standard load balancer.  This requires careful coordination to avoid routing loops.
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The LHCs also monitor actual load on the hosts *after* the packets are steered. This actual load data is fed back into the PLM to refine its predictions, improving accuracy over time.

**III. Operation:**

1.  Incoming packet arrives.
2.  Packet Interceptor intercepts the packet.
3.  PI queries Steering Controller for best host.
4.  SC requests predicted load data from PLM.
5.  PLM provides predicted load.
6.  SC calculates steering score.
7.  SC returns best host to PI.
8.  PI modifies packet destination (IP/port) to direct to selected host.
9.  Modified packet is forwarded to the host.
10. Host processes packet.
11. LHC on host collects load data and feeds it back to PLM.

**IV. Pseudocode (Steering Controller):**

```
function calculate_steering_score(host, predicted_load):
  // 'base_capacity' is a pre-configured value representing the host's max capacity
  available_capacity = base_capacity - predicted_load
  
  // Apply a penalty for high predicted load. This prevents steering *all* traffic to one host.
  penalty = 0
  if predicted_load > 0.8 * base_capacity:
    penalty = 0.5 // Scale this as needed

  steering_score = available_capacity * (1 - penalty)
  return steering_score

function get_best_host(packet):
  // Query PLM for predicted load on all hosts
  predicted_loads = PLM.get_predicted_loads()

  best_host = null
  max_steering_score = -1

  for host in predicted_loads:
    steering_score = calculate_steering_score(host, predicted_loads[host])
    if steering_score > max_steering_score:
      max_steering_score = steering_score
      best_host = host

  return best_host
```

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Model Selection:** The choice of time-series model (Prophet, LSTM, ARIMA) will heavily impact prediction accuracy.
*   **Data Synchronization:** Ensuring consistent and timely data flow between LHCs, PLM, and SC is crucial.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** Implement a fallback to the standard load balancer in case of PLM failure or inaccurate predictions.
*   **Application Component Awareness:** The system must be aware of different application components running on each host to steer traffic to the most appropriate one.
*   **Dynamic Capacity Adjustment:**  The `base_capacity` value may need to be dynamically adjusted based on real-time host performance.
