## Dynamic Contextual Payload Morphing

**Concept:** Extend vulnerability scanning beyond simple escape detection by dynamically morphing payloads based on observed contextual responses. The system doesn’t just look *for* escape, it *tests* how the application *reacts* to subtly altered payloads designed to exploit potential weaknesses revealed in the response.

**Specifications:**

**1. Payload Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Reference string, first context, escape attempt database (as per the patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   Initial Payload: Select base escape attempt input from database.
    *   Contextual Analysis: Analyze the *first response* for dynamic elements – Javascript functions, server-side includes, data tables, forms – anything indicating dynamic behavior.
    *   Morphing Rules: Generate a set of ‘morphing rules’ based on the analysis.  Examples:
        *   If Javascript is present: Inject Javascript-compatible encoding/decoding into the payload.
        *   If a form is present:  Morph the payload into valid form input (e.g., a seemingly harmless name, address, or email) while embedding the escape attempt.
        *   If a data table is detected: Format payload as a valid data row/column entry.
        *   If server-side includes are present: Encode payload using the expected include syntax (e.g. PHP include, SSI).
    *   Payload Variation:  Generate *multiple* payload variations by applying different combinations of morphing rules.
*   **Output:** A set of contextually morphed payload variations.

**2. Dynamic Response Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Initial first response, set of morphed payloads, second response.
*   **Process:**
    *   Payload Submission: Submit each morphed payload to the network service.
    *   Response Comparison:  Analyze the second response for changes *compared* to the initial first response. This isn’t just about detecting the escaped input, but observing *how* the application changed in response to the altered payload. Examples:
        *   Error messages (even seemingly benign ones)
        *   Changes in page layout.
        *   Javascript execution.
        *   Network requests (look for unusual or unexpected requests).
    *   Anomaly Detection: Use statistical anomaly detection to identify statistically significant differences between responses. This helps identify subtle vulnerabilities that might be missed by simple escape detection.
*   **Output:**  A ‘response anomaly score’ for each payload variation, indicating the likelihood of a vulnerability.

**3. Adaptive Learning Module:**

*   **Input:**  Response anomaly scores, successful/unsuccessful escape attempts, contextual information.
*   **Process:**
    *   Reinforcement Learning: Use reinforcement learning to refine the morphing rules. Payloads that trigger higher anomaly scores are ‘rewarded’, encouraging the system to generate similar payloads in the future.
    *   Contextual Rule Generation: Build a database of contextual rules mapping specific contexts to effective morphing strategies.  For example: “If context is a PHP form, use URL encoding and newline injection.”
*   **Output:**  Updated morphing rules and contextual rule database.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function scan(referenceString, firstContext, firstResponse):
  payloads = generatePayloads(referenceString, firstContext)
  for payload in payloads:
    morphedPayload = applyContextualMorphing(payload, firstResponse)
    secondResponse = sendRequest(morphedPayload)
    anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(firstResponse, secondResponse)
    if anomalyScore > threshold:
      reportVulnerability(morphedPayload, anomalyScore)
      updateLearningModel(morphedPayload, anomalyScore)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   High-performance CPU for analyzing responses.
*   Sufficient memory to store multiple responses and learning models.
*   Scalable architecture to handle multiple concurrent scans.
*   Machine learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch) for reinforcement learning.
*   Network proxy to intercept and modify requests.
