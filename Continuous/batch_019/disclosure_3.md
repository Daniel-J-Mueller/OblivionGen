## Personalized Affect-Driven Recommendation Augmentation

**Core Concept:** Augment existing recommendation systems with real-time affective state detection and incorporate this data into both user representation *and* item representation, creating a dynamically shifting recommendation landscape tailored not just to what a user *does*, but how they *feel* while doing it.

**Motivation:** The patent focuses on multi-channel inputs to predict future events. This is valuable, but lacks a crucial element: the user's *emotional state*. Emotions heavily influence decision-making, and ignoring them creates a sterile, potentially ineffective recommendation engine.  This system moves beyond predicting what a user *will* do, to understanding *why* they might do it *now*, based on real-time feeling.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Affective Sensing Module:**
    *   **Input:** Multi-modal data stream: Webcam (facial expression analysis), microphone (speech prosody & content analysis), wearable sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance).
    *   **Processing:**  Employ a pre-trained, continuously fine-tuned emotion recognition model (e.g., utilizing transformers for temporal sequence analysis). Output: Vector representing current affective state: [Valence (positive/negative), Arousal (calm/excited), Dominance (in control/submissive)].  Update frequency: 5-10 Hz.
    *   **Hardware:** Requires webcam, microphone, and compatible wearable devices. Edge computing preferred for low latency.

2.  **Dynamic User Representation Update:**
    *   **Baseline:** Existing user representation from the patent’s system (event history, preferences, etc.).
    *   **Augmentation:**  Append the affective state vector to the user representation *at each interaction*. This creates a time-series representation of user emotion *while* engaging with recommendations.  Weighted summation can be used to control the influence of affective data.
    *   **Pseudocode:**
        ```
        user_representation = existing_user_representation
        affective_state = get_affective_state()
        weighted_affective_state = affective_state * affective_weight  // Affective Weight is a tunable parameter
        user_representation = concatenate(user_representation, weighted_affective_state)
        ```

3.  **Affective Item Tagging:**
    *   **Method:** Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate "affective tags" for each item in the catalog. This involves prompting the LLM with item descriptions *and* example emotional responses.
    *   **Example Prompt:** “Describe the likely emotional experience of a user interacting with [item description]. Include feelings such as joy, excitement, relaxation, frustration, or boredom.  Output a vector of emotional intensities: [Joy, Excitement, Relaxation, Frustration, Boredom].”
    *   **Output:** Each item gains an "affective profile" – a vector representing the emotions it's likely to evoke. Store alongside existing item metadata.

4.  **Recommendation Algorithm Modification:**
    *   **Similarity Metric:**  Replace standard similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity) with an "affective compatibility" score. This score considers both the user’s current affective state *and* the item’s affective profile.
    *   **Formula:**
        ```
        affective_compatibility = dot_product(user_affective_state, item_affective_profile)
        recommendation_score = (standard_similarity * standard_weight) + (affective_compatibility * affective_weight)
        ```
        (Tunable weights control the relative influence of standard similarity and affective compatibility).
    *   **Filtering & Ranking:**  Rank items based on the combined recommendation score. Implement filtering to avoid recommending items likely to induce negative emotions (e.g., frustration) when the user is already in a negative state.

5.  **Adaptive Learning Loop:**
    *   **Feedback Mechanism:** Collect implicit feedback (e.g., dwell time, click-through rate) *and* explicit feedback (e.g., emotional ratings of recommendations).
    *   **Model Updates:** Use this feedback to continuously refine:
        *   The emotion recognition model.
        *   The LLM generating affective tags.
        *   The tunable weights in the recommendation algorithm.
