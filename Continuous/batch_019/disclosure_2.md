## Dynamic Granularity Time-Series Compression with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Concept:** Extend the coefficient grouping and prioritization concepts to incorporate a predictive pre-fetch mechanism that dynamically adjusts the granularity (detail level) of transmitted data based on anticipated user/system needs *before* a request is even made.  This anticipates the ‘zoom level’ a user might want to examine, or the level of detail a monitoring system requires, reducing latency and bandwidth usage.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structure – Multi-Resolution Coefficient Tree:**

*   Instead of fixed coefficient groups (approximation, detail 1, detail 2), implement a tree-like structure where each node represents a different level of detail.  The root node is the coarsest approximation, and each child node adds progressively more detail via wavelet or similar transform.
*   Each node stores *quantized* coefficient data, like in the patent, but also a ‘confidence score’ indicating the likelihood this data will be requested.
*   Each node also contains metadata:  timestamp range, data source ID, and a flag indicating whether it's been transmitted.

**2. Predictive Engine:**

*   A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) trained on historical data access patterns.  This model predicts which parts of the time-series data will be requested based on:
    *   Time of day/week/month.
    *   User profiles (if applicable).
    *   System events (e.g., alerts, anomalies detected by other monitoring systems).
    *   Recent access history.
*   The predictive engine calculates a ‘request probability’ for each node in the Multi-Resolution Coefficient Tree.
*   This probability is used to dynamically adjust the ‘confidence score’ stored within each node.

**3. Dynamic Compression & Transmission:**

*   A ‘Transmission Manager’ continuously monitors the confidence scores of nodes.
*   Nodes exceeding a defined confidence threshold are proactively transmitted to the client (or stored in a pre-fetch cache).
*   Compression (quantization, encoding) is applied *before* transmission. The compression level can also be dynamically adjusted based on bandwidth availability and client capabilities.
*   If a client *does* request data that hasn't been pre-fetched, a standard request/response cycle occurs. However, the Transmission Manager uses this request to refine its predictive model.

**4.  Data Synchronization & Cache Management:**

*   Implement a versioning system for coefficient data. Clients store the version of the data they have.
*   The server only transmits data that has changed or is new since the client’s last update.
*   Clients maintain a local cache of pre-fetched coefficient data.  The cache is managed using an LRU (Least Recently Used) or similar algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Transmission Manager):**

```
function process_tree(root_node):
  for each node in tree (depth-first):
    if node.confidence_score > threshold:
      compress_data(node.coefficient_data)
      transmit_data(compressed_data)
      node.transmitted = True

function handle_client_request(request):
  requested_data = get_data(request)
  if requested_data is null or not requested_data.transmitted:
    compress_data(requested_data.coefficient_data)
    transmit_data(compressed_data)
    requested_data.transmitted = True

  transmit_data(requested_data)
  update_predictive_model(request)

function update_predictive_model(request):
  # Train model based on this request and past access patterns
  # Adjust confidence scores of nodes in the tree
  pass
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency – data is often available before it’s requested.
*   Bandwidth savings – only necessary data is transmitted.
*   Improved user experience – faster response times.
*   Scalability – proactive data transmission can reduce server load.
