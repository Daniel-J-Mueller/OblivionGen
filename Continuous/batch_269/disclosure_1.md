## Federated Identity Attestation with Ephemeral Credentials

**Concept:** Extend the authentication flow to incorporate a trust network where identity claims are not directly transferred but *attested* to by multiple independent services. This creates a more robust and privacy-preserving system compared to relying on a single authentication provider.

**Specification:**

**1. Components:**

*   **Requester:** The application needing authentication.
*   **Attestors:** Independent services holding partial identity information or trust relationships (e.g., corporate directory, social login provider, device trust authority).
*   **Credential Broker:** A central service coordinating attestations and issuing ephemeral credentials.
*   **Client Device:** The user's device initiating the authentication request.

**2. Flow:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** The Requester receives a request. It forwards the request to the Credential Broker.
2.  **Attestation Request:** The Credential Broker generates a unique 'Attestation Challenge' and sends it to the Client Device.
3.  **Attestor Interaction:** The Client Device presents the challenge to designated Attestors (determined by the Requester's configuration).  Each Attestor independently verifies its associated identity claim.
4.  **Signed Attestation Fragments:**  Each Attestor returns a digitally signed ‘Attestation Fragment’ to the Client Device. The fragment contains the attested claim, the Attestor's ID, and a timestamp.
5.  **Fragment Aggregation:** The Client Device aggregates all Attestation Fragments into a single ‘Attestation Bundle’.
6.  **Bundle Submission:** The Client Device submits the Attestation Bundle to the Credential Broker.
7.  **Verification & Credential Issuance:** The Credential Broker verifies the signatures on all fragments against known Attestor public keys. Upon successful verification, it issues a short-lived, scoped ‘Ephemeral Credential’ to the Client Device.
8.  **Credential Presentation:** The Client Device presents the Ephemeral Credential to the Requester. The Requester can verify the credential's signature and validity period.

**3. Data Structures:**

*   **Attestation Challenge:**  {Challenge ID (UUID), Timestamp, Requester ID, Attestor List}
*   **Attestation Fragment:** {Attestor ID, Claim (e.g., “user@example.com”, “device trusted”), Signature (using Attestor’s private key), Timestamp, Challenge ID}
*   **Attestation Bundle:** {List of Attestation Fragments, Client Device ID}
*   **Ephemeral Credential:** {Credential ID (UUID), User ID, Scoped Permissions, Signature (using Credential Broker’s private key), Validity Period}

**4. Pseudocode (Credential Broker):**

```
function verifyAttestationBundle(bundle, attestationList):
  for fragment in bundle.fragments:
    if not verifySignature(fragment.signature, attestationList[fragment.attestorID].publicKey):
      return false
  return true

function issueEphemeralCredential(bundle, userID, permissions, validityPeriod):
  credentialID = generateUUID()
  credential = {
    credentialID: credentialID,
    userID: userID,
    permissions: permissions,
    signature: sign(credential, brokerPrivateKey),
    validityPeriod: validityPeriod
  }
  return credential
```

**5. Enhancements:**

*   **Threshold Attestation:** Require a certain number of Attestors to sign before issuing a credential.
*   **Revocation List:**  Maintain a list of revoked Attestors.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**  Use ZKPs to prove claims without revealing underlying data.
*   **Blockchain Integration:** Use a blockchain for tamper-proof storage of Attestor public keys and revocation lists.
