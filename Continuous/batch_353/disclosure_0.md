## Dynamic Metric Weighting Based on Network Topology Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the existing monitoring system by incorporating network topology awareness and dynamically weighting metrics based on the monitored agent's position and role within the network. The goal is to improve the accuracy of degradation detection and reduce false positives by understanding the expected load and behavior of agents based on their location.

**Specs:**

**1. Topology Discovery Module:**

*   **Function:** Automatically discover and map the network topology.
*   **Method:** Utilize existing network protocols (e.g., LLDP, CDP, SNMP) or employ active probing techniques.  Create a dependency graph representing the relationships between network devices and monitoring agents.
*   **Output:** A dynamic network topology map stored as a graph data structure (e.g., adjacency list, adjacency matrix).  Nodes represent network devices and monitoring agents. Edges represent network connections and dependencies.

**2. Role Assignment Module:**

*   **Function:** Assign a "role" to each monitoring agent based on its position in the topology and the devices it monitors.
*   **Roles (examples):**
    *   *Core Agent:* Monitors critical core network devices.
    *   *Edge Agent:* Monitors devices at the network edge (e.g., access points, IoT devices).
    *   *Distribution Agent:* Monitors devices in the distribution layer.
    *   *End-Point Agent:* Monitors individual end-user devices.
*   **Method:** Rule-based system or machine learning model trained on network topology and device characteristics.

**3. Dynamic Metric Weighting Engine:**

*   **Function:** Calculate a weight for each metric based on the agent's role and the current network conditions.
*   **Input:**
    *   Agent role
    *   Current network load (e.g., bandwidth utilization, latency)
    *   Metric type (high confidence, low confidence)
    *   Historical metric data
*   **Method:** 
    *   Define a base weight for each metric based on its inherent importance.
    *   Adjust the weight based on the agent’s role. For example:
        *   Core agents: Higher weight for metrics related to packet loss and latency.
        *   Edge agents: Higher weight for metrics related to device responsiveness and connection stability.
    *   Dynamically adjust the weight based on current network conditions. For example, if network bandwidth is heavily congested, increase the weight of latency metrics.
*   **Output:** A weighted score for each metric.

**4. Degradation Determination Logic:**

*   **Function:** Determine if an agent is degraded based on the weighted scores.
*   **Method:**
    *   Calculate an overall degradation score by summing the weighted scores.
    *   Compare the overall score to a threshold. The threshold may be static or dynamic, based on historical data.
    *   Use the same logic as existing patent – one high confidence metric outside threshold *or* two low confidence metrics outside thresholds, adjusted for the weights.

**5. System Integration:**

*   Integrate the modules into the existing monitoring system.
*   Provide a dashboard to visualize the network topology, agent roles, metric weights, and degradation scores.

**Pseudocode (Degradation Determination Logic):**

```
function determine_degradation(agent, metrics, topology_map):
    agent_role = get_agent_role(agent, topology_map)
    weighted_scores = calculate_weighted_scores(metrics, agent_role)

    high_confidence_score = weighted_scores.high_confidence
    low_confidence_scores = weighted_scores.low_confidence

    if high_confidence_score > high_confidence_threshold:
        return "DEGRADED"

    if len(low_confidence_scores) >= 2:
        outlier_count = 0
        for score in low_confidence_scores:
            if score > low_confidence_threshold:
                outlier_count += 1
        if outlier_count >= 2:
            # Check if the outliers are common across other agents
            if are_outliers_unique_to_agent(agent, low_confidence_scores):
                return "DEGRADED"

    return "HEALTHY"
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Machine Learning:** Use machine learning to predict network behavior and dynamically adjust metric weights.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Incorporate anomaly detection techniques to identify unusual patterns in metric data.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Integrate with root cause analysis tools to automatically identify the underlying cause of degradation.
