## Dynamic Environmental Storytelling via Object-Triggered Ambience

**Concept:** Expand beyond product identification to create immersive environmental experiences *within* the video itself, triggered by identified objects. Rather than simply linking to purchase, the system alters the audio and visual ambience based on the objects detected.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Ambience Database:** A comprehensive database linking object classifications (from existing image/text recognition) to pre-designed ambience profiles.  These profiles contain:
    *   Audio Mixes:  Soundscapes, music, and sound effects (e.g., detecting a coffee cup triggers a cafe ambience, a forest scene triggers bird song and wind).
    *   Visual Filters:  Color grading, subtle particle effects (e.g., detecting a beach scene applies a warm filter and adds seagulls, detecting a cityscape applies a cool filter and adds distant siren sounds).
    *   Dynamic Lighting:  Adjustments to brightness, contrast, and color temperature to match the scene.

2.  **Object-Ambience Mapping Logic:**
    *   Object Classification: Utilize the existing image/text recognition to classify objects within each frame.
    *   Ambience Selection: Based on object classification, select an appropriate ambience profile from the database.  Profiles can be layered - detecting both a "fireplace" *and* "snow" could trigger a cozy winter scene ambience.
    *   Transition Smoothing: Implement a smooth transition between ambience profiles to avoid jarring changes. Crossfading audio and applying subtle visual blending.
    *   Contextual Priority:  Logic to prioritize ambience profiles based on object prominence (time on screen, size in frame) and scene context (e.g., a brief flash of a product in a busy scene shouldnâ€™t override the overall ambience).

3.  **User Customization:**
    *   Ambience Intensity Slider: Allows the user to adjust the strength of the ambience effects.
    *   Ambience Profile Selection:  Provides the user with pre-defined ambience themes or the ability to create their own custom themes.
    *   Object-Specific Ambience Override: Allows the user to assign custom ambience profiles to specific objects.

4.  **System Architecture:**

    ```pseudocode
    function processFrame(frame):
      objects = objectDetection(frame)
      ambienceProfiles = selectAmbienceProfiles(objects)
      filteredFrame = applyVisualFilters(frame, ambienceProfiles)
      mixedAudio = mixAudio(frame.audio, ambienceProfiles)
      return filteredFrame, mixedAudio

    function selectAmbienceProfiles(objects):
      profiles = []
      for object in objects:
        profile = ambienceDatabase.lookup(object.classification)
        if profile:
          profiles.append(profile)
      // Prioritize profiles based on object prominence
      prioritizedProfiles = prioritizeProfiles(profiles)
      return prioritizedProfiles
    ```

5.  **Advanced Features:**

    *   **Procedural Ambience Generation:** Employ AI to *generate* unique ambience profiles on the fly, based on object classification and scene context.
    *   **Spatial Audio Integration:** Utilize spatial audio to create a more immersive soundscape, with sounds emanating from the identified objects' locations within the video frame.
    *   **Haptic Feedback Integration:**  For devices with haptic feedback capabilities, provide subtle vibrations synchronized with the ambience and identified objects.
