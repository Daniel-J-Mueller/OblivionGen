## Adaptive Haptic Character Grid

**Concept:** Expand the multi-directional input concept into a dynamically reconfigurable haptic grid overlaid on a display. Instead of visual highlighting, *feel* guides selection.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Transparent, high-resolution display (OLED or similar) with integrated micro-actuator array beneath the surface. Actuators must be capable of rapidly creating localized tactile feedback – small bumps, depressions, or vibrations.
    *   Multi-directional input device (trackball, touchpad, or similar) for coarse positioning.
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time haptic rendering.
*   **Software:**
    *   Character Grid: Similar to the patent’s second matrix, organizing letters, numbers, symbols into logical groupings.
    *   Haptic Map Generator:  Algorithm dynamically creates a ‘height map’ representing the character grid. Each character in the grid is assigned a haptic ‘intensity’ value – how strongly it’s represented by the actuators.  Grouping logic influences intensity – frequently used letter combinations have higher intensity.
    *   Swipe-to-Feel Engine:  Receives input from the multi-directional device. Translates the swipe angle and magnitude into a ‘scan’ across the haptic map.
    *   Actuator Control System:  Drives the micro-actuator array to create the haptic landscape.
    *   Adaptive Learning Module: Tracks user selections and adapts the haptic map to prioritize frequently used characters and character combinations.

**Operation:**

1.  The character grid is displayed on the transparent screen. The haptic map is generated beneath.
2.  The user initiates a swipe on the multi-directional input device.
3.  The Swipe-to-Feel Engine scans the haptic map based on the swipe parameters.
4.  The Actuator Control System drives the micro-actuators, creating a tactile ‘ridge’ or ‘valley’ corresponding to the characters aligned with the swipe path. The user *feels* the characters under their finger.
5.  The user can refine the selection with subtle movements, ‘sliding’ along the tactile ridge.
6.  A click or other gesture confirms the selection.
7.  The Adaptive Learning Module updates the haptic map based on the selection.

**Pseudocode (Swipe-to-Feel Engine):**

```
function processSwipe(swipeAngle, swipeMagnitude):
    hapticMap = getHapticMap()
    scanResolution = 10 //Number of points to sample along the scan path
    scanPath = generateScanPath(swipeAngle, swipeMagnitude, scanResolution)

    for each point in scanPath:
        x, y = point.coordinates
        hapticIntensity = hapticMap.getIntensity(x, y)
        outputActuatorSignal(x, y, hapticIntensity * swipeMagnitude) //Magnitutde scales intensity
    end for
end function
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   Variable actuator density: Higher density in frequently used areas.
*   Customizable haptic profiles: Users can define the 'feel' of different character types.
*   Integration with predictive text: Use predictive text to influence haptic map intensity.
*   Multi-finger support: Allow users to ‘feel’ multiple characters simultaneously.
