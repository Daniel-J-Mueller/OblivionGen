## Dynamic Character “Echolocation” for Immersive Storytelling

**Concept:** Extend the character voice/presentation concept to incorporate environmental audio cues *influenced by* character identity and emotional state, creating a sonic "echolocation" effect that enhances immersion and provides subtle narrative information.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A “Sonic Profile Generator” module. This module analyzes character identity attributes (gender, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, emotional state – derived from text or explicitly defined) and generates a unique set of audio processing parameters.
*   **Parameter Set:** This set includes:
    *   Reverb characteristics (size, decay, pre-delay) - simulating the character’s perceived acoustic space. A character from a vast, open landscape would have a longer reverb tail than one confined to a crowded city.
    *   EQ curves – emphasizing frequencies associated with the character's voice and typical environments.  A character accustomed to harsh, industrial noise might have attenuated high frequencies.
    *   Spatial audio parameters – defining the direction and distance of sounds “perceived” by the character.
    *   “Echo Density” –  controlling the frequency and intensity of subtle echoes, linked to the character’s mental state.  An anxious character might have more frequent, fragmented echoes.
*   **Environmental Audio Engine:** An engine that processes all ambient sounds *as if* they are being “heard” through the Sonic Profile.  Instead of direct audio playback, sounds are filtered, reverberated, and spatially adjusted based on the active character profile.  This applies to all sounds: music, environmental effects (wind, rain), and even other character voices.
*   **Character-Specific “Sonic Bloom”:** When a character *speaks* or experiences a strong emotional moment, a short, layered audio cue (“Sonic Bloom”) is triggered – a quick burst of the processed ambient sounds combined with subtle musical elements. This reinforces the character’s identity and emotional state.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** The Sonic Profile Generator should integrate seamlessly with the existing character voice selection and presentation system.  Character identity attributes are passed to the Sonic Profile Generator, which outputs the audio processing parameters to the Environmental Audio Engine.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to adjust the intensity of the “echolocation” effect, or to create custom Sonic Profiles for characters.

**Pseudocode (Environmental Audio Engine):**

```
function process_audio_sample(audio_sample, character_profile):
  reverb_params = character_profile.reverb
  eq_curve = character_profile.eq
  spatial_params = character_profile.spatial

  filtered_sample = apply_eq(audio_sample, eq_curve)
  reverberated_sample = apply_reverb(filtered_sample, reverb_params)
  spatially_positioned_sample = apply_spatial_audio(reverberated_sample, spatial_params)

  return spatially_positioned_sample
```

**Example Scenario:**

A character accustomed to living in a dense forest enters a sterile, modern laboratory. The Environmental Audio Engine processes the lab sounds (humming machinery, echoing footsteps) through the character’s forest-tuned Sonic Profile. The result is a distorted, unsettling sonic experience – the lab sounds are muffled, reverberate oddly, and lack the natural ambient textures the character expects. This subtly communicates the character’s disorientation and alienation.
