## Modular Rack Cooling & Power Spine

**Concept:** Integrate power distribution and active cooling directly into a structural “spine” running the height of the rack, offering significantly increased density and redundancy, and facilitating hot-swap capability for both power and cooling modules.

**Specifications:**

*   **Spine Structure:** Extruded aluminum alloy, full height of standard rack unit (7ft/2.1m), with mounting rails compatible with standard 19” equipment. Spine incorporates internal channels for power and coolant distribution.
*   **Power Modules:**
    *   Hot-swappable modules, each providing 2-4kW of power.
    *   Multiple modules can be stacked within the spine to scale power capacity.
    *   Input: Standard AC power. Output: Multiple C13/C19 receptacles.
    *   Integrated power monitoring (voltage, current, power) per outlet.
    *   Redundant power feeds to each module.
*   **Cooling Modules:**
    *   Hot-swappable liquid cooling modules, utilizing a closed-loop system.
    *   Each module incorporates a microchannel cold plate and pump.
    *   Coolant: Dielectric fluid.
    *   Multiple modules distributed along spine height.
    *   Connections: Quick-disconnect fittings for coolant lines.
    *   Integrated temperature sensors and flow rate monitoring.
*   **Equipment Interface:**
    *   Standard 19” mounting brackets for server chassis.
    *   Brackets incorporate integrated coolant channels and electrical connectors.
    *   Coolant lines and power cables connect to equipment via quick-disconnect fittings.
*   **Redundancy:**
    *   N+1 redundancy for both power and cooling modules.
    *   Automatic failover to redundant modules in case of failure.
    *   Redundant coolant pumps and power supplies.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Integrated web-based management interface.
    *   Remote monitoring and control of power and cooling parameters.
    *   Alerts and notifications for critical events.
    *   Automated power capping and cooling optimization.

**Pseudocode - Cooling Loop Control:**

```
// Define parameters
float targetTemperature = 25.0; // Celsius
float hysteresis = 2.0; // Celsius
float pumpSpeedMin = 20.0; // %
float pumpSpeedMax = 100.0; // %

// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Read temperature sensors
    float currentTemperature = readTemperatureSensor();

    // Calculate pump speed
    float pumpSpeed = map(currentTemperature, targetTemperature - hysteresis, targetTemperature + hysteresis, pumpSpeedMax, pumpSpeedMin);

    // Constrain pump speed
    pumpSpeed = constrain(pumpSpeed, pumpSpeedMin, pumpSpeedMax);

    // Set pump speed
    setPumpSpeed(pumpSpeed);

    // Log data
    logData(currentTemperature, pumpSpeed);

    // Wait
    delay(1000);
}
```

**Manufacturing Considerations:**

*   Spine to be manufactured from high-grade aluminum alloy.
*   Modules to be assembled using standardized components.
*   Quick-disconnect fittings to be robust and leak-proof.
*   Extensive testing and quality control procedures.
