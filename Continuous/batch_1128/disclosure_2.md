## Adaptive VPN Session 'Shadowing' with Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Extend the eventual consistency model to proactively 'shadow' active VPN sessions across multiple geographically diverse VPN appliances. This isn't simply failover, but *concurrent* session maintenance with intelligent traffic steering based on predicted network conditions and appliance health.

**Specifications:**

**1. Session Shadowing Module:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for replicating VPN session state (parameters from claim 2, and potentially claim 12 â€“ cryptographic data, ESP, port data, sequence data, session identifiers) to a designated 'shadow' appliance in a different geographic region.
*   **Trigger:** Initiated upon initial VPN session establishment, configurable per-session or globally.
*   **Replication Method:** Utilizes the eventual consistency database as the source of truth. Shadow appliance periodically polls or subscribes to changes.  Difference detection and efficient delta transfer are crucial.
*   **State Synchronization:** Implement a mechanism for real-time (or near real-time) synchronization of in-flight traffic state.  This is *not* full state replication, but crucial data for seamless transition (e.g., sequence numbers, ongoing key exchange).

**2. Predictive Network Analysis Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time network latency/jitter data between client, primary appliance, and shadow appliance.
    *   Historical network performance data.
    *   Appliance health metrics (CPU, memory, bandwidth).
    *   Geopolitical/environmental factors affecting network infrastructure.
*   **Analysis:** Employ machine learning models to predict potential network disruptions or appliance failures.  Outputs a 'risk score' for each appliance and network path.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:**  Based on the risk score, dynamically adjust the weighting of traffic steered to the primary versus shadow appliance.  Initially, all traffic goes to the primary.  As risk increases, gradually shift traffic to the shadow.

**3. Traffic Steering Mechanism:**

*   **Client-Side Integration:** Ideally, integrate with VPN client software to allow the client to be aware of both primary and shadow appliances.  This allows for direct connection negotiation.
*   **DNS-Based Steering:**  If client integration is not feasible, use DNS records to point clients to the optimal appliance based on the risk score.
*   **Load Balancing Integration:**  Leverage existing load balancing infrastructure to distribute traffic intelligently.
*   **Seamless Transition:** Implement a mechanism for gracefully switching traffic between appliances without interrupting the VPN session. This requires maintaining session state on both sides and coordinating key exchange.

**4. Pseudocode (Traffic Steering Decision):**

```
FUNCTION DetermineOptimalAppliance(clientID, primaryAppliance, shadowAppliance):
    riskScorePrimary = PredictiveNetworkAnalysisEngine.CalculateRiskScore(primaryAppliance)
    riskScoreShadow = PredictiveNetworkAnalysisEngine.CalculateRiskScore(shadowAppliance)

    IF riskScorePrimary > threshold AND riskScoreShadow < threshold:
        RETURN shadowAppliance // Steer traffic to shadow
    ELSE:
        RETURN primaryAppliance // Maintain traffic on primary

```

**5. Data Structures:**

*   `SessionState`: Includes all parameters from claims 2 and 12, plus a timestamp of last update and appliance ID.
*   `RiskScore`: A numerical value representing the predicted risk of failure for a given appliance/network path.  Includes confidence intervals.
*   `ApplianceHealth`:  Real-time metrics for CPU usage, memory usage, bandwidth, and other relevant parameters.

**Novelty:**  This differs from standard failover by being *proactive* and *adaptive*.  It doesn't simply react to failures, but *anticipates* them and shifts traffic accordingly. The predictive network analysis and dynamic weighting are key differentiators.  Standard VPN setups typically assume single point of failure, this attempts to eliminate it *before* it occurs.  The degree of replication of session state, beyond just basic parameters, is also novel.
