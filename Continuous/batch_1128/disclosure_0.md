## Adaptive Projection Mapping via Mobile Device Swarm

**Concept:** Extend the mobile device interaction described in the patent to create dynamically adaptive projection mapping onto *any* surface. Instead of targeting a display device, the system uses a swarm of mobile devices to project an interactive layer onto real-world objects, altering their perceived appearance and function.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Mobile Devices (minimum 3, ideally 5+): Equipped with wide-angle lenses, calibrated light sensors, and accurate IMUs.
    *   Calibration Grid: A known physical pattern (e.g., checkerboard) for initial multi-device synchronization.
    *   Optional: Low-power pico-projectors integrated into or attachable to the mobile devices (consider laser projection for higher brightness/contrast). If not integrated, the mobile device screen itself is used as the light source.

*   **Software - Core Modules:**
    *   **Swarm Synchronization:** Uses a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft or Paxos) to ensure accurate temporal and spatial synchronization of all devices in the swarm.  Initial synchronization achieved using the calibration grid.
    *   **Environment Mapping:** Utilizes SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques, leveraging data from all device cameras, to create a real-time 3D model of the target environment.  Cloud processing offloads computationally intensive tasks.
    *   **Projection Mesh Generation:**  Based on the 3D environment map, the system generates a projection mesh that conforms to the surfaces of objects.  This mesh defines the areas onto which content will be projected.
    *   **Content Distribution & Warping:** Content is distributed to each device in the swarm.  Each device renders its portion of the overall image, applying a projective texture warp to compensate for the surface geometry and viewing angle.
    *   **Interaction Engine:**  Extends the user interaction principles from the patent. User input from one device (touch, gestures, voice) is broadcast to the swarm. The system determines the 3D location of the user's interaction within the environment map and applies the corresponding action to the projected content.
    *   **Adaptive Brightness & Contrast:** Each device dynamically adjusts its brightness and contrast based on ambient lighting conditions and the surface reflectance of the target object, ensuring optimal visibility.

*   **Pseudocode â€“ Interaction Handling:**

```
function handleUserInteraction(userDevice, interactionData):
  // Determine 3D position of interaction in world space
  interactionPosition = getWorldPosition(interactionData, userDevice)

  // Identify object being interacted with
  targetObject = findObjectAtPosition(interactionPosition)

  // Apply action to projected content on target object
  if targetObject != null:
    performActionOnObject(targetObject, interactionData)

  //Broadcast updated scene data to swarm devices
  broadcastSceneUpdate()
```

*   **Novel Aspects:**
    *   **Swarm Intelligence:** Leveraging a network of mobile devices to create a dynamically adaptive projection mapping system.
    *   **Real-World Augmentation:** Transforming everyday objects into interactive displays or providing contextual information directly onto their surfaces.
    *   **Dynamic Environment Awareness:** The system adapts to changes in the environment, such as moving objects or variations in lighting conditions.
    *   **Scalability:** The system can be scaled by adding more devices to the swarm, increasing the resolution and coverage area.

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   **Interactive Art Installations:** Creating immersive and responsive art experiences.
    *   **Retail Environments:**  Augmenting products with dynamic information and interactive features.
    *   **Education & Training:** Providing hands-on learning experiences with virtual objects overlaid onto real-world equipment.
    *   **Gaming & Entertainment:** Creating augmented reality games that blend the virtual and physical worlds.
    *   **Accessibility:** Providing visual cues and interactive guidance for people with disabilities.
