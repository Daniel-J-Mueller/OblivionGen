## Dynamic Network Shadowing & Predictive Traffic Steering

**Concept:** Proactively create a “shadow” network mirroring critical traffic flows, allowing seamless failover *before* device failure is detected, and leveraging predictive analytics to shift traffic *before* congestion occurs. This builds upon the discovery phase in the provided patent, but moves beyond reactive shifting to proactive management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Network Creation Module:**

*   **Function:** Automatically establishes a parallel network path mirroring production traffic.
*   **Mechanism:** Uses Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles. The controller discovers network topology (as per the patent), but *also* identifies underutilized capacity on alternative paths.
*   **Configuration:** Allows administrators to define “critical” traffic flows (e.g., VoIP, financial transactions) that *always* have a shadow path established.
*   **Metrics:** Monitors bandwidth utilization, latency, and jitter on both production and shadow paths.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function createShadowNetwork(criticalTrafficFlow, networkTopology) {
  alternativePaths = findAlternativePaths(networkTopology, criticalTrafficFlow);
  bestPath = selectBestPath(alternativePaths, latency, bandwidth);
  if (bestPath != null) {
    createSDNFlow(criticalTrafficFlow, productionPath, bestPath, mirroringMode);
  }
}
```

**2. Predictive Traffic Analysis Engine:**

*   **Function:** Analyzes historical traffic patterns to predict future congestion points and proactively shift traffic to shadow paths.
*   **Mechanism:** Utilizes time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained on network telemetry data (bandwidth, packet loss, latency).  Considers external factors like time of day, day of week, and known events (e.g., marketing campaigns, scheduled backups).
*   **Configuration:**  Administrators define “acceptable performance thresholds” for different traffic types.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function predictCongestion(historicalData, currentTraffic, performanceThresholds) {
  predictedTraffic = timeSeriesForecast(historicalData, currentTraffic);
  if (predictedTraffic > performanceThresholds) {
    return true; // Trigger traffic shift
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**3. Dynamic Traffic Steering Module:**

*   **Function:**  Seamlessly shifts traffic between production and shadow paths based on predicted congestion or device health.
*   **Mechanism:** Uses SDN controllers to dynamically adjust routing rules. Employs a “graceful shift” strategy, gradually moving traffic to the shadow path to minimize disruption.  Monitors traffic performance on both paths during and after the shift.
*   **Configuration:** Allows administrators to define “shift priorities” for different traffic types (e.g., prioritize critical applications over non-critical ones).  Configurable “rollback” mechanism in case of performance degradation on the shadow path.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function shiftTraffic(trafficFlow, productionPath, shadowPath) {
  graduallyIncreaseTrafficOnShadowPath(trafficFlow, shadowPath, shiftRate);
  monitorPerformance(trafficFlow, productionPath, shadowPath);
  if (performanceOnShadowPath < performanceOnProductionPath) {
      rollbackTraffic(trafficFlow, shadowPath, productionPath);
  }
}
```

**4. Device Health Prediction Module:**

*   **Function:** Predicts potential device failures based on real-time telemetry data (CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, temperature, error logs).
*   **Mechanism:** Uses machine learning models (e.g., anomaly detection, classification) trained on historical device telemetry data.
*   **Configuration:**  Allows administrators to define “failure thresholds” for different device metrics.
*   **Integration:** Triggers traffic shifts to shadow paths *before* a device actually fails, enabling seamless failover.

*   High-performance SDN controllers.
*   Network devices with OpenFlow support.
