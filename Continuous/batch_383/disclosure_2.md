## Dynamic Diffraction Grating Pixel Control

**Concept:** Instead of diffusing light with fixed structures, utilize micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) to *actively* create and modulate diffraction gratings *within* each pixel. This allows for precise control of light direction and intensity, creating a richer visual experience and opening doors to holographic-like displays.

**Specs:**

*   **Pixel Structure:** Each pixel contains a transparent substrate layer. Above this is an array of individually addressable MEMS actuators (potentially piezoelectrics or electrostatic). These actuators control the height of a thin, reflective grating layer (e.g., aluminum or silver) deposited on top.
*   **Grating Control:** Each MEMS actuator can raise or lower its section of the grating, altering the period and orientation of the diffraction pattern.  Control is achieved via a thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane integrated into the substrate.
*   **Liquid Integration:** A layer of clear electrowetting fluid sits *below* the MEMS/grating layer. This fluid doesn't directly participate in the diffraction but provides a stable optical medium and assists in heat dissipation from the MEMS.
*   **Backlight/Light Source:**  A high-brightness LED backlight array is positioned behind the entire assembly.  Polarization control is crucial â€“ backlight must be polarized for optimal diffraction efficiency.
*   **Addressing Scheme:** A matrix addressing scheme controls each MEMS actuator individually. Each actuator needs at least three states: "flat" (no diffraction), "vertical" (strong diffraction, one direction), and "intermediate" (variable diffraction).
*   **Computational Requirements:** A dedicated image processing unit (IPU) calculates the necessary actuator states for each frame based on the desired image. This includes complex algorithms for diffraction pattern synthesis and compensation for manufacturing tolerances.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Actuator Control):**

```
For each pixel:
    For each actuator in pixel:
        //Calculate desired diffraction angle based on pixel coordinates and image data
        angle = calculate_diffraction_angle(pixel_x, pixel_y, image_data)

        //Calculate actuator height based on desired angle
        height = calculate_actuator_height(angle)

        //Apply voltage to actuator to achieve desired height
        apply_voltage(actuator, height)
End For
End For
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Polarization Control:**  Integrate micro-polarizers over each actuator to further refine light direction.
*   **Multi-Layer Gratings:** Stack multiple grating layers with different periods for increased complexity and holographic effects.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Use the MEMS actuators to create localized vibrations, providing haptic feedback to the user.
*   **3D Scanning:** Repurpose the MEMS array as a micro-lidar system for 3D environment mapping.
