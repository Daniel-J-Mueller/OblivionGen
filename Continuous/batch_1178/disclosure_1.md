## Automated Anomaly Detection & Predictive Scaling via Event Log Analysis

**Specification:** A system that leverages the organization-level event logs (as established in the provided patent) to not only audit cloud activity, but proactively identify anomalous behavior and predict resource scaling needs.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Event Stream Ingestion & Normalization:**  Existing event logs are ingested in real-time. A normalization layer converts diverse event types (API calls, resource allocations, etc.) into a standardized format.

2.  **Baseline Profiler:**  A continuously running component analyzes historical event data to establish baseline profiles for various metrics (API call frequency, resource usage, error rates) *per account and per region*. This uses a rolling window approach (e.g., 7-day window).  Statistical methods (e.g., moving average, standard deviation) are employed.

3.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:** This engine compares current event data against the established baseline profiles.  Several anomaly detection techniques are used in parallel:
    *   **Statistical Thresholding:** Flags events that exceed predefined statistical thresholds (e.g., 3 standard deviations from the mean).
    *   **Machine Learning Models:**  Trained ML models (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests) identify subtle anomalies that might not be detected by simple thresholding. Models are retrained regularly with new data.
    *   **Sequence Analysis:**  Identifies unusual sequences of API calls that deviate from typical patterns.  (e.g. a series of calls typically made after an authentication request is triggered without an authentication event).

4.  **Predictive Scaling Module:** This module analyzes historical event data and current trends to predict future resource demands.
    *   **Time Series Forecasting:**  Employs time series forecasting algorithms (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future API call volumes, CPU usage, memory consumption, etc.
    *   **Correlation Analysis:** Identifies correlations between different metrics. For example, increased API call volume might correlate with increased CPU usage.
    *   **Capacity Planning:**  Based on the predicted resource demands, the system automatically adjusts resource allocations (e.g., auto-scaling instances, increasing database capacity) to ensure optimal performance.

5.  **Alerting & Remediation:**  When an anomaly is detected or a scaling event is triggered, the system sends alerts to relevant stakeholders.  It can also automatically trigger remediation actions, such as rolling back a problematic deployment or increasing resource capacity.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Predictive Scaling Module):**

```
function predict_resource_demand(account_id, region, metric, time_horizon):
    historical_data = fetch_historical_data(account_id, region, metric)
    
    // Apply time series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA)
    predicted_values = arima_forecast(historical_data, time_horizon)
    
    // Calculate required resource capacity
    required_capacity = calculate_capacity(predicted_values)
    
    return required_capacity
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Event logs are generated by cloud APIs.
2.  Event logs are ingested into the system.
3.  Baseline profiles are created and updated based on historical event data.
4.  The anomaly detection engine compares current event data against baseline profiles.
5.  The predictive scaling module analyzes historical data and predicts future resource demands.
6.  Alerts are sent to stakeholders, and remediation actions are triggered as needed.

**Novelty:**  While the original patent focuses on auditing, this design extends the functionality to proactive anomaly detection and predictive scaling. It leverages the existing event logging infrastructure to provide a more intelligent and automated cloud management solution. It couples account and regional information in the predictive analysis for more fine tuned resource allocation, enhancing capacity planning.
