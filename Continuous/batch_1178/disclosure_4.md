## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Filtering

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply identifying "compelling" scenes based on faces and loudness. Instead, analyze the *emotional* content of the audio and visual data, and dynamically filter clips to maximize emotional resonance with a predicted user profile.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Analysis Modules:**

*   **Visual Emotion Recognition (VER):**  A deep learning model trained on facial expressions, body language, scene context (color palettes, object recognition), and cinematic techniques (camera angles, shot composition) to determine an "emotional score" for each frame. Output: A vector representing the probability of several core emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral) for each frame.
*   **Auditory Emotion Recognition (AER):**  A deep learning model trained on audio features (pitch, tone, rhythm, tempo, spectral characteristics, vocal inflections) and ambient sound classification to determine an "emotional score" for each audio segment.  Output: A vector representing the probability of several core emotions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral) for each audio segment.  AER should also identify *types* of music (e.g., upbeat pop, melancholic classical).
*   **Scene Context Analyzer:** Utilizes object recognition and scene understanding to enhance emotional scoring. (e.g., a funeral scene paired with sad music increases sadness score; a birthday party with upbeat music increases joy).

**2. User Profiling:**

*   **Historical Viewing Data Analysis:** Analyze the user’s past viewing history (including facial expression analysis *while* viewing, if available via device camera) to determine their emotional preferences and sensitivities.  Build a “preference vector” representing the user's baseline emotional state and their receptivity to different emotional tones.
*   **Real-time Physiological Data Integration (Optional):**  If the client device has access to biometric data (heart rate, skin conductance, etc.), integrate this real-time data into the user profile to dynamically adjust emotional filtering.
*   **Explicit Preference Input (Optional):** Allow users to explicitly indicate their preferred emotional tones or to block certain emotional categories.

**3. Dynamic Filtering Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function filterClips(clips, userProfile):
  filteredClips = []
  for clip in clips:
    clipEmotionalScore = calculateClipEmotionalScore(clip)
    resonanceScore = calculateResonanceScore(clipEmotionalScore, userProfile)
    if resonanceScore > threshold:
      filteredClips.append(clip)
  return filteredClips

function calculateClipEmotionalScore(clip):
  frameEmotionalScores = []
  for frame in clip:
    visualEmotionScore = VER(frame)
    audioEmotionScore = AER(frame.audio)
    combinedEmotionScore = combine(visualEmotionScore, audioEmotionScore, sceneContext)
    frameEmotionalScores.append(combinedEmotionScore)
  clipEmotionalScore = average(frameEmotionalScores)
  return clipEmotionalScore

function calculateResonanceScore(clipEmotionalScore, userProfile):
  # Calculate the dot product between the clip’s emotional score and the user's preference vector
  resonanceScore = dotProduct(clipEmotionalScore, userProfile.preferenceVector)
  return resonanceScore
```

**4.  Adaptive Thresholding:**

*   Dynamically adjust the `threshold` value in the `filterClips` function based on the user’s current emotional state (as inferred from physiological data or viewing history) and the overall emotional tone of the media presentation.

**5.  "Emotional Pacing" Module:**

*   After filtering, arrange the selected clips to create an optimal "emotional pacing" sequence.  This involves alternating between high- and low-intensity emotional moments to maintain user engagement.

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for real-time emotion analysis. Edge computing on the client device may be necessary.
*   Emotion recognition models must be robust to variations in lighting, audio quality, and cultural differences.
*   User privacy is paramount. Biometric data should be anonymized and handled securely.
*   The algorithm should be designed to avoid creating emotionally manipulative or addictive experiences.
