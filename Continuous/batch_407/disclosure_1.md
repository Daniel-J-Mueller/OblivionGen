## Adaptive Granularity Task Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the duration-limited task execution system to dynamically adjust the granularity of task partitioning based on real-time execution performance and resource availability. Instead of pre-defined serialization points, introduce an adaptive system that monitors execution speed and dynamically splits or merges task portions.

**Specs:**

*   **Monitoring Agent:** A lightweight agent integrated into the execution environment. Monitors:
    *   Elapsed time for each sub-task (defined by a dynamically adjustable 'chunk size').
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O).
    *   Predicted remaining execution time (using a basic extrapolation algorithm).
*   **Dynamic Chunk Size Adjustment:**
    *   If a sub-task consistently completes *well* before the duration limit, the chunk size *increases*. This reduces overhead from serialization/deserialization and potentially improves overall throughput.
    *   If a sub-task consistently approaches the duration limit, the chunk size *decreases*. This prevents failures and ensures progress.
    *   Adjustment algorithm: A PID controller or similar feedback mechanism adjusts the chunk size. Parameters are configurable.
*   **Serialization/Deserialization Protocol Enhancement:**
    *   Metadata included in serialized state: Chunk size used for the sub-task, resource usage at the time of serialization, and predicted remaining time. This information aids in resuming execution efficiently.
    *   Optimized data transfer: Compression of serialized state to minimize transfer overhead.
*   **Resource Awareness:**
    *   The system queries available resources before initiating a new execution. If resources are constrained, it proactively reduces the chunk size to prevent failures.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Initial chunk size (default value).
    *   PID controller parameters (for chunk size adjustment).
    *   Resource thresholds (triggering proactive chunk size reduction).
    *   Serialization compression level.

**Pseudocode (Monitoring Agent):**

```
function monitor_subtask(start_time, subtask_id):
  end_time = current_time()
  execution_time = end_time - start_time
  resource_usage = get_resource_usage() // CPU, memory, etc.
  predicted_remaining_time = estimate_remaining_time(resource_usage, execution_time)

  if predicted_remaining_time > duration_limit * 0.8:
    adjust_chunk_size(subtask_id, decrease)
  elif predicted_remaining_time < duration_limit * 0.2:
    adjust_chunk_size(subtask_id, increase)

  serialize_state(state_data, resource_usage, predicted_remaining_time)
  return serialized_state
```

**Innovation:** The system moves beyond static partitioning and serialization, enabling a more resilient and efficient execution framework. This adaptive approach allows the system to respond to changing conditions and optimize performance in real-time.  The integration of resource awareness further enhances reliability by proactively adjusting task granularity based on available resources.
