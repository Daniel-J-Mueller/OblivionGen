## Adaptive Chromaticity Mapping for Enhanced Low-Light Performance

**Concept:** The patent focuses on detecting filter malfunction via chromaticity. This builds on that, actively *using* chromaticity information to dynamically improve image quality, specifically in low-light conditions, by creating a learned mapping between ambient light and optimal chromatic enhancement.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Standard RGB image sensor, Ambient Light Sensor (ALS), optional IR sensor.
*   **Processor:** Dedicated image signal processor (ISP) with neural network acceleration.
*   **Memory:** 2GB DDR4 RAM for model storage and runtime processing.
*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Continuously monitor ALS readings.
    *   Capture a short burst (3-5 frames) of images at a low ISO setting (e.g., ISO 100) when ambient light changes significantly.
    *   For each burst, extract the average RGB values for a representative selection of pixels (e.g., center 20x20 region).
*   **Model Training (Offline):**
    *   Gather a dataset of images captured under various lighting conditions (bright sunlight, overcast, twilight, indoor fluorescent, indoor incandescent, etc.).
    *   For each image, record the corresponding ALS reading and extract the average RGB values.
    *   Train a neural network (e.g., a shallow convolutional neural network or a multi-layer perceptron) to map ALS readings to optimal chromatic enhancement parameters.  The parameters define how the RGB channels are adjusted to maximize perceived image quality.
    *   The model should output a set of coefficients for a 3x3 color transformation matrix applied to each pixel. This provides fine-grained control over color balance.
*   **Runtime Operation:**
    *   Receive ALS reading.
    *   Use the trained neural network to predict the optimal color transformation matrix.
    *   Apply the color transformation matrix to each pixel in the captured image.
    *   Optionally, apply a sharpening filter to enhance details after color correction.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**
    *   Implement a feedback loop where user preferences (e.g., color temperature adjustments) are used to fine-tune the model over time. This could be done through a cloud-based service or locally on the device.
    *   Periodically retrain the model using new data captured in the user's typical environment.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Offline Training
Dataset = Collect Images & ALS Readings
Model = Train Neural Network(Dataset) // Maps ALS to Color Transform Matrix

// Runtime Operation
ALS_Reading = Get Ambient Light Sensor Reading
Color_Transform_Matrix = Model.Predict(ALS_Reading)
Image = Capture Image
For Each Pixel In Image:
  Pixel.R = Pixel.R * Color_Transform_Matrix[0][0] + ...
  Pixel.G = Pixel.G * Color_Transform_Matrix[1][0] + ...
  Pixel.B = Pixel.B * Color_Transform_Matrix[2][0] + ...
Output Image
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved low-light performance by dynamically enhancing colors and reducing noise.
*   More accurate color reproduction in various lighting conditions.
*   Personalized image quality based on user preferences and environment.
*   Could be integrated into existing camera systems with minimal hardware changes.
