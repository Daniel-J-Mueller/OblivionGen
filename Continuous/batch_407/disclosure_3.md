## Dynamic POI 'Mood' Layer

**Concept:** Extend personalized POI selection beyond relevance based on user data and marketplace interactions. Introduce a 'mood' layer that dynamically adjusts POI presentation – not just *what* is shown, but *how* – based on inferred user emotional state.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotional State Inference Engine:**
    *   Input: User data streams (location history, app usage, text input – with consent, of course!), biometric data (heart rate via wearables – opt-in only!), social media activity (public data – opt-in).
    *   Processing: Utilize machine learning models to infer user emotional state (happy, sad, stressed, relaxed, etc.).  Output a confidence score for each state.
    *   Calibration: Allow user feedback to calibrate the emotional state inference engine. E.g., "Are you currently feeling stressed?" with a simple yes/no response.

2.  **POI 'Mood' Profiles:**
    *   Define pre-set ‘mood profiles’ for each POI type (restaurant, park, shopping mall, etc.).  These profiles control visual presentation elements.
    *   Elements:
        *   **Color Palette:** Warm/cool colors, vibrant/muted tones.
        *   **Imagery Style:** Energetic/calming photos/videos.
        *   **Text Tone:** Enthusiastic/soothing descriptions.
        *   **Animation Style:** Fast-paced/slow and gentle transitions.
        *   **Sound Design:**  Uplifting/relaxing background music snippets (optional, user-configurable).
    *   Example: A coffee shop POI might have a "Relaxed" mood profile with soft colors, calming imagery, and a soothing description. A concert venue POI might have an "Energetic" profile with vibrant colors and enthusiastic text.

3.  **Dynamic Mood Mapping:**
    *   Map inferred user emotional state to appropriate POI mood profiles.
    *   Logic:
        *   High Stress: Prioritize POIs with calming mood profiles (parks, spas, quiet cafes).
        *   High Energy: Prioritize POIs with energetic mood profiles (concert venues, gyms, lively restaurants).
        *   Sadness: Offer POIs with comforting mood profiles (bookstores, cozy cafes, museums).
        *   Happiness: Amplify existing POI mood profiles to reflect positive emotions.
    *   Smoothing: Implement a smoothing function to prevent abrupt mood shifts.

4.  **User Control & Customization:**
    *   Allow users to override the inferred mood.  E.g., "I'm feeling adventurous, show me energetic POIs even though I'm stressed."
    *   Enable users to customize mood profiles for specific POI types.
    *   Provide a ‘mood filter’ – a slider to adjust the intensity of the mood layer.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (user_location_updated) {
  user_emotional_state = infer_emotional_state(user_data)
  poi_list = get_poi_list(user_location)

  for each poi in poi_list {
    mood_profile = get_mood_profile(poi.type, user_emotional_state)
    poi.visuals = apply_mood_profile(poi.visuals, mood_profile)
  }

  display_poi_list(poi_list)
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Ambient Lighting Integration:** Sync POI visuals with smart home lighting to create an immersive experience.
*   **Personalized Soundscapes:** Generate dynamic soundscapes based on user location and mood.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce rewards for exploring POIs that align with the user’s current mood.
*   **Social Sharing:** Allow users to share their mood-adjusted POI experiences with friends.
