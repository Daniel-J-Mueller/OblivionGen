## Dynamic Payload Prioritization & Adaptive Partitioning

**Concept:** Expand the virtual partitioning concept to not only distribute load based on *time* to expiration, but also based on *priority* of the payload itself, dynamically adjusting partition size and sweeper worker allocation. This allows for guaranteeing service level agreements (SLAs) for critical timers, even under heavy load.

**Specifications:**

**1. Payload Priority Metadata:**

*   Each timer creation request *must* include a `priority` field (integer scale 1-10, 10 being highest). This value dictates resource allocation and execution precedence.
*   Priority is a client-configurable parameter, subject to system-wide limits (see section 4).

**2. Partition Types:**

*   Introduce three primary partition types:
    *   **Critical (Priority 8-10):** Smallest partition size, highest sweeper worker density. Guaranteed SLA. Dedicated resources.
    *   **Standard (Priority 4-7):** Medium partition size, balanced sweeper worker allocation. Normal priority.
    *   **Background (Priority 1-3):** Largest partition size, lowest sweeper worker allocation. Best effort execution.
*   Partitions are dynamically created/destroyed based on incoming request priority distribution.

**3. Dynamic Partition Adjustment:**

*   A “Partition Manager” component continuously monitors the distribution of incoming timer priorities.
*   The Partition Manager employs the following logic:
    *   If the ratio of Critical/Standard/Background requests deviates significantly from pre-defined thresholds, the Partition Manager adjusts the number of partitions allocated to each type.
    *   Adjustments are performed incrementally to minimize disruption.
    *   Adjustments prioritize maintaining sufficient capacity in the Critical partition.

**4. Priority Throttling & Quotas:**

*   A system-level administrator can configure priority-based quotas per client.
*   Clients exceeding their allocated priority bandwidth are throttled or rejected.
*   The throttling mechanism prioritizes requests from higher-priority clients.

**5. Sweeper Worker Coordination & Priority Scheduling:**

*   The “Sweeper Worker Coordinator” now incorporates priority scheduling.
*   Sweeper workers are assigned to partitions based on partition type (critical, standard, background).
*   Within a partition, timers with higher priority payloads are processed first.
*   A “starvation prevention” mechanism ensures that low-priority timers eventually execute.

**6. Pseudocode - Partition Manager:**

```pseudocode
// Monitor incoming timer requests
function monitorRequests() {
  requests = getIncomingTimerRequests();
  priorityCounts = { "critical": 0, "standard": 0, "background": 0 };
  for (request in requests) {
    priority = request.priority;
    if (priority >= 8) {
      priorityCounts["critical"]++;
    } else if (priority >= 4) {
      priorityCounts["standard"]++;
    } else {
      priorityCounts["background"]++;
    }
  }

  // Calculate current partition distribution
  criticalPartitions = getNumberOfPartitions("critical");
  standardPartitions = getNumberOfPartitions("standard");
  backgroundPartitions = getNumberOfPartitions("background");

  // Define target ratios
  targetCriticalRatio = 0.2;
  targetStandardRatio = 0.5;
  targetBackgroundRatio = 0.3;

  // Calculate desired number of partitions
  totalPartitions = criticalPartitions + standardPartitions + backgroundPartitions;
  desiredCriticalPartitions = totalPartitions * targetCriticalRatio;
  desiredStandardPartitions = totalPartitions * targetStandardRatio;
  desiredBackgroundPartitions = totalPartitions * targetBackgroundRatio;

  // Adjust partitions
  if (criticalPartitions < desiredCriticalPartitions) {
    createPartition("critical");
  } else if (criticalPartitions > desiredCriticalPartitions) {
    destroyPartition("critical");
  }

  // Repeat for standard and background
}

// Run monitorRequests() periodically
setInterval(monitorRequests, 60000); // Every 60 seconds
```

**7. Data Structures:**

*   `TimerRequest`: {`clientId`, `expirationTime`, `payload`, `priority`}
*   `Partition`: {`type` (critical, standard, background), `capacity`, `currentLoad`}

This design introduces a dynamically adapting system, capable of meeting varying demands, and guaranteeing service for high-priority timers. It’s an extension of the existing virtual partitioning, but adds a layer of intelligence based on payload characteristics.
