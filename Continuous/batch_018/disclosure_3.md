## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Grid Carbon Intensity

**Concept:** Expand the energy optimization to include real-time and predicted carbon intensity of the electrical grid supplying the data centers. This allows shifting workloads to locations and times with lower carbon emissions, contributing to sustainability goals *in addition* to reducing energy costs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Grid Carbon Intensity API Integration:** Integrate with APIs providing real-time and predicted carbon intensity data for regional electrical grids (e.g., Electricity Maps, EPA’s AVERT).  Data should include carbon intensity (gCO2/kWh) and the forecast horizon (e.g., next 24 hours, next week).
*   **Historical Data Storage:** Maintain a historical database of grid carbon intensity, weather data (temperature, humidity), and data center energy usage patterns.
*   **Prediction Model:** Develop a machine learning model to predict future grid carbon intensity based on historical data, weather forecasts, and potentially other factors (e.g., planned grid maintenance, time of day).  Consider time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
*   **Data Normalization:** Normalize carbon intensity data to a common scale for comparison across regions.

**2. Resource Allocation Algorithm:**

*   **Cost Function:** Expand the existing energy cost component of the resource allocation algorithm to include a carbon cost component.  The carbon cost should be weighted based on organizational sustainability goals.  (e.g., `Total Cost = (Energy Cost * Energy Weight) + (Carbon Cost * Carbon Weight)`).
*   **Carbon Cost Calculation:** Calculate the carbon cost for running a workload at a specific location and time:  `Carbon Cost = (Workload Energy Usage) * (Predicted Carbon Intensity) * (Carbon Price)`. The "Carbon Price" is a configurable internal cost per kgCO2, representing the value the organization places on reducing emissions.
*   **Workload Prioritization:** Allow workload prioritization based on carbon impact.  Critical workloads might prioritize performance, while less urgent workloads can be more flexible in their placement to minimize carbon emissions.
*   **Dynamic Re-allocation:** Implement a mechanism for dynamically re-allocating workloads *during* execution based on changing grid conditions. For instance, if a region’s carbon intensity suddenly increases, the system can migrate workloads to a cleaner region (with acceptable performance overhead).

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Centralized Controller:** A centralized controller manages the resource allocation process, incorporating grid carbon intensity data into the decision-making process.
*   **Agent-Based Architecture:** Implement an agent-based architecture where individual data center locations are represented by agents. Each agent monitors local grid conditions and reports them to the central controller.
*   **API Integration:**  Expose APIs for other systems (e.g., workload schedulers, monitoring tools) to access grid carbon intensity data and resource allocation recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Algorithm):**

```
function allocate_workload(workload, candidate_locations):
  best_location = null
  min_cost = infinity

  for location in candidate_locations:
    predicted_energy_usage = estimate_energy_usage(workload, location)
    predicted_carbon_intensity = get_predicted_carbon_intensity(location)
    carbon_cost = predicted_energy_usage * predicted_carbon_intensity * carbon_price
    energy_cost = predicted_energy_usage * energy_price
    total_cost = (energy_cost * energy_weight) + (carbon_cost * carbon_weight)

    if total_cost < min_cost:
      min_cost = total_cost
      best_location = location

  return best_location
```

**4. Monitoring and Reporting:**

*   **Carbon Footprint Tracking:** Track the carbon footprint of data center operations, broken down by location, workload, and time.
*   **Reporting Dashboard:** Provide a dashboard visualizing carbon emissions data, energy usage, and cost savings.
*   **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify administrators of high carbon emissions or grid instability.
