## Delegated Policy Synthesis & Dynamic Permission Sculpting

**Concept:** Expand the delegated administrator concept beyond static permission boundaries. Introduce a system where delegated administrators can *synthesize* new permission policies based on pre-approved “policy fragments” and dynamically adjust effective permissions for IAM principals based on contextual factors.

**Specification:**

**1. Policy Fragment Repository:**

*   A centralized repository storing pre-approved, modular policy fragments. These fragments represent common access patterns or specific resource permissions (e.g., "read S3 bucket X", "invoke Lambda function Y", “EC2 instance console access – region Z”).
*   Each fragment is tagged with metadata: resource type, action, required conditions (e.g., MFA, IP range), risk score, and a "synthesis signature" (identifying allowed combinations with other fragments).
*   Central administrator controls fragment creation, approval, and versioning.
*   Fragments can be versioned, and deprecated fragments archived.

**2. Delegated Policy Synthesis Interface:**

*   A web-based UI for delegated administrators.
*   Allows administrators to *compose* new permission policies by selecting and combining pre-approved fragments.
*   The interface presents fragments based on a search/filter, categorized by resource type and action.
*   A "synthesis engine" validates fragment combinations against the synthesis signatures, preventing the creation of invalid or overly permissive policies.
*   The UI visually depicts the composed policy and its effective permissions.
*   Workflow approval system for synthesized policies before deployment.

**3. Contextual Permission Sculpting:**

*   Extend IAM to incorporate “context keys”. These keys represent real-time factors influencing access decisions (e.g., time of day, user location, device type, data sensitivity level).
*   Delegated administrators can associate context keys with synthesized policies.
*   IAM evaluates context keys at runtime.  Policy effects are modified *dynamically* based on context.
*   Example: Policy grants access to sensitive data, *but only* if the user is accessing from a corporate network and using a managed device.

**4.  Dynamic Permission ‘Blending’**

*   Implement a "permission blending" engine.
*   Blends the effective permissions granted by the synthesized policy, the permission boundary policy, *and* the contextual evaluation.
*   The blending engine utilizes a prioritized evaluation scheme. Boundary policies offer a baseline, then synthesized permissions are layered on top, finally, contextual factors dynamically adjust the blend.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Evaluation):**

```
function evaluatePermission(user, action, resource, context) {
  boundaryPermissions = getBoundaryPermissions(user);
  synthesizedPermissions = getSynthesizedPermissions(user);
  
  if (!boundaryPermissions.allows(action, resource)) {
    return false; // Deny if boundary policy blocks
  }

  combinedPermissions = boundaryPermissions.intersect(synthesizedPermissions);
  
  if (context.location == "Corporate Network" && context.deviceType == "Managed Device") {
      combinedPermissions.addPermission("accessSensitiveData"); //Dynamically add permission
  }

  if (combinedPermissions.allows(action, resource)) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   A robust fragment repository requires a scalable database and efficient indexing.
*   The synthesis engine needs to be optimized for performance to handle complex fragment combinations.
*   Context key evaluation should be implemented efficiently to minimize latency.
*   Auditing and logging are essential for tracking policy changes and access decisions.
*   The system needs to support granular access control to the fragment repository and synthesis tools.
