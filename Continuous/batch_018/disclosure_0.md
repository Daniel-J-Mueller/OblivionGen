## Dynamic Code Similarity via Graph Neural Networks

**Specification:** A system for determining code similarity that moves beyond simple logic tree comparison and utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn nuanced code representations. This allows for identification of similar *intent* even with syntactically different code.

**Components:**

1.  **Code Parser & Graph Builder:**  Transforms code segments into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). The AST is then converted into a graph representation where:
    *   Nodes represent code elements (variables, functions, operators, literals).
    *   Edges represent relationships between elements (control flow, data dependency, function calls). Edge types are crucial (e.g., 'calls', 'uses', 'defines', 'controls').
2.  **Graph Neural Network (GNN) Encoder:** A GNN model (e.g., Graph Convolutional Network, Graph Attention Network) learns a vector embedding for each node in the code graph. This embedding captures the node's context within the code.  The GNN aggregates information from neighboring nodes to create a richer representation. Multiple GNN layers can be stacked.
3.  **Graph Pooling Layer:**  Aggregates the node embeddings into a single fixed-size vector representing the entire code segment.  Strategies include global average pooling, global max pooling, or learnable attention-based pooling.
4.  **Similarity Metric:**  A distance metric (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance) compares the pooled embeddings of two code segments.  A threshold determines whether the segments are considered a match.
5.  **Training Data Generation:**  A pipeline to automatically generate training data. This pipeline involves collecting code from open-source repositories, performing semantic analysis, and labeling code segments as similar or dissimilar based on their functionality.  Data augmentation techniques (e.g., variable renaming, code reordering) are used to increase the size and diversity of the training dataset.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function generate_code_embedding(code_segment):
  ast = parse_code(code_segment)
  graph = build_graph_from_ast(ast)
  node_embeddings = GNN_Encoder(graph)
  code_embedding = Graph_Pooling(node_embeddings)
  return code_embedding

function find_similar_code(query_code, code_database):
  query_embedding = generate_code_embedding(query_code)
  similar_codes = []
  for code in code_database:
    code_embedding = generate_code_embedding(code)
    similarity = cosine_similarity(query_embedding, code_embedding)
    if similarity > similarity_threshold:
      similar_codes.append(code)
  return similar_codes

function train_GNN(training_data):
  model = initialize_GNN()
  optimizer = initialize_optimizer(model)
  for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in training_data:
      code_graph, target_similarity = batch
      predicted_similarity = model(code_graph)
      loss = calculate_loss(predicted_similarity, target_similarity)
      optimizer.step(loss)
  return model
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Semantic Understanding:** Unlike the patent's reliance on logical structure, this system emphasizes *semantic* similarity, identifying code with the same purpose even if the syntax differs.
*   **GNN-Based Representation:** Using GNNs enables the model to learn complex relationships between code elements and capture nuances in code structure.  This is superior to simple hash-based indexing.
*   **Trainable Model:** The system is designed to be trained on a large dataset of code, allowing it to adapt to different programming languages and coding styles.
*   **Scalability:** The GNN embedding can be pre-computed for code in the database, enabling fast similarity searches.
