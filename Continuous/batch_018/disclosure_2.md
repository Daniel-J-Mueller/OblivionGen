## Adaptive Network 'Shadowing' for Proactive Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Extend the validation framework to create a predictive ‘shadow’ network mirroring real-time traffic, enabling proactive identification of anomalies *before* they impact performance.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shadow Network Generation:**
    *   A virtualized replica of the physical network topology is created, mirroring link capacities and device configurations.
    *   Traffic matrices (from the existing validation system) are used as input to the shadow network.
    *   Traffic is ‘played’ through the shadow network using a network emulator (e.g., Mininet, GNS3).
    *   The emulator simulates packet forwarding, queuing, and potential congestion.

*   **Predictive Modeling Layer:**
    *   A machine learning model is trained on historical shadow network performance data (latency, packet loss, throughput).
    *   This model predicts future performance under different traffic load scenarios.
    *   Predictions are made *before* changes in real-world traffic patterns occur.

*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:**
    *   Continuously compares predicted shadow network performance with real-time network metrics.
    *   Discrepancies exceeding a defined threshold trigger an anomaly alert.
    *   Alerts include: predicted impact severity, potential root cause (based on shadow network analysis), and recommended mitigation steps.

*   **Dynamic Shadow Adjustment:**
    *   The shadow network topology and traffic matrix are periodically updated based on real-time network changes.
    *   This ensures the shadow network remains an accurate representation of the physical network.

*   **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The adaptive shadowing system integrates with the existing traffic matrix validation framework.
    *   Validation results are used to refine the shadow network model and improve prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
FUNCTION DetectAnomaly(realTimeMetrics, predictedMetrics, threshold):
    anomalyScore = CalculateDiscrepancy(realTimeMetrics, predictedMetrics)

    IF anomalyScore > threshold:
        severity = AssessSeverity(anomalyScore)
        rootCause = AnalyzeShadowNetwork(severity)
        mitigationSteps = GenerateMitigationSteps(rootCause)

        RETURN { severity: severity, rootCause: rootCause, mitigationSteps: mitigationSteps }
    ELSE:
        RETURN { status: "normal" }
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateDiscrepancy(realTimeMetrics, predictedMetrics):
    // Implement a scoring function to measure the difference between real and predicted values
    // Could use metrics like mean squared error, percentage difference, etc.
    // Consider weighting different metrics based on their importance
    // ...
    RETURN discrepancyScore
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Virtualized network emulation platform (Mininet, GNS3, etc.)
*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
*   Data storage for historical performance data
*   High-bandwidth network connectivity between the physical and virtual networks
*   Integration with existing network monitoring and management systems.
