**Modular Camera Array with Dynamic Focal Plane Adjustment**

**Concept:** Expand the precision mounting concepts to allow for *dynamic* adjustment of the focal plane for each camera module *after* assembly, creating a system capable of real-time depth mapping and image enhancement. This moves beyond static alignment to an active, adaptable system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Module:** Each camera module (as described in the provided patent) remains fundamentally similar—lens module, silicon substrate, image sensor die—but with critical additions.
*   **Piezoelectric Actuators:** Integrate three miniature piezoelectric actuators beneath the silicon substrate of each camera module. These actuators, controlled by a central processor, will provide precise X, Y, and Z-axis movement of the image sensor die relative to the lens module. Range of motion: 50-100 microns. Resolution: 1 micron.
*   **Capacitive Sensors:** Embed a micro-fabricated capacitive sensor array *within* the silicon substrate, positioned between the image sensor die and the mounting posts. This array will measure the precise position of the image sensor die in real-time, providing feedback to the control system. Resolution: 0.5 microns.
*   **Chassis Modifications:** The chassis mounting posts will be modified to include integrated electrical contacts. These contacts will provide power and control signals to the piezoelectric actuators and capacitive sensors within each camera module.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated processor (FPGA or similar) will manage the control and feedback loop for each camera module. The processor will receive input from the capacitive sensors, calculate the necessary adjustments to the piezoelectric actuators, and send control signals accordingly. Software interface for calibration and dynamic adjustment of focal planes.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Develop an automated calibration routine that utilizes a known reference pattern to determine the optimal focal plane for each camera module. This routine will map the positional adjustments needed to achieve optimal focus.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that allows for real-time adjustment of the focal plane based on depth data or user input. This algorithm will enable the system to create high-resolution 3D models or enhance images with improved depth of field.

**Pseudocode for Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**

```
// Input: Depth map or user-defined focal point
// Output: Control signals for piezoelectric actuators

function adjustFocalPlane(depthMap, focalPoint) {
  // Calculate the optimal offset for each camera module based on its position and the desired focal point.
  for each cameraModule in cameraModules {
    offset = calculateOffset(cameraModule.position, focalPoint, depthMap);

    // Calculate the required adjustments for each piezoelectric actuator.
    xAdjustment = offset.x;
    yAdjustment = offset.y;
    zAdjustment = offset.z;

    // Send control signals to the piezoelectric actuators.
    sendActuatorSignals(cameraModule, xAdjustment, yAdjustment, zAdjustment);
  }
}

function calculateOffset(cameraPosition, focalPoint, depthMap) {
  // Calculate the distance between the camera and the focal point.
  distance = distanceBetween(cameraPosition, focalPoint);

  // Determine the required offset based on the distance and the depth map.
  offset = (distance - depthMap[cameraPosition]) * calibrationFactor;

  return offset;
}
```
