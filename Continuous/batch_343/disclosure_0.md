## Adaptive Power Harvesting & Prioritization System

**Concept:** Expand beyond reactive power *management* to proactive power *harvesting* and intelligent prioritization of device functions based on predicted energy availability. The core idea is to not just *conserve* power when low, but to *actively seek* supplemental power sources and dynamically adjust function priority to maximize uptime and usability even under limited conventional charging opportunities.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   **Multi-Source Energy Harvester:** Integrated module capable of capturing energy from multiple ambient sources simultaneously â€“ solar (indoor/outdoor), RF (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular), kinetic (vibration, movement), thermal (body heat, temperature gradients).  Must be modular and easily upgradable to support new harvesting technologies.
    *   **Advanced Power Management IC (PMIC):**  Highly efficient DC-DC converters, power path management, and battery charging circuitry optimized for fluctuating, low-power inputs.  Includes maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithms for each energy source.
    *   **Capacitive Energy Storage:**  Array of high-density, solid-state capacitors supplementing/replacing traditional batteries (or acting as a buffer).  Capacitors allow for faster charging/discharging cycles, increased lifespan, and operate better in extreme temperatures.
    *   **Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) Receiver:**  Integrated coil for receiving power via resonant inductive coupling (Qi standard or proprietary).
    *   **Micro-Vibration Sensor:** A highly sensitive accelerometer capable of detecting subtle vibrations for kinetic energy harvesting.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**

    *   **Ambient Energy Profiler:**  Software module continuously monitors and profiles available ambient energy sources (intensity of light, RF signal strength, vibration frequency/amplitude, thermal gradients). Stores historical data for predictive modeling.
    *   **Predictive Energy Availability Model:** Machine learning algorithm predicts future energy availability based on historical data, time of day, location (GPS), user behavior (activity recognition), and environmental factors (weather forecast).
    *   **Function Prioritization Engine:** Dynamic system that assigns priority levels to various device functions (e.g., core communication, display, processing, sensors, non-essential apps).  Priority levels are adjusted based on predicted energy availability.
    *   **Adaptive Power Allocation:** Based on function priority and energy availability, the system allocates power to functions accordingly. Low-priority functions may be throttled, suspended, or temporarily disabled to conserve energy.
    *   **'Energy Aware' Application Framework:**  SDK for developers to build applications that are aware of the device's energy status and can dynamically adjust their behavior to minimize power consumption.
    *   **'Trickle Charge' Optimization:** Algorithms optimized to efficiently capture and store even the smallest amounts of harvested energy, maximizing overall energy accumulation.
    *   **Pseudocode for Function Prioritization:**

```
// Define function priority levels (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low)
enum Priority { Critical, High, Medium, Low };

// Data structure to represent device functions
struct Function {
  String name;
  Priority priority;
  float powerConsumption;
  bool isRunning;
};

// Global list of device functions
List<Function> functions;

// Function to calculate total power consumption of running functions
float calculateTotalPowerConsumption() {
  float totalPower = 0;
  for (Function f : functions) {
    if (f.isRunning) {
      totalPower += f.powerConsumption;
    }
  }
  return totalPower;
}

// Function to adjust function priority based on energy availability
void adjustFunctionPriority(float predictedEnergyAvailability) {
  float currentPowerConsumption = calculateTotalPowerConsumption();

  if (currentPowerConsumption > predictedEnergyAvailability) {
    // Reduce power consumption by suspending low-priority functions
    for (Function f : functions) {
      if (f.priority == Priority.Low && f.isRunning) {
        f.isRunning = false;
        //Log event, reduce power usage
      }
    }
  }
}
```

*   **User Interface:** Visual indicators of harvested energy levels, predicted energy availability, and function prioritization status.  Options to manually adjust function priorities.

**Innovation:** This system goes beyond simply reacting to low battery levels. It actively seeks and utilizes supplemental energy sources, dynamically adjusts function prioritization, and provides a more robust and reliable user experience even under limited charging opportunities.  This moves the paradigm from 'power management' to 'power resilience'.
