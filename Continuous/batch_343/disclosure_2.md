## Adaptive Authentication Credential ‘Lifespan’ based on Behavioral Biometrics & Risk Scoring

**Concept:** Expand upon the uniqueness verification by introducing dynamic credential lifespans, adjusted *in real-time* based on a user’s behavioral biometrics and a constantly updated risk score. This goes beyond simply verifying if a credential is *currently* unique to predicting potential compromise *before* it happens.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Points:** Continuously collect data on:
    *   Typing cadence (key press duration, intervals, pressure)
    *   Mouse/Touchpad movement (speed, acceleration, patterns)
    *   Device orientation/motion (gyroscope, accelerometer data)
    *   Application usage patterns (time spent, order of use)
    *   Navigation patterns within applications (clicks, scrolls)
*   **Processing:** Utilize machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user. This profile is *dynamic* – constantly updated with new data.
*   **Output:** A ‘Behavioral Deviation Score’ – a metric indicating how much the user’s current behavior deviates from their established baseline.  Higher scores indicate anomalous behavior.

**2.  Risk Scoring Engine:**

*   **Input Data:**
    *   Behavioral Deviation Score (from Module 1)
    *   Device Information (OS, browser, IP address, geolocation – anonymized where possible)
    *   Time of Access (access attempts outside typical hours are weighted higher)
    *   Access Location (significant changes in location trigger increased weighting)
    *   Credential Age (older credentials receive higher weighting – more likely to be compromised)
    *   Public Breach Databases (cross-reference credentials against known breached databases)
*   **Processing:**  Combine input data using a weighted scoring algorithm. Weights are adjustable and can be optimized through machine learning.
*   **Output:**  A ‘Risk Score’ – a numerical value representing the overall risk associated with the current authentication attempt.

**3. Dynamic Credential Lifespan Manager:**

*   **Input:** Risk Score (from Module 2)
*   **Processing:**  Adjust the lifespan of the current authentication credential *in real-time* based on the Risk Score. Implement a tiered system:

    *   **Low Risk (Score < 30):**  Credential lifespan = Standard (e.g., 90 days)
    *   **Medium Risk (30 <= Score < 70):** Credential lifespan = Reduced (e.g., 30 days) – Prompt user to review security questions or enable multi-factor authentication.
    *   **High Risk (Score >= 70):** Credential lifespan = Immediate Expiration.  Force immediate password reset or MFA challenge.
*   **Output:**  Updated credential lifespan value.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices based:** Each module (Behavioral Biometrics, Risk Scoring, Lifespan Manager) should be implemented as a separate microservice for scalability and maintainability.
*   **API Integration:**  Integrate seamlessly with existing authentication systems via APIs.
*   **Data Privacy:**  Prioritize data privacy and anonymization. Minimize data storage and comply with relevant regulations (GDPR, CCPA).

**Pseudocode (Lifespan Manager):**

```
function adjustCredentialLifespan(riskScore, currentLifespan) {
  if (riskScore < 30) {
    return currentLifespan // Maintain standard lifespan
  } else if (riskScore >= 30 && riskScore < 70) {
    newLifespan = currentLifespan * 0.33 // Reduce lifespan to 33%
    return newLifespan
  } else {
    return 0 // Force immediate expiration
  }
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Challenge:**  Instead of simply expiring the credential, present a dynamic challenge (e.g., biometric verification, security question) based on the Risk Score.
*   **Proactive Security Alerts:**  Notify users of suspicious activity and provide recommendations for improving their security posture.
*   **Federated Learning:**  Share behavioral biometric data across multiple entities (with user consent) to improve the accuracy of risk scoring models.
