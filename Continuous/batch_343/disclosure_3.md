## Visual Programming Node ‘Morphing’

**Concept:** Extend the ability to combine visual programming nodes not just into a single, static reusable node, but into a *dynamic*, morphing node. This node's internal structure and function would be adjustable *after* initial creation, allowing for adaptation to new contexts without complete rebuilds.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Morphing Node Structure:**
    *   Core: A container holding a graph of visual programming nodes. This internal graph is not directly exposed to the user as editable elements, but through higher-level *parameters*.
    *   Parameters: Exposed to the user as adjustable settings. These parameters control the configuration of the internal node graph. Examples:
        *   Node addition/removal: Add or remove pre-defined node ‘modules’ within the morphing node.
        *   Connection re-wiring: Alter the data/signal flow between internal nodes based on parameter values.
        *   Parameter passing: Allow external input parameters to influence the behavior of internal nodes.
        *   Sub-graph insertion: Ability to insert pre-built, self-contained sub-graphs as modules.
2.  **Morphing Engine:**
    *   A system responsible for interpreting parameter changes and applying them to the internal node graph.
    *   This engine could utilize a rule-based system or a more flexible approach like a small embedded scripting language.
    *   The engine must handle dependency resolution to ensure changes don’t create invalid configurations.
3.  **Parameter Definition Language (PDL):**
    *   A language to define the available parameters for a morphing node. This would include:
        *   Parameter name and type (e.g., integer, float, boolean, enum).
        *   Valid value range or set.
        *   A mapping between parameter values and changes to the internal node graph. This could be expressed as code snippets or visual connection rules.
4.  **Version Control:**
    *   Each morphing node instance should have a version history, tracking changes made through parameter adjustments. This would allow users to revert to previous configurations.

**Pseudocode (Morphing Engine - Simplified):**

```
function applyParameterChange(morphingNode, parameterName, newValue):
  parameterDefinition = getParameterDefinition(morphingNode, parameterName)

  if parameterDefinition.type == "node_add":
    addNodeToGraph(morphingNode, parameterDefinition.nodeType)
  else if parameterDefinition.type == "connection_rewire":
    removeConnection(morphingNode, parameterDefinition.connectionToRemove)
    addConnection(morphingNode, parameterDefinition.connectionToAdd)
  else if parameterDefinition.type == "parameter_pass":
    setNodeParameter(morphingNode, parameterDefinition.targetNode, parameterDefinition.parameterName, newValue)
  else:
    // Handle other parameter types
    pass

  saveNodeVersion(morphingNode)
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   This system would require a robust framework for managing and updating the internal node graph.
*   Performance optimization would be crucial, as dynamically altering the graph could be computationally expensive.
*   A visual interface for managing and configuring morphing nodes would greatly enhance usability.
*   The PDL could be extended to support more complex transformations, such as conditional node additions or dynamic connection rewiring.
