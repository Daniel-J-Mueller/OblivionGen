## Content Drift Prediction for Collaborative Document Editing

**System Overview:** A real-time system for predicting the *drift* of collaborative document content, not simply measuring difference, but *predicting* where divergence will occur based on individual user editing patterns and collective momentum. This is geared towards complex document creation – legal briefs, scientific papers, software documentation – where understanding *intent* of changes is vital.

**Core Concept:** Leverage user-specific "edit signatures" and collective "momentum vectors" to forecast future content divergence.  Instead of simply comparing versions, we anticipate *where* the next significant changes will happen.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   Real-time capture of all edits: character insertions, deletions, formatting changes, comment insertions/deletions, move/copy/paste operations.
    *   User profile tracking: Editing speed, typical vocabulary, preferred formatting styles, common error patterns.
    *   Document structure analysis: Identification of key sections, headings, arguments, code blocks.
*   **Edit Signature Generation:**
    *   For each user, create an “edit signature” – a vector representing their editing style.  Features:
        *   Character-level n-gram frequencies (what characters/sequences do they frequently type/delete?).
        *   Phrase/sentence structure preferences (do they favor active/passive voice, long/short sentences?).
        *   Frequency of specific keywords/terms relevant to the document topic.
        *   Rate of change (characters/second)
*   **Momentum Vector Calculation:**
    *   For each section/block of the document, calculate a "momentum vector."  This represents the direction and magnitude of change within that section. Features:
        *   Weighted average of recent edits (more recent edits have higher weight).
        *   Direction of change (addition, deletion, modification).
        *   Entropy of changes (high entropy = rapid, unpredictable changes; low entropy = slow, predictable changes).
*   **Drift Prediction Algorithm:**
    *   **Input:** User edit signatures, document momentum vectors, document structure.
    *   **Process:**
        1.  For each section of the document, combine the edit signatures of active users with the section's momentum vector.
        2.  Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to predict the likelihood of future edits within that section. The LSTM will learn to identify patterns in user behavior and momentum to forecast changes.
        3.  Output a “drift score” for each section, indicating the probability of significant divergence.  Sections with high drift scores are flagged as potential areas of conflict or disagreement.
*   **Visualization & Alerting:**
    *   Highlight sections with high drift scores in a collaborative editing interface.
    *   Generate alerts when drift scores exceed a predefined threshold.
    *   Provide visualizations of user editing patterns and momentum vectors.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```python
# Simplified example – conceptual only
def predict_drift(user_signatures, section_momentum, section_structure):
    # Combine user signatures and section momentum
    combined_vector = user_signatures + section_momentum

    # LSTM network prediction
    drift_score = lstm_network.predict(combined_vector)

    return drift_score

# Data structures (examples)
user_signature = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4] # Numerical representation of editing style
section_momentum = [0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8] # Numerical representation of change
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Conflict Resolution:** Identify potential disagreements before they escalate.
*   **Version Control:**  Focus version control efforts on sections with high drift.
*   **Automated Summarization:**  Highlight sections with stable content for summarization.
*   **Adaptive Collaboration:** Recommend different collaborators based on their editing styles and the document's momentum.
