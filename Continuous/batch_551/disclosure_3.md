## Adaptive Cache Partitioning with Dynamic Granularity

**Concept:** Introduce a system where cache partitions aren't fixed in size, but dynamically adjust based on observed access patterns and thread contention. This moves beyond simply locking entries or groups of entries, towards a fluid, self-optimizing cache layout.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   **Cache Monitoring Unit (CMU):**  A dedicated hardware component (or highly optimized software module) integrated with the cache controller.  This monitors cache access patterns â€“ which entries are frequently accessed, by which threads, and contention levels.
*   **Partition Management Unit (PMU):** A hardware/software component responsible for adjusting cache partition boundaries.  This will require the ability to remap physical cache lines to different partitions.
*   **Thread Metadata Table (TMT):** A data structure maintained by the operating system (or a dedicated cache management service).  This table stores information about each thread:  its current access frequency to different cache regions, observed contention levels, and preferred partition size.

**2. Partitioning Scheme:**

*   **Base Partitioning:** The cache is initially divided into a moderate number of base partitions (e.g., 8, 16).
*   **Dynamic Splits/Merges:** The PMU, guided by the CMU and TMT, dynamically splits or merges partitions.
    *   **Split Trigger:** If a partition exhibits high contention *and* a significant portion of its entries are consistently accessed by a single thread, the partition is split.
    *   **Merge Trigger:** If a partition is sparsely used or if the threads accessing it are well-distributed, partitions are merged.
*   **Granularity Levels:** Implement multiple granularity levels:
    *   **Coarse-Grained:** Large partitions for general-purpose data.
    *   **Medium-Grained:** Partitions sized to accommodate common thread workloads.
    *   **Fine-Grained:** Very small partitions (e.g., single cache lines) for highly contended data.

**3. Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop (executed periodically by PMU)

FOR EACH partition IN cache:
    contentionLevel = CMU.getContention(partition)
    accessFrequency = CMU.getAccessFrequency(partition)
    owningThread = CMU.getOwningThread(partition)

    IF contentionLevel > threshold AND owningThread != NULL:
        // Split partition
        newPartition = createNewPartition()
        moveEntries(owningThread.preferredAccessRegion, newPartition)

    ELSE IF accessFrequency < threshold AND numberOfPartitions > minimumPartitions:
        // Merge with neighbor
        mergeWithNeighbor(partition)

    //Adaptive adjustment of partition size based on observed access frequency
    IF accessFrequency > highFrequencyThreshold:
        increasePartitionSize(partition)
    ELSE IF accessFrequency < lowFrequencyThreshold:
        decreasePartitionSize(partition)
```

**4. Lock Management:**

*   **Partition-Level Locks:** Each partition has a dedicated lock.
*   **Adaptive Locking:**  The type of lock (spin lock, mutex, semaphore) is determined by the access pattern of the partition.  High-contention partitions may use more sophisticated lock algorithms.
*    **Lock Elision**: For read-only partitions, lock elision may be employed to reduce overhead.

**5. Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Contention:** Dynamic partitioning isolates hot spots and minimizes contention.
*   **Improved Performance:**  Adaptive granularity optimizes cache utilization and reduces access latency.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:**  The system scales better to multi-threaded workloads.
*    **Automatic Optimization:** The system learns and adapts to changing workloads without manual intervention.
