## Adaptive Shard Management via Predictive Access Patterns

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust data sharding across replica groups based on *predicted* access patterns, rather than solely on current load or static partitioning schemes. This anticipates future hotspots *before* they impact performance, moving data proactively.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component: Access Pattern Predictor (APP)**
    *   Input: Historical query logs, schema information, data update frequency.
    *   Process: Utilizes time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future query patterns.  Specifically focuses on identifying:
        *   Frequently accessed data ranges (keys, segments)
        *   Query types (read/write ratio, complexity)
        *   Time-based access variations (daily, weekly, seasonal trends)
    *   Output: Predicted access score for each data shard/segment. Higher score = higher anticipated access.

*   **Component: Shard Manager (SM)**
    *   Input: Predicted access scores from APP, current shard distribution, replica group health (latency, capacity).
    *   Process:
        1.  **Shard Prioritization:** Ranks shards based on predicted access score.
        2.  **Replica Group Selection:** Identifies replica groups with sufficient capacity and low latency for prioritized shards. Considers geographical proximity to expected access locations.
        3.  **Data Movement:** Initiates data movement (replication/migration) of prioritized shards to selected replica groups. Utilizes a consistent hashing scheme for minimal disruption.  Can utilize a ‘shadow replication’ approach—new writes hit both old and new shards before the cutover.
        4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitors performance (latency, throughput) and adjusts shard distribution in near real-time.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `AccessPatternRecord`: Stores historical access data (timestamp, shard ID, query type, user ID).
    *   `ShardMetadata`: Stores information about each shard (ID, size, replica group assignment, access score).
    *   `ReplicaGroupMetadata`: Stores information about each replica group (ID, capacity, latency, location).
*   **Pseudocode (Shard Manager):**

```
function manageShards() {
  accessScores = APP.predictAccessPatterns()
  sortedShards = sortShardsByAccessScore(accessScores)

  for each shard in sortedShards {
    bestReplicaGroup = findBestReplicaGroup(shard) // based on capacity, latency, location
    if (shard.replicaGroup != bestReplicaGroup) {
      // Initiate data movement (replication/migration)
      moveShard(shard, bestReplicaGroup)
      shard.replicaGroup = bestReplicaGroup
    }
  }
}
```

*   **Communication:** Uses a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure consistency across the SM nodes.
*   **Error Handling:** Implements robust error handling and rollback mechanisms to handle failures during data movement.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to scale horizontally by adding more SM nodes.
*   **Monitoring:** Provides comprehensive monitoring metrics to track performance and identify potential issues.
*   **Integration:** Integrates with existing database infrastructure (query router, storage system).
