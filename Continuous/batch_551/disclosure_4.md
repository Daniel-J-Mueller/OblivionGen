## Dynamic Code Mutation & Self-Correction System

**Concept:** Extend the intermediate configuration object (ICO) to not just *translate* code, but to actively *mutate* and *self-correct* it based on runtime feedback and pre-defined constraints, creating a continually optimizing code base.

**Specifications:**

**1. Extended ICO – “Living Graph”:**

*   The ICO is modified to become a “Living Graph” – a dynamic data structure constantly updated during code execution.  Nodes represent operations *and* their performance metrics (execution time, memory usage, error rate).  Edges represent data dependencies *and* data flow statistics (volume, latency).
*   Each node stores a “constraint set” – a range of acceptable performance metrics and a set of allowed code variations (different algorithms, data structures). This is a developer-defined safety net.
*   Introduce a “mutation engine” tightly coupled to the Living Graph. This engine proposes code variations for individual nodes, respecting the constraint set.  Variations could include algorithm swaps, data structure changes, or minor code refactorings.

**2. Runtime Feedback Loop:**

*   During code execution, a “performance monitor” collects runtime data for each node in the Living Graph.
*   This data is compared against the node’s constraint set.
*   If a constraint is violated, the mutation engine is triggered.
*   The mutation engine generates a set of alternative code implementations for that node.

**3.  Automated A/B Testing & Rollout:**

*   Generated code variations are subjected to automated A/B testing using a shadow deployment strategy. The new version runs alongside the original without affecting live users.
*   Key performance indicators (KPIs) are continuously monitored for each version.
*   If a variation demonstrates significant improvement *and* stays within the defined constraints, it is automatically rolled out to replace the original version in production.

**4.  Constraint Definition Language (CDL):**

*   A dedicated language for defining constraints.  This allows developers to express complex performance expectations and safety boundaries.
    *   Example: `constraint node_1 { max_execution_time: 10ms, max_memory_usage: 1MB, error_rate: < 0.1%, algorithm: [sort_a, sort_b] }`

**5.  ICO Versioning & Rollback:**

*   All changes to the ICO are versioned.
*   Automatic rollback to a previous, stable ICO version is possible in case of catastrophic failure or unexpected behavior.

**Pseudocode – Mutation Engine:**

```
function mutateNode(node):
  if node.constraintViolated():
    possibleVariations = generateCodeVariations(node) //Utilizing pre-defined templates & algorithms
    for variation in possibleVariations:
      variation.test() //Run against shadow deployment
      if variation.performanceMeetsConstraints(node.constraints):
        replaceNode(node, variation)
        log("Node replaced with improved variation")
        break
      else:
        log("Variation failed constraint test")
  else:
    log("Node performance within constraints")
```

**System Components:**

*   **Performance Monitor:** Collects runtime metrics.
*   **Mutation Engine:** Generates and tests code variations.
*   **Shadow Deployment System:**  Facilitates A/B testing.
*   **CDL Compiler:**  Parses and validates constraints.
*   **ICO Version Control:** Manages ICO history.
