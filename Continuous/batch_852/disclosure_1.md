## Modular Floodlight System with Bio-Integrated Cooling

**Concept:** A floodlight system utilizing a modular design with integrated bio-cooling elements. This moves beyond traditional heat sinks by leveraging the evaporative cooling properties of plant matter and microbial activity within a sealed, transparent module.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** Standardized module size: 15cm x 15cm x 10cm. Allows for variable array configurations.
*   **Light Source:** High-efficiency LED array (minimum 100 lumens/watt). Configurable color temperature and intensity via software control. Individual LED failure tolerance â€“ array continues operation with reduced brightness.
*   **Bio-Cooling Module:**
    *   Sealed transparent polycarbonate enclosure.
    *   Hydrogel matrix containing specifically engineered *Synechococcus* cyanobacteria and a network of capillary action wicks.
    *   Embedded miniature moisture sensors and nutrient delivery system.
    *   Internal micro-fan powered by integrated thermoelectric generator (utilizing heat differential).
*   **Modular Connection:** Magnetic, waterproof connection interface allowing for rapid assembly and reconfiguration of arrays. Data/Power transfer via conductive pads.
*   **External Casing:** Weatherproof, recyclable polymer shell with adjustable mounting points.
*   **Control System:** Wireless control via Bluetooth/WiFi. Includes scheduling, dimming, color adjustment, and bio-module health monitoring.
*   **Power Supply:** Standard AC/DC adapter or optional solar panel integration.
*   **Bio-Module Lifespan:** Designed for 6-12 month lifespan, with modular bio-module replacement. Replacement modules pre-populated with cultivated cyanobacteria.
*   **Array Configuration:** Software allowing users to define custom floodlight array shapes and sizes.
*   **Material Specs:**
    *   Polycarbonate: UV resistant, high transparency.
    *   Hydrogel: biocompatible, supports cyanobacterial growth.
    *   Recyclable Polymer: High impact resistance, weatherproof.

**Pseudocode - Bio-Module Control Logic:**

```
FUNCTION monitorBioModuleHealth()
    READ moistureSensorValue()
    READ temperatureValue()

    IF moistureSensorValue() < threshold_low THEN
        activateNutrientPump()
    ENDIF

    IF temperatureValue() > threshold_high THEN
        increaseMicroFanSpeed()
    ENDIF

    LOG data to control system
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION activateNutrientPump()
    openNutrientValve()
    pumpNutrientFor(duration = 5 seconds)
    closeNutrientValve()
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION increaseMicroFanSpeed()
    IF fanSpeed < maxSpeed THEN
        fanSpeed = fanSpeed + 10%
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION

//Run monitorBioModuleHealth() every 5 minutes
```

**Innovation Notes:** This system aims to provide a more sustainable cooling solution for high-power floodlights while offering customizable array configurations. The bio-integrated aspect introduces a dynamic and visually interesting element to the lighting system. The modularity allows for easy repair, upgrade, and adaptation to various lighting needs.
