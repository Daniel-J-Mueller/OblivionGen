## Dynamic Document Persona System

**Concept:** Extend collaborative document editing by associating 'personas' with document versions, influencing the editing experience and content suggestions.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A persona is a JSON object containing:
    *   `name`: (String) User-defined name for the persona (e.g., "Legal Reviewer", "Marketing Copywriter", "Technical Editor").
    *   `expertise`: (Array of Strings) Keywords representing the persona's area of knowledge (e.g., ["contract law", "intellectual property"], ["brand voice", "SEO"], ["circuit design", "thermal management"]).
    *   `style_guide`: (String) URL or embedded text referencing a style guide.  Can be markdown, HTML, or a link to external documentation.
    *   `tone`: (String)  Predefined tone (e.g., "formal", "informal", "technical", "persuasive").
    *   `vocabulary_filter`: (Array of Strings) Preferred/discouraged vocabulary for the persona.
*   **Version Association:** Each document version is tagged with one or more personas.  The system tracks persona history for each version.
*   **Dynamic Editing Interface:** Based on the currently active persona (selected by the user), the editing interface adjusts:
    *   **Suggestion Engine:** AI-powered suggestions tailored to the persona's expertise and style.  (e.g., "Legal Reviewer" persona receives suggestions for precise wording and disclaimers).
    *   **Vocabulary Highlighting:** Highlight words inconsistent with the persona's vocabulary filter.
    *   **Style Guide Integration:**  Real-time style guide checks against the current document content.
    *   **Tone Analyzer:**  Display a 'tone score' indicating how closely the current content aligns with the persona's preferred tone.
*   **Persona Switching:** Users can seamlessly switch between personas while editing. The interface dynamically adapts.
*   **Persona Conflict Resolution:** If multiple personas are associated with a version, the system highlights potential conflicts and provides options for resolution (e.g., weighted preferences, manual override).
*   **Persona Training:** Allow users to 'train' personas by providing feedback on suggestions and corrections.  This data is used to improve the persona's accuracy over time.
* **Overlay Integration:** Existing overlay data is augmented with persona association. Each annotation can be attributed to a specific persona.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function editDocument(document, user, activePersona) {
  interface = dynamicInterface(activePersona);
  suggestionEngine = personaSuggestionEngine(activePersona);
  vocabularyFilter = activePersona.vocabulary_filter;
  styleGuide = activePersona.style_guide;

  while (user is editing document) {
    text = user input;
    suggestion = suggestionEngine.generateSuggestion(text);
    if (vocabularyFilter contains inappropriate words in text) {
      highlight inappropriate words;
    }
    if (styleGuide conflicts with text) {
      display style guide warning;
    }
    display suggestion to user;
    user accepts/rejects suggestion;
    update document with user changes;
  }
}
```

**Possible Applications:**

*   Technical documentation: associate personas for different engineering disciplines.
*   Legal contracts: ensure compliance with specific legal requirements.
*   Marketing copy: maintain a consistent brand voice.
*   Collaborative writing: enable diverse perspectives while maintaining a cohesive style.
