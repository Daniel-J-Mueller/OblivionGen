## Dynamic Virtual Network 'Skinning'

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic IP address modification capability to encompass complete 'skinning' of a virtual machine’s network identity – not just IP, but also MAC address, DNS servers, and even simulated network latency/packet loss profiles – all performed live, without VM downtime.

**Motivation:** Current systems focus on IP address changes for things like load balancing or addressing conflicts.  This system targets realistic simulation of network environments for testing, security analysis, and developer workflows. Imagine a developer needing to test an application under conditions mimicking a slow mobile connection or a compromised DNS server – all done dynamically on a running VM.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Component: Network Identity Manager (NIM)**:  A central service responsible for managing and applying network 'skins'.  
    *   Input: ‘Skin’ Definition (JSON/YAML).  Example:
        ```json
        {
          "skin_name": "Mobile_US_East",
          "ip_address": "192.168.1.150",
          "mac_address": "00:11:22:33:44:55",
          "dns_servers": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"],
          "latency_ms": 150,
          "packet_loss_percent": 5,
          "mtu": 1400
        }
        ```
    *   Output: Confirmation of skin application. Error messages if application fails.
*   **Component: Virtual Network Interface (VNI) Interceptor:** A software module inserted into the hypervisor or networking stack of each VM.
    *   Intercepts all network traffic to/from the VM.
    *   Applies the network skin’s parameters (IP, MAC, DNS, latency, packet loss, MTU) *on the fly* before forwarding/receiving traffic.
    *   Utilizes Traffic Shaping and Network Emulation techniques. (tc command on Linux, Windows Filtering Platform)
    *   Maintains a 'shadow' network configuration allowing for instant rollback to the original configuration.
*   **API:**  RESTful API for managing skins and applying them to VMs.
    *   `POST /skins`: Create a new skin.
    *   `GET /skins/{skin_name}`: Retrieve a skin definition.
    *   `PUT /skins/{skin_name}`: Update a skin definition.
    *   `DELETE /skins/{skin_name}`: Delete a skin.
    *   `POST /vms/{vm_id}/skins/{skin_name}`: Apply a skin to a VM.
    *   `POST /vms/{vm_id}/revert`: Revert a VM to its original network configuration.

**Pseudocode (Apply Skin):**

```
function ApplySkin(vm_id, skin_name):
  skin_definition = GetSkinDefinition(skin_name)
  if skin_definition == null:
    return Error("Skin not found")
  
  original_config = SaveVMNetworkConfig(vm_id) // Capture current IP, MAC, DNS, etc.
  
  SetVMNetworkConfig(vm_id, skin_definition) // Apply new settings via hypervisor/networking API
  
  if VerificationFails(vm_id, skin_definition): // Check if the new config is working
    RestoreVMNetworkConfig(vm_id, original_config) // Rollback
    return Error("Skin application failed")
    
  Log("Skin applied to VM " + vm_id)
  return Success()
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Automated Testing:** Run the same application under diverse network conditions without manual configuration.
*   **Security Auditing:** Simulate compromised network environments to test security responses.
*   **Developer Workflows:**  Easily test applications under realistic mobile or international network conditions.
*   **Disaster Recovery Simulation:** Mimic network outages or disruptions to test recovery procedures.
