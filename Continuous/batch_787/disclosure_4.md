## Autonomous Vehicle Swarm Logistics - Dynamic Mesh Networking & Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Extend indoor autonomous delivery beyond single vehicles to a dynamic swarm managed via a localized mesh network. Focus shifts from pre-defined routes to *predicted* congestion and adaptive task assignment amongst swarm members.

**I. System Architecture**

*   **Swarm Composition:** Multiple (10-100+) autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) operating within a defined indoor space (warehouse, hospital, office complex, etc.). AGVs are smaller footprint – think robotic trays or ‘roomba’ sized, not full-size delivery vans.
*   **Localized Mesh Network:** Dedicated 802.11ah (or similar low-power, long-range Wi-Fi) mesh network deployed throughout the indoor space.  Each AGV acts as a mesh node. This network *does not* rely on existing building Wi-Fi, ensuring consistent coverage and low latency critical for swarm coordination.
*   **Central Coordination Server (CCS):** A server responsible for receiving order requests, assigning tasks to the swarm, and monitoring swarm performance. The CCS *does not* directly control individual AGVs; it issues high-level instructions via the mesh network.
*   **AGV onboard systems:**
    *   Positioning: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) via LiDAR and/or Visual Odometry.
    *   Imaging: RGB-D camera for obstacle detection and identification.
    *   Processing: Edge computing unit (Nvidia Jetson or equivalent) for local path planning and obstacle avoidance.
    *   Communication: 802.11ah mesh networking module.
    *   Payload: Modular payload compartment – configurable for different item types.

**II. Operational Procedure**

1.  **Order Reception:** CCS receives an order request (item, destination).
2.  **Task Decomposition:** CCS decomposes the task into segments (e.g., item pickup, corridor traversal, room entry, delivery).
3.  **Swarm Assignment:** CCS *predicts* congestion and resource availability using real-time swarm data (location, speed, battery level, current task) and assigns task segments to multiple AGVs.  Assignment prioritizes minimizing overall delivery time and maximizing swarm throughput.
4.  **Dynamic Route Planning:** Each AGV uses its local sensor data and the mesh network to plan and execute its assigned segment. AGVs *re-negotiate* routes locally based on detected obstacles or congestion.
5.  **Hand-off:**  AGVs seamlessly hand off the item between themselves as the item progresses towards its destination.
6.  **Congestion Prediction:** Utilizing swarm trajectory data, a predictive model (LSTM or similar) forecasts potential congestion points in the indoor space. This model informs task assignment and route planning.

**III. Pseudocode (AGV – Local Path Planning)**

```
// AGV Local Path Planning Loop

while (true) {

  // Receive Task Segment from Mesh Network (start, end, priority)

  // SLAM data acquisition and environment mapping

  // Detect Obstacles (LiDAR, Camera)

  // Calculate potential paths (A*, D*) – multiple options

  // Evaluate paths based on:
  //   - Distance
  //   - Obstacle avoidance cost
  //   - Predicted congestion (from mesh network data)
  //   - AGV battery level

  // Select optimal path

  // Execute path – move AGV

  // Broadcast updated location and status to mesh network

  // Check for hand-off requests (from other AGVs)

  // If hand-off requested:
  //   - Confirm hand-off
  //   - Transfer item
  //   - Update task status
}
```

**IV. Key Innovations**

*   **Decentralized Swarm Control:** Moves away from centralized control to a more resilient and scalable decentralized approach.
*   **Predictive Congestion Management:** Proactively anticipates and mitigates congestion, improving swarm efficiency.
*   **Dynamic Hand-off:** Enables seamless item transfer between AGVs, maximizing throughput and minimizing delays.
*   **Localized Mesh Networking:** Provides reliable, low-latency communication essential for swarm coordination in complex indoor environments.
