## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion

**Concept:** Expand presence detection beyond simple motion and direction, into full acoustic scene reconstruction using the existing ultrasonic and microphone array, augmented with a low-resolution thermal camera. The goal is to create a dynamic "heat map" of activity, providing a richer understanding of the environment.

**Hardware Specs:**

*   **Ultrasonic Transducers:** Existing array (minimum 4, optimally 8+).  Frequency range: 27-33kHz (as per patent).
*   **Microphone Array:** Existing array (minimum 2, optimally 4+).  Frequency range: 20Hz-20kHz.
*   **Thermal Camera:** Low-resolution (64x64 or 128x128 pixels) long-wave infrared (LWIR) camera. Field of view matched to the ultrasonic/microphone array.  Frame rate: 5-10Hz.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge TPU or equivalent for on-device processing. Minimum 8GB RAM.
*   **Data Storage:** 64GB eMMC or equivalent.

**Software & Algorithm Specs:**

1.  **Data Acquisition & Synchronization:**
    *   Simultaneous acquisition of ultrasonic reflections, audio data, and thermal images.
    *   Hardware timestamping to ensure accurate synchronization.
2.  **Ultrasonic Data Processing:**
    *   Existing Fourier/Logarithmic transform algorithms (from patent) to determine object motion and Doppler shift.
    *   Refine: Implement beamforming to improve spatial resolution and directionality of ultrasonic detection.
    *   Output:  "Motion Probability Map" - a grid representing the likelihood of motion at each location within the detection range.
3.  **Audio Data Processing:**
    *   Existing frequency analysis (from patent).
    *   Refine: Implement sound event detection (SED) - identify specific sounds (e.g., speech, footsteps, object manipulation).
    *   Output: "Sound Event Map" – a grid representing the probability of specific sound events at each location.
4.  **Thermal Data Processing:**
    *   Thermal image calibration and noise reduction.
    *   Object segmentation and identification of heat signatures.
    *   Output: “Heat Signature Map” - a grid representing the temperature distribution and presence of heat sources.
5.  **Sensor Fusion:**
    *   Weighted averaging of Motion Probability Map, Sound Event Map, and Heat Signature Map. Weights dynamically adjusted based on environmental conditions and signal quality (SNR, thermal contrast).
    *   Bayesian network to model relationships between sensors and infer the presence/activity of objects.
    *   Output: “Acoustic Scene Reconstruction” – a dynamic, 3D representation of the environment, highlighting the location and activity of objects.
6.  **Machine Learning Integration:**
    *   Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the fused sensor data to recognize patterns and predict future activity.
    *   Utilize reinforcement learning to optimize sensor fusion weights and improve accuracy over time.

**Pseudocode (Sensor Fusion):**

```
function fuse_sensors(motion_map, sound_map, thermal_map):
  // Normalize maps to 0-1 range
  motion_map = normalize(motion_map)
  sound_map = normalize(sound_map)
  thermal_map = normalize(thermal_map)

  // Dynamically adjust weights based on signal quality
  weight_motion = calculate_weight(motion_quality)
  weight_sound = calculate_weight(sound_quality)
  weight_thermal = calculate_weight(thermal_quality)

  // Weighted averaging
  fused_map = (weight_motion * motion_map) + (weight_sound * sound_map) + (weight_thermal * thermal_map)

  return fused_map

function calculate_weight(signal_quality):
  // Signal quality metrics: SNR, contrast, confidence
  // Weight based on signal quality, ensuring sum of weights = 1
  // Example:
  if signal_quality > 0.8:
    weight = 0.5
  elif signal_quality > 0.5:
    weight = 0.3
  else:
    weight = 0.2
  return weight
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced security systems with more accurate intrusion detection.
*   Smart home automation based on occupancy and activity patterns.
*   Elderly care monitoring with fall detection and activity tracking.
*   Retail analytics with customer behavior analysis.
*   Automated building management with occupancy-based HVAC control.
