**Dynamic Notch Polarization for Enhanced Viewing Angle**

**Concept:** Instead of fixed color notches, implement micro-electrowetting structures *within* the notch itself, allowing dynamic polarization of light emitted/reflected from that region. This would effectively widen the viewing angle of the display by ‘steering’ light.

**Specs:**

1.  **Notch Structure:** The notch is constructed not solely from photoresist/pigment, but with integrated microfluidic channels (dimensions: 1-5um width, 50-200um length). These channels run the length of the notch.

2.  **Electrolyte/Polarization Fluid:**  The microfluidic channels are filled with an electrowetting-compatible electrolyte solution containing birefringence-inducing particles (e.g., aligned liquid crystals, or elongated nanoparticles).

3.  **Micro-Electrodes:**  A network of individually addressable micro-electrodes is embedded *within* the barrier layer and directly beneath the microfluidic channels. These electrodes are patterned to allow precise control of the fluid's orientation within each channel segment. (Electrode spacing: 5-10um).

4.  **Control System:** A dedicated control circuit processes image data to determine the optimal polarization state for each notch segment based on viewing angle and desired image characteristics. This could be tied into a head-tracking system for active viewing angle correction.

5.  **Notch Geometry:** The notch width remains consistent, but the height can be dynamically adjusted via electrowetting to control the amount of light emitted/reflected.  (Height variation: 20-50% of initial notch height).

6. **Integration with Color Filters:** Color filters are segmented and aligned with individual notch sections to enable true color polarization. This ensures accurate color representation despite polarization adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
FOR each pixel:
    FOR each notch segment within the pixel:
        IF viewer_angle > threshold_angle:
            calculate_polarization_direction(viewer_angle, notch_segment_position)
            apply_voltage_to_microelectrodes(polarization_direction)
            adjust_notch_height(desired_brightness)
        ELSE:
            set_default_polarization()
            set_default_notch_height()
```

**Materials:**

*   Standard photoresist for barrier layer
*   Electrowetting-compatible electrolyte
*   Birefringence-inducing particles (liquid crystals/nanoparticles)
*   Transparent conductive material for micro-electrodes (ITO/Graphene)
*   Segmented Color filters

**Expected Outcome:** Enhanced viewing angles (up to 60-degree improvement), potentially increased contrast ratio and improved color accuracy across various viewing positions. This allows for a broader, more immersive viewing experience without image distortion.
