## Modular Suction Cup Array with Dynamic Filtration

**Concept:** A dynamically reconfigurable array of suction cups, each incorporating the core filtration technology of the provided patent, but with integrated microfluidic channels for localized analysis and selective material capture. The array is designed for robotic systems needing versatile surface interaction and material handling.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** Hexagonal close-packed arrangement of individual suction cup/filter units. Array size scalable from 3x3 to 10x10 units.
*   **Unit Dimensions:** 25mm diameter suction cup, 15mm filter housing height. Total unit height: 20mm.
*   **Suction Cup Material:** Silicone with variable durometer options for different surface conformances.
*   **Filter Material:**  Porous PTFE membrane with pore size customizable per unit (50nm – 5µm).  Filter incorporates the flange described in the patent.
*   **Microfluidic Channels:** Each unit contains two integrated microfluidic channels:
    *   *Input Channel:* Connects to the downstream side of the filter.  Fluid is drawn through the filter via micro-pump integrated into the robotic arm base.
    *   *Output Channel:* Routes filtered fluid to a central analysis module.
*   **Valve System:** Each unit incorporates a micro-valve (piezoelectric or micro-electromechanical system – MEMS) to independently control fluid flow through the unit.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Each unit includes:
    *   *Pressure Sensor:*  Monitors suction cup adherence and potential blockages.
    *   *Optical Sensor:*  Detects material captured by the filter, providing basic material identification (color, turbidity).
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wireless communication (Bluetooth Low Energy) to robotic arm controller for individual unit control and sensor data transmission.
*   **Power Supply:**  Power delivered via conductive pads on robotic arm interface.
*   **Mounting:** Standardized mounting interface (magnetic or mechanical) for easy array reconfiguration.

**Operation:**

1.  The robotic arm positions the suction cup array onto a surface.
2.  Each suction cup engages, creating a seal.
3.  Fluid is drawn through the filters in each unit.
4.  The robotic arm controller adjusts suction pressure and activates/deactivates individual micro-pumps and valves to control fluid flow.
5.  Sensors provide feedback on adhesion and captured material.
6.  Filtered fluid is routed to a central analysis module (spectrometer, mass spectrometer) for detailed composition analysis.

**Pseudocode (Robotic Arm Controller):**

```
// Initialize array configuration (e.g., 5x5)
array_size = 5
array = create_array(array_size)

// Define scan pattern (e.g., serpentine)
scan_pattern = "serpentine"

// Define analysis parameters (e.g., target molecule)
target_molecule = "contaminant_X"

// Main loop
while (surface_unscanned) {

  // Position array over surface area
  move_array(scan_pattern)

  // Activate suction on all cups
  activate_suction(array)

  // Start micro-pumps on selected cups (based on analysis needs)
  for each cup in array {
    if (cup.analysis_required) {
      activate_pump(cup)
    }
  }

  // Read sensor data from each cup
  for each cup in array {
    read_pressure(cup)
    read_optical_sensor(cup)
  }

  // Analyze filtered fluid (external module)
  send_fluid_to_analyzer(array)

  // Process analyzer results and adjust suction/pump parameters
  adjust_parameters(analyzer_results)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated surface cleaning and decontamination.
*   Selective material harvesting (e.g., micro-particle collection).
*   On-site environmental monitoring.
*   Automated lab-on-a-chip systems.
