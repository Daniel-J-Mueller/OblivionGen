## Adaptive Bloom Filter Sharding with Predictive Re-Hashing

**Concept:** Instead of a single Bloom filter, employ a dynamically sharded Bloom filter system. Shards are not statically assigned based on the entry itself, but adaptively assigned based on *predicted* collision rates within each shard. Furthermore, incorporate a predictive re-hashing mechanism triggered by shard saturation.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Creation:** Initial system starts with 'N' shards (N configurable).
*   **Hashing Functions:** Maintain a pool of 'K' hash functions. Each shard is initially assigned a subset of these 'K' hash functions.
*   **Entry Assignment:** Upon insertion, an entry is hashed using all 'K' functions. The system evaluates the predicted collision rate for each shard using the resulting hash values and current shard occupancy.
*   **Collision Prediction:** Implement a statistical model (e.g., based on Poisson distribution) to estimate the probability of collisions within each shard based on its current occupancy and the expected number of entries that will hash to that shard.
*   **Shard Selection:** Select the shard with the *lowest predicted* collision rate for insertion.
*   **Shard Saturation Threshold:** Define a saturation threshold (e.g., 80% occupancy).
*   **Dynamic Re-Hashing:** When a shard reaches its saturation threshold:
    *   Select a subset of entries within the saturated shard.
    *   Re-hash these entries using a *different* set of hash functions (chosen from the pool of 'K' functions).
    *   Distribute these re-hashed entries across available shards based on the lowest predicted collision rate.
    *   If no suitable shards exist, create a new shard and populate it with the re-hashed entries.
*   **Shard Merging:** Periodically evaluate shard occupancy. If multiple shards fall below a low occupancy threshold, merge them into a single shard to optimize memory usage.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   Shard Metadata: Each shard stores its current occupancy, associated hash functions, and a list of entries.
    *   Global Metadata: Stores shard information, hash function pool, and configuration parameters.

**Pseudocode (Insertion):**

```
function insertEntry(entry):
  hashValues = calculateHashValues(entry, hashFunctionPool)
  
  bestShard = null
  lowestPredictedCollisionRate = infinity
  
  for each shard in shardList:
    predictedCollisionRate = calculatePredictedCollisionRate(shard, hashValues)
    
    if predictedCollisionRate < lowestPredictedCollisionRate:
      lowestPredictedCollisionRate = predictedCollisionRate
      bestShard = shard
      
  if bestShard is null:
    bestShard = createNewShard()
    
  bestShard.addEntry(entry)
  
  if bestShard.occupancy > saturationThreshold:
    rehashShard(bestShard)

function rehashShard(shard):
  entriesToRehash = selectEntriesForRehashing(shard) # e.g. random sample
  
  newHashFunctions = selectNewHashFunctions() 
  
  for entry in entriesToRehash:
    newHashValue = hashEntry(entry, newHashFunctions)
    findBestShardForNewHash(newHashValue) # Same logic as initial insertion
    moveEntryToNewShard(entry)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced Collision Rates: Dynamic shard assignment minimizes collisions and improves Bloom filter accuracy.
*   Scalability: Adaptive sharding allows the system to scale horizontally by adding more shards as needed.
*   Improved Performance: Parallelizing operations across shards enhances performance.
*   Resource Optimization: Merging underutilized shards optimizes memory usage.
