## Adaptive Device Roles & Dynamic Account Switching

**Concept:** Extend fleet account management to encompass dynamically assigned device *roles* within the account, enabling seamless switching between personalized and shared-use modes. This leverages the existing account registration and configuration framework to create a more versatile and user-friendly experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Role Definition & Configuration (Server-Side):**

*   **Role Types:** Predefined roles (e.g., "Student – Math", "Sales Associate – Demo Mode", "Guest – Basic Browser") and customizable roles with configurable parameters.
*   **Parameter Sets:** Each role has associated parameter sets defining:
    *   Allowed applications
    *   Network access restrictions
    *   Data access limitations
    *   UI customizations (e.g., home screen layout, allowed widgets)
    *   Peripheral access controls (e.g. camera, microphone)
*   **Account-Level Role Assignment:** Administrator assigns roles to users *within* the managed account.  A user can be assigned multiple roles.
*   **Device Role Profiles:** The server maintains a profile for *each* device registered to the account detailing available roles and current active role.

**2. Dynamic Role Switching (Client-Side):**

*   **Authentication/Role Selection:** Upon device boot or user login, the device presents a role selection screen (if multiple roles are assigned to the user). Alternatively, role switching can be triggered via a dedicated UI element or voice command.
*   **Configuration Download:** Selected role initiates a request to the server. The server responds with a configuration package for the selected role. This includes app lists, network settings, UI customizations, and any necessary provisioning scripts.
*   **Runtime Configuration:** The device applies the received configuration, launching/terminating apps, modifying network settings, and adjusting the UI accordingly.
*   **Persistent Role Data:** A small amount of persistent data on the device tracks the current role and user preferences *within* that role.

**3.  Context-Aware Role Activation (Advanced):**

*   **Geofencing:**  Configure roles to activate automatically based on the device’s location (e.g., “Sales Demo” mode when in a retail store).
*   **Beacon Integration:** Use Bluetooth beacons to trigger role switching based on proximity to specific hardware or displays.
*   **Scheduled Activation:** Schedule roles to activate at specific times of day (e.g., “Student – Reading” mode during class hours).
*    **App Launch Trigger:** When a whitelisted application is launched, the system can prompt the user to switch to the appropriate role.

**4. Server-Side Management & Monitoring:**

*   **Role Template Library:**  A central repository of pre-configured role templates.
*   **Real-Time Monitoring:**  Track active roles on each device.
*   **Remote Configuration Override:**  Administrators can remotely override device configurations, even within an active role, for troubleshooting or emergency updates.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side – Role Switching):**

```
function onRoleSelection(roleID):
  sendRequestToServer(roleID)

function handleServerResponse(configurationPackage):
  // Kill all running apps
  // Apply network settings from configurationPackage
  // Launch allowed apps from configurationPackage
  // Apply UI customizations
  // Update persistent role data
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased device utilization and flexibility.
*   Improved user experience through tailored device configurations.
*   Enhanced security and control over device access.
*   Simplified device management for administrators.
