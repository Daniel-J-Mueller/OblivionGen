## Adaptive Vulnerability ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Drift Analysis

**System Specification:** A supplemental module integrated with the existing vulnerability records manager (VRM). This module facilitates ‘shadowing’ of vulnerabilities across interconnected systems, coupled with predictive analysis of vulnerability drift – anticipating how a vulnerability’s characteristics will change over time.

**Core Concept:** Current systems largely treat vulnerabilities as static entities. However, vulnerabilities *evolve*. Attack vectors shift, exploits are modified, and the impact varies based on the specific system configuration. This system proactively models these changes.

**Components:**

1.  **Vulnerability Shadowing Engine (VSE):**
    *   Continuously monitors for propagation of vulnerabilities across interconnected systems (defined by network topology, service dependencies, asset relationships).
    *   Employs graph database technology (Neo4j or similar) to represent system interdependencies and vulnerability propagation paths.
    *   Tracks *variants* of vulnerabilities as they manifest in different environments – capturing unique exploit code, modified configurations, or altered impact profiles.
    *   Automatically generates ‘shadow’ records linking the original vulnerability to its variants.

2.  **Drift Prediction Model (DPM):**
    *   Utilizes machine learning (specifically, time-series forecasting and anomaly detection) to predict how vulnerability characteristics (CVSS score, exploitability, impact) will change over a defined timeframe.
    *   Considers factors like:
        *   Emerging threat intelligence (new exploit code, active attacks).
        *   System configuration changes (patching, upgrades, new deployments).
        *   Environmental factors (network traffic, user behavior).
        *   Historical vulnerability trends.
    *   Outputs probabilistic forecasts for vulnerability characteristics, including confidence intervals.

3.  **Dynamic Risk Scoring Engine (DRSE):**
    *   Integrates the outputs of the VSE and DPM to dynamically recalculate risk scores for vulnerabilities.
    *   Factors in the probability of exploitation, potential impact, and the predicted drift in vulnerability characteristics.
    *   Provides prioritized remediation recommendations based on the dynamic risk scores.

**Pseudocode (Simplified – Core Logic):**

```
//Vulnerability Shadowing Engine
function shadowVulnerability(originalVulnerability, targetSystem) {
  //Identify dependencies between the original system and targetSystem
  dependencies = getSystemDependencies(originalSystem, targetSystem)
  //Check if vulnerability is exploitable on targetSystem
  exploitability = checkVulnerabilityExploitability(originalVulnerability, targetSystem, dependencies)
  if (exploitability) {
    //Create a shadow record for the vulnerability on the targetSystem
    shadowRecord = createShadowRecord(originalVulnerability, targetSystem)
    //Store shadow record in graph database
    storeShadowRecord(shadowRecord)
  }
}

//Drift Prediction Model
function predictVulnerabilityDrift(vulnerability, timeframe) {
  //Collect historical data (exploit patterns, system changes, threat intel)
  historicalData = collectHistoricalData(vulnerability)
  //Train ML model on historical data
  model = trainMLModel(historicalData)
  //Predict future vulnerability characteristics
  predictedCharacteristics = model.predict(vulnerability, timeframe)
  return predictedCharacteristics
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Vulnerability Record:** (Existing) – CVSS score, description, affected systems, etc.
*   **Shadow Record:**  Vulnerability ID, Shadow System ID, Exploitable (Boolean), Modified Exploit Code (String), Modified CVSS Score (Float).
*   **Dependency Graph:**  Node (System ID), Edge (Dependency Type – e.g., ‘service calls’, ‘network connection’).

**Integration Points:**

*   VRM:  Provides initial vulnerability data.
*   Automated Risk Analyzer: Receives dynamic risk scores.
*   Reporting/Presentation Layer:  Displays vulnerability propagation paths and predicted drift.

**Novelty:** Moves beyond static vulnerability assessments to a proactive, dynamic model that anticipates how vulnerabilities will evolve, enabling more effective risk mitigation. Focuses on the *change* in vulnerability, not just the present state.
