**Dynamic Terrain Layering with Procedural Destruction & Re-Composition**

**Concept:** Extend the layer-based terrain system by introducing procedural destruction *and* re-composition.  Instead of pre-defined destructibility, layers respond to impact (explosions, weapons) with physics-based fracturing and particle effects. Critically, the system doesn't just remove material; it actively *re-composes* the terrain using a library of procedural building blocks – creating new formations, caves, or structures *in situ*.

**Specs:**

*   **Terrain Layer Definitions:** Extend existing layer characteristics to include:
    *   `FractureProfile`:  Defines how a layer breaks under stress (fragment size, number of fragments, fracture pattern - radial, planar, volumetric).
    *   `RecompositionProfile`: Specifies the procedural building blocks available for terrain reconstruction.  This could be a library of pre-made rock formations, cave sections, or even vegetation clusters.  Includes parameters for variation (scale, rotation, texture).
    *   `CohesionValue`: Represents the binding force between layers.  Higher values require more force to separate layers during destruction.
    *   `MaterialDensity`: Defines the mass and resistance to force for a layer.
*   **Destruction Engine:**
    *   Impact detection and force propagation.  Consider raycasting or volumetric collision detection.
    *   Layer separation based on `CohesionValue` and impact force.
    *   Fracture simulation using a physics engine (e.g., rigid body dynamics). Fragments should interact realistically.
    *   Particle generation for visual effects (dust, debris).
*   **Recomposition Engine:**
    *   Post-destruction analysis: Identify voids and unstable areas.
    *   Procedural block selection:  Based on the `RecompositionProfile` of the affected layer, select appropriate building blocks.
    *   Void filling & stabilization:  Place and orient building blocks to fill voids and create stable formations.  Ensure smooth transitions between procedural and existing terrain.
    *   Texture blending: Seamlessly blend textures between procedural blocks and existing terrain.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `LayerData`: { `FractureProfile`, `RecompositionProfile`, `CohesionValue`, `MaterialDensity`, `textureID`, `normalMapID` }
    *   `FragmentData`: { `position`, `rotation`, `scale`, `physicsHandle`, `textureID`, `normalMapID` }
*   **Pseudocode – Recomposition Step:**

```pseudocode
function recomposeTerrain(voidArea, layerData) {
  buildingBlocks = layerData.RecompositionProfile.getBlockLibrary()
  
  for (each void space in voidArea) {
    bestBlock = findBestBlock(void space, buildingBlocks) // Based on size, shape, and connection points
    
    newBlock = instantiateBlock(bestBlock)
    newBlock.position = void space.center
    newBlock.rotation = calculateOptimalRotation(void space, newBlock)
    
    connectBlockToTerrain(newBlock, surroundingTerrain) // Blend edges, adjust normals
  }
}
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   This system requires significant processing power, so optimization is crucial.
*   Consider using a multi-threaded approach for destruction and recomposition.
*   Level of Detail (LOD) techniques should be employed to reduce polygon count.
*   This would be especially effective in environments with frequent destruction and rebuilding (e.g., warzones, dynamic construction scenarios).
*   Could be extended with AI to create more realistic and varied terrain formations.
