**Dynamic Probabilistic Scene Completion with Temporal Fusion**

**Concept:** Extend the probabilistic object representation to entire scenes, enabling dynamic scene completion based on limited input and temporal data fusion for enhanced robustness and accuracy.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Scene Graph Construction:**
    *   Input: Video stream or sequence of images.
    *   Process: Utilize a feature detection algorithm (SIFT, ORB, etc.) to identify key points and features within each frame. Construct a sparse 3D scene graph representing the environment. Nodes represent features, edges represent spatial relationships.
    *   Output: Sparse 3D scene graph.

2.  **Probabilistic Feature Mapping:**
    *   Input: Sparse 3D scene graph, pre-trained object data (as per the provided patent).
    *   Process: For each feature in the scene graph, determine the most likely object(s) it belongs to based on the probability distributions stored in the object data.  Assign a probability score to each object hypothesis.
    *   Output: Scene graph with object hypotheses and associated probability scores.

3.  **Temporal Data Fusion:**
    *   Input: Sequence of scene graphs (from temporal data), object hypotheses, probability scores.
    *   Process: Implement a Kalman filter or particle filter to track the evolution of object hypotheses over time.  Fuse evidence from multiple frames to refine probability scores and reduce uncertainty.  Utilize motion estimation to predict the location of objects in future frames.
    *   Output: Refined scene graph with improved object identification and tracking.

4.  **Scene Completion:**
    *   Input: Refined scene graph, object data.
    *   Process:  Based on the identified objects and their estimated poses, reconstruct the missing parts of the scene.  Utilize generative models (e.g., GANs, diffusion models) to fill in the gaps and create a complete 3D scene representation.
    *   Output: Complete 3D scene representation.

5.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**
    *   Process: Continuously monitor the incoming data and update the probabilistic models based on new observations. Implement an online learning algorithm to adapt to changing environments and improve the accuracy of scene completion over time.

**Pseudocode (Scene Completion Step):**

```
function completeScene(refinedSceneGraph, objectData):
  completedScene = deepcopy(refinedSceneGraph)
  for each node in completedScene:
    if node.objectIdentifier == null:  // Node hasn't been identified
      topKObjects = findTopKObjects(node, objectData)  // Based on feature similarity
      for each object in topKObjects:
        generatePartialModel(object) //Generate a model for the object
        attemptToMerge(partialModel, node) //Merge with node
        if mergeSuccess:
           node.objectIdentifier = object.id
           break
    if node.objectIdentifier != null:
      // Fill in missing parts of the object
      generateMissingParts(node.objectIdentifier, node.pose)
  return completedScene
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance GPU for generative model inference.
*   Depth sensor (e.g., LiDAR, Time-of-Flight camera) to improve scene reconstruction.
*   Real-time processing capabilities for video streams.
