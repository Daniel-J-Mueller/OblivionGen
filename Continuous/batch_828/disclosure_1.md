## Adaptive Acoustic Focusing – Multi-Element Speaker Array

**Concept:** Expand beyond a single speaker and gasket arrangement to a distributed multi-element speaker array within the device enclosure. This allows for beamforming and adaptive acoustic focusing, creating a localized 'sweet spot' for sound output and improving spatial audio experiences.

**Specifications:**

*   **Speaker Array:** Minimum of 4, maximum of 16 micro-speakers, arranged in a planar or slightly curved configuration. Speaker size: 8mm - 12mm diameter.
*   **Element Control:** Each speaker element individually driven by a dedicated audio amplifier channel on the PCB.
*   **Beamforming Algorithm:** Implement a real-time beamforming algorithm (e.g., delay-and-sum, minimum variance distortionless response) to steer the sound beam towards a user's expected ear position.
*   **User Detection:** Integrate a basic proximity sensor or utilize camera-based head tracking (if available) to estimate user ear position.
*   **Gasket System:** A shared, continuous gasket surrounds the entire speaker array assembly, sealing it to the enclosure. The gasket material must be compliant enough to accommodate minor variations in speaker element height.
*   **Spring Contact System:** Individual, fine-pitch spring contacts connect each speaker element to dedicated test points on the PCB. These contacts *must* be redundant – two contacts per terminal, to mitigate single-point failure.
*   **PCB Layout:** PCB features dedicated power and ground planes for each amplifier channel.
*   **Software Interface:** An API for controlling beamforming parameters (e.g., target direction, beam width, gain). User-adjustable presets.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Algorithm - Simplified):**

```
//Input: Array of speaker signals, target direction (azimuth, elevation), sampling rate
function beamform(speakerSignals[], targetAzimuth, targetElevation, sampleRate):
    delays = []
    for i in range(numSpeakers):
        // Calculate distance from speaker i to target direction
        distance = calculateDistance(speakerPosition[i], targetAzimuth, targetElevation)

        // Calculate delay in samples
        delay = distance / speedOfSound * sampleRate

        delays.append(delay)

    // Apply delays to speaker signals
    delayedSignals = []
    for i in range(numSpeakers):
        delayedSignal = shiftSignal(speakerSignals[i], delays[i])
        delayedSignals.append(delayedSignal)

    // Sum the delayed signals
    outputSignal = sum(delayedSignals)

    return outputSignal
```

**Material Specifications:**

*   **Gasket:** Silicone rubber or thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), Shore A hardness 40-60.
*   **Spring Contacts:** Beryllium copper or phosphor bronze, gold-plated.
*   **Speaker Array Substrate:** FR4 or flexible PCB material.

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Explore the use of acoustic lenses or diffusers to further shape the sound field.
*   Implement noise cancellation algorithms to improve audio clarity.
*   Investigate the use of bone conduction transducers as a supplementary audio output method.
*   Optimize the speaker array layout and beamforming algorithm for specific device form factors and user scenarios.
