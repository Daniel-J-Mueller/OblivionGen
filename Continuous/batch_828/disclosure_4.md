## Dynamic Legibility Masking & Content Adaptation

**Concept:** Extend the legibility assessment beyond simply flagging an image as "illegible". Instead, create a dynamic mask that identifies *specifically* illegible regions of text, and then adapt the content based on those regions. This goes beyond simply rejecting the image – it aims to salvage usable information.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Illegibility Map Generation:**

   *   **Input:** Image containing text.
   *   **Process:**
        1.  Employ the existing connected component analysis and legibility classifier (as described in the patent) to determine a confidence level for each text component.
        2.  Generate a grayscale “illegibility map” where pixel intensity corresponds to the *inverse* of the confidence level.  Higher intensity pixels indicate lower confidence (more illegible).
        3.  Apply a threshold to the illegibility map to create a binary mask. Pixels exceeding the threshold are marked as ‘illegible’.
        4.  **Adaptive Thresholding:** Implement a rolling/local threshold calculation on the illegibility map. This accounts for variations in lighting, image quality and font styles. Instead of a single global threshold, each local region will use a tailored threshold to identify illegible sections more accurately.
   *   **Output:** Binary mask representing illegible text regions.

**2. Content Adaptation Module:**

   *   **Input:** Original image, illegibility mask.
   *   **Process:**
        1. **Region-Specific Enhancement:** Based on the size and shape of the illegible regions, apply one or more of the following techniques:
            *   **Contrast Adjustment:** Enhance contrast *only* within the non-illegible regions.
            *   **Edge Sharpening:** Sharpen edges within the non-illegible areas to improve clarity.
            *   **Inpainting:** Attempt to reconstruct missing text using inpainting algorithms (carefully constrained to the masked areas).  This is most effective for small gaps or noise.
            *   **Blurring/Redaction:**  Blur or redact severely illegible regions to remove distracting noise.  This prevents the classifier from falsely identifying noise *as* text.
        2.  **OCR Re-attempt (Selective):** If the original OCR process failed, re-attempt OCR *only* on the non-illegible regions.  This increases the likelihood of accurate text extraction.
        3.  **Content Summarization (Advanced):** If the illegibility significantly impacts the overall content (e.g., a scanned document), employ natural language processing (NLP) to summarize the *legible* portions.  This extracts the core information despite the issues.
        4.  **Metadata Generation:** Generate metadata indicating the percentage of the image that is considered illegible, along with details about the applied adaptation techniques.
   *   **Output:** Enhanced/Adapted image, extracted text (if applicable), metadata.

**3. Training Data Augmentation:**

   *   **Process:**
        1.  Create synthetic training data by introducing controlled levels of noise, blur, and occlusion to existing images.
        2.  Generate corresponding illegibility maps for this synthetic data.
        3.  Train the legibility classifier and adaptation algorithms on this augmented dataset. This improves robustness and generalization performance.

**Pseudocode (Content Adaptation Module):**

```
function adaptImage(image, illegibilityMask):
  enhancedImage = image.copy()

  for each pixel in illegibilityMask:
    if pixel == 'illegible':
      # Apply enhancement/redaction techniques
      if pixelArea < thresholdSmall:
        enhancedImage = inpaint(enhancedImage, pixel)
      else:
        enhancedImage = blur(enhancedImage, pixel)

  #Reattempt OCR on enhanced image
  ocrText = performOCR(enhancedImage)

  # Generate metadata
  illegibilityPercentage = calculateIllegibilityPercentage(illegibilityMask)
  metadata = {
    "illegibilityPercentage": illegibilityPercentage,
    "enhancementTechniques": ["inpaint", "blur"]
  }

  return enhancedImage, ocrText, metadata
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simple classification; it attempts to *recover* information from degraded images and provide a more usable output, while also providing valuable metadata about the image quality.  The combination of dynamic masking, region-specific enhancement, and content summarization is a novel approach to addressing illegibility issues.
