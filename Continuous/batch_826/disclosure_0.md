**Dynamic Workspace Zoning with Augmented Reality Overlays**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A distributed network of ultra-wideband (UWB) and vision-based sensors (cameras with depth sensing) covering the workspace. UWB provides precise real-time location tracking (RTLS) of all objects and personnel, while vision sensors provide object identification & categorization.
*   **Processing Unit:** A dedicated edge computing server cluster. This cluster executes algorithms for sensor fusion, predictive modeling, and AR rendering.
*   **Augmented Reality Interface:** AR-capable headsets (e.g., HoloLens, Magic Leap) or AR-enabled tablets/smartphones for operators.
*   **Light Curtain Integration:** Existing light curtain systems are integrated as *one* input into the sensor fusion algorithm, primarily as a safety override signal.
*   **Dynamic Zoning Engine:** Software module responsible for defining and adjusting workspace zones in real-time. These zones are not fixed physical barriers but are *virtual* constructs.
*   **Predictive Modeling Module:** Leverages machine learning to anticipate potential safety hazards or workflow bottlenecks based on tracked object movement, operator behavior, and pre-defined operational rules.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Wireless communication using 5G/Wi-Fi 6E for low latency and high bandwidth. Secure communication protocols implemented.
*   **Power Supply:** Redundant power supplies with UPS backup.

**Innovation Description:**

The system moves beyond static safety barriers (like light curtains) and fixed zones. It creates a truly *dynamic* workspace where safety and workflow are managed through augmented reality and predictive analysis.

Here’s how it functions:

1.  **Real-time Tracking:** UWB and vision sensors continuously track the location and identity of all objects (mobile drive units, containers, etc.) and personnel within the workspace.
2.  **Zone Creation & Adjustment:** The Dynamic Zoning Engine creates virtual zones (e.g., “Loading Zone,” “Inspection Area,” “Restricted Access”) overlaid onto the physical workspace via the AR interface. Zones are defined based on current operational needs.
3.  **AR Overlay & Guidance:** Operators wearing AR headsets see these zones visually highlighted in their field of view. The AR interface provides real-time guidance and warnings.
4.  **Predictive Hazard Analysis:** The Predictive Modeling Module analyzes tracked data to anticipate potential collisions, near misses, or workflow obstructions. 
5.  **Dynamic AR Warnings:** Based on predictive analysis, the AR interface generates dynamic warnings:
    *   **Path Highlighting:**  Safe paths for mobile drive units are highlighted.
    *   **Proximity Alerts:**  Operators receive visual and auditory alerts when approaching restricted zones or moving objects.
    *   **Virtual Barriers:**  Temporary, virtual barriers are overlaid on the AR view to prevent access to hazardous areas.
6. **Light Curtain Override:** The light curtain system remains as a fail-safe.  If a breach is detected, it triggers an immediate “emergency stop” signal *and* overlays a full-screen, high-contrast warning on the AR interface.
7. **Workflow Optimization:** The system can also optimize workflow by dynamically adjusting zone layouts based on real-time demand. For example, if a particular inspection area becomes congested, the system can automatically expand the zone or redirect traffic.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Predictive Hazard Analysis):**

```
FUNCTION AnalyzeHazard(object1, object2, currentTime):
  distance = CalculateDistance(object1.location, object2.location)

  IF distance < object1.safeDistance + object2.safeDistance:
    collisionProbability = CalculateCollisionProbability(object1.velocity, object2.velocity, distance)

    IF collisionProbability > threshold:
      GenerateARWarning(object1.operator, "Potential Collision")
      AdjustPath(object1) // Suggest alternative route
      ActivateVirtualBarrier(object2) // Temporary slowdown
  ENDIF

  //Check for light curtain breach
  IF lightCurtainBreached():
    emergencyStop()
    displayEmergencyWarningAR()
  ENDIF

END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

This innovation differs from the original patent by replacing fixed physical barriers with a dynamic, AR-based system managed by predictive analytics. It enhances safety *and* workflow efficiency, offering a more flexible and adaptable workspace. The core novelty lies in the integration of predictive modeling with AR visualization and real-time location tracking to proactively manage hazards and optimize operations.
