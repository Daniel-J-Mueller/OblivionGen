## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & Composition

**Concept:** Expand on the notification queuing by introducing dynamic prioritization and intelligent composition of notifications *before* delivery to the webclient, leveraging predicted user intent.

**Specifications:**

**1. Intent Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:**  Webclient interaction history (clicks, search queries, message composition, application usage). Notification content (subject, sender, keywords). Time of day, user location (optional, with permission).
*   **Process:**  Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, transformer) trained on user interaction data.  Model outputs a 'relevance score' for each queued notification, representing predicted user interest.
*   **Output:**  Augmented notification queue with relevance scores.

**2. Notification Composition Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Augmented notification queue (with relevance scores). Notification content. User-defined rules/preferences (e.g., "Group notifications from specific senders," "Summarize similar notifications").
*   **Process:**
    *   **Grouping:** Cluster similar notifications based on content analysis and sender.
    *   **Summarization:** Generate concise summaries of grouped notifications, highlighting key information. (Utilize abstractive summarization techniques).
    *   **Prioritization:**  Sort notifications based on relevance score *and* user-defined rules.  High-priority notifications are presented first.
    *   **Dynamic Content Injection:** Based on predicted user intent, augment notifications with relevant actions or information. (e.g., If the user is predicted to be traveling, include flight details in a notification about a delayed package).
*   **Output:**  Composed notification package for delivery to the webclient.

**3.  Delivery Mechanism:**

*   **Integration with Existing System:**  Modify the existing HTTP server to incorporate the Intent Prediction Module and Notification Composition Engine.
*   **Delivery Format:** Utilize a standardized format (e.g., JSON) to represent the composed notification package.  Include metadata about the composition process (e.g., which notifications were grouped, the summarization algorithm used).
*    **A/B Testing:** Implement A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different composition strategies and personalization techniques.

**Pseudocode (Notification Composition Engine):**

```
function composeNotifications(notificationQueue, userPreferences):
  groupedNotifications = groupSimilarNotifications(notificationQueue)
  summarizedNotifications = summarizeNotifications(groupedNotifications)
  prioritizedNotifications = prioritizeNotifications(summarizedNotifications, userPreferences)
  augmentedNotifications = augmentNotifications(prioritizedNotifications, predictedUserIntent)
  return augmentedNotifications

function groupSimilarNotifications(queue):
  //Implement clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means, DBSCAN)
  //Based on content similarity (e.g., TF-IDF, semantic similarity)
  return groupedQueue

function summarizeNotifications(queue):
  //Implement abstractive summarization algorithm (e.g., BART, T5)
  //Generate concise summaries for each group
  return summarizedQueue

function prioritizeNotifications(queue, preferences):
  //Apply user-defined rules and relevance scores
  //Sort notifications accordingly
  return prioritizedQueue

function augmentNotifications(queue, intent):
  //Inject relevant actions/information based on predicted intent
  //e.g., add buttons for quick actions, display relevant context
  return augmentedQueue
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Sufficient computational resources to run the ML model (GPU acceleration recommended).
*   A robust API for accessing user interaction data.
*   Scalable storage for storing user profiles and ML models.
*   A message queue for handling asynchronous notification delivery.
