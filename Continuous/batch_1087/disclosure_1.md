## Adaptive Color Balancing via Electrowetting and Spectral Analysis

**Concept:** Integrate a micro-spectrometer directly into the electrowetting display pixel structure to achieve dynamic, per-pixel color balancing based on ambient light and viewing angle. This goes beyond simply adjusting brightness; it aims for true color accuracy regardless of external conditions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Pixel Structure Modification:** Each electrowetting pixel will incorporate a miniature diffraction grating and a micro-spectrometer composed of a linear silicon photodiode array. This spectrometer will be positioned to analyze light transmitted *through* the activated (opaque oil retracted) portion of the pixel, measuring the spectral composition of the light.
*   **Spectrometer Integration:** The micro-spectrometer will be fabricated using standard microfabrication techniques and integrated *onto* the first support plate alongside the TFT structure, utilizing existing metal layers for electrical connections. The diffraction grating will be a nano-imprinted polymer layer deposited over the reflective metal portion.
*   **Light Path Design:** The electrowetting cell geometry must allow sufficient light transmission through the activated pixel area to reach the spectrometer. Precise alignment of the oil droplet retraction path with the spectrometer input is critical. A micro-lens array can be incorporated to focus the transmitted light onto the spectrometer.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated processing unit (integrated within the timing controller) will analyze the spectral data from each pixel’s spectrometer in real-time. This analysis will determine the color cast introduced by ambient light and viewing angle.
*   **Electrowetting Modulation:** The control system will then dynamically adjust the voltage applied to the electrowetting pixel, controlling the oil droplet shape and color filter effect. This adjustment will compensate for the measured color cast, ensuring accurate color reproduction. The system will aim for a closed-loop feedback system, constantly adjusting the voltage to maintain color accuracy.
*   **Color Space Mapping:** The system will support multiple color spaces (sRGB, Adobe RGB, DCI-P3) and allow for user-defined color profiles. A lookup table will map the measured spectral data to the appropriate electrowetting voltage adjustments for each color space.
*   **Communication Protocol:** The timing controller will communicate with an external display controller via a high-speed serial interface (e.g., MIPI DSI) to transmit the spectral data and receive the updated color profile information.
*   **Calibration Procedure:** A factory calibration process will be required to characterize the spectral response of each pixel’s spectrometer and the relationship between the electrowetting voltage and the color filter effect. This calibration data will be stored in a non-volatile memory within the timing controller.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Per-Pixel Loop
for each pixel in display:
    // Read Spectrometer Data
    spectralData = readSpectrometer(pixel);

    // Analyze Spectral Data
    colorCast = analyzeColorCast(spectralData);

    // Calculate Electrowetting Voltage Adjustment
    voltageAdjustment = calculateVoltageAdjustment(colorCast, currentElectrowettingVoltage);

    // Apply Voltage Adjustment
    applyVoltage(pixel, voltageAdjustment);
end for
