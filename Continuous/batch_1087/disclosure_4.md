## Predictive Disassembly & Parts Ordering

**Concept:** Extend the replacement part identification to *proactively* anticipate disassembly needs based on search/purchase history and present a complete kit, including tools *and* instructional material, alongside the parts.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:**
    *   User Search History: Track search terms beyond just part names – include terms like "repair", "fix", "broken", “how to”.
    *   Purchase History: Record not just parts, but also tools, guides, and any related items.
    *   Product Model Database: Extensive database linking product models to common failure points, disassembly procedures, and required tools.
    *   Community-Sourced Repair Data: Integrate data from online repair forums, video tutorials (YouTube, iFixit), and user-submitted repair logs.  Rank data by user validation/upvotes.
*   **Predictive Engine:**
    *   Algorithm: Bayesian Network / Markov Model trained on the combined data.  Probability assigned to disassembly events based on search/purchase patterns.
    *   Trigger: When a user searches for a part *and* the predictive engine assesses a >70% probability of a larger disassembly event (e.g., searching for a phone screen *and* history indicates cracked screens usually require battery connector replacement), initiate a ‘Disassembly Kit’ suggestion.
*   **Disassembly Kit Generation:**
    *   Parts List: Generate a comprehensive list of *all* potentially required parts, not just the initially searched item. Include consumables (adhesive, screws).
    *   Tool List: Based on disassembly procedures, identify required tools (specialized screwdrivers, spudgers, heat guns).  Offer tool rental or purchase options.
    *   Instructional Material: Link to (or generate) step-by-step disassembly guides (text, images, video). Leverage community-sourced content whenever possible. Offer AR overlays for guided disassembly.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   “Disassembly Kit” Card: Presented alongside regular parts search results.
    *   Kit Contents Preview: Detailed list of parts, tools, and instructional materials.
    *   AR Integration: Option to view AR overlay of disassembly steps on the actual device (using phone camera).
    *   Dynamic Pricing: Offer kit discounts compared to purchasing items individually.

**Pseudocode (Kit Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateDisassemblyKit(user_search_term, user_purchase_history, product_model):
  probability = CalculateDisassemblyProbability(user_search_term, user_purchase_history, product_model)

  IF probability > 0.7 THEN
    parts_list = GetRecommendedParts(product_model, user_search_term)
    tools_list = GetRecommendedTools(product_model, parts_list)
    guides_list = GetDisassemblyGuides(product_model)

    kit = {
      "parts": parts_list,
      "tools": tools_list,
      "guides": guides_list,
      "price": CalculateKitPrice(parts_list, tools_list)
    }

    RETURN kit
  ELSE
    RETURN standard_parts_results
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Skill Level Assessment: Tailor kits based on user-reported technical skill level (beginner, intermediate, expert).
*   Warranty Integration: Offer extended warranties on kits to cover potential damage during repair.
*   Trade-In Program: Offer discounts on kits in exchange for broken devices.
*   Subscription Service: Offer recurring kits for common maintenance tasks.
