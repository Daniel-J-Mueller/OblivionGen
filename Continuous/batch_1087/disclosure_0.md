## Adaptive Key Rotation with Temporal Sharding

**Concept:** Extend the multi-key encryption and redundancy concept to incorporate *temporal* sharding alongside spatial redundancy.  Instead of simply rotating keys periodically, fragment data not only across storage devices but also across *time* using different key versions. This drastically increases security and resilience against compromise.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Initial Encryption:**

*   Upon receiving a data object, generate a primary first cryptographic key (K1) specifically for that object.
*   Encrypt the data object using K1.
*   Apply a redundancy encoding scheme (e.g., Reed-Solomon) to generate shards.
*   Distribute shards across multiple data storage devices as in the original patent.

**2. Temporal Key Sharding & Versioning:**

*   Divide the lifespan of the data object into 'epochs' (e.g., 30 days).
*   For each epoch:
    *   Generate a new second cryptographic key (K2_n, where 'n' is the epoch number).
    *   Encrypt K1 using K2_n.
    *   Store the encrypted K1 (with K2_n) alongside the shards of the data object. *Critically*, tag this encrypted K1 with the epoch number 'n'.
    *   Rotate K2_n to a new K2_(n+1) at the start of each epoch.  Old K2 keys are *not* immediately deleted but archived.

**3. Data Retrieval:**

*   Upon request for the data object, determine the current epoch.
*   Retrieve all shards of the data object.
*   Retrieve the K1 encrypted with the *current* epoch's K2 key (K2_current).
*   Decrypt K1 using K2_current.
*   Decrypt the data object using K1.

**4. Key Compromise Handling:**

*   If a K2 key is compromised:
    *   Identify all data objects encrypted with the corresponding K1 (using metadata tagging).
    *   Re-encrypt those K1s with a newly generated, secure K2 key.
    *   Update metadata pointers to the new K2 key.
    *   This isolates the damage to only data encrypted during the compromised epoch, drastically reducing the blast radius.

**5. Archiving & Historical Access:**

*   Archived K2 keys are retained for a configurable period.
*   To access data from a past epoch:
    *   Retrieve the appropriate archived K2 key (based on the dataâ€™s epoch).
    *   Use that archived K2 key to decrypt the corresponding K1.
    *   Decrypt the data object using K1.

**Pseudocode (Data Retrieval):**

```
function retrieveData(dataObjectId, currentEpoch):
    shards = retrieveShards(dataObjectId)
    encryptedK1 = retrieveEncryptedK1(dataObjectId, currentEpoch) // Retrieve K1 encrypted with the *current* K2
    K2 = getK2ForEpoch(currentEpoch) // Fetch the current K2 key
    K1 = decrypt(encryptedK1, K2)
    data = decrypt(shards, K1)
    return data
```

**Novelty:**

This builds on the patent's key management by adding a temporal dimension to the sharding and encryption. Traditional key rotation often involves re-encrypting all data, a costly and time-consuming process.  Temporal sharding minimizes the scope of re-encryption in case of compromise and enables access to historical data with minimal overhead.  The ability to isolate compromised epochs significantly enhances security.
