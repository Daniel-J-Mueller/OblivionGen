## Dynamic Credential 'Shadowing' with Behavioral Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the concept of contextual credential injection by layering a 'shadow' credential that adapts in real-time based on observed user behavior. This isn’t simply *adding* context, but dynamically *modifying* the effective credential based on ongoing activity.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Monitoring Module:**
   *   Continuous monitoring of user actions: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, application usage, network traffic patterns, time-of-day access, geographical location (if permitted).
   *   Baseline Establishment:  Establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user during initial sessions.  Utilize statistical methods (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) to capture normal activity.
   *   Anomaly Detection:  Implement an anomaly detection algorithm.  Deviations from the baseline profile trigger alerts and potential credential adjustments.  Severity levels (low, medium, high) based on the degree of deviation.

**2. Dynamic Credential Adjustment Engine:**
   *   Policy Definition: Define policies that map anomaly severity levels to specific credential modifications. These can include:
        *   **Context Injection:**  Add contextual information like “access from unusual location,” “suspicious application usage,” or “deviated keystroke pattern.”
        *   **Permission Reduction:** Temporarily revoke or reduce access to sensitive resources.  e.g., reducing read/write access.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication Trigger:** Initiate a second factor authentication challenge.
        *   **Session Restriction:** Limit the duration of the current session.
   *   Credential Shadowing:  Instead of directly modifying the original credential, create a "shadow" credential that overlays the original. The shadow credential contains the dynamic adjustments.  All access requests are evaluated against both credentials.
   *   Adjustment Logging: All credential adjustments and their triggers are meticulously logged for audit and analysis.

**3.  API Integration:**
   *   **Behavioral Data Feed:** API for receiving behavioral data from various sources (endpoint agents, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, etc.).
   *   **Policy Management API:** API for defining and managing dynamic credential adjustment policies.
   *   **Credential Interception/Shadowing API:** API for intercepting credential requests and applying the shadow credential.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
Function EvaluateAccess(user, resource, originalCredential):
  behavioralData = GetBehavioralData(user)
  anomalyLevel = DetectAnomaly(behavioralData, user)
  shadowCredential = GenerateShadowCredential(anomalyLevel, user)
  combinedCredential = MergeCredentials(originalCredential, shadowCredential)
  accessGranted = CheckAccess(combinedCredential, resource)
  LogAccessAttempt(user, resource, accessGranted, combinedCredential)
  return accessGranted
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `BehavioralData`: Timestamped log of user actions (keystrokes, mouse movements, application usage, network traffic, location).
*   `AnomalyProfile`: Statistical representation of normal user behavior.
*   `ShadowCredential`:  Dynamically generated credential containing context injections and permission adjustments.
*   `PolicyRule`: Maps anomaly severity levels to credential modifications.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Machine Learning Adaptation:** Use machine learning to automatically refine anomaly profiles and policy rules.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Correlate user behavior with threat intelligence feeds to identify potentially malicious activity.
*   **User Feedback Loop:** Allow users to provide feedback on credential adjustments to improve accuracy.
