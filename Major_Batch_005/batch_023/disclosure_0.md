## Dynamic Predictive Occlusion Mapping for Multi-Camera Systems

**Concept:** Augment the existing multi-camera selection system with a predictive occlusion mapping layer. Instead of *only* determining if an object is within a camera’s field of view *now*, predict where it will be in a short timeframe and factor in potential occlusions (blockages) from static or dynamic elements in the environment. This creates a “probability of capture” score, guiding camera selection *before* an event unfolds.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time object tracking data (position, velocity, predicted trajectory).
    *   3D environmental map (static obstacles - buildings, trees, etc.).
    *   Dynamic object tracking (vehicles, people - predicted trajectories).
    *   Camera positions, orientations, and FOV parameters (as already defined in the patent).
    *   Historical occlusion data (learning common blockage patterns).
*   **Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Trajectory Prediction:**  Utilize a Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm to estimate the object's future position over a defined time horizon (e.g., 3-5 seconds).  Update this prediction with each new data point.
    2.  **Raycasting & Occlusion Testing:** For each camera:
        *   Cast rays from the camera's perspective towards the predicted object positions at various points in the time horizon.
        *   Test for intersections with objects in the 3D environmental map and dynamic object tracks.
        *   Calculate an occlusion score for each ray (0 = clear view, 1 = completely blocked).  Use a weighted average based on the severity of the occlusion (partial blockage = intermediate score).
    3.  **Probability of Capture Calculation:**
        *   For each camera and each predicted object position, calculate a combined score: `Capture Score = (1 - Occlusion Score) * Image Quality Score`. The Image Quality Score could factor in resolution, zoom level, lighting conditions, etc.
        *   Aggregate the capture scores over the prediction horizon.  Higher scores indicate a greater probability of capturing the event.
    4.  **Camera Selection:** Select the camera(s) with the highest aggregate capture scores.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   High-performance computing platform for real-time processing.
    *   3D LiDAR or depth sensors for environmental mapping (optional, can use pre-built maps).
    *   Network connectivity for data sharing between cameras and processing platform.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   Object tracking module.
    *   3D environmental mapping engine.
    *   Raycasting and collision detection library.
    *   Machine learning module for historical occlusion pattern learning.
    *   API for integration with existing camera control system.
*   **Pseudocode (Camera Selection Logic):**

```
function select_camera(object, environment_map, cameras):
  predicted_trajectories = predict_trajectory(object)
  camera_scores = {}

  for camera in cameras:
    camera_scores[camera] = 0

    for trajectory_point in predicted_trajectories:
      occlusion_score = calculate_occlusion(camera, trajectory_point, environment_map)
      image_quality_score = calculate_image_quality(camera, trajectory_point)
      capture_score = (1 - occlusion_score) * image_quality_score
      camera_scores[camera] += capture_score

  best_camera = max(camera_scores, key=camera_scores.get)
  return best_camera
```

**Novelty:** The addition of *predictive* occlusion mapping goes beyond simply determining if a camera can *see* an object now. It anticipates potential obstructions and proactively selects the camera most likely to capture the event, even if the object is temporarily obscured. This significantly improves system reliability and reduces missed events.
