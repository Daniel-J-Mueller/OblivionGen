## Adaptive File Shadowing with Behavioral Heuristics

**Concept:** Extend static entropy analysis with dynamic behavioral shadowing. Instead of solely reacting to entropy *changes*, actively monitor file access patterns *after* a potential malware event (like a high entropy shift). This allows for nuanced detection beyond simple encryption – identifying malicious behavior even with minimal file modification.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadowing Agent:**
   * **Deployment:** Kernel-level driver or privileged system service.
   * **Activation Trigger:** Entropy threshold exceeded *OR* signature match (existing AV solution - this augments, not replaces).
   * **Function:** Creates a “shadow copy” of the affected file’s metadata and initial data block(s).  This shadow copy is stored in a secure, isolated area (encrypted).
   * **Monitoring:**  Tracks *all* read/write operations to the original file.
   * **Data Logging:** Logs the following for each operation: Timestamp, Process ID, User ID, Offset, Length, Access Type (Read/Write), and resulting data block (for writes).  This data is compressed and stored with the shadow copy.
   * **Reconstruction:**  Can reconstruct a complete timeline of changes to the file.

**2. Behavioral Analysis Engine:**

   * **Input:** Shadow copy metadata, logged operation data.
   * **Heuristics:** 
      * **Data Flow Analysis:** Track where data read from the file is sent (process, network). Unusual destinations flag suspicious activity.
      * **Control Flow Analysis:** Monitor processes accessing the file.  Rapid, sequential access from multiple unrelated processes suggests potential malicious code execution.
      * **API Call Sequencing:** Track API calls made by processes accessing the file.  Specific sequences (e.g., file open -> read -> network send -> file write) associated with known malware are flagged.
      * **Entropy Drift Analysis (Post-Event):** Monitor the entropy *of the logged write blocks* over time. A sustained increase or erratic pattern suggests ongoing encryption or data corruption.
      * **Anomaly Detection:** Establish baseline behavioral profiles for common file types (e.g., documents, executables).  Deviations from the baseline are scored as risk factors.
   * **Scoring:** Assign a risk score based on the cumulative weight of observed heuristics.
   * **Alerting:** Trigger alerts based on configurable risk score thresholds.

**3. Remediation Actions:**

   * **File Isolation:** Quarantine the affected file.
   * **Process Termination:** Terminate any processes involved in malicious activity.
   * **Rollback:** Restore the file to its shadowed state. (Optionally, offer a recovery feature for legitimate modifications).
   * **Forensic Data Export:** Export the logged data for detailed analysis.

**Pseudocode (Behavioral Analysis Engine – Simplified):**

```
function analyze_behavior(shadow_copy, log_data):
  risk_score = 0

  # Data Flow Analysis
  for event in log_data:
    if event.access_type == "Write":
      destination = get_destination(event.process_id, event.data)
      if is_suspicious_destination(destination):
        risk_score += 20

  # Control Flow Analysis
  processes = get_processes_accessing_file(log_data)
  if len(processes) > 5 and are_processes_unrelated(processes):
    risk_score += 15

  # Entropy Drift Analysis (Post-Event)
  entropy_changes = calculate_entropy_changes(log_data)
  if max(entropy_changes) > 0.1:  # Threshold
    risk_score += 10

  # Anomaly Detection (Simplified)
  file_type = get_file_type(shadow_copy)
  if file_type == "Executable" and len(log_data) > 100:
    risk_score += 5

  return risk_score
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond reactive entropy changes to *actively monitor behavior* after a potential threat. It provides a much more granular and contextual understanding of file access, reducing false positives and improving the detection of sophisticated malware. The behavioral data also provides valuable forensic information for incident response.
