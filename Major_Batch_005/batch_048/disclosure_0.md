## Adaptive Volumetric Soundscapes

**Core Concept:** Expand the layered plane concept into the audio domain, creating volumetric soundscapes that react to viewer position and orientation, enhancing the 3D visual effect and adding a new dimension of immersion.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sound Plane Assignment:** Associate audio content (sound effects, music, ambient sounds) with individual planes of content as defined in the core patent. Each plane becomes a “sound plane.”

2.  **Volumetric Audio Rendering:** Employ a spatial audio rendering engine (e.g., Ambisonics, Dolby Atmos) capable of positioning sound sources in 3D space relative to the viewer.

3.  **Depth-Based Audio Attenuation & Filtering:**
    *   Calculate the distance between the viewer’s estimated position (via camera tracking) and each sound plane.
    *   Apply distance-based attenuation to the audio output from each plane. Closer planes are louder, more distant planes are quieter.
    *   Implement frequency filtering based on depth.
        *   Higher frequencies are attenuated more rapidly with distance, simulating realistic sound propagation.
        *   Lower frequencies are preserved for distant planes, contributing to a sense of spaciousness.

4.  **Occlusion Modeling:** Implement raycasting from sound sources on each plane to the viewer.
    *   If a ray is blocked by another plane (determined by Z-depth comparison), apply a partial or complete occlusion effect to the sound, simulating a blocked sound wave.
    *   Occlusion severity should be adjustable based on the material properties of the occluding plane.

5.  **Dynamic Soundscape Adaptation:**
    *   Continuously update the spatial audio rendering based on the viewer’s position and orientation, ensuring the soundscape remains consistent with the visual perspective.
    *   Implement smooth transitions between sound perspectives as the viewer moves, avoiding jarring changes.

6.  **Procedural Sound Generation:**
    *   Integrate procedural audio generation capabilities, allowing soundscapes to dynamically adapt to the visual content. For example, if a visual element on a plane is destroyed, the corresponding soundscape should reflect that event.

7.  **Software Interface:**
    *   Develop a user-friendly interface for assigning audio content to planes, adjusting attenuation and filtering parameters, and defining occlusion behaviors.
    *   The interface should integrate seamlessly with existing visual content creation tools.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
FOR EACH sound_plane IN scene:
    position = sound_plane.position
    distance = calculate_distance(viewer_position, position)

    attenuation = calculate_attenuation(distance)
    filtering = calculate_filtering(distance)

    sound = sound_plane.audio_content
    processed_sound = apply_attenuation_and_filtering(sound, attenuation, filtering)

    is_occluded = check_occlusion(sound_plane, viewer_position)

    IF is_occluded:
        processed_sound = apply_occlusion_effect(processed_sound)

    render_audio(processed_sound, spatial_position)

```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive gaming experiences
*   Virtual and augmented reality environments
*   Interactive museum exhibits
*   Enhanced video conferencing and communication
*   Realistic training and simulation systems
