## Dynamic Payment Splitting & Micro-Investment Integration

**Concept:** Expand the funds transfer system to facilitate dynamic payment splitting *during* a transaction, coupled with automated micro-investment of split amounts. This moves beyond simple payer-to-payee transfers and integrates financial tools directly into the payment flow.

**Specifications:**

**1. Split Configuration Module:**

*   **Function:** Allows the payer (and optionally, the payee) to pre-define or modify payment split rules *during* transaction initiation.
*   **Input:** Percentage allocations to multiple recipients (beyond the primary payee).  Rule triggers based on transaction amount thresholds (e.g., 1% to charity for transactions > $100).  Time-based splits (e.g., 5% to savings account monthly).
*   **UI:** Integrated into the existing web-based user interface, accessible during the payment request confirmation stage.  Visual split representation (pie chart, bar graph) to show allocation percentages.
*   **Data Storage:**  Persistent storage of payer-defined split rules, linked to the payer's account.

**2. Micro-Investment Engine:**

*   **Integration:** API connection to a brokerage or investment platform.
*   **Function:** Automatically invests split amounts into predefined investment portfolios (e.g., low-risk bond funds, diversified ETFs). Payer selects risk profile and investment preferences.
*   **Account Management:** Creates and manages micro-investment accounts for payers (or links to existing brokerage accounts).
*   **Transaction Handling:**  Automated purchase of investment assets based on split amounts. Minimum investment thresholds handled gracefully (e.g., accumulating funds until threshold is met).

**3. Real-time Payment Routing:**

*   **Modification of Existing System:**  The existing funds collection (credit card) and disbursement (ACH) processes are expanded to handle multiple recipients.
*   **Logic:** The system calculates split amounts based on the defined rules. Funds are collected via the existing credit card processing. The system initiates multiple ACH transfers (or equivalent payment methods) to the designated recipients.
*   **Transaction Logging:** Detailed transaction logs including split amounts, recipient details, and investment information.

**4. Enhanced Fraud Detection:**

*   **Rule-based System:**  Implement rules to flag unusual split patterns (e.g., sudden changes in allocation percentages, transfers to suspicious accounts).
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Utilize machine learning to identify anomalous transaction behavior based on historical data.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:**  Require multi-factor authentication for transactions involving significant split amounts or transfers to new recipients.

**Pseudocode (Split Processing):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessPayment(Payer, Payee, Amount, SplitRules):
  CollectFunds(Payer, Amount)
  TotalSplitAmount = Amount
  FOR EACH SplitRule IN SplitRules:
    SplitAmount = CalculateSplitAmount(SplitRule, TotalSplitAmount)
    IF SplitRule.Type == "PAYEE":
      InitiateACHTransfer(SplitAmount, SplitRule.RecipientAccount)
    ELSE IF SplitRule.Type == "INVESTMENT":
      InvestFunds(SplitAmount, SplitRule.InvestmentPortfolio)
    END IF
    TotalSplitAmount -= SplitAmount
  END FOR
  InitiateACHTransfer(TotalSplitAmount, Payee.Account)
END FUNCTION
```

**UI Considerations:**

*   Visual representation of split allocations during payment confirmation.
*   Clear labeling of investment options and associated risks.
*   User-friendly interface for managing split rules and investment portfolios.
*   Integration with existing account management features.
