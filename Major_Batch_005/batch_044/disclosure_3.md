## Dynamic Focal Plane Array with Computational Refraction

**Concept:** Integrate the dedicated image processor (ASIC) described in the patent with a micro-lens array and a computational refraction engine. This creates a dynamic focal plane capable of actively adjusting depth of field *after* image capture, and potentially ‘looking around’ corners via software.

**Specs:**

*   **Micro-Lens Array (MLA):**  A dense array of individually controllable micro-lenses placed directly over the camera sensor(s). Each micro-lens has adjustable curvature/refractive index via micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) or liquid crystal control. Resolution of MLA control must match or exceed sensor resolution.
*   **ASIC Integration:** The existing ASIC's ISP and DSP functionalities are retained.  New module: "Refraction Engine" added.
*   **Refraction Engine:**
    *   Input: Raw image data from the sensor(s), control signals for the MLA.
    *   Processing:
        1.  **Scene Reconstruction:** Using multi-view geometry and information from the MLA control, a sparse 3D point cloud of the scene is created. This leverages the ability to effectively change the focal plane *after* capture.
        2.  **Ray Tracing & Refraction Simulation:**  A simplified ray tracing engine simulates how light would have interacted with the scene if the MLA had been configured differently *during* capture.  This bypasses the limitations of traditional optics.
        3.  **Image Synthesis:** Based on the ray tracing results, a new 2D image is synthesized, representing the scene as if it had been captured with a different focal plane or viewing angle.
        4.  **Adaptive Resolution Enhancement:** Based on the depth map, resolution can be adaptively applied. Regions of high depth variance get higher resolution while shallower areas receive lower resolution.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Sensor(s) capture raw image data.
    2.  Raw data fed to both ISP and Refraction Engine.
    3.  ISP performs standard image correction.
    4.  Refraction Engine receives corrected data and MLA control signals.
    5.  Refraction Engine generates a synthesized image or a depth map.
    6.  Synthesized image (or enhanced image) combined with ISP output.
    7.  Final image sent to Application Processor.
*   **MLA Control Algorithm:**  A learning algorithm (potentially a Reinforcement Learning agent) that optimizes MLA configuration to achieve desired effects (e.g., maximizing depth of field, identifying objects, simulating different viewpoints).
*   **Power Considerations:** The MEMS or liquid crystal control of the MLA must be low-power to minimize impact on battery life. Offloading the refraction calculation to the ASIC reduces power draw on the application processor.
*   **Communication Bus:** Dedicated high-bandwidth bus between the MLA control system, ASIC, and sensors.



**Pseudocode (Refraction Engine - Simplified):**

```
function refractImage(rawData, mlConfig, depthMap):
  // mlConfig: Micro-lens array configuration parameters
  // depthMap: Estimated depth map of the scene

  scenePoints = reconstructScene(rawData, mlConfig, depthMap) // Generate 3D point cloud

  newImage = createEmptyImage()

  for each pixel in newImage:
    ray = createRayFromPixel(pixel)
    intersectionPoint = traceRay(ray, scenePoints) // Find intersection with 3D scene

    if intersectionPoint:
      color = calculateColor(intersectionPoint) // Calculate color based on lighting & material properties
      newImage[pixel] = color
    else:
      newImage[pixel] = black

  return newImage
```
