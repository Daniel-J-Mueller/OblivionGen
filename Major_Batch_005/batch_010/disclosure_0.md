## Dynamic Dependency Graph Replication for Accelerated Microservice Creation

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Instead of a static dependency analysis during microservice extraction, implement a *runtime* dependency graph replication system.  The system monitors application behavior during a representative workload. This allows for identification of *actual*, rather than statically predicted, dependencies.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Behavioral Monitor:**  A lightweight agent inserted into the running monolithic application. It intercepts function calls, inter-process communication (IPC), and network requests.
*   **Dependency Graph Builder:**  Receives telemetry from the Behavioral Monitor.  It constructs a dynamic, weighted graph representing runtime dependencies between application components.  Weights indicate frequency and duration of interactions.
*   **Replication Engine:**  Responsible for creating independently deployable microservices.  It leverages the dynamic dependency graph.
*   **Shadow Executor:** A sandboxed environment mirroring the monolithic application's runtime. Used to validate the extracted microservice's behavior *before* deployment.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Instrumentation:** The monolithic application is instrumented with the Behavioral Monitor.
2.  **Workload Execution:** A representative workload is executed against the instrumented application.
3.  **Dependency Graph Construction:** The Dependency Graph Builder collects runtime data and constructs the dynamic dependency graph. Thresholds are applied to filter out noise or infrequent interactions.
4.  **Microservice Candidate Selection:**  Nodes within the dependency graph are assessed for independent deployability based on:
    *   **Degree of Connectivity:**  Lower degree indicates a stronger candidate.
    *   **Weighted Dependency Sum:**  The sum of weights of all incoming and outgoing edges. Lower sum suggests reduced coupling.
    *   **Critical Path Analysis:** Identifying components on critical paths and delaying their extraction to maintain overall system performance.
5.  **Microservice Extraction:** Selected components, along with their identified dependencies (including necessary data schemas, APIs, and configuration files), are extracted.
6.  **Shadow Execution & Validation:** The extracted microservice is deployed to the Shadow Executor. A set of automated tests, mirroring the workload used for graph construction, are executed against the microservice.  Performance metrics and functional correctness are validated.
7.  **Deployment & Integration:**  If the microservice passes validation, it's deployed to the production environment.  The monolithic application is updated to communicate with the new microservice via network calls.

**IV. Pseudocode (Dependency Graph Builder):**

```
class DependencyGraph:
    nodes = {}
    edges = []

    def add_node(component_name):
        if component_name not in nodes:
            nodes[component_name] = {}

    def add_edge(source, destination, weight):
        edge = (source, destination, weight)
        edges.append(edge)

    def calculate_dependency_score(component_name):
        total_weight = 0
        for source, destination, weight in edges:
            if destination == component_name:
                total_weight += weight
        return total_weight

# Within the Behavioral Monitor:
on_function_call(source_component, destination_component):
    timestamp = current_time()
    duration = measure_execution_time(destination_component)
    weight = 1 / duration  #Higher weight for faster calls
    dependency_graph.add_edge(source_component, destination_component, weight)
```

**V. Novelty:**

This system differs from static analysis approaches by capturing *runtime* dependencies, which can reveal hidden couplings and improve microservice isolation. The Shadow Executor provides a robust validation step before deployment, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs or performance regressions.  The dynamic weighting system prioritizes frequently used, fast-responding components, maximizing the benefits of microservice decomposition.
