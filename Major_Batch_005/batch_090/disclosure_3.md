## Haptic Data Glove with Modular Sensor Array

**Concept:** A data glove utilizing microfluidic haptic feedback and a modular, wirelessly powered sensor array. The glove isn’t meant to *replace* existing input methods, but to augment them with nuanced tactile and force feedback, and the ability to ‘feel’ digital objects.

**Specs:**

*   **Glove Base Material:** Knit fabric with integrated conductive threads for gesture recognition. Lightweight, breathable, and washable. Sizing: XS-XXL.
*   **Microfluidic Haptic System:** Array of microfluidic channels woven into the glove's fingertips and palm. Channels are filled with a non-Newtonian fluid (Magnetorheological fluid preferred) controlled by micro-pumps.
*   **Pump Control:** Each micro-pump is individually addressable, controlled by a low-power microcontroller integrated into the glove’s wrist section.
*   **Sensor Array Modules:** Small, rectangular modules (1cm x 2cm x 0.5cm) containing:
    *   Force/Pressure sensors (piezoelectric or capacitive).
    *   Temperature sensor.
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit – accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer).
    *   Wireless Power Receiver (Qi standard preferred).
    *   Bluetooth 5.0 LE transmitter.
*   **Mounting System:**  Magnetic docking system on the glove's surface for attaching/detaching sensor modules.  Modules 'snap' into place and are securely held by neodymium magnets embedded within both the module and the glove fabric.
*   **Power Source:**  Wireless charging base. Glove contains a rechargeable lithium-polymer battery. Estimated battery life: 8 hours continuous use.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Bluetooth 5.0 LE to a host device (PC, VR headset, etc.). Data transmitted includes sensor readings, glove orientation, and haptic feedback commands.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Control):**

```
FUNCTION applyHapticFeedback(finger, intensity, texture)

  // 'finger' = 0-4 (Thumb-Pinky)
  // 'intensity' = 0-100 (Percentage of max pump force)
  // 'texture' = Array of force values representing a pattern

  IF finger >= 0 AND finger <= 4 THEN
    // Calculate pump force based on intensity
    pumpForce = intensity * maxPumpForce

    // Apply force to microfluidic channel
    activateMicroPump(finger, pumpForce)

    // Apply texture (if provided)
    IF texture != NULL THEN
      FOR each value IN texture
        activateMicroPump(finger, value)
        delay(10ms) // Adjust delay for desired texture frequency
      END FOR
    END IF
  END IF

END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

The combination of modular sensor arrays, magnetic mounting, and microfluidic haptics provides a highly adaptable and customizable input/output device. Users could swap out sensor modules based on specific applications (e.g., high-precision force sensing for robotics, thermal sensing for environmental monitoring).  The magnetic mounting allows for easy repair/replacement of modules, and the microfluidic haptics offer a more nuanced and realistic tactile experience compared to traditional vibrotactile feedback.
