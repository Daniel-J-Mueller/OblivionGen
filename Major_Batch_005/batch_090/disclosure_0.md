## Dynamic Contextual ‘Shells’ for Device Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the environmental condition concept to create ephemeral, dynamically generated ‘shells’ around devices, defining interaction parameters beyond simple proximity or connection status. These shells aren't physical; they're data constructs representing intended device behavior based on complex, real-time contextual analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Shell Generation Module:** A software component running on a central server (or distributed across edge devices) responsible for creating and managing contextual shells.  Input data: User routines, device context data (location, connectivity, sensor readings), environmental data (time of day, weather, ambient noise), user preferences, and learned behavior patterns.
*   **Shell Data Structure:**  A nested data structure defining the shell’s boundaries, properties, and active rules. 
    *   `ShellID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `AnchorDeviceID`: The primary device the shell is centered around.
    *   `BoundaryType`: (e.g., Geofence, Bluetooth proximity, WiFi coverage, Audio detection radius)
    *   `Radius`:  Numerical value defining boundary extent (dependent on `BoundaryType`).
    *   `ActiveRules`: List of conditional statements defining device behavior within the shell. Each rule consists of:
        *   `TriggerCondition`: (e.g., “User approaches”, “Ambient noise exceeds 60dB”, “Specific device enters the shell”)
        *   `Action`: (e.g., “Activate ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode”, “Adjust smart thermostat”, “Display notification on nearby screen”, “Initiate voice command sequence”)
        *   `Priority`: Numerical value determining rule precedence.
*   **Contextual Data Aggregation:** System for collecting and processing data from various sources. This includes:
    *   Device sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, camera, etc.)
    *   Location services (GPS, WiFi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons)
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, light level)
    *   External data sources (weather APIs, calendar events, news feeds)
*   **Dynamic Shell Adjustment:** Algorithm for automatically adjusting shell boundaries and active rules based on changing contextual data.  This includes:
    *   Expanding/contracting the shell radius based on user movement.
    *   Adding/removing active rules based on environmental conditions.
    *   Prioritizing rules based on user preferences and learned behavior patterns.
*   **‘Shell Casting’ Protocol:** A communication protocol allowing users to create, modify, and share contextual shells with other devices.  This could be implemented using:
    *   A mobile app with a graphical user interface.
    *   Voice commands via a virtual assistant.
    *   Automated routines triggered by specific events.

**Pseudocode (Shell Creation):**

```
function createShell(anchorDeviceID, boundaryType, radius, triggerCondition, action, priority)
{
    shellID = generateUniqueID()
    shell = {
        "ShellID": shellID,
        "AnchorDeviceID": anchorDeviceID,
        "BoundaryType": boundaryType,
        "Radius": radius,
        "ActiveRules": [
            {
                "TriggerCondition": triggerCondition,
                "Action": action,
                "Priority": priority
            }
        ]
    }
    storeShell(shell)
    return shellID
}
```

**Example Use Case:**

A user creates a “Focus Shell” around their desk (defined by a 2-meter geofence). The Active Rule is: “When user enters Focus Shell, activate ‘Do Not Disturb’ mode on all devices, and play ambient noise”.  As the user approaches their desk, the system automatically activates the rule, creating a distraction-free work environment.  If a priority call comes in, the system overrides the rule, allowing the call to go through.
