## Dynamic Recommendation ‘Ecosystem’ Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the idea of multiple “similarities datasets” beyond simply different sources of product data. Create a system where datasets themselves are dynamically weighted and combined as a *single* recommendation source, forming a shifting “ecosystem” of influences. This isn’t about *choosing* the best dataset, but constructing a blended recommendation profile.

**Specs:**

*   **Dataset Categorization:** Define primary categories for datasets (e.g., “Purchase History”, “Trending Now”, “Social Influence”, “Complementary Products”, “User Profile Signals”, “Seasonal/Event Based”, "Geographic"). These aren't mutually exclusive.
*   **Ecosystem Weights:** Each category has a dynamically assigned weight (0.0 – 1.0), totaling 1.0. Weights are adjusted by a reinforcement learning model (see below).
*   **Sub-Dataset Tiering:** Within each category, multiple sub-datasets exist. (e.g. "Purchase History" might include "Last 3 Months", "All Time", "High Value Items"). Each sub-dataset contributes to the overall category score, weighted internally.
*   **Contextual Input Layer:** The system receives the same context items as the patent (source, user ID, page context etc.), *plus* real-time data streams (social media trends, news events, weather, stock market fluctuations).
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** A RL agent observes context items and user interactions (clicks, purchases, dwell time). It adjusts ecosystem weights to maximize a reward function (e.g., purchase rate, revenue per user, long-term engagement). The reward function is customizable.
*   **Recommendation Blending:** For each user/product, the system generates candidate recommendations from *all* datasets. These are scored individually, then combined using the dynamically weighted ecosystem profile. (e.g. 70% Purchase History, 10% Trending Now, 20% Social Influence).
*   **A/B Testing & Exploration:** The RL agent continuously explores different ecosystem configurations through A/B testing, identifying optimal weightings for different user segments and contexts.
*   **Data Drift Detection:** The system monitors data drift within each dataset and adjusts weights accordingly. Declining data quality triggers decreased weighting.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: User Context (user_id, page_id, context_items)

// Get Ecosystem Weights from RL Agent
ecosystem_weights = get_ecosystem_weights(user_id, context_items)

// For each Dataset Category:
//   Get Sub-Dataset Scores (based on user & context)
//   Calculate Category Score = weighted sum of Sub-Dataset Scores

// Calculate Overall Recommendation Score = weighted sum of Category Scores (using ecosystem_weights)

// Generate Ranked Recommendations based on Overall Score

// Log User Interaction (click, purchase, etc.)

// Update RL Agent (reward = user_interaction_value)
```

**Innovation:** This moves beyond *selecting* a dataset to *orchestrating* a dynamic blend of influences. It introduces a self-learning ecosystem that adapts to user behavior, external events, and data quality, providing more nuanced and relevant recommendations. It’s a more sophisticated approach than simply choosing the "best" dataset. This aims for a constantly evolving "recommendation personality" for each user.
