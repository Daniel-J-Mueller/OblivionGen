**Dynamic Panel Stitching & Contextual Expansion**

**Concept:** Expand the concept of automated panel detection and arrangement into a dynamic system that *stitches* panels together from multiple pages, creating larger, more immersive views, and intelligently filling gaps with contextual AI-generated content. This moves beyond simple navigation *within* a page to navigation *across* multiple pages, effectively rematerializing the comic in a new format.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Page Analysis Module:** 
    *   Input: Digital comic data (multiple pages).
    *   Process: Analyzes panel layouts *across* consecutive pages, identifying potential continuations of scenes or action sequences.  Uses confidence scoring (similar to existing patent) but weighted to prioritize cross-page continuations.
    *   Output:  A graph representation of panel relationships across pages.  Nodes = panels, edges = continuation confidence.

2.  **Stitching Engine:**
    *   Input: Panel relationship graph. User-defined ‘zoom’ level (defines how many pages are considered for stitching – e.g., zoom=2 considers current page + next page).
    *   Process:  Based on the graph and zoom level, selects panels from multiple pages to form a larger stitched view.  Prioritizes high-confidence continuations, but allows user override.
    *   Output: A combined image representing the stitched view.

3.  **Contextual Gap Filling Module:**
    *   Input: Stitched image. Identified gaps between panels (due to stitching from separate pages).
    *   Process:  Uses a generative AI model (image diffusion, GAN, etc.) trained on comic art styles.  Analyzes surrounding panel content, scene context (determined by keyword analysis of dialogue and captions), and character positioning to generate content to fill the gaps.  User-adjustable style/fidelity settings.
    *   Output: Filled gaps seamlessly integrated into the stitched image.

4.  **Dynamic Navigation System:**
    *   Input: Stitched image. Panel layout information.
    *   Process: Generates a dynamic navigation system that allows users to pan and zoom across the stitched view seamlessly.  Includes ‘hotspots’ that transition to the next stitched view (created by iterating the process across the entire comic).
    *   Output: Interactive stitched view with dynamic navigation.

**Pseudocode (Navigation System - simplified):**

```
function generate_navigation(stitched_image, panel_data):
  // panel_data contains bounding box coordinates for each panel in the stitched image

  for each panel in panel_data:
    // Create clickable hotspot over panel

    on_click(hotspot):
      // Determine next stitched view (based on panel's position and page context)
      next_view = get_next_view(panel, page_context)

      // Load next_view and display it
      display(next_view)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU for generative AI processing.
*   Large RAM capacity for handling multi-page image data.
*   Cloud-based storage for comic data and generated content.
*   AI model training dataset of comic art styles.
*   Cross-platform compatibility (web, mobile, desktop).
