## Dynamic Data Layering with Predictive Rendering

**Concept:** Extend independent density control to *predictively* load and render data layers based on user movement and anticipated areas of interest, going beyond simple on-demand loading.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Layer Definition:** Define map data not as monolithic tiles, but as distinct, named layers (e.g., "Roads – High Detail", "Buildings – Minimal", "Points of Interest – All"). Each layer has associated rendering styles (as in the patent) and a *priority score*.
*   **Predictive Movement Analysis:** Utilize sensor data (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope) to predict user trajectory. This is not merely tracking current location, but extrapolating *where the user is likely to be* in the next few seconds.
*   **Dynamic Layer Prioritization:**  Combine predictive movement with layer priority scores and a *buffer radius*. The system maintains a dynamically updating list of layers to render based on:
    *   Layers covering areas within the buffer radius of the predicted trajectory.
    *   Layer priority score (higher score = higher rendering priority).
    *   Available bandwidth/processing power (throttling lower-priority layers if necessary).
*   **Multi-Resolution Layer Streaming:** Layers are streamed in multiple resolutions.  Lower resolutions are loaded initially, with higher resolutions loaded *predictively* as the user approaches an area.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:**  The rendering pipeline must be capable of dynamically blending multiple layers with different resolutions and rendering styles. Prioritize layers during rendering based on their calculated priority.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to customize layer priority scores and define their preferred data layer sets (e.g., "Navigation Mode" = roads + POIs, "Exploration Mode" = terrain + buildings + landmarks).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
//Data Structures
Layer:
    Name: String
    Priority: Integer
    ResolutionLevels: [Image]

UserPreferences:
    PreferredLayerSets: {SetName: [Layer]}

//Main Loop
For each frame:
    1. Get user location and predicted trajectory
    2. Calculate buffer area around trajectory
    3. Identify layers intersecting buffer area
    4. Score each intersecting layer based on priority and distance to trajectory
    5. Select top N layers to render (based on available resources)
    6. For each selected layer:
        a. Load/Stream appropriate resolution image data
        b. Render layer with defined style
    7. Composite rendered layers and display
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **AR Navigation:** Seamlessly blend map data with the real world, intelligently loading details as the user moves through a city.
*   **Geospatial Gaming:** Dynamically load game assets (buildings, terrain) based on player movement and anticipated areas of interest.
*   **Emergency Response:** Provide responders with real-time situational awareness, intelligently displaying critical data layers (e.g., fire hydrants, hospitals) based on their location and projected path.
*   **Scientific Visualization:** Render complex datasets (e.g., weather patterns, geological formations) with varying levels of detail based on user interaction and exploration.
