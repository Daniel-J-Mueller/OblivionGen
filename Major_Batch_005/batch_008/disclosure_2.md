## Spatial Audio Beaconing for Targeted Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Expand the microphone array analysis beyond device *selection* to actively create a spatially aware haptic feedback system. Instead of just choosing *which* device responds, pinpoint a user’s location within a space and deliver localized haptic cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microphone Array: Existing device microphones (phones, smart speakers, etc.) function as the base array. Minimum 3 microphones for rudimentary triangulation, ideally 6+ for higher accuracy.
    *   Haptic Actuator Network: A distributed network of low-power haptic actuators (vibrating motors, piezoelectric elements, etc.) embedded in environmental surfaces (tables, chairs, walls, wearable textiles). Density is variable depending on desired granularity of haptic feedback.
    *   Edge Processing Units: Low-power processors connected to each microphone and clusters of haptic actuators to perform real-time audio processing and haptic control.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Phase Difference of Arrival (PDoA) Calculation:** Each Edge Processing Unit calculates the PDoA between received audio signals and known microphone positions.
    *   **Triangulation & Localization:**  A central server (or distributed network of servers) uses PDoA data from all Edge Processing Units to estimate the 3D position of the sound source (e.g., user’s voice or other relevant sounds). Kalman filtering or other state estimation techniques are used to smooth and refine the position estimate.
    *   **Haptic Mapping Function:** A configurable function maps the estimated 3D position to activation patterns for the haptic actuator network. This allows for the creation of various haptic effects:
        *   **Proximity Cueing:**  Actuators near the estimated position vibrate, creating a localized “hotspot” to guide the user.
        *   **Directional Guidance:**  A trail of actuators vibrates, indicating the direction to a target object or location.
        *   **Object Highlighting:** Actuators embedded in or near a target object vibrate, drawing the user's attention.
    *   **Adaptive Calibration:** A self-calibration routine that automatically adjusts the PDoA calculations and haptic mapping function to account for changes in the environment (e.g., furniture rearrangement, acoustic reflections).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Microphone Array Processing (on each Edge Processing Unit)
function processAudio(audioData) {
  timestamp = getCurrentTimestamp()
  phaseDifference = calculatePhaseDifference(audioData)
  sendToCentralServer(timestamp, phaseDifference)
}

// Central Server Processing
function estimatePosition(microphoneDataList) {
  // Filter and process microphone data
  // Apply triangulation algorithms (e.g., least squares)
  position = calculate3DPosition(microphoneDataList)
  return position
}

function generateHapticPattern(position) {
  // Map position to actuator activation pattern
  // Consider distance, direction, and desired effect
  pattern = createActuatorPattern(position)
  return pattern
}

function activateHapticActuators(pattern) {
  // Send activation signals to haptic actuators
  // Control vibration intensity and duration
  for each actuator in pattern {
    setActuatorState(actuator, pattern[actuator])
  }
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  microphoneData = receiveDataFromMicrophones()
  position = estimatePosition(microphoneData)
  hapticPattern = generateHapticPattern(position)
  activateHapticActuators(hapticPattern)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Accessibility: Guiding visually impaired individuals through spaces.
*   Gaming/VR: Immersive haptic feedback for enhanced gameplay.
*   Retail: Guiding customers to products in a store.
*   Industrial: Providing tactile feedback for assembly or maintenance tasks.
