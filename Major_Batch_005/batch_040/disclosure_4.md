## Dynamic Contact Prioritization via Biometric & Environmental Data

**Concept:** Extend contact prioritization beyond simple rules (day of week, cancellation history) by incorporating real-time biometric data from the user and environmental data to dynamically adjust contact selection. This moves from *predictive* prioritization to *reactive* prioritization – responding to the user’s current state.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Biometric Sensors:** Integration with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness trackers) to capture:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – Indicator of stress/calm.
    *   Skin Conductance (Galvanic Skin Response - GSR) – Measures emotional arousal.
    *   Voice Analysis (from microphone) – Detects stress, fatigue, or emotional state.
    *   Eye Tracking (optional, via compatible device) – Focus, alertness.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Access to:
    *   Location Data (GPS) – Context of where the user is (home, work, commute).
    *   Ambient Noise Levels (microphone).
    *   Calendar Data – Upcoming appointments, meetings.
    *   Device Motion Data (accelerometer, gyroscope) – Activity level (walking, driving, stationary).
*   **Data Privacy:** All data collection requires explicit user consent. Data is anonymized and encrypted. User controls data retention policies.

**2. Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Weighted Scoring System:** Each data point (HRV, GSR, location, calendar event, noise level) is assigned a weight based on its relevance to communication preferences. Weights are user-configurable.
*   **State Classification:**  The engine classifies the user's current state into categories:
    *   "Focused/Available" - Low stress, calm, stationary or engaged in focused activity.
    *   "Stressed/Busy" - High stress, elevated heart rate, in transit, or during a meeting.
    *   "Relaxed/Receptive" - Low stress, calm, during leisure time.
    *   "Distracted/Unavailable" - Elevated stress, high noise levels, active movement.
*   **Dynamic Contact List Adjustment:** Based on the classified state:
    *   **Focused/Available:** Prioritize contacts requiring detailed discussion or problem-solving.
    *   **Stressed/Busy:** Route calls to voicemail or a designated assistant. Initiate text-based communication.
    *   **Relaxed/Receptive:** Allow calls from preferred contacts. Suggest initiating video calls.
    *   **Distracted/Unavailable:** Mute notifications. Provide automated responses.
*   **Multi-Factor Prioritization:** Combine biometric/environmental data with existing rules (day of week, cancellation history) to create a comprehensive prioritization model.
*   **AI-Powered Learning:** Utilize machine learning to continuously refine the weighting system and state classification based on user behavior and feedback.

**3. Communication Manager:**

*   **Intelligent Routing:** Route incoming communications (calls, messages, video calls) to the appropriate contact based on the dynamic prioritization model.
*   **Communication Mode Selection:** Select the optimal communication mode (call, text, video) based on the user’s state and the context of the communication.
*   **Automated Responses:** Generate automated responses to incoming communications when the user is unavailable or in a state where communication is not appropriate.
*   **Notification Management:** Adjust notification frequency and priority based on the user’s state and the urgency of the communication.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Acquisition
biometricData = getBiometricData()
environmentalData = getEnvironmentalData()

// State Classification
userState = classifyUserState(biometricData, environmentalData)

// Prioritization
contactList = getContactList()
prioritizedContactList = prioritizeContacts(contactList, userState)

// Communication Routing
incomingCommunication = receiveIncomingCommunication()
selectedContact = selectContact(incomingCommunication, prioritizedContactList)

// Communication Mode Selection
communicationMode = selectCommunicationMode(selectedContact, userState)

// Initiate Communication
initiateCommunication(selectedContact, communicationMode)
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond *predictive* contact selection to *reactive* contact selection based on real-time user state. Integrates biometric and environmental data for a more nuanced understanding of user availability and communication preferences. This provides a more human-centered communication experience.
