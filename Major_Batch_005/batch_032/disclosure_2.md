## Dynamic Event Rescheduling & Value Adjustment System

**Concept:** Expand the core idea of identifying potential purchasers beyond simply reselling excess tickets. Develop a system that proactively *reschedules* events based on predicted demand and adjusts ticket pricing dynamically, creating entirely new event experiences and maximizing revenue.

**System Specs:**

**1. Predictive Demand Engine:**

*   **Input Data:**
    *   Historical ticket sales data (internal).
    *   Social media sentiment analysis (external API integration - Twitter, Facebook, etc.).
    *   Local event calendars (API integration).
    *   Weather forecasts (API integration).
    *   Real-time transportation data (API integration â€“ traffic, public transport delays).
    *   Search query trends (Google Trends API).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Machine learning model (time series forecasting, regression) to predict attendance rates for upcoming events.
    *   Sentiment analysis to gauge public interest/disinterest.
    *   Correlation analysis to identify factors influencing attendance (weather, competing events, etc.).
*   **Output:** Predicted attendance rate, confidence interval, key influencing factors.

**2. Dynamic Rescheduling Module:**

*   **Trigger:** If predicted attendance falls below a predefined threshold (adjustable parameter) *and* a rescheduling window is open (defined by event organizer).
*   **Process:**
    *   Identifies potential alternative dates/times within the rescheduling window.
    *   Uses the Predictive Demand Engine to forecast attendance for each alternative date/time.
    *   Considers logistical constraints (venue availability, artist schedules, etc.).
    *   Prioritizes rescheduling options based on maximizing predicted attendance.
*   **Output:** Recommended reschedule date/time, estimated impact on attendance.

**3. Dynamic Pricing Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Predicted attendance (from Predictive Demand Engine).
    *   Remaining ticket inventory.
    *   Real-time demand signals (website traffic, ticket purchase rates).
    *   Competitor pricing (web scraping or API integration).
*   **Process:**
    *   Algorithmic pricing model (e.g., reinforcement learning) to dynamically adjust ticket prices.
    *   Price elasticity calculations to optimize revenue.
    *   Segmentation of ticket prices based on seat location, time of purchase, and user profile.
*   **Output:** Optimal ticket prices for each seat and time window.

**4. Automated Communication System:**

*   **Triggers:**
    *   Event rescheduling.
    *   Significant price changes.
    *   Low ticket inventory.
*   **Channels:**
    *   Email.
    *   SMS.
    *   Push notifications (mobile app).
    *   Social media (targeted ads).
*   **Personalization:** Tailor messages based on user preferences, past purchases, and location.

**5. User Interface (Mobile App/Web Portal):**

*   **Event Discovery:** Personalized event recommendations based on user preferences.
*   **Dynamic Ticket Marketplace:** Real-time ticket pricing and availability.
*   **Rescheduling Notifications:** Automatic updates on event changes.
*   **Interactive Seating Map:** Visualize seat locations and prices.
*   **Social Sharing:** Allow users to share event information with friends.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Rescheduling):**

```
FUNCTION rescheduleEvent(eventID)
  predictedAttendance = getPredictedAttendance(eventID)
  IF predictedAttendance < thresholdAttendance THEN
    rescheduleWindow = getRescheduleWindow(eventID)
    bestDate = NULL
    maxAttendance = 0
    FOR each date in rescheduleWindow
      newAttendance = getPredictedAttendance(eventID, date)
      IF newAttendance > maxAttendance THEN
        maxAttendance = newAttendance
        bestDate = date
      ENDIF
    ENDFOR
    IF bestDate != NULL THEN
      confirmReschedule(eventID, bestDate)
      sendNotifications(eventID, bestDate)
    ENDIF
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simply reselling excess tickets to actively managing event demand and maximizing revenue through proactive rescheduling and dynamic pricing. It leverages predictive analytics and automated communication to create a more flexible and responsive event experience. The system isn't designed to solve a problem so much as it attempts to create new event paradigms.
