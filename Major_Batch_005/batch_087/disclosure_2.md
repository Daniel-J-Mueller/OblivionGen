## Dynamic Reputation Scoring for Network Addresses

**Concept:** Expand the core validation concept to create a dynamic reputation scoring system for IP address ranges, factoring in real-time and historical data from diverse sources. This isn’t just *if* an IP address is used as intended, but *how reliably* it adheres to expected behavior.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Sources:**
    *   DNS Records: Basic validation, historical changes.
    *   WHOIS Data: Ownership, registration details, abuse contact.
    *   BGP Routing Information: Path validity, AS ownership.
    *   Traffic Analysis (NetFlow/sFlow): Observed traffic patterns – protocols, destinations, volumes.
    *   Reputation Blacklists/Whitelists: Integration of external threat intelligence.
    *   Honeypot Activity: Signals of malicious probing or exploitation.
    *   SSL/TLS Certificate Information: Certificate validity, issuer, subject.

2.  **Scoring Algorithm:**
    *   Each data source contributes a weighted score (adjustable via configuration).
    *   Scores decay over time (recent data more influential).
    *   Positive indicators (e.g., valid SSL certificate, consistent routing) increase the score.
    *   Negative indicators (e.g., blacklist listing, suspicious traffic) decrease the score.
    *   Scoring thresholds define reputation levels (Trusted, Neutral, Suspicious, Untrusted).

3.  **System Architecture:**
    *   *Ingestion Layer:* Collects data from diverse sources. Asynchronous, scalable pipeline (Kafka/RabbitMQ).
    *   *Processing Layer:* Normalizes, validates, and enriches data. Implements the scoring algorithm. (Spark/Flink).
    *   *Storage Layer:* Stores reputation scores and historical data. (Cassandra/InfluxDB).
    *   *API Layer:* Provides access to reputation scores via REST API. Authentication/Authorization.

4.  **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/reputation/{ip_address}`: Returns the reputation score and details for a single IP address.
    *   `/reputation/range/{ip_prefix}`: Returns the aggregated reputation score for an IP address range.
    *   `/history/{ip_address}`: Returns the historical reputation score for an IP address (time-series data).

5. **Pseudocode (Score Calculation):**

```
function calculate_reputation_score(ip_address):
  score = 0
  
  dns_score = get_dns_score(ip_address)
  whois_score = get_whois_score(ip_address)
  bgp_score = get_bgp_score(ip_address)
  traffic_score = get_traffic_score(ip_address)
  blacklist_score = get_blacklist_score(ip_address)
  
  score += (dns_score * WEIGHT_DNS)
  score += (whois_score * WEIGHT_WHOIS)
  score += (bgp_score * WEIGHT_BGP)
  score += (traffic_score * WEIGHT_TRAFFIC)
  score += (blacklist_score * WEIGHT_BLACKLIST)
  
  # Apply Decay (e.g., exponential decay)
  score = score * DECAY_FACTOR^(current_time - last_updated_time)
  
  return score
```

6.  **Integration Points:**
    *   Firewalls: Dynamically adjust firewall rules based on IP reputation.
    *   Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): Enhance threat detection.
    *   Load Balancers: Route traffic away from compromised or unreliable IPs.
    *   Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems: Enrich security alerts.
