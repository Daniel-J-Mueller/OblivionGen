## Dynamic Content Re-Flow with Semantic Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the style detection and re-formatting to not just paragraphs, but to *semantic units* within the image. Instead of simply adjusting paragraph styles based on detected attributes and display dimensions, identify logical content blocks (e.g., headings, lists, tables, figures with captions) and reflow those blocks *independently* while maintaining their relationships. The key is "semantic anchoring" â€“ preserving the visual and logical connections between these blocks as the content is refitted for different displays.

**Specs:**

1.  **Semantic Segmentation Module:**
    *   Input: Image of content.
    *   Output:  A layered representation of the image, where each layer identifies a semantic unit (heading, paragraph, list item, table, image, etc.). Each unit is tagged with a confidence score.  This leverages existing or custom object detection/segmentation models.
    *   Technology: Deep learning (CNNs, Transformers) for object detection/semantic segmentation.

2.  **Relationship Graph Builder:**
    *   Input: Layered representation from the Semantic Segmentation Module.
    *   Output: A directed graph where nodes represent semantic units, and edges represent spatial and logical relationships (e.g., "heading precedes paragraph", "image is captioned by paragraph", "list item follows list item").
    *   Algorithm:
        *   Analyze spatial proximity and overlap of bounding boxes.
        *   Apply rules based on common layout patterns (e.g., headings typically above paragraphs, captions below images).
        *   OCR text content to identify keywords indicating relationships (e.g., "Figure 1", "See also").

3.  **Dynamic Reflow Engine:**
    *   Input: Relationship Graph, Target Display Dimensions.
    *   Output: Modified image with reflowed content.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   Determine optimal arrangement of semantic units based on target display dimensions and Relationship Graph.
        *   Prioritize maintaining visual groupings from the original image.
        *   Use a cost function that balances visual fidelity, content density, and readability.
        *   Employ a constraint solver to find a feasible arrangement that satisfies the cost function and constraints.
        *   Apply style adjustments (font size, line spacing, margins) to individual semantic units to optimize readability.

4.  **Style Inheritance & Override System:**
    *   Semantic units inherit style attributes from their parent or related units (e.g., a list item inherits font from the list).
    *   Individual semantic units can override inherited styles based on their content or function (e.g., a heading uses a larger font size).

5.  **Adaptive Image Handling:**
    *   Images are treated as semantic units.
    *   The system can resize, crop, or reposition images to fit the display dimensions and maintain visual coherence.
    *   Image captions are automatically repositioned to remain associated with the image.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function reflow_image(image, target_width, target_height):
    semantic_layers = segment_image(image)
    relationship_graph = build_relationship_graph(semantic_layers)
    reflowed_layers = optimize_layout(semantic_layers, relationship_graph, target_width, target_height)
    return compose_image(reflowed_layers)
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Content-Aware Reflow:**  Prioritize important content based on text analysis (e.g., emphasize key phrases or concepts).
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to specify preferences for layout and style.
*   **Interactive Reflow:**  Enable users to manually adjust the layout and fine-tune the reflow process.
*   **Real-time Reflow:**  Apply the reflow process in real-time as the user interacts with the content.
