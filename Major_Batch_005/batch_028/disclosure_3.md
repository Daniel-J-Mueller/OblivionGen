## Dynamic Federated Token Lifespan & Reputation System

**Concept:** Extend the federated token approach with a dynamic lifespan and reputation system tied to resource usage and security posture. This moves beyond simple temporary credentials and introduces a micro-economic/trust element within the provider network.

**Specification:**

**1. Token Generation & Initial Lifespan:**

*   The burst service manager (BSM) generates the initial secret key value (SKV) as described in the patent.
*   Alongside the SKV (or location identifier), the BSM assigns an initial *trust score* (TS) to the requesting cluster. This TS is based on factors like uptime, adherence to security policies, and historical resource consumption.
*   The BSM calculates an initial *token lifespan* (TL) based on the TS. Higher TS = longer TL.  (Example: TL = BaseLifespan * (1 + TS)).  BaseLifespan is a configurable parameter.
*   The federated token includes not just a credential, but also the TL and the TS.

**2. Resource Usage & Lifespan Reduction:**

*   Each time the token is used to access a resource (database query, API call, etc.), the accessed service *reduces* the remaining TL proportionally to the resource's “cost”.  Higher cost resources = faster TL reduction.
*   The TL reduction is logged by the service.
*   A 'cost' matrix is maintained by the provider, assigning resource costs. This can be dynamic.

**3. Security Posture Monitoring & Trust Score Updates:**

*   A security monitoring service continuously assesses the requesting cluster’s security posture (vulnerability scans, intrusion detection, etc.).
*   Based on the posture, the TS is dynamically adjusted. Improved posture = TS increase.  Detected vulnerabilities/incidents = TS decrease.
*   The TS update propagates back to the BSM and any services currently validating the token.

**4. Token Renewal Mechanism:**

*   Before the TL expires, the requesting cluster can request a renewal.
*   The BSM re-evaluates the TS based on current posture and resource usage history.
*   A new TL is calculated and issued, or the renewal request is denied if the TS is too low.

**5. Reputation System & Prioritization:**

*   Clusters with consistently high TS and responsible resource usage gain a higher “reputation score”.
*   Higher reputation clusters receive preferential treatment:
    *   Longer initial TLs.
    *   Faster renewal approvals.
    *   Priority access to resources during peak demand.

**Pseudocode (Token Validation):**

```
function validateToken(token, resourceCost) {
  // Extract TL, TS from token
  tl = token.tokenLifespan
  ts = token.trustScore

  // Calculate remaining lifespan
  remainingLifespan = tl - resourceCost

  //Check expiration.
  if (remainingLifespan <= 0) {
    return false;
  }
  //Update remaining lifespan
  token.tokenLifespan = remainingLifespan;

  //Fetch current TS from the security monitoring service
  currentTs = getTrustScore(token.clusterId);

  //Update token's TS
  token.trustScore = currentTs;

  return true;
}
```

**System Components:**

*   **Trust Score Service:**  Aggregates security data and calculates the TS.
*   **Resource Cost Matrix:** Configurable matrix defining the “cost” of each resource.
*   **Token Renewal API:**  Allows clusters to request token renewals.
*   **Modified Burst Service Manager:** Incorporates the trust score and resource cost logic.
