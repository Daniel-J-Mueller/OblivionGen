## Modular Payload & Power Distribution System with Bio-Integrated Cooling

**Concept:** Expand the payload capacity and thermal management of the UAV by incorporating a modular, bio-integrated cooling system alongside a distributed power architecture.

**Specs:**

*   **Modular Payload Bays:** Replace the single 'removably positioned' payload area with a series of smaller, standardized payload bays. These bays would connect to a central bus/interface within the fuselage, enabling hot-swapping and scaling of payload capacity. Bay sizes: Small (100g), Medium (500g), Large (1kg). Standardized interface: 6-pin connector (power, ground, data x3).

*   **Distributed Power System:** Shift from centralized power to a distributed network. Each power supply container houses multiple smaller, independent power modules instead of a single large unit. Each module provides power to specific payload bays and UAV systems. Power modules communicate via a CAN bus for load balancing and fault tolerance. Voltage: 12-24V DC. Max current per module: 20A.

*   **Bio-Integrated Cooling System:** Incorporate a network of microfluidic channels within the frame and payload bays. These channels circulate a biocompatible coolant (e.g., water-glycol mixture with antimicrobial additives). The coolant is circulated by micro-pumps powered by the distributed power system. 

    *   **Coolant Source:** A small, self-contained reservoir within each power supply container.
    *   **Heat Exchangers:** Integrate miniature heat exchangers (micro-fin or pin-fin) into the frame structure, utilizing airflow over the UAV to dissipate heat.
    *   **Bio-Integration:** Explore incorporating a bio-engineered layer of heat-generating algae within the coolant. Algae would generate a small amount of electricity from sunlight (supplementing the battery) while simultaneously absorbing heat. This creates a self-regulating thermal system. (Requires careful containment and biocompatibility considerations).

*   **Thermal Management Software:** Develop software to monitor and control the coolant flow rate, pump speed, and algae activity (if implemented). The software would prioritize cooling based on payload requirements and UAV system temperatures. Utilize sensor data from each payload bay and key components.

**Pseudocode (Thermal Management Software):**

```
// Define temperature thresholds
TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH = 80°C
TEMP_THRESHOLD_MED = 60°C

// Define pump speed levels
PUMP_SPEED_LOW = 20%
PUMP_SPEED_MED = 50%
PUMP_SPEED_HIGH = 100%

// Main loop
while (true) {
  // Read temperature data from each payload bay and key component
  temperature_data = get_temperature_data();

  // Check for overheating
  for each (payload_bay in temperature_data) {
    if (payload_bay.temperature > TEMP_THRESHOLD_HIGH) {
      // Increase pump speed to maximum
      set_pump_speed(payload_bay.pump, PUMP_SPEED_HIGH);

      // Alert operator
      send_alert("Payload bay overheating!");
    } else if (payload_bay.temperature > TEMP_THRESHOLD_MED) {
      // Increase pump speed to medium
      set_pump_speed(payload_bay.pump, PUMP_SPEED_MED);
    } else {
      // Set pump speed to low or off
      set_pump_speed(payload_bay.pump, PUMP_SPEED_LOW);
    }
  }

  // Monitor algae activity (if implemented)
  if (algae_enabled) {
    // Adjust algae growth rate based on temperature and sunlight levels
    adjust_algae_growth_rate();
  }

  // Wait for a short period before repeating the loop
  delay(100ms);
}
```
