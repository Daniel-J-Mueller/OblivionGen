## Modular Acoustic Skins

**Concept:** Wireless speaker with interchangeable, magnetically-attached "acoustic skins" that radically alter both the speaker's aesthetic *and* its acoustic properties.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Speaker Unit:** Cylindrical base unit (15cm diameter, 20cm height). Contains all electronics: amplifier, Bluetooth receiver, battery, digital signal processor (DSP). Finish: Matte black anodized aluminum.
*   **Acoustic Skins:**
    *   Material: Varying densities and compositions of recycled plastics, wood composites, textiles, and even aerogel. 
    *   Attachment: Strong neodymium magnets embedded within both the skin and the core unit.  360-degree alignment guides (small physical ridges/notches) ensure correct positioning.
    *   Skin Profiles (Examples - potentially limitless):
        *   **“Focus” Skin:** Dense, rigid wood composite. Reduces diffusion, concentrates sound in a narrow beam – ideal for directional listening or minimizing noise bleed.
        *   **“Ambiance” Skin:**  Woven textile with variable density sections. Creates a diffuse, room-filling sound. Includes embedded RGB LEDs controllable via app.
        *   **“Bass Boost” Skin:**  Large volume, low-density recycled plastic with internal resonant chambers.  Designed to enhance low-frequency reproduction.
        *   **“Absorption” Skin:**  Aerogel composite covered in acoustic fabric. Minimizes reflections, creating a ‘dead’ listening space (useful for recording or critical listening).
        *   **“Sculptural” Skin:** Complex geometric shapes molded from recycled plastic – purely aesthetic, but could introduce minor diffraction effects.
*   **Skin Detection:**  Core unit utilizes RFID or NFC to identify the attached skin. 
*   **DSP Profiles:** Core unit dynamically adjusts DSP parameters (EQ, crossover, etc.) based on the detected skin, optimizing sound for that profile.  User-customizable profiles via app.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging via Qi standard, integrated into the base unit.
*   **App Integration:**
    *   Skin Profile Selection
    *   Custom EQ settings per skin
    *   LED control (Ambiance Skin)
    *   Skin Purchase/Download platform (allowing designers to create and sell new skin profiles/3D models).

**Pseudocode (DSP Adjustment):**

```
function applySkinProfile(skinID):
  switch skinID:
    case "Focus":
      EQ = [ -3dB @ 100Hz, 0dB @ 1kHz, +2dB @ 5kHz ] // Sharpened EQ
      crossover = [ 200Hz, 2kHz ]
    case "Ambiance":
      EQ = [ 0dB @ all frequencies ] // Flat EQ
      crossover = [ 300Hz, 3kHz ]
      LED_enable = True
    case "Bass Boost":
      EQ = [ +4dB @ 60Hz, 0dB @ 1kHz, -2dB @ 5kHz ] // Boost bass, cut highs
      crossover = [ 150Hz, 2.5kHz ]
    case "Absorption":
      EQ = [ -1dB @ all frequencies ] // Gentle attenuation
      crossover = [ 300Hz, 3kHz ]
    default:
      // Use default settings
      EQ = [ 0dB @ all frequencies ]
      crossover = [ 200Hz, 2kHz ]
  end switch
end function
