## Haptic Gesture Mapping via Bone Conduction

**Concept:** Extend gesture recognition beyond accelerometer data by incorporating bone conduction audio feedback to *create* distinct haptic sensations correlated to specific gestures. This creates a multi-modal feedback system improving precision and accessibility.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware:**

*   **Bone Conduction Transducer:** Miniature bone conduction transducer integrated into device housing (wristband, ring, earbud, etc.). Must be capable of producing nuanced vibrations across a range of frequencies.
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power microcontroller to process accelerometer data, manage bone conduction transducer output, and handle communication.
*   **Accelerometer:** Existing accelerometer as detailed in the original patent.
*   **Power Source:** Rechargeable battery or energy harvesting module.

**2. Software/Algorithm:**

*   **Gesture Database:** Expanded gesture database including both accelerometer-detected gestures *and* associated bone conduction patterns.
*   **Accelerometer Data Processing:**  Identical processing pipeline as the original patent to identify potential gestures.
*   **Haptic Mapping Module:** Core of the innovation. This module maps each detected gesture to a unique bone conduction pattern.
    *   **Pattern Generation:** Bone conduction patterns will *not* be simple vibrations. Utilize short bursts of varying frequencies and amplitudes, creating the illusion of directional ‘taps’ or textures against the bone.
    *   **Directional Audio:** The transducer will attempt to simulate directional sensations by subtly altering amplitude and frequency across its surface.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Algorithm capable of learning user preferences and adjusting bone conduction patterns for optimal recognition and comfort.
*   **Multi-Modal Confirmation:**  The system can request confirmation of detected gestures via a visual or auditory cue.

**3. Pseudocode (Gesture Recognition & Haptic Feedback):**

```
// Initialization
loadGestureDatabase()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  accelerometerData = readAccelerometerData()
  motionDetected = analyzeMotion(accelerometerData)

  if (motionDetected) {
    gesture = detectGesture(accelerometerData) //Uses existing NN model

    if (gesture != NULL) {
      hapticPattern = getHapticPattern(gesture)
      playHapticPattern(hapticPattern)

      //Adaptive Learning
      userFeedback = getUserFeedback()
      if (userFeedback == INCORRECT) {
        updateHapticPattern(gesture, newHapticPattern)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**4. Operational Modes:**

*   **Haptic-Only Mode:** System provides *only* haptic feedback. Useful for users with visual impairments or in situations where visual or auditory cues are undesirable.
*   **Multi-Modal Mode:** System combines haptic feedback with visual or auditory cues for enhanced clarity.
*   **Training Mode:** User can customize haptic patterns for each gesture, creating a personalized experience.

**5.  Potential Applications:**

*   **Assistive Technology:** Enabling users with disabilities to interact with devices more easily.
*   **Gaming:**  Creating more immersive and tactile gaming experiences.
*   **Virtual/Augmented Reality:**  Providing more realistic and engaging haptic feedback in VR/AR environments.
*   **Silent Communication:**  Allowing users to communicate discreetly via haptic gestures.
