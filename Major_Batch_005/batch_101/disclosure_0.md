## Dynamic Page Component Orchestration

**Specification:** A system enabling customers to compose network pages from pre-built, server-side components, delivered as a streaming, executable graph.

**Core Concept:** Rather than supplying complete page generation code (like JSP or servlets), customers define a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of ‘component nodes’. Each node represents a pre-built server-side component offering a specific function (e.g., product listing, promotional banner, customer review display).  The system executes this graph on demand to generate the page.

**Components:**

*   **Component Repository:** A central store of pre-built, secure server-side components. These components have defined inputs, outputs, and resource usage profiles.  Security is paramount – components are vetted and sandboxed.
*   **Graph Definition Language (GDL):** A declarative language for defining the DAG. GDL specifies the component nodes, their connections (data flow), and any configuration parameters.  Example:

    ```gdL
    page MyProductPage {
      node ProductDetails (product_id: request.params.id) -> details;
      node CategoryListing (category: details.category) -> category_products;
      node PromotionalBanner (position: "sidebar") -> banner;
      node CustomerReviews (product_id: request.params.id) -> reviews;

      output {
        details,
        category_products,
        banner,
        reviews
      }
    }
    ```

*   **Graph Executor:**  A server-side component that receives the GDL definition, validates it, and executes the graph. The executor handles data flow between nodes, resource allocation, and error handling. It dynamically assembles an execution plan based on the graph's dependencies and available resources.
*   **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Provides controlled access to customer data sources. The DAL doesn't expose direct database connections; instead, it presents a unified API for retrieving data based on predefined queries or schemas. All data access *must* go through the DAL.
*   **Streaming Page Assembler:**  Responsible for assembling the final HTML page from the data generated by the graph execution. It uses server-side rendering to ensure fast initial load times and SEO friendliness.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Customer Design:**  Customer uses a visual editor or GDL to define the page layout and component connections.
2.  **Graph Submission:** The editor translates the design into a GDL definition and submits it to the system.
3.  **Graph Validation:** The system validates the GDL definition against the available components and data schemas.
4.  **Execution Scheduling:** The Graph Executor analyzes the graph and schedules the execution of component nodes.
5.  **Data Retrieval:** Component nodes request data from the DAL.
6.  **Component Execution:** Component nodes execute their logic and generate output data.
7.  **Page Assembly:** The Streaming Page Assembler combines the output data into a complete HTML page.
8.  **Delivery:** The assembled page is delivered to the client.

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Component-Based Architecture:**  Decouples page design from implementation details.
*   **Declarative Page Definition:** Simplifies page creation and maintenance.
*   **Dynamic Execution:** Enables on-demand page generation and personalization.
*   **Enhanced Security:**  Sandboxed components and controlled data access minimize security risks.
*   **Scalability:** The system can dynamically allocate resources to handle peak traffic.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Component Marketplace:** Allow third-party developers to create and share components.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Automatically test different page layouts and component configurations.
*   **Personalization Engine:**  Dynamically adjust page content based on customer data.
*   **AI-Powered Component Recommendation:** Suggest relevant components based on customer needs.
