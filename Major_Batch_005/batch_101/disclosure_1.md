## Dynamic Knowledge Base Merging & Conflict Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the knowledge base system to dynamically merge knowledge bases based on user interaction patterns and proactively resolve conflicts arising from differing information within those bases. This goes beyond simply associating answers with users; it actively *builds* a meta-knowledge base representing consensus and divergence.

**Specs:**

**1. Interaction Pattern Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** User question data, source knowledge base ID, answering user ID, answer content.
*   **Process:** Continuously monitor user interactions.  Identify recurring question topics.  Track which knowledge bases are frequently accessed for specific topics.  Calculate a ‘relevance score’ between topics, knowledge bases, and answering users.  This score reflects how often a user provides helpful answers for a given topic.
*   **Output:**  A ‘Knowledge Base Affinity Map’ – a graph database showing relationships between topics, knowledge bases, and users.  Nodes represent topics/bases/users.  Edges represent affinity scores.

**2. Dynamic Knowledge Base Merging Engine:**

*   **Input:** Knowledge Base Affinity Map, thresholds for merging (configurable – e.g., affinity score > 0.8).
*   **Process:** When affinity scores between two or more knowledge bases for a specific topic exceed a threshold:
    *   Initiate a merging process for that topic.
    *   Create a ‘Composite Knowledge Base’ containing information from both sources.
    *   Flag potential conflicts (divergent answers to the same question).

**3. Conflict Resolution Module:**

*   **Input:** Composite Knowledge Base with flagged conflicts, answering user IDs for conflicting answers, Knowledge Base Affinity Map.
*   **Process:** Employ a tiered conflict resolution strategy:
    *   **Tier 1: User Voting:** Present conflicting answers to a subset of users associated with *both* knowledge bases.  Allow users to vote on the preferred answer.
    *   **Tier 2: AI Consensus Engine:** If voting results are inconclusive, employ an AI engine trained on historical answer data and user feedback.  The AI attempts to synthesize a unified answer or identify the most reliable source.
    *   **Tier 3: Expert Review:** If AI fails, route the conflict to a human expert for review and resolution.
*   **Output:**  A finalized, consolidated answer for the composite knowledge base.  Record the conflict resolution process and the reasoning behind the final answer.

**4. Meta-Knowledge Base:**

*   **Data Structure:** A graph database storing information *about* the knowledge bases themselves.
*   **Nodes:** Knowledge bases, topics, users, conflicts, resolutions.
*   **Edges:** Relationships between nodes (e.g., "Knowledge Base A specializes in Topic X", "User Y resolved Conflict Z").
*   **Purpose:**  Provides insights into the evolution of knowledge, identifies areas of expertise, and supports more intelligent knowledge base management.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Main Loop:
FOR EACH UserQuestion:
    KnowledgeBaseID = DetermineRelevantKnowledgeBase(UserQuestion)
    IF QuestionUnansweredInKnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBaseID, UserQuestion):
        UserIdentifier = DetermineExpertUser(KnowledgeBaseID, UserQuestion)
        SendQuestionToUser(UserIdentifier, UserQuestion)
        Answer = ReceiveAnswerFromUser(UserIdentifier)
        StoreAnswerInKnowledgeBase(KnowledgeBaseID, Answer, UserIdentifier)

//Background Process:
FOR EACH TimeInterval:
    AnalyzeInteractionPatterns()
    IdentifyKnowledgeBaseMergingOpportunities()
    ResolveConflicts()
    UpdateMetaKnowledgeBase()

```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond static knowledge bases and user association. It introduces a *dynamic* system that actively merges, resolves conflicts, and learns from user interactions to create a constantly evolving, more reliable knowledge repository. The Meta-Knowledge Base provides a layer of abstraction that allows for richer insights and improved knowledge management.
