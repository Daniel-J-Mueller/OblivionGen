## Dynamic Request Shaping via Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Expand the throttling system to *proactively* shape request patterns based on predicted user behavior and resource availability, moving beyond reactive limitation.  Instead of simply allowing or denying requests, the system will subtly alter request parameters (e.g., slightly delaying execution, suggesting alternative data representations, or prompting for pre-fetching) to optimize overall system performance and user experience.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection:**
    *   Instrument network service to collect user interaction data: request types, frequency, data volumes, user profiles (if available, respecting privacy), time of day, geographic location (coarsely, if permitted).
    *   Store data in a time-series database optimized for analytical queries.

2.  **Predictive Model Training:**
    *   Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory networks) to train models that predict future request patterns for individual users or user segments.
    *   Models should predict:
        *   Request volume (requests per unit time)
        *   Request type distribution (probability of each request type)
        *   Data volume per request
    *   Retrain models periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) with new data.

3.  **Request Interception and Modification:**
    *   Intercept incoming requests *before* they reach the core network service.
    *   Based on predicted behavior and current system load:
        *   **Request Delay:** Introduce a slight delay (milliseconds to seconds) for requests anticipated to occur during peak load.  Delay should be dynamically adjusted based on predicted congestion.
        *   **Data Representation Adjustment:** If a user frequently requests large datasets, suggest alternative, pre-aggregated or summarized representations.
        *   **Pre-fetching Hints:**  If the model predicts a user is likely to request a specific dataset soon, proactively send a pre-fetch request to cache it.
        *   **Feature Flag Prioritization:** If multiple features are available, the system should prioritize the most efficient ones based on anticipated load and user behavior.

4.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor the impact of dynamic request shaping on system performance (latency, throughput, error rates) and user experience (session duration, conversion rates).
    *   Use this data to refine the predictive models and optimization strategies.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Request Arrival
request = receive_request()
user_id = extract_user_id(request)

// Fetch Prediction
prediction = predict_request_pattern(user_id)
predicted_volume = prediction.volume
predicted_type_distribution = prediction.type_distribution

// Check Load
current_load = get_system_load()

// Apply Shaping
if (current_load > threshold AND predicted_volume > threshold) {
    delay = calculate_delay(predicted_volume, current_load)
    request.delay(delay) // Introduce delay
}

if (request_type == "large_data" AND user_prefers_summarized_data == true){
    request.set_data_representation("summarized")
}

if (predicted_next_request == "dataset_x"){
    prefetch_dataset("dataset_x")
}
// Process Request
process_request(request)
```

5. **Scalability Considerations:** The prediction models should be deployable as microservices to enable horizontal scaling. Utilize caching layers to reduce latency associated with model inference.
