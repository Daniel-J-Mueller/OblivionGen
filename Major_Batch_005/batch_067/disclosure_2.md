## Dynamic Task Allocation & Predictive Swarm Routing

**Concept:** Expand the item acquisition model to encompass *multiple* acquirers (a "swarm") operating concurrently within the distribution center, dynamically allocating tasks and predicting optimal routing not just for individual items, but for the swarm as a whole. Shift from *estimating* acquisition time to *actively managing* acquisition.

**Specs:**

*   **Swarm Agent Software:** Each acquirer (human or robotic) is equipped with a mobile application/integrated system. This agent receives task assignments, reports progress, and transmits real-time location data.
*   **Centralized Swarm Coordinator:** A server-side component responsible for task allocation, route optimization, and swarm-level monitoring. This leverages the machine learning model from the base patent, augmented with swarm dynamics data.
*   **Dynamic Task Assignment Algorithm:** The core of the system.
    *   Input: Customer order, distribution center map, real-time location of all swarm agents, estimated travel/pickup times for each item (from ML model).
    *   Process:
        1.  Initial Decomposition: Break the customer order into individual item acquisition tasks.
        2.  Agent Capacity Assessment: Determine the capacity of each agent (e.g., carrying weight, available time).
        3.  Task Assignment: Assign tasks to agents based on proximity, capacity, and predicted completion time. Prioritize tasks based on customer delivery requirements.
        4.  Conflict Resolution: Detect and resolve task conflicts (e.g., two agents assigned the same item).
        5.  Re-Optimization Loop: Continuously monitor progress and re-optimize task assignments based on real-time data (e.g., agent delays, unexpected obstacles). Use the ML model to refine predictions.
*   **Predictive Swarm Routing:**
    *   Based on the assigned tasks and agent locations, predict the overall swarm movement.
    *   Identify potential bottlenecks or congestion areas within the distribution center.
    *   Proactively adjust task assignments or routes to avoid collisions or delays.
    *   Generate a "swarm heatmap" visualizing agent density and predicted movement patterns.
*   **User Interface Adaptations:**
    *   Display a real-time map of the distribution center showing agent locations, assigned tasks, and predicted routes.
    *   Highlight potential bottlenecks or congestion areas.
    *   Provide a visual representation of the overall swarm progress.
    *   Allow manual intervention (e.g., re-assigning tasks, adjusting routes).
*   **Machine Learning Enhancement:**
    *   Incorporate swarm dynamics data into the ML model.
    *   Train the model to predict the impact of task assignments on overall swarm performance.
    *   Use reinforcement learning to optimize the task assignment algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Task Assignment):**

```
function assignTasks(order, agents, dcMap, mlModel) {
  tasks = decomposeOrder(order)
  for (task in tasks) {
    bestAgent = null
    minEstimatedTime = Infinity

    for (agent in agents) {
      estimatedTime = mlModel.estimateAcquisitionTime(task, agent, dcMap)
      if (estimatedTime < minEstimatedTime && agent.capacity > task.size) {
        minEstimatedTime = estimatedTime
        bestAgent = agent
      }
    }

    if (bestAgent != null) {
      bestAgent.assignTask(task)
      bestAgent.capacity -= task.size
    } else {
      // Handle case where no agent can handle the task
      // (e.g., split the task, wait for an agent to become available)
    }
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  Shifts focus from *predicting* individual acquisition time to *actively managing* a swarm of acquirers, optimizing for overall system efficiency. Leverages the ML model to enable dynamic task allocation and predictive swarm routing, creating a self-organizing acquisition system.
