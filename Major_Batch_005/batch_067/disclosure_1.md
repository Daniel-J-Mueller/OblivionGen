## Adaptive Memory Remapping with Predictive Failure Analysis

**Concept:** Dynamically remapping failing memory sectors *before* data is completely corrupted, based on predictive failure analysis derived from read/write patterns and environmental factors.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Architecture:**

*   **Memory Controller Integration:**  Implementation as a module integrated within the existing memory controller. This allows direct access and control over memory addressing and data flow.
*   **Failure Prediction Engine (FPE):** A dedicated processor or FPGA-based core responsible for analyzing memory access patterns, temperature readings (from on-chip sensors), voltage fluctuations, and write/read cycle counts.
*   **Remapping Table:**  A high-speed, non-volatile memory (e.g., embedded flash) storing the mapping between logical and physical memory addresses. This table is updated dynamically by the FPE.
*   **Data Interception Module (DIM):**  Hardware module positioned between the memory controller and the DRAM. It intercepts all read and write requests, applying the remapping defined in the remapping table.
*   **Background Scan Module (BSM):** Periodically scans memory blocks to confirm the validity of the remapping table and identify newly failing sectors.

**2. Failure Prediction Algorithm (within FPE):**

*   **Statistical Modeling:** Employ a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to model the health state of each memory sector based on read/write error rates, read latency, and write latency.  States could include 'Healthy', 'Warning', 'Failing', 'Failed'.
*   **Temperature & Voltage Correlation:**  Log temperature and voltage fluctuations alongside error rates. Identify correlations between environmental factors and memory failures.
*   **Write Amplification Monitoring:** Track write amplification per sector.  High write amplification often indicates stress and potential failure.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Use machine learning (e.g., autoencoders) to identify anomalous read/write patterns that deviate from the established baseline, potentially indicating early signs of failure.
*   **Predictive Thresholds:**  Define configurable thresholds for each metric.  When a metric crosses a threshold, the FPE initiates remapping.

**3. Data Interception Module (DIM) Operation:**

*   **Address Translation:** Upon receiving a read/write request, the DIM checks the remapping table for the requested logical address.
*   **Physical Address Calculation:** If a remapping entry exists, the DIM translates the logical address to the corresponding physical address.
*   **Data Redirection:** The DIM redirects the data to or from the new physical address.
*   **Cache Coherency Maintenance:**  The DIM coordinates with the system’s cache controller to ensure cache coherency during remapping operations.

**4. Background Scan Module (BSM) Operation:**

*   **Periodic Scans:** Periodically scans memory blocks (configurable frequency).
*   **Data Validation:** Writes test data to the scanned block and reads it back to verify data integrity.
*   **Remapping Table Update:** If the scan detects errors, the BSM updates the remapping table with the new physical address.

**5. Pseudocode (FPE – Core Logic):**

```
// Initialize: Load initial mapping table, establish baseline metrics
function initialize() {
  loadMappingTable();
  establishBaseline();
}

function analyzeAccess(logicalAddress, accessType, errorStatus) {
  sector = getSector(logicalAddress);
  updateSectorMetrics(sector, errorStatus);

  // HMM prediction
  predictedState = hmm.predictState(sector);

  if (predictedState == "Warning" || predictedState == "Failing") {
    // Initiate pre-emptive remapping
    newPhysicalAddress = findReplacementAddress();
    updateMappingTable(logicalAddress, newPhysicalAddress);
    logEvent("Pre-emptive Remapping: " + logicalAddress + " -> " + newPhysicalAddress);
  }
}

function findReplacementAddress() {
  // Scan available memory sectors
  // Prioritize sectors with low usage
  // Return the address of the selected replacement sector
}

function establishBaseline() {
  // Monitor memory access patterns for a specified period
  // Calculate average read/write latencies, error rates
  // Store baseline metrics for each sector
}
```

**6.  Key Innovations:**

*   **Predictive Remapping:** Proactive remapping *before* data loss, unlike traditional error correction which reacts to failures.
*   **Combined Analysis:** Integrated analysis of multiple factors (access patterns, environmental conditions, error rates) for more accurate failure prediction.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:**  Continuous learning and adaptation of the failure prediction model based on real-time data.
*   **Granular Control:** Sector-level remapping for optimized performance and minimized disruption.
