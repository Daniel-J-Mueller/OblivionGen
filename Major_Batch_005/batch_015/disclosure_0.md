## Dynamic Destination Profiling with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Expand the risk scoring beyond static cost/risk classifications to incorporate real-time behavioral biometrics of the *destination endpoint* itself, creating a dynamic profile reflecting its ongoing activity.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on classifying destinations as "high risk" or "high cost." This is inherently limited. A destination might *appear* legitimate initially, but exhibit anomalous behavior over time – a sudden spike in call volume, changes in call duration patterns, or unusual routing patterns. Behavioral biometrics can detect this.

**System Specs:**

*   **Destination Endpoint Monitor (DEM):** A network-based component deployed (or accessible via API) within the service provider's infrastructure.  Continuously monitors network traffic *to* each destination endpoint.
*   **Biometric Feature Extraction Module:** Extracts the following features:
    *   **Call Volume Density:**  Number of calls received per unit of time (e.g., calls/minute).
    *   **Call Duration Distribution:** Statistical analysis (mean, standard deviation, skewness) of call durations.
    *   **Inter-Call Timing:**  Time between successive calls.
    *   **Routing Pattern Analysis:**  Tracks the network paths used for calls to the destination.  Identifies deviations from established norms.
    *   **Caller Diversity:** Number of unique originating phone numbers calling the destination within a period.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Employs machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests, one-class SVMs) trained on historical data to establish a "normal" behavioral profile for each destination.  Flags deviations from this profile as anomalies.
*   **Trust Score Adjustment Module:** Integrates the anomaly score generated by the Anomaly Detection Engine into the overall trust score calculation.  A higher anomaly score lowers the trust score.
*   **Real-time Feedback Loop:** Continuously updates the behavioral profile as new data becomes available.  Allows the system to adapt to changes in destination behavior.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each incoming connection request
connectionRequest = receiveConnectionRequest()
destinationEndpoint = connectionRequest.destinationEndpoint
customerAccount = connectionRequest.customerAccount

// Retrieve existing trust score (from patent's existing system)
trustScore = getTrustScore(customerAccount, destinationEndpoint)

// Get real-time biometric data
biometricData = getBiometricData(destinationEndpoint)

// Calculate anomaly score
anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(biometricData)

// Adjust trust score based on anomaly score
adjustedTrustScore = trustScore * (1 - anomalyScoreWeight * anomalyScore)

// Determine if connection is allowed
if adjustedTrustScore > allowThreshold:
    allowConnection(connectionRequest)
else:
    denyConnection(connectionRequest)
```

**Data Storage:**

*   **Biometric Feature Database:** Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) to store biometric feature data for each destination endpoint.
*   **Behavioral Profiles:** Store the "normal" behavioral profile (statistical parameters) for each destination.

**Scalability:**

*   **Distributed Architecture:** Deploy DEM and Anomaly Detection Engine across multiple servers to handle high traffic volumes.
*   **Data Partitioning:** Partition biometric data based on destination endpoint to improve query performance.

**Novelty:** This approach goes beyond static risk assessments by adding a dynamic layer of behavioral analysis. It allows for the detection of previously unknown fraudulent destinations and adapts to changes in destination behavior, offering a more robust and proactive security solution. It’s an adaptive system, unlike a pre-defined risk matrix.
