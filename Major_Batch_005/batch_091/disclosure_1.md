## Dynamic Concept "Bubbles" & Contextual Expansion

**Concept:** Implement a visual and interactive system where concepts aren't just linked *within* an index, but exist as dynamically sized and positioned "bubbles" overlaid on the content itself. These bubbles represent the conceptual density surrounding a selected term.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Visual Element:**  Overlaid transparent "bubbles" of varying sizes and opacity directly on the rendered text/content. Bubble size correlates to the frequency/weight of the concept within the current document *and* its overall prominence in a user’s personalized knowledge graph (built from past interactions).
*   **Selection & Activation:** When a user selects a term (touch, click, cursor), the corresponding bubble becomes highlighted. This triggers a contextual expansion – not just a definition or linked term, but a dynamic visualization of related concepts.
*   **Expansion Mechanism:** Upon bubble highlight, *smaller* bubbles representing closely related concepts appear *around* the primary bubble.  Bubble distance from the primary bubble represents conceptual closeness – near = high correlation.
*   **Interaction Layers:**
    *   **Tap/Click on a Secondary Bubble:**  Expands *that* secondary bubble, revealing its own related concepts, creating a recursive exploration path.
    *   **Drag/Swipe on Primary Bubble:**  Repositioning the primary bubble alters the visibility/priority of related concepts – conceptually "shifting focus".
    *   **Long Press/Hold:**  Triggers a “conceptual summary” – a concise paragraph or bulleted list generated by an AI based on the combined weight of all visible bubbles.
*   **Personalization Engine:** The system learns from user interactions.  Frequently expanded bubbles become larger/more prominent. Ignored/dismissed bubbles shrink/fade. This creates a personalized “concept map” overlaid on all content.
*   **Cross-Document Correlation:**  Bubbles aren't limited to the current document.  The system searches accessible content for instances of related concepts, visually linking them to the current bubble via faint connecting lines.

**Pseudocode (Expansion Trigger):**

```
function onConceptSelected(conceptTerm):
  highlightBubble(conceptTerm)
  relatedConcepts = getRelatedConcepts(conceptTerm, userKnowledgeGraph)
  
  for each concept in relatedConcepts:
    bubble = createBubble(concept)
    bubble.position = calculatePositionRelativeTo(highlightedBubble, concept) //Based on conceptual distance
    bubble.size = calculateSizeBasedOn(concept.weight, userInteractionHistory)
    displayBubble(bubble)
  
  //Update cross-document links (faint connecting lines)
  updateCrossDocumentLinks(highlightedBubble)
end function

function updateCrossDocumentLinks(primaryBubble):
    for each accessibleDocument:
        relatedConceptsInDocument = findConceptsInDocument(accessibleDocument)
        for each concept in relatedConceptsInDocument:
            if isRelated(concept, primaryBubble.concept):
                drawLink(primaryBubble.concept, concept, document)
end function
```

**Potential Hardware Requirements:** Device with a reasonably powerful GPU to handle dynamic bubble rendering and real-time updates.  Touchscreen interface for intuitive interaction.

**Future Enhancements:** Integration with voice assistants.  AR/VR implementation for 3D concept exploration.  AI-powered bubble clustering to automatically identify key themes within a document.
