## Automated Inventory "Swarm" with Dynamic Re-Orientation

**Concept:** Expand beyond single mobile drive unit/inventory holder pairings to a multi-unit “swarm” system. This allows for dynamic re-orientation of inventory *between* units while in transit, effectively acting as a distributed, self-reconfiguring transport layer. 

**Specifications:**

*   **Unit Type:** Two primary unit types: "Carrier" units & "Router" units.
    *   **Carrier:** Holds a single inventory holder.  Basic translational movement capability. Minimal rotational capability (primarily for docking).
    *   **Router:**  No inventory holder.  Equipped with a multi-axis robotic arm and a secure inventory holder interface.  Designed to receive, rotate, and transfer inventory holders between units. Possesses advanced path planning and collision avoidance capabilities.
*   **Inventory Holder Interface:**  Standardized interface (mechanical and electrical) allowing secure docking and transfer between Carrier and Router units. Incorporates quick-release mechanisms & data communication protocols.
*   **Swarm Communication:**  Units communicate wirelessly (UWB/5G) to share position, velocity, inventory data, and routing instructions. Uses a distributed consensus algorithm for robust operation.
*   **Dynamic Re-Orientation Protocol:**
    1.  **Request Initiation:** Destination system requests an inventory item.
    2.  **Route Calculation:** Swarm control algorithm calculates an optimal route, potentially involving multiple transfers.
    3.  **Transfer Coordination:** A Router unit intercepts the Carrier unit holding the item.
    4.  **Secure Docking:** Router and Carrier units establish a secure connection.
    5.  **Rotational Adjustment:** Router unit's robotic arm rotates the inventory holder to the correct orientation for the next leg of the journey or final delivery.
    6.  **Transfer/Hand-off:** Inventory holder is transferred to another Carrier unit or directly to the destination system.
    7.  **Resume Transit:** Carrier units resume transit along their assigned routes.
*   **Workspace Mapping:** System utilizes real-time localization (SLAM) to create and maintain a dynamic map of the workspace.  Identifies optimal transfer points & potential obstacles.
*   **Power System:** Wireless inductive charging stations distributed throughout the workspace. Units automatically navigate to charging stations when battery levels are low.
*   **Redundancy:** Swarm system is designed with redundancy in mind.  If a unit fails, the system automatically reroutes traffic around the failed unit.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Re-Orientation Sequence):**

```
FUNCTION ReorientAndTransfer(CarrierUnit, RouterUnit, TargetOrientation):

  // 1. Docking
  WHILE Distance(CarrierUnit, RouterUnit) > DockingThreshold:
    AdjustVelocity(CarrierUnit, ApproachVelocity)
    AdjustVelocity(RouterUnit, CounterVelocity)

  EngageDockingMechanism(CarrierUnit, RouterUnit)

  // 2. Rotation
  CalculateRotationAngle(CurrentOrientation, TargetOrientation)
  ActivateRotationArm(RouterUnit, RotationAngle)
  WHILE RotationComplete() == FALSE:
    MonitorRotationProgress()

  // 3. Transfer
  ReleaseInventoryHolder(RouterUnit)
  ReceiveInventoryHolder(NextCarrierUnit)

  DisengageDockingMechanism(RouterUnit, NextCarrierUnit)

END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This differs from the referenced patent by moving beyond individual unit transport to a distributed, self-reconfiguring swarm system. The dynamic re-orientation *between* units allows for greater flexibility, efficiency, and robustness. It introduces concepts of swarm intelligence and distributed control to the automated material handling space.
