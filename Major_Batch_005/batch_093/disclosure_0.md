## Dynamic Index Sharding with Predictive Pre-Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic directory modification concept to *shard* the index across multiple “index volumes” or partitions, proactively allocating space based on predicted growth, and dynamically migrating data pages between them. This addresses potential bottlenecks with a single, monolithic index structure, especially with large ebook libraries.

**Specs:**

*   **Index Volume Manager:** A module responsible for managing multiple index volumes. Each volume is a discrete file or storage unit.
*   **Predictive Growth Engine:**
    *   Data Input: Tracks ebook addition/deletion rates, ebook sizes, and indexing depth.
    *   Algorithm: Utilizes a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to predict future index size growth.  The forecasting horizon should be configurable.
    *   Output: Projected index size for the next X days/weeks/months.
*   **Sharding Strategy:**
    *   Initial Shard Count: Start with a small number of shards (e.g., 2-4).
    *   Shard Fullness Threshold: Define a percentage threshold (e.g., 70%) that triggers shard splitting.
    *   Splitting Algorithm: When a shard exceeds the fullness threshold:
        1.  Create a new shard.
        2.  Distribute data pages from the full shard to the new shard based on a hash function applied to the indexed ebook’s ID or title.  This ensures consistent distribution.
        3.  Update the main directory structure to point to both shards for relevant ebooks.
*   **Data Page Migration:**
    *   Background Process: A continuous background process monitors shard fullness and performs data page migration.
    *   Migration Trigger: Trigger migration when shard fullness exceeds a pre-defined threshold (lower than the splitting threshold).
    *   Migration Algorithm: Move data pages to the least full shard, utilizing the same hash function as the splitting algorithm.
    *   Transaction Management: Ensure data integrity during migration using transactional operations.
*   **Directory Structure:**
    *   Hierarchical: Maintain a hierarchical directory structure that maps ebooks to the shards containing their index data.
    *   Metadata Storage: Each shard should store metadata about the ebooks it indexes.
*   **API:**
    *   `getIndexLocation(ebookId)`: Returns the shard ID where the index data for a given ebook is stored.
    *   `addEbook(ebookId, indexData)`: Adds the index data for a new ebook, automatically placing it on the appropriate shard.
    *   `removeEbook(ebookId)`: Removes the index data for an ebook.
*   **Pseudocode (addEbook):**

```
function addEbook(ebookId, indexData):
  shardId = hash(ebookId) % numberOfShards
  // Acquire lock on shardId
  write indexData to shardId
  // Release lock on shardId
  update main directory with ebookId -> shardId
  monitor shard fullness
  if shard fullness > threshold:
    splitShard()
```

*   **Pseudocode (splitShard):**

```
function splitShard():
  newShardId = allocateNewShard()
  //Acquire locks on both shards
  //Distribute index data from full shard to new shard based on hashing algorithm
  //Update directory structure
  //Release locks
```

**Potential Benefits:** Increased scalability, improved performance for large ebook libraries, reduced indexing time, and better resource utilization. This allows for significantly larger ebook libraries to be indexed without hitting storage/performance limitations.
