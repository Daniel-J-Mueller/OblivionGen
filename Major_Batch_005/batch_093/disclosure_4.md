## Dynamic Token Permissions & Temporal Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the tokenization service to incorporate dynamically adjustable permissions and time-based access control directly within the tokens themselves.  This moves beyond simple retrieval access, enabling granular control over *what* data can be accessed, and *when*, via the token.

**Specifications:**

**1. Token Structure Enhancement:**

*   **Permission Block:** Add a structured “Permission Block” within the token payload. This block contains a list of permitted operations (read, write, delete, etc.) on specific data fields or sections within the associated data object.  Operations are defined by unique identifiers.
*   **Temporal Validity:** Include “Start Time” and “End Time” fields. Access is restricted to this window.
*   **Conditional Access:** Allow specification of conditions for access.  Conditions are represented as simple boolean expressions evaluated against client attributes (e.g., "client.role == 'admin'" or “client.location == ‘US’”).  These conditions are embedded within the permission block.
*   **Token Versioning:** Implement a version number within the token itself. Enables upgrades to permission structures without invalidating all tokens.

**2. API Extensions:**

*   **`createTokenExtended(dataObjectId, tokenFormat, permissionBlock, startTime, endTime)`:** New API endpoint to create tokens with extended permissions.
*   **`updateTokenPermissions(tokenId, newPermissionBlock)`:** API endpoint to dynamically modify permissions on an existing token (requires authentication & authorization).
*   **`validateTokenExtended(tokenId, requestedOperation, clientAttributes)`:** Core validation function.  This now:
    *   Checks token validity (time window).
    *   Determines if the requested operation is permitted within the token’s Permission Block.
    *   Evaluates any conditional access expressions against the `clientAttributes`.
*   **`getEffectivePermissions(tokenId, clientAttributes)`:** Returns a human-readable summary of the permissions granted by a token for a given client. (For auditing & debugging).

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Permission Engine:** Develop a rule-based “Permission Engine” within the tokenization service. This engine evaluates the Permission Block and conditional expressions. The engine should be pluggable, allowing for the addition of new permission types and condition evaluation functions.
*   **Client Attribute Provider:** Assume a mechanism exists to reliably provide client attributes (role, location, security clearance, etc.) to the tokenization service during `validateTokenExtended` calls.
*   **Token Encryption:** All extended permission data should be encrypted within the token payload for security.
*    **Metadata Storage:**  Associate the token with metadata regarding the permission schema used. This allows the system to correctly interpret older tokens even after permission schema evolution.

**4. Pseudocode for `validateTokenExtended`:**

```
function validateTokenExtended(tokenId, requestedOperation, clientAttributes):
  token = getToken(tokenId)
  if token.endTime < currentTime:
    return false  // Token expired

  if token.startTime > currentTime:
    return false // Token not yet active

  permissionBlock = decrypt(token.permissionBlock)

  if not permissionBlock.contains(requestedOperation):
    return false  // Operation not permitted

  // Evaluate conditional access (if any)
  for condition in permissionBlock.conditions:
    if not evaluateCondition(condition, clientAttributes):
      return false

  return true // Token valid and permissions granted
```

**Novelty:**  Current tokenization focuses on *accessing* data via a token.  This extends that to *controlling* *how* data is accessed – adding a granular permission layer directly within the token itself, driven by dynamic conditions and time constraints. This is a shift from access control being handled solely by the data owner to a more distributed, token-centric model.
