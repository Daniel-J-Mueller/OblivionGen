## Adaptive Durability with Predictive Failure Analysis

**System Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Object-Redundant Storage Service (ORSS) - Existing system from provided patent.
    *   Key-Durable Storage Service (KDSS) - Existing system from provided patent.
    *   Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) Module - New.  Hardware/software component analyzing disk health metrics.
    *   Dynamic Sharding Controller (DSC) - New.  Software component mediating between ORSS, KDSS, and PFA.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Disk Health Profile*:  Time-series data for each disk – temperature, read/write errors, latency, SMART data.  Stored locally by PFA.
    *   *Object Durability Profile*:  Metadata associated with each data object – current shard count, KDSS key locations, desired durability level, PFA-calculated risk score. Stored within ORSS metadata.
    *   *Sharding Map*: Mapping of data object shards to specific disks. Managed by DSC.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond static durability schemes by *dynamically adjusting* data redundancy based on predicted disk failures.  The core idea is to proactively increase replication/sharding for data stored on disks exhibiting signs of imminent failure, *before* actual data loss occurs.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **PFA Monitoring:** The PFA module continuously monitors disk health metrics. It employs machine learning models (e.g., time-series forecasting, anomaly detection) to predict potential disk failures with associated confidence scores.
2.  **Risk Score Assignment:** The PFA module feeds risk scores to the DSC.
3.  **Durability Adjustment:** The DSC, upon receiving risk scores, dynamically adjusts the durability level of data objects stored on affected disks.
    *   **High Risk:**  The DSC instructs the ORSS to create *additional* shards of the data object. These new shards are stored on healthy disks, and KDSS keys are generated and registered. This effectively *increases* the replication factor for that object.
    *   **Moderate Risk:** The DSC may trigger a 'repair' operation, re-distributing existing shards to ensure no single disk holds a critical number of shards for any object.
    *   **Low Risk:** No action is taken.
4.  **Shard Migration:**  The ORSS handles the actual shard creation and migration, interacting with the KDSS to manage key generation and storage.
5.  **Failure Response (Enhanced):**  If a disk *does* fail, the system not only identifies lost data (as described in the patent) but can also *reduce* the replication factor of data stored on *other* disks exhibiting increased risk, rebalancing resources and minimizing overall system overhead.  This avoids unnecessary redundancy where it's not immediately needed.

**Pseudocode (DSC - Durability Adjustment Logic):**

```
function adjust_durability(object_id, disk_id, risk_score):
  object_profile = get_object_profile(object_id)
  current_shard_count = object_profile.shard_count
  desired_durability = object_profile.desired_durability

  if risk_score > HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    new_shard_count = current_shard_count + 2  // Increase redundancy significantly
  elif risk_score > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    new_shard_count = current_shard_count + 1 // Moderate increase
  else:
    return // No adjustment needed

  if new_shard_count > maximum_shard_count:
    new_shard_count = maximum_shard_count

  // Initiate shard creation/migration process
  create_new_shards(object_id, new_shard_count - current_shard_count)

  // Update object profile with new shard count
  update_object_profile(object_id, new_shard_count)

function create_new_shards(object_id, num_shards):
  for i in range(num_shards):
    shard_data = read_object_data(object_id, shard_index)
    new_shard_id = generate_shard_id()
    store_shard_data(new_shard_id, shard_data, healthy_disk)
    generate_kdss_key(new_shard_id)
```

**Key Innovation:** Proactive, predictive adjustment of data durability levels, rather than a static approach. This reduces storage costs by minimizing unnecessary redundancy while improving overall system resilience. This shifts the paradigm from *reacting* to data loss to *preventing* it.
