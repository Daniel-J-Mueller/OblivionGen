## Modular, Bio-Integrated Shipping Container

**Concept:** A shipping container constructed from mycelium composite, incorporating real-time environmental monitoring and active humidity/temperature control powered by integrated microbial fuel cells. This moves beyond static containment to a *living* shipping solution.

**Specs:**

1.  **Container Structure:**
    *   Material: Primarily mycelium composite (specifically *Pleurotus ostreatus* - oyster mushroom) grown around a biodegradable scaffold of hemp fiber and recycled cardboard.  Mycelium density and structural integrity optimized via computational fluid dynamics modelling during growth phase.
    *   Dimensions: Standard ISO container sizes (20ft, 40ft) – adaptable via growth parameters.
    *   Waterproofing:  Coating of a bio-based, hydrophobic polymer derived from chitosan (shrimp shells).  Self-healing properties incorporated via embedded microcapsules containing chitosan solution.
    *   Internal Framework:  Bamboo or rapidly renewable wood lattice integrated during mycelium growth to provide additional load-bearing support.

2.  **Environmental Monitoring System:**
    *   Sensors: Array of micro-sensors embedded within the mycelium walls, monitoring:
        *   Temperature (±0.1°C accuracy)
        *   Humidity (±2% RH accuracy)
        *   CO2 levels (ppm)
        *   Ethylene gas (ppb) – crucial for produce transport.
        *   Shock/Vibration (accelerometer data)
        *   Light exposure (lux)
    *   Data Transmission: LoRaWAN connectivity for long-range, low-power data transmission to a central monitoring platform.
    *   Power: Microbial Fuel Cells (see #4).

3.  **Active Humidity/Temperature Control:**
    *   Mechanism:  Integrated network of microfluidic channels within the mycelium walls.  
    *   Cooling: Evaporative cooling achieved by controlled wicking of water through the mycelium matrix. Water source: Condensed atmospheric moisture collected on exterior surfaces and recycled condensate from transported goods.
    *   Heating: Bioelectrochemical heating – small electrical current passed through strategically placed carbon fiber filaments embedded in the mycelium, generating heat.
    *   Control Algorithm: PID controller regulating temperature and humidity based on sensor data and pre-set parameters (user-definable via software interface).

4.  **Power Generation – Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs):**
    *   MFC Design: Stacked MFCs integrated into the container walls and floor.  
    *   Fuel: Organic waste generated *by* the shipped goods themselves (e.g., fruit peels, vegetable trimmings, packaging materials).  Worm composting system incorporated to pre-process organic waste.
    *   Electrolyte:  Non-toxic, bio-based electrolyte derived from algal biomass.
    *   Energy Storage:  Supercapacitors integrated to store energy generated by MFCs, providing power for sensors, microfluidic pumps, and data transmission.
    *   Efficiency: Target minimum power output: 5W continuous.

5.  **Biodegradability & End-of-Life:**
    *   Container designed for complete biodegradability.
    *   Upon reaching destination, container can be composted *in situ*, returning nutrients to the soil.
    *   Sensors and electronics designed for easy removal and recycling.

**Pseudocode – Active Control System:**

```
LOOP:
    READ sensor data (temperature, humidity, CO2, ethylene, shock)
    CALCULATE error = (setpoint - sensor_reading)
    APPLY PID controller:
        output = Kp * error + Ki * integral(error) + Kd * derivative(error)
    ACTUATE:
        IF output > 0:
            Activate evaporative cooling (microfluidic pump)
        IF output < 0:
            Activate bioelectrochemical heating (carbon fiber filaments)
        Adjust microfluidic pump speed/heating power based on output magnitude
    TRANSMIT data to central monitoring platform
    DELAY (1 minute)
END LOOP
