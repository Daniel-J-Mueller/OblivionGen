## Adaptive Endpoint "Health" Scoring with Predictive Failure Modeling

**System Overview:**

This system extends the existing availability checking by introducing a dynamic, predictive “health” score for each endpoint, moving beyond simple up/down status. It leverages machine learning to anticipate endpoint failures *before* they impact service, and adapts query frequency based on predicted risk.

**Components:**

1.  **Historical Data Collector:** Continuously gathers data from the existing availability checks *and* performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rates) from each endpoint. This data is time-stamped and stored.
2.  **Feature Engineer:**  Extracts relevant features from the historical data. Examples:
    *   Recent response times (average, standard deviation)
    *   Frequency of errors
    *   Rate of change in performance metrics
    *   Correlation with external factors (network congestion, time of day).
3.  **Predictive Model Trainer:** Uses the engineered features to train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict the probability of endpoint failure within a defined timeframe (e.g., next hour, next 24 hours). The model is retrained periodically to adapt to changing conditions.
4.  **Health Score Generator:**  Applies the trained model to current endpoint data to generate a “health score” (0-100) for each endpoint. Higher scores indicate lower risk of failure.
5.  **Adaptive Query Scheduler:**  Dynamically adjusts the frequency of availability checks for each endpoint based on its health score.
    *   Endpoints with high health scores are checked less frequently.
    *   Endpoints with low health scores are checked more frequently, and potentially with more detailed probes (e.g., checking specific content versions).
6.  **Endpoint "Warm-up" Mechanism:**  If an endpoint's health score drops significantly, initiate a "warm-up" sequence.  This involves sending a controlled burst of low-priority requests to the endpoint to verify its responsiveness and potentially trigger scaling actions before it becomes overloaded.
7. **Reporting & Remediation Interface:** A dashboard to visualize endpoint health scores, predicted failure rates, and trigger automated remediation actions (e.g., failover to a healthy endpoint, scale up resources).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Query Scheduler):**

```
// Configuration Parameters
BASE_QUERY_FREQUENCY = 60 seconds  // Default check interval
HEALTH_SCORE_THRESHOLD_LOW = 30  // Below this, increase frequency
HEALTH_SCORE_THRESHOLD_HIGH = 70 // Above this, decrease frequency
FREQUENCY_MULTIPLIER_LOW = 2   // Double frequency for low scores
FREQUENCY_MULTIPLIER_HIGH = 0.5 // Halve frequency for high scores

// For each Endpoint:
  current_health_score = HealthScoreGenerator.getScore(endpoint)

  if current_health_score < HEALTH_SCORE_THRESHOLD_LOW:
    query_frequency = BASE_QUERY_FREQUENCY * FREQUENCY_MULTIPLIER_LOW
  else if current_health_score > HEALTH_SCORE_THRESHOLD_HIGH:
    query_frequency = BASE_QUERY_FREQUENCY * FREQUENCY_MULTIPLIER_HIGH
  else:
    query_frequency = BASE_QUERY_FREQUENCY

  ScheduleAvailabilityCheck(endpoint, query_frequency)
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus) for historical performance metrics.
*   Key-value store (e.g., Redis) for storing current health scores and query frequencies.

**Novelty & Potential:**

This moves beyond reactive availability checking to *proactive* failure prediction, improving service resilience and reducing impact on users. The adaptive query frequency optimizes resource usage and minimizes unnecessary load on endpoints. The warm-up mechanism and reporting interface provide additional layers of control and automation. This is far more than just reporting which endpoints are 'up' or 'down'; it is a holistic system for endpoint health management.
