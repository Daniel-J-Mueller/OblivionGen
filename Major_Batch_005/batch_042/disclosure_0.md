**Proximity-Based Predictive Parcel Protection System**

**Concept:** Expand the theft *detection* system into a *predictive* and preventative one by leveraging proximity data, historical theft patterns, and a 'safe zone' network. Instead of *reacting* to theft, proactively mitigate risk.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing A/V Device (as per provided patent) - Camera, Communication Module, Processing Module.
    *   Bluetooth/UWB Beacons: Low-energy beacons placed strategically within a defined 'safe zone' radius (configurable - 50ft - 500ft) around each registered A/V device. Beacons transmit identifying signals.
    *   User Mobile Device (Smartphone/Tablet): Required for initial registration, safe zone configuration, and alert customization.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Safe Zone Configuration Module:** User defines a 'safe zone' radius around their A/V device.
    *   **Beacon Detection & Mapping:** A/V device (or dedicated hub) detects and maps beacon signals.  Signal strength corresponds to proximity.
    *   **Historical Theft Data Aggregation:** System collects anonymized data on theft occurrences (location, time of day, parcel carrier, reported value). This data is stored server-side.
    *   **Risk Assessment Engine:**  Combines:
        *   Current proximity data (beacon signals).
        *   Historical theft data for the location.
        *   Time of day.
        *   Parcel tracking data (carrier, expected delivery window).
        *   User-defined risk tolerance (configurable sensitivity).
    *   **Proactive Deterrence Actions:** Based on risk assessment, system triggers actions *before* a potential theft:
        *   **Automated Lighting Activation:**  Turns on porch lights/security lights.
        *   **Automated Audio Alert:**  Plays a pre-recorded message (“You are being recorded”, or simulated dog barking).
        *   **'Ghost Parcel' Simulation:**  Uses the A/V device to project a holographic or AR image of a parcel *inside* the delivery area, even if no parcel is present. This creates a visual deterrent and potentially confuses thieves.
        *   **Automated Social Media Notification:** Posts a temporary status to the user’s social media (“Parcel delivery in progress. Area under surveillance.”) – user configurable.
    *   **Alert Escalation:** If preventative actions fail and a theft is detected (as in original patent), the system escalates to the standard alert mechanisms.

**Pseudocode (Risk Assessment Engine):**

```
function assessRisk(location, time, parcelData, beaconData) {
  // Fetch historical theft data for location
  historicalTheftRate = getHistoricalTheftRate(location);

  // Calculate proximity score based on beacon data
  proximityScore = calculateProximityScore(beaconData); //Higher score = closer proximity

  // Time of day weight (higher risk at night)
  timeWeight = getTimeWeight(time);

  // Parcel Value Weight
  parcelValueWeight = getParcelValueWeight(parcelData);

  // Calculate overall risk score
  riskScore = (historicalTheftRate * 0.3) + (proximityScore * 0.4) + (timeWeight * 0.1) + (parcelValueWeight * 0.2);

  // Threshold for triggering preventative actions
  if (riskScore > riskThreshold) {
    triggerPreventativeActions();
  }

  return riskScore;
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Integration with local law enforcement databases for increased historical data accuracy.
*   Machine learning to refine risk assessment algorithms over time.
*   User-configurable 'safe zones' that can be temporarily adjusted (e.g., while on vacation).
*   Gamification: Reward users for maintaining secure delivery zones (e.g., badges, discounts).
