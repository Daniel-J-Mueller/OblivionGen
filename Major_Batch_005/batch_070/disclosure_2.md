## Adaptive Haptic Lock Indicator

**Concept:** Expand the visual orientation lock indication with localized haptic feedback, dynamically adjusting intensity and pattern to convey *degrees* of orientation constraint, rather than a simple locked/unlocked state.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Engine Integration:** Utilize a high-resolution haptic engine (e.g., ultrasonic transducer array or advanced ERM/LRA) integrated into the device bezel surrounding the orientation lock icon area.
*   **Constraint Levels:** Define three constraint levels:
    *   **Level 1 (Fully Locked):** Strong, constant haptic feedback. Consistent vibration/texture. User knows it *will not* rotate.
    *   **Level 2 (Soft Lock):**  Pulsating haptic feedback, lower intensity. Indicates a slight resistance to rotation – the system will attempt to maintain orientation but *may* allow a rotation if a strong force is applied. Think of it like a 'sticky' rotation.
    *   **Level 3 (Unlocked):** No haptic feedback. Standard device haptics for other interactions apply.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  The system monitors device acceleration and gyroscope data *constantly*.
    *   If a user initiates a rotation attempt while in Level 1, the haptic engine *increases* resistance, creating a forceful ‘bump’ sensation.
    *   If the user overrides the lock (forcefully rotates), transition to Level 2 with corresponding haptic change.
    *   If a device is actively rotated into a new orientation, transition to Level 3.
*   **User Customization:**
    *   Allow users to customize the intensity and pattern of haptic feedback for each constraint level.
    *   Option to map constraint levels to specific gestures (e.g., long press to enable soft lock).
*   **Software Integration:**
    *   Expose an API allowing applications to request specific constraint levels for content display.
    *   Example: A mapping app could set a ‘soft lock’ when a route is in progress, preventing accidental rotation while navigating.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize haptic engine

function updateHapticFeedback(constraintLevel) {
  switch (constraintLevel) {
    case "Locked":
      hapticEngine.setPattern(StrongConstantVibration);
      hapticEngine.setIntensity(MaxIntensity);
      break;
    case "SoftLock":
      hapticEngine.setPattern(PulsatingVibration);
      hapticEngine.setIntensity(MediumIntensity);
      break;
    case "Unlocked":
      hapticEngine.stop();
      break;
  }
}

// Event Handler: Rotation Attempt
function onRotationAttempt() {
  if (currentConstraintLevel == "Locked") {
    // Increase haptic resistance
    hapticEngine.setIntensity(MaxIntensity + Boost);
    // Provide visual feedback (flash icon)
  }
}

// Event Handler: Constraint Level Change
function onConstraintLevelChange(newLevel) {
  updateHapticFeedback(newLevel);
}
```
