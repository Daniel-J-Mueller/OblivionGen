## Decentralized Reputation System for Password Strength

**Concept:** Leverage a blockchain-based decentralized reputation system to incentivize users to adopt strong, unique passwords, and to provide a transparent, verifiable measure of password strength *beyond* simply adhering to a character-complexity requirement. This moves past the ‘requirement’ and into an ‘earned benefit’ system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Blockchain Integration:** Utilize a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) to store “Proof of Password Strength” (PoPS) records.  PoPS records are cryptographically signed attestations of a password's strength, verified by a network of “Password Strength Oracles”.
*   **Password Strength Oracles:** These are independent nodes running algorithms to assess password strength. They go beyond typical regex checks. They incorporate:
    *   **Entropy Calculation:** Accurate estimation of password entropy.
    *   **Breach Database Lookup:**  Real-time checking against known breached password lists.
    *   **Pattern Recognition:**  Detection of common password patterns (e.g., sequential numbers, keyboard walks).
    *   **AI-Powered Analysis:** A lightweight AI model trained to identify subtly weak passwords that evade traditional checks.
*   **PoPS Generation:**
    1.  User creates/changes password.
    2.  Password hash (not the password itself) is submitted to multiple Password Strength Oracles.
    3.  Oracles assess strength and return a “Strength Score” and a digitally signed “PoPS Certificate”.
    4.  The PoPS Certificate (containing Strength Score and Oracle signature) is stored on the blockchain.
*   **Reputation System:** Users accumulate “Reputation Points” based on the Strength Score of their passwords. Higher Reputation Points unlock benefits:
    *   Reduced Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) prompts.
    *   Priority access to services.
    *   Discounts on premium features.
*   **Data Privacy:**  The blockchain only stores the *metadata* about password strength (Strength Score, Oracle signature). The *password itself* remains securely hashed and stored by the service provider as usual.
*   **API Integration:**  Services integrate with the blockchain via an API to verify a user's Reputation Score before granting access.
*   **Scalability:** Blockchain choice will have to be carefully considered for transaction rate.

**Pseudocode (API Endpoint - Authentication):**

```
function authenticateUser(username, passwordHash, reputationScore) {
  // 1. Verify password hash against stored hash for username.
  if (passwordHash != getStoredPasswordHash(username)) {
    return "Invalid Credentials";
  }

  // 2. Check Reputation Score
  if (reputationScore < MINIMUM_SCORE) {
      // Require MFA or other secondary verification
      triggerMFA();
      return "MFA Required";
  } else {
      // Allow access
      return "Access Granted";
  }
}
```

**Potential Improvements:**

*   **Incentivized Oracles:** Reward Oracles for accurately assessing password strength (staking tokens).
*   **Dynamic Scoring:** Adjust Reputation Scores based on the age of the password.
*   **Cross-Service Reputation:** Allow users to port their Reputation Score between different services.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce challenges and rewards to encourage users to improve their password strength.
