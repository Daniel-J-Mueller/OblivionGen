## Dynamic Data Provenance & Temporal Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the data collection and analysis system to not just *process* time-series data, but to meticulously track its provenance – *how* each data point arrived, what transformations it underwent, and to allow for ‘rewinding’ the data stream to any prior state. This goes beyond simply storing data; it's about storing the *history* of the data.

**Specs:**

1.  **Provenance Metadata:** Each `data analysis datapoint` (as defined in the patent) will be augmented with a `provenance record`. This record will include:
    *   `source_device_id`: Identifier of the client device submitting the data.
    *   `submission_timestamp`: Precise time of initial data submission.
    *   `processing_node_id`: ID of the host computer that initially processed the data.
    *   `transformation_history`:  A linked list/stack of transformation operations applied, including the operation type, parameters used, and the processing node ID where it occurred.  Each entry: `{operation_type: string, parameters: object, node_id: string, timestamp: timestamp}`
    *   `data_hash`: A cryptographic hash of the *original* data value for verification.

2.  **Temporal Data Storage:**  The `data repository` will be modified to store data in immutable 'snapshots' keyed by timestamp. Instead of overwriting existing data, each update creates a new snapshot. This allows for perfect reconstruction of past states. Data will be stored in columnar format for efficient querying.

3.  **Snapshotting Mechanism:**  Every time a `data processing result` is generated from an `additional data analysis datapoint`, a new snapshot of the affected data within the `data structure` will be created.

4.  **Temporal Query Language (TQL):** A new query language extension to the existing system. TQL will allow users to specify a `timestamp` or `timestamp range` for data retrieval.  Example:  `SELECT data_value FROM sensor_data WHERE sensor_id = 123 AT 2024-10-27 10:00:00`.  Or: `SELECT AVG(data_value) FROM sensor_data WHERE sensor_id = 123 BETWEEN 2024-10-27 09:00:00 AND 2024-10-27 11:00:00`.

5.  **'Rewind' Functionality:**  A core system function allowing users (or automated processes) to 'rewind' the data stream to a specific point in time.  This will involve retrieving the data from the corresponding snapshot in the `data repository`.

6.  **Data Reconciliation:** Implement a system for automatic data reconciliation. Periodically compare data from different snapshots to identify discrepancies.  Flag discrepancies for investigation or correction.

7.  **Workflow Integration:**  Extend the system to support ‘auditable workflows’. Each workflow step will be recorded with the data used, parameters, and the resulting data processing result.  This creates a complete audit trail.

**Pseudocode (Rewind Function):**

```
function rewindData(sensorId, timestamp):
    // 1. Validate sensorId and timestamp
    if (sensorId is invalid or timestamp is invalid):
        return error("Invalid parameters")

    // 2. Locate the correct snapshot in the data repository
    snapshot = dataRepository.getSnapshot(sensorId, timestamp)

    // 3. If no snapshot exists at the exact timestamp, find the nearest snapshot before the timestamp
    if (snapshot is null):
        snapshot = dataRepository.getNearestSnapshotBefore(sensorId, timestamp)
        if (snapshot is null):
            return error("No data available at or before the specified timestamp")

    // 4. Extract the data from the snapshot
    data = snapshot.getData()

    // 5. Return the data
    return data
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Root Cause Analysis:**  Easily trace data back to its origin to identify the source of errors.
*   **Fraud Detection:** Reconstruct past events to identify fraudulent activity.
*   **Compliance Auditing:**  Provide a complete audit trail of data changes for compliance purposes.
*   **Predictive Maintenance:**  Analyze historical data to predict equipment failures.
*   **Scientific Research:**  Reproduce experiments by reconstructing past data states.
