## Adaptive Object Persona Generation

**Concept:** Extend object recognition beyond simple identification to generate dynamic "personas" for detected objects, influencing downstream content adaptation and user interaction.

**Specification:**

**I. Persona Data Structure:**

*   `ObjectID`: Unique identifier assigned to the detected object instance.
*   `ObjectType`: (Inherited from recognition system - e.g., “Person”, “Dog”, “Car”).
*   `EmotionalState`: (Initial = Neutral).  A vector representing emotional weighting (e.g., Joy: 0.2, Sadness: 0.1, Anger: 0.0). Updated via behavioral analysis (see II).
*   `InteractionPreference`: (Initial = Passive). Enum: {Passive, Reactive, Proactive}. Influences how supplemental content is presented (see III).
*   `BehavioralHistory`:  Time-series data logging object movement, interactions with other objects, and changes in `EmotionalState`.
*   `NarrativeRole`: (Initial = Undefined). Assigns a role within the overall media narrative – e.g., “Protagonist”, “Antagonist”, “Supporting Character”.  Dynamically adjusted (see II).

**II. Behavioral Analysis & Persona Update Module:**

1.  **Motion Vector Analysis:** Calculate motion vectors for the `ObjectID` over multiple frames. Analyze speed, acceleration, and trajectory. Sudden, erratic movements increase ‘Agitation’ weighting in `EmotionalState`. Smooth, consistent motion promotes ‘Calm’ weighting.
2.  **Interaction Detection:** Identify interactions between `ObjectID` and other detected objects (proximity, collision, gaze tracking if applicable). Positive interactions (e.g., a person petting a dog) increase ‘Joy’ weighting for both objects. Negative interactions (e.g., a car collision) increase ‘Anger’ and ‘Fear’ weightings.
3.  **Audio Cue Integration:** Analyze audio stream for cues related to `ObjectID` (speech, sounds associated with the object).  Positive vocal tones increase ‘Joy’, negative tones increase ‘Sadness’ or ‘Anger’.
4.  **Narrative Role Assignment:**  Use object interactions and detected emotional states to infer a narrative role.  Objects consistently involved in conflict become ‘Antagonists’. Objects consistently helping others become ‘Protagonists’.
5.  **Persona Update:** Based on the above analyses, update the `EmotionalState`, `InteractionPreference`, and `NarrativeRole` fields within the `Persona Data Structure`.

**III. Content Adaptation Module:**

1.  **Supplemental Content Selection:** Based on `Persona Data`, select supplemental content to enhance the user experience.
    *   **Proactive Objects:** Display relevant information proactively (e.g., for a car identified as belonging to a celebrity, show biographical information).
    *   **Reactive Objects:** Trigger supplemental content upon user interaction (e.g., clicking on a dog displays breed information and local adoption resources).
    *   **Emotional State Matching:** Select music or visual effects that complement the object's emotional state. A ‘Sad’ object might be accompanied by somber music.
2.  **Dynamic Scene Enhancement:** Modify scene parameters based on object personas. Adjust lighting, color grading, or visual effects to emphasize the emotional state of key objects.
3.  **Interactive Narrative Control:**  Allow the user to influence the narrative based on object personas.  For example, the user could choose to help a ‘Sad’ object, triggering a positive narrative arc.
4.  **AI-Driven Dialogue/Narration:** Generate AI-driven dialogue or narration reflecting the object's personality and emotional state.

**IV. System Architecture:**

1.  **Input:** Video Stream, Audio Stream, Metadata.
2.  **Object Recognition:** Existing object recognition system provides `ObjectID`, `ObjectType`, and bounding box coordinates.
3.  **Persona Generation:** Implemented as a separate module running concurrently with object recognition. Receives `ObjectID` and coordinates from object recognition.
4.  **Content Adaptation:**  A separate module that receives `Persona Data` and modifies the video/audio output accordingly.
5.  **Output:** Enhanced video/audio stream with supplemental content and dynamic scene adjustments.
