## Adaptive Session Contextualization with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** A system augmenting the described patent's IP address classification with continuous behavioral biometric analysis to dynamically refine session security profiles.

**Core Concept:**  Rather than *solely* classifying IP addresses as fixed or dynamic, build a continuous ‘trust score’ for a session based on user behavior *within* that session. This moves beyond network characteristics to focus on what the user *does*.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collector:**  Captures a multi-faceted array of user interactions during a session.  This includes:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, patterns).
    *   Mouse movement (speed, acceleration, patterns, hesitation points).
    *   Scrolling behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   Touchscreen interactions (pressure, area, speed).
    *   Application usage patterns (sequence of applications used, time spent in each).
    *   Content interaction (areas clicked, text selected, forms filled).
*   **Behavioral Profile Builder:**  Establishes a baseline behavioral profile for each user (or session initiated by an unauthenticated user).  This uses machine learning to identify typical patterns.
*   **Real-Time Anomaly Detector:** Compares current session behavior against the established baseline profile.  Deviations contribute to a "deviation score."
*   **Dynamic Trust Score Calculator:** Combines the deviation score with the IP address classification (fixed/dynamic) and potentially other contextual factors (time of day, location) to generate a real-time trust score.
*   **Adaptive Authentication Engine:**  Adjusts authentication requirements based on the trust score.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateTrustScore(sessionId)
  deviationScore = GetDeviationScore(sessionId) // From Real-Time Anomaly Detector
  ipClassificationScore = GetIpClassificationScore(sessionId) // Fixed=High, Dynamic=Low
  contextualScore = GetContextualScore(sessionId) // Time, Location
  trustScore = (deviationScore * 0.5) + (ipClassificationScore * 0.3) + (contextualScore * 0.2)
  RETURN trustScore
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION AdjustAuthentication(sessionId)
  trustScore = CalculateTrustScore(sessionId)

  IF trustScore > 0.8 THEN
    authenticationLevel = "Low" // Weak authentication or no authentication
  ELSE IF trustScore > 0.5 THEN
    authenticationLevel = "Medium" // Standard authentication (password, MFA)
  ELSE
    authenticationLevel = "High" // Strong authentication (biometrics, challenge questions)
  END IF

  ApplyAuthenticationLevel(sessionId, authenticationLevel)
END FUNCTION

//In Main Session Loop:
ON Each New Request:
  AdjustAuthentication(sessionId)
  ProcessRequest()
END LOOP
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Behavioral data should be anonymized and securely stored. User consent should be obtained.
*   **Machine Learning Model Updates:** The behavioral profiles need to be continuously updated to account for evolving user behavior.
*   **Multi-Factor Adaptation:**  The authentication level can be combined with other risk factors (e.g., device fingerprinting) to further refine the security posture.
*   **Self-Learning:**  The system can learn from successful and failed authentication attempts to improve its accuracy.
*   **Profiling "Normal" behavior for unauthenticated sessions:** This is crucial to establishing reasonable trust thresholds and avoiding false positives.
