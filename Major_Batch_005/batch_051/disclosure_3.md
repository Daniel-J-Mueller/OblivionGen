## Dynamic Query Federation with AI-Driven Schema Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the proxy service to not only control *execution* of queries but to dynamically *federate* them across heterogeneous data sources, leveraging AI to resolve schema discrepancies in real-time.  This moves beyond policy enforcement to active data integration.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component: Schema AI Engine**

*   **Function:**  Responsible for mapping attributes from incoming queries to corresponding fields in target databases, even when schema names differ or data types are incompatible.
*   **Implementation:** Trained on a corpus of database schemas and query logs.  Utilizes a transformer-based model for semantic understanding of query predicates and table/column definitions.
*   **API:**
    *   `map_query(query, source_schema, target_schemas)`:  Takes an incoming query (SQL or similar), the schema of the original data source, and a list of potential target schemas.  Returns a rewritten query optimized for the target schema(s), along with a confidence score.
    *   `schema_similarity(schema1, schema2)`: Returns a similarity score between two schemas.

**2. Modified Proxy Service**

*   **Extended Functionality:**  In addition to existing policy enforcement, the proxy will now intercept queries and route them to the Schema AI Engine.
*   **Query Routing Logic:**
    1.  Receive query from client.
    2.  Identify relevant target databases based on query content (using metadata tags or AI-based content analysis).
    3.  Send query to Schema AI Engine.
    4.  Schema AI Engine returns rewritten query(s) optimized for the target database(s) *and* a federation plan (which databases to query, and how to combine the results).
    5.  Proxy executes the rewritten query(s) on the appropriate databases.
    6.  Proxy combines the results according to the federation plan and returns them to the client.

**3. Federation Plan Data Structure**

```
{
  "query_id": "unique_query_identifier",
  "steps": [
    {
      "database": "db_1",
      "query": "rewritten_sql_for_db_1",
      "result_alias": "alias_1",
      "join_type": "INNER",  // or LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER
      "join_condition": "alias_1.key = alias_2.key"
    },
    {
      "database": "db_2",
      "query": "rewritten_sql_for_db_2",
      "result_alias": "alias_2"
    }
  ],
  "final_select": "SELECT ... FROM alias_1 JOIN alias_2 ON ...",
  "confidence_score": 0.95
}
```

**4. Adaptive Learning Loop**

*   The system continuously learns from query execution and user feedback (e.g., query rewrites, performance metrics).
*   Federation plans and schema mappings are cached.
*   A reinforcement learning agent optimizes the schema mapping and federation planning process based on reward signals (e.g., query latency, accuracy of results).
*   If the confidence score falls below a threshold, the system can request manual intervention from a data engineer.

**Pseudocode (Proxy Service):**

```python
def handle_query(query, client):
  target_databases = identify_target_databases(query)
  rewritten_queries, federation_plan = schema_ai_engine.map_query(query, source_schema, target_databases)
  if federation_plan.confidence_score < threshold:
    request_manual_intervention(federation_plan)
    return error_response
  results = execute_queries(rewritten_queries, target_databases)
  combined_results = combine_results(results, federation_plan)
  return combined_results
```
