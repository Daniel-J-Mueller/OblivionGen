## Dynamic Receptive Field Assignment via Projected Augmented Reality

**System Overview:** A system to dynamically adjust the perceived size and location of receptacles for pickers using projected augmented reality (PAR) and integration with the existing mote/sensor network. This aims to optimize picking speed and accuracy by intelligently guiding the picker's focus and minimizing search time, especially in high-density or complex picking environments.

**Core Innovation:** The system moves beyond simply *indicating* the correct receptacle. It *modifies the picker’s perception* of the available space, essentially creating a personalized, dynamic receptive field around the target receptacle.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **AR Projection System:** Low-profile, wide-angle projectors integrated into the picking station infrastructure (e.g., mounted on gantry robots, ceiling rails).  These projectors should support high refresh rates and minimal latency.
*   **Picker Headset/Visor:**  Optional, lightweight visor providing positional tracking data and potentially incorporating low-level ambient light filtering.  The system should function without a headset, relying solely on accurate positional tracking of the picker’s hands/arms.
*   **Existing Mote/Sensor Network:** The existing mote and sensor infrastructure forms the foundation for real-time receptacle status and item confirmation.
*   **Central Control System:** Integrates data from the mote network, picker tracking, and AR projection system.

**Software Components:**

*   **Receptive Field Algorithm:** A core algorithm that calculates the optimal “receptive field” around the target receptacle.  Factors considered:
    *   Picker’s current position and orientation.
    *   Receptacle position.
    *   Density of surrounding receptacles.
    *   Item size and shape.
    *   Picker’s historical performance data.
*   **AR Rendering Engine:**  Renders the dynamic receptive field projections.  This will involve:
    *   Projecting a visual “halo” or outline around the target receptacle.
    *   Dynamically adjusting the size and shape of the halo based on the Receptive Field Algorithm.
    *   Using color gradients to indicate distance/proximity.
    *   Optionally, projecting subtle directional cues to guide the picker's hand movement.
*   **Calibration Module:** Allows for precise calibration of the AR projection system to ensure accurate alignment with the physical picking environment.
*   **Data Analytics Module:** Collects data on picker performance and uses machine learning to optimize the Receptive Field Algorithm over time.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Item Assignment:** The control system assigns an item to a picker.
2.  **Target Receptacle Identification:** The system identifies the target receptacle for the item based on the item’s destination.
3.  **Receptive Field Calculation:** The Receptive Field Algorithm calculates the optimal receptive field around the target receptacle.
4.  **AR Projection:** The AR Rendering Engine projects the dynamic receptive field onto the picking environment, visible to the picker.
5.  **Item Placement:** The picker places the item within the projected receptive field.
6.  **Sensor Confirmation:** The mote/sensor network confirms item placement.
7.  **Performance Tracking:** The system tracks picker performance and adjusts the Receptive Field Algorithm as needed.

**Pseudocode (Receptive Field Algorithm):**

```
function calculate_receptive_field(picker_position, receptacle_position, receptacle_density, item_size, picker_history) {

  // Calculate distance between picker and receptacle
  distance = calculate_distance(picker_position, receptacle_position);

  // Adjust receptive field size based on distance and item size
  base_size = item_size * 1.5;
  size = base_size + (distance * 0.1);

  // Adjust size based on receptacle density (crowded = smaller, sparse = larger)
  density_factor = calculate_density_factor(receptacle_density);
  size = size * density_factor;

  // Adjust size based on picker history (faster pickers = smaller field, slower = larger)
  history_factor = get_picker_history_factor(picker_history);
  size = size * history_factor;

  // Calculate receptive field boundaries (e.g., a circular or elliptical region)
  boundaries = calculate_boundaries(receptacle_position, size);

  return boundaries;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Combine AR projections with localized haptic feedback to guide the picker’s hand movement.
*   **Collaborative Picking:** Enable multiple pickers to share a dynamically adjusted receptive field, facilitating collaborative picking tasks.
*   **Predictive Receptive Field Assignment:**  Use machine learning to predict the picker’s next action and proactively adjust the receptive field.
