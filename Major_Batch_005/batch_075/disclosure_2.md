## Adaptive Snapshot Frequency based on Data Entropy

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This system extends the core snapshotting functionality by dynamically adjusting snapshot frequency for individual table partitions based on real-time data entropy. The goal is to optimize storage usage and restore granularity without sacrificing data recovery capabilities. Partitions undergoing minimal change (low entropy) will be snapshotted less frequently, while rapidly changing partitions (high entropy) will be snapshotted more often.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Entropy Calculation Module:**
    *   Periodically (configurable interval - e.g., every 5 minutes) analyzes each partition.
    *   Calculates entropy using a chosen metric (e.g., Shannon Entropy, Approximate Entropy) on a sample of recently written data.  The choice of entropy metric should be configurable.
    *   Output: Entropy score for each partition.

2.  **Adaptive Frequency Manager:**
    *   Receives entropy scores from the Entropy Calculation Module.
    *   Maintains a baseline snapshot frequency for all partitions (configurable).
    *   Applies a multiplier to the baseline frequency based on the entropy score.
        *   Entropy < Threshold 1: Multiplier = 0.5 (snapshot half as often)
        *   Threshold 1 <= Entropy < Threshold 2: Multiplier = 1.0 (baseline frequency)
        *   Entropy >= Threshold 2: Multiplier = 2.0 (snapshot twice as often)
        *   Threshold values are configurable.
    *   Outputs adjusted snapshot frequency for each partition.

3.  **Snapshot Scheduler:**
    *   Receives adjusted snapshot frequencies from the Adaptive Frequency Manager.
    *   Triggers snapshots for each partition according to its adjusted frequency.
    *   Integrates with the existing change log system.

4.  **Configuration Interface:**
    *   Allows administrators to:
        *   Set baseline snapshot frequency.
        *   Configure entropy thresholds.
        *   Select entropy metric.
        *   Enable/disable adaptive frequency for individual partitions or the entire table.

**III. Pseudocode (Adaptive Frequency Manager):**

```
FUNCTION calculate_adjusted_frequency(partition, entropy_score, baseline_frequency):
  IF entropy_score < low_entropy_threshold:
    adjusted_frequency = baseline_frequency * 0.5
  ELSE IF entropy_score < high_entropy_threshold:
    adjusted_frequency = baseline_frequency
  ELSE:
    adjusted_frequency = baseline_frequency * 2.0
  
  RETURN adjusted_frequency

//Main Loop
FOR EACH partition IN table_partitions:
  entropy_score = calculate_entropy(partition)
  adjusted_frequency = calculate_adjusted_frequency(partition, entropy_score, baseline_frequency)
  update_snapshot_schedule(partition, adjusted_frequency)
```

**IV. Data Structures:**

*   `PartitionMetadata`:
    *   `partition_id`: Unique identifier for the partition.
    *   `baseline_frequency`: Baseline snapshot frequency (in time units).
    *   `current_frequency`: Adjusted snapshot frequency (calculated).
    *   `last_entropy_score`: Most recent entropy score.
    *   `last_snapshot_time`: Timestamp of the last snapshot.

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Entropy Calculation Overhead:** Optimize entropy calculation to minimize performance impact. Consider sampling techniques.
*   **Threshold Tuning:**  Properly tuning the entropy thresholds is crucial for optimal performance and storage utilization. Machine learning could be used to dynamically adjust the thresholds over time.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** Ensure seamless integration with the existing snapshotting and change log infrastructure.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement monitoring to track entropy scores, snapshot frequencies, and storage usage.  Alert administrators if entropy scores are unexpectedly high or low.
