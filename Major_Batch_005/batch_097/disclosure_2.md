## Automated Remediation Orchestration via Predictive Graph Analysis

**Specification:**

This system extends the core graph reachability analysis described in the provided patent to *automatically remediate* identified security or operational issues. Rather than simply *displaying* results, the system proactively initiates corrective actions based on predicted impact and pre-defined remediation policies.

**Components:**

1.  **Predictive Graph Engine:** Modifies the existing graph reachability analysis engine to incorporate a probabilistic risk scoring model. This model assesses the likelihood and potential impact of exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations identified through graph analysis. Factors include asset criticality, exposure level, and known exploitability.

2.  **Remediation Policy Library:** A central repository of pre-defined remediation actions, categorized by issue type and severity. Actions could include:
    *   Applying security patches
    *   Adjusting firewall rules
    *   Revoking user permissions
    *   Isolating compromised resources
    *   Triggering automated incident response workflows

3.  **Orchestration Engine:** Responsible for selecting and executing remediation actions. It considers:
    *   The predicted risk score
    *   The available remediation options
    *   Pre-defined escalation policies (e.g., requiring human approval for high-impact changes)
    *   Dependencies between resources to ensure changes donâ€™t disrupt critical services.

4.  **Simulation & Rollback Module:** *Before* applying changes, the system simulates the proposed remediation actions on a shadow copy of the ontology model. This allows for validation of the expected outcome and identification of potential unintended consequences.  A rollback mechanism is in place to revert changes if the simulation or live execution reveals issues.

**Workflow:**

1.  The system performs graph reachability analysis as described in the original patent.
2.  The Predictive Graph Engine calculates a risk score for each identified issue.
3.  The Orchestration Engine selects the appropriate remediation action(s) based on the risk score and pre-defined policies.
4.  The Simulation & Rollback Module simulates the remediation.
5.  If the simulation is successful, the Orchestration Engine applies the changes to the live environment.
6.  The system continuously monitors the environment for new issues and adjusts the remediation strategy accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Orchestration Engine - core logic):**

```pseudocode
function orchestrate_remediation(issue, risk_score, ontology_model):
  remediation_options = get_remediation_options(issue)
  best_option = select_best_option(remediation_options, risk_score)

  if best_option == null:
    log("No suitable remediation found for issue.")
    return

  simulation_result = simulate_remediation(ontology_model, best_option)

  if simulation_result == "success":
    apply_remediation(ontology_model, best_option)
    log("Remediation applied successfully.")
  else:
    log("Remediation simulation failed: " + simulation_result)
    escalate_to_human_review(issue, best_option, simulation_result)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Issue`: Contains details about the identified security or operational problem.
*   `RemediationOption`: Describes a potential fix, including steps, dependencies, and rollback procedures.
*   `OntologyModel`: The graph representation of the cloud environment, as defined in the patent.

**Novelty:**

This extension moves beyond simply *identifying* issues to *automatically resolving* them, significantly reducing response times and improving overall security posture. The incorporation of simulation and rollback mechanisms adds a layer of safety, minimizing the risk of unintended consequences.  This system effectively builds a 'self-healing' cloud infrastructure.
