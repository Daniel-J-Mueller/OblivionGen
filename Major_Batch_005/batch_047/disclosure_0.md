## Modular, AI-Driven Predictive Maintenance System for Data Centers

**Core Concept:** Integrate the annunciator system with a localized AI that learns baseline electrical draw and circuit breaker behavior. This system will *predict* failures before they happen, and dynamically adjust annunciator signaling beyond simple 'open/closed' states.

**System Specs:**

*   **Annunciator Module:**
    *   Form Factor: Replace existing annunciators with a circular RGB LED array (approx. 6" diameter) mounted on a magnetically attaching base.
    *   Communication: Wireless mesh network (802.15.4) communicating with a localized AI module.  Each module reports to a central data center management system, but retains functionality if the central system is down.
    *   Signaling:
        *   Standard states: Green (Normal), Red (Open/Fault), Yellow (Warning/Pre-Fault).
        *   Dynamic states: Graduated color scales indicating *probability* of failure (e.g., light blue = 20% chance of breaker tripping in the next hour).
        *   Pulsing/Flashing patterns indicating specific fault types identified by the AI (e.g., overheating, voltage fluctuation).
        *   Ability to display simple textual messages on the LED array (e.g., “Voltage High”).
*   **AI Module (Per Rack or Rack Row):**
    *   Hardware:  Small form factor computer (Intel NUC equivalent) with integrated power monitoring and wireless communication.
    *   Software:
        *   Baseline Learning:  AI algorithms (LSTM recurrent neural networks) to learn normal electrical draw, voltage levels, and circuit breaker behavior for each connected tap box.
        *   Anomaly Detection:  Real-time monitoring of electrical data.  Deviation from baseline triggers alerts and adjusts annunciator signaling.
        *   Predictive Modeling:  AI predicts potential failures based on historical data and current trends.  Annunciator signaling adjusted to reflect probability of failure.
        *   Self-Calibration: AI continuously calibrates its models based on real-world data and feedback from technicians.
        *   Remote Access:  Secure web interface for technicians to view historical data, AI predictions, and configure system parameters.
*   **Power Monitoring Integration:**
    *   Each tap box equipped with current sensors on each circuit breaker output.
    *   Voltage monitoring integrated into the tap box housing.
    *   Data transmitted wirelessly to the localized AI module.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  System initialized: AI learns baseline electrical behavior for each circuit.
2.  Real-time monitoring: AI continuously monitors electrical data.
3.  Anomaly detection:  AI identifies deviations from baseline.
4.  Predictive modeling: AI predicts potential failures based on historical data and current trends.
5.  Annunciator signaling:  Annunciator signaling adjusted to reflect probability of failure.
6.  Technician intervention: Technicians respond to alerts and investigate potential failures.
7.  System learning: System learns from technician feedback and adjusts its models accordingly.

**Pseudocode (AI Module - Anomaly Detection):**

```
function detect_anomaly(current_draw, voltage, baseline_data) {
  // Calculate deviation from baseline
  deviation = abs(current_draw - baseline_data.avg_current_draw) / baseline_data.std_dev_current_draw

  // Check if deviation exceeds threshold
  if (deviation > anomaly_threshold) {
    // Log anomaly event
    log_event("Anomaly detected on circuit X", current_draw, voltage)

    // Trigger alert
    trigger_alert("Possible circuit failure on X")

    return true
  }

  return false
}
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   Integration with thermal sensors to detect overheating.
*   Integration with airflow sensors to detect ventilation problems.
*   Dynamic adjustment of annunciator brightness based on ambient lighting conditions.
*   Predictive maintenance scheduling based on AI predictions.
*   Automated power capping to prevent overloads.
