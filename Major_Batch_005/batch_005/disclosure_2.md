## Dynamic Test Environment Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the ability to configure workers with OS/browser combinations to include *dynamic* environment morphing during test execution.  Instead of static configuration, the system can alter the worker's environment *while* the test is running, simulating various conditions and user setups that would be impossible with static workers.

**Specifications:**

*   **Morphing Agent:** A lightweight agent installed on each worker node. This agent can execute commands to modify the operating system and browser configurations (e.g., change user agent strings, alter network latency, inject simulated hardware limitations, modify browser extensions, change screen resolution, alter timezones).
*   **Morphing Profiles:**  JSON-based profiles defining a sequence of environment changes.  Example:

```json
{
  "profile_name": "Slow_3G_India",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "set_network_latency", "value": "500ms"},
    {"action": "set_user_agent", "value": "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 4.4.2; en-in; SM-G920I Build/KOT49H) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Chrome/36.0.1985.155 Mobile Safari/537.36"},
    {"action": "set_screen_resolution", "width": 360, "height": 640},
    {"action": "set_timezone", "value": "Asia/Kolkata"}
  ]
}
```

*   **Test Script Integration:**  A new keyword/annotation/method within the test framework (e.g., Selenium, TestNG) to trigger a morphing profile.  Example (Python/pytest):

```python
@morph_profile("Slow_3G_India")
def test_website_loads_correctly():
  # Test code here
```

*   **Dynamic Profile Scheduling:** Ability to schedule different morphing profiles for different phases *within* a single test. For example, simulate a fast connection for initial page load, then a slow connection for subsequent asset loading.
*   **Real-time Monitoring & Reporting:**  Monitoring of morphing agent activity and reporting of environmental conditions during test execution.  Include metrics like network latency, CPU usage, and memory consumption.
*   **Worker Isolation:**  Ensure that morphing actions on one worker do not affect other concurrent tests running on the same node (e.g., through containerization or virtualization).
*   **Morphing Orchestration Service:** A service responsible for managing morphing profiles, scheduling, and monitoring. It communicates with the morphing agents on the worker nodes.
*   **Profile Repository:** A centralized repository for storing and managing morphing profiles. Profiles could be user-defined, pre-built, or dynamically generated based on telemetry data.

**Pseudocode (Morphing Orchestration Service):**

```
function execute_test(test_request):
  worker = select_worker()
  test_plan = parse_test_plan(test_request)

  for step in test_plan:
    if step.type == "morph":
      profile = load_profile(step.profile_name)
      send_morph_request(worker, profile)
      wait_for_morph_completion(worker)
    elif step.type == "execute":
      execute_test_code(worker, step.code)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond static environment configuration to a truly dynamic testing environment, allowing for significantly more realistic and comprehensive testing of web applications and other software. It simulates real-world conditions with a high degree of granularity and allows for testing under a wider range of scenarios.
