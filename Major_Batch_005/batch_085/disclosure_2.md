## Temporal Data Sharding with Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the versioning/rollback concept to proactively shard data based on predicted contention or failure rates associated with a partially trusted entity's updates. Instead of waiting for conflicts or needing to rollback entire versions, the system anticipates issues and creates isolated data shards *during* the update process.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contention/Failure Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Update request from partially trusted entity (key, value), entity reputation score, historical update patterns (frequency, key ranges, value characteristics).
*   **Process:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., Bayesian Network, LSTM) trained on past update behavior to predict the probability of contention (conflicts with other updates) or failure (invalid/malicious data) for the incoming update.  Model updates continuously based on observed behavior.
*   **Output:**  Contention/Failure Probability Score (0.0 - 1.0).  Shard Creation Flag (Boolean - True/False based on a configurable threshold probability).

**2. Dynamic Sharding Manager:**

*   **Input:** Shard Creation Flag, key, value.
*   **Process:** 
    *   If Shard Creation Flag is True:
        *   Create a new, isolated data shard identified by a unique shard ID.  This shard is logically associated with the original key-value pair but physically separated in storage.
        *   Store the key-value pair *only* in the newly created shard.
        *   Maintain a mapping table (Shard Map) that maps the key to its corresponding shard ID.
    *   If Shard Creation Flag is False:
        *   Store the key-value pair in the existing primary data store.
*   **Output:** Confirmation of data storage location (Shard ID or Primary Store).

**3. Access Control & Data Retrieval:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Upon data retrieval request (for a specific key):
        *   Check the Shard Map for a corresponding Shard ID.
        *   If a Shard ID exists: Retrieve data from the specified shard.
        *   If no Shard ID exists: Retrieve data from the primary store.
*   **Output:** Retrieved Value.

**4. Predictive Rollback & Merge:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Periodically (or based on event triggers): Re-evaluate the validity of data stored in shards.  Use the same ML model and updated data to assess the probability of shard validity.
    *   If a shard is deemed invalid: Discard the shard’s contents.
    *   If a shard is deemed valid:  Merge the shard’s contents into the primary store.  This merge process should handle potential conflicts and data versioning.
    *   Update the Shard Map to reflect the merge.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Update Process
function updateData(key, value, entity) {
  probability = predictContention(key, value, entity);
  if (probability > threshold) {
    shardID = createShard();
    storeData(shardID, key, value);
    updateShardMap(key, shardID);
  } else {
    storeData(primaryStore, key, value);
  }
}

// Data Retrieval Process
function retrieveData(key) {
  shardID = getShardID(key);
  if (shardID != null) {
    return retrieveDataFromShard(shardID, key);
  } else {
    return retrieveDataFromPrimaryStore(key);
  }
}

//Background Task
function performPredictiveRollback() {
  for each shard in allShards {
    validity = predictShardValidity(shard);
    if (validity == false) {
      deleteShard(shard);
    } else {
      mergeShardIntoPrimaryStore(shard);
      deleteShard(shard);
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shard Map:** Key -> Shard ID (Hash Table/Dictionary)
*   **Shard:** Isolated data store (could be a separate database, file system directory, etc.)
*   **ML Model:** Trained model for contention/validity prediction.
