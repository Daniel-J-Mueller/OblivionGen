## Dynamic Data Contract Evolution & AI-Driven Validation

**Concept:** Extend the data contract system to allow for *dynamic* evolution of contracts, driven by AI monitoring of data access patterns and proactive schema adjustments. This creates a self-optimizing system for data delivery to page generation code, reducing friction and enhancing responsiveness to changing application needs.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component: Contract Evolution Engine (CEE)**: A background service responsible for monitoring data access patterns by page generation code.
*   **Data Source:** Access logs from the system that mediates data delivery (as described in the patent). Logs include the requested predefined variables, data types actually used by the page generation code (inferred, not necessarily declared), and access frequency.
*   **AI Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical access logs. The RNN predicts future data access patterns based on current and past behavior.
*   **Schema Proposal Engine:** Based on the RNN’s predictions, this engine proposes changes to the data contract (adding new predefined variables, changing data types, deprecating unused variables).
*   **Validation & A/B Testing:** Proposed contract changes *must* pass automated validation rules (data type compatibility, mandatory field checks, etc.).  Then, changes are deployed using an A/B testing framework. A small percentage of traffic receives the new contract. Performance metrics (page load time, error rates) are monitored. If the new contract improves performance, it’s rolled out to all traffic.
*   **Developer Notification:** Any proposed contract changes, even those undergoing A/B testing, are communicated to the relevant developers. This allows them to review the changes and provide feedback.

**Pseudocode (CEE Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION analyze_access_logs(logs):
  // logs are a stream of data access events
  access_patterns = extract_features(logs) // e.g., variable access frequency, data type usage
  RETURN access_patterns

FUNCTION predict_future_access(access_patterns):
  // RNN model trained on historical data
  predicted_patterns = RNN_model.predict(access_patterns)
  RETURN predicted_patterns

FUNCTION generate_contract_proposal(predicted_patterns, current_contract):
  proposal = {}
  // Add new variables based on frequently accessed but undefined variables
  FOR variable, access_count IN predicted_patterns.new_variables:
    proposal[variable] = determine_data_type(variable, predicted_patterns)

  // Modify data types based on observed usage
  FOR variable, predicted_type IN predicted_patterns.type_changes:
    IF current_contract[variable].type != predicted_type:
      proposal[variable] = predicted_type

  // Remove unused variables
  FOR variable IN current_contract:
    IF variable NOT IN predicted_patterns.accessed_variables:
      proposal[variable] = "DEPRECATED"

  RETURN proposal

FUNCTION validate_contract_proposal(proposal):
  // Run automated validation rules
  validation_results = run_validation_rules(proposal)
  IF validation_results.is_valid:
    RETURN True
  ELSE:
    RETURN False

FUNCTION deploy_contract_change(proposal):
  // Deploy change to A/B testing framework
  configure_A_B_test(proposal)
  monitor_performance()
  IF performance_improved():
    rollout_to_all_traffic()
```

**Data Contract Evolution Considerations:**

*   **Versioning:** Implement a versioning system for data contracts. This allows for rollback to previous versions if issues arise.
*   **Backward Compatibility:** Strive to maintain backward compatibility whenever possible. Deprecated variables should continue to function for a period of time.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Continuously monitor the health of the data contract system. Alert administrators to any anomalies.
*   **Developer Feedback Loop:**  Provide a mechanism for developers to provide feedback on proposed contract changes.
