## Adaptive Projection Mapping Camera

**Concept:** A camera device incorporating integrated micro-projectors and real-time environmental mapping to project interactive overlays directly onto the scene being captured. This goes beyond simple AR filters; it *changes* the perceived reality within the camera’s field of view.

**Specs:**

*   **Camera Hardware:**
    *   High-resolution (minimum 4K) camera with wide-angle lens (120° field of view).
    *   Depth sensor (LiDAR or structured light) for accurate 3D scene reconstruction.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for stabilization and orientation tracking.
    *   Array of four (minimum) micro-projectors positioned around the camera lens, capable of independent color and brightness adjustment.  Resolution per projector: 1920x1080. Luminosity: 500 Lumens minimum.
    *   Dedicated processing unit (GPU + CPU) for real-time image processing, depth map generation, and projection rendering.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Scene Reconstruction Module:** Processes depth sensor data to create a real-time 3D mesh of the environment.  Algorithm:  SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) variant optimized for dynamic scenes.
    *   **Projection Rendering Engine:** Renders virtual objects and textures onto the 3D mesh. Supports physically based rendering (PBR) for realistic lighting and shadows.  Rendering API: Vulkan.
    *   **Interactive Element Library:**  A curated collection of pre-built interactive elements (e.g., virtual graffiti, animated particles, dynamic lighting effects).  Format: Scriptable objects defining behavior and visual properties.
    *   **User Interface:** A companion mobile app allows users to select, customize, and trigger interactive elements.  Communication: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
    *   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration process to align projection with camera view and compensate for lens distortion.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Static Projection:**  Project persistent virtual objects onto the scene (e.g., a virtual mural on a wall).
    *   **Dynamic Projection:** Project interactive elements that respond to user gestures or environmental changes (e.g., virtual rain that falls only where the user points).
    *   **Environmental Modification:**  Alter the perceived appearance of the environment (e.g., change the color of a wall, add virtual windows).
    *   **Object Replacement:**  Replace real-world objects with virtual counterparts (e.g., replace a chair with a virtual throne).
*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Projection - Gesture Response):**

```
function onGestureDetected(gestureType, gesturePosition):
  if gestureType == "swipe_right":
    spawnVirtualObject(objectType="firework", position=gesturePosition)
  else if gestureType == "pinch_zoom":
    scaleVirtualObject(objectType="particle_cloud", scaleFactor=gestureZoomLevel, position=gestureCenter)
  else if gestureType == "tap":
    triggerAnimation(objectType="virtual_graffiti", animation="pulse", position=gesturePosition)

function spawnVirtualObject(objectType, position):
  // Load 3D model and textures for objectType
  model = loadModel(objectType)
  // Position model at specified coordinates
  model.position = position
  // Add model to scene graph
  scene.addObject(model)

function triggerAnimation(objectType, animation, position):
  // Find virtual object of type objectType at position
  object = findObject(objectType, position)
  // Start animation on object
  object.startAnimation(animation)
```

**Materials:** Lightweight, high-strength polymer housing. Scratch-resistant lens cover. Integrated cooling system for processing unit and projectors.

**Potential Applications:** Entertainment, art installations, education, gaming, augmented reality experiences.
