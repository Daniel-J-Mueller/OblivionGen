## Dynamic Feature Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Extend the feature vector generation process to dynamically adjust feature weights based on real-time feedback during the clustering phase. Instead of static weights assigned during model training, a reinforcement learning (RL) agent learns to modify these weights to optimize cluster separation and accuracy.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Feature Vector Augmentation:** The existing feature vector generation process remains largely intact. However, each feature vector is augmented with a “weight vector” of the same dimensionality. Initially, this weight vector is initialized with equal weights (e.g., 1/n, where n is the number of features).

2.  **RL Agent Integration:** An RL agent (e.g., a Deep Q-Network or Policy Gradient algorithm) is integrated into the clustering pipeline. The agent’s state space comprises:
    *   Cluster centroids (representation of each cluster).
    *   Variance within each cluster (a measure of cluster cohesion).
    *   Inter-cluster distances (measure of separation between clusters).
    *   The current weight vector.

3.  **Action Space:** The agent’s action space consists of adjustments to the weight vector. Actions can be discrete (e.g., increase/decrease weight of a specific feature) or continuous (e.g., a scaling factor applied to the entire weight vector, or targeted adjustments). The magnitude of adjustment is constrained to prevent instability.

4.  **Reward Function:** The reward function is critical. It's designed to encourage effective clustering:
    *   **Positive Reward:** Increased separation between clusters (measured by a distance metric – e.g., Euclidean distance between centroids).
    *   **Positive Reward:** Decreased variance within clusters (measure of cluster cohesion).
    *   **Negative Reward:** Overlap between clusters (penalize overlap).
    *   **Small Penalty:** For large weight adjustments (encourage stability).

5.  **Training/Optimization:** The RL agent is trained concurrently with the clustering process. A batch of electronic images is processed, and the agent learns from the rewards received after each clustering iteration. The agent’s policy is updated to maximize the cumulative reward.  A separate validation set can be used to evaluate the performance and prevent overfitting.

6.  **Integration with Existing Pipeline:** The trained RL agent is integrated into the document processing service. For each new electronic image, the agent dynamically adjusts the feature weights during the clustering phase, optimizing the separation of keys and values.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Initialization
Initialize RL Agent (e.g., DQN)
Initialize Feature Vector Generation Model
Initialize Clustering Algorithm (e.g., K-Means)

# Processing Loop
For each electronic image:
    Generate Feature Vectors (with initial weight vectors)
    For each clustering iteration:
        Observe State (cluster centroids, variance, distances)
        Select Action (adjust weight vector)
        Apply Action to Feature Vectors
        Perform Clustering
        Calculate Reward (based on cluster separation and cohesion)
        Update RL Agent (using reward)

    Output clustered results (keys/values)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Accuracy:** Dynamic weight adjustment can adapt to variations in document layout and content, leading to more accurate key-value separation.
*   **Robustness:** The system becomes more robust to noisy or poorly formatted documents.
*   **Adaptability:** The RL agent can continuously learn and improve its performance over time.
