## Dynamic Certificate Revocation with Bloom Filters & Time-Based Decay

**Concept:** Extend the implicit certificate system with a highly efficient, decentralized revocation mechanism using Bloom filters and time-based decay. This allows for faster detection and mitigation of compromised keys without relying on centralized Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) or Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP), which introduce latency and single points of failure.

**Specs:**

1.  **Revocation Bloom Filter Generation:**
    *   Each Certificate Authority (CA) maintains a Bloom filter.
    *   When a private key is revoked, the corresponding public key (or a hash thereof) is added to the CA's Bloom filter.
    *   Bloom filter parameters (size and number of hash functions) are dynamically adjusted based on the rate of revocation requests and acceptable false positive rates.
2.  **Certificate Embedding of Bloom Filter Digests:**
    *   Each newly issued implicit certificate includes a cryptographic digest (e.g., SHA-256 hash) of the CAâ€™s current Bloom filter. This digest is treated as a version identifier.
3.  **Client-Side Revocation Check:**
    *   Upon receiving an implicit certificate, the client retrieves the embedded Bloom filter digest.
    *   The client maintains a local cache of CA Bloom filter digests. If the received digest differs from the cached digest:
        *   The client requests the *latest* Bloom filter from the CA.
        *   The client checks if the public key of the presented implicit certificate exists within the received Bloom filter.
            *   If the key *is* in the Bloom filter, the certificate is considered revoked.
            *   If the key is *not* in the Bloom filter, the certificate is considered valid (with a small probability of a false positive).
    *   The client updates its local cache with the received Bloom filter digest.
4.  **Time-Based Decay:**
    *   To address the issue of Bloom filters growing indefinitely and to account for the possibility of false positives, implement a time-based decay mechanism.
    *   Each entry added to the Bloom filter is associated with a timestamp.
    *   A background process periodically scans the Bloom filter and removes (or 'decays') entries based on their age. Decay can be implemented by reducing the probability of a given bit being set for older entries, effectively increasing the false positive rate for those entries over time.
5.  **Distributed Bloom Filter Updates (Optional):**
    *   For enhanced scalability and resilience, consider distributing the Bloom filter across multiple servers.
    *   Use a consistent hashing algorithm to distribute keys across servers.
    *   Implement a gossip protocol for propagating Bloom filter updates between servers.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Revocation Check):**

```
function verifyCertificate(certificate):
  cachedDigest = getCachedBloomFilterDigest(certificate.caID)
  receivedDigest = certificate.bloomFilterDigest

  if receivedDigest != cachedDigest:
    latestBloomFilter = requestLatestBloomFilter(certificate.caID)
    storeCachedBloomFilterDigest(certificate.caID, latestBloomFilter.digest)

  if isKeyInBloomFilter(latestBloomFilter, certificate.publicKey):
    return "REVOKED"
  else:
    return "VALID"
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   **Scalability:** Bloom filters offer efficient membership testing with constant-time complexity.
*   **Resilience:** Decentralized Bloom filter updates can mitigate single points of failure.
*   **Reduced Latency:** Avoids the delays associated with CRL/OCSP lookups.
*   **Privacy:** Clients only need to know the CA ID, not a list of revoked certificates.
