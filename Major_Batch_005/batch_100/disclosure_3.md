## Dynamic Network Topology Mapping & Predictive Routing

**Specification:** A system extending the described network directory service to actively map network topology *beyond* simple reachability and predict potential routing disruptions. This moves beyond on-demand access to proactive network health and optimization.

**Components:**

*   **Topology Mapper Agent:** Deployed on edge devices (routers, switches, potentially end-user devices - configurable). Periodically probes the network (ICMP, TCP SYN, etc.) and reports discovered network paths and latency data to a central Topology Database.  Uses a ‘gossip’ protocol – agents share discoveries with neighboring agents, minimizing central database load.
*   **Topology Database:** Stores a dynamic graph of the network topology, including discovered paths, latency, bandwidth estimates, and device health (using passive monitoring of control plane traffic, and active probes).  Graph database preferred (Neo4j, JanusGraph).
*   **Predictive Routing Engine:**  Analyzes the Topology Database to identify potential routing disruptions (link failures, congestion, device outages). Uses time-series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) on latency/bandwidth data to predict future issues.  Employs machine learning (reinforcement learning) to ‘learn’ optimal routing paths based on historical data and predictive models.
*   **Extended Directory Service:**  Modified to incorporate topology information into device access token generation. Tokens now contain not only target device identifiers but also suggested routing paths/policy directives for the client. 
*   **Client-Side Routing Agent:**  Optional component on client devices.  Receives routing information from the access token and utilizes it to influence routing decisions (e.g., through VPN configuration, or direct modification of routing tables - where permissible).

**Pseudocode (Predictive Routing Engine - simplified):**

```
function predict_disruption(topology_graph, device_node, time_horizon):
  historical_data = get_historical_data(device_node, time_horizon)
  if historical_data is empty:
    return None // Not enough data

  // Time-series analysis (example: Exponential Smoothing)
  predicted_latency = exponential_smoothing(historical_data.latency)
  predicted_bandwidth = exponential_smoothing(historical_data.bandwidth)

  if predicted_latency > threshold_latency or predicted_bandwidth < threshold_bandwidth:
    // Potential disruption detected
    alternative_paths = find_alternative_paths(topology_graph, device_node)
    return {
      disruption_risk: "high",
      affected_device: device_node,
      alternative_paths: alternative_paths
    }
  else:
    return None // No disruption predicted
```

**Workflow:**

1.  Topology Mapper Agents continuously update the Topology Database.
2.  Predictive Routing Engine analyzes the Topology Database and identifies potential disruptions.
3.  Extended Directory Service, when generating a device access token, queries the Predictive Routing Engine for the best path to the target device.
4.  The access token includes routing instructions (e.g., IP addresses of intermediate routers, QoS settings, suggested VPN tunnels).
5.  The client (optionally via a Client-Side Routing Agent) uses the routing information to establish a connection to the target device, proactively avoiding potential disruptions.
