## Autonomous Network 'Digital Twin' Generation & Predictive Failure Analysis

**Specification:** A system capable of autonomously constructing and maintaining a ‘digital twin’ of a network, going beyond simple topology mapping to incorporate real-time performance data and predictive failure analysis.

**Core Components:**

*   **Data Acquisition Layer:**  A suite of agents deployed across network devices (routers, switches, servers, fiber endpoints) capable of passively collecting:
    *   Interface statistics (bandwidth utilization, error rates, CRC counts)
    *   Signal strength/optical power levels (with timestamping)
    *   Device resource utilization (CPU, memory, buffer occupancy)
    *   LLDP/CDP neighbor information *and* active path tracing (beyond simple adjacency)
    *   Ambient environmental data (temperature, humidity – via device sensors where available)
*   **Digital Twin Construction Engine:**
    *   **Topology Mapping:**  Automatically discovers and maps network topology from acquired data, resolving discrepancies across multiple sources.  Utilizes a graph database (Neo4j preferred) for efficient representation.
    *   **Performance Modeling:**  Creates performance models for each network segment and device based on historical data.  This involves building time-series datasets and applying statistical/machine learning techniques (ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future performance under various load conditions.
    *   **Dynamic Adaptation:** The digital twin continuously updates itself with real-time data.
*   **Predictive Failure Analysis Module:**
    *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Employs machine learning algorithms (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify anomalies in real-time data streams.  Anomalies trigger further investigation.
    *   **Root Cause Analysis:**  Utilizes graph analysis techniques and correlation analysis to identify potential root causes of anomalies. For example, a sudden increase in error rates on a fiber segment might be correlated with temperature fluctuations or exceeding optical power thresholds.
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Leverages predictive models (based on historical failure data) to estimate the probability of failure for individual network components or segments.
*   **Actionable Insights & Automation:**
    *   **Alerting System:**  Generates alerts based on anomaly detection and predictive modeling. Alerts include detailed information about the potential problem, its location, and recommended actions.
    *   **Automated Remediation (Optional):** Integrates with network management systems to automatically trigger remediation actions (e.g., rerouting traffic, adjusting power levels) based on predefined policies.
    *   **‘What-If’ Scenario Planning:** Allows users to simulate the impact of changes to the network (e.g., adding new devices, increasing traffic load) on performance and reliability.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
FOR each data point in real_time_data_stream:
    Calculate baseline performance metrics (average, standard deviation) over a rolling time window.
    Calculate anomaly score: (data_point - baseline_average) / baseline_standard_deviation
    IF anomaly_score > threshold:
        Trigger anomaly alert
        Initiate root cause analysis
        Update predictive models with new data
    END IF
END FOR
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Time-series database (InfluxDB, Prometheus) for storing real-time performance data.
*   Graph database (Neo4j) for representing network topology and dependencies.
*   Relational database (PostgreSQL) for storing metadata and configuration information.
