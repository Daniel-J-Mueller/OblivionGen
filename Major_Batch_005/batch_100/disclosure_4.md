## Dynamic Cellular Network "Blending"

**Concept:** Leverage the described system information sharing to dynamically blend connections across multiple cellular networks *simultaneously*, optimizing for bandwidth, latency, and cost. Current systems typically select *one* network. This proposes intelligent, real-time partitioning of data streams.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-SIM capable device (minimum 2 SIM slots, ideally 3+)
    *   Enhanced RF front-end capable of simultaneous transmission/reception across multiple frequency bands.
    *   Dedicated co-processor for real-time packet routing and Quality of Service (QoS) management.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Network Information Aggregator:** Collects cellular system information (as described in the patent) from nearby devices *and* directly from each available network.  Prioritizes information based on source reliability (e.g., direct measurements > broadcast from peer > historical data).
    *   **Data Stream Classifier:** Analyzes outgoing data streams and categorizes them based on QoS requirements (latency-sensitive, bandwidth-intensive, background, etc.). Uses machine learning to adapt classification over time.
    *   **Dynamic Packet Router:** Based on stream classification and network performance data, dynamically routes packets across available networks.  Supports fragmentation and reassembly of packets when necessary.
    *   **Cost/Performance Optimizer:** Considers data costs associated with each network and balances performance with cost. Allows user-defined preferences (e.g., prioritize performance at any cost, minimize data costs).
    *   **Network Blending Algorithm:** (Pseudocode)

```
function blendNetworks(dataPacket, networkInfo) {
  streamType = classifyStream(dataPacket.payload);
  bestNetworks = selectNetworks(streamType, networkInfo);

  if (bestNetworks.length == 1) {
    sendPacket(dataPacket, bestNetworks[0]);
  } else if (bestNetworks.length > 1) {
    // Split packet (if necessary)
    packetFragments = splitPacket(dataPacket);

    // Distribute fragments across networks (weighted based on performance)
    for (fragment in packetFragments) {
      network = selectNetworkForFragment(fragment, bestNetworks);
      sendPacket(fragment, network);
    }
  } else {
    // No suitable network found
    // Queue packet for retry
  }
}

function selectNetworkForFragment(fragment, networks) {
    // Weighted random selection based on latency, bandwidth, cost
    // Higher weight for networks that best meet fragment requirements
    // Implement some sort of heuristic
    return weightedRandomSelection(networks);
}
```

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Real-time display of network performance metrics (latency, bandwidth, signal strength, cost).
    *   Configuration options for network blending preferences (e.g., priority of cost vs. performance).
    *   Data usage statistics per network.

**Novelty:** Existing systems primarily focus on network *selection*, not simultaneous *blending*. This concept leverages the detailed network information shared in the patent to dynamically optimize data flow across multiple networks, potentially providing significant improvements in performance, cost, and reliability.
