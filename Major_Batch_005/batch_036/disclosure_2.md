## Dynamic Graph Personalization via Embodied Agent Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the graph-based semantic analysis to incorporate real-time feedback and preference learning through simulated "embodied agents" navigating a digital environment representing item space. The system learns user preferences not through direct ratings or searches, but by observing agent behavior and inferring intent.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Agent Framework:** Develop a multi-agent system where each agent embodies a simulated user with distinct (initially randomized) preferences. Agents navigate a virtual environment comprised of nodes representing items (as in the original patent). Edges represent semantic relationships.
*   **Action Space:** Agents have a defined action space:
    *   **Explore:** Randomly traverse edges to discover new items.
    *   **Dwell:** Spend virtual "time" at a node, indicating interest. Dwell time is weighted.
    *   **Recommend (to Self):** An agent can virtually "recommend" an item to its own profile, influencing its internal preference model.
*   **Preference Model:** Each agent maintains a preference model represented as a vector of tag weights.  Initial weights are random. Dwell time and recommendation actions update these weights.
*   **Graph Dynamics:** The graph itself is dynamic. Edge weights change based on agent interaction:
    *   **Positive Reinforcement:** If multiple agents dwell at nodes connected by an edge, the edge weight increases.
    *   **Negative Reinforcement:** If agents consistently avoid traversing a particular edge, the edge weight decreases.
*   **User Profile Creation:** A real user's profile is seeded with a population of agents. Agents are allowed to interact with the virtual environment, and their combined behavior is used to build the user's initial preference model.
*   **Recommendation Engine:** Recommendations are generated by simulating agent behavior within the personalized graph. The most frequently visited items by the agent population are recommended to the user.
*   **Real-time Adaptation:**  As the user interacts with recommendations, their influence is fed back into the agent population, adjusting agent behavior and refining the personalized graph.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Generation):**

```
function generate_recommendations(user_profile, graph, num_recommendations):
  agent_population = user_profile.get_agent_population()
  simulation_steps = 1000 

  for step in range(simulation_steps):
    for agent in agent_population:
      current_node = agent.get_current_node()
      neighbors = graph.get_neighbors(current_node)
      
      # Weighted random selection of next node based on edge weights
      next_node = weighted_random_choice(neighbors, graph.get_edge_weights(current_node)) 
      agent.move_to(next_node)
      
      # Update dwell time at the new node
      agent.increase_dwell_time()
      
  # Aggregate dwell times for each item
  item_dwell_times = {}
  for agent in agent_population:
    item = agent.get_current_node()
    if item not in item_dwell_times:
      item_dwell_times[item] = 0
    item_dwell_times[item] += agent.get_dwell_time()
    
  # Sort items by dwell time and return top N recommendations
  sorted_items = sorted(item_dwell_times.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
  recommendations = [item[0] for item in sorted_items[:num_recommendations]]
  
  return recommendations
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Integrate other data sources (e.g., user browsing history, social media activity) to inform agent behavior.
*   **Explainable Recommendations:**  Trace agent pathways to provide explanations for why a particular item was recommended.
*   **Adversarial Training:**  Train the agent population to compete with each other, leading to more diverse and accurate recommendations.
