## Adaptive Log Granularity & Predictive Coalesce

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on coalescing logs *after* a threshold is met. This builds on that by introducing *dynamic* log granularity – recording changes at varying levels of detail based on predicted access patterns – and proactively coalescing logs *before* they reach a fixed threshold, minimizing latency and maximizing space efficiency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Access Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical access patterns (read/write frequency, data type, time of day, user/application), real-time access monitoring.
*   **Process:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, time series forecasting) to predict future access probabilities for each data page.  This model is continuously retrained with incoming access data.
*   **Output:**  "Granularity Score" (0.0 - 1.0) per data page.  Higher scores indicate higher predicted access frequency.

**2. Dynamic Log Granularity Engine:**

*   **Input:** Granularity Score, incoming write requests.
*   **Process:**
    *   If Granularity Score > Threshold_High (e.g., 0.8): Record *differential* changes at the byte level.  (Minimize log size but increase compute for applying.)
    *   If Threshold_Low < Granularity Score < Threshold_High (e.g., 0.2 < score < 0.8): Record changes at the block level (e.g., 4KB).
    *   If Granularity Score < Threshold_Low (e.g., 0.2): Record changes at the page level.
*   **Output:** Log records with metadata indicating the granularity level.

**3. Predictive Coalesce Scheduler:**

*   **Input:** Log records (with granularity metadata), system memory usage, predicted access patterns.
*   **Process:**
    *   Monitor log growth for each data page.
    *   Employ a cost model that balances:
        *   The cost of coalescing (CPU, I/O).
        *   The cost of maintaining in-memory logs.
        *   The predicted latency impact of coalescing on read requests (based on access patterns).
    *   If the cost model predicts a net benefit, proactively initiate a coalesce operation *before* a fixed version threshold is reached.
    *   Prioritize coalesce operations based on predicted impact (e.g., coalesce pages with high read frequency first).
*   **Output:** Coalesce operation requests.

**4.  Data Structures:**

*   **Page Access History:**  Time-stamped record of all read/write accesses to each data page.
*   **Granularity Score Table:** Map of data pages to their current Granularity Score.
*   **Log Metadata:** Each log record includes a “Granularity Level” field.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Coalesce Scheduler):**

```
function scheduleCoalesce(pageID) {
  logCount = getLogCount(pageID)
  predictedAccess = getPredictedAccess(pageID)
  coalesceCost = calculateCoalesceCost(pageID)
  memoryCost = calculateMemoryCost(pageID)

  if (coalesceCost + memoryCost < threshold) {
    initiateCoalesce(pageID)
  }
}

// Run periodically for each data page
for each page in dataPages {
  scheduleCoalesce(page.id)
}
```

**Novelty:**  This shifts from a *reactive* to a *proactive* log management system, optimizing for both space and latency based on predicted access patterns. Dynamic log granularity further reduces storage overhead while adapting to varying data access requirements.  The cost model allows for intelligent scheduling of coalesce operations, avoiding unnecessary overhead.
