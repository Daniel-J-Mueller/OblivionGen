**Dynamic Scene Reconstruction via Multi-Exposure Light Field Capture & AI-Driven Volumetric Rendering**

**Concept:** Expanding on delayed processing of multi-exposure images, this system aims to move beyond 2D HDR imagery into full 3D scene reconstruction, facilitating interactive exploration and manipulation of the captured environment.

**Specifications:**

*   **Capture System:**
    *   Array of synchronized cameras with varying apertures (mimicking bracketed exposures) arranged in a light field configuration. Minimum 9x9 array recommended, expandable to 16x16 for higher resolution.
    *   Cameras must support global shutter operation to eliminate rolling shutter artifacts.
    *   Integrated IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for precise pose estimation during capture.
    *   System designed for both static and dynamic scenes â€“ target capture frequency of 30-60Hz for dynamic scenes.
*   **Data Storage:**
    *   High-speed, onboard storage (minimum 1TB SSD) to buffer multi-exposure light field data.
    *   Support for real-time streaming to external storage/processing unit via high-bandwidth interface (e.g., Thunderbolt 4).
*   **Delayed Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Stage 1: Raw Data Acquisition & Pre-Processing:**
        *   Captured light field data is stored.
        *   Raw data is calibrated based on camera parameters and IMU data.
        *   Noise reduction and outlier removal are applied.
    *   **Stage 2: Depth Map Estimation:**
        *   AI-powered depth map estimation algorithm (based on neural radiance fields - NeRF) utilizes the multi-exposure light field data to generate a dense depth map of the scene.
        *   Algorithm incorporates learned priors for improved accuracy and robustness.
    *   **Stage 3: Volumetric Rendering:**
        *   Depth map and color information are used to construct a volumetric representation of the scene.
        *   Volumetric rendering algorithm generates photorealistic images from any viewpoint.
        *   Supports real-time rendering at interactive frame rates (minimum 30fps).
    *   **Stage 4: AI-Driven Enhancement:**
        *   AI algorithms are used to enhance the quality of the rendered images.
        *   Tasks include: super-resolution, denoising, color correction, and style transfer.
*   **Processing Unit:**
    *   High-performance GPU (minimum NVIDIA RTX 4090) with sufficient VRAM (minimum 24GB) to handle volumetric rendering and AI processing.
    *   Multi-core CPU (minimum Intel Core i9) for data pre-processing and scene management.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Interactive 3D viewport for exploring the reconstructed scene.
    *   Tools for adjusting rendering parameters (e.g., exposure, contrast, color balance).
    *   Ability to export the reconstructed scene in standard 3D formats (e.g., glTF, OBJ).
*   **Pseudocode (Depth Map Estimation):**
    ```
    function estimateDepthMap(lightFieldData):
        // Load multi-exposure light field data
        // Apply calibration and pre-processing
        // Use AI model to predict depth for each pixel
        // Refine depth map using multi-view stereo techniques
        return depthMap
    ```
* **System Operation:** Capture occurs during normal operation. Processing is delayed, initiated when device is stationary and plugged in. User can also trigger processing.
