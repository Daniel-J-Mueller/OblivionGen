## Adaptive Content Chunks with Predictive Pre-fetch

**Concept:** Extend the caching idea to operate not on whole files or pages, but on dynamically defined *content chunks* within those files/pages, with predictive pre-fetching based on user behavior and content relationships. This moves beyond simply caching shared *portions* to proactively anticipating *which* portions will be needed next.

**Specifications:**

**1. Content Chunk Definition & Metadata:**

*   **Chunking Algorithm:** Implement a dynamic chunking algorithm that analyzes content (text, images, code, etc.) and divides it into semantically meaningful chunks.  This isn’t fixed-size; chunk boundaries are determined by content structure (headings, paragraphs, code blocks, image groupings).
*   **Metadata Tagging:** Each chunk is tagged with rich metadata:
    *   **Content Type:** (text, image, code, video, audio)
    *   **Semantic Category:** (e.g., “product description”, “navigation menu”, “error message”) – utilize an ontology for consistent categorization.
    *   **Dependencies:** Links to other chunks this chunk relies on (e.g., image source, linked data).
    *   **Popularity Score:**  Tracks how frequently a chunk is requested (decaying over time).
    *   **Recency Score:** Tracks how recently a chunk was requested.
    *   **Predictive Affinity:**  A score indicating the probability this chunk will be requested *after* another specific chunk (or set of chunks).  This is learned via user session analysis.

**2. Client-Side Chunk Request & Storage:**

*   **Initial Page Load:** When a page loads, the client requests the primary chunks needed for initial rendering.
*   **Chunk Manifest:** The server returns a "Chunk Manifest" alongside the initial content. This manifest details *all* available chunks within the page, their metadata, and their current cache status on the client.
*   **Client Cache:**  The client maintains a cache of downloaded chunks, indexed by a unique chunk identifier.
*   **Dynamic Chunk Requests:** As the user interacts with the page (scrolls, clicks, hovers), the client analyzes the user’s behavior and uses the Predictive Affinity data to identify likely-needed chunks *before* they are explicitly requested. These chunks are then requested asynchronously.

**3. Server-Side Chunk Delivery & Management:**

*   **Chunk Repository:** A dedicated repository stores all chunks, indexed by their unique identifiers.
*   **Chunk Versioning:** Implement versioning to allow for content updates without invalidating the client cache unnecessarily.
*   **Adaptive Chunk Size:** Dynamically adjust the chunk size based on network conditions and client capabilities.  Smaller chunks for slower connections, larger chunks for faster connections.
*    **Delta Updates:** For versioned chunks, deliver only the *changes* (deltas) to the client, minimizing bandwidth usage.

**4. Predictive Prefetch Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function predictNextChunks(userSession, currentChunks, chunkManifest):
  // 1. Identify recently accessed chunks in the user's session.
  recentChunks = getRecentChunks(userSession, timeWindow=5 seconds)

  // 2. For each recent chunk, find chunks with high Predictive Affinity.
  candidateChunks = []
  for chunk in recentChunks:
    affinityScores = getAffinityScores(chunk, chunkManifest)
    sortedAffinity = sortAffinityScores(affinityScores, descending=True)
    candidateChunks.extend(sortedAffinity[:5]) // Top 5 candidates

  // 3. Filter out chunks already in the client cache.
  filteredChunks = [chunk for chunk in candidateChunks if not isChunkCached(chunk)]

  // 4. Sort remaining chunks by a combined score (Popularity + Affinity).
  sortedChunks = sortChunks(filteredChunks, by="combinedScore")

  return sortedChunks[:3] // Prefetch top 3 candidates
```

**5.  Integration with Content Delivery Network (CDN):**

*   Cache chunks at CDN edge nodes to further reduce latency.
*   CDN aware chunk invalidation – automatically invalidate CDN caches when content is updated.
