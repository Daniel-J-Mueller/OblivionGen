## Autonomous Multi-Agent Swarm for Facility Mapping & Dynamic Object Tagging

**System Overview:** A distributed system leveraging low-cost, autonomous aerial vehicles (drones) equipped with lightweight sensors to create and maintain a dynamic, real-time map of a facility and tag objects within it *without* reliance on pre-existing blueprints or infrastructure. This expands on the object tracking concept by proactively building a digital twin of the facility and dynamically associating objects with it.

**Hardware Components (per drone):**

*   **Micro-Lidar:**  Short-range lidar for local environment mapping and obstacle avoidance.
*   **Wide-Angle Camera:** High-resolution camera with optical flow for visual odometry and object detection.
*   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):**  For drone stabilization and pose estimation.
*   **Low-Power Edge Compute Unit:** For onboard processing of sensor data (object detection, SLAM).
*   **Bluetooth/UWB Beacon:**  For localized positioning refinement and inter-drone communication.
*   **RFID/NFC Reader/Writer:** To tag/read physical tags attached to objects. (Optional, for persistent ID).
*   **Battery & Propulsion System:** Lightweight design for extended flight time.

**Software Components:**

*   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) Algorithm:** Robust SLAM algorithm optimized for indoor environments, utilizing lidar and visual odometry.  Key modification: dynamically fuse maps from multiple drones in real-time.
*   **Object Detection & Classification Model:** Deep learning model trained to identify and classify objects within the facility (e.g., totes, pallets, personnel).
*   **Swarm Coordination Algorithm:** Decentralized algorithm governing drone movement and task allocation.  Utilizes a behavior-based approach, with drones responding to local conditions and coordinating through limited communication.
*   **Dynamic Object Tagging System:** System responsible for associating detected objects with unique identifiers and maintaining a real-time object database.
*   **Facility Map Database:** Stores the dynamically generated 3D map of the facility, along with object locations and identifiers.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** A swarm of drones is released into the facility.  No prior map data is required.
2.  **Exploration & Mapping:** Drones autonomously explore the facility, building a local map using SLAM. Drones employ coverage path planning, dynamically adjusting to obstacles and previously mapped areas.
3.  **Object Detection & Tagging:**  As drones navigate, they detect objects using the object detection model.  
    *   If an object has a physical tag (RFID/NFC), the drone reads the tag and associates it with the objectâ€™s visual representation.
    *   If an object does *not* have a tag, the drone assigns a temporary visual identifier and broadcasts it to other drones. Upon enough detections, this temporary identifier is upgraded to a persistent ID.
4.  **Map Fusion & Optimization:** Drones share local map data with nearby drones, fusing the data into a global map. Map optimization algorithms refine the map, reducing errors and improving accuracy.
5.  **Real-time Tracking & Updates:** The system continuously tracks object locations and updates the map as objects move. The system provides a real-time view of the facility, with all objects tagged and identified.
6.  **User Interface:** A web-based user interface allows users to view the facility map, track object locations, and manage the drone swarm.

**Pseudocode - Swarm Coordination:**

```
Drone.senseEnvironment()
Drone.detectObstacles()
Drone.detectObjects()

If (Drone.areaUnexplored()):
    Drone.exploreArea()
Else:
    Drone.trackObjects()
    Drone.updateMap()

If (Drone.batteryLow()):
    Drone.returnToDock()

Broadcast (Drone.location, Drone.mapData, Drone.objectData)
Receive (nearbyDroneData)
Merge (nearbyDroneData, Drone.mapData, Drone.objectData)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple object tracking to create a fully dynamic, self-maintaining digital twin of the facility. The decentralized swarm architecture eliminates the need for centralized infrastructure or pre-existing maps, making it adaptable to changing environments. The integration of physical tagging with visual identification provides robust and reliable object tracking.
