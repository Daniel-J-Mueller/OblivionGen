## Dynamic Front Light ‘Pulse’ for Enhanced E-Paper Readability & User Biofeedback

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple brightness adjustments during page turns. Utilize the front light as a subtle biofeedback mechanism *and* as a tool for dynamically enhancing perceived contrast *beyond* what's achievable with static brightness settings. This relies on subtly modulating the front light frequency (creating a “pulse”) in sync with eye saccades and potentially, physiological data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **E-Paper Display:** Standard e-paper display module.
*   **Front Light:** High-frequency controllable front light (LED or similar) capable of operating at > 200 Hz.  Crucially, the controller needs precise, programmable duty cycle control.
*   **Eye-Tracking Module:** Low-power, integrated eye-tracking camera or sensor (e.g., infrared-based) to detect saccadic eye movements. Positioned unobtrusively near the display. Resolution: sufficient to determine saccade initiation and direction.
*   **Optional: Physiological Sensor:** Heart rate variability (HRV) sensor (photoplethysmography or ECG) integrated into the device housing.
*   **Processing Unit:** Low-power microcontroller or SoC capable of real-time processing of eye-tracking and optional physiological data.  Must support PWM signal generation for front light control.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Software routine for individual user calibration of eye-tracking and physiological baselines.

**2. Software & Algorithm Specifications:**

*   **Saccade Detection:** Algorithm to reliably detect and characterize saccadic eye movements.  Parameters: Saccade velocity threshold, amplitude threshold, duration threshold.
*   **Pulse Synchronization:**  Software module to synchronize front light pulses with detected saccades. Pulse duration: 1-10 ms. Pulse frequency: Variable, based on saccade frequency.
*   **Contrast Enhancement Algorithm:**
    *   Determine areas of high contrast change on the displayed content.
    *   Briefly *increase* the front light pulse amplitude during saccades that *scan* these high-contrast areas.
    *   This creates a transient "pop" of brightness, enhancing perceived contrast and reducing visual fatigue.
*   **Biofeedback Integration (Optional):**
    *   Analyze HRV data to assess user cognitive load and stress levels.
    *   Adjust the front light pulse frequency and amplitude to subtly influence user arousal levels.  (e.g., slower, lower amplitude pulses for relaxation, faster, higher amplitude pulses for alertness).
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to adjust the sensitivity of the saccade detection, the amplitude and frequency of the front light pulse, and the level of biofeedback integration.
*   **Power Management:**  Optimize the algorithm for minimal power consumption.



**3. Operational Modes:**

*   **Standard Reading Mode:**  Front light adjusts brightness based on ambient light and user preference. Saccade-synchronized pulses active.
*   **High-Contrast Mode:**  Algorithm prioritizes contrast enhancement, increasing pulse amplitude during saccades.  Suitable for viewing complex diagrams or charts.
*   **Relaxation Mode:**  Algorithm uses slow, low-amplitude pulses and biofeedback integration to promote relaxation.
*   **Alertness Mode:** Algorithm utilizes faster, higher amplitude pulses and biofeedback integration to promote alertness.




**Pseudocode (Simplified Pulse Control):**

```
// Main Loop

while (true) {

    // Get Eye Tracking Data
    saccadeDetected = eyeTracking.detectSaccade();

    if (saccadeDetected) {

        // Calculate Pulse Amplitude based on content contrast & user settings
        pulseAmplitude = calculatePulseAmplitude();

        // Generate PWM signal for front light
        frontLight.setPulse(pulseAmplitude);

    } else {

        // Maintain steady-state brightness
        frontLight.setBrightness(steadyStateBrightness);
    }

    // Process Physiological Data (Optional)
    if (physiologicalSensor.dataAvailable()) {
        // Adjust pulse parameters based on HRV data
        adjustPulseParameters(physiologicalSensor.getData());
    }
}
```

This system leverages the front light not simply as an illumination source, but as a dynamic visual and potentially physiological modulator, enhancing readability and potentially providing subtle biofeedback cues to the user.
