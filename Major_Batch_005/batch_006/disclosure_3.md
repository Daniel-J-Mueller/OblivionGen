## Dynamic Airflow Deceleration System

**Concept:** Integrate targeted airflow with the elastic deceleration system to provide a multi-faceted approach to package cushioning. Rather than *solely* relying on elastic member displacement, utilize controlled bursts of air to further reduce impact velocity and stabilize packages during descent.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Frame Integration:** Existing frame design remains largely intact. Add a plenum chamber integrated *within* the frame's sidewall. This chamber will house small, high-velocity air jets.
*   **Air Jet Array:** Array of individually controllable air jets positioned around the perimeter of the plenum chamber, directed downwards towards the anticipated package drop zone. Jet count: Minimum 12, evenly spaced.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Proximity Sensor:** Detects package entry into the bulk box area. Triggers the initial activation of the system.
    *   **Velocity Sensor (Doppler Radar or Time-of-Flight):** Measures the downward velocity of the approaching package.
    *   **Weight Sensor (Load Cell):** Estimates package weight to calibrate airflow intensity.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Microcontroller:** (e.g., ESP32, Arduino Mega) responsible for processing sensor data and controlling air jet activation.
    *   **PWM Control:** Pulse Width Modulation used to regulate airflow intensity of each air jet.
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  Package detected by proximity sensor.
        2.  Velocity sensor estimates package velocity.
        3.  Weight sensor estimates package weight.
        4.  Microcontroller calculates optimal airflow intensity for each jet based on velocity and weight.
        5.  Air jets activate *prior* to package impact with the existing interference mechanism. Airflow directed *against* the downward momentum of the package.
        6.  Existing elastic members provide secondary cushioning as the package continues its descent.
        7.  System deactivates briefly after package passes through the deceleration zone to allow for reset and subsequent package handling.
*   **Air Supply:**
    *   Compact, low-noise air compressor (integrated into the base of the bulk box or located nearby).
    *   Air reservoir to ensure consistent airflow.
    *   Filter to remove dust and debris from the air supply.
*   **Elastic Member Integration:** Existing elastic members remain functional, acting as a secondary safety net and providing additional stability.
*   **Power Requirements:** 12V DC, minimal power consumption during standby.

**Pseudocode for Control Algorithm:**

```
//Initialization
set ProximitySensorPin to Digital Input
set VelocitySensorPin to Analog Input
set WeightSensorPin to Analog Input
set AirJetControlPins[12] to Digital Output

//Main Loop
while(true)
  if (ProximitySensorPin == HIGH) //Package Detected
    Velocity = readAnalog(VelocitySensorPin)
    Weight = readAnalog(WeightSensorPin)

    //Calculate Airflow Intensity (simplified example)
    AirflowIntensity = (Velocity * 0.01) - (Weight * 0.005)
    if (AirflowIntensity > 100)
      AirflowIntensity = 100
    if (AirflowIntensity < 0)
      AirflowIntensity = 0

    //Activate Air Jets
    for (i = 0 to 11)
      setDigitalOutput(AirJetControlPins[i], AirflowIntensity)
    end for

    delay(500) //Brief delay to allow airflow to decelerate package
    //Deactivate Air Jets
    for (i = 0 to 11)
      setDigitalOutput(AirJetControlPins[i], 0)
    end for
  end if
end while
```
