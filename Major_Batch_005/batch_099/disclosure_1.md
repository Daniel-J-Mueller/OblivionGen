## Dynamic Content 'Provenance' & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend user contribution scoring to incorporate a ‘provenance’ layer – tracking not just *who* created content, but *how* it was created and its subsequent modifications. This builds a trust score independent of simple ranking, focusing on content authenticity and collaborative refinement.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure: ‘Content Provenance Graph’ (CPG)**. Each content piece is a node. Edges represent:
    *   **Creation:** Author User -> Content (timestamped).
    *   **Modification:** User -> Content (timestamped, delta/diff of changes).
    *   **Verification:** User -> Content (timestamped, type of verification – e.g., factual check, stylistic edit).  Verification includes a ‘confidence score’ (0-1) for the verification.
    *   **Attribution:** Content -> Source Material (URL, DOI, etc.).
*   **Provenance Score Calculation:**
    1.  **Base Authenticity:** Initial score based on author's contribution score (from the existing patent).
    2.  **Modification Penalty:** Each modification *reduces* the authenticity score (unless verified). Magnitude of reduction scales with the extent of the change.
    3.  **Verification Boost:** Verified modifications *increase* the authenticity score, weighted by the verifier’s contribution score *and* the verification confidence score.
    4.  **Attribution Bonus:** If source material is reliably attributed (and accessible), a small bonus is applied.
    5.  **Decay Factor:** Authenticity decays over time.
    *Formula:* Authenticity = Base + Σ(ModificationImpact) + Σ(VerificationImpact) + AttributionBonus – TimeDecay.
*   **System Components:**
    *   **Provenance Tracker:** Monitors content creation and modification events. Records all actions in the CPG.
    *   **Verification Queue:** System highlights content needing verification, prioritizing based on modification frequency/extent and author’s contribution score.
    *   **Automated Verification Module:**  Uses external APIs (fact-checking services, plagiarism detectors) to perform basic verification.
    *   **Trust Score API:** Provides access to content’s Authenticity score.

**Pseudocode (Trust Score API):**

```
function get_content_trust_score(content_id):
    content_provenance_graph = get_graph_from_db(content_id)
    base_authenticity = content_provenance_graph.author.contribution_score
    modification_impact = calculate_modification_impact(content_provenance_graph)
    verification_impact = calculate_verification_impact(content_provenance_graph)
    attribution_bonus = calculate_attribution_bonus(content_provenance_graph)
    time_decay = calculate_time_decay(content_provenance_graph)
    authenticity = base_authenticity + modification_impact + verification_impact + attribution_bonus – time_decay

    return authenticity
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced content filtering.
*   Reputation management for authors.
*   ‘Provenance’ badges displayed alongside content.
*   Incentivizing collaborative content refinement.
*   Identifying and flagging potentially misleading or fabricated content.
