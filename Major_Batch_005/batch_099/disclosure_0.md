## Modular, Bio-Integrated Container System

**Concept:** A container system that moves beyond static holding and integrates with the items *within* it, facilitating growth, preservation, or even symbiotic interaction. Focuses on customizable, bio-reactive internal modules.

**Specs:**

*   **Container Base:** Constructed from a transparent, durable bio-plastic (PLA reinforced with mycelium for added strength and biodegradability). Dimensions variable, base unit 20cm x 20cm x 15cm.  Modular stacking capability via magnetic, interlocking system.
*   **Module Types:** Interchangeable modules inserted into the base container. Module size: 5cm x 5cm x 5cm (cubes).  Connectivity: Each module contains embedded micro-connectors for fluid/gas exchange and low-voltage power.
*   **Module 1: Seed/Sprout Module:** Contains a pre-seeded growth medium (hydrogel or similar) and integrated LED lighting (red/blue spectrum) controlled via a small microcontroller.  Environmental sensors (humidity, temperature) feed data to the controller, optimizing growth conditions.  Targeted for small plant starts, mushroom cultivation.  Output: Small, contained plant or fungal growth *within* the container.
*   **Module 2:  Preservation Module:**  Utilizes a desiccant-gel matrix and controlled-atmosphere gas release (nitrogen, argon).  Ideal for preserving delicate items (flowers, herbs, small artifacts).  Integrated humidity sensors regulate gas release.
*   **Module 3:  Symbiotic Bio-Reactor:**  Contains a carefully cultivated microbiome (bacteria, yeast).  Designed to interact with items placed within, altering their properties (e.g., fermenting food, accelerating composting).  Fluid exchange system allows for nutrient cycling. Requires periodic "feeding" via external port.
*   **Module 4:  Data Logging Module:**  Contains a small temperature/humidity/light sensor logging to onboard flash memory.  Can be docked to external reading device for data retrieval.  Useful for monitoring item conditions over time.
*   **Base Unit Features:**
    *   Transparent walls for visibility.
    *   Waterproof/Airtight seal.
    *   Magnetic base for attachment to metallic surfaces.
    *   Small fan for internal air circulation (optional).
    *   Wireless charging capability for modules.

**Pseudocode (Module Control):**

```
// Module Initialization
function initializeModule(moduleType) {
  if (moduleType == "Seed/Sprout") {
    activateLEDs();
    startSensorMonitoring();
  } else if (moduleType == "Preservation") {
    activateGasRelease();
    startHumidityMonitoring();
  } else if (moduleType == "Symbiotic") {
    activateFluidExchange();
  }
}

// Sensor Monitoring Loop
while (true) {
  temperature = readTemperatureSensor();
  humidity = readHumiditySensor();
  lightLevel = readLightSensor();

  if (moduleType == "Seed/Sprout") {
    adjustLEDIntensity(temperature, humidity, lightLevel);
  } else if (moduleType == "Preservation") {
    adjustGasReleaseRate(humidity);
  }

  delay(60 seconds); // Adjust sampling frequency
}
```
