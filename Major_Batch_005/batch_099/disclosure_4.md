## Dynamic Content Encoding Profiles Based on User Emotional Response

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust video encoding profiles – resolution, bitrate, codec settings – not solely based on bandwidth availability, but also on real-time inferred emotional response of the viewing user. This builds on the patent's bandwidth management by adding a layer of *perceived* quality, aiming for subjective optimization, not just technical efficiency.

**Components:**

1.  **Emotional Inference Engine (EIE):**
    *   Input: Real-time video stream of user’s facial expressions (via webcam or mobile device camera) *and* audio input (detecting tone, pitch, speech patterns).
    *   Processing: Employs a pre-trained deep learning model (Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network combination) to classify user’s emotional state (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral, boredom). Outputs a confidence score for each emotion.
    *   Output: A weighted emotional vector representing the user’s current emotional state.

2.  **Encoding Profile Mapping Service (EPMS):**
    *   Input: Emotional vector from EIE *and* current bandwidth availability data (from the original patent’s management service).
    *   Processing: Utilizes a lookup table or a trained model (e.g., a decision tree or neural network) to map the emotional state to an optimal encoding profile.  The profile includes:
        *   Resolution (e.g., 360p, 720p, 1080p, 4K)
        *   Bitrate (kbps)
        *   Codec (H.264, H.265/HEVC, AV1)
        *   Framerate (fps)
        *   Motion Estimation Settings (complexity/speed trade-off)
    *   Logic:
        *   High positive emotions (joy, excitement): Prioritize higher resolution, bitrate, and framerate for immersive experience.
        *   Negative emotions (sadness, anger): May *decrease* resolution/bitrate. The rationale is that high visual fidelity could exacerbate negative emotional responses. Alternatively, could subtly increase saturation or contrast to attempt mood modulation (A/B testing required).
        *   Neutral/boredom: Maintain a baseline profile with efficient compression.
        *   Fast-Paced Action: Increase framerate and motion estimation complexity for smoother playback.
        *   Slow-Paced Content: Reduce framerate and motion estimation to conserve bandwidth.
    *   Output: Selected encoding profile.

3.  **Bandwidth Manager Integration:**
    *   The selected encoding profile is passed to the original patent’s bandwidth management service.
    *   The bandwidth manager adjusts the encoding parameters of the video stream *before* transmission to the user.
    *   The bandwidth manager also ensures that the selected profile does not exceed available bandwidth, potentially negotiating a slightly lower profile if necessary.

**Pseudocode (EPMS):**

```
function select_encoding_profile(emotional_vector, bandwidth_available):
  # Emotional Weightings (tunable parameters)
  joy_weight = 0.8
  sadness_weight = 0.2
  anger_weight = 0.1
  neutral_weight = 0.5

  # Calculate Weighted Emotional Score
  emotional_score = (emotional_vector["joy"] * joy_weight) + \
                   (emotional_vector["sadness"] * sadness_weight) + \
                   (emotional_vector["anger"] * anger_weight) + \
                   (emotional_vector["neutral"] * neutral_weight)

  # Baseline Profile
  resolution = "720p"
  bitrate = 2000  # kbps
  codec = "H.264"

  # Adjust Profile based on Emotional Score
  if emotional_score > 0.7:  # High Positive Emotion
    resolution = "1080p"
    bitrate = 5000
    codec = "H.265"
  elif emotional_score < 0.3:  # High Negative Emotion
    resolution = "480p"
    bitrate = 1000
  elif emotional_score > 0.5 and emotional_score < 0.7:
     resolution = "720p"
     bitrate = 3000
     codec = "H.265"
  else:
    resolution = "720p"
    bitrate = 2000
    codec = "H.264"
  
  # Bandwidth Constraint Check
  if bitrate > bandwidth_available:
    bitrate = bandwidth_available * 0.8 # Reduce to 80% of available bandwidth
    if bitrate < 500:
        bitrate = 500

  return (resolution, bitrate, codec)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **User Privacy:**  Implement robust privacy controls for emotional data collection and usage.  Allow users to opt-in/opt-out and control the level of data shared.
*   **A/B Testing:** Conduct A/B testing with different encoding profile mappings to determine the optimal settings for maximizing user engagement and satisfaction.
*   **Content Genre Awareness:** Integrate content genre information (e.g., action, comedy, drama) to refine the encoding profile mapping.
*   **Machine Learning for Personalization:** Use machine learning to personalize the encoding profile mapping based on individual user preferences and viewing history.
