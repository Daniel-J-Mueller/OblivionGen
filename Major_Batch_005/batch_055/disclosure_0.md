## Predictive Caching with User Intent Modeling

**Concept:** Expand speculative reads beyond simple access patterns to incorporate a probabilistic model of *user intent* to pre-fetch data likely needed for a broader task, even if not immediately requested.

**Specifications:**

**1. Intent Classification Module:**

*   **Input:** Stream of read requests, timestamps, application context (if available), user profile data (permissions, role, typical tasks).
*   **Process:** Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., Bayesian Network, Hidden Markov Model, or a lightweight Neural Network) trained on historical data to classify the *intent* behind a sequence of read requests.  Possible intent classifications: “Data Exploration,” “Report Generation,” “Transaction Processing,” “Media Consumption”.
*   **Output:** Probability distribution over possible user intents.

**2. Task-Specific Prefetch Database:**

*   Maintain a database mapping each identified user intent to a pre-defined set of data blocks/files/objects commonly required for that task.  This database will be populated through analysis of historical request patterns associated with those intents.
*   Database fields: `intent_classification`, `data_block_id`, `prefetch_priority`, `data_source`.

**3. Dynamic Prefetch Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Current user intent probability distribution (from Intent Classification Module), current read request, available network bandwidth, system memory capacity.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Calculate a weighted score for each data block in the Task-Specific Prefetch Database based on:
        *   Probability of the associated intent.
        *   `prefetch_priority` value.
        *   A “recency” factor – how recently was this data block accessed.
    2.  Select the top *N* data blocks with the highest scores. The value of *N* is dynamically adjusted based on available bandwidth and memory.
    3.  Initiate speculative reads for the selected data blocks.
*   **Output:**  List of pre-fetched data blocks.

**4. Resource Management:**

*   Monitor network bandwidth and system memory utilization.
*   Implement a feedback loop to adjust the value of *N* (number of pre-fetched blocks) based on resource availability.
*   Implement a “least recently used” (LRU) cache eviction policy for pre-fetched data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_next_data(user_id, current_read_request):
  intent_probabilities = IntentClassificationModule.classify(user_id, current_read_request)

  candidate_data_blocks = []
  for intent, probability in intent_probabilities:
    data_blocks = TaskSpecificPrefetchDatabase.get_blocks(intent)
    for block in data_blocks:
      candidate_data_blocks.append((block, probability * block.prefetch_priority))

  candidate_data_blocks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  N = calculate_prefetch_limit(available_bandwidth, system_memory)
  prefetch_candidates = candidate_data_blocks[:N]

  for block, score in prefetch_candidates:
    speculative_read(block)
  
  return prefetch_candidates
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `IntentClassificationModel`: Machine learning model for intent classification.
*   `TaskSpecificPrefetchDatabase`: Database mapping intents to data blocks.
*   `DataBlock`: Structure representing a data block with fields like `block_id`, `prefetch_priority`, `data_source`.

**Novelty:**

This design moves beyond simple access pattern prediction by incorporating a model of *user intent*. This allows for more intelligent prefetching, anticipating not just *what* the user is currently accessing, but *why* they are accessing it, and pre-fetching data relevant to their broader task.  Existing systems primarily focus on predicting the next sequential access; this system attempts to predict the *future* data needs based on the user’s overarching goal.
