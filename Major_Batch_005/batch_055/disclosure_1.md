## Dynamic Quorum Based on Replica Latency & Conflict Resolution

**Specification:** Implement a system where the quorum size for replica coordination isn't static, but dynamically adjusts based on observed latency *and* detected data conflicts between replicas.

**Core Innovation:** Shifting from a fixed quorum to a 'weighted quorum' where replicas with low latency and minimal conflicts have disproportionately higher 'weight' in the decision-making process. This tackles both performance bottlenecks and data integrity issues.

**System Components:**

*   **Latency Monitor:** A continuous monitoring service measuring round-trip time (RTT) between each replica and a designated 'coordinator' node. RTT data is used to calculate a 'Latency Score' for each replica. Lower RTT = higher score.
*   **Conflict Detector:** Monitors version vectors or other conflict detection mechanisms (e.g., Lamport timestamps) across replicas. Detects discrepancies in data versions. A ‘Conflict Score’ is assigned to each replica – higher conflict = lower score.
*   **Weight Calculator:** Combines Latency and Conflict Scores to generate a ‘Replica Weight’.  Formula: `Replica Weight = (Latency Score * α) + ( (1 - Conflict Score) * β )`. α and β are tunable parameters determining the emphasis on latency vs. conflict resolution.
*   **Dynamic Quorum Manager:**  Calculates the necessary quorum size based on the total ‘weight’ of all replicas. The goal is to achieve a threshold total weight.  
    *   `Required Quorum Weight = Total Replica Weight * Quorum Threshold`.  Quorum Threshold is a configurable parameter (e.g., 0.66 for a 2/3 majority).
    *   The manager then selects the replicas with the highest individual Replica Weights until the Required Quorum Weight is met.
*   **Adaptive Parameter Tuning:** Implement an AI-driven feedback loop to dynamically adjust α, β, and Quorum Threshold based on overall system performance (throughput, latency) and conflict rates.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Quorum Manager):**

```
function calculate_dynamic_quorum(replicas, quorum_threshold):
  total_weight = 0
  for replica in replicas:
    total_weight += replica.weight

  required_quorum_weight = total_weight * quorum_threshold

  quorum_members = []
  sorted_replicas = sorted(replicas, key=lambda x: x.weight, reverse=True)

  current_weight = 0
  for replica in sorted_replicas:
    quorum_members.append(replica)
    current_weight += replica.weight
    if current_weight >= required_quorum_weight:
      break

  return quorum_members
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Replica Object:**
    *   `replica_id` (unique identifier)
    *   `latency_score` (float, 0.0 - 1.0)
    *   `conflict_score` (float, 0.0 - 1.0)
    *   `weight` (calculated float)
    *   `version_vector` (for conflict detection)

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Latency Monitor should utilize proactive probing to maintain accurate latency measurements.
*   Conflict detection mechanisms need to be efficient and minimize overhead.
*   The Adaptive Parameter Tuning loop requires careful monitoring and validation to ensure stability.
*   Consider using a consistent hashing algorithm to distribute replicas across nodes and minimize data movement during scaling.
