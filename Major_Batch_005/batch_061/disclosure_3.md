## Temporal Key Shards & Distributed Entropy

**Concept:** Extend the durability concept by *sharding* the cryptographic key across a distributed network, with each shard’s lifespan tied to a different entropy source’s predictability. This creates a system where key recovery isn’t simply time-based, but reliant on unpredictable external events.

**Specification:**

1.  **Key Shard Generation:**
    *   Input: Original cryptographic key (K).
    *   Process: Divide K into N shards (K1, K2… KN).  Shard size should be sufficient to prevent brute-force attacks on any single shard. Employ a robust key derivation function (KDF) such as HKDF to derive each shard from K, incorporating a unique salt for each.
    *   Output: N key shards, each with a corresponding lifespan determined by an external entropy source.

2.  **Entropy Source Selection:**
    *   Maintain a registry of entropy sources.  Examples: 
        *   Geomagnetic storm probability forecasts.
        *   Solar flare activity predictions.
        *   Random number generator outputs from geographically dispersed sources.
        *   Real-world event schedules with high uncertainty (e.g., sports game outcomes, election results).
    *   Each shard (Ki) is assigned an entropy source (Ei) *and* a lifespan threshold (Ti) associated with that source.  Ti represents the level of unpredictability required within Ei for the shard to remain valid.  (e.g., "Shard K1 remains valid as long as the probability of a major geomagnetic storm in the next 24 hours is below 10%").

3.  **Distributed Storage & Validation:**
    *   Each shard (Ki) is stored on a separate, independent node within a distributed network.  Nodes should ideally be geographically dispersed.
    *   A “validator” process periodically checks the status of each shard.  It queries the associated entropy source (Ei) to determine if the threshold (Ti) has been crossed.
    *   If Ti is crossed, the shard is marked as invalid and overwritten with random data.
    *   Key reconstruction requires gathering a quorum (M out of N) of *valid* shards.

4.  **Key Reconstruction Process:**
    *   Initiate a key reconstruction request.
    *   The system identifies active nodes storing shards.
    *   Nodes respond with their shard data (if valid) or an indication that the shard is invalid.
    *   If a sufficient quorum of valid shards is obtained, the shards are combined using the original KDF (with appropriate salts) to reconstruct the original key K.
    *   If a quorum cannot be obtained, key reconstruction fails.

**Pseudocode (Key Reconstruction):**

```
FUNCTION reconstructKey(keyID):
  shards = []
  activeNodes = getNodeList(keyID) // Get list of nodes storing shards
  
  FOR node IN activeNodes:
    shard = node.getShard(keyID)
    IF shard.isValid():
      shards.append(shard)
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  IF length(shards) >= quorumSize:
    reconstructedKey = KDF(shards, salts) // Use original KDF and salts
    RETURN reconstructedKey
  ELSE:
    RETURN "Key Reconstruction Failed: Insufficient Valid Shards"
  ENDIF
```

**Innovation Rationale:** This approach moves beyond simple time-based durability. The reliance on external entropy sources creates a system where key compromise is tied to unpredictable events. Even if an attacker compromises some shards, they still need to predict (or influence) the behavior of the entropy sources to reconstruct the key.  This provides a significantly higher level of security and resilience. Furthermore, the distributed nature of the storage makes it resistant to single points of failure.
