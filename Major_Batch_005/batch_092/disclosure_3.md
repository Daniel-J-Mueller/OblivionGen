## Tethered Swarm Coordination & Dynamic Mesh Networking

**Concept:** Expand the single UAV tethering system into a multi-UAV, dynamically networked system utilizing the tether infrastructure for both power *and* inter-UAV communication. This allows for coordinated swarm behavior within a constrained airspace, powered and communicated through a central tethered station.

**System Specifications:**

*   **UAV Payload:** Each UAV carries a lightweight transceiver module, a micro-controller, and a standardized power input interface. Each UAV also possesses a small, robust physical connector compatible with the tethering line’s communication/power interface.
*   **Tethering Line Modification:** The tethering line will incorporate a multi-core shielded cable capable of delivering high-bandwidth data and significant electrical power. The cable will also feature regularly spaced, ruggedized physical interfaces (connectors) along its length.
*   **Shuttle Modification:** The shuttle will include a robust docking/undocking mechanism allowing UAVs to physically connect and disconnect from the tethering line while in motion. The shuttle’s central processor will act as a mesh network hub, routing data and power between UAVs and the ground station. Multiple docking ports will be available.
*   **Ground Station:** A high-capacity power supply and data processing unit will be connected to the shuttle, providing the energy and computational resources for the entire system. Wireless communication to a remote operator station will be available.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **UAV Firmware:** Manages local sensor data, accepts commands from the central controller, and controls flight parameters. Implements a lightweight mesh networking protocol.
    *   **Shuttle Software:** Manages the mesh network, distributes power, processes sensor data from all UAVs, and implements high-level mission planning and control.
    *   **Ground Station Software:** Provides a user interface for mission planning, monitoring, and control. Includes tools for visualizing the swarm's position, status, and sensor data.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Deployment:** Shuttle is positioned. Tethering line is deployed.
2.  **UAV Connection:** UAVs approach the tethering line. The shuttle’s docking mechanism allows them to physically connect. Connection establishes power and data link.
3.  **Mesh Network Formation:** Upon connection, UAVs automatically join the mesh network managed by the shuttle.
4.  **Swarm Coordination:** The shuttle's central processor coordinates the swarm’s movements and actions. This could include collaborative mapping, search and rescue, or environmental monitoring.
5.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration:** UAVs can connect and disconnect from the tethering line as needed. The mesh network automatically reconfigures to maintain connectivity.
6.  **Emergency Procedures:** A failsafe mechanism ensures that UAVs can safely detach from the tethering line in the event of a power failure or communication loss.
