## Dynamic Tensor Partitioning via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** Implement a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent to dynamically partition tensor operations *during runtime* based on observed hardware utilization and predicted performance gains. This moves beyond static partitioning defined at model creation.

**Specifications:**

*   **RL Agent:** A Deep Q-Network (DQN) trained to select partition strategies.
*   **State Space:**
    *   Hardware utilization metrics (GPU/TPU core load, memory bandwidth, cache hit rates) for each available computing engine.
    *   Tensor dimensions and data types.
    *   Operation type (convolution, matrix multiplication, etc.).
    *   Current partitioning strategy.
*   **Action Space:** Discrete actions representing different partitioning strategies. Examples:
    *   `PARTITION_ROW_EVEN_ODD`: Split tensor along rows, assigning even rows to Engine 1, odd rows to Engine 2.
    *   `PARTITION_COLUMN_BLOCK_SIZE_N`: Split along columns into blocks of size N.
    *   `PARTITION_DEPTH_HALF_HALF`: Split along the depth dimension.
    *   `NO_PARTITION`: Perform operation on a single engine.
*   **Reward Function:**
    *   Primary reward: Negative execution time (minimize latency).
    *   Secondary rewards/penalties:
        *   Reward for balanced load across engines.
        *   Penalty for data transfer between engines.
        *   Penalty for excessive memory usage.
*   **Training:**
    *   Off-policy training using a replay buffer.
    *   Target network for stable learning.
    *   Exploration strategy (epsilon-greedy or similar).
*   **Runtime Integration:**
    *   A lightweight profiling stage to estimate the execution time of different partitioning strategies.
    *   The RL agent selects the best strategy based on profiling results and current system state.
    *   The operation is then partitioned and executed in parallel on the selected engines.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Execution):**

```
function execute_tensor_operation(tensor, operation, engines):
  system_state = get_system_state(engines)
  action = rl_agent.select_action(system_state) # Returns partitioning strategy
  
  partitioned_tensors = partition_tensor(tensor, action)
  
  parallel_execution_results = execute_in_parallel(partitioned_tensors, engines)
  
  result = combine_results(parallel_execution_results)
  
  rl_agent.update(system_state, action, execution_time) # Reinforce agent
  
  return result
```

**Novelty:** This approach differs from static partitioning by adapting the partitioning strategy *dynamically* based on runtime conditions. The use of reinforcement learning allows the system to learn optimal partitioning strategies for different hardware configurations and workloads, improving overall performance and resource utilization. It moves beyond hand-tuned optimizations.
