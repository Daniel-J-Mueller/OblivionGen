**Adaptive Query Expansion via Temporal Drift Detection**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the existing query refinement tool to dynamically adjust related query suggestions based on *temporal drift* in search intent. The system will identify when the meaning of a query or its related terms shifts over time and update recommendations accordingly.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Temporal Intent Analyzer (TIA):** Monitors search query logs and associated click-through data over defined time windows (e.g., 7-day, 30-day, 90-day). Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques – specifically, word embedding drift analysis and topic modeling – to detect changes in query meaning and user intent.
*   **Drift Threshold Configurator:** Allows administrators to set sensitivity thresholds for drift detection. Higher thresholds require more significant shifts in intent before triggering updates to related queries.
*   **Query Recommendation Engine (QRE):** The existing system's core. Receives drift signals from the TIA and adjusts the weighting of related queries in the refinement tool's display.
*   **A/B Testing Module:** Continuously evaluates the performance of the dynamic refinement tool against a static baseline.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Data Ingestion:** The TIA continuously ingests search query logs, click-through rates, and time stamps.
2.  **Intent Analysis:** The TIA performs the following:
    *   **Word Embedding Drift:** Monitors changes in the vector representations of queries and related terms using models like Word2Vec or GloVe. Significant shifts in vector proximity indicate evolving meaning.
    *   **Topic Modeling:** Uses LDA or similar techniques to identify prevalent topics within search queries over time. Changes in topic distributions signal shifts in user intent.
3.  **Drift Signal Generation:** If the TIA detects significant drift (based on configured thresholds), it generates a drift signal, including the affected query/terms and the magnitude of the drift.
4.  **QRE Adjustment:** The QRE receives the drift signal and adjusts the ranking and weighting of related queries in the refinement tool.
    *   **Increased Weight:**  Related queries that align with the new intent receive increased weight.
    *   **Decreased Weight/Removal:**  Related queries that no longer align with the new intent receive decreased weight or are removed entirely.
    *   **New Query Suggestions:** The system may also proactively suggest *new* related queries based on the detected shift in intent, using a generative language model fine-tuned on the recent search data.
5.  **A/B Testing:** The performance of the dynamic refinement tool is continuously evaluated against a static baseline through A/B testing, tracking metrics such as click-through rate, conversion rate, and search session length.

**IV. Pseudocode (QRE Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_related_queries(query, drift_signal):
  related_queries = get_related_queries(query)
  for related_query in related_queries:
    drift_score = calculate_drift_score(related_query, drift_signal)
    related_query.weight += drift_score * sensitivity_factor // sensitivity_factor is a tunable parameter

  // Normalize weights to ensure they sum to 1
  total_weight = sum(query.weight for query in related_queries)
  for query in related_queries:
    query.weight /= total_weight

  //Add new queries, if necessary
  if (drift_signal.new_queries):
    for new_query in drift_signal.new_queries:
      related_queries.append(new_query)
      new_query.weight = 0.1 //Initial weight

  return related_queries
```

**V. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sufficient processing power and memory for NLP models and real-time data analysis.
*   Scalable storage for search query logs and model parameters.
*   Low-latency network connectivity for real-time updates.
