## Dynamic Predictive Storage Allocation with Sentiment Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the cluster-based storage assignment system by incorporating real-time sentiment analysis of product reviews and social media data to *predict* future co-purchasing trends *before* they manifest in order history. This shifts the system from *reactive* cluster formation to *proactive* storage optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Integrate with APIs for major e-commerce platforms to access product review data.
    *   Real-time monitoring of social media platforms (Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok) using relevant hashtags and keywords associated with products.
    *   Internal database of product descriptions, categories, and related attributes.
*   **Sentiment Analysis Engine:**
    *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) model trained to identify sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) related to products and product pairings.  Emphasis on identifying *reasoning* behind sentiment – e.g., “This phone is great *with* this case” vs “This phone is great, but the case is flimsy”.
    *   Sentiment scoring system: Assign numerical values to sentiment levels (e.g., +1 for strongly positive, -1 for strongly negative, 0 for neutral).
    *   Co-occurrence analysis: Track how often products are mentioned together in positive/negative contexts.
*   **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future co-purchase probabilities based on sentiment trends and historical order data.
    *   Bayesian network to model dependencies between products and predict the likelihood of a customer purchasing product B given they've purchased product A (and considering sentiment data).
*   **Dynamic Storage Allocation:**
    *   Integration with existing storage assignment system.
    *   Algorithm to dynamically adjust storage allocation based on predicted co-purchase probabilities. High probability pairings are stored closer together.
    *   "Shadow" cluster formation: Predictive model generates potential clusters *before* they emerge in order data.
    *   Capacity forecasting:  Based on predicted demand for co-purchased items, the system forecasts storage capacity requirements.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Microservice architecture.
    *   Message queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication between microservices.
    *   Scalable database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) for storing sentiment data, predictive models, and storage allocation plans.
    *   API endpoints for accessing sentiment data, predictive models, and storage allocation plans.
*   **Pseudocode for Dynamic Allocation:**

```pseudocode
// Input: List of products, sentiment data, predictive model, storage capacity
function dynamicStorageAllocation(products, sentimentData, predictiveModel, storageCapacity) {
  // 1. Calculate co-purchase probabilities for all product pairs using the predictiveModel and sentimentData
  coPurchaseProbabilities = predictiveModel.predict(products, sentimentData)

  // 2. Create a weighted graph where nodes are products and edge weights are co-purchase probabilities
  graph = createGraph(products, coPurchaseProbabilities)

  // 3. Apply a graph clustering algorithm (e.g., Louvain, Leiden) to identify clusters of co-purchased products
  clusters = clusterGraph(graph)

  // 4. Calculate the storage space required for each cluster based on predicted demand
  clusterStorageRequirements = calculateStorageRequirements(clusters, predictedDemand)

  // 5. Allocate storage space to each cluster based on its requirements and available storage capacity
  allocateStorage(clusters, clusterStorageRequirements, storageCapacity)

  // 6. Update storage assignment system with new allocations
  updateStorageSystem()
}
```

**Innovation:** The system moves beyond *identifying* existing co-purchasing patterns to *predicting* future trends based on public sentiment, enabling proactive storage optimization, reduced shipping times, and enhanced customer experience. It's a shift from 'what sold together' to 'what *will* sell together'.
