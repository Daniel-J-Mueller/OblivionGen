## Tamper-Evident Cooling System for Rack-Mounted Appliances

**Specification:** A closed-loop cooling system integrated *within* the mesh barrier, utilizing a temperature-sensitive, electrically conductive fluid.

**Components:**

*   **Mesh Barrier:** Woven metallic or polymer mesh, similar to the provided patent's barrier, but with integrated microchannels.
*   **Coolant:**  Electrically conductive fluid (e.g., nanofluid containing carbon nanotubes or graphene) with a known thermal conductivity and electrical resistance. This fluid circulates within the microchannels of the mesh.
*   **Pump/Reservoir:** A small, low-power pump and reservoir unit mounted on the rack, outside the appliance's immediate space.  This drives the coolant circulation.
*   **Sensor Array:** An array of micro-sensors integrated into the rack's power delivery system (or directly bonded to the rack frame). These sensors monitor voltage/current fluctuations and temperature changes.
*   **Control Unit:** A microcontroller that analyzes data from the sensor array and coolant flow rate.
*   **Alert System:**  Visual and/or network-based alerts triggered by tamper detection or coolant failure.

**Operation:**

1.  The coolant circulates through the mesh barrier's microchannels, providing localized cooling to the appliance.
2.  The sensor array continuously monitors the electrical resistance of the coolant *within* the mesh. A breach in the mesh barrier, or physical manipulation of the barrier, will *immediately* alter the coolant's path and thus its electrical resistance.
3.  The control unit compares the measured resistance against a baseline value.  Significant deviations trigger an alert.
4.  The pump/reservoir unit includes a flow sensor.  Loss of coolant flow (due to a leak caused by tampering) also triggers an alert.
5.  The system is powered by the rack's existing power supply.

**Pseudocode (Control Unit):**

```
// Define baseline resistance and acceptable deviation
baselineResistance = 100 ohms;
deviationThreshold = 5 ohms;

loop:
    currentResistance = readResistance();
    flowRate = readFlowRate();

    if (abs(currentResistance - baselineResistance) > deviationThreshold) {
        triggerTamperAlert();
    }

    if (flowRate < minimumFlowRate) {
        triggerLeakAlert();
    }

    delay(100 milliseconds);
end loop
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simple break-detection to create an *active* tamper-detection layer integrated with the appliance's cooling system. It doesn't just detect *if* the barrier is breached, it can also detect subtle manipulation *before* a full breach occurs. The active cooling integration provides an additional layer of functionality â€“ and provides data points which would be unavailable from a purely passive mesh system.
