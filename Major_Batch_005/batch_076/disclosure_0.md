## Dynamic Illumination Correction & Relighting

**Concept:** Leverage the video input not just for OCR, but to dynamically model and correct illumination within the book's pages, then *relight* the resulting digital pages for optimal readability and aesthetic control in the eBook.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Video stream of book pages being turned (as per patent).
*   **Illumination Mapping Module:**
    *   **Feature Detection:** Employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify specular highlights, shadows, and overall brightness variations in each frame.
    *   **Light Source Estimation:**  Estimate the direction and intensity of the primary light source(s) using the detected features. This could be achieved through photometric stereo techniques adapted for video.
    *   **Reflectance Map Generation:** Create a reflectance map for each page based on the detected features and estimated light source. This map represents how each point on the page reflects light *independent* of the current illumination.
*   **Digital Relighting Module:**
    *   **Virtual Light Source Control:** Allow the user (or an automated system) to define virtual light sources. These can be positioned and adjusted in a 3D space relative to the digital page.
    *   **Rendering Engine:** Render the digital page using the reflectance map and the defined virtual light sources. This will simulate how the page would appear under different lighting conditions.
    *   **Adaptive Illumination:** Implement an algorithm that automatically adjusts the virtual light sources to optimize readability based on page content (e.g., increase brightness in areas with dense text, reduce glare on glossy images).
*   **Integration with OCR & eBook Creation:**
    *   Prior to OCR, apply illumination correction to enhance text clarity and improve OCR accuracy.
    *   Store the reflectance map alongside the OCR content for each page.
    *   Allow the eBook reader to dynamically adjust the illumination based on user preferences or ambient lighting conditions.

**Pseudocode (Illumination Mapping):**

```
For each frame in video:
    Detect features (highlights, shadows) using CNN
    Estimate light source direction & intensity
    Generate reflectance map based on features & light source
End For

Combine reflectance maps from multiple frames for each page to create a refined map.
```

**Pseudocode (Digital Relighting):**

```
User/System defines virtual light sources (position, intensity, color).

For each page:
    Load reflectance map.
    Render page using reflectance map and virtual light sources.
    Adjust lighting parameters based on content and user preferences.
    Display rendered page.
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple brightness/contrast adjustments. By modeling the page’s reflectance properties, we can create a more realistic and controllable lighting environment within the eBook, improving readability and aesthetic appeal. The dynamic aspect—adapting to user preferences and ambient lighting—offers a superior user experience. It also opens up the possibility of artistic relighting, allowing users to customize the look and feel of their eBooks.
