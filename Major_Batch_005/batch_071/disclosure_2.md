## Dynamic Capability Leasing & Micro-Tasking

**Concept:** Expand the device capability sharing beyond static augmentation to a dynamic, micro-tasking system where devices ‘lease’ their capabilities to others for short-duration, specific tasks – akin to a decentralized, localized cloud compute/sensor network.

**Specs:**

*   **Capability Granularity:** Break down device capabilities into micro-tasks. Example: Instead of “image capture,” define tasks like “detect faces in 1080p stream,” “stabilize video footage,” “perform object recognition on image,” or “audio noise reduction.”
*   **Capability Marketplace:** Implement a localized "Capability Marketplace" within the network. Devices advertise available micro-tasks and associated ‘leasing’ costs (could be symbolic – credits, reciprocal task access, etc.).
*   **Task Broker:** A central (or distributed) Task Broker receives requests (from any device) defining a task. It analyzes the task requirements, searches the Capability Marketplace for suitable devices, and negotiates a lease.
*   **Secure Execution Environment (SEE):** All micro-tasks are executed within a SEE on the ‘provider’ device. This ensures data privacy, prevents malicious code execution, and manages resource allocation.  SEE leverages containerization/virtualization.
*   **Data Pipeline:** A standardized data pipeline moves data between the requesting device, the provider device (via SEE), and back.  Format is protocol agnostic but prioritized towards low-latency, high-bandwidth options (e.g., WebRTC).
*   **Reputation System:** A reputation system tracks the reliability and performance of both task requesters and providers. This incentivizes quality service and discourages malicious behavior.
*   **Dynamic Pricing:**  Pricing adjusted based on demand, provider device resource load, network conditions, and task complexity. Machine learning employed to optimize pricing and resource allocation.

**Pseudocode (Task Request Flow):**

```
// Requesting Device
task_definition = {
    type: "object_recognition",
    image_data: image_blob,
    desired_output: "bounding_boxes",
    max_price: 10_credits
}

request = submit_task(task_definition)
result = wait_for_result(request.id, timeout=30s)

if result.status == "success":
    // Process result.bounding_boxes
else:
    // Handle error
```

```
// Task Broker
task_request = receive_request()
eligible_providers = search_marketplace(task_request.capabilities)

//Select best provider using ML (cost, reputation, availability)
selected_provider = choose_provider(eligible_providers)

//Negotiate lease (cost, time limit)
lease_agreement = negotiate_lease(selected_provider, task_request)

//Send task execution request to provider
send_execution_request(selected_provider, task_request, lease_agreement)
```

```
// Provider Device
execution_request = receive_request()
//Verify lease agreement
if lease_valid(execution_request.lease):
  //Execute task within SEE
  result = execute_task(execution_request.task_data, SEE)
  //Send result back to Task Broker
  send_result(result)
else:
  //Reject task
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Localized AR/VR processing
*   Edge AI inference
*   Crowdsourced sensor networks
*   On-demand video/audio processing
*   Real-time data analysis in IoT deployments.
