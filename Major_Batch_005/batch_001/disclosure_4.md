## Adaptive Spatial Audio Beaconing

**Concept:** Utilize the adaptive filter coefficient data – specifically the directional information derived from identifying peak values – not just for double-talk detection, but as the basis for creating localized audio beacons. These beacons act as 'fingerprints' of sound sources within a space, enabling more sophisticated spatial audio rendering and targeted audio transmission.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing microphone array (dual microphones as in the provided patent are the minimum, but expandable to higher density arrays). Dedicated low-latency processing unit (DSP or equivalent). Optional: Small, directional audio emitters (e.g., phased array speakers) for beacon transmission.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Coefficient Mapping:**  This module takes the filter coefficient values (specifically those identified as peaks – representing directions of sound) and transforms them into a spatial coordinate system.  Higher coefficient values signify stronger signal presence in that direction. The system should dynamically normalize these values.
    *   **Beacon Generation:** Based on the coefficient mapping, create a digital "beacon" representing the sound source. This beacon isn’t a traditional audio signal, but a data packet containing:
        *   Spatial coordinates (derived from coefficient peak)
        *   Signal strength (normalized coefficient value)
        *   Timbre/Spectral characteristics (basic analysis of captured audio at the peak direction).
    *   **Beacon Transmission/Storage:**  Two modes:
        *   **Real-time Transmission:**  Transmit beacons wirelessly to other devices (e.g., other devices with similar microphone arrays, AR/VR headsets, smart speakers). Transmission protocol: Low-latency, short-range protocol (Bluetooth Low Energy, UWB).
        *   **Beacon Mapping:** Store beacon data locally to build a “spatial audio map” of the environment.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering:** When receiving beacon data (from other devices or the local map), use the spatial coordinates to render the corresponding audio signal in 3D space. This creates a more immersive and realistic audio experience.
    *   **Targeted Audio Transmission:**  Use beacon data to *direct* audio signals. For example, if a device detects a user’s location via beaconing, it can send audio specifically towards that user, minimizing sound leakage.

**Pseudocode (Beacon Generation):**

```
// Input:  Array of filter coefficients (coeffs[])
//        Audio data at peak direction (audio[])

function generateBeacon(coeffs[], audio[]) {
  // Find peak coefficient value and index
  peakValue = max(coeffs[])
  peakIndex = indexOf(coeffs[], peakValue)

  // Calculate spatial coordinates based on peakIndex (requires calibration)
  x = calculateX(peakIndex)
  y = calculateY(peakIndex)
  z = calculateZ(peakIndex)

  // Analyze audio data for timbre/spectral characteristics
  spectralData = analyzeAudio(audio[])

  // Create beacon data packet
  beacon = {
    x: x,
    y: y,
    z: z,
    strength: peakValue,
    spectralData: spectralData
  }

  return beacon
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Immersive Gaming/VR/AR:**  Accurate spatial audio positioning for a more realistic experience.
*   **Smart Homes:**  Targeted audio for voice assistants, personalized audio zones.
*   **Conference Calls:**  Pinpoint speaker location for improved clarity.
*   **Accessibility:**  Directional audio cues for visually impaired individuals.
*   **Security:**  Sound source localization for surveillance applications.
