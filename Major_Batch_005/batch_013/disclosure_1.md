## Adaptive Emotional Resonance Profiles

**Concept:** Expand the sentiment analysis beyond simple negative/positive scoring to create dynamic, multi-faceted "Emotional Resonance Profiles" (ERPs) for each recipient, and use these profiles to modulate message composition *before* sending, rather than just flagging potentially problematic messages.

**Specifications:**

**1. ERP Data Structure:**

```
ERP = {
    "recipient_id": "unique_user_identifier",
    "topic_history": {
        "topic_1": {
            "sentiment_score": 0.7, // -1 to 1
            "emotional_intensity": 0.6, // 0 to 1
            "preferred_communication_style": "formal/informal/empathetic/direct",
            "response_latency": 2.5 //seconds, average response time
        },
        "topic_2": {
            // ... similar data for other topics
        }
    },
    "global_sensitivity": 0.4, // Overall sensitivity to negative sentiment
    "communication_preferences": {
        "image_sensitivity": 0.7,
        "emoji_usage": "high/medium/low",
        "length_preference": "short/medium/long"
    }
}
```

**2. Message Composition Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw message content, recipient ID.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Topic Extraction:**  Identify key topics within the message.
    2.  **Sentiment Analysis:**  Determine sentiment score for each topic.
    3.  **ERP Lookup:** Retrieve recipientâ€™s ERP.
    4.  **Resonance Calculation:**  Compare message sentiment scores to corresponding ERP values. Generate a 'Resonance Score' based on the degree of alignment.
    5.  **Adaptive Modulation:**  Based on the Resonance Score:
        *   **Low Resonance:** (Significant mismatch)  Suggest alternative phrasing, soften language, remove potentially triggering keywords, or encourage the sender to reconsider the message. *Dynamically re-write the message in a less jarring way.* Offer multiple re-writes for the sender's selection.
        *   **Medium Resonance:**  Subtly adjust tone, incorporate preferred communication styles (e.g., adding empathetic phrases), and optimize message length.
        *   **High Resonance:**  No modification.
        *   **Image/Emoji Adjustment:** Adjust image or emoji usage based on the `image_sensitivity` and `emoji_usage` settings within the ERP.
*   **Output:** Modified message content.

**3.  Dynamic ERP Update:**

*   Whenever the sender receives a response, update the ERP:
    *   Analyze response sentiment & topics.
    *   Adjust `sentiment_score`, `emotional_intensity`, and `response_latency` values.
    *   If the response is positive and quick, increase `emotional_intensity` for that topic. If it's negative or slow, decrease it.

**4.  Implementation Notes:**

*   Utilize a large language model (LLM) for sentiment analysis, topic extraction, and message rewriting.
*   Store ERPs in a scalable database.
*   Consider privacy implications and allow users to control their data.
*   The system should be configurable to allow users to set their own sensitivity levels and communication preferences.
