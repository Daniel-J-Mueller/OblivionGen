## Dynamic Credential Weighting & Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Augment password security not by *replacing* passwords, but by layering a dynamic weighting system onto existing credentials, informed by continuous behavioral biometrics. This creates a 'trust score' that adjusts authentication requirements in real-time.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Points:** Keyboard dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure), mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns), touchscreen interactions (pressure, swipe velocity, multi-touch gestures), device orientation/movement (accelerometer, gyroscope), app usage patterns (time of day, frequency, sequence), network characteristics (IP address, geolocation, connection type).
*   **Collection Frequency:** Continuous background data collection during active device use.  Data is *not* transmitted directly; instead, a rolling statistical profile is maintained *locally* on the device.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  All data is anonymized and aggregated. Raw data is *never* transmitted. Only statistical features (e.g., mean typing speed, standard deviation of mouse acceleration) are used. User consent is mandatory.

**2. Trust Score Calculation Engine:**

*   **Baseline Profile:** Upon initial setup, the system establishes a baseline behavioral profile for the user.
*   **Real-Time Deviation:** Continuously monitors real-time behavioral data for deviations from the baseline profile.
*   **Weighted Factors:** Assigns weights to different behavioral factors based on their predictive power (determined through machine learning on a large dataset). Factors exhibiting high variance (e.g., unusual typing speed) receive higher weights.
*   **Trust Score Output:** Generates a dynamic trust score ranging from 0 to 100. Higher scores indicate greater confidence that the user is legitimate.

**3. Dynamic Authentication Protocol:**

*   **Tiered Authentication:**  Implements a tiered authentication system based on the trust score.
    *   **Tier 1 (Trust Score > 90):**  No additional authentication required.  Access granted automatically.
    *   **Tier 2 (Trust Score 70-90):**  Low-friction authentication (e.g., biometric scan – fingerprint, face ID).
    *   **Tier 3 (Trust Score 50-70):**  Standard password prompt with optional multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   **Tier 4 (Trust Score < 50):**  Strong MFA with challenging security questions or one-time passcodes.  Account lock-out after multiple failed attempts.
*   **Adaptive Challenge:**  If the trust score drops suddenly, the system can issue an adaptive challenge (e.g., "Verify your last known location" or "Identify the device you used to log in yesterday").
*   **Risk-Based Authentication:**  Integrates with application context (e.g., accessing sensitive financial data triggers higher authentication requirements).

**4.  Credential Integration & Update:**

*   Existing passwords are *not* replaced, but *supplemented*. They remain a fallback option.
*   The behavioral data and trust score are stored securely (encrypted) on the device and backed up to a trusted server (with user consent).
*   A 'credential weight' is assigned to each authentication factor (password, biometrics, behavioral data).
*   The system calculates a combined authentication score based on the weighted sum of each factor.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculateCombinedScore(passwordScore, biometricScore, behavioralScore):
  passwordWeight = 0.3
  biometricWeight = 0.4
  behavioralWeight = 0.3
  combinedScore = (passwordScore * passwordWeight) + (biometricScore * biometricWeight) + (behavioralScore * behavioralWeight)
  return combinedScore

function authenticateUser():
  passwordScore = validatePassword() //Returns 0 or 1
  biometricScore = validateBiometrics() //Returns score between 0-1
  behavioralScore = getBehavioralTrustScore() //Returns score between 0-1
  combinedScore = calculateCombinedScore(passwordScore, biometricScore, behavioralScore)

  if combinedScore >= threshold:
    grantAccess()
  else:
    requestAdditionalAuthentication()
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond static authentication factors and leverages continuous behavioral biometrics to create a dynamic, adaptive security layer.  It’s not about replacing passwords, but augmenting them with a more nuanced and intelligent security model. The weighting system allows for granular control and prioritizes different authentication factors based on risk and user behavior.
