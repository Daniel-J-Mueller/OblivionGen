## Dynamic Content-Aware Document Reconstruction & Presentation

**Concept:** Extend the layout detection beyond static page analysis to reconstruct documents *dynamically* based on content relationships and intended reading flow, prioritizing readability over strict page fidelity. This is especially useful for complex documents (reports, books) displayed on varied screen sizes.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Content Relationship Engine (CRE) – analyzes extracted content (text, images, tables) to identify logical relationships (headings, paragraphs, lists, captions, etc.). Utilizes a combination of:
    *   Stylistic analysis (font size, weight, spacing)
    *   Semantic analysis (keyword identification, topic modeling)
    *   Proximity analysis (spatial relationships between elements).
*   **Resolution-Independent Grid Generation:**  Instead of fixed grid divisions, dynamically generate grid cells based on content block sizes *and* target display resolution. Smaller screens = smaller, more numerous cells. Larger screens = larger, fewer cells.
*   **Flow Mapping Algorithm:**
    1.  CRE identifies primary content “blocks” (paragraphs, sections, etc.).
    2.  These blocks are assigned "flow weights" based on their importance (e.g., headings have higher weights).
    3.  A weighted graph is constructed representing the document’s content flow.
    4.  A pathfinding algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's) determines the optimal reading path, prioritizing high-weight blocks.
*   **Adaptive Layout Engine:**
    *   Receives the pathfinding output.
    *   Dynamically places content blocks into grid cells, respecting the identified reading flow.
    *   Handles content overflow by:
        *   Reflowing text within cells.
        *   Breaking blocks into multiple cells.
        *   Scaling content (with quality limits).
        *   Introducing "soft page breaks" – visually indicating a continuation of content without forcing a hard page turn.
*   **User Interaction Layer:**
    *   Provides tools for manual flow adjustment (e.g., drag-and-drop reordering of blocks).
    *   Offers different "reading modes" (e.g., "continuous scroll", "simulated page turn", "blocks view").
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ContentBlock`: `{id, type, text, dimensions, flowWeight, gridCells}`
    *   `FlowGraph`: `{nodes (ContentBlock IDs), edges (relationships, weights)}`
    *   `GridCell`: `{id, dimensions, contentBlockId}`

**Pseudocode (Flow Mapping Algorithm):**

```
function mapDocumentFlow(document):
  flowGraph = createFlowGraph(document)
  startNode = findStartNode(flowGraph) // e.g., document title
  endNode = findEndNode(flowGraph) // e.g., document end
  path = dijkstra(flowGraph, startNode, endNode) // finds optimal path based on flow weights
  return path // ordered list of ContentBlock IDs
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Powered Flow Enhancement:** Use machine learning to predict optimal flow based on document content and user reading preferences.
*   **Multi-Document Integration:** Combine content from multiple sources into a single, dynamically flowing document.
*   **Accessibility Features:** Automatically generate alternative text descriptions and layout variations for users with disabilities.
