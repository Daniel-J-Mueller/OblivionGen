## Dynamic Relevance-Based Feature Highlighting

**Concept:** Extend the relevance feedback mechanism to not only refine search *results* but also dynamically highlight features *within* those results, based on user interaction and learned preferences. This moves beyond simply ranking items to actively guiding the user's attention within each item.

**Specifications:**

**1. Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Product catalog items (textual descriptions, images, structured data – price, dimensions, materials, etc.).
*   **Process:**  Employ NLP and computer vision techniques to identify key features within each item.  Examples:  "High Resolution Screen", "Waterproof", "Lightweight", "Made of Recycled Materials", specific brand names, color attributes.
*   **Output:** Feature list with associated confidence scores for each item. Store in a feature index alongside the item catalog.

**2. Interaction Tracking Module:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data: Mouse movements, click patterns, dwell time on specific areas of the displayed search results (both text and images), scrolling behavior.
*   **Process:**  Track user attention.  Calculate ‘attention scores’ for different features within each displayed item. Longer dwell times, clicks, and movements focused on specific areas indicate higher attention.
*   **Output:**  Time-series data of user attention scores for each feature within each item.

**3. Relevance Model Training Module:**

*   **Input:**  Search query, relevance feedback (from the existing patent – thumbs up/down), interaction tracking data, feature data.
*   **Process:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a transformer model) to predict feature relevance. The model learns to associate user interactions with feature importance *given* the search query and initial relevance feedback.  Consider combining explicit feedback with implicit feedback from interaction tracking.
*   **Output:** Trained model that predicts feature relevance scores for each feature, given a search query and user interactions.

**4. Dynamic Highlighting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Search results, search query, trained relevance model, user interaction data.
*   **Process:** For each search result:
    *   Predict feature relevance scores using the trained model.
    *   Dynamically highlight features based on their predicted relevance.  Highlighting methods:
        *   **Textual Emphasis:** Bolding, color change, underlining.
        *   **Visual Overlays:**  Bounding boxes around important image regions, heatmaps overlaid on images.
        *   **Feature Summarization:**  Concise summaries of key features displayed prominently.
    *   Adjust highlighting intensity based on predicted confidence.
*   **Output:** Search results with dynamically highlighted features.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function highlight_features(search_results, query, user_interactions):
  for result in search_results:
    feature_relevance_scores = predict_feature_relevance(result, query, user_interactions)
    sorted_features = sort_features_by_relevance(feature_relevance_scores)
    for feature in sorted_features:
      if feature_relevance_score[feature] > threshold:
        highlight_feature(result, feature)
  return search_results

function predict_feature_relevance(result, query, user_interactions):
  # Use trained ML model to predict relevance score for each feature
  # Input: result features, query, user interaction data
  # Output: Dictionary of feature:relevance_score pairs
  # Implementation details hidden
  return feature_relevance_scores

function highlight_feature(result, feature):
  # Apply highlighting based on feature type (text, image, etc.)
  # Implementation details hidden
  # Example: Bold text, draw bounding box around image region
  pass

```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Feature Index:** `item_id: [feature_1, feature_2, ...] `
*   **Relevance Scores:** `query, item_id, feature, relevance_score`
*   **Interaction Log:** `user_id, item_id, feature, interaction_type, timestamp`

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Highlighting:** Adapt highlighting based on the user's historical preferences.
*   **Comparative Highlighting:** Highlight features that differentiate between multiple search results.
*   **Explainable Highlighting:**  Provide users with a rationale for why certain features were highlighted.
