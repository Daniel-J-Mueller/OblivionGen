## Dynamic Disambiguation Contextualization

**Concept:** Expand disambiguation choices beyond simply presenting the top N hypotheses. Incorporate real-time contextual data to *dynamically* refine and expand the set of hypotheses presented to the user, increasing the probability of correct selection, and reducing frustration.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Contextual Data Sources:**
    *   **Location Data:** GPS, Wi-Fi positioning.
    *   **Time of Day/Week:** User routines.
    *   **Calendar Integration:** Scheduled events.
    *   **App Usage:** Currently active or recently used applications.
    *   **Sensor Data:** Accelerometer (movement), Microphone (ambient sounds).
    *   **Network Activity:** Active network connections (e.g., Bluetooth to a car).

2.  **Contextual Feature Vector:** A feature vector is created based on the collected contextual data. This vector represents the current 'state' of the user and their environment. Example features:
    *   `location_category`: (home, work, commute, restaurant, gym, etc.)
    *   `time_of_day`: (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
    *   `calendar_event`: (meeting, appointment, free)
    *   `active_app`: (maps, music, email, browser)
    *   `ambient_noise_level`: (quiet, moderate, loud)

3.  **Hypothesis Scoring with Context:** The initial N-best list from the ASR is re-scored using a machine learning model (e.g., a neural network, decision tree) trained on historical ASR data *and* contextual feature vectors. The model predicts the probability that each hypothesis is the correct interpretation *given* the current context.  The model could use a loss function like cross-entropy to maximize correct hypothesis selection.

    *   `P(hypothesis | ASR_score, Context_Vector)`

4.  **Dynamic Hypothesis Expansion:** After re-scoring, the system doesn't just select the top N. It *dynamically* expands the list by adding hypotheses that, while having lower initial ASR scores, have significantly *higher* probabilities given the current context. A threshold is used to determine when a hypothesis is considered a viable addition.  The goal isnâ€™t to just improve top-N accuracy, but to increase the diversity of presented options for edge cases.

5.  **Presentation Layer:** The disambiguation UI presents the dynamically generated list of hypotheses to the user.  The presentation can be enhanced by visually indicating the confidence score and/or contextual relevance of each hypothesis. For example:

    *   Highlighting hypotheses that are particularly relevant to the current location or activity.
    *   Displaying a brief explanation of *why* a particular hypothesis is being suggested.

6.  **Training Data:**  A large dataset of ASR transcripts, contextual data, and user selections is required to train the scoring model. Data augmentation techniques can be used to increase the size and diversity of the training set.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateDisambiguationChoices(audioData, contextData, nBestList):
  // 1. Perform ASR on audioData to generate nBestList (ASR scores included)

  // 2. Extract contextData (location, time, app usage, etc.) and create ContextVector

  // 3. Load trained scoring model (trained on ASR scores & ContextVectors)

  // 4. Re-score nBestList hypotheses using scoring model(ASR Score, ContextVector) -> NewScores

  // 5. Initialize DisambiguationList with top K hypotheses from NewScores

  // 6. Iterate through remaining hypotheses in nBestList:
  //    If NewScore is above a threshold AND hypothesis is significantly different from those in DisambiguationList:
  //       Add hypothesis to DisambiguationList

  // 7. Return DisambiguationList to user interface
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Models:** Train separate scoring models for each user to better capture their individual preferences and speech patterns.
*   **Real-time Adaptation:** Continuously update the scoring model based on user feedback and interactions.
*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Incorporate other input modalities, such as visual input (e.g., camera feed), to further refine the disambiguation process.
