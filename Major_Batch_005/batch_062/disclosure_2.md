## Dynamic Gateway Mesh Networking & Predictive Handover

**Concept:** Expand beyond a single gateway connection per edge device. Implement a dynamic mesh network of gateways, predicting handover needs *before* signal degradation and proactively switching edge device connections. This reduces latency, improves reliability in mobile scenarios, and optimizes network load.

**Specs:**

*   **Gateway Role Definition:** Gateways designated as ‘core’, ‘edge’, or ‘roaming’. Core gateways provide primary network access. Edge gateways extend coverage and participate in mesh routing. Roaming gateways are mobile and dynamically join/leave the mesh.
*   **Edge Device Signal Mapping:** Edge devices periodically transmit beacon signals (minimal data) indicating signal strength to *multiple* nearby gateways. This data is aggregated at a central network controller.
*   **Predictive Handover Algorithm:** The controller employs a machine learning model trained on historical signal data, device velocity (estimated from consecutive beacon timestamps), and network topology to *predict* when a device will require handover to a different gateway.
*   **Proactive Gateway Switching:**  *Before* signal degradation, the controller instructs both the current and target gateways to establish a temporary bidirectional link (a short-duration, dedicated radio channel). Data is seamlessly transferred over this link. Once verified, the device is formally switched to the new gateway.
*   **Dynamic Routing Protocol:** Gateways utilize a lightweight, distributed routing protocol (e.g., OLSR or similar) to maintain up-to-date network topology information and adapt to gateway additions/removals.
*   **Gateway Prioritization:** The controller maintains a prioritized list of gateways for each edge device, considering signal strength, network load, and gateway type (core, edge, roaming). 
*   **Quality of Service (QoS) Profiles:** Support for defining QoS profiles for different edge devices, influencing gateway selection and handover prioritization. 

**Pseudocode (Controller - Predictive Handover):**

```
function predict_handover(device_id):
  signal_data = get_signal_data(device_id) // Historical signal data from nearby gateways
  device_velocity = calculate_velocity(signal_data)
  network_topology = get_current_topology()
  
  predicted_rssi = ML_Model.predict(signal_data, device_velocity, network_topology) // Predict future RSSI

  if predicted_rssi < handover_threshold:
    target_gateway = select_best_gateway(predicted_rssi) // Based on predicted signal, load, etc.
    current_gateway = get_current_gateway(device_id)

    establish_temp_link(current_gateway, target_gateway)
    verify_link_quality(current_gateway, target_gateway)

    command = "Switch to gateway " + target_gateway
    send_command_to_device(device_id, command)

    remove_device_from_gateway(device_id, current_gateway)
    add_device_to_gateway(device_id, target_gateway)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Gateways require multiple radio interfaces (e.g., two LoRa transceivers or a LoRa transceiver and a separate short-range radio) to support simultaneous communication with devices and mesh networking.
*   Increased gateway processing power to handle routing calculations and mesh management.
*   Enhanced gateway antenna systems to improve signal coverage and reliability.
