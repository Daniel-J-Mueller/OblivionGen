## Autonomous Robotic Item Relocation System – "Choreograph"

**System Overview:** This system extends the weight and motion sensing capabilities of the provided patent to enable fully autonomous item relocation within a shelving or storage environment. The core innovation is a predictive ‘choreography’ engine that anticipates user needs *before* they physically interact with items, proactively relocating them for optimal accessibility.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Enhanced Shelf Units:** Existing shelving equipped with an expanded array of weight sensors (at least one per 10cm x 10cm section of shelf space). Integration of low-power, wide-angle cameras (fish-eye lens) providing complete shelf coverage. Addition of miniature, low-friction robotic arms (2-3 per shelf, depending on shelf length) capable of lifting and moving small to medium-sized items (up to 5kg).
*   **Mobile Robotic Base:**  A small, wheeled robotic base integrated *underneath* each shelf unit. This provides movement along a pre-defined track or floor grid. Powered by inductive charging.
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** High-performance CPU cluster handling data processing, predictive modeling, and robotic control.
*   **Data Communication:** Wireless network (WiFi 6E or similar) for communication between shelf units, robotic bases, and the CPU.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Learning Module:**
    *   Data Input: Weight sensor data, camera imagery, historical interaction data (user ID, time, items accessed, sequence of access).
    *   Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. Trained to predict *future* item access based on past behavior.
    *   Output: Probability distribution of likely item access over a defined time horizon (e.g., next 30 minutes).
2.  **Choreography Engine:**
    *   Input: Probability distribution from the Behavioral Learning Module, current item locations, shelf space availability.
    *   Algorithm: A* pathfinding algorithm modified to consider robotic arm reach, item weight, and stability.  Simulates item relocation scenarios and optimizes for accessibility and safety.
    *   Output:  Relocation plan: sequence of robotic arm movements and shelf base movements.
3.  **Sensor Fusion & Object Recognition:**
    *   Camera data processed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify item types, quantities, and orientations.
    *   Weight data correlated with object recognition to improve accuracy.
4.  **Real-Time Control System:**
    *   Manages robotic arm movements and shelf base movements.
    *   Implements safety protocols (collision avoidance, weight limits).

**Pseudocode – Choreography Engine:**

```
function generateRelocationPlan(predictedAccess, currentLocations, shelfSpace):
  bestPlan = null
  minCost = infinity

  for each possible relocation sequence in permutations(predictedAccess):
    plan = []
    cost = 0

    for each item in sequence:
      # Find optimal path for robotic arm to reach item
      armPath = findArmPath(currentLocations[item], shelfSpace)
      cost += armPath.length

      # Calculate shelf base movement cost
      baseMovement = calculateBaseMovement(shelfSpace, item)
      cost += baseMovement.distance

      plan.append(armPath, baseMovement)

    if cost < minCost:
      minCost = cost
      bestPlan = plan

  return bestPlan
```

**Operational Scenario:**

A user routinely accesses tools A, B, and C in that order. The Behavioral Learning Module learns this pattern. *Before* the user reaches for tool A, the Choreography Engine proactively moves tool A to the most accessible location on the shelf, utilizing the robotic arm and potentially shifting the shelf itself. This minimizes the user's effort and time.

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   Integration with voice control.
*   Adaptive learning to accommodate new items or user behavior changes.
*   Multi-shelf coordination for complex item retrieval scenarios.
*   "Rummaging Prevention" mode - if the system detects a pattern of random item manipulation (suggesting the user is looking for something, but hasn't yet found it), it can suggest items based on the weight and movement data.
