## Haptic Texture Generation via Dynamic Capacitive Field Shaping

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple pressure-based activation to create dynamically changing haptic textures *without* physical movement of the device. This leverages the capacitive sensing layer to *actively shape* the electric field, simulating texture under a user's finger.

**Specifications:**

*   **Substrate:** Transparent substrate (glass or durable plastic) with an array of micro-wells. These wells are *shallower* than those described in the provided patent - think microscopic dimples. The density is high enough to allow for complex texture generation.
*   **Capacitive Sensing Layer:**  Instead of a static electrode, implement an array of individually addressable micro-electrodes *beneath* each micro-well. Each electrode's output voltage can be dynamically adjusted.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Texture Library:** A stored library of pre-defined haptic textures (e.g., wood grain, fabric, ridges, bumps). Each texture is represented as a voltage map for the micro-electrode array.
    *   **Real-time Texture Generation:** Algorithm to create new textures on the fly, based on user input or application requirements.
    *   **Proximity Sensing:** Utilize the capacitive sensing layer to detect the presence and position of a finger.
    *   **Adaptive Field Shaping:**  Based on finger position, the control system adjusts the voltage of each micro-electrode. This creates localized variations in the electric field, effectively "pulling" or "pushing" the finger to simulate texture.
*   **Power Management:** Optimize power consumption by only activating the micro-electrodes directly under the user's finger.

**Pseudocode (Texture Generation):**

```
// Input: desired_texture (string representing a texture from the library or algorithm parameters)
//        finger_position (x, y coordinates of the finger on the substrate)

function generate_texture(desired_texture, finger_position):
  if desired_texture is in texture_library:
    voltage_map = texture_library[desired_texture]
  else:
    // Dynamically generate voltage_map based on parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude)
    voltage_map = generate_dynamic_texture(desired_texture)

  // Calculate micro-electrode activation pattern based on finger position
  for each micro-electrode in electrode_array:
    distance = calculate_distance(micro-electrode.position, finger_position)
    if distance < activation_radius:
      electrode.voltage = voltage_map[electrode.index] // Apply voltage from texture map
    else:
      electrode.voltage = 0 // Deactivate electrode

  return electrode_array // Updated array with dynamically set voltages
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Electrode Shape:** Experiment with different electrode shapes (e.g., elongated, circular) to optimize the haptic effect.
*   **Material Properties:** Explore the use of different substrate materials with varying dielectric properties to enhance the electric field manipulation.
*   **Multi-Layered Approach:** Stack multiple capacitive sensing layers to create more complex haptic textures and increase the resolution.
*    **Temperature Variation:** Integrate micro-heaters beneath the electrodes to simulate temperature variations and create even more realistic textures.
