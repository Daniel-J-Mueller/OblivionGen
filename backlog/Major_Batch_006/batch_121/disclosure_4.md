## Dynamic Network Topology Prediction & Pre-Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the resource heat map system to *predict* future network congestion based on historical data and real-time traffic patterns, then proactively allocate resources (bandwidth, compute, storage) *before* bottlenecks occur. This moves beyond reactive visualization to proactive network optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Collect historical network traffic data (bandwidth usage, latency, packet loss) with timestamps.
    *   Ingest real-time traffic patterns from the same sources as the existing heat map.
    *   Capture application-level metadata (application ID, user ID, service tier) associated with network traffic.
*   **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network, Prophet) trained on historical data.
    *   Model should predict future bandwidth usage and latency for specific network links and application categories.
    *   Incorporate application-level metadata to refine predictions (e.g., predict increased traffic for a specific application due to scheduled maintenance).
    *   Real-time adjustment to predictions based on current traffic patterns.
*   **Pre-Allocation Mechanism:**
    *   Define resource allocation policies based on predicted congestion levels.
    *   Policies should specify thresholds for pre-allocation (e.g., pre-allocate 20% more bandwidth if predicted usage exceeds 80% of capacity).
    *   Integration with existing resource management systems (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenStack) to dynamically allocate resources.
    *   Resource pre-allocation can include:
        *   Bandwidth reservation on network devices.
        *   Scaling up compute instances or virtual machines.
        *   Provisioning additional storage capacity.
*   **Heat Map Integration:**
    *   Overlay predicted congestion levels onto the existing resource heat map.
    *   Visualize pre-allocated resources alongside current resource usage.
    *   Provide alerts when predicted congestion levels exceed predefined thresholds.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/predict_congestion`: Input: network link, time range. Output: predicted congestion level.
    *   `/allocate_resources`: Input: network link, resource type, amount. Output: success/failure.
    *   `/get_allocation_status`: Input: network link. Output: current resource allocation status.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_congestion(network_link, time_range):
    historical_data = get_historical_data(network_link)
    realtime_data = get_realtime_data(network_link)
    application_metadata = get_application_metadata(network_link)

    # Train time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM) on historical data
    model = train_model(historical_data)

    # Predict future bandwidth usage and latency
    predicted_usage = model.predict(realtime_data, time_range)

    # Refine prediction based on application metadata
    refined_usage = refine_prediction(predicted_usage, application_metadata)

    return refined_usage
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unexpected traffic patterns that deviate from historical norms.
*   **Automated Policy Adjustment:** Automatically adjust resource allocation policies based on real-time network conditions.
*   **Multi-Tenant Optimization:** Optimize resource allocation across multiple tenant accounts to maximize overall network efficiency.
