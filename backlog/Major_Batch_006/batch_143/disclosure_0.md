## Dynamic Schema Stitching via Event-Driven Micro-Resolvers

**Specification:** A system for constructing and dynamically updating GraphQL APIs using event-driven micro-resolvers. This builds on the concept of server-specified filters but extends it to dynamic schema adaptation.

**Core Concept:** Instead of static or resolver-bound filters, the schema itself becomes fluid. Micro-resolvers, small independent functions, subscribe to event streams. Events trigger updates to the available fields and types in the GraphQL schema *at runtime*. This allows for personalized APIs, adaptive data structures, and seamless integration of new data sources without schema redeployment.

**Components:**

*   **Schema Orchestrator:** Manages the overall GraphQL schema. It receives updates from micro-resolvers and merges them into a consolidated schema.
*   **Micro-Resolver Registry:** A central repository for registered micro-resolvers. Each resolver is associated with specific event types it listens for.
*   **Event Bus:** A publish/subscribe messaging system that facilitates communication between data sources and micro-resolvers.
*   **Dynamic Schema Store:**  An in-memory or distributed cache holding the current GraphQL schema definition.  Supports versioning and rollback.
*   **GraphQL Engine:** The standard GraphQL execution engine, utilizing the dynamically constructed schema from the Dynamic Schema Store.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Schema:** A base GraphQL schema is loaded into the Dynamic Schema Store.
2.  **Micro-Resolver Registration:** Micro-resolvers register with the Micro-Resolver Registry, specifying the events they're interested in.
3.  **Event Publication:** Data sources publish events to the Event Bus when data changes.
4.  **Event Handling:**  Micro-resolvers subscribe to relevant events. When an event arrives, the resolver executes.
5.  **Schema Modification:**  The micro-resolver generates schema modifications (additions, removals, type changes) as a Schema Definition Language (SDL) fragment.
6.  **Schema Orchestration:** The Schema Orchestrator receives the SDL fragment, validates it, and merges it into the current schema in the Dynamic Schema Store.
7.  **GraphQL Request Handling:**  The GraphQL Engine executes requests against the updated schema.

**Pseudocode (Micro-Resolver Example - Personalized User Profile)**

```
// Event: UserDataUpdated(userId, fieldName, newValue)

function handleUserDataUpdate(event) {
  const userId = event.userId;
  const fieldName = event.fieldName;
  const newValue = event.newValue;

  // Check if the user has a specific attribute
  if (userId === 'premiumUser' && fieldName === 'interests') {
    // Dynamically add a new field to the User type
    const sdlFragment = `
      type User {
        premiumFeatures: [String]
      }
    `;
    return sdlFragment; // Return SDL fragment for schema update
  }
  return null; // No schema update required
}

//Register this function with the Micro-Resolver Registry 
//Associated event type: UserDataUpdated
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Event:** `{ type: string, payload: object }`
*   **Micro-Resolver Registration:** `{ eventType: string, resolverFunction: function }`
*   **SDL Fragment:** A valid SDL snippet defining schema changes.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Distributed Schema Store:** Utilize a distributed cache for high availability and scalability.
*   **Asynchronous Schema Updates:** Process schema updates asynchronously to avoid blocking GraphQL requests.
*   **Event Prioritization:** Implement event prioritization to ensure critical updates are processed promptly.
*   **Schema Versioning:** Maintain a history of schema versions for rollback and auditing purposes.
