## Dynamic Precision Systolic Array

**Concept:** Expand the parallel processing capabilities of the systolic array by dynamically adjusting the precision of calculations within each processing element (PE) based on data sensitivity and resource availability.

**Specifications:**

*   **PE Architecture:** Each PE incorporates a configurable arithmetic logic unit (ALU) capable of operating at varying precision levels (e.g., FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4). This is accomplished via bit-width selection within the ALU.
*   **Sensitivity Analysis Module:** A small, dedicated module within each PE (or a central controller communicating precision adjustments) performs a local sensitivity analysis on incoming X-in and Y-in data. This analysis could utilize a simple metric like variance or range to determine data sensitivity. Alternatively, the sensitivity data could be pre-computed and supplied alongside the input data.
*   **Resource Monitoring:** A central controller monitors the resource utilization (power, area) of the array. This monitoring feeds into the precision adjustment algorithm.
*   **Precision Adjustment Algorithm:**  The core of the innovation. This algorithm, residing in the central controller (or distributed among PEs), determines the optimal precision level for each PE based on:
    *   **Data Sensitivity:** Higher sensitivity data warrants higher precision.
    *   **Resource Availability:**  When resources are constrained, precision is reduced to conserve power and area.
    *   **Error Accumulation Mitigation:** A feedback loop monitors the accumulated error across the array. If error exceeds a threshold, precision is increased.
*   **Data Tagging:** Input data is tagged with a 'sensitivity level' indicator. This tag propagates through the array, influencing precision adjustments at each PE.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  A modified communication protocol is required to transmit the sensitivity level tags alongside the data. This could involve adding a few extra bits to the data stream.

**Pseudocode (Central Controller):**

```
// Initialization
sensitivity_threshold = 0.5;
resource_threshold = 0.8; // 80% utilization
error_threshold = 0.01;

loop for each PE in array:
    PE.precision = default_precision // e.g., FP16

loop for each data batch:
    for each PE in array:
        data_sensitivity = analyze_data(PE.X_in, PE.Y_in);
        resource_utilization = monitor_resources();

        if data_sensitivity > sensitivity_threshold and resource_utilization < resource_threshold:
            PE.precision = high_precision // e.g., FP32
        elif data_sensitivity < sensitivity_threshold and resource_utilization > resource_threshold:
            PE.precision = low_precision // e.g., INT8
        else:
            //Maintain current precision
            pass

        //Error accumulation monitoring and adjustment (simplified)
        accumulated_error = calculate_error();
        if accumulated_error > error_threshold:
            increase_precision_across_array();
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Performance/Efficiency Trade-off:** Adaptively adjust precision to optimize performance without sacrificing accuracy.
*   **Reduced Power Consumption:** Lower precision calculations consume less power.
*   **Increased Array Capacity:** Smaller precision operations enable a higher density of PEs.
*   **Robustness to Data Variations:** Dynamic precision adjustment handles varying data sensitivity levels effectively.
