## Adaptive Acoustic Zones

**Concept:** Leverage the signaling mechanism of the patent (external device indicating intent to speak) to dynamically create localized acoustic zones that prioritize voice input while minimizing background noise capture. This extends beyond simple muting and attenuation; it’s about *shaping* the audio environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Voice-controlled device equipped with a microphone array (minimum 4 mics, optimally 8+) for beamforming and spatial audio analysis.
    *   External signaling device (button, soft button, app) – communicates wirelessly with the voice-controlled device.
    *   Optional: Small, low-power directional speakers integrated into the voice-controlled device or as add-on modules.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Signal Reception & Zone Activation:** Upon receiving the signal from the external device, the system initiates a “listening zone” creation process.
    *   **Spatial Audio Mapping:** The microphone array performs real-time spatial audio mapping to identify the direction of the signaling device (assumes the user is proximate to the signaler).
    *   **Dynamic Beamforming:**  The system dynamically adjusts beamforming parameters to create a focused "listening beam" pointed towards the identified user location.  The beam dynamically tracks slight movements.
    *   **Noise Cancellation/Suppression:**  Simultaneously, the algorithm implements targeted noise cancellation, attenuating sounds *outside* the listening beam.  This isn't broad noise reduction; it's *directional* suppression.
    *   **Acoustic Shielding (Optional):** The directional speakers can emit low-level, phase-inverted sound waves to create an "acoustic shield" that further minimizes noise from specific directions.  This is a more aggressive approach.
    *   **Zone Persistence & Timeout:** The listening zone persists for a predetermined duration after the voice command is detected or until a timeout is reached.  A subsequent signal reactivates the zone.
    *   **Learning & Adaptation:** The system learns user preferences (typical locations, voice characteristics) and adapts zone creation parameters accordingly.
*   **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    // Upon receiving signal from external device
    function onSignalReceived() {
        // 1. Spatial Audio Mapping
        userLocation = mapSpatialAudio();

        // 2. Dynamic Beamforming
        setBeamformingDirection(userLocation);

        // 3. Noise Cancellation
        attenuateNoiseOutsideBeam();

        // 4. Optional Acoustic Shielding
        if (userPrefersShielding) {
            activateAcousticShield(userLocation);
        }

        // 5. Start Voice Activity Detection
        startVoiceActivityDetection();
    }

    function startVoiceActivityDetection() {
        //Monitor microphone for voice input
        //When voice detected, process command
        //After command processed, deactivate acoustic zone or wait for new signal
    }
    ```

**Refinement:** The Acoustic Shielding aspect could be augmented with ultrasonic frequencies, imperceptible to humans, to create a more effective barrier. Integration with smart home systems would allow the system to automatically adjust zone creation based on room occupancy and activity.
