## Dynamic Resource ‘Ecosystem’ Visualization

**Concept:** Extend the heat map visualization beyond static resource states to represent a dynamic ‘ecosystem’ of resource dependencies and impacts, visualized as a force-directed graph layered *over* the heat map.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** Resource metrics (as in the patent) + Dependency Map. The Dependency Map defines relationships between resources. (e.g., Application X depends on Database Y, Server A hosts Application X, Network connection B is critical for Server A). Dependencies can be explicitly defined by an administrator *or* automatically discovered via network traffic analysis & application profiling.
*   **Graph Generation:**
    *   Resources are nodes in a force-directed graph.
    *   Dependencies are edges connecting nodes. Edge weight represents the strength/criticality of the dependency (e.g., high transaction rate = strong dependency).
    *   Force-directed layout algorithm (e.g., ForceAtlas2) positions nodes based on dependency strength – strong dependencies pull nodes closer, weak dependencies have less influence.
*   **Layering & Interaction:**
    *   The force-directed graph is rendered *over* the existing heat map.  Heat map color indicates resource status (CPU, Memory, etc.).
    *   Users can toggle graph visibility.
    *   Clicking a node (resource) highlights:
        *   The resource on the heat map.
        *   All dependent/connected resources in the graph.
        *   A panel displaying detailed metrics for the selected resource *and* its dependencies.
*   **‘Impact Analysis’ Mode:**
    *   Simulate resource failures or performance degradation.
    *   The graph dynamically updates to visualize the ‘ripple effect’ of the failure on dependent resources.
    *   Color-coding on edges indicates impact severity (e.g., red = critical impact, yellow = moderate, green = minimal).
*   **Algorithm Pseudocode (Impact Analysis):**

    ```
    function calculate_impact(failed_resource, dependency_map, metrics):
        impact_map = {}
        queue = [failed_resource]
        visited = set()

        while queue:
            current_resource = queue.pop(0)

            if current_resource in visited:
                continue
            visited.add(current_resource)

            impact_score = 0  // Initial impact score
            if metrics[current_resource]["CPU"] > threshold OR metrics[current_resource]["Memory"] > threshold:
               impact_score = 1 //set to 1
            
            impact_map[current_resource] = impact_score

            for dependent_resource, dependency_strength in dependency_map[current_resource].items():
                impact_map[dependent_resource] = dependency_strength * impact_map[current_resource] 
                queue.append(dependent_resource)

        return impact_map
    ```

*   **Display Considerations:**
    *   Graph node size/color can reflect resource importance/utilization.
    *   Edge thickness/color can reflect dependency strength/impact.
    *   Implement zoom/pan functionality for large-scale environments.
    *   Consider using a 3D visualization for complex dependencies.

*   **Data Storage:** Dependency map can be stored as a graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) for efficient querying and updates.
