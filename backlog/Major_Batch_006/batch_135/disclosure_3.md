## Adaptive Constraint Relaxation via Simulated Annealing

**Concept:** Extend the decision constraint handling by dynamically adjusting constraint severity during the sequential decision process, leveraging a simulated annealing approach to explore solutions beyond initially defined bounds. The core idea is to temporarily "relax" constraints to allow exploration of potentially superior long-term outcomes, then gradually "re-tighten" them as the model gains confidence.

**Specs:**

1.  **Constraint Profile Definition:**
    *   Each decision constraint is associated with a 'severity' parameter (initial value = 1.0).
    *   A 'relaxation schedule' defines how severity decreases over time (e.g., exponential decay, linear decrease).
    *   A 're-tightening schedule' defines how severity increases back to 1.0, based on observed performance.

2.  **Constraint Evaluation Function:**
    *   Modify the constraint evaluation to incorporate severity: `Constraint_Value = Original_Value * Severity`.
    *   A constraint is considered satisfied if `Constraint_Value <= Threshold`.

3.  **Simulated Annealing Integration:**
    *   Introduce a 'temperature' parameter (initial value = 1.0).
    *   During the evaluation of feasible options, allow constraint violations with a probability proportional to `exp(-Violation_Severity / Temperature)`.
    *   Decrease the temperature over time (e.g., geometric cooling).
    *   Violation Severity = Absolute(Constraint_Value - Threshold)

4.  **Performance Feedback Loop:**
    *   After each decision implementation, quantify the impact on overall sequence performance.
    *   If performance improves after a constraint violation, increase the severity of that constraint slowly.
    *   If performance degrades, decrease the severity of that constraint slowly.

5.  **Pseudocode (Integration within existing claim 1 framework):**

```
// Within the "identifying the set of feasible options" step:

function evaluate_option(option, constraints, severity_profiles):
  for each constraint in constraints:
    constraint_value = calculate_constraint_value(option, constraint)
    adjusted_constraint_value = constraint_value * severity_profiles[constraint]
    if adjusted_constraint_value > constraint_threshold:
      // Apply probabilistic acceptance based on temperature
      acceptance_probability = exp(-(adjusted_constraint_value - constraint_threshold) / current_temperature)
      if random() > acceptance_probability:
        return False // Option not feasible
  return True // Option feasible

// After each decision and result quantification:
function update_constraint_severities(quantified_result, constraint_severities):
  for each constraint:
    if quantified_result > previous_best_result:
      constraint_severities[constraint] = min(1.0, constraint_severities[constraint] + learning_rate)
    else:
      constraint_severities[constraint] = max(0.1, constraint_severities[constraint] - learning_rate) // Prevent severity from dropping too low

current_temperature = initial_temperature
learning_rate = 0.01
```

6.  **Data Requirements:**
    *   Historical data on constraint violations and corresponding performance impacts.
    *   Parameter tuning for temperature schedule, learning rate, and severity profiles.

7.  **Potential Applications:**
    *   Optimization of complex systems with conflicting constraints (e.g., resource allocation, scheduling).
    *   Personalized decision-making where constraints represent user preferences or risk tolerance.
    *   Adaptive control systems that can dynamically adjust behavior in response to changing conditions.
