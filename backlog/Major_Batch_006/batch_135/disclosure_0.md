## Dynamic Content Stitching for Multi-Device Experiences

**Concept:** Extend the idea of transferring webpage content to a user device by *dynamically stitching* content from multiple webpages based on user interaction *before* transfer. This creates a personalized, consolidated 'document' optimized for the target device.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Functionality:**

*   **Interaction Monitoring:** The client computing system monitors user interaction with webpages – specifically, links clicked, text selected, form data entered, and time spent on specific content sections.
*   **Dependency Mapping:**  A background process (or cloud service) dynamically maps dependencies between webpages visited during a browsing session. This could involve analyzing link structures, shared resources, and semantic relationships between content.
*   **Content Aggregation Request:** Upon detecting a 'cohesive browsing session' (defined by a minimum number of linked pages and duration), the client proposes a 'content aggregation' to the user.  This is presented as a GUI element – a "Create Reading View" or "Consolidate Session" button.
*   **Dynamic Stitching:** If the user accepts, the system fetches content from the identified webpages, strips away extraneous elements (navigation, ads, etc.), and stitches the relevant sections together into a single, unified document.  This happens *before* transfer to the target device.
*   **Format Optimization:**  The stitched document is then formatted for the target device (e-reader, tablet, phone, etc.). This includes text reflowing, image resizing, and potentially, converting to a specific file format (ePub, PDF, etc.).

**2. Technical Details:**

*   **Client-Side Component:** JavaScript module integrated into the browser.  Handles interaction monitoring, dependency mapping (initial phase), and communication with the server.
*   **Server-Side Component:**
    *   **Dependency Resolution Service:** Advanced algorithm to determine content dependencies based on URL structure, semantic analysis (using NLP techniques), and link analysis.
    *   **Content Extraction & Transformation Engine:**  Responsible for fetching content, stripping away unwanted elements, and transforming it into a unified format. Utilizes headless browsers for rendering and extraction.
    *   **Format Conversion Service:** Converts the unified content into various formats optimized for different devices.

**3. Pseudocode (Client-Side - Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
// Event Listener for User Interactions (clicks, selections, etc.)
onUserInteraction(event) {
  recordInteraction(event);
  updateDependencyMap();

  if (isCohesiveSession()) {
    displayContentAggregationPrompt();
  }
}

function isCohesiveSession() {
  // Check for minimum number of pages visited
  // Check for minimum session duration
  // Check for a strong dependency graph (linked pages)
  return (pageCount > 2 && sessionDuration > 60 && dependencyGraph.strength > 0.7);
}

function displayContentAggregationPrompt() {
  // Display GUI element "Create Reading View"
  onPromptAccept() {
    sendAggregationRequestToServer();
  }
}

function sendAggregationRequestToServer() {
  // Send URL list, interaction data, and target device info to server
}

function receiveAggregatedContent(content) {
  // Display or download aggregated content to target device
}
```

**4. Innovation & Differentiation:**

*   **Proactive Content Consolidation:** Unlike simply transferring a single webpage, this system anticipates user needs and proactively consolidates related content.
*   **Dynamic Dependency Mapping:** The system doesn’t rely on pre-defined relationships between webpages; it dynamically discovers them based on user interaction.
*   **Personalized Reading Experience:** The aggregated content is tailored to the user’s browsing history and interests.
*   **Cross-Device Consistency:** The system ensures a consistent reading experience across different devices.
