## Adaptive Notification ‘Bubbles’ – Spatial Audio & Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend notification intensity adjustment beyond volume/vibration to create localized, spatially aware ‘bubbles’ of sensory information around the device. This aims to minimize disruption to others and maximize user awareness in complex environments.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-directional Speaker Array:** Minimum 4, ideally 8+ micro-speakers integrated into device edges. Each speaker individually addressable.
*   **Localized Haptic Actuators:** Array of small, individually controllable haptic actuators (e.g., linear resonant actuators - LRAs) distributed across device surfaces. Density: 1 actuator per 2cm².
*   **Environmental Sensor Fusion:** Utilize existing sensors (microphone, camera, light, orientation, location) + dedicated short-range proximity sensors (IR/ultrasonic) to build a dynamic environmental map.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for real-time environmental analysis and bubble rendering.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Environmental Mapping Module:**
    *   Input: Sensor data (audio, visual, proximity, orientation, location).
    *   Output: 3D map of surrounding environment (obstacles, people, surfaces).  Object recognition (identifying people, furniture, etc.).  Sound source localization.
    *   Algorithm: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) + object detection (YOLO, SSD).
*   **Notification Bubble Renderer:**
    *   Input: Notification data (type, priority, sender).  Environmental map. User preferences.
    *   Output: Control signals for speaker array and haptic actuators.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   **Spatial Audio Beamforming:** Direct audio beam towards user’s estimated ear position, minimizing sound leakage to others.
        *   **Haptic Pattern Generation:** Create localized haptic patterns on device surface closest to user's touch/grip. Patterns indicate notification priority (e.g., fast pulse for urgent, slow wave for low priority).
        *   **Dynamic Bubble Shaping:** Adjust bubble size and intensity based on environmental context. (e.g., smaller, quieter bubble in quiet environments, larger, more intense bubble in noisy environments).
*   **User Preference Management:**
    *   Allow users to customize bubble characteristics (size, intensity, haptic patterns) for different notification types and contexts.
    *   “Privacy Mode”:  Disable spatial audio beamforming and reduce haptic intensity for sensitive notifications.
*   **Adaptive Learning Module:** Machine learning algorithm (Reinforcement Learning) to learn user preferences and optimize bubble characteristics over time.  Takes into account user interactions (e.g., dismissing notifications, adjusting volume) and environmental feedback.

**3. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// On Notification Received
function handleNotification(notificationData) {
    environmentalMap = getEnvironmentalMap();
    userPreferences = getUserPreferences(notificationData.type);

    // Determine optimal bubble characteristics
    bubbleSize = calculateBubbleSize(environmentalMap, userPreferences);
    audioIntensity = calculateAudioIntensity(environmentalMap, userPreferences);
    hapticPattern = generateHapticPattern(notificationData.priority, userPreferences);

    // Render notification bubble
    renderAudioBubble(audioIntensity, bubbleSize);
    renderHapticBubble(hapticPattern, bubbleSize);
}

function renderAudioBubble(intensity, size) {
    // Calculate speaker array output based on intensity and size
    // Use beamforming to direct sound towards user's ears
}

function renderHapticBubble(pattern, size) {
    // Activate haptic actuators in a pattern corresponding to notification priority
    // Adjust actuator intensity and duration based on size
}
```

**4. Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** Implement safeguards to prevent audio/haptic leakage to unintended recipients.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide alternative notification methods for users with hearing or tactile impairments.
*   **Power Consumption:** Optimize algorithms to minimize power usage.
*   **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with existing notification systems.
