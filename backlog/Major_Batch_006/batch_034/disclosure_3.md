## Dynamic Intent Weaving with Multi-Modal Anchoring

**Concept:** Extend the intent re-ranking system to not only consider contextual *data* (application, device type) but also *active sensory input* as a dynamically weighted anchor for intent disambiguation. This creates a "weaving" effect where the system anticipates and adjusts to the user's immediate environment, not just historical or displayed context.

**Specifications:**

**1. Multi-Modal Input Layer:**

*   **Sensory Input Streams:** Integrate real-time data from device sensors:
    *   **Microphone:** Ambient sound analysis (e.g., speech, music, environmental noises).
    *   **Camera:** Visual scene understanding (object detection, activity recognition â€“ is the user cooking, driving, etc.).
    *   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** Device motion/orientation (stationary, walking, running, driving).
    *   **GPS:** Location data (indoor/outdoor, points of interest).
*   **Feature Extraction:**  Each input stream feeds into dedicated feature extractors:
    *   *Audio:*  MFCCs, spectral centroid, noise level.
    *   *Vision:*  Object classes, scene types, activity labels, dominant colors.
    *   *IMU:* Acceleration, angular velocity, orientation.
    *   *GPS:* Latitude, longitude, altitude, proximity to POIs.

**2.  Dynamic Weighting System:**

*   **Attention Mechanism:** Implement an attention mechanism to dynamically weigh the contribution of each contextual factor (displayed content, application type, sensory input).  The weights are determined by a learned model (e.g., a neural network).
*   **Context Vector Fusion:**  Combine the feature vectors from all contextual sources (displayed content, application, sensory input) into a unified context vector.

**3. Intent Hypothesis Generation & Re-Ranking:**

*   **Initial Hypothesis List:** Generate an initial list of intent hypotheses using NLU (as in the base patent).
*   **Contextual Scoring:**  Score each intent hypothesis based on its similarity to the fused context vector.  Similarity can be measured using cosine similarity or other appropriate metrics.
*   **Re-Ranking:** Re-rank the intent hypotheses based on the contextual scores, giving higher weight to the intents that are most consistent with the dynamic context.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Implement an adaptive threshold for intent confidence.  If the highest-ranked intent's confidence score is below the threshold, trigger a disambiguation prompt (e.g., "Did you mean X or Y?").

**4. Pseudocode (Re-Ranking Algorithm):**

```
function reRankIntents(intentHypotheses, contextVector):
  scoredIntents = []
  for intent in intentHypotheses:
    similarityScore = cosineSimilarity(intent.embedding, contextVector)
    scoredIntents.append((intent, similarityScore))

  sortedIntents = sorted(scoredIntents, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  return sortedIntents
```

**5.  Model Training & Adaptation:**

*   **Training Data:**  Collect a large dataset of user interactions with labeled contextual information (displayed content, application, sensory input, and confirmed intents).
*   **Model Architecture:**  Employ a neural network (e.g., a transformer-based model) to learn the relationships between context and intent.
*   **Continuous Learning:**  Implement a continuous learning mechanism to adapt the model to changing user preferences and environments. This could involve fine-tuning the model on new data or using reinforcement learning to optimize the weighting system.



**Novelty:**  This goes beyond static context by incorporating *active sensory input* to create a truly dynamic and responsive intent understanding system. The dynamic weighting system allows the system to adapt to the user's immediate environment and prioritize the most relevant contextual factors.
