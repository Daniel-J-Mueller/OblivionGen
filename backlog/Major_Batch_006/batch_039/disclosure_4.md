## Temporal Database Shadowing & Predictive Restoration

**Concept:** Extend the restoration point visualization to include *predicted* restoration points based on current database behavior and anticipated failure modes. Create a dynamic “shadow” of the database, running lightweight analysis to extrapolate potential future states, and offer restoration options to these projected states.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Behavioral Analyzer:** Continuously monitors database workload (query types, data modification patterns, transaction rates, resource usage) and builds a behavioral profile. This profile is updated in real-time.
*   **Failure Mode Library:** A pre-defined set of potential failure scenarios (disk failure, network partition, application bug, data corruption, etc.). Each scenario is associated with a probable impact on database state.  This is extensible via user configuration and automated analysis of past incidents.
*   **State Extrapolator:**  Combines the behavioral profile and failure mode library to project potential database states at various points in the future.  This is *not* a full simulation, but a lightweight analysis focusing on key data structures and indexes. It generates a probability score for each projected state.
*   **Shadow Database:** A minimal, in-memory representation of critical database structures.  Used by the State Extrapolator to quickly assess the impact of failure scenarios without impacting production performance.
*   **Predictive Visualization Engine:** Extends the existing graphical representation to include projected restoration points, color-coded by probability.  Users can toggle between historical and predictive views.
*   **Risk Assessment Module:** Calculates a risk score for each potential failure mode based on historical data and current system health.  Alerts users to high-risk scenarios.

**II. Data Structures:**

*   **Behavioral Profile:**  A time-series database storing key performance indicators (KPIs) and workload characteristics.
*   **Failure Mode Record:**  {Failure Type, Probability, Impacted Data Structures, Recovery Procedure, Risk Score}
*   **Projected State Record:**  {Timestamp, Probability, Impacted Data Structures, Projected Data State, Recommended Restoration Point}

**III. Workflow & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Behavioral Analyzer collects data and updates Behavioral Profile.
2.  **State Extrapolation (Every N Seconds):**
    ```pseudocode
    FOR each FailureMode IN FailureModeLibrary:
      riskScore = calculateRiskScore(FailureMode, BehavioralProfile)
      IF riskScore > threshold:
        projectedState = extrapolateState(FailureMode, BehavioralProfile, ShadowDatabase)
        addProjectedState(projectedState)
    ```
3.  **Visualization Update:** Predictive Visualization Engine renders historical and projected restoration points.
4.  **User Interaction:** User selects a projected restoration point.
5.  **Restoration Execution:**  System performs restoration to the selected projected state. This might involve rolling back transactions, restoring from a snapshot, or applying a series of compensating actions.

**IV.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Automated Failure Injection:**  Simulate failures in a staging environment to validate the accuracy of the State Extrapolator and refine the Failure Mode Library.
*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:**  Use machine learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns in database behavior that might indicate an impending failure.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:**  Suggest restoration points based on the user’s role and priorities.
*   **Integration with Incident Management Systems:** Automatically create incident tickets when a high-risk failure scenario is detected.
*   **Cost Analysis:** Estimate the cost of restoring to different points in time, taking into account data loss, downtime, and recovery effort.
