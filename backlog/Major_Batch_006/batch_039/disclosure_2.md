## Dynamic OTP 'Lifespan' Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Enhance OTP security and usability by dynamically adjusting the OTP validity window – not just based on time, but on real-time user behavioral biometrics. This moves beyond pre-defined intervals and introduces a self-adjusting security layer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module (BDCM):**

*   **Input:** Real-time user interaction data – keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, errors), mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns), scrolling behavior, touchscreen interactions (pressure, area, speed).
*   **Processing:**  Employ machine learning models (e.g., LSTM networks, Hidden Markov Models) to establish a baseline ‘behavioral profile’ for each user.  This profile captures typical interaction patterns.
*   **Output:**  A ‘Behavioral Risk Score’ (BRS) ranging from 0-100. Lower scores indicate higher confidence in user authenticity; higher scores suggest anomalous behavior.  BRS updates continuously.

**2. Dynamic OTP Generator (DOG):**

*   **Input:** BRS from BDCM, desired security level (configurable by admin), a base OTP validity window (e.g., 30 seconds), a sensitivity factor (adjusts how much BRS influences OTP lifespan).
*   **Processing:**
    *   `OTP_Lifespan = Base_Lifespan * (1 + (BRS / 100) * Sensitivity_Factor)`
    *   If BRS is very low (e.g., <20), `OTP_Lifespan` can be extended significantly.  If BRS is high (e.g., >80), `OTP_Lifespan` is drastically reduced (even to a few seconds).
    *   Generate a standard OTP using existing algorithms (TOTP, HOTP) but assign the dynamically calculated `OTP_Lifespan`.
*   **Output:**  OTP with associated `OTP_Lifespan`.

**3. Verification System Integration:**

*   **Modification to Existing System:** Integrate with the current verification process.  Upon receiving an OTP, the system *first* checks the `OTP_Lifespan`. If expired, the OTP is rejected, *regardless* of the code’s correctness.
*   **Behavioral Data Collection Trigger:** Upon an OTP submission attempt, trigger the BDCM to collect and analyze current user behavior.  The resulting BRS is used to assess the validity of *subsequent* OTP attempts.  (This creates a feedback loop).

**4.  Anomaly Detection and Adaptive Security:**

*   **Real-time Analysis:** Monitor BRS trends. Sudden, significant deviations from the user’s baseline indicate potential compromise.
*   **Adaptive Measures:**
    *   **Challenge Increase:**  If BRS is consistently high, prompt the user for a secondary authentication factor (e.g., biometrics, security question).
    *   **Account Lockout:**  In extreme cases of anomalous behavior, temporarily lock the account.
    *   **Dynamic Sensitivity Adjustment:**  Adjust the `Sensitivity_Factor` based on historical BRS data and observed risk levels.

**Pseudocode (Verification Process):**

```
function verifyOTP(otp, timestamp):
  otpLifespan = getOTPLifespan(otp)
  if (timestamp > (otpCreationTimestamp + otpLifespan)):
    return "OTP Expired"

  brs = collectBehavioralDataAndAnalyze()
  if (brs > threshold):
    requireSecondaryAuthentication()

  if (verifyOTPCode(otp)):
    return "Authentication Successful"
  else:
    return "Invalid OTP Code"
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   Requires robust behavioral data collection infrastructure.
*   Privacy concerns need to be addressed (data anonymization, user consent).
*   Machine learning models require continuous training and updates to maintain accuracy.
*   System performance needs to be optimized to minimize latency.
