## Adaptive Workspace Illumination & Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Extend the projected visual cues to incorporate dynamic, localized workspace illumination and haptic feedback, creating a multi-sensory guidance system. This moves beyond simple visual direction to actively *shape* the worker’s interaction with the items and workstation.

**Specs:**

*   **Illumination System:** Array of micro-LEDs embedded within the workstation surface, capable of projecting localized light pools and patterns.  Density: 50 LEDs per square foot.  Color range: RGB + UV (for material verification).  Brightness: Adjustable 0-1000 lux.
*   **Haptic System:**  Array of micro-vibrators (piezoelectric actuators) embedded beneath the workstation surface.  Spatial resolution: 1 cm.  Amplitude: Adjustable 0-5G.  Frequency: 10-200 Hz.
*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate existing imaging sensors with:
    *   **Depth Sensors:** Time-of-flight sensors for real-time 3D reconstruction of the workspace.
    *   **Force/Torque Sensors:** Embedded within workstation supports to detect worker interaction forces.
    *   **Ambient Light Sensors:**  Adjust illumination intensity based on surrounding conditions.
*   **Control System Enhancements:**
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Leverage machine learning to predict worker actions based on item locations and task progress.
    *   **Dynamic Cue Generation:**  Generate illumination and haptic cues in real-time based on predictive models and sensor data.
    *   **User Profiles:** Store user preferences for cue intensity, color, and haptic patterns.
    *   **API Integration:**  Allow external systems (e.g., warehouse management systems) to trigger specific cues.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition Module:** Handles data from all sensors.
    2.  **World Modeling Module:** Creates and maintains a 3D model of the workstation and items.
    3.  **Task Planning Module:**  Decomposes the item-handling task into a sequence of sub-tasks.
    4.  **Cue Generation Module:**  Generates illumination and haptic cues based on task progress and worker actions.
    5.  **Control Module:**  Controls the illumination and haptic systems.

**Operational Example:**

1.  Worker needs to select a “Fragile” box.
2.  Imaging system identifies available boxes.
3.  Control system activates a pulsing blue light pool *underneath* the “Fragile” box. Simultaneously, a gentle, rhythmic vibration pattern is applied to the surface surrounding the box.
4.  As the worker’s hand approaches, the light pool brightens and the vibration frequency increases, guiding the worker's grasp.
5.  If the worker reaches for the wrong box, the system activates a red light flash *around* the incorrect box and a distinct vibration pattern to discourage the action.

**Pseudocode (Cue Generation Module):**

```
function generate_cues(task_state, worker_hand_position, item_locations):
    cues = {}

    # Identify target item
    target_item = task_state.get_target_item()

    if target_item:
        # Generate illumination cue
        cues["illumination"] = {
            "item_id": target_item.id,
            "color": "blue",
            "intensity": 1000,
            "pattern": "pulsing"
        }

        # Generate haptic cue
        cues["haptic"] = {
            "item_id": target_item.id,
            "frequency": 50,
            "amplitude": 2,
            "pattern": "rhythmic"
        }

    # Check for incorrect actions
    for item in item_locations:
        if item != target_item and worker_hand_position is near(item):
            cues["illumination"] = {
                "item_id": item.id,
                "color": "red",
                "intensity": 500,
                "pattern": "flash"
            }
            cues["haptic"] = {
                "item_id": item.id,
                "frequency": 200,
                "amplitude": 4,
                "pattern": "static"
            }
    return cues
```
