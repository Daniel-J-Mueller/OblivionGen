## Dynamic Keymap Sharding & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the keymap coordinator system to dynamically shard keymaps across multiple coordinators *and* proactively prefetch keymap information based on access patterns and predictive analytics.

**Specification:**

**1. Sharding Algorithm:**

*   **Input:**  Total number of keys, number of available keymap coordinators.
*   **Process:** Implement a consistent hashing algorithm (e.g., Jump Consistent Hash) to distribute keys across the keymap coordinators. This ensures minimal key movement during coordinator scaling or failure.
*   **Metadata:** Maintain a global metadata service that maps each key (or key range) to its responsible coordinator.  This metadata service must be highly available and scalable.
*   **Coordinator Role:** Each keymap coordinator is responsible for a subset of the keymap.  They manage their local cache and handle requests for keys within their assigned shard.

**2. Predictive Prefetching Engine:**

*   **Data Collection:**  Monitor key access patterns at the keymap coordinators.  Collect statistics on key access frequency, time of access, and sequential access patterns.
*   **Predictive Model:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future key access patterns.
*   **Prefetching Trigger:**  When the predictive model identifies a high probability of access for keys *not* currently cached, issue a prefetch request to the appropriate keymap coordinator.
*   **Cache Population:** The target keymap coordinator populates its cache with the prefetched keymap information.
*   **Prefetch Prioritization:**  Prioritize prefetches based on predicted access frequency, latency of accessing the keymap information source, and available cache space.  Use a cost-benefit analysis to determine which keys to prefetch.

**3. Request Routing & Coordination:**

*   **Initial Request:** When a client requests keymap information, the request is first routed to a “front-end” router.
*   **Shard Lookup:** The front-end router consults the global metadata service to determine the responsible keymap coordinator for the requested key.
*   **Request Forwarding:**  The front-end router forwards the request to the appropriate coordinator.
*   **Cache Hit/Miss:** The coordinator checks its local cache.
    *   **Hit:**  Return the cached keymap information.
    *   **Miss:** Fetch the keymap information from the keymap information source, populate the cache, and return the information.

**4.  Cache Invalidation & Consistency:**

*   **Write Propagation:** When keymap information is modified, propagate the changes to all relevant caches. Implement a write-invalidate or write-update strategy.
*   **Version Tracking:**  Associate each cached keymap entry with a version number.  Increment the version number whenever the entry is modified.  Clients can request the current version to ensure they have the latest information.
*   **Lease Mechanism:** Utilize a lease mechanism. Keymap coordinators obtain leases for cached keymap entries. When a lease expires, the coordinator must revalidate the cache entry.

**Pseudocode (Keymap Coordinator - Predictive Prefetching):**

```
function handleReadRequest(key):
  if key in cache:
    return cache[key]
  else:
    // Check predictive prefetch queue
    if key in prefetchQueue:
      // Key is being prefetched
      // Wait for prefetch to complete, then return
      waitForPrefetch(key)
      return cache[key]
    else:
      // Key not cached or being prefetched
      keymapInfo = fetchKeymapInfo(key)
      cache[key] = keymapInfo
      return keymapInfo

function backgroundPrefetching():
  while true:
    // Get next key to prefetch from predictive model
    nextKey = predictiveModel.getNextKey()
    if nextKey != null:
      if nextKey not in cache:
        keymapInfo = fetchKeymapInfo(nextKey)
        cache[nextKey] = keymapInfo
```

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   **Horizontal Scaling:**  Add more keymap coordinators to handle increasing load.
*   **Replication:** Replicate the global metadata service and keymap information sources.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Implement failover mechanisms for keymap coordinators and metadata services.
