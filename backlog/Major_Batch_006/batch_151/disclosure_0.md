## Dynamic Interest Graph Projection

**Concept:** Augment search results with a dynamically generated, visually navigable "interest graph" that projects user interests not just based on current & prior queries, but also *predicted* future interests based on trending collective behavior. This isn't merely a recommendation engine; it’s a proactive interest explorer.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Processing:**

*   **Query Stream:** Continuous ingestion of anonymized search queries.
*   **Collective Behavior Analysis:**  Real-time analysis of query patterns to identify emerging trends (“heat signatures”). Weighting factors based on query volume, velocity, and novelty.
*   **User Profile Construction:** Maintain a dynamic user profile based on:
    *   Explicit search history.
    *   Implicit behavior (dwell time on results, click-through rates, shares).
    *   Predicted interests (see section 3).
*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Utilize an existing or custom-built knowledge graph to represent entities and relationships between concepts.  This provides context and enables exploration beyond keyword matching.

**2. Interest Graph Generation:**

*   **Node Representation:** Nodes represent entities, concepts, or product categories. Node size & color intensity reflects relevance to user profile and trending data.
*   **Edge Representation:** Edges represent relationships between nodes. Edge weight & style indicate strength & type of relationship (e.g., "related to", "used with", "alternative to"). Relationships derived from knowledge graph *and* co-occurrence in search queries.
*   **Dynamic Layout:**  Graph layout adjusts based on user interaction. Nodes of immediate interest move closer to the center; less relevant nodes move further away.  Force-directed graph layout algorithm optimized for real-time updates.
*   **Projection:**  Limit graph complexity by projecting only the most relevant portion of the full interest graph.  Thresholding based on edge weight and node relevance.

**3. Predictive Interest Modeling:**

*   **Temporal Analysis:**  Analyze historical query data to identify sequential patterns (e.g., "users who searched for X also searched for Y within a week").
*   **Collective Shift Detection:** Monitor changes in collective search behavior to identify emerging interests that haven’t yet surfaced in individual profiles.
*   **Interest Propagation:** Predict potential user interests by propagating signals from trending collective interests to similar user profiles.  Bayesian network model for interest inference.
*   **"Surprise Me" Feature:** Algorithmically identify interests that are highly relevant but unexpected, based on user profile and collective trends.

**4. User Interface (UI) Integration:**

*   **Interactive Canvas:** Display the projected interest graph as an interactive canvas alongside search results.
*   **Node Exploration:** Clicking a node expands it, revealing related nodes and detailed information (e.g., product listings, articles, videos).
*   **Filtering & Sorting:** Allow users to filter and sort nodes based on relevance, price, rating, or other criteria.
*   **Personalization Options:** Allow users to customize the graph layout, filtering options, and level of prediction.
*   **Visual Cues:** Use visual cues (e.g., color, size, animation) to highlight trending interests, personalized recommendations, and potential surprises.



**Pseudocode (Interest Graph Generation):**

```
function generateInterestGraph(userProfile, trendingInterests, knowledgeGraph):
  // Initialize graph with core user interests
  graph = buildGraphFromUserProfile(userProfile, knowledgeGraph)

  // Incorporate trending interests
  for each trendingInterest in trendingInterests:
    if trendingInterest is relevant to userProfile:
      addNodeToGraph(graph, trendingInterest)
      connectNodes(graph, userProfile.interests, trendingInterest)

  // Apply graph layout algorithm
  layout = forceDirectedLayout(graph)
  graph = applyLayout(graph, layout)

  // Filter & project graph
  projectedGraph = filterGraph(graph, relevanceThreshold)

  return projectedGraph
```
