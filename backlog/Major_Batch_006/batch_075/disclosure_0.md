## Adaptive Partitioning Based on Network Proximity & Load

**Concept:** Enhance data recovery and reduce latency by dynamically adjusting partition placement *before* failures occur, based on real-time network proximity and node load. The existing patent focuses on *reacting* to failures. This proposes *proactive* optimization to minimize recovery time and improve overall performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Proximity Mapping & Load Monitoring:**

*   **Data Collection:** Each node continuously pings all other nodes in the cluster, recording round-trip times (RTT).  Node CPU, memory, and disk I/O utilization are monitored constantly.
*   **Proximity Matrix:** A central service (or distributed consensus mechanism) maintains a proximity matrix representing the RTT between all node pairs. This matrix is updated at a configurable frequency (e.g., every 5 seconds).
*   **Load Vector:** A load vector represents the current utilization of each node. This vector is also maintained centrally/distributed and updated frequently (e.g., every second).

**2. Partition Assignment Algorithm:**

*   **Objective:**  Minimize a combined cost function that considers:
    *   **Network Latency:** The sum of RTTs between nodes hosting replicas of the same partition.
    *   **Load Balancing:** The standard deviation of load across all nodes.
*   **Algorithm:**  A periodic re-partitioning process (e.g., every 15 minutes):
    1.  **Calculate Costs:**  For each possible partition assignment, calculate the network latency cost and the load balancing cost.
    2.  **Weighted Sum:**  Combine the costs using configurable weights (adjusting weights allows prioritizing latency vs. load balancing).
    3.  **Assignment:**  Select the partition assignment with the lowest combined cost.
*   **Constraint:**  Ensure data locality where possible, minimizing data movement during re-partitioning.

**3.  Recovery Integration:**

*   **Pre-emptive Data Transfer:** During re-partitioning, data is transferred *before* the partition is fully moved, enabling faster failover.  A "shadow copy" exists on the destination node.
*   **Recovery Optimization:**  During a failure, the system prioritizes recovery from nodes with the lowest network latency to the affected client(s).  The proximity matrix is used to select the fastest recovery path.

**Pseudocode (Partition Assignment):**

```
function assignPartitions(partitions, nodes, proximityMatrix, loadVector, latencyWeight, loadWeight):
  bestAssignment = null
  minCost = infinity

  // Iterate through all possible partition assignments
  for assignment in generateAssignments(partitions, nodes):
    cost = 0

    // Calculate Network Latency Cost
    for partition in partitions:
      replicas = assignment[partition]
      for i in range(len(replicas)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(replicas)):
          cost += proximityMatrix[replicas[i]][replicas[j]]

    // Calculate Load Balancing Cost
    nodeLoads = [0] * len(nodes)
    for partition in partitions:
      for replica in assignment[partition]:
        nodeLoads[replica] += partitionSize(partition)
    cost += standardDeviation(nodeLoads)

    weightedCost = (latencyWeight * cost) + (loadWeight * standardDeviation(nodeLoads))

    if weightedCost < minCost:
      minCost = weightedCost
      bestAssignment = assignment

  return bestAssignment
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `proximityMatrix`:  2D array representing RTT between nodes.  `proximityMatrix[i][j]` = RTT between node `i` and node `j`.
*   `assignment`:  Dictionary mapping partition ID to a list of node IDs representing the replicas of that partition.
*   `nodeLoads`: Array representing the current load of each node.

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   The proximity matrix calculation and assignment algorithm can be distributed across the cluster using a consensus mechanism (e.g., Raft or Paxos).
*   The frequency of re-partitioning can be adjusted based on cluster size and workload.
*   Caching of proximity data can reduce overhead.
