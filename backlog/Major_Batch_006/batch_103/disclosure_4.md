## Automated Target Swarm Calibration

**Concept:** Expand the calibration room concept into a dynamic, multi-target system utilizing a swarm of small, wirelessly controlled, reconfigurable targets. This moves beyond static calibration charts and allows for complex, real-world scenario simulation within the mobile calibration room.

**Specs:**

*   **Target Units:**
    *   Dimensions: 15cm x 15cm x 5cm (adjustable via software).
    *   Display Technology: High-resolution e-ink or micro-LED panels on each face, capable of displaying static images, animated patterns, and basic text.
    *   Movement: Each unit contains miniature omni-directional wheels/casters powered by small DC motors. Maximum speed: 0.5 m/s.
    *   Communication: Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication with a central controller.
    *   Power: Rechargeable battery with a minimum runtime of 2 hours. Wireless charging capability.
    *   Material: Lightweight, durable plastic construction.
    *   Weight: <500g
*   **Central Controller:**
    *   Hardware: High-performance embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
    *   Software: ROS (Robot Operating System) based framework for swarm management.
    *   Mapping: SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm to create and maintain a real-time map of the calibration room and target positions.
    *   Path Planning: Algorithms for collision-free path planning for each target unit.
    *   Scenario Library: Pre-programmed calibration scenarios (e.g., urban canyon simulation, forest environment, landing pad assessment). Ability to create custom scenarios via a GUI.
    *   API: Open API for integration with UAV flight control software.
*   **Calibration Room Modifications:**
    *   Floor: Modified floor surface incorporating a low-friction material for smooth target movement. Grid markings for initial target placement and position tracking.
    *   Overhead Camera System: A network of high-resolution cameras mounted on the ceiling to provide a top-down view of the calibration room and target swarm.
    *   Lighting: Dynamically adjustable LED lighting system to simulate various lighting conditions.
*   **Operational Procedure (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    // Initialization
    Connect to UAV flight controller
    Initialize target swarm communication
    SLAM mapping of calibration room
    Load calibration scenario or create custom scenario

    // Calibration Loop
    while (calibration_in_progress) {
        // Scenario Execution
        for each target in target_swarm {
            Calculate target position and orientation based on scenario
            Send movement commands to target
        }

        // Data Acquisition
        Acquire sensor data from UAV (camera, LiDAR, etc.)

        // Data Analysis
        Compare sensor data to ground truth (based on scenario)
        Calculate calibration parameters

        // Update & Repeat
        Adjust UAV flight path or sensor parameters based on calibration results
        Repeat scenario execution and data analysis until convergence
    }
    ```

*   **Expansion Modules:**
    *   **Environmental Simulation:** Integration of wind generators, fog machines, and temperature control systems to create more realistic calibration environments.
    *   **Obstacle Simulation:** Introduction of dynamically moving obstacles to assess UAV obstacle avoidance capabilities.
    *   **AI-Powered Scenario Generation:** Utilize machine learning algorithms to generate complex and challenging calibration scenarios automatically.
