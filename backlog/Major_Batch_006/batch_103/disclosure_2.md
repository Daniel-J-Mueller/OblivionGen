## Dynamic Data Stream ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Reconfiguration

**Concept:** Extend the automated reconfiguration system by introducing ‘shadowing’ of data streams. Instead of reacting *to* performance degradation, proactively predict it by analyzing stream characteristics *before* they impact processing. Implement predictive reconfiguration triggered by changes in stream ‘shadows’, alongside the existing reactive metrics.

**Specifications:**

**1. Stream Shadow Creation:**

*   **Mechanism:**  A dedicated ‘Shadow Analyzer’ component will monitor incoming data streams. This analyzer isn't involved in the primary processing pipeline.
*   **Data Collection:**  Collect statistical features of data streams beyond simple throughput/latency. These features will include:
    *   **Cardinality Estimation:**  Approximate the number of distinct values in key fields (e.g., user ID, product ID).
    *   **Data Skew Detection:** Identify uneven distribution of values in key fields. Use histograms or quantile sketches.
    *   **Pattern Change Detection:** Employ time-series analysis (e.g., FFT, wavelet transforms) to detect shifts in data patterns (e.g., cyclical trends, seasonality).
    *   **Schema Drift Monitoring:** Detect changes in data types or the presence/absence of fields.
*   **Shadow Profile:**  The collected features will be compiled into a ‘Shadow Profile’ for each data stream. This profile is updated continuously in near real-time.  Store profiles in a dedicated, fast-access data store (e.g., in-memory database or specialized time-series database).

**2. Predictive Reconfiguration Trigger:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** A ‘Prediction Engine’ will analyze Shadow Profiles for anomalies. This engine will employ machine learning models (e.g., autoencoders, isolation forests, change point detection algorithms) trained on historical Shadow Profile data.
*   **Reconfiguration Thresholds:** Define reconfiguration thresholds based on anomaly scores. These thresholds will be configurable and adaptable based on the criticality of the data stream and the processing function.
*   **Predictive Signals:** The Prediction Engine will generate ‘Predictive Signals’ indicating an impending performance degradation.
*   **Combined Triggers:** Reconfiguration can be triggered by *either* reactive performance metrics *or* Predictive Signals, allowing for both immediate response and proactive adaptation.

**3. Enhanced Reconfiguration Logic:**

*   **Resource Pre-Provisioning:** When a Predictive Signal indicates an impending load increase, proactively pre-provision additional processing resources (e.g., scale up the number of stream processing nodes).
*   **Adaptive Routing:** Implement dynamic data routing based on Shadow Profile characteristics.  For example:
    *   If a stream exhibits high cardinality, route it to processing nodes with larger memory capacity.
    *   If a stream exhibits data skew, route it to nodes optimized for handling skewed data (e.g., using specialized data partitioning techniques).
*   **Model Refresh:**  Periodically retrain the anomaly detection models with updated Shadow Profile data to maintain accuracy and adapt to evolving data patterns.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```pseudocode
function analyzeShadowProfile(shadowProfile):
    // Load trained anomaly detection model
    model = loadModel("anomaly_model.pkl")

    // Extract features from shadowProfile
    features = extractFeatures(shadowProfile)

    // Predict anomaly score
    anomalyScore = model.predict(features)

    // Check if anomalyScore exceeds threshold
    if anomalyScore > anomalyThreshold:
        // Generate Predictive Signal
        predictiveSignal = {
            "streamId": shadowProfile.streamId,
            "anomalyScore": anomalyScore,
            "severity": "high" // or "medium", "low"
        }
        return predictiveSignal
    else:
        return None
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ShadowProfile`: {streamId, cardinalityEstimate, dataSkew, patternChange, schemaDrift, timestamp}
*   `PredictiveSignal`: {streamId, anomalyScore, severity}
