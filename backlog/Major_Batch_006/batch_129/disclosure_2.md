## Dynamic Garment Layering with Physics Simulation

**Concept:** Extend the virtual try-on experience by allowing users to layer garments realistically, incorporating basic physics simulation for drape and movement. Instead of simply swapping garments, the system allows stacking, enabling previews of outfits with multiple layers (e.g., jacket over a shirt, scarf around the neck).

**Specifications:**

**I. Core System Components:**

*   **Garment Definition:** Each garment is defined not just by its 2D image but with a lightweight 3D mesh approximating its shape and ‘weight’ (simulated mass). Mesh density will vary based on garment complexity – high for detailed areas (collars, cuffs), low for simpler sections. Metadata includes material properties (stiffness, drape coefficient, friction).
*   **User Body Model:** A parameterized 3D body model derived from the initial user photograph. Key features (shoulders, chest, waist, hips) are extracted and used to scale/morph a base mesh. This isn’t full skeletal animation, but enough to provide a plausible surface for garment simulation.
*   **Physics Engine:** A simplified, real-time physics engine (e.g., a custom implementation or a lightweight library like Box2D adapted for 3D). Focus is on drape simulation – how the garment naturally falls and folds due to gravity and interaction with the body. Collision detection is essential to prevent clipping.
*   **Rendering Engine:** A real-time rendering engine capable of displaying layered garments with proper shading and lighting. PBR (Physically Based Rendering) is preferred for realism.

**II. Functional Requirements:**

1.  **Garment Selection & Stacking:**
    *   Users can select multiple garments from a catalog.
    *   Garments are added to a layering stack – order defines rendering priority (e.g., shirt under jacket).
    *   A visual layering interface shows the stack order, allowing reordering via drag-and-drop.
2.  **Drape Simulation:**
    *   The physics engine simulates the drape of each garment layer, taking into account garment weight, material properties, and body shape.
    *   Simulation is constrained to real-time performance – simplification strategies (e.g., reduced mesh resolution, simplified collision detection) will be necessary.
3.  **User Interaction:**
    *   **Pose Adjustment:** Users can adjust the virtual model's pose (e.g., arms raised, sitting, walking) to see how the garments react. Basic pre-defined poses are provided.
    *   **Clothing Adjustment:** Users can perform limited ‘tucking’ or ‘adjusting’ of garments via touch gestures (e.g., ‘pinching’ a collar, ‘smoothing’ a lapel). These gestures modify the garment mesh in a visually plausible way.
    *   **Wind Simulation:** Add an optional wind simulation that introduces dynamic folds and movement to the garments. Wind direction and intensity are adjustable.
4.  **Rendering & Display:**
    *   The rendering engine displays the layered garments with realistic shading, lighting, and textures.
    *   A smooth visual transition is maintained during pose adjustments and garment layering.
    *   The final rendered image is displayed on the user's device.

**III. Pseudocode (Simplified Physics Update):**

```
// For each garment layer:
{
  // Apply gravity force:
  force = gravity * garment.weight;

  // Calculate collision forces with body and other garments:
  collisionForces = CalculateCollisions(garment, bodyModel, otherGarments);

  // Apply forces to garment mesh vertices:
  ApplyForces(garment.meshVertices, force + collisionForces);

  // Integrate velocity and position:
  UpdateMeshPosition(garment.meshVertices, deltaTime);
}

//Render layered mesh
Render(layeredMesh);
```

**IV. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sufficient processing power to run the physics engine and rendering engine in real-time.
*   A high-resolution display to showcase the garment details.
*   A touch screen for user interaction.

**V. Future Extensions:**

*   Full skeletal animation for more realistic pose adjustments.
*   Cloth material editor with advanced property customization.
*   Integration with social media platforms for outfit sharing.
*   AI-powered garment recommendation based on user preferences and body type.
