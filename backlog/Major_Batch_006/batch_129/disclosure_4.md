**Dynamic Glyph ‘Bloom’ Based on Environmental Light**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a system where glyph contrast and ‘bloom’ (a soft glow effect) are dynamically adjusted *not* just based on font size and glyph complexity, but on *detected ambient lighting conditions* of the device’s environment. This aims to improve readability and visual comfort by matching the glyph presentation to the surrounding illumination.

**II. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Ambient Light Sensor: Integrated into the device. Must accurately detect light levels and color temperature.
*   Graphics Processing Unit (GPU): Capable of real-time bloom effect rendering and dynamic contrast adjustments.
*   Camera: For optional scene analysis (see section IV).

**III. Software Architecture:**

1.  **Ambient Light Monitoring:** A background service constantly monitors the ambient light sensor.  Data includes illuminance (lux) and color temperature (Kelvin).
2.  **Glyph Database Augmentation:** Extend the grayscale mapping table to include a “bloom factor” associated with each glyph, for each font size.  The initial bloom factor is set to a default value.
3.  **Lighting Profile Generation:** Develop pre-defined lighting profiles (e.g., “Bright Sunlight,” “Indoor Fluorescent,” “Dark Room”).  Each profile defines target contrast levels and bloom factor ranges.
4.  **Real-time Adjustment Engine:**
    *   The engine receives ambient light data.
    *   It identifies the closest matching lighting profile.
    *   Based on the profile, it dynamically adjusts:
        *   Glyph Contrast: Using the existing grayscale mapping table mechanisms.
        *   Bloom Factor: Controls the intensity and radius of a soft glow applied to glyph edges.
5.  **Glyph Rendering Pipeline Modification:** Integrate the bloom effect into the existing glyph rendering pipeline.  This may involve shader modifications to apply the bloom effect after glyph rasterization.

**IV. Advanced Features (Optional):**

*   **Scene Analysis:** Utilize the device’s camera to analyze the surrounding scene. Identify predominant colors and textures. Adjust glyph colors and bloom to complement the scene. For example, in a room with red walls, the glyph bloom could be tinted slightly red.
*   **User Preferences:** Allow users to customize the sensitivity of the dynamic adjustments and define preferred lighting profiles.
*   **AI-Powered Profile Generation:**  Employ a machine learning model to learn user preferences and automatically generate personalized lighting profiles based on usage patterns and environmental conditions.
*   **Bloom Style Customization:** Offer different bloom styles (e.g., Gaussian blur, radial blur) for users to choose from.
*   **Adaptive Contrast Enhancement:** Dynamically adjust the contrast of the entire display based on ambient light levels to improve overall readability.
*   **Multi-Monitor Support:** Extend the system to support multiple monitors, adjusting glyph presentation on each monitor independently based on its surrounding environment.

**V. Pseudocode (Real-time Adjustment Engine):**

```
function AdjustGlyphPresentation(ambientLightData):
  lightingProfile = DetermineLightingProfile(ambientLightData)

  targetContrast = lightingProfile.contrastLevel
  targetBloomFactor = lightingProfile.bloomFactor

  for each glyph in textToRender:
    glyphGrayscaleValue = GetGlyphGrayscaleValue(glyph, fontSize)
    adjustedGrayscaleValue = AdjustContrast(glyphGrayscaleValue, targetContrast)
    SetGlyphGrayscaleValue(glyph, adjustedGrayscaleValue)

    ApplyBloomEffect(glyph, targetBloomFactor)

  RenderText(textToRender)

function DetermineLightingProfile(ambientLightData):
  illuminance = ambientLightData.illuminance
  colorTemperature = ambientLightData.colorTemperature

  if illuminance > 5000 lux:
    return Profile("Bright Sunlight", 0.8, 0.2) // High contrast, low bloom
  else if illuminance > 1000 lux:
    return Profile("Indoor Bright", 0.7, 0.3)
  else if illuminance > 200 lux:
    return Profile("Indoor Dim", 0.6, 0.4)
  else:
    return Profile("Dark Room", 0.5, 0.5) // Low contrast, high bloom
```

**VI. Data Structures:**

*   `Profile`:  Contains `contrastLevel` (float), `bloomFactor` (float), and `name` (string).
*   Glyph Mapping Table: Extends existing structure to include `bloomFactor` for each glyph and font size.
*   AmbientLightData: Contains `illuminance` (lux), `colorTemperature` (Kelvin).
