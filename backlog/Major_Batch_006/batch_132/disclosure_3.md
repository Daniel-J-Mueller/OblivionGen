## Adaptive Environmental Scene Creation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple device type identification to create and manage complete, adaptive environmental *scenes* triggered by device operation and sensor data. This goes beyond simply identifying a lightbulb; it creates a "reading nook" scene, or a "movie night" scene, automatically adjusting multiple devices based on initial operation and environmental feedback.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scene Definition & Storage:**

*   **Data Structure:** Scene definitions will be stored as JSON objects. Each object contains:
    *   `scene_name`: String (e.g., "Reading Nook", "Movie Night", "Dinner Party")
    *   `trigger_device_type`: String (e.g., "Light", "Speaker", "Television") – the device operation that initiates the scene.
    *   `device_actions`: Array of objects, each containing:
        *   `device_type`: String (e.g., "Light", "Speaker", "Thermostat", "Window Shade")
        *   `action_type`: Enum ("set_level", "set_color", "play_media", "adjust_temp", "open_close")
        *   `action_value`: Variant (Integer, String, Boolean) – the value to apply for the action.
    *   `sensor_adjustments`: Array of objects, each containing:
        *   `sensor_type`: String (e.g., "Light Level", "Temperature", "Sound Level")
        *   `threshold`: Integer - The sensor reading that triggers an adjustment
        *   `adjustment_device_type`: String (e.g., "Thermostat", "Window Shade", "Light")
        *   `adjustment_action_type`: Enum ("increment", "decrement", "set")
        *   `adjustment_value`: Integer - The value to adjust by or set to.
*   **Storage:** Scenes will be stored in a key-value database, indexed by `scene_name`.
*   **User Interface:**  A user-facing app/interface for creating and editing scenes. Drag and drop functionality for defining device actions.

**2.  Dynamic Scene Adaptation (The Core Innovation):**

*   **Initial Trigger:** User operates a device (e.g., turns on a light).
*   **Scene Identification:** System identifies the active scene associated with the `trigger_device_type` of the operated device.
*   **Action Execution:** The system executes the `device_actions` defined for that scene.
*   **Sensor Monitoring:** The system continuously monitors relevant sensors (light level, temperature, sound level, etc.).
*   **Adaptive Adjustment:**  If a sensor reading exceeds a defined `threshold` in the `sensor_adjustments` array, the system automatically performs the corresponding `adjustment_action_type` on the `adjustment_device_type`.
*   **Learning Mode:** System monitors user overrides of automatically adjusted devices.  Over time, it learns to refine the `threshold` values for each scene, personalizing the experience.

**3.  Pseudocode (Adaptive Adjustment Loop):**

```pseudocode
function adaptive_adjustment_loop() {
  while (true) {
    for each active_scene in scenes {
      for each sensor_adjustment in active_scene.sensor_adjustments {
        sensor_reading = get_sensor_reading(sensor_adjustment.sensor_type)
        if (sensor_reading > sensor_adjustment.threshold) {
          adjust_device(
            sensor_adjustment.adjustment_device_type,
            sensor_adjustment.adjustment_action_type,
            sensor_adjustment.adjustment_value
          )
        }
      }
    }
    sleep(1) // Check every second
  }
}
```

**4.  Device Discovery & Association:**

*   System automatically discovers devices on the network.
*   User associates devices with specific device types (Light, Speaker, Thermostat, etc.).
*   The system builds a device graph, representing the relationships between devices.

**5.  Example Scene ("Movie Night"):**

```json
{
  "scene_name": "Movie Night",
  "trigger_device_type": "Television",
  "device_actions": [
    {
      "device_type": "Light",
      "action_type": "set_level",
      "action_value": 10
    },
    {
      "device_type": "Speaker",
      "action_type": "play_media",
      "action_value": "Movie Trailer"
    }
  ],
  "sensor_adjustments": [
    {
      "sensor_type": "Light Level",
      "threshold": 50,
      "adjustment_device_type": "Window Shade",
      "adjustment_action_type": "close",
      "adjustment_value": 0
    }
  ]
}
```

This would dim the lights to 10% when the TV is turned on, start playing a movie trailer on the speaker, and close the window shades if the light level exceeds 50.
