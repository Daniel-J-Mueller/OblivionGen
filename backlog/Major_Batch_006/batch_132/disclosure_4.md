## Predictive Fact Generation - Dynamic Catalog Enrichment

**Concept:** Expand the predictive fact generation to *proactively* enrich the product catalog itself, not just prepare facts for immediate query. This creates a dynamic, self-improving catalog that anticipates user needs before they are even expressed.

**Specifications:**

**1. Catalog Enrichment Engine (CEE):**

*   **Input:** Historical fact requests, product catalog data, product performance metrics (sales, views, returns), external data sources (social media trends, news articles, competitor pricing).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Trend Identification:** Analyze historical request data & external sources to identify emerging product features or attributes that users are likely to inquire about.  (Example: Sudden increase in searches for "eco-friendly packaging" signals a trend).
    *   **Feature Gap Analysis:** Compare available product attributes with identified user interests.  Determine missing data.
    *   **Attribute Generation/Sourcing:**
        *   **Internal Generation:** If the missing attribute can be derived from existing data (e.g., calculating product weight from dimensions), generate it.
        *   **External Sourcing:** Utilize APIs or web scraping to obtain the missing attribute from external sources (e.g., fetching nutritional information for a food product).
        *   **AI-Driven Attribute Prediction:** Employ a machine learning model to predict the value of a missing attribute based on similar products.
    *   **Catalog Update:** Automatically update the product catalog with the newly generated/sourced attributes.
*   **Output:** Updated product catalog with enriched data.

**2. Predictive Enrichment Trigger:**

*   **Mechanism:** Instead of solely reacting to individual requests, the CEE operates on a scheduled basis *and* is triggered by significant shifts in request patterns.
*   **Thresholds:** Define thresholds for request volume changes, emerging keyword frequencies, and external data signal strength to determine when to initiate enrichment.
*   **Cost-Benefit Analysis:** Before initiating enrichment, evaluate the estimated cost (compute, API calls, etc.) against the potential benefit (increased search relevance, improved user experience).  Only proceed if the benefit outweighs the cost.

**3. Attribute Prioritization:**

*   **Ranking Algorithm:** Implement a ranking algorithm to prioritize which attributes to generate/source based on factors like:
    *   **Predicted User Impact:** How likely is the attribute to be requested?
    *   **Data Availability:** How easy is it to obtain the attribute?
    *   **Cost of Acquisition:** How expensive is it to acquire the attribute?
    *   **Business Value:** How valuable is the attribute to the business (e.g., highlighting a unique selling point)?

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Scheduled task or triggered by data shift
function enrichCatalog() {
  requestData = analyzeHistoricalRequests()
  trends = identifyTrends(requestData)
  missingAttributes = findMissingAttributes(trends, productCatalog)
  prioritizedAttributes = rankAttributes(missingAttributes)

  for each attribute in prioritizedAttributes {
    if (costBenefitAnalysis(attribute) == true) {
      data = acquireAttributeData(attribute)
      updateProductCatalog(data)
    }
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Product Catalog:** Extend to include a 'dynamicAttributes' field to store attributes added through enrichment.
*   **Trend Data:** Time-series data capturing request frequencies for different attributes.
*   **Attribute Cost Model:** Database mapping attributes to estimated acquisition costs (compute, API calls).
