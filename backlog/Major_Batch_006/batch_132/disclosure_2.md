## Adaptive Encryption Granularity & Session Splitting

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust encryption granularity *within* a single network session, splitting the session into micro-sessions with varying encryption levels based on real-time data sensitivity analysis. This allows for minimized computational overhead while maintaining robust security.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sensitivity Analyzer (DSA):**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream of the network session.
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a multi-tiered classification system to determine data sensitivity (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Highly Confidential).  This could use a combination of:
        *   Keyword spotting (configurable lists).
        *   Regular expression matching.
        *   Machine learning models trained on data types and patterns.
    *   Output: Sensitivity level for each data packet or block.
*   **Output:** Sensitivity level metadata appended to each data packet or block.

**2. Session Splitter & Orchestrator (SSO):**

*   **Input:**  Data stream with sensitivity metadata, original session parameters.
*   **Process:**
    *   Dynamically fragment the original network session into multiple "micro-sessions" based on sensitivity changes.  A sensitivity threshold dictates micro-session boundaries. (e.g., Switching from Internal to Confidential data triggers a new micro-session).
    *   Assign encryption algorithms and keying material to each micro-session based on sensitivity level. Higher sensitivity = stronger encryption.  Leverage existing key exchange protocols (TLS, etc.) for establishing micro-session keys.
    *   Manage and reassemble micro-session packets for transmission.
    *   Maintain state information for each active micro-session.
*   **Output:** Encrypted data stream consisting of fragmented/re-ordered packets.

**3. Encryption/Decryption Module (EDM):**

*   **Input:**  Packets with sensitivity metadata, micro-session keying material.
*   **Process:**
    *   Select appropriate encryption/decryption algorithm based on sensitivity metadata and micro-session parameters.
    *   Encrypt or decrypt data using selected algorithm and key.
    *   Append/remove metadata as needed.
*   **Output:**  Encrypted or decrypted data stream.

**Pseudocode (SSO - Core Logic):**

```
function split_session(data_stream):
  micro_sessions = []
  current_session = {}
  current_sensitivity = "Public" // Initial assumption

  for packet in data_stream:
    sensitivity = packet.sensitivity

    if sensitivity != current_sensitivity:
      // New Micro-Session
      if current_session:
        micro_sessions.append(current_session)

      current_session = {
        "sensitivity": sensitivity,
        "key": generate_key(sensitivity), // Use appropriate key generation
        "packets": [packet]
      }
      current_sensitivity = sensitivity
    else:
      current_session["packets"].append(packet)

  // Add last session
  if current_session:
    micro_sessions.append(current_session)

  return micro_sessions
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   FPGA-based acceleration for DSA and EDM modules to handle real-time analysis and encryption/decryption.
*   High-speed interconnects between modules to minimize latency.
*   Secure enclaves for key storage and management.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced computational overhead by applying stronger encryption only when necessary.
*   Improved security by dynamically adapting to changing data sensitivity.
*   Enhanced scalability by distributing encryption workload.
*   Granular control over security policies.
