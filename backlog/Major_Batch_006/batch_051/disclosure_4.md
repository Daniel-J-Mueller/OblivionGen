## Multi-Resonant Meta-Surface Antenna Array

**Concept:** Extend the grounded patch antenna concept into a dynamically reconfigurable, multi-resonant meta-surface array. Instead of relying on fixed slot dimensions for frequency tuning, utilize an array of individually addressable meta-surface elements *integrated* within the patch antenna structure itself. This allows for beam steering, polarization control, and highly precise frequency selection â€“ all without mechanical adjustments.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** 8x8 array of patch antenna elements, each approximately 25mm x 25mm. Total array footprint: approximately 200mm x 200mm.
*   **Meta-Surface Element:** Each patch element will integrate a 3x3 array of tunable meta-surface resonators. Resonators are based on split-ring resonators (SRRs) or complementary split-ring resonators (CSRRs) etched onto a thin dielectric substrate (Rogers 4350B, thickness 0.762mm).  Each resonator will have a varactor diode integrated into the ring gap for voltage-controlled capacitance tuning.
*   **Patch Antenna Geometry:** Grounded patch antenna structure similar to the provided patent, utilizing a three-dimensional triangular base. The triangular shape will serve as the foundation for embedding the meta-surface element arrays. Patch material: Copper (thickness 0.032mm).
*   **Feed Network:**  A digital beamforming network will distribute RF power to individual patch elements. Each element will have its own transmit/receive module (TRM) for precise amplitude and phase control.
*   **Control System:** A microcontroller (ESP32 or similar) with integrated Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity will manage the varactor diode voltages, controlling the resonant frequency and phase of each meta-surface element. Control software will allow for real-time adjustment of beam steering and polarization.
*   **Power Supply:** 5V DC input, regulated to 3.3V for the microcontroller and varactor diodes.
*   **Frequency Range:** Target frequency range 1.5 GHz - 6 GHz, with dynamic tuning capability across the entire spectrum.
*   **Polarization:** Capable of both linear and circular polarization through coordinated control of meta-surface element phases.
*   **Implementation**:

    *   **Substrate**: FR4 or similar PCB substrate for mounting meta-surface elements and feed network.
    *   **Varactor Diodes**:  Skyworks SMS7630-079LF or equivalent.
    *   **RF Connectors**: SMA connectors for RF input/output.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Function: update_beam(desired_azimuth, desired_elevation)
// Input: Azimuth and elevation angles for desired beam direction
// Output: Updates varactor voltages for each meta-surface element

function update_beam(desired_azimuth, desired_elevation):
  for each meta_surface_element in array:
    // Calculate phase shift required to steer beam towards desired direction
    phase_shift = calculate_phase_shift(meta_surface_element.position, desired_azimuth, desired_elevation)

    // Calculate varactor voltage required to achieve desired phase shift
    varactor_voltage = calculate_varactor_voltage(phase_shift)

    // Set varactor voltage for the current meta-surface element
    set_varactor_voltage(meta_surface_element, varactor_voltage)
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond fixed resonant frequencies offered by slot radiators. By dynamically tuning the meta-surface elements, the antenna array can adapt to changing environments, optimize signal strength, and support multiple communication standards simultaneously.  The triangular base integration provides a structurally sound and compact implementation, potentially leveraging existing device housing elements.
