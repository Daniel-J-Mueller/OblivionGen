## Dynamic Probabilistic Data Structure Merging with Contextual Weighting

**Concept:** Expand upon the probabilistic data structure concept by introducing a dynamic merging strategy with contextual weighting based on data source and time. This allows for a more nuanced understanding of term relationships and improved similarity detection.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structure Augmentation:**

*   Extend the base probabilistic data structure (Bloom filter, Count-Min Sketch, etc.) to include metadata for each entry.
*   Metadata fields:
    *   `source_id`:  Identifies the source of the data record contributing to the entry (e.g., log type, application ID).
    *   `timestamp`:  Records the time the entry was last updated.
    *   `weight`:  A numerical value representing the confidence or importance of the entry. Initial weight = 1.0.

**2. Dynamic Merging Algorithm:**

*   Function: `merge_data_structures(DS1, DS2, context)`
    *   Input: Two probabilistic data structures (DS1, DS2), and a `context` object containing merging parameters (described below).
    *   Process:
        1.  Iterate through the entries of DS1.
        2.  For each entry in DS1:
            *   Check if a corresponding entry exists in DS2 (based on the hash value).
            *   If a corresponding entry exists:
                *   Update the `weight` of the merged entry:  `weight = (DS1.weight + DS2.weight) * context.weight_factor`
                *   Update the `timestamp` to the latest update time.
                *   Apply `context.drift_penalty` to the `weight` if the `timestamp` difference between updates from DS1 and DS2 exceeds a threshold.  This penalizes stale information.
            *   If a corresponding entry does *not* exist:
                *   Create a new entry in the merged data structure, copying the entry from DS1.
        3.  Iterate through the remaining entries in DS2 (those not found in DS1).
        4.  Add these entries to the merged data structure.
    *   Output: A new merged probabilistic data structure.

*   `context` object fields:
    *   `weight_factor`:  A value between 0 and 1 controlling the contribution of each source.  Higher values prioritize data from the source.
    *   `drift_penalty`:  A value between 0 and 1 representing the penalty applied to entries with significant time differences.
    *   `threshold`: The maximum time difference (in seconds) allowed before the drift penalty is applied.

**3. Similarity Detection Enhancement:**

*   Modify the similarity detection algorithm to incorporate entry weights.  
*   Instead of simply counting matching entries, compute a weighted similarity score:

    `similarity_score = Σ (weight_i * match_i) / Σ (weight_i)`

    Where:

    *   `weight_i` is the weight of the i-th matching entry.
    *   `match_i` is a binary indicator (1 if the entry matches, 0 otherwise).

**4. Data Source Prioritization:**

*   Implement a system to dynamically adjust `weight_factor` based on the reliability or importance of each data source.
*   This could be based on:
    *   User feedback (explicit or implicit).
    *   Anomaly detection on data streams.
    *   Automated analysis of data quality.

**Pseudocode Example (Simplified):**

```python
class ProbabilisticEntry:
    def __init__(self, hash_value, weight=1.0, source_id=None, timestamp=None):
        self.hash_value = hash_value
        self.weight = weight
        self.source_id = source_id
        self.timestamp = timestamp

def merge_data_structures(ds1, ds2, context):
    merged_ds = {}
    for entry in ds1.items():
        hash_value, pe = entry
        if hash_value in ds2:
            pe2 = ds2[hash_value]
            new_weight = (pe.weight + pe2.weight) * context.weight_factor
            timestamp = max(pe.timestamp, pe2.timestamp)
            if abs(pe.timestamp - pe2.timestamp) > context.threshold:
                new_weight *= (1 - context.drift_penalty)
            merged_ds[hash_value] = ProbabilisticEntry(hash_value, new_weight, source_id='merged', timestamp=timestamp)
        else:
            merged_ds[hash_value] = pe
    for hash_value, pe in ds2.items():
        if hash_value not in merged_ds:
            merged_ds[hash_value] = pe
    return merged_ds
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Security log analysis (prioritizing logs from trusted sources).
*   User behavior modeling (weighting actions based on user history).
*   Network monitoring (detecting anomalies based on weighted traffic patterns).
