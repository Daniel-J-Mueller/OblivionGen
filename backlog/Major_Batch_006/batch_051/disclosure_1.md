## Dynamic Attribute Weighting & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Expand the research note’s attribute rating system to not just capture *static* user importance, but *dynamic* weighting based on real-time context and predictive modeling of purchase likelihood.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Collection Layer:**

*   **Real-time Contextual Data:** Collect data beyond browsing actions. Include:
    *   Time of day
    *   Day of week
    *   User location (coarse-grained – city level)
    *   Current trending items (globally and within user's category interests)
    *   Social media sentiment (public data, anonymized) regarding compared items.
*   **Attribute Interaction Tracking:**  Log *how* a user interacts with attributes within the research note interface.
    *   Time spent viewing each attribute.
    *   Number of times an attribute value is changed.
    *   Scroll depth within attribute descriptions.
*   **Purchase History Integration:** Link research notes to user’s complete purchase history.

**2. Dynamic Weighting Engine:**

*   **Base Weights:** Initialize attribute weights based on user’s initial ratings within the research note.
*   **Contextual Adjustment:** Apply contextual data to adjust weights.  Example:
    *   If a user is browsing late at night, prioritize attributes related to ease of use or immediate gratification.
    *   If the user is located in a region with extreme weather, prioritize attributes related to durability or weather resistance.
*   **Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning):** Train a model to predict purchase likelihood based on:
    *   User’s attribute weights
    *   Contextual data
    *   Purchase history of similar users (collaborative filtering)
    *   Real-time item popularity.
*   **Weight Refinement:**  Continuously refine attribute weights based on model predictions and user behavior within the research note.  The system “learns” which attributes are most influential for *this* user in *this* context.

**3. User Interface Adaptations:**

*   **Dynamic Attribute Ordering:**  Re-order attributes within the research note interface based on their current weighted importance.  Highest weighted attributes appear at the top.
*   **Visual Emphasis:**  Use visual cues (e.g., color, size, bolding) to highlight the most important attributes.
*   **“Likelihood to Purchase” Indicator:** Display a real-time estimate of the user’s likelihood to purchase based on the dynamic weighting model.
*   **“What If” Scenario Planning:** Allow users to manually adjust attribute weights and see how it affects the “likelihood to purchase” indicator.

**4. Pseudocode (Simplified Dynamic Weighting):**

```
function calculate_dynamic_weight(base_weight, context_score, prediction_score):
  // context_score:  Value between 0-1 indicating how much the current context
  // favors this attribute (e.g., higher score for "portability" if user is traveling)
  // prediction_score: Value between 0-1 indicating how much the predictive model
  // believes this attribute is important for this user

  dynamic_weight = base_weight * (1 + 0.2 * context_score + 0.3 * prediction_score)
  return dynamic_weight

// Example usage:
base_weight = user_rating_for_attribute
context_score = get_context_score_for_attribute()
prediction_score = get_prediction_score_for_attribute()

dynamic_weight = calculate_dynamic_weight(base_weight, context_score, prediction_score)
```

**5.  System Architecture Additions:**

*   **Real-time Data Pipeline:** Ingest and process contextual and behavioral data in real-time.
*   **Machine Learning Model Server:** Host and serve the trained predictive model.
*   **API Integration:**  Expose APIs for accessing dynamic attribute weights and predictions.
