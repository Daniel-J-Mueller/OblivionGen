## Time-Based Network Topology Discovery & Dynamic Reconfiguration

**Concept:** Leverage the multi-master time synchronization to not just *maintain* time, but to *discover* and dynamically adjust network topology for optimal performance and resilience. This system treats time discrepancies as indicators of physical link quality or failure, building a real-time network map.

**Specifications:**

**1. Time Discrepancy Mapping Module:**

*   **Input:**  Timestamp data from each time provider (as in the original patent), switch port statistics (packet loss, latency), and link status reports.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Calculate time discrepancy between time providers *as seen by each switch port*. This is critical – discrepancy isn’t global, it’s *local* to each link.
    *   Correlate time discrepancy with switch port statistics.  A high discrepancy *and* high packet loss strongly indicate a problematic link.
    *   Implement a weighted scoring system.  Time discrepancy has a higher weight, but packet loss, latency, and link status reports contribute.
*   **Output:** A dynamic “Network Health Map” representing link quality. Links are assigned a score from 0-100, with 100 being optimal.

**2. Dynamic Routing & Link Adjustment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Network Health Map, current routing tables, application QoS requirements.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Routing Adjustment:**  Prioritize routes based on link health scores.  Dynamically shift traffic away from degraded links. This is *not* traditional routing; it's a layer *above* standard routing protocols (e.g., OSPF, BGP). It’s more akin to traffic shaping at the network layer.
    *   **Link Reconfiguration (Advanced):** If the network has programmable switches (e.g., P4-enabled), the engine can *reconfigure* links. This might involve temporarily disabling a link with consistently low scores, or re-allocating bandwidth across links based on the Health Map.
*   **Output:**  Updated routing tables, switch configuration commands (if programmable switches are present).

**3.  Time Provider Health Monitoring:**

*   **Input:**  Time provider timestamp data, observed synchronization behavior (e.g., how quickly clients synchronize).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Monitor the consistency of time provider broadcasts.  A time provider that’s frequently broadcasting inaccurate or inconsistent time is flagged.
    *   Track client synchronization times. If a client consistently takes a long time to synchronize to a particular time provider, that provider may be experiencing issues.
*   **Output:**  Time provider health status reports.  Automated failover mechanisms can be triggered if a time provider is deemed unhealthy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Routing Adjustment):**

```
FUNCTION AdjustRouting(NetworkHealthMap, CurrentRoutingTable, QoSRequirements):
  FOR each Route in CurrentRoutingTable:
    FOR each Link in Route:
      LinkScore = NetworkHealthMap[Link]
      IF LinkScore < Threshold: // Threshold based on QoS requirements
        // Find alternative route with higher LinkScores
        AlternativeRoute = FindBestAlternativeRoute(Route, Link, NetworkHealthMap)
        IF AlternativeRoute != NULL:
          UpdateRoutingTable(RoutingTable, Route, AlternativeRoute)
          Log("Route adjusted due to degraded link: " + Link)
  END FOR
  RETURN UpdatedRoutingTable
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION FindBestAlternativeRoute(CurrentRoute, DegradedLink, NetworkHealthMap):
  // Implement a search algorithm (e.g., Dijkstra's) to find the best alternative route
  // Prioritize routes with higher LinkScores
  // Consider QoS requirements
  RETURN BestAlternativeRoute
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires programmable switches for advanced link reconfiguration.
*   Software agent running on each switch to collect statistics and implement the routing adjustment logic.
*   Centralized management console for monitoring network health and configuring thresholds.
*   Integration with existing network management systems.
