## Dynamic Feature Flag Injection for Shadow Testing

**Concept:** Extend shadow testing beyond simply replicating requests to a shadow version of the software. Introduce dynamic feature flag injection *within* those shadow requests, allowing targeted testing of features still in development or behind feature flags in the live environment, without impacting live users. This goes beyond performance testing and enables functional testing of incomplete features in a realistic, isolated environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Request Interception & Modification Module:**

*   **Function:** Intercepts user requests destined for shadow testing. Modifies these requests *in-flight* to include or modify feature flag parameters.
*   **Inputs:** Original user request, shadow test configuration (including feature flag overrides), feature flag catalog.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Parse the incoming request to identify relevant feature flag keys.
    2.  Consult the shadow test configuration for specific overrides.
    3.  If an override exists, modify the request data to activate or deactivate the feature (e.g., setting a header, modifying a JSON payload).
    4.  Forward the modified request to the shadow version of the software.
*   **Outputs:** Modified shadow request.

**2. Shadow Version Configuration:**

*   The shadow version must be capable of reading and acting upon the injected feature flag parameters within the request. This may require minor code changes to support the specific injection mechanism (e.g., a custom header, a specific payload field). The key is that it's configurable, not hardcoded.

**3. Test Configuration Interface:**

*   A user interface (or API) for defining shadow test configurations. This interface will allow testers to specify:
    *   Targeted users or request patterns for shadow testing.
    *   Specific feature flags to override.
    *   The desired state of each overridden feature flag (on/off/specific value).
    *   Duration of the feature flag override.

**4. Monitoring and Reporting:**

*   Capture and report on the behavior of the shadow version with the injected feature flags. This should include:
    *   Error rates.
    *   Performance metrics (response time, resource usage).
    *   Any application-specific metrics relevant to the feature being tested.

**Pseudocode (Request Interception Module):**

```
function intercept_request(request, shadow_config, flag_catalog):
  modified_request = request

  for flag_key, flag_override in shadow_config.flag_overrides:
    if flag_key in request:
      # Assuming flag values are stored as a boolean in the request.
      modified_request[flag_key] = flag_override

  return modified_request
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **A/B Testing within Shadow Testing:** Allow multiple shadow versions to run concurrently, each with different feature flag configurations, to simulate A/B testing scenarios.
*   **Dynamic Flag Injection Based on Request Content:** Inject feature flags based on specific data within the request (e.g., user ID, device type).
*   **Integration with Feature Flag Management Systems:** Connect to existing feature flag management systems to dynamically retrieve and apply feature flag configurations.
*   **Traffic Shaping:** Control the percentage of requests directed to the shadow version, allowing for gradual ramp-up and controlled testing.
