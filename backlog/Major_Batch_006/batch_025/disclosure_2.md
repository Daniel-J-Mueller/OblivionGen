## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System - Portable Device Integration

**System Overview:** A portable device integrates audio analysis with localized haptic feedback delivered through the device chassis and/or a connected wearable. This system moves beyond simple vibration and uses varying intensity, frequency, and *pattern* of haptic output to convey information related to the audio being played â€“ not merely as a notification, but as an extension of the listening experience.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Audio Processing Unit (APU):** Dedicated DSP for real-time audio analysis. Integrated into existing portable device SoC.
*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** A matrix of micro-actuators (e.g., piezoelectric, voice coil) embedded within the device chassis (back, sides, edges) and potentially extending to a connected wearable (wristband, headphones). Minimum resolution: 8x8 actuator grid.
*   **Haptic Driver:** Amplifies and controls the actuator array based on signals from the APU.
*   **Power Management Module:** Dynamically allocates power to the haptic system based on audio characteristics and user preferences.
*   **Communication Interface:** Bluetooth/USB-C for connecting to external wearables and providing configuration options.

**Software Components:**

*   **Audio Analysis Module:** Analyzes incoming audio stream for:
    *   Frequency spectrum (bass, mid, treble)
    *   Amplitude/volume levels
    *   Directional audio cues (if available - stereo/surround)
    *   Audio event detection (e.g., speech, music start/stop, sound effects)
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** Translates audio characteristics into haptic patterns. This is the core innovation.  Algorithm types:
    *   *Frequency-to-Position:* Low frequencies mapped to haptic actuators on the lower edge of the device, high frequencies to the upper edge.
    *   *Amplitude-to-Intensity:* Louder sounds result in stronger haptic feedback.
    *   *Directional-to-Lateral:*  Sounds originating from the left channel activate actuators on the left side of the device.
    *   *Event-to-Pattern:*  Specific audio events (e.g., gunshot in a game, speech start) trigger unique haptic sequences.
*   **User Profile/Customization:** Allows users to select pre-defined haptic profiles (e.g., "Music", "Gaming", "Communication") or create custom mappings.  Includes intensity adjustment and actuator selection.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Algorithm - simplified):**

```
// Input: Audio data (frequency spectrum, amplitude)
// Output: Haptic actuator activation map (8x8 array)

function generateHapticMap(audioData) {
  hapticMap = new array[8][8] initialized to 0

  // Frequency Mapping
  lowFreq = audioData.frequencySpectrum.lowBand
  midFreq = audioData.frequencySpectrum.midBand
  highFreq = audioData.frequencySpectrum.highBand

  // Map frequencies to vertical actuator positions
  lowActuatorRow = int(lowFreq * (7/1000))  // Scale to 0-7
  midActuatorRow = int(midFreq * (7/1000))
  highActuatorRow = int(highFreq * (7/1000))

  // Amplitude Mapping
  amplitude = audioData.amplitude

  // Scale amplitude to intensity (0-100)
  intensity = min(100, max(0, amplitude * 100))

  // Activate actuators based on intensity
  for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < 8; j++) {
      if (j == lowActuatorRow) {
        hapticMap[i][j] = int(intensity * (1 - abs(i - 0)/3.5))
      }
      if (j == midActuatorRow) {
          hapticMap[i][j] = int(intensity * (1 - abs(i - 2)/3.5))
      }
      if (j == highActuatorRow) {
          hapticMap[i][j] = int(intensity * (1 - abs(i - 5)/3.5))
      }
    }
  }

  return hapticMap
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Gaming:** Feel the impact of explosions, the rumble of engines, and the direction of enemy fire.
*   **Enhanced Music Listening:** Experience a more visceral connection to the music, with tactile feedback that complements the audio.
*   **Accessibility:** Provide tactile cues for users with hearing impairments, conveying information about the audio content.
*   **Navigation:** Haptic feedback can indicate turn directions or points of interest without requiring visual attention.
*   **Communication:** Subtle haptic patterns can alert users to incoming calls or messages.
