## Dynamic Attribute Weighting for Cluster Formation

**Concept:** Expand on the cluster detection aspect of the patent by introducing dynamic weighting of attributes beyond simple purchase history. Instead of solely relying on purchase percentages and opposing product avoidance, incorporate external signals (social media sentiment, product reviews, website browsing data) to adjust attribute importance *during* cluster formation. This allows for more nuanced and accurate identification of user affinity groups.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion Module:**

*   **Input Sources:**
    *   Purchase History (as defined in the patent)
    *   Social Media Feeds (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) – Track mentions of products/categories, sentiment analysis of posts.
    *   Product Review Platforms (Amazon, Yelp, etc.) – Aggregate ratings, analyze text reviews for key themes.
    *   Website Tracking Data – Monitor user browsing behavior (pages viewed, time spent, search queries).
*   **Data Normalization:** Implement a standardized format for all incoming data.  Normalize numerical values (ratings, time spent) to a 0-1 scale.  Categorical data (sentiment, keywords) represented as one-hot encoded vectors.

**2. Attribute Weighting Engine:**

*   **Initial Weights:** Assign initial weights to product attributes (price, brand, features, category) based on domain expertise or historical data.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   **Real-time Sentiment Analysis:**  Monitor social media and review sentiment.  If a particular attribute is receiving overwhelmingly positive or negative feedback, adjust its weight accordingly.  (e.g., if ‘eco-friendly’ products are trending positively, increase the weight of that attribute).
    *   **Correlation Analysis:**  Identify correlations between user behavior (browsing, reviews) and purchase patterns.  If users who frequently browse ‘gaming laptops’ also purchase high-resolution monitors, increase the weight of ‘monitor compatibility’ as an attribute.
    *   **Time Decay:** Implement a time decay factor. Attributes that were important in the past may become less relevant over time, so their weights should gradually decrease.
*   **Weight Calculation:**  A weighted sum is calculated for each user based on their interaction with various attributes, utilizing a formula like:
    `UserScore = Σ (AttributeInteraction * AttributeWeight)`

**3. Cluster Formation Algorithm:**

*   **Affinity Threshold:** Define a threshold for user affinity.  A user is considered part of a cluster if their `UserScore` exceeds this threshold.
*   **Cluster Cohesion:**  Measure the cohesion of each cluster based on the similarity of their attribute weights.  Clusters with high cohesion represent strong affinity groups.
*   **Iterative Refinement:**  Iteratively refine the clusters by adjusting the affinity threshold and re-calculating cluster cohesion.  Stop when the changes in cohesion are below a certain tolerance.

**4. Output & Integration:**

*   **Cluster Profiles:** Generate detailed profiles for each cluster, including:
    *   Key attributes (ranked by importance).
    *   Demographic data (if available).
    *   Purchase preferences.
*   **API Integration:** Expose an API that allows other applications to access cluster data. This allows for personalized product recommendations, targeted marketing campaigns, and improved inventory management.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Ingestion
rawData = collectDataFromSources()
normalizedData = normalizeData(rawData)

// Attribute Weighting
initialWeights = defineInitialWeights()
dynamicWeights = calculateDynamicWeights(normalizedData, initialWeights)

// Cluster Formation
clusters = createClusters(dynamicWeights, affinityThreshold)
refinedClusters = refineClusters(clusters, cohesionThreshold)

// Output
generateClusterProfiles(refinedClusters)
exposeAPI(refinedClusters)
```
