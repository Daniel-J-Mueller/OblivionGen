**Adaptive Resource Pre-Fetching Based on Predicted User Intent**

**Concept:** Extend the reload event detection to incorporate predictive analytics, pre-fetching resources *before* a reload is initiated, based on anticipated user actions. This goes beyond simply reacting to reloads; it proactively optimizes the user experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Intent Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: User interaction data (mouse movements, scrolling, clicks, time spent on elements), historical data (prior page visits, time of day, location - if permitted), reload event data (from the existing system).
    *   Process: Employ a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network) to predict the probability of a user reloading a specific section of the page, navigating to a related page, or performing a specific action (e.g., submitting a form).
    *   Output: A probability score for each potential action/reload, a prediction of *which* resources are likely to be needed for that action.

2.  **Resource Prefetcher:**
    *   Input: Predicted actions/resources, current page state, network conditions (latency, bandwidth).
    *   Process:
        *   Prioritize resource prefetching based on probability score and resource size.
        *   Employ a caching mechanism (browser cache, server-side cache) to store prefetched resources.
        *   Dynamically adjust prefetching strategy based on network conditions. Limit prefetching during periods of low bandwidth.
    *   Output: Prefetched resources stored in the cache.

3.  **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The existing reload event detection system triggers data collection for the intent prediction module.
    *   Prefetched resources are served directly from the cache when a reload or navigation event occurs, reducing latency.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction Module - simplified):**

```
function predict_user_intent(user_interaction_data, historical_data, reload_events):
  // Train ML model (RNN/LSTM) on historical data and reload events
  model = train_model(historical_data, reload_events)

  // Predict probabilities for potential actions (reload, navigate, etc.)
  probabilities = model.predict(user_interaction_data)

  // Identify the most likely action
  predicted_action = argmax(probabilities)

  // Determine the resources needed for the predicted action
  required_resources = get_resources_for_action(predicted_action)

  return required_resources
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserInteractionData`:  Timestamped log of user actions (mouse movements, clicks, scrolls).
*   `HistoricalData`:  User browsing history, page visit frequencies, time of day patterns.
*   `ReloadEventData`:  Information captured by the existing system (elapsed time, exceptions, etc.).
*   `ResourceList`: A list of URLs representing resources.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:**  Ensure user data is anonymized and handled in compliance with privacy regulations.  Provide users with the ability to opt-out of data collection.
*   **Scalability:**  Design the system to handle a large number of users and requests.
*   **Accuracy:**  Continuously monitor and improve the accuracy of the intent prediction model.
*   **Server-Side Prefetching:** Integrate with server-side caching mechanisms to pre-warm frequently accessed content.
