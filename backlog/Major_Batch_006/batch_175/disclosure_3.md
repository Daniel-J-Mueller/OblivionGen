## Dynamic Transcoding 'Budget' Allocation & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the licensing cost optimization by introducing a ‘transcoding budget’ per user/account, and proactively scale resources *before* job submission based on predicted budget exhaustion. This moves beyond reactive cost control to *preventative* resource allocation.

**Specs:**

1.  **User/Account Budget Definition:**
    *   Each user/account is assigned a rolling ‘transcoding budget’ – a monetary or compute-unit allowance for a defined period (e.g., monthly).
    *   Budget is configurable via API or UI.
    *   Budget renewal rules are definable (auto-renewal, manual top-up, etc.).

2.  **Job Cost Estimation Engine:**
    *   Prior to job submission, the system estimates the cost of transcoding based on:
        *   Source file size & format.
        *   Target format(s) & resolution(s).
        *   Selected codec(s).
        *   Transcoding complexity (motion estimation, de-interlacing, etc.).
        *   Current licensing costs for required transcoders.
        *   SLA requirements (priority, deadlines).
    *   Cost estimation uses a machine learning model trained on historical transcoding data to improve accuracy.

3.  **Predictive Budget Exhaustion Modeling:**
    *   Continuously monitor user’s transcoding activity and budget consumption rate.
    *   Utilize time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict when the user’s budget will be exhausted.
    *   Adjust the prediction based on queued job requests, anticipated usage patterns, and external factors (e.g., peak hours).

4.  **Proactive Resource Scaling:**
    *   When predicted budget exhaustion approaches (configurable threshold), the system automatically scales transcoding resources:
        *   **Option 1: Job Queuing & Notification:** Pause new job acceptance for the user and notify them of budget limits.
        *   **Option 2: Resource Downgrade:**  Temporarily reduce transcoding quality (e.g., lower resolution, bitrate) to reduce cost.  User notification is required.
        *   **Option 3:  Preemptive Scaling:** Provision additional transcoding instances *before* budget exhaustion to handle queued jobs while maintaining quality.  (Costly, but provides seamless experience).
    *   Resource scaling decisions are governed by user-defined policies (e.g., prioritize quality over availability, or vice versa).

5.  **Dynamic Pricing & Tiered Access:**
    *   Integrate with a dynamic pricing engine.  Allow users to purchase additional transcoding units/time in real-time.
    *   Implement tiered access levels based on budget.  Higher budget tiers unlock premium features (e.g., faster transcoding, priority access, exclusive codecs).

**Pseudocode (Resource Scaling Logic):**

```
function scaleResources(user, queuedJobs):
  predictedExhaustionTime = predictBudgetExhaustion(user)
  timeToExhaustion = predictedExhaustionTime - currentTime

  if timeToExhaustion < threshold:  // e.g., 30 minutes
    if user.policy == "prioritize_quality":
      provisionAdditionalInstances(queuedJobs)
      sendNotification(user, "Scaling resources to maintain quality.")
    elif user.policy == "prioritize_availability":
      pauseNewJobs(user)
      sendNotification(user, "Budget nearing exhaustion. New jobs paused.")
    else:
      // Default behavior: scale down quality
      reduceQuality(queuedJobs)
      sendNotification(user, "Budget nearing exhaustion. Transcoding quality reduced.")

function predictBudgetExhaustion(user):
  // Time series forecasting using historical data and queued jobs
  // Return estimated time to budget exhaustion
  pass

function provisionAdditionalInstances(jobs):
    //Allocate additional compute instances
    pass

function pauseNewJobs(user):
    //pause new jobs
    pass

function reduceQuality(jobs):
    //reduce quality
    pass
