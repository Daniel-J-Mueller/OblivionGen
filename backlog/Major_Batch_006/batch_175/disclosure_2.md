## Dynamic Focal Plane Projection

**Concept:** Expand the augmented reality experience by dynamically adjusting the focal plane of projected images to match the depth of real-world objects. This creates a more convincing illusion of integration and eliminates the flat, 'screen-like' appearance of traditional AR projection.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing System: Utilize the core components of the described patent â€“ projector, time-of-flight sensor, prism arrangement, lens.
    *   Variable Focus Lens: Replace the static lens with a dynamically adjustable (electrically controlled) lens system.  This needs a fast response time (sub 50ms for smooth adjustments) and a wide focal range (0.5m to infinity).  Consider liquid lens or micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) based lens technology.
    *   High-Speed Processor/FPGA: Dedicated processing unit to rapidly analyze ToF data and control the variable focus lens.  Must operate in real-time.
    *   Calibration System: Built-in calibration procedure to map ToF data to lens focal adjustments.  Requires a known reference pattern (projected or physical).
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Depth Mapping:**  Use ToF sensor data to create a dynamic depth map of the environment in the area of projection. This is the existing function, but crucial to the system.
    2.  **Object Segmentation:**  Identify and segment individual objects within the depth map.  Algorithm needs to distinguish between relevant surfaces for projection (e.g., table top, wall) and background clutter.
    3.  **Focal Point Calculation:** For each segmented object, calculate the optimal focal point for the projector to match the object's distance.  This is the core of the innovation.
    4.  **Projection Warping:**  Apply a distortion/warping algorithm to the projected image to compensate for the lens distortion and ensure the image aligns correctly with the warped geometry created by the dynamic focal plane.  Requires a pre-built distortion profile for the chosen lens.
    5.  **Dynamic Adjustment Loop:** Implement a feedback loop that continuously monitors the ToF data and adjusts the lens focal length and projection warping in real-time, compensating for movement of objects or the projection system.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Acquire Depth Map
    depthMap = ToF_Sensor.GetData();

    // 2. Segment Objects
    objects = ObjectSegmentation(depthMap);

    // 3. Calculate Focal Points
    for (each object in objects) {
        object.focalDistance = CalculateFocalDistance(object.depth);
    }

    // 4. Apply Projection Warping
    warpedImage = WarpImage(originalImage, object.focalDistance);

    // 5. Set Lens Focal Length
    Lens.SetFocalLength(object.focalDistance);

    // 6. Project Warped Image
    Projector.Project(warpedImage);
}
```

*   **Possible Refinements:**
    *   **Multi-Focal Projection:** Allow for multiple focal planes within a single projection, creating a more complex and realistic AR experience.
    *   **Light Field Projection:** Explore the use of light field projection techniques to further enhance the 3D effect.
    *   **Interactive Focal Control:** Enable users to manually adjust the focal plane of the projection for specific objects.
    *   **Integration with AI:** Utilize AI to predict object movement and proactively adjust the focal plane, reducing latency.
