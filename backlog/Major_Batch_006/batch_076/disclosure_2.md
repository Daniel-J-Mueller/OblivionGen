**Secure Enclave Orchestration with Dynamic Root of Trust**

**Specification:** A system enabling a dynamic, multi-layered root of trust for secure enclaves, extending beyond traditional HSM reliance and encompassing ephemeral attestation via a blockchain-inspired ledger.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely relying on the HSM for initial secret provisioning and attestation, introduce a distributed validation layer where enclave identity and authorized secrets are anchored to a permissioned, tamper-evident ledger. This allows for revocation and rotation of enclave authorization *without* requiring direct HSM intervention for every change.

**System Components:**

1.  **Enclave Core:** The protected computing environment (TEE). Modified to incorporate a 'Trust Anchor' component.
2.  **Trust Anchor:** Software within the enclave responsible for:
    *   Maintaining a cryptographic hash of the enclave’s code and configuration.
    *   Periodically requesting ‘Trust Validation’ from the Ledger Network.
    *   Decrypting secrets only if Trust Validation succeeds.
3.  **Ledger Network:**  A permissioned blockchain-inspired network. Nodes are trusted authorities (potentially including the HSM, but not exclusively reliant on it).  Stores:
    *   Enclave Identity (unique identifier).
    *   Authorized Secret Hashes (hashes of the secrets allowed for this enclave).
    *   Revocation Lists (enclaves or secrets no longer authorized).
4.  **Attestation Authority:** Component responsible for:
    *   Generating initial enclave identity and secret hashes.
    *   Registering this information with the Ledger Network.
    *   Initiating Trust Validation requests.
5.  **HSM Integration:** The HSM remains a key component for secure key storage and initial secret generation, but its role shifts to supporting the Ledger Network rather than being the sole arbiter of trust.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Enclave Creation:** The Attestation Authority creates a new enclave and generates its initial secrets within the HSM. These secrets are hashed. The enclave's identity and authorized secret hashes are registered on the Ledger Network.
2.  **Trust Validation Request:** The Enclave Core periodically (or upon critical operation request) initiates a ‘Trust Validation’ request.
3.  **Ledger Verification:** The Trust Anchor constructs a challenge message containing the enclave's current code hash. This message is signed with a key derived from the enclave’s identity. The request is broadcast to the Ledger Network.
4.  **Network Consensus:** Ledger Network nodes verify the challenge signature and the enclave's code hash against the registered information. They check for revocation status.
5.  **Validation Response:** If validation succeeds, Ledger Network nodes sign a ‘Validation Certificate’. This certificate is returned to the Enclave Core.
6.  **Secret Unsealing:** The Enclave Core verifies the signatures on the Validation Certificate. If valid, the enclave is authorized to unseal and use the secrets stored within the HSM.
7.  **Secret Rotation/Revocation:**  To rotate a secret or revoke an enclave, the Attestation Authority updates the information on the Ledger Network. The next Trust Validation request will reflect the change.

**Pseudocode (Trust Anchor – Simplified):**

```
function TrustValidationRequest():
  codeHash = hash(currentEnclaveCode())
  requestMessage = {
    enclaveId: getEnclaveId(),
    codeHash: codeHash,
    timestamp: getCurrentTimestamp()
  }
  signedRequest = sign(requestMessage, enclavePrivateKey) //Enclave key based on ID
  broadcast(signedRequest, LedgerNetwork)

function handleLedgerResponse(response):
  if isValidSignature(response, LedgerNetworkPublicKey):
    if response.status == "VALID":
      unlockSecrets()
    else:
      shutdownEnclave()
```

**Innovation & Potential:**

*   **Dynamic Trust:** Enables a flexible trust model beyond static HSM-based attestation.
*   **Increased Resilience:** Reduces reliance on a single point of failure (HSM).
*   **Enhanced Auditability:**  The Ledger Network provides a tamper-evident record of enclave authorization.
*   **Scalability:**  The distributed nature of the Ledger Network can scale to support a large number of enclaves.
