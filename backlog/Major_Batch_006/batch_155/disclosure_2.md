## Dynamic Receptacle Reconfiguration & Robotic Swarm Integration

**Concept:** Augment the mote-based destination indication system with a dynamic receptacle reconfiguration capability and integration with a robotic swarm for optimized item sorting and delivery.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reconfigurable Receptacle Modules:**

*   **Module Type:** Each receptacle will be a modular unit capable of physical reconfiguration – specifically, folding/unfolding or extending/retracting internal dividers.
*   **Actuation:** Each module will contain miniature linear actuators (piezoelectric or micro-motors) controlled by the mote.
*   **Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) Integration:** SMA wires embedded within the dividers will provide supplemental shaping and support, reacting to electrical signals from the mote.
*   **Reconfiguration Profiles:** The control system will store pre-defined reconfiguration profiles based on item dimensions (obtained via scanning at pick-up, or pre-loaded from product database).
*   **Sensor Suite:**  Each receptacle will contain:
    *   Ultrasonic distance sensors to verify divider positioning and detect obstructions.
    *   Load cells to measure item weight and detect imbalances.

**2. Robotic Swarm Integration:**

*   **Swarm Bots:** Small, agile robots (approx. 10cm cubed) equipped with:
    *   Magnetic grippers for item manipulation.
    *   Wireless communication module for swarm coordination.
    *   Basic obstacle avoidance sensors.
*   **Swarm Intelligence:** Centralized control system utilizes swarm algorithms (e.g., particle swarm optimization) to:
    *   Dynamically assign items to swarm bots based on destination and urgency.
    *   Optimize swarm paths to minimize congestion and travel time.
*   **Receptacle Docking:** Receptacles will have designated docking ports compatible with the swarm bots. Swarm bots will be capable of autonomously docking with receptacles to deposit items.

**3. Control System Enhancements:**

*   **3D Item Modeling:** Upon item scanning, the system will generate a 3D model to determine optimal receptacle configuration and swarm bot grip points.
*   **Predictive Reconfiguration:** The system will predict future destination demands based on historical data and dynamically pre-configure receptacles to minimize reconfiguration time.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Algorithm to manage situations where multiple swarm bots attempt to access the same receptacle simultaneously.
*    **Energy Management**: System manages power to motes, actuators, and swarm bots to optimize energy usage.
*   **Swarmbot/Receptacle Pairing**:  Algorithmic method to intelligently match swarmbots to receptacles based on destination, weight, and size.

**Pseudocode – Reconfiguration Process:**

```
FUNCTION ReconfigureReceptacle (itemDimensions, destinationID)
  1. Retrieve optimal receptacle profile for itemDimensions from database
  2. Send reconfiguration commands to mote (activate actuators, SMA)
  3. Verify reconfiguration via ultrasonic sensors (check divider positions)
  4. If verification fails:
      a. Retry reconfiguration (limited attempts)
      b. Flag receptacle for manual inspection
  5. Activate destination indicator on mote.
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION AssignSwarmBot(itemID, destinationID)
    1. Determine optimal swarmbot based on proximity, load, and destination.
    2. Send itemID and destinationID to swarmbot.
    3. Swarmbot navigates to pickup location.
    4. Swarmbot retrieves item.
    5. Swarmbot navigates to destination receptacle.
    6. Swarmbot docks with receptacle and delivers item.
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Miniature linear actuators (piezoelectric preferred for speed and precision).
*   High-density batteries for powering motes, actuators, and swarm bots.
*   Wireless communication infrastructure (e.g., 802.11ah for long range, low power).
*   Robust receptacle materials (lightweight, durable).
