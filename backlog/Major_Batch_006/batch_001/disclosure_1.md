## Dynamic Contextual Layering & Predictive Swapping

**Concept:** Extend the image/information layering concept to incorporate dynamically generated contextual layers *over* the existing image and information, and proactively swap these contextual layers based on user gaze tracking and predictive modeling of user interest.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Gaze tracking integration (camera/sensor), sufficient processing power for real-time rendering and prediction.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Gaze Tracker:** Captures and processes user gaze data.
    *   **Interest Modeler:** AI model trained on user behavior (past purchases, browsing history, dwell time, gaze patterns) to predict interest in specific item attributes or related products.
    *   **Contextual Layer Generator:** Dynamically generates and renders contextual layers – these layers are not static images, but actively generated content. Examples:
        *   **Styling Suggestions:** Layer displaying complementary clothing/accessories.
        *   **Usage Scenarios:** Layer depicting the item in a realistic use case (e.g., a jacket worn while hiking).
        *   **Material/Manufacturing Info:** Layer highlighting sustainable materials or ethical production processes.
        *   **Augmented Reality "Try-On":** Layer overlaying the item onto the user’s view (requires AR capability).
    *   **Layer Management System:** Controls the visibility and order of layers.
    *   **Predictive Swapping Engine:**  Anticipates user interest and proactively swaps contextual layers *before* the user actively requests them. This aims to reduce perceived latency and improve engagement.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Swapping Engine):**

```
//Variables
current_item: Item object currently displayed
predicted_interest_layer: Layer object with highest predicted interest score
interest_threshold: float (e.g., 0.7)
swap_delay: float (seconds - e.g., 0.5)
last_swap_time: timestamp

//Function: update_predicted_layer()
function update_predicted_layer(current_item, user_data):
    //1. Calculate interest scores for available contextual layers based on:
    //   - Item attributes (category, color, material, price)
    //   - User browsing history
    //   - User purchase history
    //   - User gaze patterns on current item
    layers_scores = calculate_layer_scores(current_item, user_data)

    //2. Select the layer with the highest score
    predicted_layer = layers_scores.max()

    return predicted_layer

//Main Loop:

while (true):
    predicted_layer = update_predicted_layer(current_item, user_data)

    if (predicted_layer != current_layer) and (time() - last_swap_time > swap_delay):
        //Swap layers - visually transition from current_layer to predicted_layer
        visual_transition(current_layer, predicted_layer)
        current_layer = predicted_layer
        last_swap_time = time()
```

**Rendering Flow:**

1.  Base Image Layer (item image)
2.  Information Layer (product details)
3.  Contextual Layer (dynamically generated content based on prediction)

All layers rendered and composited in real-time. Smooth transitions between layers are crucial for a seamless user experience.

**Further Considerations:**

*   Privacy implications of gaze tracking must be addressed.  Transparency and user consent are essential.
*   Performance optimization is critical to ensure smooth rendering and low latency.
*   The system should be adaptable to different screen sizes and devices.
*   Integration with existing e-commerce platforms and content management systems.
