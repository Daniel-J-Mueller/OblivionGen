## Proactive Skill Chaining & Anticipatory Parameter Injection

**Concept:** Extend the post-dialog skill recommendation system to *proactively* chain skills together based on predicted user needs *during* the dialog, and pre-populate those chained skills with contextual parameters derived from the ongoing conversation *before* the user explicitly requests them.

**Specification:**

1.  **Dialog-Embedded Intent & Skill Prediction:**
    *   Implement a third ML model (Skill Predictor) operating in parallel with the existing NLU and ML models.
    *   Skill Predictor analyzes each turn of the dialog (NLU output, dialog history) to predict not only the *current* intent but also the *likelihood of future intents* and associated skills.  Output is a ranked list of potential next skills, each with a confidence score.
    *   Maintain a “skill queue” populated by the Skill Predictor. This queue represents the system’s anticipation of the user’s needs.

2.  **Parameter Extraction & Pre-Population:**
    *   As the dialog progresses, extract entities relevant to the skills in the skill queue.
    *   Store these entities in a structured "parameter map" associated with each queued skill. This is akin to a templating system - filling in the blanks for the skill before it's invoked.
    *   Example:  If the Skill Predictor suggests a "Book Flight" skill, and the user mentions "London" and "next Tuesday", those become pre-populated parameters for the "Book Flight" skill.

3.  **Proactive Skill Triggering & Parameter Injection:**
    *   Upon dialog completion (or after a defined period of inactivity), evaluate the skill queue.
    *   If the confidence score for the top skill exceeds a threshold, *automatically* trigger that skill.
    *   Inject the pre-populated parameters from the parameter map into the skill invocation.
    *   Present the results to the user as if they had explicitly requested the skill.

4.  **User Override & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Always provide the user with an opportunity to reject the proactively triggered skill or modify the pre-populated parameters.
    *   Collect user feedback (acceptance, rejection, modification) to refine the Skill Predictor model and improve parameter extraction accuracy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// During Dialog Turn:
function process_user_input(user_input) {
  nlu_output = process_nlu(user_input)
  skill_predictions = skill_predictor(nlu_output, dialog_history) // Returns ranked list of skills
  update_skill_queue(skill_predictions)
  extract_parameters(nlu_output, skill_queue) // Populates parameter maps
}

// On Dialog End:
function dialog_end() {
  top_skill = skill_queue.peek()
  if (top_skill.confidence > threshold) {
    trigger_skill(top_skill, top_skill.parameters)
  } else {
    // Fallback to existing skill recommendation system
  }
}

// Skill Trigger Function
function trigger_skill(skill, parameters) {
    // Present skill results/prompt for confirmation
    present_to_user(skill.results, skill.confirmation_prompt)

    if (user_confirms) {
        execute_skill(skill, parameters)
    } else {
        // Handle rejection/modification
    }
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Increased computational resources for the Skill Predictor model (GPU recommended).
*   Scalable data storage for dialog history, skill parameters, and model training data.
*   Integration with existing NLU and dialog management systems.
*   API for invoking skills with pre-populated parameters.
