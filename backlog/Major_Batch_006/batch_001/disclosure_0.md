## Dynamic Bootstrap Masking with Hardware Random Number Generation

**Concept:** Enhance bootstrap security and flexibility by integrating a hardware random number generator (HRNG) to dynamically mask bootstrap data *before* itâ€™s loaded into the shift registers. This creates a rolling, unpredictable bootstrap sequence, significantly increasing resistance to replay attacks and unauthorized modification of the boot process.

**Specs:**

*   **HRNG Module:** Integrated into the SoC, generating a true random bitstream. Minimum entropy requirement: 128 bits.  Periodic self-test mechanism.
*   **Masking Logic:** A dedicated XOR gate array between the external data source (where bootstrap data originates) and the input of the shift registers. The key for the XOR operation is derived from the HRNG.
*   **Key Refresh Rate:** The HRNG-derived key is refreshed at a configurable rate, tied to the clock signal driving the shift registers.  Recommended: Key refresh at least once per bit shifted.
*   **Bootstrap Sequence Generation:** 
    1.  SoC initiates reset.
    2.  HRNG generates a random key sequence.
    3.  External bootstrap data is XORed with the key sequence.
    4.  Masked data is loaded into the shift registers in parallel.
    5.  Shift registers clock the masked data serially to the SoC.
    6.  SoC performs a de-masking operation (XOR with the same HRNG-derived key) *before* processing the bootstrap data.
*   **De-Masking Unit:** Integrated into the SoC.  Requires access to the same HRNG key sequence used for masking. Secure key storage within the SoC.
*   **Verification Protocol:**  The verification step (already mentioned in the patent) *must* be performed on the de-masked, original bootstrap data.
*   **Key Management:** Secure boot process verifies the integrity of the HRNG itself. Key derivation function (KDF) based on a root key securely stored within the SoC.
*   **Configurable Mask Length:** Allow selection of mask length (e.g., 64, 128, 256 bits) to trade off security and performance.
*   **Error Handling:** Mechanism to detect and recover from HRNG failure. Fallback to a static, pre-defined mask (for emergency recovery).

**Pseudocode (SoC-side De-Masking):**

```
function demask_bootstrap_data(masked_data, key_sequence):
    unmasked_data = []
    for i in range(length(masked_data)):
        unmasked_data.append(masked_data[i] XOR key_sequence[i])
    return unmasked_data

function verify_bootstrap_sequence(unmasked_data):
    // existing verification logic from patent
    ...

function main():
    masked_data = receive_data_from_shift_registers()
    key_sequence = generate_key_sequence() // from HRNG
    unmasked_data = demask_bootstrap_data(masked_data, key_sequence)
    if verify_bootstrap_sequence(unmasked_data):
        // proceed with normal boot
        ...
    else:
        // handle verification failure
        ...
```

This approach adds a layer of dynamic security, making it significantly harder for attackers to compromise the boot process. It leverages the benefits of hardware randomness and introduces a dynamic masking process that would require an attacker to not only intercept the bootstrap data but also to crack the constantly changing key to successfully replay or modify it.
