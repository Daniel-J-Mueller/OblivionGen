## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System – “Sensory Echo”

**Concept:** Expand the gaze-tracking system to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a ‘sensory echo’ of information displayed. Instead of *only* visually presenting data when the user looks at the device, offer corresponding tactile sensations on a wearable surface (e.g., wristband, finger cots). This aims to augment information retention and reduce cognitive load.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Wearable haptic array: A flexible array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, electro-vibration, or shape-memory alloy) integrated into a comfortable wearable. Resolution: Minimum 32x32 actuators. Customizable form factors (wristband, finger cots, etc.).
    *   High-precision gaze tracker (integrated within the electronic device – per the patent). Frame rate: 60Hz minimum. Accuracy: <1° visual angle.
    *   Processing Unit: Dedicated low-power processor within the electronic device and the wearable. Communication: Bluetooth 5.0 LE for low latency data transfer.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   *Gaze-Haptic Mapping Algorithm:*
        *   Input: Gaze direction (x, y coordinates on the screen), displayed information (text, icons, graphs, etc.).
        *   Process:
            1.  Information Decomposition: Analyze displayed content and identify key elements (e.g., text lines, graph axes, critical data points).
            2.  Spatial Mapping: Map these elements to specific zones on the haptic array.  Prioritize elements based on importance (e.g., headings get larger/stronger haptic zones). Utilize a radial mapping scheme where proximity to the gaze center translates to haptic intensity.
            3.  Haptic Pattern Generation: Generate unique haptic patterns for each element type (e.g., a slow pulse for headings, a textured vibration for data points, distinct wave patterns for graph axes).
            4.  Dynamic Adjustment: Adjust haptic intensity and pattern based on gaze dwell time and user preferences.  Implement a “fade-out” effect when the gaze moves away from the element.
        *   Output: Control signals for the haptic array.
    *   *User Calibration:*
        *   Initial Setup:  User defines preferred haptic intensity levels for different element types.
        *   Dynamic Adaptation: Algorithm learns user preferences over time and automatically adjusts haptic feedback.
    *   *Modes of Operation:*
        *   *Focus Mode:* Haptic feedback is only active when the gaze is fixed on a specific element for a pre-defined duration.
        *   *Ambient Mode:*  Subtle haptic feedback is always active, providing a general awareness of displayed information.
        *   *Alert Mode:*  Strong haptic alerts for critical notifications or warnings.
*   **Pseudocode (Gaze-Haptic Mapping):**

```pseudocode
FUNCTION MapGazeToHaptics(gaze_x, gaze_y, displayed_content):
    // 1. Information Decomposition
    elements = DecomposeContent(displayed_content)

    // 2. Spatial Mapping
    FOR each element IN elements:
        element_x, element_y = GetElementCoordinates(element)
        distance = CalculateDistance(gaze_x, gaze_y, element_x, element_y)
        intensity = CalculateIntensity(distance) // Closer = Higher Intensity
        haptic_zone = MapElementToHapticZone(element)

    // 3. Haptic Pattern Generation
    haptic_pattern = GetHapticPattern(element.type) // Heading, Data, etc.

    // 4. Activate Haptic Array
    ActivateHapticZone(haptic_zone, haptic_pattern, intensity)
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced data visualization in complex dashboards.
*   Improved accessibility for visually impaired users.
*   Hands-free control of devices in AR/VR environments.
*   Subtle notifications and alerts without visual distraction.
*   Training and simulation with tactile feedback.
