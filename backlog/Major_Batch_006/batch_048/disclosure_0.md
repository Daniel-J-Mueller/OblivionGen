## Dynamic Content Weaving – Multi-App Storytelling

**Concept:** Extend deep linking beyond simple content redirection. Instead of just *linking* to an app, weave together content *from* multiple apps to create a dynamic, unified experience within a host app (or browser).

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Engine – The ‘Weaver’:**

*   **Input:** URL, Current App Context (running app), User Profile (preferences, history).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Content Decomposition:** Analyze the URL & current app context to identify "content units" (e.g., article text, image, video, map location, product details).
    2.  **App Dependency Mapping:** Determine which apps can *provide* those content units (using a constantly updating registry of app capabilities).
    3.  **Content Request Orchestration:**  Issue requests to multiple apps for their respective content units.  Requests are asynchronous & prioritized based on relevance & user preferences.  Apps respond with content fragments or deep link references.
    4.  **Content Assembly:**  Combine content fragments into a unified display within the host app (or browser).  This requires a flexible layout engine that can accommodate diverse content types.
    5.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**  Monitor app availability & content update frequency.  Dynamically adjust the content assembly if an app is unavailable or content changes.

**2. App Integration – ‘Content Providers’:**

*   **API:** Apps expose a standardized API for content access.  API includes:
    *   `getContent(query, context)`:  Returns a content fragment or deep link.
    *   `getCapabilities()`:  Returns a list of content types the app can provide.
    *   `registerContentTypes(list)`: Register the types of content the app provides
*   **Content Packaging:**  Apps package content fragments with metadata (e.g., content type, author, timestamp).
*   **Security:**  Apps enforce access control rules (e.g., user authentication, content licensing).

**3. Host App/Browser – ‘The Canvas’:**

*   **Weaver Integration:**  Host app integrates with the Weaver engine.
*   **Layout Engine:**  Flexible layout engine that can dynamically accommodate diverse content types.  Support for custom layouts.
*   **User Interface:**  Seamless integration of content from multiple apps.  Unified navigation & interaction.

**4. Pseudocode – Content Request Orchestration:**

```
function orchestrateContent(url, currentApp, userProfile) {
    contentUnits = decomposeContent(url);
    appDependencies = findAppDependencies(contentUnits, userProfile);

    requests = [];
    for each (unit in contentUnits) {
        apps = appDependencies[unit.type];
        if (apps != null) {
            for each (app in apps) {
                request = app.getContent(unit.query, currentApp);
                requests.push(request);
            }
        }
    }

    responses = await waitForAll(requests); //Asynchronous operation
    assembledContent = assembleContent(responses);
    return assembledContent;
}
```

**5. Example Scenario:**

User is viewing a recipe on a website (Host App). The Weaver detects the need for:

*   Ingredient list (App A - Grocery App)
*   Cooking instructions (App B - Video Tutorial App)
*   Nearby grocery stores (App C - Map App)

The Weaver requests these from the respective apps. The recipe website displays a unified view, incorporating the ingredient list from the grocery app, a video tutorial from the video app, and a map with nearby stores.

**6. Future Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Content Adaptation:**  Use AI to automatically adapt content to the user's preferences & device capabilities.
*   **Personalized Content Recommendations:**  Recommend relevant content from multiple apps based on the user's history & behavior.
*   **Real-Time Content Synchronization:**  Synchronize content across multiple devices in real-time.
*   **Interactive Content Creation:**  Allow users to create their own interactive stories by weaving together content from multiple apps.
