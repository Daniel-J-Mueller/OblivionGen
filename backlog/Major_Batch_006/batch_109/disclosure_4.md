## Adaptive Remedial Action Orchestration

**Concept:** Extend the remedial action capability to dynamically compose and execute multi-stage remediation workflows based on real-time instance state and predicted impact. This goes beyond simple 'fix-it' actions to proactive, intelligent responses to potential issues.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Remedial Action Orchestrator (RAO) â€“ a microservice responsible for defining, storing, and executing remediation workflows.
*   **Data Model:**
    *   *Workflow Definition:*  JSON-based definition of a remediation workflow.  Includes stages, conditions, actions, dependencies, and rollback procedures.
    *   *Stage:* A discrete step in the workflow.  May include:
        *   *Condition:* Evaluated against the instance state (metrics, logs, event data).  Boolean expression.
        *   *Action:* A specific operation to perform (e.g., restart service, scale up resources, run diagnostic script).
        *   *Dependencies:* Other stages that must complete successfully before this stage can execute.
    *   *Action Library:*  A repository of pre-defined actions. Extensible via plugins.
*   **Workflow Triggering:**
    *   RAO subscribes to alarm notifications from the instance monitoring service.
    *   Upon receiving an alarm, RAO queries a workflow catalog based on alarm type, severity, and instance profile.
    *   If a matching workflow is found, RAO initiates execution.
*   **Dynamic Workflow Composition:**
    *   RAO maintains a state machine representing the current workflow execution.
    *   At each stage, RAO evaluates conditions based on real-time instance data.
    *   Based on the condition evaluation, RAO dynamically selects the next stage to execute. This allows workflows to adapt to changing circumstances.
*   **Impact Prediction & A/B Testing:**
    *   Before executing a potentially disruptive action, RAO can use historical data and machine learning models to predict the impact on key metrics (latency, throughput, error rate).
    *   RAO supports A/B testing of different remediation strategies.  A small percentage of instances can be subjected to a different workflow to assess its effectiveness.
*   **Rollback Mechanism:**
    *   Each stage includes a rollback procedure.  If a stage fails or has a negative impact, the rollback procedure is executed to restore the instance to its previous state.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   A web-based interface for creating, editing, and managing remediation workflows.
    *   Workflow visualization tools.
    *   Monitoring dashboards for tracking workflow execution and performance.

**Pseudocode (Workflow Execution):**

```
function executeWorkflow(alarm, instanceData):
  workflow = findWorkflow(alarm.type, alarm.severity, instanceData.profile)
  if workflow is null:
    log("No workflow found for alarm.")
    return

  workflowState = createWorkflowState(workflow)
  currentStage = workflow.firstStage

  while currentStage is not null:
    conditionResult = evaluateCondition(currentStage.condition, instanceData)
    if not conditionResult:
      // Condition not met, skip to next stage
      currentStage = findNextStage(workflow, currentStage)
      continue

    // Execute action
    actionResult = executeAction(currentStage.action, instanceData)
    if actionResult.error:
      // Execute rollback procedure
      rollbackResult = executeRollback(currentStage.rollback)
      log("Rollback failed.")
      return

    currentStage = findNextStage(workflow, currentStage)

  log("Workflow completed successfully.")
