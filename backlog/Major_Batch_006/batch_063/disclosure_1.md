## Adaptive Channel Bonding with Interference Prediction

**System Overview:** A dynamic channel bonding system that leverages predicted interference patterns to intelligently combine multiple channels, maximizing throughput and reliability in dense wireless environments. This goes beyond simple channel aggregation by actively *shaping* the combined channel based on real-time and predictive interference data.

**Core Innovation:** The patent focuses on prioritizing channels based on device load and static penalties. This builds upon that by adding predictive interference modeling and dynamic channel *re-shaping* – effectively creating a virtual channel optimized for the current and anticipated conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Interference Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Data Sources:** Historical interference data (channel scans, neighboring AP reports), real-time channel measurements, device location data (GPS, triangulation), predicted device movement (based on historical patterns or user input), environmental data (weather, building materials).
    *   **Modeling:** Utilize machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to predict future interference levels on each available channel. Model should account for both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.
    *   **Output:** Interference prediction map – a matrix indicating the predicted interference level for each channel at a specific time horizon.
*   **Dynamic Channel Bonding Algorithm:**
    *   **Input:** Interference prediction map, available channels, channel bandwidths, device capabilities (supported bandwidths, modulation schemes).
    *   **Process:**
        1.  **Initial Channel Selection:** Select a primary channel with the lowest predicted interference and sufficient bandwidth.
        2.  **Secondary Channel Assessment:** Evaluate secondary channels based on:
            *   Predicted interference (lower is better).
            *   Orthogonality to the primary channel (minimize overlap in the frequency spectrum).
            *   Bandwidth availability.
        3.  **Channel Bonding Profile Creation:**  Determine how to combine the channels. This includes:
            *   **Bandwidth Allocation:** Distribute bandwidth across the bonded channels based on predicted interference levels (allocate more bandwidth to channels with lower interference).
            *   **Frequency Allocation:** Optimize frequency allocation to minimize interference and maximize spectral efficiency.
            *   **Modulation Scheme Adaptation:** Adjust modulation schemes (e.g., QAM, OFDM) on each channel to maximize throughput and reliability.
        4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor channel conditions and adjust the channel bonding profile in real-time.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Multi-channel radio interface.
    *   High-performance processing unit for interference prediction and channel bonding calculations.
    *   GPS receiver or other location tracking technology.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Function: DynamicChannelBonding
// Inputs: AvailableChannels, InterferencePredictionMap, DeviceCapabilities
// Outputs: BondedChannelProfile

BondedChannelProfile DynamicChannelBonding(List<Channel> AvailableChannels, Map<Channel, InterferenceLevel> InterferencePredictionMap, DeviceCapabilities DeviceCapabilities) {

    Channel PrimaryChannel = SelectPrimaryChannel(AvailableChannels, InterferencePredictionMap);

    List<Channel> SecondaryChannels = FilterSecondaryChannels(AvailableChannels, PrimaryChannel, InterferencePredictionMap);

    ChannelBondingProfile Profile = CreateBondingProfile(PrimaryChannel, SecondaryChannels, DeviceCapabilities);

    //Realtime adjustment loop
    while (true) {
        MonitorChannelConditions();
        AdjustBondingProfile(Profile);
        Sleep(10ms);
    }

    return Profile;
}

//Helper function to select primary channel
Channel SelectPrimaryChannel(List<Channel> Channels, Map<Channel, InterferenceLevel> InterferenceMap){
    Channel bestChannel = null;
    float lowestInterference = Float.MAX_VALUE;

    for (Channel channel : Channels){
        if(InterferenceMap.get(channel) < lowestInterference){
            lowestInterference = InterferenceMap.get(channel);
            bestChannel = channel;
        }
    }

    return bestChannel;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased throughput in dense wireless environments.
*   Improved reliability and resilience to interference.
*   Enhanced user experience.
*   More efficient use of available spectrum.
