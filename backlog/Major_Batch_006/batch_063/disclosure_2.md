## Secure Delegation with Temporal Key Shards

**Concept:** Enhance permission grants by fracturing the private key used for signing into multiple 'key shards', distributed amongst trusted entities and requiring a time-synchronized quorum for reconstruction and signing. This introduces a temporal dimension to security – a permission isn’t just ‘valid’ or ‘invalid’, but ‘valid *until* a shard’s time window closes’.

**Specifications:**

*   **Shard Generation:** The ledgering service (or a dedicated Key Shard Authority – KSA) generates 'n' key shards from the primary private key. Each shard is a partial key, mathematically incapable of signing anything without the others.
*   **Temporal Binding:** Each shard is bound to a specific time window – a start and end timestamp. Shards are useless outside this window.  The KSA digitally signs each shard with its own key, embedding the time window.
*   **Shard Distribution:** Shards are distributed to trusted ‘Guardians’ – entities (potentially smartcards as in the patent, or designated servers) capable of secure storage and time synchronization.  Guardians are pre-authorized by the resource owner.
*   **Signing Protocol:**
    1.  A user requests an action.
    2.  The resource initiates a signing request.
    3.  The resource contacts a subset of Guardians (quorum size ‘k’, where k <= n).
    4.  Guardians verify:
        *   Current time falls within their shard’s time window.
        *   The signing request is legitimate (authenticated resource request).
    5.  If valid, Guardians respond with a signed ‘attestation’ – proof of their shard’s validity for the current request.
    6.  The resource aggregates the attestations, reconstructs the partial key, signs the request, and grants access.
*   **Key Rotation:** Shards are automatically rotated after a predetermined period or upon revocation. New shards are generated and distributed, rendering old shards invalid.
*   **Revocation:** Resource owners can revoke individual Guardians, rendering their shards unusable for future signing requests. New shards are issued excluding the revoked Guardian.
*   **Time Synchronization:** Robust time synchronization protocols (e.g., NTP, PTP) are crucial to ensure Guardians operate within acceptable time tolerances.

**Pseudocode (Signing Process on Resource Side):**

```
function signRequest(request, resourceOwner, action):
  guardians = getGuardians(resourceOwner) // List of authorized Guardians
  quorumSize = 3  // Example Quorum Size
  attestations = []

  for i in range(quorumSize):
    guardian = selectGuardian(guardians)  // Select a random guardian
    attestation = requestAttestation(guardian, request) // Request signed attestation

    if verifyAttestation(attestation, guardian):
      attestations.append(attestation)
    else:
      log("Attestation failed for Guardian: " + guardian.id)
      return false // Insufficient valid attestations

  if len(attestations) < quorumSize:
    log("Insufficient valid attestations")
    return false

  partialKey = reconstructPartialKey(attestations)  // Combine shards

  signature = sign(request, partialKey) // Sign request

  if verifySignature(signature, request):
    grantAccess(request)
    return true
  else:
    log("Signature verification failed.")
    return false

```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   Guardians could be implemented as tamper-resistant hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves.
*   Smartcards, as mentioned in the patent, are suitable for close-range, portable Guardians.
*   Dedicated time synchronization hardware may be required for high-precision timing.

**Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Key fragmentation significantly reduces the risk of compromise. An attacker needs to compromise multiple Guardians within a narrow time window.
*   **Temporal Control:**  Time-bound shards limit the window of opportunity for attackers and facilitate automated revocation.
*   **Increased Resilience:**  The system can tolerate the compromise of individual Guardians without affecting overall security, as long as the quorum remains intact.
*   **Delegation of Trust:** Resource owners can delegate trust to multiple entities without relinquishing complete control.
