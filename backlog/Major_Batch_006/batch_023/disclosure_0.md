**Dynamic Content Stitching for Personalized “What If?” Previews**

**Concept:** Extend the preview functionality beyond simply showing *popular* sections. Generate bespoke preview “stitches” based on simulated user interactions, essentially showing a potential purchaser *what if* they engaged with the content in a specific way.

**Specs:**

1.  **Interaction Profile Database:** Maintain a database of user interaction profiles. These profiles aren't just about *what* they interacted with, but *how*. E.g., “fast reader, skims subheadings, frequently bookmarks character introductions,” or “slow reader, highlights complex arguments, shares quotes to social media.”
2.  **Content Graph:** Represent the content item (book, article, etc.) as a directed graph. Nodes are semantic units (paragraphs, sections, images). Edges represent relationships – logical flow, thematic connection, character mentions, keyword associations, etc.  This is built during content ingestion.
3.  **Simulation Engine:** This component takes a potential purchaser’s profile (inferred from browsing history, purchase history, stated preferences) and a chosen ‘interaction style’ (derived from archetypal user profiles in the Interaction Profile Database). It *simulates* a reading/viewing session.
4.  **Path Generation:** The Simulation Engine traverses the Content Graph, making decisions based on the chosen interaction style. For example, a ‘fast reader’ profile might prioritize skimming and jumping between key points. A ‘detail-oriented reader’ would explore tangents and detailed explanations.
5.  **Preview Stitching:**  Based on the simulated path, the system selects relevant nodes (semantic units) and stitches them together into a cohesive preview.  The preview isn’t simply a contiguous section; it’s a curated sequence of excerpts designed to appeal to the simulated user.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** During preview rendering, monitor user dwell time on each stitched excerpt. If the user spends significant time on a section, prioritize similar content in subsequent preview iterations.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function generatePersonalizedPreview(userProfile, contentGraph) {
  interactionStyle = selectInteractionStyle(userProfile);
  simulatedPath = simulateReadingSession(contentGraph, interactionStyle);
  previewNodes = extractNodesFromPath(simulatedPath);
  previewContent = stitchNodes(previewNodes);
  return previewContent;
}

function simulateReadingSession(contentGraph, interactionStyle) {
  path = [];
  currentNode = contentGraph.startNode;

  while (currentNode != null && path.length < MAX_PREVIEW_LENGTH) {
    nextNodes = currentNode.getPossibleNextNodes(interactionStyle); //Based on style
    nextNode = selectNextNode(nextNodes); // Random/weighted selection
    path.push(nextNode);
    currentNode = nextNode;
  }
  return path;
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing preview systems focus on identifying inherently popular content. This system *creates* a personalized preview experience, simulating engagement to highlight content most relevant to an individual purchaser. It's less about popularity, and more about predicting interest.
