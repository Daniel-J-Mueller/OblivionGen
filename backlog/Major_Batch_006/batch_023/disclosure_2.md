## Adaptive Environmental Profiling for Predictive Maintenance & Feature Activation

**Concept:** Expand the environmental sensing beyond temperature to create a detailed ‘device health’ and ‘usage context’ profile. This profile will be used for predictive maintenance *and* dynamic feature activation – adjusting device behavior based on predicted needs and environmental factors.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Temperature Sensor (Existing – as per patent) – Range: -40°C to 85°C, Accuracy: ±0.5°C
    *   Humidity Sensor – Range: 0-100% RH, Accuracy: ±3% RH
    *   Ambient Light Sensor – Range: 0.1 lux to 100,000 lux
    *   Vibration Sensor (Accelerometer) – Range: ±2g, Sensitivity: 1mg
    *   Barometric Pressure Sensor – Range: 300-1100 hPa, Accuracy: ±0.1 hPa
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   Sampling Rate:  All sensors will sample at 1Hz, with burst sampling (10Hz for 5 seconds) triggered by motion detection.
    *   Data Storage: Local storage (minimum 1GB flash) for 7 days of raw sensor data.
    *   On-Device Processing:
        *   Baseline Calibration:  Device will auto-calibrate sensors during initial setup (static environment for 1 hour).
        *   Anomaly Detection:  Algorithms to identify deviations from baseline readings.  Deviation thresholds are configurable via app.
        *   Data Aggregation:  Calculate rolling averages (1 hour, 12 hour, 7 day) for each sensor.
        *   Feature Extraction: Derive metrics like "temperature fluctuation rate," "light change intensity," and "vibration frequency distribution."
*   **Predictive Maintenance Module:**
    *   Battery Health Prediction: Using temperature profiles during charge/discharge cycles, estimate remaining battery capacity. Alert user when capacity drops below a configurable threshold.
    *   Component Degradation Prediction: Correlate vibration profiles with component age and usage to predict potential failures (e.g., motor, fan).
    *   Alerting:  Proactive alerts via mobile app and/or email, recommending maintenance or component replacement.
*   **Dynamic Feature Activation Module:**
    *   Power Management:
        *   Increase recording resolution and frame rate during periods of high light and low vibration (e.g., daytime, stable mounting).
        *   Reduce resolution and frame rate during low light and high vibration (e.g., nighttime, mobile use).
        *   Enter ultra-low power mode during prolonged periods of inactivity (no motion, low light, stable temperature).
    *   Image Stabilization:  Adjust image stabilization algorithms based on vibration profiles. Increase stabilization during periods of high vibration.
    *   Audio Enhancement:  Adjust microphone gain and noise reduction based on ambient noise levels.
    *   Event Prioritization: Prioritize event recording and notifications based on environmental context. (e.g., High priority alerts in low light conditions)
*   **Communication:**
    *   Wireless Connectivity:  Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n) and Bluetooth 5.0
    *   Data Sync:  Automatic data synchronization to cloud storage.
    *   API Access:  Open API for third-party integration.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Feature Activation):**

```
function adjustDeviceSettings(sensorData) {
  temperature = sensorData.temperature
  humidity = sensorData.humidity
  lightLevel = sensorData.lightLevel
  vibrationLevel = sensorData.vibrationLevel

  if (lightLevel > 5000 lux && vibrationLevel < 0.1g) {
    setRecordingResolution(4K)
    setFrameRate(30fps)
    setPowerMode(HighPerformance)
  } else if (lightLevel < 100 lux && vibrationLevel > 0.5g) {
    setRecordingResolution(720p)
    setFrameRate(15fps)
    setPowerMode(LowPower)
    enableImageStabilization(aggressive)
  } else {
    setRecordingResolution(1080p)
    setFrameRate(24fps)
    setPowerMode(Balanced)
  }

  if (humidity > 80%) {
    enableMoistureDetectionAlert()
  }
}

loop:
  sensorData = getSensorReadings()
  adjustDeviceSettings(sensorData)
  wait(1 second)
