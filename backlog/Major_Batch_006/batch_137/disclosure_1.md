## Dynamic Content Re-Styling for Localizability

**Concept:** Instead of *scoring* content for localizability, proactively adapt content presentation *dynamically* based on predicted localization challenges. This moves from assessment to automated mitigation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Content Analysis Module:** 
    *   Input: Raw content item (text, images, embedded objects).
    *   Process:
        *   NLP-driven analysis to identify potentially problematic elements for localization:
            *   Long compound sentences.
            *   Culturally specific idioms/metaphors.
            *   Ambiguous pronouns or references.
            *   Hard-coded date/time formats.
            *   Right-to-left language compatibility issues (image mirroring needs, text direction).
        *   Image analysis to identify text within images.
    *   Output: List of ‘localization hotspots’ with severity scores (low, medium, high).

2.  **Dynamic Re-Styling Engine:**
    *   Input: Raw content item & ‘localization hotspots’ list.
    *   Process:  Automatic content transformation based on hotspot severity:
        *   **High Severity:**  Re-write complex sentences into simpler structures. Replace idioms with neutral equivalents. Extract text from images and present as editable text alongside the image.  Flag for manual review.
        *   **Medium Severity:** Suggest alternative phrasing for ambiguous sections.  Dynamically insert placeholders for date/time formatting. Apply basic RTL layout adjustments.
        *   **Low Severity:** No automatic changes, but flag for translator awareness.
    *   Output:  ‘Localized-Ready’ content item – a modified version of the original.

3.  **User Interface (Authoring Tool Integration):**
    *   Real-time hotspot highlighting within the authoring interface.
    *   ‘Auto-Localize’ button to trigger Dynamic Re-Styling.
    *   Side-by-side comparison of original and localized-ready content.
    *   Translator comments/feedback integration.

4.  **Machine Learning Component:**
    *   Train a model on localized content to predict re-styling effectiveness.
    *   Continuously refine re-styling rules based on translator feedback and translation quality metrics.
    *   Adaptive learning: the system learns which types of transformations are most effective for specific content types and languages.

**Pseudocode (Re-Styling Engine):**

```
function reStyleContent(content, hotspots) {
  for each hotspot in hotspots {
    if (hotspot.severity == "high") {
      content = rewriteSentence(content, hotspot.location); //NLP function
      content = extractTextFromImage(content, hotspot.location);
    } else if (hotspot.severity == "medium") {
      content = suggestAlternativePhrasing(content, hotspot.location); //NLP function
      content = insertPlaceholder(content, hotspot.location, "date/time");
    }
  }
  return content;
}
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Integration with existing TMS systems.
*   Support for multiple content formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON).
*   API for programmatic access to re-styling functionality.
*   Configuration options for customizing re-styling behavior.
