## Adaptive Mapping Granularity

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of mapping information based on access patterns and storage object characteristics. The current patent focuses on asynchronous *updates* to mapping. This expands that by considering *how* the mapping is structured in the first place – not just maintaining it, but evolving it.

**Problem:** Fixed mapping granularity (e.g., per-object, per-bucket) can lead to inefficiencies. Fine-grained mapping (per-object) introduces overhead. Coarse-grained (per-bucket) reduces overhead but limits precision and scalability for frequently modified objects.

**Solution:** Implement a system that analyzes access patterns (read/write frequency, data locality) and storage object characteristics (size, volatility) to dynamically adjust mapping granularity. 

**Specs:**

1.  **Mapping Layer:** Introduce a "Mapping Manager" component layered between the storage service and the keymap.
2.  **Access Pattern Analyzer:** This component continuously monitors access requests, tracking:
    *   Read/Write ratio per object.
    *   Frequency of modifications.
    *   Data locality (objects accessed together).
    *   Object size.
3.  **Granularity Decision Engine:** Based on Analyzer data, this component determines optimal mapping granularity:
    *   **High-Volatility, Frequent Access:** Fine-grained mapping (per-object) for precise tracking.
    *   **Low-Volatility, Infrequent Access:** Coarse-grained mapping (per-bucket or larger groupings) for reduced overhead.
    *   **Moderate Volatility:** Hybrid approach – group related objects with similar access patterns into dynamic “access units”.
4.  **Dynamic Remapping Module:**
    *   This module handles the actual remapping process.
    *   It must be non-disruptive, allowing continued access during the transition.
    *   It utilizes asynchronous operations to minimize latency.
5.  **Mapping Metadata:**  Extend the keymap to include metadata for each object indicating its current granularity level and access unit affiliation.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Decision Engine):**

```
function decideGranularity(object_id, access_stats):
    if access_stats.write_ratio > threshold_high AND access_stats.access_frequency > threshold_high:
        return "fine-grained"
    elif access_stats.write_ratio < threshold_low AND access_stats.access_frequency < threshold_low:
        return "coarse-grained"
    else:
        // Analyze related objects and form/adjust access units
        access_unit = findAccessUnit(object_id)
        if access_unit == null:
            access_unit = createAccessUnit(object_id)
        return "access_unit"
```

**Asynchronous Considerations:**

*   Remapping operations are queued and processed asynchronously to avoid blocking access requests.
*   A "shadow mapping" technique is used to update the keymap incrementally.  New mappings are created for remapped objects, while old mappings are phased out.
*   A dedicated thread pool manages remapping tasks.
