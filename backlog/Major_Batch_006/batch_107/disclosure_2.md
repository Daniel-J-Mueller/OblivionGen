## Adaptive Permutation Network within Sponge Function

**Concept:** Introduce a dynamically configurable permutation layer *within* the iterative calculation of the sponge function, controlled by a learned network. This moves beyond a fixed permutation and allows the function to adapt its internal mixing based on input characteristics.

**Specifications:**

*   **Permutation Network (PN):** A small, feedforward neural network (e.g., 3-5 layers, 64-128 neurons per layer). Inputs to the PN are a subset of the current register value (e.g., the bitrate section). The output of the PN is a set of coefficients (weights) controlling a bitwise permutation operation.
*   **Bitwise Permutation Layer:** This layer takes the current register value and applies a bitwise permutation based on the coefficients received from the PN.  The permutation can be structured (e.g., a series of cyclic shifts, XOR swaps) or more chaotic.
*   **Integration with Iterative Calculator:** The standard iterative calculation (XOR, permutation) is modified. After the XOR operation, instead of applying a fixed permutation, the Permutation Network is invoked to generate a permutation configuration. This configuration is then used by the Bitwise Permutation Layer.
*   **Training Regime:** The Permutation Network is trained *offline* using a dataset of input messages and desired output characteristics (e.g., avalanche effect, diffusion). The training objective is to maximize the non-linearity and mixing properties of the sponge function.  Reinforcement learning could also be employed, rewarding configurations that resist known attacks.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** During operation, the PN could be periodically retrained or fine-tuned based on the statistical properties of recent input streams. This would allow the sponge function to adapt to changing threat landscapes.

**Pseudocode (Integration with Iterative Calculator):**

```
function iterative_calculation(block, register):
  xor_result = XOR(block, register)
  permutation_coefficients = Permutation_Network(register[bitrate_section])
  permuted_result = Bitwise_Permutation(xor_result, permutation_coefficients)
  return permuted_result
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The Permutation Network can be implemented as a small, dedicated neural network accelerator alongside the main processing pipeline.
*   Bitwise permutation operations are well-suited for parallel implementation.
*   Memory bandwidth is a critical factor. Efficient data access patterns are required.
