**Adaptive Resolution Streaming with Predictive Buffering**

**Concept:** Expand on the image stacking and resolution enhancement aspects of the patent by creating a system for *streaming* high-resolution imagery generated from lower-resolution input, with a focus on minimizing perceived latency through predictive buffering. Imagine a live view that progressively sharpens *before* the user even consciously recognizes the need for higher detail.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multiple video streams from a deviceâ€™s camera array (minimum 2, ideally 3+). Streams can be staggered in time slightly.
*   **Preprocessing:** Each stream undergoes real-time noise reduction and basic stabilization.
*   **Feature Detection & Tracking:** An AI model identifies and tracks salient features across all streams (edges, corners, textures, faces, etc.).  Feature data is timestamped and used for inter-stream alignment.
*   **Resolution Prediction:**  A secondary AI model analyzes the tracked features *and* user head/gaze direction (if available via AR/VR hardware, or inferred from device motion) to *predict* areas of interest within the combined image.  This prediction determines the initial priority for resolution enhancement.  Areas directly looked at, or with high feature density/motion, get the highest priority.
*   **Adaptive Image Stacking:** The system creates an initial low-resolution composite image from aligned frames.  Instead of a static stack, the algorithm selectively incorporates higher-resolution data from individual streams *only* for areas of interest, prioritizing regions predicted by the Resolution Prediction model.
*   **Progressive Enhancement Buffer:** A multi-level buffer is maintained. Level 1 is the initial low-resolution composite. Level 2 incorporates selectively enhanced areas. Level 3 represents the fully resolved image.  The system streams Level 1 immediately, while progressively filling Levels 2 & 3 in the background.
*   **Predictive Buffering & Streaming:** The system doesn't *wait* for Level 3 to complete.  It streams Level 1, then seamlessly transitions to Level 2 as it becomes available for areas of interest, and then finally Level 3. The transition should be imperceptible. A "confidence score" accompanies each pixel, indicating the reliability of the data; low-confidence pixels can be subtly smoothed or interpolated to avoid visual artifacts during progressive loading.
*   **Bandwidth Adaptation:** The system monitors network bandwidth and dynamically adjusts the level of enhancement applied.  If bandwidth is limited, it may prioritize the most important areas of the image or reduce the overall resolution.
*   **Output:** A high-resolution video stream that appears to be rendered in real-time.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Per Frame:
for each stream:
    denoise(stream)
    stabilize(stream)
    detect_features(stream)

align_streams(streams) // Based on feature tracking

low_res_composite = create_composite(streams)

priority_map = predict_resolution_priority(low_res_composite, user_gaze)

for each region in priority_map:
    if region_priority > threshold:
        high_res_data = extract_from_streams(streams, region)
        enhanced_region = apply_super_resolution(high_res_data)
        composite = update_composite(composite, enhanced_region)

stream_level_1(composite) // Initial low-res

if composite level 2 data is ready:
    stream_level_2(composite)
if composite level 3 data is ready:
    stream_level_3(composite)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Live AR/VR experiences with high visual fidelity.
*   Remote inspection/surgery with real-time enhanced imagery.
*   High-quality video conferencing with reduced bandwidth requirements.
*   Real-time aerial/satellite imagery enhancement.
