## Adaptive Decoy Network with Dynamic Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Expand the 'active decoy' approach beyond simply depleting resources. Create a dynamic network of decoy systems that *mimic* legitimate services, but subtly manipulate data or interactions to identify and profile attackers, and then dynamically shift resource allocation to better contain them. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Decoy System Architecture:**

*   **Modular Design:** Each decoy system is composed of modules mirroring common services (e.g., web server, database, API endpoint). These modules are configurable to emulate different versions and configurations.
*   **Data Mimicry:** Decoy databases contain realistically structured, but synthetic, data. Data generation algorithms ensure statistical similarity to production data, but avoid exact duplicates.
*   **Interaction Logging:** All interactions with decoy systems are meticulously logged, including request parameters, response data, timestamps, and source IP addresses.
*   **Behavioral Analysis Engine:** A dedicated engine analyzes interaction logs to identify anomalous behavior. This includes:
    *   SQL injection attempts
    *   Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks
    *   Brute-force login attempts
    *   Unusual data access patterns
    *   Rapidly changing IP addresses (indicating botnets)

**2. Dynamic Resource Allocation:**

*   **Resource Pool:** A pool of virtual machines (VMs) or containers is maintained for dynamic deployment of decoy systems.
*   **Threat Level Assessment:** Based on the behavioral analysis engine's output, each attacking IP address is assigned a threat level.
*   **Dynamic Deployment:**
    *   **Low Threat:** Attackers interacting with low-threat decoys experience normal behavior, providing baseline data for profiling.
    *   **Medium Threat:** Attackers are redirected to more complex decoys designed to slow them down or gather more information. Resource allocation to these decoys is increased.
    *   **High Threat:** Attackers are redirected to highly resource-intensive decoys. These decoys are designed to maximize resource consumption (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and potentially trigger security alerts.  
*   **Automated Scaling:** The system automatically scales the number of deployed decoys based on the overall attack traffic volume and threat level.
*   **Adaptive Response:** Adjust decoy response times and data complexity to increase attacker dwell time and maximize information gathering.

**3. Data Manipulation & Profiling:**

*   **Subtle Data Corruption:**  Decoy data is subtly altered to test for data validation vulnerabilities. E.g., adding a single character to an email address field.
*   **Time-Based Delays:** Introduce variable delays in response times to detect timing attacks.
*   **Encrypted Payloads:** Decoy data may be encrypted, requiring attackers to attempt decryption.
*   **Profile Building:** Gather information about attacker tools, techniques, and motivations based on their interactions with decoys.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Decoy Deployment):**

```
function deployDecoy(ipAddress, threatLevel) {
  if (threatLevel == "low") {
    deployStandardDecoy(ipAddress);
  } else if (threatLevel == "medium") {
    deployComplexDecoy(ipAddress);
    increaseResourceAllocation(complexDecoyVM);
  } else if (threatLevel == "high") {
    deployResourceIntensiveDecoy(ipAddress);
    maximizeResourceAllocation(resourceIntensiveDecoyVM);
    triggerSecurityAlert(ipAddress);
  }
}

function increaseResourceAllocation(vm) {
  // Code to increase CPU, memory, and network bandwidth allocation to the VM
}

function maximizeResourceAllocation(vm) {
  // Code to allocate maximum available resources to the VM
}
```

**4. Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:** 

Decoy system logs are streamed to SIEM systems for centralized monitoring and analysis.  This allows security teams to correlate decoy activity with other security events and identify potential attacks. 

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simple resource depletion by creating a dynamic, adaptive network of decoys designed to *actively* profile attackers and gather intelligence, rather than just slowing them down.  The automated scaling and resource allocation based on threat level provides a more sophisticated and responsive defense mechanism.
