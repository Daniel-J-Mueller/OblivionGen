## Personalized Digital Object 'Ecosystem' with Dynamic Rights Assignment

**Concept:** Expand the personalized data store into a dynamic 'digital object ecosystem' where rights to digital objects aren’t fixed at purchase, but evolve based on user interaction, social connections, and 'digital karma'.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Infrastructure – The ‘Nexus’:**

*   **Nexus Server:** A central server coordinating the ecosystem. Manages user profiles, digital object metadata (including dynamic rights information), and inter-user transactions.
*   **User Profile:** Extends existing user profiles with:
    *   'Digital Karma' score – calculated based on sharing, reviewing, and responsible use of digital objects.
    *   'Trust Network' – a graph representing relationships between users (friends, family, colleagues).
    *   'Content Affinity' – Data points indicating user preferences to enhance personalized object presentation.
*   **Digital Object Metadata:**  Beyond standard metadata, includes:
    *   'Base Rights' - Initial rights granted at purchase (e.g., personal use, streaming).
    *   'Dynamic Rights Flags' – Indicate rights subject to change (e.g., sharing, remixing).
    *   'Karma Multiplier' –  Determines how much a user’s Digital Karma influences their access to dynamic rights.
    *   'Sharing Threshold' –  Minimum Karma/Trust Network score required to unlock sharing rights.
*   **Secure Enclave Integration:** Utilize secure enclaves (e.g., ARM TrustZone, Intel SGX) on user devices for storing and enforcing rights.

**2. Dynamic Rights Engine:**

*   **Rights Assessment Module:** Continuously evaluates user’s Digital Karma, Trust Network, and Content Affinity to determine available rights for each digital object.
*   **Rights Granting API:**  An API allowing applications to request rights from the Rights Assessment Module.  Returns a ‘Rights Token’ granting access to specific features.
*   **Time-Limited Rights:**  Rights can be granted for a limited time, requiring periodic renewal based on user activity.
*    **Rights Decay:** If content is unused, rights will decay and require re-attainment.

**3. Ecosystem Interactions:**

*   **Peer-to-Peer Sharing:** Users can share digital objects with others in their Trust Network, subject to sharing thresholds.  Transfers are facilitated via the Nexus Server for rights management.
*   **Remixing & Creation:**  Certain objects may allow remixing (e.g., music, video), with new creations inheriting rights based on the original object and the remixer’s Karma.
*   **Micro-Licensing:**  Users can ‘rent out’ rights to their digital objects for a small fee, creating a micro-economy within the ecosystem.
*   **Karma Boosters:** Actions like leaving thoughtful reviews, creating high-quality remixes, and responsible sharing earn users Karma points.

**4. System Flow – Requesting Access:**

```pseudocode
// User attempts to access a feature of a digital object (e.g., share a song)
function requestAccess(userID, objectID, feature):
  // 1. Get User Profile from Nexus Server
  userProfile = NexusServer.getUserProfile(userID)

  // 2. Get Object Metadata from Nexus Server
  objectMetadata = NexusServer.getObjectMetadata(objectID)

  // 3. Check if feature is allowed based on Base Rights
  if objectMetadata.baseRights.includes(feature):
    return "Access Granted"

  // 4. Check if feature is subject to Dynamic Rights
  if objectMetadata.dynamicRightsFlags.includes(feature):
    // 5. Calculate Eligibility Score (Karma * TrustNetworkStrength * ContentAffinity)
    eligibilityScore = userProfile.karma * userProfile.trustNetworkStrength * userProfile.contentAffinity

    // 6. Check if Eligibility Score meets Sharing Threshold
    if eligibilityScore >= objectMetadata.sharingThreshold:
      // 7. Grant Temporary Rights Token
      rightsToken = generateRightsToken(userID, objectID, feature, expirationTime)
      return "Access Granted (with Rights Token)"
    else:
      return "Access Denied (Insufficient Eligibility)"
  else:
    return "Access Denied (Feature Not Allowed)"
```

**5. Security Considerations:**

*   **Encryption:** All digital objects and rights tokens are encrypted both in transit and at rest.
*   **Secure Enclave Integration:** Utilize secure enclaves for secure storage of rights tokens and decryption keys.
*   **Tamper-Proof Audit Trails:** Maintain a tamper-proof audit trail of all rights transactions.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple digital rights management to create a dynamic ecosystem where access to digital content is earned through engagement and social responsibility. It fosters a sense of community and incentivizes responsible content consumption. This is significantly different from current systems focused on strict licensing and enforcement.
