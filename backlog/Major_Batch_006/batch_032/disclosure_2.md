## Dynamic Prosody Injection for Enhanced Multimodal Punctuation

**Concept:** Extend the existing multimodal punctuation system by dynamically injecting synthetic prosodic features into the acoustic embeddings *before* task-specific embedding generation. This allows for amplification of subtle acoustic cues relevant to punctuation, particularly in noisy or ambiguous audio.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on fusing lexical and acoustic features. However, the natural prosody of speech (intonation, rhythm, stress) is *crucial* for accurate punctuation. Existing systems may lose this information during acoustic encoding. We can artificially enhance these prosodic signals to improve punctuation prediction, especially in challenging conditions.

**Specs:**

1.  **Prosody Synthesis Module:**
    *   Input: Frame-level acoustic embeddings (as generated in the existing system).
    *   Process: 
        *   Analyze the acoustic embeddings to estimate the “emotional tone” of the utterance (e.g., using a pre-trained emotion recognition model).
        *   Generate synthetic prosodic features based on this estimated tone. These features include:
            *   *Fundamental Frequency (F0) contour variation:*  Adjust the predicted F0 contour to emphasize rising/falling intonation for questions/statements.
            *   *Energy contour variation:*  Boost energy levels at phrase boundaries to signal punctuation.
            *   *Speaking Rate Variation:*  Slightly accelerate or decelerate speech to mimic natural pauses.
        *   These synthetic features are represented as a vector of values.
2.  **Injection Layer:**
    *   Input: Frame-level acoustic embeddings, Synthetic Prosodic Feature Vector.
    *   Process:  Concatenate the synthetic prosodic feature vector to each frame of the acoustic embeddings. Alternatively, use a learned weighting mechanism (e.g., a small neural network) to modulate the acoustic embeddings based on the prosodic features.
3.  **Modified Acoustic Encoding Pipeline:**
    *   The injected acoustic embeddings now feed into the existing convolutional and LSTM layers to generate task-specific embeddings.
4.  **Training & Loss Function:**
    *   The system is trained end-to-end. 
    *   Loss function includes a standard punctuation/casing prediction loss *plus* a “prosody consistency” loss. This loss penalizes deviations from natural prosody in the generated output, encouraging the system to learn realistic prosodic patterns. This can be calculated by passing the generated text through a Text-To-Speech (TTS) model and comparing the synthesized prosody to a reference dataset.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def enhance_acoustic_features(acoustic_embeddings, emotion_model, reference_prosody_dataset):
    # Estimate emotion from acoustic embeddings
    emotion = emotion_model.predict(acoustic_embeddings)

    # Generate synthetic prosodic features based on emotion
    prosodic_features = generate_prosodic_features(emotion)

    # Inject prosodic features into acoustic embeddings
    enhanced_embeddings = inject_features(acoustic_embeddings, prosodic_features)

    return enhanced_embeddings

def inject_features(embeddings, features):
    #Concatenate features to each embedding frame
    return np.concatenate((embeddings, features), axis=1)
```

**Novelty:** This differs from the provided patent by *proactively enhancing* the acoustic signal *before* feature extraction, rather than relying solely on the information already present in the raw audio. It introduces an artificial injection of prosodic information, potentially improving performance in noisy environments or with speakers who have subtle or atypical prosodic patterns.
