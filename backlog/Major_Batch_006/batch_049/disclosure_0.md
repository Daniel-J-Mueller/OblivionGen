## Adaptive Communication Routing Based on Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the existing communication session establishment to incorporate real-time biofeedback from the user to dynamically adjust communication routing and modalities. This aims to optimize communication effectiveness and reduce user cognitive load.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate compatibility with a range of wearable biofeedback sensors. Initially support:
    *   Electroencephalography (EEG) - for cognitive workload & emotional state detection.
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) – for arousal/stress level detection.
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV) – for stress & cognitive resilience assessment.
*   **Data Acquisition:** Implement a secure data acquisition pipeline to receive real-time biofeedback data from the connected sensors.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Implement noise filtering and artifact removal algorithms to clean the raw biofeedback data. Feature extraction algorithms to translate raw signals into meaningful metrics (e.g., cognitive load score, stress level, emotional valence).

**2.  Communication Routing Engine:**

*   **Baseline Profile:** Store a baseline biofeedback profile for each user, established during initial setup/calibration. This represents the user's typical state.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the user’s real-time biofeedback data during a communication session attempt.
*   **Dynamic Routing Rules:** Implement a set of dynamic routing rules based on biofeedback data. Examples:
    *   **High Cognitive Load:** If EEG data indicates high cognitive load during an initial contact attempt (e.g. receiving a call), automatically route to a simplified communication mode (text-based instead of voice).
    *   **High Stress/Arousal:** If GSR or HRV data indicates high stress, prioritize communication with pre-defined "calm contacts" or delay initiating a session until a more favorable state is detected.
    *   **Emotional State Matching:** If the system detects a specific emotional state (e.g., sadness), route the communication to a contact known for empathy or understanding.
    *   **Communication Mode Selection:** Dynamically select the optimal communication mode (voice, video, text, asynchronous messaging) based on the user's current state and contact preferences.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Employ machine learning algorithms to continuously refine the routing rules based on user feedback and session outcomes.

**3.  User Interface & Feedback:**

*   **Visualizations:** Provide the user with clear visualizations of their real-time biofeedback data.
*   **Control:** Allow the user to customize the routing rules and override the system’s recommendations.
*   **Notifications:** Provide subtle notifications about changes in communication routing based on biofeedback data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On Session Initiation
function initiateSession(contactName) {
  userAccount = identifyUserAccount()
  contactList = getContactList(userAccount)
  firstContact, secondContact = findContacts(contactList, contactName)
  firstCharacteristic = getFirstContactCharacteristic(firstContact)
  secondCharacteristic = getSecondContactCharacteristic(secondContact)

  biofeedbackData = getBiofeedbackData()
  cognitiveLoad = analyzeCognitiveLoad(biofeedbackData)
  stressLevel = analyzeStressLevel(biofeedbackData)

  if (cognitiveLoad > threshold || stressLevel > threshold) {
    // Route to simplified communication mode (e.g., text)
    communicationMode = "text"
    routeToContact(secondContact, communicationMode) // or an alternate calm contact
  } else {
    // Use preferred contact & mode
    communicationMode = getPreferredCommunicationMode(firstContact)
    routeToContact(firstContact, communicationMode)
  }
}

// On continuous biofeedback monitoring
function monitorBiofeedback(session) {
  biofeedbackData = getBiofeedbackData()
  cognitiveLoad = analyzeCognitiveLoad(biofeedbackData)
  stressLevel = analyzeStressLevel(biofeedbackData)

  if (stressLevel > highStressThreshold) {
    // offer to switch to a calmer contact or pause the session
    displayNotification("High stress detected. Would you like to switch to a calmer contact?")
  }

  // continuously adjust communication parameters (volume, display brightness, etc.)
  // based on biofeedback data
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Wearable Biofeedback Sensors (EEG, GSR, HRV)
*   Secure Wireless Communication Protocol (Bluetooth Low Energy)
*   Processing Unit for Real-time Data Analysis
*   User Interface (Mobile App or Desktop Application)
