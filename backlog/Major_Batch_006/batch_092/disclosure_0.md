## Adaptive Network "Shadowing" for Predictive QoS

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network routing capabilities by creating dynamically generated "shadow" networks – lightweight, temporary copies of network paths – used for proactive QoS prediction and adjustment *before* actual packet transmission.

**Specs:**

**1. Shadow Network Generation Module:**

*   **Trigger:** Activated by significant shifts in virtual network performance characteristics (latency, bandwidth, packet loss) *or* user-defined thresholds. Also triggered by predictive analytics identifying potential network congestion.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify critical paths for specific virtual networks.
    *   Create temporary "shadow" networks mirroring these paths, utilizing unused bandwidth on the substrate network. These shadows operate *in parallel* with live traffic.
    *   Shadow networks utilize a minimal packet rate – “probe” packets – to measure path performance in real-time. These probes are distinct from live traffic (e.g., using a different DSCP marking).
*   **Data Collected:**  Latency, jitter, packet loss, available bandwidth along the shadow path. This data is time-stamped and correlated with the original virtual network’s traffic patterns.

**2. Predictive QoS Engine:**

*   **Input:** Real-time performance data from shadow networks, historical performance data, user-defined QoS policies, and network topology information.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory) to predict future performance bottlenecks along the critical paths.
    *   Calculate potential QoS violations based on predicted performance.
    *   Generate proactive routing adjustments (e.g., rerouting traffic to alternate paths, adjusting bandwidth allocation, prioritizing specific traffic flows).

**3. Dynamic Routing Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Proactive routing adjustments from the Predictive QoS Engine.
*   **Process:**
    *   Update the forwarding tables of the substrate network nodes (using protocols like OpenFlow or P4) *before* a QoS violation occurs.
    *   Implement the adjustments gradually to minimize disruption to live traffic.
    *   Continuously monitor the impact of the adjustments and refine the predictive model accordingly.

**4. Shadow Network Lifecycle Management:**

*   **Creation:**  On-demand, triggered by performance changes or predictive analysis.
*   **Maintenance:** Low-bandwidth probes maintain real-time data.
*   **Deletion:** Shadow networks are automatically deleted when the triggering condition resolves or after a defined timeout period.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Shadow networks utilize available bandwidth on the substrate network; prioritize allocation based on the criticality of the virtual network.

**Pseudocode (Predictive QoS Engine):**

```
function predict_qos(shadow_network_data, historical_data, user_policies, topology):
  // Input: Shadow network performance data, historical data, user policies, network topology
  // Output: Proposed routing adjustments

  // 1. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from shadow network data and historical data.
  features = extract_features(shadow_network_data, historical_data)

  // 2. Model Training: Train a machine learning model to predict QoS violations.
  model = train_model(features, user_policies, topology)

  // 3. Prediction: Predict future QoS violations based on current network conditions.
  predicted_violations = predict_violations(model, features)

  // 4. Adjustment Generation: Generate proactive routing adjustments to mitigate predicted violations.
  adjustments = generate_adjustments(predicted_violations, topology)

  return adjustments
```
