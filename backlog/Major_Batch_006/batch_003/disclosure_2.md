## Adaptive Workload 'Shadowing' & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** Extend the architecture diagram generation and optimization to include a ‘shadowing’ system for workloads, proactively predicting resource needs *before* they manifest as bottlenecks, and employing a predictive scaling mechanism.

**Specification:**

1.  **Workload Shadow Creation:** Upon initial application deployment and architecture diagram generation, a lightweight ‘shadow’ of each workload (first workload, second workload, etc.) is created. This shadow doesn't actively process requests but passively monitors key metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O) from the *live* workload.

2.  **Historical Data Capture:**  The shadowing system captures a rolling window of historical performance data for each workload, storing it in a time-series database.  Data points include:
    *   Resource utilization (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network I/O)
    *   Request latency
    *   Throughput
    *   Error rates
    *   Correlation between workloads (dependencies identified in the architecture diagram are critical here)

3.  **Predictive Modeling:** A machine learning model (e.g., time-series forecasting – ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) is trained *per workload* using the historical data.  The model predicts future resource requirements based on patterns learned from past performance.  The model *explicitly* considers dependencies between workloads as identified in the architecture diagram.

4.  **Proactive Scaling:** Based on the model’s predictions:
    *   If the predicted resource utilization exceeds a predefined threshold, the system proactively scales the workload *before* it experiences performance degradation.  Scaling can involve:
        *   Increasing the number of instances (horizontal scaling)
        *   Increasing the resource allocation (CPU, memory) to existing instances (vertical scaling)
    *   The system incorporates a ‘confidence interval’ around the prediction.  Scaling is only triggered if the *lower bound* of the prediction exceeds the threshold, reducing the risk of unnecessary scaling.

5.  **Architecture Diagram Integration:** The architecture diagram visualization is enhanced to display:
    *   Predicted resource utilization for each workload.
    *   Current scaling status.
    *   Confidence intervals around predictions.
    *   Potential bottlenecks identified by the predictive model.

6. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The thresholds for triggering scaling are not static. They are dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   Service Level Objectives (SLOs) defined by the user.
    *   Real-time application performance.
    *   Cost optimization goals.

**Pseudocode (Scaling Decision Logic):**

```
FUNCTION determineScalingAction(workload, predictedUtilization, lowerConfidenceBound, threshold, currentResources):
  IF lowerConfidenceBound > threshold:
    scalingFactor = (lowerConfidenceBound - threshold) * scalingSensitivity //scalingSensitivity is a tunable parameter
    newResources = currentResources * (1 + scalingFactor)
    scalingAction = "SCALE_UP"
    newResources = ROUND(newResources)
    RETURN scalingAction, newResources

  ELSE IF lowerConfidenceBound < threshold * 0.8:
    scalingFactor = (threshold * 0.8 - lowerConfidenceBound) * scalingSensitivity
    newResources = currentResources * (1 - scalingFactor)
    scalingAction = "SCALE_DOWN"
    newResources = ROUND(newResources)
    RETURN scalingAction, newResources

  ELSE:
    scalingAction = "NO_ACTION"
    RETURN scalingAction, currentResources
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `WorkloadShadow`: {`workloadID`, `historicalData`, `predictionModel`, `currentResources`, `scalingAction` }
*   `ArchitectureDiagram`: {`workloads`, `dependencies`, `predictedUtilization`, `scalingStatus` }

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   The predictive models are trained and updated asynchronously to minimize impact on application performance.
*   The scaling mechanism is designed to be idempotent and fault-tolerant.
