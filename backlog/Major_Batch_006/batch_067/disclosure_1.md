## Dynamic API 'Shadowing' for A/B Testing & Feature Rollout

**Concept:** Extend the metadata-driven request/response processing to facilitate seamless A/B testing and staged feature rollouts *without* code deployment. This is achieved by dynamically 'shadowing' API requests to alternate implementations based on client-specific metadata.

**Specification:**

1.  **Request Metadata Extension:**  Introduce a `shadowKey` field within the request object metadata. This key identifies a specific 'shadow' implementation for the request.  Default value is `null` (or empty string) signifying normal processing.

2.  **Shadow Implementation Registry:** A central registry (potentially a distributed key-value store) maps `shadowKey` values to executable function pointers or service endpoints.  This registry is dynamically updated, allowing for runtime configuration.

3.  **Pre-Processor Modification:** The pre-processor, upon receiving a request, checks for a non-empty `shadowKey`. If present, it consults the Shadow Implementation Registry.

4.  **Dynamic Routing:**
    *   If a mapping exists for the `shadowKey`, the pre-processor intercepts the request.
    *   Instead of invoking the standard request handler, it forwards the request (or a transformed version) to the mapped shadow implementation.
    *   The shadow implementation processes the request and returns a response.

5.  **Response Handling Modification:**  The post-processor receives the response from either the standard or shadow implementation. The post-processor then ensures the response format and fields are consistent with the expected API contract (potentially transforming the shadow response if needed). Metadata within the response identifies if the response originated from a shadow implementation.

6.  **Client Metadata Configuration:** Client-specific metadata (e.g., user ID, group membership, region) is used to dynamically assign `shadowKey` values. This can be achieved through a dedicated client metadata service or incorporated into the existing authentication/authorization flow.  This allows for fine-grained control over which clients participate in A/B tests or receive new features.

**Pseudocode (Pre-processor):**

```
function processRequest(requestObject):
    shadowKey = requestObject.metadata.shadowKey

    if (shadowKey != null and shadowKey != ""):
        shadowImplementation = ShadowImplementationRegistry.get(shadowKey)

        if (shadowImplementation != null):
            transformedRequest = transformRequestForShadow(requestObject, shadowImplementation)  //Potentially adapt the request
            response = shadowImplementation.execute(transformedRequest)
            return response //Bypass standard handler
        else:
            //Shadow key not found - log error and proceed with standard processing
            log("Shadow key not found: " + shadowKey)
            return standardRequestHandler(requestObject)
    else:
        return standardRequestHandler(requestObject)

```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ShadowImplementationRegistry`:  Key-Value Store (e.g., Redis, Etcd) mapping `shadowKey` (String) to a function pointer/service endpoint (String URL/Executable Code).
*   `RequestObject.metadata`:  JSON object containing `shadowKey` field.

**Use Cases:**

*   **A/B Testing:**  Dynamically route a percentage of requests to alternate implementations to compare performance/user behavior.
*   **Canary Deployments:**  Roll out new features to a small subset of users before full release.
*   **Feature Flags:** Enable/disable features for specific client groups without code changes.
*   **Emergency Rollbacks:** Quickly revert to a previous implementation if issues arise.
