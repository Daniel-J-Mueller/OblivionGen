## Dynamic Query Decomposition & Parallel Execution

**Concept:**  Extend the capacity utilization model to dynamically *decompose* complex nested queries into smaller, parallelizable sub-queries.  Instead of simply rejecting queries exceeding thresholds, break them down into manageable chunks.

**Specification:**

**1. Query Analyzer Module:**
    *   Input: Original nested query.
    *   Process:
        *   Identify nested query blocks (e.g., sub-selects, joins involving nested objects).
        *   Estimate capacity utilization for *each* block independently, using the existing model (operators, nesting level, operand count, object size).
        *   If any block exceeds capacity, attempt decomposition.
            *   Decomposition strategies:
                *   **Filter Pushdown:**  Move filter conditions to sub-queries to reduce data volume.
                *   **Join Reordering:**  Reorder join operations to optimize data flow and minimize intermediate result sizes.
                *   **Limit Introduction:**  Add `LIMIT` clauses to sub-queries to process data in batches.
                *   **Scalar Extraction:** If parts of the query involve scalar operations on nested fields, extract those operations into separate, lightweight queries.
            *   Record the decomposition strategy applied to each block.
    *   Output: Decomposed query plan (a tree-like structure representing the sub-queries and their dependencies).

**2. Parallel Execution Engine:**
    *   Input: Decomposed query plan.
    *   Process:
        *   Assign each sub-query to a different computing node (if available) or a thread within a node.
        *   Execute sub-queries in parallel.
        *   Manage dependencies between sub-queries (e.g., a sub-query might depend on the result of another).
        *   Combine results from parallel sub-queries to produce the final result.
    *   Output: Final query result.

**3.  Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Monitor CPU and I/O utilization during parallel execution.
    *   Adjust thresholds dynamically.
        *   If the system is underutilized, increase thresholds to allow more complex queries to be processed.
        *   If the system is overloaded, decrease thresholds to prevent further performance degradation.

**Pseudocode (Query Analyzer Module):**

```
function analyzeQuery(query):
  queryPlan = buildQueryPlan(query)
  for block in queryPlan.blocks:
    capacity = estimateCapacity(block)
    if capacity > maxCapacity:
      decompositionStrategy = findDecompositionStrategy(block)
      if decompositionStrategy != null:
        decomposeBlock(block, decompositionStrategy)
      else:
        rejectQuery("Query too complex")
  return queryPlan
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `QueryPlan`:  Tree structure representing the query. Each node is a query block.
*   `QueryBlock`: Represents a sub-query. Contains query string, estimated capacity, decomposition strategy (if any).
*   `DecompositionStrategy`: Enum (FilterPushdown, JoinReorder, LimitIntroduction, ScalarExtract).

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple rejection to *adaptive* query processing, maximizing resource utilization and potentially handling queries previously deemed impossible. It creates a more robust and scalable system. The dynamic threshold adjustment adds another layer of adaptation.
