## Adaptive Prediction & Phantom Input

**Concept:** Extend the idea of compensating for latency by *predicting* player actions and creating "phantom inputs" to smooth gameplay, but dynamically adjust the prediction horizon and weight based on network conditions *and* player skill/style. This moves beyond simply increasing hitboxes, and aims for a more fluid, less noticeable correction.

**Specs:**

**1. Player Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Collected:**  Input frequency, input pattern entropy (complexity of input sequences),  reaction time (time between stimulus and first input), consistency of movement (deviation from a predicted path), and network latency history.
*   **Output:**  A 'Skill/Style' profile represented as a vector. Higher values indicate faster reaction times, more complex input patterns, and greater consistency. This profile is updated continuously.

**2. Adaptive Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Player Skill/Style profile, current network latency, input buffer (last N inputs).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Prediction Horizon:** Calculated dynamically. Higher skill/style profiles = longer horizon (more prediction).  Higher latency = shorter horizon (less prediction, prioritize responsiveness).
    *   **Prediction Algorithm:**  Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically an LSTM, trained on player movement data. This LSTM predicts the next few inputs given the current state and history.  Alternative: a state-space model.
    *   **Phantom Input Generation:** Based on the RNN output, generate “phantom inputs” – hypothetical controller inputs – extending the prediction horizon.
    *   **Input Blending:**  Blend the actual player inputs with the phantom inputs.  Weighting determined by:
        *   Confidence of the RNN prediction (higher confidence = higher weight)
        *   Network latency (higher latency = higher weight)
        *   Skill/Style profile (higher skill = lower weight – skilled players require less prediction)
*   **Output:**  A smoothed input stream fed to the game engine.

**3.  Latency-Aware Hitbox Adjustment:**

*   **Process:**  While the primary correction is input smoothing, supplement with dynamic hitbox adjustment.
    *   Calculate the time delta between when an input *should* have arrived (based on expected latency) and when it *actually* arrived.
    *   Scale the hitbox size proportionally to this time delta.  However, *limit* the maximum scaling factor.
*   **Output:** Adjusted hitbox parameters.

**4.  Network Synchronization Protocol:**

*   **Process:** Implement a differential encoding scheme for player position updates.  Instead of sending absolute position data, send only the *change* in position relative to the last update.
*   **Frequency:** Adaptively adjust the update frequency based on network bandwidth and player velocity. Higher velocity = higher frequency.
*   **Smoothing:** Apply a Kalman filter to the received position updates to further smooth out jitter and reduce the impact of network latency.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_input(player_skill_profile, network_latency, input_buffer):
  prediction_horizon = calculate_horizon(player_skill_profile, network_latency)
  predicted_inputs = RNN(input_buffer, prediction_horizon)  // LSTM or similar

  confidence = RNN.confidence()

  blend_weight = calculate_blend_weight(confidence, network_latency, player_skill_profile)

  smoothed_input = blend(actual_input, predicted_inputs, blend_weight)

  return smoothed_input

function calculate_horizon(skill, latency):
  // Example: Longer horizon for skilled players, shorter for high latency
  horizon = base_horizon + (skill_factor * skill) - (latency_factor * latency)
  return max(0, horizon)

function calculate_blend_weight(confidence, latency, skill):
  // Higher confidence, higher latency, lower skill = higher weight
  weight = confidence_factor * confidence - latency_factor * latency + skill_factor * skill
  return clamp(weight, 0, 1)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Driven Prediction:** Train the RNN on a vast dataset of player movements and reactions to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Personalized Prediction:** Create a unique prediction model for each player based on their individual playing style.
*   **Context-Aware Prediction:** Consider the game state (e.g., combat, exploration) when generating predictions.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Use haptic feedback to signal to the player when the system is actively correcting for latency.
