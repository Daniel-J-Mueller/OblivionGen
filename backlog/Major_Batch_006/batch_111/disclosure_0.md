## Dynamic Social Graph Projection for Physical Space Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the social graph beyond digital interaction by projecting affinity scores onto physical spaces, creating dynamic, localized experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Network:** Deploy a network of low-energy Bluetooth beacons and/or UWB (Ultra-Wideband) sensors within designated physical spaces (e.g., office buildings, retail stores, event venues). These sensors detect the presence of users via their mobile devices (with explicit user opt-in and privacy controls).
*   **Social Graph Integration:** Integrate the sensor network with the existing social graph system (as described in the provided patent).  User presence data is correlated with the social graph, identifying individuals present and their relationships (as determined by affinity scores).
*   **Affinity-Based Spatial Effects:** Based on real-time affinity scores between users *present in the same physical space*, trigger localized “effects”. These effects could include:
    *   **Ambient Lighting Adjustment:**  Adjust ambient lighting color or intensity based on the collective affinity of those present. Higher average affinity = warmer/brighter lighting.
    *   **Localized Audio Zones:** Create small, directed audio zones.  Users with high affinity could hear shared music or informational content.  Users with low/no affinity would not.
    *   **Digital Signage Personalization:**  Dynamically adjust content on digital signage based on the demographics and collective affinities of those nearby.
    *   **Automated Physical Interactions:** Trigger subtle physical changes in the environment (e.g., a gentle breeze, a pleasant scent) based on affinity levels. (Requires appropriate hardware integration).
*   **Privacy Controls:** Implement robust privacy controls allowing users to:
    *   Opt-in/Opt-out of location tracking and data sharing.
    *   Control the granularity of their location data (e.g., share only building-level location, not specific room).
    *   View and manage their affinity data.
*   **Scoring & Calibration:**
    *   A 'proximity bonus' will be added to the affinity score. The closer two users are in the physical space, the stronger this bonus.
    *   An 'interaction history weight' to prioritize individuals the user has frequently interacted with in the digital realm.
    *   A 'dynamic decay factor' to gradually reduce the impact of physical proximity over time, preventing "stuck" affinity scores.

**Pseudocode (Effect Triggering):**

```
function trigger_effects(users_present, social_graph) {
  for (each user1 in users_present) {
    for (each user2 in users_present, where user2 != user1) {
      affinity_score = social_graph.get_affinity(user1, user2);
      proximity_bonus = calculate_proximity_bonus(user1, user2);
      combined_score = affinity_score + proximity_bonus;

      if (combined_score > threshold) {
        // Trigger a positive effect (e.g., warm lighting, shared audio)
        trigger_positive_effect(user1, user2);
      } else {
        //Maintain neutral settings.
      }
    }
  }
}

function calculate_proximity_bonus(user1, user2) {
  distance = calculate_distance(user1.location, user2.location);
  // Scale the bonus based on distance (closer = higher bonus)
  bonus = max_bonus * (1 - (distance / max_distance));
  return bonus;
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacons for general proximity detection.
*   UWB sensors for more precise location tracking (optional).
*   Smart lighting systems compatible with API control.
*   Directional audio speakers.
*   Environmental control systems (for scent/temperature adjustment).
