## Dynamic Mesh Resolution via Collaborative Edge Detection

**Concept:** Extend the 3D model refinement process by leveraging a network of devices to dynamically increase mesh resolution *only* where needed, based on real-time edge detection from multiple viewpoints. This significantly reduces processing load and data transfer compared to uniformly high-resolution models.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Roles:**
    *   *Primary Device:* Initiates model capture, manages overall scene data, communicates with secondary devices, and handles final mesh generation.
    *   *Secondary Devices:* Capture supplemental images/video, perform edge detection, and transmit edge data to the primary device.  Can be smartphones, tablets, dedicated sensors, or even other cameras.
*   **Data Transmission Protocol:**
    *   Utilize a low-latency, UDP-based protocol for transmitting edge data from secondary devices to the primary device.  Data packets should include:
        *   Device ID
        *   Timestamp
        *   Image/Video Frame Number
        *   Edge Pixel Coordinates (normalized to image dimensions)
        *   Edge Confidence Score (0.0 - 1.0, based on edge detection algorithm output)
*   **Edge Detection Algorithm:**
    *   Implement a hybrid edge detection approach:
        *   *Initial Pass:* Canny edge detection for robust edge detection in varying lighting conditions.
        *   *Refinement Pass:* Utilize a learned edge detector (e.g., based on a convolutional neural network) trained on a diverse dataset of edges to improve accuracy and reduce false positives.
*   **Mesh Resolution Algorithm:**
    *   Primary Device maintains a base mesh of the object.
    *   For each incoming edge data packet:
        *   Project the edge pixel coordinates into 3D space based on the device's pose (determined via simultaneous localization and mapping – SLAM – or visual inertial odometry – VIO).
        *   Identify the mesh triangles intersected by the projected edge.
        *   Subdivide the intersected triangles, increasing the mesh resolution in that local area. Subdivision level is proportional to the edge confidence score.
        *   A ‘resolution map’ is maintained, tracking the subdivision level of each triangle.
*   **Pose Estimation:**
    *   Employ a robust SLAM/VIO algorithm on the primary device to track the pose of all secondary devices in real-time. This is critical for accurately projecting edge data into 3D space.
    *   Secondary devices should broadcast unique identifiers (e.g., Bluetooth beacons or UWB signals) to aid in pose estimation.
*   **Data Fusion & Filtering:**
    *   Implement a Kalman filter to fuse edge data from multiple secondary devices, reducing noise and improving accuracy.
    *   Discard edge data with low confidence scores or inconsistent pose estimates.
*   **Rendering & Display:**
    *   The refined mesh can be rendered and displayed on the primary device or streamed to other devices for remote viewing.

**Pseudocode (Primary Device – Mesh Refinement):**

```
Initialize base mesh
Initialize resolution map (all triangles at level 0)
For each incoming edge data packet:
    device_id = packet.device_id
    edge_x = packet.edge_x
    edge_y = packet.edge_y
    confidence = packet.confidence

    pose = GetDevicePose(device_id) // Using SLAM/VIO

    world_x, world_y, world_z = ProjectEdgeToWorld(edge_x, edge_y, pose)

    intersected_triangles = FindTrianglesIntersectingPoint(world_x, world_y, world_z)

    For each triangle in intersected_triangles:
        current_level = resolution_map[triangle]
        new_level = min(current_level + 1, max_level) //Limit maximum resolution
        resolution_map[triangle] = new_level
        SubdivideTriangle(triangle, new_level)

UpdateMeshBasedOnResolutionMap() // Reconstruct mesh with refined details
```
