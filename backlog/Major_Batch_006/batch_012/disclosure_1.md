## Adaptive Session Stickiness & Tiered Caching

**Concept:** Extend the session management to incorporate a tiered caching system *and* a dynamically adjusted session "stickiness" based on client behavior and network conditions. This moves beyond simply caching session identifiers and lock states to actively influencing where client requests are routed, reducing latency and improving resilience.

**Specification:**

**I. Components:**

*   **Client Agent:** Software running on the client device. Responsible for initial session establishment and monitoring network conditions (latency, packet loss, bandwidth).
*   **Edge Nodes (EN):** A layer of geographically distributed servers acting as the first point of contact for client requests. These nodes perform initial request validation and session lookup.
*   **Core Nodes (CN):** Centralized servers responsible for metadata management, lock state tracking, and long-term session persistence.
*   **Session Affinity Manager (SAM):** A distributed service responsible for dynamically assigning and adjusting session “stickiness” weights.
*   **Tiered Cache:** A multi-level cache architecture:
    *   **L1 Cache (EN):** Fastest, smallest cache holding frequently accessed session identifiers, lock states, and lease information. TTL: seconds.
    *   **L2 Cache (CN):** Larger, slower cache holding complete session metadata. TTL: minutes.
    *   **Persistent Storage:** Long-term storage for session data.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Session Establishment:** Client requests a session. SAM assigns an initial “stickiness” weight (0-100) based on client location and network conditions (default: 50).
2.  **Request Routing:** The Client Agent sends requests to the nearest Edge Node. The Edge Node checks its L1 cache for the session identifier.
    *   **Cache Hit (L1):** Request is processed locally.
    *   **Cache Miss (L1):** Edge Node queries the Core Node for session metadata. Metadata is cached in L1.
3.  **Dynamic Stickiness Adjustment:** SAM continuously monitors client behavior (request frequency, data volume, error rates) and network conditions.
    *   **Good Conditions/Behavior:** Increase stickiness weight. Subsequent requests are more likely to be routed to the *same* Edge Node.
    *   **Poor Conditions/Behavior:** Decrease stickiness weight.  Requests are routed to a *different* Edge Node. This provides load balancing and resilience against failures.
4.  **Tiered Caching:**
    *   Frequently accessed lock states and lease information are cached in L1.
    *   Complete session metadata is cached in L2.
    *   Persistent storage serves as the ultimate source of truth.
5.  **Lease Renewal Optimization:** When a lease is nearing expiration, the Edge Node proactively sends a batched renewal request to the Core Node.  The request includes lease renewals for multiple sessions handled by that Edge Node. This reduces the number of round trips to the Core Node.
6.  **Node Failure Handling:** If an Edge Node fails, SAM automatically adjusts the stickiness weights for affected sessions, routing requests to healthy Edge Nodes.

**III. Pseudocode (SAM - Stickiness Weight Adjustment):**

```pseudocode
function adjustStickiness(sessionID, edgeNodeID, networkLatency, requestRate, errorRate):
  baseWeight = 50
  weightAdjustment = 0

  // Network Latency Adjustment
  if networkLatency < 50ms:
    weightAdjustment += 10
  elif networkLatency > 200ms:
    weightAdjustment -= 10

  // Request Rate Adjustment
  if requestRate > 100 requests/second:
    weightAdjustment += 5
  elif requestRate < 10 requests/second:
    weightAdjustment -= 5

  // Error Rate Adjustment
  if errorRate > 5%:
    weightAdjustment -= 15
  elif errorRate < 1%:
    weightAdjustment += 10

  // Apply Adjustment (ensure weight stays within 0-100)
  newWeight = clamp(baseWeight + weightAdjustment, 0, 100)

  // Update Session Stickiness in Distributed Store
  updateSessionStickiness(sessionID, edgeNodeID, newWeight)
```

**IV. Data Structures:**

*   **Session Metadata:**  {sessionID, clientID,  edgeNodeID, stickinessWeight, leaseExpiration, lockStates}
*   **Distributed Stickiness Store:** Key-Value store mapping sessionID to Session Metadata.

**V. Benefits:**

*   Reduced Latency:  Caching and stickiness minimize the need to access the Core Node.
*   Improved Resilience: Dynamic routing and load balancing mitigate the impact of node failures.
*   Optimized Lease Renewals: Batched requests reduce network overhead.
*   Enhanced Scalability:  Distribution of session management across Edge Nodes.
