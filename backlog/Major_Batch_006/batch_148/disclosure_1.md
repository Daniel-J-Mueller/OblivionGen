## Modular Acoustic Focusing Shell

**Concept:** An external, dynamically adjustable acoustic shell that attaches to the cylindrical housing described in the patent. This shell focuses and directs audio output, creating localized sound zones or immersive spatial audio experiences.

**Specifications:**

*   **Material:** Lightweight, flexible polymer composite with embedded piezoelectric actuators. Internal damping layer to minimize resonance.
*   **Structure:** Composed of multiple (e.g., 8-16) independently controllable segments. Each segment is a curved acoustic reflector.
*   **Attachment:** Magnetic or clip-on mechanism for secure attachment to the existing cylindrical housing. Minimal interference with existing ports/buttons.
*   **Actuation:** Each segment is controlled by dedicated piezoelectric actuators. Voltage applied to actuators adjusts the curvature of the segment, altering the direction and focus of sound waves.
*   **Control System:** Integrated with the device’s onboard processor or controllable via external Bluetooth connection. User interface allows for pre-set acoustic profiles (e.g., “personal zone”, “wide dispersal”, “immersive surround”).
*   **Power:** Draws power from the host device via USB-C or wireless charging. Low-power consumption design.
*   **Sensors:** Optional array of microphones embedded within the shell to analyze the surrounding acoustic environment and optimize focusing parameters.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Inputs:
//   targetDirection: desired direction of focused audio (degrees)
//   focusRadius: desired radius of focused audio zone (meters)
//   ambientNoiseLevel: current ambient noise level (dB)

// Outputs:
//   segmentAngles: array of angles for each segment actuator

function adjustAcousticShell(targetDirection, focusRadius, ambientNoiseLevel) {
  // Calculate initial segment angles based on target direction and focus radius
  initialAngles = calculateInitialAngles(targetDirection, focusRadius);

  // Apply noise cancellation adjustments
  noiseAdjustedAngles = applyNoiseCancellation(initialAngles, ambientNoiseLevel);

  // Apply room acoustics compensation (optional – requires room mapping)
  compensatedAngles = applyRoomCompensation(noiseAdjustedAngles);

  // Limit actuator range to prevent damage
  clampedAngles = clampAngles(compensatedAngles);

  return clampedAngles;
}

function calculateInitialAngles(targetDirection, focusRadius) {
  // Use ray tracing or similar algorithm to determine optimal angles
  // for each segment to focus sound at targetDirection and focusRadius
  // This is the most complex part of the algorithm
  // ...Implementation details omitted...
}

function applyNoiseCancellation(angles, noiseLevel) {
  // Adjust angles to minimize sound leakage in directions of high noise
  // Use a simple rule-based system or more advanced signal processing techniques
  // ...Implementation details omitted...
}

function applyRoomCompensation(angles) {
  // Use room mapping data to compensate for reflections and standing waves
  // ...Implementation details omitted...
}

function clampAngles(angles) {
  // Limit the range of each angle to prevent damage to the actuators
  // ...Implementation details omitted...
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Personalized Audio:** Create a focused audio zone for a single user, even in a noisy environment.
*   **Immersive Gaming/VR:** Enhance spatial audio for more realistic and immersive gaming and VR experiences.
*   **Directed Notifications:** Deliver notifications directly to the user without disturbing others.
*   **Conference Calls:** Improve audio clarity and reduce echo during conference calls.
*   **Accessibility:** Aid hearing-impaired individuals by focusing sound directly into their ears.
