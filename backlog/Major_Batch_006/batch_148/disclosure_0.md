## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Composition with Generative Pre-training

**Concept:** Extend the self-supervised learning framework to not just *detect* acoustic events, but to *compose* entirely new, coherent acoustic scenes. Leverage generative pre-training to build a robust model capable of synthesizing realistic soundscapes based on high-level scene descriptions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Augmentation:**

*   **Dataset:** Create a diverse dataset of isolated sound events (e.g., bird song, car horn, speech, rain) with precise temporal boundaries. Include metadata describing each event’s semantic category and acoustic characteristics.
*   **Scene Templates:** Develop a library of "scene templates" defining broad acoustic environments (e.g., “urban park,” “coastal beach,” “indoor cafe”). Each template defines statistical distributions for the *types* and *densities* of sound events expected in that scene.
*   **Procedural Generation:** Implement a procedural generator to create synthetic acoustic scenes from templates. This generator samples events from the defined distributions, varying their timing, amplitude, and spatial positioning (simulated stereo/multichannel). This will involve a probability distribution for event occurrence per unit time, as well as a spatial distribution for event placement to mimic sound source localization.
*   **Data Augmentation:** Employ techniques like pitch shifting, time stretching, and adding background noise to both isolated events and generated scenes to increase dataset variability.

**2. Model Architecture:**

*   **Generative Pre-training:** Train a large-scale transformer-based model (similar to GPT) on the augmented dataset of isolated sound events and synthetic scenes. The model learns to predict subsequent audio frames given a context window of previous frames. Utilize masked audio modeling to encourage the model to learn robust representations.
*   **Scene Description Embedding:** Develop a method to embed high-level scene descriptions (e.g., “rainy urban street with distant traffic”) into a vector representation. This could involve natural language processing techniques or a manually designed ontology.
*   **Conditional Scene Generation:**  Fine-tune the pre-trained model to generate acoustic scenes *conditional* on the scene description embedding.  This will involve concatenating the embedding to the input sequence of audio frames.
*   **Acoustic Event Insertion:** Incorporate a mechanism for explicitly inserting specific acoustic events into the generated scene. This could involve using attention mechanisms to focus on relevant time steps or directly manipulating the predicted audio frames.

**3. System Components:**

*   **Scene Description Interface:**  A user interface for defining scene descriptions. This could be a simple text box or a more sophisticated graphical editor.
*   **Scene Generator Module:**  The core module responsible for generating acoustic scenes based on the scene description. This module will utilize the fine-tuned generative model.
*   **Real-time Rendering Engine:** A real-time audio rendering engine to synthesize the generated soundscape.
*   **Spatialization Engine:** A spatialization engine to simulate the spatial positioning of sound sources.
*   **Federated Learning Integration:** Enable federated learning to personalize the scene generator for individual users. User-specific preferences and acoustic environments can be learned without sharing raw audio data.

**Pseudocode - Scene Generation:**

```
function generate_scene(scene_description):
  embedding = embed_scene_description(scene_description)
  initial_context = generate_initial_audio_context() # e.g., a few seconds of ambient sound
  generated_audio = initial_context
  for time_step in range(desired_scene_duration):
    input_sequence = [generated_audio[-context_window_size:], embedding]
    predicted_frame = generative_model.predict(input_sequence)
    generated_audio.append(predicted_frame)
    # (Optional) Event insertion logic
    if random() < event_insertion_probability:
      event = sample_event_from_distribution(scene_description)
      generated_audio[-1] = mix_event_into_frame(generated_audio[-1], event)
  return generated_audio
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality:** Create immersive and realistic soundscapes for VR/AR experiences.
*   **Accessibility:** Generate audio descriptions of visual scenes for visually impaired users.
*   **Entertainment:** Create dynamic and personalized audio experiences for games and music.
*   **Smart Environments:**  Generate adaptive soundscapes for smart homes and offices.
*   **Acoustic Privacy:** Generate masking sounds to protect acoustic privacy.
