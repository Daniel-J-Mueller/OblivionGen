## Dynamic Content 'Pre-Taste' Generation

**Concept:** Extend the "enriched content" idea beyond metadata and simple indicators to generate short-form, AI-driven previews tailored to individual user profiles, *before* the full electronic media item is released. This isn't about summarizing; it's about constructing a compelling "taste" of the experience.

**Specs:**

**1. User Profile Integration:**
    *   Data Sources: Integrate with existing user data (reading history, preferences, demographics, social media activity - with appropriate permissions).
    *   Preference Vectors: Generate multi-dimensional preference vectors representing user tastes (genre, style, tone, complexity, emotional resonance).

**2. Content Dissection & Feature Extraction:**
    *   Input: Electronic media item (text, audio, video).
    *   Process:  AI-powered analysis to identify key scenes, arguments, character interactions, musical motifs, etc. (Not just keywords, but *semantic* understanding).
    *   Output:  Structured representation of content with associated features (emotional valence, thematic relevance, complexity score, stylistic markers).

**3. ‘Pre-Taste’ Generation Engine:**
    *   Input: User preference vector, structured content representation.
    *   Process:
        *   **Selection:** Algorithm selects content segments most aligned with the user's preferences. Prioritize emotionally resonant segments.
        *   **Adaptation:**
            *   **Text:** AI rewrites/summarizes segments to match the user’s preferred reading level/style. Emphasis on ‘hook’ sentences.
            *   **Audio:** AI-generated music/soundscapes layered with key dialogue/narration.
            *   **Video:**  AI creates short, dynamic highlight reels with accelerated pacing & impactful editing.
        *   **Composition:** Stitch selected/adapted segments into a cohesive "pre-taste" (target length: 30-60 seconds). 
    *   Output: Short-form "pre-taste" media item.

**4. Delivery & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Delivery:  Serve "pre-taste" to the user *before* the full media item is released (e.g., as a preview within an app, a short video ad, an email attachment).
    *   Feedback:  Track user engagement with the "pre-taste" (play duration, completion rate, click-through rate, social shares).
    *   Refinement: Use engagement data to refine user preference vectors & the "pre-taste" generation algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function generatePreTaste(userProfile, mediaItem) {
  contentFeatures = analyzeMedia(mediaItem);
  userPreferences = getUserPreferences(userProfile);

  relevantSegments = selectSegments(contentFeatures, userPreferences);
  adaptedSegments = adaptSegments(relevantSegments, userPreferences);
  preTaste = composePreTaste(adaptedSegments);

  return preTaste;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires significant processing power for AI analysis & content adaptation (GPU acceleration).
*   Cloud-based architecture for scalability & parallel processing.
*   Machine learning models trained on vast datasets of media content & user engagement data.
*   API integration with existing content delivery platforms.
