## Adaptive Sensor Mesh for Aerial Vehicles

**Concept:** Integrate a dynamically reconfigurable mesh of micro-sensors across the aerial vehicle's surface, beyond fixed wing/corner placements. This enables a truly 360Â° adaptable perception system, responding to environmental conditions and task requirements.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Modules:**
    *   Size: 5mm x 5mm x 2mm
    *   Type: Micro-optical flow sensors, miniature RGB cameras (global shutter), and short-range LiDAR/ToF modules. Each module contains a processing unit capable of edge computing.
    *   Communication: Wireless mesh networking (IEEE 802.11ah/802.15.6) with high bandwidth and low latency.
    *   Power: Individual micro-batteries (solid state) with inductive charging capability.
    *   Mounting: Magnetic adhesion with variable strength.

*   **Vehicle Surface:**
    *   Material: Non-conductive, lightweight composite with embedded micro-magnets. Grid-like pattern for precise module placement.
    *   Surface Finish: Low-reflectivity coating to minimize interference.

*   **Control System:**
    *   Central Processing Unit: High-performance embedded system for sensor data fusion and control.
    *   Software:
        *   Dynamic Mesh Management: Algorithm to optimize sensor placement based on task requirements (e.g., obstacle avoidance, target tracking, 3D mapping).
        *   Sensor Fusion: Kalman filtering/SLAM algorithms to combine data from all sensors.
        *   Adaptive Sampling: Adjust sampling rates and sensor configurations based on environmental conditions and perceived risk.
        *   Predictive Analytics: AI to predict environmental changes and proactively adjust sensor configurations.

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Wide Area Surveillance:** Maximize sensor coverage for broad environmental awareness.
    *   **Focused Tracking:** Concentrate sensors on a specific target for detailed tracking.
    *   **High-Resolution Mapping:** Deploy sensors in a dense grid for detailed 3D mapping.
    *   **Redundancy Mode:** Automatically redistribute sensors to compensate for failures.
    *   **Low-Power Mode:** Minimize sensor activity to conserve energy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Mesh Reconfiguration):**

```
function reconfigure_mesh(task_type, environment_data):
  if task_type == "obstacle_avoidance":
    // Prioritize sensors facing potential obstacles
    sensor_priority = calculate_obstacle_priority(environment_data)
    reposition_sensors(sensor_priority, "forward_facing")

  elif task_type == "target_tracking":
    // Concentrate sensors on target location
    target_location = get_target_location()
    reposition_sensors(target_location, "target_centered")

  elif task_type == "3d_mapping":
    // Create dense sensor grid
    create_sensor_grid(density = "high")

  else:
    // Default configuration for general awareness
    create_sensor_grid(density = "medium")

function calculate_obstacle_priority(environment_data):
  // Analyze environment data (LiDAR, cameras) to identify obstacles
  obstacles = detect_obstacles(environment_data)
  // Calculate priority based on distance, size, and velocity
  priority = calculate_priority(obstacles)
  return priority
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond fixed sensor placements by creating a *reconfigurable* perception system. The dynamic mesh allows for adaptable perception tailored to specific tasks and environmental conditions, significantly improving situational awareness and overall performance. The magnetic adhesion system offers quick and reliable sensor adjustments in flight.
