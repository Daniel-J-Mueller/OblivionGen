## Dynamic Segment Composition with Predictive Buffering

**Specification:** A system for dynamically composing video segments *before* they are fully received, leveraging predictive buffering and adaptive fragment prioritization. This moves beyond simply reacting to buffer levels, and proactively constructs segments for smoother playback, particularly on variable bandwidth networks.

**Core Concept:** The system predicts upcoming segment requirements based on playback rate, known video characteristics (e.g., scene changes indicating higher bitrates), and *historical network performance*. It then prioritizes the download of fragments *within* CMAF chunks that are most critical for completing these predicted segments.

**Components:**

1.  **Predictive Buffer Manager (PBM):**  Resides on the user device.
    *   **Playback Rate Monitor:** Tracks current playback speed and predicts future frame display times.
    *   **Video Analyzer:** Analyzes incoming CMAF chunks for video complexity (scene changes, motion vectors).  Assigns a “complexity score” to each fragment.
    *   **Network Performance History:** Maintains a rolling history of network bandwidth, latency, and packet loss.
    *   **Segment Prediction Engine:** Combines playback rate, video complexity, and network history to *predict* the fragments needed to construct the *next two* segments.  Assigns a priority score to each predicted fragment.

2.  **Fragment Prioritization Engine (FPE):**
    *   Intercepts incoming CMAF fragments.
    *   Consults the PBM for priority scores.
    *   Adjusts download prioritization within the network stack (e.g., using TCP priority settings or a custom UDP protocol) to favor high-priority fragments.

3.  **Adaptive Fragment Requesting (AFR):**
    *   Modifies the standard DASH/CMAF requesting behavior.
    *   Instead of requesting entire segments, AFR requests fragments individually, guided by the PBM’s priority scores.
    *   Supports “speculative downloading” – requesting fragments *before* they are strictly required, if network conditions are favorable and the PBM predicts a high probability of needing them.

**Pseudocode (PBM - Segment Prediction):**

```
function predict_next_segments(current_time, playback_rate, network_history, video_complexity):
  predicted_segments = []
  for i in range(2):  # Predict next 2 segments
    segment_start_time = current_time + (i * segment_duration)
    required_fragments = []
    for fragment in segment_fragments:
      if fragment.start_time >= segment_start_time and fragment.start_time < segment_start_time + segment_duration:
        priority = calculate_fragment_priority(fragment, playback_rate, network_history, video_complexity)
        required_fragments.append((fragment, priority))

    predicted_segments.append(required_fragments)

  return predicted_segments

function calculate_fragment_priority(fragment, playback_rate, network_history, video_complexity):
  priority = 0
  priority += fragment.video_complexity_score * 0.5
  priority += (1 / network_history.average_latency) * 0.3 #Higher priority for lower latency
  priority += (playback_rate * 0.2) # Higher playback rates may need more bandwidth

  return priority
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Fragment:** `{start_time, duration, size, video_complexity_score}`
*   **NetworkHistory:** `{average_latency, average_bandwidth, packet_loss_rate}`

**Enhancements:**

*   **Peer-to-Peer Fragment Sharing:**  Allow nearby devices to share frequently requested fragments, reducing network load.
*   **AI-Powered Prediction:** Train a machine learning model to predict fragment requirements based on a wider range of factors (user viewing history, content metadata, time of day, etc.).
*   **Dynamic ABR Adjustment:**  Integrate with existing Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) algorithms to make more informed bitrate decisions based on predicted network conditions and buffer levels.
