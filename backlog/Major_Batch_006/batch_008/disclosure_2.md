**Electrowetting Haptic Feedback Array**

**Specifications:**

*   **Display Type:** Electrowetting display (as per provided patent baseline).
*   **Pixel Structure:** Each pixel comprises four electrodes â€“ a primary display electrode, and three auxiliary haptic electrodes. These are all individually addressable.
*   **Fluid Composition:** Two immiscible fluids. The primary fluid is a low-viscosity, conductive fluid. The secondary fluid is a dielectric fluid with micro-capsules containing a magnetorheological (MR) fluid dispersed within.
*   **Electrode Arrangement:**  The four electrodes are arranged in a square pattern, with the primary display electrode occupying the central portion. The haptic electrodes surround the primary electrode.
*   **Control System:** A microcontroller with dedicated PWM outputs for each electrode within each pixel.
*   **Haptic Mechanism:** By selectively applying voltages to the haptic electrodes, the MR fluid within the micro-capsules can be polarized, creating localized changes in fluid viscosity and surface tension. This results in subtle, localized deformations of the display surface, perceivable as haptic feedback.
*   **Addressing Scheme:** A combination of display voltage applied to the primary electrode (for image rendering) and haptic voltages to the surrounding electrodes. PWM duty cycle controls the intensity of both visual and haptic effects.
*   **Resolution:** Scalable depending on electrode density.
*   **Materials:** Transparent conductive materials (ITO, etc.) for electrodes. Thin-film encapsulation to prevent fluid leakage.

**Detailed Operation:**

1.  **Visual Rendering:** The primary electrode controls the movement of the conductive fluid, creating the image. Standard electrowetting principles apply.
2.  **Haptic Feedback:**
    *   The control system analyzes the displayed image (or receives haptic event data).
    *   Based on the image data, the control system activates specific haptic electrodes. For example, edges, textures, or interactive elements would trigger localized haptic feedback.
    *   Applying a voltage to a haptic electrode causes the nearby MR fluid micro-capsules to align and increase viscosity. This creates a slight elevation or indentation on the display surface.
    *   Rapid switching of haptic electrodes can simulate dynamic textures or directional forces.
    *   Haptic intensity is controlled by PWM duty cycle and voltage amplitude.
3.  **Synchronized Control:** The control system needs to synchronize visual and haptic updates for a seamless user experience.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
for each pixel:
    // Visual Update
    set_primary_electrode_voltage(pixel.visual_data)

    // Haptic Update
    if pixel.haptic_event_triggered:
        // Determine haptic effect based on event
        effect = get_haptic_effect(pixel.haptic_event)

        // Activate haptic electrodes based on effect
        if effect == "edge":
            activate_haptic_electrodes(pixel, "top", "bottom")
        elif effect == "texture":
            activate_haptic_electrodes(pixel, "all")
        // ... other effects ...

    else:
        deactivate_all_haptic_electrodes(pixel)
```
