## Adaptive Proximity-Based Audio Beaconing & Layered Communication

**Concept:** Extend the proximity-based communication to include dynamic audio beaconing and layered communication channels, creating a more robust and nuanced system for group and individual interaction. Instead of solely relying on speech *initiating* a connection, the system proactively broadcasts low-energy audio ‘beacons’ indicating device presence and availability, layering communication based on user activity and proximity.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Roles:**
    *   **Primary Device:**  User’s main communication device (e.g., smartphone, smartwatch).
    *   **Secondary Devices:** Headless devices or wearables with limited UI, designed for proximity detection and relaying information. These include dedicated beacon emitters, environmental sensors, and potentially even smart clothing.
*   **Beaconing System:**
    *   **Low-Energy Audio Beacons:** Each device periodically emits short, uniquely identifiable audio beacons (sub-audible or very low volume). These beacons contain device ID, availability status (e.g., ‘available’, ‘busy’, ‘do not disturb’), and potentially rudimentary contextual information (e.g., ‘in meeting’, ‘driving’).
    *   **Beacon Modulation:** Utilize Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) or Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) for robust beacon transmission even in noisy environments.
    *   **Beacon Range:** Adjustable beacon range (1m - 30m) to control device discovery radius.
*   **Layered Communication Channels:**
    *   **Proximity-Triggered Voice Channels:** Existing functionality – high-volume speech triggers direct 2-way voice link between devices.
    *   **Beacon-Initiated Whisper Channels:** If two devices detect each other’s beacons *and* a user initiates a low-volume speech command (“Whisper to [User Name]”), a dedicated, low-latency audio link is established. Intended for discreet communication.
    *   **Broadcast Channels:**  Devices within a defined proximity can opt-in to a broadcast channel for announcements or shared information. The Primary Device manages access control and content filtering.
    *   **Contextual Channels:**  Based on detected environmental data (from secondary devices) or user activity (e.g., walking, driving), the system automatically creates and joins appropriate communication channels.
*   **Device Detection & Association:**
    *   **Triangulation:** Employ multiple Secondary Devices to triangulate device locations with improved accuracy.
    *   **Wearable Association:** Utilize Bluetooth or UWB to establish persistent associations between users and their Primary/Secondary Devices.
    *   **AI-Powered User Recognition:** Integrate facial or voice recognition to identify users and their preferences, allowing for automated channel assignment and access control.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Centralized Management Server:** Handles user accounts, device registration, channel configuration, and data analytics.
    *   **Distributed Processing:** Most communication processing is handled locally on the devices to minimize latency and bandwidth usage.
    *   **API for Third-Party Integration:** Allow developers to create custom channels and applications that leverage the proximity-based communication system.

**Pseudocode (Beacon Processing):**

```
// Device: Primary or Secondary

loop:
    broadcastBeacon(deviceId, availabilityStatus, contextualData)
    listenForBeacons()

function listenForBeacons():
    detectedBeacons = receiveBeacons()
    for each beacon in detectedBeacons:
        if beacon.deviceId != myDeviceId:
            updateDeviceLocation(beacon.deviceId, beacon.signalStrength)
            if beacon.availabilityStatus == "available":
                addBeaconToProximityList(beacon.deviceId)

function addBeaconToProximityList(deviceId):
    if deviceId not in proximityList:
        proximityList.append(deviceId)
        triggerProximityEvent(deviceId) // Notify applications of new nearby device
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple speech-triggered communication to a more proactive and layered system, leveraging low-energy beacons for continuous presence detection and enabling diverse communication scenarios beyond direct voice calls. The system dynamically adjusts communication channels based on context and user activity, creating a more intuitive and responsive experience.
