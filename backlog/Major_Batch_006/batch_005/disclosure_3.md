## Adaptive Data Ghosts & Predictive Pre-Deletion

**Concept:** Extend the logical deletion mechanism to create ‘data ghosts’ – minimal metadata representations of deleted objects – coupled with a predictive pre-deletion system based on access patterns.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Ghost Creation & Storage**

1.  **Metadata Subset:** Upon logical deletion (creation of a delete marker), instead of simply storing the marker, preserve a configurable subset of the object’s metadata.  This includes:
    *   Creation Timestamp
    *   Last Access Timestamp
    *   Object Type/Class
    *   Associated Tags/Labels
    *   Original Data Size (for capacity planning/reporting)
    *   User/Application that initiated deletion
2.  **Ghost Storage Tier:**  Store data ghosts in a separate, highly compressed, and low-cost storage tier (e.g., object storage with lifecycle policies optimized for infrequent access).
3.  **Ghost Expiration:**  Implement configurable expiration policies for data ghosts.  Expiration can be based on time since deletion or, more intelligently, on access patterns (see Predictive Pre-Deletion below).

**II. Predictive Pre-Deletion System**

1.  **Access Pattern Monitoring:** Continuously monitor access patterns to all objects (both live and deleted).  Track metrics such as:
    *   Frequency of Access (per user/application/object type)
    *   Time Since Last Access
    *   Read/Write Ratio
2.  **Anomaly Detection:** Employ machine learning algorithms to detect anomalies in access patterns.  This could include:
    *   Sudden drops in access frequency
    *   Unusual access patterns (e.g., access from a new location)
    *   Correlations between access patterns and external events (e.g., security alerts).
3.  **Pre-Deletion Recommendation Engine:** Based on access pattern analysis, the engine will recommend objects for pre-deletion (logical deletion) *before* they are explicitly deleted.
    *   **Thresholds:**  Configure thresholds for access frequency and time since last access. Objects falling below these thresholds are flagged for pre-deletion.
    *   **User Confirmation:**  Before pre-deletion, provide a mechanism for users to confirm the recommendation or override it.
    *   **Automated Pre-Deletion:** Enable an option for automated pre-deletion based on the recommendation engine.

**III.  Implementation Details**

1.  **API Extension:**  Add new API endpoints for:
    *   Retrieving data ghost metadata.
    *   Configuring data ghost retention policies.
    *   Accessing pre-deletion recommendations.
2.  **Data Structures:** 
    ```
    DataGhost {
        objectKey: String,
        creationTimestamp: Timestamp,
        lastAccessTimestamp: Timestamp,
        objectType: String,
        tags: List<String>,
        originalDataSize: Long,
        deletionUser: String
    }
    
    PreDeletionRecommendation {
        objectKey: String,
        reason: String,
        confidence: Float
    }
    ```
3.  **Pseudocode (Predictive Pre-Deletion Logic):**
    ```
    function generatePreDeletionRecommendations():
        for each object in dataStore:
            if object.lastAccessTimestamp < thresholdTime:
                recommendation = new PreDeletionRecommendation(object.objectKey, "Inactivity", 0.8)
                addRecommendation(recommendation)
            else if object.accessFrequency < thresholdFrequency:
                recommendation = new PreDeletionRecommendation(object.objectKey, "Low Usage", 0.7)
                addRecommendation(recommendation)
    ```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced storage costs.
*   Improved data governance.
*   Proactive data lifecycle management.
*   Enhanced security by identifying and purging stale data.
*   Data auditing capabilities using ghost metadata.
