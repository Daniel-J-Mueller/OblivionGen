**Adaptive Privilege Escalation Based on Behavioral Biometrics**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the reset verification process by incorporating continuous behavioral biometric authentication *during* the restricted access period, allowing for granular privilege restoration *before* explicit verification. This moves beyond a binary 'verified/not verified' state to a continuous trust score.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometrics Engine:** Monitors user interactions (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, touch pressure, app usage patterns) during the restricted access period. This engine leverages machine learning models trained on established user behavior.
*   **Trust Score Calculator:**  Aggregates data from the Behavioral Biometrics Engine to generate a real-time Trust Score representing the likelihood that the current user is the legitimate account owner.
*   **Dynamic Privilege Manager:** Adjusts account privileges based on the Trust Score.  Instead of waiting for explicit verification, the system can:
    *   Restore limited privileges (e.g., viewing non-sensitive data) at a high Trust Score.
    *   Gradually increase privilege levels as the Trust Score rises.
    *   Maintain restrictions or even further restrict access if the Trust Score drops.
*   **Notification System:** Continues to present the traditional reset notification alongside the biometric authentication process.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  Credential change request received.
2.  Access to sensitive privileges restricted. Limited privileges granted based on pre-defined policy.
3.  Reset notification sent via standard channels.
4.  Behavioral Biometrics Engine begins monitoring user interactions.
5.  Trust Score calculated continuously.
6.  Dynamic Privilege Manager adjusts privilege levels based on Trust Score thresholds.
    *   *Example:* Trust Score > 70% - Restore access to email. Trust Score > 90% - Restore access to financial transactions.
7.  Upon successful explicit verification (via notification response), Trust Score reset to baseline and full privileges restored.

**IV. Pseudocode (Dynamic Privilege Manager):**

```
function adjustPrivileges(trustScore) {
  if (trustScore < 30) {
    // Severely restrict access
    setPrivileges(["view non-sensitive data only"]);
  } else if (trustScore >= 30 && trustScore < 60) {
    // Limited access - email, browsing
    setPrivileges(["email", "browsing", "view non-sensitive data"]);
  } else if (trustScore >= 60 && trustScore < 80) {
    // Moderate access - add document editing
    setPrivileges(["email", "browsing", "document editing", "view non-sensitive data"]);
  } else {
    // Full access
    setPrivileges(["all"]);
  }
}

function updateTrustScore(userActivity) {
  // Analyze userActivity (keystrokes, mouse movements, etc.)
  // Return a value between 0 and 100 representing the trust score
  // (ML model performs the actual analysis)
}

// Main loop
while (resetVerificationPending) {
  userActivity = getCurrentUserActivity();
  trustScore = updateTrustScore(userActivity);
  adjustPrivileges(trustScore);
  sleep(1); // Check every 1 second
}
```

**V. Considerations:**

*   **Privacy:** User behavior data must be handled securely and transparently.  Users should be informed about data collection and have control over their privacy settings.
*   **False Positives/Negatives:** The ML model needs to be robust to avoid incorrectly identifying legitimate users or allowing unauthorized access. Continuous training and refinement are essential.
*   **Device Fingerprinting:** Integrate device fingerprinting to further enhance security and detect anomalous access attempts.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system should adapt to changes in user behavior over time.
