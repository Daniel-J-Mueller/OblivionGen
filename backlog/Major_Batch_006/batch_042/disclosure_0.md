## Dynamic Workflow 'Shadowing' & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the system's ability to define workflows based on historical data by introducing 'shadow workflows' – near-real-time replications of currently running workflows. This allows for predictive resource allocation *before* actions are fully defined, optimizing for cost *and* responsiveness.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** 'Workflow Shadowing Engine' – integrates with the existing Workflow Management Component.
*   **Data Input:** Real-time telemetry data from executing workflows – action start/end times, resource utilization (CPU, memory, network), cost data.
*   **Data Storage:** ‘Shadow Workflow Repository’ – time-series database optimized for storing and querying real-time workflow data.
*   **Algorithm:** 
    1.  As a workflow initiates, a 'shadow workflow' is created in the Repository.
    2.  Each action in the live workflow is mirrored in the shadow workflow, with data streamed from the live execution.
    3.  A predictive model (e.g., LSTM, time-series forecasting) is trained on the shadow workflow data *as it executes*. This model predicts resource requirements (CPU, memory, network, cost) for *future* actions.
    4.  Resource allocation requests for upcoming actions are pre-emptive, based on model predictions. This utilizes a 'Resource Reservation Pool' – pre-allocated resources that can be quickly spun up for new actions.
    5.  The system actively monitors the deviation between predicted and actual resource usage. Model weights are adjusted in real-time to improve prediction accuracy.
    6.  A 'Confidence Score' is assigned to each prediction. Low confidence predictions trigger a fallback mechanism - standard resource allocation based on historical data, or manual intervention.

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /shadow/create/{workflowID}` – Creates a shadow workflow for a given workflow.
    *   `GET /shadow/{workflowID}/prediction/{actionID}` – Returns resource predictions for a specific action.
    *   `PUT /shadow/{workflowID}/feedback/{actionID}/{actualResourceUsage}` – Provides feedback to the model on actual resource usage.

*   **Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Module):**

    ```
    function allocateResources(actionID, workflowID):
        prediction = getPrediction(actionID, workflowID)
        if prediction.confidence > threshold:
            resources = prediction.resources
            reserveResources(resources)
            return resources
        else:
            historicalResources = getHistoricalResources(actionID)
            reserveResources(historicalResources)
            return historicalResources
    ```

*   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage failed resource reservations or inaccurate predictions. Provide alerts to administrators when predictions deviate significantly from actual usage.
