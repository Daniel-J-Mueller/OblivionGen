## Context-Aware Haptic Feedback System

**System Overview:**

A system integrating the imperceptible audio identifier technology with localized haptic feedback to create an immersive and contextually relevant experience. This isn’t about *replacing* audio, but augmenting it with tactile information.

**Core Components:**

*   **Haptic Grid:** A wearable or localized grid of micro-actuators (e.g., ultrasonic transducers, piezoelectric elements, or shape-memory alloys) capable of generating localized tactile sensations on the user’s skin. Resolution should be at least 5cm spacing, but finer resolutions are preferred.
*   **Audio Processing Unit (APU):** Receives audio streams, detects imperceptible audio identifiers (as outlined in the source patent), and translates the identified item/context into haptic patterns.  This could be integrated into the source device or a separate hub.
*   **Context Database:** A database mapping items/contexts to specific haptic patterns.  This needs to be extensible and editable.
*   **User Profile/Calibration Module:**  Allows users to customize haptic feedback intensity, patterns, and sensitivity.
*   **Communication Interface:** Wireless protocol (Bluetooth 5.0 or higher) for communication between the APU and the haptic grid.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Content Playback:** Media content with embedded imperceptible audio identifiers is played.
2.  **Identifier Detection:** The APU detects the identifier.
3.  **Context Lookup:** The APU queries the Context Database to retrieve the appropriate haptic pattern for the identified item/context.
4.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:** The APU generates a signal to drive the haptic grid, activating specific actuators to create the corresponding tactile sensation.
5.  **Tactile Feedback:** The haptic grid delivers localized tactile feedback to the user.

**Haptic Pattern Examples:**

*   **Advertisement for a beverage:** A cool sensation on the forearm mimicking the feeling of a cold drink.
*   **Action movie scene:** Vibrations synchronized with explosions or impacts. Could vary intensity & location for directional audio effect.
*   **Nature documentary featuring a bird:** A gentle, fluttering sensation on the shoulder.
*   **Car advertisement:** Low-frequency rumble felt in the chest mimicking engine vibrations.
*   **E-commerce item (e.g., textured fabric):** Attempt to simulate texture on the hand or forearm through varying actuator frequencies & intensities.
*   **Alert/Notification:** Distinct, localized pulse to draw attention.

**Pseudocode (APU Processing):**

```
function processAudio(audioStream):
  identifier = detectImperceptibleIdentifier(audioStream)
  if identifier != null:
    hapticPattern = lookupHapticPattern(identifier)
    if hapticPattern != null:
      transmitHapticPattern(hapticPattern)
    else:
      // Default haptic pattern (e.g., subtle pulse)
      transmitDefaultHapticPattern()
```

**Technical Specifications:**

*   **Actuator Density:** Minimum 5cm spacing, with preference for finer resolutions (e.g. 2cm).
*   **Frequency Range:** Actuators capable of generating frequencies from 10Hz to 1kHz (to simulate different textures & sensations).
*   **Power Consumption:**  Target < 5W for wearable applications.
*   **Communication Latency:** < 20ms for real-time responsiveness.
*   **Calibration:** User-adjustable intensity and sensitivity levels. Automatic calibration routine to adapt to skin type & environmental factors.
*   **Data Storage:**  Minimum 1GB onboard storage for haptic patterns and user profiles.
*   **API:** Open API for developers to create custom haptic patterns and integrate with existing applications.
