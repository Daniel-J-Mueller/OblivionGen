## Dynamic Resonance Mapping for Enhanced Localization & Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the existing floor tile system by incorporating tunable resonant frequencies within the segment antennas, and a distributed network of low-power, localized "resonance beacons". This allows for dynamic creation of highly localized "resonance pockets" enabling sub-tile precision positioning *and* object/user interaction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Resonance Beacon Network:**

*   **Hardware:** Small (10cm x 10cm x 2cm), battery-powered units.  Each beacon contains a microcontroller, a tunable resonant circuit (varactor diode controlled), and a low-power radiating element (small loop antenna).
*   **Placement:** Deployed *above* the floor tile grid, affixed to existing infrastructure (ceilings, shelving supports, etc.). Density: 1 beacon per 2m x 2m area, minimum.
*   **Communication:** Mesh network via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).  Central controller (existing system server) manages beacon frequencies and network topology.
*   **Frequency Range:** 20kHz - 15MHz, mirroring tile transmission frequencies.

**2. Tunable Tile Antennas:**

*   **Hardware:** Segment antennas integrated with varactor diodes, allowing dynamic adjustment of resonant frequency.  Control via CAN bus from tile controller.
*   **Functionality:**  Antennas can be tuned to *match* beacon frequencies, creating areas of amplified signal strength, or *detuned*, creating areas of reduced signal strength.

**3. Localization Algorithm:**

*   **Phase 1: Baseline Mapping:** System identifies beacon locations & measures signal strength at each tile. Generates a "resonance map" of the facility.
*   **Phase 2: Dynamic Localization:**
    1.  Tile controller broadcasts a unique ID signal.
    2.  User/Objectâ€™s electromagnetic coupling with tile antennas creates a 'signature'.
    3.  System analyzes signal strength & phase differences from *both* tile antennas *and* the nearest beacons.
    4.  Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) algorithms to calculate sub-tile position (accuracy < 5cm).
*   **Phase 3: Resonance Pocket Creation:** 
    1. Based on detected user/object location, controller instructs nearby beacons and tile segments to adjust frequencies.
    2. Creates localized "resonance pockets" - areas of amplified or suppressed signal.

**4. Interactive Applications:**

*   **Proximity-Based Activation:** Resonance pockets can trigger actions (e.g., displaying information on nearby screens, unlocking doors, adjusting lighting).
*   **Haptic Feedback:**  Controlled resonance shifts can create subtle electromagnetic fields perceptible to the user, providing haptic feedback.
*   **Object Identification:** Unique resonance signatures can be assigned to objects, allowing for automatic identification and tracking.

**Pseudocode (Localization):**

```
// Tile Controller
function calculatePosition(signalId) {
  tileSignals = readTileAntennaSignals();
  beaconSignals = readBeaconSignals();

  // TDoA Calculation (Tile Antennas)
  tileTDoA = calculateTimeDifferenceOfArrival(tileSignals);

  // AoA Calculation (Tile Antennas)
  tileAoA = calculateAngleOfArrival(tileSignals);

  // TDoA Calculation (Beacons)
  beaconTDoA = calculateTimeDifferenceOfArrival(beaconSignals);

  // AoA Calculation (Beacons)
  beaconAoA = calculateAngleOfArrival(beaconSignals);

  // Fusion Algorithm (Kalman Filter or similar)
  position = fuseData(tileTDoA, tileAoA, beaconTDoA, beaconAoA);

  return position;
}
```

**System Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Resonance Map Optimization:** Machine learning algorithms can dynamically adjust beacon frequencies and resonance pocket configurations to optimize localization accuracy and interactive performance.
*   **Multi-User Tracking:**  Advanced signal processing techniques can differentiate between multiple users/objects within the same area.
*   **Integration with Existing Building Management Systems:**  Seamless integration with lighting, HVAC, and security systems.
