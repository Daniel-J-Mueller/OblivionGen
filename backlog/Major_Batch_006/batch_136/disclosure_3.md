## Portable Haptic Feedback System - "SenseSkin"

**Concept:** A portable input/output device utilizing flexible, networked haptic feedback modules integrated into a wearable “skin” – a thin, conformal layer adhering to the user's hand or arm. This goes beyond simple vibration; it aims to realistically simulate textures, shapes, and forces felt during virtual interactions or remote operation.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** 1cm x 1cm x 2mm (individual haptic module).  Modules are designed to be tessellated and connected.
*   **Module Density:** Variable, configurable via software. Target: 1 module per 1cm<sup>2</sup> for high-fidelity feedback, adjustable down to 1 module per 4cm<sup>2</sup> for lower-power applications.
*   **Actuation Technology:** Microfluidic chambers within each module. Chambers are filled with a magnetorheological fluid (MRF).  Rapidly changing magnetic fields, generated by embedded micro-coils, alter MRF viscosity, creating localized stiffness and variable force output.
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Each module integrates a capacitive proximity sensor, detecting distance to objects (virtual or real) within a 5cm range.  Data informs force/texture simulation.
*   **Connectivity:**  Bluetooth 6.0 Low Energy. Mesh networking capability between modules to distribute processing and improve responsiveness.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging via Qi standard. Battery life target: 8 hours continuous use.  Individual module power control for energy efficiency.
*   **Materials:**  Flexible PCB substrate.  Encapsulation: Stretchable silicone with high dielectric strength.  MRF: Iron particle suspension in a non-Newtonian fluid.
*   **Control System:** Software API (Python/C++) allowing developers to map virtual/remote events to specific haptic patterns.  Includes libraries for common textures (wood, metal, fabric) and force profiles.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    ```pseudocode
    // Module Initialization
    function initModule(moduleID, sensorPin, coilPin):
        set sensorPin to INPUT
        set coilPin to OUTPUT
        calibrateSensor()
        calibrateCoil()

    // Input Handling
    function readSensor():
        distance = read analog sensor
        return distance

    // Haptic Output
    function applyHaptic(forceLevel, duration):
        if forceLevel > 0:
            set coil current to proportional to forceLevel
        delay(duration)
        set coil current to 0

    // Texture Simulation (Simplified)
    function simulateTexture(textureType, area):
        if textureType == "wood":
            for each module in area:
                applyHaptic(random(0.1, 0.5), random(50ms, 200ms))
        elif textureType == "metal":
            for each module in area:
                applyHaptic(0.8, 25ms)
        // ... other textures
    ```
*   **Form Factor:**  Modular, interlocking tiles.  Users can configure the “SenseSkin” to fit their hand, arm, or other body parts.  Expansion kits available for larger areas.
*   **Applications:** Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality, remote robotics control, medical training, accessibility devices for the visually impaired, gaming.
