## Dynamic UI 'Constellations'

**Concept:** A user interface element that visually represents data relationships as a dynamic, three-dimensional constellation of nodes. Instead of traditional lists or charts, information is presented as glowing points ('stars') connected by lines ('constellation lines'). The user can manipulate the 'viewpoint' (rotate, zoom) of this constellation to explore the data from different angles.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** Accepts structured data (JSON, CSV, etc.). Each data point becomes a node. Data fields determine node properties (size, color, glow intensity).
*   **Node Representation:**
    *   Nodes are spherical, with radius proportional to a primary data value.
    *   Color represents a categorical data field (e.g., status - red = error, green = success, blue = pending).
    *   Glow intensity represents a secondary numerical value (e.g., priority, importance).
    *   Nodes should have subtle animation – a gentle pulsing or 'sparkle'.
*   **Constellation Lines:**
    *   Lines connect nodes based on relationships defined in the input data.
    *   Line thickness represents the strength of the relationship.
    *   Line color reflects the *type* of relationship.
    *   Lines should have a soft, blurred appearance – not crisp, defined lines.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   **Rotation/Zoom:** Standard mouse/touch controls. Inertia-based movement.
    *   **Node Selection:** Clicking a node highlights it and displays detailed information in a separate panel.
    *   **Relationship Filtering:** UI controls to filter relationships based on type or strength.  A slider to adjust minimum relationship strength.
    *   **Node Dragging:** Nodes can be gently dragged to reposition them within the constellation. Dragging automatically updates the constellation layout (see ‘Layout Algorithm’ below).
*   **Layout Algorithm:**
    *   **Force-Directed Graph:** Use a force-directed graph algorithm to initially position nodes. Repulsive forces between nodes, attractive forces between connected nodes.
    *   **Automatic Repositioning:** When a node is dragged, recalculate the layout *locally* – only adjust the positions of nearby nodes to minimize disruption.
    *   **Collision Detection:** Prevent nodes from overlapping.
*   **Rendering Engine:**
    *   WebGL for hardware-accelerated rendering.
    *   Shaders to create the glowing, blurred effects.
*   **Data Update Mechanism:**
    *   Real-time data updates. Nodes and lines should smoothly animate changes.
    *   Support for streaming data.
*   **UI Controls:**
    *   Pan, zoom, rotate controls
    *   Relationship filters (type, strength)
    *   Node information panel
    *   Data source selection

**Pseudocode (Data Update):**

```
function updateData(newData) {
  // Identify added, removed, and modified nodes/relationships

  for each addedNode in newData.nodes {
    createNode(addedNode);
    applyForceDirectedLayout(); //Local recalculation
  }

  for each removedNode in oldData.nodes - newData.nodes{
    removeNode(removedNode);
    applyForceDirectedLayout(); //Local recalculation
  }

  for each modifiedNode in newData.nodes {
    updateNodeProperties(modifiedNode);
  }

  for each addedRelationship in newData.relationships {
    createRelationship(addedRelationship);
  }

  for each removedRelationship in oldData.relationships - newData.relationships {
    removeRelationship(removedRelationship);
  }

  // Animate changes (smooth transitions)
}
```
