## Dynamic Metadata Sharding & Obfuscation

**Concept:** Extend the metadata encryption concept by *sharding* metadata across multiple encryption keys and distributed storage locations *before* encryption, adding a layer of complexity beyond simple encryption. This introduces a form of data fragmentation and distribution that, even if one key is compromised, doesn't reveal the complete metadata.

**Specifications:**

**1. Metadata Sharding Module:**

*   **Input:** Original metadata associated with the request.
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide the metadata into *n* equal (or near-equal) shards.
    *   Assign each shard to a unique key derived from a Key Management Service (KMS).  Key derivation can incorporate request-specific salt.
    *   Determine *n* storage locations (could be different KMS instances, geographically distributed storage, or a combination) to store each encrypted shard. Locations determined via a lookup service considering availability, latency, and policy.
*   **Output:** List of (Encrypted Shard, Storage Location) tuples.

**2. Request Reconstruction Module (at API Gateway):**

*   **Input:** List of (Encrypted Shard, Storage Location) tuples.
*   **Process:**
    *   Asynchronously retrieve all encrypted shards from their respective storage locations.
    *   Reassemble the shards into the original encrypted metadata.
    *   Construct the second request with the fully reassembled, encrypted metadata.
*   **Output:** Second request with encrypted metadata.

**3. Metadata Decryption & Reconstruction (at Computing Resource):**

*   **Input:** Second request containing encrypted, sharded metadata.
*   **Process:**
    *   Decrypt the encrypted metadata using the appropriate keys (obtained via KMS).
    *   Reconstruct the original metadata from the decrypted shards.
*   **Output:** Original metadata.

**4. Key Rotation & Shard Migration:**

*   **Process:** Periodically (or triggered by an event) rotate the encryption keys.  During key rotation, migrate the existing shards encrypted with the old key to the new key.  This can be done in a rolling fashion to minimize downtime.

**Pseudocode (API Gateway - Request Handling):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
    identity = extractIdentity(request)
    authenticateRequest(request, identity)

    metadata = extractMetadata(request)
    shardCount = determineShardCount(metadata.size)  // Dynamic, based on metadata size & security policy

    shards = shardMetadata(metadata, shardCount)
    storageLocations = lookupStorageLocations(shardCount)

    encryptedShards = []
    for i in range(shardCount):
        key = getKeyFromKMS(i)  // Unique key per shard
        encryptedShard = encrypt(shards[i], key)
        encryptedShards.append((encryptedShard, storageLocations[i]))

    secondRequest = reconstructRequest(request, encryptedShards)
    sendRequest(secondRequest)
    return response
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Shard Size:** Optimizing shard size for performance and security.
*   **Storage Location Selection:** Developing robust storage location selection criteria.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Ensuring the system can handle storage failures.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:** Adjusting the number of shards based on metadata sensitivity and security requirements.
*   **Auditing:** Logging all key accesses and shard migrations for security auditing.
