## Adaptive Precision Partitioning

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the precision (number of bits) used for feature maps *within* each subgraph based on interconnect time predictions and accelerator capacity. This moves beyond simply partitioning the network, and focuses on *how* data is represented during processing.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each accelerator node includes a configurable precision unit (CPU). This unit can scale precision from 8-bit to 32-bit floating point.
    *   Interconnects must support variable-width data transmission.
    *   A global scheduling unit (potentially centralized or distributed) capable of profiling execution.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Profiling Stage:** Run a representative dataset through the network to gather interconnect time estimates for various partition points *and* execution times on each accelerator.  Record data volume, precision used, and measured performance.
    *   **Precision Assignment Algorithm:**  This algorithm (executed *before* inference) determines the optimal precision for each layer *within* each subgraph. It considers:
        1.  **Interconnect Bottlenecks:**  Prioritize lower precision for feature maps transferred across high-latency interconnects.  The algorithm calculates a “transfer cost” based on data size and interconnect latency.
        2.  **Accelerator Capacity:**  Determine the maximum data throughput for each accelerator at various precision levels.
        3.  **Acceptable Accuracy Loss:**  Define a tolerance for accuracy degradation due to reduced precision.  This is a configurable parameter.
        4.  **Cost Function:** Minimize a weighted sum of transfer cost, execution time, and accuracy loss.
    *   **Runtime Precision Scaling:** A feedback loop monitors execution and adjusts precision *during* inference if unexpected bottlenecks occur or accuracy starts to degrade.
    *   **Data Format Conversion:**  Software libraries to efficiently convert feature map data between different precision formats.

**Pseudocode (Precision Assignment Algorithm):**

```
function assign_precision(network, accelerators, accuracy_tolerance):
    # 1. Profile Network:  Estimate interconnect times and accelerator performance at different precisions
    profile_results = profile_network(network, accelerators)

    # 2. Initialize Precision:  Start with highest precision (e.g., FP32) for all layers
    for layer in network.layers:
        layer.precision = FP32

    # 3. Iterate through each subgraph:
    for subgraph in network.subgraphs:
        for layer in subgraph.layers:
            # Calculate Transfer Cost:
            transfer_cost = profile_results.interconnect_time(layer.output) * layer.output.size 

            # Calculate Execution Time:
            execution_time = profile_results.execution_time(layer, layer.precision)

            # Evaluate Accuracy Loss: (estimated based on precision reduction)
            accuracy_loss = estimate_accuracy_loss(layer, layer.precision)

            # Iterate through possible precisions:
            for precision in [FP32, FP16, INT8]:
                # Recalculate metrics with new precision:
                new_transfer_cost = profile_results.interconnect_time(layer.output, precision) * layer.output.size
                new_execution_time = profile_results.execution_time(layer, precision)
                new_accuracy_loss = estimate_accuracy_loss(layer, precision)

                # Calculate Cost Function:
                cost = weight_transfer * new_transfer_cost + weight_execution * new_execution_time + weight_accuracy * new_accuracy_loss

                # If cost is lower and accuracy loss is within tolerance:
                if cost < current_cost and new_accuracy_loss < accuracy_tolerance:
                    layer.precision = precision
                    current_cost = cost

    return network
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced interconnect bandwidth requirements.
*   Increased throughput by leveraging higher precision arithmetic where appropriate.
*   Adaptability to varying network architectures and datasets.
*   Fine-grained control over the trade-off between accuracy and performance.
