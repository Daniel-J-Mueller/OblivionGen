## Adaptive Resonance Doorbell System

**Concept:** Expand the communication capabilities of the doorbell beyond simple signaling to enable nuanced contextual awareness and personalized responses using resonant frequency modulation of the AC power line.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:**  "Resonance Hub" - a small device installed in series with the existing doorbell wiring (between the transformer and the doorbell/chime unit). This hub contains a microcontroller, a resonant frequency generator/analyzer, and a low-power AC communication module.
*   **Resonant Frequency Profiles:** The Resonance Hub maintains a library of pre-programmed and dynamically learned resonant frequency profiles associated with different events or user preferences.  These profiles are superimposed onto the AC waveform.
*   **Event Detection:** The system detects events (button press, motion detection from an external sensor, package delivery sensor, etc.) and selects an associated resonant frequency profile.  The profile is modulated onto the AC power line.
*   **A/V Device Response:**  The A/V device (doorbell camera/speaker unit) incorporates an AC waveform analyzer and demodulator. It decodes the resonant frequency profile and triggers corresponding actions. Examples:
    *   **Priority Filtering:** High-frequency resonance indicates urgent events (fire alarm, security breach) and overrides all other functions.
    *   **Guest Recognition:** Unique resonant signatures can be assigned to registered visitors (via app integration). The system announces “Welcome, John” upon detecting his approach.
    *   **Delivery Notifications:** Package delivery triggers a unique resonant frequency sequence, playing a custom sound at the chime unit and sending a notification to the homeowner's phone.
    *   **Contextual Chimes:** Different chime tones are played based on the time of day, weather conditions, or user-defined rules.
*   **Learning Mode:** The system incorporates a machine learning algorithm that continuously refines the resonant frequency profiles based on user feedback and environmental conditions.  It adapts to variations in the AC power line quality and interference.
*   **Power Line Communication (PLC) Enhancement:** Leverage the resonant frequency modulation to improve the reliability and bandwidth of existing PLC technologies used for data transmission within the doorbell system.
*   **Security Features:** Implement encryption and authentication protocols to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation of the resonant frequency profiles.

**Pseudocode (Resonance Hub – Event Processing):**

```
// Event triggered (button press, motion detection, sensor input)
function processEvent(event) {
  //Determine event priority level
  priority = determinePriority(event)

  //Retrieve associated resonant frequency profile
  profile = getProfile(event, priority)

  //Modulate AC waveform with resonant frequency profile
  modulateACWaveform(profile)

  //Transmit modulated waveform to A/V device
}

function getProfile(event, priority) {
  if (event == "button_press") {
    if (priority == "high") {
      return profile_emergency_chime
    } else {
      return profile_standard_chime
    }
  } else if (event == "motion_detected") {
    return profile_motion_alert
  } //etc.
}
```

**A/V Device (Demodulation & Action):**

```
//Receive AC waveform
waveform = receiveACWaveform()

//Demodulate resonant frequency profile
profile = demodulateResonantFrequency(waveform)

//Determine action based on profile
action = determineAction(profile)

//Execute action (play chime, activate camera, send notification)
executeAction(action)
```
