**Dynamic Scene Importance via Multi-Modal Affective Computing & Generative Summarization**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Affective Scene Analyzer
*   **Input:** Video stream + Closed Captioning Data + Audio Stream (optional)
*   **Output:** Dynamically weighted scene importance score (0-100) + Generative Scene Summary (textual)

**Modules:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Input Processor:**
    *   Receives video, captions, and audio.
    *   Performs basic synchronization (caption/video alignment).
    *   Decomposes audio into distinct channels (dialogue, music, sound effects).

2.  **Affective Computing Engine:**
    *   **Facial Expression Analysis (Video):** Detects and classifies facial expressions of performers within each scene.  Outputs ‘valence’ (positive/negative) and ‘arousal’ (intensity) scores.
    *   **Speech Emotion Recognition (Audio/Captions):**  Analyzes vocal tone/inflection (audio) *and* sentiment/emotion expressed within the dialog (captions). Outputs ‘valence’ and ‘arousal’ scores.  Prioritizes audio analysis when available; falls back to caption analysis when not.
    *   **Music Mood Analysis (Audio):**  Analyzes musical characteristics (tempo, key, instrumentation) to infer mood/emotion. Outputs ‘valence’ and ‘arousal’ scores.
    *   **Scene Context Analyzer:** Extracts keywords and entities from closed captioning using Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Key Phrase Extraction. Compares identified entities/keywords to a knowledge graph/database of common tropes, themes, and archetypes.  Outputs a ‘contextual relevance’ score.

3.  **Importance Score Aggregator:**
    *   Combines outputs from Affective Computing Engine and Scene Context Analyzer.
    *   Weighted average calculation:
        *   Facial Expression Valence: 20%
        *   Speech/Caption Valence: 30%
        *   Music Valence: 15%
        *   Scene Context Relevance: 25%
        *   Arousal (combined from all sources): 10%
    *   Normalizes the combined score to a 0-100 scale.
    *   Dynamic Weighting:  The weights are dynamically adjusted based on scene characteristics. For example, a high-action scene might prioritize arousal, while a dramatic scene might prioritize valence.

4.  **Generative Scene Summarizer:**
    *   Leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to create a concise summary of each scene (2-3 sentences).
    *   LLM is *prompted* using:
        *   The scene's closed captioning data.
        *   The scene's calculated importance score.
        *   The weighted affect scores (valence, arousal) for that scene.
    *   The LLM is instructed to *highlight* emotional impact and contextual relevance within the summary.  For example:  “This scene, marked by intense emotional turmoil (valence: -0.8, arousal: 0.9), reveals a critical plot twist regarding [character name].”

**Pseudocode (Importance Score Aggregation):**

```
function calculate_scene_importance(scene_data):
  facial_valence = scene_data.facial_valence
  speech_valence = scene_data.speech_valence
  music_valence = scene_data.music_valence
  context_relevance = scene_data.context_relevance
  arousal = (scene_data.facial_arousal + scene_data.speech_arousal + scene_data.music_arousal) / 3

  # Dynamic Weight Adjustment (example)
  if scene_data.action_level > 0.7:  # High Action Scene
      weight_facial = 0.1
      weight_speech = 0.2
      weight_music = 0.15
      weight_context = 0.25
      weight_arousal = 0.3
  else:
      weight_facial = 0.2
      weight_speech = 0.3
      weight_music = 0.15
      weight_context = 0.25
      weight_arousal = 0.1

  importance_score = (weight_facial * facial_valence +
                      weight_speech * speech_valence +
                      weight_music * music_valence +
                      weight_context * context_relevance +
                      weight_arousal * arousal)

  # Normalize to 0-100 scale
  normalized_score = (importance_score + 1) * 50 # Adjust scaling as needed

  return normalized_score
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Dynamic Highlight Reels: Automatically create compelling highlight reels based on scene importance.
*   Adaptive Storytelling: AI-driven video games that adjust the narrative based on player emotional response.
*   Content Recommendation: Recommend videos based on emotional impact and contextual relevance.
*   Improved Video Editing: Assist video editors in identifying key moments within a project.
