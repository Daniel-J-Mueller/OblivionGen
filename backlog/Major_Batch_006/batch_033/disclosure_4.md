## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Multi-Modal Sensor Fusion & Generative AI

**Core Concept:** Extend sound source localization beyond direction to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene – the environment itself – perceived by the device. This allows for advanced features like virtual environment overlays, augmented reality soundscapes, and proactive noise cancellation tailored to the reconstructed space.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   Microphone Array (existing in patent) – 8+ microphones, high SNR.
    *   Low-Resolution Depth Camera (e.g., Time-of-Flight) -  Provides sparse point cloud data of the environment. Resolution: 320x240, Range: 0.5m - 8m.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - 6-axis (accelerometer & gyroscope) for device orientation tracking.
    *   Optional: RGB Camera – For visual context & material identification.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Edge TPU or equivalent for real-time processing.
*   **Memory:** 16GB RAM, 256GB Storage.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **AWD Engine:** (based on patent) – Refined for real-time operation. Optimized for edge devices.
    *   **Sensor Fusion Module:** Kalman Filter-based, integrating data from microphones, depth camera, and IMU. Handles noise and uncertainty in sensor data. Output:  Probabilistic 3D point cloud representing the environment’s surfaces.
    *   **Generative Acoustic Model (GAM):**  A neural network (e.g., a variant of a Generative Adversarial Network or Diffusion Model) trained on a vast dataset of acoustic scenes.  Input: Probabilistic 3D point cloud + AWD output (direction of speech). Output:  A complete acoustic scene representation (sound field).
    *   **Acoustic Ray Tracing Engine:**  Simulates how sound propagates in the reconstructed 3D environment.  Used for virtual sound source placement & augmentation.
    *   **User Interface:** (optional) – For visualization of the reconstructed scene and control of augmented audio features.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**  Microphone array captures audio, depth camera captures sparse point cloud, IMU tracks device orientation.
2.  **Sensor Fusion:**  Kalman Filter combines data to generate a probabilistic 3D point cloud representing the environment.  Handles sensor noise and uncertainty.
3.  **Sound Source Localization:** AWD engine determines the direction of detected speech (or other sound sources).
4.  **GAM Scene Completion:** GAM uses the 3D point cloud *and* the sound source direction to complete the acoustic scene.  It generates a full sound field representation.  The GAM effectively 'fills in the gaps' in the acoustic data based on the reconstructed environment.
5.  **Acoustic Ray Tracing (Optional):**  Simulates sound propagation in the reconstructed scene, enabling advanced features like virtual sound source placement or targeted noise cancellation.
6.  **Output:** Reconstructed acoustic scene representation, virtual audio overlays, or augmented reality soundscapes.

**Pseudocode (Scene Completion):**

```
function complete_acoustic_scene(point_cloud, sound_direction):
  # point_cloud: Probabilistic 3D point cloud of the environment
  # sound_direction: Direction of detected sound source (from AWD)

  # Input data preprocessing (normalization, scaling)
  processed_point_cloud = preprocess(point_cloud)

  # Encode point cloud into a latent vector
  latent_vector = encoder(processed_point_cloud)

  # Condition the latent vector on sound direction
  conditioned_latent_vector = concatenate(latent_vector, sound_direction)

  # Decode the conditioned latent vector into a full acoustic scene representation
  acoustic_scene = decoder(conditioned_latent_vector)

  return acoustic_scene
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **AR/VR Soundscapes:**  Create immersive and realistic soundscapes that adapt to the user’s physical environment.
*   **Proactive Noise Cancellation:**  Targeted noise cancellation based on the reconstructed environment (e.g., cancel noise from a specific source).
*   **Smart Home Audio:**  Optimize audio playback based on room acoustics.
*   **Accessibility:** Assistive listening devices that enhance sound clarity in complex environments.
*   **Security/Surveillance:** Enhanced audio analysis for detecting and localizing threats.
