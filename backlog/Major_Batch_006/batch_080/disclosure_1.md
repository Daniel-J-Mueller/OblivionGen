## Dynamic Query Decomposition with Probabilistic Relevance Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the query pruning system to incorporate real-time user feedback during the query decomposition process, influencing the removal of parameters not just by frequency/changeability within the data store, but also by *perceived* relevance as indicated by the user. This creates a dynamically adapting query builder.

**Specs:**

1.  **Relevance Interface:** Implement a lightweight UI element presented *during* query execution. This UI presents a small set of parameters (perhaps the next 3-5 to be considered for removal) and asks the user a simple binary question: "Are these parameters important for finding what you need?".  Options: "Yes" or "No".  The UI must be non-intrusive and integrate seamlessly with the existing search interface.

2.  **Probabilistic Modeling:** Utilize a Bayesian network to model the relationship between parameter importance (user feedback), data store frequency/changeability (from existing system), and query success (whether the query returns the desired data objects). The network should be trained on historical data (user feedback, query results, data store statistics).

3.  **Dynamic Pruning Thresholds:**  Instead of fixed thresholds for importance/changeability, dynamically adjust the pruning thresholds based on the probabilistic model. If the model predicts a high probability of query success even with a parameter removed, the threshold for that parameter is lowered.  Conversely, if the model predicts a low probability of success, the threshold is raised.

4.  **Query Decomposition Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    function decomposeQuery(initialQuery, dataStore, userFeedbackModel):
      query = initialQuery
      parameters = getParameters(query)
      while parameters are remaining:
        candidateParameters = selectNextParametersForEvaluation(parameters) // Select 3-5
        userResponse = getUserFeedback(candidateParameters) // "Yes" or "No"
        
        for each param in candidateParameters:
          predictedSuccess = userFeedbackModel.predictSuccess(query, param, userResponse, dataStore)
          
          if predictedSuccess < threshold: // Threshold adjusted dynamically
            query = removeParameter(query, param)
          else:
            // Keep the parameter.
        
        if query returns no results:
            reinsert last removed parameter

      return query
    ```

5.  **Data Store Integration:**  The system requires access to data store statistics (frequency of parameter values, rate of change).  This data can be pre-computed and stored in a cache to minimize performance overhead.

6.  **A/B Testing:**  Implement A/B testing to compare the performance of the dynamic query decomposition system against the existing static pruning system.  Metrics to track include query accuracy, query latency, and user satisfaction.

7.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously update the Bayesian network with new user feedback and query results to improve the accuracy of the probabilistic model over time.
