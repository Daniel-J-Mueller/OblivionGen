## Predictive Bundle Prefetching with User Intent Modeling

**Specification:** A system extending proactive bundle delivery by incorporating user intent prediction to deliver even more relevant content *before* a user requests it, minimizing perceived latency and enhancing user experience.

**Core Concept:**  Rather than simply bundling content referenced by the *current* page or domain, this system predicts likely navigation *from* the current page and proactively bundles content for those predicted destinations.

**Components:**

*   **Intent Prediction Engine:**  A machine learning model trained on user behavior (navigation history, dwell time, click patterns, search queries) to predict the probability of a user navigating to specific pages or content items. This could utilize collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach.
*   **Probabilistic Bundle Generator:**  This component dynamically constructs bundles based on the output of the Intent Prediction Engine. It assigns a 'relevance score' to each potential content item and includes items exceeding a threshold in the bundle.  Bundles can be tiered based on predicted probability - higher probability = more extensive bundle.
*   **Adaptive Bundle Size Control:**  A mechanism to regulate bundle size based on network conditions (bandwidth, latency) and client device capabilities (CPU, memory).  This prevents overwhelming the client or congesting the network.
*   **Client-Side Bundle Manager:**  An enhanced browser module responsible for receiving, caching, and prioritizing content from proactive bundles. It integrates with the browserâ€™s rendering engine to seamlessly utilize cached content.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  The system monitors user interactions with proactively delivered content. If a user *does not* access content from a bundle, the Intent Prediction Engine is retrained to reduce the probability of similar bundles being delivered in the future.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateProactiveBundle(userID, currentURL)

  // Get user intent predictions
  predictedNavigations = IntentPredictionEngine.Predict(userID, currentURL)

  bundleContent = []
  bundleScore = 0

  FOR each navigation in predictedNavigations:
    targetURL = navigation.targetURL
    probability = navigation.probability

    //Retrieve content items associated with targetURL
    contentItems = ContentRepository.GetContentForURL(targetURL)

    FOR each item in contentItems:
        // Add content to bundle with weighted score
        bundleContent.append(item)
        bundleScore += item.size * probability

    IF bundleScore > MAX_BUNDLE_SIZE:
        // Prioritize based on size and probability
        bundleContent.sort(key=lambda x: (x.size / probability))
        bundleContent = bundleContent[:MAX_CONTENT_ITEMS]
        break

  // Return the bundle
  RETURN bundleContent

END FUNCTION
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `UserIntent`: {`userID`, `currentURL`, `targetURL`, `probability`}
*   `ContentItem`: {`itemID`, `size`, `url`, `type`}
*   `Bundle`: {`bundleID`, `userID`, `creationTime`, `contentItems`}

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   The Intent Prediction Engine could be implemented as a microservice deployed separately from the core bundle generation service.
*   Bundle delivery could leverage existing CDN infrastructure for scalability and performance.
*   Client-side bundle management should be designed to minimize battery consumption and resource usage.
*   Privacy considerations should be addressed by anonymizing user data and providing users with control over their tracking preferences.
