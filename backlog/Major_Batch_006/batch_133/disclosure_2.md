## Dynamic Chunk Prediction & Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the mirroring process with predictive analysis of future write requests. Instead of *reacting* to requests and delaying slave updates, proactively pre-mirror chunks likely to be written to based on access patterns and workload characteristics.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Engine:**

*   **Data Source:** Collect historical write request logs (chunk ID, timestamp, originating client).  Also collect system metadata (CPU load, memory usage, network latency).
*   **Model:** Implement a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM neural network, Prophet) trained on write request data. The model predicts the probability of a write to each chunk within a configurable time window.
*   **Output:**  A ranked list of chunks, ordered by predicted write probability.

**2. Mirroring Process Modification:**

*   **Prefetch Queue:** Maintain a queue of chunks to be pre-mirrored. Populate this queue with the top N chunks from the Predictive Engine's ranked list.
*   **Background Prefetching:**  A dedicated background thread continuously pulls chunks from the Prefetch Queue and initiates mirroring (data or metadata replication) to the slave node.  Prioritize prefetching of "dirty" chunks (those with pending writes).
*   **Adaptive Queue Management:** Dynamically adjust the size of the Prefetch Queue based on observed hit rate (percentage of prefetched chunks subsequently written to). Increase the queue size if hit rate is high, decrease if hit rate is low. Also, adapt based on workload intensity (increase queue size during peak load).
*   **Write Request Interception:**  Intercept incoming write requests *before* they reach the master nodeâ€™s write handler.
*   **Prefetch Check:**  Determine if the requested chunk is already in the process of being prefetched (i.e., mirroring is in progress). If so, defer the write operation briefly until mirroring completes, then apply the write to both master and slave.

**3.  Data Structures:**

*   `ChunkPrediction`:
    *   `chunkId`: Integer
    *   `predictedProbability`: Float
    *   `lastAccessedTimestamp`: Timestamp
*   `PrefetchQueue`: Priority Queue of `ChunkPrediction` (sorted by predictedProbability, descending)

**4.  Pseudocode (Write Request Handling):**

```
function handleWriteRequest(request):
  chunkId = request.chunkId
  
  if isChunkBeingPrefetched(chunkId):
    // Wait for prefetch to complete
    waitUntilChunkPrefetched(chunkId)
    applyWriteToMasterAndSlave(request)
  else:
    applyWriteToMaster(request)
    enqueueForPrefetch(chunkId) //Add to prefetch queue for future requests
```

**5.  Configuration Parameters:**

*   `prefetchQueueSize`: Integer (Maximum number of chunks in the Prefetch Queue)
*   `predictionTimeWindow`: Integer (Time window for predicting write requests, e.g., 5 seconds)
*   `predictionModelType`: String (e.g., "LSTM", "Prophet")
*   `adaptiveQueueControlEnabled`: Boolean (Enable/Disable adaptive queue size adjustment)

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced write latency for frequently accessed chunks.
*   Improved slave node consistency.
*   Increased system throughput.
*   More efficient use of network bandwidth.
