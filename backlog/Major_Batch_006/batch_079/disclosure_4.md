## Adaptive Network Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the configurable network concept to allow users to define and switch between "network personas" â€“ pre-configured network environments optimized for different tasks or security levels. These personas aren't just network configurations; they encompass application access policies, data access restrictions, and even virtual desktop environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definition Module:**
    *   Allows users to create personas via a GUI or API.
    *   Persona attributes include:
        *   Network topology (as per existing patent).
        *   Application access control lists (ACLs).
        *   Data access permissions (file/database level).
        *   Virtual Desktop Image (VDI) selection.
        *   Encryption profiles.
        *   Bandwidth allocation limits.
        *   Geofencing rules.
*   **Persona Switching Mechanism:**
    *   A client-side agent monitors user activity (application usage, location, time of day).
    *   Based on pre-defined rules or user selection, the agent initiates a network persona switch.
    *   Switch involves:
        *   Reconfiguring network topology.
        *   Applying new application and data access policies.
        *   Launching/Attaching to a designated VDI.
        *   Establishing new VPN connections or adjusting existing ones.
*   **Dynamic Policy Enforcement:**
    *   Centralized policy engine enforces persona-specific rules.
    *   Real-time monitoring of user activity ensures compliance.
    *   Automated alerts and remediation actions for policy violations.
*   **Resource Allocation Management:**
    *   Dynamically allocates network resources (bandwidth, compute) based on active personas.
    *   Prioritization of resources for critical personas.
    *   Scalability to support a large number of concurrent personas.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   Open API allows third-party applications to integrate with the persona system.
    *   Automation of persona creation, switching, and management.

**Pseudocode (Persona Switching):**

```
function SwitchPersona(personaName):
    // Retrieve persona configuration
    personaConfig = GetPersonaConfig(personaName)

    // Reconfigure Network Topology
    ReconfigureNetwork(personaConfig.networkTopology)

    // Apply Access Control Lists
    ApplyACLs(personaConfig.applicationACLs)

    // Apply Data Access Permissions
    ApplyDataPermissions(personaConfig.dataPermissions)

    // Launch/Attach VDI
    LaunchVDI(personaConfig.vdiImage)

    // Update VPN Connections
    ConfigureVPN(personaConfig.vpnSettings)

    // Log Persona Switch Event
    LogEvent("Persona Switched to: " + personaName)
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Security:** A "Secure Banking" persona configures a hardened network, isolates banking applications, and requires multi-factor authentication.
*   **Remote Work:** A "Remote Office" persona establishes a VPN connection, grants access to corporate resources, and optimizes bandwidth for video conferencing.
*   **Content Creation:** A "Creative Studio" persona allocates high bandwidth, prioritizes graphics applications, and isolates media files.
*   **Development/Testing:** A "Dev Environment" persona isolates development tools, grants access to test servers, and prevents interference with production systems.
