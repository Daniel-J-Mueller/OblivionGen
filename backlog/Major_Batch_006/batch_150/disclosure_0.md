## Adaptive Sensor Fusion with Predictive Occlusion Handling

**Concept:** Extend the multi-domain object detection framework to incorporate predictive occlusion handling via a learned 'future state' representation, and dynamically adjust sensor fusion weights based on predicted occlusion confidence.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** RGB Camera, NIR Camera, Depth Sensor (Lidar/Time-of-Flight).  Expandable to include Radar or Thermal imaging.
*   **Core Detection Network:** SSD (Single Shot Detector) architecture as base, but modified to accept feature maps from *all* sensors simultaneously.
*   **Occlusion Prediction Module:**
    *   **Input:**  Historical sensor data (RGB, NIR, Depth) over a short time window (e.g., 2-5 frames).  Object tracks (bounding box locations & IDs) from the SSD.
    *   **Architecture:** LSTM-based recurrent neural network.  Learns temporal relationships between sensor data and object movements.
    *   **Output:**  'Occlusion Confidence Map' – A per-pixel map indicating the probability of occlusion in the *next* frame.  Also outputs a 'Future State' feature map – a predicted feature representation of the scene in the next frame, accounting for likely occlusions. This is analogous to image inpainting.
*   **Dynamic Sensor Fusion:**
    *   **Weighting Network:** A small neural network that takes as input:
        *   Feature maps from each sensor (RGB, NIR, Depth).
        *   Occlusion Confidence Map.
        *   Object tracks (bounding box locations & IDs).
    *   **Output:** Per-sensor weight map. These weights are applied to the sensor feature maps *before* they are fed into the SSD.
    *   **Logic:** Sensors in areas with *high* occlusion confidence have their weights *reduced*. Sensors in areas with *low* occlusion confidence have their weights *increased*. The network learns these weighting adjustments through training.
*   **Training Procedure:**
    *   **Dataset:**  Large-scale dataset of multi-sensor video sequences with ground truth object annotations *and* occlusion labels.
    *   **Loss Function:**  Combination of:
        *   Standard SSD loss (localization & classification).
        *   Occlusion prediction loss (cross-entropy between predicted and ground truth occlusion maps).
        *   Regularization term to encourage sparse sensor weights.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Sensor Fusion):**

```python
def dynamic_sensor_fusion(rgb_features, nir_features, depth_features, occlusion_confidence):
    # Calculate per-sensor weights based on occlusion confidence
    rgb_weight = 1.0 - occlusion_confidence  # Example: Lower weight with higher occlusion
    nir_weight = 1.0 - occlusion_confidence
    depth_weight = 1.0 #Depth is less affected by occlusion

    # Apply weights to feature maps
    weighted_rgb = rgb_features * rgb_weight
    weighted_nir = nir_features * nir_weight
    weighted_depth = depth_features

    # Concatenate weighted feature maps
    fused_features = concatenate([weighted_rgb, weighted_nir, weighted_depth])

    return fused_features
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond static sensor fusion by *predicting* occlusions and dynamically adjusting sensor weights accordingly. This allows the system to prioritize information from sensors that are *not* occluded, improving detection accuracy in challenging environments.  The learned 'future state' representation adds a temporal dimension to the detection process, making it more robust to partial or temporary occlusions. This is more than sensor weighting; this is predictive confidence modeling.
