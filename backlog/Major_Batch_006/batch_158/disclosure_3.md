## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Sparse Frequency Domain Mapping

**Concept:** This system reconstructs a 3D acoustic scene map from sparse frequency data, leveraging the principle that distinct sound sources exhibit unique spectral characteristics at different frequencies. It goes beyond simple source localization to create a volumetric representation of reflecting surfaces within an environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of MEMS microphones (minimum 8, optimally 64+).  Placement is non-critical, but distribution across a volume is preferred.
    *   High-performance DSP or FPGA for real-time signal processing.
    *   Solid-state storage (SSD) for map data.
    *   Optional: Low-resolution depth sensor (e.g., Time-of-Flight) for initial scene calibration & constraint.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Frequency Domain Decomposition:**
        *   Input: Raw audio stream from microphone array.
        *   Process: Perform Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on each microphone signal.
        *   Output: Complex spectral data for each microphone, time-indexed.
    *   **Sparse Feature Extraction:**
        *   Input: Spectral data from all microphones.
        *   Process: Identify dominant frequencies (peaks) in each time slice.  Utilize a sparsity constraint – only retain the top N% of energy-containing frequencies to reduce computational load.  These sparse frequencies will represent “acoustic beacons”.
        *   Output: List of sparse frequencies and associated energy levels per time slice.
    *   **Beamforming & Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) Estimation:**
        *   Input: Sparse frequency data, microphone array geometry.
        *   Process: For each acoustic beacon, perform beamforming to estimate the direction of arrival (DOA).  Calculate TDOA between microphone pairs for increased accuracy.
        *   Output: DOA and TDOA data for each acoustic beacon.
    *   **3D Map Construction:**
        *   Input: DOA/TDOA data, optional depth sensor data.
        *   Process: 
            *   Ray tracing:  Project rays from each microphone based on DOA.  Intersections of these rays represent potential source locations.
            *   Constraint application:  Incorporate depth sensor data (if available) to constrain the search space for intersections.
            *   Reflectivity Modeling:  Based on the frequency of the acoustic beacon, assign a probability of reflection for surfaces within the intersection area. Higher frequencies are more likely to reflect off smaller, smoother surfaces. Lower frequencies propagate further and reflect off larger areas.
            *   Volumetric Grid:  Populate a 3D volumetric grid with reflectivity values based on ray intersections and modeled probabilities.  Higher reflectivity values indicate stronger acoustic sources or reflecting surfaces.
        *   Output: 3D volumetric map representing the acoustic scene.
    *   **Dynamic Map Update:**  Continuously update the 3D map using a sliding window of recent audio data. Implement a decay factor to reduce the influence of older data.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `MicrophoneData`:  Array of complex spectral values, time-indexed.
    *   `AcousticBeacon`: Frequency, energy, DOA, TDOA.
    *   `VolumetricGrid`: 3D array of reflectivity values.

**Pseudocode (Map Update):**

```
function updateMap(newMicrophoneData):
  // Process new data to extract acoustic beacons
  beacons = extractAcousticBeacons(newMicrophoneData)

  // For each beacon
  for each beacon in beacons:
    // Project rays from each microphone based on DOA
    rays = projectRays(beacon.DOA)

    // Find intersections of rays within the environment
    intersections = findIntersections(rays)

    // Update reflectivity values in the volumetric grid
    for each intersection in intersections:
      grid[intersection.x, intersection.y, intersection.z] += beacon.energy * reflectionProbability(beacon.frequency, intersection.surfaceNormal)

  // Apply decay factor to reduce influence of older data
  for each cell in grid:
    grid[cell] *= decayFactor  // e.g., 0.99
```

**Novelty:** The system does not simply locate sound sources, but actively reconstructs the *geometry* of the environment based on frequency-dependent reflections. This allows for more detailed environmental understanding, noise cancellation, and spatial audio rendering. It’s a proactive acoustic mapping technique, rather than a reactive source localization system.
