## Dynamic Network Persona System

**Concept:** Extend the credential verification beyond simple authorization to establish dynamic ‘network personas’ for devices, influencing not just access, but also network behavior and resource allocation.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Definitions:** A central server maintains a database of network personas. Each persona is defined by a set of parameters:
    *   `Priority`: Integer value dictating resource allocation preference. Higher values get preferential treatment.
    *   `BandwidthLimit`: Maximum bandwidth allocated to the device when this persona is active (Kbps).
    *   `SubnetAssignment`:  Specific subnet assigned to the device.
    *   `ApplicationWhitelist`: List of allowed applications.
    *   `QoSProfile`: Quality of Service profile (e.g., low latency, high throughput).
    *   `SecurityProfile`: Defines firewall rules and intrusion detection settings.
*   **Device Capabilities:** Networked devices must support a “Persona Manager” module. This module interacts with the configuration server to:
    *   Request a persona based on device identification *and* contextual information (time of day, location, user activity).
    *   Securely receive and activate the persona configuration.
    *   Monitor and report performance metrics related to the active persona.
*   **Persona Negotiation Protocol:**  A secure, bi-directional protocol between the device and the server.
    1.  Device sends `PersonaRequest` containing:
        *   `DeviceID`
        *   `ContextualData` (timestamp, geolocation, active applications)
        *   `DesiredPersona` (optional - device can suggest a persona)
    2.  Server responds with `PersonaAssignment`:
        *   `PersonaID`
        *   `PersonaDefinition` (all parameters listed above)
        *   `Duration` (how long this persona is active)
    3.  Device applies the configuration and initiates monitoring.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The server can proactively adjust the active persona based on network conditions or security events. This is achieved by sending a `PersonaUpdate` message to the device.
*   **Failover Mechanism:** If persona negotiation fails or the server is unavailable, the device reverts to a pre-defined “Base Persona” with limited capabilities.

**Pseudocode (Device-Side Persona Manager):**

```
function initialize() {
  loadBasePersona();
  startPersonaNegotiation();
}

function startPersonaNegotiation() {
  context = getContextualData();
  request = createPersonaRequest(deviceID, context);
  sendRequest(request);
}

function onReceivePersonaAssignment(assignment) {
  personaID = assignment.personaID;
  personaDefinition = assignment.personaDefinition;
  duration = assignment.duration;

  applyPersona(personaDefinition);
  startTimer(duration, onPersonaTimeout);
}

function applyPersona(definition) {
  bandwidthLimit = definition.bandwidthLimit;
  subnetAssignment = definition.subnetAssignment;
  applicationWhitelist = definition.applicationWhitelist;
  qosProfile = definition.qosProfile;
  securityProfile = definition.securityProfile;

  // Implement network configuration changes based on definition
}

function onPersonaTimeout() {
  revertToBasePersona();
  startPersonaNegotiation();
}

function revertToBasePersona() {
  // Implement base persona network configuration
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced security through dynamic access control.
*   Optimized network performance based on device needs.
*   Granular control over device behavior.
*   Ability to create custom network experiences for different users or applications.
