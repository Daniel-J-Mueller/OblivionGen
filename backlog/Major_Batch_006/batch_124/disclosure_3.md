## Adaptive Item Relationship Weighting via User Emotional State

**Core Concept:** Extend the item relationship detection to incorporate real-time user emotional state as a weighting factor. The core patent focuses on co-viewed items. This builds on that by assuming emotional response *to* items influences future relationship weighting.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Acquisition:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate with user-facing sensors – webcam (facial expression analysis), microphone (voice tone analysis), potentially biometric sensors (heart rate variability via smartwatch integration - optional).
*   **Emotional State Inference:** Employ a machine learning model (trained on large datasets of facial expressions, vocal tones, and biometric data) to infer user emotional state (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, neutral) during item viewing. Output a vector representing emotional intensity across key dimensions.
*   **Item Interaction Logging:** Continue logging item views, purchases, cart additions, etc., as in the base patent. *Crucially*, timestamp emotional state vectors alongside each item interaction.

**2. Relationship Weighting Adjustment:**

*   **Base Relationship Score:**  Calculate the initial item relationship score as described in the patent – frequency of co-view within a session.
*   **Emotional Amplification/Suppression:**  Apply an amplification/suppression factor to the base relationship score based on the user's emotional response *during* the co-view.
    *   *Positive Emotion (Happiness):* Increase the relationship score. The stronger the happiness signal, the higher the amplification.
    *   *Negative Emotion (Sadness, Anger):* Decrease the relationship score. The stronger the negative signal, the higher the suppression.
    *   *Neutral Emotion:*  Minimal impact on the score.
*   **Dynamic Weighting Function:**  Use a configurable function to map emotional intensity vectors to amplification/suppression factors. (e.g., a weighted sum of emotional dimensions).  This function should be tunable via A/B testing.

**3. Personalized Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Augmented Mapping:**  The item-to-item mapping is now based on the *emotionally-weighted* relationship scores, not just co-view frequency.
*   **Real-Time Adaptation:** During a browsing session:
    *   Continuously monitor user emotional state.
    *   Adjust item weights in the recommendation engine *in real-time* based on observed emotional responses to currently viewed items.  If a user consistently shows positive emotion toward items in a specific category, increase the weight of those items in the recommendation list.
*   **Diversity Balancing:** Implement a mechanism to prevent the recommendation engine from becoming overly biased toward items that consistently evoke strong positive emotions.  Introduce a diversity penalty to encourage exploration of other potentially relevant items.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Generation):**

```
function generateRecommendations(userID, currentItems, sessionData):
  itemMapping = getEmotionallyWeightedItemMapping() // Returns mapping based on historical + real-time data
  candidateItems = getCandidateItems(itemMapping, currentItems)
  rankedItems = rankItems(candidateItems, itemMapping, currentItems)
  //Diversity Balancing Logic
  finalRecommendations = applyDiversityPenalty(rankedItems)
  return finalRecommendations
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Webcams, Microphones (standard user equipment)
*   Optional: Biometric sensor integration (smartwatch API access)
*   Machine Learning Model (trained on emotional state inference)
*   Real-time data processing pipeline
*   Scalable data storage (session data, emotional state vectors)
*   Recommendation engine API

**Potential Applications:**

*   More relevant product recommendations
*   Enhanced user engagement
*   Improved ad targeting
*   Personalized content curation
*   Early detection of user frustration or dissatisfaction (proactive support)
