## Adaptive Key Derivation via Biometric Entropy

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical encryption system by dynamically deriving encryption keys from biometric data, incorporating real-time entropy to bolster security and enable fine-grained access control beyond static key assignments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Input Module:**

*   **Input Types:** Support multiple biometric modalities – fingerprint, iris scan, voiceprint, facial recognition, keystroke dynamics, and potentially physiological signals (heart rate variability, skin conductance).
*   **Sensor Integration:**  Interface with standard biometric sensors via established APIs (e.g., WebAuthn, Windows Biometrics Framework, Android BiometricPrompt).
*   **Quality Assessment:**  Implement a quality assessment algorithm for each biometric modality to reject poor-quality samples, minimizing false positives and ensuring reliable entropy extraction.  Minimum acceptable quality thresholds are configurable.
*   **Multi-factor Authentication:**  Allow configuration of multi-factor biometric authentication – requiring a combination of biometric modalities for key derivation.

**2. Entropy Extraction & Key Derivation:**

*   **Entropy Source:** Utilize the raw biometric data *directly* as an entropy source. Avoid pre-processing that could reduce entropy.
*   **Hashing & Salting:**  Apply a cryptographically secure hashing function (e.g., SHA-512) to the raw biometric data. Incorporate a unique, randomly generated salt for each key derivation instance to prevent rainbow table attacks.
*   **Key Stretching:** Employ a key derivation function (KDF) – Argon2, scrypt, or PBKDF2 – to stretch the hashed biometric data into a key of the desired length. Configure the KDF parameters (iteration count, memory cost, parallelism) to balance security and performance.
*   **Hierarchical Key Mapping:**  Establish a mapping between derived keys and specific portions of the encrypted hierarchy. The mapping should be dynamic and configurable.  For instance, a fingerprint scan might unlock access to a specific row in a database table.
*   **Key Rotation:** Implement a periodic key rotation scheme. The rotation interval is configurable. The new key is derived from a fresh biometric sample.
*   **Fallback Mechanism:** In case of biometric sensor failure, provide a secure fallback mechanism – a pre-shared secret or a hardware security module (HSM).

**3. System Integration:**

*   **API Endpoints:** Expose a set of API endpoints for biometric enrollment, authentication, and key management.
*   **Encryption Service Integration:** Integrate with the existing hierarchical encryption service. The encryption service should be able to accept keys derived from biometric data.
*   **Access Control Policy:** Implement an access control policy that governs which biometric modalities can be used to unlock access to specific portions of the encrypted hierarchy.
*   **Auditing & Logging:** Log all biometric authentication attempts, including timestamps, biometric modality used, and authentication status.

**Pseudocode (Authentication Flow):**

```
function Authenticate(securityPrincipal, encryptedDataPortion):
  biometricData = GetBiometricData(securityPrincipal) // Capture biometric data

  if biometricData == null:
    return AuthenticationFailed // Biometric sensor failure

  salt = GenerateRandomSalt()
  hashedBiometricData = Hash(biometricData + salt)
  derivedKey = KeyDerivationFunction(hashedBiometricData)

  if VerifyAccessPolicy(securityPrincipal, derivedKey, encryptedDataPortion):
    return Success // Access granted
  else:
    return AuthenticationFailed // Access denied
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Entropy:** Dynamically adjust the key derivation parameters based on the detected entropy in the biometric data.
*   **Biometric Fusion:** Combine data from multiple biometric modalities to improve accuracy and security.
*   **Liveness Detection:** Implement liveness detection mechanisms to prevent spoofing attacks.
*   **Privacy-Preserving Biometrics:** Explore techniques for privacy-preserving biometric authentication.
