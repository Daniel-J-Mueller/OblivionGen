## Distributed Query Orchestration with Adaptive Data Materialization

**Concept:** Extend the tiered data processing framework by introducing adaptive data materialization based on query access patterns and network conditions. Instead of solely relying on remote query processing, proactively materialize frequently accessed data subsets closer to the compute nodes, creating a dynamic, multi-tiered caching system.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Access Pattern Monitoring:**

*   **Component:** *Query Pattern Analyzer* (QPA)
*   **Function:** Continuously monitor incoming queries, identifying frequently accessed data objects/partitions, filter predicates, and join keys.
*   **Output:** Generates access pattern reports indicating data subsets with high access frequency.
*   **Implementation:**  Utilize Bloom filters or Count-Min Sketch to efficiently track data access without storing complete query logs.

**2. Adaptive Materialization Engine:**

*   **Component:** *Materialization Manager* (MM)
*   **Input:** Access pattern reports from QPA, network bandwidth data from Network Monitor (see 3), local/remote storage capacity.
*   **Function:** Determine optimal materialization strategy.
    *   Prioritize materialization of frequently accessed data subsets based on access frequency, data size, and network latency.
    *   Select appropriate materialization location – local SSD, edge cache, or intermediate node.
    *   Initiate data transfer and materialization process.
*   **Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    function determine_materialization_strategy(access_patterns, network_bandwidth, storage_capacity):
        materialization_candidates = filter(access_patterns, frequency > threshold and size < max_materializable_size)
        sorted_candidates = sort(materialization_candidates, by=access_frequency, descending=True)

        for candidate in sorted_candidates:
            location = select_materialization_location(candidate.size, network_bandwidth, storage_capacity)
            if location != None:
                transfer_data(candidate, location)
                update_metadata(candidate, location) // Store location in metadata for query routing
            else:
                break // Stop materializing if no suitable location found
    ```

**3. Network Monitor:**

*   **Component:** *Network Health Probe* (NHP)
*   **Function:** Continuously monitor network bandwidth, latency, and packet loss between compute nodes, remote data stores, and potential materialization locations.
*   **Output:** Provides real-time network health data to the Materialization Manager and Query Router.

**4. Query Router Enhancement:**

*   **Component:** *Enhanced Query Router* (EQR)
*   **Function:** Modify query plan generation to incorporate materialized data.
    *   Consult metadata to determine if requested data is available in a materialized location.
    *   If available, rewrite query to access materialized data instead of remote source.
    *   Dynamic adjustment of execution plan based on network conditions. If network conditions degrade, prioritize materialized data access even if slightly stale.

**5. Data Consistency Management:**

*   **Component:** *Stale Data Handler* (SDH)
*   **Function:** Implement mechanisms to manage stale data in materialized locations.
    *   Time-To-Live (TTL) based invalidation – automatically expire materialized data after a defined period.
    *   Change Data Capture (CDC) – track changes in remote data sources and propagate updates to materialized locations incrementally.
    *   Query-time validation – verify data freshness before using materialized data.

**Data Structures:**

*   *Access Pattern Report:*  {data_object_id, access_frequency, filter_predicates, join_keys}
*   *Materialization Metadata:* {data_object_id, materialization_location, last_updated, TTL}
*   *Network Health Data:* {bandwidth, latency, packet_loss}
