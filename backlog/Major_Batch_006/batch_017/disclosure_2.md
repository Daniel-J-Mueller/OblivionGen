## Predictive Resource Allocation for Disaster Recovery

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Instead of solely reacting to detected failures, proactively allocate resources in the failover region *based on predictive analysis of potential failure scenarios*. This introduces a 'warm standby' approach exceeding simple redundancy.

**II. Components:**

*   **Failure Prediction Engine:** This is the central intelligence. It ingests data from multiple sources:
    *   **System Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network latency – across *all* resources in the primary region.
    *   **Log Analysis:** Error rates, warning messages, application performance data.
    *   **External Data Feeds:** Weather patterns (for physical infrastructure risks), geopolitical events, known vulnerabilities disclosed in security bulletins.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Machine learning models to identify deviations from baseline behavior, flagging potential issues *before* they become critical.
*   **Risk Scoring System:** Assigns a numerical risk score to each component/service in the primary region. This score factors in:
    *   Probability of failure (derived from the Failure Prediction Engine).
    *   Impact of failure (based on service criticality and dependencies).
    *   Recovery Time Objective (RTO) & Recovery Point Objective (RPO) – defined by SLAs.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocator:**  This component continuously monitors risk scores and dynamically allocates resources in the failover region.
    *   **Tiered Allocation:** Resources are allocated in tiers based on risk level.
        *   *High Risk*: Full resource replication & continuous data synchronization.
        *   *Medium Risk*: Scalable resource provisioning with near-real-time data replication.
        *   *Low Risk*: Minimal resource allocation – sufficient for basic service recovery.
    *   **Resource Types:** Allocation extends beyond VMs to include databases, storage, networking components, and potentially even pre-configured application stacks.
*   **Failover Orchestrator:** When a failure occurs (or is *predicted* with high confidence), this component orchestrates the failover process:
    *   DNS updates (as in the original patent).
    *   Application re-direction.
    *   Data synchronization finalization.
    *   Health checks to ensure successful failover.

**III. Pseudocode (Dynamic Resource Allocator):**

```
function allocateResources(component, riskScore):
  if riskScore >= 0.8:  // High Risk
    allocateFullReplication(component)
    startContinuousDataSync(component)
  else if riskScore >= 0.5: // Medium Risk
    provisionScalableResources(component, scaledCapacity = riskScore * maxCapacity)
    startNearRealTimeDataSync(component)
  else: // Low Risk
    provisionMinimalResources(component)

function monitorRiskScores():
  while true:
    for component in allComponents:
      component.riskScore = calculateRiskScore(component)
      allocateResources(component, component.riskScore)
    sleep(60 seconds) // Check every minute
```

**IV. Data Structures:**

*   `Component`: Contains information about a service/application (name, dependencies, RTO, RPO, current risk score, allocated resources).
*   `ResourcePool`: Represents available resources in the failover region (VMs, storage, network).

**V. Novelty:**

This system moves beyond reactive disaster recovery to *proactive* risk mitigation. By predicting potential failures and pre-allocating resources, it minimizes downtime and data loss, exceeding the capabilities of traditional failover solutions. It also enables a more granular and cost-effective approach to resource allocation, optimizing utilization in the failover region.
