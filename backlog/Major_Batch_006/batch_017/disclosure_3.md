## Adaptive Content Re-Synthesis for Dynamic Viewports

**Concept:** Extend the fragment/skeleton approach to *actively re-synthesize* content fragments on the client-side based on viewport size and user interaction, going beyond simply loading pre-defined fragments. This allows for truly responsive content adaptation, minimizing data transfer and maximizing rendering efficiency.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Content Decomposition:** The initial structured language data is decomposed into:
    *   **Semantic Units:**  The core meaningful units of content (e.g., paragraphs, list items, image captions).  These are identified through markup or automated analysis.
    *   **Presentation Primitives:**  Low-level formatting instructions (font, size, color, spacing, etc.). These are separated and form the foundation of the skeleton.
    *   **Asset References:** Pointers to external assets (images, videos, etc.).

2.  **Skeleton Structure:** The skeleton isn't just formatting; it’s a *graph* of presentation primitives linked to semantic units.  Nodes represent primitives; edges represent relationships.  Crucially, the graph includes *adaptation rules*. These rules define how primitives can be modified (e.g., scale font size, adjust image resolution, truncate text) based on viewport constraints.

3.  **Initial Fragment Generation:** A small set of *base fragments* are transmitted initially. These fragments represent the minimal content needed for a basic rendering.

4.  **Client-Side Re-Synthesis Engine:** The client device hosts a “Re-Synthesis Engine.” This engine operates as follows:
    *   **Viewport Analysis:** Continuously monitors viewport size and user interaction (e.g., zoom, scroll).
    *   **Dependency Traversal:**  Starting with the visible portion of the content graph, the engine traverses dependencies to identify content needed for rendering.
    *   **Adaptation Application:** Based on the adaptation rules in the skeleton and current viewport constraints, the engine *synthesizes* new fragments on the fly. This might involve:
        *   Generating resized images.
        *   Truncating long text strings.
        *   Adjusting font sizes and spacing.
        *   Replacing complex layouts with simplified versions.
    *   **Fragment Request:** If necessary, the engine requests missing assets or base content from the server.

5.  **Differential Updates:** The server maintains a history of transmitted fragments. When the viewport changes, the client sends a “delta” describing the changes. The server responds with only the *differences* between the old and new fragments, minimizing data transfer.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Re-Synthesis Engine - Fragment Generation):**

```pseudocode
function generateFragments(visibleNode, viewportConstraints):
    fragments = []
    queue = [visibleNode]

    while queue is not empty:
        node = queue.pop()

        fragment = createFragment(node) // Based on node's content & formatting

        // Apply adaptation rules based on viewportConstraints
        fragment = adaptFragment(fragment, viewportConstraints)

        fragments.append(fragment)

        // Add dependencies to the queue (e.g., linked images, dependent paragraphs)
        for dependency in node.dependencies:
            if dependency not in processedNodes:
                queue.append(dependency)
                processedNodes.append(dependency)

    return fragments
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Skeleton Graph:** Node (Presentation Primitive, Content ID, Dependencies), Edge (Relationship Type).
*   **Fragment:** Content Data, Formatting Instructions, Position Information, Skeleton ID.
*   **Viewport Constraints:** Width, Height, Pixel Density, Zoom Level.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Fragment Generation:**  Anticipate user scrolling and pre-generate fragments for upcoming sections.
*   **AI-Powered Adaptation:** Utilize machine learning to optimize adaptation rules based on user behavior and content characteristics.
*   **Collaborative Re-Synthesis:** Enable multiple clients to collaboratively re-synthesize content in a shared environment.
