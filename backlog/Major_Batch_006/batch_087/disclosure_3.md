**Data Lineage Graph with Probabilistic Attestation**

**Concept:** Extend the audit system to not only validate data transformations but to construct a probabilistic data lineage graph, providing confidence scores for data quality at each stage.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Lineage Node:**
    *   Each service (first service, second service, audit service) becomes a "Lineage Node."
    *   Each Node maintains a local "Attestation Score" (initially 1.0).
    *   Each Node logs not just operation types & identifiers, but also execution metadata (timestamps, resource usage, error codes).

2.  **Edge Creation:**
    *   When data flows from Service A to Service B, an “Edge” is created in the lineage graph.
    *   The Edge stores the transformation function applied and a copy of the audit information (checksums, operation counts) exchanged between services.
    *   Edges also store a "Propagation Score" (initially 1.0).

3.  **Attestation Score Update:**
    *   When the audit service validates a transformation, it updates the Propagation Score of the corresponding Edge.
    *   If the audit fails, the Propagation Score is reduced (e.g., halved).
    *   Each Lineage Node's Attestation Score is calculated as the product of all incoming Propagation Scores.
    *   A global "Data Quality Score" for the data is calculated as the minimum Attestation Score of any Node in the lineage.

4.  **Probabilistic Data Reconstruction:**
    *   Introduce "Data Samples" representing subsets of data at each Lineage Node.
    *   Each sample is associated with a probability weight based on the node's Attestation Score.
    *   Allow users to query the lineage graph for "Probable Data" – a weighted combination of data samples from different nodes, reflecting the confidence in each source.

5.  **Anomaly Detection:**
    *   Monitor Attestation Scores and Propagation Scores for significant drops.
    *   Trigger alerts when a node's score falls below a threshold, indicating a potential data quality issue.
    *   Implement a "Drift Detection" mechanism to identify changes in data distribution that could affect the lineage graph.

**Pseudocode (Attestation Score Update):**

```
function update_attestation_score(edge, audit_result):
  if audit_result == SUCCESS:
    edge.propagation_score = edge.propagation_score * 0.95  // Slight increase
  else:
    edge.propagation_score = edge.propagation_score * 0.5   // Significant decrease

  # Update node attestation scores (recursive)
  for node in edge.destination_node.incoming_edges:
    update_attestation_score(node, audit_result)

# Example:
edge1 = Edge(source_node = serviceA, destination_node = serviceB)
update_attestation_score(edge1, SUCCESS)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) for storing lineage graph.
*   Message queue (Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication between services.
*   Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) for visualizing lineage graph & scores.
*   Data sampling algorithms for efficient data reconstruction.
