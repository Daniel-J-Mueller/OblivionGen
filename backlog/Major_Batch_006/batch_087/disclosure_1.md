## Dynamic URL Component Swapping & Predictive Content Delivery

**Concept:** Expand on the URL rescue strategy by not just *searching* based on mined terms, but *dynamically swapping* components within the invalid URL with predicted alternatives, then *proactively* fetching and preparing content based on those predictions *before* a full response is sent.

**Specs:**

*   **Component Identification Module:**  A module that parses the invalid URL, identifying key components (e.g., product ID, category, search terms, filters). This builds a hierarchical tree representing the URL structure.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model trained on historical URL request data (both valid and invalid). This model predicts likely valid alternatives for each identified component, based on the surrounding context and user history.  Consider using a transformer model for contextual understanding.  The model outputs a probability score for each predicted alternative.
*   **Dynamic URL Generator:**  This module generates multiple candidate URLs by swapping out the invalid components with their predicted alternatives, weighted by the prediction engineâ€™s probability scores.
*   **Pre-Fetch & Render Service:** A service that proactively fetches content corresponding to the top-N candidate URLs (e.g., top 3-5). This service caches the rendered HTML or JSON responses.  Utilize server-side rendering (SSR) or static site generation (SSG) for speed.
*   **Response Prioritization & Delivery Module:** Upon receiving the invalid URL request, this module checks if any pre-fetched content matches the dynamically generated candidate URLs.  If a match is found, the pre-fetched content is immediately prioritized and sent to the user.  If no match is found, the system falls back to the existing search-based rescue strategy.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function handleInvalidURL(url) {
  componentTree = parseURL(url);
  predictedAlternatives = PredictionEngine.predict(componentTree);
  candidateURLs = generateCandidateURLs(componentTree, predictedAlternatives);

  prefetchedContent = PrefetchService.get(candidateURLs);

  if (prefetchedContent) {
    // Content found, prioritize and send
    return prefetchedContent;
  } else {
    // Fallback to existing rescue strategy
    rescueResult = existingRescueStrategy(url);
    return rescueResult;
  }
}

function generateCandidateURLs(componentTree, predictedAlternatives) {
  candidates = [original URL]; // Start with the original URL

  for (component in componentTree) {
    if (predictedAlternatives[component]) {
      newCandidates = [];
      for (candidate in candidates) {
        for (alternative in predictedAlternatives[component]) {
          newURL = replaceComponent(candidate, component, alternative);
          newCandidates.push(newURL);
        }
      }
      candidates = newCandidates;
    }
  }

  return candidates;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `componentTree`: A hierarchical JSON object representing the URL structure.  Example: `{ "protocol": "https", "domain": "example.com", "category": "electronics", "product_id": "12345", "filter": "color=red" }`
*   `predictedAlternatives`: A JSON object storing predicted alternatives for each component.  Example: `{ "product_id": ["67890", "24680"], "category": ["computers", "accessories"] }`

**Scalability:**

*   Caching is crucial. Implement a multi-layered caching system (e.g., in-memory, Redis, CDN).
*   Distribute the pre-fetch and render service across multiple servers.
*   Utilize asynchronous processing for pre-fetching and rendering.
