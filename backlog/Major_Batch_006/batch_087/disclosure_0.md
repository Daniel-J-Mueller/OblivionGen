**Dynamic Sentiment-Driven Topic Drift Detection & Response**

**Concept:** Extend the existing quote extraction system to not only *find* representative quotes but to actively *detect* shifts in customer sentiment around specific topics *over time* and proactively adapt displayed information. This moves beyond static quote selection to a dynamic, responsive system that reflects evolving customer opinion.

**Specs:**

1.  **Time-Series Sentiment Analysis:** Implement a time-series analysis module operating on the parsed customer review sentences. Sentiment scores (positive, negative, mixed, neutral) are aggregated *per topic* over defined time intervals (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

2.  **Drift Detection Algorithm:** Employ a drift detection algorithm (e.g., Page-Hinkley test, ADWIN) on the time-series sentiment data for each topic. This will identify statistically significant changes in sentiment – a ‘drift’ indicating evolving customer opinion.  Parameters for drift detection will need to be adjustable for sensitivity.

3.  **Adaptive Quote Selection:** Upon detection of a sentiment drift for a topic:
    *   **Re-parse Recent Reviews:**  Re-parse customer reviews within a defined recent window (e.g., last 7 days) focusing on the drifted topic.
    *   **Re-evaluate Sentence Relevance:** Re-evaluate the relevance of sentences (using TF-IDF, cosine similarity, or the existing methods) to the topic, weighting recent sentences more heavily.
    *   **Dynamic Quote Replacement:** Replace the currently displayed representative quote for that topic with a newly selected quote reflecting the *current* sentiment.
    *   **Sentiment Indicator Display:** Display a visual indicator (e.g., upward/downward trend arrow, color change) next to the topic, showing the direction and magnitude of the sentiment drift.

4.  **Proactive Notification System:**  If a significant sentiment drift is detected, trigger a notification to internal stakeholders (e.g., product managers, marketing) highlighting the topic and the nature of the shift.

5.  **Multi-Topic Drift Correlation:** Implement a module to identify *correlations* between sentiment drifts across multiple topics.  For example, a negative drift in “battery life” might correlate with a negative drift in “ease of use,” suggesting a broader issue.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (executed periodically)
FOR EACH topic
    sentimentData = GetTimeSeriesSentiment(topic) // Returns sentiment scores over time
    driftDetected = DetectSentimentDrift(sentimentData)

    IF driftDetected
        recentReviews = GetRecentReviews(topic)
        re-rankedSentences = ReRankSentences(recentReviews, topic) // using TF-IDF etc.
        newQuote = SelectRepresentativeSentence(re-rankedSentences)
        DisplayNewQuote(topic, newQuote)
        DisplaySentimentIndicator(topic, sentimentDirection)
        NotifyStakeholders(topic, sentimentDirection)

        //Correlation analysis
        correlatedTopics = FindCorrelatedTopics(topic)
        IF correlatedTopics
            NotifyStakeholders(correlatedTopics, "Potential issue correlated with " + topic)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `TimeSeriesSentiment`:  List of (timestamp, sentiment score) pairs for a given topic.
*   `TopicData`:  Contains topic name, `TimeSeriesSentiment`, and associated representative quotes.
