## Secure Attestation of VM Dependencies

**Concept:** Extend the secure execution model to encompass not just the VMM itself, but also critical dependencies *loaded by* the VMM, creating a chain of trust extending beyond the hypervisor. This addresses potential compromise via malicious or tampered-with modules used by the VMM.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component:** Dependency Attestation Module (DAM) - a software component integrated within the VMM and interfacing with the trusted co-processor.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DependencyManifest`: A digitally signed list of expected dependencies (libraries, modules) for the VMM, including expected hash values (SHA-256 preferred) and version numbers. Stored securely within the co-processor’s trusted environment.
    *   `DependencyReport`: A report generated by the DAM containing the hash values of currently loaded dependencies.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Initialization:** During VMM startup, the DAM loads the `DependencyManifest` from the co-processor.
    2.  **Dependency Loading:** As the VMM loads dependencies, the DAM intercepts these loads.
    3.  **Hashing & Reporting:** The DAM calculates the hash of the loaded dependency and adds it to the `DependencyReport`.
    4.  **Attestation Request:** The `DependencyReport` is sent to the trusted co-processor.
    5.  **Verification:** The co-processor compares the hashes in the `DependencyReport` against the `DependencyManifest`.
    6.  **Secure Mode Control:** If *all* dependencies match, secure mode is enabled (or continues).  If *any* dependency fails verification, secure mode is *immediately* disabled, and an error is logged. The VMM is effectively halted (graceful shutdown preferred).
    7.  **Dynamic Updates:** Mechanism for updating the `DependencyManifest` securely (signed updates pushed via a secure channel).
*   **Pseudocode (DAM - core verification logic):**

```
function verifyDependencies(dependencyReport, dependencyManifest) {
  for each dependency in dependencyReport {
    if dependency.hash not in dependencyManifest.hashes {
      logError("Dependency verification failed: " + dependency.name)
      return false // Verification failed
    }
  }
  return true // All dependencies verified
}

function onDependencyLoad(dependencyName, dependencyPath) {
    hash = calculateHash(dependencyPath)
    dependencyReport.add(dependencyName, hash)
    if (!verifyDependencies(dependencyReport, dependencyManifest)) {
      haltVMM()
    }
}
```

*   **Co-Processor Interface:**  A dedicated API call for submitting `DependencyReport` and receiving a boolean ‘verification successful’ response. The co-processor should also store the `DependencyManifest` securely and provide integrity protection for it.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   The `DependencyManifest` must be protected from tampering.
    *   The communication channel between the VMM and the co-processor must be secure.
    *   The co-processor's firmware must be trustworthy.
*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Support for multiple `DependencyManifests` (e.g., for different VMM configurations).
    *   Integration with a remote attestation service to verify the integrity of the entire platform (VMM, dependencies, co-processor).
    *   Implementation of a "sandboxing" mechanism to isolate potentially compromised dependencies.
