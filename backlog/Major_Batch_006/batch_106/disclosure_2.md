## Dynamic Focal Point Calibration for Multi-Camera Systems

**Concept:** Extend the calibration process beyond static alignment to incorporate *dynamic* focal point adjustment based on user gaze tracking and predictive algorithms. This allows for real-time refinement of stereo disparity and 3D reconstruction, particularly beneficial in situations with rapid head movement or changing focus of attention.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing stereo camera system (as described in the referenced patent).
    *   Integrated high-resolution eye-tracking system (IR-based pupil tracking at 60-120Hz).
    *   Dedicated processing unit (GPU/FPGA) for real-time gaze data processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Gaze Data Acquisition:** Module to capture and pre-process eye-tracking data (pupil position, blink detection, calibration data).
    *   **Predictive Gaze Modeling:** LSTM or Transformer-based model trained to predict future gaze position based on historical gaze data. This mitigates latency and anticipates head/eye movements.
    *   **Dynamic Calibration Matrix:** A calibration matrix that is *continuously* updated based on the predicted gaze position.  The matrix will map pixel coordinates to 3D world coordinates.
    *   **Disparity Map Refinement:** Module to generate a disparity map based on the refined calibration data.  Algorithms will be adapted to account for the non-static calibration.
    *   **Quality Assessment:**  Algorithm to assess the quality of the refined disparity map.  If quality falls below a threshold, revert to a static calibration state or signal a recalibration request.
*   **Algorithm Details:**
    1.  **Initial Calibration:** Perform a standard stereo calibration using a calibration target.
    2.  **Gaze Tracking Initialization:** Initialize the eye-tracking system and calibrate it to the user.
    3.  **Real-time Operation:**
        *   Acquire images from both cameras.
        *   Acquire gaze data (predicted gaze point in world coordinates).
        *   Calculate a transformation matrix that maps the current static calibration to a dynamic calibration centered around the predicted gaze point. This matrix will correct for distortions introduced by non-optimal gaze focus.
        *   Apply this transformation to the images before generating a disparity map.
        *   Constantly monitor the quality of the disparity map. If the quality degrades, revert to the static calibration.
        *   Continuously update the predictive gaze model with new gaze data.

**Pseudocode (Disparity Map Refinement):**

```
function refineDisparityMap(leftImage, rightImage, predictedGazePoint):
    // Get current calibration matrix
    calibrationMatrix = getCurrentCalibrationMatrix()

    // Calculate transformation matrix based on predicted gaze point
    transformationMatrix = calculateGazeTransformationMatrix(predictedGazePoint)

    // Apply transformation to images
    transformedLeftImage = applyTransformation(leftImage, transformationMatrix)
    transformedRightImage = applyTransformation(rightImage, transformationMatrix)

    // Generate disparity map using transformed images
    disparityMap = generateDisparityMap(transformedLeftImage, transformedRightImage)

    // Assess disparity map quality
    qualityScore = assessDisparityMapQuality(disparityMap)

    if qualityScore < threshold:
        // Revert to static calibration
        return generateDisparityMap(leftImage, rightImage) // Using original images

    return disparityMap
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy of 3D reconstruction, particularly in dynamic scenes.
*   Enhanced user experience in applications like augmented reality and virtual reality.
*   More robust performance in challenging lighting conditions or with fast head movements.
*   Potential for foveated rendering â€“ focusing processing power on the region the user is looking at.
