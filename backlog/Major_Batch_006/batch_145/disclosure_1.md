**Dynamic Contextual Audio Layering**

**Specification:**

1.  **Core Function:** Implement an audio layering system tied directly to the reflowable text highlighting described in the patent. Instead of *just* visual emphasis, introduce corresponding audio cues.

2.  **Audio Cue Library:** A curated library of short, non-intrusive audio cues (e.g., subtle chimes, textural sounds, very brief musical motifs). Each cue is categorized by 'emphasis level' (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary) and potentially by ‘content type’ (e.g., keyword, definition, proper noun).

3.  **Contextual Audio Triggering:**

    *   When ‘first text’ (highlighted primary text) is presented, a ‘Primary’ audio cue is played. This is the most prominent cue.
    *   When the ‘row of text’ (secondary text) is highlighted, a ‘Secondary’ audio cue is played, quieter than the Primary cue.
    *   Adjacent or related text (third/fourth text as described in the claims) receives a ‘Tertiary’ cue – extremely subtle, perhaps a textural change in an ambient sound.
    *   The *timing* of these cues mirrors the animation sequence described in the patent - cues are introduced *with* the visual emphasis and fade out *with* the reduction of emphasis.

4.  **User Customization:** Allow users to:

    *   Select from different audio cue ‘themes’ (e.g., minimalist, organic, technological).
    *   Adjust the volume levels of each emphasis tier (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary).
    *   Disable audio cues entirely.
    *   Associate specific audio cues with content types.

5.  **Pseudocode (Event Handling):**

```
OnTextReflow(text_block):
  first_text = text_block.get_primary_text()
  second_text = text_block.get_secondary_text()
  third_text = text_block.get_tertiary_text()

  // Animate the visual emphasis (as per patent)

  // Play Audio Cues:
  if (first_text):
    PlayAudioCue(first_text.type, "Primary", animation_start_time)
  if (second_text):
    PlayAudioCue(second_text.type, "Secondary", animation_start_time)
  if (third_text):
    PlayAudioCue(third_text.type, "Tertiary", animation_start_time)

OnAnimationComplete():
  StopAllAudioCues()

PlayAudioCue(text_type, emphasis_level, start_time):
  cue = GetAudioCue(text_type, emphasis_level)
  cue.Play(start_time)

GetAudioCue(text_type, emphasis_level):
  // Accesses the curated audio cue library
  // Returns appropriate audio file
```

6.  **Technical Considerations:**

    *   Low-latency audio playback is crucial to avoid desynchronization with the visual emphasis.
    *   Audio cues must be carefully designed to be non-distracting and enhance readability.
    *   The system should be adaptable to different audio hardware and operating systems.
    *   Consider spatial audio techniques to subtly position cues relative to the highlighted text.

7.  **Future Expansion:**

    *   Integration with text-to-speech (TTS) engines to dynamically generate audio cues based on the content.
    *   AI-powered audio cue selection based on the user’s reading speed and comprehension.
    *   Haptic feedback integration (vibration patterns) synchronized with the visual and audio cues.
    *   Personalized audio profiles based on user preferences and reading habits.
