**Dynamic Table Sharding with Predictive Resource Allocation**

**Concept:** Expand upon the partition/move/split functionality to create a system that *predictively* shards tables *before* restoration, based on anticipated query patterns and data growth. This moves beyond simply responding to configuration parameters during restoration to proactively optimizing the table structure.

**Specs:**

1.  **Query Pattern Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Historical query logs (if available), anticipated workload description (user-provided or inferred from application context).
    *   Output: Predicted query access patterns (e.g., frequently accessed columns, common filter criteria, likely join operations).

2.  **Data Growth Predictor:**
    *   Input:  Table schema, historical data growth rates (if available), user-defined growth expectations.
    *   Output: Predicted data volume and velocity for each potential shard.

3.  **Shard Proposal Engine:**
    *   Input: Query access patterns, data growth predictions, table schema.
    *   Process: Algorithmically determines an optimal sharding key and number of shards to maximize query parallelism and minimize data skew. Considers data locality.
    *   Output:  A sharding proposal â€“ a recommended sharding key, number of shards, and a mapping of data ranges (or hash values) to shards.

4.  **Pre-Restoration Shard Creation:**
    *   Process: *Before* the table is restored from backup, the system creates the proposed shards in the storage system.
    *   Output: Empty shards ready to receive data.

5.  **Parallel Data Import:**
    *   Process: As data is imported from the remote storage system, it is distributed in parallel to the appropriate shards based on the sharding key.  This requires modification to the existing import process.
    *   Output:  Data distributed across shards.

6.  **Dynamic Re-Sharding:**
    *   Process: A background process monitors query performance and data distribution. If performance degrades or data skew becomes significant, it triggers a re-sharding operation (splitting, merging, or moving shards) transparently.

7.  **Configuration Parameters:**
    *   `predicted_peak_qps`: Estimated queries per second. Used to size shards.
    *   `predicted_data_volume`: Estimated data volume.
    *   `data_retention_policy`: Impacts shard lifecycle (merge/archive).
    *   `rebalance_threshold`: Trigger for re-sharding based on data skew or performance.

**Pseudocode (Re-Sharding Logic):**

```
function rebalance_shards(table_name):
  data_distribution = analyze_data_distribution(table_name)
  performance_metrics = collect_performance_metrics(table_name)

  if data_distribution.skew > rebalance_threshold or performance_metrics.avg_query_time > acceptable_threshold:
    new_sharding_proposal = generate_sharding_proposal(table_name) // uses query analyzer, data growth predictor
    create_new_shards(new_sharding_proposal)
    migrate_data(old_shards, new_shards, new_sharding_proposal)
    decommission_old_shards(old_shards)
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems generally react to configuration changes *during* restoration. This approach proactively designs the table structure *before* data is loaded, based on anticipated usage patterns and data growth.  The dynamic re-sharding component ensures ongoing optimization. This moves from static partitioning to a self-optimizing, predictive data distribution system.
