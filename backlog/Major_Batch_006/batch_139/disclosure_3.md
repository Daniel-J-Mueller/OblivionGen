## Autonomous Container Sorting & Robotic Arm Integration

**Concept:** Expand the container holding fixture to incorporate a miniature, localized automated sorting system. Instead of *indicating* container location, actively *move* containers based on pre-programmed criteria.

**Specs:**

*   **Fixture Dimensions:** Scalable, modular design. Base unit: 60cm x 60cm x 30cm. Expandable in both X and Y dimensions using connecting modules.
*   **Container Slots:** Each slot (as in the patent) internally houses a miniature linear actuator/slider system. Travel distance: 15cm.  Each slider supports a standard container (dimensions user configurable - presets for common sizes).
*   **Internal Rail System:** A secondary, concealed rail system runs *beneath* the container slots, spanning the entire fixture length and width. This rail system forms a grid.
*   **Robotic Arm Integration:** A miniature, multi-axis robotic arm (approx. 30cm reach) is mounted centrally within the fixture. This arm is capable of lifting and moving containers between slots and to/from designated output zones.
*   **Sensing Suite:**
    *   **RFID/Weight Sensors (as in patent):** For container identification and basic content verification.
    *   **Miniature Camera Array:** Mounted above the slot array, providing a top-down view of all containers.  Used for image recognition (e.g., identifying item types visually).
    *   **Proximity Sensors:**  Located at the edges of the fixture, detecting when containers are moved to/from the system.
*   **Output Zones:** Designated areas (e.g., at the ends of the fixture) where containers are delivered by the robotic arm. These zones could be simple drop-off points or integrated with conveyor systems.
*   **Power & Communication:** Fixture connects to external power and network.  Wireless communication (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) for remote control/monitoring.
*   **Software & Control Logic:**
    *   **Container Database:** Stores container ID, content type, destination zone, etc.
    *   **Sorting Algorithms:** User-configurable algorithms to determine container routing.
    *   **Robotic Arm Control:**  Software to plan and execute container movements.
    *   **User Interface:**  Web-based interface for monitoring, control, and configuration.

**Pseudocode - Sorting Logic:**

```
FUNCTION sortContainer(containerID)
    containerData = getContainerData(containerID)
    destinationZone = containerData.destinationZone
    currentSlot = containerData.currentSlot

    IF currentSlot != destinationZone THEN
        //Plan robotic arm path to move container from currentSlot to destinationZone
        path = planPath(currentSlot, destinationZone)

        //Execute path
        executePath(path)

        //Update container data
        containerData.currentSlot = destinationZone
        saveContainerData(containerData)
    ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION planPath(startSlot, endSlot)
    //Algorithm to determine the shortest/most efficient path for the robotic arm
    //Consider obstacles (other containers, fixture structure)
    //Return a sequence of coordinates/movements for the robotic arm
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION executePath(path)
    //Send commands to the robotic arm to follow the path
    //Monitor arm movements and handle errors
ENDFUNCTION
```
