## Adaptive Event Weighting for Predictive Simulation

**Concept:** Extend the simulation service to dynamically adjust the "weight" or influence of past events when constructing simulated responses. This allows the system to learn and adapt to changing system behavior, rather than relying solely on historical data without considering context.

**Specifications:**

**1. Event Feature Extraction Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw event data (as currently handled).
*   **Process:**  Extract quantifiable features from each event. Examples:
    *   Event Type (categorical - encoded numerically)
    *   Payload Size
    *   Timestamp Delta (time since last event)
    *   Event Source/Destination ID
    *   Error Codes (if present)
*   **Output:** Feature vector representing the event.

**2. Contextual Embedding Layer:**

*   **Input:** Feature vectors from the Event Feature Extraction Module.
*   **Process:** Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder, recurrent neural network) to generate a low-dimensional embedding vector representing the "context" of the event. This embedding captures the relationships between events and their influence on the system.  The embedding size should be configurable.
*   **Output:** Contextual embedding vector.

**3. Weight Assignment Function:**

*   **Input:** Current event's contextual embedding vector, contextual embedding vectors of historical events in the simulation history database.
*   **Process:** Calculate a similarity score between the current event's embedding and each historical event's embedding (e.g., cosine similarity).  Apply a decay factor to the similarity score based on the age of the historical event (older events have lower weight). Normalize the weighted similarity scores to create a probability distribution representing the weight assigned to each historical event.
*   **Output:** Weight vector representing the influence of each historical event.

**4. Weighted Response Aggregation:**

*   **Input:** Historical event data, weight vector from Weight Assignment Function.
*   **Process:**  Calculate a weighted average of the simulated responses from historical events, using the weight vector. This creates a more accurate and contextually relevant simulated response for the current event.
*   **Output:** Simulated response.

**5. Learning and Adaptation Module:**

*   **Process:** Continuously monitor the accuracy of simulated responses (e.g., by comparing them to actual system behavior in a controlled environment).  Adjust the parameters of the learning model (e.g., embedding size, decay factor) to improve accuracy over time.  This can be implemented using reinforcement learning or supervised learning techniques.
*   **Output:** Updated model parameters.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function generate_simulated_response(current_event, simulation_history):
  current_event_features = extract_features(current_event)
  current_event_embedding = generate_embedding(current_event_features)

  weights = []
  for historical_event in simulation_history:
    historical_event_features = extract_features(historical_event)
    historical_event_embedding = generate_embedding(historical_event_features)
    similarity = cosine_similarity(current_event_embedding, historical_event_embedding)
    weight = similarity * decay_factor(age(historical_event))
    weights.append(weight)

  normalized_weights = normalize(weights)

  weighted_responses = []
  for i in range(len(normalized_weights)):
    weighted_responses.append(simulation_history[i].response * normalized_weights[i])

  simulated_response = sum(weighted_responses)

  return simulated_response
```

**Configuration Parameters:**

*   Embedding Size (integer)
*   Decay Factor (float)
*   Learning Rate (float)
*   Similarity Metric (string - e.g., "cosine", "euclidean")
*   Historical Event Window (integer - maximum number of historical events to consider)
