## Adaptive Gait-Based Inventory Navigation

**Concept:** Extend weight-tracking to dynamically map inventory locations *based on* an agent's gait and weight distribution *while* navigating the facility. This creates a 'living map' constantly updated by user movement patterns, rather than relying solely on static inventory data.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution pressure sensors embedded in the facility floor (coverage > 75% of navigable space).  Sensor density: 1 sensor/0.25 square meters.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into agent wearables (shoes, vests, handheld devices).  Sampling rate: 100Hz.  Data points: Acceleration (x,y,z), Angular Velocity (x,y,z), Magnetic Field (x,y,z).
    *   Optional: RGB-D camera mounted on agent wearables for visual confirmation and object recognition.
*   **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  **Gait Analysis Module:** Real-time processing of IMU data to extract gait parameters (step length, cadence, stride variability, ground contact time, center of pressure).
    2.  **Weight Distribution Mapping:**  Correlate pressure sensor data with gait analysis. Identify unique weight distribution 'signatures' associated with different inventory locations as the agent walks *past* or *near* them.  A 'heat map' is generated reflecting weight concentration.
    3.  **Dynamic Inventory Map Creation:**  Build a probabilistic inventory map.  Higher probability assigned to locations where a unique weight signature consistently appears during agent traversal.  Map is updated continuously.
    4.  **Navigation Assistance:**  Integrate map into a navigation system (AR overlay, haptic feedback). Guide agents to inventory locations based on both location *and* weight signature.
*   **Pseudocode (Inventory Map Update):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateInventoryMap(agentID, gaitData, pressureData)
  // gaitData:  Step length, cadence, center of pressure
  // pressureData:  Array of pressure sensor readings

  // Calculate weight distribution signature based on gaitData and pressureData
  signature = CalculateSignature(gaitData, pressureData)

  // Loop through all inventory locations
  FOR EACH location IN InventoryLocations
    // Calculate distance between agent and location
    distance = CalculateDistance(agent, location)

    // IF distance < threshold AND signature matches location signature
    IF distance < 5 meters AND SignatureMatch(signature, location.signature)
      location.probability += 0.1 //Increase probability
    ENDIF
    
    // Decay all probabilities to prevent drift
    location.probability *= 0.99 //Slight decay
  ENDFOR
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database optimized for high-volume sensor data (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB).
*   **Agent Identification:** Utilize existing agent identification methods (facial recognition, badges, etc.) to associate gait and weight data with specific individuals.
*   **Calibration:** Initial facility scan to establish a baseline map of weight distribution due to static objects (shelving, machinery).



This system moves beyond simply tracking items removed from a location. It *learns* the layout of the facility through user movement, adapting to changes in inventory placement in real-time.  It's a 'smart' map that becomes more accurate with use.
