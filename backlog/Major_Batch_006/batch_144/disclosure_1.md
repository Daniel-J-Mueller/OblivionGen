## Dynamic Sensor Fusion & Predictive Occupancy Mapping

**System Overview:** This system expands on sensor data interpretation by creating a probabilistic occupancy map of the device's surrounding environment *before* a user interaction, and leverages this map to intelligently manage power states and pre-load anticipated application contexts.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Existing Sensors:** Microphone, Accelerometer (as in the base patent)
*   **ToF Sensor:** Time-of-Flight sensor (small form factor, short-range) – to create a sparse depth map.
*   **Low-Resolution Wide-Angle Camera:** Captures contextual visual information (color, shape) – primarily for object identification *after* initial ToF scan.
*   **Dedicated Edge TPU:** For localized sensor fusion and occupancy map generation.

**Software & Algorithm Specs:**

1.  **Baseline Occupancy Map Creation:**
    *   Every X seconds (configurable – default 5 seconds), the ToF sensor performs a 360-degree scan.
    *   Data is processed by the Edge TPU to create a sparse occupancy grid (e.g., 0.5m x 0.5m cells).
    *   Cells are assigned a probability value (0-1) representing the likelihood of being occupied.  Initial probability is low (e.g. 0.05).

2.  **Sensor Data Fusion & Probability Adjustment:**
    *   **Microphone:** Audio event detection (speech, footsteps, etc.). Increases occupancy probability of cells originating from sound source. Algorithm leverages directionality estimation (beamforming).
    *   **Accelerometer:** Motion detection – increases probability of cells related to movement. Differentiates between device movement and external motion.
    *   **Low-Resolution Camera:** Object recognition (identifying furniture, people, pets). Significantly increases probability of cells containing recognized objects.
    *   **Sensor Fusion Algorithm:** Bayesian network or Kalman filter to combine sensor data and update occupancy probabilities.  Each sensor acts as an observation node.
    *   **Historical Data Integration:**  Device learns common environmental configurations.  If the device is frequently used in a particular room, the historical occupancy map influences the current map.

3.  **Predictive State Management:**
    *   **High Probability Zone:** If a cell exceeds a certain probability threshold (configurable), the system predicts potential user interaction.
    *   **Pre-Loading:** Based on the predicted interaction and historical usage patterns:
        *   Wake up the display.
        *   Pre-load frequently used applications.
        *   Adjust audio settings (volume, equalizer).
    *   **Dynamic Power Allocation:**  Allocate power to relevant sensors (e.g., increased camera frame rate if a person is detected).

4.  **Adaptive Learning & Refinement:**
    *   **User Feedback:**  If the system incorrectly predicts a user interaction, incorporate the feedback to improve the model.
    *   **Environmental Mapping:** Continuously refine the occupancy map based on sensor data and user behavior.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate external data sources (e.g., calendar, location) to further refine predictions.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm – Probability Update):**

```
function update_occupancy_map(sensor_data):
  for each cell in occupancy_map:
    cell.probability = base_probability // Reset to base level

  // Apply sensor data influences
  for each sensor in sensor_data:
    sensor_influence = calculate_sensor_influence(sensor)
    for each affected_cell in sensor_influence.cells:
      affected_cell.probability += sensor_influence.weight

  // Normalize probabilities (ensure sum is 1 or less)
  normalize_probabilities(occupancy_map)

function calculate_sensor_influence(sensor):
  if sensor == "microphone":
    // Calculate direction and distance of sound source
    // Assign influence weight based on sound level and distance
  elif sensor == "accelerometer":
    // Detect motion and direction
    // Assign influence weight based on motion intensity
  elif sensor == "camera":
    // Identify objects and their locations
    // Assign high influence weight for recognized objects
  return influence
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart displays/mirrors
*   Automated lighting control
*   Proactive voice assistants
*   Enhanced security systems
*   Context-aware entertainment systems.
