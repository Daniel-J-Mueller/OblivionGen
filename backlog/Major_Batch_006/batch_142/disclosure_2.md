## Dynamic Resolution Prioritization & Predictive Streaming

**Concept:** Extend the region-of-interest (ROI) functionality by layering a predictive streaming component. Instead of simply responding to ROI requests, the camera proactively anticipates potential ROIs based on motion analysis *and* dynamically adjusts resolution based on predicted importance.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Existing image sensor and processing components (as in the referenced patent).
    *   Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for lightweight, real-time motion and object detection. (Minimum 8 TOPS performance).
    *   Increased circular buffer capacity (minimum 8GB) to accommodate higher-resolution pre-buffered frames.
    *   High-bandwidth communication link to external compute node (minimum 10 Gbps).
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Motion Prediction Module:** NPU-accelerated algorithm identifying moving objects/regions. Output: bounding box coordinates with confidence score and predicted trajectory.
    *   **Importance Heuristic:** Assigns an ‘importance score’ to each predicted ROI. Factors:
        *   Motion velocity (higher = more important).
        *   Object size (larger = more important).
        *   Proximity to user-defined areas of interest (e.g., designated safety zones).
        *   Object classification (using a lightweight model).
    *   **Dynamic Resolution Map (DRM):** A map overlaid on the full-resolution frame. Each area within the DRM is assigned a resolution level (1/4, 1/2, 3/4, Full). This is generated based on importance scores.
    *   **Predictive Streaming Manager:**
        *   Continuously monitors motion predictions and updates the DRM.
        *   Pre-renders frames with varying resolutions based on the DRM.
        *   Streams pre-rendered frames to the external compute node. Prioritizes regions with higher resolution.
        *   Fills the circular buffer with pre-rendered frames.
        *   Responds to ROI requests by accessing the relevant pre-rendered portion of the circular buffer, eliminating the need for on-demand downsampling/access.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (camera_active) {
    frame = capture_frame()

    motion_data = motion_prediction_module.analyze(frame)

    for (roi in motion_data) {
        importance = calculate_importance(roi)
        drm.update_resolution(roi, importance)
    }

    pre_rendered_frame = drm.apply_resolution_map(frame)
    stream(pre_rendered_frame)

    if (roi_request_received()) {
        region = get_roi_request_region()
        access_circular_buffer(region) // Access pre-rendered region
        transmit_region
    }
}
```

*   **Communication Protocol:** Extend the existing communication protocol to include metadata specifying the resolution levels used for each streamed frame.

*   **Calibration:** Implement a calibration procedure to optimize the importance heuristic and DRM parameters based on the specific application and environment.



This system shifts the focus from *reacting* to ROI requests to *proactively* streaming relevant data, reducing latency and improving overall system responsiveness. The dynamic resolution map allows for efficient bandwidth utilization and minimizes the amount of data transmitted for less important regions.
