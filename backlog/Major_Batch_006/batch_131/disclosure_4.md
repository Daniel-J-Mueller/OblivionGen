## Predictive Maintenance & Proactive Parts Ordering System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply surfacing potentially defective parts during a search. Build a system that *predicts* component failure based on vehicle data and proactively orders replacement parts *before* the customer experiences an issue.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Vehicle Telemetry: Real-time data streams from connected vehicles (OBD-II, sensor data).
    *   Historical Repair Data: Repair records from dealerships, independent shops, and customer-submitted data.
    *   Environmental Data: Weather patterns, road conditions (collected from public APIs & vehicle sensors).
    *   Parts Usage Data: Sales figures, warranty claims, and return rates for specific components.
*   **Predictive Model:**
    *   Machine learning algorithm (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network, Long Short-Term Memory) trained on the collected data.
    *   Model predicts the probability of failure for key components (e.g., brakes, battery, sensors) within a defined timeframe.
    *   Factors considered: Mileage, driving habits, environmental conditions, historical failure rates.
*   **Proactive Ordering Logic:**
    *   Threshold-based activation: When the predicted failure probability exceeds a configurable threshold, the system initiates a parts order.
    *   Customer Confirmation:  A notification is sent to the customer (via app/email) detailing the predicted failure, recommended part(s), and estimated replacement cost. Customer *must* confirm the order.
    *   Inventory Integration: System directly integrates with parts supplier inventory (dealership, aftermarket) for real-time availability and pricing.
    *   Scheduling Integration:  Optional integration with service scheduling systems. Customer can automatically book an appointment for part replacement.
*   **User Interface (Customer App):**
    *   “Vehicle Health” Dashboard: Displays predicted component failure probabilities, recommended maintenance, and ordered parts.
    *   Order Management: Customer can view, modify, or cancel proactive parts orders.
    *   Maintenance History:  Log of all maintenance activities, including proactive replacements.
*   **Backend Architecture:**
    *   Microservices architecture for scalability and maintainability.
    *   Data Lake: Store all raw data from various sources.
    *   Feature Engineering Pipeline: Extract relevant features from raw data for model training.
    *   Model Deployment Pipeline: Automate the deployment of trained models to production.
    *   API Gateway: Expose APIs for accessing system functionality.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Order Flow):**

```
function process_vehicle_data(vehicle_id, telemetry_data):
  # 1. Retrieve historical data for vehicle
  historical_data = get_historical_data(vehicle_id)

  # 2. Combine telemetry and historical data
  combined_data = merge_data(telemetry_data, historical_data)

  # 3. Run predictive model
  failure_probabilities = predict_failure_probabilities(combined_data)

  # 4. Check for threshold exceedance
  for component, probability in failure_probabilities.items():
    if probability > PROACTIVE_ORDER_THRESHOLD:
      # 5. Generate order proposal
      order_proposal = create_order_proposal(component)

      # 6. Send notification to customer
      send_notification(customer_id, order_proposal)

      # 7. Wait for customer confirmation
      confirmation = wait_for_confirmation(order_id)

      # 8. If confirmed, place order with supplier
      if confirmation:
        place_order(supplier_id, order_id)
```
