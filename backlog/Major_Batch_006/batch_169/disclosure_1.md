## Adaptive Data Partitioning with Predictive Function Execution

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust data partitioning *based on predicted function execution patterns* to optimize performance and resource allocation. This expands on the idea of parameter determination at partitions, but proactively reshapes those partitions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Execution History Monitor:**
    *   Continuously tracks function calls, associated tables, and execution times.
    *   Stores this data in a time-series database optimized for pattern detection.
    *   Calculates rolling averages and standard deviations for function execution frequencies and durations.
2.  **Predictive Analytics Engine:**
    *   Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, LSTM) trained on the execution history.
    *   Predicts future function execution patterns, including:
        *   Which functions are likely to be called.
        *   The data subsets (partitions) those functions will operate on.
        *   The expected load/concurrency for each function.
3.  **Dynamic Partitioning Manager:**
    *   Receives predictions from the Predictive Analytics Engine.
    *   Adjusts data partitioning dynamically, based on predicted load and access patterns.
    *   Strategies:
        *   **Replication:** Replicate frequently accessed partitions to multiple nodes.
        *   **Sharding:** Redistribute partitions across nodes to balance load.
        *   **Co-location:** Place partitions required by frequently co-executed functions on the same node.
        *   **Pre-computation:**  Pre-compute and cache results for common queries or function calls.
4.  **Resource Allocation Controller:**
    *   Based on predicted load, allocates resources (CPU, memory, I/O) to the nodes holding relevant partitions.
    *   Implements auto-scaling to add or remove nodes as needed.
5.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors the performance of the dynamic partitioning system.
    *   Feeds performance data back into the Predictive Analytics Engine to improve prediction accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Partitioning Manager):**

```
function adjust_partitions(predicted_function_calls, predicted_load):
  for function_call in predicted_function_calls:
    table = function_call.table
    partitions = function_call.partitions
    load = predicted_load[function_call]

    for partition in partitions:
      if load[partition] > threshold:
        replicate_partition(partition) # Copy partition to other nodes
      else if load[partition] < low_threshold:
        de_replicate_partition(partition) # Remove redundant copies

      # Move partitions that are frequently accessed together to the same node
      co_locate_partitions(partition, related_partitions)

  update_resource_allocation(predicted_load)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ExecutionHistory`: Time-series data of function calls, durations, and associated tables/partitions.
*   `Prediction`: Data structure containing predicted function calls, load, and data access patterns.
*   `PartitionMetadata`: Information about each partition, including location, replication status, and related partitions.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply determining a parameter value *at* a partition. It dynamically *reshapes* the partitions themselves based on predictive analytics, optimizing the database for anticipated workloads. This offers significantly improved performance and resource utilization. It does not simply scale, but *adapts* and *anticipates*.
