## Adaptive Encryption Key Rotation via Biometric Drift

**Concept:** Leverage continuous biometric authentication *drift* as a trigger for re-encryption of locally stored data with a new, randomly generated key. This adds a layer of security beyond initial authentication and periodic re-keying, as it reacts to *changes* in user biometric data, potentially indicating compromised access or evolving security needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Sensor Integration:** System integrates with a persistent biometric sensor (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint) on the client device. This sensor *continuously* monitors biometric data while the device is in use.
*   **Drift Calculation:** A “drift score” is calculated. This isn’t a simple match/no-match, but a measure of the *difference* between current biometric readings and a baseline established during initial setup/authentication.  Algorithm considers factors like:
    *   Feature vector variance.
    *   Signal strength degradation.
    *   Pattern shifts in biometric data (e.g., subtle changes in fingerprint ridges).
*   **Drift Thresholds:** Multiple drift thresholds are defined:
    *   **Low Drift:** Normal variance, continuous monitoring.
    *   **Medium Drift:** Indicates potential anomaly (e.g., minor injury, environmental factor). Triggers increased monitoring and a warning to the user.
    *   **High Drift:**  Strong indication of compromised biometric data or a significant change in the user’s state.  Initiates automatic re-encryption.
*   **Re-Encryption Process:**
    1.  Upon reaching the ‘High Drift’ threshold:
    2.  A new random encryption key is generated.
    3.  All locally stored, encrypted data is decrypted using the current key.
    4.  The data is re-encrypted using the new key.
    5.  The old key is securely destroyed.
*   **Key Management:**
    *   The new encryption key is protected using a key-encrypting key (KEK) derived from the user's authentication credentials (SSO, IdP) *and* a hardware-backed key store (e.g., TPM, Secure Enclave).
*   **Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateDrift(currentBiometricData, baselineBiometricData):
  // Calculate feature vector difference
  featureDifference = CalculateFeatureDifference(currentBiometricData, baselineBiometricData)

  // Calculate signal strength difference
  signalStrengthDifference = CalculateSignalStrengthDifference(currentBiometricData, baselineBiometricData)

  // Combine differences into a drift score
  driftScore = (featureDifference * weightFeature) + (signalStrengthDifference * weightSignal)
  RETURN driftScore

FUNCTION HandleDrift(driftScore, driftThresholdHigh):
  IF driftScore > driftThresholdHigh THEN
    GenerateNewEncryptionKey()
    DecryptDataWithCurrentKey()
    EncryptDataWithNewKey()
    DestroyCurrentKey()
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

*   **User Notification:**  The user is notified of the re-encryption event and prompted to verify their identity (e.g., re-authenticate via SSO). This serves as a safeguard against malicious actors attempting to trigger re-encryption.
*   **Hardware Dependencies:** Requires a device with a persistent biometric sensor and a secure hardware key store.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   Spoofing attacks on the biometric sensor must be mitigated.
    *   The KEK derivation process must be robust.
    *   Regular security audits are essential.
