## Dynamic Authorization Context Synthesis

**Specification:** A system for dynamically synthesizing authorization contexts based on real-time telemetry and inferred user intent, supplementing or replacing static authorization contexts.

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on *identifying* existing authorization contexts. This specification details a system that *creates* them on-the-fly.  Instead of solely relying on pre-defined key-value pairs in requests, the system analyzes usage patterns, device characteristics, location, time of day, and other real-time data to *generate* authorization contexts.

**Components:**

1.  **Telemetry Ingestion:** Collects data from various sources:
    *   User device (type, OS, browser, network connection).
    *   Network infrastructure (IP address, geolocation).
    *   Application usage (features used, frequency, duration).
    *   External threat intelligence feeds.
2.  **Intent Inference Engine:** A machine learning model trained to predict user intent based on telemetry data.  For example:
    *   A user accessing a sensitive resource from an unusual location might trigger an "HighRiskAccess" context.
    *   A user repeatedly attempting failed actions might trigger a "PotentialAutomation" context.
    *   A user accessing resources associated with a recent security bulletin might trigger a "VulnerableUser" context.
3.  **Context Synthesis Module:** Combines inferred intent, telemetry data, and predefined rules to generate dynamic authorization contexts.  These contexts are represented as key-value pairs and added to the request before authorization checks.
4.  **Authorization Engine Integration:** The existing authorization engine is modified to recognize and utilize the dynamic authorization contexts alongside the static ones.

**Pseudocode (Context Synthesis Module):**

```
function synthesizeContext(telemetryData, userProfile, securityPolicies):
  intent = inferIntent(telemetryData, userProfile)
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(telemetryData, intent)

  context = {}

  if riskScore > threshold:
    context["RiskLevel"] = "High"
    context["GeoLocation"] = telemetryData.location
    context["DeviceType"] = telemetryData.deviceType

  if intent == "Automation":
    context["AutomationAttempt"] = "True"

  if telemetryData.deviceType == "Unknown":
    context["DeviceTrust"] = "Low"

  // Apply pre-defined rules based on telemetry and intent
  rules = getRules(telemetryData, intent, userProfile)
  for rule in rules:
    context[rule.key] = rule.value

  return context
```

**Example Usage:**

A user attempts to access a financial application from a new device in a new location. The system:

1.  Ingests telemetry data (device type, IP address, geolocation).
2.  Infers a high-risk scenario.
3.  Synthesizes the following authorization context: `{"RiskLevel": "High", "GeoLocation": "New York", "DeviceType": "Mobile"}`
4.  The authorization engine uses this context in addition to the user's existing roles and permissions.  A policy might require multi-factor authentication for "High" risk access.

**Novelty:**  This shifts the authorization paradigm from static definitions to dynamic adaptation, enabling more granular and context-aware security controls. It addresses the limitations of static authorization contexts in modern, dynamic environments.
