## Dynamic Resource Isolation via Encrypted Filesystem Shards

**Concept:** Extend the remote filesystem permissioning by introducing filesystem *shards* – encrypted subsets of the directory structure – assigned to tasks. This moves beyond simply controlling *access* to resources, to dynamically controlling *existence* of resources visible to a task.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Creation Service:** A component integrated with the deployment system. Accepts a data resource (file or directory), a task identifier, and an encryption key. It splits the resource into multiple encrypted “shards” – small, manageable file chunks. These shards are stored in a central repository. Metadata (shard ID, encryption key, task ID) is recorded.
*   **Task Launch Procedure:** When a task is launched, the coordinator requests a “manifest” from the deployment system. This manifest lists the shards required for that task.
*   **On-Demand Decryption & Mounting:** The coordinator’s kernel (or a dedicated service) decrypts the shards listed in the manifest using keys provided by the deployment system (secured channel essential). Decrypted shards are mounted as a temporary filesystem accessible *only* to that task.
*   **Ephemeral Filesystem:**  The mounted shard filesystem is ephemeral. Upon task completion, the filesystem is unmounted and the decrypted shards are securely erased from the coordinator’s memory.
*   **Key Rotation:** Encryption keys are rotated regularly and per task.  A secure key exchange protocol (e.g., Diffie-Hellman) is employed between the deployment system and the coordinator.
*   **Shard Redundancy:**  Shards are replicated across multiple storage locations to ensure availability and fault tolerance. Erasure coding can be used to minimize storage overhead.
*   **Dynamic Shard Creation/Destruction:**  The deployment system can dynamically create or destroy shards to adapt to changing resource requirements or security policies.
*   **Integration with Existing Permissioning:** Shards are *in addition* to existing filesystem permissions. Access control lists (ACLs) can further restrict access to decrypted data within shards.

**Pseudocode (Coordinator - Task Launch):**

```
function launchTask(taskId, userRole):
    manifest = deploymentSystem.getRequestManifest(taskId)
    shardList = manifest.shardList
    decryptionKeys = manifest.decryptionKeys

    tempMountPoint = createTemporaryMountPoint()

    for shard in shardList:
        decryptionKey = decryptionKeys[shard.shardId]
        decryptedData = decrypt(shard.shardData, decryptionKey)
        mount(decryptedData, tempMountPoint + "/" + shard.shardName)

    executeTask(taskId, userRole, tempMountPoint) // Task runs within the mounted shard filesystem

    unmountAll(tempMountPoint) // Remove the shard filesystem
    eraseData(tempMountPoint) // Securely erase decrypted data from memory
```

**Rationale:**

This goes beyond merely controlling access to files. It offers a layer of dynamic resource isolation. A compromised task cannot access data it was *never given the key to decrypt*, even if it bypasses standard filesystem permissions. This minimizes the attack surface and improves security.  It enables scenarios where different tasks operate on *different versions* of the same data, without interfering with each other.
