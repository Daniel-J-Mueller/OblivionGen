## Dynamic Event Bus Generation & Morphing

**Concept:** Expand the concept of event buses beyond static definitions. Allow event buses themselves to be dynamically generated *and* morphed during runtime, based on application state and user interaction. This goes beyond simply subscribing to existing buses.

**Specification:**

**1. Bus Morphing Engine:**

*   **Core Function:** A runtime engine responsible for constructing, deconstructing, and modifying event bus topologies.
*   **Morphing Primitives:**
    *   `CreateBus(busName, behaviorContext)`:  Creates a new event bus with an associated behavior context.
    *   `ConnectBus(sourceBus, destinationBus, eventTypeFilter)`: Establishes a connection between two buses, forwarding events of specified types.
    *   `DisconnectBus(sourceBus, destinationBus, eventTypeFilter)`: Removes a connection.
    *   `SplitBus(sourceBus, eventTypeFilter, newBusName)`: Creates a new bus from an existing one, filtering events based on type.
    *   `MergeBus(bus1, bus2, eventTypeFilter)`: Merges two buses into one, filtering event types.
    *   `RedirectBus(sourceBus, destinationBus, eventTypeFilter)`: Changes the destination of events on an existing bus.
*   **Behavior Context Support:**  Morphing primitives must respect and propagate behavior contexts.
*   **Version Control:** Implement versioning for bus topologies to allow rollback or experimentation.

**2. Reactive Bus Definition System:**

*   **Bus Definition Language (BDL):** A declarative language for defining bus topologies and morphing rules.
    *   Rules are triggered by application state changes or user interactions.
    *   Example BDL Rule: `IF (GameState == "LoadingLevel") THEN CreateBus("LevelEvents", "GameplayContext")`.
    *   Rules can be nested and chained.
*   **BDL Compiler:**  Compiles BDL rules into a runtime-executable plan for the Bus Morphing Engine.
*   **Real-Time Rule Evaluation:** BDL Compiler must output a runtime-efficient evaluation plan for real-time adaptation.

**3. Event Metadata Enhancement:**

*   **Event Provenance Tracking:**  Add metadata to each event indicating the bus it originated from, the morphing rules applied, and any intermediate hops.
*   **Dynamic Behavior Context Inheritance:**  Contexts should be dynamically inherited and modified as events travel through morphed buses.
*   **Event Type Polymorphism:** Allow events to be dynamically recast to fit different bus schemas during morphing.

**4. Visual Scripting Integration:**

*   **Bus Morphing Nodes:**  Expose the Bus Morphing Engineâ€™s primitives as visual scripting nodes.
*   **Real-Time Bus Topology Visualization:**  Display a live, interactive graph of the event bus topology within the visual scripting editor.
*   **Debugging Tools:** Tools for tracing event flow through morphed buses and identifying context conflicts.

**Pseudocode Example (BDL Rule Compilation):**

```
// Simplified BDL Rule:  IF (PlayerHealth < 20) THEN ConnectBus("PlayerEvents", "EmergencyAlerts", "HealthCritical")

Rule: {
    Condition: PlayerHealth < 20
    Action: ConnectBus("PlayerEvents", "EmergencyAlerts", "HealthCritical")
}

CompiledPlan: {
    ConditionEvaluator:  Function that checks PlayerHealth in real-time
    ActionExecutor: {
        Type: ConnectBus
        SourceBus: "PlayerEvents"
        DestinationBus: "EmergencyAlerts"
        EventTypeFilter: "HealthCritical"
    }
}

//Runtime Execution
IF (ConditionEvaluator() == TRUE) {
    Execute(ActionExecutor);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Dynamic Game World Adaptation:**  Event bus topology can change based on player actions, environment changes, or story progression.
*   **Adaptive UI/UX:**  Event buses can morph to reflect user preferences or application state.
*   **Real-Time Data Streaming:**  Dynamically route data streams based on network conditions or data priority.
*   **Robotics/Automation:** Adapt event communication pathways based on sensor input or task requirements.
