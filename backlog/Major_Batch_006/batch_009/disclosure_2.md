**Dynamic Sensor Fusion with Predictive Switching**

**Concept:** Expand upon the timed switching of sensors, but introduce a predictive element driven by onboard AI. Instead of *reacting* to completion of a transmission, the system *anticipates* when a sensor will finish, optimizing switchover time and potentially reducing latency. This also allows for prioritized sensor selection based on real-time scene analysis.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensors:** Multiple image sensors (minimum 2, scalable to N). Each sensor has a dedicated processing unit for preliminary data analysis.
*   **Switch:** High-speed multiplexer/demultiplexer (MUX/DEMUX) controlled by a dedicated sensor fusion AI.
*   **AI Core:** Onboard neural network (CNN/RNN hybrid) trained to predict sensor data transmission completion time based on scene content. Factors considered: image complexity, motion, lighting conditions, sensor type.
*   **Communication Protocol:** MIPI CSI-2 or equivalent for high-bandwidth data transfer.
*   **Power Management:** Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) for each sensor based on usage and predicted activity.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial State:** System is in a low-power standby mode. One sensor is active, transmitting data.
2.  **Prediction Phase:** The sensor's processing unit analyzes the captured data and feeds features to the sensor fusion AI.
3.  **Time-to-Completion (TTC) Estimation:** The AI predicts the remaining time for the current sensor to complete data transmission.
4.  **Switchover Scheduling:** The AI schedules the switchover to the next sensor *before* the current sensor finishes, minimizing downtime. The scheduling algorithm prioritizes sensors based on scene analysis (e.g., higher priority to sensors detecting fast motion).
5.  **Smooth Transition:** The MUX/DEMUX switches to the next sensor seamlessly, avoiding data loss or interruption.
6.  **Continuous Loop:** The process repeats continuously, dynamically adapting to the scene and optimizing sensor utilization.

**Pseudocode (AI Core - TTC Estimation):**

```
function estimate_ttc(sensor_data, scene_features, sensor_type):
  // Extract features from sensor data and scene features
  features = extract_features(sensor_data, scene_features, sensor_type)

  // Predict TTC using a trained neural network
  ttc = neural_network.predict(features)

  return ttc
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Sensor Calibration:** Precise sensor calibration is crucial for accurate TTC estimation.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The AI core should incorporate adaptive learning mechanisms to improve prediction accuracy over time.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling mechanisms are needed to handle unexpected events or sensor failures.
*   **Expandability:** The system should be designed to accommodate additional sensors and processing units.
*   **Sensor Prioritization:** Use a weighted priority system based on real-time application needs (e.g., prioritize thermal sensors for fire detection).
