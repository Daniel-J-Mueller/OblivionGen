## Dynamic Aerodynamic Profiling Rig

**Concept:** A system integrating the UAV weight/CoG measurement with real-time airflow simulation and aerodynamic surface control. This moves beyond static weight analysis to *active* aerodynamic optimization.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Unit:** Modified PMA system (from provided patent) – retains configurable weighing arms, scale coupling devices, and associated processors.
*   **Airflow Generation:** Array of independently controlled, variable-speed micro-ducted fans surrounding the PMA volume.  Fans generate controlled airflow patterns mimicking flight conditions (forward speed, angle of attack, wind gusts).
*   **Aerodynamic Surface Control:** Array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, shape memory alloy) mounted on small, articulating surfaces strategically positioned around the UAV’s lifting surfaces (wings, rotors). Controlled by the central processor. These act as miniature control surfaces.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution stereo vision system to capture surface airflow patterns (particle image velocimetry – PIV).
    *   Pressure sensors distributed across UAV lifting surfaces.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on UAV for attitude and rate data.
    *   Strain gauges on actuator mechanisms.
*   **Software/Processor:**
    *   Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver integrated into the system.  Real-time CFD simulations are informed by sensor data and control actuator positions.
    *   Reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize aerodynamic performance.
    *   Data logging and visualization tools.
    *   Communication Interface: Network connection for remote operation/data transfer.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  UAV placed on the PMA system. Initial weight and CoG determined.
2.  Airflow generators activated, creating desired flight conditions.
3.  Sensor data (airflow, pressure, IMU, strain gauges) acquired.
4.  CFD simulation runs, predicting aerodynamic forces and moments.
5.  Reinforcement learning algorithm adjusts micro-actuator positions to optimize lift, reduce drag, and improve stability. The algorithm aims to identify optimal aerodynamic configurations for various flight conditions.
6.  System logs performance metrics and aerodynamic configurations.
7.  Data transmitted to external systems for analysis and application to UAV control algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Optimization Loop):**

```
// Initialize parameters
airflow_speed = 0
angle_of_attack = 0
actuator_positions = [0, 0, 0, 0] // Initial actuator positions
learning_rate = 0.01

while true:
    // Simulate airflow
    simulate_airflow(airflow_speed, angle_of_attack)

    // Measure aerodynamic forces and moments
    forces, moments = measure_aerodynamics()

    // Calculate reward based on performance
    reward = calculate_reward(forces, moments) // Higher reward for lift/efficiency

    // Adjust actuator positions using reinforcement learning
    delta = learning_rate * reward * gradient(reward, actuator_positions)
    actuator_positions = actuator_positions + delta

    // Update airflow and repeat
    airflow_speed += increment
    angle_of_attack += increment
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   UAV design optimization – identify aerodynamic improvements.
*   Adaptive flight control – dynamically adjust aerodynamic surfaces for optimal performance.
*   Damage assessment – identify aerodynamic anomalies caused by damage.
*   Wind tunnel replacement – virtual testing of UAV designs.
