## Dynamic Credential ‘Lifecycles’ Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:** Implement a system where credentials aren’t just *issued*, but have dynamically adjusted lifecycles determined by continuous behavioral biometric analysis of the remote device user.

**Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometrics Engine:** A module running on the remote device (or a secure enclave within it). This engine collects data points such as:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure)
    *   Mouse/Touchpad movement (speed, acceleration, patterns)
    *   Scrolling behavior
    *   App usage patterns (frequency, duration, sequencing)
    *   Device orientation & movement (accelerometer data)
*   **Risk Scoring Module:**  This module, residing on the messaging broker (or a dedicated server), receives the behavioral biometric data stream. It utilizes machine learning models to establish a baseline ‘normal’ behavioral profile for each user.  Deviations from this baseline generate a risk score.
*   **Credential Lifecycle Manager:** Integrates with the existing authentication service provider.  This component dynamically adjusts the validity period of issued credentials (tokens, certificates, etc.) based on the real-time risk score.  Higher risk = shorter validity; Lower risk = longer validity.
*   **Adaptive Challenge System:** If the risk score exceeds a threshold, the system initiates an adaptive challenge. These could range from simple CAPTCHAs to multi-factor authentication prompts.  The challenge is tailored to the user’s history and the detected anomaly.

**Workflow:**

1.  Remote device authenticates via the existing system (e.g. initial TLS handshake & token exchange).
2.  Behavioral Biometrics Engine begins collecting data and transmitting it to the Risk Scoring Module.
3.  Risk Scoring Module updates the user's risk profile in real-time.
4.  When a service request is made:
    *   The Credential Lifecycle Manager checks the user's current risk score.
    *   Based on the score, it determines the validity period of the issued credential. If the current credential is nearing expiry, a new one is requested with the updated validity.
    *   If the risk score exceeds a pre-defined threshold, an adaptive challenge is triggered before a new credential is issued.
5.  The authentication service provider generates and issues the credential with the dynamically adjusted lifetime.
6.  Continuous monitoring and re-evaluation of the risk score throughout the credential’s lifecycle.

**Pseudocode (Risk Scoring Module):**

```
function calculate_risk_score(user_id, biometric_data):
  # Fetch user's baseline behavioral profile
  baseline_profile = get_baseline_profile(user_id)

  # Calculate deviation from baseline using ML model
  deviation_score = ml_model.predict(biometric_data, baseline_profile)

  # Combine deviation score with other risk factors (e.g., location, time of day)
  risk_score = combine_risk_factors(deviation_score, location, time_of_day)

  return risk_score

function get_baseline_profile(user_id):
  # Fetch historical biometric data for the user
  historical_data = fetch_historical_data(user_id)

  # Train a machine learning model to establish a baseline profile
  baseline_profile = train_model(historical_data)

  return baseline_profile
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Encrypted storage for historical biometric data.
*   Secure storage for machine learning models.
*   Real-time risk score updates.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Biometric data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
*   Machine learning models must be regularly retrained and updated to prevent evasion.
*   Privacy considerations must be addressed (data minimization, user consent).
*   System must be resilient to spoofing attacks (e.g., replay attacks, synthetic data).
