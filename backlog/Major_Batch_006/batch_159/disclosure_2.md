## Adaptive Payload Injection for Network Resilience

**Concept:** Expand upon the server’s ability to inject expected results into responses, not just for testing, but as a dynamic resilience mechanism against network disruptions or partial failures. Instead of *only* testing for expected results, the server can actively *provide* minimal viable data when it detects issues in fulfilling a request normally.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Resilience Injection Module (RIM) – A server-side module integrated into the existing test service framework.
*   **Triggering Conditions:**
    *   Network Latency exceeding a threshold (configurable).
    *   Dependency Service Unavailability (e.g., database connection failure).
    *   Data Corruption detected during request processing.
    *   Client-specified 'Resilience Mode' flag in the request.
*   **Payload Generation:** RIM maintains a catalog of “Minimal Viable Payloads” (MVPs) for common request types.  These MVPs are pre-defined, reduced-size responses designed to allow the client application to continue functioning in a degraded state.
*   **Injection Points:**  Similar to the existing system, MVPs are injected into the server response at configurable locations: status code, header, or body.
*   **Client Signaling:**
    *   Client sends a `Resilience-Mode: prefer-degraded` header to indicate it accepts degraded responses.
    *   Server responds with a `Resilience-Status: degraded` header if a degraded response was sent.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Configuration file specifies mappings between request types, triggering conditions, and corresponding MVPs.
    *   Configuration allows for specifying different MVPs for different client tiers (e.g., prioritizing critical clients).

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function handleRequest(request):
  try:
    response = processRequestNormally(request)
  except NetworkError as e:
    if request.headers.get("Resilience-Mode") == "prefer-degraded":
      mvp = getMinimalViablePayload(request.requestType) # Retrieves MVP based on request type
      response = injectPayload(mvp, request)
      addHeader(response, "Resilience-Status", "degraded")
    else:
      raise e # Re-raise the error if resilience mode is not enabled
  except DependencyError as e:
      if request.headers.get("Resilience-Mode") == "prefer-degraded":
        mvp = getMinimalViablePayload(request.requestType)
        response = injectPayload(mvp, request)
        addHeader(response, "Resilience-Status", "degraded")
      else:
        raise e
  return response

function injectPayload(mvp, request):
  # Logic to inject the MVP into the response (status, header, body) based on request configuration
  #  Uses existing injection logic from the test service
  pass

function getMinimalViablePayload(requestType):
  # Retrieves the MVP for the given request type from the configuration
  pass
```

**Example Scenario:**

A client requests a complex product catalog. The database is experiencing high latency. The client has sent `Resilience-Mode: prefer-degraded`.  The server responds with a minimal catalog containing only product names and basic pricing, omitting images and detailed descriptions. The `Resilience-Status: degraded` header informs the client that a degraded response was provided. The client application can then display the minimal catalog, allowing the user to continue browsing, instead of displaying an error message.
