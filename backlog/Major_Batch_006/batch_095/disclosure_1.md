**Adaptive Multi-Modal Contextual Prompting (AMCP)**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-fidelity multi-channel microphone array (minimum 8 channels).
    *   High-resolution, low-latency camera (minimum 1080p, 60fps).
    *   Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for real-time processing.
    *   High-bandwidth, low-latency communication link to backend processing.
*   **Software:**
    *   Operating System: Real-time OS (e.g., QNX, VxWorks) or optimized Linux distribution.
    *   Programming Languages: Python, C++, CUDA.
    *   Machine Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch.

**Core Functionality:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Data Acquisition:** Capture audio and video data synchronously.

2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    *   **Audio:** Extract features using a pre-trained audio embedding model (e.g., Wav2Vec 2.0) to generate high-dimensional audio vectors.  Focus on prosody, emotion, and semantic content.
    *   **Video:** Utilize a pre-trained video embedding model (e.g., TimeSformer) to extract facial expressions, body language, and scene context.

3.  **Contextual Fusion:**
    *   Create a combined multi-modal embedding by concatenating audio and video embeddings.
    *   Pass the combined embedding through a transformer-based fusion network. The fusion network learns to weight the contributions of audio and video based on the current context.

4.  **Dynamic Prompt Generation:**
    *   **Prompt Database:** Maintain a database of pre-defined prompts covering a wide range of topics and intents. These prompts are designed to elicit specific information or responses from the user.
    *   **Prompt Selection:** Based on the fused multi-modal embedding, a prompt selection model chooses the most relevant prompt from the database. The selection model is trained using reinforcement learning, rewarding prompts that lead to successful task completion.
    *   **Prompt Customization:** Before presenting the prompt to the user, a prompt customization model personalizes it based on the user's history, preferences, and current emotional state.  This involves modifying the wording, tone, and delivery of the prompt.

5.  **Contextual Prompt Delivery:**
    *   The customized prompt is delivered to the user via speech synthesis (TTS).
    *   The TTS engine uses a voice that is appropriate for the user's preferences and the context of the interaction.
    *   Visual cues (e.g., facial expressions, gestures) are displayed on a screen to enhance the prompt delivery.

6.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor the user's response (audio, video, and text).
    *   Analyze the user's response to assess the effectiveness of the prompt.
    *   Use the feedback to refine the prompt selection and customization models.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def process_input(audio_data, video_data):
  # Feature Extraction
  audio_embedding = extract_audio_features(audio_data)
  video_embedding = extract_video_features(video_data)

  # Contextual Fusion
  combined_embedding = fuse_embeddings(audio_embedding, video_embedding)

  # Prompt Selection
  selected_prompt = select_prompt(combined_embedding)

  # Prompt Customization
  customized_prompt = customize_prompt(selected_prompt, user_history, user_preferences)

  # Prompt Delivery
  synthesized_speech = text_to_speech(customized_prompt)
  display_visual_cues(customized_prompt)

  return synthesized_speech
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simply *recognizing* user intent and instead proactively *shapes* the conversation through dynamically generated prompts. The fusion of multi-modal data and reinforcement learning-based prompt selection allows for a highly adaptive and personalized conversational experience. The focus is on proactively guiding the user towards successful task completion. The integration of visual cues adds another layer of expressiveness and engagement.
