## Temporal Data Fabric for Multi-Database Consistency

**Concept:** Extend the versioned protection group concept to create a ‘Temporal Data Fabric’ capable of providing consistent snapshots across *multiple* databases, even those employing different database technologies (SQL, NoSQL, graph databases, etc.).  The current patent focuses on a single database; this expands the scope dramatically.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Component: Temporal Coordinator.**  A distributed service responsible for managing the creation and synchronization of temporal snapshots across heterogeneous databases.

**2.  Cross-Database Transaction Tagging.**  Every database operation (read/write) is tagged with a ‘temporal transaction ID’ (TTID). This TTID is generated by the Temporal Coordinator and propagates with the operation across all involved databases.

**3.  Versioned Data Blobs.**  Instead of direct page-level snapshots, data changes are captured as immutable ‘data blobs’ containing the TTID, database identifier, table/collection identifier, primary key, operation type (insert/update/delete), and the data delta.  These blobs are stored in a distributed object store (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage).

**4.  Protection Group Index (PGI) Expansion.** The PGI now includes a mapping of TTID ranges to locations of corresponding data blobs in the object store. It also tracks database-specific metadata (e.g., schema version).

**5.  Snapshot Reconstruction.** To reconstruct a consistent snapshot at a given point in time:

   *   The Temporal Coordinator determines the TTID range corresponding to the desired time.
   *   It queries the PGI to identify the relevant data blobs.
   *   It distributes the blob retrieval requests to multiple database nodes.
   *   Database nodes apply the data blobs to a clean copy of their schema (or a pre-existing snapshot) in a consistent manner.
   *   The reconstructed data is presented as a unified view.

**6.  Tiered Storage Management.**

   *   **Hot Tier:**  Recent TTID ranges (e.g., last 24 hours) are stored on fast storage (NVMe SSDs).
   *   **Warm Tier:** Older TTID ranges (e.g., last 7 days) are stored on cost-effective SSDs.
   *   **Cold Tier:**  Archival data (older than 7 days) is compressed and stored on object storage (S3 Glacier).

**Pseudocode (Snapshot Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructSnapshot(timestamp):
  ttidRange = getTTIDRangeForTimestamp(timestamp)
  blobLocations = PGI.query(ttidRange)
  
  for each database in involvedDatabases:
    databaseNode = getNodeForDatabase(database)
    
    blobsForDatabase = filter(blobLocations, database)
    
    databaseNode.applyBlobs(blobsForDatabase) // Applies data changes

  return unifiedDataView // Combines reconstructed data from all databases
```

**7.  Temporal Query Language (TQL) Extension.** Allow users to query data as it existed at a specific point in time using a TQL extension.  The TQL would translate temporal queries into requests for snapshot reconstruction.

**8. Conflict Resolution:**  Implement a mechanism for handling potential conflicts when applying data blobs from different sources. Strategies include: last-write-wins, timestamp-based resolution, or user-defined conflict resolution functions.
