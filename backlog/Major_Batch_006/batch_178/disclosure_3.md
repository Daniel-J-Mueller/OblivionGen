**Dynamic Texture Mapping & Haptic Feedback System**

**Core Concept:** Augment the 3D clothing model with dynamically applied texture and haptic feedback, simulating fabric feel *in addition* to visual appearance. This goes beyond simply capturing surface ornamentation; it actively *recreates* the sensation of touching the garment.

**System Components:**

1.  **Advanced Scanner:**  Beyond capturing geometry and color, the scanner incorporates micro-vibration sensors and thermal imaging. These sensors analyze the fabric’s micro-structure and thermal properties.
2.  **Texture Database:**  A vast library of material properties beyond visual texture – including friction coefficient, thermal conductivity, elasticity, and perceived weight.
3.  **Haptic Interface:** An array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or shape-memory alloy) integrated into a mannequin or a wearable sensor suit. These actuators can apply localized pressure, vibration, and temperature changes.
4.  **Rendering Engine:** Modified rendering engine to interpret material properties from the Texture Database and drive the Haptic Interface. 
5.  **Control System:**  Central processing unit manages the scanner, database, rendering engine and haptic interface.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Scanning:** The scanner captures the garment’s 3D geometry, color, and micro-structural data (vibration, thermal properties).
2.  **Database Lookup:** The control system searches the Texture Database for matching or similar material properties based on scan data. If a perfect match is not found, the system interpolates properties from known materials.
3.  **Model Augmentation:** The 3D model is augmented with material properties (friction, elasticity, thermal characteristics).
4.  **Haptic Mapping:**  The rendering engine maps the material properties to the Haptic Interface, generating a localized pressure, vibration, and thermal profile for each surface area of the garment.
5.  **Real-time Feedback:** As a user “touches” or interacts with the 3D model (via a VR interface, robotic arm, or physical interaction with the mannequin), the Haptic Interface provides corresponding tactile and thermal feedback. 
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continually monitors user interaction and adjusts the haptic feedback accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Control Loop):**

```
FOR EACH surface_point ON garment_model:
    material_properties = get_material_properties(surface_point)
    
    IF user_is_touching(surface_point):
        pressure = calculate_pressure(material_properties.elasticity, user_force)
        vibration = calculate_vibration(material_properties.friction, interaction_speed)
        temperature = material_properties.thermal_conductivity
        
        haptic_interface.apply_pressure(surface_point, pressure)
        haptic_interface.apply_vibration(surface_point, vibration)
        haptic_interface.set_temperature(surface_point, temperature)
    ELSE:
        haptic_interface.reset(surface_point)

END FOR
```

**Possible Enhancements:**

*   **Moisture Simulation:** Integrate humidity sensors and micro-fluidic systems to simulate fabric dampness.
*   **Drape Simulation:** Advanced physics engine to realistically simulate how the fabric drapes and moves.
*   **Personalized Feel:**  Allow users to customize the perceived feel of the garment (e.g., softer, stiffer, warmer).
*   **Remote Haptic Experience:** Transmit haptic data over a network, allowing users to remotely “feel” garments.
