**Adaptive Audio ‘Bubbles’ for Multi-User Environments**

**Concept:** Expand synchronized audio beyond paired devices to create localized, movable “audio bubbles” in a shared space, dynamically adjusting volume and content based on user proximity and interaction.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of low-power, beamforming microphones and speakers (minimum 4, scalable).
    *   UWB (Ultra-Wideband) or similar precise location tracking modules integrated into each speaker/microphone unit.
    *   Edge computing module (Raspberry Pi class) within each unit for initial audio processing and location data fusion.
    *   Central processing unit (NUC class) for central coordination, AI processing, and external content stream management.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Localization Module:** Utilizes UWB signals to determine the 3D position of each user within the space.  Accuracy target: +/- 5cm.
    *   **Bubble Creation & Management:**
        *   Users can define 'audio bubbles' via voice command or a mobile app. Bubble size is adjustable (1m to 5m radius).
        *   Algorithm to dynamically shape the audio bubble based on room geometry (walls, furniture) to minimize audio spillover.
        *   Prioritization of audio sources within the bubble.
    *   **Beamforming & Audio Rendering:**
        *   Algorithm to direct audio streams toward users within the bubble using beamforming speaker arrays.
        *   Dynamic volume adjustment based on user proximity and number of users within the bubble.
        *   Spatial audio rendering to create immersive soundscapes.
    *   **AI-Powered Context Awareness:**
        *   Speech recognition module to analyze user speech and adapt audio content (e.g., play relevant music, provide information).
        *   Activity recognition module to detect user activities (e.g., walking, sitting, talking) and adjust audio accordingly.
        *   Content prioritization based on user preferences and context.
    *   **Networking:**
        *   Wireless communication (Wi-Fi 6 or similar) for inter-device communication and connection to external content sources.
        *   Low-latency communication protocol for real-time audio streaming.

**Pseudocode - Dynamic Audio Bubble Adjustment**

```
FUNCTION AdjustAudioBubble(userID, userPosition, bubbleID)

  //Get Bubble Geometry
  bubbleGeometry = GetBubbleGeometry(bubbleID)

  //Calculate Distance to Bubble Center
  distanceToCenter = Distance(userPosition, bubbleGeometry.center)

  //Calculate Volume Adjustment
  volumeAdjustment = CalculateVolume(distanceToCenter, bubbleGeometry.radius)

  //Calculate Beamforming Direction
  beamformingDirection = CalculateBeamformingDirection(userPosition, bubbleGeometry.center)

  //Apply Volume and Beamforming to User's Audio Stream
  ApplyAudioSettings(userID, volumeAdjustment, beamformingDirection)

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateVolume(distance, radius)
  //Volume decreases linearly with distance from bubble center
  IF distance <= radius THEN
    volume = 1.0
  ELSE
    volume = MAX(0.0, 1.0 - (distance - radius) / radius)
  END IF
  RETURN volume
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION CalculateBeamformingDirection(userPosition, bubbleCenter)
  //Calculate direction vector from bubble center to user position
  direction = Normalize(userPosition - bubbleCenter)
  RETURN direction
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Multi-User Gaming:** Immersive soundscapes tailored to each player’s position.
*   **Open Office Environments:**  Localized audio for focused work or private calls.
*   **Museum Exhibits:**  Audio guides that follow visitors as they move through exhibits.
*   **Smart Homes:**  Personalized audio experiences in different rooms.
*   **Interactive Art Installations:** Soundscapes that respond to visitor movement.
