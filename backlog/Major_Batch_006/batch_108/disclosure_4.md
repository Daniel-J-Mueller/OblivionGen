## Dynamic Object Role Assignment via Temporal Feature Blending

**Concept:** Extend class-agnostic object detection by not just *identifying* objects, but inferring their *role* within a scene *over time* and dynamically adjusting feature representations to emphasize role-relevant characteristics. This moves beyond simple detection to contextual understanding and anticipatory behavior.

**Specs:**

1.  **Temporal Feature Buffer:** Maintain a sliding window of recent frames (e.g., 5-10 frames) for each detected object. Each frame’s class-agnostic feature data is stored, along with a timestamp.

2.  **Role Definition Database:** A pre-populated (and dynamically expandable) database containing ‘role profiles’. Each profile is a weighted combination of class-agnostic feature expectations. Examples:
    *   ‘Pedestrian Crossing’: Emphasizes features related to motion vectors indicating crossing direction, proximity to crosswalk markings, and features suggesting intent (e.g., head/body orientation).
    *   ‘Vehicle Approaching Intersection’: Emphasizes features related to speed, trajectory convergence, turn signal activation, and proximity to lane markings.
    *   'Object Being Manipulated': Focuses on features related to contact points, relative motion between objects, and grip/handle features.

3.  **Role Inference Engine:**
    *   Given a detected object and its temporal feature buffer, calculate a ‘role score’ for each profile in the Role Definition Database. This is done by correlating the observed temporal feature data with the weighted feature expectations of each profile. The correlation can be a simple cosine similarity or a more complex metric.
    *   Assign the object the role with the highest score.
    *   Implement a threshold – if no role achieves a sufficiently high score, the object is assigned a default ‘unidentified’ role.

4.  **Dynamic Feature Blending:**
    *   Once a role is assigned, blend the current class-agnostic features with the weighted feature expectations of that role. This is done by creating a new feature vector that is a weighted average of the original features and the role-specific features.
    *   The weighting can be adjusted dynamically based on the confidence of the role assignment. Higher confidence = greater emphasis on role-specific features.

5.  **Anticipatory Module:**
    *   Use the assigned role and historical data to predict the object’s future actions. For example, if a vehicle is assigned the ‘Vehicle Approaching Intersection’ role, the anticipatory module can predict whether it will turn left, turn right, or continue straight.
    *   These predictions can be used to adjust the feature blending weights and/or to trigger alerts.

**Pseudocode (Role Inference):**

```
function infer_role(object, temporal_features, role_database):
  role_scores = {}
  for role in role_database:
    role_scores[role] = calculate_correlation(temporal_features, role.feature_expectations)

  best_role = max(role_scores, key=role_scores.get)

  if role_scores[best_role] > threshold:
    return best_role
  else:
    return "unidentified"

function calculate_correlation(features, expectations):
  # Implement a correlation metric (e.g., cosine similarity)
  # Return a score indicating the degree of match
  pass
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   The Role Definition Database will be a critical component. Requires careful curation and potentially the use of machine learning to automatically learn new roles.
*   The correlation metric should be robust to noise and variations in lighting and viewpoint.
*   Consider using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the temporal evolution of features.
*   This system could be used in applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and surveillance.
