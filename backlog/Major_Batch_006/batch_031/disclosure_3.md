## Context-Aware Haptic Notification Shaping

**Concept:** Expand the notification system to utilize localized, dynamic haptic feedback patterns on a device’s surface, correlated to the content *within* the incoming communication. Instead of a simple vibration, the shape and intensity of the haptic feedback directly represents aspects of the message.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Engine:** Requires a high-density, programmable haptic actuator array covering a significant portion of the device’s rear or side surfaces. Think beyond simple buzzers; this needs nuanced control over localized pressure/texture changes.
*   **Content Analysis Module:** A system component that analyzes incoming communication (text, images, audio, video). It identifies key elements for haptic mapping.
    *   *Text:* Emotion analysis (positive, negative, neutral).  Length of message.  Presence of keywords.
    *   *Images:* Object recognition (identifying recognizable shapes). Color dominance.  Complexity of the image.
    *   *Audio:* Pitch, frequency, intensity.  Speech recognition to identify keywords.
    *   *Video:* Motion vectors, dominant colors, identified objects.
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** Translates analyzed content into haptic patterns.
    *   *Emotion:* Positive = expanding, gentle ripple. Negative = contracting, sharp pulse. Neutral = steady, low-frequency hum.
    *   *Message Length:* Longer messages = wider, more complex haptic pattern. Shorter messages = concentrated, simple pulse.
    *   *Object Recognition:* Basic shapes (circle, square, triangle) are represented by corresponding haptic forms. Complex objects could utilize texture variations.
    *   *Audio/Video:*  Real-time translation of dominant frequencies/motion into haptic waveforms.
*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to define their own haptic mappings for specific contacts or communication types. Preset ‘themes’ are also provided.
*   **Integration with Overlay Interface:** When the user interacts with the notification (long press, swipe), the haptic feedback seamlessly transitions to the overlay interface, providing a continuous sensory experience.
*   **Example Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(communication) {
  analysisResult = analyzeCommunication(communication)

  pattern = new HapticPattern()

  if (analysisResult.emotion == "positive") {
    pattern.shape = "expandingRipple"
    pattern.intensity = 0.5
  } else if (analysisResult.emotion == "negative") {
    pattern.shape = "sharpPulse"
    pattern.intensity = 0.8
  } else {
    pattern.shape = "steadyHum"
    pattern.intensity = 0.3
  }

  pattern.duration = communication.length * 0.05 // Scale duration to message length

  if (analysisResult.objects.length > 0) {
    pattern.texture = mapObjectToTexture(analysisResult.objects[0]) //map first object
  }

  return pattern
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced communication awareness without visual or auditory distraction.
*   Improved accessibility for visually/auditorily impaired users.
*   A more engaging and intuitive user experience.
*   Differentiated communication handling. (Critical alerts vs. routine updates)
*   Tactile encryption - unique haptic 'signatures' for verified contacts.
