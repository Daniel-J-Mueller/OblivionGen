## Decentralized Attestation with Ephemeral Credentials

**System Overview:** A system for secure, auditable data exchange leveraging a distributed ledger and dynamically generated, time-limited credentials. This builds on the core concept of mediating access to third-party services but shifts away from centralized control and persistent credential storage.

**Core Components:**

*   **Attestation Service (AS):** A distributed network (e.g., blockchain, DAG) responsible for recording attestations.
*   **Credential Generator (CG):**  A service that generates short-lived, cryptographically signed credentials.
*   **Requestor Service (RS):**  The initial service initiating a request for data.
*   **Provider Service (PS):** The third-party service possessing the requested data.

**Data Structures:**

*   **Attestation Record:** `{attestation_id: UUID, subject: entity_id, predicate: claim_type, object: claim_value, issuer: issuer_id, timestamp: ISO8601, signature: digital_signature}`
*   **Ephemeral Credential:** `{credential_id: UUID, subject: entity_id, scope: resource_identifier, validity_start: ISO8601, validity_end: ISO8601, signature: digital_signature}`

**Workflow:**

1.  **Request Initiation:** The RS needs data from the PS. It constructs a request containing the desired data, a request identifier, and the identity of the RS.
2.  **Credential Request:** The RS contacts the CG, requesting an ephemeral credential for accessing the PS.  The request includes the scope (specific resource on PS), a desired validity period, and proof of RS identity.
3.  **Credential Generation:** The CG verifies the RS identity, generates a unique credential ID, defines the scope and validity period, and signs the credential using a private key.  The credential is returned to the RS.
4.  **Attestation Creation:** The RS creates an attestation record stating “RS is authorized to request data from PS,” including the credential ID as supporting evidence, and publishes it to the Attestation Service.
5.  **Request Forwarding:** The RS forwards the request (including the ephemeral credential) to the PS.
6.  **Credential Verification & Attestation Lookup:**  The PS receives the request and verifies the signature on the ephemeral credential using the CG’s public key. It *then* queries the Attestation Service using the credential ID to confirm the attestation’s existence and validity.  If the attestation is valid and confirms authorization, the PS proceeds.
7.  **Data Provision & Logging:** The PS provides the requested data to the RS.  The PS logs the transaction, linking it to the attestation ID for auditability.

**Pseudocode (PS - Provider Service – Verification):**

```pseudocode
function verifyRequest(request):
  credential = request.credential
  attestationID = request.attestationID

  // Verify Credential Signature
  if !verifySignature(credential, CG_Public_Key):
    return ERROR_INVALID_CREDENTIAL

  // Query Attestation Service
  attestation = AttestationService.getAttestation(attestationID)

  if attestation == null:
    return ERROR_INVALID_ATTESTATION

  if !attestation.isValid():
    return ERROR_ATTESTATION_EXPIRED

  // Check attestation subject and scope match request
  if attestation.subject != request.requestorID or attestation.scope != request.resource:
      return ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_PRIVILEGES

  return SUCCESS
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Decentralized Trust:**  Eliminates reliance on a single authority for authorization. Trust is distributed across the Attestation Service network.
*   **Ephemeral Credentials:** Minimizes the attack surface by using short-lived credentials, reducing the impact of credential compromise.
*   **Auditable History:** The Attestation Service provides a tamper-proof audit trail of all authorization decisions.
*   **Dynamic Authorization:** Allows for fine-grained, time-bound access control.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with existing identity management systems.
*   Support for different attestation schemes and cryptographic algorithms.
*   Implementation of a reputation system for CGs and RSs.
*   Utilize zero-knowledge proofs to minimize data exposure.
