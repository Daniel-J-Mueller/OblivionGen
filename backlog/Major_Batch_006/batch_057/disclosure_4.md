## Immersive Haptic Feedback System for Virtual Product Interaction

**System Overview:**

This system extends the immersive view concept by integrating localized haptic feedback directly into the display surface. The goal is to allow users to ‘feel’ the texture, shape, and weight of virtual products presented within the immersive view. This is achieved through a micro-actuator array embedded beneath the display surface, dynamically altering surface texture and applying localized pressure.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **High-Resolution Display:** A standard high-resolution display panel (OLED or MicroLED preferred) forming the visual interface.
*   **Micro-Actuator Array:** A dense array of miniature piezoelectric or electromagnetic actuators positioned directly beneath the display surface. Each actuator is individually addressable. Resolution: minimum 100 actuators per square inch. Range of motion: 0.5mm.
*   **Force Sensing Layer:** A transparent force-sensing layer integrated *above* the display surface. This layer detects the user's touch and the applied pressure, providing input for the haptic feedback system. Resolution: matches force sensing layer
*   **Processing Unit:** A dedicated processing unit responsible for controlling the micro-actuator array, processing input from the force sensing layer, and coordinating with the immersive view rendering engine.
*   **Depth Sensor:** A small depth sensor (e.g., time-of-flight) to track hand proximity and position, enhancing the accuracy of localized haptic feedback.

**Software Components:**

*   **Haptic Rendering Engine:** A software module that translates the 3D model of the virtual product into a corresponding set of actuator commands. This involves defining the desired texture, shape, and weight characteristics.
*   **Collision Detection Module:** Detects collisions between the user’s hand (tracked by the depth sensor and force sensing layer) and the virtual product, triggering localized haptic feedback.
*   **Dynamic Texture Generation:** Algorithms capable of generating realistic textures on-the-fly based on the product's material properties.
*   **Immersive View Integration:** Seamless integration with the existing immersive view rendering engine to synchronize visual and haptic feedback.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
InitializeDisplay()
InitializeActuatorArray()
InitializeForceSensor()
InitializeDepthSensor()

//Main Loop
while (true) {
    //Get User Input
    handPosition = GetHandPositionFromDepthSensor()
    touchPressure = GetTouchPressureFromForceSensor()

    //Determine if user is interacting with product
    if (IsHandNearProduct(handPosition)) {
        //Get Product Surface Data
        surfaceNormal = GetSurfaceNormalAtPosition(handPosition)
        materialProperties = GetMaterialPropertiesAtPosition(handPosition)

        //Calculate Actuator Commands
        actuatorCommands = CalculateActuatorCommands(surfaceNormal, materialProperties, touchPressure)

        //Send Commands to Actuator Array
        SendActuatorCommands(actuatorCommands)
    } else {
        //Return Actuators to Flat State
        SendActuatorCommands(FlatState)
    }

    //Render Immersive View with updated Product State
    RenderImmersiveView()
}
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Localized Dynamic Textures:** The system dynamically generates and renders realistic textures on the display surface using the micro-actuator array, allowing users to ‘feel’ different materials (e.g., fabric, wood, metal).
*   **Real-time Haptic Rendering:** The system renders haptic feedback in real-time, responding to user interaction and providing a seamless and immersive experience.
*   **Integration with Immersive Views:** The system integrates seamlessly with existing immersive view technologies, enhancing the realism and engagement of virtual product interactions.
*   **Variable Resistance & Compliance:** The actuator array can simulate varying degrees of resistance and compliance, allowing users to ‘feel’ the stiffness or softness of virtual products.
