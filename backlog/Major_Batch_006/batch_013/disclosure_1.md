## Adaptive Notification Zones & Predictive Handoff

**Concept:** Expand the notification system to incorporate dynamic, user-defined “zones” within a physical space and proactively handoff notifications between devices based on predicted user movement *before* a timeout occurs. This moves beyond simple device sequencing to anticipate user location.

**Specifications:**

**1. Zone Definition & Mapping:**

*   **User Interface:** A mobile app (or integrated system UI) allows users to define zones within their homes/offices (e.g., "Living Room," "Kitchen," "Home Office"). Zones are defined using a drag-and-drop interface on a floorplan view (potentially generated via AR/LiDAR scanning).
*   **Zone Attributes:** Each zone has configurable attributes:
    *   *Notification Priority*:  High, Medium, Low (influences notification behavior – see #3).
    *   *Device Preference*: Allows association of specific devices within the zone to receive initial notifications (e.g., kitchen notifications always go to the kitchen smart speaker first).  Overrides global preferences.
    *   *Occupancy Detection*: Option to link zone notifications to occupancy detection (e.g., only notify if motion is detected within the zone).
*   **Zone Mapping Data:** Zone definitions are stored as geo-fenced areas (coordinates) associated with the user profile and synchronized across devices.

**2. Predictive Movement Analysis:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   *Device Location Data*: Continuously collect location data from all associated devices (Bluetooth beacons, WiFi triangulation, GPS when available).
    *   *Motion Sensor Data*: Utilize motion sensor data from all devices to identify movement patterns.
    *   *Historical Data*: Track user movement history within the defined zones.
*   **Algorithm:** Implement a Kalman filter or similar predictive algorithm to forecast user location and movement trajectory. The algorithm will:
    *   Estimate current user location based on available data.
    *   Predict future location within a defined time window (e.g., 30 seconds).
    *   Calculate probability scores for user presence within each defined zone.

**3. Adaptive Notification Routing:**

*   **Initial Notification:** When a communication request arrives:
    *   Determine the zone with the highest probability of user presence based on predictive analysis.
    *   Send the initial notification to the preferred device within that zone (as defined in Zone Attributes).
    *   If no zone has a high probability score, default to global device preferences.
*   **Proactive Handoff:**  *Before* the initial notification timeout:
    *   Continuously monitor predicted user movement.
    *   If the algorithm predicts the user will move into a different zone *before* the timeout, proactively send a duplicate notification to the preferred device in the *new* predicted zone.
    *   Adjust the timing of the duplicate notification to ensure it arrives shortly after the user enters the new zone.
*   **Notification Cancellation:**  If the user interacts with the initial notification (accepts/rejects call, views message), all pending duplicate notifications are canceled.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Handoff Logic):**

```
function handleIncomingRequest(request):
  user = getUserProfile()
  zones = user.getZones()
  predictedZone = predictUserZone(zones)  // Uses predictive algorithm
  initialDevice = predictedZone.getPreferredDevice()
  sendNotification(request, initialDevice)

  //Background Task:
  while (notificationTimeoutNotReached):
    newPredictedZone = predictUserZone(zones)
    if (newPredictedZone != predictedZone):
      newDevice = newPredictedZone.getPreferredDevice()
      sendNotification(request, newDevice, delay=2seconds) // Send delayed notification
      predictedZone = newPredictedZone
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing device infrastructure (smartphones, smart speakers, etc.).
*   Bluetooth beacon support (optional, for more accurate location tracking).
*   Motion sensors on associated devices.

**Software Requirements:**

*   User-facing mobile app for zone definition and configuration.
*   Central server for data processing, predictive analysis, and notification routing.
*   SDK integration for associated devices.
