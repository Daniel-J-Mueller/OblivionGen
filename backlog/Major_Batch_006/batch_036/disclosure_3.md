## Adaptive Target Geometry for Dynamic 3D Sensor Calibration

**Concept:** Extend the static target array used in the provided patent to a dynamically reconfigurable target surface, allowing for more comprehensive and nuanced 3D sensor calibration *during* operation, rather than relying on a fixed, pre-validated setup. This allows for in-situ calibration and potentially compensates for sensor drift or environmental factors.

**Specs:**

*   **Target Surface:** A modular array of individually addressable, miniature actuators (e.g., MEMS mirrors, tilting micro-prisms, or small linear actuators driving patterned surfaces). The array should be large enough to fill the sensor's Field of View (FOV) at various distances.
*   **Actuator Resolution:**  Actuators must be capable of precise angular or linear displacement (sub-millimeter accuracy preferred) to create variable surface normals.  Resolution will dictate the fidelity of generated test patterns.
*   **Surface Material:**  A highly reflective, diffuse material coating the actuator surface to maximize signal return to the 3D sensor. The material must be durable and maintain reflectivity under repetitive actuation.
*   **Control System:** A real-time controller to orchestrate the position of each actuator, generating dynamic patterns.  The controller needs a high update rate to support continuous calibration.  API access for external software integration for custom pattern generation.
*   **Pattern Generation Algorithms:**
    *   **Spherical Calibration:** Generate a series of spherical surfaces at varying radii and positions to assess depth accuracy and distortion.
    *   **Planar Calibration:** Generate a series of planar surfaces at different angles and distances to assess planar accuracy and tilt compensation.
    *   **Feature-Based Calibration:**  Create dynamic arrangements of high-contrast features (lines, edges, corners) to assess feature detection and accuracy.
    *   **Randomized Surface Generation:** Generate randomized surface configurations to assess sensor robustness and noise tolerance.
*   **Calibration Procedure:**
    1.  Sensor acquires initial data from the dynamic target surface in a known configuration.
    2.  Calibration algorithm analyzes the acquired data and estimates sensor parameters (depth scale, distortion coefficients, tilt).
    3.  Dynamic target surface reconfigures to a new pattern based on the algorithmâ€™s recommendations.
    4.  Repeat steps 2 and 3 iteratively until convergence.
*   **Data Synchronization:** High-precision time synchronization between the sensor data acquisition and the target surface actuation. Critical for accurate calibration.
*   **Mechanical Structure:** A rigid frame to maintain the mechanical stability of the target surface. Minimize vibrations and deformations.
*   **Communication Interface:**  Ethernet, USB, or wireless communication for control and data transfer.

**Pseudocode (Calibration Loop):**

```
// Initialize Sensor and Target System

loop:
    // Acquire data from 3D sensor
    sensorData = acquireSensorData()

    // Analyze sensor data and estimate calibration parameters
    calibrationParameters = estimateCalibrationParameters(sensorData)

    // Generate new target configuration based on estimated parameters
    newTargetConfiguration = generateNewTargetConfiguration(calibrationParameters)

    // Update target configuration
    updateTargetConfiguration(newTargetConfiguration)

    // Check for convergence
    if (calibrationParametersConverged(calibrationParameters)):
        break

    // Delay for stability (optional)
    delay(0.1 seconds)
