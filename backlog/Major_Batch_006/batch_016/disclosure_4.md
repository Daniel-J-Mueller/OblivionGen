*   **Steering System:** MEMS-based micro-mirror array capable of individual control of each micro-lensâ€™s illumination point. Angular resolution: 0.1 degrees. Sweep rate: up to 10 kHz.
*   **Synchronization Controller:** FPGA-based controller responsible for:
    *   Precise synchronization of laser pulses with rolling shutter timings of each individual sensor.
    *   Dynamic allocation of illumination patterns to each micro-lens.
    *   Real-time data acquisition and pre-processing.
*   **Data Storage/Transmission:** High-bandwidth interface (e.g., PCIe Gen4) for real-time data transfer to external processing unit.
*   **Power Requirements:** 24V DC, 5A peak.

**Innovation Description:**

This system moves beyond single-point or scanned structured light and creates a dynamic, spatially multiplexed illumination field.  Instead of projecting a single structured light pattern onto a scene and capturing it with a single sensor, we create an array of individual, independently controlled structured light projectors. Each micro-lens focuses a unique, time-varying structured light pattern onto a small region of the scene.  

The key is *time-division multiplexing*.  Each micro-lens activates its unique structured light pattern for a very short duration (e.g., 100 microseconds) before switching to the next pattern.  The rolling shutter sensors, read out in a raster scan fashion, capture the different illuminated regions at different times. The synchronization controller ensures that each region is illuminated *exactly* when its corresponding pixels on the sensor are being read out. This effectively creates a dense, high-resolution 3D point cloud in real-time.

The multi-wavelength capability enables material identification and enhanced contrast in challenging environments. Different wavelengths can be used to highlight specific features or materials in the scene.

**Pseudocode for Controller Operation:**

```
// Define sensor array dimensions
const int NUM_SENSORS_X = 64;
const int NUM_SENSORS_Y = 64;

// Define structured light pattern library
Array<Pattern> patternLibrary;

// Main loop
while(true) {
  for (int y = 0; y < NUM_SENSORS_Y; y++) {
    for (int x = 0; x < NUM_SENSORS_X; x++) {
      // Select a pattern from the pattern library
      Pattern currentPattern = patternLibrary[random(patternLibrary.length)];

      // Calculate steering angles for micro-mirror
      float steerX = calculateSteerX(x, y, currentPattern);
      float steerY = calculateSteerY(x, y, currentPattern);

      // Set steering angles for micro-mirror
      setMirrorAngles(x, y, steerX, steerY);

      // Trigger laser pulse
      triggerLaserPulse();

      // Calculate delay for rolling shutter synchronization
      float delay = calculateRollingShutterDelay(x, y);

      // Synchronize laser pulse with rolling shutter
      delay(delay);

      // Read sensor data
      readSensorData(x, y);

    }
  }
}
```
