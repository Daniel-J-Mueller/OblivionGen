## Dynamic Event-Based Product Bundling & "Wishlist Futures"

**Concept:** Expand the tag/hashtag association beyond simple item linking to create dynamic, context-aware product bundles *and* allow users to pre-configure bundles for future events, effectively “locking in” pricing and availability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Event Profile Creation:**

*   **Data Input:** User provides event details: type (birthday, anniversary, graduation, etc.), date (approximate is acceptable), estimated budget, attendee count, desired ambiance (keywords: "rustic," "modern," "formal," etc.), and potential gift recipient profiles (age, interests).
*   **AI-Driven Bundle Generation:** System utilizes AI to suggest initial product bundles based on event profile.  These aren’t static lists; they're probabilities weighted by various factors (historical sales, trending items, social media buzz).
*   **User Customization:**  Users can refine suggested bundles: add/remove items, specify quantities, adjust desired price ranges for individual items or the entire bundle.
*   **"Wishlist Futures" – Price & Availability Lock:** Once finalized, users can opt to "lock in" the bundle. The system monitors pricing and availability of all items. If prices *increase* before the event date, the system absorbs the cost (potentially utilizing pre-negotiated supplier agreements). If items go out of stock, the system proactively suggests similar alternatives pre-approved by the user (using image/feature similarity analysis).
*   **Bundle Sharing & Collaboration:** Allow users to share event profiles/bundles with collaborators (family/friends) for joint planning and gifting.

**2. Dynamic Bundle Adjustment (Real-time):**

*   **Triggered by External Data:** Integrate with external data sources (weather forecasts, traffic conditions, social media trends) to dynamically adjust bundle recommendations. For example:
    *   Rainy day predicted for an outdoor party? Suggest umbrellas, ponchos, or covered event space rentals.
    *   Trending theme on social media?  Suggest related decorations or party favors.
*   **Inventory-Driven Adjustments:** If an item in a locked-in bundle is nearing out-of-stock status *before* the event, proactively offer pre-approved alternative choices to the user.  Priority given to items with similar aesthetic/functional characteristics.
*   **Real-time Pricing Updates:** Continuously monitor pricing. If the total bundle cost increases *despite* price lock efforts (e.g., supplier-side issues), notify the user and present options: accept a slight price increase, remove a non-essential item, or explore alternative solutions.

**3. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
Class EventProfile:
    event_type: String
    event_date: Date
    budget: Float
    attendee_count: Integer
    ambiance_keywords: List<String>
    recipient_profiles: List<RecipientProfile>

Class RecipientProfile:
    age: Integer
    interests: List<String>

Class Bundle:
    items: List<Item>
    total_cost: Float
    price_locked: Boolean
    availability_guaranteed: Boolean

Function GenerateBundle(event_profile: EventProfile): Bundle
    // AI-driven recommendation engine analyzes event profile
    // and generates initial bundle based on historical data,
    // trending items, and recipient profiles.
    bundle = AI_Recommendation_Engine.Recommend(event_profile)
    return bundle

Function LockBundle(bundle: Bundle, event_date: Date): Bundle
    bundle.price_locked = True
    bundle.availability_guaranteed = True
    // Initiate background monitoring of item prices and availability
    MonitorBundle(bundle, event_date)
    return bundle

Function MonitorBundle(bundle: Bundle, event_date: Date):
    // Continuously check prices and availability
    while (CurrentDate < event_date):
        For each item in bundle:
            CheckPrice(item)
            CheckAvailability(item)
        Sleep(1 hour) // Check periodically

Function CheckPrice(item):
    If item.current_price > item.original_price:
        // Trigger notification and explore solutions
        ...

Function CheckAvailability(item):
    If item.quantity < 1:
        // Trigger notification and explore alternatives
        ...
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Event Profiles (JSON)
*   Bundles (JSON)
*   Item Metadata (Database)
*   Price History (Time-series Database)
*   Availability Data (Real-time API integration with suppliers)

This system goes beyond simply tagging items; it proactively manages event planning and gifting, offering a superior user experience and creating opportunities for increased sales and customer loyalty.
