## Authentication Information ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Compromise

**Concept:** Extend the compromised authentication information clearinghouse to proactively ‘shadow’ user activity *before* compromise is confirmed, using behavioral biometrics and a predictive risk engine to identify accounts likely to be targeted, and then preemptively trigger enhanced security measures or even temporary account restrictions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Data Collection:**

*   **Data Points:** Capture a wide array of behavioral data, including:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, error rate)
    *   Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns)
    *   Scrolling behavior
    *   Device orientation (if applicable)
    *   Application usage patterns (time spent in each app, order of apps used)
    *   Network traffic patterns (typical websites visited, data transfer volumes)
*   **Collection Method:** Implement a lightweight agent or browser extension for data collection. Prioritize privacy – data should be anonymized/pseudonymized and stored securely.  Employ federated learning techniques to minimize data transfer and maximize privacy.
*   **Data Normalization:** Implement a normalization pipeline to account for variations in hardware, operating systems, and user habits.

**2. Predictive Risk Engine:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to predict the likelihood of account compromise based on behavioral biometric data, historical compromise data (from the clearinghouse), threat intelligence feeds (e.g., known phishing domains, malware signatures), and user profile information.
*   **Risk Scoring:** Assign a risk score to each account based on the model’s output.  The score should be continuously updated as new data becomes available.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify deviations from a user’s baseline behavioral profile.  Significant anomalies should trigger an increase in the risk score.
*   **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Regularly update the model with the latest threat intelligence to account for emerging threats and attack vectors.

**3. Proactive Security Measures:**

*   **Tiered Response System:** Define a tiered response system based on the risk score:
    *   **Low Risk:** No action required. Continue monitoring.
    *   **Medium Risk:** Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) if not already enabled. Display a warning message to the user encouraging them to review their account security.
    *   **High Risk:** Temporarily restrict account access (e.g., require password reset, limit transaction amounts, block access from unfamiliar devices). Initiate a security review.
*   **Adaptive Authentication:** Dynamically adjust the authentication requirements based on the risk score and user behavior. For example, if a user attempts to log in from a new location after a period of inactivity, require a more stringent authentication method (e.g., biometric verification).
*   **‘Shadow’ Account Activity Monitoring**: When a high risk account is identified, begin passively monitoring account activity (e.g. changes to profile information, new payment methods) *before* any actual compromise is confirmed, creating a ‘shadow’ audit trail.

**4. Clearinghouse Integration:**

*   **Proactive Data Sharing:**  Share risk scores and anomaly detection results with the compromised authentication information clearinghouse.  This will help to identify emerging threats and improve the accuracy of the clearinghouse’s compromise detection algorithms.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate feedback from the clearinghouse into the predictive risk engine. For example, if an account flagged as high risk is subsequently confirmed as compromised, use this information to refine the model’s training data and improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Risk Engine Update):**

```
function updateRiskScore(accountId, biometricData, historicalData, threatData):
  // Calculate behavioral score based on biometricData
  behavioralScore = calculateBehavioralScore(biometricData)

  // Calculate historical risk score based on historicalData
  historicalRiskScore = calculateHistoricalRiskScore(historicalData)

  // Calculate threat score based on threatData
  threatScore = calculateThreatScore(threatData)

  // Combine scores with weighted averages
  riskScore = (0.5 * behavioralScore) + (0.3 * historicalRiskScore) + (0.2 * threatScore)

  // Update account risk profile
  updateAccountProfile(accountId, riskScore)

  return riskScore
```
