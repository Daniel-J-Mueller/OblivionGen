## Temporal-Spatial Prediction & Prefetching for Dynamic Content

**Concept:** Extend the caching logic to proactively prefetch content not just based on *when* it's likely to be requested (time), but also *where* based on predicted user movement and content relevance. This moves beyond simple temporal preloading to a dynamic, location-aware system.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   CDN Request Logs: Historical data of content requests, timestamps, and client locations (IP address geolocation, or more precise location data if available and consented to).
    *   Mobility Data (Optional): Anonymized and aggregated mobility patterns from external sources (e.g., traffic data, public transport schedules) to predict population density and movement.  Strict privacy controls are mandatory.
    *   Content Metadata: Tags associated with content indicating its relevance to specific locations (e.g., local news, event listings, business directories).

*   **Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Movement Prediction Model:** A time-series model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained on historical location data to predict future user movement patterns. Output: Probability distribution of user location at a given time.
    *   **Content Relevance Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., collaborative filtering, content-based filtering) that predicts the likelihood of a user requesting specific content based on their location and historical behavior.
    *   **Combined Prediction:**  The output of the movement and content relevance models is combined to create a "prefetch score" for each content item, for each potential client location, at a given time.

*   **Prefetching Logic:**
    *   **Cache Prioritization:** Cache components are prioritized based on the prefetch score.  Higher scores result in more aggressive prefetching.
    *   **Dynamic Allocation:**  Cache space is dynamically allocated to content with the highest prefetch scores.
    *   **Multi-Tier Prefetching:** Implement a tiered prefetching strategy.  High-scoring content is preloaded into edge caches.  Medium-scoring content is preloaded into regional caches. Low-scoring content remains on origin servers.
    *   **Adaptive Refresh:**  Prefetched content is refreshed based on the rate of change (e.g., news updates, event schedules).

*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **Prediction Service:** A dedicated service responsible for running the prediction models and generating prefetch scores.
    *   **Control Plane:** A central control plane that manages the prefetching process, allocates cache space, and monitors performance.
    *   **Data Plane:** The CDN infrastructure itself, responsible for serving content to clients.

**Pseudocode (Control Plane):**

```
// Main Loop (Run periodically)

FOR EACH CDN Cache Component:
    Fetch Predicted User Locations & Content Requests (from Prediction Service)
    Calculate Prefetch Score FOR EACH Content Item
    Prioritize Content for Prefetching (Based on Prefetch Score)
    Allocate Cache Space (Dynamically)
    Initiate Prefetch Requests

//Prediction Service
FUNCTION CalculatePrefetchScore(user_location, content_item):
    movement_probability = GetMovementProbability(user_location)
    content_relevance = GetContentRelevance(content_item, user_location)
    prefetch_score = movement_probability * content_relevance
    RETURN prefetch_score
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Prefetching:** Incorporate individual user preferences and behavior into the prediction models.
*   **Real-time Event Detection:**  Detect real-time events (e.g., traffic incidents, breaking news) and proactively prefetch relevant content.
*   **Edge Computing Integration:**  Run the prediction models on edge servers to reduce latency and improve responsiveness.
