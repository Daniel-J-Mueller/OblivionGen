## Dynamic Glyph Weighting for Contextual Error Detection

**Concept:** Expand upon the error detection based on language models by introducing *dynamic glyph weighting*. Instead of treating all glyphs within a group equally when calculating a score, assign weights to each glyph based on its visual distinctiveness and expected frequency in the language. This allows for more nuanced error detection, particularly with visually similar characters (e.g., 'o' vs. '0', 'l' vs. '1').

**Specifications:**

1.  **Glyph Distinctiveness Metric:**
    *   Develop an algorithm to quantify the visual distinctiveness of each glyph. This could leverage:
        *   **Feature Extraction:** Extract visual features (e.g., edge density, curvature, enclosed space) from glyph images.
        *   **Comparative Analysis:** Compare feature vectors across all glyphs.  Glyphs with feature vectors furthest from others are considered more distinct.
        *   **Output:**  A distinctiveness score (0.0 to 1.0) for each glyph. 1.0 indicating highest distinctiveness.

2.  **Glyph Frequency Database:**
    *   Create a database mapping each glyph to its expected frequency in the target language(s). This could be derived from large text corpora. Store frequency as a probability (0.0 to 1.0).

3.  **Dynamic Weight Calculation:**
    *   For each glyph within a group, calculate a dynamic weight using the following formula:

    `Weight = DistinctivenessScore * FrequencyProbability`

4.  **Weighted Scoring:**
    *   Modify the existing score calculation to incorporate the dynamic weights. The original score considered only whether a word was spelled correctly. Now:
        *   For each glyph in a group, calculate a confidence score based on the language model’s assessment of the word it contributes to.
        *   Multiply the confidence score by the glyph’s dynamic weight.
        *   Sum the weighted confidence scores for all glyphs in the group.
        *   Normalize the sum to obtain the final group score.

5.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   **Data Structures:** Utilize efficient data structures (e.g., hash tables) for storing glyph features, frequencies, and weights.
    *   **Parallel Processing:**  Parallelize the feature extraction, weight calculation, and scoring processes to improve performance.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:**  Implement a mechanism for the system to learn and adapt the glyph frequencies and distinctiveness scores over time, based on observed data.

**Pseudocode (Scoring Function):**

```
function calculateGroupScore(groupOfGlyphs, languageModel, glyphFeatures, glyphFrequencies):
  totalWeightedScore = 0
  for each glyph in groupOfGlyphs:
    confidenceScore = languageModel.checkWordSpelling(glyph.word) // Return 0-1
    distinctivenessScore = glyphFeatures.getDistinctivenessScore(glyph.glyphID)
    frequencyProbability = glyphFrequencies.getFrequencyProbability(glyph.glyphID)
    dynamicWeight = distinctivenessScore * frequencyProbability
    weightedScore = confidenceScore * dynamicWeight
    totalWeightedScore += weightedScore

  normalizedScore = totalWeightedScore / numberOfGlyphsInGroup
  return normalizedScore
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved error detection accuracy, particularly for visually similar glyphs.
*   More robust performance in noisy environments.
*   Adaptability to different languages and character sets.
*   More accurate correction suggestions.
