## Dynamic Gait-Based Emotional State Detection & Personalized Environment Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend gait analysis beyond identity verification to infer emotional state, then dynamically adjust the surrounding environment (lighting, music, temperature) to optimize user experience and potentially mitigate negative emotional states.

**Specs:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Camera System:** Array of depth-sensing cameras (Intel RealSense, Azure Kinect) positioned to capture full-body gait data from multiple angles.  Minimum 3 cameras, optimally 6 for robust 3D reconstruction.
*   **Environmental Control System:** Networked system controlling:
    *   Smart Lighting: RGBW LEDs capable of dynamic color and intensity adjustments.
    *   Audio System: Multi-speaker array for spatial audio and personalized music/soundscapes.
    *   HVAC Interface: Control over temperature and airflow.
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** High-performance embedded system (NVIDIA Jetson, Google Coral) for real-time data processing and control.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Gait Feature Extraction Module:**
    *   Skeleton Tracking: Utilize pose estimation algorithms (OpenPose, MediaPipe) to track key skeletal joints during gait.
    *   Feature Calculation:  Derive features from skeletal data:
        *   Stride Length: Distance between successive heel strikes.
        *   Step Frequency: Number of steps per unit time.
        *   Joint Angle Variability: Standard deviation of joint angles during gait cycle.
        *   Posture:  Spinal curvature, head position.
        *   Arm Swing: Amplitude and frequency of arm movements.
        *   Cadence: Steps per minute.
    *   Data Smoothing: Apply Kalman filtering or similar techniques to reduce noise and improve accuracy.

*   **Emotional State Inference Module:**
    *   Machine Learning Model: Train a supervised learning model (Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Neural Network) to map gait features to emotional states (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, anxiety).  Data must be labelled; this is a significant undertaking.
    *   Feature Selection: Use feature importance analysis to identify the most relevant gait features for emotional state classification.
    *   Model Calibration: Continuously calibrate the model using user feedback and physiological data (e.g., heart rate, skin conductance – optional integration).

*   **Environment Adjustment Module:**
    *   Rule-Based System: Define rules that map inferred emotional states to specific environmental adjustments. (Example: If sadness is detected, increase lighting brightness, play upbeat music, slightly increase temperature).
    *   Personalization Profiles: Allow users to customize the mapping between emotional states and environmental adjustments.  User preference overrides default rules.
    *   Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm: Implement an algorithm that smoothly adjusts the environment over time, avoiding abrupt changes that could be jarring.
    *   Real-time Adjustment: Continuously monitor gait data and adjust the environment in real-time based on the inferred emotional state.

*   **Data Logging & Privacy:**
    *   Anonymized Data Storage: Store gait data and environmental adjustment logs in an anonymized and secure manner.
    *   User Consent: Obtain explicit user consent before collecting and using gait data.
    *   Data Deletion Policy: Implement a clear data deletion policy that allows users to request the deletion of their data.

**III. Pseudocode - Real-Time Adjustment Loop:**

```
LOOP:
    1. Capture image data from multi-camera system
    2. Extract gait features (Stride Length, Step Frequency, Joint Angle Variability, etc.)
    3. Infer emotional state using trained ML model
    4. Determine appropriate environmental adjustments based on inferred emotional state and user preferences
    5. Send commands to environmental control system to adjust lighting, music, temperature
    6. Repeat from step 1
END LOOP
```

**IV. Novelty:**  While gait analysis is used for identification, this extends the technology to infer *internal* emotional states based on subtle changes in movement patterns and then *actively manipulate* the environment to affect the user’s well-being. This is a closed-loop system that goes beyond passive observation.
