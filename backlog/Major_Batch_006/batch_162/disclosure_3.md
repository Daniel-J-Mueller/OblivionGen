## Personalized "Deep Dive" Content Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *ranking* existing text portions to *generating* new, highly personalized content snippets tailored to a user’s demonstrated understanding and interests, using the existing patent's core principles. This goes beyond highlighting; it *creates* content.

**Specs:**

**1. Knowledge Graph Integration:**

*   **Data Source:** The system integrates with a broad knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, ConceptNet) to map entities (people, places, concepts) identified in the input text.
*   **User Profile:** A user profile is constructed, capturing:
    *   Explicitly stated interests (user-defined tags, topics).
    *   Implicit interests (derived from annotated text, browsing history, social media activity).
    *   Knowledge Level:  A dynamically updated assessment of the user’s familiarity with various concepts (using techniques like spaced repetition).

**2. "Understanding Gap" Detection:**

*   **Content Analysis:** When a user accesses a new document, the system analyzes its core concepts (using the knowledge graph).
*   **Gap Identification:** It identifies concepts within the document where the user’s knowledge level is below a threshold (based on their profile).

**3. Personalized Snippet Generation:**

*   **Content Source:** Access a diverse range of information sources: Wikipedia, academic papers, news articles, curated educational materials.
*   **Snippet Generation Engine:**
    *   Utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned on educational content.
    *   Prompt the LLM with the identified "understanding gap" and the context of the current document.
    *   Request the LLM to generate a concise, personalized explanation of the concept, tailored to the user's knowledge level and expressed in a style consistent with the original document.
*   **Snippet Length Control:** Allow users to specify their preferred snippet length (e.g., "short," "medium," "detailed").
*   **Multiple Snippets:** Generate multiple snippet options, allowing the user to choose the most helpful one.

**4. Dynamic Integration & Interface:**

*   **Inline Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the generated snippets directly into the original document.  Snippets appear as expandable tooltips or popovers.
*   **Snippet "Feed":** Provide a dedicated "feed" of personalized snippets related to the user's current reading or browsing activity.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Track user engagement with snippets (e.g., whether they expand them, read them, mark them as helpful). Use this data to refine the snippet generation process and improve personalization.
*   **Multi-Modal Snippets:** Extend beyond text to include images, diagrams, and short videos.

**Pseudocode (Snippet Generation Engine):**

```
function generateSnippet(documentContext, understandingGap, userProfile):
  knowledgeLevel = userProfile.getKnowledgeLevel(understandingGap)
  prompt = "Explain " + understandingGap + " in a way that is understandable for someone with a knowledge level of " + knowledgeLevel + ".  Maintain a style similar to the following text: " + documentContext
  snippet = LLM.generateText(prompt)
  return snippet
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply ranking or highlighting. It *creates* new content tailored to individual user needs *while* reading, fostering deeper understanding and engagement. It transforms passive reading into an active, personalized learning experience.
