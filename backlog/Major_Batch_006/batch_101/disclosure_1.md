## Dynamic Taxonomy Weighting Based on User Interaction

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the weighting of classifications within the hierarchical taxonomy based on real-time user interaction data.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *matching* terms to classifications. This builds on that by adding a feedback loop – the system learns which classifications are *actually* relevant to users, refining the taxonomy's importance beyond initial term matches.

**System Components:**

1.  **Interaction Tracking Module:** Monitors user actions within the interactive webpage. Key events:
    *   **Navigation:** Tracks which classifications users browse to, and how deeply.
    *   **Search Queries:** Logs search terms used by users.
    *   **Item Selection/Purchase:** Records which items are selected/purchased after navigating through specific classifications.
    *   **"Not Relevant" Feedback:** Implementation of a simple "This classification isn't relevant" button on classification pages.
2.  **Weighting Adjustment Algorithm:** A continuously running algorithm that adjusts the weighting of each classification based on the data collected by the Interaction Tracking Module. 
    *   **Initial Weights:** Each classification starts with a base weight (e.g., 1.0).
    *   **Positive Reinforcement:** 
        *   Navigation to a classification increases its weight (small increment).
        *   Successful item selection/purchase within a classification significantly increases its weight.
        *   Positive keyword matches in search queries targeting that classification increase its weight.
    *   **Negative Reinforcement:**
        *   "Not Relevant" feedback significantly decreases a classification’s weight.
        *   Low navigation frequency decreases a classification’s weight (slow decay).
        *   Search queries that *bypass* a classification when searching for relevant items decrease its weight.
    *   **Normalization:**  Regularly normalizes all weights to ensure they remain within a defined range (e.g., 0.1 to 1.0).
3.  **Classification Ranking Module:** Uses the dynamically adjusted weights to re-rank classifications in search results and navigation menus.  Higher-weighted classifications appear higher in the list.
4.  **Term Association Update Module:** (Optional, advanced) Periodically analyzes user interactions and re-evaluates the association between terms and classifications. If a term consistently leads users to a *different* classification than initially assigned, the term-classification association can be updated.

**Pseudocode (Weighting Adjustment Algorithm):**

```
// Global Variables
classificationWeights[classificationID] = baseWeight (e.g., 1.0)
decayRate = 0.001 // Adjust for responsiveness

// Event Triggered (User Navigates to Classification)
function onClassificationNavigation(classificationID) {
  classificationWeights[classificationID] += 0.01
}

// Event Triggered (User Purchases Item in Classification)
function onItemPurchase(classificationID) {
  classificationWeights[classificationID] += 0.1
}

// Event Triggered (User Submits "Not Relevant" Feedback)
function onNotRelevantFeedback(classificationID) {
  classificationWeights[classificationID] -= 0.2
}

// Periodic Update (Run Every X Minutes)
function updateClassificationWeights() {
  for each classificationID {
    classificationWeights[classificationID] -= decayRate // Apply decay
    // Ensure weights stay within bounds (0.1 - 1.0)
    classificationWeights[classificationID] = clamp(classificationWeights[classificationID], 0.1, 1.0)
  }
}

// Function to Clamp a Value
function clamp(value, min, max) {
  if (value < min) {
    return min
  } else if (value > max) {
    return max
  } else {
    return value
  }
}
```

**Output:** An interactive webpage where the presentation of classifications and items dynamically adapts to user behavior, improving discoverability and user engagement. The system *learns* what users are looking for, going beyond simple keyword matching.
