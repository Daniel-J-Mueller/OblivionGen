## Dynamic Data Sharding with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the existing batch processing and pipeline architecture to incorporate dynamic data sharding based on *predicted* query patterns, coupled with predictive load balancing across pipelines.  This goes beyond simply partitioning data for storage; it proactively optimizes data distribution to *anticipate* query load and minimize response times.

**Specifications:**

*   **Query Pattern Analysis Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors incoming queries (via the ‘get usage interface’ described in claim 9) to identify frequently accessed entities, services, operations, and time intervals.
    *   Employs a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future query patterns.  This isn't just historical analysis; it anticipates spikes based on daily/weekly/monthly cycles and potentially external factors (e.g., marketing campaigns).
    *   Stores predicted query patterns as weighted probabilities for each data shard.

*   **Dynamic Sharding Engine:**
    *   Utilizes the output of the Query Pattern Analysis Module to dynamically adjust data sharding.
    *   Data is *not* statically partitioned. Instead, the engine selectively replicates or moves data segments across shards based on predicted query load.  High-probability segments are duplicated for faster access, while low-probability segments are consolidated.
    *   Employs a consistent hashing algorithm to minimize data movement during re-sharding events.
    *   Introduces a ‘warm-up’ phase during re-sharding where data is pre-populated in the new configuration before switching over to minimize latency impact.

*   **Predictive Load Balancer:**
    *   Monitors the workload on each pipeline instance (as described in claim 1, 6, and 14).
    *   Based on the predicted query patterns *and* real-time pipeline load, intelligently routes incoming queries to the least-loaded pipeline instance capable of serving the requested data shard.
    *   Employs a feedback loop to adjust load balancing weights based on actual pipeline performance. This allows it to learn and adapt to changing workload patterns.
    *   Can proactively scale up/down pipeline instances based on predicted peak loads.

*   **Data Replication & Consistency:**
    *   Uses a distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure data consistency across replicas.
    *   Employs a ‘read-your-writes’ consistency model to provide strong consistency guarantees.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Load Balancing):**

```
function route_query(query):
    shard_id = determine_shard_id(query)
    available_pipelines = get_pipelines_for_shard(shard_id)
    predicted_load = predict_pipeline_load(available_pipelines) // based on query pattern & current load
    best_pipeline = select_pipeline_with_lowest_load(predicted_load)
    return best_pipeline
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `QueryPattern`: {entity_id, service_id, operation_id, time_interval, probability}
*   `PipelineState`: {pipeline_id, current_load, capacity, shard_ids}

**Novelty:** The existing patent focuses on efficient *processing* of usage data.  This extends it by proactively optimizing data *distribution* based on *predicted* query demand, effectively pre-fetching and pre-positioning data for faster access. It’s a shift from reactive to proactive optimization.
