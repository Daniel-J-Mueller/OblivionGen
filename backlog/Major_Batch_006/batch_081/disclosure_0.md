**Dynamic DNS Redirection based on Client Device Capabilities**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**

Extend the existing DNS-based request routing system to incorporate client device capabilities as a primary routing factor *in addition to* location. This allows for content and service delivery optimized not just for *where* a user is, but *how* they are accessing the network.

**II. Data Acquisition & Storage:**

1.  **Capability Probes:** Upon initial connection (or periodically), a small Javascript snippet (or similar client-side code) embedded in web pages served through the CDN will probe for device characteristics. This includes:
    *   CPU Architecture (ARM, x86, etc.)
    *   Operating System (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, Linux) + version
    *   Browser Type + version
    *   Screen Resolution & Pixel Density
    *   Supported Codecs (video & audio)
    *   Network Connection Type (WiFi, Cellular - 3G/4G/5G) & Speed (estimated).
2.  **Capability Hash:**  The collected data will be used to generate a unique "Capability Hash" – a condensed string representing the device's configuration.
3.  **CDN Capability Database:** The CDN will maintain a database mapping Capability Hashes to optimal content delivery configurations (e.g., specific image formats, video encoding profiles, JavaScript feature sets).
4.  **Ephemeral Session Data:** Store Capability Hash associated with the client’s current session (identified by a cookie or other identifier). This minimizes re-probing.

**III. DNS Resolution Process:**

1.  **Initial DNS Query:** Client sends a DNS query for a resource (e.g., `www.example.com`).
2.  **CDN Interception:** CDN intercepts the query.
3.  **Session Lookup:** CDN checks for an existing session associated with the client.
4.  **Capability Retrieval:**
    *   If session exists: Retrieve the Capability Hash from the session data.
    *   If no session exists: Initiate Capability Probe (as described in Section II).
5.  **Routing Decision:** Based on *both* the client’s location (as in the existing patent) *and* the Capability Hash, the CDN selects the optimal Point of Presence (POP) and content delivery configuration.
6.  **Alternative Resource Identifier (ARI) Generation:** CDN generates an ARI that encodes both the POP selection *and* the content delivery configuration parameters (e.g., `cdn.example.com/pop-us-west/webp/1080p/video.mp4`).
7.  **ARI Response:** CDN returns the ARI to the client.
8.  **Content Request:** Client requests content using the ARI. The CDN POP serves the appropriately configured content.

**IV.  Pseudocode (CDN DNS Server Logic):**

```
function resolveDNSQuery(dnsQuery, clientIPAddress):
  session = getClientSession(clientIPAddress)

  if session is null:
    capabilityHash = probeClientCapabilities(clientIPAddress)
    session = createClientSession(clientIPAddress, capabilityHash)

  locationId = determineLocation(clientIPAddress)
  capabilityHash = session.capabilityHash

  popId = selectOptimalPOP(locationId, capabilityHash)
  contentConfig = getContentConfig(capabilityHash)

  ari = generateARI(popId, contentConfig)

  return ari
```

**V. Scalability Considerations:**

*   **Caching:**  Aggressively cache ARI mappings based on location and common capability hashes.
*   **Distributed Database:** Use a distributed database to store the Capability-to-Content Config mappings.
*   **Asynchronous Capability Probing:** Offload capability probing to a separate, asynchronous process to minimize DNS response latency.
*   **Client-Side Caching of Capabilities:** Allow clients to cache their Capability Hash locally to reduce the frequency of probing.
