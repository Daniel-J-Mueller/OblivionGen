## Adaptive USB Port Identification & Power Delivery – ‘Chameleon Port’

**Concept:** Expanding on the idea of identifying power sources via USB data line characteristics, this system proactively *shapes* the USB port’s electrical signature to elicit a more definitive response from the connected power source, and dynamically adapts power delivery based on that interaction. It's about making the port *actively* interrogate the power supply rather than passively observing it.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microcontroller with dedicated ADC/DAC channels (integrated within existing USB controller is preferable).
    *   Digitally controllable analog switches (implemented as FETs) on both D+ and D- lines, allowing for dynamic impedance/voltage modulation.
    *   Current sensing shunt on VBUS line, high-resolution ADC.
    *   Small, isolated DC-DC converter to supply voltage modulation on D+/D- lines (required for wider impedance/voltage range).
    *   Non-volatile memory for storing ‘power source profiles’ & modulation patterns.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   **Profile Database:** A database of known power sources (chargers, hubs, computers) and their expected responses to specific modulation patterns. Initial profiles seeded during manufacture, expandable via firmware updates/user data.
    *   **Modulation Engine:** Software module generating and applying dynamic modulation signals (DC voltage levels, impedance variations – effectively creating short bursts of data-like signalling on D+/D-).
    *   **Response Analyzer:** Measures the impact of modulation on VBUS current draw & D+/D- line voltage/current, identifying 'fingerprints' unique to each power source.
    *   **Adaptive Power Delivery (APD) Algorithm:** Dynamically adjusts VBUS voltage/current based on identified power source. Supports PPS, PD3.0, QC, and legacy charging protocols, prioritizing maximum efficiency & safety.
    *   **Learning Mode:** When a new power source is connected, the system enters 'learning mode'. It systematically applies a range of modulation patterns, records the responses, and builds a profile for that power source.

**Pseudocode (APD Algorithm – Simplified):**

```
// On USB Connect
initialize_modulation_engine()
initialize_response_analyzer()

// Initial Scan
apply_initial_modulation_pattern()
read_vbus_current()
read_d_plus_minus_voltage_current()
power_source_profile = search_profile_database(readings)

if power_source_profile == null:
    enter_learning_mode()
else:
    // Apply Profile Settings
    set_vbus_voltage(power_source_profile.voltage)
    set_vbus_current(power_source_profile.current)
    apply_profile_specific_modulation(power_source_profile)

// Continuous Monitoring
while (USB connected):
    monitor_vbus_current()
    monitor_d_plus_minus_voltage_current()
    if (current deviates from profile expectations):
        trigger_adaptive_recalibration()
        update_profile_settings()
```

**Adaptive Recalibration:** This is crucial. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the modulation patterns based on ongoing VBUS readings, fine-tuning the profile for optimal charging. If the power source unexpectedly changes its output (e.g., due to load variations), the system adapts in real-time.

**Innovation:**  Instead of simply *detecting* a power source, the 'Chameleon Port' actively *probes* and *interrogates* it, building a dynamic, adaptive power profile. It goes beyond static identification to create a continuously optimized charging experience. This drastically improves the compatibility and efficiency of power delivery, especially with the increasing complexity of USB Power Delivery standards.
