## Adaptive Resolution Mapping & Semantic Tagging for Real-Time 3D Reconstruction

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple positional data during 3D reconstruction to incorporate dynamic resolution mapping based on semantic understanding of the captured environment. This allows for high-detail capture of important features while reducing data load from less critical areas, and building a navigable semantic map alongside the geometric model.

**System Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   RGB-D Camera (as in patent) – baseline for geometry and texture.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – 9-axis (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer) – for precise motion tracking.
    *   Microphone Array – for audio scene understanding.
    *   Optional: Thermal Camera – for adding thermal data to the semantic map.
*   **Processing Unit:** Edge-capable processor (e.g., Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2, Apple Silicon) – for real-time data processing.
*   **Display:** AR/VR Headset or Mobile Device Display – for visualization and user interaction.
*   **Software Components:**
    *   **Real-Time Semantic Segmentation:**  Deep learning model (e.g., Mask R-CNN, DeepLab) – running on the edge processor.  Identifies objects/surfaces within the camera view (e.g., walls, furniture, people, windows).
    *   **Adaptive Resolution Control:** Algorithm that dynamically adjusts the resolution of captured data based on semantic segmentation output.
        *   High Resolution:  Areas identified as important (e.g., faces, detailed artwork, interactive elements) are captured at maximum resolution.
        *   Medium Resolution:  Common surfaces (e.g., walls, floors) are captured at medium resolution.
        *   Low Resolution/Voxels: Areas deemed non-critical (e.g., large empty spaces, areas behind occlusions) are captured at low resolution or represented as voxels.
    *   **Spatial Audio Integration:**  Algorithm to map audio source locations to the 3D model in real-time. Useful for augmenting the semantic map.
    *   **SLAM Engine:** Modified SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm that incorporates semantic segmentation data and adaptive resolution mapping.
    *   **Semantic Map Builder:**  Module to construct a navigable semantic map of the environment.  The map stores object types, positions, relationships, and associated data (e.g., audio cues, thermal signatures).
    *   **Data Streaming/Compression:** Algorithm to efficiently stream compressed 3D data to a remote server or store it locally.
    *   **User Interface:** AR/VR interface for visualizing the 3D model, semantic map, and associated data.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Resolution Control):**

```
function processFrame(cameraFrame, semanticSegmentation):
  resolutionMap = createResolutionMap(cameraFrame.width, cameraFrame.height)

  for each pixel in semanticSegmentation:
    objectType = pixel.objectType
    if objectType == "face":
      resolutionMap[pixel.x][pixel.y] = "high"
    elif objectType == "artwork":
      resolutionMap[pixel.x][pixel.y] = "high"
    elif objectType == "wall" or objectType == "floor":
      resolutionMap[pixel.x][pixel.y] = "medium"
    else:
      resolutionMap[pixel.x][pixel.y] = "low"

  highResPixels = extractPixels(cameraFrame, resolutionMap, "high")
  mediumResPixels = extractPixels(cameraFrame, resolutionMap, "medium")
  lowResPixels = extractPixels(cameraFrame, resolutionMap, "low")

  // Encode/compress pixels based on resolution

  return encodedFrame
```

**Operational Flow:**

1.  The RGB-D camera captures a frame.
2.  The semantic segmentation model analyzes the frame and identifies objects/surfaces.
3.  The adaptive resolution control algorithm generates a resolution map based on semantic segmentation output.
4.  The RGB-D data is encoded/compressed based on the resolution map.
5.  The SLAM engine uses the encoded data and IMU data to estimate the device's pose and build a 3D map.
6.  The semantic map builder creates a navigable semantic map of the environment.
7.  The 3D model and semantic map are visualized on the display.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Robotics:**  Enabling robots to understand and interact with their environment more effectively.
*   **AR/VR:**  Creating more immersive and realistic AR/VR experiences.
*   **Digital Twins:**  Generating detailed and accurate digital twins of physical spaces.
*   **Autonomous Navigation:**  Improving the accuracy and reliability of autonomous navigation systems.
*   **Accessibility:** Creating navigable 3D maps for visually impaired individuals.
