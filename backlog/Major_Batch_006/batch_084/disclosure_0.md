## Adaptive Query Partitioning via Predictive Schema Inference

**Concept:** Enhance query performance on mixed structured/unstructured data by dynamically partitioning unstructured data *before* query execution based on predicted schema and query intent. This moves beyond simply processing partitions *during* execution (as suggested by claim 9) to proactively shaping the data landscape.

**Specifications:**

**1. Schema Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Unstructured data stream (e.g., logs), historical query patterns, optional metadata hints.
*   **Process:** Employ a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or transformer) trained on historical data to predict the likely schema of the incoming unstructured data.  This isn’t full schema discovery, but *probabilistic schema inference* – identifying the most likely fields and data types.  Confidence scores are associated with each predicted field.
*   **Output:**  Probabilistic schema (field name, predicted data type, confidence score).  The probabilistic schema is updated continuously as new data arrives.

**2. Query Intent Analyzer:**

*   **Input:**  User query.
*   **Process:** Analyze the query to identify key fields and operators. Determine the likely fields that will be used in filtering, aggregation, and sorting. Assign a relevance score to each predicted field based on query analysis.
*   **Output:** Relevance-scored list of predicted fields.

**3. Adaptive Partitioning Engine:**

*   **Input:** Probabilistic schema, relevance-scored list of predicted fields, unstructured data stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   Combine the probabilistic schema and relevance scores to create a weighted partitioning scheme. Fields with high confidence and relevance receive higher weighting.
    *   Dynamically partition the unstructured data based on the weighted scheme. This may involve creating multiple partitions based on different fields or combinations of fields.  Partitioning occurs *before* query execution.
    *   Store partition metadata (field used for partitioning, range of values within the partition) in a dedicated metadata store.
*   **Output:** Partioned unstructured data, partition metadata.

**4. Query Rewriter:**

*   **Input:** User query, partition metadata.
*   **Process:** Rewrite the query to leverage the pre-partitioned data.  This may involve:
    *   Adding predicates to the query to select only relevant partitions.
    *   Optimizing the query execution plan to read only the necessary partitions.
*   **Output:** Rewritten query.

**Pseudocode (Partitioning Engine):**

```
function partitionData(unstructuredData, probabilisticSchema, relevanceScores):
  partitionScheme = {}
  for field, confidence in probabilisticSchema.items():
    if relevanceScores.contains(field):
      weight = confidence * relevanceScores[field]
      partitionScheme[field] = weight

  sortedFields = sortKeysByValue(partitionScheme) //Sort by descending weight
  
  for field in sortedFields:
    partitionDataByField(unstructuredData, field)
    storePartitionMetadata(field, getPartitionRanges(field)) //Store min/max values of the partition key
  
  return partitionedData
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ProbabilisticSchema`:  `{field_name: (data_type, confidence_score)}`
*   `RelevanceScores`: `{field_name: relevance_score}`
*   `PartitionMetadata`: `{field_name: (min_value, max_value)}`

**Novelty:**  This approach proactively shapes the data landscape *before* query execution based on predicted schema and query intent, unlike existing techniques that reactively process partitions during execution. This minimizes I/O and improves query performance.  The combination of probabilistic schema inference and relevance-based partitioning is a key innovation.
