## Dynamic Network Topology Mapping via Encapsulation Header Analysis

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Leverage the encapsulation headers, not just for tracking metrics *within* a session, but to actively *map* and visualize the network topology in real-time. The existing patent focuses on metrics *during* transit. This builds on that by using encapsulation headers as "breadcrumbs" to chart the network path.

**II. Components:**

*   **Topology Mapper (TM):** A centralized component responsible for receiving, processing, and assembling the network topology map.
*   **Encapsulation Header Analyzer (EHA):**  Integrated within each EPPC, responsible for extracting relevant path information from encapsulation headers (TTL, intermediate router IDs if present, timestamps, sequence numbers).
*   **Data Store:** A graph database optimized for storing and querying network topology data.

**III. Operation:**

1.  **Header Enrichment:** EHAs, in addition to collecting metrics, extract path-related data from each encapsulation header as packets traverse the network.  This data is timestamped.
2.  **Data Transmission:** EHAs periodically transmit this path data (not just metrics) to the TM.  Transmission can be triggered by packet thresholds or time intervals.
3.  **Topology Construction:**  The TM uses the received path data to construct a dynamic network topology graph. The graph nodes represent network devices (routers, switches, hosts), and the edges represent the paths taken by the encapsulated packets.  Timestamps are crucial for detecting path changes (failures, rerouting).
4.  **Visualization & Alerting:**  The TM provides a real-time visualization of the network topology, allowing network operators to monitor connectivity and identify potential issues. Alerting can be triggered based on topology changes (e.g., a link going down, a path being rerouted).
5.  **Path Verification:** Using multiple EPPC pairings across the network, the TM can cross-validate path information, increasing the accuracy of the topology map.

**IV. Pseudocode (Topology Mapper - Core Loop):**

```pseudocode
// Data Structures:
//  - NetworkTopology: Graph database representing network topology
//  - PathData:  Data structure containing path information from EPPC

function process_path_data(path_data) {
  // Extract source, destination, path information from path_data

  // Update NetworkTopology graph with new path information
  //  - Add/Update nodes (devices)
  //  - Add/Update edges (paths) with timestamps and quality of service (QoS) metrics

  // Check for topology changes (e.g., new links, failed nodes)
  if (topology_changed) {
    trigger_alert(topology_change_event)
    update_visualization()
  }
}

function main_loop() {
  while (true) {
    // Receive path data from EHAs
    path_data = receive_data()

    // Process path data
    process_path_data(path_data)

    // Update visualization (periodically)
    if (time_elapsed > visualization_interval) {
      update_visualization()
    }

    // Sleep for a short period
  }
}

```

**V. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Predictive Analysis:** Use historical topology data to predict potential network issues (e.g., link congestion, impending failures).
*   **Automated Remediation:**  Automatically reroute traffic around failed links or congested paths.
*   **Security Monitoring:**  Detect unauthorized network devices or traffic patterns.
