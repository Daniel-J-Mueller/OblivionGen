## Dynamic Product Morphing Based on User Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the filtering/selection process beyond simply *displaying* products to dynamically *morphing* displayed products based on user selections. This allows for real-time visualization of how feature choices impact product appearance and potentially even function (within defined parameters).

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A 3D/Parametric Model Repository. Each product isn't just represented by images, but by a customizable 3D or parametric model. This model defines core attributes (size, shape, color, materials) and potentially interactive features.
*   **Interaction Interface:** The existing feature/price selection tools are augmented with 'morphing sliders' or direct manipulation handles on the product display itself. These controls are linked to the underlying parametric model.
*   **Morphing Engine:** A real-time rendering engine interprets user interactions with the controls and adjusts the 3D/parametric model accordingly. This results in immediate visual feedback on the product display.
*   **Defined Parameters:** Morphing isn't limitless. Each feature has a pre-defined range of adjustment to ensure physical plausibility and maintain product integrity.
*   **Functionality Simulation:** Where applicable, the morphing engine can simulate functional changes. (e.g., changing tire size on a car model updates ground clearance visualization, changing handle length on a tool alters reach simulation).
*   **'Save Configuration' Feature:** Allow users to save their customized product configurations for later review or purchase.
*   **'Share Configuration' Feature:** Enable users to share configurations with others.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Product Database:
Product[ProductID] = {
    Model: ParametricModel,
    Features: [Feature1, Feature2, ...],
    Price: BasePrice
}

// User Interaction:
FeatureSelection = UserInput() // Get selected features & values
FeatureValues = ExtractValues(FeatureSelection) // Get feature values

// Morphing:
NewModel = Model.Modify(FeatureValues) // Apply changes to the 3D model
Render(NewModel) // Display the modified model

// Price Update:
NewPrice = CalculatePrice(NewModel)
DisplayPrice(NewPrice)

// Save/Share
SaveConfiguration(NewModel)
ShareConfiguration(NewModel)
```

**Example Application (Shoes):**

The user selects 'running shoes'. Instead of seeing a list of pre-made shoes, they see a base model. They can then:

*   Adjust the sole thickness (morphing slider) - visualization of impact absorption changes
*   Change the upper material (dropdown with material previews) - visual & simulated weight change
*   Modify the color scheme (color picker) - immediate visual change
*   Alter the shoe width (morphing slider) – visual change to shoe shape

The system dynamically updates the visualization *and* the price based on these choices.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AR/VR Integration:** Allow users to ‘try on’ or experience the morphed product in a virtual or augmented reality environment.
*   **AI-Powered Recommendations:** The system could suggest morphing adjustments based on user preferences or activity data.
*    **Generative Design:** Incorporate generative design principles to explore a wider range of product configurations automatically.
