## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Monitoring for Battery Health

**Concept:** Utilize non-destructive resonant frequency analysis to assess both state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH) of individual cells within a battery pack. This moves beyond dimensional changes to directly measure internal material properties linked to degradation.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate miniature piezoelectric transducers (PZT) directly onto or very near each cell within the battery pack. These will act as both exciters and receivers of ultrasonic waves.
*   **Frequency Sweep:** A central controller will initiate a frequency sweep (e.g., 20 kHz - 1 MHz) across each PZT. The resonant frequencies of the cell’s internal materials (electrode, electrolyte, separator) will create peaks in the received signal.
*   **Resonance Mapping:** Create a “resonance map” for each cell, recording the amplitude and frequency of each resonant peak. This map will serve as a baseline for comparison.
*   **SOC Calculation:** As the battery charges/discharges, the density and stiffness of the electrode materials will change, slightly shifting the resonant frequencies. Use a pre-trained machine learning model (e.g., neural network) to correlate frequency shifts to SOC. The model will be trained using a known charge/discharge cycle and corresponding frequency data.
*   **SOH Calculation:** Over time, degradation processes (e.g., lithium plating, electrolyte decomposition) alter the material properties and dampening characteristics of the cell. This manifests as a broadening of resonant peaks, a reduction in peak amplitude, and a shift in resonant frequencies. The SOH will be determined by analyzing changes in the resonance map over time. This will be done via comparison with a healthy baseline resonance map.
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing:**
    *   Sampling Rate: Minimum 10 MHz for accurate frequency analysis.
    *   Signal Processing: Utilize Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for frequency domain analysis. Noise reduction algorithms (e.g., Kalman filtering) will be crucial.
    *   Data Storage: Store raw frequency data and calculated SOC/SOH values for each cell, enabling long-term trend analysis.
*   **Thermal Management Integration:** Integrate temperature sensors near each cell to compensate for temperature-induced frequency shifts. The model will account for temperature effects during SOC/SOH calculation.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Utilize a low-power wireless communication protocol (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy) to transmit data to a central monitoring system.
*   **Power Requirements:** Sensors to be low-power, operating on a small, dedicated battery or harvested energy (e.g. vibration).
*   **Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// For each cell in the battery pack:
LOOP(cell)

    // Initiate frequency sweep
    FREQUENCY_SWEEP(start_frequency, end_frequency, step_size)

    // Receive signal and perform FFT
    RECEIVED_SIGNAL = RECEIVE_SIGNAL()
    FREQUENCY_DOMAIN_DATA = FFT(RECEIVED_SIGNAL)

    // Identify resonant peaks
    PEAKS = FIND_PEAKS(FREQUENCY_DOMAIN_DATA, threshold)

    // Calculate SOC
    SOC = MACHINE_LEARNING_MODEL(PEAKS, TEMPERATURE)

    // Calculate SOH
    SOH = COMPARE_TO_BASELINE(PEAKS)

    // Transmit data
    TRANSMIT(SOC, SOH, TEMPERATURE)

ENDLOOP
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond dimensional change monitoring, directly probing the *internal* material state of the battery.  The combination of resonant frequency analysis, machine learning, and thermal compensation provides a more accurate and robust assessment of both SOC and SOH. The non-destructive nature is also a key advantage.
