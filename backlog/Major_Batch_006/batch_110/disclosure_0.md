## Dynamic State Register Allocation for Parallel Sponge Functions

**Concept:** Expand the configurable sponge function engine to support *multiple*, dynamically allocated state registers operating in parallel, allowing for increased throughput and the processing of variable-length, interleaved data streams.

**Specification:**

*   **Hardware Components:**
    *   **State Register Pool:** A physically large, shared memory pool divided into individually addressable state registers. The size of the pool is configurable at manufacturing or boot time.
    *   **Register Allocation Unit (RAU):** Responsible for dynamically allocating and deallocating state registers to processing tasks. The RAU manages a free list of available registers and a map of register assignments.
    *   **Interleaving Controller:** Distributes input message fragments across allocated state registers, enabling parallel processing.
    *   **Parallel Iterative Calculation Units (PICU):** Multiple identical processing units that operate on allocated state registers concurrently.
    *   **Output Aggregator:** Combines the results from parallel PICUs into a final output.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `RegisterDescriptor`:  Contains the base address of the state register, size (bitrate + capacity), allocated status (boolean), and task ID.
    *   `TaskQueue`: Holds processing tasks, each specifying input data stream, desired throughput, and register request count.
    *   `RegisterMap`: A hash table mapping task IDs to allocated `RegisterDescriptor`s.

*   **Pseudocode – RAU Allocation:**

```
Function AllocateRegisters(taskID, requestCount):
    For i = 1 to requestCount:
        If FreeList is empty:
            Return Error “Insufficient Registers”
        registerDescriptor = Pop(FreeList)
        registerDescriptor.allocated = True
        registerDescriptor.taskID = taskID
        Add(RegisterMap, taskID, registerDescriptor)
    Return RegisterMap[taskID]
End Function

Function DeallocateRegisters(taskID):
    For Each registerDescriptor in RegisterMap[taskID]:
        registerDescriptor.allocated = False
        Add(FreeList, registerDescriptor)
    Remove(RegisterMap, taskID)
End Function
```

*   **Pseudocode - Interleaving Controller**

```
Function DistributeFragments(inputFragment, taskID):
    registerDescriptors = RegisterMap[taskID]
    registerCount = Length(registerDescriptors)
    fragmentIndex = Hash(inputFragment) Mod registerCount
    targetRegister = registerDescriptors[fragmentIndex]
    Write(targetRegister, inputFragment)
End Function
```

*   **Operation:**
    1.  A task (e.g., processing a high-volume data stream) requests a certain number of state registers from the RAU.
    2.  The RAU allocates registers from the free list and updates the register map.
    3.  The interleaving controller distributes input message fragments across the allocated registers using a hashing function to ensure even distribution.
    4.  The PICUs perform iterative processing operations on the registers in parallel.
    5.  The output aggregator collects the results from the PICUs and generates the final output.
    6.  Upon completion, the RAU deallocates the registers and adds them back to the free list.

*   **Configurability:**
    *   The size of the state register pool can be adjusted based on application requirements.
    *   The hashing function used by the interleaving controller can be selected or customized to optimize data distribution.
    *   The number of PICUs can be scaled to increase processing throughput.

*   **Potential Use Cases:**
    *   High-performance network packet processing.
    *   Real-time encryption/decryption of large data streams.
    *   Parallel data analytics.
    *   Multi-tenant security applications.
