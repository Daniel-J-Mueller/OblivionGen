## Dynamic NLU Model Composition via Reinforcement Learning

**Concept:** The patent details a system for selecting between pre-trained NLU models based on domain classification. This builds on that concept by *dynamically composing* NLU models – not just selecting – to optimize performance for highly nuanced user requests.  Instead of static, pre-trained models, we create a system that learns to assemble 'skill modules' (NER, Intent Classification, Dialogue State Tracking) on-the-fly, tailoring the NLU pipeline to the specific input.

**System Specs:**

*   **Skill Module Library:** A repository of individual NLU 'skill modules'. These modules are relatively small, focused models – e.g., a module specifically for extracting dates in a travel context, a module for identifying restaurant cuisine types, a module for detecting negative sentiment.  Each module outputs a confidence score.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** A RL agent (e.g. PPO, DQN) responsible for deciding which skill modules to apply and in what order. The agent receives the user’s text input as state, and outputs an action representing the selection of a skill module.
*   **Composition Engine:** Takes the output of the RL agent (skill module selection), applies the selected module to the input text, and passes the result (e.g., extracted entities, identified intent) as input to the next module in the sequence.  This creates a dynamic NLU pipeline.
*   **Reward Function:** A critical component. The reward function should incentivize accuracy, efficiency, and robustness.  Possible components:
    *   **Task Completion:** A high reward if the downstream task (e.g., booking a flight, answering a question) is successfully completed.
    *   **Confidence Score Penalty:** A penalty for low confidence scores from any module in the pipeline.  This encourages the agent to select modules that are highly confident in their predictions.
    *   **Pipeline Length Penalty:** A penalty for excessively long pipelines. This encourages efficiency and avoids unnecessary computation.
*   **State Representation:** The user's input text is transformed into a numerical representation usable by the RL agent (e.g., word embeddings, sentence embeddings). This could be enhanced with features derived from the domain classifier in the original patent.
*   **Training Data:** A large corpus of user utterances paired with successful task completions. This data is used to train the RL agent.  Active learning strategies could be employed to select the most informative utterances for training.

**Pseudocode:**

```
# Initialize RL agent, Skill Module Library, Composition Engine

def process_utterance(utterance):
  state = encode_utterance(utterance)  # Convert text to numerical representation
  
  pipeline = []
  
  while True:
    action = rl_agent.select_action(state)  # Select a skill module based on the current state
    
    if action is None: #No more modules to apply
      break
    
    selected_module = skill_module_library[action]
    
    output = selected_module.process(state) #Process state using module
    
    pipeline.append(output)
    
    state = update_state(state, output) #Update state with module output
    
  return pipeline
```

**Innovation & Potential:**

*   **Adaptability:** This system can adapt to new domains and user needs without requiring re-training of entire NLU models.  New skill modules can be added to the library as needed.
*   **Granularity:** By composing skill modules, the system can achieve a higher level of granularity and accuracy than traditional monolithic NLU models.
*   **Explainability:** The composition pipeline provides a degree of explainability – we can see which skill modules were applied and how they contributed to the final result.
*   **Resource Efficiency:**  We only apply the skill modules that are relevant to the specific user request, reducing computational cost.

This approach moves beyond simply *selecting* the best NLU model and towards *building* a customized NLU pipeline on demand. It allows for a more flexible, adaptable, and efficient speech interface.
