## Dynamic Relevance Weighting & "Echo" System

**Concept:** Expand upon user-submitted search suggestions by introducing a dynamic weighting system based on immediate user interaction *after* a search result is displayed. This is coupled with an "Echo" system that proactively solicits refinement of those suggestions.

**Specification:**

**I. Core System – Dynamic Relevance Weighting**

1.  **Interaction Tracking:** After displaying a search result page incorporating user-submitted suggestion attributes, monitor immediate user interactions. These include:
    *   **Click-Through Rate (CTR):** Track which results, incorporating specific suggestion attributes, receive clicks.
    *   **Dwell Time:** Measure how long a user spends on a page reached via a result incorporating a suggestion attribute.
    *   **"Helpful" Feedback:** Implement a simple "Was this suggestion helpful?" button on each displayed suggestion attribute.
    *   **Scroll Depth:** Track how far down the search results page users scroll before disengaging.

2.  **Weight Adjustment Algorithm:**  A real-time algorithm dynamically adjusts the weight (or "relevance score") of each user-submitted suggestion attribute based on collected interaction data.

    *   **Base Weight:** Each new suggestion starts with a base weight (e.g., 1.0).
    *   **CTR Factor:**  If a result incorporating the attribute receives a click, increase the weight (e.g., +0.05).
    *   **Dwell Time Factor:**  Longer dwell times result in a larger weight increase (e.g., +0.10 for >5 seconds).
    *   **Helpful Feedback:**  A "helpful" vote adds a significant boost (e.g., +0.20).
    *   **Decay:** Weights gradually decay over time if not reinforced by positive interaction.
    *   **Negative Feedback:** Implement a “Not Helpful” button to drastically reduce the weight.

3.  **Search Algorithm Integration:** Integrate the dynamic weights into the search algorithm.  Results incorporating higher-weighted suggestion attributes are ranked higher in the search results.

**II. "Echo" System – Proactive Refinement**

1.  **Triggering Conditions:** After a user performs a search, and a search result page is displayed incorporating user-submitted suggestions, determine if certain conditions are met:
    *   **Low Confidence:** If the dynamic weight of a displayed suggestion attribute falls below a certain threshold (e.g., 0.5).
    *   **Ambiguity:** If multiple suggestions are related to the same concept but have conflicting weights.
    *   **Low CTR:**  If a suggestion has been displayed multiple times without significant clicks.

2.  **Echo Prompt:** If a triggering condition is met, display a non-intrusive "Echo" prompt to the user:

    *   **Example Prompt:** "We noticed you searched for [item].  To help us improve search results, could you tell us: Is [suggestion attribute] a helpful way to describe this item?"
    *   **Response Options:**  "Yes, very helpful", "Somewhat helpful", "Not helpful", "Irrelevant".

3.  **Refinement Logic:**  Use the user's response to the Echo prompt to:

    *   **Adjust Weights:**  Increase or decrease the weight of the suggestion attribute accordingly.
    *   **Suggest Alternatives:**  If the user indicates the suggestion is irrelevant, prompt them to suggest alternative keywords or descriptions.
    *   **Create New Suggestions:** If the user suggests a new keyword, store it as a potential suggestion attribute for future consideration.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Upon Search Result Display
FOR EACH displayed suggestion attribute:
    IF (dynamicWeight < threshold) OR (lowCTR):
        Display "Echo" prompt to user
        Get user response
        Adjust dynamicWeight based on response

// Search Algorithm
results = Search(query, dataStore)
FOR EACH result:
    score = BaseScore + (dynamicWeight * suggestionAttributeBonus)
    Add result to results list (sorted by score)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `SuggestionAttribute`: { `keyword`, `description`, `dynamicWeight`, `voteCount`, `lastUpdated` }
*   `Item`: { `id`, `attributes`, `userSuggestions` }

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Employ caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed suggestion attributes and weights.
*   Utilize distributed processing to handle the real-time weight adjustment calculations.
*   Implement a queueing system to manage the incoming user feedback.
