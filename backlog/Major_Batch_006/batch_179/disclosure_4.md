## Distributed Lock Manager - Predictive Staleness & Resource Pre-emption

**System Overview:**

This design focuses on preemptively addressing potential lock staleness *before* the client's determined "safe period" expires. Instead of solely relying on client-side staleness calculations, the system introduces predictive analysis based on network latency, node load, and historical lock usage patterns. This allows for controlled resource pre-emption, minimizing disruption while maximizing resource availability.

**Components:**

*   **Lock Manager Core (existing):**  Manages lock requests, grants, and revocations.
*   **Staleness Prediction Module (SPM):**  A distributed service responsible for predicting lock staleness.  Resides on each Lock Manager Node.
*   **Resource Pre-emption Handler (RPH):**  Handles the graceful pre-emption of resources. Resides on each Lock Manager Node.
*   **Client-Side Prediction Integration:**  Minor client modifications to receive & interpret predicted staleness warnings.

**Specifications:**

1.  **SPM Data Collection:**
    *   Each Lock Manager Node collects:
        *   Network latency between itself and active clients (ping/RTT).
        *   Node CPU/Memory usage.
        *   Historical lock request/release rates for specific resources.
        *   Lock grant duration statistics for each resource.
2.  **SPM Predictive Algorithm:**
    *   The SPM employs a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or a simple moving average) to predict the probability of staleness exceeding a configurable threshold *before* the client's calculated safe period. The prediction horizon is configurable but ideally matches the expected maximum lock duration.
    *   Input Parameters:  Network Latency, Node Load, Historical Lock Usage, Lock Grant Duration Statistics, Client-Reported Time.
    *   Output: Probability of Staleness Exceeding Threshold.
3.  **Staleness Warning Protocol:**
    *   If the SPM predicts a high probability of staleness (above a configurable threshold – e.g., 70%), the Lock Manager Node sends a “Staleness Warning” message to the client.
    *   Message Format:
        *   `Warning Type`: "Staleness Warning"
        *   `Resource ID`: The resource protected by the lock.
        *   `Predicted Staleness Time`: Estimated time until potential staleness.
        *   `Pre-emption Score`: A value (0-100) indicating the urgency of pre-emption.
4.  **Client-Side Response:**
    *   Upon receiving a Staleness Warning, the client may:
        *   Initiate a faster save/checkpoint of its current state.
        *   Begin a cooperative release of the resource (if possible).
        *   Acknowledge the warning.
5.  **Resource Pre-emption Handling:**
    *   If the pre-emption score is above a threshold *and* the client does not respond to the Staleness Warning within a timeout, the RPH initiates pre-emption.
    *   Pre-emption Steps:
        *   Send a "Pre-emption Request" to the client.
        *   Allow a configurable grace period for client response.
        *   If no response, forcefully revoke the lock and release the resource.  This is handled using the existing revocation mechanisms.
6.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   The SPM dynamically adjusts the staleness threshold and pre-emption score based on:
        *   Real-time network conditions.
        *   Node load.
        *   Client response rates to Staleness Warnings.
7.  **Heartbeat Integration (Optional):**
    *   Integrate with the existing heartbeat mechanism.  If a heartbeat is missed *and* a Staleness Warning is active, the pre-emption process is accelerated.

**Pseudocode (SPM):**

```
function predictStaleness(networkLatency, nodeLoad, historicalData, clientTime):
  stalenessProbability = calculateProbability(networkLatency, nodeLoad, historicalData, clientTime)
  if stalenessProbability > STALENESS_THRESHOLD:
    return HIGH
  else:
    return LOW

function calculateProbability(networkLatency, nodeLoad, historicalData, clientTime):
    // Utilize time-series forecasting model (ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing)
    // Input parameters: networkLatency, nodeLoad, historicalData, clientTime
    // Output: stalenessProbability (0-1)

    //Simplified example for demonstration
    probability = networkLatency * nodeLoad * (1 - historicalData.averageLockDuration / clientTime)
    return probability
```

**Rationale:**

This design moves beyond purely reactive staleness detection by proactively predicting potential issues. By providing clients with warnings and implementing controlled pre-emption, we can minimize disruptions and maximize resource availability, leading to a more robust and scalable distributed locking system. The dynamic threshold adjustment ensures adaptability to changing network and system conditions.
