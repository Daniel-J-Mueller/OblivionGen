## Dynamic Authorization Function Chaining with Reputation Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the transient compute container authorization model by allowing a chain of authorization functions to execute sequentially, each potentially contributed by different entities (users, third parties, internal teams). Introduce a reputation scoring system for each function provider, influencing the order and weighting of function execution within the chain.

**Specification:**

**1. Authorization Chain Definition:**

*   A new data structure, `AuthorizationChain`, is defined. This structure contains:
    *   `ChainID`: Unique identifier for the authorization chain.
    *   `ResourceID`: Identifier of the resource being accessed.
    *   `FunctionList`: Ordered list of `FunctionDescriptors`.
    *   `FailFast`: Boolean flag. If true, the chain terminates upon the first failing function. If false, all functions are executed, and a combined result is calculated.

*   `FunctionDescriptor`:
    *   `FunctionID`: Unique identifier for the authorization function.
    *   `ProviderID`: Identifier of the entity providing the function.
    *   `Weight`: Numerical value representing the importance of the function in the chain (initial default = 1).
    *   `ExecutionTimeout`: Maximum allowed execution time for the function.

**2. Reputation System:**

*   `ProviderReputation`:
    *   `ProviderID`: Entity providing the function.
    *   `ReputationScore`: Numerical value reflecting the reliability and accuracy of the provider’s functions. (0-100, higher is better).
    *   `ScoreUpdateInterval`: Time interval for updating the reputation score.
    *   `SuccessWeight`: Factor applied to the score upon successful function execution.
    *   `FailureWeight`: Factor applied to the score upon failed function execution.

*   Reputation scores are updated based on the success/failure rate of the provider’s functions, as reported by the authorization system.
*   A background service monitors function executions and updates provider reputations accordingly.

**3. Authorization Flow:**

1.  Upon receiving an access request, the system determines the `ResourceID`.
2.  It retrieves the corresponding `AuthorizationChain` (or creates one if it doesn't exist).
3.  The `FunctionList` is sorted based on the `ReputationScore` of each `ProviderID` (descending order).
4.  For each `FunctionDescriptor` in the sorted `FunctionList`:
    *   A transient compute container is invoked, configured to execute the `FunctionID`.
    *   Context information (request details, user identity, resource attributes) is passed to the function.
    *   A timeout mechanism ensures functions do not exceed `ExecutionTimeout`.
    *   The function returns a boolean (authorized/not authorized) and optionally, a rationale.
    *   If `FailFast` is true, and a function returns false, the chain terminates, and the access is denied.
5.  If all functions execute (or `FailFast` is false), a combined authorization decision is made:
    *   A weighted sum of the boolean results is calculated (True = 1, False = 0).
    *   Access is granted if the weighted sum exceeds a predefined threshold.

**4. Pseudocode for Combined Decision:**

```
function calculate_combined_authorization(function_results, function_weights):
    total_weight = sum(function_weights)
    weighted_sum = 0
    for i in range(length(function_results)):
        if function_results[i] == True:
            weighted_sum += function_weights[i]
    authorization_ratio = weighted_sum / total_weight
    if authorization_ratio >= threshold:  // threshold is a configurable parameter
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

**5. API Endpoints:**

*   `/authorization_chain/create`: Create a new authorization chain.
*   `/authorization_chain/get`: Retrieve an existing authorization chain.
*   `/provider/reputation/update`: Manually update provider reputation (for administrative purposes).
*   `/authorization/execute`: Execute the authorization chain for a given resource.
