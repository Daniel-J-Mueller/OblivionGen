## Dynamic Acoustic Mapping for Spatial Audio Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand the multi-device positional awareness beyond visual identification to encompass a fully dynamic acoustic map. This allows for spatial audio reconstruction *even* when visual data is obscured or unavailable, and enables novel interactions based on sound source location.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each device (phone, tablet, dedicated sensor) equipped with a multi-microphone array (minimum 4, optimally 8+).
    *   High-precision time-of-flight (ToF) sensors for initial spatial calibration between devices.
    *   Devices communicate via a low-latency wireless protocol (e.g., Ultra-Wideband (UWB), enhanced Wi-Fi 6).

*   **Software – Core Acoustic Mapping Module:**
    *   **Sound Source Localization:** Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and beamforming algorithms on microphone array data to determine the 3D location of sound sources (voices, instruments, ambient sounds).
    *   **Multi-Device Fusion:** Combines sound source locations from multiple devices using a Kalman filter or similar state estimation technique to create a unified acoustic map.  Weights are assigned based on signal quality, device proximity, and confidence levels.
    *   **Dynamic Calibration:** Continuously refines device positions relative to each other using acoustic beacons (short, unique sounds emitted by each device) and ambient noise analysis.  Addresses drift and environmental changes.
    *   **Occlusion Handling:**  Algorithms to estimate sound source location even when obstructed by objects. Uses sound reflection modeling and device position data.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Understanding:**  Identifies sound events (speech, music, footsteps) using machine learning models trained on acoustic datasets.
*   **Software – Spatial Audio Reconstruction Module:**
    *   **Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) Personalization:**  Uses device cameras and user input to capture/estimate the user’s HRTF.  Adjusts spatial audio to individual ear shapes for a more immersive experience.
    *   **Sound Source Virtualization:**  Renders virtual sound sources at the estimated positions on the acoustic map. Includes realistic reverb and sound propagation effects.
    *   **Dynamic Mixing:**  Adjusts the volume and panning of sound sources based on the user’s position and orientation.
*   **Software – Interaction Framework:**
    *   **Audio-Based Control:** Allows users to control devices or applications using voice commands or gestures detected through sound analysis.
    *   **Acoustic Tagging:** Enables users to tag physical objects with sounds, allowing the system to identify and track them in the acoustic map.
    *   **Spatial Audio Notifications:** Delivers notifications with spatial audio cues, indicating the direction and distance of the event.
    *    **“Acoustic Zoom”:**  User can select a point in the acoustic map and the system enhances audio from that location while suppressing others.
*   **Pseudocode (Acoustic Mapping Core):**

```
// Device Initialization
initializeMicrophoneArray()
initializeToF()
connectToNetwork()

// Calibration
calibrateDevicePositions()

// Main Loop
while(true) {
  captureAudioData()
  localizeSoundSources()
  fuseSoundSourceDataFromAllDevices()
  updateAcousticMap()
  broadcastAcousticMap()
}
```
**Novelty:**  Existing systems focus primarily on visual positional awareness.  This concept prioritizes an *acoustic* map, creating a system that works in the dark, through walls (to a degree), and is resilient to visual occlusion. It enables a new suite of interactive experiences beyond simple visual tracking.
