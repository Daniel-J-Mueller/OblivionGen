## Dynamic Merchant ‘Health’ Prediction & Proactive Capacity Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the suitability scoring beyond immediate order fulfillment to *predict* future merchant capacity & ‘health’ – proactively adjusting order flow and offering support *before* performance degrades. This shifts from reactive suitability to predictive optimization.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Real-time Data Streams:** Integrate beyond existing online/offline data. Incorporate:
    *   **POS Data:** Granular sales data beyond fulfilled orders (walk-in traffic, popular items, etc.) - sourced directly from the merchant’s system.
    *   **Supply Chain Data:** API access (where available) to merchant’s suppliers – ingredient availability, delivery schedules.
    *   **Environmental Data:** Local weather, traffic conditions (affecting delivery times).
    *   **Social Media Sentiment:** Analyze public mentions of the merchant – positive/negative feedback regarding quality/service.
*   **Feature Engineering:**
    *   **Capacity Index:** Calculated based on POS data, staff scheduling (if accessible), and historical order completion rates.
    *   **Supply Risk Score:** Derived from supply chain data, highlighting potential ingredient shortages.
    *   **Delivery Resilience Score:** Combines weather/traffic data with historical delivery performance.
    *   **Sentiment Trend:** Tracks changes in social media sentiment over time.

**II. Predictive Modeling:**

*   **Time-Series Forecasting:** Employ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or similar recurrent neural networks to predict future Capacity Index, Supply Risk Score, and Delivery Resilience Score.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Use Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM to identify deviations from predicted values – flagging potential problems *before* they impact performance.
*   **‘Health’ Score:** Combine forecasted values & anomaly detection results into an overall ‘Health’ Score for each merchant.

**III. Proactive Order Management:**

*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Adjust the weighting of different suitability score components based on the ‘Health’ Score. Merchants with declining health receive lower priority for new orders.
*   **Order Steering:** Redirect orders to healthier merchants whenever possible, even if their initial suitability score is slightly lower.
*   **Capacity Augmentation:** (Optional) Offer merchants proactive support:
    *   **Ingredient Pre-Ordering:** Predict ingredient needs & facilitate pre-ordering through the system.
    *   **Staffing Recommendations:** Based on projected order volume & merchant capacity, suggest optimal staffing levels.
    *   **Delivery Route Optimization:** Offer real-time delivery route optimization based on traffic & weather conditions.

**IV. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices:** Implement as a set of loosely coupled microservices: Data Ingestion, Feature Engineering, Predictive Modeling, Order Management, Merchant Support.
*   **Real-time Data Pipeline:** Utilize Kafka or similar message queue for real-time data streaming.
*   **Machine Learning Platform:** Integrate with a cloud-based ML platform (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform) for model training & deployment.

**Pseudocode (Order Allocation Logic):**

```
function allocateOrder(order, merchantList):
  for each merchant in merchantList:
    suitabilityScore = calculateSuitabilityScore(merchant, order)
    healthScore = getMerchantHealthScore(merchant)

    adjustedSuitabilityScore = suitabilityScore * (1 + healthScoreWeight * healthScore) //Higher health boosts score

  bestMerchant = merchant with highest adjustedSuitabilityScore
  allocate order to bestMerchant
  return bestMerchant
```
