## Adaptive Fourier Thresholding with Correlated Anomaly Signals

**Specification:** A system extending the anomaly detection framework to incorporate inter-host correlation analysis and dynamically adjusted Fourier component thresholds based on system load and historical anomaly patterns.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of fixed or pre-defined thresholds for each Fourier component, the system learns and adapts thresholds *in real-time* based on observed correlations between hosts *and* overall system load. This reduces false positives caused by transient, correlated behavior and increases sensitivity to genuine anomalies.

**Components:**

1.  **Correlation Engine:** A module continuously monitoring the host standard deviation vectors across the fleet. This engine calculates a correlation matrix, identifying hosts exhibiting similar deviations in specific Fourier component elements.

2.  **Load Monitor:** Tracks system-wide metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O) to determine overall system load.

3.  **Threshold Adjustment Module:** This is the core of the innovation. It receives inputs from the Correlation Engine and Load Monitor and dynamically adjusts the anomaly thresholds for each Fourier component.

    *   **Correlation-Based Adjustment:** If a group of hosts exhibits correlated deviation in a particular Fourier component, the threshold for that component is *raised* proportionally to the strength of the correlation. This assumes that correlated behavior is likely normal, especially under high load.

    *   **Load-Based Adjustment:** Under high system load, thresholds are *loosened* to account for increased variance in processing utilization data. Conversely, under low load, thresholds are *tightened* for increased sensitivity.

    *   **Historical Pattern Learning:** The module maintains a historical record of anomaly patterns and threshold adjustments. This data is used to refine the adjustment algorithm over time, improving its accuracy and reducing false positives. A simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) could be employed for this learning function.

4.  **Anomaly Scoring Function:** Combines the adjusted threshold comparisons with a weighted score. Higher weights are assigned to Fourier components with low variance and strong historical anomaly correlation.

**Pseudocode (Threshold Adjustment Module):**

```
function adjust_threshold(component_index, correlation_strength, system_load, historical_data):
  base_threshold = DEFAULT_THRESHOLD[component_index]  // Initial threshold

  // Correlation adjustment
  correlation_factor = 1 + (correlation_strength * CORRELATION_SCALE)
  adjusted_threshold = base_threshold * correlation_factor

  // Load adjustment
  load_factor = 1 - (system_load * LOAD_SCALE) // Invert load â€“ higher load = lower threshold
  adjusted_threshold = adjusted_threshold * load_factor

  // Historical pattern adjustment
  historical_offset = RNN(historical_data) // RNN predicts threshold adjustment based on past anomalies
  adjusted_threshold = adjusted_threshold + historical_offset

  return adjusted_threshold
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Each host sends processing utilization data.
2.  Fourier component vectors are generated.
3.  Mean and standard deviation vectors are calculated.
4.  Host standard deviation vectors are computed.
5.  Correlation Engine calculates inter-host correlation.
6.  Load Monitor tracks system load.
7.  Threshold Adjustment Module dynamically calculates anomaly thresholds.
8.  Anomaly Scoring Function compares host standard deviation vectors to adjusted thresholds.
9.  Anomalous hosts are flagged and reported.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Causal Inference:** Integrate a causal inference engine to determine the root cause of anomalies based on correlated behavior and system dependencies.
*   **Predictive Anomaly Detection:** Leverage historical data and machine learning to predict future anomalies before they occur.
*   **Automated Remediation:** Automatically trigger corrective actions based on identified anomalies.
