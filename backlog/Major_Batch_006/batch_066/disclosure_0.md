## Predictive Resource Allocation with Simulated Network States

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Network State Simulator" - a software module capable of generating probabilistic representations of network device health *before* event logs are received. This isn't a simple ping test. It's a multi-variate model predicting component degradation based on historical data, time-based wear, correlated failures, and external factors (e.g., weather, known software vulnerabilities).
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical event logs (as in the provided patent).
    *   Device specifications (CPU, RAM, network interface cards, etc.).
    *   Network topology data.
    *   External data feeds (weather, vulnerability databases, etc.).
*   **Output:** A probabilistic "health map" of the network, quantifying the *likelihood* of failure for each device or network segment. This map is updated continuously, operating *ahead* of actual failure events.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** The probabilistic health map is fed into the existing task prioritization engine (from the patent).  Instead of *reacting* to issues, the system *anticipates* them.
*   **Resource Pre-Allocation:** Based on the probabilistic health map, the system proactively allocates resources (bandwidth, CPU cycles, processing priority) to devices or segments predicted to be at high risk. This creates a buffer.
*   **Simulated "What-If" Analysis:**  The Network State Simulator can run simulations.  "What if Device X fails?" The simulator predicts the impact and suggests pre-emptive resource adjustments.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:**  Instead of static thresholds for triggering tasks, the system uses dynamic thresholds based on the predicted risk level.  A device in a high-risk state might trigger a task with a lower severity level than it would if it were in a normal state.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (network_is_active) {

  // 1. Generate Probabilistic Health Map
  health_map = network_state_simulator.generate_health_map(
    historical_logs,
    device_specs,
    topology_data,
    external_data
  );

  // 2. Identify At-Risk Devices/Segments
  at_risk_devices = health_map.filter(risk_level > threshold);

  // 3. Pre-allocate Resources
  for each device in at_risk_devices {
    allocate_resources(device, predicted_resource_need);
  }

  // 4. Run "What-If" Scenarios
  for each critical_device in critical_devices {
    simulate_failure(critical_device);
    adjust_resources_based_on_simulation(simulation_results);
  }

  // 5. Dynamic Task Prioritization
  tasks = generate_tasks_based_on_health_map(health_map);
  prioritized_tasks = prioritize_tasks_with_dynamic_thresholds(tasks, health_map);

  // 6. Dispatch Tasks
  dispatch_tasks(prioritized_tasks);

  // 7. Wait for next cycle
  wait(time_interval);
}
```

**Innovation Description:**

The key difference is shifting from reactive to proactive.  Instead of waiting for devices to fail and then responding, this system anticipates failure and allocates resources *before* the failure occurs.  This improves network stability, reduces downtime, and minimizes the impact of failures.  The dynamic thresholds and "What-If" analysis allow for more intelligent and efficient resource allocation.
