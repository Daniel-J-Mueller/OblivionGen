## Dynamic Taxonomy Personalization via Behavioral Prediction

**Concept:** Leverage user behavior *prior* to any filtering action to proactively shape the displayed taxonomy, predicting likely filtering needs and pre-adjusting category structures. This moves beyond reactive adjustments based on explicit filtering and anticipates user intent.

**Specs:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Browsing history (items viewed, time spent on pages).
    *   Purchase history.
    *   Search queries (even those not resulting in purchases).
    *   Demographic data (if available and consented to).
    *   Real-time interaction data (mouse movements, scroll depth, click patterns).
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   Data normalization and cleaning.
    *   Feature extraction: create vectors representing user preferences (e.g., keywords, categories, price ranges, brands).
    *   Sessionization: Group user actions into sessions.
*   **Output:** A user preference vector updated in real-time during the session.

**2. Predictive Taxonomy Engine:**

*   **Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
*   **Input:** The user preference vector from the Behavioral Data Collection Module.
*   **Training Data:** Historical user behavior data (millions of sessions) correlated with eventual filtering actions.
*   **Output:**  A probability distribution over potential taxonomy adjustments. This distribution represents the likelihood that a user will apply specific filters (e.g., color, size, price range).
*   **Adjustment Types:**
    *   **Category Reordering:**  Prioritize frequently accessed categories higher in the hierarchy.
    *   **Category Expansion/Contraction:** Dynamically expand or collapse categories based on predicted interest.
    *   **Filter Pre-Selection:**  Pre-select filters likely to be used (with clear indication that they are pre-selected and can be changed).
    *   **Dynamic Facet Generation**: Create new facets based on user behavior. For example, if a user consistently views items with a specific feature (e.g., "vegan"), a "vegan" filter is automatically added.

**3. Taxonomy Rendering Module:**

*   **Input:** The adjusted taxonomy structure and pre-selected filters from the Predictive Taxonomy Engine.
*   **Rendering Logic:**
    *   Dynamically renders the taxonomy in the user interface.
    *   Highlights pre-selected filters.
    *   Provides visual cues to indicate dynamic adjustments.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Integrates an A/B testing framework to evaluate the effectiveness of dynamic adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Inside the main loop for each user session:

user_profile = get_user_profile() //Retrieve existing data
behavior_data = collect_behavior_data()
user_profile.update(behavior_data) //Combine data

predicted_taxonomy = predict_taxonomy(user_profile) //Run model to get adjustment probabilities

render_taxonomy(predicted_taxonomy) //Render dynamically
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

This isn't simply reacting to filters; it’s *anticipating* them. This creates a more seamless and intuitive user experience. The dynamic facet generation moves beyond pre-defined categories to align with emerging user preferences. The LSTM allows for capturing temporal dependencies in user behavior (e.g., a user might be initially browsing broadly, but then narrow their focus). The integration of an A/B testing framework allows for continuous optimization of the predictive model.
