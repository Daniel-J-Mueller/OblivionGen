## Autonomous Mobile Retail Unit with Dynamic Inventory & Personalized Offerings

**System Specs:**

*   **Unit Dimensions:** 60cm x 40cm x 180cm (approximate – adaptable). Constructed from lightweight, durable composite material.
*   **Mobility:** Omnidirectional wheels for precise maneuvering. Integrated suspension system for smooth travel over varied terrain. Maximum speed: 5 km/h.
*   **Power:** Solid-state batteries. Wireless charging capability (docking stations deployed strategically). Estimated operating time: 8 hours/charge.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   LiDAR (360° coverage) for environment mapping & obstacle avoidance.
    *   Multiple high-resolution cameras (RGB-D) for object recognition (users, products, obstacles) & scene understanding.
    *   Weight sensors in shelving units to monitor inventory levels.
    *   Ambient temperature & humidity sensors.
*   **Communication:** 5G/Wi-Fi connectivity. Bluetooth for short-range communication (user devices).
*   **Processing:** Onboard edge computing unit (high-performance processor, GPU).
*   **User Interface:**  Integrated touchscreen display (optional – primarily voice/app-based interaction).  External speakers/microphone array.
*   **Security:** Tamper-evident locks, GPS tracking, remote disable capability.
*   **Inventory Management:** Modular shelving system with adjustable compartments.  RFID tagging for each product.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Dynamic Route Planning:** Unit navigates designated areas (parking lots, campuses, event spaces) based on real-time demand. Routes adjusted based on user location, inventory levels, and predicted traffic patterns.
2.  **Personalized Product Recommendations:** 
    *   User identification via mobile app or facial recognition.
    *   AI-powered recommendation engine (data from purchase history, browsing behavior, social media preferences).
    *   Displayed on the touchscreen and communicated via voice prompts.
3.  **Automated Inventory Replenishment:** 
    *   Real-time inventory monitoring via weight sensors and RFID tags.
    *   Automated reordering triggered when stock levels fall below pre-defined thresholds.
    *   Communication with a central warehouse for just-in-time delivery.
4.  **Contactless Payment:** Integrated payment gateway (credit/debit cards, mobile payment platforms). Secure transaction processing.
5.  **Real-Time Data Analytics:** 
    *   Tracking of unit location, inventory levels, sales data, user interactions.
    *   Insights into customer preferences, popular products, optimal route planning.
    *   Data accessible via a web-based dashboard.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Route Optimization & Personalized Offering):**

```
// Data Structures
struct UserProfile {
    userID: string;
    location: (x, y);
    purchaseHistory: list<string>;
    preferences: list<string>;
}

struct Product {
    productID: string;
    name: string;
    category: string;
    price: float;
    stockLevel: int;
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. User Identification & Location
    user = identifyUser();  // Using facial recognition or app connection
    userLocation = getUserLocation(user);

    // 2. Product Recommendation
    recommendedProducts = generateRecommendations(user);

    // 3. Route Optimization
    optimalRoute = calculateRoute(userLocation, recommendedProducts);

    // 4. Navigation
    navigateRoute(optimalRoute);

    // 5. Inventory Management & Replenishment (background process)
    monitorInventory();
    if (lowStock(product)) {
        requestReplenishment(product);
    }
}

// Function: generateRecommendations
function generateRecommendations(user) {
    // Retrieve user profile data
    profile = getUserProfile(user);

    // Filter products based on user preferences and purchase history
    filteredProducts = filterProducts(profile);

    // Rank products based on predicted likelihood of purchase (machine learning model)
    rankedProducts = rankProducts(filteredProducts);

    return rankedProducts;
}
```
