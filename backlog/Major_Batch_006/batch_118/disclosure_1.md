## Adaptive Environmental Audio Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the undesirable sound suppression to *reconstruct* a more desirable environmental audio profile for the receiving party. Instead of simply removing sounds, the system analyzes the environment and synthesizes a more pleasant or focused auditory experience.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 4 microphones) integrated into the user device (e.g., smartphone, headset, dedicated environmental sensor).
    *   High-fidelity audio processing unit (DSP or dedicated neural processing unit).
    *   Network connectivity (Wi-Fi, Cellular).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Environmental Audio Analyzer:**  Uses machine learning (trained on diverse environmental soundscapes) to identify distinct sound events (speech, traffic, nature sounds, etc.) and their spatial characteristics (direction, distance). Leverages a hierarchical sound event detection model.
    *   **Soundscape Profiler:**  Creates a baseline “soundscape profile” of the user’s environment based on long-term audio analysis. This profile represents the typical auditory characteristics of the space.
    *   **Undesirable Sound Classifier:**  Identifies specific undesirable sounds, as in the original patent, but expands the classification to include sounds detrimental to focus or relaxation (e.g., repetitive clicking, low-frequency hums).
    *   **Acoustic Reconstruction Engine:** This is the core of the innovation. Based on the environmental analysis, the undesirable sound classification, and the soundscape profile, the engine synthesizes replacement audio to fill the auditory gap created by suppressing undesirable sounds.  This isn’t simple noise filling; it aims to create a *cohesive* and *natural*-sounding soundscape.
        *   Utilizes a generative audio model (e.g., Variational Autoencoder, GAN) trained on a large dataset of natural soundscapes.
        *   Employs spatial audio rendering techniques to accurately position synthesized sounds in the 3D sound field.
        *   Offers user-selectable “reconstruction profiles” (e.g., “Focus” – emphasizes quiet and subtle ambient sounds; “Relax” – incorporates natural sounds like rain or birdsong; “Neutral” – maintains a basic ambient sound level).
    *   **Real-time Audio Processor:**  Processes incoming audio, suppresses undesirable sounds, and blends the synthesized audio in real-time, minimizing latency.
    *   **Network Communication Module:**  Transmits the processed audio stream to the receiving device.
*   **Pseudocode (Acoustic Reconstruction Engine):**

```
function reconstructAudio(incomingAudio, undesirableSoundMask, environmentProfile, reconstructionProfile):
  // undesirableSoundMask identifies frames containing undesirable sounds.
  // environmentProfile contains baseline soundscape characteristics.
  // reconstructionProfile selects the desired audio reconstruction style.

  for each frame in incomingAudio:
    if undesirableSoundMask[frame] == True:
      // Generate replacement audio based on reconstructionProfile.
      replacementAudio = generateReplacementAudio(reconstructionProfile)

      // Spatially position the replacement audio.
      spatializedAudio = spatializeAudio(replacementAudio, environmentProfile)

      // Blend the spatialized audio with the remaining audio from the frame.
      blendedAudio[frame] = blendAudio(remainingAudio, spatializedAudio)
    else:
      blendedAudio[frame] = frame

  return blendedAudio
```

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Settings for selecting reconstruction profiles.
    *   Sensitivity adjustments for undesirable sound detection.
    *   Option to customize the soundscape profile (e.g., preferred ambient sounds).
    *   Real-time visualization of the reconstructed soundscape (optional).

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple suppression to *active* environmental audio management. It doesn’t just remove noise; it *shapes* the auditory experience, potentially enhancing focus, relaxation, or communication quality. It also introduces a richer level of customization and control over the auditory environment.
