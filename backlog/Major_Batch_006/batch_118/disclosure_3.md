## Personalized "Recipe of the Week" Tote Integration

**Concept:** Leverage tote delivery data and external recipe databases to proactively suggest complete meal kits *integrated* directly into the tote delivery system. This moves beyond simple item recommendations to *solution* recommendations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Integration Layer:**

*   **External Recipe Database API:** Integrate with APIs like Allrecipes, Food Network, or similar. Access recipes with ingredient lists and instructions. Focus on databases allowing programmatic access.
*   **Customer Preference Profile:** Extend existing tote data to include:
    *   Dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, allergies).
    *   Preferred cuisine types (Italian, Mexican, Asian, etc.).
    *   Skill level (easy, medium, advanced).
    *   Household size (number of servings needed).
    *   Frequency of cooking (how many meals per week).
*   **Inventory Cross-Reference:** Maintain a mapping between recipe ingredients and available products in the enterprise’s inventory.

**2. Recipe Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Algorithm:**  A hybrid recommendation system:
    *   **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommend recipes similar to those the customer has ordered ingredients for in the past (e.g., if they often order tomatoes, recommend tomato-based recipes).
    *   **Collaborative Filtering:**  Identify recipes popular with other customers who have similar tote ordering patterns.
    *   **Contextual Filtering:** Consider seasonality, current promotions, and local ingredient availability.
*   **Weekly Recipe Selection:**  The engine selects a "Recipe of the Week" for each customer.
*   **Ingredient Gap Analysis:** Determine which ingredients from the selected recipe the customer *doesn’t* currently have scheduled in their tote.

**3. Tote Integration & User Interface:**

*   **Automatic Ingredient Addition:**  Offer the customer the option to automatically add the missing ingredients to their next tote delivery with a single click/tap.
*   **Recipe Card Display:**  Display the “Recipe of the Week” within the customer's tote management interface (web/app). Include:
    *   Recipe image
    *   Brief description
    *   Ingredient list (highlighting items already in the tote)
    *   Link to full recipe instructions (hosted on enterprise website or external source)
*   **Meal Kit Option:** Package the required ingredients as a pre-portioned “Meal Kit” for convenience.  Price the Meal Kit with a slight premium.
*   **Subscription Option:** Allow customers to subscribe to a weekly/monthly “Recipe of the Week” plan, automatically adding ingredients to their totes.
*   **User Feedback:** Incorporate a rating/review system for recipes to improve recommendations.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
function recommendRecipe(customerProfile, recipeDatabase):
  // Filter recipes based on customer preferences (dietary restrictions, cuisine, skill level)
  filteredRecipes = filterRecipes(recipeDatabase, customerProfile)

  // Score recipes based on ingredient overlap with existing tote orders
  scoredRecipes = scoreRecipes(filteredRecipes, customerProfile.pastToteOrders)

  // Select the highest-scoring recipe
  recommendedRecipe = selectRecipe(scoredRecipes)

  return recommendedRecipe
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Scalable cloud infrastructure for data storage and processing.
*   API integration framework.
*   Machine learning libraries for recommendation algorithms.
*   Web/mobile application development framework.
