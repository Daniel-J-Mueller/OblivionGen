## Adaptive Content Priming via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the idea of pre-emptive content delivery (avoiding redundant notifications) by incorporating real-time biofeedback to *proactively* surface content aligned with the user's current emotional/cognitive state, even *before* any inferred need.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integration with wearable sensors (heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), EEG – optional, but preferred for cognitive state)
    *   Secure, low-latency data transmission to the computing system.
*   **Software – Biofeedback Processing Module:**
    *   Real-time signal processing to extract relevant features (e.g., stress levels, relaxation, focus, boredom).
    *   Machine learning model trained to map biofeedback features to broad emotional/cognitive states.  (Model must be continually refined with user feedback/interaction data).
    *   State categorization:  Output a prioritized list of likely user states (e.g., "High Stress," "Relaxed/Receptive," "Focused," "Bored," "Neutral").
*   **Content Mapping & Prioritization:**
    *   Content database tagged with metadata relating to emotional/cognitive impact (e.g., “Calming,” “Energizing,” “Intellectually Stimulating,” “Distracting”). This can be crowd-sourced or AI-derived from content analysis.
    *   Rule engine / ML model to map biofeedback states to relevant content categories. For example:
        *   "High Stress" -> "Calming Music," "Guided Meditation," "Breathing Exercises"
        *   "Relaxed/Receptive" -> "Long-form Article," "Documentary," "Creative Writing Prompt"
        *   "Focused" -> “Relevant Research Paper,” “Work Playlist,” “Project Updates”
        *   "Bored" -> "Short-Form Video," "Interactive Game," "Unexpected Factoid"
*   **Delivery Mechanism:**
    *   Non-intrusive notification system (e.g., subtle visual cues, haptic feedback, ambient audio).
    *   Content surfaced as 'suggestions' rather than direct notifications.
    *   User-adjustable sensitivity levels for biofeedback integration (e.g., "Off," "Low," "Medium," "High").
    *   Mechanism for user feedback (explicit rating/dismissal of suggestions) to refine biofeedback model and content mapping.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Biofeedback-Driven Content Selection):**

```
// Input: Biofeedback Data (HRV, EDA, EEG - processed into state probabilities)
//        User Profile (preferences, history)
//        Content Database (tagged with emotional/cognitive metadata)

function selectContent(biofeedbackData, userProfile, contentDatabase):
    userState = analyzeBiofeedback(biofeedbackData) // Returns a weighted distribution of states
    preferredCategories = getUserPreferredCategories(userProfile)
    candidateContent = filterContentByCategories(contentDatabase, preferredCategories)
    scoredContent = scoreContentByState(candidateContent, userState) // Higher score = better fit
    sortedContent = sortContentByScore(scoredContent)
    recommendedContent = sortedContent[0:3] // Return top 3 recommendations
    return recommendedContent
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems focus on preventing redundant content delivery *after* a need is inferred. This concept actively anticipates user needs based on *physiological* signals, offering personalized content *before* the user consciously expresses a desire, potentially influencing mood and cognitive state. This is a proactive, rather than reactive, approach to content delivery.
