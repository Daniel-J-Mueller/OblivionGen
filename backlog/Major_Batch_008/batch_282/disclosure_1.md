## Adaptive Propeller Material Composition

**Specification:** Propeller blades constructed from layered composite materials with dynamically adjustable stiffness.

**Materials:**

*   **Base Layer:** High-strength carbon fiber composite.
*   **Active Layer:** Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) matrix infused with electrically conductive nanoparticles. This layer comprises approximately 20-30% of the blade thickness.
*   **Protective Layer:** Thin layer of abrasion-resistant polymer coating.

**Mechanism:**

1.  **Electrical Current Control:** Each blade incorporates an embedded network of micro-wires connected to a central control unit. By varying the electrical current flowing through these wires, the temperature of the SMP layer is precisely controlled.
2.  **SMP Phase Transition:** SMPs exhibit a temperature-dependent transition between a rigid and a flexible state.  Heating the SMP layer above its glass transition temperature (Tg) softens the material, allowing the blade to deform. Cooling below Tg restores rigidity.
3.  **Blade Morphing:** Targeted heating/cooling of specific SMP sections enables localized blade deformation. This allows for dynamic adjustment of blade pitch, camber, and even airfoil shape *during* flight.

**Control System:**

*   **Sensor Input:** The system receives data from:
    *   Aircraft speed sensors
    *   Altitude sensors
    *   Angle of Attack (AoA) sensors
    *   Vibration sensors
    *   Environmental sensors (wind speed/direction)
*   **AI-Driven Algorithm:** A machine learning algorithm analyzes sensor data and predicts optimal blade configuration for current flight conditions. 
*   **Feedback Loop:** Real-time feedback from vibration sensors ensures structural integrity and prevents excessive deformation.
*   **Microcontroller:** Embedded microcontroller manages current distribution to individual SMP sections based on AI output.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize sensors and microcontroller
sensor_init()
microcontroller_init()

// Main loop
while (true) {
    // Read sensor data
    speed = read_speed_sensor()
    altitude = read_altitude_sensor()
    AoA = read_AoA_sensor()
    vibration = read_vibration_sensor()
    wind_speed = read_wind_speed_sensor()
    wind_direction = read_wind_direction_sensor()

    // Run AI algorithm
    optimal_configuration = AI_algorithm(speed, altitude, AoA, vibration, wind_speed, wind_direction)

    // Apply configuration to blades
    for (each blade section) {
        target_temperature = optimal_configuration[blade section].temperature
        set_blade_section_temperature(blade section, target_temperature)
    }

    // Monitor vibration for structural integrity
    if (vibration > threshold) {
        emergency_configuration()
    }

    delay(0.01) // 10ms delay
}
```

**Applications:**

*   Improved aerodynamic efficiency across a wider range of flight speeds.
*   Enhanced maneuverability, particularly during low-speed flight.
*   Reduced noise pollution by optimizing blade shape for reduced tip vortices.
*   Active vibration damping to improve ride comfort.
*   Potential for gust load alleviation.
