## Adaptive Chunking & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Enhance archival data access by dynamically adjusting chunk sizes based on access patterns *and* proactively prefetching chunks based on predicted future access. This expands beyond static tree-hash alignment to create a self-optimizing archive.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dynamic Chunk Resizing Module:**

*   **Input:** Access logs (timestamp, data chunk ID, client ID), Archive Metadata (original chunk structure, data type).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Access Pattern Analysis:**  Utilize a moving average to identify frequently accessed regions. Detect sequential reads and random access patterns.
    *   **Chunk Size Adjustment:** Based on access patterns:
        *   **Sequential Access:**  Dynamically merge small, sequentially accessed chunks into larger "virtual chunks."  Maintain mapping table for original chunk IDs.
        *   **Random Access:** Split frequently accessed larger chunks into smaller, more granular chunks.
        *   **Inactivity:**  Revert virtual chunks to original size after a period of inactivity (configurable threshold).
    *   **Metadata Update:**  Maintain a separate metadata layer that maps virtual chunk IDs to original chunk IDs.
*   **Output:**  Updated metadata layer, adjusted virtual chunk structure.

**2. Predictive Prefetching Engine:**

*   **Input:** Access logs, Metadata layer, Archive Metadata, Client Profile (if available â€“ e.g., historical access patterns for a specific client).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Pattern Recognition:** Utilize a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to predict future chunk access based on historical access sequences. Model should consider:
        *   Client ID
        *   Timestamp
        *   Sequence of accessed chunks
        *   Data type
    *   **Prefetch Queue:** Maintain a queue of predicted chunks to be prefetched. Prioritize chunks based on prediction confidence.
    *   **Prefetch Trigger:** Initiate prefetch requests for chunks in the queue when network bandwidth is available (configurable threshold).
*   **Output:** Prefetch requests, updated prefetch queue.

**3. Tree-Hash Integration:**

*   **Modified Hash Tree Structure:** The traditional static hash tree will be extended with a layer to indicate the virtual chunk boundaries and mappings.
*   **Hash Calculation Updates:** The hash calculation process will adapt to the dynamic chunk sizes. This might involve using a rolling hash function to efficiently recalculate hashes when chunk boundaries change.

**4. Client-Side Caching:**

*   **Intelligent Cache Management:** The client will utilize a caching mechanism that prioritizes prefetched chunks and dynamically adjusts cache size based on available memory and access patterns.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```pseudocode
// Training Phase (performed periodically)
TrainMLModel(access_logs, metadata) -> MLModel

// Real-time Prediction
function PredictNextChunks(current_chunk_sequence, client_id):
  predicted_chunks = MLModel.predict(current_chunk_sequence, client_id)
  return predicted_chunks

function ManagePrefetchQueue(predicted_chunks):
  // Add predicted chunks to the prefetch queue
  prefetch_queue.add(predicted_chunks)

  // Remove prefetched chunks from the queue
  // Prioritize chunks based on prediction confidence
  // Limit queue size based on available bandwidth

function InitiatePrefetchRequests():
  // Check for available bandwidth
  if bandwidth_available:
    // Get next chunk(s) from the prefetch queue
    next_chunk = prefetch_queue.get()
    // Initiate data retrieval request
    retrieve_data(next_chunk)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Metadata Layer:** Dictionary mapping virtual chunk IDs to original chunk IDs and associated metadata (data type, size).
*   **Prefetch Queue:** Priority queue sorted by prediction confidence and estimated access time.

This system allows for an archive that not only verifies data integrity through tree-hashing but also *learns* how to optimize access for individual clients and data types, resulting in a significantly faster and more responsive archival experience.
