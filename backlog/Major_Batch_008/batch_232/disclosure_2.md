## Adaptive Pre-fetching based on User Gaze Tracking

**Concept:** Extend proactive content delivery by incorporating user gaze tracking to predictively pre-fetch content *within* a webpage, not just embedded resources. This moves beyond anticipating *what* will be loaded, to anticipating *where* the user will look, and pre-rendering or pre-fetching those specific areas of a page.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Client-Side:**  Gaze tracking sensor (integrated into device screen or via external peripheral â€“ e.g., Tobii eye tracker).  Minimal processing overhead required on the client, leveraging existing network connections.
*   **Server-Side:** Increased server capacity to handle more concurrent pre-fetch requests. Robust caching mechanisms.  A module to interpret gaze data and map it to specific content blocks within a webpage.

**II. Software Components:**

*   **Client-Side Gaze Tracker Integration:** A Javascript library to interface with the gaze tracker and capture gaze coordinates (x, y) relative to the screen.  Sample rate configurable (e.g., 30-60 Hz).  Data smoothing/filtering algorithms to reduce jitter.
*   **Page Structure Analyzer:** Javascript module to parse the DOM of a webpage.  Identifies distinct content blocks (sections, images, videos, interactive elements). Stores this data as a structured object representing the page layout. Content blocks will be tagged with priority levels (High, Medium, Low) based on their position on the page (above the fold, etc.).
*   **Gaze-to-Content Mapping:** A Javascript function that takes gaze coordinates and the page structure object as input. Determines which content block the user is currently looking at. Uses a tolerance value to account for imprecision in gaze tracking.
*   **Predictive Prefetch Engine:**  A Javascript module that analyzes gaze patterns.  Maintains a buffer of recent gaze locations. Uses a simple prediction algorithm (e.g., weighted average of recent gaze locations) to estimate the next likely gaze location. Based on this prediction, requests content for the predicted location *before* the user actually looks there.  Requests are throttled to prevent overwhelming the network or server.
*   **Server-Side Content Delivery Module:**  A server-side module that receives pre-fetch requests.  Checks if the requested content is already cached.  If not, retrieves or generates the content.  Sends the content back to the client.
*   **Authentication/Token Handling:** Reuse the existing authentication token mechanism from the provided patent to ensure secure pre-fetching.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  User navigates to a webpage.
2.  Client-side Javascript initializes the gaze tracker and the page structure analyzer.
3.  The page structure analyzer parses the DOM and creates a structured representation of the page layout.
4.  The gaze tracker begins capturing gaze coordinates.
5.  The gaze-to-content mapping function determines which content block the user is currently looking at.
6.  The predictive prefetch engine analyzes gaze patterns and estimates the next likely gaze location.
7.  The predictive prefetch engine sends a pre-fetch request to the server for the content associated with the predicted location. The request includes the authentication token.
8.  The server retrieves or generates the content and sends it back to the client.
9.  The client stores the content in a cache.
10. When the user actually looks at the predicted location, the content is already available in the cache, resulting in a faster loading experience.

**IV. Pseudocode (Predictive Prefetch Engine):**

```pseudocode
function predictNextGazeLocation(gazeHistory, pageStructure) {
  // Calculate weighted average of recent gaze locations
  predictedX = 0
  predictedY = 0
  totalWeight = 0

  for (i = 0; i < gazeHistory.length; i++) {
    weight = gazeHistory.length - i // Newer gaze locations have higher weight
    predictedX += gazeHistory[i].x * weight
    predictedY += gazeHistory[i].y * weight
    totalWeight += weight
  }

  predictedX = predictedX / totalWeight
  predictedY = predictedY / totalWeight

  // Map predicted coordinates to content blocks
  closestContentBlock = findClosestContentBlock(predictedX, predictedY, pageStructure)

  return closestContentBlock
}

function findClosestContentBlock(x, y, pageStructure) {
  closestBlock = null
  minDistance = Infinity

  for (block in pageStructure.contentBlocks) {
    distance = calculateDistance(x, y, block.x, block.y)
    if (distance < minDistance) {
      minDistance = distance
      closestBlock = block
    }
  }

  return closestBlock
}
```

**V.  Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Prefetching:** Dynamically adjust the prefetch aggressiveness based on network conditions and user behavior.
*   **Content Prioritization:** Prioritize prefetching based on content type (e.g., prefetch images before text).
*   **Personalization:** Tailor prefetching based on user preferences and browsing history.
*   **Server-Side Machine Learning:** Use machine learning algorithms on the server to predict user gaze patterns more accurately.
