## Dynamic Schema Reconciliation for Multi-Modal Relationship Scoring

**System Overview:**

This system extends the existing multi-modal relationship scoring by introducing a dynamic schema reconciliation layer *prior* to feature generation. The core innovation is to address the challenges posed by differing schemas between entity records – a point explicitly mentioned in claim 5 – by proactively aligning attributes before feature extraction begins.  This allows for more robust and accurate scoring even with disparate data sources.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Schema Analyzer Module:**
    *   Input: Two entity records (Record A, Record B).
    *   Process:
        *   Automatically detects all attributes present in each record.
        *   Identifies attribute types (text, image, numeric, etc.).
        *   Determines semantic similarity between attributes using a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, Sentence Transformers) considering both attribute names and data samples (if available).  A similarity score is assigned to each potential attribute pairing between Record A and Record B.
        *   Outputs: A schema mapping table defining corresponding attributes between Record A and Record B, weighted by the semantic similarity score. Attributes with low similarity are flagged as potential schema mismatches.

2.  **Dynamic Attribute Projection Layer:**
    *   Input:  Record A, Record B, Schema Mapping Table.
    *   Process:
        *   Based on the Schema Mapping Table, projects attributes from Record A and Record B onto a *common* schema.
        *   For high-similarity attribute pairings: Direct mapping of attribute values.
        *   For low-similarity pairings:  Utilizes a learned transformation function (a small neural network) to convert the attribute value from one record to the format of the other.  This network is trained as part of the overall system, learning to ‘translate’ attribute values across schemas.
        *   Handles missing attributes in either record by imputing values using a separate imputation network trained on the overall dataset.
        *   Outputs:  Two projected entity records, both conforming to the common schema.

3.  **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The Dynamic Attribute Projection Layer is inserted *before* the text and image feature set generation stages detailed in claims 1, 6 and 16.
    *   The projected entity records are then fed into the existing feature extraction and machine learning pipeline.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def reconcile_schemas(record_a, record_b):
  """Reconciles schemas of two entity records."""

  schema_analyzer = SchemaAnalyzer()
  mapping_table = schema_analyzer.analyze(record_a, record_b)

  projection_layer = ProjectionLayer(mapping_table)
  projected_record_a, projected_record_b = projection_layer.project(record_a, record_b)

  return projected_record_a, projected_record_b

def schema_analyzer_analyze(record_a, record_b):
  # Detect attributes in each record
  attributes_a = detect_attributes(record_a)
  attributes_b = detect_attributes(record_b)

  # Calculate similarity between attributes
  similarity_matrix = calculate_attribute_similarity(attributes_a, attributes_b)

  # Create mapping table based on similarity
  mapping_table = create_mapping_table(similarity_matrix)

  return mapping_table

def projection_layer_project(record_a, record_b):
  # For each attribute in record_a and record_b
  # If a mapping exists in the mapping_table
  # Apply transformation function if necessary
  # Otherwise, impute a value

  return projected_record_a, projected_record_b
```

**Training Data:**

*   A large dataset of entity record pairs with known schema variations.
*   Ground truth data indicating the correct attribute mappings.

**Expected Benefits:**

*   Improved accuracy of relationship scoring, especially for records with disparate schemas.
*   Increased robustness of the system to schema drift and data inconsistencies.
*   Ability to integrate data from a wider range of sources without extensive schema harmonization efforts.
