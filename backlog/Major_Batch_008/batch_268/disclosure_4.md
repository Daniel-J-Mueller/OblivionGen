## Adaptive Compression Granularity via Neural Architecture Search

**Concept:** Extend the compression profile search to dynamically adjust the granularity of compression applied to different layers *within* a single neural network. Current approaches typically treat compression as a whole-network operation (e.g., pruning all layers by a certain percentage). This design explores optimizing compression *at the layer level*, guided by a reinforcement learning agent performing a Neural Architecture Search (NAS).

**Specification:**

**I. System Components:**

1.  **Compression Profile Search Agent (RL Agent):** A Reinforcement Learning agent (e.g., Proximal Policy Optimization - PPO).  The *action space* of the agent defines the compression strategy for each layer.  Actions could be:
    *   `No Compression`
    *   `Pruning (percentage)` - Specifies the percentage of weights to prune.
    *   `Quantization (bits)` - Specifies the number of bits to use for quantization.
    *   `Knowledge Distillation (rate)` -  Specifies the rate for knowledge distillation from a wider, original network.
    *   `Layer Removal` - Completely removes the layer (requires network retraining, treated as a high-cost action).
2.  **Compressed Network Evaluator:**  A module responsible for compressing a network based on the action taken by the RL agent and evaluating its performance on a validation dataset. This includes:
    *   Applying the specified compression technique (pruning, quantization, distillation, removal) to the target layer.
    *   Fine-tuning the compressed network (briefly) to recover accuracy.
    *   Measuring performance metrics (accuracy, latency, model size).
3.  **Reward Function:** Defines the reward signal for the RL agent. This is critical. Example:
    *   `Reward = Accuracy - λ * (Latency + ModelSize)` where `λ` is a weighting factor.  The weighting factor will be extremely sensitive to the user's end goal.
    *   Incorporate a penalty for layer removal to discourage excessive simplification.
4.  **Compression Policy Storage:**  A database to store the compression policies learned by the RL agent. These policies can be retrieved and applied to new models.

**II. Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
# Initialization
RL_Agent = Initialize_RL_Agent()
Compression_Policy_DB = Initialize_DB()
Validation_Dataset = Load_Validation_Dataset()
Original_Model = Load_Original_Model()

# Training Loop
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    Current_Model = Clone(Original_Model) #Start each episode with a fresh clone
    State = Get_Network_State(Current_Model)  # Features like layer types, sizes, connections
    
    for layer_index in range(num_layers):
        Action = RL_Agent.Select_Action(State)  # Based on current network state
        Apply_Compression(Current_Model, layer_index, Action)
        State = Get_Network_State(Current_Model) # Update network state
        
    Performance = Evaluate_Model(Current_Model, Validation_Dataset)
    Reward = Calculate_Reward(Performance)
    RL_Agent.Update_Policy(Reward)

    #Store best policy seen so far
    if Performance > Best_Performance:
      Best_Performance = Performance
      Best_Policy = Get_Compression_Policy(Current_Model)
      Store_Policy(Compression_Policy_DB, Best_Policy)

#Output: Best_Policy - a layer-wise compression strategy.
```

**III. Operational Details:**

*   **Layer-Wise Compression:** The RL agent makes compression decisions for *each* layer of the network independently.
*   **Dynamic Granularity:** The system dynamically adjusts the granularity of compression. Some layers might be heavily pruned, others quantized, and some left untouched.
*   **Transfer Learning:** The learned compression policies can be transferred to new networks with similar architectures.
*    **User Control:** The user defines the weighting factors (λ) in the reward function to prioritize different metrics (accuracy, latency, model size).
