## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & ‘Shadowing’

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting notification priority *and* creating 'shadow' copies of notifications for secondary analysis/AI training, based on user behavior and predicted action likelihood.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent describes a system for delivering actionable notifications. This builds on that by introducing a layer of intelligent prioritization *and* a mechanism for passively learning from how users interact with those notifications. It’s not just about *getting* the notification to the user, but ensuring the *right* notification reaches them at the *right* time, and gathering data for future improvements.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Engine:** Monitors user interactions with the notification system. This includes:
    *   **Response Time:** How quickly a user responds to notifications.
    *   **Action Completion:**  Whether the user completes the action suggested by the notification.
    *   **Notification Dismissal:** How often notifications are dismissed without action.
    *   **Contextual Data:** Time of day, location (if permitted), current tasks, calendar events – anything that might influence user availability/interest.
2.  **Priority Algorithm:**  Uses the data from the Behavioral Engine to dynamically adjust the priority of incoming notifications.  This is *not* a simple rule-based system. It should employ a machine learning model (e.g., a Reinforcement Learning agent) that learns to predict the likelihood of a positive response based on user behavior and notification characteristics.
3.  **Notification Shadowing:**  A mechanism to create a ‘shadow’ copy of each notification before it's delivered to the user. This shadow copy contains:
    *   The full notification content.
    *   Timestamps of key events (e.g., notification creation, delivery, open, action completion).
    *   User context data (as collected by the Behavioral Engine).
    *   Priority score assigned by the Priority Algorithm.
4.  **AI Training Pipeline:**  The shadowed notification data is fed into an AI training pipeline to:
    *   Improve the accuracy of the Priority Algorithm.
    *   Identify patterns in user behavior.
    *   Personalize notification content.
    *   Predict future user needs.

**Pseudocode (Priority Algorithm Update):**

```
// Input: New Notification, User Profile, Historical Notification Data
function calculatePriority(notification, user, history) {
    // Feature Extraction
    features = extractFeatures(notification, user, history) // includes notification content, user context, past response rates, time sensitivity etc

    // ML Model Prediction
    priorityScore = mlModel.predict(features) // Reinforcement Learning agent predicts likelihood of positive interaction

    // Adjust based on urgency (optional)
    if (notification.urgency == "high") {
        priorityScore = priorityScore * 1.5
    }

    //Cap priority score
    priorityScore = min(priorityScore, 1.0)
    
    return priorityScore
}
```

**System Architecture:**

*   The Behavioral Engine runs as a separate service, collecting data from the notification system and user activity logs.
*   The Priority Algorithm is integrated into the notification service, dynamically adjusting notification priority before delivery.
*   The Notification Shadowing mechanism duplicates each notification, storing the shadow copy in a separate data store.
*   The AI Training Pipeline periodically processes the shadowed notification data to improve the Priority Algorithm.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased user engagement.
*   Reduced notification fatigue.
*   Improved task completion rates.
*   More personalized user experience.
*   Data-driven insights into user behavior.

**Expansion:** The system could be extended to support different notification channels (e.g., email, SMS, push notifications) and adapt the priority algorithm for each channel.
