## Dynamic History Buffer Segmentation & Adaptive Compression

**Concept:** Expand upon the history buffer concept by introducing dynamic segmentation *within* the buffer itself, coupled with an adaptive compression algorithm selection based on segment characteristics. This moves beyond a single 'depth' value for reading and introduces a more granular and intelligent approach to data compression.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   History Buffer: Modified to be logically segmented. Physical implementation could utilize a multi-banked memory architecture or address space partitioning. Segment count configurable (e.g., 4, 8, 16, 32).
    *   Segment Metadata Store: Small RAM associated with each segment, storing:
        *   Segment Fill Level: Percentage of segment occupied with valid data.
        *   Data Entropy: Calculated entropy value of data within the segment.
        *   Compression Algorithm ID: Identifier for the algorithm currently applied to the segment.
    *   Compression Engine Array: Multiple hardware compression/decompression engines, each implementing a different algorithm (LZ, Huffman, Run-Length Encoding, etc.).
    *   Control Unit: Manages segment allocation, data routing, algorithm selection, and metadata updates.
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Segment Allocation Policy: Determines how incoming data is distributed among segments.  Policies could include:
        *   Round Robin: Distribute data sequentially.
        *   Entropy-Based: Place data with similar entropy in the same segment.
        *   Fill Level-Based: Balance data distribution to prevent overflow.
    *   Adaptive Algorithm Selection: Based on segment entropy and/or data characteristics, the Control Unit selects the most efficient compression algorithm for that segment. Algorithm selection table configurable at runtime.
    *   Metadata Update Routine: Calculates entropy, updates fill levels, and logs algorithm ID for each segment.
    *   Read/Write Interface: Manages data access to segments, providing an abstraction layer to the compression/decompression process.

**Operation:**

1.  Incoming data is processed by the Segment Allocation Policy.
2.  Data is written to the assigned segment in the History Buffer.
3.  The Metadata Update Routine calculates segment entropy and updates the Segment Metadata Store.
4.  The Adaptive Algorithm Selection routine determines the optimal compression algorithm for the segment.
5.  Data is compressed/decompressed using the selected algorithm.
6.  During read operations, the Control Unit identifies the segment containing the requested data and utilizes the corresponding compression/decompression algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Algorithm Selection):**

```
function select_algorithm(segment_entropy):
  if segment_entropy < 0.5:
    return RLE // Run-Length Encoding
  else if segment_entropy < 1.0:
    return Huffman
  else:
    return LZ // Lempel-Ziv
```

**Innovation:** This design moves beyond a fixed history buffer read depth and introduces a dynamic, segmented approach, allowing the compression engine to adapt to varying data characteristics *within* the history itself. This increases compression efficiency and reduces processing overhead by utilizing the most appropriate algorithm for each segment. Furthermore, the ability to configure the segment count and allocation policy provides flexibility for different applications and data types.
