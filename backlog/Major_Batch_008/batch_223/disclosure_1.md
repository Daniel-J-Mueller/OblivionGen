## Dynamic Parameter Profiles Based on User Behavioral Clustering

**Concept:** Extend adaptive bitrate selection beyond session-level adjustments to incorporate long-term user behavior patterns. Instead of solely optimizing parameters per session, build dynamic user profiles based on clustering of viewing habits and apply those profiles to predict optimal bitrate settings *before* a session begins.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Data Sources:** Streaming history (content ID, duration viewed, timestamps), device type, network conditions (estimated bandwidth, latency, packet loss), geographic location, time of day, user-defined preferences (if available).
*   **Feature Vector:** Create a feature vector for each user. Key features:
    *   *Content Genre Affinity:* Frequency of viewing specific content genres.
    *   *Viewing Time Patterns:* Hours of day/days of week with highest activity.
    *   *Device/Network Profile:*  Commonly used devices and network types.
    *   *Buffering Tolerance:* Average buffering duration and frequency. (derived from historical data).
    *   *Resolution Preference:* Preferred playback resolution (if user-selectable).
    *   *Completion Rate:* Percentage of videos watched to completion.
    *   *Skip Pattern:* Frequency and location of skips within content.
*   **Data Aggregation:** Aggregate data over a rolling window (e.g., 30 days) to capture evolving user behavior.

**2. User Clustering:**

*   **Algorithm:** Implement a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical Clustering) to group users with similar behavioral patterns.
*   **Cluster Characteristics:** Each cluster represents a distinct user segment (e.g., "Mobile Commuters," "Home Entertainment Buffs," "Casual Viewers").
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Periodically re-evaluate cluster assignments based on new data.  Implement a threshold for changes in user features before triggering a re-clustering.

**3. Parameter Profile Generation:**

*   **Offline Training:** For each cluster, conduct offline training using historical data to determine optimal bitrate parameter settings (initial quality level, maximum quality level, minimum quality level, buffer size, etc.).  Use a reward function that maximizes average quality delivered while minimizing rebuffering events and time to first frame.
*   **Profile Storage:** Store the optimized parameter profiles for each cluster in a lookup table.
*   **Real-time Application:**
    *   Upon session initiation, identify the user's cluster based on their features.
    *   Apply the corresponding parameter profile to the adaptive bitrate selection algorithm.

**4. Adaptive Fine-tuning (Hybrid Approach):**

*   **Initial Profile Application:** Begin the session using the cluster-based parameter profile.
*   **Session-Level Adjustment:** Continue to monitor playback performance during the session (rebuffer rate, average quality, etc.).
*   **Blending:** Blend the cluster-based profile with the traditional session-level adjustments. Give higher weight to the cluster-based profile initially, and gradually shift weight to session-level adjustments as the session progresses.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function initialize_session(user_id, content_id):
    user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
    cluster_id = assign_user_to_cluster(user_profile)
    cluster_profile = get_cluster_profile(cluster_id)

    //Initial bitrate parameters
    initial_quality = cluster_profile.initial_quality
    max_quality = cluster_profile.max_quality
    buffer_size = cluster_profile.buffer_size

    //Apply initial parameters to ABR algorithm

function monitor_session(rebuffer_rate, avg_quality):
    //Calculate a 'drift' value based on performance deviation
    drift = calculate_drift(rebuffer_rate, avg_quality)

    //Blend cluster parameters with session-level adjustments
    weight_cluster = 1 - drift
    weight_session = drift

    //Adjust bitrate parameters based on blended weights
    new_initial_quality = (weight_cluster * cluster_profile.initial_quality) + (weight_session * session_abrt_adjustments.initial_quality)
    //Similar adjustments for other parameters
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved user experience through proactive optimization.
*   Reduced buffering and improved quality.
*   More efficient bandwidth utilization.
*   Personalized streaming experience.
*   Faster startup times.
