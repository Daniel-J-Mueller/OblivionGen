## Dynamic Key Rotation with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:**

**I. System Overview:**

This system augments the existing multi-layered encryption scheme with a dynamic key rotation mechanism tied to user behavioral biometrics. The goal is to enhance security beyond static key management by linking key access and rotation to *how* a user interacts with the system, not just *who* they are.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Biometric Module:**  This module continuously collects and analyzes user interaction data.  Data points include:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, duration).
    *   Mouse movement (speed, acceleration, patterns).
    *   Scrolling behavior.
    *   Touchscreen gestures (if applicable).
    *   Application usage patterns (time of day, frequently used features).

2.  **Risk Engine:**  A machine learning model that processes the behavioral biometric data to assess user risk.  The model is trained on a baseline of "normal" behavior for each user. Deviations from this baseline contribute to a risk score.

3.  **Key Management Service (KMS):**  Existing KMS is extended to support dynamic key rotation requests.

4.  **Data Storage System:** The existing storage system, as described in the provided patent, remains in place.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Baseline Establishment:**  During initial use, the Behavioral Biometric Module establishes a baseline of typical user behavior.

2.  **Continuous Monitoring:**  The Behavioral Biometric Module continuously monitors user interactions, updating the baseline over time.

3.  **Risk Assessment:**  The Risk Engine calculates a risk score based on deviations from the baseline.

4.  **Dynamic Key Rotation Trigger:**
    *   **High Risk:** If the risk score exceeds a predefined threshold, a key rotation is *immediately* triggered.  The system requests new first and second cryptographic keys from the KMS.
    *   **Scheduled Rotation:** Even with low risk, keys are rotated on a scheduled basis (e.g., every 30 days) to limit the impact of a potential breach.
    *   **Adaptive Rotation:** The rotation schedule is dynamically adjusted based on the userâ€™s risk score. Higher risk scores lead to more frequent rotations.

5.  **Key Propagation:**  The new keys are propagated to the Data Storage System and used for future encryption/decryption operations.  The system supports seamless key transitions to minimize disruption.

**IV. Pseudocode (Key Rotation Trigger):**

```pseudocode
function triggerKeyRotation(userID):
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(userID)

  if riskScore > HIGH_RISK_THRESHOLD:
    // Immediate Rotation
    newFirstKey = requestNewKey(KEY_TYPE.FIRST)
    newSecondKey = requestNewKey(KEY_TYPE.SECOND)
    propagateKeys(newFirstKey, newSecondKey)
  else if (currentTime - lastRotationTime > scheduledRotationInterval) or (adaptiveRotationIntervalBasedOnRiskScore(riskScore)):
    // Scheduled or Adaptive Rotation
    newFirstKey = requestNewKey(KEY_TYPE.FIRST)
    newSecondKey = requestNewKey(KEY_TYPE.SECOND)
    propagateKeys(newFirstKey, newSecondKey)
    lastRotationTime = currentTime

function calculateRiskScore(userID):
  // Analyze behavioral biometric data for deviations from baseline
  // Returns a numerical risk score
  // Uses machine learning model trained on user behavior
  riskScore = ML_MODEL.predict(behavioralData)
  return riskScore
```

**V.  Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication Integration:**  Combine behavioral biometrics with traditional MFA methods for increased security.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Implement anomaly detection algorithms to identify unusual user behavior that may indicate a compromised account.
*   **Federated Learning:**  Train the machine learning model using federated learning techniques to improve accuracy without compromising user privacy.
*   **Key Sharding:** Apply key sharding techniques in conjunction with the dynamic key rotation to further enhance security and resilience.
