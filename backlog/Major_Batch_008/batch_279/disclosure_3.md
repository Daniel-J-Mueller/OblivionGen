## Dynamic Scene Graph Generation for Cross-Modal Retrieval

**Concept:** Extend the feature matching paradigm to incorporate temporal information and relationships *between* objects within a scene, creating a dynamic scene graph. This graph isn’t just about identifying *what* objects are present, but *how* they interact and change over time, enabling richer cross-modal retrieval (e.g., finding a video clip matching a text description involving object interactions).

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Input:**

*   **Multi-modal streams:** Video (image sequences), audio (optional), text descriptions.
*   **Frame rate:** Variable, adaptable based on input video.
*   **Text input:** Natural language descriptions of scenes or events.

**2. Feature Extraction & Object Detection:**

*   **Encoder Network:** Utilize a pre-trained convolutional neural network (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet) for initial feature extraction from video frames.
*   **Object Detection Module:** Integrate an object detection model (e.g., YOLO, Faster R-CNN) to identify and localize objects within each frame.  Output: Bounding boxes, class labels, confidence scores.
*   **Temporal Smoothing:** Apply a Kalman filter or similar temporal smoothing technique to object bounding box coordinates to reduce jitter and improve tracking consistency.

**3. Dynamic Scene Graph Construction:**

*   **Node Creation:** Each detected object instance is represented as a node in the scene graph. Node attributes: Class label, confidence score, bounding box coordinates, temporal ID (unique identifier across frames).
*   **Edge Creation:**  Edges represent relationships between objects. Relationship types:
    *   **Spatial:** "above," "below," "left of," "right of," "near," "far." Determined by bounding box overlap and relative positions.
    *   **Interaction:** "pushing," "holding," "looking at," "running towards." Determined by motion analysis and object proximity.  Utilize an LSTM or Transformer network to analyze object trajectories and predict interactions.
    *   **Temporal:** "precedes," "follows."  Established by the order of object appearances and interactions across frames.
*   **Graph Representation:**  Use a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store and manage the dynamic scene graph.

**4. Cross-Modal Embedding & Retrieval:**

*   **Node Embedding:**  Learn vector embeddings for each node based on its attributes and connections in the graph. Utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) – specifically Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) or Graph Attention Networks (GATs) – to aggregate information from neighboring nodes and generate context-aware embeddings.
*   **Text Embedding:**  Utilize a pre-trained language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to generate vector embeddings for the input text description.
*   **Similarity Calculation:**  Calculate the cosine similarity between the text embedding and the node embeddings.
*   **Retrieval:**  Rank the nodes (and corresponding video frames) based on their similarity scores. Return the top-N ranked frames as the retrieval results.

**5. System Architecture:**

```
[Video Input] --> [Feature Extraction & Object Detection] --> [Temporal Smoothing] --> [Dynamic Scene Graph Construction]
[Text Input] --> [Text Embedding]
[Dynamic Scene Graph] + [Text Embedding] --> [Similarity Calculation] --> [Retrieval Results]
```

**6. Pseudocode (Graph Construction):**

```
FOR each frame in video:
    detect objects in frame
    FOR each detected object:
        create node with object attributes
        link node to previous frame's corresponding node (if exists)
    FOR each pair of objects:
        determine spatial relationship
        determine interaction (if any)
        create edge between nodes representing the relationship
```

**7. Future Extensions:**

*   **3D Scene Reconstruction:** Integrate with 3D reconstruction techniques to generate a 3D scene graph.
*   **Reasoning & Inference:** Implement reasoning algorithms to infer implicit relationships and events.
*   **Active Learning:**  Utilize active learning to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the system.
*   **Audio Integration**: Analyze audio streams for sound events (e.g., "breaking," "laughing") and incorporate them as nodes/edges in the scene graph.
