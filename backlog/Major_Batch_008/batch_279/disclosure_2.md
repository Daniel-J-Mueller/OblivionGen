## Adaptive Resource Prefetching via Predictive Popularity & User Behavior

**Specification:** A system designed to proactively fetch resource variations *before* a user requests them, leveraging a multi-layered predictive model combining global popularity data with individual user behavior patterns.  This goes beyond simply caching based on popularity – it anticipates *which variations* a user is most likely to need.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Profile Builder (BPB):** Operates on the client-side. Tracks user interactions with resources – not just requests, but dwell time, scrolling depth, zoom levels, mouse movements (indicating focus), and any explicit user actions (e.g., selecting different options). This data is anonymized and aggregated.
2.  **Predictive Popularity Engine (PPE):** Server-side. Combines global popularity data (similar to the provided patent's approach) with data from the BPB (aggregated across all users).  It generates a "variation probability vector" for each resource. This vector represents the likelihood of a user requesting each available variation (e.g., different resolutions of an image, different language versions of text, different data granularities).  Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model time-series data of resource requests & behavioral patterns.
3.  **Prefetching Agent (PA):** Client-side. Receives the variation probability vector from the PPE.  Maintains a local "prefetch queue" – a prioritized list of resource variations to fetch.  Based on the vector, the PA proactively requests the top *N* most likely variations, caching them locally.  The queue is dynamically updated based on user interactions.
4.  **Resource Variation Manifest (RVM):** A server-side component which is the authoritative source of truth for what resource variations exist. RVM allows for dynamic addition of resource variations without client-side code updates.  The client requests the RVM periodically to stay synchronized.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Agent – simplified):**

```
// Initialization
RVM = fetchResourceVariationManifest();
prefetchQueue = [];

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    variationProbabilityVector = fetchVariationProbabilityVector(resourceID);
    
    // Prioritize variations based on probability
    prioritizedVariations = sortVariationsByProbability(variationProbabilityVector);
    
    // Update prefetch queue
    for (variation in prioritizedVariations) {
        if (variation not in prefetchQueue && variation not in localCache) {
            prefetchQueue.add(variation);
        }
    }
    
    // Fetch variations from queue (limited concurrency)
    while (prefetchQueue.size() > 0 && concurrentRequests < maxConcurrentRequests) {
        nextVariation = prefetchQueue.removeFirst();
        fetchResource(nextVariation);
        concurrentRequests++;
    }
    
    // Handle completed requests
    onResourceFetched(resource) {
        concurrentRequests--;
        localCache.add(resource);
    }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `VariationProbabilityVector`:  Array of floats, where index represents a specific resource variation, and value represents its probability.
*   `ResourceVariationManifest`:  JSON object mapping resource IDs to available variations and metadata (e.g., file size, content type).

**Novelty:**

This differs from standard caching by:

*   **Proactive Prefetching of *Variations*:** It anticipates which specific variations a user will need, not just the resource itself.
*   **Behavioral Integration:**  User behavior directly influences the prefetch queue, creating a personalized experience.
*   **Dynamic Variation Discovery:**  The RVM enables the server to introduce new resource variations without requiring client-side updates.
*    **RNN Predictive Model:** Incorporating temporal data into the prediction algorithm.

This system aims to reduce latency and improve user experience by proactively delivering the content users are most likely to need, even before they request it.  It is adaptable to a wide range of content types and applications.
