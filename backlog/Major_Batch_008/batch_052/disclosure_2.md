## Adaptive Multi-Sensor Fusion for Anomaly Localization

**System Overview:** A distributed network integrating imaging data with environmental sensor data (temperature, humidity, vibration) to pinpoint the *source* of imaging anomalies, moving beyond simple device failure detection.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of solely analyzing images *from* the devices, this system creates a dynamic environmental “map” correlated with imaging quality. Anomalies aren’t just *detected*, they’re spatially localized within the environment.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Imaging Array:** Existing or new array of imaging devices (cameras).
*   **Distributed Sensor Network:** Wireless sensor nodes deployed alongside imaging devices measuring temperature, humidity, vibration, and potentially light levels. Each node has a unique ID.
*   **Edge Computing Units:** Small, low-power computers physically close to imaging/sensor nodes for preliminary data processing.
*   **Central Processing Server:** High-performance server for data aggregation, model training, and anomaly reporting.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Sensor Data Aggregation Module:** Collects data from the wireless sensor network and timestamps it precisely with corresponding imaging data. Each data point is tagged with sensor ID and location.
2.  **Environmental Map Builder:** Creates a multi-dimensional “map” of the environment based on sensor data. This map is continuously updated in real-time. The map isn’t a visual representation, but a data structure capturing environmental conditions at specific locations.
3.  **Anomaly Correlation Engine:**  The core of the system. Uses a modified Support Vector Machine (SVM) – a multi-class ranking SVM trained not on image data *alone*, but on the *correlation* between image quality metrics (descriptors from the provided patent - Laplacian variance, gradient sums, etc.) *and* environmental conditions.  The training data includes instances of known anomalies (e.g., a camera obscured by condensation, a lens covered in dust) paired with the corresponding environmental readings at the time of the anomaly.
4.  **Localization Algorithm:** When an anomaly is detected by the Anomaly Correlation Engine, the Localization Algorithm uses the environmental map to *estimate* the physical location of the anomaly source. This is achieved using a weighted averaging approach. Sensor readings closest to the anomaly source (as determined by the SVM) will have the highest weight.
5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  Anomaly detection thresholds aren’t fixed. They’re adjusted dynamically based on the current environmental conditions. For example, the system will tolerate more image noise in a high-humidity environment than in a dry environment.

**Pseudocode (Localization Algorithm):**

```
function localizeAnomaly(imageData, environmentalMap, svmOutput):
  // svmOutput contains anomaly probability and weighted sensor IDs
  anomalyProbability = svmOutput.anomalyProbability
  weightedSensorIDs = svmOutput.weightedSensorIDs

  // Calculate estimated location based on weighted sensor IDs
  estimatedLocationX = 0
  estimatedLocationY = 0
  totalWeight = 0

  for sensorID in weightedSensorIDs:
    sensorLocation = environmentalMap.getSensorLocation(sensorID)
    weight = weightedSensorIDs[sensorID]

    estimatedLocationX += sensorLocation.x * weight
    estimatedLocationY += sensorLocation.y * weight
    totalWeight += weight

  estimatedLocationX /= totalWeight
  estimatedLocationY /= totalWeight

  return (estimatedLocationX, estimatedLocationY, anomalyProbability)
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Large-Scale Surveillance Systems:** Quickly identify obstructions or failures in camera networks.
*   **Environmental Monitoring:** Detect sources of pollution or contamination.
*   **Industrial Inspection:** Locate defects or damage in manufacturing processes.
*   **Agriculture:** Identify areas of crop stress or disease.
