## Dynamic Haptic Feedback System – ‘Sensory Layers’

**Core Concept:** Augment the visual parallax and occlusion effects described in the patent with localized haptic feedback delivered through a dynamically configurable surface integrated into the display device. This creates a multi-sensory experience enhancing the perception of depth and object interaction.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Display Integration:** A transparent, flexible haptic layer overlaying the existing display screen. This layer will consist of an array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar). Resolution: Minimum 60 actuators per inch.
*   **Actuator Control:** Each micro-actuator can independently adjust its height/pressure, creating localized tactile sensations. Range of motion: 0-2mm. Force output: adjustable from 0-500mN.
*   **Depth Mapping:** A real-time depth map is generated from the camera feed, analyzing scene geometry and object distances. This map is used to drive the haptic layer.
*   **Parallax-Driven Haptics:** As the user’s viewing angle changes (detected by the camera), the haptic layer dynamically adjusts to simulate the feel of surfaces receding or approaching.  Edges of objects will exhibit a slight tactile ‘bump’ as the user’s perspective shifts.
*   **Occlusion Simulation:** When an object is visually occluded, the haptic layer *removes* tactile feedback from the obscured area, enhancing the realism of the visual effect.
*   **Material Simulation:** Different materials (wood, metal, fabric) are assigned haptic profiles. The system adjusts actuator stiffness and vibration patterns to mimic the texture and feel of these materials.
*   **Interaction Mapping:** System detects user touch (capacitive/pressure sensors integrated into the haptic layer). It provides appropriate tactile feedback for virtual button presses, object manipulation, and surface contact.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated processor responsible for: 1) Real-time image analysis; 2) Depth map generation; 3) Haptic profile management; 4) Actuator control.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (camera.isStreaming()) {
    image = camera.captureImage();
    depthMap = generateDepthMap(image);
    userLocation = analyzeImage(image);

    for (each pixel in depthMap) {
        distance = depthMap[pixel];
        if (distance > threshold) { // Pixel represents a surface
            hapticForce = calculateHapticForce(distance, userLocation);
            actuator[pixel].applyForce(hapticForce);
        } else {
            actuator[pixel].resetForce();
        }
    }

    // Handle touch input (if any)
    if (touchSensor.isPressed()) {
        // Apply appropriate haptic feedback
    }
}
```

**Expansion Paths:**

*   **Thermal Integration:** Add localized heating/cooling elements to simulate temperature changes.
*   **Air Jets:** Incorporate micro-air jets to create localized wind effects.
*   **Biometric Feedback:** Adjust haptic feedback based on user emotional state (detected through biometric sensors).
*   **Directional Haptics**: Use phased array of actuators to create sensations of movement *across* the surface, simulating textures.
