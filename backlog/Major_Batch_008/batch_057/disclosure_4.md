## Modular Sensor Housing with Haptic Feedback & Automated Calibration

**Concept:** A sensor housing system leveraging micro-actuators and a dynamic calibration routine for self-adjustment and precise measurement, packaged within a modular, easily customizable housing. This goes beyond simple mechanical adjustment â€“ it aims for automated, active control of sensor alignment.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing:** Constructed from interlocking, 3D-printable modules. Standard module sizes: 25mm x 25mm x 10mm. Modules connect via magnetic interlocking and optional micro-screws for higher rigidity. Material: Durable ABS or Polycarbonate blend. Multiple module types: blank, sensor mount, actuator mount, wiring channel, calibration port.
*   **Sensor Mount:** A universal mount accepting various sensor packages (photocell, IR, ultrasonic). Features a spherical joint allowing for 3-axis adjustment.
*   **Actuation:** Three micro-actuators (piezoelectric or miniature stepper motors) control the spherical joint. Each actuator corresponds to one axis of rotation (pitch, yaw, roll). Actuators are embedded within the sensor mount module. Resolution: 0.01 degrees.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Software-controlled routine. System initiates automated calibration upon power-up or manual request.
    1.  **Baseline Reading:** System takes an initial reading from the sensor.
    2.  **Iterative Adjustment:** Actuators incrementally adjust the sensor's orientation.
    3.  **Signal Optimization:** System monitors sensor output. Adjustments continue until signal strength/quality reaches a predefined maximum.
    4.  **Position Locking:** Once optimized, actuators engage a micro-locking mechanism, maintaining precise alignment.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Small vibration motors integrated into the housing provide tactile feedback during calibration and manual adjustment. Different vibration patterns indicate progress, optimization, or errors.
*   **Connectivity:** Micro-USB port for power and data communication. Supports I2C or SPI communication protocol.
*   **Power Requirements:** 5V DC, 500mA (peak during calibration).
*   **Calibration Data Storage:** Non-volatile memory (EEPROM) within the housing to store calibration parameters.
*   **Software API:** Provides functions for:
    *   Initiating/aborting calibration.
    *   Reading sensor data.
    *   Adjusting actuator positions manually.
    *   Reading/writing calibration data.
*   **Modular Expansion:** Provisions for adding modules with additional functionality (e.g., filters, lenses, LEDs).

**Pseudocode (Calibration Routine):**

```
FUNCTION calibrateSensor():
    INITIALIZE actuators
    INITIALIZE sensor
    SET calibrationStatus = "IN_PROGRESS"
    
    FOR each axis (pitch, yaw, roll):
        SET initialPosition = actuator.getCurrentPosition()
        
        WHILE signalStrength < optimalSignalStrength:
            actuator.move(increment)
            READ sensor data
            UPDATE signalStrength
            
            IF signalStrength decreases:
                actuator.move(-increment)  // Revert to previous position
                BREAK
                
        STORE optimalPosition for axis
        
    LOCK sensor in optimal position
    SET calibrationStatus = "COMPLETE"
    
    RETURN calibrationStatus
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Automated inspection systems.
*   Robotics and machine vision.
*   Precise positioning and alignment applications.
*   Environmental sensing.
*   Conveyor systems (as the patent describes) where dynamic adjustment is beneficial for varying object heights/positions.
