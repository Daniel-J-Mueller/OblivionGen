## Adaptive Texture Cover - Specification v0.1

**Concept:** An electronic device cover incorporating microfluidic channels and embedded, controllable micro-particles to dynamically alter the surface texture. This allows for customizable grip, aesthetics, and even haptic feedback.

**Materials:**

*   **Base Layer:** Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) – Flexible, durable, and compatible with microfluidic fabrication.
*   **Microfluidic Layer:**  Polymer microfluidic chip (PDMS or similar) bonded to the TPU. Channel dimensions: 50-200 microns width, 20-100 microns height. Channel density: 50-200 channels per cm².
*   **Micro-particles:**  Magnetic or electrostatically chargeable micro-spheres (10-50 microns diameter).  Different materials for varying texture/grip (e.g., silicone, rubber, ceramic).  Color-changing pigment encapsulation optional.
*   **Fluid:**  Non-conductive, low-viscosity fluid compatible with microfluidic channels and micro-particles.  Dielectric constant appropriate for electrostatic control.
*   **Electrodes/Magnets:** Micro-fabricated electrodes or embedded micro-magnets corresponding to channel segments.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Texture Control:** By applying a voltage or magnetic field to specific channel segments, micro-particles are selectively moved within the fluid, rising to or receding from the surface. This creates raised or lowered areas, altering the texture.
2.  **Grip Enhancement:**  Localized texture changes create areas of increased friction for improved grip. Users can customize grip patterns based on activity (e.g., raised bumps for gaming, smooth surface for pockets).
3.  **Haptic Feedback:**  Rapidly changing textures can provide localized haptic feedback for notifications or interactions.
4.  **Aesthetic Customization:** Micro-particles with different colors or reflective properties create dynamic patterns and visual effects.

**Pseudocode - Control System:**

```
// Define Channel Map - array of channel segment IDs
channel_map[segment_id] = { electrode_id, particle_type, default_height }

// Input - User preference or system event (e.g., notification)
function update_texture(segment_id, texture_level) {

  // texture_level: 0 (flush) to 1 (fully raised)

  // Calculate voltage/magnetic field strength based on texture_level
  field_strength = texture_level * max_field_strength

  // Apply field to corresponding electrode/magnet
  apply_field(channel_map[segment_id].electrode_id, field_strength)

}

// Example - Notification Feedback
function notification_received(notification_type) {
  // Define texture pattern for notification type
  pattern = get_notification_pattern(notification_type)

  // Iterate through pattern and update texture
  for each segment_id in pattern {
    update_texture(segment_id, 1) // Raise texture
    delay(50ms)
    update_texture(segment_id, 0) // Lower texture
  }
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Microfluidic channel fabrication precision.
*   Sealing of microfluidic layer to TPU base.
*   Power management for electrodes/magnets.
*   Fluid leak prevention.
*   Durability of micro-particles and fluid.
*   Software interface for texture customization.
