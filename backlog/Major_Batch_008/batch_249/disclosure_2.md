## Adaptive Notification 'Bubbles' & Spatial Audio Landscapes

**Concept:** Expand the contextual awareness beyond device proximity to incorporate a real-time, spatially-mapped audio and visual notification system. Imagine notifications aren’t just *delivered* to devices, but manifested as localized ‘bubbles’ within a user’s physical space, navigable through gesture or gaze.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of low-power, spatially-aware Bluetooth beacons (minimum 3, scalable) deployed within a defined space (home, office). Beacons continuously broadcast location data.
    *   Compatible devices (phones, tablets, smartwatches, AR/VR headsets) equipped with high-precision UWB (Ultra-Wideband) or similar location tracking capabilities for triangulation with the beacons.
    *   Spatial audio capable devices/headphones are required.
*   **Software – Core Logic (Pseudocode):**

    ```
    FUNCTION HandleIncomingNotification(notificationData)
    // 1. Contextual Analysis - Expand beyond proximity.
    userHeadPose = GetUserHeadPose() //From device cameras/AR/VR
    userGazeDirection = GetUserGazeDirection()
    nearbyDevices = GetNearbyDevices() // UWB triangulation
    activeApplication = GetActiveApplication() // What the user is currently doing.
    ambientSoundLevel = GetAmbientSoundLevel() // Microphone input

    // 2. Notification 'Bubble' Creation
    bubbleLocation = CalculateOptimalBubbleLocation(userHeadPose, userGazeDirection, nearbyDevices, activeApplication) //Prioritizes non-obtrusive locations
    bubbleSize = DetermineBubbleSize(notificationData.priority, ambientSoundLevel)
    bubbleVisual = GenerateBubbleVisual(notificationData.type, bubbleSize) // e.g. color, icon
    bubbleAudio = GenerateBubbleAudio(notificationData.type, bubbleSize) // spatialized sound.

    // 3. Spatial Audio Implementation
    spatializeAudio(bubbleAudio, bubbleLocation) // Pan, distance attenuation
    renderBubbleVisual(bubbleLocation, bubbleVisual) // AR overlay.

    // 4. User Interaction
    IF userGazeTouchesBubble THEN
        DisplayDetailedNotification() //Full message
    ELSE IF userGesturesTowardsBubble THEN
        AcknowledgeNotification() //Simple Dismissal.
    ENDIF
    END FUNCTION
    ```

*   **Notification Types & Bubble Manifestation:**
    *   **Critical Alerts (e.g., Emergency):** Large, pulsating red bubble with high-intensity siren-like audio, positioned directly in the user’s field of view.
    *   **Important Updates (e.g., Calendar Reminders):** Medium-sized, subtly animated blue bubble with gentle chime audio, positioned peripherally.
    *   **Passive Notifications (e.g., Social Media):** Small, fading green bubble with ambient soundscape integration (e.g., notification blended with existing music).
    *   **Context-Aware Bubbles:**  Bubbles that change behavior based on user activity. (e.g. a navigation alert is projected onto the 'road ahead' in AR while driving).
*   **Dynamic Bubble Landscapes:** Allow for creation of personalized ‘notification landscapes’ – visual and auditory environments that dynamically adapt to user preferences and context.  User can "pin" notifications to specific locations, or create custom audio themes.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  User control over data sharing and beacon visibility. Option to disable beacon tracking entirely.

**Potential:** Extends notification paradigms beyond the flat screen, immersing users in spatially-aware information flows. Reduces visual clutter, improves attention management, and creates more engaging and intuitive user experiences.
