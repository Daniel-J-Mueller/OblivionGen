## Dynamic Precision Systolic Array

**Concept:** Expand on the normalization aspect of the patent to create a systolic array that *dynamically* adjusts the precision of numbers flowing through it, based on observed data characteristics and potential error accumulation. This isn't just about handling denormals – it’s about optimizing precision *throughout* the calculation to minimize resource usage *and* maximize accuracy.

**Specifications:**

*   **Array Architecture:** Standard systolic array configuration with processing elements (PEs) arranged in rows and columns. Each PE contains a multiplier, adder, and a *precision control unit (PCU)*.

*   **Precision Control Unit (PCU):** The core innovation. Each PCU monitors the magnitude and variance of data flowing through its PE. It maintains a 'precision level' (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit) and controls the number of bits used in multiplication and addition within the PE.

*   **Dynamic Precision Adjustment:**
    *   **Variance Threshold:** If the variance of the data within a row/column exceeds a threshold, the PCU increases the precision level.  This prevents error accumulation in critical areas of the calculation.
    *   **Magnitude Threshold:** If the magnitude of the data falls below a threshold, the PCU *decreases* the precision level. This reduces resource consumption where high precision isn't necessary.
    *   **Adaptive Learning:** Implement a simple learning algorithm (e.g., moving average) within the PCU to dynamically adjust the variance and magnitude thresholds based on observed data patterns.

*   **Normalization/Denormal Handling:**  As in the original patent, the array includes input normalization logic to convert denormal numbers to normalized form.  *However*, the normalization process itself is also subject to precision control – lower precision normalization for less critical inputs.

*   **Data Format:** Floating-point representation with an exponent, significand, and sign bit. The significand's bit-length is controlled by the PCU.

*   **Communication:** PEs communicate data in a pipelined fashion.  Along with the data, each PE also transmits its current precision level to neighboring PEs. This allows for coordinated precision adjustments throughout the array.

**Pseudocode (PCU):**

```
function updatePrecision(dataValue, currentPrecision):
  variance = calculateVariance(dataStream)
  magnitude = abs(dataValue)

  if variance > varianceThreshold:
    newPrecision = min(currentPrecision + 1, maxPrecision) //Increase precision
  elif magnitude < magnitudeThreshold:
    newPrecision = max(currentPrecision - 1, minPrecision) //Decrease precision
  else:
    newPrecision = currentPrecision

  return newPrecision
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Hardware:** FPGA-based implementation is ideal for prototyping and experimentation.
*   **Software:**  A simulation environment to test different precision adjustment strategies and data patterns.
*   **Error Analysis:**  Thorough analysis of error accumulation and accuracy for different precision levels and data distributions.



**Potential Applications:**

*   Image and video processing.
*   Machine learning inference.
*   Scientific computing.
*   Edge computing devices with limited resources.
