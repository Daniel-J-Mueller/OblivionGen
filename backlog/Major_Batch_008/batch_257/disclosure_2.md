## Dynamic Volumetric Display Integration

**Concept:** Integrate the principles of light field/volumetric displays *within* the light guide system described in the provided patent. Instead of solely redirecting light *onto* a flat display, modulate the light *within* the light guide itself to create a 3D image that appears to float in front of or behind the primary display.

**Specs:**

*   **Light Guide Material:** Replace current light guide material with a dynamically controllable medium. Options include:
    *   **Micro-lens Array with Electrowetting:** An array of micro-lenses embedded within the light guide, each individually controllable via electrowetting. Changing the voltage alters the lens shape and thus the direction of light passing through it.
    *   **Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) Layer:** Integrate a thin-film SLM layer *into* the light guide material. This allows for precise control of light amplitude and phase at each point within the guide.
    *   **Holographic Polymer Dispersion (HPD) Volume:** Embed a volume of HPD material within the light guide. Illumination with a reference beam allows for holographic image creation within the guide.
*   **Light Source Array:** Replace the single/dual light source with a dense array of individually addressable micro-LEDs. This provides the spatial resolution needed to illuminate the dynamic light guide.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **Position Tracking:** Utilize the existing user position data from the patent.
    *   **3D Rendering Engine:** A real-time rendering engine generates a 3D image based on user viewpoint.
    *   **Light Field Calculation:** The engine calculates the light field required to create the 3D image.
    *   **Micro-LED/Electrowetting/SLM Control:** Software maps the calculated light field to the individual micro-LEDs or control signals for the electrowetting/SLM layer.
*   **Display Mode Selection:** Allow the user to switch between:
    *   **Traditional 2D Mode:** The system functions as described in the original patent, driving the flat display.
    *   **Volumetric Mode:** The system generates a 3D image within the light guide.
    *   **Hybrid Mode:** Combine 2D and 3D elements, projecting 2D information onto the 3D volumetric image.
*   **Reflective Backing/Polarization Filters:** Optimize the reflective backing and polarization filters to maximize perceived brightness and contrast of the volumetric image.

**Pseudocode (Volumetric Mode Rendering):**

```
// Input: User Position Data (x, y, z)
//        3D Scene Data (vertices, textures, materials)

function renderVolumetricImage() {
  // 1. Calculate View Matrix based on User Position
  viewMatrix = calculateViewMatrix(x, y, z);

  // 2. Render 3D Scene to Off-screen Buffer
  renderScene(sceneData, viewMatrix, offscreenBuffer);

  // 3. Ray Tracing within Light Guide
  for each voxel within lightGuideVolume {
    // Calculate ray from microLED/SLM through voxel
    ray = calculateRay(microLED/SLM position, voxel position);

    // Determine color contribution from offscreen buffer along ray
    color = sampleColor(offscreenBuffer, ray);

    // Set SLM/MicroLED intensity based on color
    setSLMIntensity(voxel position, color);
  }
}
```
