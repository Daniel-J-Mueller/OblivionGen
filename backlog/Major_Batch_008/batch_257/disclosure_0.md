## Dynamic Network Quarantine with Predictive Threat Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the beacon’s authentication and security policy enforcement to proactively quarantine potentially compromised devices *before* they fully connect to the network, leveraging predictive threat modeling based on device behavior and network context.

**Specs:**

**1. Beacon Enhancement – Threat Profiler Module:**

*   **Function:**  The beacon device integrates a "Threat Profiler" module. This module passively monitors network traffic *before* full device authentication, observing initial connection attempts (handshakes, DNS requests, etc.).
*   **Data Collection:**  Collects the following initial connection data:
    *   MAC Address
    *   DHCP Request Information (IP address requested, hostname)
    *   DNS Request Patterns (requests for known malicious domains, unusually high request rates)
    *   Initial Traffic Volume and Destination Ports
    *   Device Reported Capabilities (via initial broadcast – if possible, e.g., OS type, supported protocols)
*   **Threat Scoring:**  Assigns a threat score based on the collected data, using a configurable rule set (see section 3). The score represents the likelihood of the device being compromised.
*   **Quarantine Trigger:** If the threat score exceeds a predefined threshold, the beacon *immediately* initiates a "soft quarantine" for the device.

**2. Soft Quarantine Implementation:**

*   **Network Segmentation:** The beacon (in conjunction with the network infrastructure – see section 4) redirects the device to a restricted VLAN or a captive portal.
*   **Limited Access:**  Access is limited to essential services only (e.g., captive portal login, threat scan initiation).  No access to internal network resources is permitted.
*   **Automated Threat Scan:** The captive portal initiates an automated threat scan on the device (antivirus, vulnerability scan) before allowing full network access.
*   **Behavioral Analysis:** The system monitors the device’s behavior within the quarantine VLAN (attempts to bypass restrictions, suspicious traffic patterns). This further refines the threat score.
*   **Adaptive Policy:** The level of restriction can be adaptive based on the device’s behavior during quarantine.

**3. Configurable Rule Set (Threat Scoring Engine):**

*   **Database of Indicators:** A regularly updated database of known malicious MAC addresses, IP addresses, domain names, and behavioral patterns.
*   **Heuristic Rules:**  Rules based on unusual or suspicious activity (e.g., high DNS request rate, attempts to connect to known malicious IPs, mismatched device reported capabilities).
*   **Machine Learning Component:** A machine learning model trained on network traffic data to identify anomalous behavior. The model should be capable of adapting to new threats.
*   **Rule Prioritization:**  A mechanism to prioritize rules and adjust their weight in the threat scoring calculation.

**4. Network Infrastructure Integration:**

*   **VLAN Support:** The network infrastructure (switches, routers) must support VLAN tagging and redirection.
*   **API Integration:**  The beacon must be able to communicate with the network infrastructure via an API to dynamically create VLANs, redirect traffic, and enforce access control policies.
*   **DHCP Integration:** Integration with the DHCP server to assign IP addresses in the quarantine VLAN.
*   **Captive Portal Integration:** Integration with a captive portal solution to provide a user interface for threat scans and authentication.

**Pseudocode (Beacon Threat Profiler):**

```
on device_connection_attempt(mac_address, ip_address_request, dns_request, traffic_pattern):
    threat_score = 0

    # Check against known threat indicators
    if mac_address in blacklisted_mac_addresses:
        threat_score += 50
    if dns_request in malicious_domains:
        threat_score += 30

    # Analyze traffic patterns
    if traffic_pattern.request_rate > max_request_rate:
        threat_score += 20

    # Apply machine learning model
    ml_score = machine_learning_model.predict(traffic_pattern)
    threat_score += ml_score * 10

    if threat_score > quarantine_threshold:
        initiate_soft_quarantine(mac_address)
    else:
        allow_connection()
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply authenticating *after* a device connects. It proactively assesses risk *before* granting network access, creating a dynamic quarantine zone based on predictive threat modeling.  The integration of machine learning and behavioral analysis creates a more adaptive and effective security posture. This also allows for a more granular and less disruptive approach to security than simply blocking all unknown devices.
