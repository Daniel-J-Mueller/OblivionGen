## Acoustic Mapping with Dynamic Environmental Modeling

**Concept:** Augment the ultrasonic positioning system with a real-time environmental acoustic model. Instead of solely relying on Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) calculations, predict acoustic propagation based on a dynamic map of the environment, improving accuracy and enabling positioning in complex or changing spaces.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Ultrasonic Transceiver Array: Existing system.
    *   Environmental Sensor Suite: Integrated IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit), microphone array, and potentially low-resolution LiDAR or visual sensors.
    *   Edge Compute Unit: Embedded processor with sufficient computational power for real-time acoustic modeling.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Environmental Mapping Module:**
        *   Sensor Fusion: Combine IMU, microphone, and LiDAR/visual data to create a 3D map of the environment.
        *   Material Identification: Use the microphone array to characterize surface acoustic properties (reflection, absorption, diffraction).  Analyze frequency response of reflected signals to infer material type.
        *   Dynamic Updating: Continuously update the map to account for moving objects or changes in the environment.
    *   **Acoustic Propagation Module:**
        *   Ray Tracing/Beam Propagation: Simulate the propagation of ultrasonic signals based on the environmental map. Account for reflections, refractions, and diffractions.
        *   Frequency-Dependent Modeling:  Model acoustic propagation as a function of frequency to improve accuracy.
        *   Noise Modeling: Incorporate noise characteristics of the environment into the simulation.
    *   **Position Estimation Module:**
        *   Kalman Filtering: Fuse TDoA measurements with predictions from the acoustic propagation model using a Kalman filter to estimate the position of the tracked devices.
        *   Adaptive Weighting: Adjust the weights assigned to TDoA measurements and acoustic model predictions based on the confidence level of each source.
        *   Multi-Path Mitigation: Utilize the acoustic model to identify and mitigate the effects of multi-path interference.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Create Environmental Map
Initialize Kalman Filter

// Main Loop
Acquire Sensor Data (IMU, Microphone, LiDAR/Visual)
Update Environmental Map with Sensor Data

For Each Device to Track:
    Acquire Ultrasonic Signals from Device
    Calculate TDoA Measurements
    Predict Signal Propagation using Environmental Map and Frequency
    Calculate Predicted TDoA
    Update Kalman Filter with TDoA Measurements & Predicted TDoA
    Estimate Device Position

Output Device Position
```

**Novelty:** Current systems focus on direct TDoA calculations. This adaptation utilizes an *active* environmental model to predict how sound will behave in a given space and then uses that prediction to improve localization accuracy. This offers several advantages:

*   Improved Accuracy in Complex Environments: More accurate positioning in spaces with significant reflections or obstructions.
*   Robustness to Environmental Changes: Adapts to changes in the environment, such as moving objects or people.
*   Potential for "Around the Corner" Tracking: Positions devices even when they are not in direct line of sight.
*   Material Detection: The system could potentially identify materials based on acoustic properties.
