## Adaptive Data Plane Segmentation

**Specification:** Network switch with dynamically segmented data planes, configurable via a bootloader and runtime control plane interaction.

**Concept:** The current patent focuses on fast switch recovery after reboot by pre-configuring the data plane. This builds on that idea, but instead of a *static* pre-configuration, we introduce dynamic data plane segmentation. Imagine the data plane isnâ€™t a monolithic block, but a collection of configurable 'slices', each handling a specific traffic type or QoS level.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Data Plane Slices (DPS):** Multiple independent data plane processing units (e.g., ASICs, FPGAs). Each DPS is optimized for specific packet processing tasks (Layer 2 switching, Layer 3 routing, security functions, deep packet inspection).
*   **Inter-Slice Fabric (ISF):** High-speed, low-latency interconnect allowing communication between DPS units.  Must support prioritization and QoS marking.
*   **Slice Controller (SC):** Dedicated processor responsible for configuring and managing the DPS units and ISF.
*   **Control Plane (CP):** Existing network switch control plane (processor, memory, OS).
*   **Bootloader Extension (BLE):**  Extension to the existing bootloader, responsible for initial DPS configuration.

**Software Components:**

*   **Slice Definition Language (SDL):** A language for defining data plane slices, specifying processing tasks, priority, and resource allocation.
*   **Slice Management Module (SMM):** A control plane module responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting data plane slices.
*   **Bootloader Extension (BLE):** Loads initial slice configurations from non-volatile memory during boot.
*   **Runtime Slice Reconfiguration API (RSR API):** Allows dynamic reconfiguration of slices while the switch is operating.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Boot Process:**
    *   BLE loads initial slice definitions from non-volatile memory.
    *   BLE configures DPS units and ISF based on these definitions.
    *   Initial data plane is established *before* the full operating system boots.
2.  **Runtime Operation:**
    *   SMM receives configuration requests (e.g., new VLAN, new QoS policy).
    *   SMM translates requests into slice modifications.
    *   SMM uses RSR API to dynamically reconfigure slices.
    *   Traffic is intelligently routed through the appropriate slices based on configured policies.

**Pseudocode (RSR API - Example: Adding a new VLAN slice):**

```
function AddVlanSlice(vlan_id, input_port_range, output_port_range, priority):
  // Allocate a new DPS unit (if available)
  dps_unit = AllocateDPSUnit()

  // Configure DPS unit for VLAN processing
  ConfigureVlan(dps_unit, vlan_id)

  // Configure input/output port mappings
  MapPorts(dps_unit, input_port_range, output_port_range)

  // Set priority for slice
  SetPriority(dps_unit, priority)

  // Add slice to ISF routing table
  AddToIsfRouting(vlan_id, dps_unit)

  return success/failure
end function
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Granular Control:** Fine-grained control over packet processing and QoS.
*   **Scalability:**  Easily add or remove slices to adapt to changing network demands.
*   **Resilience:**  Isolate faulty slices without impacting the entire data plane.
*   **Optimization:** Optimize slices for specific traffic types to improve performance.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Respond to network events and changing priorities in real time.
