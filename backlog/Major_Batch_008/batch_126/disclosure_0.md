## Dynamic Content Segmentation & Sentiment-Driven Remixing

**Concept:** Extend segment-level feedback to enable *dynamic remixing* of content based on aggregated user sentiment. Instead of just flagging segments as 'good' or 'bad', leverage the system to algorithmically re-assemble content into personalized or optimized versions.

**Specs:**

**1. Sentiment Aggregation & Scoring:**

*   **Data Input:**  Integrate with the existing segment-level approval/disapproval system. Track *number* of approvals/disapprovals *and* dwell time on each segment (how long a user spends viewing/listening).
*   **Sentiment Score:** Calculate a ‘Sentiment Score’ for each segment.  Formula: `Sentiment Score = (Approval Count * 0.7) + (Dwell Time * 0.3) - (Disapproval Count * 0.5)`. (Weights are adjustable).  A higher score indicates positive reception.
*   **Normalization:** Normalize scores across all segments of a single piece of content to a 0-1 scale.

**2.  Content Remixing Engine:**

*   **Remix Profile Selection:** Allow users (or an automated system) to select a ‘Remix Profile’. Examples:
    *   **'Fastest Path':**  Prioritize segments with the highest Sentiment Scores, creating a condensed version.
    *   **'Most Engaging':** Prioritize segments with high Sentiment Scores *and* high average dwell time.
    *   **'Controversial Highlights':**  Prioritize segments with a high ratio of approvals *to* disapprovals (even if the total volume is low) - for content designed to spark discussion.
    *   **‘Negative Focus’**: Prioritize segments with the lowest Sentiment Score to create a critical analysis.
*   **Remix Algorithm:**
    1.  Sort all segments by Sentiment Score (based on selected Remix Profile).
    2.  Select top N segments (N is adjustable or dynamically determined based on content length and desired output length).
    3.  Re-assemble segments into a new content sequence, preserving original transitions as much as possible or employing a smooth transition algorithm.
*   **Remix Control:**
    *   **User-Driven Remix:**  Allow users to select a Remix Profile and generate a custom version.
    *   **Automated Remix:** System automatically generates multiple remixes based on different profiles.
    *   **Real-time Remix:** System adjusts content in real-time based on a user's immediate feedback (e.g., if a user skips a segment, the system learns to avoid similar segments in future remixes for that user).

**3.  Content Representation & Metadata:**

*   **Segment Metadata:** Each segment must be tagged with metadata:
    *   Segment ID
    *   Start Time/Position
    *   Duration
    *   Content Type (text, audio, video)
    *   Associated Keywords/Topics
*   **Content Graph:** Represent the entire piece of content as a directed graph, where nodes are segments and edges represent the original sequence.  This allows for flexible re-ordering and remixing.

**Pseudocode (Remix Algorithm):**

```
function remixContent(contentGraph, remixProfile, desiredLength):
  segments = nodes(contentGraph)
  for segment in segments:
    segment.sentimentScore = calculateSentimentScore(segment)
  sortedSegments = sortBy(segments, sentimentScore, descending=True)
  selectedSegments = selectTopN(sortedSegments, desiredLength)
  newContentSequence = reconstructSequence(selectedSegments)
  return newContentSequence
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Personalized news/article summaries.
*   Adaptive learning materials.
*   Dynamic video editing for social media.
*   Automated trailer creation.
*   Re-mixing user-generated content based on community feedback.
