## Dynamic Contextual 'Shadowing' for Resource Access

**Concept:** Extend the context-based access control system to not only *allow* or *deny* access, but to dynamically create a 'shadow' or limited-functionality version of the requested resource tailored to the specific context of the request. This shifts from simple gatekeeping to adaptive resource provision.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** *Contextual Shadow Generator (CSG)* - A new service integrated with the existing system. Receives the original request, context information, and access decision.
*   **Trigger:** Access is permitted, but context suggests limiting functionality or data exposure. (e.g., mobile device, off-site network, unverified user role).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Request Interception:** The web server/service intercepts the request *after* authorization but *before* resource delivery.
    2.  **Context Analysis:** The request and its associated context are forwarded to the CSG.
    3.  **Shadow Profile Creation:** The CSG consults a set of 'Shadow Definition Templates'. These templates describe how to create reduced-functionality versions of resources based on specific contexts. Templates contain instructions like:
        *   Data Filtering: Which data fields to remove or obfuscate.
        *   Functionality Restriction: Which features to disable or limit.
        *   UI Modification: Simplification of the user interface.
        *   API Endpoint Redirection: Routing to limited-scope API endpoints.
    4.  **Shadow Resource Generation:**  The CSG dynamically generates the 'shadow' resource based on the selected template and the specific context. This may involve:
        *   Data subsetting and masking.
        *   Code execution with limited permissions.
        *   Virtualization or containerization.
    5.  **Resource Delivery:**  The CSG returns the 'shadow' resource to the client instead of the original.  The client is unaware that it is interacting with a modified version.
*   **Shadow Definition Template Structure:**
    ```
    Template ID: <unique identifier>
    Context Triggers: [list of context conditions, e.g., "device_type == mobile", "network_location == offsite", "user_role == guest"]
    Resource Type: <resource being shadowed, e.g., "database_query", "web_page", "API_endpoint"]
    Transformations:
        Data Filtering: [list of fields to exclude or mask]
        Functionality Restrictions: [list of disabled functions]
        UI Modifications: [list of UI changes]
        API Redirection: [mapping of original API endpoints to limited-scope endpoints]
    ```

**Pseudocode (CSG Process):**

```
function generateShadowResource(request, context):
  // 1. Identify applicable Shadow Definition Templates
  templates = findTemplatesMatchingContext(context)

  if templates is empty:
    // No applicable templates, return original resource
    return originalResource

  // 2. Select the most specific template (e.g., based on number of matching context conditions)
  selectedTemplate = selectBestTemplate(templates)

  // 3. Apply transformations defined in the selected template
  shadowResource = applyTransformations(request, selectedTemplate)

  return shadowResource
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Mobile Devices:** Provide a simplified, data-optimized version of a complex web application.
*   **Off-Site Access:** Limit access to sensitive data when accessed from outside the corporate network.
*   **Guest Users:**  Provide a read-only view of a resource with limited functionality.
*   **Role-Based Access Control:** Provide different versions of a resource based on the user's role.
