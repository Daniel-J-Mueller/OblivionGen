## Personalized Proactive Support Agent Avatars

**Concept:** Leverage the embedded link system to proactively offer support via personalized, AI-driven avatars *within* the customer’s email client. This moves beyond reactive feedback links to anticipatory assistance.

**Specs:**

*   **Avatar Engine:** A cloud-based service generating photorealistic or stylized 3D avatars. These avatars are associated with specific support queues (e.g., billing, technical support, order status).
*   **Email Integration:** A server-side component that intercepts outgoing customer service emails. It identifies existing embedded links (from the source patent) and *adds* a data payload containing avatar selection criteria (customer demographics, purchase history, stated preferences, issue keywords).
*   **Client-Side Component:** A lightweight browser extension (or similar, for email clients lacking extension support) that reads the data payload from incoming emails. It instantiates the appropriate avatar within the email viewing window.
*   **Avatar Behavior:**
    *   **Initial State:** Avatar appears as a subtle, animated icon. Hovering/clicking expands it to a chat-like interface *within* the email.
    *   **Proactive Messaging:** Avatar initiates conversations based on the email content (e.g., "I see you're having trouble with your recent order.  Can I help?") or predicted customer needs (e.g., "Just a reminder your subscription renews in 7 days.")
    *   **AI-Powered Dialogue:**  Utilize a large language model (LLM) to handle customer inquiries, drawing from a knowledge base of FAQs, product documentation, and support tickets.
    *   **Seamless Escalation:**  If the AI cannot resolve the issue, seamlessly transfer the customer to a human agent with full context of the conversation.
*   **Link Integration:**  The original embedded links remain functional for traditional feedback.  The avatar interface *also* includes links to self-service resources and escalation options.
*   **Customization:**  Allow businesses to customize the avatar’s appearance, voice, and personality to align with their brand.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Component):**

```
function onEmailReceived(email) {
  data = extractDataPayload(email);

  if (data) {
    avatar = createAvatar(data.avatarType, data.customerId);
    avatar.display();

    avatar.onMessage(function(message) {
      // Send message to AI engine
      aiResponse = callAI(message, customerData);
      avatar.displayResponse(aiResponse);
    });
  }
}

function extractDataPayload(email) {
  // Parse email body for embedded data payload (JSON format)
  // Return data payload if found, otherwise return null
}

function createAvatar(avatarType, customerId) {
  // Instantiate avatar object based on avatarType
  // Load customer-specific preferences (e.g., preferred language, avatar style)
  // Return avatar object
}

function callAI(message, customerData) {
  // Send message and customer data to AI engine
  // Receive AI response
  // Return AI response
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased customer engagement and satisfaction.
*   Reduced support costs through proactive assistance and self-service.
*   Enhanced brand perception through personalized experiences.
*   Data-driven insights into customer needs and pain points.
