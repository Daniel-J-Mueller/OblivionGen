## Dynamic Network Persona Assignment

**Concept:** Expand upon the network topology awareness to dynamically assign “personas” to network devices based not just on *where* they are, but *how* they are being used in real-time. This goes beyond static configuration metadata and pushes towards self-adapting network elements.

**Specifications:**

*   **Persona Definition:** A persona is a pre-defined set of configuration parameters, security policies, QoS settings, and monitoring thresholds. Examples: “High-Bandwidth Streamer,” “Critical Sensor,” “Low-Priority Backup,” “Security Gateway,” “Anomaly Detector.”
*   **Real-Time Usage Analysis:** Implement an agent on each network device (or a centralized service analyzing network flows) to monitor application-level traffic, resource utilization (CPU, memory, bandwidth), and security events.
*   **Persona Assignment Engine:** A central service that receives usage data and, based on pre-defined rules and/or machine learning models, assigns the most appropriate persona to each device. This engine uses the network topology data *as a constraint* – a device in a specific location might be limited to certain personas.
*   **Dynamic Configuration:** Upon persona assignment, the engine pushes the corresponding configuration parameters to the device. This could be achieved via Netconf/Yang, REST APIs, or other configuration management protocols.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Monitor device performance after persona assignment. If performance degrades or security events occur, automatically trigger a re-evaluation of the persona.
*   **Topology-Aware Persona Restrictions:**  The network topology data isn’t just used for location; it’s used to *restrict* persona assignments. For example, a “Security Gateway” persona might only be assignable to devices located at the network edge, as defined in the topology data.
*   **API for Persona Definition and Management:** A RESTful API to allow administrators (or automated systems) to define new personas, modify existing personas, and specify the criteria for persona assignment.

**Pseudocode (Persona Assignment Engine):**

```
function assign_persona(device_id, usage_data, topology_data, persona_definitions):
  // 1. Gather applicable personas based on device location (topology_data)
  applicable_personas = filter_personas_by_location(persona_definitions, topology_data)

  // 2. Evaluate usage data to determine best-fit persona
  best_persona = evaluate_persona_fit(usage_data, applicable_personas)

  // 3. Check if the new persona conflicts with network policies
  if (is_persona_allowed(best_persona, device_id, network_policies)):
    // 4. Apply the new persona configuration
    apply_persona_configuration(device_id, best_persona)
    log_persona_assignment(device_id, best_persona)
  else:
    // Keep current persona
    log_persona_assignment_failure(device_id, best_persona, "Policy Violation")
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Network devices with sufficient processing power and memory to run agents.
*   Centralized server(s) to host the Persona Assignment Engine and store persona definitions.
*   Network monitoring tools to capture usage data.
*   Configuration management system to push configurations to network devices.
*   Secure communication channels between agents, the engine, and network devices.
