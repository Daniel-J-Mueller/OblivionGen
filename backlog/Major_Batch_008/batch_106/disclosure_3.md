## Dynamic Skill Fusion for Predictive Visual Responses

**Concept:** Expand the system to not just *respond* to user input with visuals, but to *predict* likely follow-up inputs and proactively display relevant visuals *alongside* the initial response. This creates a layered, anticipatory interface.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component: Predictive Skill Engine (PSE)**
    *   Function: Analyzes dialog context, user history, and real-time input to forecast the user’s next likely query or action.
    *   Implementation: Utilizes a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on a massive dataset of user interactions. Incorporates attention mechanisms to identify key phrases indicating future intent.
*   **Component: Visual Layer Manager (VLM)**
    *   Function: Controls the display of multiple visual “layers” – the primary response visuals, and the predicted visuals.
    *   Implementation: Utilizes a tiling or layering system. The primary response visuals occupy the dominant display area. Predicted visuals are rendered in a semi-transparent overlay, or a dedicated, smaller display area (e.g., a persistent sidebar or lower band).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  User input received.
    2.  Primary skill components determine the immediate response visuals.
    3.  PSE analyzes the input and predicts the next likely user intent.
    4.  Based on the predicted intent, the VLM selects relevant skill components to generate "predicted visuals."
    5.  The VLM renders the primary and predicted visuals simultaneously.
    6.  If the user *does* take the predicted action, the predicted visuals seamlessly become the primary focus. If not, they fade or are dismissed.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//On User Input
input = getUserInput()
primaryIntent = determinePrimaryIntent(input)

//Determine primary skill response
primaryResponse = primarySkillComponent.generateResponse(primaryIntent)
display(primaryResponse)

//Predict next intent
predictedIntent = PredictiveSkillEngine.predictIntent(input, dialogHistory, userProfile)

//Generate predicted visuals
predictedResponse = skillComponentFor(predictedIntent).generateResponse(predictedIntent)

//Display predicted visuals in semi-transparent overlay
display(predictedResponse, transparency = 0.5, overlayPosition = "bottom")

//On User Action (if action matches predicted intent)
if (userAction == predictedIntent) {
    //Transition predicted visuals to primary display
    transition(predictedVisuals, toPrimaryDisplay)
} else {
    //Dismiss predicted visuals
    dismiss(predictedVisuals)
}
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Extensive dialogue datasets, including multi-turn conversations.
*   User profiles, capturing preferences, history, and contextual information.
*   Skill component metadata, detailing each skill’s capabilities and associated visuals.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved user experience.
*   Proactive information delivery.
*   Enhanced interface intuitiveness.
*   Increased user engagement.
