## Adaptive Content Prioritization & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand beyond section prioritization based *solely* on historical user access. Introduce a predictive prefetching system informed by contextual data – time of day, location, network conditions, and potentially even calendar events – to anticipate user information needs *before* they explicitly request it.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User access logs (historical section views, timestamps)
    *   Real-time location data (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation) - *optional, user-permissioned*
    *   Device network connection type (Wi-Fi, cellular – signal strength)
    *   Device calendar access (with explicit user permission) - identifying scheduled meetings, appointments, travel.
    *   Time of day.
*   **Core Algorithm – Predictive Model:**
    *   Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) network.
    *   Training Data: Combine historical user access patterns with contextual data (location, time, network, calendar).
    *   Output: Probability distribution across content sections, predicting likelihood of access within a defined time window (e.g., next 30 minutes, next hour).
*   **Prefetching Logic:**
    *   Threshold-Based: If the predicted probability of accessing a section exceeds a pre-defined threshold (adjustable per user), prefetch that section.
    *   Bandwidth-Aware: Dynamically adjust prefetching aggressiveness based on available network bandwidth. Prioritize prefetching over Wi-Fi connections.
    *   Battery-Aware: Reduce or suspend prefetching when battery levels are low.
*   **Content Delivery & Presentation:**
    *   Staged Download: Prefetched content is downloaded in the background but not immediately displayed.
    *   Seamless Integration: When the user navigates to a prefetched section, content loads instantly.
    *   Dynamic Reordering: Combine predicted preferences with historical data to dynamically reorder the presentation of content sections.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (Runs Continuously in Background)
For Each Time Interval (e.g., 5 minutes):
    // Gather Contextual Data
    location = GetLocation()
    networkType = GetNetworkType()
    timeOfDay = GetTimeOfDay()
    calendarEvents = GetCalendarEvents()

    // Predict Section Access Probabilities
    probabilities = RNN.Predict(location, networkType, timeOfDay, calendarEvents, UserHistory)

    // Identify Sections to Prefetch
    For Each Section:
        If probabilities[Section] > PrefetchThreshold:
            If NetworkIsGood() AND BatteryIsAboveThreshold():
                DownloadSection(Section)
                MarkSectionAsPrefetched(Section)

    // Dynamic Reordering (When User Accesses Content)
    Upon User Request For Content:
        ReorderedSections = Combine(PredictedPreferences, HistoricalPreferences)
        PresentContent(ReorderedSections)
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:** Sufficient processing power for RNN inference. Adequate storage for prefetched content.
*   **User Privacy Considerations:** Implement robust user permissioning for location and calendar access. Provide clear transparency about data collection and usage. Allow users to disable prefetching and data collection at any time.
