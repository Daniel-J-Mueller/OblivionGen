## Dynamic Transaction Tagging & Predictive Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the access control mechanism to incorporate dynamic transaction tagging *at the application level* coupled with a predictive filtering system. This shifts the focus from solely attribute-based filtering (type, QoS, address) to *behavioral* filtering, anticipating potential issues before they impact system performance.

**Specs:**

**1. Application-Level Tagging API:**

*   A software API exposed to applications running on either peripheral device (or the host) to dynamically attach 'tags' to transactions *before* they are initiated.
*   Tags are key-value pairs representing contextual information:  `{“tag_name”: “tag_value”}`. Example: `{“security_level”: “high”}`, `{“priority”: “realtime”}`, `{“data_sensitivity”: “PII”}`.
*   API calls:
    *   `AddTransactionTag(transaction_id, tag_name, tag_value)`
    *   `RemoveTransactionTag(transaction_id, tag_name)`
    *   `GetTransactionTags(transaction_id)` – Returns a list of tags associated with a transaction.

**2. Predictive Filtering Engine (PFE):**

*   Located within the apparatus (as described in claim 5) of either peripheral device.
*   PFE utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, LSTM) trained on historical transaction data.
*   **Training Data:** Consists of:
    *   Transaction attributes (type, QoS, address, etc.)
    *   Dynamically attached tags (from the API)
    *   Performance metrics (latency, throughput, error rates)
    *   Security event logs
*   **Prediction:**  For each incoming transaction, the PFE:
    1.  Collects transaction attributes *and* dynamically added tags.
    2.  Feeds this data into the trained ML model.
    3.  The model predicts a "risk score" or "performance impact score." This score represents the likelihood of the transaction causing a problem (security breach, performance bottleneck, etc.).

**3. Adaptive Filtering Rules:**

*   The apparatus stores a set of adaptive filtering rules.  These rules are based on the risk/impact scores generated by the PFE.  Rules could be:
    *   `IF risk_score > threshold THEN block_transaction`
    *   `IF risk_score > medium_threshold AND tag_name = "data_sensitivity" AND tag_value = "PII" THEN prioritize_transaction` (Prioritization could involve adjusting QoS parameters or routing through a more secure path).
    *   `IF risk_score > high_threshold AND tag_name = "application" AND tag_value = "critical" THEN alert_administrator`

**4. Dynamic Rule Adjustment:**

*   The apparatus includes a feedback loop that continuously updates the filtering rules based on observed system behavior.
*   If a transaction is blocked/prioritized, the apparatus monitors the impact on system performance.
*   Based on this feedback, the filtering thresholds and rules are automatically adjusted to optimize the trade-off between security, performance, and availability.

**Pseudocode (PFE – simplified):**

```pseudocode
function PredictRiskScore(transaction_attributes, transaction_tags):
  // Combine attributes and tags into a feature vector
  feature_vector = Combine(transaction_attributes, transaction_tags)
  // Feed feature vector into the trained ML model
  risk_score = ML_Model.Predict(feature_vector)
  return risk_score
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The PFE requires dedicated processing resources (e.g., a small FPGA or DSP) to handle the ML inference in real-time.
*   Sufficient memory is needed to store the ML model and historical transaction data.
*   The apparatus must have a high-bandwidth interface to the PCIe bus to handle the data transfer.
