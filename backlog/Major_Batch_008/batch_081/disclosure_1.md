## Dynamic Condition Grading with AI-Driven Visual Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the product listing process to include automated, AI-powered condition assessment, creating a standardized, transparent grading system beyond simple user-defined descriptors. This moves beyond subjective "like new," "used," etc., providing verifiable condition data to buyers and potentially impacting pricing algorithms.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Image Capture Module:**
    *   Integrated within the listing creation workflow (mobile app & web).
    *   Guided image capture:  The system provides visual cues (overlays, prompts) to guide the seller in capturing consistent images of key product areas (e.g., screen, corners, surface).  Minimum 3 images required, maximum 10.
    *   Automatic image enhancement: Basic adjustments for lighting, focus, and perspective correction applied automatically.

2.  **AI Condition Analysis Engine:**
    *   **Model:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a massive dataset of product images with verified condition grades (created internally and through partnerships).  Specific models per product category (e.g., electronics, apparel, books).
    *   **Analysis Parameters:**
        *   **Defect Detection:** Identifies and classifies defects (scratches, dents, stains, discoloration, screen burn-in, etc.).
        *   **Severity Estimation:**  Assigns a severity score (0-10) to each detected defect.
        *   **Coverage Area:**  Calculates the total area affected by defects as a percentage of the product surface.
    *   **Output:** A structured condition report:
        *   Overall Condition Grade (A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D) â€“ derived from a weighted average of defect scores and coverage areas.
        *   Detailed Defect List:  Identifies each defect, its location, severity, and a visual highlight on the captured images.

3.  **Listing Workflow Integration:**
    *   **Automated Grade Proposal:** The AI-generated condition grade is presented to the seller as a suggestion.
    *   **Seller Override:** The seller can review the AI analysis, adjust the grade if necessary (with a clear explanation required), and add additional comments.  A mismatch between the AI grade and the seller's grade triggers a review flag.
    *   **Visual Condition Report:**  The detailed condition report (including highlighted images) is displayed prominently on the listing page.
    *   **Condition Filtering:** Buyers can filter search results by condition grade.

4.  **Pricing Algorithm Integration:**
    *   The condition grade is factored into the suggested selling price.  A lookup table maps condition grades to price adjustments based on historical sales data.
    *   The pricing algorithm can dynamically adjust the price based on real-time demand and inventory levels.

5.  **Data Collection & Model Improvement:**
    *   User feedback on condition grades (e.g., "accurate" or "inaccurate") is collected and used to retrain the AI model.
    *   A quality control process is implemented to verify the accuracy of condition grades assigned by the AI model.

**Pseudocode (AI Condition Analysis Engine):**

```
function analyze_condition(image_set, product_category):
  model = load_model(product_category)  // Load pre-trained CNN
  defect_list = []
  total_defect_area = 0

  for image in image_set:
    defects = model.detect_defects(image)
    for defect in defects:
      defect_list.append({
        "type": defect.type,
        "location": defect.location,
        "severity": defect.severity,
        "area": defect.area
      })
      total_defect_area += defect.area

  overall_grade = calculate_grade(defect_list, total_defect_area)  // Based on weighted average

  return {
    "overall_grade": overall_grade,
    "defect_list": defect_list
  }

function calculate_grade(defect_list, total_defect_area):
  // Weighted average of defect severity and coverage area
  // Example weights: severity_weight = 0.6, area_weight = 0.4
  // Grade mapping based on the weighted average score
  // (A+, A, B+, etc.)
