## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Mapping for Targeted Power Reduction

**System Overview:** A user device incorporates an array of micro-resonators alongside the proximity sensors. These resonators are tuned to specific frequencies and analyze the resonant shift caused by the presence of an object. This provides more granular data about object composition (dielectric constant, conductivity) *in addition* to proximity, allowing for highly refined transmit power adjustments.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Proximity Sensor Array:** Existing setup as defined in the patent.
*   **Micro-Resonator Array:** A dense array of micro-resonators (MEMS or thin-film) integrated with the proximity sensors. Each resonator operates at a pre-defined frequency.
*   **Resonance Frequency Analyzer:** Dedicated circuitry to accurately measure the resonant frequency shift of each micro-resonator.
*   **Material Database:** An onboard database mapping resonant frequency shifts to material properties (e.g., human tissue, metal, plastic, air).
*   **Transmit Power Controller:** Module to adjust antenna transmit power based on combined proximity and material data.
*   **Calibration Module:** On-device calibration procedure to account for manufacturing variations and environmental factors.

**Software/Algorithm:**

1.  **Baseline Mapping:** During initialization, the system establishes a baseline resonant frequency for each micro-resonator in the array.
2.  **Resonance Shift Detection:** Continuously monitor the resonant frequency of each micro-resonator.
3.  **Material Identification:** Analyze the pattern of resonant frequency shifts across the array. Compare this pattern to the onboard material database to identify the likely material composition of the object. This isn't about *absolute* identification, but about categorizing the object (e.g., "high dielectric constant - likely human tissue", "high conductivity - likely metal").
4.  **Proximity/Material Fusion:** Combine proximity data (from the patent's sensors) with material categorization.
5.  **Dynamic Power Adjustment:** Implement a lookup table or machine learning model that maps proximity *and* material type to optimal transmit power levels.

    *   If a “high dielectric constant” material (likely a body part) is detected close to the antenna, significantly reduce transmit power.
    *   If a metallic object is detected, further reduce power and potentially shift frequency to minimize induced currents.
    *   If the object is categorized as non-absorbent (e.g., plastic), maintain baseline power levels.
6. **Adaptive Learning:** The system can adapt over time. If the material identification is incorrect, the algorithm adjusts its model based on user feedback or subsequent measurements.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
baseline_resonance = get_baseline_resonance_array()
material_database = load_material_database()

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  proximity_data = read_proximity_sensors()
  resonance_data = read_resonance_sensors()

  material_category = identify_material(resonance_data, material_database)

  power_level = calculate_power_level(proximity_data, material_category)

  set_transmit_power(power_level)

  // Optional: Adaptive Learning
  if (user_feedback == incorrect_material) {
      update_material_database(resonance_data, correct_material)
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **More Precise Power Control:** Reduces unnecessary radiation exposure.
*   **Improved Battery Life:** Lower transmit power translates to energy savings.
*   **Enhanced User Safety:** Minimizes SAR (Specific Absorption Rate).
*   **Adaptive Performance:** Optimizes signal quality based on surrounding environment.
*   **Potential for new Use-cases:** Object sensing beyond just proximity.
