## Dynamic Certificate Revocation Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Creation Module:**

*   **Input:** User activity data streams (keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, application usage patterns, network traffic patterns, time of day of access).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to establish baseline behavioral profiles for each user/role associated with certificates.
    *   Continuous learning: Profiles update dynamically with ongoing user activity.
    *   Anomaly Detection: Calculate a 'behavioral risk score' based on deviation from the established profile. This score is a floating-point number between 0.0 (no anomaly) and 1.0 (significant anomaly).
*   **Output:**  A dynamic behavioral profile for each user/role, including the behavioral risk score. Stored as a JSON object in a dedicated database.

```json
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "role": "developer",
  "keystroke_dynamics": {
    "avg_key_dwell_time": 120,
    "key_press_variation": 10
  },
  "mouse_movement": {
    "avg_speed": 80,
    "acceleration_variation": 5
  },
  "behavioral_risk_score": 0.15,
  "last_updated": "2024-10-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```

**2. Certificate Revocation Integration Module:**

*   **Input:** Behavioral risk score from the Behavioral Profile Creation Module, Certificate issuance policy data (from existing system), Certificate metadata (subject, validity period, etc.)
*   **Processing:**
    *   Policy-Driven Revocation Threshold: Certificate issuance policies will include configurable thresholds for the behavioral risk score.  Example: "Revoke certificate if behavioral risk score exceeds 0.75 for 5 consecutive minutes."
    *   Multi-Factor Revocation: Combine behavioral risk score with other factors (e.g., failed login attempts, unusual access patterns) to refine revocation decisions.
    *   Granular Revocation Control: Enable revocation based on specific behaviors (e.g., revoke if user exhibits keyboard patterns consistent with bot activity).
*   **Output:** Revocation request to the Certificate Authority (CA) service. Includes reason for revocation (e.g., "Suspicious Behavioral Activity").

**3. Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting Module:**

*   **Input:** Behavioral risk scores, revocation requests, CA response.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time dashboard displaying user/role risk scores, revocation events.
    *   Alerting system: Send notifications (email, SMS, Slack) to security administrators when high-risk activity is detected or certificates are revoked.
    *   Audit Logging: Maintain a detailed audit trail of all behavioral monitoring and revocation events.

**4. API Integration:**

*   Expose APIs for:
    *   Registering users/roles for behavioral monitoring.
    *   Retrieving behavioral risk scores.
    *   Configuring revocation policies.
    *   Querying audit logs.

**System Architecture:**

*   **Components:**  Behavioral Profile Creation Module, Certificate Revocation Integration Module, Real-Time Monitoring & Alerting Module, API Gateway, Data Storage (Time-Series Database for behavioral data, Relational Database for policy and audit data).
*   **Deployment:** Microservices architecture, deployed on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, GCP).
*   **Communication:** REST APIs, Message Queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ).

**Novelty:**

Existing certificate revocation mechanisms primarily rely on static criteria (compromised keys, policy violations). This system introduces *dynamic* revocation based on *real-time behavioral analysis*, significantly enhancing security by proactively identifying and mitigating threats posed by compromised accounts or malicious insiders *before* they can cause significant damage.  The integration with existing certificate issuance policies allows for a flexible and customizable approach to security.
