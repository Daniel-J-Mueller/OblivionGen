## Dynamic Address Scrambling with Per-Core Pattern Generation

**Concept:** Instead of pre-defined or randomly generated scrambling patterns stored in memory, implement a per-core address scrambling pattern generator. This generator leverages hardware counters tracking memory access patterns to dynamically adjust the scrambling logic *during* operation. This eliminates memory storage requirements for patterns and adapts to real-time access behavior.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Each processor core will contain a dedicated Address Scrambling Unit (ASU). The ASU consists of:
    *   A Pattern Generation Engine (PGE).
    *   A Counter Array (CA).
    *   A Scrambling Logic Block (SLB).
*   **Counter Array (CA):** The CA will consist of N counters, each tracking a specific range of bits within an address. N is configurable but defaults to 64 (covering a 64-bit address space). Each counter tracks the frequency of each bit value (0 or 1) within its assigned bit range over a sliding window (e.g., last 1024 memory accesses).
*   **Pattern Generation Engine (PGE):** The PGE analyzes the counter data from the CA to generate a scrambling pattern. The PGE employs a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) seeded with the counter values. This ensures the pattern is dynamically adjusted based on access history.  The PGE outputs a bit permutation map defining how address bits are rearranged.
*   **Scrambling Logic Block (SLB):** The SLB implements the bit permutation map received from the PGE. It receives the input address and applies the permutation to generate the scrambled address.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   A global enable/disable bit for the dynamic scrambling.
    *   Configurable sliding window size for the counters.
    *   Configurable PRNG algorithm and seed.
    *   Configurable bit ranges for each counter.
*   **Operation:**
    1.  For each memory access:
    2.  The address is fed into the ASU.
    3.  The ASU reads the current counter values from the CA.
    4.  The PGE generates a scrambling pattern based on the counter values.
    5.  The SLB applies the scrambling pattern to the address.
    6.  The scrambled address is sent to the memory controller.
    7.  The CA updates its counters based on the accessed address bits.
*   **Pseudocode (PGE):**

```pseudocode
function generateScramblingPattern(counterArray):
  seed = 0
  for each counter in counterArray:
    seed += counter.value  // Sum the counter values to form the seed

  rng = new PseudoRandomNumberGenerator(seed)
  permutationMap = array of size 64 // Assuming 64-bit addresses

  for i = 0 to 63:
    permutationMap[i] = rng.nextInteger() % 64 // Generate a random permutation

  return permutationMap
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Security:** Dynamically changing scrambling patterns make it more difficult for attackers to predict or exploit address patterns.
*   **Adaptive Performance:** The scrambling pattern adapts to access behavior, potentially reducing contention and improving memory access efficiency.
*   **Reduced Memory Overhead:** Eliminates the need to store scrambling patterns in memory.
*   **Per-Core Isolation:** Each core has its own dynamic pattern, reducing the potential for interference between virtual machines.
