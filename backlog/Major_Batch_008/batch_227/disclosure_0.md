## Dynamic Complexity-Based GOP Structuring & Predictive Pre-Encoding

**Concept:** Instead of simply adjusting quality *within* GOPs based on content characteristics, proactively *structure* the GOP itself based on predicted future complexity.  This pre-emptive structuring aims to optimize encoding efficiency by anticipating computationally expensive sections and preparing for them.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on *reacting* to content. This approach looks *ahead* and modulates the GOP structure to smooth computational load and enhance perceptual quality. Complex scenes will get longer, more thoughtfully constructed GOPs, while simpler scenes will have shorter, faster-to-encode GOPs.

**Specs:**

**1. Complexity Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw video frames (or a lower-resolution preview).
*   **Process:** A lightweight, fast-running AI model (potentially a convolutional neural network) trained to predict a “complexity score” for each frame, based on features like:
    *   Motion vector density.
    *   Texture variation (using filters like Laplacian of Gaussian).
    *   Scene change detection.
    *   Object count (using basic object detection).
*   **Output:** A time series of complexity scores – one score per frame.

**2. GOP Structuring Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Complexity score time series, Target Bitrate, Maximum GOP Length.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Sliding Window:** Analyze the complexity scores using a sliding window (e.g., 1 second).
    *   **GOP Length Adjustment:**
        *   **High Complexity Window:** Extend the GOP length.  More I-frames and P-frames to give encoding headroom.
        *   **Low Complexity Window:** Shorten the GOP length.  Faster encoding.
    *   **Frame Type Assignment:**  Within each GOP:
        *   **I-frame Placement:** Prioritize I-frame placement *before* predicted complexity spikes to provide a “fresh start” for encoding.
        *   **P/B-frame Distribution:**  Adjust the ratio of P and B-frames based on motion estimation complexity. Lower motion = more B-frames; Higher motion = more P-frames.
*   **Output:**  A GOP structure plan – a sequence of frame types (I, P, B) and their durations.

**3. Encoding Pass Integration:**

*   The GOP structure plan is fed to the encoding engine.
*   The encoder generates the video based on the defined plan.
*   The encoder may also adjust quality *within* the GOP, as per the original patent, but it now operates within a pre-defined structure.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Complexity Prediction (Simplified)
def predict_complexity(frame):
    # Placeholder - replace with actual AI model
    motion_vectors = calculate_motion_vectors(frame)
    texture_variation = calculate_texture_variation(frame)
    complexity_score = len(motion_vectors) + texture_variation
    return complexity_score

# GOP Structuring
def create_gop_plan(complexity_scores, target_bitrate, max_gop_length):
    gop_plan = []
    current_gop_length = 0
    for i, score in enumerate(complexity_scores):
        if score > complexity_threshold: # Adjust based on experimentation
            # High complexity - extend GOP
            gop_plan.append("P") # Or "B" if appropriate
            current_gop_length += 1
        else:
            # Low complexity - potentially start a new GOP
            if current_gop_length >= max_gop_length:
                gop_plan.append("I")  # Start new GOP with I-frame
                current_gop_length = 0
            else:
                gop_plan.append("B") # Short GOP
                current_gop_length += 1
    return gop_plan

# Encoding Integration
# (Assume encoder API exists to set GOP structure)
# encoder.set_gop_structure(gop_plan)
# encoder.encode(video_frames)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Encoding Efficiency:**  Smoother computational load on the encoder.
*   **Enhanced Perceptual Quality:**  Proactive preparation for complex scenes could reduce compression artifacts.
*   **Adaptability:**  The complexity prediction model can be retrained to optimize for different content types.
