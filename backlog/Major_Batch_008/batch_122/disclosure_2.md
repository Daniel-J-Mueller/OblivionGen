## Adaptive Encryption Granularity

**Concept:** Instead of encrypting entire audio segments after processing completion, dynamically adjust encryption granularity based on identified content *within* the audio. This moves beyond simply delaying encryption; it tailors the level of security applied to different parts of the audio stream.

**Specification:**

**1. Audio Content Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw audio data stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   Real-time analysis of audio segments (e.g., 100ms windows) for content classification. Categories:
        *   **Sensitive Data:** Keywords/phrases related to Personally Identifiable Information (PII), financial transactions, health information (using pre-trained models and customizable dictionaries).
        *   **Command/Control:** Phrases identified as direct commands to the device ("turn on lights", "send message").
        *   **Ambient Sound:** Non-speech sounds (music, background noise, etc.).
        *   **Neutral:** Speech or sound not falling into other categories.
    *   Assign a "Sensitivity Score" to each audio segment (0-100, based on content classification).
*   **Output:** Audio segments with associated Sensitivity Scores.

**2. Adaptive Encryption Engine:**

*   **Input:** Audio segments with Sensitivity Scores.
*   **Process:**
    *   Apply encryption based on Sensitivity Score thresholds:
        *   **Score 80-100:** Full Encryption (AES-256 or equivalent).
        *   **Score 50-79:** Lightweight Encryption (e.g., a faster, less computationally expensive algorithm, or selective encryption of key frequencies).
        *   **Score 20-49:** Partial Encryption (encrypt metadata, timestamps, and potentially only segments containing identifiable speech).
        *   **Score 0-19:** No Encryption (e.g., ambient sound, considered non-sensitive).
    *   Implement a rolling buffer to manage encryption latency. Encrypt segments as they cross the threshold.
    *   Integrate a key rotation system for enhanced security.
*   **Output:** Encrypted (or unencrypted) audio segments.

**3. Metadata Management:**

*   Maintain a metadata stream alongside the encrypted audio, indicating:
    *   Encryption Algorithm used for each segment.
    *   Key ID used for encryption.
    *   Sensitivity Score.
    *   Timestamp.

**4. System Integration:**

*   The Adaptive Encryption Engine operates *before* storage in volatile or non-volatile memory.
*   The system is configurable to adjust Sensitivity Score thresholds and encryption algorithms based on privacy policies and device security settings.
*   Monitor computational load to dynamically adjust encryption granularity if the device is under heavy processing constraints.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each audio segment IN audio stream:
    sensitivityScore = AnalyzeContent(audio segment)
    IF sensitivityScore >= 80:
        encryptedSegment = AES256Encrypt(audio segment, key ID)
        metadata = CreateMetadata(encryptedSegment, "AES256", key ID, sensitivityScore)
    ELSE IF sensitivityScore >= 50:
        encryptedSegment = LightweightEncrypt(audio segment, key ID)
        metadata = CreateMetadata(encryptedSegment, "Lightweight", key ID, sensitivityScore)
    ELSE IF sensitivityScore >= 20:
        encryptedSegment = PartialEncrypt(audio segment, key ID)
        metadata = CreateMetadata(encryptedSegment, "Partial", key ID, sensitivityScore)
    ELSE:
        encryptedSegment = audio segment
        metadata = CreateMetadata(encryptedSegment, "None", key ID, sensitivityScore)
    STORE encryptedSegment and metadata
END FOR
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced computational overhead compared to encrypting entire audio streams.
*   Enhanced privacy by selectively protecting sensitive information.
*   Improved responsiveness by minimizing encryption latency.
*   Adaptability to different privacy requirements and device capabilities.
