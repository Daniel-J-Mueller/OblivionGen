## Adaptive Storage Tiering via Predictive Deletion

**Concept:** Extend the index-based deletion strategy to proactively tier storage based on predicted data obsolescence, optimizing for both cost and performance. Instead of *reacting* to deletions, *predict* them and move data to cheaper, slower storage *before* the deletion request even arrives.

**Specs:**

*   **Prediction Engine:** Integrate a machine learning model (trained on access patterns, data type, user behavior, timestamps) to assign a “deletion probability” score to each data item.  This isn't a binary 'will be deleted/won't be deleted', but a continuously updated probability.
*   **Tiered Storage:** Define multiple storage tiers (e.g., NVMe, SSD, HDD, Tape/Object Storage). Each tier has an associated cost per GB and read/write latency.
*   **Index Augmentation:**  Extend the existing index to include the “deletion probability” score *and* the current storage tier.
*   **Automated Tiering Policy:** Implement a policy engine that monitors deletion probabilities. When a data item's probability exceeds a threshold, automatically migrate it to a cheaper storage tier. This migration is transparent to the user.
*   **Reconciliation Layer:**  Maintain a reconciliation layer that handles cases where a deletion request arrives for data already migrated.  The layer simply confirms the deletion in the index and removes the data from the lower tier (if necessary).
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The deletion probability threshold for tiering should be dynamically adjusted based on overall storage capacity, cost optimization goals, and performance requirements.

**Pseudocode (Tiering Policy Engine):**

```
function tier_data(index_entry):
  probability = index_entry.deletion_probability
  current_tier = index_entry.storage_tier

  if probability > HIGH_THRESHOLD and current_tier == NVMe:
    migrate_to_tier(index_entry, SSD)
  elif probability > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD and current_tier == SSD:
    migrate_to_tier(index_entry, HDD)
  elif probability > LOW_THRESHOLD and current_tier == HDD:
    migrate_to_tier(index_entry, Object_Storage)

function migrate_to_tier(index_entry, target_tier):
  # 1. Copy data from current storage to target storage.
  # 2. Update index_entry.storage_tier = target_tier
  # 3. Remove data from current storage (after successful copy & index update).
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Index Entry:**
    *   `logical_identifier`: Unique ID for the data item.
    *   `storage_location`: Current physical location of the data.
    *   `storage_tier`:  Enum (NVMe, SSD, HDD, Object_Storage).
    *   `deletion_probability`:  Float (0.0 - 1.0).
    *   `timestamp`: Last access timestamp.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Cost Optimization:** Reduce storage costs by automatically migrating infrequently accessed data to cheaper tiers.
*   **Performance Improvement:** Prioritize frequently accessed data on faster storage.
*   **Proactive Resource Management:** Anticipate storage needs and allocate resources efficiently.
*   **Reduced Latency for Common Operations:** By pre-staging common access data.
