## Dynamic Model Stitching for Federated Learning

**Concept:** Extend the pre-trained model adaptation concept to a federated learning environment by ‘stitching’ together adapted models from multiple clients, creating a globally robust model without directly sharing sensitive training data.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A ‘Model Stitching Server’ (MSS) responsible for coordinating model adaptation and aggregation.
*   **Client Adaptation:** Each client receives a base pre-trained model from the MSS. Clients then adapt this model *locally* using their training data, as described in the base patent, but with an added component: ‘Adaptation Metadata’.
*   **Adaptation Metadata:**  For each layer modified during local adaptation, the client generates metadata detailing *how* the layer was changed (e.g., node added, hyperparameter updated, removal of node, type of modification), the rationale for the change (based on local data characteristics), and a ‘confidence score’ reflecting the certainty of the improvement. This metadata *is* transmitted to the MSS, not the layer weights themselves.
*   **MSS Stitching Algorithm:**
    1.  The MSS receives Adaptation Metadata from multiple clients.
    2.  The MSS analyzes the received metadata, identifying common modification patterns across clients.  A ‘similarity score’ is calculated between each client’s adaptation strategy.
    3.  The MSS generates a ‘Stitching Plan’, outlining how to combine the adapted layers from different clients into a new, globally optimized model. The plan prioritizes modifications with high confidence scores and strong consensus across clients.  Conflicts are resolved by either:
        *   **Averaging:** If multiple clients modify the same layer in a similar way, the changes are averaged.
        *   **Layer Selection:**  The layer from the client with the highest confidence score and/or most supporting evidence is selected.
        *   **Conditional Routing:** The MSS introduces a 'routing' mechanism. Input data characteristics determine which client's adapted layer is used for processing.
    4.  The MSS requests the *modified layers* (not the entire model) from the contributing clients.
    5.  The MSS assembles the new global model by ‘stitching’ together the selected layers.
    6.  The new global model is distributed back to the clients.

*   **Data Dependency Routing:** Integrate client-specific data characteristics into the stitching process. The system profiles client data and assigns a “data signature” to each client. The MSS uses these signatures during the stitching process to prioritize layers adapted to similar data characteristics.

*   **Hyperparameter Negotiation:** During the stitching process, the MSS negotiates hyperparameters between adapted layers. Discrepancies are resolved by adjusting hyperparameters based on a globally defined optimization function.

**Pseudocode (MSS Stitching Algorithm):**

```
function StitchModels(adaptation_metadata_list):
  similarity_matrix = CalculateSimilarity(adaptation_metadata_list)
  layer_priority_map = BuildLayerPriorityMap(similarity_matrix)

  stitched_model = NewModel()

  for layer_index in range(num_layers):
    best_client = FindBestClient(layer_index, layer_priority_map)
    modified_layer = RequestLayer(best_client, layer_index)
    stitched_model.add_layer(modified_layer)

  return stitched_model
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced privacy - raw data remains on client devices.
*   Improved model generalization - leverages diverse datasets.
*   Faster training - only modified layers are transferred.
*   Increased robustness – reduces bias from single data sources.
