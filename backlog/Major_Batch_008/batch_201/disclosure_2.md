## Dynamic Storage Command Prioritization & ‘Shadow Testing’

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamic prioritization of storage commands *and* concurrent ‘shadow testing’ of production commands on a mirrored, lightweight test environment.

**Core Concept:** The patent details a system for tagging and routing test commands. This expands on that by actively *prioritizing* all commands (production & test) based on real-time system load *and* creating a dynamic shadow copy of incoming production requests for near-instantaneous testing.

**Components:**

1.  **Command Prioritization Engine (CPE):**
    *   Input: All incoming storage commands (tagged as production/test). Real-time system metrics (IOPS, latency, CPU utilization, queue depth). User-defined priority rules (e.g., critical application commands always highest priority).
    *   Process: CPE assigns a dynamic priority score to each command.  This score isn’t static – it fluctuates based on system load.  High load = lower priority for non-critical commands.
    *   Output:  Prioritized command queue.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculatePriority(command, systemMetrics, priorityRules) {
        basePriority = command.tag == "production" ? 100 : 50;
        loadFactor = 1 - (systemMetrics.cpuUtilization / 100); // Higher load = lower factor
        priority = basePriority * loadFactor;

        //Apply user-defined rules
        if (priorityRules.criticalApp == command.appID) {
            priority += 50;
        }

        return priority;
    }
    ```

2.  **Shadow Test Environment (STE):**
    *   Lightweight replica of the production storage environment. Not a full copy – only sufficient metadata and data blocks to execute the command.
    *   Receives a copy of *every* production storage command *before* it is executed in production.
    *   Executes the command in isolation. Measures latency, resource usage, and potential errors.
    *   Results are analyzed for anomalies.

3.  **Anomaly Detection & Mitigation:**
    *   STE results are compared against baseline performance profiles and historical data.
    *   If an anomaly is detected (e.g., significantly higher latency, errors), the following actions can be taken:
        *   **Alerting:** Notify administrators.
        *   **Throttling:** Reduce the priority of similar commands.
        *   **Rollback:** If the anomaly is severe enough, roll back the command execution in production (requires versioning and transactional support).

**Data Flow:**

1.  Storage command arrives.
2.  CPE calculates priority score.
3.  Command is added to prioritized queue.
4.  Command is copied and sent to STE.
5.  STE executes command and sends results to anomaly detection.
6.  Anomaly detection analyzes results.
7.  Production command is executed.
8.  System monitors production execution for correlation with STE results.

**Novelty & Potential:**

*   **Proactive Error Detection:**  Identifies potential issues *before* they impact production users.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation:** Prioritizes critical commands during periods of high load.
*   **Reduced Blast Radius:** Isolates potentially problematic commands for testing.
*   **Real-time Performance Analysis:** Provides insights into the performance characteristics of individual commands.
*   The system can even predict failures.

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   STE must be lightweight and efficient to minimize overhead.
*   Data synchronization between production and STE must be carefully managed.
*   Anomaly detection algorithms must be accurate and reliable.
*   Security considerations are paramount, especially when handling sensitive data.
