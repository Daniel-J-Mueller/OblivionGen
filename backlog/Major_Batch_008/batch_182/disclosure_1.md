## Dynamic Authentication Profiles & Contextual Token Issuance

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing authentication paradigm beyond simple device association to encompass dynamic user profiles and contextual access permissions, issuing short-lived, narrowly scoped tokens based on real-time environmental and behavioral biometrics.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Biometric Engine (BBE):**

*   **Data Inputs:** Integrated sensor suite capturing:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure)
    *   Mouse/Touchpad movement (speed, acceleration, patterns)
    *   Gait analysis (from mobile device accelerometers - walking/running patterns)
    *   Voice analysis (cadence, tone, speech patterns) - optional
    *   Ambient sound analysis (location-based soundscape identification - e.g., home, office, coffee shop).
*   **Processing:** AI/ML model continuously learns user’s behavioral ‘signature’ – a multi-dimensional profile.  Output: a ‘Behavioral Confidence Score’ (BCS) – ranges 0-100 representing confidence in user identity.
*   **Integration:** API endpoint providing BCS to the Authentication Service.

**2. Environmental Context Engine (ECE):**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Geolocation (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons).
    *   Network information (IP address, network type - home, corporate, public).
    *   Time of day/day of week.
    *   Nearby Bluetooth/Wi-Fi devices (detecting known/trusted devices).
*   **Processing:**  Rules engine defining ‘trusted environments’ based on combined data inputs. Output: an ‘Environment Trust Score’ (ETS) – ranges 0-100 representing environment trustworthiness.
*   **Integration:** API endpoint providing ETS to the Authentication Service.

**3. Authentication Service Enhancement:**

*   **Profile Storage:** Extended user profiles storing:
    *   Behavioral Biometric Profile (BBP) – parameters learned by the BBE.
    *   Environment Trust Profiles (ETPs) – lists of trusted environments with associated ETS thresholds.
*   **Dynamic Token Issuance:**
    *   Upon initial authentication (password/biometric), establish a base session.
    *   For subsequent access requests:
        *   Obtain BCS from BBE.
        *   Obtain ETS from ECE.
        *   Compare BCS & ETS against user-defined thresholds in ETPs.
        *   If thresholds met: Issue a short-lived, narrowly scoped token granting access *only* to the requested resource within the current context. Token validity: 30-60 seconds.
        *   If thresholds *not* met:  Trigger multi-factor authentication (MFA) or deny access.
*   **Token Attributes:** Include:
    *   Resource Identifier (what the token grants access to).
    *   Context Identifier (geolocation, network, time).
    *   BCS & ETS values at issuance (for audit/fraud detection).
    *   Expiration Timestamp.

**4.  QR Code Extension:**

*   Modify QR code generation to embed *contextual data* alongside the unique identifier and authentication identifier.
*   Data fields:
    *   Current Geolocation.
    *   Network Type.
    *   Timestamp.
*   Second client device validates this contextual data *before* attempting token exchange. Discrepancies trigger MFA.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Token Issuance):**

```
function issueDynamicToken(user, resource, context) {
  BCS = getBehavioralConfidenceScore(user)
  ETS = getEnvironmentTrustScore(user, context)

  if (BCS > user.profile.BCSTreshold && ETS > user.profile.ETSTreshold) {
    token = generateToken(user, resource, context, BCS, ETS)
    return token
  } else {
    triggerMFA(user)
    return null
  }
}

function generateToken(user, resource, context, BCS, ETS) {
  token = new Token()
  token.user = user
  token.resource = resource
  token.context = context
  token.BCS = BCS
  token.ETS = ETS
  token.expiration = currentTime + 60 seconds
  return token
}
```

**Innovation:**  Shifts authentication from a static ‘who you are’ model to a dynamic ‘who you are, where you are, and how you’re behaving’ model. Reduces reliance on long-lived tokens, minimizing attack surface and improving security.  The contextual QR code verification adds an additional layer of protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.
