## Dynamic Credential Orchestration with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the core credential management system to incorporate continuous behavioral authentication, dynamically adjusting credential requirements based on observed user behavior and risk profiles. This goes beyond static affinity and session validation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Builder:**

*   **Data Sources:** Capture keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, scrolling speed, touch pressure (if applicable), app usage patterns, time of day/location patterns, and device orientation.
*   **Profiling Engine:** Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to create a baseline behavioral profile for each user. Profiles are continuously updated.
*   **Data Storage:** Securely store behavioral data (encrypted) linked to user accounts. Focus on feature vectors representing patterns, not raw data capture.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Implement differential privacy techniques to protect user data. Allow users to control data collection and profile generation.

**2. Risk Engine & Dynamic Credential Adjustment:**

*   **Risk Scoring:**  Combine behavioral anomaly detection with traditional risk factors (IP address, device fingerprint, location). Assign a real-time risk score to each authentication attempt.
*   **Credential Tiering:** Define credential tiers (e.g., Low, Medium, High). Each tier corresponds to a specific combination of authentication factors.  Examples:
    *   Low Risk:  Behavioral biometrics only.  Silent authentication.
    *   Medium Risk: Behavioral biometrics + push notification approval.
    *   High Risk: Behavioral biometrics + push notification + one-time password (OTP).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Logic:** Based on risk score, dynamically adjust the required credential tier.  The system automatically “steps up” or “steps down” authentication requirements.

**3. Integration with Existing Authentication System:**

*   **API Interface:**  Expose an API that allows the existing authentication service to query the risk score and required credential tier for a given user.
*   **Credential Orchestrator:** A module within the authentication service responsible for enforcing the dynamically adjusted requirements. It coordinates the collection of necessary credentials.
*   **Session Management Update:** Extend session validation to consider the risk score and authentication factors used during session creation.

**Pseudocode (Credential Orchestrator):**

```
function authenticate(user_id, request_data):
  risk_score = BehavioralRiskEngine.getRiskScore(user_id, request_data)
  credential_tier = RiskScoreToTierMapping.map(risk_score)

  if credential_tier == "Low":
    // Perform silent authentication based on behavioral biometrics
    if BehavioralAuthentication.isValid(user_id, request_data):
      createSession(user_id)
      return SUCCESS
    else:
      return FAILURE

  elif credential_tier == "Medium":
    // Request push notification approval
    if PushNotification.approve(user_id):
      if BehavioralAuthentication.isValid(user_id, request_data):
        createSession(user_id)
        return SUCCESS
      else:
        return FAILURE
    else:
      return FAILURE

  elif credential_tier == "High":
    // Request OTP + push notification + behavioral biometrics
    if PushNotification.approve(user_id) and OTP.verify(user_id) and BehavioralAuthentication.isValid(user_id, request_data):
        createSession(user_id)
        return SUCCESS
    else:
        return FAILURE
  else:
    return ERROR //Unknown tier
```

**4.  Adaptive Learning & Anomaly Detection:**

*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor user behavior in real-time to identify anomalies.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Use authentication success/failure events to refine behavioral profiles and improve anomaly detection accuracy.
*   **Model Updates:**  Regularly retrain machine learning models with new data to maintain performance.
