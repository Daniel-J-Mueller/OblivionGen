## Dynamic Haptic Ghosting with E-Paper

**Concept:** Expand the ‘ghosting’ technique described in the patent to incorporate localized haptic feedback synchronized with the visual ghosting effect, creating a more immersive and intuitive user experience.  This moves beyond visual ‘ghosting’ to a *perceived* persistence of interaction.

**Specifications:**

1.  **E-Paper Display Integration:** Utilize an electronic paper display (EPD) with a transparent overlay capable of supporting localized pressure or electrostatic actuation.  The overlay should not significantly impede the EPD’s contrast or refresh rate.

2.  **Haptic Actuator Array:**  Beneath the transparent overlay, implement an array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric, electrostatic, or similar). Resolution: minimum 60 actuators per square inch.  Actuators should be capable of producing subtle, localized deformations of the overlay surface.

3.  **Touch Sensor Integration:**  A highly sensitive, capacitive touch sensor (integrated into the overlay or directly on the EPD surface) is required to track user input with high precision (sub-millimeter accuracy).

4.  **Ghosting Algorithm Enhancement:** Modify the existing ghosting algorithm to incorporate haptic data.
    *   When the user interacts with the EPD (drawing, erasing, tapping), the touch sensor records the interaction area and force applied.
    *   Simultaneously, the visual ghosting algorithm renders a faded version of the interaction area.
    *   The modified algorithm calculates the corresponding haptic output (actuation pattern, intensity) for the same area, *slightly delayed* to create the illusion of continued physical interaction.
    *   The delay should be tunable based on user preference and the type of interaction.

5.  **Actuation Control:** Implement a microcontroller with dedicated DMA channels to rapidly drive the actuator array.
    *   Each actuator should be individually addressable.
    *   Control algorithm:  Focus on generating localized “bumps” or “dips” on the surface, corresponding to the fading visual ghost.
    *   Actuation intensity should be proportional to the visual ghosting intensity.
    *   Include a “smoothing” filter to prevent jarring transitions between actuator states.

6.  **Software Framework:** Develop a software framework that allows application developers to integrate dynamic haptic ghosting into their applications.
    *   API calls: `HapticGhostEnable(area, intensity, delay)`, `HapticGhostDisable(area)`.
    *   Include example applications demonstrating various use cases (e.g., sketching, note-taking, gaming).

7.  **Power Management:** Implement aggressive power management techniques to minimize the impact of the haptic system on battery life.
    *   Actuators should only be activated when a ghosting effect is active.
    *   Utilize low-power sleep modes for the microcontroller and actuators.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Event: User touches screen at (x, y) with force f
onTouch(x, y, f) {
  // Render visual ghost at (x, y) with intensity i
  renderVisualGhost(x, y, i);

  // Calculate haptic intensity based on visual intensity and force
  hapticIntensity = calculateHapticIntensity(i, f);

  // Activate actuators at (x, y) with calculated intensity
  activateActuators(x, y, hapticIntensity);
}

// Function to calculate haptic intensity
calculateHapticIntensity(visualIntensity, force) {
  // Apply scaling and offset to map visual intensity and force to haptic intensity
  hapticIntensity = (visualIntensity * scalingFactor) + (force * forceFactor) + offset;
  return hapticIntensity;
}

// Function to activate actuators
activateActuators(x, y, intensity) {
  // Map (x, y) coordinates to actuator array indices
  actuatorIndices = mapCoordinatesToIndices(x, y);

  // Set the intensity of actuators at corresponding indices
  for (index in actuatorIndices) {
    actuatorArray[index] = intensity;
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced sketching and drawing applications.
*   More immersive e-reading experience with simulated page turning.
*   Tactile feedback for games and interactive applications.
*   Accessibility features for visually impaired users.
