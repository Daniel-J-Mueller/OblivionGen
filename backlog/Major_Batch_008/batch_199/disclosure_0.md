## Temporal Data Sculpting with Multi-Resolution Bitmaps

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of encoding timestamps into index values, but move beyond simple bit interleaving. Instead, leverage multi-resolution bitmaps to represent temporal data, enabling efficient range queries *and* the ability to detect patterns and anomalies within time series data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Representation: Multi-Resolution Temporal Bitmap (MRTB)**

*   Each timestamp is associated with a bit in a bitmap.
*   Multiple bitmap layers, each representing a different temporal resolution.
    *   Layer 0: Highest resolution – Represents individual timestamps.
    *   Layer 1: Medium resolution – Aggregates time into buckets (e.g., 1-minute intervals).
    *   Layer 2+: Lower resolution – Increasingly larger time buckets (e.g., 5-minute, 30-minute, hourly, daily).
*   Bitmaps are compressed using techniques like Run-Length Encoding (RLE) or Bitmap Indexing.

**2. Index Generation & Storage**

*   For each time range (defined by start and end timestamps), generate a hierarchical index based on the MRTB.
*   Index entry: A pointer to the relevant bitmap layers and offsets within those layers.
*   Index structure: A B-Tree or similar balanced tree structure for efficient searching.
*   Metadata: Associated with each index entry:
    *   Range start/end timestamps.
    *   Number of events within the range.
    *   Statistical information (min, max, average, standard deviation).

**3. Query Processing**

*   Receive query request (start/end timestamp range).
*   Traverse the index to locate relevant bitmap layers.
*   Bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR) on bitmap layers to identify events within the range.
*   Leverage multi-resolution layers:
    *   Start with the lowest resolution layer to quickly narrow down the search.
    *   Refine the search using higher resolution layers for precision.
*   Statistical analysis: Utilize metadata to provide insights beyond simple event counts (e.g., identify anomalies, trends).

**4. Algorithm (Query Processing - Pseudocode)**

```pseudocode
function query(start_time, end_time):
  index_entry = find_index_entry(start_time, end_time) //Traverse B-Tree
  
  if index_entry is null:
    return empty result set

  lowest_resolution_layer = index_entry.layers[0]
  
  //Coarse-grained filtering using lowest resolution layer
  coarse_result = bitmap_intersection(lowest_resolution_layer, time_range(start_time, end_time))

  //Iterate through higher resolution layers for refinement
  for layer in index_entry.layers:
    refined_result = bitmap_intersection(refined_result, layer)

  //Return final result set with event timestamps
  return extract_timestamps(refined_result)
```

**5.  Anomaly Detection Module**

*   Utilize statistical information (min, max, std dev) associated with each time range.
*   Implement algorithms (e.g., moving averages, exponential smoothing) to identify deviations from expected patterns.
*   Flag anomalies based on predefined thresholds.
*   Visualize anomalies using time series charts and dashboards.

**6.  Data Modification & Index Updates**

*   When new events are ingested, update the relevant bitmap layers.
*   Implement a buffering mechanism to minimize index update overhead.
*   Periodically re-index data to optimize performance.
*   Consider a write-ahead logging strategy for data durability.
