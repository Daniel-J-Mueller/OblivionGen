## Dynamic Tag Weighting Based on Temporal Co-occurrence

**Specification:** A system extension to dynamically adjust the weight of user-assigned tags based on the *temporal co-occurrence* of items tagged with those tags. This builds on the existing user-tagging system to provide more nuanced and responsive recommendations.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of treating all tags equally, or weighting them based solely on popularity, this system analyzes *when* items with specific tags are interacted with by users. Tags associated with items frequently purchased or viewed *together* within a short timeframe receive a higher weighting during recommendation calculations.

**Components:**

1.  **Interaction Log:** A database table recording user interactions (views, purchases, add-to-cart) with items, including a timestamp.

2.  **Co-occurrence Analyzer:** A scheduled process (e.g., daily) that analyzes the Interaction Log. It identifies tag pairs that appear within a defined time window (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days) for the same user.  The frequency of co-occurrence is recorded.

3.  **Tag Weighting Function:** A function that calculates a dynamic weight for each tag based on the co-occurrence data.  

    *   `Weight(Tag) = BaseWeight + (Co-occurrenceScore * SensitivityFactor)`
        *   `BaseWeight`: A default weight assigned to all tags (configurable).
        *   `Co-occurrenceScore`:  Calculated by summing the co-occurrence frequencies for the tag across all other tags within a defined period.  Higher co-occurrence = higher score.
        *   `SensitivityFactor`:  A tunable parameter controlling how strongly co-occurrence influences the tag weight.

4.  **Recommendation Engine Integration:** The Recommendation Engine utilizes the dynamically calculated tag weights when generating recommendations.  Tags with higher weights contribute more strongly to the relevance score of candidate items.

**Pseudocode (Co-occurrence Analyzer):**

```
function AnalyzeCoOccurrence(InteractionLog, TimeWindow):
  TagCooccurrence = {} // Dictionary to store tag co-occurrence counts
  
  for each Interaction in InteractionLog:
    UserID = Interaction.UserID
    ItemID = Interaction.ItemID
    Timestamp = Interaction.Timestamp
    
    Tags = GetTagsForItem(ItemID)
    
    for each Tag1 in Tags:
      for each Tag2 in Tags:
        if Tag1 != Tag2:
          TimeDifference = Timestamp - LastInteractionTimestampForTag2(UserID)
          if TimeDifference <= TimeWindow:
            if Tag1 not in TagCooccurrence:
              TagCooccurrence[Tag1] = {}
            if Tag2 not in TagCooccurrence[Tag1]:
              TagCooccurrence[Tag1][Tag2] = 0
            TagCooccurrence[Tag1][Tag2] += 1
  return TagCooccurrence
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The `TimeWindow` and `SensitivityFactor` should be configurable parameters.
*   Consider using a decaying average to give more weight to recent co-occurrences.
*   Implement a mechanism to handle cold-start problems for new tags or infrequently interacted-with items.
*   This system can be combined with the existing tag-based recommender to provide a hybrid approach.
