## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Materials Handling

**System Overview:** A wearable haptic sleeve paired with the existing visual information system. This system aims to provide directional and contextual guidance *without* relying solely on visual display, freeing the user's gaze for object scanning and increasing safety in dynamic environments.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Haptic Sleeve:** A lightweight, breathable sleeve covering the forearm and extending slightly onto the upper arm. Embedded within the fabric are an array of micro-pneumatic actuators (or miniature linear resonant actuators - LRAs). These actuators can create localized pressure/vibration patterns.
*   **IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit):** Integrated into the sleeve to track arm and hand orientation/movement.
*   **Wireless Communication Module:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for communication with the existing information discovery system.
*   **Power Source:** Small, rechargeable battery integrated into the sleeve.
*   **Optional: Skin Conductance Sensor:** Integrated into the sleeve to monitor user stress/cognitive load.

**Software/Logic:**

1.  **Item Localization:** The existing image capture system (both wearable & fixed) identifies target items and their 3D location within the facility.
2.  **Path Planning:** The system calculates the optimal path to the target item, considering obstacles and user location.
3.  **Haptic Mapping:**  The calculated path is translated into a sequence of haptic cues.  Instead of directly indicating direction (e.g., "turn left"), the system utilizes *gradient* haptic feedback.  Stronger pressure/vibration on the skin indicates closer proximity to the optimal path.  Subtle shifts in pressure indicate course corrections.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The IMU data and continuous item tracking allow the haptic feedback to dynamically adjust to user movement and changes in the environment.
5.  **Contextual Haptics:**
    *   **Item Confirmation:**  Upon approaching a target item, a distinct haptic "pulse" confirms correct location.
    *   **Alerts:**  Critical alerts (e.g., approaching forklift) are signaled via a strong, unique haptic pattern.
    *   **Weight/Fragility Indication:** If item data includes weight or fragility, the haptic feedback can subtly adjust to communicate this. (e.g., a slight "give" in the haptic pressure for fragile items).
6.  **Cognitive Load Adjustment:** If the skin conductance sensor indicates high user stress/cognitive load, the haptic feedback simplifies, reducing the complexity of the cues.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Cue Generation):**

```
function generateHapticCue(userPosition, itemPosition, userOrientation, itemData):
    directionVector = normalize(itemPosition - userPosition)
    angleToItem = calculateAngle(directionVector, userOrientation)

    hapticIntensity = calculateIntensity(distance(userPosition, itemPosition), maxDistance)

    // Map angle to haptic actuators. Assume 4 actuators around the forearm.
    actuatorMap = {
        0-45 degrees: actuator1,
        45-90 degrees: actuator2,
        90-135 degrees: actuator3,
        135-180 degrees: actuator4
    }

    selectedActuator = actuatorMap[angleToItem]

    hapticPattern = {
        actuator: selectedActuator,
        intensity: hapticIntensity,
        type: "guidance" // or "alert", "confirmation", etc.
    }

    // Adjust haptic pattern based on item data (weight, fragility) and user stress levels

    return hapticPattern
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Actuator density and placement are crucial for precise haptic feedback.
*   Power management is critical for extended battery life.
*   Fabric design must be breathable and comfortable for extended wear.
*   Wireless communication must be reliable and low-latency.
*   Software should be modular and configurable to support various facility layouts and item types.
