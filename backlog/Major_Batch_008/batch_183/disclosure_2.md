## Autonomous Network ‘Healing’ via Predictive Failure Analysis

**System Overview:**

This system extends the existing network testing framework by incorporating predictive failure analysis and automated remediation. It aims to move beyond reactive testing (identifying existing failures) to proactively identifying potential failures *before* they impact network performance, and automatically taking steps to mitigate those risks.

**Components:**

1.  **Baseline Performance Profiler:** Continuously monitors key network metrics (latency, jitter, packet loss, bandwidth utilization) for each device and connection. Establishes a baseline "healthy" performance profile for each element. This is a continuous learning system.
2.  **Anomaly Detection Engine:** Compares current performance metrics to the established baseline. Uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series forecasting, anomaly detection algorithms) to identify deviations from the norm.  Critical: this isn't just looking for *errors*; it's looking for *trends*.
3.  **Predictive Failure Model:**  Uses historical data, anomaly detection results, and environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity – obtained from device sensors or external sources) to predict the probability of failure for individual devices or connections. The model should account for cascading failures - one failure triggering others.
4.  **Automated Remediation Engine:**  Based on the predicted failure probability, this engine initiates automated remediation steps. These steps could include:
    *   **Traffic Re-Routing:**  Dynamically re-route traffic around potentially failing devices or connections.
    *   **Resource Allocation:**  Increase bandwidth allocation to critical paths.
    *   **Interface Adjustment:** Modify interface settings (e.g., speed, duplex) to optimize performance.
    *   **Automated Testing Initiation:** Trigger targeted tests (similar to those in the provided patent) to further investigate potential issues. This is a feedback loop.
5.  **Network Topology Service Integration:**  Leverages the existing network topology service to understand the network layout and identify potential impact zones of failures.
6.  **Centralized Management Interface:** Provides network administrators with a dashboard to monitor network health, predicted failures, and automated remediation actions.

**Pseudocode (Remediation Engine):**

```
function remediate(device, connection, predicted_failure_probability):
  if predicted_failure_probability > threshold_high:
    // Critical failure likely - aggressive action
    reroute_traffic(connection, alternate_path)
    increase_bandwidth(connection)
    log_event("Critical failure predicted - aggressive remediation")

  elif predicted_failure_probability > threshold_medium:
    // Potential issue - moderate action
    optimize_interface(device)
    schedule_targeted_test(device, connection)
    log_event("Potential issue detected - moderate remediation")

  elif predicted_failure_probability > threshold_low:
    // Early warning - passive monitoring
    increase_monitoring_frequency(device, connection)
    log_event("Early warning detected - increased monitoring")

  else:
    // Normal operation
    log_event("Normal operation")
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Devices continuously stream performance data to the Baseline Performance Profiler.
2.  The Profiler creates and maintains baseline profiles.
3.  The Anomaly Detection Engine compares current data to baselines, flagging anomalies.
4.  The Predictive Failure Model uses anomalies, historical data, and environmental factors to predict failure probabilities.
5.  The Automated Remediation Engine acts based on predicted probabilities.
6.  All events are logged and accessible through the Centralized Management Interface.

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simple network testing to proactive network healing.  The predictive failure analysis, combined with automated remediation, significantly improves network reliability and reduces downtime. The integration of environmental factors and the dynamic adjustment of remediation actions based on predicted probabilities provide a more intelligent and adaptive network management solution. It moves away from merely identifying *what is broken* to preventing failures from happening in the first place.
