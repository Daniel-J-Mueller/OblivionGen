## Personalized "Style Genome" Bundling

**Concept:** Expand the item concept relatedness beyond co-acquisition and into a deeply personalized “Style Genome” for each user. This moves beyond simply predicting what someone might *buy with* an item, to understanding *why* they buy things and proactively suggesting items that align with their individual aesthetic profile.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Style Genome Data Acquisition:**
    *   Initial Profile: User onboarding includes a visually-driven “style quiz”. Instead of selecting preferences from lists, users interact with images – "like/dislike/neutral" on a stream of diverse product and lifestyle imagery.
    *   Continuous Learning:  Tracking *all* user interaction – not just purchases. This includes:
        *   Browse history (time spent on pages, zoom level on images, etc.)
        *   Social media linking (optional) - analyze publicly available aesthetic data (Pinterest boards, Instagram follows).
        *   Image Uploads - Allow users to upload images of things they like (clothing, furniture, art) to further refine their profile.
        *   "Mood" Input - Users can specify a desired "mood" or occasion (e.g., "cozy night in," "business casual," "tropical vacation") to contextualize recommendations.

2.  **Style Genome Representation:**
    *   Embedding Creation: Utilize a multimodal neural network to generate a high-dimensional vector embedding representing each user’s Style Genome. Input modalities:
        *   Visual Features:  Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) extract features from liked/disliked images and browse history.
        *   Textual Features: Natural Language Processing (NLP) analyzes product descriptions, user search queries, and (if opted-in) social media data.
        *   Behavioral Features: User interaction data (time spent, zoom level) is incorporated as weighted numerical values.
    *   Dimensionality Reduction: Apply techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to reduce the dimensionality of the embedding while preserving key aesthetic characteristics.

3.  **Item Concept Expansion & Mapping:**
    *   Enhanced Item Tagging:  Beyond basic categories, each item is tagged with a rich set of aesthetic attributes (color palettes, patterns, textures, silhouettes, style keywords - e.g., “minimalist,” “bohemian,” “industrial”).  This is done via a combination of manual curation and computer vision.
    *   Item Embedding Creation:  Generate vector embeddings for each item using the same neural network architecture as the user Style Genome, trained on item images and descriptions.
    *   Concept Relatedness Calculation:  Calculate the cosine similarity between user Style Genome embeddings and item embeddings to determine aesthetic relatedness.

4.  **Dynamic Bundle Generation:**
    *   Bundle Scoring:  Instead of solely relying on co-acquisition data, calculate a bundle score based on:
        *   Aesthetic Relatedness: Average cosine similarity between each item in the bundle and the user’s Style Genome.
        *   Complementarity:  Analyze item attributes to ensure the bundle is "complete" (e.g., if a user buys a shirt, recommend matching pants or accessories).
        *   Co-Acquisition Data:  Maintain a weighting factor for traditional co-acquisition data, but reduce its overall impact.
    *   Real-time Adjustment: Continuously refine bundle recommendations based on user feedback (purchases, clicks, skips).
    *   "Complete Look" Presentation: Present bundles as visually cohesive “complete looks” or outfits, rather than just a list of individual items.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Generation):**

```
function generate_bundle(user_id, initial_item_id):
  user_genome = get_user_genome(user_id)
  initial_item = get_item(initial_item_id)
  initial_item_embedding = get_item_embedding(initial_item)

  candidate_items = get_candidate_items(initial_item) // items in same category, viewed by similar users
  scored_items = []

  for item in candidate_items:
    item_embedding = get_item_embedding(item)
    aesthetic_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_genome, item_embedding)
    complementarity_score = calculate_complementarity(initial_item, item)
    coacquisition_score = get_coacquisition_score(initial_item, item)

    bundle_score = (0.6 * aesthetic_similarity) + (0.2 * complementarity_score) + (0.2 * coacquisition_score)
    scored_items.append((item, bundle_score))

  sorted_items = sorted(scored_items, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  recommended_items = sorted_items[:5] // Top 5 recommendations

  return recommended_items
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   Focus on scalable neural network architectures for embedding generation.
*   Utilize cloud-based infrastructure for handling large datasets and real-time calculations.
*   Implement A/B testing to optimize bundle scoring weights and recommendation algorithms.
*   Prioritize data privacy and user control over data collection and usage.
