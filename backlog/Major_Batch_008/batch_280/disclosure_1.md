## Adaptive Content Granularity & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the tile-based rendering approach by dynamically adjusting tile granularity *and* proactively prefetching tiles based on predicted user interaction. This moves beyond simply reusing rendered tiles to optimizing the rendering *process itself* for perceived performance gains.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Decomposition:**  Instead of fixed-size tiles, the system analyzes content (text, images, video) to determine *semantic* units.  For example, a paragraph of text, a distinct object in an image, or a shot in a video.  These semantic units become the basis for ‘dynamic tiles’.  Units are tagged with estimated rendering cost (CPU/GPU time, memory usage).
*   **Granularity Adjustment:**  A ‘Granularity Manager’ monitors user interaction (scroll speed, viewport focus, mouse movements).  It dynamically adjusts the size of dynamic tiles.  
    *   Fast scrolling/zooming: Larger tiles are used for areas *outside* the immediate viewport to minimize rendering overhead.
    *   Detailed examination:  Smaller, higher-resolution tiles are generated for areas under focus.
    *   The Granularity Manager prioritizes rendering requests based on estimated rendering cost and user interaction.
*   **Predictive Prefetching:**
    *   A ‘Behavioral Model’ analyzes user interaction patterns (scroll history, viewport movement, content consumption habits) to predict likely future content requests.
    *   Based on the Behavioral Model, the system proactively prefetches tiles likely to be needed soon.
    *   Prefetching is prioritized based on:
        *   Predicted time to render.
        *   Network bandwidth availability.
        *   Current system load.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:**
    *   A modified Virtual Rendering Engine handles requests for dynamic tiles.
    *   The Engine manages the tile cache and coordinates rendering requests.
    *   Rendering requests are submitted to a job queue prioritized by the Granularity Manager.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `ContentUnit`:  Represents a semantic unit of content. Includes: `content_type`, `estimated_render_cost`, `resolution`, `bounding_box`.
    *   `TileRequest`:  Represents a request for a tile.  Includes: `content_unit`, `resolution`, `coordinates`.
    *   `BehavioralModel`:  Stores user interaction data and predicts future requests. Uses a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
    *   `TileCache`:  Stores rendered tiles.  Uses an LRU or LFU eviction policy.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Manager):**

```
function adjust_tile_granularity(user_interaction_data, content_area):
  scroll_speed = user_interaction_data.scroll_speed
  viewport_focus = user_interaction_data.viewport_focus
  
  if scroll_speed > threshold_fast_scroll:
    tile_size = large_tile_size //Reduce rendering cost in periphery
  elif viewport_focus:
    tile_size = small_tile_size // Render detailed content
  else:
    tile_size = medium_tile_size
    
  return tile_size
  
function prioritize_rendering_requests(rendering_requests):
  //Sort requests by: (estimated_render_cost * distance_from_viewport)
  //Higher priority given to lower cost and nearby requests
  sorted_requests = sort(rendering_requests, by: (cost * distance))
  return sorted_requests
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved perceived performance and responsiveness.
*   Reduced rendering overhead and resource consumption.
*   Enhanced user experience through smoother scrolling and faster loading times.
*   More efficient use of network bandwidth.
