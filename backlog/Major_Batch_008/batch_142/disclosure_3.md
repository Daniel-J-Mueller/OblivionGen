## Dynamic ASR Artifact Composition with Generative Models

**Concept:** Extend the existing dynamic ASR artifact selection by *generating* artifacts on-the-fly based on contextual cues, rather than relying solely on pre-generated sets. This addresses the limitations of anticipating every possible conversational scenario with pre-built artifacts.

**Specs:**

1.  **Core Component:** A Generative ASR Module (GAM). This module comprises a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model trained on a massive corpus of speech and text, incorporating the custom vocabulary. It’s not a single model, but a collection of specialized “skill” models, each focused on a particular domain or conversational pattern (e.g., ordering food, technical support, casual conversation).

2.  **Contextual Input Vector (CIV):** The GAM receives a CIV comprising:
    *   **Current User Utterance:** The raw audio input.
    *   **Chatbot State:** Intent, slots, dialogue history (last N turns), user profile data.
    *   **Runtime Hints:**  Any external data available (e.g., time of day, location, current weather).
    *   **Confidence Scores from Initial ASR:**  The output of a basic, general-purpose ASR system (to provide a baseline and identify potential areas for improvement).

3.  **Skill Selection:** A Skill Router, a lightweight neural network, analyzes the CIV and selects the most relevant GAM skill(s).  This could involve multi-label classification, allowing for blended artifact generation.  The router's architecture is designed for low latency.

4.  **Dynamic Artifact Generation:** The selected GAM skill(s) process the CIV and generate a *weighted graph* representing potential phonetic transcriptions and corresponding confidence scores.  This graph is designed to be a direct replacement for the “first type of artifacts” described in the patent. The weights capture the likelihood of each transcription given the context.

5.  **Artifact Blending:** A Fusion Layer combines the dynamically generated graph with the pre-generated ASR artifacts (the "second type"). This is done using a learned weighting scheme, allowing the system to leverage the strengths of both approaches.  The weighting is determined based on the confidence scores from both sources.

6.  **Decoding with Blended Artifacts:** The decoding process uses the blended artifact graph to generate the final text output.  The decoder is a deep neural network (as suggested in the patent) optimized for low latency and high accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Skill Router):**

```
function select_skill(CIV):
  skill_scores = neural_network(CIV) // Outputs scores for each skill
  sorted_skills = sort(skill_scores, descending=True)
  top_n_skills = sorted_skills[:3] // Select top 3 skills
  return top_n_skills
```

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Artifact Generation):**

```
function generate_artifact(CIV, skill):
  artifact_graph = transformer_model(CIV, skill) // Skill-specific transformer generates weighted graph
  return artifact_graph
```

**Innovation:**  This approach moves beyond simply *selecting* from pre-existing artifacts to *creating* artifacts tailored to the specific conversational context.  It introduces a level of adaptability and personalization that is not possible with static artifact sets. By employing skill-specific transformer models, the system can achieve higher accuracy and lower latency than a single, general-purpose model.
