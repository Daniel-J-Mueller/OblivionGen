## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' & Predictive Remediation

**Concept:** Extend the existing network health monitoring and remediation system by introducing a ‘shadowing’ mechanism. Instead of *only* reacting to event logs and prioritizing tasks based on current health, the system proactively simulates potential network failures and dynamically adjusts remediation tasks *before* issues manifest. This relies on creating ‘shadow networks’ – virtual representations of network segments – to run predictive analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Network Creation Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time network topology data, historical performance data, event logs, health data from existing network devices.
*   **Process:**
    *   Dynamically generate virtual network replicas (shadow networks) representing critical network segments. The granularity of these segments is configurable (e.g., VLANs, subnets, individual device groups).
    *   Populate shadow networks with synthetic data mirroring real-time traffic patterns (derived from historical data and current monitoring).
    *   Introduce controlled ‘fault injections’ into the shadow networks – simulating device failures, link outages, bandwidth saturation, and security breaches. These fault injections are parameterized (severity, duration, frequency).
*   **Output:** Multiple active shadow networks, each running under different simulated failure scenarios.

**2. Predictive Analysis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Data streams from active shadow networks (performance metrics, error rates, latency), historical performance data, current network health data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, anomaly detection) to predict the impact of simulated failures on the real network.
    *   Quantify the 'risk score' for each simulated failure scenario. This score considers the severity of the potential impact, the likelihood of the failure occurring, and the criticality of the affected network segment.
    *   Identify proactive remediation tasks that can mitigate the predicted impact.

**3. Dynamic Remediation Task Adjustment Module:**

*   **Input:** Risk scores from the Predictive Analysis Engine, existing prioritized task list, current network health data.
*   **Process:**
    *   Dynamically adjust the prioritization of existing tasks based on the predicted risk. Tasks that address potential issues identified in the shadow networks are elevated in priority.
    *   Generate *new* remediation tasks specifically designed to address the predicted issues. These tasks may involve pre-provisioning spare capacity, re-routing traffic, or applying security patches.
    *   Dispatch the adjusted task list to the network devices.
    *   Implement a feedback loop – monitor the impact of the dynamically adjusted tasks and refine the predictive models accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Task Adjustment):**

```
function AdjustTasks(RiskScores, CurrentTaskList, NetworkHealth) {
  for each RiskScore in RiskScores {
    if (RiskScore.Severity > Threshold) {
      // Elevate priority of relevant tasks
      for each Task in CurrentTaskList {
        if (Task.AddressesIssue(RiskScore.Issue)) {
          Task.Priority = RiskScore.Severity;
        }
      }
      // Generate new task if no existing task addresses the issue
      if (NoExistingTaskAddresses(RiskScore.Issue)) {
        NewTask = GenerateTask(RiskScore.Issue);
        NewTask.Priority = RiskScore.Severity;
        CurrentTaskList.Add(NewTask);
      }
    }
  }
  return CurrentTaskList;
}

function GenerateTask(Issue) {
  // Logic to create a remediation task based on the identified issue
  // This could involve script generation, API calls to network devices, etc.
  // For example:
  if (Issue == "LinkOutage") {
    Task = "Re-route traffic through alternate path";
  } else if (Issue == "BandwidthSaturation") {
    Task = "Increase bandwidth allocation";
  }
  // ... other issue-specific task generation logic
  return Task;
}
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources to run multiple shadow networks concurrently. Cloud-based infrastructure is ideal.
*   Machine learning models need to be trained on large datasets of network performance data.
*   Integration with existing network management systems is essential.
*   Consider using a containerization technology (e.g., Docker) to deploy and manage shadow network instances.
