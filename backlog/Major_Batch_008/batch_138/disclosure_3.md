## Adaptive Label Clustering & Contextualization

**Concept:** Extend label orientation to dynamically group and contextualize labels based on user proximity, viewing angle, and semantic relationship. Instead of purely rotational adjustments, leverage spatial audio and augmented reality (AR) overlays to create a more immersive and informative map experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensor Fusion & Proximity Detection:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate existing accelerometer data with depth sensors (e.g., time-of-flight or structured light) and optionally, eye-tracking data.
*   **Proximity Zones:** Define concentric proximity zones around the user.  Zone 1 (immediate) – Labels visible within a 30cm radius. Zone 2 (near) – 1-3m radius. Zone 3 (distant) – beyond 3m.
*   **Data Fusion Algorithm:** 
    *   `proximity = depth_sensor_data`
    *   `angle = accelerometer_data + eye_tracking_data (optional)`
    *   `label_priority = proximity * (1 - angle_difference)` 
    *   `angle_difference` is a normalized value between 0 and 1, representing the angular difference between the label’s orientation and the user’s gaze/facing direction.

**2. Dynamic Label Clustering:**

*   **Semantic Analysis:** Implement a natural language processing (NLP) module to analyze label text and identify semantic relationships (e.g., "restaurant," "hotel," "museum" all fall under "points of interest").
*   **Cluster Formation:**  
    *   `IF proximity < Zone 2 AND semantic_relationship == TRUE THEN`
    *   `group labels into a 'smart cluster' with a representative icon.`
    *   `display cluster icon on map`
    *   `on user interaction (tap/voice command) expand cluster to reveal individual labels.`
*   **Cluster Density Control:** Adjust cluster size and icon complexity based on label density. Prevent overwhelming the user with too much information.

**3. Spatial Audio Integration:**

*   **Audio Cues:** Assign unique audio cues (short, distinct sounds) to each label type or cluster.
*   **3D Sound Positioning:**  Position audio cues in 3D space relative to the user’s location and the label’s position on the map.
*   **Audio Focus:**  Emphasize audio cues for labels within the user’s immediate proximity (Zone 1). Reduce volume or apply spatial filtering for distant labels.

**4. AR Overlay & Label Projection:**

*   **AR View Mode:**  Enable an AR view mode where labels are projected onto the real-world scene using the device’s camera.
*   **Dynamic Label Anchoring:**  Anchor labels to corresponding features in the real world using computer vision algorithms.
*   **Label Information Panel:** On user selection, display a detailed information panel with text, images, and interactive elements.

**5.  Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**

*   **Learning Algorithm:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to dynamically adjust the threshold angles based on user behavior and preferences.
*   **User Feedback Mechanism:** Allow users to provide feedback on label orientation and clustering (e.g., thumbs up/down, "more like this").
*   **Personalized Map Experience:**  Create a personalized map experience tailored to individual user needs and preferences.

**Pseudocode for Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

```
FUNCTION adjust_threshold(user_feedback, current_threshold):
  IF user_feedback == "thumbs_up":
    threshold = threshold + learning_rate  // Increase threshold
  ELSE IF user_feedback == "thumbs_down":
    threshold = threshold - learning_rate  // Decrease threshold
  ELSE:
    threshold = threshold // Maintain Current Value
  RETURN threshold
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Device with accelerometer, depth sensor (ToF or Structured Light), optional eye-tracking sensor, camera, and processing power for NLP and computer vision tasks.
*   Spatial audio headphones or speakers.
