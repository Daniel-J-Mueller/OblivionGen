## Dynamic Video Stitching Based on Emotional Resonance

**Concept:** Expand the idea of selecting video segments based on textual quotes to include *emotional* analysis of both the video and accompanying text (subtitles, transcripts). This allows for the creation of video summaries – or entirely new video compositions – that prioritize emotionally resonant moments, even if those moments don’t contain explicit “quotes.”

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Analysis Modules:**

*   **Video Emotion Recognition:**  A module utilizing computer vision to analyze facial expressions, body language, and scene aesthetics (color palettes, camera movement) to determine the dominant emotional tone of a video segment. Output:  A vector representing emotional intensity across dimensions (joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, neutral).
*   **Text Emotion Analysis:**  An NLP module analyzing subtitle or transcript text to determine emotional tone. Output: A vector representing emotional intensity across the same dimensions as the video analysis. Incorporate sentiment analysis *and* emotion classification.  Consider using models pre-trained on emotional speech data as well.

**2.  Resonance Scoring Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Emotional vectors from both video and text analysis for each segment.
*   **Process:** Calculate a “Resonance Score” for each segment by comparing the emotional vectors.  Utilize cosine similarity or a weighted Euclidean distance metric. Weighting allows prioritization of certain emotions (e.g., prioritizing ‘joy’ over ‘neutral’). 
*   **Output:** Resonance Score for each video segment.

**3.  Dynamic Stitching Engine:**

*   **Input:**  A source video, subtitle/transcript data, Resonance Scores for each segment, and user-defined parameters (desired summary length, emotional focus – e.g., “Show me the most joyful moments”, “Create a suspenseful trailer”).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Segment Selection:**  Select segments based on a threshold Resonance Score *and* user-defined parameters.  Segments with high Resonance Scores and matching emotional focus are prioritized.
    2.  **Temporal Smoothing:**  Implement a “smoothness” metric to avoid jarring cuts between segments.  This metric penalizes abrupt changes in emotional tone or visual style.  A dynamic programming algorithm can be used to find the optimal sequence of segments that maximizes Resonance Score *and* smoothness.
    3.  **Adaptive Segment Trimming:** Trim the selected segment to the most emotionally dense portion. Analyze the emotional curve within each segment and remove leading/trailing frames with low emotional impact.
    4.  **Transition Generation:** Generate visually appropriate transitions between segments. Transitions should reflect the emotional change between segments. Example: A slow fade for gradual emotional shifts, a fast cut for abrupt changes.
    5. **Audio Blending**: Blend or adjust audio levels to ensure seamless transitions between segments, and potentially introduce background music that aligns with the emotional tone.

*   **Output:**  A new video composition consisting of selected and stitched segments.



**4.  User Interface Components:**

*   **Emotional Filter Sliders:** Allow users to prioritize specific emotions (joy, sadness, anger, etc.).
*   **Smoothness Control:**  Allow users to adjust the trade-off between emotional impact and temporal smoothness.
*   **Summary Length Control:**  Allow users to specify the desired length of the summary.
*   **Emotion Visualization:** A visual representation of the emotional arc of the source video and the generated summary.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def generate_emotional_summary(source_video, subtitles, desired_length, emotional_focus):
    segments = segment_video(source_video)
    resonance_scores = calculate_resonance_scores(segments, subtitles)
    filtered_segments = filter_segments_by_score_and_focus(segments, resonance_scores, emotional_focus)
    optimal_sequence = find_optimal_segment_sequence(filtered_segments, desired_length)
    stitched_video = stitch_segments(optimal_sequence)
    return stitched_video
```
