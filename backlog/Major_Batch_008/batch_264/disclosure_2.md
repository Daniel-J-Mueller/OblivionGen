## Adaptive Probabilistic Bloom Tree for Dynamic Data Streams

**Concept:** Extend the probabilistic indexing to not just handle textual data, but dynamically adapting to evolving data *characteristics* within a continuous stream. The existing patent focuses on building and merging tries/probabilistic data structures. This expands on that by adding a layer of self-optimization based on observed query patterns and data drift.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:** A hierarchical Bloom tree. Each node represents a probabilistic index (like a trie, but generalized for non-string data too).  Nodes at lower levels represent finer-grained indices.
*   **Dynamic Node Splitting/Merging:**  Monitor query performance at each node. If a node experiences a high false positive rate *or* becomes a bottleneck (high query latency), split it into multiple sub-nodes. Conversely, if nodes have low utilization, merge them. Splitting/merging is triggered by configurable thresholds.
*   **Data Drift Detection:**  Implement a statistical drift detection mechanism (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) to monitor the distribution of incoming data.  Significant drift triggers a restructuring of the Bloom tree – rebalancing and potentially rebuilding portions of it to better represent the new data distribution.
*   **Adaptive Granularity:**  Each node can adaptively adjust its ‘granularity’ – the level of detail it stores.  Higher granularity means more precise indexing, but more memory usage. This is controlled by a cost-benefit analysis: if the increased precision significantly reduces false positives, increase granularity.
*   **Query Routing:** Queries are initially routed to the root node. Each node then intelligently directs the query to the most relevant sub-node based on precomputed data summaries (e.g., min/max values, histograms) and the query criteria. This minimizes unnecessary traversal.
*   **Metadata:** Each node maintains metadata including:
    *   False positive rate
    *   Query latency
    *   Data distribution statistics
    *   Node utilization
    *   Last restructured timestamp
*   **Resource Management:** Implement resource limits for each node (memory, CPU). If a node exceeds its limits, trigger a merging or pruning operation.
*   **Bloom Filter Integration:**  Each node *also* includes a traditional Bloom filter as a first-pass filter. This quickly eliminates entries that are definitely *not* present, reducing the load on the probabilistic index.

**Pseudocode (Node Splitting Logic):**

```
function splitNode(node):
  if (node.falsePositiveRate() > threshold AND node.queryLatency() > latencyThreshold):
    // Identify split criteria (e.g., based on most frequent prefixes/values)
    splitCriteria = analyzeNodeData(node)

    // Create two (or more) child nodes based on the split criteria
    childNode1 = createChildNode(splitCriteria)
    childNode2 = createChildNode(splitCriteria)

    // Redistribute data from the current node to the child nodes
    redistributeData(node, childNode1, childNode2)

    // Update the parent node to point to the new child nodes
    updateParentNode(node, childNode1, childNode2)

    return true // Split successful
  else:
    return false // No split needed
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time fraud detection in streaming financial transactions.
*   Personalized recommendation systems based on user activity streams.
*   Anomaly detection in sensor networks.
*   Efficient indexing of large-scale log data.
