## Adaptive Environmental Mapping & Anticipatory Guidance

**Concept:** Extend the orientation guidance system to proactively map the user's environment *before* object identification is initiated, using subtle cues to anticipate likely objects and dynamically adjust guidance overlays. This creates a more intuitive and efficient identification process.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate LiDAR or Time-of-Flight sensors alongside the camera. This provides depth information for a rudimentary environmental map.
*   **Mapping Module:**
    *   Continuously scan the surrounding environment in the background while the device is active.
    *   Create a sparse point cloud representation of the environment.
    *   Identify planar surfaces (walls, tables, floors) and potential object locations (gaps between surfaces).
*   **Anticipatory Guidance Overlays:**
    *   Based on the environmental map, display subtle, contextual guidance overlays *before* the user actively seeks to identify an object.
        *   Example: If the map indicates a shelf, display a faint outline suggesting a potential location for books or other shelf-appropriate objects.
        *   Example: If a table is detected, display a general 'object here' indicator.
    *   These overlays are *not* specific object suggestions, but rather probability zones.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   As the user moves the device, the environmental map is updated in real-time, and the guidance overlays shift accordingly.
    *   When the user *initiates* object identification (e.g., presses a button), the system transitions to the existing orientation guidance mode, but *pre-populated* with potential areas identified by the anticipatory mapping.
*   **AI-Driven Refinement:**
    *   Implement a machine learning model that learns from user behavior.
    *   The model predicts likely objects based on the environment (e.g., a kitchen is more likely to contain cookware).
    *   The AI refines the anticipatory guidance overlays over time, increasing accuracy and relevance.

**Pseudocode (Mapping Module):**

```
// Background Process
while (deviceActive) {
  captureDepthData()
  buildSparsePointCloud(depthData)
  identifyPlanarSurfaces(pointCloud)
  detectObjectLocations(pointCloud, planarSurfaces)

  // Store potential object zones
  storePotentialObjectZones(objectZones)

  //Update the pre-identification guidance overlays
  updatePreIdentificationOverlays(objectZones)

}
```

**Innovation:** This shifts the focus from reactive object identification to proactive environmental awareness. The user isn't simply being guided to *find* an object; the device is subtly preparing the user for potential objects *before* they even think to look. This creates a more fluid and intuitive user experience, reducing cognitive load and improving identification speed. The dynamic environmental mapping also opens possibilities for context-aware applications beyond object identification, like augmented reality experiences or intelligent home automation.
