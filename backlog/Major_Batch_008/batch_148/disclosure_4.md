## Dynamic Haptic Feedback System – ‘Feel the Scale’

**Concept:** Expand beyond visual pan & zoom to incorporate localized haptic feedback on the device itself, simulating the ‘feel’ of the image scaling and translation. This goes beyond simple vibration and aims for nuanced tactile representation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-density array of micro-actuators embedded beneath the device's surface (screen area & surrounding bezel).  These actuators should be capable of precise, localized deformation. Piezoelectric or micro-electromagnetic actuators preferred for speed & precision. Minimum 50 actuators per 100mm<sup>2</sup>.
    *   Array must be covered in a durable, flexible material (e.g., silicone) to distribute force evenly and provide a comfortable tactile experience.
    *   Dedicated processor core for haptic rendering (offloads processing from main CPU/GPU).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Haptic Rendering Engine:**  Takes scaling factor and translation vector from the pan/zoom gesture detection as input.
    *   **Scale Mapping:**  Scaling factor is translated into a ‘radial force’ –  the actuator array exerts increasing force outwards from a central point on the device corresponding to the current zoom focus.  Higher scaling = stronger radial force. The force profile should be configurable (linear, exponential, logarithmic) to allow for customized ‘feel’.
    *   **Translation Mapping:**  Translation vector is mapped to a directional ‘pressure shift’ across the actuator array.  If the image is panning ‘up’, actuators on the bottom edge of the device apply slight pressure; panning ‘right’ activates actuators on the left edge, and so on.
    *   **Dynamic Friction Simulation:** Introduce adjustable 'friction' to the haptic experience, simulating the texture of the scaled image.  Rough textures increase the force required to 'pan' or 'zoom' – implemented by increasing actuator resistance.
    *   **Multi-Touch Differentiation:**  System must distinguish between intentional pan/zoom gestures and incidental touch/grip.  Thresholds for gesture recognition must be adjustable.
    *   **User Customization:**  Allow users to adjust haptic intensity, force profiles, and friction levels.  Preset profiles for different image types (e.g., maps, photos, 3D models).
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Engine):**

```
function generateHapticFeedback(scalingFactor, translationVector, imageType):
  // 1. Determine Haptic Intensity based on scalingFactor & imageType
  hapticIntensity = calculateIntensity(scalingFactor, imageType)

  // 2. Calculate Radial Force for Zoom (center is device center)
  radialForceProfile = getForceProfile(imageType) //linear, exponential etc.
  radialForce = radialForceProfile(hapticIntensity)

  // 3. Calculate Directional Pressure for Pan
  panDirection = normalizeVector(translationVector)
  panPressure = calculatePressure(panDirection, hapticIntensity)

  // 4. Apply Forces to Actuator Array
  applyRadialForce(radialForce)
  applyPanPressure(panPressure)
```

*   **Potential Use Cases:**
    *   Mapping applications: Feel the scale of the map, simulating terrain elevation.
    *   Photo editing:  Tactile feedback during zooming and panning for precise adjustments.
    *   3D modeling/CAD:  'Feel' the shape and dimensions of the model.
    *   Accessibility: Provide tactile feedback for visually impaired users.
