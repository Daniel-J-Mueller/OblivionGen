## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Embedding with Temporal Context

**Concept:** Extend metadata encoding to include a dynamic, learned embedding representing the acoustic scene, evolving over time, and layered *within* the audio stream itself. This allows for significantly richer contextual understanding by downstream applications beyond simple property flags (like 'near end speech').

**Specs:**

**1. Acoustic Scene Embedding Generation:**

*   **Model:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically a GRU or LSTM – on a large dataset of diverse acoustic scenes (home, office, street, vehicle, etc.). The RNN takes raw audio (or spectral features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients – MFCCs) as input and outputs a fixed-length embedding vector representing the current acoustic scene.
*   **Temporal Smoothing:** Implement a moving average filter on the RNN’s output embedding vectors to create a temporally smoothed representation.  This reduces jitter and provides a more stable scene representation.  Window size adjustable (e.g., 0.5s – 2s).
*   **Dimensionality:** Embedding vector size: 64-128 dimensions.  Tunable based on scene complexity and desired accuracy.
*   **Quantization:** Quantize the embedding vector to a lower bit depth (e.g., 8-bit or 16-bit) for efficient encoding.

**2. Metadata Integration & Encoding:**

*   **Hybrid Encoding:**  Instead of *replacing* audio samples with metadata (as the patent describes), *interleave* metadata bits with LSBs of audio samples, but only during periods of relative audio stability (low energy or silence detection). This minimizes audible distortion.
*   **Framing:** Divide the audio stream into frames (e.g., 20-30ms).  Each frame will contain:
    *   A primary audio block.
    *   A metadata block containing:
        *   Quantized acoustic scene embedding vector.
        *   Version type data (embedding version, quantization scheme).
        *   Header data (frame number, checksum).
        *   Optional flags (ERLE data, wake word indicator as in the original patent).
*   **Adaptive Bit Allocation:**  Dynamically adjust the number of bits allocated to the embedding vector based on the audio content.  During periods of high audio activity, reduce embedding bit depth to prioritize audio fidelity.
*   **Error Correction:** Implement a Reed-Solomon error correction code on the metadata block to improve robustness against transmission errors.

**3. Decoding & Application Integration:**

*   **Metadata Extraction:** Downstream application extracts metadata from interleaved audio frames.
*   **Embedding Reconstruction:**  Reconstruct the quantized acoustic scene embedding vector.
*   **Scene Classification:** The application uses the reconstructed embedding to:
    *   Classify the current acoustic scene (home, office, etc.).
    *   Adjust audio processing parameters (e.g., noise reduction filters, beamforming algorithms).
    *   Trigger context-aware actions (e.g., activate a specific voice assistant mode).
*   **Semantic Understanding:**  Feed the embedding vector into a larger AI model (e.g., a transformer network) for more complex semantic understanding of the audio environment.

**Pseudocode (Encoding):**

```
function encode_audio(audio_data, embedding_vector):
    frame_size = 20ms
    for each frame in audio_data:
        if energy(frame) < threshold: # Check for quiet period
            quantized_embedding = quantize(embedding_vector)
            metadata_block = create_metadata_block(quantized_embedding)
            encoded_frame = interleave_bits(frame, metadata_block)
        else:
            encoded_frame = frame  # Use original audio frame
        output_frames.append(encoded_frame)
    return output_frames
```

**Pseudocode (Decoding):**

```
function decode_audio(encoded_audio_data):
    decoded_frames = []
    for each encoded_frame in encoded_audio_data:
        if frame_contains_metadata(encoded_frame):
            metadata_block = extract_metadata(encoded_frame)
            embedding_vector = dequantize(metadata_block.embedding)
            audio_frame = metadata_block.audio_frame
        else:
            audio_frame = encoded_frame
        decoded_frames.append(audio_frame)
    return decoded_frames, embedding_vector
```

**Novelty:** The core novelty is moving beyond simple metadata flags to a learned, dynamic embedding of the acoustic scene, embedded directly within the audio stream. This allows for a much richer understanding of the audio context and enables more sophisticated audio processing and AI applications.  The adaptive bit allocation and error correction mechanisms improve robustness and minimize audible distortion.
