## Adaptive Replication Granularity & Predictive Rollback

**Specification:** Implement a system capable of dynamically adjusting replication granularity *within* a single data set, coupled with a predictive rollback mechanism utilizing version vectors and change tracking.

**Core Concept:** Instead of replicating entire volumes or fixed-size pages, the system replicates data at a per-object level, determined by access patterns and predicted failure modes.  A ‘heat map’ is maintained tracking object access frequency and ‘mutation rate’ (frequency of changes).  Frequently accessed/mutated objects are replicated with lower latency, while rarely touched objects can be replicated less frequently or even omitted from immediate replication.  

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer:** Monitors read/write requests, constructing a ‘heat map’ of object access.  Employs time-decay to prioritize recent activity.
*   **Mutation Rate Estimator:** Tracks the rate of change for each object.  High mutation rates indicate a higher probability of data corruption.
*   **Dynamic Granularity Manager:**  Adjusts replication frequency and method (synchronous/asynchronous) based on heat map and mutation rate.  Objects with high activity *and* high mutation rates are replicated synchronously with low latency.  Rarely accessed objects may be replicated asynchronously with a larger lag, or omitted initially.
*   **Version Vector & Change Tracking System:** Maintains version vectors for each object.  Each write operation increments the version vector. This allows for accurate conflict detection and resolution. Stores 'delta' changes rather than full object copies.
*   **Predictive Rollback Buffer:** Based on change tracking, predicts potential corruption scenarios. Maintains a small buffer of recent changes, allowing for near-instantaneous rollback to a clean state if corruption is detected.  Rollback is prioritized based on the ‘cost’ of the rollback (amount of data to restore).
*   **Corruption Detection & Rollback Engine:** Monitors data integrity. If corruption is detected, leverages the predictive rollback buffer to restore data to a known good state.  Utilizes version vectors for conflict resolution during rollback.

**Pseudocode (Rollback Process):**

```
function rollbackObject(objectID, detectedCorruption):
  // 1. Check if object is in Predictive Rollback Buffer
  if objectID in rollbackBuffer:
    // 2. Restore from buffer
    restoreObject(objectID, rollbackBuffer[objectID])
    // 3. Remove from buffer (optional – keep for further recovery)
    removeObjectFromBuffer(objectID)
    return success

  // 4. If not in buffer, use version vectors to resolve conflict
  lastKnownGoodVersion = fetchLastKnownGoodVersion(objectID)
  currentVersion = fetchCurrentVersion(objectID)

  if currentVersion > lastKnownGoodVersion:
    // 5. Conflict detected - restore from last known good version, applying delta changes.
    restoreObject(objectID, lastKnownGoodVersion)
    applyDeltaChanges(objectID, lastKnownGoodVersion, currentVersion) //apply changes made since the last good version
    return success
  else:
    // 6. No conflict - potentially a transient error, retry read/write
    retryOperation()
    return failure

```

**Implementation Details:**

*   The system can be implemented as a layer on top of existing storage systems.
*   Configuration parameters include buffer size, time-decay factor for access patterns, and threshold for mutation rate.
*   Performance optimization is crucial.  Efficient data structures and algorithms are required for maintaining access patterns, version vectors, and rollback buffer.
*   The system can be integrated with existing monitoring and alerting tools.

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple replication strategies and introduces *adaptive* replication based on real-time data access patterns and predictive failure analysis, coupled with a targeted rollback mechanism for faster recovery.
