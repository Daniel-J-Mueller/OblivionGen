## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Consistency

**Concept:** Extend the peer replication framework to dynamically shard data *across* hosts based on predicted access patterns, while simultaneously relaxing consistency requirements *per shard* based on those same predictions. This creates a tiered consistency model – critical data remains strongly consistent, while less frequently accessed data tolerates eventual consistency for increased performance and scalability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):**

*   **Input:** Data access logs from all hosts (read/write requests with associated timestamps, data keys).
*   **Process:**  Employ a time-series forecasting algorithm (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future access frequencies for each data key/range.
*   **Output:**  A dynamic 'access score' assigned to each data key/range, indicating predicted access frequency.  Scores categorize data into tiers:
    *   Tier 1 (High): Critical data, frequently accessed.
    *   Tier 2 (Medium): Moderately accessed.
    *   Tier 3 (Low): Infrequently accessed.

**2. Dynamic Sharding Manager (DSM):**

*   **Input:** Access scores from the APA, current shard assignments, host load metrics.
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on access scores, migrate data between shards and hosts. High-access data is replicated across multiple hosts for low latency reads. Low-access data is consolidated onto fewer hosts.
    *   Algorithm:  A cost function balances read latency, write throughput, and storage costs.
    *   Consider host load - avoid overloading a single host with high-access data.
*   **Output:**  Shard assignments, replication factors per shard, migration schedules.

**3. Tiered Consistency Protocol (TCP):**

*   **Input:**  Shard assignments, data version numbers, acknowledgment status.
*   **Process:**  Apply different consistency levels based on the tier assigned to the shard:
    *   Tier 1 (Strong Consistency):  Use a two-phase commit protocol for writes.  Require acknowledgments from a majority of replicas before confirming the write.
    *   Tier 2 (Read-Your-Writes Consistency):  Writes are acknowledged after being applied to a single replica, but subsequent reads are guaranteed to see those writes.
    *   Tier 3 (Eventual Consistency):  Writes are acknowledged immediately, but there is no guarantee of immediate visibility to other hosts. Conflict resolution via vector clocks.
*   **Output:**  Acknowledged writes, data consistency guarantees.

**Pseudocode (DSM – Simplified):**

```
function migrateData(dataKey, currentHost, newHost)
  // Check if dataKey exists on currentHost
  if (dataKey exists on currentHost)
    // Copy data to newHost
    copyData(currentHost, newHost, dataKey)
    // Update shard assignment metadata
    updateShardAssignment(dataKey, newHost)
    // Remove data from currentHost (optional - consider caching)
    removeData(currentHost, dataKey)
  end if
end function

function recalculateSharding()
  for each dataKey in allDataKeys
    accessScore = getAccessScore(dataKey)
    if (accessScore > HIGH_THRESHOLD)
      // Replicate dataKey to multiple hosts
      replicateData(dataKey, HIGH_REPLICATION_FACTOR)
    else if (accessScore > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD)
      // Replicate dataKey to fewer hosts
      replicateData(dataKey, MEDIUM_REPLICATION_FACTOR)
    else
      // Consolidate dataKey on a single host
      consolidateData(dataKey)
    end if
  end for
end function
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement robust conflict resolution mechanisms for shards using eventual consistency.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Monitor shard distribution, replication latency, and conflict rates.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Design the system to tolerate host failures without data loss or service interruption.
*   **Data Locality:** Optimize data placement to minimize network latency for frequently accessed data.
