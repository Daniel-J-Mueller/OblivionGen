**Dynamic Phonetic Weighting for TTS Corpus Prioritization**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A phonetic weighting module integrated into the existing text segment prioritization system.
*   **Phonetic Analysis:**  Real-time analysis of incoming text data to identify phonetic units (phonemes, allophones) and assign dynamic weights based on rarity, ambiguity, and acoustic similarity to existing corpus phonemes.
*   **Rarity Calculation:** Weight increase proportional to the inverse frequency of the phonetic unit in a large, general language corpus (e.g., Common Voice, LibriSpeech).  Rare phonemes receive higher priority.
*   **Ambiguity Detection:** Utilize a probabilistic model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model) to identify phonetic units with multiple possible pronunciations.  Higher ambiguity equates to higher weight.
*   **Acoustic Similarity Metric:** Implement a distance metric (e.g., Mel-Cepstral Distortion) to compare the acoustic characteristics of incoming phonetic units to those already represented in the TTS corpus.  Lower similarity equates to higher weight.
*   **Combined Weighting:**  A weighted sum of rarity, ambiguity, and acoustic similarity scores to generate an overall priority score for each text segment. Formula: `Priority = (RarityWeight * RarityScore) + (AmbiguityWeight * AmbiguityScore) + (SimilarityWeight * (1 - SimilarityScore))` (Weights are tunable parameters).
*   **Integration with Web Interface:**  Display the priority score alongside each text segment in the proofreader interface.  Allow proofreaders to filter or sort segments based on priority.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The system continuously learns from proofreader feedback. Segments flagged as difficult or requiring significant correction receive increased weight in future prioritization.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_segment_priority(text_segment):
  rarity_score = calculate_rarity(text_segment)
  ambiguity_score = calculate_ambiguity(text_segment)
  similarity_score = calculate_corpus_similarity(text_segment)

  rarity_weight = 0.4  // Tunable parameter
  ambiguity_weight = 0.3 // Tunable parameter
  similarity_weight = 0.3 // Tunable parameter

  priority = (rarity_weight * rarity_score) + (ambiguity_weight * ambiguity_score) + (similarity_weight * (1 - similarity_score))

  return priority

function calculate_rarity(text_segment):
  // Analyze text segment for unique phonetic units.
  // Query external corpus for frequency of those units.
  // Return inverse frequency as a rarity score.

function calculate_ambiguity(text_segment):
  // Utilize probabilistic model (HMM) to calculate likelihood
  // of multiple pronunciations for each phonetic unit.
  // Return a score reflecting the degree of ambiguity.

function calculate_corpus_similarity(text_segment):
  // Analyze existing TTS corpus for phonetic units.
  // Calculate acoustic distance between incoming and corpus units.
  // Return a similarity score (0-1).
