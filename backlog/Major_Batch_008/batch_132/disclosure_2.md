## Dynamic Mood-Based Color Grading with Biofeedback Integration

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Biofeedback Sensor (heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (GSR), EEG - optional)
    *   Real-time video processing unit (GPU accelerated)
    *   Display unit.
*   **Software:**
    *   Real-time video capture module.
    *   Biofeedback data acquisition module.
    *   AI-powered emotion/mood detection module (trained on biofeedback data & facial expression analysis).
    *   Color grading engine (LUT-based or direct color manipulation).
    *   Color Palette Recommendation Engine (expands upon existing patent's neural network – see below).
    *   User interface for calibration and control.

**Innovation Description:**

This system aims to dynamically adjust the color grading of video content *in real-time* based on the viewer's emotional state, detected through biofeedback. The core idea is to create a more immersive and emotionally resonant viewing experience by subtly shifting the color palette to align with or contrast the viewer’s feelings.

**Color Palette Recommendation Engine – Expansion & Novelty:**

This is where the existing patent’s technology is significantly expanded. The core engine remains a neural network, but its inputs and outputs are modified:

*   **Inputs:**
    *   Video Segment Data (as per existing patent: object, semantic characteristic, action).
    *   *Real-Time Biofeedback Data:* HRV, GSR, EEG (processed into emotional state estimations – e.g., valence, arousal, dominance).
    *   *User History:* Viewing preferences, past emotional responses to similar content, preferred color palettes.
*   **Outputs:**
    *   Not just a single color palette, but *a range of palettes*, each weighted by its appropriateness given the input data.  These palettes are defined as sets of LUT parameters or direct color manipulation instructions.
    *   *Palette Transition Parameters:*  Speed and style of transitions between palettes (e.g., smooth fades, abrupt shifts).
    *   *Palette Intensity:*  A scaling factor that controls the strength of the color grading effect.

**Pseudocode – Core Processing Loop:**

```
LOOP:
    1. Capture Video Frame
    2. Acquire Biofeedback Data
    3. Extract Video Segment Data (object, semantic, action)
    4. Process Biofeedback Data -> Estimate Emotional State (Valence, Arousal, Dominance)
    5. Input: Video Segment Data, Emotional State, User History -> Neural Network
    6. Output:  Palette Candidates (weighted), Transition Parameters, Intensity
    7. Select Best Palette Candidate (based on weighting)
    8. Apply Color Grading with selected Palette, Transition Parameters, and Intensity
    9. Display Framed
    10. Repeat
```

**Novelty & Key Features:**

*   **Biofeedback Integration:** This is the primary innovation. Existing systems primarily rely on content analysis. This system incorporates the *viewer's* emotional state as a key input.
*   **Dynamic Palette Generation:** Unlike static color grading, the palettes are constantly adjusted in real-time.
*   **Personalization:** The system learns user preferences and adapts the color grading accordingly.
*   **Adaptive Intensity:** The strength of the color grading effect can be adjusted to avoid overwhelming the viewer.
*   **Potential Applications:** Immersive entertainment, therapeutic applications (e.g., mood regulation), enhanced video conferencing.
*   **Expanding the Color Palette Graph:** The color palette graph within the existing patent's neural network is expanded to include emotional states.  Each emotion is associated with a range of color palettes.
*   **Confidence Score Integration:** Similar to claim 12, the confidence score for a recommended palette is weighted against the confidence score of the emotional state determination.  Low confidence scores trigger fallback palettes or prevent grading adjustments.
