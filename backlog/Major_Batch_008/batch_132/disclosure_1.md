## Adaptive Resource Prediction & Pre-Allocation

**Concept:** Proactively anticipate resource needs *before* job execution begins, leveraging historical data and predictive modeling to pre-allocate resources and optimize cluster utilization. This goes beyond simply reacting to missing nodes â€“ it aims to prevent the problem entirely.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Logs execution characteristics for all jobs: CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network bandwidth, execution time, dependencies, user/priority.
    *   Tracks cluster-wide resource availability in real-time.
    *   Stores historical data in a time-series database.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
    *   Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series forecasting, regression, neural networks) to predict resource requirements for new jobs. Models trained separately for different job types/workflows.
    *   Input features: Job characteristics (size of input data, estimated runtime, dependency graph), user priority, historical performance of similar jobs, current cluster load.
    *   Output: Estimated resource requirements (CPU cores, memory, disk space, network bandwidth) with confidence intervals.
*   **Resource Pre-Allocation Manager:**
    *   Receives resource predictions from the modeling engine.
    *   Attempts to reserve resources *before* job submission.
    *   Considers resource availability, user priority, and confidence intervals.
    *   If sufficient resources are available, a 'soft reservation' is created.
    *   If resources are scarce, a queueing mechanism prioritizes jobs based on predicted resource needs and user priority.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Loop:**
    *   During job execution, monitors actual resource usage.
    *   Compares actual usage to predicted usage.
    *   Feeds this data back into the predictive modeling engine to refine future predictions.
    *   Dynamically adjusts resource allocation (e.g., scaling up/down VM instances) based on real-time needs.

**Pseudocode (Resource Pre-Allocation Manager):**

```
function preAllocateResources(job):
  predictedResources = predictiveModel.predict(job)
  availableResources = clusterManager.getAvailableResources()

  if availableResources >= predictedResources:
    clusterManager.reserveResources(job, predictedResources)
    return true // Allocation successful
  else:
    // Add job to priority queue
    priorityQueue.add(job)
    return false // Allocation failed - queued

function checkQueue():
  for each job in priorityQueue:
    availableResources = clusterManager.getAvailableResources()
    predictedResources = predictiveModel.predict(job)
    if availableResources >= predictedResources:
      clusterManager.reserveResources(job, predictedResources)
      priorityQueue.remove(job)
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive scaling to *proactive* resource provisioning.  The dynamic adjustment loop constantly refines predictions, minimizing waste and maximizing cluster utilization. Focuses on anticipating needs, not just responding to shortages.  Uses ML to predict rather than just monitor.
