## Adaptive Chat Correction via Predictive User Modeling

**Concept:** Expand beyond identifying correction *pairs* to proactively *predict* likely user errors and suggest corrections *before* they are fully typed, leveraging a dynamic user model. This isn’t about fixing mistakes, it's about anticipating them.

**Specifications:**

**I. User Model Component:**

*   **Data Points:**
    *   Typing speed (words per minute, characters per second)
    *   Commonly misspelled words (weighted by frequency)
    *   Frequent grammatical errors (e.g., subject-verb agreement, article usage)
    *   Vocabulary usage (frequency of different word classes)
    *   Contextual phrase patterns (common multi-word sequences)
    *   Preferred phrasing/slang (identified via pattern recognition)
    *   Device type (mobile, desktop, voice) - impacts error profiles
*   **Model Architecture:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – capable of learning sequential dependencies in user input. This allows the model to capture context beyond the immediately preceding characters.
*   **Dynamic Updating:** The user model is continuously updated with each new input. A weighted average is used to incorporate new data while preserving established patterns. (e.g., 70% previous model, 30% new input).

**II. Predictive Correction Engine:**

*   **Input Processing:** As the user types, the input stream is fed into the predictive correction engine.
*   **Error Probability Calculation:** Based on the current input and the user model, the engine calculates the probability of various potential errors. This is achieved by scoring potential completions.
*   **Completion Ranking:** Possible completions are ranked based on error probability (lower probability = higher rank) and contextual relevance.
*   **Suggestion Interface:**
    *   **Inline Suggestions:** The top 3-5 ranked completions are displayed as subtle, inline suggestions (greyed-out text) as the user types.
    *   **Adaptive Highlighting:** Highlight the area of the current input where a correction is most likely.
    *   **Confidence Threshold:** Only display suggestions when the confidence level (based on error probability) exceeds a predetermined threshold. This prevents distracting the user with irrelevant suggestions.
*   **Voice Input Adaptation:** For voice inputs, the engine predicts likely misrecognitions based on acoustic similarity and contextual probability.

**III. System Architecture:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop
while (user is typing or speaking) {
    input = get_user_input();
    user_model = update_user_model(user_model, input);
    predictions = predict_errors(input, user_model);
    suggestions = rank_suggestions(predictions);
    display_suggestions(suggestions);

    if (user accepts suggestion) {
        update_user_model(user_model, accepted_suggestion); //Reinforce learning
    }
}

// Functions
function update_user_model(current_model, new_input) {
    // Weighted average update of user model based on new input
    // RNN-LSTM architecture for sequential data processing
}

function predict_errors(input, user_model) {
    // Calculate error probability for each character in input
    // Consider typing speed, common misspellings, grammatical errors, vocabulary
}

function rank_suggestions(predictions) {
    // Sort predictions by error probability (lower probability = higher rank)
    // Consider contextual relevance and user preferences
}

function display_suggestions(suggestions) {
    // Display top suggestions inline or in a dropdown menu
    // Highlight area of input where correction is likely
}
```

**IV. Data Collection & Privacy:**

*   **Anonymized Data:** Collect anonymized user input data to improve the overall model.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Provide users with options to disable data collection or reset their user model.
*   **Local Processing:** Consider the option of running the user model locally on the user's device to enhance privacy.
