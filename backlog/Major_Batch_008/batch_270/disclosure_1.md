**Modular Variable Friction Surface Engagement**

**Concept:** Expand the auxiliary arm engagement beyond simple gripping or surface contact. Introduce dynamically adjustable friction surfaces on the auxiliary arms to *actively control* the item’s movement and orientation *during* lifting, rather than simply stabilizing it.

**Specs:**

*   **Auxiliary Arm Material:** Replace standard rigid links with a segmented arm composed of small, individually controlled ‘scales’ or micro-actuators. Material: Shape memory alloy or electroactive polymer composite.
*   **Surface Texture Control:** Each ‘scale’ can independently adjust its protrusion/retraction, changing the effective friction coefficient of the contact surface. Control range: 0.1 – 1.5 (relative to polished steel).
*   **Sensor Integration:** Force sensors embedded within each ‘scale’ to detect contact force and slippage.
*   **Control System:** A hierarchical control system:
    *   **High-Level:** User-defined object handling parameters (e.g., ‘gentle lift’, ‘secure hold’, ‘rotate 90 degrees’).
    *   **Mid-Level:** Algorithm that translates high-level parameters into desired friction profiles for each arm.
    *   **Low-Level:** PID controllers for each ‘scale’ to maintain the desired protrusion/retraction, adapting to changes in load and surface characteristics.
*   **Power:** Wireless power transfer to each auxiliary arm assembly to reduce cabling complexity.
*   **Actuation:** Micro-piezoelectric actuators integrated into each ‘scale’ for rapid and precise control.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
FOR EACH AuxiliaryArm:
    FOR EACH Scale:
        Read ForceSensorValue
        IF SlippageDetected:
            IncreaseScaleProtrusion(small_increment)
        ELSE IF ExcessiveForce:
            DecreaseScaleProtrusion(small_increment)
        ENDIF
        AdjustActuator(PID_output) // Maintain desired protrusion
    ENDFOR
ENDFOR
```

**Functionality Example – Rotating a Book:**

1.  EOAT positions suction cup on top of book.
2.  Auxiliary arms deploy and engage the sides of the book.
3.  Control system initiates ‘rotate 90 degrees’ command.
4.  Auxiliary arms *asymmetrically* increase friction on opposite sides of the book, inducing controlled rotation.
5.  Suction cup maintains vertical stability during rotation.
6.  Once rotated, friction is normalized for transport.
