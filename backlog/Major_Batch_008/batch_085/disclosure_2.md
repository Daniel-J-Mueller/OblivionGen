## Adaptive FST Pruning with User Behavioral Prediction

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the complexity of Finite State Transducers (FSTs) used in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based on real-time prediction of user behavior and linguistic context.

**Core Concept:** The provided patent focuses on compressing FSTs for size reduction. This builds on that by *actively* pruning and reconstructing portions of the FST *during* operation, guided by a predictive model of what the user is likely to say next.  This is a move away from static compression towards dynamic adaptation.

**Components:**

1.  **User Behavior Prediction Module:**
    *   Input:  User history (previous utterances, app usage, location data, time of day, calendar events), current context (active application, sensor data).
    *   Process:  A recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer model trained to predict the probability distribution of the *next likely utterance* or *next likely semantic intent*.  This prediction isn’t about exact words, but about broad categories – e.g., "making a phone call," "playing music," "setting a timer," "asking about the weather," “navigating home.”
    *   Output: A probability distribution over semantic intents and associated linguistic features (e.g., expected entities – place names, song titles, contact names).

2.  **Dynamic FST Pruner/Reconstructor:**
    *   Input:  Compressed FST, output of User Behavior Prediction Module.
    *   Process:
        *   **Pruning:**  Based on the predicted probability distribution, the system identifies portions of the FST that are unlikely to be traversed given the predicted intent. These portions are temporarily removed from the active FST representation. For example, if the prediction is “setting a timer”, branches relating to music playback or phone calls would be pruned.  Pruning granularity can be at the state or arc level.  Arc weights associated with pruned arcs are temporarily stored for rapid reconstruction.
        *   **Reconstruction:** When a user utterance *does* require a pruned portion of the FST, it is rapidly reconstructed from the stored arc weights and FST structure. A priority queue manages reconstruction requests based on real-time latency demands.
        *   **Adaptive Granularity:** The system dynamically adjusts the granularity of pruning/reconstruction based on available computational resources and latency constraints.  Coarser pruning reduces memory usage but may increase latency during reconstruction.

3.  **Hybrid FST Representation:**
    *   The core FST is stored in a compressed format as in the original patent.
    *   A smaller, “active” FST is maintained in memory, representing the currently pruned and reconstructed portion.  This active FST is dynamically updated during speech recognition.
    *   A “shadow” FST acts as a cache for frequently reconstructed portions, reducing reconstruction latency.

**Pseudocode (Pruning Step):**

```pseudocode
function prune_fst(compressed_fst, prediction_distribution):
  active_fst = decompress(compressed_fst) // initial active FST

  for each state in active_fst:
    for each outgoing arc from state:
      #Calculate 'relevance score' based on arc label and prediction distribution
      relevance_score = calculate_relevance(arc.label, prediction_distribution)

      if relevance_score < threshold:
        # Store arc data for reconstruction
        store_arc(arc.data)
        # Remove arc from active_fst
        remove_arc(arc)

  return active_fst
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Standard processor with sufficient RAM to store compressed FST and active FST.  Potential for hardware acceleration of FST traversal and reconstruction using GPUs or specialized ASICs.
*   **Software:**  C++ or Python implementation.  Integration with existing ASR engines (e.g., Kaldi, ESPnet). Machine learning framework for User Behavior Prediction (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   **Data Requirements:** Large corpus of user speech and contextual data for training the User Behavior Prediction Module.
*   **Potential Benefits:** Reduced memory footprint, lower latency, improved ASR accuracy by focusing computational resources on likely utterances.  Personalized ASR experience tailored to user behavior.
