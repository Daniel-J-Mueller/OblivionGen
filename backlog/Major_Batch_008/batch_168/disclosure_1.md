## Adaptive Cipher Suite Negotiation & Dynamic Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the existing network traffic interception detection to *proactively* influence cipher suite negotiation during the TLS handshake, simultaneously building a dynamic trust score for the client based on its negotiation behavior and subsequent data transmission patterns. This aims to mitigate MITM attacks *before* they fully establish, and provide more nuanced risk assessment.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Cipher Suite Preference List Augmentation:**

*   **Data Structure:**  Maintain a global, dynamically updated "Cipher Suite Preference List" (CSPL).  This list ranks cipher suites not only by security strength (as currently done), but also by a “rarity score”.  The rarity score is calculated based on observed usage across *all* clients connecting through the service provider’s network.  Commonly used suites get lower rarity scores.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Implement an algorithm that slightly biases the server’s offered cipher suite list towards suites with higher rarity scores, *provided* the client supports them. This pushes clients towards less-targeted suites.
*   **Configuration:** Allow administrators to set a “Bias Factor” controlling the strength of this preference.  Higher values push more aggressively towards rare suites.
*   **Logging:**  Log all cipher suite negotiation details (client-proposed, server-selected) with timestamps and client identifiers.

**2.  Dynamic Trust Scoring System:**

*   **Initialization:**  Assign each new client a base trust score (e.g., 50/100).
*   **Negotiation Phase Scoring:**
    *   **Rare Suite Selection:**  If a client *selects* a rare suite offered by the server, *increase* its trust score.  The amount of the increase is proportional to the rarity score.
    *   **Common Suite Selection:** If a client selects a common suite, *decrease* its trust score.
    *   **Negotiation Duration:**  Unusually long negotiation times (indicating potential manipulation) *decrease* the trust score.
    *   **Protocol Downgrade Attempts:**  Any attempt to negotiate older, less secure protocols (e.g., SSLv3) *significantly decreases* the trust score.
*   **Post-Handshake Phase Scoring:**
    *   **Data Transmission Entropy:** Monitor the entropy of the client's data streams.  Low entropy (e.g., repeating patterns) may indicate data exfiltration or manipulation.  Decrease trust score if entropy is consistently low.
    *   **DNS Request Consistency:**  Compare DNS requests made by the client to a known-good baseline.  Inconsistencies (e.g., requests to suspicious domains) decrease trust score.
    *   **Deviation from Expected Behavior:** Use machine learning to establish a baseline of “normal” behavior for each client (based on its traffic patterns, accessed resources, etc.).  Significant deviations from this baseline decrease trust score.
*   **Scoring Range:** Trust scores range from 0-100.

**3.  Risk Mitigation Actions:**

*   **Thresholds:** Define trust score thresholds for different actions:
    *   **High Trust (80-100):**  No action.
    *   **Medium Trust (50-79):**  Increased logging, potential rate limiting.
    *   **Low Trust (0-49):**  Connection termination, blocklist addition.
*   **Adaptive Actions:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts mitigation actions based on the client's trust score and the severity of the detected anomalies.
*   **Transparency:**  Log all risk mitigation actions and their associated reasons.

**Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(client) {
  trustScore = 50; // Base score

  // Negotiation Phase
  if (client.selectedRareSuite) {
    trustScore += client.rareSuiteRarityScore * 0.2;
  } else {
    trustScore -= 5;
  }
  if (client.negotiationDuration > threshold) {
    trustScore -= 10;
  }
  if (client.attemptedDowngrade) {
    trustScore -= 20;
  }

  // Post-Handshake Phase
  trustScore += client.dataEntropy * 0.1;
  if (client.dnsInconsistencies > threshold) {
    trustScore -= 10;
  }
  trustScore += client.behaviorDeviationScore * 0.1;

  // Clamp score to 0-100
  trustScore = max(0, min(100, trustScore));

  return trustScore;
}
```

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   Requires modification of the existing TLS termination/proxy infrastructure.
*   Machine learning models for behavioral analysis will require training and ongoing maintenance.
*   Careful tuning of thresholds and weighting factors is crucial to minimize false positives and false negatives.
*   Must be integrated with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
