## Dynamic Contextual Highlighting & Semantic Bookmarking

**Core Concept:** Extend the bookmarking system to not just pinpoint words, but *understand* the surrounding context and dynamically highlight related concepts across the entire document â€“ creating a navigable web of knowledge centered around the bookmark.

**Specifications:**

**1. Semantic Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Electronic document text.
*   **Process:** Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (e.g., Named Entity Recognition, Relationship Extraction, Topic Modeling) to identify key entities, relationships, and topics within the document.  Create a semantic graph representing the document's knowledge.
*   **Output:** Semantic graph data structure.

**2. Bookmark Extension:**

*   Bookmarks no longer just store a word location. They store:
    *   Bookmarked Word/Phrase
    *   Semantic ID: A unique identifier representing the core concept the bookmark relates to in the semantic graph.
    *   Relationship Weights: Weights indicating the strength of relationships between the Semantic ID and other entities/concepts in the graph.

**3. Dynamic Highlighting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Bookmark with Semantic ID, Relationship Weights, Document Text, Semantic Graph.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Traverse the Semantic Graph starting from the Bookmark's Semantic ID.
    2.  Identify related entities/concepts based on Relationship Weights (threshold adjustable by user).
    3.  Highlight all occurrences of these related entities/concepts within the document.  Highlight color/intensity proportional to Relationship Weight.
    4.  Highlighting persists across page turns and reflows, dynamically adjusting to new layouts.
*   **Output:** Dynamically highlighted document display.

**4. Navigation Interface:**

*   **"Knowledge Web" View:** A visual representation of the semantic graph, centered around the selected bookmark.  Users can explore related concepts and navigate to their occurrences in the document.
*   **"Related Concepts" Panel:** A list of related concepts, sorted by Relationship Weight.  Clicking a concept highlights all its occurrences in the document.
*   **Bookmark Grouping:** Automatically group bookmarks based on shared Semantic IDs, allowing users to quickly access all bookmarks related to a specific concept.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Highlighting Engine):**

```
function HighlightRelatedConcepts(bookmark, document, semanticGraph):
  semanticID = bookmark.semanticID
  relatedConcepts = semanticGraph.GetRelatedConcepts(semanticID, threshold)

  for each concept in relatedConcepts:
    occurrences = document.FindAllOccurrences(concept)
    for each occurrence in occurrences:
      occurrence.Highlight(color = concept.color, intensity = concept.weight)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard e-reader hardware with sufficient processing power to handle NLP tasks (cloud processing an option for complex analyses).
*   Display capable of supporting dynamic highlighting and color variations.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Academic research: Explore relationships between concepts in scholarly articles.
*   Legal document review: Quickly identify relevant clauses and precedents.
*   Fiction reading: Uncover subtle themes and character connections.
*   Personal knowledge management: Build a navigable web of information from diverse sources.
