## Dynamic Structured Light with Per-Dot Color Modulation

**Core Concept:** Augment structured light depth sensing with per-dot color modulation, enabling simultaneous depth *and* color information capture. This expands applications beyond simple 3D reconstruction to include material property analysis and enhanced scene understanding.

**I. System Specifications:**

*   **Projector:** Modified structured light projector capable of independent color control for each projected dot. This will necessitate a high-resolution, digitally addressable light engine (potentially micro-LED array or similar). Resolution minimum: 640x480, ideally 1920x1080.  Color depth: 24-bit RGB per dot. Frame Rate: 60 Hz minimum.
*   **Camera:** Standard RGB camera (color sensor) with global shutter. Resolution must match or exceed the projector's resolution. Synchronization with the projector is critical (hardware trigger preferred).
*   **Calibration Target:** A physical calibration target with known color patches corresponding to the projector's per-dot color modulation capabilities.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded system or PC for real-time processing.  GPU acceleration essential.
*   **Software Stack:**
    *   Calibration Module:  Handles projector/camera calibration, including intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, as well as per-dot color mapping.
    *   Projection Control Module:  Manages the per-dot color modulation and projection sequence.
    *   Image Acquisition Module:  Captures images from the camera.
    *   Depth & Color Processing Module:  Calculates depth data and extracts color information.
    *   Data Output Module:  Provides depth maps and color data in standard formats (e.g., point clouds, meshes).

**II. Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Calibration:** The system is calibrated using the calibration target to establish the relationship between projected dot positions, colors, and corresponding points in the camera image.  This calibration will involve determining the per-dot color-to-depth relationship.
2.  **Projection:** The projector projects a structured light pattern onto the scene, *with each dot assigned a unique color*. The color assigned to each dot is a function of its projected position and the known geometry of the calibration setup.
3.  **Capture:** The camera captures an image of the scene, including the illuminated structured light pattern.
4.  **Processing:** The processing unit analyzes the captured image and calculates the depth data based on the displacement of the projected dots from their expected positions. Simultaneously, the color of each detected dot is extracted.
5.  **Data Output:** The system outputs a depth map and a corresponding color map, providing both 3D geometry and color information for each point in the scene.

**III. Algorithm Sketch (Depth & Color Extraction):**

```pseudocode
//For each pixel in the image:
if(pixel_color != background_color):  //Isolating structured light pixels
    dot_position = find_corresponding_dot_position(pixel_color) //Use color to ID projected position
    if(dot_position != null):
        image_x, image_y = pixel_coordinates
        projected_x, projected_y = dot_position

        depth = calculate_depth(image_x, image_y, projected_x, projected_y)  //Standard stereo vision/triangulation using dot displacement
        color = pixel_color

        output_depth_map[image_x][image_y] = depth
        output_color_map[image_x][image_y] = color
```

**IV. Potential Applications:**

*   **Material Property Analysis:** By projecting specific color patterns and analyzing the reflected light, the system could determine material properties such as reflectivity, texture, and surface normals.
*   **Advanced Robotics:** Enhanced scene understanding for more robust grasping, manipulation, and navigation.
*   **AR/VR:** Creation of more realistic and immersive AR/VR experiences with accurate 3D reconstruction and color rendering.
*   **Biometrics:** High-resolution 3D scans of faces and other body parts for biometric identification.
