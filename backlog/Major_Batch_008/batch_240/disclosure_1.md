**Dynamic Wavelength Allocation Based on Predictive Traffic Modeling**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Predictive Traffic Engine (PTE) – A machine learning model trained on historical network traffic data (bandwidth usage, IP prefixes, time of day, day of week, special events – e.g., sporting events, software releases).
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time network telemetry: Bandwidth utilization per port, per wavelength, per optical node.
    *   Historical traffic logs: Detailed records of network traffic patterns.
    *   External event calendars: Scheduled events that may impact network traffic (e.g., major software updates, large-scale conferences).
*   **PTE Functionality:**
    *   Predictive Modeling: Forecast future bandwidth requirements for specific IP prefixes and network segments. Utilizes time series analysis, regression models, and potentially neural networks.
    *   Proactive Wavelength Allocation: Based on predicted traffic, the PTE identifies potential bottlenecks and proactively allocates wavelengths *before* congestion occurs.
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: Continuously monitors actual traffic against predictions. Adjusts wavelength allocations in real-time to optimize bandwidth utilization and minimize latency.
*   **Control Plane Integration:**
    *   Centralized Controller: Interacts with both the IP network layer and the optical network layer. Receives predictions from the PTE and translates them into commands for provisioning wavelengths.
    *   Optical Network Management System (ONMS): Controls the optical network, enabling wavelength assignment, routing, and monitoring.
    *   IP Network Management System (IPNMS): Programs network devices with static routes and IP addresses.
*   **Wavelength Allocation Algorithm:**
    1.  PTE generates traffic prediction for a specific IP prefix and network segment.
    2.  Controller compares predicted traffic with current bandwidth utilization.
    3.  If predicted traffic exceeds available bandwidth, the controller requests a new wavelength from the ONMS.
    4.  ONMS provisions the wavelength and establishes an express path through the optical network.
    5.  Controller programs the network device with a static route to direct traffic for the IP prefix to the newly provisioned wavelength.
    6.  Continuously monitor traffic on the express path. If traffic falls below a threshold, the wavelength is released, and the static route is removed.
*   **Express Path Optimization:** The system will aim to dynamically select the *shortest* possible express path through the optical network based on current network conditions and optical node availability, further reducing latency.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Get Traffic Predictions from PTE
  predictions = PTE.get_predictions();

  // Iterate through each prediction
  for (prediction in predictions) {
    ip_prefix = prediction.ip_prefix
    predicted_bandwidth = prediction.bandwidth
    network_segment = prediction.segment

    // Get Current Bandwidth Utilization
    current_bandwidth = get_current_bandwidth(network_segment)

    // Check if Proactive Allocation is Needed
    if (predicted_bandwidth > current_bandwidth) {
      // Request New Wavelength from ONMS
      wavelength = ONMS.allocate_wavelength(network_segment)

      // Program Network Device with Static Route
      IPNMS.program_static_route(ip_prefix, wavelength)

      // Log Event
      log("Proactively allocated wavelength for " + ip_prefix)
    }
  }
  // Regularly monitor and deallocate wavelengths if traffic drops below threshold
  deallocate_unused_wavelengths()
}
