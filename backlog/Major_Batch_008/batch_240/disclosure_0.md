## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Proximity-Based Security

**Concept:** Expand the accelerometer-based security trigger beyond simply locking/unlocking the device. Introduce a tiered system of haptic feedback, dynamically adjusting in intensity based on the device’s proximity to a designated ‘safe zone’ (defined by authorized user location/movement patterns). This creates a more intuitive and nuanced security experience, offering subtle warnings *before* full lock-down, and personalized comfort levels.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   High-precision accelerometer/gyroscope (existing in the provided patent).
    *   Ultra-wideband (UWB) or Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) beacon/tag for authorized user proximity detection. The user would carry a small beacon, or the system would leverage the user's paired phone as a beacon.
    *   Advanced haptic engine capable of varied intensity and patterns.
    *   Secure enclave for storing authorized user profile data, secure keys, and motion profiles.

*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Safe Zone:**  Device is within a predefined proximity range of the authorized user. No haptic feedback. Standard operational state.
    *   **Proximity Warning (Tier 1):** Device moves *beyond* the immediate safe zone (e.g., 3 meters), but remains within a larger range (e.g., 10 meters). A gentle, pulsing haptic feedback is activated.  Intensity is customizable per user. This is a passive notification – the device remains unlocked.
    *   **Escalated Warning (Tier 2):** Device moves *further* beyond the safe zone (e.g., >10 meters). Haptic feedback becomes stronger and more persistent.  System may also display a non-intrusive visual alert on the screen. Device remains unlocked, but begins logging movement data.
    *   **Critical Alert/Lockdown (Tier 3):** Device exceeds a maximum distance or registers rapid/erratic movement inconsistent with authorized user patterns *and* remains outside the safe zone for a prolonged period.  Strongest haptic feedback. Automatic lock-down initiated. Location tracking activated.  Remote disabling/data wipe capabilities are triggered.

*   **Software/Algorithm Details:**
    *   **Motion Profile Learning:** The system learns the authorized user's typical movement patterns (gait, speed, acceleration) through initial setup and ongoing data collection.  This creates a baseline for anomaly detection.
    *   **Adaptive Thresholds:** Proximity and movement thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on the environment (e.g., crowded vs. open space) and user activity (e.g., walking vs. running).
    *   **Secure Authentication:**  The UWB/BLE signal is used to verify the proximity of the authorized user. Encryption and authentication protocols are implemented to prevent spoofing attacks.
    *   **Privacy Controls:** Users have granular control over data collection and sharing. Location tracking is opt-in and subject to user consent.

*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```pseudocode
// Initialization
define SAFE_ZONE_RADIUS = 3 meters
define WARNING_RADIUS = 10 meters
learn_user_motion_profile()

// Main Loop
while (device_is_on) {
    distance = calculate_distance_to_beacon()
    motion_anomaly = detect_motion_anomaly()

    if (distance <= SAFE_ZONE_RADIUS) {
        disable_haptic_feedback()
        unlock_device()
    } else if (distance <= WARNING_RADIUS) {
        enable_gentle_haptic_feedback()
        unlock_device()
    } else {
        if (motion_anomaly) {
            enable_strong_haptic_feedback()
            lock_device()
            activate_location_tracking()
        } else {
            enable_moderate_haptic_feedback()
            unlock_device()
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Potential Enhancements:**
    *   Integration with smart home systems for automated security responses.
    *   Biometric authentication (fingerprint, facial recognition) as a secondary security layer.
    *   AI-powered predictive security – anticipating potential threats based on location and user behavior.
