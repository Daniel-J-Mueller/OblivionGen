## Dynamic Spectrum Allocation via Predictive Interference Mapping

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Mesh network nodes equipped with software-defined radios (SDRs) capable of operating across a wide frequency band (e.g., 2.4GHz - 6GHz). Each node includes a dedicated processing unit (CPU/GPU) for real-time signal analysis and predictive modeling. High-precision timing synchronization (e.g., IEEE 802.1AS) across the network is essential.
*   **Software:** A distributed AI agent running on each mesh node. This agent comprises:
    *   **Interference Prediction Module:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical interference data (RF noise samples, channel usage) and contextual factors (time of day, location, user activity). The RNN predicts future interference levels across different frequency channels.
    *   **Spectrum Allocation Engine:** An optimization algorithm (e.g., a variation of the Hungarian algorithm or a Genetic Algorithm) that dynamically allocates frequency channels to each node based on the interference predictions, data rate requirements, and node proximity.
    *   **Adaptive Modulation and Coding (AMC) Controller:** Adjusts the modulation scheme and coding rate based on the allocated channel's signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to maximize throughput and reliability.
    *   **Federated Learning Framework:** Enables the AI agents on different nodes to collaboratively improve the interference prediction models without sharing raw data. Only model updates are exchanged.
*   **Data Collection:** Each node continuously monitors RF spectrum activity, logs interference levels, and tracks data transmission performance. This data is used to train and refine the interference prediction models.
*   **Network Topology Awareness:** Nodes maintain a localized view of the network topology, identifying neighboring nodes and their current channel assignments.
*   **Communication Protocol:** A lightweight signaling protocol for nodes to exchange channel availability information and negotiate channel assignments.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be scalable to support large mesh networks with hundreds or thousands of nodes.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initialization:** Each node starts by scanning the available frequency channels and collecting initial interference data.
2.  **Interference Prediction:** The AI agent on each node uses the trained RNN to predict future interference levels across all channels.
3.  **Channel Allocation:** The allocation engine selects the optimal channel for each node based on the interference predictions, data rate requirements, and network topology. The engine prioritizes channels with low predicted interference and high potential throughput.
4.  **Signaling:** Nodes exchange channel assignment information with their neighbors to avoid interference. Conflicts are resolved through negotiation.
5.  **Adaptive Modulation:** Nodes adapt their modulation and coding schemes based on the measured SINR on the allocated channel.
6.  **Learning and Adaptation:** Nodes continuously collect data and refine their interference prediction models using federated learning. This allows the system to adapt to changing interference conditions and optimize performance over time.

**Pseudocode (Interference Prediction Module):**

```
function predict_interference(historical_data, contextual_factors):
  # historical_data: RF noise samples, channel usage history
  # contextual_factors: time of day, location, user activity

  # Input data preprocessing: normalization, feature extraction

  # RNN model (LSTM or GRU)
  interference_prediction = RNN(preprocessed_data)

  # Output post-processing: scaling, smoothing

  return interference_prediction
```

**Innovation:**

This system diverges from existing power management techniques by proactively *avoiding* interference rather than simply compensating for it. By predicting future interference levels, the system can dynamically allocate frequency channels to minimize collisions and maximize throughput. Federated learning enables collaborative intelligence without compromising data privacy. This approach enhances network capacity, improves reliability, and extends battery life by reducing retransmissions.
