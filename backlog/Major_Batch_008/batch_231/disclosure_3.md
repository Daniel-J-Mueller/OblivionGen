**Variable Geometry Vortex Generators â€“ Distributed Aerodynamic Control**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement an array of micro-vortex generators (MVGs) *within* the flexible propeller blade sections described in the provided patent. These MVGs will not be static. Instead, each MVG will be individually actuated to dynamically adjust its angle of attack. This creates a distributed aerodynamic control surface *within* the blade itself, allowing for nuanced control over airflow and lift distribution.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Micro-Vortex Generators (MVGs):** Miniature airfoil structures (approx. 5-10mm chord length) fabricated from a shape-memory alloy or piezoelectric material. Each MVG is embedded within the flexible blade sections.
*   **Actuation System:** Each MVG is connected to a micro-actuator (piezoelectric, micro-servo, or shape-memory alloy wire) controlled by a local microcontroller.
*   **Sensor Array:** Integrate a network of micro-pressure sensors and strain gauges *within* the propeller blade sections to provide real-time airflow and structural load data.
*   **Local Microcontroller:** Each blade section hosts a microcontroller responsible for:
    *   Sensor data acquisition.
    *   MVG actuation control.
    *   Communication with the central flight controller.
*   **Flexible Blade Material:** Continue utilizing the flexible material described in the patent, but incorporate conductive traces for power and communication.

**III. Control Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Central Flight Controller
loop:
    receive desired thrust/torque/maneuver commands
    calculate optimal blade section load distribution
    transmit target MVG angles to each blade section microcontroller

// Blade Section Microcontroller
loop:
    receive target MVG angles from flight controller
    read sensor data (pressure, strain)
    apply feedback control to adjust MVG angles
    transmit sensor data back to flight controller
```

**IV. Operational Modes:**

*   **Lift Enhancement:** Deploy MVGs to energize the boundary layer, delaying stall and increasing lift at low speeds.
*   **Drag Reduction:** Optimize MVG deployment to minimize induced drag during cruise.
*   **Noise Reduction:** Stagger MVG activation and adjust angles to disrupt coherent vortex structures and reduce aerodynamic noise.
*   **Maneuver Enhancement:** Dynamically adjust MVG angles to create asymmetric lift distribution, enabling rapid and precise maneuvers.
*   **Vibration Dampening:** Utilize MVGs in a closed-loop control system to actively counter blade flutter and reduce vibration.

**V. Fabrication & Integration:**

1.  Fabricate MVGs using micro-fabrication techniques (MEMS).
2.  Embed MVGs and sensor network within the flexible blade sections during the manufacturing process.
3.  Integrate micro-actuators and local microcontrollers within the blade structure.
4.  Establish robust power and communication links between the blade sections and the central flight controller.
