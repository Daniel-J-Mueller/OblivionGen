## Schema-Aware Data Sharding with Predictive Pre-fetching

**Concept:** Extend schema versioning to manage data sharding strategies. As schemas evolve, dynamically re-shard data based on anticipated access patterns derived from schema changes *before* access requests arrive. This is coupled with predictive pre-fetching of data based on the revised sharding and anticipated requests.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shard Strategy Definition:**

*   **Shard Key Generator:** A component responsible for generating shard keys based on object attributes. This generator is *versioned* alongside the schema.
*   **Shard Mapping:** A dynamic mapping between shard keys and physical shard locations (storage nodes). Managed by a central 'Shard Manager' service.
*   **Versioning:** Shard Key Generators & Shard Mappings are versioned, linked directly to schema versions. A schema change triggers a new Shard Key Generator & potentially a new Shard Mapping.

**2. Predictive Resharding Process:**

*   **Schema Change Detection:** The Shard Manager monitors schema changes.
*   **Impact Analysis:** Upon schema change, a component analyzes the change's impact on data access patterns.  (e.g., adding a frequently accessed attribute suggests a new shard key).
*   **Resharding Plan Generation:**  Based on the impact analysis, generate a *plan* for data redistribution.  This plan includes:
    *   New Shard Key Generator version.
    *   Mapping of existing data to new shards.
    *   Estimated data movement costs.
    *   Timeline for migration.
*   **Phased Migration:** Migrate data in phases to minimize disruption:
    1.  **Shadowing:**  New writes go to both the old and new shard configurations.
    2.  **Verification:** Compare data consistency between old and new shards.
    3.  **Cutover:**  Redirect all reads and writes to the new configuration.

**3. Predictive Prefetching:**

*   **Access Pattern Modeling:** Based on the *new* schema and anticipated usage, a model predicts likely access patterns. This model focuses on frequently accessed attributes *after* the schema change.
*   **Prefetch Queue:** A queue stores prefetch requests. Requests are generated based on the access pattern model.
*   **Prefetch Execution:** The system proactively fetches data predicted to be needed, storing it in a cache.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Implement a cache invalidation strategy to handle schema changes and data updates.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Shard Key Generation):**

```
function generateShardKey(object, schemaVersion) {
  if (schemaVersion < 2.0) {
    // Old sharding logic based on attribute 'region'
    return hash(object.region);
  } else if (schemaVersion >= 2.0) {
    // New sharding logic based on composite key: 'region' + 'category'
    return hash(object.region + object.category);
  }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `SchemaVersionMap`: Maps schema versions to corresponding Shard Key Generators and Shard Mappings.
*   `AccessPatternModel`:  Stores predicted access patterns, represented as probabilities of accessing specific attributes or attribute combinations.
*   `PrefetchQueue`:  FIFO queue of prefetch requests.
