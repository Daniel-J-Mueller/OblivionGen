## Predictive Cascading Mitigation & Synthetic Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend predictive failure analysis to not just *react* to single infrastructure failures, but to model and preemptively mitigate *cascading* failures across dependent services and dynamically balance load *before* impact occurs – even introducing synthetic load to ‘exercise’ resilient pathways.

**Specs:**

**1. Dependency Mapping & Risk Scoring:**

*   **Data Source:** Integrate with service discovery and configuration management systems to automatically build a dynamic dependency graph of all hosted services and their underlying infrastructure.  This must include inter-service dependencies, not just infrastructure links.
*   **Risk Scoring Algorithm:** Develop a weighted risk scoring algorithm. Factors:
    *   Failure probability (from existing prediction models).
    *   Service criticality (user-defined or derived from business impact analysis).
    *   Dependency depth (number of hops to critical services).
    *   Resource utilization of dependent infrastructure.
*   **Output:**  A continuously updated ‘blast radius’ map, showing potential impact of failures, ranked by risk score.

**2.  Cascading Failure Simulation:**

*   **Engine:** A simulation engine that models the impact of a single failure across the dependency graph. This is not just about direct dependencies but also the knock-on effects of increased load on shared resources.
*   **Simulation Parameters:**  Allow configuration of failure scenarios (e.g., complete outage, degraded performance, intermittent errors).
*   **Output:** Predicted impact timelines (e.g., service degradation, data loss) and a ranking of potential mitigation actions based on cost/benefit analysis.

**3. Proactive Mitigation & Synthetic Load Generation:**

*   **Mitigation Actions:**  Expanded beyond existing options. Include:
    *   **Dynamic Routing:** Shifting traffic to healthy instances or regions.
    *   **Resource Pre-Scaling:**  Provisioning additional resources in anticipation of increased load.
    *   **Service Degradation:** Gracefully disabling non-essential features.
    *   **Synthetic Load Injection:**  This is the key innovation.  Generate artificial traffic to less-used but resilient pathways to ensure they are ready to handle increased load during a real failure. Think of it like ‘stress testing’ the backup systems proactively.  Adjust load dynamically based on simulation results.
*   **Policy Engine:**  Defines rules for automated mitigation.  For example: "If the predicted failure of the primary database exceeds a probability of 80%, inject synthetic load into the read replicas and pre-scale the database cluster by 50%."

**4.  Closed-Loop Learning & Model Refinement:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the effectiveness of mitigation actions.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Use observed performance data to refine the risk scoring algorithm, simulation models, and mitigation policies.  This is a reinforcement learning problem.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unexpected behavior that may indicate a problem with the mitigation system itself.

**Pseudocode (Mitigation Policy Execution):**

```
function execute_mitigation_policy(predicted_failure_event, risk_score) {
  if (risk_score > 80) {
    // High risk – proactive mitigation
    inject_synthetic_load(read_replicas, increased_load_percentage = 20);
    pre_scale_database_cluster(increase_percentage = 50);
    log("Proactive mitigation triggered for: " + predicted_failure_event);
  } else if (risk_score > 50) {
    // Medium risk – prepare resources
    reserve_capacity(database_cluster, increase_percentage = 20);
    log("Resource reservation triggered for: " + predicted_failure_event);
  } else {
    // Low risk – monitor only
    log("Monitoring predicted failure: " + predicted_failure_event);
  }
}
```
