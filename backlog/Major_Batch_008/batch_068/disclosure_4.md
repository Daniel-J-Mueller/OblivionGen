## Adaptive RF Beaconing for Mesh Network Optimization

**Concept:** Expand on the low-power RF communication channel idea, but instead of *just* relaying keepalive information, the secondary channel facilitates a dynamic, localized mesh network for optimizing data transmission *between* devices, and the router.

**Specifications:**

*   **Device Roles:** A/V device, “Bridge” device (as in the patent), and any other compatible devices within range, act as nodes in a localized mesh network. The router remains the central connection point to the external network.
*   **RF Channels:**
    *   **Primary:** Wi-Fi (high bandwidth, higher power) – For streaming video/data to/from the external network.
    *   **Secondary:** BLE or Zigbee (low power) – Dedicated to mesh network communication.
*   **Beaconing Protocol:** The Bridge device periodically broadcasts “Quality of Link” (QoL) beacons containing metrics gathered from the A/V device and itself:
    *   Signal Strength (RSSI) to the router
    *   Current bandwidth utilization on the Wi-Fi channel
    *   Estimated latency to the router
    *   Device status (streaming, idle, buffering)
*   **Mesh Routing Algorithm:** A distributed algorithm running on all mesh nodes. Nodes share QoL data and calculate optimal routes for data packets *within the mesh*. This is a hop-by-hop, dynamic routing system.
*   **Data Packet Redirection:**
    *   If a mesh node determines a direct path to another node is superior to sending data *through* the Bridge to the router, it redirects the packet accordingly.
    *   This utilizes the low-power RF channel for short-range, high-reliability data transfer.
*   **Adaptive Bandwidth Allocation:**
    *   The Bridge device, acting as a mesh coordinator, analyzes QoL data.
    *   Based on network conditions, it dynamically adjusts video encoding parameters (resolution, bitrate) *before* transmitting to the router.
*   **Wake-Up Signaling:** The Bridge device can utilize BLE advertisements to wake up the A/V device from a deep sleep state, preparing it for video streaming or data transmission *before* the Wi-Fi connection is fully established. This reduces latency.
*   **Emergency Routing:** If the Wi-Fi connection to the router fails, the mesh network can be used to establish a temporary, lower-bandwidth connection between devices *directly*, allowing for limited functionality (e.g., voice communication, critical alerts).

**Pseudocode (Mesh Routing – Simplified):**

```
Node.receivePacket(packet) {
  // Check destination
  if (packet.destination == this.id) {
    // Deliver packet to application
    processPacket(packet)
    return
  }

  // Check for better route
  bestNeighbor = null
  for each neighbor in neighbors {
    if (neighbor.linkQuality(packet.destination) > this.linkQuality(packet.destination)) {
      bestNeighbor = neighbor
      break
    }
  }

  if (bestNeighbor != null) {
    // Forward packet to best neighbor
    bestNeighbor.receivePacket(packet)
  } else {
    // No better route – forward to router (if possible)
    router.receivePacket(packet)
  }
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   All devices require dual-band radios (Wi-Fi and BLE/Zigbee).
*   Antenna design is critical for optimal range and signal strength on both channels.
*   Low-power processors are essential to minimize energy consumption.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Security cameras
*   Live streaming devices
*   Virtual reality headsets
*   Smart home automation systems
*   Industrial monitoring applications
