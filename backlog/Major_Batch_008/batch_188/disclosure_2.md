**Adaptive Character Reconstruction via Generative Adversarial Networks**

**Specification:**

1.  **System Overview:** A system integrating scanned image input, initial OCR processing, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for character reconstruction, and a refinement OCR pass.

2.  **Input:** Scanned image containing text.

3.  **Initial OCR:** Standard OCR engine processes the image, generating character bounding boxes and initial character predictions.  This initial pass *intentionally* accepts lower confidence predictions, outputting bounding boxes and associated, potentially flawed, character data.

4.  **GAN Architecture:**
    *   **Generator:** A convolutional neural network (CNN) taking character bounding box images as input. Output is a reconstructed character image.
    *   **Discriminator:** A CNN taking either a reconstructed character image (from the Generator) or a ground truth character image (from a training dataset) as input. Output is a probability indicating whether the input is real or generated.
    *   **Training Data:** A large dataset of clean character images, segmented by character type/font.  Augmentation techniques (rotation, skew, noise) applied during training.

5.  **Reconstruction Process:**
    *   For each character bounding box identified by the initial OCR:
        *   Crop the image region within the bounding box.
        *   Pass the cropped image to the Generator.
        *   The Generator produces a reconstructed character image.

6.  **Confidence Scoring:**
    *   A secondary CNN, trained to classify character quality (e.g., "clear", "blurred", "fragmented"), assesses the reconstructed character image.  Output is a confidence score.

7.  **Adaptive Refinement:**
    *   If the confidence score exceeds a predetermined threshold:
        *   Replace the initial OCR character prediction with the reconstructed character image.
    *   If the confidence score is below the threshold:
        *   Retain the initial OCR character prediction.

8.  **Refinement OCR:** A final OCR pass on the refined image. This pass uses the adaptive refinement data to improve accuracy.

9.  **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    function reconstruct_text(image):
      initial_ocr_data = perform_initial_ocr(image)
      for each character_bounding_box in initial_ocr_data:
        cropped_image = crop_image(image, character_bounding_box)
        reconstructed_image = generator(cropped_image)
        confidence_score = quality_classifier(reconstructed_image)
        if confidence_score > threshold:
          character_bounding_box.character = reconstructed_image
      refined_image = apply_refined_data(image, refined_data)
      final_ocr_data = perform_final_ocr(refined_image)
      return final_ocr_data
    ```

10. **Hardware Requirements:** GPU-accelerated processing for GAN training and inference. Sufficient memory for large datasets and models.

11. **Potential Extensions:**  Font/style detection integration to refine reconstruction. Contextual analysis to further improve character predictions. Adaptive thresholding based on image quality.
