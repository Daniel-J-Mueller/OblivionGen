## Dynamic Reputation Propagation & Tiered Access Control

**Concept:** Extend the risk scoring and mitigation system to not only assess individual accounts but also dynamically propagate reputation scores *between* linked accounts and define tiered access based on aggregated risk. This builds a "web of trust" (or distrust) allowing for granular control beyond simple blocking/alerting.

**Specifications:**

**1. Reputation Score Components:**

*   **Individual Account Score (IAS):** Existing risk score based on heuristics (age, geolocation, etc.).
*   **Linkage Weight (LW):**  A configurable value representing the strength of the relationship between accounts.  Higher LW for verified relationships (e.g., primary/secondary billing), lower for inferred ones (e.g., shared device fingerprint).  LW determined via API/configuration.
*   **Propagation Factor (PF):**  A decay factor applied during reputation score propagation.  This prevents cascading failures due to a single compromised account.  PF configurable per Linkage Type.
*   **Historical Behavior Modifier (HBM):**  A factor derived from the historical behavior of linked accounts.  Positive for consistently reliable accounts, negative for those with frequent flagged activity.

**2. Reputation Propagation Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function calculate_aggregated_score(account_id):
  base_score = get_individual_account_score(account_id)
  linked_accounts = get_linked_accounts(account_id)
  aggregated_score = base_score

  for linked_account in linked_accounts:
    linkage_weight = get_linkage_weight(account_id, linked_account)
    linked_score = get_individual_account_score(linked_account)
    propagation_factor = get_propagation_factor(account_id, linked_account)
    historical_modifier = get_historical_behavior_modifier(linked_account)

    propagated_score = linked_score * linkage_weight * propagation_factor * historical_modifier
    aggregated_score += propagated_score

  return aggregated_score
```

**3. Tiered Access Control:**

Define access tiers based on the calculated aggregated score.  Example tiers:

*   **Tier 0 (High Risk):** Account locked. Requires manual review.
*   **Tier 1 (Medium-High Risk):**  Rate limited.  Requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) for sensitive actions.  Increased monitoring.
*   **Tier 2 (Medium Risk):**  Standard access.  Monitored for unusual behavior.
*   **Tier 3 (Low Risk):**  Full access.  Minimal monitoring.

Tier assignment triggers actions:

*   **Tier Downgrade:**  If aggregated score drops, automatically downgrade access tier and initiate mitigation measures.
*   **Tier Upgrade:** If aggregated score improves, automatically upgrade access tier.

**4. API Extensions:**

*   `get_linked_accounts(account_id)`: Returns a list of linked account IDs.
*   `set_linkage_weight(account_id, linked_account, weight)`:  Configures the linkage weight between accounts.
*   `get_aggregated_score(account_id)`:  Returns the calculated aggregated score for an account.
*   `get_access_tier(account_id)`: Returns the current access tier for an account.

**5. Infrastructure Considerations:**

*   **Graph Database:** Utilize a graph database to efficiently store and query account relationships.
*   **Distributed Caching:** Cache aggregated scores to minimize latency.
*   **Real-time Processing:** Implement a real-time processing pipeline to update scores as new data becomes available.
