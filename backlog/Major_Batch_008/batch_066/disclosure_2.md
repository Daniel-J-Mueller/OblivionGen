## Adaptive Precision Scaling via Per-Operator Quantization Profiles

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the precision (bit-width) of each operator within a CNN *during* inference, based on real-time sensitivity analysis and hardware capabilities. This moves beyond static quantization or mixed-precision training by allowing the network to adapt to individual input data characteristics and resource availability.

**Specification:**

1.  **Per-Operator Sensitivity Metric:** Implement a “Sensitivity Score” for each operator. This score reflects how much the operator’s output impacts the final network accuracy. Higher sensitivity = more precision needed. Calculate this during a calibration phase with a representative dataset.  Factors influencing the score:
    *   Gradient magnitude w.r.t. the operator's output during calibration.
    *   Operator type (e.g., convolutions generally more sensitive than ReLU).
    *   Layer depth (earlier layers often more sensitive).

2.  **Hardware Capability Profiling:** Each target hardware platform (GPU, integrated graphics) will have a defined “Precision Profile.” This profile maps supported bit-widths (e.g., FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4) to performance metrics (throughput, latency, power consumption) for different operator types.

3.  **Runtime Adaptation Engine:**  A new engine will reside between the computational graph and the hardware.
    *   **Input Analysis:** For each input tensor, the engine analyzes its statistical properties (range, distribution, entropy).
    *   **Precision Selection:** Based on input analysis, the operator’s Sensitivity Score, and the hardware’s Precision Profile, the engine selects the optimal bit-width for that operator *for that specific input*.
    *   **Dynamic Quantization/Dequantization:** Inject quantization/dequantization nodes into the computational graph *dynamically* based on the chosen bit-width. These nodes will handle the conversion between floating-point and integer representations.
    *   **Kernel Dispatch:** Dispatch the appropriate optimized kernel (e.g., INT8 convolution kernel) based on the selected bit-width.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function execute_inference(input_tensor, model_graph, hardware_profile):
    for operator in model_graph:
        sensitivity_score = operator.get_sensitivity_score()
        input_stats = analyze_input(input_tensor)
        optimal_precision = select_precision(sensitivity_score, input_stats, hardware_profile)

        quantize_node = create_quantization_node(operator.output, optimal_precision)
        dequantize_node = create_dequantization_node(operator.output, optimal_precision)

        insert_nodes(quantize_node, dequantize_node, operator) # Insert into graph

        dispatch_kernel(operator, optimal_precision) # Dispatch optimized kernel
```

**Innovation:**  This system moves beyond static mixed-precision and adaptive precision techniques that focus on layer-level adjustments.  It provides *per-operator* dynamic precision scaling, tailoring precision to both the input data and the hardware capabilities in real time. This could significantly improve performance and energy efficiency, particularly on resource-constrained devices, with minimal accuracy loss.
