## Automated Environmental Enrichment for Animals

**System Overview:**

This system extends the core concept of animal detection within an environment (as seen in the provided patent) to *proactively* enrich that environment based on the detected animal’s behavior and preferences.  It leverages a network of connected devices – cameras, speakers, automated toy dispensers, scent diffusers – controlled by a central processing unit. The system aims to reduce animal stress, prevent boredom, and potentially provide therapeutic interventions.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Modal Sensor Suite:**  High-resolution cameras (RGB & Infrared), microphones, potentially tactile sensors embedded in flooring/furniture.
*   **Actuator Network:**
    *   Automated Toy Dispensers (variety of toys – balls, puzzles, laser pointers).
    *   Scent Diffusers (pre-loaded with animal-safe calming/stimulating scents – catnip, lavender, etc.).
    *   Smart Speakers (capable of playing calming music, pre-recorded voice commands, or synthesized animal sounds).
    *   Environmental Control (smart lights capable of adjusting color & intensity, temperature control).
*   **Edge Computing Device:** A local processing unit to handle real-time data analysis and actuator control.  Connects to the central server via secure network.
*   **Central Server:** Hosts the AI models for behavior analysis, preference learning, and system management.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Behavior Recognition Module:**
    *   AI model (CNN/RNN combination) trained to recognize animal behaviors: playing, sleeping, eating, grooming, displaying anxiety (pacing, hiding, vocalization), and specific body postures.
    *   Input: Video & audio streams from the sensor suite.
    *   Output: Probability scores for each recognized behavior.
2.  **Preference Learning Module:**
    *   Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent.
    *   State: Animal's current behavior, time of day, environmental conditions.
    *   Action: Activate a specific actuator (dispense toy, play music, release scent).
    *   Reward: Positive reward for actions that lead to relaxed/engaged behavior (as determined by continued positive behavior recognition). Negative reward for actions that trigger anxiety.
    *   Stores individualized preference profiles for each animal.
3.  **Environmental Enrichment Engine:**
    *   Combines behavior recognition output with preference learning to select optimal enrichment actions.
    *   Prioritizes actions based on animal’s current state. (e.g., if animal displays anxiety, trigger calming scent/music).
    *   Dynamically adjusts enrichment over time based on learning.

**Pseudocode (Enrichment Engine):**

```
// Define animal state
animalState = BehaviorRecognitionModule.Analyze(sensorData)

// Load animal's preference profile
preferences = PreferenceLearningModule.LoadProfile(animalID)

// Calculate enrichment score for each action
FOR each action IN possibleActions:
    enrichmentScore = 0
    IF action matches current animalState:
        enrichmentScore += preferences[action].weight
    IF action counters observed anxiety:
        enrichmentScore += anxietyCounterWeight

// Select action with highest enrichment score
selectedAction = Action with highest enrichmentScore

// Activate actuator
ActuatorNetwork.Activate(selectedAction)

// Update preference profile based on outcome (reward/penalty)
PreferenceLearningModule.UpdateProfile(animalID, selectedAction, outcome)
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Animal ID
*   Behavior History (time-stamped)
*   Preference Profile (weights for each action)
*   Environmental Data (temperature, humidity, light levels)
*   Actuator Usage Logs

**Use Cases:**

*   **Pet Sitting/Boarding:**  Automated enrichment for animals while owners are away.
*   **Veterinary Clinics/Animal Shelters:** Reduce animal stress and improve welfare.
*   **Zoo Environments:** Enhance animal stimulation and encourage natural behaviors.
*   **Home Use:**  Provide personalized enrichment for companion animals.
