**Adaptive Password Complexity Based on Behavioral Biometrics & Environmental Factors**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust password complexity *after* initial creation, based on a continuous assessment of user behavior and environmental risk factors, rather than relying solely on upfront complexity rules.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometric Engine:** Continuously monitors user interactions with devices: typing speed, rhythm, mouse movements, scrolling behavior, touch pressure, app usage patterns, and typical login times/locations. This creates a baseline "behavioral profile."
*   **Environmental Risk Assessment Module:** Gathers contextual data: network security (public Wi-Fi vs. corporate network), device security (encryption status, OS patch level), location (proximity to known high-risk areas), time of day, and unusual access attempts.
*   **Password ‘Mutation’ Engine:**  A system capable of subtly altering existing passwords *without* user intervention, introducing additional characters, altering capitalization, or swapping similar-looking characters (e.g., 'l' for '1', 'O' for '0').  This is done incrementally to avoid detection or disruption.
*   **User Authentication Module:** Integrates with existing authentication systems. When a user attempts login, the system compares current behavior and environmental factors against the established baseline.  Significant deviations trigger increased password complexity via the Mutation Engine.

**III. Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Establish_Baseline_Behavior(user_id)
Establish_Environmental_Context(user_id)

// Login Attempt
On_Login_Attempt(user_id, password_attempt) {
  Current_Behavior = Analyze_Behavior(user_id)
  Current_Environment = Analyze_Environment(user_id)

  Deviation_Score = Calculate_Deviation(Current_Behavior, Baseline_Behavior) +
                    Calculate_Deviation(Current_Environment, Baseline_Environment)

  If (Deviation_Score > Threshold) {
    // Increase Password Complexity
    Mutated_Password = Mutate_Password(user_id, password_attempt, Deviation_Score)
    Validate_Password(user_id, Mutated_Password) // Validate against the mutated version
  } else {
    Validate_Password(user_id, password_attempt) // Normal validation
  }
}

//Password Mutation Logic
Mutate_Password(user_id, password, deviation_score) {
    num_mutations = map(deviation_score, 0, 100, 0, 3); //scale deviation to number of mutations

    for(i=0 to num_mutations) {
       random_index = random(0, length(password));
       random_mutation_type = random(0, 2); //0=add char, 1=swap char, 2=capitalize

       if(random_mutation_type == 0){
          password = insert_random_character(password, random_index);
       } else if (random_mutation_type == 1) {
           password = swap_characters(password, random_index, random(0, length(password)));
       } else {
           password = capitalize_character(password, random_index);
       }
    }
    return password;
}
```

**IV. Security Considerations:**

*   **Transparency:** Users should be informed (in a non-alarming way) that their password security is dynamically adapting.
*   **Recoverability:** Mechanisms must be in place to recover access if dynamic mutation renders a user’s remembered password unusable (e.g., a ‘password reset’ flow that accounts for possible mutations).
*   **Mutation Limits:**  Implement a maximum number of allowed mutations to prevent passwords from becoming completely unrecognizable.
*   **Mutation History:** Maintain a secure log of password mutations for auditing and recovery purposes.
