## Dynamic Attribute Weighting for Cluster Partitioning

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on learning attribute similarity *after* initial cluster formation and selection. This design explores dynamically weighting attributes *during* the cluster formation process itself, optimizing for intra-cluster similarity *before* partitioning occurs. This enables more nuanced and effective cluster creation based on the relative importance of different attributes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `AttributeWeightVector`: A vector storing weights for each attribute.  Each element `weight[i]` represents the importance of attribute `i`.
*   `SimilarityMetric`:  An abstract class defining how attribute similarity is calculated.  Implementations could include Euclidean distance, cosine similarity, etc.
*   `ClusterCandidate`: Represents a potential cluster being built.  Contains a list of entity records and a cumulative similarity score.

**2. Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   Create an `AttributeWeightVector` initialized with equal weights for all attributes.
    *   Define a set of `SimilarityMetric` implementations for each attribute type (text, numeric, etc.).
2.  **Iterative Cluster Building:**
    *   Start with a seed entity record.
    *   For each remaining entity record:
        *   Calculate a weighted similarity score to the seed record and all existing records in the current `ClusterCandidate`.  
            *   `weighted_similarity = Î£ (weight[i] * similarity_metric[i](entity1, entity2))` where `i` iterates through all attributes.
        *   If the weighted similarity score exceeds a threshold:
            *   Add the entity record to the `ClusterCandidate`.
            *   **Weight Adjustment:**
                *   For each attribute, calculate the contribution of that attribute to the overall weighted similarity score for *all* entity records in the `ClusterCandidate`.
                *   Adjust the `AttributeWeightVector` based on these contributions.  Attributes that contribute more to higher similarity scores get increased weight.  Conversely, attributes that contribute to lower similarity scores get decreased weight. Use a learning rate parameter to control the magnitude of the weight adjustments.
        *   If the weighted similarity score falls below the threshold, the entity record is considered for a different cluster or remains unclustered.
3.  **Cluster Finalization:**  Once a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum cluster size reached, no more entities meeting the threshold), the `ClusterCandidate` is finalized as a cluster.
4.  **Repeat:** Repeat steps 2 and 3 until all entity records are clustered.

**Pseudocode (Core Weight Adjustment):**

```python
def adjust_weights(cluster, attribute_weights, learning_rate):
  """
  Adjusts attribute weights based on contributions to cluster similarity.
  """
  total_contribution = {}  # Store total contribution of each attribute
  for i in range(num_attributes):
    total_contribution[i] = 0.0

  for entity1 in cluster:
    for entity2 in cluster:
      weighted_similarity = 0.0
      for i in range(num_attributes):
        similarity = calculate_attribute_similarity(entity1, entity2, i) # function to calculate similarity
        weighted_similarity += attribute_weights[i] * similarity
      
      for i in range(num_attributes):
          similarity = calculate_attribute_similarity(entity1, entity2, i)
          total_contribution[i] += similarity
          
  # Update weights
  for i in range(num_attributes):
    attribute_weights[i] += learning_rate * total_contribution[i] # Or a more complex update rule
```

**3. Implementation Details:**

*   **Attribute Similarity Metrics:** Implement appropriate `SimilarityMetric` implementations for each attribute type (e.g., string similarity metrics for text attributes, Euclidean distance for numeric attributes).
*   **Learning Rate:** Experiment with different learning rates to find a value that allows the weights to converge effectively.
*   **Stopping Criterion:** Define a clear stopping criterion for the iterative cluster building process (e.g., maximum cluster size, minimum similarity score).
*   **Parallelization:**  The similarity calculations can be easily parallelized to improve performance.



This design moves beyond simply learning similarity *after* cluster formation and instead dynamically optimizes cluster creation based on attribute weighting.  This should yield more meaningful and robust clusters.
