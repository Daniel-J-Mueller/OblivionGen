## Dynamic Fact Provenance & Temporal Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the core contradiction detection to incorporate *provenance* of facts (where they originated) and *temporal resolution* (when the fact was asserted or believed to be true).  The system should move beyond simple contradiction *now* to assess evolving consistency over time, and flag potential inconsistencies based on source reliability.

**Specs:**

1.  **Provenance Metadata:** Each identified “fact” must be tagged with metadata indicating its origin. Origins can be:
    *   Explicit Statement: Direct text from the internal work.
    *   External Resource: URL, API endpoint, reference to external data.
    *   Inferred Fact: Derived from other facts within the system using a defined rule set (see Rule Engine).
    *   User Assertion: Manually added by a user, with user ID and timestamp.

2.  **Temporal Tagging:** Each fact must also have a timestamp (or time range) indicating when it was asserted as true.  This could be based on document creation date, modification date, user input timestamp, or a dedicated “belief date” field.

3.  **Rule Engine:** A configurable rule engine to define relationships between facts.  Rules are expressed as:
    *   IF Fact A (provenance X, time Y) AND Fact B (provenance Z, time W) THEN  Conflict/Support/Neutral
    *   Rules can be weighted based on source reliability.  For example, a fact from a peer-reviewed journal carries more weight than a user assertion.

4.  **Temporal Conflict Resolution:**  Conflict detection is not simply “A contradicts B.”  It’s “A (time T1) contradicts B (time T2) *given* the temporal relationship and the provenance of A and B.”  Examples:
    *   If A (old, unreliable source) contradicts B (new, reliable source), flag as low priority.
    *   If A (time T1) contradicts B (time T2) and T2 > T1, consider it a potential revision or update, not necessarily a contradiction.
    *   If A and B have overlapping time ranges and contradictory content, it's a high-priority contradiction.

5.  **Dynamic Confidence Scoring:**  The contradiction confidence level isn't just a calculation based on text similarity.  It’s a dynamic score that incorporates:
    *   Provenance reliability.
    *   Temporal relationship.
    *   Rule engine weights.
    *   Contextual factors (similar to the existing patent).

6.  **Visualization Layer:** A user interface that displays:
    *   The contradictory facts.
    *   Their provenance metadata.
    *   Their temporal relationships (e.g., a timeline).
    *   The dynamic confidence score.
    *   The rules that triggered the conflict detection.

**Pseudocode (Contradiction Detection):**

```
function detectContradiction(factA, factB):
  confidenceScore = calculateBaseConfidence(factA, factB) // Existing text similarity calculation
  confidenceScore += provenanceWeight(factA.provenance, factB.provenance)
  confidenceScore += temporalWeight(factA.timestamp, factB.timestamp)
  
  rules = applyRules(factA, factB)  // Apply rules from Rule Engine
  for rule in rules:
    confidenceScore += rule.weight
  
  if confidenceScore > threshold:
    return Contradiction(factA, factB, confidenceScore)
  else:
    return NoContradiction
```

**Possible Extensions:**

*   **Automated Fact Repair:** Suggest potential revisions to the internal work based on external resources or user input.
*   **Knowledge Graph Integration:** Represent facts and relationships as a knowledge graph for more sophisticated reasoning.
*   **Predictive Consistency:**  Identify potential future inconsistencies based on trends in the data.
