## Dynamic Policy Attestation via Blockchain

**Concept:** Extend TPM-based security policies with a blockchain-based attestation service. This creates a tamper-proof audit trail of policy deployments and verifications, enhancing trust and accountability in multi-tenant cloud environments.

**Specification:**

**1. Components:**

*   **Policy Administration Service (PAS):** Existing component. Generates and distributes network security policies.
*   **Security Agent (SA):** Existing component, running on each computing device. Receives, decrypts, and implements policies.
*   **Attestation Service (AS):** New component. A blockchain-based service responsible for receiving, verifying, and recording policy attestation data. Utilizes a permissioned blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric) for control and scalability.
*   **TPM:** Trusted Platform Module on each computing device. Used for key storage and secure measurements.

**2. Workflow:**

1.  **Policy Deployment:** PAS generates a network security policy and encrypts it using the computing device's public key (obtained through a secure key exchange).
2.  **Policy Reception & Decryption:** SA receives the encrypted policy, decrypts it using the private key stored in the TPM, and implements it.
3.  **Attestation Generation:**  SA generates an attestation record. This record includes:
    *   Policy Hash:  SHA256 hash of the implemented network security policy.
    *   TPM Measurement:  A PCR (Platform Configuration Register) value from the TPM reflecting the current system configuration and the deployed policy. This confirms the policy was loaded into a known good state.
    *   Timestamp:  UTC timestamp of the attestation.
    *   Device Identifier: Unique identifier for the computing device.
4.  **Attestation Submission:** SA submits the attestation record to the AS. The submission is digitally signed using the TPM's private key, ensuring authenticity.
5.  **Attestation Verification:** AS verifies:
    *   Signature:  Verifies the signature on the attestation record using the deviceâ€™s public key.
    *   Policy Hash Integrity:  Re-hashes the implemented policy (obtained from the device or a trusted repository) and compares it to the hash in the attestation record.
    *   TPM Measurement Validity: Validates the PCR value against a predefined baseline configuration or expected values.
6.  **Blockchain Recording:** Upon successful verification, AS records the attestation data on the blockchain. This creates a permanent, tamper-proof audit trail.
7.  **PAS Verification:** PAS can query the blockchain to verify the current status of deployed policies on any computing device. This enables automated compliance monitoring and incident response.

**3. Data Structures:**

*   **Attestation Record (JSON):**

```json
{
  "device_id": "unique_device_identifier",
  "policy_hash": "SHA256_hash_of_policy",
  "tpm_measurement": "PCR_value",
  "timestamp": "UTC_timestamp",
  "signature": "Digital_signature"
}
```

**4. Pseudocode (Security Agent - Attestation Generation):**

```pseudocode
function generateAttestationRecord():
  policyHash = SHA256(implementedNetworkSecurityPolicy)
  tpmMeasurement = getTPMMeasurement() // Retrieve PCR value
  timestamp = getCurrentUTC()
  attestationRecord = {
    "device_id": getDeviceId(),
    "policy_hash": policyHash,
    "tpm_measurement": tpmMeasurement,
    "timestamp": timestamp
  }
  signature = sign(attestationRecord, TPM_private_key)
  attestationRecord["signature"] = signature
  return attestationRecord

function submitAttestation(record):
  send record to Attestation Service
```

**5. Scalability & Performance Considerations:**

*   **Permissioned Blockchain:**  Using a permissioned blockchain limits access and improves transaction throughput compared to public blockchains.
*   **Batching:** SA can batch attestation records before submitting them to the AS to reduce network overhead.
*   **Asynchronous Processing:** AS can process attestation submissions asynchronously to prevent performance bottlenecks.
