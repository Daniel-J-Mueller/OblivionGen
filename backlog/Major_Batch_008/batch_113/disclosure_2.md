**Dynamic Request Shaping with Predictive Load Balancing**

**Specification:**

This system builds upon the concept of dynamically adjusting request rates but extends it with predictive load balancing and a tiered request handling system. The core idea is to anticipate workload shifts *before* they impact performance and proactively adjust request handling strategies across multiple service instances.

**Components:**

1.  **Workload Prediction Engine:**
    *   Input: Historical request data (request type, processing time, source), real-time request rate, system resource utilization (CPU, memory, network I/O), external event feeds (e.g., marketing campaign launches, scheduled maintenance).
    *   Process: Employs time-series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future workload patterns for *each request type*.  Crucially, it predicts not just the total request rate but the *distribution* of request types.
    *   Output:  Probabilistic forecasts of request rates and type distributions for a defined future time horizon (e.g., next 5, 15, 30 minutes).

2.  **Request Tiering System:**
    *   Request Classification: Categorizes incoming requests into multiple tiers (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on predefined criteria (e.g., SLA, user priority, business impact).  This classification can be dynamic based on context.
    *   Tier-Specific Rate Limiting:  Each tier has its own configurable maximum allowable request rate.
    *   Tier-Specific Service Instances:  Requests are routed to designated service instances based on their tier.  This allows for dedicated resources for critical workloads.

3.  **Dynamic Load Balancer:**
    *   Input: Workload predictions, current system load, tier-specific rate limits, health of service instances.
    *   Process:  Uses a predictive control algorithm to proactively adjust the distribution of requests across service instances. The goal is to maintain optimal resource utilization and meet SLA targets. It can preemptively scale up or down service instances based on predicted demand.
    *   Output: Routing instructions for incoming requests.

4.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors actual system performance (response times, error rates, resource utilization).
    *   Compares actual performance against predicted performance.
    *   Uses the difference to refine the workload prediction models and control algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Load Balancer):**

```
function routeRequest(request):
  tier = classifyRequest(request)
  predictedLoad = getPredictedLoad(tier)
  currentLoad = getCurrentLoad()
  
  if predictedLoad > currentLoad:
    //Scale up resources proactively
    scaleUp(tier)
  
  //Determine the best service instance for the request
  bestInstance = selectServiceInstance(tier, currentLoad)
  
  //Route the request to the best instance
  routeTo(request, bestInstance)

function selectServiceInstance(tier, currentLoad):
  //Prioritize instances with the lowest load
  //Consider instance health and capacity
  //Apply a weighted scoring system based on these factors
  return bestInstance

function scaleUp(tier):
  //Provision additional resources for the specified tier
  //This could involve launching new instances or increasing the capacity of existing instances
  //Implement automated scaling policies based on predicted demand
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems primarily focus on reactive rate limiting based on *current* load. This system is proactive, using predictive modeling to anticipate load shifts and adjust request handling strategies *before* they impact performance. The tiered request handling system allows for fine-grained control over resource allocation and prioritization of critical workloads.
