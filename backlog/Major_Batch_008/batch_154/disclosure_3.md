## Secure Key Derivation via Biofeedback-Triggered Enclaves

**Concept:** Leverage a user’s unique biofeedback signals (e.g., EEG, ECG, GSR) to dynamically influence key derivation *within* the protected execution environment (enclave). This creates a continuously evolving, user-bound key, significantly enhancing security against key theft and replay attacks. 

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensor Suite:**  Non-invasive sensors to capture real-time biofeedback data.  Minimum: EEG (frontal lobe activity). Preferred:  EEG + ECG + GSR (Galvanic Skin Response).
*   **Secure Element/Trusted Platform Module (TPM):**  Provides initial hardware root of trust, storing a master seed and facilitating secure communication with the enclave.
*   **Enclave-capable Processor:** Supports secure enclaves (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV).

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Biofeedback Pre-processing Module (within enclave):**  Filters, normalizes, and extracts relevant features from the raw biofeedback data.  Focus on features exhibiting high variability and low predictability.
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF) – Enhanced:** Standard KDF (e.g., HKDF) modified to *incorporate* the biofeedback features as entropy input. The KDF should be designed to amplify even small variations in biofeedback into significant key differences.
*   **Entropy Monitor:** Continuously assesses the entropy of the biofeedback input.  If entropy falls below a threshold (indicating predictable biofeedback or sensor malfunction), the system falls back to a pre-defined backup key derivation mechanism, and alerts the user.
*   **Key Rotation/Refresh Mechanism:**  The key is *not* static.  The KDF is repeatedly invoked at short intervals (e.g., every 5-10 seconds) using the latest biofeedback data to generate a new key version. Old key versions are securely archived (encrypted with the latest key) for auditing and recovery purposes.
*   **Authentication Protocol:** A challenge-response authentication protocol built on the dynamically generated keys. The server presents a challenge, and the client (enclave) uses the current key to generate a response.

**3. System Operation:**

1.  **Initial Enrollment:**  The user undergoes a brief enrollment phase where the system captures baseline biofeedback data. This data is used to calibrate the biofeedback pre-processing module and establish a baseline for anomaly detection.  A master seed is generated and securely stored in the TPM.
2.  **Runtime Operation:**
    *   Biofeedback data is continuously streamed from the sensors to the enclave.
    *   The biofeedback pre-processing module extracts relevant features.
    *   The enhanced KDF uses the master seed *and* the biofeedback features to generate a session key.
    *   The session key is used to encrypt/decrypt data within the enclave.
    *   The KDF is repeatedly invoked to refresh the session key at short intervals.
3.  **Authentication:**  When authentication is required, the server issues a challenge.  The enclave uses the current session key to encrypt the challenge, and sends the encrypted response back to the server.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function derive_key(master_seed, biofeedback_features):
    // Normalize biofeedback features
    normalized_features = normalize(biofeedback_features)

    // Concatenate master seed and normalized features
    input_data = master_seed + normalized_features

    // Apply KDF (e.g., HKDF)
    derived_key = HKDF(input_data, salt, info)

    return derived_key
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Sensor Spoofing:** Mitigate by using multiple sensor modalities and employing anomaly detection algorithms to identify and reject spoofed data.
*   **Biofeedback Predictability:**  Use complex feature extraction techniques and ensure a high sampling rate to minimize predictability.
*   **Enclave Compromise:**  The system still relies on the security of the enclave. Implement robust enclave integrity checks.
*   **Side-Channel Attacks:**  Address potential side-channel attacks through careful code optimization and hardware shielding.
