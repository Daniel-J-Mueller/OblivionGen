## Adaptive Resolution Cell Decomposition for Dynamic Scenes

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** High-resolution camera array (minimum 4K), GPU with tensor cores, edge computing device (Nvidia Jetson equivalent or better).
*   **Software:** Custom software stack built on OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and a real-time operating system (RTOS).

**Innovation Description:**

The core idea is to build on the cell-based decomposition described in the patent, but introduce *dynamic* cell resolution based on local scene complexity and motion. Instead of a fixed grid, the system creates a Voronoi diagram or Delaunay triangulation over the image. The vertices of this diagram represent "feature points" â€“ edges, corners, high-gradient regions, or areas of significant motion (detected via optical flow). Cells are then formed *around* these feature points.

Cells containing high feature density or rapid motion are subdivided into smaller cells. Conversely, cells in static, uniform regions are merged into larger cells. This creates an adaptive resolution map where areas of interest are analyzed at a finer granularity, while redundant areas are efficiently summarized.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
image = capture_image()
feature_points = detect_features(image) // e.g., using Harris corner detection, SIFT, or FAST
motion_vectors = calculate_optical_flow(image, previous_image)

// Adaptive Cell Creation
voronoi_diagram = create_voronoi_diagram(feature_points)
cells = generate_cells_from_diagram(voronoi_diagram)

// Refinement: Cell Splitting & Merging
for each cell in cells:
    complexity = calculate_cell_complexity(cell, image) // Based on gradient magnitude, entropy, etc.
    motion = calculate_cell_motion(cell, motion_vectors)
    if complexity > threshold_high AND motion > threshold_high:
        split_cell(cell) // Recursively subdivide
    elif complexity < threshold_low AND motion < threshold_low:
        merge_cell(cell, adjacent_cell) // Merge with nearby cells

// Descriptor Calculation
for each cell in cells:
    cell_descriptor = extract_features(cell, image) // e.g., histograms of gradients, color moments
    aggregate_descriptors(cell_descriptor, global_descriptor)

// Classification
predicted_object_type = apply_classifier(global_descriptor)
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

*   **Increased Efficiency:**  Dynamic cell resolution drastically reduces computational load by focusing processing power on relevant areas.
*   **Improved Accuracy:** Finer resolution in complex regions captures crucial details, leading to more accurate object recognition and tracking.
*   **Robustness to Occlusion & Clutter:** Adaptive grids can reconfigure themselves around occluded objects, maintaining recognition even in challenging scenarios.
*   **Applications:** Autonomous navigation, robotics, real-time video surveillance, augmented reality.
