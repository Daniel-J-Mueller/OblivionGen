**Adaptive Resonance Power Distribution Network**

**Concept:** A distributed power network leveraging the principles of Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) to dynamically optimize power delivery from variable sources (like photovoltaics) to multiple loads with differing demands. This moves beyond selecting *a* converter to actively *reshaping* the power flow across a network of converters.

**Specs:**

*   **Network Topology:** Mesh network. Each node contains:
    *   A bi-directional DC-DC converter (Buck-Boost preferred)
    *   Microcontroller with communication capabilities (e.g., CAN bus, Zigbee)
    *   Voltage/Current sensors (input/output)
    *   Local energy storage (supercapacitor or small battery – optional, for smoothing)
*   **Central Controller:** A higher-level processor/computer responsible for network initialization and high-level goal setting (e.g., maximize total energy delivered, prioritize specific loads). This isn’t a *strict* central controller; it facilitates distributed decision-making.
*   **ART Implementation:** Each node implements a simplified ART algorithm.
    *   **Vigilance Parameter (ρ):** Dynamically adjusted based on source availability, load demand, and network stability. Higher ρ = more exploration of alternative power paths.
    *   **Category Representation:** Each category represents a specific power flow configuration (converter settings, active network paths).
    *   **Resonance Testing:** Each node continuously monitors its input power and compares it to stored category representations. If a strong resonance is detected (i.e., a close match), the node maintains its current configuration. If resonance is weak, the node explores alternative configurations.
*   **Distributed Learning:** Each node independently adjusts its category representations based on its local experiences. The central controller can provide occasional “hints” or global optimization goals, but the majority of learning happens at the node level.
*   **Power Flow Control:**  Nodes ‘bid’ for power based on load demand and available source capacity.  The ART algorithm mediates these bids, directing power flow along the most efficient and stable paths.
*   **Redundancy & Fault Tolerance:** Mesh network topology provides inherent redundancy. If a node or link fails, the ART algorithm automatically reroutes power around the failure.
*   **Dynamic Reconfiguration:**  Network adapts in real-time to changing conditions (e.g., cloud cover, load switching).

**Pseudocode (Node Level):**

```
// Initialization
ρ = 0.7  // Initial vigilance parameter
categories = [] // Empty category list

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Measure input power (voltage, current)
  inputPower = measurePower()

  // Find best matching category
  bestCategory = findBestCategory(inputPower, categories)

  // Calculate resonance
  resonance = calculateResonance(inputPower, bestCategory)

  if (resonance > ρ) {
    // Maintain current configuration
    configureConverter(bestCategory.converterSettings)
  } else {
    // Explore alternative configurations
    newConverterSettings = exploreConverterSettings() // (e.g., randomized search, gradient descent)
    configureConverter(newConverterSettings)

    // Update category list
    categories.add(new Category(newConverterSettings, inputPower))
  }

  // Communicate with neighbors (exchange power demand/availability)
  communicateWithNeighbors()
}
```

**Innovation:** Moves beyond *selecting* a pre-defined converter configuration to *dynamically shaping* the entire power network in response to changing conditions. The ART algorithm provides a biologically inspired mechanism for distributed learning and adaptation, enhancing robustness and efficiency.
