## Secure Virtual Machine Instance Migration with Dynamic Trust Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the secure boot and attestation process to enable *live* migration of virtual machine instances between physical hosts *without* re-establishing trust each time. Current systems establish trust at boot and potentially during migration, but don't account for ongoing trust validation during runtime. This design introduces a continuous attestation loop, leveraging the offload device's security component and a distributed ledger for dynamic trust scoring.

**Specs:**

**1.  Distributed Trust Ledger (DTL):**

*   **Technology:** Permissioned Blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda).
*   **Data Structure:** Each VM instance has an entry containing:
    *   VM Instance ID
    *   Current Host ID
    *   Trust Score (initial value = 100)
    *   Attestation History (timestamped records of successful/failed attestation checks)
    *   Signed Endorsement from originating host.
*   **Access Control:** Only authorized hosts and a central “Trust Authority” can write to the DTL.  Reads are public to all participating hosts.

**2.  Continuous Attestation Agent (CAA):**

*   **Location:** Software component running within each VM instance.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Periodically (e.g., every 5 seconds) requests a "challenge" from the host's offload device security component.
    *   Generates a cryptographically signed response based on the challenge and a secure enclave within the VM.
    *   Submits the challenge-response pair to the host’s offload device security component for verification.
    *   The offload device verifies the signature and enclave integrity.
    *   The offload device posts the attestation result (pass/fail, timestamp) to the DTL for the specific VM instance.
    *   The CAA monitors the DTL for its VM instance and alerts the OS/hypervisor if the trust score falls below a threshold.

**3.  Dynamic Trust Scoring:**

*   **Algorithm:** Based on attestation history in the DTL.
    *   Successful attestation: +5 points.
    *   Failed attestation: -20 points.
    *   Time decay (trust score decreases by 1 point per hour).
    *   Host Compromise Detection (if a host reports consistently failing attestation checks, it is flagged as compromised, and all VMs running on that host have their trust scores significantly reduced).
*   **Thresholds:**
    *   Trust Score > 75: VM can migrate to any host.
    *   50 < Trust Score < 75: VM can migrate, but requires additional verification (e.g., a full integrity check of the VM disk image).
    *   Trust Score < 50: VM migration is blocked.

**4.  Live Migration Procedure:**

1.  **Initiation:** Host A (source) initiates a migration request to Host B (destination).
2.  **Trust Score Check:** Host B retrieves the Trust Score of the VM from the DTL.
3.  **Migration Decision:** Based on the Trust Score, Host B determines if migration is allowed and if any additional verification steps are needed.
4.  **Data Transfer:** VM data is transferred from Host A to Host B.
5.  **Attestation Re-Check:** Immediately after data transfer, Host B runs a final attestation check using the CAA.
6.  **Migration Completion:**  If the final attestation passes, the VM is activated on Host B.  Host A deactivates the VM. The DTL is updated with the new host ID.

**Pseudocode (CAA within VM):**

```
loop:
  challenge = request_challenge_from_host_offload_device()
  response = sign_challenge(challenge) // Using secure enclave
  verification_result = host_offload_device.verify_response(challenge, response)
  if verification_result == SUCCESS:
    dtl.post_attestation_result(SUCCESS, timestamp)
  else:
    dtl.post_attestation_result(FAILURE, timestamp)
  sleep(5 seconds)
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static attestation to a continuous, dynamic trust assessment.  The distributed ledger provides a tamper-proof record of trust, enabling informed decisions about VM migration and isolation.  This enhances security, improves resource utilization, and reduces the overhead associated with frequent re-attestation.
