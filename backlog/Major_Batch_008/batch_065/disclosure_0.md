## Dynamic Foveated Rendering with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend head-tracking-based rendering to incorporate real-time biofeedback (specifically, pupil dilation and electrodermal activity) to dynamically adjust rendering resolution *within* the field of view. This creates a hyper-realistic experience mimicking natural human vision, where only the area directly fixated upon is in full resolution, and peripheral vision is blurred/lower resolution.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensors:**
    *   High-resolution eye-tracking camera (integrated with existing head-tracking system). Must capture pupil diameter and gaze direction. Sampling rate: 60-120Hz.
    *   Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensor. Small contact sensors placed on fingertips or palm. Sampling rate: 30-60Hz.
    *   Existing head/motion tracking system (as per patent).
*   **Data Processing Unit (DPU):**
    *   Real-time signal processing for EDA and eye-tracking data.
    *   Algorithm to correlate EDA and pupil dilation with cognitive load and emotional state.
    *   Rendering parameter adjustment module.
*   **Rendering Engine:**
    *   Foveated rendering implementation.  Base resolution: 8K.
    *   Dynamic resolution scaling: Resolution adjusted within a radius defined by pupil diameter and cognitive load. Minimum resolution: 720p.
    *   Blur effect implementation for peripheral vision, dynamically adjusted based on distance from gaze point.
*   **Software Interface:**
    *   Calibration routine for eye-tracking and EDA sensors.
    *   User control panel to adjust sensitivity of biofeedback integration.
    *   Diagnostic tools for sensor data and rendering parameters.

**Pseudocode (Rendering Loop):**

```
//Initialization
calibrateEyeTracking()
calibrateEDA()

//Rendering Loop
while (applicationRunning) {
    headPose = getHeadPose()
    gazeDirection = getGazeDirection()
    pupilDiameter = getPupilDiameter()
    edaValue = getEDAValue()

    cognitiveLoad = calculateCognitiveLoad(edaValue, pupilDiameter) //Higher values = more focus

    foveaRadius = map(cognitiveLoad, 0, 1, 0.1, 0.3) // Radius of sharp focus area (0.1 - 0.3 meters)

    // Calculate view frustum based on head pose and fovea radius
    viewFrustum = calculateViewFrustum(headPose, foveaRadius)

    // Render scene with varying resolution/blur based on distance from gaze point
    for each pixel in viewFrustum {
        distance = calculateDistance(pixel, gazeDirection)
        if (distance < foveaRadius) {
            renderPixel(pixel, fullResolution)
        } else {
            blurLevel = map(distance, foveaRadius, maxDistance, 0, 1)
            renderPixel(pixel, reducedResolution, blurLevel)
        }
    }

    displayFrame()
}
```

**Innovation:** This isn’t simply about tracking where someone *looks*, but integrating their physiological state into the rendering process. By reacting to their cognitive load, the system can dynamically adjust rendering to focus resources on what’s truly important to the user, creating a more immersive and natural experience. It effectively creates a personalized 'cone of attention' within the virtual environment.
