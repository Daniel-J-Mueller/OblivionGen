## Adaptive Session Restriction Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the session key derivation to include a dynamic, propagating restriction layer, leveraging a distributed hash table (DHT) for enforcement and adaptation. This moves beyond static restrictions defined at key generation and introduces a system where restrictions can evolve *after* the key is issued, and be applied across multiple services without re-keying.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Derivation & Initial Restriction:**

*   Session key generation remains similar to the provided patent: `SessionKey = Hash(SecretCredential, InitialRestriction)`.
*   `InitialRestriction` is a structured data object defining baseline access limitations (e.g., permitted actions, resource scope).
*   A `RestrictionID` is generated alongside the `SessionKey` and `InitialRestriction`. This ID is a unique identifier for the restriction chain.

**2. Restriction Propagation Network (RPN):**

*   Utilize a DHT (e.g., Chord, Kademlia) to form the RPN. Each node in the RPN represents a restriction enforcement point.
*   The `RestrictionID` acts as the key in the DHT.
*   The value associated with the `RestrictionID` is a “Restriction Block”. This block contains:
    *   Current Restriction Data (effectively replacing the static `InitialRestriction`).
    *   A timestamp indicating the last update.
    *   A digital signature from an authorized authority (e.g., system administrator).
    *   A version number.

**3. Access Request Flow:**

1.  Client presents `SessionKey` and access request to a service.
2.  Service extracts `RestrictionID` from the `SessionKey` metadata (or derives it if necessary – details in implementation).
3.  Service queries the RPN using the `RestrictionID`.
4.  RPN returns the current `Restriction Block`.
5.  Service validates the `Restriction Block` signature and version.
6.  Service enforces the access based on the `Restriction Block` data.

**4. Dynamic Restriction Updates:**

1.  Authorized authority creates a new `Restriction Block` with updated restrictions.
2.  The authority digitally signs the new block and increments the version number.
3.  The authority publishes the new block to the RPN, associating it with the `RestrictionID`.
4.  The RPN propagates the update. 
5.  Services will eventually retrieve the updated restriction block (caching strategies are important – see Implementation).

**Pseudocode (Service Side – Access Validation):**

```
function validateAccess(sessionKey, accessRequest):
  restrictionID = extractRestrictionID(sessionKey)
  restrictionBlock = queryRPN(restrictionID)

  if restrictionBlock == null:
    // Handle RPN unavailability or invalid ID
    return false

  if !verifySignature(restrictionBlock, authorityPublicKey):
    // Handle invalid signature
    return false
    
  if restrictionBlock.version < lastKnownVersion:
    //Handle stale block
    lastKnownVersion = restrictionBlock.version

  if accessRequest.action not in restrictionBlock.permittedActions:
    return false

  // Additional checks based on restrictionBlock data (resource scope, time limits, etc.)

  return true
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   **Caching:** Services should aggressively cache `Restriction Blocks` to minimize RPN queries.  Implement a TTL (Time-To-Live) and invalidation mechanism.
*   **RPN Redundancy:** The DHT should be configured with sufficient redundancy to ensure high availability.
*   **Security:** Secure the RPN and protect against unauthorized updates to restriction blocks. Use TLS for all communication.
*   **Scalability:** Choose a DHT implementation that scales well to handle a large number of restriction IDs and queries.
