## Dynamic Policy Mirroring & Federation

**Concept:** Extend the existing policy enforcement by introducing dynamic mirroring and federation of access policies across multiple private networks. This aims to create a 'trust web' allowing for granular, context-aware access even when services span organizational boundaries.

**Specifications:**

**1. Policy Mirroring Agent (PMA):**

*   **Function:** Resides within each participating private network. Responsible for monitoring policy changes and selectively mirroring them to other PMAs based on pre-defined trust relationships and access scopes.
*   **Data Structure: Policy Mirroring Table (PMT)**
    *   `Source Network ID`: Unique identifier for the originating private network.
    *   `Destination Network ID`: Unique identifier for the destination private network.
    *   `Policy ID`: Identifier for the policy being mirrored.
    *   `Scope`: Defines the specific service or resource the policy applies to.
    *   `Priority`: Indicates the precedence of the mirrored policy.
    *   `Last Updated`: Timestamp of the last policy update.
*   **Algorithm: Policy Synchronization**
    1.  Monitor local policy changes.
    2.  For each change, identify relevant destination networks based on the `Scope` and pre-defined trust relationships.
    3.  Construct a policy synchronization message containing the `Policy ID`, `Scope`, `Priority`, and the policy definition.
    4.  Transmit the message to the designated PMAs in the destination networks.
    5.  Receive policy updates from other PMAs.
    6.  Resolve conflicts based on `Priority` and timestamp.

**2. Federated Policy Engine (FPE):**

*   **Function:** A central component within the external endpoint. Aggregates and evaluates policies from multiple PMAs, creating a unified access control decision.
*   **Data Structure: Global Policy Database (GPDB)**
    *   Stores all received policies from PMAs.
    *   Uses a graph database to represent relationships between policies and resources.
*   **Algorithm: Access Control Decision**
    1.  Receive a request to access a service.
    2.  Identify the relevant resources and services involved.
    3.  Query the GPDB for applicable policies from all PMAs.
    4.  Evaluate the policies based on the request context (user identity, source network, data sensitivity).
    5.  Combine the policy evaluations to generate an access control decision (allow, deny).

**3. Trust Management System (TMS):**

*   **Function:**  Allows network administrators to establish and manage trust relationships between private networks.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Mutual Authentication:**  Networks verify each other's identities using digital certificates or other secure mechanisms.
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Define which networks are authorized to share policies with each other.
    *   **Policy Governance:**  Establish rules for policy creation, modification, and revocation.
    *   **Auditing:**  Track policy changes and access control decisions.

**Pseudocode (FPE - Access Control Decision):**

```
FUNCTION evaluateAccess(request, user, sourceNetwork):
  relevantPolicies = SELECT policies FROM GlobalPolicyDatabase
    WHERE policy.scope == request.service AND
          policy.sourceNetwork == sourceNetwork

  accessDecision = ALLOW

  FOR EACH policy IN relevantPolicies:
    IF policy.condition(user, request) == FALSE:
      accessDecision = DENY
      BREAK

  RETURN accessDecision
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:** Implement a distributed architecture for the GPDB to handle a large number of policies.
*   **Security:** Encrypt policy data in transit and at rest.
*   **Real-time Synchronization:** Use a publish-subscribe mechanism to ensure policies are updated in real-time.
*   **Policy Versioning:** Maintain a history of policy changes to enable rollback and auditing.
