## Adaptive Authentication Provider Chaining with Reputation Scoring

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the idea of dynamic authentication provider selection, but instead of a single provider choice, it establishes a *chain* of authentication providers. This chain is built adaptively based on a ‘trust score’ assigned to both the requestor and the authentication providers themselves.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Reputation Engine:** This continuously assesses the trustworthiness of authentication providers and requestor systems.
    *   **Provider Trust Score:** Calculated based on uptime, security audits, successful authentication rates, and reports of compromised accounts linked to that provider. Data sourced from internal monitoring, third-party security feeds, and user reports.
    *   **Requestor Trust Score:** Calculated based on historical authentication success rates, IP reputation (threat intelligence feeds), device fingerprinting, and behavioral biometrics.
2.  **Chain Builder:**  Dynamically constructs an authentication chain based on trust scores.
    *   High Trust Requestor: Short chain – single strong authentication provider.
    *   Low Trust Requestor: Longer chain – multiple providers, starting with lower-friction options and escalating to more robust (but potentially intrusive) methods.
3.  **Adaptive Escalation:** The system monitors authentication success at each step in the chain. 
    *   Failure at a low-friction provider triggers escalation to the next provider in the chain.
    *   Repeated failures at multiple providers flag the request for human review.
4.  **Dynamic Chain Adjustment:**  The chain building algorithm isn’t static. It learns from successful/failed authentication attempts, adjusting provider order and chain length to optimize for both security and user experience.
5.  **Behavioral Drift Detection:**  Continual monitoring of user behavior during authentication (typing speed, mouse movements, etc.).  Significant deviations from established baselines trigger additional authentication challenges or flag the request for review.

**Pseudocode - Chain Builder Algorithm:**

```
function buildAuthenticationChain(requestorTrustScore, requestorCapabilities):
    // Define possible authentication providers with associated friction/security levels
    providers = [
        {name: "Passwordless Magic Link", friction: 1, security: 3},
        {name: "Social Login (Google/Facebook)", friction: 2, security: 4},
        {name: "SMS OTP", friction: 3, security: 5},
        {name: "Authenticator App (TOTP)", friction: 4, security: 6},
        {name: "Hardware Security Key (YubiKey)", friction: 5, security: 8}
    ]

    // Base chain length on requestor trust score
    if requestorTrustScore > 0.8:
        chainLength = 1
    else if requestorTrustScore > 0.5:
        chainLength = 2
    else:
        chainLength = 3

    // Filter providers based on requestor capabilities (e.g., device supports hardware keys)
    filteredProviders = filterProviders(providers, requestorCapabilities)

    // Rank providers by security score (descending)
    rankedProviders = sortProviders(filteredProviders, "security", descending)

    // Select top N providers for the chain
    selectedProviders = rankedProviders.slice(0, chainLength)

    return selectedProviders
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `RequestorProfile`:  Contains requestorTrustScore, requestorCapabilities (device info, biometrics), and historical authentication data.
*   `ProviderProfile`: Contains provider name, friction score, security score, uptime statistics, and security audit results.
*   `AuthenticationChain`:  Ordered list of ProviderProfile objects.



**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Real-time data feeds for threat intelligence and provider status.
*   Scalable data storage for requestor/provider profiles and authentication history.
*   Integration with existing identity providers and authentication protocols (OAuth, SAML, etc.).
*   Robust logging and monitoring for security and performance analysis.
