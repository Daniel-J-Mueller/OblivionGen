## Dynamic Data Sharding with Homomorphic Encryption

**Concept:** Extend the concept of client-side encryption by introducing dynamic data sharding *before* encryption and combining it with homomorphic encryption. This allows for distributed, privacy-preserving data processing *without* requiring a single entity to reconstruct the plaintext data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sharding Module (Client-Side):**

*   **Input:** Raw data (e.g., user profile information, financial transactions).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Splits the input data into ‘n’ shards. The shard size and number of shards are configurable.
    *   Applies a deterministic, pseudo-random function (PRF) to the data, keyed by a user-specific seed, to determine shard boundaries. This ensures consistent sharding across sessions.
    *   Assigns each shard to a different "availability zone" – could be distributed across different servers, or even different content delivery networks.
    *   Prepares metadata describing shard location and ordering (encrypted with a key known only to the client, or a distributed key management system).
*   **Output:**  ‘n’ data shards, metadata.

**2. Homomorphic Encryption Module (Client-Side):**

*   **Input:** Data shards.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Encrypts each data shard using a Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) scheme (e.g., BFV, CKKS). 
    *   Uses a unique encryption key for each shard, derived from a master secret and shard ID. This provides an additional layer of security.
*   **Output:** ‘n’ encrypted data shards.

**3. Distributed Storage:**

*   The encrypted data shards are distributed across multiple storage locations. No single location holds the complete, unencrypted data.

**4. Homomorphic Computation Module (Server-Side):**

*   **Input:** Encrypted data shards.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Allows for computations *on the encrypted data* without decryption. For example, statistical analysis, data aggregation, or pattern matching.
    *   Utilizes homomorphic properties of the chosen FHE scheme.
    *   The server does *not* have access to the decryption keys.
*   **Output:** Encrypted results.

**5. Result Reconstruction Module (Client-Side):**

*   **Input:** Encrypted results, shard keys.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Retrieves the encrypted results.
    *   Decrypts the results using the appropriate shard keys.
*   **Output:** Plaintext results.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side – Sharding & Encryption):**

```
function shardAndEncrypt(data, userSeed):
    n = configuration.numShards // Configurable
    shardSize = length(data) / n
    shards = []
    for i in range(n):
        start = i * shardSize
        end = (i + 1) * shardSize
        shard = data[start:end]
        shardKey = deriveKey(userSeed, i) //Key derivation function
        encryptedShard = encrypt(shard, shardKey) //FHE Encryption
        shards.append(encryptedShard)
    metadata = createMetadata(shards, userSeed)
    return shards, metadata
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   Key management is critical. Secure key derivation and storage are essential.
*   The choice of FHE scheme impacts performance and security.
*   Metadata should be encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
*   Consider using a multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for increased security.
