**Dynamic Resource Path Masking & Obfuscation**

**Concept:** Extend the resource path access control system to include dynamic masking and obfuscation of resource paths *before* they are even stored or indexed. This isn't just about *restricting* access to known paths, but about making the paths themselves harder to discover and target in the first place.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Path Obfuscation Service (POS).  This service runs *during* resource ingestion and indexing.
*   **Input:** Raw resource path (string).  User/group authorization data (ACL).
*   **Process:**
    1.  POS receives the raw resource path and authorization data.
    2.  Based on the user/group’s authorization level, POS applies a transformation to the raw path. Transformations include:
        *   **Substitution:** Replace segments of the path with randomly generated identifiers (UUIDs, hashes). A mapping table is maintained to translate these identifiers back to the original segments.
        *   **Shuffling:** Reorder segments of the path (where logically permissible).
        *   **Encryption:** Encrypt path segments with a key derived from the user/group’s authorization data.
        *   **Redirection:** Create symbolic links or redirection rules to obscure the actual path location.
    3.  The transformed path is used for indexing and storage. The mapping table (or redirection rules) is stored securely, separate from the search index.
    4.  During search query processing, POS intercepts the query, translates the obscured paths back to the original paths (using the mapping table), performs the search, and then returns the results.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `MappingTable`:  A key-value store where:
        *   Key: Obscured path segment.
        *   Value: Original path segment.
    *   `RedirectionRules`:  A list of redirection rules specifying the mapping between obscured paths and original paths.
*   **API:**
    *   `ObfuscatePath(rawPath, userAuthData)`: Returns the obfuscated path.
    *   `DeobfuscatePath(obscuredPath, userAuthData)`: Returns the original path.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// During Resource Ingestion
function IngestResource(resourcePath, userAuthData):
    obscuredPath = ObfuscatePath(resourcePath, userAuthData)
    IndexResource(obscuredPath)
    StoreMapping(obscuredPath, resourcePath, userAuthData)

// During Search
function ProcessSearchQuery(query, userAuthData):
    translatedQuery = TranslateQuery(query, userAuthData) // Replace obscured paths in the query
    searchResults = SearchIndex(translatedQuery)
    return searchResults

function TranslateQuery(query, userAuthData):
    // Iterate through query terms
    for each term in query:
        if term is an obscured path:
            originalPath = DeobfuscatePath(term, userAuthData)
            Replace term with originalPath
    return translatedQuery
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Obfuscation:**  Change the obfuscation scheme periodically to further complicate path discovery.
*   **Layered Obfuscation:** Combine multiple obfuscation techniques for stronger protection.
*   **Integration with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems:** Monitor access patterns to detect potential security breaches.
