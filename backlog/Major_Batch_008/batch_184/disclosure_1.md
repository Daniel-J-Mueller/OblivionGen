## Dynamic Script Assembly with Predictive Chunking

**Concept:** Extend the existing script chunking service to not only assemble pre-compiled chunks but to *predict* future chunk needs based on user interaction and proactively compile those chunks in the background. This creates a seamless user experience, minimizing perceived latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Interaction Tracking Module:**

*   **Input:** User events (clicks, scrolls, form inputs, network requests, mouse movements).
*   **Process:** Analyze user interaction data to identify likely execution paths within the application’s scripts. Utilize a Markov chain or similar probabilistic model to predict the next functions or code blocks likely to be executed.
*   **Output:**  A prioritized list of script sections (functions, blocks) predicted to be executed within a short timeframe (e.g., the next 2-5 seconds).

**2. Predictive Chunking Service:**

*   **Input:** Prioritized list from the Interaction Tracking Module. Existing chunk database.
*   **Process:**
    *   For each item in the prioritized list:
        *   Check if a pre-compiled chunk exists in the database.
        *   If not, divide the script section into smaller portions.
        *   Compile these portions into a new chunk.
        *   Store the new chunk and its hash in the database.
    *   Prioritize compilation based on prediction confidence (higher confidence = higher priority) and chunk size (smaller chunks = faster compilation).
*   **Output:** Newly compiled chunks. Updated chunk database.

**3. Assembly & Delivery Module:**

*   **Input:** Rendering engine requests. Chunk database. Predictive Chunking Service output.
*   **Process:**
    *   When the rendering engine requests a script section:
        *   Check if a pre-compiled chunk exists.
        *   If so, deliver the chunk immediately.
        *   If not, check the Predictive Chunking Service for a recently compiled chunk. Deliver if found.
        *   If still not found, compile the required section as before.
    *   Continuously monitor Predictive Chunking Service output and pre-load likely chunks into the rendering engine’s cache.
*   **Output:** Assembled and delivered script sections to the rendering engine.

**Pseudocode (Assembly & Delivery Module):**

```
function deliverScriptSection(request):
    chunk = getChunkFromDatabase(request.sectionId)
    if chunk != null:
        return chunk // Serve from cache
    else:
        predictedChunk = getPredictedChunk(request.sectionId)
        if predictedChunk != null:
            return predictedChunk // Serve from predictive compilation
        else:
            chunk = compileScriptSection(request.sectionId)
            storeChunkInDatabase(chunk)
            return chunk
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Prediction Model:** Markov Chain or similar, mapping user interactions to script section probabilities.
*   **Chunk Database:** Key-value store mapping script section IDs to compiled chunks and hashes.
*   **Pending Compilation Queue:** A list of script sections currently being compiled.
*   **Chunk Metadata:** Include information such as compilation timestamp, dependencies, and predicted usage probabilities.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved user experience.
*   Optimized resource utilization (compiling only necessary sections).
*   Adaptive compilation based on user behavior.
*   Improved application responsiveness.
