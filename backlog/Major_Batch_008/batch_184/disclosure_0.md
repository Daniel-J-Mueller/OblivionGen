## Dynamic Content Echo with Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Extend the voice-sharing functionality to incorporate real-time spatial audio mirroring, creating a shared "sonic environment" between devices.  Instead of simply *sending* content metadata and a link, the originating device actively *recreates* the audio experience on the recipient device, adjusting for perceived distance and direction.

**Specs:**

*   **Device Roles:** Originator (device initiating share) & Recipient (device receiving share).
*   **Audio Capture:** Originator device captures ambient audio *in addition* to content audio (music, video sound, etc.) using a multi-microphone array.  This captures room acoustics and background noise.
*   **Spatial Audio Processing:**
    *   Originator device performs real-time spatial audio processing on the captured audio mix. This determines the direction and distance of sound sources (content and ambient) relative to the device. Head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) are applied.
    *   Processed audio data, *along with content metadata,* is transmitted to the Recipient.  The transmission rate is dynamically adjusted based on network conditions.
*   **Recipient Playback:**
    *   Recipient device uses its own speaker array or headphones to recreate the spatial audio experience.
    *   HRTFs specific to the Recipient’s device and headphone/speaker configuration are applied.
    *   A "Virtual Distance" parameter allows the user to adjust the perceived distance between themselves and the origin of the shared audio.  This can be a simple slider in the UI.
*   **Content Synchronization:**  The Recipient device automatically begins playing the shared content (if applicable) at the correct offset, ensuring audio and video are synchronized.
*   **UI Integration:**
    *   A visual representation of the “Virtual Distance” parameter.
    *   A real-time audio level meter showing the mixed audio signal being transmitted.
    *   Option to enable/disable ambient audio mirroring.
*   **Data Transmission Protocol:**  A UDP-based protocol with forward error correction to minimize latency and packet loss.

**Pseudocode (Originator Device):**

```
// Initialize audio capture and processing components
audio_capture = new AudioCapture()
spatial_processor = new SpatialProcessor()
network_sender = new NetworkSender()

while (true) {
  audio_data = audio_capture.capture() // Capture ambient + content audio
  spatial_data = spatial_processor.process(audio_data) // Apply HRTFs, determine spatial characteristics
  metadata = extract_content_metadata()
  payload = create_payload(metadata, spatial_data)
  network_sender.send(payload)
}
```

**Pseudocode (Recipient Device):**

```
// Initialize audio playback and processing components
network_receiver = new NetworkReceiver()
spatial_renderer = new SpatialRenderer()
audio_player = new AudioPlayer()

while (true) {
  payload = network_receiver.receive()
  metadata = extract_metadata(payload)
  spatial_data = extract_spatial_data(payload)

  // Play content (if applicable)
  if (metadata.content_type == "music") {
    audio_player.play(metadata.content_url)
  }

  // Render spatial audio
  rendered_audio = spatial_renderer.render(spatial_data)
  audio_output.play(rendered_audio)
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-Recipient Support:** Broadcast spatial audio to multiple recipients simultaneously.
*   **Dynamic HRTF Selection:** Automatically select the best HRTF for each recipient based on their profile and device.
*   **Ambient Audio Filtering:**  Filter out unwanted noise from the ambient audio stream.
*   **Visual Overlay:** Display a 3D visual representation of the shared audio environment on the recipient’s device.
