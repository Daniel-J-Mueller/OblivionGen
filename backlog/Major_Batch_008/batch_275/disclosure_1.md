## Miniature Spectrometer Integration

**Concept:** Integrate a miniature spectrometer directly into the camera assembly, leveraging the existing redistribution layers for signal routing and power delivery. This transforms the camera from purely imaging to multi-spectral analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Spectrometer Dimensions:** Target < 5mm x 5mm x 2mm. Micro-optics and MEMS diffraction grating crucial for miniaturization.
*   **Integration Point:** Replace a portion of the camera component subassembly with the spectrometer module. Position spectrometer so the captured light is orthogonal to the main imaging sensor’s optical path.
*   **Optical Path:** Utilize a beamsplitter within the lens module to divert a small percentage of incoming light to the spectrometer’s input aperture. This minimizes impact on image quality.
*   **Redistribution Layer Modification:** Expand the existing redistribution layers to include dedicated interconnects for spectrometer’s digital signal output, power lines, and control signals. Trace impedance matching critical for high-speed data transfer.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Integrate a miniature photodiode array or CMOS sensor within the spectrometer module to capture the dispersed light. This data is then digitized within the module.
*   **Data Fusion:** Develop algorithms to fuse spectral data with image data. Overlay spectral information onto the image, or create separate spectral maps.
*   **Power Management:** Implement a power gating scheme to selectively power the spectrometer module only when needed, minimizing power consumption.
*   **Calibration:** Incorporate on-chip calibration routines to compensate for spectrometer’s spectral response variations and temperature drift.
*   **Material Considerations:** Use materials with high transmission in the spectral range of interest for the spectrometer’s optical components.
*   **Pseudocode (Data Acquisition):**

    }

*   **Potential Applications:** Environmental sensing (pollution, agriculture), material identification (food safety, medical diagnostics), advanced imaging (hyperspectral imaging, multi-spectral photography).
