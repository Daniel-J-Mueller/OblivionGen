## Automated Database 'Health Forecast' System

**Concept:** Extend the dependency monitoring system to predict potential database performance bottlenecks or failures *before* they occur, creating a 'health forecast' for each database. This isn't about *reacting* to issues, but anticipating them.

**Specs:**

1.  **Baseline Performance Capture:** Implement a system to automatically capture baseline performance metrics for each database – CPU usage, disk I/O, query execution times, connection counts – over a rolling window (e.g., 28 days).  This data is stored in a time-series database.

2.  **Dependency-Aware Anomaly Detection:** Leverage the dependency graph generated by the existing system to create a *correlated* anomaly detection model. Instead of treating each database in isolation, analyze how anomalies in one database *propagate* through the dependency graph.  For example, a slow query in database A (a producer) should trigger increased scrutiny of databases B, C, and D (consumers) that depend on it.

3.  **Predictive Modeling Layer:**  Employ machine learning models (e.g., time-series forecasting – ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict future performance metrics for each database. The models are trained on the historical performance data *and* the dependency graph information.  Key input features:

    *   Historical performance metrics (CPU, I/O, query times)
    *   Dependency graph structure (who depends on whom)
    *   Performance metrics of dependent databases
    *   Recent changes to database schemas or code deployments
    *   Seasonal patterns (e.g., increased load during month-end processing)

4.  **'Health Score' Generation:** Calculate a 'health score' for each database based on the predicted performance metrics. The score should reflect the probability of a future performance degradation or failure. Consider weighting factors based on the criticality of the database and the impact of a failure. A simple example:

    *   Predicted query execution time > threshold: -5 points
    *   Predicted CPU utilization > 90%: -10 points
    *   Dependency on a database with a low health score: -5 points
    *   Stable performance & low load: +10 points

5.  **Proactive Alerting & Remediation:**

    *   Alert operators when a database health score falls below a certain threshold.
    *   Automatically trigger remediation actions:
        *   Scale up database resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O).
        *   Restart slow-running queries.
        *   Cache frequently accessed data.
        *   Temporarily redirect traffic to a read-only replica.

6.  **GUI Integration:** Extend the existing GUI to display:

    *   Database health scores.
    *   Predicted performance metrics (e.g., CPU utilization, query execution time).
    *   Potential bottlenecks (e.g., slow queries, high I/O).
    *   Recommended remediation actions.
    *   'What-if' analysis: Allow operators to simulate the impact of changes to database configurations or workloads on predicted performance.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Health Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateHealthScore(database):
  score = 100  // Base score

  // Check predicted metrics
  if predictedQueryTime(database) > threshold:
    score -= 20
  if predictedCPUUtilization(database) > 90:
    score -= 15

  // Check dependencies
  for dependentDatabase in getDependentDatabases(database):
    if healthScore(dependentDatabase) < 50:
      score -= 10

  // Apply seasonality adjustment
  score += seasonalAdjustment(database)

  return score
```

This allows the system to move beyond simply *knowing* about dependencies to *anticipating* problems before they impact users. The correlation and dependency-aware anomaly detection, combined with predictive modeling, create a proactive system capable of optimizing database performance and availability.
