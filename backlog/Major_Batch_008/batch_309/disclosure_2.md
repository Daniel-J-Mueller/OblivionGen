## Dynamic Contextual Action Suggestions via Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the text recognition functionality to proactively suggest actions *before* the user explicitly confirms intent, using haptic feedback to convey options directly through the device. This moves beyond simply reacting to recognized text to anticipating user needs based on learned behavior and immediate context.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Haptic Engine:**  Advanced, multi-point haptic engine capable of generating nuanced vibrations across the device surface.  Resolution: minimum 200Hz update rate, capable of distinct patterns.  Coverage: Full surface of device grip area.
*   **Location Services:**  High-accuracy GPS, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth beacon integration.
*   **Camera:**  Existing camera module.  Focus speed: < 200ms.
*   **Accelerometer/Gyroscope:**  Existing modules for device orientation detection.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **OCR Module:** Existing text recognition capability.  Output: recognized text string, confidence level.
*   **Contextual Analysis Engine:**
    *   Input:  OCR output, location data, time of day, user calendar (with permission), recent app usage, historical user action data (see 'User Profile' below).
    *   Processing:  Rule-based system combined with a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., decision tree or simple neural network).  Model trained on user interaction data.
    *   Output: Ranked list of potential actions, confidence scores for each action.
*   **Haptic Feedback Manager:**
    *   Input: Ranked action list from Contextual Analysis Engine.
    *   Processing: Maps actions to distinct haptic patterns.  Pattern complexity and intensity proportional to action confidence.  Example mappings:
        *   Phone Number: Rapid, localized vibration mimicking a dial tone.
        *   URL: Slow, sweeping vibration pattern.
        *   Address: Pulsating vibration pattern.
        *   Email: Short, repeating vibration sequence.
    *   Output: Haptic commands to haptic engine.
*   **User Profile:**  Data structure storing user preferences and historical action data.  Includes:
    *   Frequency of actions triggered for specific text types (e.g., dialing phone numbers, navigating to URLs).
    *   Preferred applications for each text type.
    *   Contextual preferences (e.g., preferred navigation app when recognizing an address near work).
    *   Haptic Sensitivity preference (to allow user to tune the vibration intensity).

**3. Workflow:**

1.  User points device camera at text.
2.  OCR Module recognizes text.
3.  Contextual Analysis Engine determines potential actions based on recognized text, location, time, and User Profile.
4.  Haptic Feedback Manager generates appropriate haptic patterns corresponding to the top 3-5 actions.  Actions are presented *before* any visual confirmation prompt.
5.  User intuitively selects an action by:
    *   Squeezing the device to confirm the *first* haptic action.
    *   Double-tapping the device to cycle through the haptic actions.
    *   Swiping across the device to dismiss all suggestions.
6.  Selected action is executed automatically.

**4. Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Manager):**

```
function generate_haptic_feedback(action_list):
  for action in action_list[0:3]: // Top 3 actions
    haptic_pattern = get_haptic_pattern(action)
    intensity = action.confidence_score * 0.8 + 0.2 // Scale to 0-1
    play_haptic_pattern(haptic_pattern, intensity)
    wait(200ms) // Short delay between patterns

function get_haptic_pattern(action):
  if action.text_type == "phone_number":
    return "dial_tone"
  elif action.text_type == "url":
    return "sweep"
  elif action.text_type == "address":
    return "pulse"
  elif action.text_type == "email":
    return "repeat"
  else:
    return "default" // Simple buzz
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond passive text recognition and provides a proactive, intuitive interface through haptic feedback. It leverages contextual awareness and machine learning to anticipate user needs, reducing the need for explicit confirmation prompts and streamlining the interaction process. This aims to make the text recognition function nearly invisible, seamlessly integrating it into the user's workflow.
