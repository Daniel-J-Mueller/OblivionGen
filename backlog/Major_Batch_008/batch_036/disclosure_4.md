**Acoustic Holography for Dynamic Room Correction**

**Concept:** Extend the room acoustic modeling beyond static impulse response generation to create a dynamic, holographic acoustic correction system. This system will actively shape the sound field within a room to optimize for multiple listeners simultaneously, account for moving sound sources, and even correct for temporary obstructions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Array:** A dense array of miniature, low-latency microphones (minimum 64, optimally 256+) distributed throughout the listening space. These microphones will capture a high-resolution snapshot of the current sound field.  Microphone selection prioritizes phase coherence and minimal coloration.

2.  **Computational Core:** A high-performance computing unit (GPU-accelerated preferred) dedicated to real-time acoustic field reconstruction and manipulation. Must be capable of processing data from all microphones with sub-10ms latency.

3.  **Acoustic Actuator Network:** An array of digitally controlled acoustic actuators (e.g., phased array of small speakers, MEMS-based acoustic emitters) strategically positioned within the room. Actuator density should match or exceed microphone density for optimal control.  Individual actuators will have a bandwidth of at least 20kHz.

4.  **Holographic Reconstruction Algorithm:**
    *   **Phase Extraction:** Algorithm to derive the phase information of incoming sound waves from the microphone array data. Utilize beamforming techniques and deconvolution algorithms to reduce noise and enhance spatial resolution.
    *   **Wavefront Reconstruction:** Algorithm to reconstruct the original wavefront of the sound source(s) based on the extracted phase information. This will involve complex interpolation and extrapolation techniques.
    *   **Target Wavefront Design:** Algorithm to design a target wavefront that optimizes the sound field for specific listening positions and desired acoustic characteristics (e.g., flat frequency response, minimized reflections).
    *   **Actuator Control Signal Generation:** Algorithm to calculate the appropriate control signals for each actuator to generate the target wavefront. This will involve inverse beamforming and optimization techniques.
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        FOR each microphone in array:
            capture audio signal
        END FOR
        
        FOR each microphone in array:
            calculate phase delay
        END FOR
        
        FOR each actuator in array:
            calculate control signal based on desired wavefront and phase delay
        END FOR
        
        FOR each actuator in array:
            emit control signal
        END FOR
        ```

5.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**
    *   Real-time monitoring of sound field using the microphone array.
    *   Continuous adjustment of actuator control signals to compensate for changes in the sound field (e.g., moving sound sources, listener movements, temporary obstructions).
    *   Adaptive filtering techniques to reduce noise and improve stability.

6.  **Multi-Listener Optimization:**
    *   Algorithm to optimize the sound field for multiple listeners simultaneously.
    *   Prioritize listener positions and desired acoustic characteristics based on user preferences.
    *   Implement beam steering and wavefront shaping techniques to direct sound energy towards each listener.

7.  **Obstruction Correction:**
    *   Utilize a depth-sensing camera (e.g., LiDAR, Time-of-Flight) to detect temporary obstructions in the sound field.
    *   Adjust actuator control signals to redirect sound around the obstruction or compensate for its acoustic shadow.
    *   Implement wave diffraction and scattering models to predict the acoustic behavior of the obstruction.

8.  **Software Interface:**
    *   User-friendly software interface for configuring the system, setting listener preferences, and monitoring the sound field.
    *   Real-time visualization of the sound field using 3D graphics.
    *   Automated calibration routines to optimize the system for different room geometries and acoustic conditions.
