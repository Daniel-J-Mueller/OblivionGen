**Adaptive Acoustic Mapping with Drone Swarms**

**Concept:** Extend the principles of beamforming and spatial audio capture beyond static microphone arrays. Deploy a swarm of miniature drones, each equipped with a microphone and wireless communication, to create a dynamically reconfigurable, volumetric acoustic sensor. This allows for real-time, highly detailed acoustic mapping of environments, especially complex or inaccessible spaces.

**Specifications:**

*   **Drone Hardware:**
    *   Size: <15cm diameter.
    *   Weight: <250g (FAA Part 107 compliant).
    *   Microphone: High-sensitivity MEMS microphone with a frequency response of 20Hz-20kHz.
    *   Communication: 802.11ax Wi-Fi 6 for low-latency, high-bandwidth data transfer.
    *   Power: Lithium Polymer battery, 20-minute flight time.
    *   Positioning: GPS, IMU, and onboard visual odometry for precise spatial localization.
    *   Processing: Embedded ARM Cortex-A72 processor for basic signal processing and communication.
*   **Ground Station:**
    *   High-performance computing server for central processing and control.
    *   Real-time operating system (RTOS) for deterministic performance.
    *   Advanced beamforming algorithms optimized for distributed sensor networks.
    *   User interface for visualization and control.
*   **Swarm Control:**
    *   Decentralized swarm intelligence algorithms for self-organization and collision avoidance.
    *   Dynamic task allocation based on acoustic source localization.
    *   Adaptive drone density control based on signal strength and environmental factors.
*   **Beamforming Algorithm:**
    *   Convex optimization-based beamforming, similar to the patent, but extended to a 3D volumetric grid.
    *   Adaptive weighting coefficients determined in real-time based on drone positions and acoustic characteristics.
    *   Spatial filtering to suppress noise and reverberation.
*   **Acoustic Mapping Output:**
    *   3D volumetric acoustic map with real-time updates.
    *   Source localization and tracking.
    *   Acoustic event detection and classification.
    *   Augmented reality integration for visualizing acoustic information.

**Pseudocode (Beamforming Update):**

```
// For each drone in the swarm:
drone_position = get_drone_position()
mic_signal = get_microphone_signal()

// Calculate distance to potential sound source
distance = calculate_distance(drone_position, source_position)

// Calculate weighting coefficient
weight = calculate_weight(distance, frequency, drone_position) // Convex optimization implemented here

// Apply weight to microphone signal
weighted_signal = mic_signal * weight

// Transmit weighted signal to ground station

// Ground Station:
// Receive weighted signals from all drones
// Sum weighted signals to form the beamformed output
beamformed_output = sum(weighted_signals)
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond static arrays to enable dynamic, volumetric acoustic mapping with real-time adaptation. Provides significantly improved spatial resolution and flexibility compared to traditional beamforming techniques. Could be used for applications such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue, structural health monitoring, and immersive audio experiences.
