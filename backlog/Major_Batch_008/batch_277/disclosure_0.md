## Adaptive Haptic Notification System - 'Feel the Location'

**Concept:** Expand beyond visual notifications on a locked screen to include localized haptic feedback, creating a richer and more intuitive understanding of surroundings. Rather than simply vibrating, the device will employ a dense array of micro-actuators to simulate directional cues and environmental textures.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Minimum 64x64 array of micro-actuators embedded beneath the device’s rear surface (or a dedicated 'feel strip' on the edge). Each actuator capable of independent control of intensity and frequency.
*   **Location Data Integration:** Real-time integration with location services (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, Bluetooth beacons).
*   **Environmental Mapping:** Database of environmental 'textures' associated with points of interest (e.g., 'brick' texture for a building, 'water ripple' for a waterfront, 'grass' for a park, 'busy street' - chaotic vibration patterns).  These textures are crowd-sourced and dynamically updated.
*   **Directional Cueing:** Utilizing the actuator array, the device provides directional cues towards points of interest. Intensity of vibration increases with proximity.
*   **Behavioral Learning Module:** AI module learns user habits and preferences to prioritize haptic notifications.  Example: If the user frequently visits a coffee shop, a subtle ‘coffee bean’ texture and directional cue is provided when nearby.
*   **Contextual Haptic Signals:** Notifications tied to social connections. Example:  If a friend is nearby, a unique haptic signature associated with that friend is triggered. (User-definable.)
*   **API for App Integration:**  Developers can create custom haptic experiences within their apps.  Games, AR applications, etc.

**Pseudocode (Notification Trigger):**

```
function handleLocationUpdate(locationData) {
  // 1. Determine nearby Points of Interest (POIs)
  nearbyPOIs = getNearbyPOIs(locationData);

  // 2. Filter POIs based on user preferences and behavioral learning
  filteredPOIs = filterPOIs(nearbyPOIs, userPreferences, learnedHabits);

  // 3. For each filtered POI:
  for each POI in filteredPOIs:
    // 4. Retrieve POI's haptic texture and directional data
    hapticTexture = getHapticTexture(POI);
    direction = calculateDirection(locationData, POI.location);

    // 5. Activate actuators based on texture and direction
    activateActuators(hapticTexture, direction, intensity);

    // 6. If social connection is nearby:
    if (POI.isSocialConnection):
      activateSocialSignature(user.friend.signature);
}

function activateActuators(texture, direction, intensity) {
  // Map texture to actuator array
  actuatorPattern = mapTexture(texture);

  // Adjust actuator intensity based on distance and user preference
  adjustedIntensity = calculateIntensity(distance, userPreference);

  // Apply pattern and intensity to actuator array
  for each actuator in actuatorArray:
    actuator.activate(actuatorPattern[actuator.position], adjustedIntensity);
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-density micro-actuator array
*   Dedicated haptic driver chip
*   Low-power sensor suite for accurate location tracking
*   Increased battery capacity (haptic feedback is energy intensive)
