## Adaptive Acoustic Environment Profiling

**Concept:** The patent describes verifying audio output. This inspires a system for *proactively* adapting the acoustic environment *before* audio playback, tailored to both the content *and* the listener’s preferences/hearing profile. It moves beyond simple verification to predictive acoustic shaping.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array (MMA):** Integrated into the playback device (speaker, headphones) *and* potentially a separate, room-scanning device. Minimum 8 microphones, spatially distributed.
*   **Acoustic Actuators:**  An array of small, directional speakers/vibrators embedded within the playback device *and* potentially room-mounted (e.g., sound panels with integrated actuators).  These aren’t for primary sound output, but for localized acoustic adjustments.
*   **Real-Time Processing Unit:** Dedicated processor within the playback device to handle audio analysis and actuator control.
*   **User Profile Storage:** Secure storage (local or cloud-based) to store user hearing profiles, preferences, and acoustic environment data.

**2. Software/Algorithms:**

*   **Acoustic Scene Analysis:** Algorithms to analyze the MMA data and identify the room's acoustic characteristics (reverberation time, reflections, noise floor, etc.). Employ frequency-domain decomposition techniques.
*   **Hearing Profile Acquisition:** Capture user hearing data via audiometric tests (integrated app or data import).  Alternatively, use machine learning to infer hearing profile from listening history & preferences.
*   **Content Analysis:** Analyze the audio content (music, speech, etc.) to identify key acoustic features (frequency range, dynamic range, spatial cues).
*   **Acoustic Shaping Algorithm:** This is the core. It uses the acoustic scene analysis, hearing profile, and content analysis to generate a control signal for the acoustic actuators.
    *   **Objective:** Minimize unwanted reflections, compensate for hearing loss, enhance spatial cues, and tailor the acoustic environment to the content.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Active Noise Cancellation (ANC):** Standard ANC for broad-spectrum noise.
        *   **Adaptive Beamforming:** Focus sound towards the listener, minimizing reflections from walls.
        *   **Frequency-Dependent Equalization:** Compensate for hearing loss and room acoustics.
        *   **Spatial Augmentation:**  Enhance or create spatial cues using the actuators to simulate a larger soundstage.
        *   **Psychoacoustic Modeling:**  Apply principles of psychoacoustics to optimize the acoustic experience, e.g., masking unwanted noise.
*   **Machine Learning Component:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on user feedback to optimize the acoustic shaping algorithm over time. The RNN learns to predict the best acoustic settings for different content and environments.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Scan:** When the system is first used, perform a room scan to capture the acoustic environment.
2.  **Hearing Profile Acquisition:** Capture or import the user’s hearing profile.
3.  **Content Analysis:** Analyze the audio content.
4.  **Acoustic Shaping:** The Acoustic Shaping Algorithm generates control signals for the actuators.
5.  **Continuous Adaptation:** The system continuously monitors the acoustic environment and adapts the actuator control signals in real-time.
6.  **User Feedback:** Collect user feedback to refine the machine learning model.

**4. Pseudocode (Simplified Acoustic Shaping Algorithm):**

```
function generate_actuator_controls(room_profile, hearing_profile, content_profile):
    // 1. Calculate target frequency response based on hearing profile
    target_response = calculate_target_response(hearing_profile)

    // 2. Calculate room impulse response
    room_impulse_response = calculate_room_impulse_response(room_profile)

    // 3. Calculate equalization filter to compensate for room acoustics
    equalization_filter = calculate_equalization_filter(target_response, room_impulse_response)

    // 4. Calculate spatial augmentation parameters
    spatial_parameters = calculate_spatial_parameters(content_profile)

    // 5. Generate actuator control signals
    actuator_signals = generate_actuator_signals(equalization_filter, spatial_parameters)

    return actuator_signals
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-end audio systems
*   Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality
*   Gaming
*   Accessibility for people with hearing loss
*   Automotive audio systems.
