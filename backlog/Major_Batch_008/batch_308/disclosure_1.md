## Dynamic Content Isolation via Predictive Sandboxing

**Concept:** Extend the existing threat inspection framework to proactively isolate potentially malicious content *before* it’s fully rendered or executed, leveraging predictive analysis of content characteristics.  Instead of simply inspecting content after a request, predict risk and create a temporary, isolated environment *during* the content delivery process.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Sandbox Manager (PSM) – a module integrated with the existing threat detection system.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Content stream (HTML, JavaScript, images, etc.) as it's being downloaded.
    *   Content metadata (URL, source domain, content type, file size).
    *   User context (browser version, installed plugins, security settings).
    *   Real-time threat intelligence feeds.
*   **Risk Prediction Engine:**
    *   Utilizes machine learning models trained on historical threat data.
    *   Analyzes content characteristics in real-time (e.g., JavaScript obfuscation, unusual API calls, suspicious redirects).
    *   Assigns a dynamic risk score to each content element.
*   **Adaptive Sandboxing:**
    *   Based on the risk score, the PSM determines whether to:
        *   Allow content to render normally.
        *   Render content in a restricted mode (e.g., disable JavaScript, block external resources).
        *   Create a full sandbox environment (e.g., a virtual machine or container).
    *   Sandboxing level is adjusted dynamically based on content behavior within the isolated environment.
*   **Content Remapping & Injection:**
    *   The PSM intercepts content elements and remaps them to the appropriate rendering context (normal, restricted, sandboxed).
    *   Injects necessary code (e.g., JavaScript shims, security policies) to enforce the chosen rendering context.
*   **Performance Optimization:**
    *   Caching of sandboxed content to reduce overhead for frequently accessed resources.
    *   Prioritization of sandboxing based on risk score and content criticality.
    *   Asynchronous sandboxing to minimize impact on browser responsiveness.
* **Communication Protocol:** PSM communicates with the browser via a custom, secure protocol that enables granular control over content rendering.

**Pseudocode (PSM Core Logic):**

```
function processContentElement(element, metadata, userContext):
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(element, metadata, userContext)

  if riskScore < lowThreshold:
    renderContext = "normal"
  else if riskScore < mediumThreshold:
    renderContext = "restricted"
  else:
    renderContext = "sandboxed"

  if renderContext == "sandboxed":
    sandboxedContent = createSandboxedContent(element)
    injectSecurityPolicies(sandboxedContent)
  else:
    sandboxedContent = element

  return sandboxedContent
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple inspection by *proactively* shaping the rendering environment based on predicted risk. It creates a dynamic, adaptive security layer that minimizes the potential impact of malicious content. It aims to reduce the “time to detect” window by addressing threats *before* they can fully execute.
