## Adaptive Workspace Partitioning with Dynamic Barriers

**Concept:** Extend the time-of-flight localization system to not just *detect* proximity of personnel, but to *actively reconfigure* the workspace using dynamically adjustable physical barriers to ensure safe separation from automated equipment. This moves beyond simple inhibition of equipment and towards proactive spatial management.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Time-of-Flight Localization System:** As described in the provided patent - multiple reference radios, portable radios (worn by personnel), control logic.
*   **Dynamic Barrier Modules:** Modular, mobile physical barriers (e.g., lightweight, telescoping posts with transparent/semi-transparent screens, or inflatable structures). Each module contains:
    *   Micro-actuators (linear actuators, pneumatic/hydraulic systems) for extension/retraction/re-orientation.
    *   Wireless communication module (compatible with central control logic).
    *   Local power supply (battery or wired).
    *   Embedded IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for self-orientation & stability monitoring.
*   **Central Control Logic:** Enhanced version of the existing system, with added features:
    *   Workspace Map: Digital representation of the workspace, including fixed obstacles, equipment locations, and dynamic barrier module positions.
    *   Path Planning Algorithm:  Calculates optimal barrier configurations based on personnel location, equipment paths, and safety parameters.
    *   Communication Interface:  Wireless communication with barrier modules.
    *   Real-time Safety Override: Manual override capability for emergency situations.

**2. Software/Control Logic Flow:**

```pseudocode
// Main Loop - Executes continuously

while (true) {

  // 1. Localization - Existing ToF System
  personnelLocations = TimeOfFlightLocalization();

  // 2. Workspace Analysis
  // Calculate intersecting areas for each person.
  intersectingAreas = CalculateIntersectingAreas(personnelLocations);

  // 3. Risk Assessment
  // Identify equipment paths that intersect with personnel's intersecting areas.
  riskAssessment = AssessRisks(intersectingAreas);

  // 4. Barrier Configuration Planning
  // Determine optimal barrier configuration to mitigate risks.
  barrierConfiguration = PlanBarrierConfiguration(riskAssessment, workspaceMap);

  // 5. Barrier Deployment
  DeployBarriers(barrierConfiguration);

  // 6. Monitor & Adjust - Loop back to step 1
  // Continuously monitor personnel location & adjust barrier configuration as needed.
}
```

**3. Detailed Feature Specifications:**

*   **Predictive Barrier Deployment:**  Integrate equipment path prediction algorithms.  Deploy barriers *before* a potential collision, based on predicted trajectories.
*   **Adaptive Barrier Height/Opacity:**  Barrier modules should be capable of adjusting their height and opacity.  Lower/more transparent barriers for visual access, higher/opaque barriers for complete separation.
*   **Zone-Based Safety Levels:** Define zones within the workspace with varying safety requirements. Barrier configuration is dynamically adjusted based on the zone.
*   **Multi-Personnel Support:** System must support tracking and safety management for multiple personnel simultaneously.
*   **Emergency Stop Functionality:**  A physical emergency stop button (and software equivalent) triggers immediate retraction of all barriers and shutdown of automated equipment.
*   **User Interface:** Visual display showing workspace map, personnel locations, equipment paths, and barrier configuration.

**4.  Communication Protocol:**

*   Wireless (Wi-Fi, UWB, or dedicated RF protocol)
*   Bidirectional communication for control and status updates.
*   Secure communication protocol to prevent unauthorized access.

**5.  Power Requirements:**

*   Barrier Modules: Battery powered with remote charging capability, or wired connection.
*   Control Logic: Standard industrial power supply.



This system moves beyond simply stopping equipment near personnel to proactively *changing the workspace* to ensure safe separation. It allows for continued operation of automated equipment while maintaining a safe working environment for human personnel.
