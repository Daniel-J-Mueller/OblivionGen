## Dynamic Item Group Evolution via User Action Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the seed expansion concept by incorporating *predicted* user actions into the item group formation. Instead of solely relying on existing connections and keyword associations, proactively suggest items a user *might* interact with based on their current session and extrapolate that into group membership. This anticipates interest, not just reflects it.

**Specs:**

1.  **Action Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: User session data (browsing history, purchase history, search queries), current item group, item connection graph.
    *   Process: Train a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically an LSTM or GRU, to predict the next item a user is likely to interact with. The RNN will be trained on historical user data, considering sequential item interactions. The item connection graph acts as a constraint; predicted items should have a path, however tenuous, to items already in the group.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over potential next items.

2.  **Proactive Group Expansion:**
    *   Input: Probability distribution from Action Prediction Module, current item group, item connection graph, threshold value (alpha).
    *   Process:
        *   Filter the probability distribution to include only items *not* currently in the group.
        *   Sort the filtered items by probability score.
        *   Iteratively add items to the group if their probability score exceeds the alpha threshold *and* a path exists in the item connection graph between the new item and at least one item already in the group. The path length can be weighted (shorter paths preferred).
        *   Implement a decay factor on path weighting. Longer paths contribute less to the connection strength.
    *   Output: Updated item group.

3.  **Dynamic Alpha Adjustment:**
    *   Input: User interaction data (clicks, purchases, dwell time), item group size, prediction accuracy.
    *   Process: Adjust the alpha threshold dynamically based on user engagement and prediction performance.
        *   High engagement and accurate predictions: Lower alpha (more aggressive expansion).
        *   Low engagement and inaccurate predictions: Raise alpha (more conservative expansion).
    *   Output: Adjusted alpha value.

4.  **Weighted Connection Strength:**
    *   Process: Modify the item connection graph to incorporate semantic similarity scores between items. These scores can be derived from item descriptions, tags, or user-generated content. The connection strength between two items will be a combination of the graph connection and the semantic similarity score.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def expand_group(user_session, current_group, item_graph, alpha):
    predicted_items = predict_next_item(user_session, item_graph)  # RNN prediction
    eligible_items = [item for item, prob in predicted_items.items() if item not in current_group and prob > alpha]
    eligible_items.sort(key=lambda item: predicted_items[item], reverse=True)

    for item in eligible_items:
        if path_exists(item, current_group, item_graph): # Check for connection path
            current_group.add(item)
            alpha = adjust_alpha(user_interaction, current_group.size, prediction_accuracy) #Dynamic adjustment
    return current_group
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Item Graph:** Adjacency list representing item connections. Edge weights represent connection strength (graph distance + semantic similarity).
*   **User Session:** List of items interacted with during the current session.
*   **Current Group:** Set of items in the current group.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Implement a reinforcement learning framework to optimize the alpha threshold and connection weighting.
*   Incorporate user demographics and preferences into the prediction model.
*   Allow users to provide explicit feedback on group suggestions.
