## Modular Environmental Sensor Array - "Guardian Node"

**Concept:** Expand the security device into a localized environmental monitoring station. Leverage the existing housing and power systems to integrate a suite of sensors beyond security, creating a "Guardian Node" for smart home/building applications.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Modules (Interchangeable/Expandable):**

*   **Air Quality Module:**
    *   Sensors: PM2.5, PM10, VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds), CO, CO2, Ozone.
    *   Interface: I2C/SPI connection to central processing unit (PCBA).
    *   Calibration: Automated self-calibration routines.
*   **Weather Module:**
    *   Sensors: Temperature, Humidity, Barometric Pressure, Wind Speed (micro-anemometer), Rainfall (capacitive sensor).
    *   Interface: I2C/SPI.
    *   Housing: Miniature weather-resistant enclosure integrated into the main housing.
*   **Water Leak Detection Module:**
    *   Sensor: Capacitive liquid sensor (detects presence of water, not necessarily flow).
    *   Placement: Designed for placement on floor or within designated areas.
    *   Interface: Digital Output.
*   **Radiation Sensor Module:**
    *   Sensor: Geiger-MÃ¼ller tube for detecting ionizing radiation.
    *   Housing: Shielded enclosure to minimize false positives.
    *   Interface: Analog output.
*   **Plant Health Module:**
    *   Sensor: Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance sensor for chlorophyll measurement.
    *   Mounting: Flexible arm for positioning near plant foliage.
    *   Interface: I2C/SPI.

**2. Communication & Data Processing:**

*   **Wireless Protocol:** Utilize existing Wi-Fi connectivity and add Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for localized data transmission and configuration.
*   **Edge Computing:** Implement a small microcontroller on the PCBA to perform basic data filtering, aggregation, and anomaly detection. This reduces bandwidth usage and improves response time.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilize onboard flash memory for temporary data storage in case of network outages.
*   **API:** Develop a RESTful API for accessing sensor data and controlling device settings.
*   **Alerting:** Configurable alerts based on sensor thresholds (e.g., high VOC levels, water leak detected). Alerts can be sent via push notifications, email, or SMS.

**3. Power Management:**

*   **Battery Optimization:** Optimize power consumption of sensor modules and communication protocols.
*   **Solar Charging (Optional):** Integrate a small solar panel into the housing for supplemental power.
*   **Power Harvesting (Potential):** Explore energy harvesting technologies (e.g., vibration, thermal) to further reduce reliance on batteries.

**4. Physical Design:**

*   **Modular Slots:** Integrate standardized connection slots into the main housing to accommodate sensor modules.
*   **Weatherproof Design:** Ensure the housing is weatherproof and can withstand outdoor conditions.
*   **Mounting Options:** Provide various mounting options (e.g., wall mount, pole mount, tabletop mount).

**Pseudocode (Data Processing):**

```
// Sensor Data Acquisition Loop
while (true) {
    // Read data from each sensor module
    pm25 = readSensor("PM2.5");
    temperature = readSensor("Temperature");
    humidity = readSensor("Humidity");

    // Data Filtering & Aggregation
    pm25_filtered = movingAverage(pm25, 5);  // Apply moving average filter
    avg_temperature = (temperature + previous_temperature) / 2;

    // Anomaly Detection (Simple Thresholding)
    if (pm25_filtered > threshold_pm25) {
        sendAlert("High PM2.5 levels detected!");
    }

    // Data Transmission
    sendDataToCloud(pm25_filtered, avg_temperature, humidity);

    delay(1000); // Sample every second
}
```

**Expansion potential:** Acoustic monitoring, soil moisture sensors, light level sensors. The modular nature allows for easy customization and expansion based on specific user needs. The emphasis is on providing a holistic environmental monitoring solution, going beyond traditional security functionality.
