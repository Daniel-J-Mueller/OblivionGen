## Predictive Partitioning & Dynamic Metric Synthesis

**Specification:** A system for proactively adjusting data partitioning and dynamically creating synthetic metrics derived from raw telemetry, aiming to optimize resource allocation and predictive scaling.

**Core Concept:**  Instead of solely partitioning based on a hash of the metric identifier and timestamp, this system predicts future access patterns and partitions data *before* the data arrives.  Furthermore, it generates new metrics on-the-fly based on combinations of existing ones, providing richer input for scaling decisions.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Predictor:**  A machine learning model trained on historical metric access logs. This model predicts which metrics and time ranges will be requested in the near future.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning Engine:**  This engine receives predictions from the Access Pattern Predictor. It dynamically adjusts the partitioning scheme (number of partitions, hash function parameters) to optimize for predicted access patterns.  This is a continuous process, reacting to shifting demand.
*   **Metric Synthesis Engine:**  This component allows defining rules for creating new metrics from existing ones. For example: "CPU Utilization + Network I/O = Application Load".  These rules can be user-defined or automatically generated through analysis of correlations in the data.
*   **Data Enrichment Pipeline:**  As data arrives, it's enriched with the synthetic metrics generated by the Metric Synthesis Engine.
*   **Adaptive Storage Layer:**  The underlying storage system is designed to efficiently handle dynamic partitioning changes without downtime or significant performance degradation.  This could involve consistent hashing or other techniques.

**Data Flow:**

1.  **Prediction:** Access Pattern Predictor forecasts future metric access.
2.  **Partition Adjustment:** Dynamic Partitioning Engine modifies partitioning based on prediction.
3.  **Data Ingestion:** Raw telemetry data arrives.
4.  **Enrichment:** Data Enrichment Pipeline adds synthetic metrics.
5.  **Storage:** Enriched data is stored in the Adaptive Storage Layer, partitioned according to the current scheme.
6.  **Query:** Computing Resource Managers request metrics.  The Adaptive Storage Layer efficiently locates the requested data based on the partitioning scheme.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Partitioning Engine):**

```
function adjust_partitions(predicted_access_pattern):
  // Analyze predicted_access_pattern to identify frequently accessed metrics and time ranges
  frequent_metrics, frequent_time_ranges = analyze_access_pattern(predicted_access_pattern)

  // Determine optimal number of partitions based on frequency and distribution
  num_partitions = calculate_optimal_partitions(frequent_metrics, frequent_time_ranges)

  // Calculate hash function parameters to distribute data across partitions
  hash_function_params = calculate_hash_params(num_partitions, frequent_metrics)

  // Apply new partitioning scheme to storage layer
  apply_partitioning_scheme(num_partitions, hash_function_params)

  return success
```

**Pseudocode (Metric Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesize_metrics(raw_data, synthesis_rules):
  synthetic_metrics = []
  for rule in synthesis_rules:
    // Rule format:  "new_metric = metric1 + metric2"
    operation = rule.operation
    metrics = rule.metrics
    new_metric = apply_operation(operation, metrics, raw_data)
    synthetic_metrics.append(new_metric)
  return synthetic_metrics
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced query latency due to optimized partitioning.
*   More accurate scaling decisions based on richer metric data.
*   Improved resource utilization.
*   Proactive adaptation to changing workload patterns.
*   The ability to expose complex, derived metrics to computing resource managers without requiring them to perform the calculations themselves.
