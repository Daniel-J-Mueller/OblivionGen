## Decentralized Identity Negotiation with Reputation-Based Trust

**Concept:** Extend the federated identity broker concept to a fully decentralized, blockchain-based system where identity providers (IdPs) and identity consumers (IdCs) negotiate access permissions directly, mediated by a smart contract and augmented by a reputation system. This removes the central broker, enhancing security and user control.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Decentralized Identity (DID) Registry:** A blockchain-based registry for DIDs, anchoring identities and associated cryptographic keys.  Utilize a DID method like DID:Web or DID:Key.
*   **Smart Contract Mediator:** A smart contract deployed on a suitable blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polkadot) to facilitate negotiation and permission enforcement.
*   **Reputation Oracle:** A system to assess and record the trustworthiness of both IdPs and IdCs. This could be a decentralized network of oracles or a weighted scoring system based on transaction history and dispute resolution outcomes.
*   **Permission Negotiation Protocol:** A standardized protocol for IdPs and IdCs to propose, counter-propose, and agree upon access permissions.
*   **Resource Descriptor Standard:**  A consistent format for describing resources being accessed, including attributes, access types (read, write, execute), and usage policies.

**II. System Architecture:**

1.  **Registration:** IdPs and IdCs register their DIDs with the system. This establishes their identity on the blockchain.
2.  **Resource Declaration:** IdPs declare the resources they control, using the Resource Descriptor Standard.  These declarations are stored on-chain.
3.  **Access Request Initiation:** An IdC initiates an access request for a specific resource, targeting the appropriate IdP. The request includes the desired access type, a justification for access, and a proposed reward (cryptocurrency) for granting access.
4.  **Negotiation Phase:**
    *   The IdP receives the request and evaluates it based on the requesterâ€™s reputation, the resource requested, and the proposed reward.
    *   The IdP can:
        *   Accept the request.
        *   Counter-propose with a different reward or modified access permissions.
        *   Reject the request.
    *   This negotiation continues until an agreement is reached or a timeout is reached.
5.  **Smart Contract Enforcement:** Once an agreement is reached:
    *   The agreed-upon permissions are encoded within a smart contract.
    *   The IdC deposits the agreed-upon reward into the smart contract.
    *   The smart contract grants the IdC access to the resource (via a verifiable credential or access token).
    *   Access is monitored and enforced by the smart contract.
6.  **Reputation Update:** After a transaction:
    *   Both the IdP and IdC rate each other.
    *   The Reputation Oracle aggregates these ratings and updates their respective reputation scores.
7.  **Dispute Resolution:** If a dispute arises (e.g., unauthorized access, unmet conditions), a decentralized dispute resolution mechanism (e.g., Kleros) is invoked to arbitrate.

**III. Pseudocode (Smart Contract - Simplified):**

```
contract IdentityNegotiation {

  mapping(address => uint) public reputation;
  mapping(address => mapping(address => string)) public permissions;
  mapping(address => mapping(address => uint)) public rewards;

  function proposeAccess(address idp, string memory permission, uint reward) public {
      // ... validation ...
      rewards[msg.sender][idp] = reward;
      permissions[msg.sender][idp] = permission;
  }

  function acceptAccess(address idc, string memory permission) public {
    // ... validation ...
    permissions[idc][msg.sender] = permission;
    // ... transfer reward from IdC to IdP ...
  }

  function verifyAccess(address idc) public view returns (bool) {
    // ... check if IdC has permission for resource ...
    return true;
  }

  function updateReputation(address user, uint score) public {
    // ... update user's reputation ...
  }
}
```

**IV. Potential Extensions:**

*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs:**  Implement ZKPs to allow IdCs to prove they have certain attributes without revealing the attributes themselves.
*   **Dynamic Permissions:**  Allow permissions to change over time based on predefined rules or external events.
*   **Cross-Chain Compatibility:** Enable negotiation and access across different blockchain networks.
*    **Data Minimization:** Implement techniques to minimize the amount of personal data shared during the negotiation process.
