## Adaptive Skill Chaining with Predictive Context

**Concept:** Expand the skill selection beyond immediate utterance response to create a predictive chain of skills based on anticipated user needs. Rather than simply selecting *one* skill per utterance, the system forecasts likely follow-up intents and pre-loads/partially activates related skills. This significantly reduces latency for complex multi-step interactions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Anticipation Module (CAM):**

*   **Input:** Vector representation of current utterance (as generated by the existing ML encoder). User profile data (history, preferences, demographics). Dialogue history (past N utterances and system responses).
*   **Process:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) with attention mechanism. The RNN is trained to predict the next likely *skill category* (e.g., music, news, smart home control). The attention mechanism focuses on salient parts of the dialogue history and user profile. Output is a probability distribution over skill categories.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of predicted skill categories and associated confidence scores.

**2. Skill Pre-Activation Queue (SPAQ):**

*   **Function:** Maintains a queue of skills prioritized based on the output of the CAM. Skills are not fully activated (expensive operation) but are placed in a “warm” state – key models are loaded into memory, initial processing pipelines are primed.
*   **Queue Management:**  A sliding window approach. The queue has a fixed size (e.g., 5 skills). When a new skill is predicted, it replaces the least likely skill in the queue (lowest confidence score). Skills remain in the queue for a defined period (e.g., 30 seconds) even if not immediately invoked.
*   **Resource Allocation:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory) for the SPAQ to prevent resource exhaustion. Prioritize warm skills during resource contention.

**3. Skill Chaining Logic:**

*   **Invocation Trigger:** When a skill is selected to respond to the current utterance, the system checks if any warm skills in the SPAQ are relevant to the anticipated follow-up intent.
*   **Chain Initiation:** If a relevant warm skill is found, it’s immediately activated (bypassing the typical loading/initialization delay).  A “chain token” is passed to the invoked skill, signaling that it's part of a predicted chain.
*   **Context Transfer:**  The invoked skill is responsible for transferring relevant context (extracted from the current utterance and its response) to the chained skill.
*   **Chain Termination:**  A chain terminates when either a relevant warm skill isn’t found, or the invoked skill determines that the chain should be broken (e.g., user changes topic abruptly).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On each utterance:
utteranceVector = ML_Encoder(utterance)
predictedSkills = CAM(utteranceVector, userProfile, dialogueHistory)

// Update SPAQ:
SPAQ = Update_SPAQ(SPAQ, predictedSkills)

// Skill selection:
selectedSkill = Skill_Selector(utteranceVector)

// Chain initiation:
if SPAQ contains relevantSkill:
    relevantSkill.activate()
    pass context to relevantSkill
    chainToken = true
else:
    chainToken = false

selectedSkill.process(utterance, chainToken)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Skill Representation:** Each skill is represented by a data structure containing: skill ID, category, activation cost, resource requirements, models, and initial processing pipelines.
*   **SPAQ Entry:**  Each entry in the SPAQ contains: skill ID, confidence score, activation timestamp.
*   **Chain Token:**  A simple flag indicating that the current skill is part of a predicted chain.
