## Dynamic Beamforming Mesh Network with AI-Driven Interference Cancellation

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic beamforming concept beyond point-to-point communication to create a self-organizing mesh network where devices collaboratively optimize beam patterns and dynamically cancel interference using localized AI.

**Specifications:**

*   **Node Architecture:** Each wireless device (node) will incorporate the existing beamforming hardware (antenna array, phase shifters, attenuators, RF modules) but add a dedicated Edge AI processor (e.g., a low-power neural processing unit).
*   **AI Model:** A localized, federated learning model will reside on each node. This model is trained to predict interference patterns from neighboring nodes *and* to optimize its own beamforming weights to minimize that interference. The model will also learn the propagation characteristics of the environment to improve beam steering accuracy.
*   **Mesh Topology:** Nodes will discover each other via a low-power beacon signal. They will establish a mesh network without a central controller. Network topology will be dynamic, adapting to changes in node density and environmental conditions.
*   **Interference Cancellation:** The core innovation. Each node will continuously monitor received signals from neighboring nodes. The AI model will predict the interference signal based on the known beamforming configuration of the interfering node. The node will then generate a counter-signal (using its phase shifters) to actively cancel the predicted interference.
*   **Beamforming Coordination:** Nodes will broadcast their current beamforming weights (phase shifter angles, attenuation levels) periodically. Neighboring nodes will use this information as input to their AI models, improving interference prediction and cancellation accuracy.
*   **Data Collection & Federated Learning:** Each node will collect data on received signal strength, interference levels, and beamforming performance. This data will be used to continuously refine the local AI model. Periodically, model updates will be shared with neighboring nodes via federated learning, improving the overall network performance. Privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., differential privacy) will be implemented to protect user data.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Existing beamforming hardware (antenna array, phase shifters, attenuators, RF modules)
    *   Edge AI processor (Neural Processing Unit - NPU) with sufficient processing power for real-time interference prediction and beamforming optimization.
    *   Additional memory to store AI models and training data.
    *   Low-power communication module for beacon signaling and model exchange.
