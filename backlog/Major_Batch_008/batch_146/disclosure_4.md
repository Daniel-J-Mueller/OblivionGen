## Dynamic Scene Composition with Attribute-Guided Object Insertion

**Concept:** Expand upon the latent space traversal concept to enable the dynamic composition of entirely new scenes by intelligently inserting and manipulating objects based on desired attribute combinations. The existing patent focuses on modifying *existing* images. This shifts the focus to *creating* images.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Module: Scene Graph Generator:**

*   **Input:** User-defined attribute vector (e.g., "cozy," "futuristic," "tropical") and a seed image (optional – could be entirely procedurally generated if absent).
*   **Process:**
    *   Map the attribute vector to a distribution within the learned latent space (using the machine learning models described in the patent).
    *   Query the latent space to identify object embeddings corresponding to objects that strongly align with the input attribute vector. This leverages the attribute-specific embedding vectors outlined in claim 3.
    *   Construct a scene graph representing the proposed scene composition. The graph consists of nodes representing objects and edges representing spatial relationships (e.g., “to the left of,” “on top of,” “facing”). Initial relationships are determined probabilistically based on learned co-occurrence statistics within the training data.
*   **Output:** Scene graph represented as a data structure (e.g., adjacency list).

**2. Object Instantiation & Placement Module:**

*   **Input:** Scene graph, latent space access, and current frame number (for animation).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each node in the scene graph:
        *   Decode the object embedding (from the latent space) to generate a 3D model or 2D sprite.
        *   Instantiate the object in the scene.
        *   Determine initial position and orientation based on the node’s spatial relationships to other objects and constraints.
*   **Output:** Fully instantiated objects with initial pose and location in the scene.

**3. Dynamic Relationship Refinement Module:**

*   **Input:** Scene, camera view, user interaction (optional), and current frame number.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Relationship Evaluation:**  Analyse the current relationships between objects in the scene based on visual cues (e.g., occlusion, proximity, alignment).
    *   **Relationship Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust the spatial relationships between objects to create a more visually coherent and believable scene. This could involve:
        *   Slightly adjusting object positions.
        *   Modifying object orientations.
        *   Adding or removing minor occluders.
    *   **Attribute-Driven Coherence:** Ensure that the refined relationships remain consistent with the original attribute vector.  For example, a “cozy” scene should prioritize soft lighting, warm colors, and comfortable arrangements.
*   **Output:** Updated scene with refined object relationships.

**4. Rendering Pipeline:**

*   Utilizes a standard rendering pipeline (e.g., ray tracing, rasterization) to generate a final image from the refined scene.  Shader effects can be applied to further enhance the visual style and align with the desired attributes.

**Pseudocode (Scene Graph Generator):**

```
function generate_scene_graph(attribute_vector, seed_image):
  latent_distribution = map_attribute_vector_to_latent_space(attribute_vector)
  object_embeddings = query_latent_space(latent_distribution) // Returns list of embeddings
  scene_graph = create_empty_graph()
  for embedding in object_embeddings:
    object_type = decode_embedding_to_object_type(embedding)
    node = create_node(object_type)
    scene_graph.add_node(node)
    //Determine initial spatial relationship to existing nodes (probabilistic)
    if scene_graph.number_of_nodes() > 1:
      existing_node = choose_random_node(scene_graph)
      relationship = determine_spatial_relationship(existing_node, node)
      scene_graph.add_edge(existing_node, node, relationship)
  return scene_graph
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond image modification to *procedural scene creation*. It intelligently combines objects based on desired aesthetic qualities, generating visually coherent and dynamic scenes.  The focus on attribute-driven relationships and dynamic refinement creates a more immersive and believable experience. This builds on the ability to traverse the latent space and makes it a system for building scenes from scratch.
