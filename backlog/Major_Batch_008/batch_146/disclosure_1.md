**Secure Multi-Party Computation with Homomorphic Encryption & Dynamic Thresholds**

**Concept:** Extend the trusted execution environment (TEE) approach to enable secure multi-party computation (MPC) *without* requiring any single party to fully trust the others, or a central authority. Leverage homomorphic encryption (HE) and dynamic threshold cryptography within the TEE to distribute computation and key management.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Components:**
    *   TEE Module: Secure enclave providing a trusted execution environment.
    *   HE Engine: Library within the TEE for performing homomorphic encryption/decryption operations.  Supports schemes like BFV, CKKS, or TFHE for various data types.
    *   Threshold Cryptography Module: Implements Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS) or similar schemes for splitting keys.
    *   Orchestration Service:  Handles MPC session setup, participant authentication, and data distribution.

*   **MPC Session Lifecycle:**

    1.  **Setup:**
        *   Participants register with the Orchestration Service.
        *   A session is initiated, defining the computation to be performed.
        *   Each participant contributes a random share to a secret key used for HE.  Shares are combined within the TEE (using SSS) to reconstruct the key *only within the enclave*.
        *   A dynamic threshold 'n' (minimum participants needed to reconstruct the secret) is established.

    2.  **Data Input:**
        *   Participants encrypt their input data using the shared HE key.
        *   Encrypted data is distributed to all participants (or a subset based on the computation).

    3.  **Computation:**
        *   Participants perform computations on the encrypted data *within the TEE*.  The HE property allows computations to be performed on ciphertext without decryption.
        *   The TEE orchestrates the distributed computation.

    4.  **Output:**
        *   The final result (encrypted) is aggregated.
        *   If a sufficient number of participants (>= n) cooperate, they can decrypt the result *within the TEE*.

*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

    *   Implement a mechanism for dynamically adjusting the threshold 'n' during the session. This provides resilience against participant dropouts or malicious behavior.
    *   A secure multi-party protocol (e.g., using verifiable secret sharing) is used to update the threshold without revealing the secret key.

*   **Pseudocode (Threshold Update):**

    ```
    // Participants: P1, P2, ..., Pk
    // Current Threshold: t
    // New Threshold: t'

    // 1. Each participant Pi generates a random share Si
    // 2. Participants exchange shares using a secure broadcast protocol.
    // 3. Each participant calculates a combined share: Ci = Sum(Sj) for all j
    // 4. Participants sign their combined share with their private key
    // 5. Verify signatures from at least 't' participants
    // 6. Reconstruct the updated threshold using the verified shares.
    ```

*   **Data Flow:**

    1.  Participant -> Orchestration Service (Registration/Session Start)
    2.  Orchestration Service -> TEE (Key Sharing/Threshold Management)
    3.  Participant <-> TEE (Encrypted Data/Computation Results)
    4.  TEE -> Orchestration Service (Session Completion/Results)

*   **Hardware Considerations:**
    *   Hardware Security Module (HSM) within the TEE for secure key storage.
    *   Accelerated cryptographic instructions for HE operations.
