## Adaptive File System ‘Shadowing’ with Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of monitoring file read/write patterns to *proactively* create ‘shadow’ copies of files *before* malicious modification is detected, guided by behavioral profiling and predictive modeling. This isn’t simple backup; it's anticipatory data preservation.

**Specification:**

**1. Behavioral Baseline Establishment:**

*   **Data Collection:** Monitor all file system operations (read, write, create, delete, rename) for a defined period (e.g., 30 days). Record:
    *   Timestamp
    *   User ID
    *   Process ID
    *   File Path
    *   Operation Type
    *   Data Volume (bytes read/written)
    *   File Entropy (measure of randomness within file content)
*   **Feature Extraction:**  From collected data, derive features for each file:
    *   Access Frequency (operations/time unit)
    *   Operation Sequence (most common sequences of read/write)
    *   Data Change Rate (bytes changed/time unit)
    *   User Access Patterns (which users typically access this file)
    *   Process Access Patterns (which processes typically access this file)
    *   File Content Stability (rate of entropy change)
*   **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM recurrent neural network) per file, using extracted features as input.  The model learns the ‘normal’ behavioral profile for each file.

**2. Predictive Shadowing:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor file system operations.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** For each operation, feed the operation’s features into the file's trained behavioral model.  The model predicts the likelihood of the operation being ‘normal’ or anomalous.
*   **Shadow Creation Threshold:** Define a risk threshold (e.g., 75% confidence of anomaly).  If the anomaly risk exceeds the threshold, *immediately* create a shadow copy of the file *before* the operation is committed.
*   **Shadow Storage:** Utilize a dedicated, high-performance storage tier for shadow copies.  Implement versioning to maintain multiple shadow copies.
*   **Operation Interception:** After shadow creation, *temporarily* intercept the initiating operation (read/write).  Analyze the intercepted data for malicious patterns (e.g., encryption routines).

**3. Adaptive Response:**

*   **Malware Confirmation:** If malicious patterns are detected in intercepted data, *roll back* the operation using the shadow copy.  Alert security personnel.
*   **False Positive Handling:** If no malicious patterns are found, *commit* the operation, effectively updating the ‘current’ version of the file.  Retrain the behavioral model with the new data.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** Continuously analyze the rate of false positives and false negatives.  Dynamically adjust the anomaly detection threshold to optimize performance.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
for each file in file_system:
    train_behavioral_model(file, historical_data)

for each operation in real_time_stream:
    file = operation.target_file
    features = extract_features(operation)
    anomaly_risk = behavioral_model(file).predict(features)

    if anomaly_risk > threshold:
        create_shadow_copy(file)
        intercept_operation(operation)
        if detect_malware(intercepted_data):
            rollback_operation(file, shadow_copy)
            alert_security()
        else:
            commit_operation(operation)
            retrain_behavioral_model(file, operation_data)
    else:
        commit_operation(operation)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance NVMe SSDs for shadow copy storage.
*   Dedicated CPU cores for behavioral model training and prediction.
*   Sufficient RAM to accommodate behavioral models.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with threat intelligence feeds.
*   User-based risk profiles (weighting based on user reputation).
*   Automated root cause analysis of detected threats.
