## Dynamic Wakeword Sensitivity Based on Predicted Cognitive Load

**Concept:** Leverage biofeedback data (heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, potentially even subtle facial muscle movements via onboard camera) to *proactively* adjust wakeword detection sensitivity. The system anticipates when a user is likely to be engaged in cognitively demanding tasks and lowers the wakeword threshold *before* they attempt to issue a command. Conversely, when the user appears relaxed and less focused, it increases the threshold to reduce false positives. This is beyond simply reacting to failed speech processing; it's *predictive*.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Biofeedback Sensor Integration: Support for common wearable heart rate monitors (Bluetooth LE) and potential integration with onboard cameras capable of subtle facial analysis.
*   On-Device Processing: Edge computing capability to perform real-time analysis of biofeedback data. (Neural Engine/Specialized chip)
*   Existing Microphone Array.

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Biofeedback Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   API for connecting to and receiving data from supported biofeedback sensors.
    *   Data smoothing and noise reduction filters.
    *   Data rate: 1-5 Hz (configurable).

2.  **Cognitive Load Estimation Model:**
    *   Machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, LSTM) trained on labeled data correlating biofeedback patterns with cognitive load levels (low, medium, high).
    *   Model training data: Gathered through user studies where participants perform tasks of varying cognitive demand while wearing biofeedback sensors.
    *   Real-time cognitive load prediction based on incoming biofeedback data.
    *   Output: Cognitive load level (0-100 scale).

3.  **Dynamic Wakeword Sensitivity Controller:**
    *   Mapping between cognitive load level and wakeword detection threshold. (See example mapping below).
    *   Threshold adjustment mechanism: Smoothly adjust the wakeword detection threshold over a configurable time period (e.g., 5-10 seconds) to avoid jarring transitions.
    *   User-configurable sensitivity override: Allow users to manually adjust the wakeword sensitivity if desired.

4.  **Calibration Routine:**
    *   Initial calibration process where the system learns the userâ€™s baseline biofeedback patterns during a period of rest and during simple, standardized tasks.

**Example Mapping:**

| Cognitive Load Level | Wakeword Threshold Multiplier |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 0-25 (Rest)           | 1.2x (Higher Threshold)       |
| 26-50 (Low)           | 1.0x (Normal Threshold)      |
| 51-75 (Medium)        | 0.8x (Lower Threshold)       |
| 76-100 (High)         | 0.6x (Significantly Lower)   |

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Threshold Adjustment):**

```
// Variables
current_cognitive_load: Integer
current_wakeword_threshold: Float

// Main Loop

while (true) {
  current_cognitive_load = GetCognitiveLoadFromBiofeedback() // Returns integer 0-100
  
  // Determine target threshold multiplier based on cognitive load
  if (current_cognitive_load <= 25) {
    target_multiplier = 1.2
  } else if (current_cognitive_load <= 50) {
    target_multiplier = 1.0
  } else if (current_cognitive_load <= 75) {
    target_multiplier = 0.8
  } else {
    target_multiplier = 0.6
  }

  // Smoothly adjust the threshold over time
  current_wakeword_threshold = Lerp(current_wakeword_threshold, base_wakeword_threshold * target_multiplier, 0.05)

  SetWakewordThreshold(current_wakeword_threshold)

  Sleep(0.1 seconds)
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Personalized Models:** Train individual cognitive load models for each user to improve accuracy.
*   **Activity Recognition Integration:** Incorporate activity recognition data (e.g., walking, driving) to further refine the cognitive load estimation.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Consider the user's current context (e.g., meeting, music playback) when adjusting the wakeword threshold.
*   **Predictive Thresholding:** Use historical data to predict future cognitive load and proactively adjust the threshold *before* a change occurs.
