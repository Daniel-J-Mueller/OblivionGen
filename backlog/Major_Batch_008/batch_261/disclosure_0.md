## Personalized Aesthetic Profiling for Cross-Category Recommendations

**Concept:** Expand beyond attribute correlation (color, price, etc.) to model user *aesthetic preferences* and use those profiles to drive cross-category recommendations. This goes beyond simply what items are bought together, and addresses *why* – tapping into underlying stylistic choices.

**Specs:**

1.  **Aesthetic Feature Extraction:**
    *   Utilize a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) – likely a variant of ResNet or EfficientNet – to extract visual features from item images.
    *   The CNN should be fine-tuned on a large dataset of images categorized by aesthetic attributes (e.g., minimalist, rustic, bohemian, modern, vintage, etc.).  These aesthetic categories can be sourced from interior design, fashion, and product styling databases.
    *   Output a high-dimensional aesthetic feature vector for each item.

2.  **User Aesthetic Profile Creation:**
    *   Track user interactions (views, purchases, saves, time spent viewing) with items.
    *   For each user, calculate a weighted average of the aesthetic feature vectors of the items they have interacted with.  Weighting should prioritize recent interactions and purchases.
    *   Apply dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) to create a compact user aesthetic profile vector.

3.  **Cross-Category Recommendation Engine:**
    *   For a given source item, identify potential recommended items in *different* categories.
    *   Calculate the cosine similarity between the source item’s aesthetic feature vector and the aesthetic feature vectors of all potential recommended items.
    *   Further refine the similarity score by incorporating the user’s aesthetic profile. Calculate the dot product of the user's aesthetic profile with the aesthetic feature vector of the candidate recommended item. This emphasizes items that align with the user’s overall aesthetic.
    *   Combine the category-based similarity (from the original patent’s combination rules) and the aesthetic similarity. A weighted sum can be used: `Final Score = α * Category Score + (1 - α) * Aesthetic Score`. α is a hyperparameter that controls the relative importance of each factor.
    *   Rank the potential recommended items based on the final score.

4.  **Dynamic Aesthetic Profile Update:**
    *   Continuously update the user’s aesthetic profile based on their ongoing interactions.  Implement an exponential moving average to give more weight to recent interactions.
    *   Incorporate explicit feedback mechanisms (e.g., “I like this style,” “Not my style”) to refine the aesthetic profile.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine Core):**

```
function recommend_cross_category(user_id, source_item_id):
  user_aesthetic_profile = get_user_aesthetic_profile(user_id)
  source_item_aesthetic_vector = get_item_aesthetic_vector(source_item_id)
  category_rules = get_category_rules(source_item_id) //From original patent

  candidate_items = find_items_in_different_categories(source_item_id)

  for item in candidate_items:
    item_aesthetic_vector = get_item_aesthetic_vector(item)
    category_score = calculate_category_similarity(source_item_id, item, category_rules) // Use original patent's logic
    aesthetic_similarity = dot_product(user_aesthetic_profile, item_aesthetic_vector)
    final_score = α * category_score + (1 - α) * aesthetic_similarity
    item.final_score = final_score

  sort items by final_score descending
  return top_n_items
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large dataset of item images.
*   Dataset of images labeled with aesthetic attributes.
*   User interaction data (views, purchases, saves).
*   Hyperparameter α (tuned via A/B testing).

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Style Transfer:**  Suggest items that are stylistically similar to items the user already owns, even if they are in different categories.
*   **Visual Search:** Allow users to upload an image of a desired style, and recommend items across categories that match that style.
*   **Aesthetic Clustering:**  Group users with similar aesthetic profiles to improve recommendation accuracy.
