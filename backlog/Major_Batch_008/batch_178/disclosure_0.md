## Dynamic Haptic Texture Mapping

**Concept:** Integrate micro-fluidic channels *within* the device casing to create dynamically changing tactile textures on the device surface. This moves beyond simple vibration and allows for the simulation of complex materials and shapes directly under the user’s fingers.

**Specs:**

*   **Micro-Fluidic Layer:** A thin (0.5-1mm) layer integrated *between* the device’s primary casing and the display. Constructed from a durable, flexible polymer (e.g., silicone, TPU).
*   **Channel Dimensions:** Network of micro-channels (width: 50-200μm, depth: 20-100μm) etched into the micro-fluidic layer. Channel density varies based on desired texture resolution (target: 200-500 channels/cm²).
*   **Fluid:** Non-conductive, viscous fluid (e.g., silicone oil) fills the micro-channels. Fluid viscosity adjustable via software control (range: 5-50 cP).
*   **Actuation:** Piezoelectric micro-pumps integrated *beneath* the micro-fluidic layer. Each pump controls fluid flow within a localized region of the channel network. Individual pump control resolution: 1mm².
*   **Software Interface:** API for developers to define texture maps. Texture maps specify fluid pressure (and therefore channel height/texture prominence) for each 1mm² region.
*   **Texture Presets:** Pre-loaded texture presets: wood grain, fabric weaves (silk, denim, wool), brushed metal, knurled grip, raised buttons, braille.
*   **Dynamic Response Time:** Target fluid pressure change/texture update time: 50-100ms.
*   **Power Consumption:** Optimized micro-pump control algorithm to minimize power draw.
*   **Materials:** Housing material must be compatible with fluid and avoid leaching.

**Pseudocode (Texture Update):**

```
function UpdateTexture(textureMap) {
  for each region in textureMap {
    regionX = region.x
    regionY = region.y
    pressure = region.pressure // Value 0-100 representing desired fluid pressure

    CalculatePumpActivation(regionX, regionY, pressure) // Determine necessary pump activation level

    ActivatePump(regionX, regionY, pumpLevel) // Send signal to piezoelectric pump
  }
}

function CalculatePumpActivation(x, y, pressure) {
  // Apply calibration curve to convert pressure to pump voltage
  voltage = pressure * calibrationCurve[x][y]
  return voltage
}
```

**Possible Applications:**

*   Enhanced VR/AR interaction.
*   Tactile feedback for accessibility (e.g., dynamic braille display).
*   Immersive gaming experiences.
*   Simulating physical controls on a touchscreen device.
*   Unique device aesthetic/customization.
