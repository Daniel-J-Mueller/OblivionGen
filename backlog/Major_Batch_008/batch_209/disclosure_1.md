## Adaptive Spatial Audio Beaconing System

**Concept:** Extend the earbud-to-earbud communication beyond simple data relay to create a localized spatial audio beaconing system. This allows for dynamic, personalized audio experiences based on relative earbud positioning and environmental context.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Each earbud includes an ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for precise positioning data (beyond Bluetooth).
    *   Each earbud incorporates a miniature directional microphone array (4-6 microphones).
    *   Enhanced processing capability in the primary earbud for real-time spatial audio rendering.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   **Positioning Engine:** UWB data fused with accelerometer and gyroscope data for sub-centimeter accuracy in earbud positioning relative to each other and, optionally, a known fixed point (e.g., a smartphone).
    *   **Contextual Audio Beacon Generation:** Primary earbud analyzes ambient sound (using the microphone array) and generates “audio beacons” – short, distinctive audio signals. These beacons encode contextual information like:
        *   Direction of sound source (e.g., a car approaching, someone speaking)
        *   Distance to sound source
        *   Sound source type (classification via audio analysis)
    *   **Beacon Transmission & Spatial Rendering:**
        *   Beacons are transmitted to the secondary earbud via the established Bluetooth connection (or a dedicated short-range radio).
        *   The secondary earbud uses the beacon data *and* its own microphone input to perform spatial audio rendering. This creates a 3D soundscape that emphasizes the direction and distance of the original sound source.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment & Personalization:**
        *   The system continuously adjusts the audio rendering based on earbud movement and changing environmental conditions.
        *   User profiles can store preferred audio rendering parameters (e.g., emphasizing certain sound frequencies, filtering out noise).
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Primary earbud captures ambient audio and analyzes it.
    2.  Primary earbud determines sound source direction, distance, and type.
    3.  Primary earbud encodes this information into an “audio beacon”.
    4.  Primary earbud transmits the beacon to the secondary earbud.
    5.  Secondary earbud receives the beacon.
    6.  Secondary earbud combines beacon data with its own microphone input.
    7.  Secondary earbud performs spatial audio rendering, creating a 3D soundscape.

**Pseudocode (Spatial Rendering - Secondary Earbud):**

```
function renderSpatialAudio(beaconData, localAudioData):
    //beaconData:  direction, distance, soundType
    //localAudioData: Raw audio from secondary earbud microphone
    
    direction = beaconData.direction
    distance = beaconData.distance
    soundType = beaconData.soundType

    //Calculate attenuation based on distance
    attenuation = calculateAttenuation(distance)

    //Apply directional filtering (emphasize sounds from the specified direction)
    directionalAudio = applyDirectionalFilter(localAudioData, direction)

    //Mix directional and attenuated local audio with the original local audio
    finalAudio = mixAudio(localAudioData, directionalAudio * attenuation)

    //Output the final audio
    outputAudio(finalAudio)
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Enhanced situational awareness (e.g., hearing a car approaching from behind while running).
*   Immersive audio experiences (e.g., virtual reality, gaming).
*   Assistive listening devices for people with hearing impairments.
*   Directional music streaming (e.g., privately listening to music without disturbing others).
