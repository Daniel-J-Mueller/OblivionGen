## Dynamic Ad Creative Assembly via Generative AI

**Specification:** An automated system for assembling ad creatives from modular components generated by a diffusion model, tailored to real-time contextual signals and user preferences.

**Core Concept:** Instead of relying on pre-designed ad creatives, dynamically generate visual and textual components and assemble them into cohesive ads. This allows for hyper-personalization and rapid adaptation to changing conditions.

**Components:**

*   **Diffusion Model (Image & Text):** A pre-trained diffusion model capable of generating high-quality images and coherent text snippets based on input prompts. Two separate models are preferred, allowing for independent control and specialization.
*   **Modular Component Library:** A database of pre-defined “slots” or layouts for ads (e.g., hero image + headline + call to action). Each slot defines the expected dimensions, aspect ratios, and content types for its components.
*   **Contextual Signal Processor:** A module that receives real-time data streams, including:
    *   **Ad Presentation Context:** Text surrounding the ad space, webpage content, app category.
    *   **User Profile Data:** Demographics, interests, purchase history, browsing behavior.
    *   **Affiliate Component Data:** Sales commitments, revenue share models, performance metrics.
*   **Prompt Generator:**  Based on the contextual signals, generate text prompts for the diffusion model. The prompts specify the desired visual style, subject matter, and textual content for each ad component. Example: “A vibrant image of a person hiking in a mountain landscape, showcasing durable hiking boots. Style: photorealistic, high-resolution.”
*   **Assembly Engine:**  Receives the generated components (images and text) and assembles them into a complete ad creative according to the selected layout from the modular component library. Performs resizing, cropping, and color adjustments as needed.
*   **A/B Testing & Feedback Loop:**  Continuously A/B test different prompt strategies, layouts, and creative elements. Use performance data (click-through rates, conversion rates) to refine the prompt generator and assembly engine.

**Pseudocode (Assembly Engine):**

```
function assembleAd(layoutID, imageComponent, textComponent):
  layout = getLayoutFromID(layoutID)
  adCreative = new AdCreative()

  # Place image component
  adCreative.addImage(imageComponent, layout.imagePosition, layout.imageSize)

  # Place text component
  adCreative.addText(textComponent, layout.textPosition, layout.textSize, layout.textColor)

  # Add call to action (pre-defined or generated)
  adCreative.addCallToAction(predefinedCallToAction)

  return adCreative
```

**Novelty:**

Current ad systems largely rely on pre-designed creatives or simple template-based variations. This approach is limited in its ability to adapt to rapidly changing conditions and individual user preferences. The proposed system leverages the power of generative AI to create truly dynamic and personalized ad experiences.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Hyper-personalized advertising:** Create ads tailored to individual user interests and browsing behavior.
*   **Real-time contextual advertising:** Adapt ads to the content of the webpage or app they are displayed on.
*   **Automated creative production:** Reduce the need for manual creative design and production.
*   **Dynamic revenue share optimization:** Tailor ads to maximize affiliate revenue based on real-time performance data.
