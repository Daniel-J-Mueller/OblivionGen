## Predictive Shadow Request Generation

**Concept:** Expand the ‘shadow’ testing environment beyond simple duplication of production requests. Leverage machine learning to *predict* likely future production requests based on current traffic patterns and proactively generate ‘shadow’ requests for testing the candidate system. This allows for testing under anticipated load and edge cases *before* they occur in production.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Request Pattern Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Production request logs (timestamp, endpoint, payload, user ID, etc.).
    *   Process: Utilizes a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) to predict future request characteristics. This includes:
        *   Request rate (requests per second).
        *   Endpoint distribution (probability of hitting each endpoint).
        *   Payload characteristics (feature extraction from JSON/XML payloads, predicting common values/ranges).
        *   User behavior patterns (e.g., sequences of API calls).
    *   Output: Predicted request distribution for the next X minutes (configurable).

2.  **Shadow Request Generator:**
    *   Input: Predicted request distribution from the Request Pattern Analyzer.
    *   Process:
        *   Samples requests from the predicted distribution.
        *   Constructs fully formed requests (including authentication tokens, headers, payloads).  Can utilize data masking/anonymization for sensitive information.
        *   Introduces controlled variations (fuzzing) to test robustness and edge cases.  Variation parameters (mutation rate, allowed ranges) are configurable.
    *   Output: A stream of generated ‘shadow’ requests.

3.  **Proxy Integration:**
    *   Integrates with the existing duplicating proxy system.  The Shadow Request Generator provides a supplementary stream of requests alongside the intercepted production requests.
    *   Prioritization: Configurable prioritization of shadow vs. production requests (e.g., shadow requests are only sent during off-peak hours, or limited to a percentage of total traffic).
    *   Traffic Shaping:  Ability to simulate load spikes by increasing the rate of shadow requests.

4.  **Performance Monitoring & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitors the candidate system’s response to shadow requests (latency, error rate, resource utilization).
    *   Feeds performance data back into the Request Pattern Analyzer to refine the prediction model.  This creates a closed-loop system for proactive testing and optimization.

**Pseudocode (Request Pattern Analyzer - simplified):**

```python
class RequestPatternAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, model_type="LSTM"):
        self.model = load_model(model_type) # Loads pre-trained/initialized model

    def train(self, request_logs):
        # Processes and prepares request logs for training
        # Trains the time-series forecasting model
        self.model.fit(processed_logs)

    def predict_request_distribution(self, prediction_horizon):
        # Generates predicted request distribution for the next 'prediction_horizon' minutes
        predicted_rates = self.model.predict(prediction_horizon)
        # Convert predicted rates to probability distribution across endpoints
        endpoint_distribution = calculate_endpoint_probabilities(predicted_rates)
        return endpoint_distribution

```

**Novelty:**  Existing shadow testing systems primarily *react* to production traffic. This system *proactively anticipates* future traffic patterns and generates tests *before* those patterns materialize, enabling a more robust and predictive testing process. It moves beyond simple duplication to intelligent generation of test scenarios.
