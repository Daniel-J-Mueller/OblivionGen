## Dynamic Prompt Augmentation via Generative Counterfactuals

**Concept:** Expand the prompt coverage scoring beyond simple variant counts.  Instead of just measuring how *many* different prompts are used, assess how *effectively* prompts are varied to address potential user misunderstandings or edge cases.  This is achieved by generating *counterfactual* prompts – prompts that would have been useful *if* the user had responded differently – and then scoring the system’s ability to anticipate and deliver those prompts.

**Specifications:**

**1. Counterfactual Prompt Generation Module:**

   *   **Input:** Dialog history (user inputs, system outputs), current user input, NLU intent of current user input.
   *   **Process:**  Employ a large language model (LLM) to generate *n* counterfactual user inputs. These are variations of the current input that represent plausible alternative responses. For example, if the user asks "What's the weather in London?", counterfactuals might include "What’s the weather *like* in London?", “London weather forecast”, or "Is it raining in London?".  The LLM should be prompted to generate inputs that *challenge* the current system response or introduce ambiguity.
   *   **Output:**  List of *n* counterfactual user inputs.

**2. Anticipatory Prompt Scoring Module:**

   *   **Input:** Counterfactual user inputs, current dialog state, system's existing prompt library.
   *   **Process:**  For each counterfactual input:
        *   Generate the *ideal* system response to the counterfactual. This can be done with another LLM or predefined rules.
        *   Search the existing prompt library for a prompt that can deliver this ideal response.
        *   Calculate a "relevance score" representing how well the found prompt addresses the counterfactual. This could be based on semantic similarity (e.g., cosine similarity of embeddings) or a learned scoring function.
        *   If no prompt is found (or relevance is below a threshold), flag the counterfactual as "unanticipated."
   *   **Output:** A list of counterfactuals with their relevance scores and anticipation status (anticipated/unanticipated).

**3. Dynamic Prompt Augmentation Module:**

   *   **Input:** Unanticipated counterfactuals, current dialog state.
   *   **Process:**  For each unanticipated counterfactual:
        *   Utilize an LLM to *generate* a new system prompt tailored to address the counterfactual. This prompt should be contextually appropriate for the current dialog.
        *   Add the generated prompt to the system’s prompt library.
   *   **Output:** Updated prompt library.

**4. Prompt Coverage Score Calculation:**

   *   **Input:** Prompt library, dialog history, list of counterfactuals.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Count the total number of unique prompts used in the dialog.
        *   Calculate the percentage of counterfactuals that were successfully addressed by existing or newly generated prompts.
        *   Combine these metrics into a single "Dynamic Prompt Coverage Score." The formula could be:  `DPC Score = (Unique Prompts + % Addressed Counterfactuals) / 2`

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_dynamic_prompt_coverage(dialog_history, current_user_input, prompt_library):
    counterfactuals = generate_counterfactuals(current_user_input)
    addressed_count = 0
    for counterfactual in counterfactuals:
        best_prompt = find_best_prompt(counterfactual, prompt_library)
        if best_prompt and score(best_prompt, counterfactual) > threshold:
            addressed_count += 1
        else:
            new_prompt = generate_new_prompt(counterfactual)
            add_to_prompt_library(new_prompt)

    unique_prompts = count_unique_prompts(dialog_history)
    addressed_percentage = (addressed_count / len(counterfactuals)) * 100

    dpc_score = (unique_prompts + addressed_percentage) / 2
    return dpc_score
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved dialog robustness by proactively addressing potential user misunderstandings.
*   More engaging and natural conversations.
*   Reduced user frustration.
*   Continuous learning and improvement of the prompt library.
*   Ability to adapt to different user intents and dialog contexts.
