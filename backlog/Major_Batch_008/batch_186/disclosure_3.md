## Dynamic Resource Attestation via Ephemeral Biometric Keys

**Concept:** Extend the scoped credential system by anchoring credentials not to persistent user profiles, but to *transient* biometric confirmations. This creates a system where access isn't granted *to* a user, but *during* a momentary, verified physical presence. This drastically limits credential theft and replay attacks.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Capture Module:** Integrate a biometric sensor (fingerprint, iris, facial recognition, voiceprint - selectable configuration) directly into the computing device initiating the code execution request. This module must provide a raw biometric vector and a confidence score.
2.  **Ephemeral Key Generator (EKG):** Upon successful biometric capture exceeding a predefined confidence threshold, the EKG generates a unique, short-lived cryptographic key derived from the biometric vector and a system-wide nonce. This key will serve as the basis for the scoped credential.  The key lifespan is configurable (e.g., 5-60 seconds).
3.  **Credential Derivation Function (CDF):** The CDF takes the ephemeral key, the requested resource, and a system timestamp as inputs.  It outputs the scoped credential. The CDF *must* incorporate a hashing algorithm resistant to side-channel attacks.
4.  **Resource Proxy:** All resource access is mediated through a Resource Proxy. The Proxy intercepts requests, validates the credential, and enforces access control. Crucially, the Proxy *only* accepts credentials derived from actively captured biometrics.
5.  **Biometric Liveness Detection:** The system *must* include robust liveness detection to prevent the use of spoofed biometrics (e.g., photographs, silicone fingerprints). This is integrated into the Biometric Capture Module.
6.  **Credential Invalidation Mechanism:**  Credentials are invalidated by: (a) Expiration of the key lifespan, (b) Loss of biometric capture (e.g., user looks away from the camera), (c) Failure of liveness detection.
7.  **Audit Logging:** All credential requests, biometric capture events, and access attempts are logged for auditing and security analysis.

**Pseudocode (Resource Proxy - credential validation):**

```
function validateCredential(credential, resource):
    timestamp = extractTimestamp(credential)
    if (timestamp is too old):
        return ACCESS_DENIED

    biometricData = extractBiometricData(credential)
    if (biometricData is invalid):
        return ACCESS_DENIED

    currentBiometricCapture = captureBiometricData()

    if (compareBiometricData(currentBiometricCapture, biometricData) == false):
        return ACCESS_DENIED

    if (verifyLiveness(currentBiometricCapture) == false):
        return ACCESS_DENIED
    
    #If all checks pass, grant access
    return ACCESS_GRANTED
```

**Expansion Considerations:**

*   **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Integrate additional authentication factors (e.g., PIN, OTP) in addition to biometrics.
*   **Biometric Template Protection:** Implement secure storage and protection of biometric templates.
*   **Federated Identity:** Enable cross-domain authentication using federated identity providers.
*   **Dynamic Policy Enforcement:**  Adjust access control policies based on real-time risk assessments.
