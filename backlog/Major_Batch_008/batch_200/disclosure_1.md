## Real-time Affective Query Refinement via Biofeedback

**Specification:** A system augmenting the core patent functionality with real-time biofeedback integration to refine search results based on the user’s emotional state.

**Core Concept:** Instead of *only* reacting to explicit signals (clicks, dwell time, etc.), the system incorporates physiological data to gauge implicit user satisfaction/frustration and proactively adjust results.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Compatible wearable device (smartwatch, fitness tracker, EEG headset – adaptable input) capable of providing real-time biofeedback data:
    *   Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
    *   Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) / Electrodermal Activity (EDA)
    *   Facial muscle activity (EMG - optional, but adds granularity)
*   Secure data transmission protocol between wearable and computing device.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Biofeedback Data Processing Module:**
    *   Receives raw biofeedback data stream.
    *   Filters and cleans data (noise reduction).
    *   Feature extraction: Calculate relevant metrics from the raw data (e.g., root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) for HRV, mean GSR level, facial expression indicators).
    *   Emotional State Estimation: Map extracted features to emotional states (e.g., Calm, Focused, Frustrated, Overwhelmed) using a trained machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, or a shallow neural network). Model trained on labeled biofeedback data correlated with user-reported emotional states.
2.  **Affective Weighting System:**
    *   Integrates emotional state estimates into the existing query refinement model.
    *   Applies dynamic weighting to feedback signals based on the user's emotional state.
        *   **Example:** If the user is detected as “Frustrated”, negative feedback signals (e.g., short dwell time, scroll-past) are given significantly higher weight, and the system aggressively presents alternative results. Conversely, if the user is “Calm”, more subtle changes are made.
    *   Modifies the “explicitness” and “timing” metrics defined in the patent to incorporate emotional valence and arousal levels.
3.  **Proactive Refinement Engine:**
    *   Based on the estimated emotional state, proactively suggest alternative search terms or filters *before* the user explicitly provides negative feedback.
    *   **Example:** If the user is showing signs of frustration while browsing images of “modern sofas”, the system suggests “mid-century modern sofas”, “leather sofas”, or “sofas with high backs”.
    *   Utilizes a generative language model (e.g. Transformer) to formulate the suggestions.
4.  **User Calibration Routine:**
    *   Initial setup to personalize the system.
    *   The user performs a series of tasks (e.g., viewing images, reading text) while their biofeedback data is recorded.
    *   This data is used to train a personalized emotional state estimation model, improving accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Affective Weighting System):**

```
function calculate_weighted_feedback(feedback_signal, emotional_state):
  explicitness = get_explicitness(feedback_signal)
  timing = get_timing(feedback_signal)

  // Emotional state influences weight multipliers
  if emotional_state == "Frustrated":
    explicitness_multiplier = 2.0
    timing_multiplier = 1.5
  elif emotional_state == "Calm":
    explicitness_multiplier = 0.5
    timing_multiplier = 0.7
  else:  // Default: neutral
    explicitness_multiplier = 1.0
    timing_multiplier = 1.0

  weighted_explicitness = explicitness * explicitness_multiplier
  weighted_timing = timing * timing_multiplier

  // Combine weighted metrics for final feedback score
  final_feedback_score = (weighted_explicitness + weighted_timing) / 2

  return final_feedback_score
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Multi-modal Feedback:** Combine biofeedback with other data sources like eye-tracking or voice analysis.
*   **Personalized Aesthetics:** Adapt the visual presentation of results based on the user's emotional state (e.g., color palettes, image styles).
*   **Adaptive Calibration:** Continuously refine the emotional state estimation model based on the user's long-term behavior.
*   **Gamification:** Incorporate elements of gamification to encourage user engagement and provide more feedback signals.
