## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Overlay

**Concept:** Extend the near-field sensing to trigger localized haptic feedback *on* the display surface, creating a dynamic, tactile overlay that corresponds to detected objects and gestures. This moves beyond simply *detecting* input to *responding* with a sense of touch.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Integration:**  Requires a display capable of localized force application – potentially utilizing micro-actuators embedded beneath the surface, or an electrostatic adhesion/repulsion system.  OLED or MicroLED displays are prime candidates due to their pixel-level control.
*   **Sensor Fusion:** Combine data from the near-field optical sensor (NFOS) with existing camera tracking. This is crucial for predicting object trajectories and pre-emptively activating haptic feedback.
*   **Haptic Mapping Algorithm:** A core component. This algorithm translates NFOS and camera data into specific haptic patterns (texture, vibration, force) for each detected object.  Examples:
    *   A detected finger feels like a slight, localized depression.
    *   A virtual button provides a distinct ‘click’ sensation.
    *   A detected pen/stylus feels like friction.
*   **Dynamic Texture Generation:**  Beyond simple shapes, the system generates dynamic, simulated textures.  The NFOS detects the surface characteristics of an object (e.g., a rough fabric), and the haptic system recreates a similar tactile sensation.
*   **Force Gradient Control:** The system creates subtle force gradients to guide user interaction. For example, a virtual slider could provide increasing resistance as the user reaches the end.
*   **Multi-Layer Haptic Simulation:** Simulate multiple layers of objects. For example, detecting a hand resting on a virtual table: the hand gets a 'soft' touch, while the table provides a more 'solid' feeling.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Mapping Algorithm):**

```
// Input: NFOS data (intensity map), Camera Tracking Data (object position, velocity, size)

function generateHapticPattern(nfosData, cameraData):
  objectType = determineObjectType(cameraData)  // Finger, Pen, Unknown
  objectPosition = cameraData.position
  objectSize = cameraData.size

  if objectType == "Finger":
    hapticPattern = createSoftDepression(objectPosition, objectSize)
  else if objectType == "Pen":
    hapticPattern = createFrictionPattern(objectPosition, objectSize)
  else:
    hapticPattern = createDefaultTexture(objectPosition)

  // Apply dynamic effects based on NFOS data (e.g., shadow intensity)
  shadowIntensity = nfosData.getShadowIntensity(objectPosition)
  if shadowIntensity > threshold:
    hapticPattern.addShadowEffect()

  return hapticPattern
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Micro-actuator density (actuators per square inch) dictates the resolution of the haptic feedback.
*   Actuator response time is critical for real-time interaction.
*   Power consumption needs to be minimized for mobile devices.
*   Display material needs to be flexible and durable enough to withstand repeated actuation.
