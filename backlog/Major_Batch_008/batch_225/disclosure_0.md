## Autonomous Swarm-Based Inventory Audit & Relocation System

**System Overview:** A distributed system leveraging miniature, agile aerial drones (SwarmBots) for continuous, real-time inventory auditing and automated item relocation within a materials handling facility. This builds on the ability to track actors & items, extending it to *proactive* inventory management.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **SwarmBots:**  ~150g, quadcopter drones equipped with:
    *   High-resolution RGB-D camera (for 3D mapping & item recognition).
    *   Short-range RFID reader/writer.
    *   Micro-manipulator arm (capable of lifting/moving small-to-medium weight items - up to 2kg).
    *   Edge TPU (Tensor Processing Unit) for on-board AI processing.
    *   Mesh network radio.
    *   Collision avoidance sensors (LiDAR/Ultrasonic).
    *   Wireless charging capability.
*   **Base Stations:** Distributed throughout the facility, providing:
    *   SwarmBot charging docks.
    *   Mesh network connectivity.
    *   Centralized data processing/analysis.
    *   High-resolution facility map (updated via SwarmBot data).
*   **Central Server:**  Manages the SwarmBot fleet, receives/analyzes data, and interfaces with warehouse management systems (WMS).

**Software/Algorithms:**

1.  **Dynamic Mapping & Localization:**
    *   SwarmBots collaboratively build & maintain a 3D map of the facility using SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).
    *   Each SwarmBot localizes itself within the map using visual odometry and mesh network triangulation.
2.  **Object Recognition & Inventory Auditing:**
    *   On-board AI (trained using a vast dataset of warehouse items) identifies objects from camera images.
    *   RFID tags (attached to items) provide unique identifiers and enhance accuracy.
    *   SwarmBots autonomously scan storage locations and update inventory data in the WMS.
3.  **Anomaly Detection & Prioritization:**
    *   AI algorithms identify discrepancies between physical inventory and WMS data (missing items, misplaced items, incorrect quantities).
    *   Prioritization scheme (based on item value, demand, location) determines which anomalies require immediate attention.
4.  **Automated Item Relocation:**
    *   SwarmBots autonomously navigate to misplaced items.
    *   Micro-manipulator arm lifts the item.
    *   SwarmBot navigates to the correct storage location.
    *   Item is placed in the designated location.
5.  **Swarm Coordination & Path Planning:**
    *   Decentralized swarm intelligence algorithms (inspired by ant colony optimization or particle swarm optimization) enable efficient path planning and collision avoidance.
    *   Bots dynamically adjust their routes to avoid obstacles and optimize travel time.
6.  **Predictive Maintenance:**
    *   SwarmBot telemetry data (battery health, sensor performance, motor current) is analyzed to predict potential failures and schedule proactive maintenance.
    *   SwarmBots can autonomously return to base stations for charging or repairs.

**Pseudocode (SwarmBot task execution):**

```
LOOP:
    1. Receive task from Central Server (e.g., "Scan Zone A," "Relocate Item X to Location Y").
    2. Plan route to task location using dynamic map and swarm intelligence.
    3. Navigate to location, avoiding obstacles using sensors.
    4. Execute task:
        IF task == "Scan Zone A":
            Capture images and RFID data of items in Zone A.
            Send data to Central Server.
        IF task == "Relocate Item X to Location Y":
            Locate Item X.
            Activate manipulator arm.
            Lift Item X.
            Navigate to Location Y.
            Place Item X.
    5. Update status and telemetry data.
    6. Return to base station for charging or new task.
```

**Expansion Potential:**

*   Integration with augmented reality (AR) interfaces for real-time inventory visualization and operator guidance.
*   Advanced object recognition algorithms for identifying damaged or defective items.
*   Development of specialized SwarmBot configurations for handling different types of materials (e.g., hazardous chemicals, fragile goods).
*   Use of machine learning to optimize swarm behavior and improve efficiency over time.
*   Connection to broader supply chain systems for end-to-end visibility and control.
