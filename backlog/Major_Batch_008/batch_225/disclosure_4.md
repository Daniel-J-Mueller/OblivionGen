## Dynamic Skill Chaining & Predictive Invocation

**Concept:** Expand beyond single skill previews to allow users to chain skill invocations together *during* the preview experience.  Furthermore, anticipate likely next invocations based on context and user interaction, pre-loading audio to minimize latency.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Functionality - Chained Previews:**

*   **User Input:**  While audio is playing for a skill preview (invocation & reply), the device displays a dynamic menu of potential *next* skill invocations.  This menu is contextually aware, derived from skill relationships (defined by the developer/platform) and user interaction history.
*   **Invocation Selection:** The user selects a potential next invocation from the dynamic menu *before* the current preview finishes playing.
*   **Seamless Transition:**  The system queues the selected invocation’s audio (invocation + reply) *immediately* after the current preview completes, creating a seamless chained experience.  The chaining continues until the user terminates the session.
*   **Chaining Limits:** Configurable limit to chaining length to avoid infinite loops or overly long sessions.

**2. Predictive Invocation & Pre-Loading:**

*   **Contextual Analysis:**  A background process constantly analyzes the currently playing audio (using speech-to-text) and user interaction data (e.g., time spent listening, menu selections).
*   **Probability Ranking:**  The system maintains a ranked list of probable next invocations based on the contextual analysis.
*   **Pre-Loading:** The top N (configurable) probable invocations are *pre-loaded* – both invocation and reply audio are generated and stored in memory.  The pre-loaded audio is updated in real-time as the context changes.
*   **Automatic Invocation (Optional):**  With user consent, the system can *automatically* initiate the most probable invocation after the current preview completes, creating a hands-free experience. A clear visual/auditory cue should indicate the automatic invocation before it begins.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Skill Graph Database:** A database storing relationships between skills (e.g., “plays music” -> “finds podcasts”, “sets timer” -> “reminds user”).
*   **Context Engine:**  Responsible for analyzing audio, user interaction, and skill graph data to determine probable next invocations.  Utilizes machine learning models for improved accuracy.
*   **Audio Generation Service:**  Handles text-to-speech (TTS) processing and audio file creation.  Optimized for low latency and high quality.
*   **Client Application:**  Handles user interface, input processing, audio playback, and communication with the backend services.

**4. Pseudocode (Client-Side – Handling Invocation Selection & Playback):**

```
onInvocationComplete():
  displayNextInvocationMenu()

onInvocationSelected(nextSkillId):
  queueNextInvocation(nextSkillId)

queueNextInvocation(skillId):
  fetchInvocationText(skillId)
  fetchReplyText(skillId)

  generateInvocationAudio(invocationText)
  generateReplyAudio(replyText)

  playInvocationAudio()
  playReplyAudio()
  onInvocationComplete()
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Sufficient RAM to store pre-loaded audio files.
*   Fast storage (SSD) for quick access to audio data.
*   Low-latency audio output hardware.
*   Network connectivity for accessing backend services and skill graph data.
