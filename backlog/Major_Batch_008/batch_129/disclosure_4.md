## Dynamic Request Splitting & Reassembly with Adaptive Encryption

**Concept:** Extend the proxy's functionality by not just replacing encrypted data *within* a request, but by *splitting* the request into multiple streams, each with different encryption/access policies, and then reassembling them at the destination. This enables fine-grained control over data exposure and access, significantly enhancing security and compliance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Request Decomposition Module:**

*   **Input:** Original request (HTTP/HTTPS).
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Analyzes request content (headers, body) using configurable rules (regex, JSON path, schema validation).
    *   Identifies data segments requiring different security treatments.  These segments are tagged with 'policy identifiers'.
    *   Splits the request into multiple sub-requests, one for each policy identifier.
    *   Each sub-request contains *only* the data associated with its policy identifier.
    *   Metadata is added to each sub-request indicating its original position in the parent request (for reassembly).
*   **Output:**  A set of sub-requests, each with associated metadata and policy identifier.

**2. Policy Enforcement Engine:**

*   **Input:** Sub-request, Policy Identifier.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Retrieves the encryption/access policy associated with the Policy Identifier from a configurable policy store.
    *   Applies the policy to the sub-request data.  Policies can include:
        *   Encryption algorithms (AES, RSA, etc.)
        *   Key management (retrieval from HSM, KMS, etc.)
        *   Access control lists (ACLs)
        *   Data masking/redaction
    *   Optionally transforms the data (e.g., tokenization, pseudonymization).
*   **Output:**  Secured sub-request.

**3. Parallel Transmission Module:**

*   **Input:** Secured sub-requests.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Transmits each secured sub-request to its designated third-party service (determined by the sub-request metadata).
    *   Uses asynchronous communication (e.g., message queues, asynchronous HTTP requests) to maximize throughput.
*   **Output:**  Set of responses from third-party services.

**4. Request Reassembly Module:**

*   **Input:** Set of responses from third-party services, original request metadata.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Receives responses from all parallel transmissions.
    *   Reassembles the responses into a single, coherent response, according to the original request metadata.
    *   Applies any necessary post-processing (e.g., error handling, data validation).
*   **Output:** Reassembled response.

**5. Configuration & Policy Store:**

*   A centralized store for:
    *   Request decomposition rules (regex, JSON path, schema).
    *   Encryption/access policies (linked to Policy Identifiers).
    *   Third-party service mappings (based on sub-request metadata).
    *   Key management configuration.
    *   Logging/Auditing settings.



**Pseudocode - Request Decomposition Module:**

```
function decomposeRequest(request, config):
  rules = config.decompositionRules
  segments = []
  currentSegment = {}
  
  for rule in rules:
    match = findMatch(request, rule)
    if match:
      currentSegment["data"] = match
      currentSegment["policyId"] = rule.policyId
      segments.append(currentSegment)
      currentSegment = {}
  
  #Handle remaining data not matched by rules (optional)
  
  return segments
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple data replacement by allowing the request to be broken down at a granular level, enabling a dynamic and highly adaptable security model. It introduces the concept of 'Policy Identifiers' as a key mechanism for managing access and encryption. It isn't simply about *hiding* the encrypted data, but *controlling* how and where it is exposed.
