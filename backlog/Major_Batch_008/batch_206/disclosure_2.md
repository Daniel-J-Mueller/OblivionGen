**Adaptive Difficulty CAPTCHA via Physiological Signal Analysis**

**Concept:** Instead of relying on deliberately misleading or difficult challenges, the system dynamically adjusts CAPTCHA complexity based on real-time physiological data from the user. This leverages the inherent differences between human and automated agents in terms of cognitive load and physical responses.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Integration:**  System integrates with readily available consumer-grade biosensors (e.g., heart rate monitor via smartwatch, galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor, potentially basic webcam-based micro-expression analysis).  The system doesn’t *require* all sensors – it should function with a minimal viable set and degrade gracefully if sensors are unavailable.

2.  **Baseline Establishment:**  Upon initial interaction with a service protected by the CAPTCHA, the system establishes a baseline physiological profile for the user. This involves a brief 'calibration' period where the user performs simple tasks (e.g., looking at neutral images, maintaining a steady state) while physiological data is collected.

3.  **Dynamic Challenge Generation:**
    *   Challenges are generated from a pool of stimuli. These can include images, audio, simple math problems, or short text passages.
    *   Initial challenge difficulty is set to a moderate level.
    *   The system *continuously* monitors the user’s physiological response (heart rate variability, GSR, micro-expressions) *during* the challenge.

4.  **Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   **High Cognitive Load (Indicated by increased heart rate, decreased HRV, increased GSR):**  The system *reduces* challenge difficulty. The assumption is a human struggling with a task will exhibit signs of cognitive stress. A bot, even if attempting to simulate human behavior, will likely not exhibit the *same* physiological patterns.  Difficulty reduction could involve simplifying the challenge, providing hints, or increasing response time.
    *   **Low Cognitive Load (Indicated by stable or decreasing heart rate, increased HRV, stable GSR):** The system *increases* challenge difficulty.  This tests whether the user is genuinely engaging with the task or simply automating a response.
    *   **Algorithm Pseudocode:**
        ```
        while (challenge_incomplete) {
            current_physiological_state = sensor_data()
            cognitive_load = calculate_cognitive_load(current_physiological_state)
            if (cognitive_load > threshold_high) {
                difficulty = difficulty - delta_decrease
                generate_simplified_challenge(difficulty)
            } else if (cognitive_load < threshold_low) {
                difficulty = difficulty + delta_increase
                generate_complex_challenge(difficulty)
            } else {
                //Maintain current difficulty
            }
        }
        ```

5.  **Bot Detection:**  The system builds a profile of the user's physiological response *during* the CAPTCHA. A bot will likely exhibit:
    *   Relatively stable physiological parameters throughout the challenge.
    *   A lack of physiological variation correlated with changes in challenge difficulty.
    *   Anomalous physiological patterns that don't align with typical human responses.

6.  **Output:**  Based on the collected data, the system assigns a "human probability" score.  A score below a certain threshold indicates likely bot activity.

7.  **Privacy Considerations:**  All physiological data is processed locally on the user’s device whenever possible.  If data must be transmitted, it is anonymized and encrypted. Users have the option to opt-out of physiological data collection.  The system provides clear and transparent information about data collection practices.
