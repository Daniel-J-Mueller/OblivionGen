## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Predicted Workload ‘Shape’

**System Overview:**

This system aims to proactively adjust resource allocation *before* energy consumption deviates from targets, by predicting the ‘shape’ of a workload’s energy demand over time, and preemptively shifting resources. It moves beyond reacting to current consumption to anticipating future needs.

**Core Concept:**

The system learns ‘workload shapes’ – characteristic energy demand curves – using historical data. It then compares the current workload's early energy consumption pattern to these shapes to predict its future energy profile. This prediction informs resource adjustments *before* targets are missed.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Workload Shape Database:**
    *   Stores historical energy consumption data for various workload types (e.g., database query, video encoding, machine learning training).
    *   Data is normalized to a common time scale (e.g., seconds, minutes).
    *   Stores multiple instances of each workload type to capture variations.
    *   Utilizes a clustering algorithm (e.g., K-means, DBSCAN) to group similar workload shapes. The resulting clusters represent characteristic energy demand profiles.

2.  **Real-time Monitoring Agent:**
    *   Continuously monitors energy consumption of individual resources (CPU, GPU, memory, network).
    *   Samples energy consumption at a high frequency (e.g., 100ms - 1ms).
    *   Calculates rolling averages and derivatives of energy consumption to identify early trends.

3.  **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Receives real-time energy consumption data from the Monitoring Agent.
    *   Compares the current workload’s energy consumption pattern to the workload shapes in the database.
    *   Utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) to predict the future energy consumption profile. The model is trained on the historical data and fine-tuned with real-time observations.
    *   Outputs a predicted energy demand curve for the remaining execution time of the workload.

4.  **Resource Allocation Manager:**
    *   Receives the predicted energy demand curve from the Prediction Engine.
    *   Compares the predicted energy consumption to the target energy budget for the workload.
    *   Determines the necessary resource adjustments to stay within the target budget. This could involve:
        *   Dynamic frequency scaling of CPUs and GPUs.
        *   Migration of workload tasks to different physical servers or virtual machines.
        *   Adjusting the number of concurrent tasks or threads.
        *   Selective disabling of underutilized resources.
    *   Implements the resource adjustments using the system's resource management API.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Manager):**

```
function allocateResources(predictedEnergyDemand, targetEnergyBudget, currentResources):
  energyDifference = targetEnergyBudget - predictedEnergyDemand
  if energyDifference < 0:  //Predicted energy exceeds budget
    //Reduce resource allocation
    scalingFactor = energyDifference / predictedEnergyDemand
    newResources = scaleResources(currentResources, scalingFactor)
    applyResourceChanges(newResources)
  else: //Predicted energy is within budget or below
    //Potentially increase resource allocation if headroom exists
    if headroomExists():
      increasedResources = increaseResources(currentResources)
      applyResourceChanges(increasedResources)
  return currentResources
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Proactive Resource Allocation:**  Shifts the focus from reactive to proactive resource management.
*   **Workload Shape Learning:** Captures the characteristic energy demand patterns of different workloads.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Uses machine learning to forecast future energy consumption.
*   **Dynamic Scaling Factor:** Adjusts resource allocation based on the difference between predicted and target energy consumption.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Integration with Power Grid Data:**  Factor in real-time power grid conditions and pricing to optimize energy consumption.
*   **User-Specific Preferences:**  Allow users to prioritize performance or energy savings.
*   **Self-Learning System:**  Continuously improve the accuracy of the prediction model by learning from past performance.
