## Dynamic Renderer Resource Allocation & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the multi-process rendering architecture to dynamically adjust resource allocation to renderer processes *based on predicted user interaction* and proactively prefetch content *before* a user explicitly requests it. This moves beyond simply isolating render processes per tab/window to creating a highly responsive and fluid browsing experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Interaction Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Browser history (local & cloud-synced), tab/window dwell time, scrolling behavior, mouse movements (heatmaps), detected content type (video, text, images), detected user intent (form filling, searching).
*   **Model:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically an LSTM or GRU – trained on anonymized user behavior data. The RNN predicts the *next likely action* –  e.g., scrolling to the bottom of a page, clicking a link, opening a new tab, entering search terms.  Output is a probability distribution over potential user actions.
*   **Integration:**  The Interaction Prediction Module runs as a separate process, communicating with the Renderer System via an inter-process communication (IPC) channel.

**2. Dynamic Resource Allocation:**

*   **Renderer Process Priority:**  Assign a priority score to each Renderer Process based on the predicted user interaction. Processes associated with predicted high-probability actions receive higher priority (more CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
*   **Resource Scaling:**  Implement an auto-scaling mechanism. If the Interaction Prediction Module indicates an imminent need for increased rendering capacity (e.g., a video about to start playing), dynamically allocate more resources to the associated Renderer Process.  This could involve spinning up additional instances of the Renderer Process or increasing the resources allocated to existing instances.
*   **Resource Reclamation:**  If a Renderer Process is deemed unlikely to be needed soon, reclaim its resources and make them available to other processes.

**3. Predictive Prefetching:**

*   **Link Analysis:**  Analyze the content of the currently loaded page for links to other resources (images, videos, other web pages).
*   **Probability Scoring:**  Based on user history and the Interaction Prediction Module's output, assign a probability score to each link, indicating the likelihood that the user will click on it.
*   **Prefetching Queue:**  Maintain a prefetching queue, prioritizing links with the highest probability scores.
*   **Background Requests:**  Issue background requests to prefetch the resources associated with links in the queue.  Prefetched resources are cached locally.  The cache should be aware of user preferences and can be configured to avoid prefetching specific content.
*   **Resource Dedication:**  Dedicate a small percentage of network bandwidth and CPU resources to the prefetching process, ensuring that it does not interfere with the user's current browsing experience.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Prediction & Resource Allocation):**

```
// Interaction Prediction Module
function predictNextAction(userHistory, tabDwellTime, scrollingBehavior):
  // RNN model predicts next action probabilities
  actionProbabilities = RNN(userHistory, tabDwellTime, scrollingBehavior)
  return actionProbabilities

// Renderer System
function allocateResources():
  for each rendererProcess in rendererProcesses:
    userActionProbabilities = predictNextAction(rendererProcess.userHistory, rendererProcess.tabDwellTime, rendererProcess.scrollingBehavior)
    rendererProcess.priority = calculatePriority(userActionProbabilities) // Higher priority for likely actions
    adjustResources(rendererProcess) // Scale CPU, memory, network based on priority

function adjustResources(rendererProcess):
  if rendererProcess.priority > threshold:
    increaseResources(rendererProcess)
  else:
    decreaseResources(rendererProcess)
```

**Communication:**

*   The Interaction Prediction Module and Renderer System communicate via a message queue using a binary protocol for efficiency.
*   Messages include:
    *   User action events (clicks, scrolling, typing)
    *   Predicted action probabilities
    *   Resource allocation requests
    *   Prefetching requests
    *   Cache invalidation notifications.

This system aims to create a browsing experience that anticipates user needs, providing a smoother, more responsive, and more efficient experience. The predictive nature of the system should dramatically reduce loading times and improve perceived performance.
