## Dynamic Intent Stacking & Predictive Content Morphing

**Concept:** Extend the intent modeling beyond classifying *what* the user intends (action/explore) to predicting a *stack* of intents evolving over a session, then dynamically morph content *in-situ* to maximize engagement with the predicted intent stack.

**Rationale:** The patent focuses on normalizing performance *after* intent is determined. What if we predicted intent changes *before* they happen and actively shaped content to preemptively satisfy multiple, layered intentions? This moves beyond serving different content *based* on intent to *evolving* content *with* intent.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Intent Stack Model:**
    *   Input: User interaction history (clicks, dwell time, scrolls, queries, time of day, location – anonymized).
    *   Model: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells. This allows for modeling sequential dependencies in user behavior.
    *   Output: Probability distribution over an “Intent Stack” – a prioritized list of likely intents (e.g., 70% Explore - broad topic interest, 20% Action – purchase consideration, 10% Learn – detailed information seeking).  The stack depth can be dynamically adjusted.
    *   Training: Continuous online learning. Model retrained with each new user interaction.  Use a reward function that maximizes long-term engagement (e.g., session duration, number of interactions).

2.  **Content Morphing Engine:**
    *   Input: Original content (text, images, video), Intent Stack (from the Intent Stack Model).
    *   Modules:
        *   **Text Summarization/Expansion:** Dynamically condense or elaborate text based on ‘Learn’ intent.
        *   **Image Style Transfer:** Alter image aesthetics (e.g., more artistic for Explore, more product-focused for Action).
        *   **Video Highlight Reel Generation:** Create short, dynamic video clips emphasizing specific aspects based on intent.
        *   **Call-to-Action (CTA) Variation:** Swap CTAs (e.g., "Learn More" vs. "Buy Now") based on Action intent.
        *   **Information Layering:** Add/remove contextual information (e.g., product specs, reviews) based on Learn/Explore intent.
    *   Output: Morphed content optimized for the predicted Intent Stack.

3.  **A/B/n Testing & Feedback Loop:**
    *   Continuously run A/B/n tests comparing performance of morphed content vs. original content.
    *   Use reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of the Content Morphing Engine based on A/B/n test results.
    *   Monitor user feedback (explicit ratings, implicit signals like scroll depth) to refine the Intent Stack Model and Content Morphing Engine.

**Pseudocode (Content Morphing Engine):**

```
function morphContent(originalContent, intentStack):
  morphedContent = originalContent

  for each intent in intentStack:
    if intent == "Explore":
      morphedContent = applyArtisticStyleTransfer(morphedContent)
      morphedContent = shortenText(morphedContent, 20%) //Reduce cognitive load

    if intent == "Action":
      morphedContent = highlightProductFeatures(morphedContent)
      morphedContent = swapCTA(morphedContent, "Buy Now")

    if intent == "Learn":
      morphedContent = expandText(morphedContent, 30%) //Provide more detail
      morphedContent = addRelevantLinks(morphedContent)

  return morphedContent
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance servers for model training and inference.
*   GPU acceleration for image/video processing.
*   Real-time data streaming infrastructure.
*   Cloud-based storage for content and model parameters.
*   Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast content delivery.
