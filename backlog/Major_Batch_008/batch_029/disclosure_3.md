## Predictive Session Data Mirroring & Synthetic Session Generation

**Concept:** Expand predictive session data retrieval beyond just *accessing* data during a session to *mirroring* the session’s data landscape *proactively* and *synthetically* generating sessions for pre-fetching and anomaly detection.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Session Mirror:** A module that, upon session initiation (authenticated via a session key), doesn't just pre-fetch likely data, but actively mirrors the *entire* data access pattern of the customer service agent (CSA) within that session – logging *every* query to *every* source, regardless of perceived likelihood. This creates a dynamic 'shadow' of the session.
*   **Synthetic Session Generator:**  A module that leverages historical session data (mirrored sessions) to *generate* entirely synthetic sessions.  These synthetic sessions replay the actions of CSAs in similar contexts.
*   **Anomaly Detection Engine:** A module that analyzes real-time session activity *against* both mirrored sessions *and* generated synthetic sessions. Discrepancies flag potential issues (e.g., CSA error, data corruption, security breach).
*   **Dynamic Source Prioritization:**  A component that learns which data sources are consistently accessed during sessions with specific characteristics, dynamically adjusting pre-fetching priority.

**II. Data Flow & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Session Initiation:**
    *   CSA logs in, session key generated.
    *   `SESSION_KEY = generate_session_key()`
    *   `SESSION_ID = create_session_id(SESSION_KEY)`
    *   `initialize_session_mirror(SESSION_ID, SESSION_KEY)`
    *   `initialize_synthetic_session_generator(SESSION_KEY)`

2.  **Real-Time Session Monitoring & Mirroring:**

    *   For each CSA query:
        *   `query_data = receive_query()`
        *   `source = determine_data_source(query_data)`
        *   `log_query(SESSION_ID, source, query_data)` // Mirroring
        *   `response = execute_query(query_data)`
        *   `transmit_response()`

3.  **Synthetic Session Generation (Background Process):**

    *   `historical_sessions = retrieve_similar_sessions(SESSION_KEY)`
    *   For each `historical_session`:
        *   `synthetic_query = generate_synthetic_query(historical_session)`
        *   `synthetic_response = execute_query(synthetic_query)`
        *   `store_synthetic_response(SESSION_ID, synthetic_response)` // Pre-fetch and cache

4.  **Anomaly Detection (Continuous):**

    *   `current_query = receive_query()`
    *   `predicted_response = retrieve_predicted_response(current_query)` // From synthetic sessions
    *   `actual_response = execute_query(current_query)`
    *   `anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(predicted_response, actual_response)`
    *   If `anomaly_score > threshold`:
        *   `trigger_alert()`

**III. Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   **Scalable Data Store:** High-performance storage for mirrored session data and synthetic responses.  In-memory caching critical.
*   **Distributed Processing:**  Anomaly detection and synthetic session generation must be parallelizable.
*   **API Integration:** Seamless integration with existing data sources and CRM systems.
*   **Machine Learning Engine:**  Anomaly detection benefits from ML models trained on historical session data.

**IV. Novelty:**

This moves beyond predictive pre-fetching to *proactive mirroring* and *synthetic session generation*.  The ability to compare live sessions against a dynamic baseline of mirrored and synthetic activity unlocks advanced anomaly detection capabilities, enabling earlier identification of errors, fraud, or data inconsistencies. It’s not just about anticipating needs, but about *understanding* deviations from expected behavior.
