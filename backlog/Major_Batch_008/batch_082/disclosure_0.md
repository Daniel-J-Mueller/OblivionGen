## Predictive Test Prioritization via Simulated Mutation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple code coverage mapping to *actively simulate* potential mutations in the code and assess which tests would likely *detect* those mutations. This moves from reactive test selection (based on what *was* covered) to proactive test prioritization (based on what *could* go wrong).

**Specifications:**

**1. Mutation Engine:**

*   **Function:** Introduces controlled, realistic mutations into the codebase.
*   **Mutation Types:**
    *   Arithmetic Operator Replacement (+, -, \*, /)
    *   Relational Operator Replacement (>, <, ==, !=)
    *   Logical Operator Replacement (&&, ||, !)
    *   Constant Value Alteration (small random changes)
    *   Statement Deletion (with configurable probability)
    *   Conditional Branch Inversion (if/else swap)
*   **Mutation Scope:**  Configurable – can target specific files, functions, or code blocks.  Prioritize mutations in recently modified code sections.
*   **Mutation Output:**  Creates multiple mutated versions of the codebase – each with a single mutation applied.

**2. Test Execution & Mutation Detection:**

*   **Test Harness:** Utilizes the existing test suite.
*   **Execution Loop:**
    1.  Select a mutated codebase version.
    2.  Execute the *entire* test suite against the mutated code.
    3.  Record which tests *fail* (detect the mutation).
    4.  Record test execution time for each test.
*   **Mutation Score:** Assign each test a 'Mutation Score' based on:
    *   Number of mutations detected by the test.
    *   Severity of the detected mutations (configurable severity levels based on mutation type).
    *   Test execution time (penalize slow tests).
    *   Historical failure rate of the test (tests that frequently fail are less reliable detectors).

**3. Test Prioritization Algorithm:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Mutation Scores for all tests.
    *   List of modified files/code blocks in the new code version.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Identify tests with the highest Mutation Scores.
    2.  Filter these tests to prioritize those that are likely to cover the modified code (using the existing coverage mapping data).
    3.  Sort the remaining tests based on a combined score: `(Mutation Score * Coverage Weight) + (Execution Time Weight)`.  (Weights are configurable).
    4.  Output the prioritized test list.

**4. System Integration:**

*   **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**  Trigger mutation testing and test prioritization as part of the CI/CD process.
*   **Test Runner Integration:**  The prioritized test list is fed into the test runner to execute the tests in the optimal order.
*   **Reporting & Visualization:** Provide a dashboard to visualize mutation scores, test coverage, and test prioritization results.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function prioritizeTests(modifiedCode, testSuite, mutationEngine) {
  mutatedCodeVersions = mutationEngine.generateMutations(modifiedCode);
  testResults = runTestsAgainstMutations(testSuite, mutatedCodeVersions);
  mutationScores = calculateMutationScores(testResults);
  coveredTests = getCoverageMapping(testSuite, modifiedCode);
  prioritizedTests = sortTests(mutationScores, coveredTests);
  return prioritizedTests;
}

function sortTests(mutationScores, coveredTests) {
  for each test in testSuite {
    score = (mutationScores[test] * CoverageWeight) + (ExecutionTimeWeight / test.ExecutionTime);
    sortedTests.add(test, score);
  }
  sortedTests.sortByScore();
  return sortedTests;
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on test selection based on *observed* coverage. This system proactively simulates code defects and prioritizes tests based on their ability to *detect* those defects, improving the robustness of the testing process.
