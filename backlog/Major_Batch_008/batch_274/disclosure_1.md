## Multi-Spectral Impact Mapping & Material Degradation Assessment

**Concept:** Expand impact detection beyond simple misalignment to incorporate multi-spectral imaging to identify *material changes* resulting from impacts – not just that an impact occurred, but *how* the device was damaged. Further, integrate this data with an AI to predict component failure based on impact severity and material degradation.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate a multi-spectral camera array alongside the existing dual-camera system. Minimum spectral bands: visible (RGB), near-infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR). Optimal configuration: 6-8 bands spanning 400nm – 1700nm.
*   **Impact Event Trigger:** Utilize the existing misalignment detection algorithms *as a preliminary trigger*. Any misalignment exceeding a threshold initiates multi-spectral data capture.
*   **Data Acquisition Protocol:** Upon impact trigger:
    *   Simultaneous capture from all cameras (existing & multi-spectral).
    *   High-speed capture mode (minimum 30fps for 2-3 seconds post-impact).
    *   Automated white balance and exposure calibration across all cameras.
*   **Image Pre-processing Pipeline:**
    *   Geometric correction: Align multi-spectral images to the existing camera images.
    *   Radiometric calibration: Convert raw sensor data to reflectance values.
    *   Noise reduction: Apply appropriate filtering techniques (e.g., Gaussian blur, median filter).
*   **Damage Signature Extraction:**
    *   Spectral angle mapper (SAM): Compare post-impact spectra to pre-defined baseline spectra for common device materials (e.g., glass, plastic, aluminum).
    *   Feature extraction: Identify spectral features indicative of material changes (e.g., cracks, delamination, subsurface damage).
    *   Automated defect detection: Employ machine learning algorithms to identify and classify damage types.
*   **AI-Powered Failure Prediction:**
    *   Training data: Large dataset of impact events with corresponding material analysis and component failure data.
    *   Model architecture: Convolutional neural network (CNN) with recurrent layers to capture temporal dependencies.
    *   Prediction output: Probability of failure for each critical component (e.g., display, battery, processor) within a specified timeframe.
*   **Notification System:**
    *   Detailed impact report: Display a visualization of the impact location, severity, and identified damage types.
    *   Failure prediction warning: Alert the user if a component is predicted to fail within a certain timeframe.
    *   Recommended actions: Provide guidance on whether to seek repair or replacement.

**Pseudocode (Damage Signature Extraction):**

```
function extract_damage_signature(impact_images):
    baseline_spectra = load_baseline_spectra()
    for each impact_image in impact_images:
        processed_image = preprocess_image(impact_image)
        spectral_data = extract_spectral_data(processed_image)
        similarity_score = calculate_similarity(spectral_data, baseline_spectra)
        if similarity_score < threshold:
            damage_type = identify_damage_type(spectral_data)
            report_damage(damage_type)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simple impact *detection* to material *assessment* and predictive *failure analysis*. The combination of multi-spectral imaging, AI-powered analysis, and proactive notification system offers a significantly more robust and informative solution.
