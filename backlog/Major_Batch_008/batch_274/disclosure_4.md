## Decentralized Key Derivation with Biometric Anchoring

**Concept:** Enhance security and user experience by anchoring encryption key derivation to decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and biometric authentication, moving beyond server-reliance for key material validation. This moves the trust anchor to the user, leveraging on-device capabilities.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Decentralized Identifier (DID) Provider:**  A network (potentially blockchain-based, but not strictly required) managing DIDs for users.  The DID acts as a universally resolvable, user-controlled identifier.
*   **Biometric Authentication Module:** On-device module (fingerprint, facial recognition, voiceprint) providing strong user authentication.
*   **Local Encryption Manager:** On-device module responsible for key generation, encryption/decryption, and secure storage.  
*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):** A cryptographically secure KDF, but modified to incorporate DID and biometric data.
*   **Remote Attestation Service:** Optional service verifying device integrity and software authenticity.

**II. Key Derivation Process:**

1.  **DID Provisioning:** User obtains a DID. This could involve a centralized service initially, but the goal is user control.
2.  **Initial Key Generation:** 
    *   The Local Encryption Manager generates a random seed.
    *   User authenticates via the Biometric Authentication Module.
    *   The seed, biometric data (a hashed representation of the biometric scan, *not* the raw data), and the DID are input into the KDF.
    *   The KDF outputs a master encryption key.
3.  **Subsequent Key Derivation:**
    *   User authenticates via Biometric Authentication Module.
    *   The KDF re-derives application-specific encryption keys from the master key, incorporating the current biometric data and a unique application identifier. This prevents key reuse across applications.
4.  **Key Storage:** The master key remains encrypted on the device, protected by the biometric authentication process. Application-specific keys are derived on demand and held in memory only for the duration of application use.

**III. Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```pseudocode
function deriveEncryptionKey(did, biometricData, applicationId, masterKey):
  //Input: User DID, current biometric data (hashed), application ID, master encryption key
  //Output: Application-specific encryption key

  salt = generateRandomSalt()
  combinedInput = did + biometricData + applicationId + salt
  applicationKey = KDF(masterKey, combinedInput)

  return applicationKey
```

**IV. Remote Attestation Integration (Optional):**

*   Before initial key generation, the device can initiate a remote attestation request to a trusted server.
*   The server verifies the device's software integrity and configuration.
*   Upon successful attestation, the server provides a signed attestation token.
*   The attestation token is included as input to the KDF during initial key generation, adding a layer of trust.

**V. Security Considerations:**

*   **Biometric Spoofing:** Mitigation through advanced biometric sensors and liveness detection techniques.
*   **KDF Strength:** Utilizing a robust and well-vetted KDF algorithm (e.g., Argon2, scrypt).
*   **Secure Enclave:** Leveraging secure enclaves (e.g., Apple's Secure Enclave, Android's StrongBox) to protect the master key and biometric data.
*   **DID Management:** Ensuring secure DID storage and recovery mechanisms.



This design shifts the security focus from centralized servers to the user's device and biometric authentication, reducing reliance on external services and enhancing user control over their data. The use of DIDs provides a universally resolvable identifier, enabling interoperability and user ownership.
