## Adaptive Intent Pruning via Bayesian Networks

**Concept:** Enhance NLU domain selection by dynamically pruning unlikely intent categories *before* full processing, using a Bayesian network to model relationships between query features and intent likelihood. This goes beyond simple thresholding in claim 14 by modeling *dependencies* between intents and features.

**Specs:**

1.  **Feature Extraction Module:**
    *   Input: Raw query text.
    *   Output: Feature vector (e.g., bag-of-words, TF-IDF, word embeddings, POS tags).
    *   Implementation: Standard NLP techniques.

2.  **Bayesian Network (BN) Structure:**
    *   Nodes:
        *   Intent Nodes: One node per potential intent category (e.g., "play music", "set alarm", "send message").
        *   Feature Nodes: One node per significant feature extracted from the query.
    *   Edges: Directed edges representing probabilistic dependencies.  Example:  The presence of "volume up" might *increase* the probability of the "play music" intent and *decrease* the probability of “set alarm”.  Dependencies will be learned (see training).

3.  **BN Parameter Learning:**
    *   Data: Large corpus of query/intent pairs.
    *   Algorithm: Structure learning algorithms (e.g., Hill-Climbing, Tabu Search) to discover the optimal network structure. Parameter estimation via Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) or Bayesian estimation.  The BN is continuously retrained as new data becomes available.

4.  **Intent Pruning Module:**
    *   Input: Feature vector, Trained Bayesian Network.
    *   Process:
        1.  Evidence Propagation: Input the feature vector as evidence into the BN.
        2.  Marginal Probability Calculation: Calculate the marginal probability of each intent node.
        3.  Pruning: Apply a dynamic threshold (described below) to the calculated probabilities. Intents below the threshold are *removed* from further processing.
    *   Dynamic Threshold: The threshold isn't fixed. It's calculated based on the overall entropy of the intent probability distribution. Higher entropy = more uncertainty = lower threshold. The goal is to aggressively prune unlikely intents without discarding potentially relevant ones in ambiguous cases. Formula: `Threshold = α * Entropy(Intent Probabilities)`, where α is a tunable parameter.

5.  **Integration with Existing NLU Pipeline:**
    *   The pruned list of intents is then fed into the existing NLU components (as in claim 1). This significantly reduces the computational load, especially when dealing with a large number of potential intents.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function prune_intents(query_text, bn, α):
  features = extract_features(query_text)
  intent_probabilities = inference(bn, features)  // Run BN inference

  entropy = calculate_entropy(intent_probabilities)
  threshold = α * entropy

  pruned_intents = []
  for intent, probability in intent_probabilities:
    if probability >= threshold:
      pruned_intents.append(intent)

  return pruned_intents
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   BN inference can be accelerated using GPUs.
*   The trained BN can be stored in memory for fast access.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency: Faster NLU processing due to fewer intents being processed.
*   Improved accuracy: By focusing on the most likely intents, the system can allocate more resources to accurate intent classification.
*   Scalability: The system can handle a larger number of potential intents without sacrificing performance.
*   Adaptability: The BN can be continuously retrained to adapt to changing user behavior and new intent categories.
