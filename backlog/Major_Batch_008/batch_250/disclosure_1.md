**Adaptive Emissive Backlighting with Dynamic Texture Mapping**

**Concept:** Expanding on the light guide and LED array, this design moves beyond simple color mixing to create a dynamic, fully emissive backlight capable of displaying textures and subtle animations *behind* a display panel. Think of it as a low-resolution, fully-backlit e-ink display existing *beneath* traditional LCD or OLED.

**Specs:**

*   **Light Guide Material:** Transparent polymer with embedded micro-LEDs.  Not just surface features, but *integrated* LEDs throughout the volume of the guide. Density: 5-10 LEDs per square centimeter, variable based on desired resolution.
*   **LED Type:**  Micro-LEDs capable of full-color output (RGB). Individual addressability is critical.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated GPU/processor to manage the micro-LED array.  Requires a high refresh rate (120Hz+) to enable smooth animations.
*   **Layered Structure:**
    1.  Display Panel (LCD/OLED)
    2.  Air Gap (for thermal dissipation and parallax effect)
    3.  Emissive Backlight Layer (Micro-LED array within transparent polymer)
    4.  Diffusion Layer (thin, to maintain brightness and even light distribution)
*   **Texture Mapping Algorithm:** Procedural generation of textures (e.g., wood grain, metal, fabric) and animations to be displayed on the backlight. Texture resolution is independent of the display panel resolution.  Algorithm parameters are adjustable to create varying degrees of detail and complexity.
*   **Ambient Light Sensor:** Integrated sensor to dynamically adjust backlight brightness and color temperature based on environmental conditions.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:**  Micro-vibrations synchronized with backlight animations to create tactile effects. (Optional)
*   **Power:** Wireless power transmission via resonant inductive coupling.

**Pseudocode (Texture Generation):**

```
function generateTexture(textureType, parameters):
    if textureType == "woodGrain":
        // Perlin noise algorithm to generate grain pattern
        grainPattern = perlinNoise(x, y, scale, octaves)
        color = blend(amber, brown, grainPattern)
        return color
    else if textureType == "metalScratches":
        // Voronoi diagram to create scratch patterns
        scratchPattern = voronoiDiagram(x, y, seed)
        color = blend(silver, gray, scratchPattern)
        return color
    else if textureType == "waterRipple":
        // Sine wave algorithm to generate ripple effect
        rippleEffect = sineWave(x, y, time, amplitude, frequency)
        color = blend(blue, white, rippleEffect)
        return color
    else:
        return black
```

**Innovation:**

The key innovation lies in the transition from a static light guide to a fully emissive, dynamic backlight.  This moves beyond simply illuminating the display to *augmenting* the visual experience with textured lighting effects. Imagine a game with rain appearing to flow *behind* the screen, or a movie with a fireplace visually extending beyond the display borders. Itâ€™s about creating a sense of depth and immersion through dynamic lighting.

This is a departure from the current patent's static surface feature approach, focusing instead on a dynamic, volumetric light source with programmable textures and animations.
