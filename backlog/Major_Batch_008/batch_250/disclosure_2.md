**Personalized Recommendation Ecosystem with Dynamic Social Weighting**

**Core Concept:** Expand beyond purchase history sharing to create a dynamically weighted social recommendation ecosystem. Users not only share purchase data (as in the provided patent), but also *qualitative* preference data and social connections. This data is then used to create personalized recommendations *and* to weight the influence of different users on each other.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition Module:**
    *   Implicit Data: Purchase history, browsing behavior, time spent viewing items, clicks.
    *   Explicit Data: User ratings (stars, thumbs up/down), textual reviews, preference tags (e.g., “eco-friendly,” “minimalist,” “high-performance”).
    *   Social Graph: User-defined connections (friends, followers, trusted advisors). Allow users to assign 'trust weights' to their connections (e.g., a close friend gets a higher weight than a casual acquaintance).
*   **Preference Vector Generation:**  Each user’s data is transformed into a high-dimensional preference vector.
    *   Purchase history contributes to item-feature weighting.
    *   Explicit ratings directly impact feature weighting.
    *   Preference tags add categorical dimensions.
*   **Social Weighting Algorithm:**
    *   For each user A, calculate a “social influence score” for each of their connections B.
    *   Influence Score = (Trust Weight * Similarity Score)
    *   Similarity Score is calculated based on the cosine similarity between the preference vectors of A and B.
    *   Normalize influence scores to sum to 1.
*   **Recommendation Engine:**
    *   Item scoring is a weighted sum of:
        *   User’s own preference vector’s dot product with the item’s feature vector.
        *   Weighted average of recommendations from trusted connections, using their social influence scores.
    *   The system incorporates ‘serendipity’ by occasionally surfacing items with low initial scores but high potential based on social network trends.
*   **Privacy & Control:**
    *   Granular privacy settings: Users can control which data is shared, with whom, and for what purpose.
    *   "Data Transparency Dashboard": Visualizes how data is being used to generate recommendations and influence scores.
    *   "Social Firewall": Allows users to block or mute specific connections.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   Open API for third-party developers to create social recommendation apps and integrate with other platforms.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
function recommendItems(user):
  userPreferenceVector = getUserPreferenceVector(user)
  socialConnections = getUserSocialConnections(user)
  weightedRecommendations = []

  # Calculate weighted average of recommendations from social connections
  for connection in socialConnections:
    connectionInfluenceScore = calculateConnectionInfluenceScore(user, connection)
    connectionRecommendations = getRecommendationsForUser(connection)
    weightedRecommendations.extend(connectionRecommendations * connectionInfluenceScore)

  # Combine user's own preferences with weighted social recommendations
  combinedRecommendations = userPreferenceVector + weightedRecommendations

  # Sort recommendations by score
  sortedRecommendations = sortRecommendations(combinedRecommendations)

  return sortedRecommendations
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond simple purchase history sharing to create a dynamic social recommendation ecosystem. The integration of trust weights and a social influence algorithm allows for more personalized and relevant recommendations. The privacy and control features ensure user data is protected and used responsibly.
