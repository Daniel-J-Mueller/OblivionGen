## Adaptive Model Weighting via Bayesian Optimization & Real-Time Drift Detection

**Concept:** Extend the cross-validation framework to dynamically adjust model weights within an ensemble *during* real-time forecasting. Instead of selecting a single "optimal" model, maintain a weighted average of models from the family, and continuously refine these weights based on incoming data and detected model drift.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Ensemble Initialization:**
    *   Train all forecasting models within the family using the standard cross-validation procedure outlined in the patent.
    *   Assign initial weights to each model (e.g., equal weights, weights based on cross-validation performance).
    *   Establish a 'drift threshold' parameter - a sensitivity value defining the magnitude of performance change required to trigger model weight adjustments.

2.  **Real-Time Forecasting Loop:**
    *   Receive a new observation (time series data point).
    *   Generate individual forecasts from *each* model in the ensemble, using the latest available data.
    *   Calculate a weighted average forecast:
        `Forecast = Î£ (Weight_i * Forecast_i)`  (where 'i' iterates through all models in the ensemble).

3.  **Drift Detection Module:**
    *   Maintain a rolling window of recent observations.
    *   For each model, calculate a performance metric (e.g., MSE, MAE) on this rolling window.
    *   Compare the current performance metric to a baseline (e.g., performance from the initial cross-validation, or a moving average of recent performance).
    *   If the performance change exceeds the drift threshold, flag the model for weight adjustment.

4.  **Bayesian Optimization Weight Refinement:**
    *   Upon drift detection, initiate a Bayesian Optimization (BO) loop.
    *   **Objective Function:**  Minimize a prediction error metric (e.g., MSE) on a small, recently observed validation set.
    *   **Parameters:** The weights assigned to each model in the ensemble (constrained to sum to 1).
    *   **BO Algorithm:** Utilize a Gaussian Process or Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to efficiently explore the weight parameter space.
    *   After each BO iteration, evaluate the new weight configuration on the validation set and update the weights accordingly.

5.  **Adaptive Thresholding:**
    *   Monitor the frequency of weight adjustments.
    *   If adjustments are occurring too frequently (indicating instability), increase the drift threshold.
    *   If adjustments are infrequent, decrease the drift threshold.

**Pseudocode (Weight Refinement Loop):**

```
function refine_weights(models, recent_observations, weights, drift_threshold):
  for model in models:
    performance = calculate_performance(model, recent_observations)
    if abs(performance - baseline_performance[model]) > drift_threshold:
      # Initiate Bayesian Optimization
      bo_result = bayesian_optimize(
        objective_function=prediction_error,
        parameter_space=weights,
        iterations=10  # Number of BO iterations
      )
      # Update weights with the optimized weights from BO
      weights = bo_result.optimized_weights
      baseline_performance[model] = performance #Update baseline
  return weights
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires sufficient computational resources to run multiple models and the BO algorithm concurrently.
*   A robust data streaming pipeline is necessary for real-time data ingestion and processing.
*   Consider using a dedicated BO library (e.g., scikit-optimize, GPyOpt).
