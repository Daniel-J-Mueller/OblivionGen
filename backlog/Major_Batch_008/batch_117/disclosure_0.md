## Dynamic Policy Sandboxing with Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the policy verification system to not just *detect* overly permissive policies, but to actively sandbox and dynamically adjust permissions *during* API call execution based on real-time attestation of the calling entity and the resource being accessed. This goes beyond static policy evaluation.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Attestation Module Integration:**
    *   Integrate with a remote attestation service (e.g., using TPMs, SGX, or cloud provider attestation).
    *   Upon receiving an API call, before policy evaluation, request an attestation report for the calling principal (user, service, VM) and the target resource (database, file, API endpoint).
    *   Attestation report should include trust level (high, medium, low), software/firmware versions, and cryptographic signatures.

2.  **Dynamic Permission Broker:**
    *   Introduce a "Permission Broker" that sits between the API gateway and the backend services.
    *   Permission Broker receives the API call, attestation reports, and the initial policy.
    *   Based on the attestation data and a configurable trust policy, the Permission Broker dynamically adjusts the effective permissions *before* granting access to the backend service.
    *   Adjustments can include:
        *   Reducing access scope (e.g., read-only access instead of read-write).
        *   Adding extra conditions (e.g., requiring multi-factor authentication).
        *   Denying access altogether.

3.  **Policy Augmentation with Attestation Criteria:**
    *   Extend the policy language to include attestation criteria. Example:
        ```
        policy "access_data" {
          principal = "user1";
          resource = "database_x";
          action = "read";
          condition {
            attestation_level >= "medium";
            resource_firmware_version == "1.2.3";
          }
        }
        ```
    *   The policy evaluation engine must be able to interpret and apply these attestation-based conditions.

4.  **Real-time Mitigation & Response:**
    *   If attestation fails or trust levels are low, the Permission Broker automatically activates mitigation routines (e.g., deny access, trigger alerts, require additional authentication).
    *   Implement a response system that allows administrators to define custom actions based on attestation events.

5.  **Workflow Pseudocode:**
    ```
    On API Call Received:
      1. Request Attestation Report for Principal & Resource
      2.  If Attestation Fails:
            a. Activate Default Mitigation (e.g., Deny Access)
            b. Log Event & Alert Administrator
            c. Return Error to Caller
            d. Exit

      3.  Retrieve Initial Policy for API Call
      4.  Evaluate Policy with Attestation Data
      5.  If Policy Allows Access:
            a. Adjust Permissions Based on Trust Level (e.g., reduce scope for low trust)
            b. Forward API Call with Adjusted Permissions to Backend Service
      6.  If Policy Denies Access:
            a. Activate Mitigation Routine
            b. Log Event & Alert Administrator
            c. Return Error to Caller
    ```

6.  **Technical Considerations:**
    *   Performance overhead of attestation requests must be minimized (e.g., caching, asynchronous requests).
    *   Attestation service must be highly available and secure.
    *   Policy language and evaluation engine must be scalable to handle a large number of policies and attestation criteria.
    *   Integration with existing identity and access management (IAM) systems.
