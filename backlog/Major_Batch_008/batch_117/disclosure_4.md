## Dynamic Request Mutation for Chaos Engineering

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to not just *replay* production requests, but to *mutate* them in real-time, introducing controlled chaos to evaluate system resilience. This goes beyond load testing to actively probe failure boundaries and emergent behavior.

**Specs:**

*   **Mutation Profiles:** Define sets of transformations applicable to request data. Examples:
    *   **Value Range Shift:**  Increment/decrement numerical fields by a percentage or fixed amount.
    *   **Field Swapping:**  Exchange the values of two related fields.
    *   **Data Type Corruption:**  Introduce invalid data types (e.g., string to integer).
    *   **Field Injection:** Add new, unexpected fields to requests.
    *   **Delay Injection:** Introduce artificial latency in request/response cycles.
    *   **Rate Limiting Emulation:** Simulate sudden bursts or drops in request rates.
*   **Mutation Engine:** A component integrated into the worker nodes responsible for applying mutation profiles to captured request data before replay.
*   **Mutation Plan:** A configuration defining:
    *   The mutation profile(s) to apply.
    *   The probability of applying mutations to each request.
    *   The severity of mutations (e.g., the range of value shifts).
    *   Targeted request types (filter by request attributes).
*   **Chaos Dashboard:** A UI providing real-time visualization of mutation activity, system metrics (error rates, latency), and the impact of mutations.
*   **Automated Feedback Loop:**  Integrate the Chaos Dashboard with the auto-shutdown module. If the mutation plan triggers a critical system failure, the auto-shutdown module should automatically reduce the mutation severity or halt the test.

**Pseudocode (Worker Node - Mutation Logic):**

```
function process_request(request_data):
  if random() < mutation_probability:
    mutated_request_data = apply_mutation(request_data, current_mutation_profile)
  else:
    mutated_request_data = request_data

  send_request_to_production_service(mutated_request_data)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MutationProfile`: {`mutation_type`: string, `parameters`: dictionary}
*   `MutationPlan`: {`target_request_types`: list, `mutation_profiles`: list, `mutation_probability`: float}

**Novelty:**  This isn't just about reproducing load. Itâ€™s about *proactively* breaking the system in controlled ways to discover vulnerabilities before they impact real users.  Existing load testing tools primarily focus on scaling. This focuses on *robustness*. The automated feedback loop with the auto-shutdown module allows for self-regulating chaos testing, maximizing the information gained while minimizing disruption.
