## Adaptive Visual Password Complexity via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the complexity of the visual password selection process (number of images, similarity of distractors) based on real-time user biofeedback – specifically, galvanic skin response (GSR) and pupil dilation. The goal is to create a system that maximizes security *and* minimizes user frustration by adapting to individual cognitive load.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard user device (smartphone, tablet, computer) with camera and touchscreen.
*   GSR sensor (integrated into device or wearable).
*   Eye-tracking capability (via camera and software).

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Baseline Calibration:**
    *   Upon initial setup, the system collects baseline GSR and pupil dilation data while the user engages in a neutral activity (e.g., viewing static images).
    *   Establishes a "comfort zone" for each user.

2.  **Password Selection Process:**
    *   Initial set of test images (containing and not containing the visual password) are generated as per the base patent.
    *   During image selection, continuously monitor GSR and pupil dilation.
    *   **Complexity Adjustment Logic:**
        *   **High GSR/Pupil Dilation (Stress):** If GSR/Pupil Dilation exceeds a threshold (relative to baseline), *reduce* complexity. This means:
            *   Decrease the number of images presented.
            *   Increase the visual difference between the password images and the distractors.
            *   Potentially offer a “hint” (e.g., a color overlay indicating possible matches).
        *   **Low GSR/Pupil Dilation (Boredom/Easy):** If GSR/Pupil Dilation is consistently low, *increase* complexity. This means:
            *   Increase the number of images presented.
            *   Decrease the visual difference between the password images and the distractors.
            *   Introduce more subtle distractors.
        *   **Adaptive Algorithm:** Employ a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller to smoothly adjust the complexity level in response to biofeedback data.

3.  **Security Logging:**
    *   Log the complexity level used for each authentication attempt.
    *   Flag instances where the system had to significantly reduce complexity to accommodate the user, indicating a potential vulnerability (e.g., a user who is easily stressed may be susceptible to social engineering).

4.  **Data Analysis & Personalization:**
    *   Collect anonymized biofeedback data to improve the algorithm's ability to personalize the authentication experience.
    *   Identify patterns in user behavior that can be used to proactively adjust the complexity level.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
baselineGSR = GetBaselineGSR();
baselinePupilDilation = GetBaselinePupilDilation();
complexityLevel = InitialComplexityLevel;

//Authentication Loop
while(AuthenticationSuccessful == false) {
    GenerateImageSets(complexityLevel);
    DisplayImagesToUser();
    userSelection = GetUserSelection();
    
    currentGSR = GetCurrentGSR();
    currentPupilDilation = GetCurrentPupilDilation();
    
    stressLevel = CalculateStressLevel(currentGSR, currentPupilDilation, baselineGSR, baselinePupilDilation);
    
    if (stressLevel > StressThreshold) {
        complexityLevel = DecreaseComplexity(complexityLevel);
    } else if (stressLevel < BoredomThreshold) {
        complexityLevel = IncreaseComplexity(complexityLevel);
    }
    
    if(ValidateUserSelection(userSelection)){
        AuthenticationSuccessful = true;
    }
}

//Functions
function CalculateStressLevel(currentGSR, currentPupilDilation, baselineGSR, baselinePupilDilation) {
    // Implement a formula to calculate stress level based on biofeedback data.
    // Could involve normalization, weighting, and combination of signals.
    return stressLevel;
}

function DecreaseComplexity(complexityLevel) {
    // Reduce the number of images, increase the visual difference between images.
    return newComplexityLevel;
}

function IncreaseComplexity(complexityLevel) {
    // Increase the number of images, decrease the visual difference between images.
    return newComplexityLevel;
}
