## Adaptive Keymap Sharding with Predictive Relocation

**Concept:** Extend the consistent hashing scheme with a predictive relocation mechanism. Instead of solely reacting to node additions/removals, proactively anticipate future capacity needs and begin redistributing keymap data *before* resources are fully exhausted. This leverages machine learning to predict load imbalances and optimizes for minimized data movement during scaling events.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Predictive Load Modeling:**
    *   Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) trained on historical keymap coordinator load data (CPU usage, memory consumption, request latency).
    *   Input features: Time of day, day of week, seasonal trends, request rate, object creation/deletion rate.
    *   Output: Predicted load for each keymap coordinator over a configurable time horizon (e.g., next hour, next day).
2.  **Dynamic Sharding Adjustment:**
    *   Define a "threshold" load level.  When a coordinator's predicted load exceeds this threshold, initiate a *preemptive* key range migration.
    *   Key range selection: Migrate ranges with the *lowest* access frequency (tracked via a bloom filter or similar mechanism) to underutilized coordinators. This minimizes disruption.
    *   Migration strategy: Utilize a "shadowing" approach. New writes for migrated key ranges are directed to *both* the old and new coordinators for a defined period.  Reads can also be similarly shadowed. This guarantees consistency during migration and enables rollback if necessary.
3.  **Coordinator Affinity Modeling:**
    *   Track request patterns to identify object key "affinity" â€“  groups of keys frequently accessed together.
    *   During migration, prioritize keeping related key ranges on the same coordinator or minimizing network hops between them. This can be achieved through a constraint-satisfaction problem (CSP) solver that optimizes migration based on affinity scores and network topology.
4.  **Adaptive Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Continuously monitor the impact of dynamic sharding on overall system performance (latency, throughput).
    *   Employ a reinforcement learning agent to adjust the "threshold" load level dynamically, seeking to maximize system efficiency while minimizing migration frequency.
5.  **Implementation Details:**
    *   Integrate with existing consistent hashing scheme.  Treat predictive relocation as an optimization layer *on top* of the base hashing algorithm.
    *   Utilize a distributed task scheduler (e.g., Kubernetes Jobs, Apache Mesos) to manage migration tasks.
    *   Expose metrics for monitoring: Prediction accuracy, migration frequency, migration duration, impact on system latency.

**Pseudocode (Migration Task):**

```
function migrateKeyRange(oldCoordinator, newCoordinator, keyRange):
  // 1. Shadow writes to both coordinators for a period (e.g., 1 hour)
  startShadowing(oldCoordinator, newCoordinator, keyRange)

  // 2. Monitor shadow writes for consistency (checksums, etc.)

  // 3. Once shadowing is complete and consistent, stop writes to oldCoordinator

  // 4. Redirect all reads for keyRange to newCoordinator

  // 5. After a grace period, remove keyRange from oldCoordinator
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `KeyRange`: (startHash, endHash, accessFrequency, currentCoordinator)
*   `CoordinatorLoadPrediction`: (coordinatorId, timestamp, predictedLoad)
*   `AffinityMatrix`: (keyId1, keyId2, affinityScore)
