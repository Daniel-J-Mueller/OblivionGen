## Distributed Sensory Fusion with Predictive Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the spatial indexing approach to incorporate *temporal* data and *predictive* pre-fetching of index partitions. Instead of solely reacting to a cache miss, proactively anticipate likely queries based on sensor data streams and pre-load relevant index partitions. This creates a more fluid and responsive object recognition system, especially in dynamic environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Data Integration:**

*   **Data Source:** Integrate time-series data from sensors alongside embedding vectors.  This includes timestamps, velocity vectors (if applicable – e.g., camera pan/tilt, object movement), and potentially environmental factors (lighting, weather).
*   **Temporal Embedding:** Create a ‘temporal embedding’ for each embedding vector. This embedding captures the time-series characteristics of the sensor data associated with that vector. Use a recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer model to encode the time-series into a fixed-size vector. The RNN/Transformer is trained to predict future sensor states based on past observations.
*   **Modified Similarity Criterion:** The similarity criterion used for partition traversal now incorporates both embedding vector similarity *and* temporal embedding similarity. A query vector is considered a match only if both embeddings are sufficiently similar.

**2. Predictive Partitioning:**

*   **Prediction Model:** Train a prediction model (e.g., a Long Short-Term Memory network - LSTM, or a Gated Recurrent Unit - GRU) that predicts future likely queries based on current and historical sensor data. The input to the model is the time-series of embedding vectors, timestamps, and other sensor data. The output is a probability distribution over potential index partitions.
*   **Partition Prefetching:**  Based on the prediction model’s output, proactively prefetch the most likely index partitions to the sensor-proximity resource’s cache. Implement a caching policy that balances prediction accuracy with cache capacity. A confidence threshold can be used to control the aggressiveness of prefetching.
*   **Dynamic Partition Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the pre-fetched partitions based on real-time query patterns.  If the prediction model consistently mispredicts, the system should adapt by increasing the diversity of pre-fetched partitions.

**3. Adaptive Partition Granularity:**

*   **Multi-Level Index:** Implement a multi-level spatial index. The top level contains coarse-grained partitions, while lower levels contain increasingly fine-grained partitions.
*   **Dynamic Granularity Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the granularity of pre-fetched partitions based on the predicted query region. If the predicted query region is small, the system pre-fetches fine-grained partitions. If the predicted query region is large, the system pre-fetches coarse-grained partitions.

**4. System Architecture Additions:**

*   **Prediction Service:** A dedicated prediction service responsible for training and running the prediction model.
*   **Partition Prefetcher:** A component within the sensor-proximity resource responsible for prefetching partitions based on the prediction service’s output.
*   **Dynamic Granularity Manager:** A component responsible for dynamically adjusting the granularity of pre-fetched partitions.

**Pseudocode (Partition Prefetcher):**

```
function prefetchPartitions(currentEmbedding, currentTime):
  prediction = PredictionService.predictNextPartitions(currentEmbedding, currentTime)
  topPartitions = prediction.getTopNPartitions(N=3) // Get top 3 predicted partitions
  
  for partition in topPartitions:
    if partition not in cache:
      requestPartition(partition) // Initiate partition request
  
  return cache.find(currentEmbedding) // Attempt to find embedding in cache
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Temporal Embedding:** Vector of floats (e.g., 128 dimensions)
*   **Partition:** A collection of embedding vectors and associated metadata.
*   **Prediction:** A probability distribution over partitions.
*   **Cache:** A key-value store mapping partition IDs to partition data.
