## Adaptive Permutation Network for Sponge Functions

**Concept:** Implement a dynamically configurable permutation layer within the sponge function engine, leveraging a small neural network to tailor the permutation based on input message characteristics. This moves beyond fixed permutation functions to offer increased security and adaptability.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Permutation Network (PN):** A shallow, fully connected neural network (e.g., 2-3 layers, 64-128 neurons per layer). Input is a condensed representation of the current register state (e.g., a hash of the capacity section). Output is a set of weights controlling a parameterized permutation function.

2.  **Parameterized Permutation Function (PPF):** A function capable of varying its behavior based on the weights provided by the PN.  One possible implementation: A series of S-boxes arranged in a network. The weights from the PN control the selection of S-boxes (or a weighted combination of S-boxes) at each stage of the permutation.  Alternatively, weights can directly modify the lookup tables within the S-boxes.

3.  **Register Modification:** The register is divided into capacity and bitrate sections as described in the original patent. The PN analyzes the capacity section to determine the permutation weights. 

4.  **Control Signals:**
    *   `PN_Enable`: Enables/disables the Permutation Network. Useful for benchmarking or fallback to a fixed permutation.
    *   `Learning_Rate`: (Optional) Allows for online learning of the PN, potentially improving adaptability over time (see section 6).
    *   `Weight_Source`: Selects the source of permutation weights: PN output, fixed weights, or external source.

5.  **Integration with Existing Engine:** The PN and PPF replace the fixed permutation function in the existing sponge engine. The rest of the engine (message processor, iterative calculator, output adaptor) remain largely unchanged.

6.  **Optional Online Learning:**  Implement a feedback mechanism where the output of the sponge function is used to train the PN. This allows the PN to adapt to the specific characteristics of the input data over time.  Training could be performed using a simple gradient descent algorithm.  Careful consideration must be given to prevent adversarial attacks during the learning process.

**Pseudocode (Iterative Calculator):**

```
function processBlock(block, register):
  xorResult = XOR(block, register)
  modifiedXorResult = ReplaceCapacitySection(xorResult, register)

  // Get permutation weights from the PN
  permutationWeights = PermutationNetwork(register.capacity)

  // Apply parameterized permutation
  permutedResult = ParameterizedPermutationFunction(modifiedXorResult, permutationWeights)

  newRegister = permutedResult

  return newRegister
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The PN can be implemented as a small, dedicated neural network accelerator.
*   The PPF requires careful optimization to minimize latency and power consumption.
*   The weight storage for the PN and PPF should be optimized for fast access.
