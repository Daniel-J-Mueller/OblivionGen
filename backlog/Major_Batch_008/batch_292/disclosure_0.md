## Dynamic Endpoint Health Prediction & Proactive Load Shifting

**Concept:** Extend the load balancing system to *predict* endpoint failures before they occur, using machine learning, and proactively shift load *before* impact. This differs from standard failure detection which is reactive.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Collect metrics from endpoints beyond basic health checks. Include:
    *   CPU Utilization
    *   Memory Usage
    *   Disk I/O
    *   Network Latency (internal & external)
    *   Request Processing Time (per endpoint)
    *   Error Rates (HTTP status codes, application errors)
    *   Log Data (structured logs for anomaly detection)
*   **Collection Frequency:**  Adjustable, based on endpoint criticality and resource availability. Range: 1 second - 5 minutes.
*   **Data Storage:** Time-series database optimized for high write throughput and efficient querying (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus).
*   **Data Normalization:**  Standardize data formats and units across diverse endpoint types.

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Model Type:** Time-series forecasting models (e.g., LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks, Prophet).  Multiple models will be trained and evaluated continuously.
*   **Training Data:** Historical performance data from the Data Collection Module.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Extract relevant features from raw data (e.g., moving averages, standard deviations, rate of change).
*   **Model Evaluation:**  Use metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and F1-score to assess model accuracy.
*   **Continuous Training:**  Retrain models periodically (e.g., daily, weekly) with new data to adapt to changing endpoint behavior.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify anomalous data points that deviate significantly from the predicted values.

**3. Proactive Load Shifting Module:**

*   **Thresholds:** Define configurable thresholds for anomaly scores and predicted performance degradation.
*   **Load Shifting Strategy:**
    *   **Gradual Reduction:** Gradually decrease the load on potentially failing endpoints by diverting traffic to healthy ones.
    *   **Weighted Distribution:**  Dynamically adjust the weight assigned to each endpoint in the load balancing pool based on its predicted health and performance.
    *   **Preemptive Scaling:**  Trigger scaling events (e.g., launching new instances) to increase capacity *before* endpoints become overloaded.
*   **Traffic Diversion:**  Utilize existing load balancing mechanisms to redirect traffic based on the dynamic weighting.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor the impact of load shifting on overall system performance and adjust thresholds/strategies accordingly.
*   **Integration with Workflow Engine:** Leverage the existing workflow engine to automate the entire process.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Collect data from endpoints
  endpointData = collectEndpointData()

  // Predict performance for each endpoint
  predictedPerformance = predictPerformance(endpointData)

  // Identify potentially failing endpoints
  failingEndpoints = identifyFailingEndpoints(predictedPerformance)

  // Calculate load shift weights
  shiftWeights = calculateShiftWeights(failingEndpoints)

  // Update load balancer configuration
  updateLoadBalancer(shiftWeights)

  // Log and monitor system performance
  logPerformanceMetrics()

  // Wait for next iteration
  sleep(10 seconds)
}
```

**System Components:**

*   **Prediction Server:** Dedicated server(s) responsible for running the Predictive Modeling Engine.
*   **Data Ingestion Pipeline:**  System for efficiently ingesting and processing data from endpoints. (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
*   **Time-Series Database:**  Storage for historical performance data.
*   **Load Balancer Integration API:**  API for communicating with the existing load balancer to update configuration.
*   **Monitoring Dashboard:**  Web-based dashboard for visualizing system performance and identifying potential issues.
