## Dynamic Resource Prefetching based on Predicted Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the domain allocation monitoring to *proactively* prefetch embedded resources to domains predicted to be optimal for *future* requests, creating a tiered caching system. This aims to reduce latency by having resources already staged on predicted-optimal domains before the request even arrives.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Resource Prefetcher (PRP) – operates as a module integrated with existing domain allocation logic.
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time request data (URLs of embedded resources, user location, time of day).
    *   Historical domain allocation data (as currently monitored in the base patent).
    *   Content metadata (resource type, size, dependencies, content provider).
    *   Domain performance metrics (latency, bandwidth, cost – existing data).
*   **Prediction Engine:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained to predict optimal domain allocation for *future* requests based on input data. The model outputs a probability distribution over potential domain allocations.
*   **Prefetching Logic:**
    *   For each incoming request (or a statistically representative sample), the PRP uses the prediction engine to estimate the probability distribution of optimal domain allocations.
    *   The PRP identifies the top N most probable domain allocations (e.g., N=3).
    *   For each of these top N allocations, the PRP initiates prefetching of the embedded resources to the associated domains. Prefetching prioritizes resources with high predicted request frequency.
    *   Prefetching can be throttled based on available bandwidth, domain capacity, and resource priority.
*   **Caching Tier:**
    *   Prefetched resources are stored in a tiered caching system.
    *   Tier 1: In-memory cache on edge servers (lowest latency).
    *   Tier 2: SSD-based cache on edge servers (faster access than Tier 3).
    *   Tier 3: Standard disk-based cache.
*   **Request Handling:** When a request arrives:
    *   The system checks the caching tiers for the requested resources.
    *   If a resource is found in a cache associated with the currently determined optimal domain allocation, it is served immediately.
    *   If the resource is not cached or the optimal domain allocation has changed, the request is routed to the appropriate domain.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On incoming request:
request = get_incoming_request()
predicted_allocations = predict_domain_allocations(request.embedded_resources)

// Check cache for resources in predicted allocations
for allocation in predicted_allocations:
    for resource in allocation.embedded_resources:
        cached_resource = check_cache(resource, allocation.domain)
        if cached_resource:
            serve_resource(cached_resource)
            return // Resource served from cache

// If not found in cache, determine optimal allocation and fetch
optimal_allocation = determine_optimal_allocation(request.embedded_resources)
resource = fetch_resource(optimal_allocation)
serve_resource(resource)

// Background: Periodic prefetching based on predictions
function prefetch_resources():
    requests = sample_recent_requests()
    for request in requests:
        predicted_allocations = predict_domain_allocations(request.embedded_resources)
        for allocation in predicted_allocations:
            for resource in allocation.embedded_resources:
                if not is_resource_cached(resource, allocation.domain):
                    prefetch_resource(resource, allocation.domain)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved user experience.
*   Increased cache hit rate.
*   More efficient resource utilization.
*   Adaptive to changing network conditions and content popularity.
