## Secure Data ‘Sharding’ with Dynamic Key Orchestration

**Concept:** Expand the secure storage capabilities by implementing data sharding *within* the drive itself, coupled with a dynamic key management system that distributes encryption keys across multiple internal, isolated processing units.  This goes beyond simply encrypting with a single key; it actively breaks up the data and encrypts each piece with a different key.

**Specification:**

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Multi-Core Cryptographic Engine:** The storage device will incorporate a dedicated, multi-core processor optimized for cryptographic operations. Minimum 8 cores, configurable for parallel encryption/decryption.
*   **Secure Enclave Partitioning:** The processor will feature hardware-enforced secure enclave partitioning, creating isolated execution environments for each core. Each enclave handles a unique key and data shard.
*   **High-Speed Internal Bus:** A dedicated, high-bandwidth internal bus connecting the cores and storage media, minimizing latency for data transfer and cryptographic operations.
*   **Non-Volatile Random Number Generator (TRNG):** Hardware TRNG for generating high-quality random numbers for key generation and shard assignment.

**Software/Firmware Components:**

*   **Data Sharding Module:** Responsible for dividing incoming data into multiple shards. Shard size configurable based on data sensitivity and performance requirements.
*   **Key Generation & Distribution Service:** Generates unique encryption keys for each shard using the TRNG. Keys are *never* stored directly; instead, a key derivation function (KDF) is used with a master key and shard identifier.
*   **Shard Assignment Algorithm:** Maps each shard to a specific core/enclave based on a secure hashing algorithm that factors in data sensitivity, core load, and a pseudo-random salt.
*   **Dynamic Key Orchestration:** A runtime module that dynamically adjusts shard assignments and key rotation schedules based on resource availability, threat detection (if integrated with external security systems), and performance optimization.
*   **Metadata Management:** A secure metadata store (encrypted with a separate key derived from the master key) tracks shard locations, encryption keys (KDF parameters), and access control policies.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Write Operation:**
    *   Data arrives at the storage device.
    *   The Data Sharding Module divides the data into *N* shards.
    *   The Key Generation & Distribution Service generates a unique KDF parameter set for each shard.
    *   The Shard Assignment Algorithm determines the core/enclave for each shard.
    *   Each shard is encrypted by the assigned core/enclave using the corresponding KDF parameter set, derived from the master key and shard ID.
    *   Encrypted shards are written to the storage media.
    *   Metadata (shard location, KDF parameters) is securely stored.

2.  **Read Operation:**
    *   Read request arrives.
    *   Metadata is retrieved to identify shard locations and KDF parameters.
    *   Each core/enclave decrypts its assigned shard using the master key and shard ID.
    *   Decrypted shards are reassembled into the original data.
    *   Data is returned to the requesting application.

**Pseudocode (Shard Assignment):**

```
function assignShards(data, numShards, masterKey, salt):
  shards = splitData(data, numShards)
  shardAssignments = []
  for i = 0 to numShards - 1:
    shardID = i
    coreID = hash(shardID + salt + masterKey) mod numCores
    shardAssignments.append((shardID, coreID))
  return shardAssignments
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Master Key Protection:** The master key is the single point of failure. It must be securely stored and protected using hardware security features (e.g., a dedicated security chip).
*   **KDF Robustness:** The KDF must be strong and resistant to brute-force attacks.
*   **Side-Channel Attack Mitigation:** Hardware and software mitigations must be implemented to protect against side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks, power analysis).
*   **Enclave Isolation:** Strong enclave isolation must be enforced to prevent cross-shard contamination.
