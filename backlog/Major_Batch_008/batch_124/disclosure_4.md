## Adaptive Haptic Notification System for Disconnected Audio Devices

**Concept:** Extend the system to provide localized haptic feedback *on the primary device* to indicate not just disconnection, but *reason* for disconnection â€“ power loss, sleep mode, wireless interference. This goes beyond a simple 'disconnected' notification, offering diagnostic information through nuanced haptic patterns.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Engine Integration:** Primary device must contain a multi-axis haptic engine capable of producing complex vibrational patterns.
*   **Disconnection Reason Classification:** System must be able to classify disconnection reason. This involves:
    *   **Power State Monitoring:** Monitor power status of the secondary audio device (via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi reporting when possible).
    *   **Signal Strength Analysis:** Track signal strength history prior to disconnection. Sudden drops indicate interference. Gradual degradation suggests distance or obstruction.
    *   **Sleep Mode Detection:** Implement a "keep-alive" signal. Absence of this signal indicates sleep mode.
*   **Haptic Pattern Library:** Define a library of haptic patterns, each corresponding to a disconnection reason:
    *   **Power Loss:** Rapid, irregular vibration.
    *   **Sleep Mode:** Slow, rhythmic pulse.
    *   **Wireless Interference:** Erratic, stuttering vibration.
    *   **Out of Range:** Long, fading vibration.
    *   **Generic Disconnection:** Short, sharp pulse.
*   **Adaptive Intensity:** Intensity of the haptic feedback should adapt to ambient noise levels, preventing the notification from being missed or becoming obtrusive.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to customize haptic patterns, intensity, and duration.
*   **Integration with Voice Assistant:**  The system should be able to audibly announce the disconnection reason alongside the haptic feedback ("Audio device power lost.").

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION HandleDisconnection(device_id, disconnection_reason)
  // disconnection_reason: POWER_LOSS, SLEEP_MODE, INTERFERENCE, OUT_OF_RANGE, GENERIC
  
  // Determine haptic pattern based on disconnection reason
  IF disconnection_reason == POWER_LOSS THEN
    haptic_pattern = RAPID_IRREGULAR
  ELSE IF disconnection_reason == SLEEP_MODE THEN
    haptic_pattern = SLOW_RHYTHMIC
  ELSE IF disconnection_reason == INTERFERENCE THEN
    haptic_pattern = ERRATIC_STUTTERING
  ELSE IF disconnection_reason == OUT_OF_RANGE THEN
    haptic_pattern = LONG_FADING
  ELSE
    haptic_pattern = SHORT_SHARP
  END IF
  
  // Adjust intensity based on ambient noise (using microphone input)
  ambient_noise_level = GetAmbientNoiseLevel()
  intensity = CalculateIntensity(ambient_noise_level)

  // Activate haptic engine
  PlayHapticPattern(haptic_pattern, intensity)

  // Optionally announce disconnection reason via voice assistant
  IF user_prefers_voice_announcements THEN
    AnnounceDisconnectionReason(disconnection_reason)
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```
