## Dynamic Task Skill Mapping & Predictive Assignment

**Concept:** A system that dynamically maps task performer skills *beyond* stated preferences/subscriptions, using real-time performance data and predictive modeling to assign tasks *before* the performer explicitly expresses interest. This goes beyond filtering; it anticipates needs and proactively presents opportunities.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Real-time Performance Tracking:** Captures granular data on task completion: time spent, error rates, resource utilization, even keystroke dynamics or mouse movements (optional, for advanced analysis).
*   **Implicit Feedback Collection:** Monitors user interactions beyond task acceptance: time spent reviewing task details, help requests, rework submissions, etc. These form ‘soft signals’ of skill/interest.
*   **External Data Integration:** API connections to publicly available skill databases (e.g., LinkedIn, Stack Overflow) to augment performer profiles.
*   **Task Attribute Decomposition:** Tasks are broken down into micro-attributes (e.g., "image editing - color correction", "data entry - alphanumeric", "customer service - email response").

**2. Skill Modeling Engine:**

*   **Dynamic Skill Vectors:**  Each performer maintains a constantly updating ‘skill vector’ representing proficiency across all decomposed task attributes.  Initial values derived from stated subscriptions, then refined by performance data.
*   **Bayesian Inference:**  Uses Bayesian inference to update skill vectors based on observed performance.  Prior probabilities (from subscriptions) are combined with likelihood (performance data) to generate posterior probabilities.
*   **Skill Decay:**  Implements a ‘skill decay’ function to account for periods of inactivity in specific skill areas.  Skills unused for a defined period gradually decrease in proficiency.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies outlier performance patterns (e.g., unusually fast completion times, high error rates) suggesting potential skill misrepresentation or external assistance.

**3. Predictive Assignment Module:**

*   **Task Demand Forecasting:** Predicts future task demand based on historical trends and real-time events (e.g., seasonal spikes, breaking news).
*   **Matching Algorithm:**  Utilizes a multi-objective optimization algorithm (e.g., genetic algorithm) to match tasks to performers based on:
    *   Skill Vector Similarity:  Maximizing the cosine similarity between the task’s attribute vector and the performer’s skill vector.
    *   Availability: Considering performer workload, scheduled breaks, and time zone.
    *   Reward Optimization:  Adjusting task assignment to maximize overall platform reward distribution (preventing a small number of performers from monopolizing high-paying tasks).
*   **Pre-emptive Task Presentation:**  Presents potential tasks to performers *before* they actively search, based on the predictive matching algorithm.  Tasks are presented with a ‘confidence score’ indicating the likelihood of successful completion.
*   **Gamified Acceptance/Rejection:**  Incentivizes performers to accurately assess their skills by rewarding correct acceptance/rejection decisions.

**4.  API & Interface:**

*   **Real-time Data Streaming:** Enables real-time data streaming between the data acquisition module, skill modeling engine, and predictive assignment module.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Provides administrators with tools to monitor system performance, adjust algorithm parameters, and investigate anomalous behavior.
*   **Performer Interface:** Presents pre-emptive task recommendations with confidence scores, allows performers to adjust skill profiles, and provides feedback on task difficulty.



**Pseudocode (Predictive Assignment):**

```
function assign_task(task, performer_list):
  for performer in performer_list:
    skill_similarity = calculate_cosine_similarity(task.attributes, performer.skill_vector)
    availability_score = calculate_availability(performer)
    reward_score = calculate_reward_score(performer, task)

    total_score = skill_similarity * weight_skill + availability_score * weight_availability + reward_score * weight_reward

    performer.score = total_score
    performer.assigned_tasks.append(task)
  
  sort performers by score descending
  return top N performers
```
