**Adaptive Table Sharding Based on Predictive Workload Analysis**

**Concept:** Extend the idea of configurable capacity beyond simple throughput adjustments. Implement a system that *proactively* shards or merges time-series tables based on *predicted* workload, not just historical data or reactive triggers. This minimizes latency spikes and optimizes storage costs by dynamically aligning table structure with expected demand.

**Specifications:**

*   **Workload Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Time-series data ingestion rate, query patterns (frequency, scope, complexity), historical data, seasonal trends, external event feeds (e.g., marketing campaign schedule, known outages).
    *   Algorithm: A hybrid approach combining time-series forecasting (ARIMA, Prophet), machine learning classification (for identifying query types and their resource demands), and correlation analysis (linking external events to workload changes).
    *   Output: Predicted workload profile for each time-series table, including estimated ingestion rate, query load, and resource requirements (CPU, memory, storage). This prediction horizon should extend at least 24 hours, ideally 7 days.

*   **Dynamic Sharding/Merging Engine:**
    *   Input: Predicted workload profile, current table structure, pre-defined cost/performance thresholds (e.g., maximum acceptable latency, storage cost per GB).
    *   Logic: 
        1.  **Shard Creation:** If predicted ingestion rate or query load exceeds a threshold for a given table, the engine initiates a horizontal shard split. Shards should be created based on a time-based or hash-based partitioning scheme, adaptable based on query patterns.
        2.  **Shard Merging:** If predicted ingestion rate or query load falls below a threshold for a shard, the engine initiates a shard merge operation with an adjacent shard. This reduces storage overhead and simplifies query routing.
        3.  **Table Consolidation:** If the aggregate predicted load across multiple related tables is low, the engine considers merging them into a single table, potentially using a column-oriented storage format for optimized analytics.
        4.  **Pre-emptive Sharding:** Based on predicted workload spikes from known events (e.g., a product launch), the engine proactively shards tables *before* the spike occurs, ensuring capacity is available.

*   **Table Metadata Management:**
    *   Maintain a dynamic metadata store that tracks the current sharding state of each table, the predicted workload for each shard, and the cost/performance metrics.
    *   Use this metadata to route queries to the appropriate shards and to optimize query execution plans.

*   **Automated Rebalancing:**
    *   Implement an automated rebalancing mechanism that continuously monitors workload and adjusts sharding/merging operations as needed.
    *   The rebalancing process should be non-disruptive to ongoing queries.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Collect Metrics:  Ingestion rates, query load, resource usage
  metrics = collectMetrics()

  // 2. Predict Workload:  Use forecasting models
  predictedWorkload = predictWorkload(metrics)

  // 3. Evaluate Sharding State:
  for each table {
    if (predictedWorkload.ingestionRate > maxIngestionRate) {
      createShard(table)
    }
    if (predictedWorkload.ingestionRate < minIngestionRate && numShards > 1) {
      mergeShards(table)
    }
    if (predictedWorkload.queryLoad < minQueryLoad && relatedTablesExist()) {
      consolidateTables(table, relatedTables)
    }
  }

  // 4. Rebalance: Execute sharding/merging operations
  executeRebalancing()

  // 5. Sleep: Wait for next iteration
  sleep(60 seconds)
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond reactive capacity adjustments to *proactive* table sharding and merging based on *predicted* workload. It introduces a predictive component that anticipates demand and optimizes table structure accordingly, maximizing performance and minimizing costs. The system is also capable of automatically consolidating related tables, further reducing overhead and simplifying analytics. This moves beyond simple throughput constraints and into dynamic structure management.
