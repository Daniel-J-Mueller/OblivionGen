## Dynamic Content Layering via Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the automatic supplemental content presentation to include dynamically layered content *over* the primary content, coupled with haptic feedback indicating the presence and type of supplemental information. This goes beyond simply *switching* displays based on orientation, to actively augmenting the primary experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Device with orientation sensor (accelerometer, gyroscope).
    *   High-resolution display capable of layering translucent/semi-transparent content.
    *   Haptic engine capable of nuanced localized vibrations/texture changes.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Orientation Detection Module:* Continuously monitors device orientation.  Triggers supplemental content requests upon significant orientation change *and* subtle, user-defined gestures (e.g., a slight tilt while viewing).
    *   *Content Metadata Analyzer:*  Analyzes the primary content (video, image, text) to extract relevant metadata (characters, locations, objects, themes, keywords).
    *   *Supplemental Content Engine:* Based on metadata *and* user preferences (defined in a configuration UI), fetches/generates supplemental content.  Content types include:
        *   Character bios/info.
        *   Location details (maps, historical information).
        *   Object identification/descriptions.
        *   Related articles/links.
        *   Interactive elements (polls, quizzes).
    *   *Layering & Rendering Module:*  Dynamically renders supplemental content as translucent layers *over* the primary content.  Layers can be positioned based on object tracking (if video) or user interaction.  Adjusts transparency and size for optimal readability.
    *   *Haptic Feedback Module:*  Provides localized haptic feedback to indicate the *presence* and *type* of supplemental content.  Different vibration patterns/textures signify different categories (e.g., pulsing for character info, a 'sweep' for location details, a 'tap' for interactive elements).  Haptic intensity scales with the proximity of the supplemental content to the user's gaze/touch (if touchscreen).
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  User views primary content in a specific orientation.
    2.  Orientation Detection Module registers orientation and user gestures.
    3.  Content Metadata Analyzer extracts metadata.
    4.  Supplemental Content Engine fetches/generates relevant content.
    5.  Layering & Rendering Module overlays content, adjusting transparency and positioning.
    6.  Haptic Feedback Module provides localized feedback.
    7.  User can interact with layered content via touch/gesture.
    8.  System adapts layering and haptics based on user interaction and gaze tracking (if available).
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Module):**

```
function provideHapticFeedback(contentType, proximity) {
  if (contentType == "characterInfo") {
    pattern = pulsingVibration(intensity: proximity * 0.8)
  } else if (contentType == "locationDetails") {
    pattern = sweepVibration(intensity: proximity * 0.6, duration: 200ms)
  } else if (contentType == "interactiveElement") {
    pattern = tapVibration(intensity: proximity * 1.0)
  } else {
    pattern = null // No haptic feedback
  }

  if (pattern != null) {
    hapticEngine.play(pattern)
  }
}
```

**Expansion:** Link to external databases (Wikipedia, IMDb, etc.) for real-time supplemental information. Implement AI-powered content generation to create dynamic summaries or alternative perspectives.  Integrate with AR/VR headsets for immersive layered experiences.
