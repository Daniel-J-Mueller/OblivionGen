## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction for Personalized Wake Word Verification

**System Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones), dedicated edge processing unit (Neural Processing Unit/GPU), high-fidelity speaker, optional depth sensor (e.g., Time-of-Flight).
*   **Software:** Real-time audio processing pipeline, 3D acoustic scene reconstruction engine, machine learning framework (TensorFlow/PyTorch), personalized voice model database.

**Innovation Description:**

This system aims to move beyond directional audio analysis for wake word detection to *reconstruct* the acoustic environment in 3D space, building a dynamic model of the room and objects within it. This allows for far more nuanced verification of whether a wake word was genuinely spoken *by a user* versus generated by the device.

**Operational Details:**

1.  **Continuous Acoustic Scene Capture:** The microphone array continuously captures audio. The system uses beamforming and time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) techniques to build a 3D point cloud representing reflective surfaces (walls, furniture, etc.). The depth sensor enhances this reconstruction, providing ground truth for improved accuracy.
2.  **Sound Source Localization & Tracking:** When audio is detected, the system attempts to localize sound sources within the reconstructed 3D scene. This isn't just about direction; it's about *where* in the room the sound is originating.  Sound source tracking follows the source's movement over time.
3.  **Personalized Vocal Profile Integration:** Each user has a stored vocal profile containing acoustic characteristics (frequency range, timbre, speaking rate). When potential wake word audio is detected, the system attempts to match the source's vocal characteristics to a known user profile.
4.  **Contextual Verification Logic:**
    *   **Source Position Validation:** Is the sound source located near a typical user position (e.g., couch, desk)? Sounds originating from the speaker itself will obviously be positioned differently.
    *   **Reflection Analysis:** The reconstructed 3D scene allows the system to predict how sound *should* reflect off surfaces. Deviations from these predictions suggest artificial sound generation. A genuine voice will produce expected reflections.
    *   **Ambient Noise Correlation:** Does the detected voice integrate naturally with the existing ambient noise profile of the room? Artificial sounds may stand out.
    *   **Motion Tracking Consistency**: Is the source moving in a way that is consistent with a human being speaking? Static or unnatural movements suggest artificial generation.
5.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns and refines its acoustic scene model, user profiles, and verification logic based on user feedback and observed data.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function verify_wake_word(audio_data):
    scene = reconstruct_acoustic_scene(audio_data)
    source = localize_sound_source(audio_data, scene)
    user = match_user_profile(source.voice_characteristics)

    if user:
        if is_valid_user_position(source.position):
            if are_reflections_consistent(audio_data, scene):
                if is_ambient_noise_consistent(audio_data):
                    if is_motion_consistent(source):
                        return TRUE // Wake word verified
    return FALSE // Wake word rejected
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-User Support:** Adapt the system to identify and verify wake words from multiple users in the same room.
*   **Privacy Features:**  Allow users to control data collection and processing settings.
*   **Integration with Smart Home Ecosystem:**  Use the acoustic scene reconstruction data for other smart home applications (e.g., occupancy detection, gesture recognition).
