## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Core Concept:** Expand beamforming beyond simple direction-of-arrival to reconstruct a dynamic, 3D acoustic scene model. This allows for more sophisticated speech isolation, noise reduction, and even identification of non-speech audio events (e.g., object interactions, environmental sounds).

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Circular microphone array (minimum 32 microphones, evenly spaced). IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) integrated within the device to track head/device movement. Optional: Low-resolution wide-angle camera for visual context.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance DSP/GPU capable of real-time 3D audio processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Mapping Engine:** Processes microphone array data to create a volumetric acoustic map of the surrounding environment. This map represents sound pressure levels at discrete 3D points.  Utilizes ray tracing techniques to model sound propagation and reflections.
    *   **Source Localization & Tracking:** Identifies and tracks multiple audio sources within the acoustic map. Combines beamforming with machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to differentiate between speech and other sounds.  Tracks source movement over time.
    *   **Dynamic Noise Cancellation:** Uses the acoustic map to identify and suppress noise sources. Creates adaptive noise cancellation filters based on the location and characteristics of the noise. Filters adapt in real-time to changes in the acoustic environment.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering:**  Renders audio output with spatial cues (HRTF – Head-Related Transfer Function) to create a realistic 3D audio experience. Adjusts audio output based on the user's head position and orientation (tracked by the IMU).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Voxel Grid:**  3D grid representing the acoustic space. Each voxel stores sound pressure level, estimated source location probability, and noise characteristics.
    *   **Source Object:**  Represents an audio source. Stores position, velocity, estimated speech/noise ratio, and audio characteristics.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Acoustic Mapping Engine):**

```
// Initialize Voxel Grid (dimensions based on expected environment size)
voxelGrid = createVoxelGrid(width, height, depth)

// Receive Audio Data from Microphone Array
audioData = receiveAudioData()

// Perform Beamforming (multiple beams)
beamformedSignals = performBeamforming(audioData, beamAngles)

// For each beam:
for beam in beamAngles:
    // Calculate Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) for each microphone
    tdoa = calculateTDOA(beamformedSignals, microphonePositions)

    // Estimate source location based on TDOA
    sourceLocation = estimateSourceLocation(tdoa)

    // Update Voxel Grid – increase sound pressure level at voxels near sourceLocation
    updateVoxelGrid(voxelGrid, sourceLocation, beamEnergy)

// Apply smoothing filter to Voxel Grid (reduce noise)
smoothedVoxelGrid = applySmoothingFilter(voxelGrid)

// Output: Smoothed Voxel Grid – representing the reconstructed acoustic scene
return smoothedVoxelGrid
```

**Innovation Potential:**

*   **Enhanced Speech Recognition:** More accurate speech recognition in noisy environments.
*   **Advanced Voice Control:** Robust voice control systems that can handle complex acoustic scenes.
*   **Immersive Audio Experiences:** Realistic 3D audio rendering for gaming, virtual reality, and augmented reality.
*   **Environmental Awareness:**  The system can “see” the acoustic environment, potentially detecting objects or events based on sound reflections.
*   **Smart Home Applications:** Integration with smart home devices to enable more natural and intuitive interactions.
