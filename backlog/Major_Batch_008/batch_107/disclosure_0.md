## Dynamic Model Partitioning Based on Edge Device Capabilities & Network Conditions

**Specification:** A system enabling real-time adjustment of data model partitioning (secure/unsecure portions) between hub and edge devices, driven by observed edge device resource availability and network bandwidth.

**Core Concept:** The provided patent details a static division of a data processing model. This design expands on that by introducing a *dynamic* system where the model's partitioning isn’t fixed at deployment, but evolves based on runtime conditions.

**Components:**

1.  **Edge Device Capability Probes:**
    *   Each edge device continuously monitors its own resource usage (CPU, memory, power) and reports this data to the hub.
    *   Includes metrics for sensor data processing latency.
    *   Reports network connection quality (bandwidth, latency, packet loss).

2.  **Hub-Side Resource Manager:**
    *   Receives resource reports from all edge devices.
    *   Maintains a global model of edge device capabilities.
    *   Utilizes a reinforcement learning agent to optimize model partitioning. The reward function prioritizes minimizing overall latency and maximizing successful data processing.
    *   Implements a cost function considering the security implications of moving portions of the model to edge devices.  (e.g., moving a sensitive filtering layer to an edge device incurs a higher cost).

3.  **Model Partitioning Engine:**
    *   Based on the RL agent's recommendations, this engine dynamically adjusts the model partitioning.
    *   Supports granular partitioning – not just “secure” vs. “unsecure,” but levels of security and computational complexity.
    *   The engine re-packages and transmits updated model components (secure/unsecure) to edge devices via an over-the-air (OTA) update mechanism. This should support differential updates to minimize bandwidth usage.

4.  **Secure Model Component Handling:**
    *   All secure model components are encrypted using a key managed by the hub and the edge devices.
    *   Upon receiving a new secure component, the edge device verifies the authenticity and integrity of the component.
    *   Secure components are decrypted and executed within a trusted execution environment (TEE) like a TPM or secure enclave.

**Pseudocode (Hub-Side Resource Manager):**

```
// Variables
edge_device_capabilities = {} // Dictionary of edge device resource data
rl_agent = ReinforcementLearningAgent()
current_model_partitioning = initial_partitioning // Static initial configuration

// Main Loop
while (true):
  // 1. Receive Updates from Edge Devices
  for device_id in edge_devices:
    edge_device_capabilities[device_id] = receive_resource_report(device_id)

  // 2. RL Agent Recommendation
  recommended_partitioning = rl_agent.recommend_partitioning(edge_device_capabilities, current_model_partitioning)

  // 3. Cost/Benefit Analysis (Security implications)
  cost = calculate_security_cost(recommended_partitioning)
  benefit = calculate_performance_benefit(recommended_partitioning)

  // 4. Decision - Apply Recommendation or Maintain Current Partitioning
  if benefit > cost:
    current_model_partitioning = recommended_partitioning
    // Trigger OTA updates to edge devices with new model components
    trigger_ota_updates(current_model_partitioning)
  else:
    // Log the rejected recommendation for analysis
    log_rejected_recommendation(recommended_partitioning)

  // Wait for next update cycle
  sleep(update_interval)
```

**Innovations:**

*   **Adaptive Security:** The system can dynamically adjust the level of security based on edge device capabilities and network conditions.  A device with limited resources might offload less critical, unsecure portions to reduce load, while a more powerful device might handle a greater share of the secure model.
*   **Proactive Optimization:** The reinforcement learning agent allows the system to learn and proactively optimize model partitioning over time, adapting to changing conditions and maximizing performance.
*   **Granular Partitioning:** Enables more fine-grained control over model partitioning than a simple "secure" vs. "unsecure" division, allowing for nuanced optimization based on specific model layers and their resource requirements.
*   **Scalability:** The distributed nature of the system allows it to scale to large deployments with many edge devices.
