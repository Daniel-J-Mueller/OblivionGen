## Dynamic MAC Address Pools & Network Segmentation via Local Policy

**Concept:** Extend the existing local-premise access virtual network interface concept with dynamically allocated MAC address pools *per-VLAN* at the extension server, coupled with localized network policy enforcement. This allows for granular network segmentation *without* requiring complex centralized orchestration or traditional routing/firewall infrastructure within the provider’s network.

**Specification:**

**1. Dynamic MAC Pool Manager (DMPM):**

*   **Function:** Resides within the networking manager at the extension server. Manages MAC address pools for each VLAN configured on the physical network interface of the extension server.
*   **Configuration:** Administered via a programmatic interface (API). Allows definition of VLAN IDs and associated MAC address ranges (e.g., VLAN 10: 00:1A:2B:3C:40 – 00:1A:2B:3C:4F).  Pools can be sized based on anticipated density.
*   **Allocation:** When a compute instance requests a local-premise access virtual network interface, the DMPM allocates a MAC address from the corresponding VLAN's pool.  Allocation is tracked (MAC address, VLAN ID, compute instance ID).
*   **Reclamation:** Upon compute instance termination, the allocated MAC address is returned to the pool for reuse.

**2. Localized Network Policy Engine (LNPE):**

*   **Function:** Implemented within the networking manager. Enables definition and enforcement of basic network policies *specific to each VLAN*.
*   **Policy Definition:**  Administered via API.  Policies are defined as rules based on:
    *   Source MAC address.
    *   Destination MAC address.
    *   VLAN ID.
    *   Action: Allow, Deny, Drop.
*   **Enforcement:** The LNPE intercepts all data link layer frames entering or leaving the extension server. Based on the configured policies and the frame's MAC addresses/VLAN ID, it either forwards the frame, denies it, or drops it.

**3. API Extensions:**

*   **`create_vlan(vlan_id, mac_range_start, mac_range_end)`:** Creates a new VLAN and its associated MAC address pool.
*   **`allocate_mac(vlan_id, compute_instance_id)`:** Allocates a MAC address from the specified VLAN's pool for a compute instance. Returns the allocated MAC address.
*   **`release_mac(mac_address)`:** Releases a previously allocated MAC address back to its pool.
*   **`add_policy(vlan_id, source_mac, destination_mac, action)`:** Adds a network policy to a specified VLAN.
*   **`remove_policy(vlan_id, source_mac, destination_mac)`:** Removes a network policy.
*   **`get_policies(vlan_id)`:** Retrieves all policies configured for a VLAN.

**Pseudocode (Policy Enforcement):**

```
function process_frame(frame):
  vlan_id = extract_vlan_id(frame)
  destination_mac = extract_destination_mac(frame)
  source_mac = extract_source_mac(frame)

  policies = get_policies(vlan_id)

  for policy in policies:
    if policy.source_mac == "*" or policy.source_mac == source_mac:
      if policy.destination_mac == "*" or policy.destination_mac == destination_mac:
        if policy.action == "Allow":
          forward_frame(frame)
          return
        elif policy.action == "Deny" or policy.action == "Drop":
          drop_frame(frame)
          return

  # If no matching policy, allow by default
  forward_frame(frame)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Security:** Granular network segmentation at the edge.
*   **Simplified Network Management:**  Localized policy enforcement reduces reliance on complex centralized infrastructure.
*   **Scalability:** Enables rapid deployment of new VLANs and network segments.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Eliminates the need for dedicated routing/firewall devices at the edge.
*   **IoT/Industrial Automation Support:**  Facilitates secure connectivity for IoT and industrial devices.
