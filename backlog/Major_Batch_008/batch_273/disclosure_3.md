## Dynamic Code Style Mutation for Robustness Testing

**Concept:** Leverage the core principles of the patent – identifying and enforcing coding rules – to *intentionally* introduce controlled stylistic mutations into source code. This isn’t about *finding* violations; it's about *creating* them, and then observing how the build/test pipeline reacts. The goal is to proactively uncover fragility in tooling, build processes, and even the code itself related to stylistic variations.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** `code_mutator`
*   **Input:** Source code file (string)
*   **Configuration:**  A mutation profile (JSON or YAML) defining:
    *   Mutation types: (e.g., “indentation_style”, “brace_placement”, “variable_casing”, “comment_format”, “line_length”)
    *   Mutation probability:  A percentage chance for each mutation type to be applied to a code block.
    *   Mutation severity: A scoring system to measure the degree of stylistic change (low, medium, high)
*   **Output:** Mutated source code file (string)
*   **Core Function:** `mutate_code(source_code, mutation_profile)`

**Pseudocode:**

```
function mutate_code(source_code, mutation_profile):
  tokens = tokenize(source_code) // Basic lexical analysis
  mutated_tokens = []

  for token in tokens:
    if should_mutate(token, mutation_profile):
      mutated_token = apply_mutation(token, mutation_profile)
      mutated_tokens.append(mutated_token)
    else:
      mutated_tokens.append(token)

  mutated_code = reassemble(mutated_tokens) // Convert tokens back to code
  return mutated_code

function should_mutate(token, mutation_profile):
  mutation_type = select_mutation_type(mutation_profile)
  mutation_probability = mutation_profile[mutation_type]['probability']
  if random() < mutation_probability:
    return True
  else:
    return False

function apply_mutation(token, mutation_profile):
  mutation_type = mutation_profile[token]['type']
  // Apply specific mutation based on type (e.g., change indentation, add/remove spaces, change casing)
  // Example:  If mutation_type == "indentation_style":
  //   indentation = select_indentation_style()  // e.g., tabs or spaces
  //   mutated_token = apply_indentation(token, indentation)
  return mutated_token
```

**System Integration:**

1.  **Pre-Commit Hook:**  Integrate `code_mutator` into a pre-commit hook.  Each commit triggers mutation of staged files, followed by a build/test run. Failures indicate stylistic fragility.
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Add a dedicated mutation testing stage to the CI/CD pipeline. Generate multiple mutated versions of critical files. Run the full test suite against each version.
3.  **Feedback Loop:** Collect data from build/test failures.  Identify common stylistic weaknesses.  Refine mutation profiles to target these weaknesses.

**Novelty:** This isn’t about *enforcing* style. It's about *testing* resilience *to* style. Most style guides and linters are static. This introduces *dynamic* stylistic stress, uncovering subtle bugs or build process issues that static analysis would miss. Think of it as fuzzing, but for code style.
