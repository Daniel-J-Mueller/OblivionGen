**Modular Acoustic Environment – "Chameleon"**

**Concept:** A voice-activated device incorporating dynamically adjustable acoustic panels within its housing, allowing for customized sound projection and noise cancellation. Building on the sealed chamber concept from the patent, this expands the function beyond simple speaker enclosure to an active acoustic control system.

**Specs:**

*   **Housing:** Spherical or ovoid, constructed from a resonant polymer composite (e.g., modified polycarbonate). Internal cavity divided into sections by actively controlled membranes.
*   **Acoustic Panels:** Multiple (8-16) triangular or quadrilateral panels mounted internally, forming a flexible, multi-faceted surface. Panels constructed from a layered material: outer layer – sound-reflective material, inner layer – vibration dampener, core – piezoelectric actuators.
*   **Actuation System:** Each panel independently controlled by a dedicated piezoelectric actuator, driven by a digital signal processor (DSP). DSP algorithms control the panel position/vibration to shape the sound field and cancel noise.
*   **Microphone Array:** High-density microphone array integrated into the upper portion of the housing. Used for ambient noise analysis, voice localization, and feedback for acoustic shaping. At least 12 microphones, arranged in a geodesic pattern.
*   **Speaker Configuration:** Three speakers:
    *   Subwoofer – positioned centrally, directs low frequencies.
    *   Mid-range – two opposing drivers, directed laterally.
    *   Tweeter – array of micro-drivers angled to create a hemispherical soundstage.
*   **DSP Software:** Core functionality:
    *   *Voice Isolation:* Filters ambient noise and focuses on voice commands.
    *   *Directional Audio:* Projects sound towards a specific location in the room, creating a "personal sound zone."
    *   *Acoustic Shaping:* Adjusts panel positions to optimize sound clarity and reduce reflections.
    *   *Noise Cancellation:* Generates inverse sound waves to cancel out external noise.
    *   *Adaptive Acoustics:* Analyzes room acoustics and adjusts panel configurations automatically.
*   **Power:** Wireless charging. Internal rechargeable battery.
*   **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3, Zigbee.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // 1. Microphone Input
    audio_data = read_microphone_array();

    // 2. Voice Command Detection
    if (detect_wake_word(audio_data)) {
        command = process_voice_command(audio_data);
    }

    // 3. Environmental Analysis (constant)
    room_geometry = analyze_room_acoustics(); // uses microphone array to map reflections
    noise_profile = analyze_ambient_noise();

    // 4. Acoustic Panel Control
    adjust_acoustic_panels(room_geometry, noise_profile, command);

    // 5. Audio Output
    if (command == "play music") {
        play_music(audio_data);
        optimize_audio_projection(audio_data);
    }
}

// Function: adjust_acoustic_panels()
function adjust_acoustic_panels(room_geometry, noise_profile, command) {
    for each panel in acoustic_panels {
        // Calculate optimal panel angle based on:
        // - Room geometry (reflection points)
        // - Noise profile (cancel out specific frequencies)
        // - Command (e.g., focus sound towards user)
        panel_angle = calculate_panel_angle(room_geometry, noise_profile, command, panel);

        // Activate piezoelectric actuators to adjust panel angle
        adjust_panel_angle(panel, panel_angle);
    }
}
```
