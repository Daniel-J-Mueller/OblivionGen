## Adaptive Snapshotting with Predictive Deletion

**Concept:** Extend snapshotting beyond simple deletion markers by *predicting* likely deletions based on file access patterns and user behavior. This allows for proactively reducing snapshot size *before* a formal deletion request, optimizing storage and snapshot creation speed.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection Module:**

*   **Input:** File system access logs (read, write, delete, rename), user activity monitoring (application usage, time of day), and file metadata (creation date, last modified date, file type).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Analyze access patterns to identify files rarely accessed or exhibiting decreasing access frequency.
    *   Employ a time-series decay function (e.g., exponential decay) to assign a "deletion probability" to each file.  Files untouched for long periods receive higher probabilities. User behaviour heavily influences the decay factor.
    *   Correlate file types with deletion likelihood. Temporary files or logs should naturally have higher probabilities.
    *   Track user-initiated deletions to calibrate the prediction model.
*   **Output:**  A continuously updated “deletion probability map” assigned to each file or block within the file system.

**2. Predictive Snapshotting Engine:**

*   **Input:** Deletion probability map, snapshot request.
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Tiered Data Inclusion:** Divide data into tiers based on deletion probability.
        *   **Tier 0 (Critical):**  Deletion probability < 5%.  Fully included in snapshot.
        *   **Tier 1 (Probable):** 5% <= Deletion probability < 20%. Included in snapshot, but compressed more aggressively.
        *   **Tier 2 (Likely):** 20% <= Deletion probability < 50%.  Included in snapshot as metadata only (file name, size, timestamps) - data excluded.
        *   **Tier 3 (Highly Likely):** Deletion probability >= 50%.  Excluded from snapshot entirely.  Only a deletion flag is recorded.
    *   **Dynamic Tier Adjustment:**  Adjust tier thresholds based on system load, storage capacity, and historical deletion patterns.
    *   **Background Data Purging:**  Proactively purge Tier 3 data from snapshots *before* a full snapshot is triggered, leveraging the deletion probability map.
*   **Output:** A reduced-size snapshot containing only relevant data, optimized for storage efficiency and speed.

**3.  Metadata Management:**

*   Maintain a separate metadata index tracking the mapping between files/blocks and their corresponding snapshot tiers.  This allows for efficient reconstruction of files from snapshots, even if they were excluded from the main data copy.
*   Version control of the deletion probability map to enable recovery from inaccurate predictions.

**4. API & System Integration:**

*   Expose an API allowing applications to influence deletion probabilities (e.g., mark temporary files for automatic exclusion).
*   Integrate with existing block device drivers and file systems to seamlessly capture access logs and trigger predictive snapshotting.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function create_predictive_snapshot():
  deletion_map = get_deletion_probability_map()
  snapshot = new Snapshot()

  for each file in file_system:
    probability = deletion_map[file]

    if probability < 0.05:
      snapshot.add_file(file, compression_level = "low")
    elif probability < 0.20:
      snapshot.add_file(file, compression_level = "high")
    elif probability < 0.50:
      snapshot.add_file(file, data = "metadata_only")
    else:
      snapshot.mark_deleted(file)

  return snapshot
```

**Novelty:** This isn’t simply about marking deleted data; it's about *proactively* reducing snapshot size based on predicted deletions *before* the deletion occurs. This introduces a level of intelligent data management, optimizing storage and improving snapshot performance. The tiered inclusion based on a continuously updated probability map distinguishes it from existing techniques.
