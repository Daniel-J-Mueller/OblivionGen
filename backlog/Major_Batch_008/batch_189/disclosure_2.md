## Virtual Network Forensics & Anomaly Detection with Predictive Flow Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend network traffic data collection to not only *observe* flows but *predict* potential future flows based on learned behavioral patterns within virtual networks. This allows for proactive anomaly detection and preemptive security measures.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Enhanced Flow Records:** Augment existing network flow records with:
    *   **Virtual Network Context:** Explicit identification of the virtual network (VLAN, VXLAN, etc.) the flow originates from.
    *   **Application Layer Metadata:** Where possible, extract application-layer data (HTTP headers, DNS queries, etc.) without full packet capture. This requires lightweight deep packet inspection or integration with application-aware network services.
    *   **VM State Information:** Include the current resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O) of both the source and destination VMs.
    *   **Temporal Features:**  Capture time-based patterns, such as time of day, day of week, and seasonality.
*   **Behavioral Profiling:**  Establish baseline behavioral profiles for each VM and virtual network. This profile would include:
    *   Typical communication patterns (destination IPs, ports, protocols).
    *   Normal bandwidth usage.
    *   Expected resource utilization.
    *   Common application usage.

**2. Predictive Flow Modeling:**

*   **Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Architecture:** Implement a time-series prediction model using an RNN (specifically, LSTM or GRU). The RNN will be trained on historical network flow data and VM state information.
*   **Input Features:** The RNN will receive a sequence of historical network flow features and VM state data as input.
*   **Output Prediction:** The RNN will predict the probability distribution of potential future network flows. This includes:
    *   Likely destination IPs and ports.
    *   Expected bandwidth usage.
    *   Potential application usage.
*   **Dynamic Thresholding:** Establish adaptive thresholds for anomaly detection based on the predicted probability distributions.

**3. Anomaly Detection & Mitigation:**

*   **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor network flows and VM state.
*   **Deviation Analysis:** Compare observed flows to predicted flows. Calculate a deviation score based on the difference between the observed and predicted distributions.
*   **Anomaly Classification:**  Classify anomalies based on the deviation score and the characteristics of the observed flow. Potential anomaly types:
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Unusual destination IP or port, high bandwidth usage.
    *   **Malware Infection:** Communication with known malicious IPs, unusual application usage.
    *   **Denial of Service Attack:** High volume of traffic from a single source.
*   **Automated Mitigation:**  Trigger automated mitigation actions based on the anomaly type. This could include:
    *   **Traffic Shaping:** Limit bandwidth usage for the anomalous flow.
    *   **Firewall Rule Update:** Block communication with the malicious IP.
    *   **VM Isolation:** Isolate the infected VM to prevent further damage.

**4. Implementation Details:**

*   **Agent-Based Collection:** Deploy a lightweight agent within each hypervisor to collect network flow data and VM state information.
*   **Centralized Analysis:** Send collected data to a centralized analysis server for prediction and anomaly detection.
*   **API Integration:** Provide an API for integration with existing security information and event management (SIEM) systems and orchestration platforms.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle large-scale virtualized environments with thousands of VMs.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Agent running on each hypervisor
loop:
    flow_data = collect_network_flow_data()
    vm_state = collect_vm_state_data()
    send_data_to_central_server(flow_data, vm_state)

// Central Server
loop:
    received_data = receive_data_from_agent()
    predicted_flow = predict_next_flow(received_data)
    anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(received_data, predicted_flow)
    if anomaly_score > threshold:
        anomaly_type = classify_anomaly(received_data)
        trigger_mitigation_action(anomaly_type)
```
