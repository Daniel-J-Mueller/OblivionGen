## Temporal Graph Embedding Visualization & Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the immutable revision graph data store to facilitate real-time, interactive visualization of graph evolution over time. Instead of just presenting differences between materializations, allow users to *scrub* through the graph’s history, seeing changes animate and interactively explore the impact of each edit revision. This goes beyond static diffs to create a dynamic “time machine” for graph data.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure Extension:** Each immutable edit revision must store not only the field/value change but also a timestamp and a spatial bounding box representing the visual extent of the impacted nodes/edges. This spatial data will enable efficient rendering and culling.
*   **Temporal Index:** Implement a spatial-temporal index (e.g., a quadtree/octree extended with time slices) to quickly retrieve all edit revisions within a specified time range and viewport.
*   **Rendering Engine:** A rendering engine capable of animating graph changes.  Nodes and edges should smoothly transition between states based on the active time slice.  Consider a physics-based simulation for more natural transitions (e.g., nodes “sliding” to new positions, edges morphing).
*   **Time Scrub Interface:** A UI element allowing users to scrub through time.  This could be a timeline with markers representing significant edit revisions or a simple slider.
*   **Interactive Exploration:**  Users should be able to:
    *   **Highlight Edit Revisions:** Select an edit revision to highlight the impacted nodes/edges.
    *   **“Step” Through Time:** Move forward or backward one edit revision at a time.
    *   **Zoom and Pan:** Navigate the graph freely.
    *   **Filter by User/Source:**  See changes made by a specific user or source system.
    *   **Node/Edge Detail:**  Inspect the properties of individual nodes/edges at any point in time.
*   **Revision Blending:**  Introduce a “blend” parameter allowing users to visualize a partial state between two revisions.  This could be useful for debugging or understanding gradual changes.

**Pseudocode (Core Rendering Loop):**

```
function renderGraph(currentTime) {
  // 1. Retrieve relevant edit revisions for the current time
  relevantRevisions = spatialTemporalIndex.query(currentTime, viewport)

  // 2. Reset graph to initial state (based on the earliest revision)
  graph.resetToInitialState()

  // 3. Apply revisions in chronological order
  for (revision in relevantRevisions) {
    graph.applyRevision(revision)
  }

  // 4. Render the graph
  renderer.render(graph)
}

function applyRevision(revision) {
  // Update node/edge properties based on revision.field and revision.value
  // Handle node/edge creation/deletion
  // Update spatial bounding boxes
}

//Main Loop
while(running){
  currentTime = timeScrubInterface.getCurrentTime()
  renderGraph(currentTime)
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Predictive Modeling:**  Use machine learning to predict future graph states based on historical data.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual patterns of change that may indicate errors or security breaches.
*   **Collaboration:**  Allow multiple users to interact with the graph simultaneously.
*   **Version Control Integration:** Integrate with existing version control systems (e.g., Git) to provide a more comprehensive audit trail.
