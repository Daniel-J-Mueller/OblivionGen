## Dynamic Acoustic Feature Weighting Based on Prosodic Context

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:** Expand dynamic weight application beyond language model transitions to *acoustic features* used in speech recognition. The patent focuses on weighting language model paths; this extends that to weighting the contribution of different acoustic features during feature extraction.

**II. Functional Components:**

*   **Prosodic Analyzer:** Analyzes incoming audio for prosodic features (pitch, intensity, duration, speech rate, voice quality). Outputs a prosodic vector representing the current prosodic context.
*   **Feature Weight Map:** A lookup table (or learned model) associating specific prosodic contexts with weights for different acoustic features.  Features include, but aren't limited to: Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Perceptual Linear Prediction (PLP) coefficients, Formant frequencies, and Spectral Tilt.
*   **Feature Extractor with Dynamic Weighting:** A modified feature extraction module that applies the weights from the Feature Weight Map to the calculated acoustic features.  For example, if the prosodic context indicates ‘emphasis’ (high intensity, slow rate), the weights might increase the contribution of higher-frequency MFCC coefficients which are more sensitive to spectral changes indicative of emphasis.
*   **Recognition Engine:** Standard speech recognition engine (e.g., Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Deep Neural Network (DNN)) that processes the dynamically weighted acoustic features.
*   **Context Database:** Stores prosodic contexts and associated weights (initially populated with pre-defined rules and refined via machine learning).

**III. Implementation Details:**

1.  **Prosodic Feature Extraction:** Implement a robust prosodic feature extractor capable of accurately identifying prosodic contours in real-time.
2.  **Weight Map Construction:**
    *   **Initial Rules:** Define initial weights based on linguistic principles and acoustic research. For example:
        *   High pitch/intensity: Increase weight on high-frequency features.
        *   Slow rate/long pauses: Increase weight on formants to capture vowel articulation.
        *   Creaky voice: Increase weight on spectral tilt and low-frequency features.
    *   **Machine Learning:** Employ a supervised learning algorithm (e.g., Regression, Neural Network) to learn optimal weights from a large corpus of labeled speech data. The labels would indicate the prosodic context and the optimal feature weights for accurate recognition.
3.  **Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function calculate_weighted_features(audio_data, prosodic_vector, feature_weight_map):
  // Extract baseline acoustic features (MFCCs, PLP, Formants, etc.)
  baseline_features = extract_features(audio_data)

  // Lookup weights from the feature_weight_map based on the prosodic_vector
  weights = feature_weight_map.lookup(prosodic_vector)

  // Apply weights to the baseline features
  weighted_features = []
  for i in range(length(baseline_features)):
    weighted_features.append(baseline_features[i] * weights[i])

  return weighted_features
```

4.  **Integration with Recognition Engine:** Modify the input pipeline of the existing speech recognition engine to use the dynamically weighted features.

**IV. Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Improved Recognition in Noisy Environments:** Adapt weights to emphasize features less affected by noise.
*   **Accent/Dialect Adaptation:** Adjust weights to better capture the acoustic characteristics of different accents.
*   **Speaker Verification:** Fine-tune weights to highlight speaker-specific features.
*   **Emotion Recognition:**  Use prosodic context to enhance emotion detection.
