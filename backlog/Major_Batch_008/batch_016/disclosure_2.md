## Dynamic Spectral Tuning Bracket

**Concept:** A solar mounting bracket incorporating microfluidic channels and tunable photonic crystal films to dynamically adjust the wavelengths of light absorbed by the solar panel, maximizing energy capture based on ambient conditions and time of day.

**Specs:**

*   **Bracket Material:** Lightweight aluminum alloy (6061-T6) with embedded microfluidic channels.
*   **Photonic Crystal Film:** Thin-film interference coating deposited on the bracket's surface, directly facing the solar panel. Material: Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) nanorods.  Array pitch: 500nm - 700nm.
*   **Microfluidic Channels:** Network of etched channels (width: 200um, depth: 50um) within the bracket, running adjacent to the photonic crystal film. Fluid: DI water with dissolved electrolytes (KCl concentration: 0.1M).
*   **Actuation:** Miniaturized piezoelectric pumps integrated into the bracket base. Pumps control fluid flow through microfluidic channels.  Flow rate: Adjustable from 0 to 1ml/min per channel.
*   **Sensing:** Embedded pyranometer and spectral sensor (range: 300nm-1100nm) providing real-time ambient light data.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller (ESP32) processing sensor data and controlling piezoelectric pumps. Algorithm dynamically adjusts fluid flow based on:
    1.  Peak solar irradiance.
    2.  Spectral distribution of ambient light.
    3.  Target wavelength range for optimal solar panel efficiency (configurable).
*   **Power Source:** Integrated miniature rechargeable battery (LiPo) powered by a small fraction of the solar panel's output.
*   **Bracket Geometry:** Modular design allowing for various panel sizes and orientations.  Adjustable tilt angle (0-45 degrees).
*   **Surface Treatment:** Hydrophobic coating on bracket surfaces to prevent water condensation.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
LOOP:
  READ pyranometer_value
  READ spectral_data

  IF pyranometer_value > threshold:  // e.g., 500 W/m^2
    // Analyze spectral_data for peak wavelengths
    peak_wavelength = find_peak_wavelength(spectral_data)

    // Calculate target fluid flow rate
    target_flow_rate = calculate_flow_rate(peak_wavelength, target_wavelength_range)

    // Set piezoelectric pump flow rates
    set_pump_flow_rate(target_flow_rate)
  ELSE:
    // No significant sunlight, maintain minimum flow
    set_pump_flow_rate(minimum_flow_rate)

  DELAY (1 second)
ENDLOOP
```

**Function Details:**

*   `find_peak_wavelength(spectral_data)`:  Algorithm identifying the dominant wavelength in the spectral data. May use FFT or other spectral analysis techniques.
*   `calculate_flow_rate(peak_wavelength, target_wavelength_range)`:  Algorithm calculating the optimal fluid flow rate to shift the photonic crystal's resonant wavelength towards the target range. Relies on a pre-calibrated relationship between flow rate and wavelength shift.
*   `set_pump_flow_rate(flow_rate)`:  Sends a signal to the piezoelectric pumps to adjust their flow rate.  Includes error correction and feedback mechanisms.
