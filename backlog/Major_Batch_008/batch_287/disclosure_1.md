## Adaptive Sensor Masking with Dynamic Polarization

**Concept:** Augment the existing contamination detection system with a dynamically adjustable polarization filter 'mask' placed *in front* of the sensor cover. This mask would selectively block or transmit polarized light, allowing for enhanced differentiation between genuine environmental features and contaminant 'signatures' â€“ especially those with different reflective properties.

**Specs:**

*   **Polarization Mask Material:** Electrochromic or Micro-Electromechanical System (MEMS)-based polarization filter array.  Each 'pixel' within the array can independently adjust its polarization angle and transmission level.
*   **Illumination Source Augmentation:** Add a secondary, low-power, polarized light source (e.g., a ring of LEDs) positioned *coaxially* with the primary light source described in the patent. The secondary source's polarization axis will be adjustable.
*   **Control Module Integration:** The existing management module will be expanded to include:
    *   Polarization Mask Control Unit: Controls the individual polarization angles and transmission levels of the mask pixels.
    *   Polarized Illumination Control Unit:  Controls the activation/deactivation and polarization angle of the secondary polarized light source.
    *   Image Analysis Subroutine: A new image analysis routine that evaluates image data from both the primary and polarized light sources. This routine will identify contaminant 'hotspots' based on polarized light reflection differentials.
*   **Operational Modes:**
    *   **Passive Mode:** The secondary polarized light source is off. The system analyzes ambient light through the adjustable polarization mask.
    *   **Active Mode:** The secondary polarized light source is on. The system analyzes the combined light from both sources, through the adjustable polarization mask.
*   **Calibration Procedure:** During manufacturing and/or initial system setup, a calibration procedure will map the polarization response of common contaminants (dust, water droplets, oil, bird droppings, insects) within the operating environment.  This data will be used to optimize the polarization mask control parameters.
*   **Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
CalibratePolarizationResponse(CommonContaminants)

//Main Loop
while(VehicleOperating){
  if(ContaminationDetectionEnabled){
    TurnOnPrimaryLightSource()
    // Check ambient light level - dynamically adjust secondary light source
    if (AmbientLightBelowThreshold()) {
        TurnOnSecondaryLightSource()
    } else {
        TurnOffSecondaryLightSource()
    }

    CaptureImage(PrimaryLightSourceOn, SecondaryLightSourceOn)
    CaptureImage(PrimaryLightSourceOff, SecondaryLightSourceOff) //baseline capture

    //Optimize Mask Settings - based on historical performance, environment and system 'learning'
    SetMaskSettings(Optimize(HistoricalData, EnvironmentalData, LearningData))

    ApplyMask(Image, MaskSettings)
    AnalyzeImage(Image)

    If(ContaminationDetected()){
        TriggerCorrectiveAction()
    }
  }
}
```

**Rationale:** This adaptation moves beyond simple light/dark differential to leverage the *physical properties* of contaminants, providing a more robust and accurate detection method. By actively controlling the polarization of the illumination and the filtering of the sensor, the system can highlight even subtle contamination that might be missed by conventional methods.  The 'learning' component within the algorithm will allow the system to adapt to different environmental conditions and types of contamination, improving its overall performance.
