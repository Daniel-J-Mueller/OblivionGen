## Predictive Allocation based on Geo-Temporal Demand & Supplier Risk

**Concept:** Expand the supply risk detection beyond simple shortage probability to *proactive allocation* of inventory across multiple fulfillment centers *before* a shortage occurs, optimizing for both predicted demand *and* supplier risk scores. This isn't just about *reacting* to potential disruptions, but *preemptively* shifting stock to minimize impact.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Historical Sales Data (SKU, location, time) – granular to the hour if possible.
    *   Supplier Risk Scores (from the existing patent’s model) – updated in real-time.
    *   Geographic Demand Forecasts – incorporating seasonality, local events, weather patterns, and promotional activity.
    *   Transportation Costs & Lead Times – between supplier, fulfillment centers, and key customer locations.
    *   Fulfillment Center Capacity & Current Inventory Levels.
    *   Real-time data feeds for weather events and geopolitical instability.
*   **Core Algorithm:** A multi-objective optimization algorithm (e.g., Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing) that minimizes a weighted sum of:
    *   Total Transportation Costs.
    *   Expected Stockout Costs (based on demand forecasts & shortage probabilities).
    *   Risk Exposure (weighted by supplier risk score; higher risk = higher weight).
*   **Allocation Logic:**
    1.  **Demand Segmentation:** Divide demand into geographically-defined segments.
    2.  **Risk-Adjusted Demand:** Multiply the predicted demand within each segment by (1 - Supplier Risk Score). This effectively reduces the expected demand from high-risk suppliers.
    3.  **Optimal Allocation Calculation:** The optimization algorithm determines the optimal quantity of each SKU to allocate to each fulfillment center, balancing transportation costs, risk, and predicted demand.
    4.  **Dynamic Re-Allocation:** The algorithm runs continuously (e.g., hourly) to adjust allocations based on updated demand forecasts, supplier risk scores, and inventory levels.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: Historical Sales Data, Supplier Risk Scores, Demand Forecasts, Transportation Costs, Inventory Levels
// Output: Allocation Plan (SKU, Fulfillment Center, Quantity)

function calculateAllocationPlan() {

    // 1. Calculate Risk-Adjusted Demand for each SKU and location
    riskAdjustedDemand = calculateRiskAdjustedDemand(demandForecasts, supplierRiskScores);

    // 2. Define Objective Function (Weighted Sum of Costs)
    objectiveFunction(allocationPlan) {
        transportationCost = calculateTransportationCost(allocationPlan);
        stockoutCost = calculateStockoutCost(allocationPlan, riskAdjustedDemand);
        riskExposure = calculateRiskExposure(allocationPlan, supplierRiskScores);

        // Weights can be adjusted based on business priorities
        return (weight1 * transportationCost) + (weight2 * stockoutCost) + (weight3 * riskExposure);
    }

    // 3. Use Optimization Algorithm (e.g., Genetic Algorithm) to minimize Objective Function
    allocationPlan = optimize(objectiveFunction, constraints);  // Constraints: Fulfillment Center Capacity, Minimum/Maximum Allocation Amounts

    // 4. Return Allocation Plan
    return allocationPlan;
}

function calculateRiskAdjustedDemand(demandForecasts, supplierRiskScores) {
  // For each SKU and location:
  // riskAdjustedDemand = demandForecast * (1 - supplierRiskScore)
  // Return riskAdjustedDemand data structure
}

function optimize(objectiveFunction, constraints) {
  // Use Genetic Algorithm, Simulated Annealing, or other optimization technique
  // Iteratively adjust allocation quantities until Objective Function is minimized
  // Respect constraints
  // Return optimal allocation plan
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing cluster for running optimization algorithms.
*   Real-time data ingestion pipeline for receiving data from various sources.
*   Database for storing historical data, forecasts, and allocations.
*   Cloud-based deployment for scalability and reliability.
*   API for integration with existing inventory management systems.
