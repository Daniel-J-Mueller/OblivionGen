**Adaptive Privilege Escalation via Hardware-Based Enclaves**

**Concept:** Extend the existing privilege reduction framework by leveraging hardware-based enclaves (like Intel SGX or AMD SEV) to *dynamically* adjust privilege levels based on runtime behavior, rather than static pre-definition. This moves beyond simply restricting access, to creating a 'sandbox' whose boundaries shift based on observed actions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Enclave Integration:** The ‘wrapper’ described in the patent is re-architected to run *within* a hardware enclave. This provides a strong isolation boundary, even against compromised host OS or hypervisor.
*   **Behavioral Profiling:**  Implement a lightweight, in-enclave behavioral profiler. This monitors the untrusted code's execution for "interesting" events (e.g., accessing sensitive data, attempting network connections, writing to critical memory regions).
*   **Dynamic Privilege Adjustment:**  The profiler outputs 'behavioral tokens' – small data structures representing observed actions. These tokens are used to modulate the enclave's allowed system calls and memory access permissions.  This is done via a dedicated enclave-to-host communication channel.
*   **Policy Engine:** A host-side policy engine translates behavioral tokens into privilege adjustments. This allows administrators to define fine-grained rules (e.g., "if untrusted code attempts DNS lookup, revoke network access"). The policy engine must be robust and tamper-proof.
*   **Attestation:** Before the untrusted code is loaded, the enclave performs remote attestation to verify its integrity and the trustworthiness of the host environment. This prevents malicious actors from injecting compromised code or manipulating the policy engine.
*   **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** The trusted code communicates with the enclave via a secure IPC mechanism (e.g., a dedicated virtual channel). All data exchanged between the trusted code and the enclave is encrypted and authenticated.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Within the Enclave:

function executeUntrustedCode(code, input) {
  behavioralProfile = new BehavioralProfiler();
  behavioralProfile.startMonitoring();

  result = untrustedCode.execute(input);

  behavioralTokens = behavioralProfile.getTokens();
  sendTokensToHost(behavioralTokens);

  return result;
}

// On Host:

function receiveTokens(tokens) {
  policyAdjustments = policyEngine.evaluate(tokens);
  enclave.applyPolicyAdjustments(policyAdjustments);
}

function applyPolicyAdjustments(adjustments) {
  // Modify enclave's allowed syscalls, memory access permissions, etc.
  // Based on adjustments received from the policy engine.
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   CPU with Hardware Enclave Support (Intel SGX, AMD SEV).
*   Secure Memory Controller (SMC) to protect enclave memory.
*   Cryptographic Coprocessor for secure key management.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Enclave SDK (Intel SGX SDK, AMD SEV SDK).
*   Secure IPC Library.
*   Policy Engine Implementation.
*   Behavioral Profiler Implementation.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly enhanced security compared to static privilege reduction.
*   Adaptive security that responds to runtime behavior.
*   Reduced attack surface by isolating untrusted code within a secure enclave.
*   Fine-grained control over untrusted code's access to system resources.
