## Adaptive Magnetometer Array for Dynamic Environment Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the multi-magnetometer approach beyond simple offset detection to create a real-time, dynamic map of magnetic anomalies within a vehicle’s operational environment. This isn’t about *correcting* for interference, but *characterizing* it, and using that characterization for situational awareness.

**Specs:**

*   **Magnetometer Configuration:** Instead of two fixed magnetometers, implement an array of 9-16 micro-magnetometers distributed across the vehicle’s exterior surfaces (e.g., drone chassis, delivery container). These are solid-state, low-power, and individually addressable.  Placement isn't uniform – higher density in areas likely to encounter interference (e.g., near motors, battery compartments).
*   **Data Acquisition:** Each magnetometer samples at 100Hz. Data is time-stamped and transmitted via a dedicated, low-latency bus to the central processing unit.
*   **Processing Unit:** A dedicated co-processor (FPGA or similar) handles the intensive computations.
*   **Mapping Algorithm:**  A Kalman filter is employed to fuse data from all magnetometers, generating a 3D volumetric map of magnetic field strength and direction. The map is updated at 20Hz. This isn't a static map; it dynamically adjusts to moving sources of interference.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** A machine learning algorithm (e.g., autoencoder) is trained on 'normal' magnetic field signatures for the vehicle's typical operating environments. The autoencoder flags deviations from this baseline as potential anomalies.  Thresholds are adaptive, based on the current operating environment.
*   **Output:**
    *   **Visualization:** A real-time visual overlay displays detected magnetic anomalies on a vehicle telemetry dashboard (e.g., a 3D point cloud showing areas of high magnetic disturbance). Color coding indicates anomaly strength and direction.
    *   **Alerts:** Critical anomalies (e.g., strong magnetic fields indicating nearby metal objects or electrical interference) trigger audible and visual alerts.
    *   **Data Logging:** Raw magnetometer data and anomaly maps are logged for post-flight analysis and algorithm refinement.
*   **Power Consumption:** System designed for <5W power draw. Magnetometers operate in low-power sleep mode when not actively sampling.
*   **Calibration:** Automatic, in-situ calibration routine to compensate for sensor drift and environmental factors. This routine runs periodically during operation.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Input:  Magnetometer readings (array of vectors)
// Output: Anomaly score (float)

function detectAnomaly(readings):
  // 1. Calculate expected magnetic field based on baseline model
  expectedField = baselineModel.predict(readings)

  // 2. Calculate difference between actual and expected fields
  error = readings - expectedField

  // 3. Calculate error magnitude
  errorMagnitude = magnitude(error)

  // 4. Apply adaptive threshold
  threshold = baseThreshold * environmentFactor  // environmentFactor adjusts based on operating environment

  // 5. Calculate anomaly score
  if errorMagnitude > threshold:
    anomalyScore = errorMagnitude - threshold
  else:
    anomalyScore = 0

  return anomalyScore
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Drone Navigation:** Detect metal structures (buildings, power lines) for improved obstacle avoidance.
*   **Delivery Systems:** Identify potential jamming sources affecting GPS or wireless communication.
*   **Search and Rescue:** Locate metallic objects (vehicles, debris) in disaster areas.
*   **Geological Surveying:** Map subsurface magnetic anomalies.
