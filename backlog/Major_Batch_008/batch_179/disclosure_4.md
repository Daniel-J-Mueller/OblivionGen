## Dynamic Spectrum Harvesting E-Reader

**Concept:** Expand the photovoltaic harvesting beyond visible and near-infrared light to include ambient radio frequency (RF) energy. Integrate an RF energy harvesting antenna array *within* the e-reader's bezel and light guide structure to supplement power generated from light. This will create a truly self-sufficient device, potentially eliminating the need for wired charging in many use cases.

**Specs:**

*   **Antenna Array:** A phased array of miniature, broadband RF energy harvesting antennas. These antennas will be conformally coated and embedded within the plastic of the e-reader’s bezel, and integrated *into* the light guide's internal structure.  Antenna type: Log-periodic dipole array (LPDA) for broad frequency capture. Target frequency range: 700 MHz – 6 GHz (covering common cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth frequencies).  Spacing: 1 cm between antenna elements.
*   **RF-to-DC Conversion Circuit:**  A highly efficient RF-to-DC converter chip (e.g., based on the Analog Devices LTC3330 or similar) placed on the e-reader’s PCB. The chip will rectify and regulate the harvested RF energy, boosting the voltage to a usable level for charging the battery.
*   **Dynamic Beamforming:** Implement a beamforming algorithm (controlled by the e-reader’s processor) to dynamically steer the antenna array towards the strongest RF sources. This will maximize energy capture. Algorithm considerations: Utilize signal strength indicators (RSSI) from detected Wi-Fi and cellular networks to guide beam steering.
*   **Light Guide Integration:**  Modify the light guide material to allow RF signals to pass through with minimal attenuation. Explore materials with lower dielectric constants and permeabilities at RF frequencies.
*   **Hybrid Power Management:** Develop a power management system that seamlessly switches between and combines energy from the photovoltaic cells, RF harvesting, and (if necessary) a wired charging source. Prioritize RF and Photovoltaic sources before drawing from external power.
*   **Power Budget:** Design a low-power e-reader architecture to minimize energy consumption. Target display technology: E-Ink Carta or similar, known for its low power consumption. Target standby power consumption: < 50 µW. Target active reading power consumption: < 1 mW.

**Pseudocode (Power Management System):**

```
// Variables
photovoltaicPower: float;
rfPower: float;
batteryLevel: int;
chargingRequired: bool;

// Function: Update Power Levels
function updatePowerLevels() {
    photovoltaicPower = readPhotovoltaicSensor();
    rfPower = readRFHarvestingSensor();
    batteryLevel = readBatteryLevel();
}

// Function: Determine Power Source
function determinePowerSource() {
    if (photovoltaicPower > 0.5W || rfPower > 0.5W) {
        // Use harvested energy
        powerSource = "Harvested"
    } else if (batteryLevel < 20) {
        // Use wired charging
        powerSource = "Wired"
    } else {
        powerSource = "Battery"
    }
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    updatePowerLevels();
    determinePowerSource();

    if (powerSource == "Harvested") {
        chargeBattery(photovoltaicPower + rfPower);
    } else if (powerSource == "Wired") {
        chargeBattery(externalPower);
    }
}
```
