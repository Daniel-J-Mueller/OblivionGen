## Dynamic Tag Inheritance & Proactive Recommendation Network

**Concept:** Expand the user-created tag system to allow *dynamic inheritance* of tags based on item relationships *and* build a proactive recommendation network that anticipates user tagging behavior.

**Specs:**

**1. Item Relationship Graph:**

*   **Data Structure:** A directed graph where nodes represent items and edges represent relationships (defined programmatically or through collaborative filtering – see section 3). Edge weights reflect relationship strength.
*   **Relationship Types:** Beyond simple similarity, incorporate relationship *types*:
    *   *Complementary:* Items often purchased/used together.
    *   *Substitute:* Items serving the same purpose.
    *   *ComponentOf:* Items that are parts of a larger item.
    *   *HistoricalAssociation:* Items frequently tagged together, even if not inherently related.
*   **Maintenance:** Graph is continuously updated based on user interactions (purchases, views, tagging) and algorithmic analysis.

**2. Tag Inheritance Engine:**

*   **Functionality:** When a user tags an item, the engine propagates the tag to related items in the graph based on edge weights and inheritance rules.
*   **Inheritance Rules:**
    *   *Weight Threshold:* Tag inherits only if the edge weight exceeds a configurable threshold.
    *   *Relationship Type Filter:* Allow/disallow inheritance based on relationship type (e.g., inherit “comfortable” from shoes to related insoles, but not from cameras).
    *   *User Override:* Users can explicitly disable tag inheritance for specific items.
*   **Visualization:** Display inherited tags subtly to the user, indicating their origin.

**3. Predictive Tagging Model:**

*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.
*   **Input Data:**
    *   User interaction history (views, purchases, tags).
    *   Item attributes (category, price, description).
    *   Item relationship graph data (neighboring nodes, edge weights).
*   **Output:** Probability distribution over potential tags for the current item.
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Train the LSTM on aggregated user data.
    *   During item viewing, the model predicts the most relevant tags.
    *   Present tag suggestions to the user.

**4. Proactive Recommendation Engine:**

*   **Core Logic:** Combines tag inheritance and predictive tagging.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  User views/interacts with an item.
    2.  Tag Inheritance Engine propagates existing tags to related items.
    3.  Predictive Tagging Model generates potential tags for the current item.
    4.  Recommendation Engine identifies items associated with:
        *   Inherited tags.
        *   Predicted tags.
        *   Items that *would* receive those tags if the user tagged them.
    5.  Recommendations are presented to the user.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Recommendation):**

```
function generateRecommendations(userID, itemID):
  inheritedTags = getInheritedTags(itemID)
  predictedTags = getPredictedTags(userID, itemID)
  allTags = inheritedTags + predictedTags

  candidateItems = []
  for tag in allTags:
    candidateItems.extend(getItemsTaggedWith(tag))

  # Rank candidates based on tag relevance and user preferences
  rankedItems = rankItems(userID, candidateItems)

  return topN(rankedItems, 10) // Return top 10 recommendations
```

**Data Storage Requirements:**

*   Item Relationship Graph (Graph Database - Neo4j recommended)
*   User Tag History (Relational Database)
*   Predictive Tagging Model (Serialized Model File)
*   Item Attributes (Relational Database)
