## Dynamic Peer Prioritization & Resource Allocation

**Specification:** A system to dynamically prioritize peers based on predicted network stability and resource availability, enabling optimized delivery of streaming content and minimizing connection disruptions.

**Core Concept:** The current patent establishes a signaling system. This builds on that by adding *proactive* resource management *before* full connection establishment, informed by predictive analytics. Instead of simply facilitating connection, this system *shapes* the connection for optimal performance.

**Components:**

1.  **Predictive Analytics Engine (PAE):** This module gathers data points from potential peers (during initial signaling) including:
    *   Reported bandwidth.
    *   Ping times (Jitter & latency).
    *   Device type & processing power (reported).
    *   Geographic location (for network congestion data).
    *   Historical connection data (if available - a user profile).
    *   Network Interface Type (WiFi, Cellular, Ethernet).

    The PAE uses this data to generate a ‘Stability Score’ – a numerical representation of predicted connection reliability. This score is updated continuously during signaling.

2.  **Resource Allocation Manager (RAM):** This module manages available resources (bandwidth, processing priority) on the streaming server.

3.  **Signaling Interface Modification:** The existing signaling system is modified to transmit the ‘Stability Score’ along with standard signaling information.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Peer Request:** A peer requests access to streaming content.

2.  **Initial Signaling & Stability Scoring:** The initial signaling exchange occurs. Simultaneously, the PAE gathers data from the peer and calculates the ‘Stability Score.’

3.  **RAM Prioritization:** The RAM receives the ‘Stability Score’ and prioritizes resource allocation accordingly. Higher scores receive preferential treatment – potentially allocating more bandwidth, prioritizing processing tasks, or reserving buffer space.

4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system *continuously* monitors connection quality during streaming. If a peer’s connection degrades, its ‘Stability Score’ is recalculated, and resource allocation is adjusted dynamically.

5.  **Peer Swapping:** If a peer’s ‘Stability Score’ falls below a threshold, the system can proactively attempt to find a replacement peer with a higher score, minimizing disruption to the streaming experience.

**Pseudocode (RAM Component):**

```
function allocateResources(peer, stabilityScore) {
  bandwidthAllocation = baseBandwidth;
  processingPriority = normalPriority;

  if (stabilityScore > 90) {
    bandwidthAllocation = highBandwidth;
    processingPriority = highPriority;
  } else if (stabilityScore > 70) {
    bandwidthAllocation = mediumBandwidth;
    processingPriority = mediumPriority;
  } else {
    bandwidthAllocation = lowBandwidth;
    processingPriority = lowPriority;
  }

  return { bandwidth: bandwidthAllocation, priority: processingPriority };
}

function monitorConnection(peer) {
  // Continuous monitoring of connection quality metrics (packet loss, latency, etc.)
  if (connectionQualityDegraded(peer)) {
    peer.stabilityScore = recalculateStabilityScore(peer);
    peer.resources = allocateResources(peer, peer.stabilityScore);
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-Path Streaming:** Utilize multiple peer connections simultaneously, dynamically switching between paths based on stability scores.
*   **Collaborative Bandwidth Management:**  Allow peers to ‘donate’ unused bandwidth to peers with lower stability scores.
*   **AI-Powered Prediction:** Train an AI model on historical connection data to improve the accuracy of stability score predictions.
