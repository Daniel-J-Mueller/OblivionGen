## Dynamic Label Anchoring via Voronoi Diagram Integration

**Concept:** Extend the label placement system by dynamically generating anchor points *within* the inner buffer zone using a Voronoi diagram. Instead of simply centering the label on the centroid of the inner buffer zone, we create a network of potential anchor points representing areas of maximum "free space" within the zone. This allows for more intelligent label positioning, minimizing overlap and improving readability, particularly for complex or irregularly shaped polygons.

**Specs:**

1.  **Voronoi Diagram Generation:**
    *   Input: The reduced set of points defining the perimeter of the inner buffer zone.
    *   Process: Generate a Voronoi diagram within the inner buffer zone using these points as "sites". The Voronoi diagram will partition the inner buffer zone into regions, each associated with a site (perimeter point).  The vertices of the Voronoi diagram represent points equidistant from multiple sites.
    *   Output: A set of Voronoi vertices and regions within the inner buffer zone.

2.  **Anchor Point Selection:**
    *   Input: Voronoi vertices, regions, and the label's dimensions.
    *   Process:
        *   Filter Voronoi vertices:  Discard vertices that are too close to the perimeter of the inner buffer zone (to avoid clipping).
        *   Area Calculation: For each remaining vertex, calculate the area of the Voronoi region associated with it.
        *   Feasibility Check: For each Voronoi region, determine if the label can be fully contained within it without intersecting the perimeter of the inner buffer zone or other labels.
        *   Scoring: Score each feasible region based on its area (larger areas preferred) and proximity to the centroid of the inner buffer zone (closer to the centroid preferred).
    *   Output: A prioritized list of potential anchor points (Voronoi vertices) within the inner buffer zone.

3.  **Label Placement Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Prioritized list of anchor points, label dimensions, and existing label positions.
    *   Process:
        *   Iterate through the prioritized list.
        *   For each anchor point, attempt to place the label at that point.
        *   Collision Detection: Check for collisions with existing labels.
        *   If no collision occurs, place the label and exit.
        *   If a collision occurs, continue to the next anchor point.
        *   If all anchor points are tried and a valid placement is not found, fall back to the original centroid-based placement method.
    *   Output: The final position of the label on the map.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function placeLabel(polygon, reducedPoints, innerBufferZonePoints):
  voronoiDiagram = generateVoronoiDiagram(innerBufferZonePoints)
  feasibleAnchors = filterAndScoreAnchors(voronoiDiagram, labelDimensions)

  for anchor in feasibleAnchors:
    if not labelCollidesWithOthers(anchor, labelDimensions):
      placeLabelAt(anchor, labelDimensions)
      return

  // Fallback to centroid placement
  centroid = calculateCentroid(innerBufferZonePoints)
  placeLabelAt(centroid, labelDimensions)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Re-calculate Voronoi diagrams and re-position labels as the map is zoomed or panned.
*   **Label Prioritization:**  Implement a system to prioritize certain labels over others (e.g., labels for major cities should be placed before labels for minor towns).
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to adjust the weighting of different factors in the label placement algorithm (e.g., prioritize maximizing free space versus proximity to the centroid).
