## Dynamic Sensory Narrative Generation

**Concept:** Expand the ‘shake to reveal’ functionality into a full-bodied interactive narrative experience, leveraging biofeedback alongside accelerometer data to tailor not just *what* content is revealed, but *how* it’s presented sensorially.  Instead of simple recommendations, create branching, personalized stories.

**Specs:**

*   **Biofeedback Integration:** Integrate wearable sensor data (heart rate variability, galvanic skin response, brainwave activity via EEG headsets – optional) alongside accelerometer data from the device. This provides a richer understanding of the user’s emotional and cognitive state.
*   **Narrative Engine:** A narrative engine composed of modular “storylets.” Each storylet represents a discrete narrative segment with associated sensory profiles (visual, auditory, haptic, potentially olfactory – requiring specialized hardware).
*   **Sensory Profiles:**  Each storylet's sensory profile is a weighted combination of sensory components. Example:  A storylet depicting a tense chase scene might have a high weight for low-frequency rumble (haptic), fast-paced rhythmic sound (audio), desaturated color palette and rapid camera movements (visual).
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** The weighting of sensory components within a storylet is dynamically adjusted based on:
    *   **Biofeedback Data:**  Elevated heart rate might increase the intensity of haptic and auditory elements. High GSR could trigger more visually arresting effects.
    *   **Accelerometer Data:**  The force and pattern of “shakes” or movements directly influence the narrative progression. A sharp, jerky shake might indicate a character’s fear, while a slow, deliberate shake could represent careful investigation.
    *   **User History:**  Content preferences gleaned from previous interactions (explicit ratings or implicit behavioral data).
*   **Branching Narrative:**  The narrative engine uses the combined input (biofeedback, accelerometer, history) to select the next storylet from a branching narrative tree. The story adapts in real time to the user’s emotional and physical responses.
*   **Haptic Layer:** Utilize advanced haptic feedback (beyond simple vibration) - textural variation, localized pressure, temperature changes - to create immersive sensory experiences.
*   **Procedural Sensory Generation:** Implement algorithms to procedurally generate sensory content (soundscapes, visual effects, haptic patterns) based on high-level narrative parameters.

**Pseudocode (Narrative Engine Core):**

```
FUNCTION SelectNextStorylet(userBiofeedback, accelerometerData, userHistory, currentStorylet)

  // Calculate emotional/cognitive state from biofeedback
  emotionalState = AnalyzeBiofeedback(userBiofeedback)

  // Determine movement intent from accelerometer data
  movementIntent = AnalyzeAccelerometerData(accelerometerData)

  // Retrieve relevant storylets based on emotional state, movement intent, and user history
  candidateStorylets = GetRelevantStorylets(emotionalState, movementIntent, userHistory, currentStorylet)

  // Score each candidate storylet based on relevance and novelty
  scoredStorylets = ScoreStorylets(candidateStorylets, emotionalState, movementIntent, userHistory)

  // Select the highest-scoring storylet
  nextStorylet = SelectStorylet(scoredStorylets)

  RETURN nextStorylet
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Smartphone or similar device with accelerometer
*   Optional: Wearable sensors (heart rate monitor, GSR sensor, EEG headset)
*   Advanced haptic feedback device (vest, gloves, or specialized phone case) - optional but enhances immersion.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive storytelling and gaming
*   Personalized meditation and mindfulness experiences
*   Emotional regulation training
*   Interactive art installations.
