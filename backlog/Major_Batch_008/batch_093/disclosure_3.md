## Dynamic Availability 'Echo' System

**Concept:** Extend the availability relay system to create a localized “echo” of activity when a user is away. This goes beyond simply knowing *if* someone is away and *when* they’ll be back, to providing a subtle awareness of what’s happening in their physical space while they are absent.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing voice-controlled device augmented with:
    *   Low-resolution ambient visual sensor (think extremely basic, wide-angle camera – prioritizing motion detection over image clarity).
    *   Directional microphone array (to isolate sound sources).
    *   Optional: Simple environmental sensors (temperature, light level).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Activity Signature Generator:*  During a “learning phase” when the user *is* present, the system analyzes ambient audio & visual data to create a baseline “activity signature” for the space. This isn’t about *what* is happening, but the *pattern* of activity. For example, normal office sounds, typical movement paths, etc.
    *   *Anomaly Detection Engine:* When the user is away, this engine compares the current ambient data to the learned activity signature. It flags *deviations* from the norm, not necessarily “threats.” (e.g., prolonged silence, a new sound source, unusual movement patterns.)
    *   *‘Echo’ Relay System:*  The detected anomalies are translated into subtle, customizable “echoes” relayed to the user via their primary device (phone, tablet).  These echoes are *not* full video or audio feeds. Examples:
        *   *Visual ‘Pulse’:* A colored light on the user’s phone screen that pulses faster or slower based on the level of activity detected.
        *   *Auditory ‘Ripple’:*  A very short, ambient sound (e.g., a gentle chime, a subtle water droplet) triggered by significant anomalies.
        *   *Textual ‘Gist’:*  A short, AI-generated phrase summarizing the anomaly (e.g., "Movement detected near the reception area," "Prolonged silence in the office").
    *   *Customization Profiles:* Users can define:
        *   Sensitivity levels (how much deviation is required to trigger an echo).
        *   Echo types (visual, auditory, textual, or a combination).
        *   Priority filtering (ignore anomalies from specific sources – e.g., deliveries).

**Pseudocode (Echo Relay System):**

```
FUNCTION processAmbientData(audioData, visualData):
  activitySignature = calculateActivitySignature(audioData, visualData)
  deviationScore = calculateDeviationScore(activitySignature, audioData, visualData)

  IF deviationScore > sensitivityThreshold:
    anomalyDescription = generateAnomalyDescription(audioData, visualData)
    echoType = getUserPreference("echoType")

    IF echoType == "visual":
      triggerVisualEcho(deviationScore)
    ELSE IF echoType == "auditory":
      triggerAuditoryEcho(deviationScore)
    ELSE IF echoType == "textual":
      sendNotification(anomalyDescription)
    ELSE:
      sendNotification(anomalyDescription)
      triggerVisualEcho(deviationScore)
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simple availability notification. It creates a subtle, ambient awareness of the user's physical space while they are away, providing a sense of “being there” without overwhelming them with data. The focus on *deviation from normal* rather than specific events makes it adaptable and less prone to false alarms. The 'echo' concept itself is unique – aiming for a subtle sensory cue rather than a full information dump.
