## Dynamic Retail Choreography with Swarm Robotics

**Concept:** Expand the “active furniture” concept beyond static repositioning and utility delivery. Integrate a swarm of miniature robots operating *within* and *around* the active furniture to dynamically reconfigure retail displays, personalize customer experiences, and autonomously manage inventory.

**Specs:**

*   **Robot Platform:**
    *   Dimensions: 5cm x 5cm x 3cm.
    *   Locomotion: Micro-tracked or legged, enabling movement across various floor surfaces and gentle ascent/descent onto furniture surfaces.
    *   Payload Capacity: 50g (sufficient for small retail items, displays, sensors).
    *   Power: Wireless inductive charging from floor-embedded power zones (integrated with existing utility grid).  Supplemental power via miniature solar cells on top surface.
    *   Communication: Mesh networking via short-range radio frequency (RF) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
    *   Sensors:
        *   Proximity sensors (infrared/ultrasonic) for obstacle avoidance.
        *   RGB camera for object recognition and visual tracking.
        *   Weight sensor for inventory management.
        *   Microphone for voice command recognition (optional).

*   **Active Furniture Integration:**
    *   Furniture surfaces are equipped with a low-friction, magnetic grid. Robots attach/detach via electromagnets.
    *   Furniture contains localized RF/BLE repeaters to enhance robot communication range.
    *   Furniture's utility couplings provide low-voltage DC power to robots via contact points.

*   **Central Control System:**
    *   Software platform for defining retail display “choreographies” – sequences of robot actions.
    *   AI-powered algorithms for optimizing display layouts based on customer demographics, purchasing history, and real-time sales data.
    *   Real-time robot tracking and collision avoidance system.
    *   Inventory management module – automatically detects low stock levels and triggers robot replenishment actions.
    *   Customer interaction module – enables personalized displays and targeted promotions based on customer proximity and preferences.

*   **Choreography Examples:**
    *   **Dynamic Pricing:** Robots reposition items with discounted prices to higher-visibility locations.
    *   **Personalized Displays:** Robots create customized displays tailored to individual customer profiles as they approach.
    *   **Interactive Storytelling:** Robots create animated displays that tell a story about a product or brand.
    *   **Automated Restocking:** Robots collect low-stock items from a central storage area and replenish displays autonomously.
    *   **“Magic Mirror” Functionality:** Robots project augmented reality overlays onto items, allowing customers to visualize products in different colors or configurations.

*   **Pseudocode (Choreography Definition):**

```
Choreography "WelcomeCustomer"
{
  Event: CustomerProximityDetected (CustomerID)

  Actions:
  {
    // Retrieve customer preferences
    preferences = GetCustomerPreferences(CustomerID)

    // Create a personalized display based on preferences
    displayItems = SelectItemsBasedOnPreferences(preferences)

    // Assign robots to reposition items
    for each item in displayItems
    {
      AssignRobotToItem(item)
      Robot.MoveToLocation(preferredDisplayLocation)
    }
  }
}
```

*   **Materials:** Lightweight alloys (aluminum, magnesium), high-strength polymers, miniature electronics, magnetic materials.
