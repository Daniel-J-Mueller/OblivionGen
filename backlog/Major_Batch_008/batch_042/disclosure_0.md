## Dynamic Policy Mirroring & Predictive Access

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic identity consolidation by *mirroring* policies not just across existing groups, but proactively predicting access needs based on user behavior and historical data. This goes beyond simply consolidating *current* permissions – it anticipates what a user *will* need, granting temporary, time-limited access before a request is even made.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Behavioral Analytics Engine (BAE):**
    *   Input: User activity logs (application usage, data access, resource requests), historical access patterns, time-of-day, location data (optional).
    *   Process: Employ machine learning models (e.g., LSTM networks, Markov chains) to predict likely resource access within a defined timeframe (e.g., next hour, next day). Model updates continuously based on user behavior.  Output is a probability score for each resource.
    *   Output:  Predicted resource access list with associated confidence levels.

*   **Component 2: Provisional Policy Generator (PPG):**
    *   Input: Predicted resource access list (from BAE), existing user group policies, defined confidence threshold.
    *   Process: If the confidence level for a resource exceeds the threshold, create a *temporary* policy granting access. This policy is assigned to the provisional identity alongside existing consolidated policies. The policy includes a time-to-live (TTL) parameter.
    *   Output: Augmented provisional identity with temporary policies.

*   **Component 3:  Dynamic Policy Auditor (DPA):**
    *   Input: User activity logs, provisional identity policies, TTL parameters.
    *   Process: Monitor user activity. When a temporary policy’s TTL expires, or if the user does *not* access the associated resource, the policy is automatically revoked. Revocation triggers a notification to security administrators (optional).
    *   Output: Updated provisional identity with revoked policies; audit logs.

**Pseudocode (PPG):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateProvisionalPolicy(predictedAccessList, userGroupPolicies, confidenceThreshold):
  provisionalPolicies = userGroupPolicies  // Start with existing policies

  FOR EACH resource IN predictedAccessList:
    IF resource.confidence > confidenceThreshold:
      //Create a temporary policy
      tempPolicy = {
        resource: resource.name,
        permissions: resource.permissions,
        ttl: CalculateTTL(resource.accessFrequency, defaultTTL) //Calculate TTL based on historical access
      }
      provisionalPolicies.append(tempPolicy)
  RETURN provisionalPolicies
```

**Integration with existing system:**

1.  The BAE runs as a background process, constantly analyzing user activity.
2.  When a new user login is detected (as in the provided patent), the existing dynamic identity consolidation process is initiated.
3.  *Before* assigning policies to the provisional identity, the BAE’s predicted access list is retrieved.
4.  The PPG uses this list to generate temporary policies, which are then added to the provisional identity.
5.  The DPA continuously monitors policy validity and revokes expired or unused policies.
