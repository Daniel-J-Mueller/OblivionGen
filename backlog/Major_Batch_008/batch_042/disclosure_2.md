## Adaptive Environmental Sonification System

**Concept:** Utilizing the multi-camera system not for *visual* object identification and overlay, but as input for a real-time, spatially-aware soundscape. The device will analyze movement and position of objects – people, furniture, even air currents detected via subtle visual cues – and translate that data into an ambient soundscape.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Employ all four corner cameras (or more, if feasible) as the primary input. Each camera will feed data into a dedicated processing pipeline.
*   **Object Detection/Tracking:** Utilize a lightweight object detection model optimized for speed and low power consumption. Focus on detecting *change* rather than precise object categorization.  The system needs to determine *something* is moving, changing size/shape, or entering/exiting the camera's field of view.
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:** Core component. Takes the 3D positional data from the camera array and generates a corresponding soundscape.
    *   Sound sources are dynamically created and positioned in 3D space.
    *   Sound characteristics (tone, volume, timbre, effects) are determined by:
        *   **Object Velocity:** Faster movement = higher pitch/intensity.
        *   **Proximity:** Closer objects = louder/more prominent sounds.
        *   **Object Size/Shape (Estimated):** Larger objects = deeper/richer sounds.  Abstract shapes could trigger specific sound textures.
        *   **Object Type (If detectable):**  Different broad categories (person, furniture, unknown) could trigger different sound 'families.'  Avoid specific 'person' sounds - more abstract patterns.
*   **Environmental Filtering:**  Integrate data from other device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone) to shape the soundscape.
    *   **Device Movement:** Compensate for device movement so the soundscape remains stable.
    *   **Ambient Noise:**  Adaptive filtering to blend the generated soundscape with existing environmental sounds.
    *   **Orientation:**  The soundscape should subtly shift based on device orientation (e.g., a gentle panning effect when rotating the device).
*   **User Customization:** 
    *   **Sound Palette:** Allow users to select from a range of pre-defined sound palettes (e.g., "Forest," "Ocean," "Minimalist").
    *   **Sensitivity:** Adjustable sensitivity settings to control the responsiveness of the system.
    *   **Sound Mixing:** Simple sliders to adjust the volume of different sound elements (e.g., movement, proximity, ambient).

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
FOR EACH Frame:
    1.  Capture Images from All Cameras
    2.  Process Images for Movement/Change Detection
    3.  Calculate 3D Position of Moving Objects
    4.  FOR EACH Moving Object:
            a.  Determine Velocity, Proximity, Estimated Size/Shape
            b.  Generate Sound Event based on these parameters
            c.  Position Sound Event in 3D Space
    5.  Mix all Sound Events with Ambient Sound and Device Orientation Data
    6.  Output Audio to Headphones/Speakers
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Accessibility:**  Provide a "sound map" of the environment for visually impaired users.
*   **Focus Enhancement:**  Create a subtle, dynamic soundscape to mask distractions and promote concentration.
*   **Ambient Awareness:**  Subtly alert users to movement or changes in their surroundings.
*   **Artistic Expression:**  Allow users to create unique and immersive sound experiences.
