**Adaptive Communication Bubbles**

**Concept:** Extend the restricted communication concept to create dynamic, user-defined “communication bubbles” beyond simple parental controls. These bubbles dictate *how* and *when* communication occurs, not just *who* can communicate.

**Specs:**

*   **Bubble Creation:** Users (parents, guardians, or even the users themselves, age permitting) define communication bubbles. These bubbles have customizable parameters.
*   **Parameter Options:**
    *   **Time-Based Restrictions:**  Standard time windows for allowed communication.
    *   **Content Filtering:**  Basic keyword filtering, but expanded to sentiment analysis (block messages with excessive negativity or aggression).
    *   **Communication Style Restrictions:** Define allowed communication methods *within* a bubble.  E.g., “Emergency Contacts Only – Voice Calls Only”,  “School Friends – Text Messages Only”, “Family – All Communication Methods”, “Work – Email Only”.
    *   **Priority Levels:** Designate contacts with “priority” levels. Higher priority contacts *always* bypass certain restrictions, or receive faster notification.
    *   **Emotional State Detection (Optional):** Utilizing device sensor data (voice tone analysis, typing speed, etc.) to assess the user's emotional state. Adjust bubble restrictions accordingly (e.g., if a user is detected to be highly stressed, temporarily restrict all non-emergency communication). *Requires explicit user permission and transparency.*
    *   **Location-Based Bubbles:**  Activate/deactivate bubbles based on the user's location.  (E.g., “School Zone” bubble activates strict communication limits, “Home” bubble relaxes restrictions).
*   **Device Integration:**  The system operates across all connected devices (phones, tablets, computers). Communication attempts are routed based on the *receiving* user’s current bubble settings.
*   **Bubble Chaining:**  Allow users to create complex bubble chains. (E.g.,  “School Day” bubble triggers a “Focus Mode” bubble that silences all notifications except for priority contacts).

**Pseudocode (Communication Attempt):**

```
function handleIncomingCommunication(sender, messageType, messageContent) {
  user = getReceivingUser()
  currentBubbles = getUserBubbles(user)

  // 1. Check for global block (user-defined "Do Not Disturb")
  if (user.doNotDisturb) {
    rejectCommunication("User is in Do Not Disturb mode.")
    return
  }

  // 2. Evaluate bubbles based on sender and message type
  for (bubble in currentBubbles) {
    if (bubble.senderWhitelist.includes(sender) || bubble.senderBlacklist.excludes(sender)) {
      if (bubble.allowedMessageTypes.includes(messageType)) {

        // 3.  Apply content filtering
        filteredContent = applyContentFilter(messageContent, bubble.contentFilterSettings)
        if (filteredContent == null) { // content blocked
          rejectCommunication("Content blocked by bubble settings")
          return
        }

        // 4. Apply emotional state analysis (if enabled)
        if (bubble.emotionalStateAnalysisEnabled) {
            emotionalState = analyzeEmotionalState(messageContent)
            if (emotionalState == "negative" && bubble.blockNegativeContent) {
                rejectCommunication("Negative content blocked by bubble settings")
                return
            }
        }

        // 5. Deliver communication
        deliverCommunication(sender, messageType, filteredContent)
        return
      }
    }
  }

  // 6. No matching bubble found – reject communication
  rejectCommunication("Communication not allowed by current bubble settings.")
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Device with communication capabilities (phone, tablet, computer).
*   Cloud-based communication management platform.
*   Machine learning models for content filtering and sentiment analysis.
*   Secure communication protocols.
*   Cross-platform compatibility (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS).
