## Personalized Wireless Package Prediction & Proactive Ordering

**Core Concept:** Leverage user behavioral data *beyond* stated preferences to predict optimal wireless packages *before* the user explicitly searches, and proactively initiate the ordering process with confirmation.

**System Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion Module:**
    *   Collects data from multiple sources:
        *   User-provided preferences (as per patent – device features, price range, service needs).
        *   App usage patterns (data consumption by app category – streaming, social media, gaming).
        *   Location data (home, work, frequent travel destinations – signal strength analysis).
        *   Device usage patterns (peak usage times, common features used).
        *   Social network data (optional, with explicit user consent – identifying commonly used apps/services amongst peers).
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:**
    *   Employs a multi-layered neural network.
        *   **Layer 1 (Preference Encoding):** Processes explicit user preferences into a vector representation.
        *   **Layer 2 (Behavioral Analysis):** Analyzes behavioral data, identifying usage patterns and predicted data consumption.  Weighted by time (recent data receives higher weighting).
        *   **Layer 3 (Package Compatibility):** Evaluates compatible wireless packages based on device compatibility and service availability (as per patent).
        *   **Layer 4 (Personalized Scoring):** Assigns a “Personalized Suitability Score” to each package, factoring in preference match, predicted usage, historical performance of similar packages with similar users, and a “surprise factor” (introducing potentially beneficial, but not explicitly requested, features).
*   **Proactive Ordering Module:**
    *   When the “Personalized Suitability Score” exceeds a threshold (configurable by the user), the system initiates a *preview* of the recommended package.
    *   The preview includes:
        *   Package details (device, plan, price).
        *   A “Predicted Savings” estimate (compared to the user’s current plan).
        *   A “Usage Projection” graph (showing predicted data consumption with the new plan).
        *   An “Auto-Confirm” button.
    *   If the user clicks “Auto-Confirm”, the order is initiated. If not, the recommendation remains visible for a set duration or until dismissed.
*   **Adaptive Learning Module:**
    *   Continuously refines the predictive model based on user feedback (e.g., package selection, feature usage, service satisfaction).
    *   Employs reinforcement learning to optimize the “Personalized Suitability Score” and the proactive ordering threshold.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Learning Module):**

```
FUNCTION UpdateModel(user_data, package_selected, usage_data, satisfaction_score):
  # Calculate reward based on user feedback
  IF package_selected == TRUE:
    reward = satisfaction_score + 0.5  # Higher satisfaction = higher reward
  ELSE:
    reward = -0.2  # Negative reward for rejecting recommendation

  # Update model parameters using reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning)
  Q(state, action) = Q(state, action) + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * max(Q(next_state, all_actions)) - Q(state, action))

  # Update user profile with new data (usage patterns, preferences)
  user_profile.update(usage_data)
  user_profile.update(preferences)

  RETURN updated_model, updated_user_profile
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply *presenting* ranked packages. It actively *predicts* the user’s needs and proactively initiates the ordering process, automating a traditionally manual and time-consuming task. The adaptive learning module ensures that the system continuously improves its accuracy and relevance.
