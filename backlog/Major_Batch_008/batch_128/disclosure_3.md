## Dynamic Impression Prioritization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, eye tracking) from the user to dynamically adjust the prioritization and presentation of directed content within the screensaver/inactivity window. This moves beyond simple time-offset engagement scores to assess *actual* user attentiveness and emotional response.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Compatible biofeedback sensor(s) – wearable band or integrated into the display device (e.g., subtle sensors within the bezel) capable of measuring HRV, skin conductance, and eye tracking data.
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time data analysis (integrated into the device or cloud-based).
*   **Software:**
    *   Biofeedback Data Acquisition Module: Collects and preprocesses raw biofeedback signals. Noise filtering, artifact rejection, and signal standardization are required.
    *   Attentiveness/Emotional State Engine: Employs machine learning algorithms (trained on labeled biofeedback data) to infer the user’s current attentiveness level (focused, distracted, drowsy) and emotional state (positive, negative, neutral). Model must update in real-time.
    *   Impression Prioritization Algorithm: Adjusts the queue of directed content impressions based on inferred user state.
        *   *High Attentiveness/Positive Emotion*: Prioritize higher-value/longer-form content; increase the likelihood of interactive ads.
        *   *Low Attentiveness/Negative Emotion*: Prioritize calming/familiar content; reduce ad frequency; potentially show 'comfort' content or non-directed assets.
        *   *Drowsy*: Present low-stimulation content, or even transition into a fully inactive screen state.
    *   Dynamic Ad Allocation: An algorithm which will determine how much allocation there should be for directed content. This is to allow more control over the overall directed content strategy.
    *   Queue Management: A sophisticated queuing system capable of re-ordering and filtering content in real-time.
    *   API for Integration: Seamless integration with existing content streaming services and ad servers.
*   **Pseudocode (Impression Prioritization Algorithm):**

```
function prioritizeImpressions(userState, impressionQueue):
    if userState.attentiveness > 0.7 AND userState.emotion == "positive":
        // Prioritize high-value content
        sortedQueue = sortQueueByValue(impressionQueue, "value", descending)
        return sortedQueue
    else if userState.attentiveness < 0.3 OR userState.emotion == "negative":
        // Prioritize calming/familiar content
        calmingContent = filterQueueByCategory(impressionQueue, "calming")
        familiarContent = filterQueueByHistory(impressionQueue, user.viewedContent)
        sortedQueue = combineAndSort(calmingContent, familiarContent, "familiarity")
        return sortedQueue
    else:
        // Default prioritization (e.g., based on recency or predicted engagement)
        sortedQueue = sortQueueByPredictedEngagement(impressionQueue)
        return sortedQueue
```

*   **Data Logging & Analysis:** Log biofeedback data, content presentation history, and user interactions for continuous model improvement and personalization.

**Innovation:** This approach moves beyond *reactive* engagement scoring (based on past actions) to *proactive* content delivery based on real-time user physiological state. This could significantly improve ad effectiveness, user experience, and potentially even provide insights into user well-being. By learning what content elicits positive responses, the system can curate a more engaging and personalized experience, even during periods of inactivity.
