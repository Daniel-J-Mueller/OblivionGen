## Dynamic Assembly-Based Code Similarity & Provenance

**Concept:** Extend the binary decomposition and similarity matching to operate not just on static data (classes, methods) but also on dynamically generated assembly instructions during runtime. This allows identification of code patterns *even if* the source code is heavily obfuscated, polymorphic, or doesn’t exist in a traditional repository. It further provides a provenance trail based on runtime behavior, not just static analysis.

**Specifications:**

**1. Runtime Instrumentation Agent:**

*   **Language Support:** C, C++, .NET (C#, VB.NET), Java, Python (with appropriate limitations).
*   **Instrumentation Points:** Entry/Exit of functions, basic block boundaries, conditional branches, memory access (read/write).
*   **Data Collection:**
    *   Disassembled instruction sequences (assembly code).
    *   Register values at instrumentation points.
    *   Memory addresses accessed.
    *   Call graphs (dynamically constructed).
*   **Output Format:** A stream of “runtime traces” – structured data representing the runtime behavior of the application.  Data should include timestamp, process ID, thread ID, instruction address, disassembled instruction, register state, and memory access details.

**2. Runtime Trace Analysis Engine:**

*   **Assembly Pattern Matching:** Utilize a pattern matching algorithm (e.g., Aho-Corasick, or a more advanced sequence alignment algorithm) to identify recurring assembly code sequences within runtime traces.  Implement a weighting system for instruction types (e.g., arithmetic operations, control flow instructions) to prioritize meaningful patterns.
*   **Signature Generation:**  Generate a “runtime signature” for each identified pattern. This signature consists of:
    *   A hash of the assembly code sequence.
    *   A statistical profile of register usage.
    *   A summary of memory access patterns (e.g., frequently accessed addresses, types of data accessed).
*   **Signature Database:** Store generated runtime signatures in a scalable database (e.g., a time-series database optimized for similarity search).
*   **Provenance Tracking:**  Link runtime signatures to the originating binary executable and, if possible, the source code repository (using static analysis techniques).  This builds a dynamic provenance graph showing how code is executed and connected across different binaries.

**3.  Similarity Search & Matching:**

*   **Querying:**  Allow users to query the signature database using:
    *   A binary executable file.
    *   A code snippet (assembly or source).
    *   A runtime trace.
*   **Similarity Metric:** Implement a similarity metric that considers both code similarity (based on assembly code and control flow) and behavioral similarity (based on register usage and memory access patterns).
*   **Matching Algorithm:** Use a nearest neighbor search algorithm (e.g., Annoy, Faiss) to efficiently find similar runtime signatures in the database.

**Pseudocode (Signature Generation):**

```
function generateRuntimeSignature(instructionSequence, registerState, memoryAccessData):
  hashValue = calculateHash(instructionSequence)
  registerProfile = calculateRegisterProfile(registerState)
  memoryProfile = calculateMemoryProfile(memoryAccessData)
  signature = {
    "hash": hashValue,
    "registers": registerProfile,
    "memory": memoryProfile
  }
  return signature
```

**Pseudocode (Similarity Search):**

```
function findSimilarSignatures(querySignature, signatureDatabase, similarityThreshold):
  similarSignatures = []
  for signature in signatureDatabase:
    similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(querySignature, signature)
    if similarityScore >= similarityThreshold:
      similarSignatures.append(signature)
  return similarSignatures
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Malware Analysis:** Identify malicious code patterns by comparing runtime behavior to known malware signatures.
*   **Code Clone Detection:** Find code clones across different applications, even if the source code is obfuscated or unavailable.
*   **Software Supply Chain Security:**  Trace the provenance of code components and identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Runtime Vulnerability Detection:** Identify anomalous runtime behavior that may indicate a security vulnerability.
