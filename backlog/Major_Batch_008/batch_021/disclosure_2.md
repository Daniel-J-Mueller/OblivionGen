## Secure Device Mesh with Dynamic Trust Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the trust establishment beyond a single hub-device/short-range device pairing to create a dynamic, self-healing mesh network where trust is propagated and validated across multiple devices. This allows for more robust and scalable secure communication, particularly useful in IoT environments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device Roles:**

*   **Root Device:** The initial trusted device establishing the mesh. Possesses a pre-configured cryptographic key or is provisioned securely.
*   **Mesh Node:** Any device joining the mesh.  Trust is established via proximity and validation through the mesh.
*   **Validator Node:** A mesh node temporarily designated to validate trust claims of new nodes joining the mesh. Validators rotate dynamically.

**2. Trust Establishment Protocol (Beyond Hub-Device):**

*   **Proximity Detection:** Devices utilize short-range communication (e.g., Bluetooth Low Energy) to detect nearby devices.
*   **Trust Claim Initiation:** A new device (Claimant) sends a “Trust Request” to a nearby Validator Node. The request includes a public key, device identifier, and optionally, a manufacturer attestation.
*   **Validator Query:** The Validator Node broadcasts a query to other mesh nodes: “Is this Claimant known and trusted?”  This query uses a secure, encrypted broadcast channel.
*   **Reputation Scoring:** Each responding node assigns a “Trust Score” based on its prior interactions with the Claimant (if any) and/or known information about the Claimant's manufacturer.
*   **Aggregate Trust:** The Validator Node aggregates the Trust Scores, applying a weighted average based on the reputation of the responding nodes.
*   **Trust Certificate Issuance:** If the Aggregate Trust exceeds a threshold, the Validator Node signs a "Trust Certificate" using its private key, attesting to the Claimant’s trustworthiness. This certificate includes a validity period.
*   **Certificate Propagation:** The Trust Certificate is propagated throughout the mesh. Devices cache certificates for faster validation.
*   **Dynamic Validator Selection:** Validator roles rotate periodically, or when a validator’s Trust Score falls below a threshold. Selection is based on a reputation system and network load balancing.

**3. Data Communication Protocol:**

*   **Encrypted Messaging:** All data communication within the mesh is end-to-end encrypted using keys derived from the Trust Certificates.
*   **Multi-Hop Routing:** Messages can be routed through multiple hops to reach their destination, increasing network range and resilience.
*   **Adaptive Routing:** The routing algorithm dynamically adjusts based on network conditions, device availability, and security considerations.

**4. Pseudocode (Trust Claim Initiation & Validation):**

```
// Claimant (New Device)

function initiateTrustClaim(validatorNode):
  send TrustRequest(publicKey, deviceID, manufacturerAttestation) to validatorNode

// Validator Node

function receiveTrustRequest(trustRequest):
  broadcast Query(claimantPublicKey, claimantDeviceID) to all meshNodes
  responses = collect responses from meshNodes
  aggregateTrustScore = calculateAggregateTrustScore(responses)
  if aggregateTrustScore > trustThreshold:
    trustCertificate = sign(trustCertificateData, privateKey)
    send trustCertificate to claimant
  else:
    send rejectionMessage to claimant

// Mesh Node (Responding to Query)
function receiveQuery(claimantPublicKey, claimantDeviceID):
  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(claimantPublicKey, claimantDeviceID) // based on prior interactions or known manufacturer data
  send Response(trustScore)
```

**5. System Components:**

*   **Secure Bootloader:** Ensures only trusted software can run on each device.
*   **Cryptographic Engine:** Provides hardware-accelerated encryption and digital signature operations.
*   **Wireless Communication Module:** Supports short-range and potentially long-range communication protocols.
*   **Secure Storage:** Protects cryptographic keys and sensitive data.
*   **Mesh Network Manager:** Manages mesh topology, routing, and trust relationships.



This system creates a dynamic, self-healing mesh network where trust is established and maintained through a distributed consensus mechanism, improving security and scalability beyond the limitations of a simple hub-device pairing.  The rotating validator roles and dynamic trust scoring add resilience against compromised or malicious devices.
