## Adaptive Resonance Bone Conduction System

**Concept:** A bone conduction system that dynamically adjusts resonance frequencies based on user activity and physiological signals, maximizing clarity and minimizing perceived vibration.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated sensors within the head-mounted wearable device (HMWD) including:
    *   Accelerometer (detects head movement, activity level).
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor (detects heart rate variability - HRV).
    *   Surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors (detect muscle tension around the jaw and temples – proxies for speech/bite force/focus).
*   **Actuation:** Miniature, high-precision piezoelectric actuators integrated *within* the outer plate of the bone conduction speaker. These are not for primary sound generation, but for subtle *tuning* of the plate’s resonant frequency.  Each actuator will be independently controllable.
*   **Control System:**  A microcontroller with a dedicated DSP (Digital Signal Processor).
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  Real-time data acquisition from the sensor suite.
        2.  Feature extraction: Derive metrics from raw sensor data (e.g., activity level, stress level via HRV, jaw movement patterns).
        3.  Resonance Mapping:  A pre-defined lookup table (or learned model) linking sensor data to optimal resonant frequencies for the bone conduction speaker. This map considers both acoustic properties *and* the user's physiological state.
        4.  Actuation Control:  The DSP calculates the necessary voltage to apply to each piezoelectric actuator to achieve the target resonant frequency.  This involves a feedback loop using a small, integrated microphone positioned near the bone conduction speaker to monitor the actual resonant frequency and correct for any deviations.
*   **Speaker Construction:** Modified from existing design.
    *   Outer Plate: Constructed of a composite material with anisotropic properties (different stiffness in different directions) to enable more precise control of resonance.
    *   Piezoelectric Element:  Larger surface area, segmented into multiple individually addressable zones.
    *   Low & High Damping Layers: Retained, optimized for the new composite materials.
*   **Power Management:** Low-power design, utilizing a dedicated power management IC (PMIC) to optimize energy consumption of the sensor suite, DSP, and actuators.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
while (true) {
  sensorData = readSensors();
  activityLevel = extractActivity(sensorData);
  stressLevel = extractStress(sensorData);
  jawMovement = extractJawMovement(sensorData);

  targetFrequency = lookupResonance(activityLevel, stressLevel, jawMovement);

  error = targetFrequency - currentFrequency; //currentFrequency derived from microphone feedback

  actuationSignal = PID_control(error); //Applies Proportional-Integral-Derivative control

  applyActuationSignal(actuationSignal);

  delay(10ms); //Loop at 100Hz
}
```

**Innovation:** Current bone conduction systems rely on fixed resonance frequencies, which are suboptimal for varying conditions. This design actively *adapts* the speaker’s resonance to the user’s activity and physiological state, potentially increasing clarity, reducing perceived vibration, and improving overall user experience. The integration of physiological signals opens up possibilities for biofeedback applications and personalized audio tuning.
