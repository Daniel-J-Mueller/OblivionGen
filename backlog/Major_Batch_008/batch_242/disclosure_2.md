## Dynamic Emotional Inflection via Biofeedback

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the premise of dynamically allocating resources to TTS tasks, but extends it to incorporate real-time biofeedback data from the *listener* to modulate emotional inflection in synthesized speech. The goal is to create a more engaging and personalized auditory experience.

**Components:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensor Suite:**  Wearable sensors (e.g., EEG, GSR, heart rate variability) capture listener physiological data.  Initial focus: emotional valence (positive/negative) and arousal (high/low).
2.  **Real-time Emotion Classifier:** An AI model, trained on labeled biofeedback data, interprets sensor signals and estimates the listener’s current emotional state.  Output: Valence score (-1 to +1), Arousal level (0-10).
3.  **TTS Engine with Parameter Control:**  A TTS engine with granular control over prosody – pitch, speed, volume, emphasis, and timbre. Crucially, this engine allows for dynamic adjustment of these parameters *during* speech synthesis – not just pre-generation.
4.  **Emotional Mapping Module:**  This module translates the emotion classifier’s output into specific adjustments to the TTS engine’s prosodic parameters.  A lookup table or learned model defines the mapping.  Example:  High arousal & Positive valence -> Increased pitch range, faster speech rate, brighter timbre. Negative valence/low arousal -> Lower pitch, slower rate, softer timbre.
5.  **Resource Allocation Prioritization:** The existing resource allocation system is augmented.  Tasks are now prioritized *not only* by playback duration and time since origination but also by the estimated emotional impact on the listener (derived from the emotional mapping and the listener’s current state). Higher emotional impact tasks receive more processing resources for finer prosodic control.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    1.  Receive TTS Task (text, priority)
    2.  Capture Listener Biofeedback Data
    3.  Classify Listener Emotional State (valence, arousal)
    4.  Determine Target Prosodic Parameters (based on text *and* listener state)
    5.  Calculate Emotional Impact Score (based on target prosody and current state)
    6.  Adjust Task Priority (original priority + emotional impact score)
    7.  Allocate Resources (based on adjusted priority, playback duration, origination time)
    8.  Synthesize Speech (using dynamically adjusted prosodic parameters)
    9.  Deliver Speech
    10. Repeat
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Data Rate:** Minimum 30Hz for all sensors.
*   **Emotion Classification Accuracy:** Target >85% accuracy in identifying broad emotional states (happy, sad, angry, neutral).
*   **Prosodic Parameter Range:**  TTS engine must support at least the following adjustable parameters: pitch range (5 semitones), speech rate (0.5x - 2x), volume (dB), emphasis (dB), timbre (EQ settings).
*   **Resource Allocation Algorithm:**  Hybrid approach.  Prioritize tasks with: 1) Lowest progress time (as in original patent) AND 2) Highest emotional impact score.
*   **API:** Public API for integrating with third-party biofeedback devices and TTS engines.
*   **Training Data:**  Large dataset of labeled biofeedback data paired with emotional speech samples.
*   **Error Handling:**  Robust error handling for unreliable sensor data (e.g., signal loss, noise). Fallback to default prosodic settings in case of error.
