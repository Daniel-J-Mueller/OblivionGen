## Dynamic Bundle Composition & Staged Activation

**Specification:** A system for dynamically composing software bundles *after* download, and activating components in a staged manner, independent of the initial bundle definition.

**Core Concept:** Instead of downloading a monolithic bundle, the system downloads a "bundle manifest" â€“ a list of modules/features with versioning and dependency information. The actual module download and activation are decoupled and happen on-demand or proactively based on system analysis.

**Components:**

*   **Bundle Manifest Server:** Hosts bundle manifests. Manifests contain metadata about available modules, dependencies, integrity checks, and activation profiles.
*   **Module Repository:** Stores individual software modules (compiled code, scripts, assets, etc.).  Can be a CDN, a distributed storage network, or a local cache.
*   **Composition Engine:** Located on the computing device. Responsible for:
    *   Downloading bundle manifests.
    *   Resolving dependencies between modules.
    *   Downloading necessary modules from the repository.
    *   Applying integrity checks (digital signatures, checksums).
    *   Managing module versions and conflicts.
*   **Activation Manager:** Controls the loading and execution of activated modules. Handles runtime dependencies, resource allocation, and error handling.
*   **System Analyzer:**  Monitors system state (hardware, software, user behavior) to proactively identify and download/activate potentially useful modules. 

**Workflow:**

1.  **Manifest Request:** The System Analyzer determines a need for new functionality or updates. It requests a bundle manifest from the Manifest Server.
2.  **Manifest Download & Resolution:** The Composition Engine downloads the manifest and resolves all dependencies.  A dependency graph is created.
3.  **Module Download:**  Based on the dependency graph, the Composition Engine downloads required modules from the Module Repository. Modules are cached locally.
4.  **Staged Activation:** Instead of activating all modules at once, the Activation Manager activates them in stages based on priority, resource availability, and runtime context.  This minimizes impact on system performance and user experience.
5.  **Runtime Monitoring & Adaptation:** The System Analyzer continues to monitor system state and user behavior.  It can dynamically activate or deactivate modules, download new modules, or update existing ones as needed.

**Pseudocode (Activation Manager - Staged Activation):**

```
function activateModule(moduleID, priority):
  if module not already loaded:
    if resourceAvailable():
      loadModule(moduleID)
      setModuleState(moduleID, "running")
      return true
    else:
      queueModule(moduleID, priority) //Add to activation queue
      return false
  else:
    return true

function processActivationQueue():
  while queue not empty:
    module = getHighestPriorityModuleFromQueue()
    if resourceAvailable():
      loadModule(module.id)
      setModuleState(module.id, "running")
      removeModuleFromQueue(module)
    else:
      //Resource unavailable - wait and retry later.
      wait(delayTime)
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond pre-defined bundles, offering a more flexible and dynamic approach to software distribution and activation.  It enables personalized experiences, just-in-time updates, and improved resource management. The staged activation minimizes system disruption and allows for proactive adaptation to changing conditions. This also greatly reduces the size of initial downloads.
