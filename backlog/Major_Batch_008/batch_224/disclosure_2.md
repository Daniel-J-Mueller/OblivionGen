## Modular Camera System - "Chameleon"

**Concept:** A camera system comprised of magnetically attaching, functionally independent modules. The core is a minimal "brain" module containing the image sensor, basic processing, and power regulation. All other functionalities – lens, viewfinder, grip, flash, external display, battery – are separate modules that connect to this core.

**Module Specs:**

*   **Core Module (CM):**
    *   Dimensions: 50mm x 40mm x 20mm.
    *   Image Sensor: 48MP, 1/1.8” CMOS.
    *   Processor: Dedicated image processing chip (low power).
    *   Connectivity: USB-C, Bluetooth 5.0, Wi-Fi 6.
    *   Power: Internal rechargeable battery (3000mAh).
    *   Mounting: Strong magnetic array (N52 Neodymium) covering the entire rear and sides.
    *   Material: Aluminum alloy with rubberized coating.
*   **Lens Modules (LM):** (Multiple variations)
    *   Mounting: Magnetic attachment to CM.
    *   Communication: Direct data link to CM.
    *   Variations:
        *   Wide Angle (16mm, f/2.8)
        *   Standard Zoom (24-70mm, f/2.8)
        *   Telephoto (70-200mm, f/2.8)
        *   Macro (50mm, f/2.8)
        *   Fish-eye (8mm, f/2.0)
    *   Aperture Control: Electronic, via CM.
    *   Focus Control: Electronic, via CM (with optional manual override dial on module).
*   **Viewfinder Module (VM):**
    *   Type: Electronic Viewfinder (EVF).
    *   Resolution: 3.69 million dots.
    *   Magnification: 0.79x.
    *   Mounting: Magnetic attachment to CM (hotshoe style for secure connection).
    *   Controls: Customizable buttons for ISO, aperture, shutter speed.
*   **Grip Module (GM):**
    *   Ergonomic grip with customizable button layout.
    *   Integrated shutter button and control dial.
    *   Optional: Built-in stabilization (MEMS gyroscopes).
    *   Mounting: Magnetic attachment to CM.
*   **Flash Module (FM):**
    *   Type: LED flash (adjustable intensity and color temperature).
    *   Mounting: Magnetic attachment to CM (hotshoe style for secure connection).
    *   Controls: TTL/Manual mode.
*   **Display Module (DM):**
    *   Type: Articulating touchscreen LCD (3.5” or larger).
    *   Resolution: 1.23 million dots.
    *   Mounting: Magnetic attachment to CM.
    *   Controls: Customizable touchscreen interface.
*   **Battery Module (BM):**
    *   External battery pack (replaceable) that magnetically attaches to the core/other modules.
    *   Capacity: 5000mAh+.
    *   Charging: USB-C.

**Software/Firmware:**

*   Automatic module recognition and configuration.
*   Customizable button mapping.
*   Advanced image processing algorithms.
*   Over-the-air firmware updates.
*   API for third-party module development.

**Pseudocode (Module Connection):**

```
function connectModule(moduleID):
  if (moduleID == "LM1"):
    attachLensModule(lensType = "wideAngle")
  else if (moduleID == "VM1"):
    attachViewfinderModule()
  else if (moduleID == "GM1"):
    attachGripModule()
  else if (moduleID == "FM1"):
    attachFlashModule()
  else if (moduleID == "DM1"):
    attachDisplayModule()
  else if (moduleID == "BM1"):
    attachBatteryModule()
  else:
    displayError("Unknown Module ID")

function attachModule(moduleID, moduleType):
  // Establish magnetic connection
  if (magneticConnectionSuccessful()):
    //Initialize module based on moduleType
    //Establish data link between module and CM
    //Update UI to reflect connected module
```

**Innovation Notes:** This system decouples the functionality of a camera from its physical form. Users can build a camera tailored to their specific needs, swapping modules to create a compact travel camera, a professional video rig, or anything in between. The magnetic attachment simplifies setup and allows for rapid reconfiguration. The modular approach also facilitates upgrades and repairs – individual modules can be replaced without replacing the entire camera.
