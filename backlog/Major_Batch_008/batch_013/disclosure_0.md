## Dynamic Interconnect Partition Orchestration via Intent-Based Networking

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust interconnect partition bandwidth allocations based on real-time application performance *intent*, not just static thresholds. This goes beyond simple bandwidth limiting; it aims to *optimize* resource delivery based on declared application needs.

**Components:**

*   **Intent Engine:**  A software module receiving application performance intent.  Intent is expressed as Service Level Objectives (SLOs) – e.g., “Database X requires 99.99% availability and <10ms latency for read operations.”  The engine translates these SLOs into dynamic bandwidth allocation profiles.  This could leverage machine learning to *predict* bandwidth needs based on historical data and application behavior.
*   **Telemetry Collection:** Continuous gathering of performance data from customer applications *and* provider network resources. Key metrics include latency, throughput, error rates, CPU/memory utilization (on both customer and provider sides). This utilizes existing monitoring infrastructure (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) but with integration into the Intent Engine.
*   **Bandwidth Allocation Manager (BAM):** A central controller responsible for dynamically adjusting partition bandwidth based on input from the Intent Engine and the Telemetry Collection.  BAM interacts directly with the provider network's routing and switching infrastructure.
*   **Programmable Network Infrastructure:**  Provider network must support Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles. This allows BAM to programmatically adjust bandwidth allocations on the fly – creating or shrinking partitions, shifting bandwidth between partitions, etc.  Utilize technologies like P4-programmable switches and OpenFlow.
*   **API Gateway:** Provides a secure and standardized interface for customers/connectivity intermediaries to define application intent and monitor performance.

**Pseudocode (BAM core logic):**

```
function adjust_bandwidth(app_intent, telemetry_data):
  // app_intent: Dictionary containing application performance requirements
  // telemetry_data: Dictionary containing real-time performance metrics

  predicted_bandwidth = calculate_predicted_bandwidth(app_intent, telemetry_data)

  current_bandwidth = get_current_bandwidth()

  bandwidth_delta = predicted_bandwidth - current_bandwidth

  if bandwidth_delta > 0:
    // Attempt to allocate additional bandwidth
    allocate_bandwidth(bandwidth_delta)
  elif bandwidth_delta < 0:
    //Reduce existing bandwidth
    deallocate_bandwidth(abs(bandwidth_delta))

  log_adjustment(app_intent, telemetry_data, bandwidth_delta)

function calculate_predicted_bandwidth(app_intent, telemetry_data):
  // Implementation details using ML model (trained on historical data)
  // Model input: App intent (SLO, priority, type), telemetry data (latency, throughput)
  // Model output: Predicted bandwidth requirement
  return predicted_bandwidth

function allocate_bandwidth(bandwidth_delta):
  // Check if sufficient bandwidth is available
  if has_sufficient_bandwidth(bandwidth_delta):
    // Programmatically adjust network configuration (e.g., using OpenFlow)
    program_network(bandwidth_delta)
    return true
  else:
    // Implement congestion management (e.g., queue prioritization, traffic shaping)
    apply_congestion_management()
    return false

function deallocate_bandwidth(bandwidth_delta):
  //Programmatically adjust network configuration
  program_network(-bandwidth_delta)
```

**Novelty:**  Traditional interconnect partitioning focuses on static bandwidth allocation and enforcement. This system is proactive; it uses application intent and real-time telemetry to dynamically *optimize* bandwidth allocation, improving application performance and resource utilization.  It shifts from a “police” function (enforcing limits) to a “concierge” function (proactively delivering resources based on stated needs). The ML component allows for predictive scaling, anticipating needs before they arise.
