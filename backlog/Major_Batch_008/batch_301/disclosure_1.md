## Dynamic DNS-Based Reputation Scoring & Adaptive Routing

**Concept:** Expand upon the location-based routing by incorporating a real-time reputation scoring system for client IP addresses, influencing routing decisions *beyond* just geographic location. This system adapts to evolving network conditions and potential malicious activity, prioritizing routes through 'healthy' network segments.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Reputation Data Store:** A distributed database storing reputation scores for IP addresses/network ranges. Scores are initialized to a neutral value.
2.  **Real-time Monitoring Agents:** Deployed at various network points of presence (POPs). These agents collect data:
    *   **Request Success Rate:** Percentage of successful responses to DNS queries originating from the monitored IP.
    *   **Latency Variations:**  Standard deviation of response times to the same query from the same IP. High variation indicates potential network instability.
    *   **DNS Query Patterns:** Monitoring for unusual query volumes or patterns indicative of DDoS attacks or reconnaissance. (e.g., rapid querying of multiple subdomains)
    *   **Blacklist Checks:** Periodic checks against known malicious IP blacklists.
3.  **Scoring Algorithm:** A weighted scoring function combining data from the monitoring agents. Weights are configurable to prioritize specific metrics.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_reputation_score(ip_address):
        success_rate = get_success_rate(ip_address)
        latency_variation = get_latency_variation(ip_address)
        blacklist_status = check_blacklist(ip_address)
        query_pattern_score = analyze_query_patterns(ip_address)

        score = (0.4 * success_rate) + (0.3 * (1 - normalize(latency_variation))) + (0.1 * (1 - blacklist_status)) + (0.2 * query_pattern_score)

        return score
    ```

    *   `normalize()` scales latency variation to a 0-1 range.
    *   `blacklist_status` returns 1 if on a blacklist, 0 otherwise.
    *   Weights can be adjusted via configuration.
4.  **Adaptive Routing Logic:**  Modification of the DNS resolution process:

    *   Upon receiving a DNS query, the system obtains the client IP address.
    *   Calculate the reputation score for the IP address.
    *   The routing data store now includes a 'reputation factor' associated with each location-based identifier.
    *   The DNS resolution algorithm prioritizes routes with higher reputation scores *within* the client's location-based identifier. This might mean directing traffic to a POP with a slightly higher latency but a significantly better reputation.
5.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:**  An AI component that dynamically adjusts the weights in the scoring algorithm based on overall network performance and emerging threats. This ensures the reputation system remains effective in the face of evolving conditions.
6.  **Feedback Loop:**  Performance data from content delivery is fed back into the reputation system. If a route consistently delivers poor performance *despite* a high reputation score, the score is adjusted downwards.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The reputation data store should be distributed and highly available.
*   Monitoring agents should be deployed strategically throughout the network infrastructure.
*   The scoring algorithm should be configurable to allow for experimentation and optimization.
*   Consider using machine learning techniques to identify patterns of malicious activity.
