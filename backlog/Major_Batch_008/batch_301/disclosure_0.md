## Adaptive Compression Granularity & Tiering

**Concept:** Expand on the tiering concept within the provided patent by introducing *dynamic* compression granularity – applying different compression levels to *parts* of an object, rather than the entire object. Combine this with a predictive tiering system that anticipates access patterns at a *granular* level (e.g., specific data blocks within an object).

**Specification:**

**1. Data Block Identification & Profiling:**

*   **Objective:** Divide each object into fixed-size data blocks (e.g., 64KB, configurable). Analyze each block's characteristics – file type, access frequency, modification time, inherent compressibility (using quick statistical analysis).
*   **Implementation:** A background process continuously monitors data block access.  Data is stored in a metadata layer alongside the object data.
*   **Metadata Structure:**
    *   `block_id`: Unique identifier for the data block.
    *   `file_type`:  MIME type or custom classification.
    *   `access_count`: Number of accesses in a rolling window (e.g., 7 days).
    *   `last_accessed`: Timestamp of last access.
    *   `compressibility_score`:  Score (0-100) indicating how well the block is likely to compress.  Calculated using entropy estimation or similar algorithms.
    *    `current_tier`: The current storage tier.

**2. Dynamic Compression Algorithm Selection:**

*   **Objective:**  Choose the optimal compression algorithm *per data block*, based on the `compressibility_score` and the predicted access frequency.
*   **Algorithm Map:**  A configurable map defines the algorithm to use for given score/frequency ranges. Example:
    *   High Compressibility, Low Frequency:  Zstandard (high compression, moderate speed)
    *   Moderate Compressibility, Moderate Frequency:  LZ4 (fast compression/decompression)
    *   Low Compressibility, High Frequency:  No Compression (minimize latency).
*    **Pseudocode:**

```
function select_compression_algorithm(block_metadata):
    score = block_metadata.compressibility_score
    frequency = calculate_access_frequency(block_metadata)

    if score > 80 and frequency < 1:
        return "Zstandard"
    elif score > 50 and frequency < 5:
        return "LZ4"
    else:
        return "None"
```

**3. Predictive Tiering & Data Movement:**

*   **Objective:** Predict future access patterns at the data block level. Automatically move blocks to appropriate storage tiers based on these predictions.
*   **Prediction Model:** A time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) trained on historical access data for each block. This model predicts the number of accesses to the block over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 7 days).
*   **Tier Definitions:**
    *   Tier 0:  High-Performance SSD (frequent access, low latency)
    *   Tier 1:  NVMe SSD (moderate access, balanced performance)
    *   Tier 2:  High-Capacity HDD (infrequent access, cost-optimized)
    *   Tier 3:  Object Storage (archival, lowest cost)
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
function determine_target_tier(block_metadata, prediction_model):
    predicted_accesses = prediction_model.predict(block_metadata)

    if predicted_accesses > 100:
        return "Tier 0"
    elif predicted_accesses > 20:
        return "Tier 1"
    elif predicted_accesses > 5:
        return "Tier 2"
    else:
        return "Tier 3"
```

**4. Implementation Considerations:**

*   **Background Processes:** The data block analysis, prediction model training, and data movement operations should be performed by asynchronous background processes to minimize impact on application performance.
*   **Metadata Management:**  Efficient metadata storage and retrieval are crucial.  Consider using a dedicated metadata database or a key-value store.
*   **Data Consistency:**  Ensure data consistency during data movement operations. Use techniques such as checksum validation and atomic operations.
*   **Configuration:** Provide a flexible configuration interface to allow administrators to customize the tier definitions, compression algorithms, and prediction model parameters.
