## Adaptive Insight Granularity & Multi-Dimensional Causality Graphs

**Concept:** Expand the causality graph concept to incorporate varying levels of insight granularity *and* represent causality across multiple, non-traditional dimensions (e.g., user behavior, business impact, infrastructure cost). The existing patent focuses on technical anomalies. This expands to include business and user-facing anomalies, and moves beyond simple time-based causality.

**Specifications:**

**1. Insight Granularity Levels:**

*   **Level 0: Raw Signal:**  Unprocessed data points (e.g., CPU utilization, error logs, clickstream data).
*   **Level 1: Anomaly Detection:** Results of anomaly detection algorithms.  Flagged events.
*   **Level 2:  Correlated Events:**  Events grouped based on temporal proximity and pre-defined correlations (e.g., high CPU + increased database latency).
*   **Level 3:  Inferred Root Cause:** Hypothesized root cause based on causality graph traversal and statistical analysis.
*   **Level 4: Business Impact:** Quantified impact of the anomaly on key business metrics (revenue, user engagement, etc.).
*   **Level 5: Recommended Action & Predicted Outcome:** Automated or human-validated recommendation to resolve the issue, with a predicted outcome based on historical data.

**2. Multi-Dimensional Causality Graph:**

*   **Nodes:** Represent entities at any of the above granularity levels.  Node properties include:
    *   Entity Type (CPU, Database, User Segment, Revenue Metric, etc.)
    *   Granularity Level (0-5)
    *   Timestamp
    *   Severity
    *   Relevant Data (e.g., CPU utilization value, error message, revenue loss amount)
*   **Edges:** Represent causal relationships. Edge properties include:
    *   Causality Type (Direct, Indirect, Correlation, Contributing Factor)
    *   Strength (Confidence score based on statistical analysis and historical data)
    *   Time Delay (Measured time difference between the cause and effect)
    *   Dimensionality (Which dimension the causality applies to – e.g., technical, business, user experience)

**3. Adaptive Granularity Engine:**

*   **Input:** Stream of events/metrics from various sources.
*   **Process:**
    *   Events are initially ingested at Level 0.
    *   Anomaly detection algorithms process Level 0 data, generating Level 1 events.
    *   The system dynamically traverses the causality graph.
    *   Based on user queries or automated triggers, the system can ‘zoom in’ to lower granularity levels (e.g., from Level 3 to Level 1 to view raw data) or ‘zoom out’ to higher levels (e.g., from Level 1 to Level 5 to see business impact).
    *   A reinforcement learning model optimizes the graph traversal strategy based on user feedback and outcome data.
*   **Output:** Contextualized insight presented through a graphical user interface.

**4. Pseudocode for Graph Traversal & Insight Generation:**

```
function generateInsight(query, startNode):
  insight = []
  visited = set()
  queue = [startNode]

  while queue is not empty:
    node = queue.pop(0)
    if node in visited:
      continue
    visited.add(node)

    insight.append(node)

    # Explore neighboring nodes
    for edge in node.outgoingEdges:
      neighbor = edge.targetNode
      if edge.causalityType == "Direct" and edge.strength > threshold:
          queue.append(neighbor)

    # Filter insights based on query
    filteredInsights = filter(insight, lambda x: matchesQuery(x, query))

    # Rank insights based on strength, severity, and business impact
    rankedInsights = sort(rankedInsights, lambda x: calculateScore(x))

    return rankedInsights
```

**5.  UI Considerations:**

*   Interactive graph visualization.
*   Ability to dynamically adjust granularity level.
*   Filtering and sorting options.
*   Business impact metrics displayed prominently.
*   Automated recommendation engine.
*   User feedback mechanism.
