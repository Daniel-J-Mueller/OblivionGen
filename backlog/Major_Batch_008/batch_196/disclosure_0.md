## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Communication Shielding

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple fraud/inappropriateness detection to build a dynamic trust score for each user, then utilize that score to actively *shape* communication, not just block it. This moves beyond reactive filtering to proactive guidance.

**Specs:**

**1. User Trust Engine (UTE):**

*   **Input Variables:**
    *   Transaction History (volume, value, dispute rate)
    *   Communication Patterns (message length, keyword density, sentiment analysis - see section 2)
    *   Account Age & Verification Level (KYC data, linked accounts)
    *   Network Analysis (connections to known bad actors - graph database)
    *   Real-time Behavioral Biometrics (typing speed, mouse movements – optional, requires user consent)
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** Weighted sum of input variables. Weights dynamically adjusted based on machine learning model trained on historical data.  Model retrained weekly.
*   **Output:**  Trust Score (0-100). Categorized into Trust Levels: Low, Medium, High, Verified.

**2. Communication Guidance Module (CGM):**

*   **Input:** Message content, Sender Trust Level, Recipient Trust Level.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   **Low-to-Low:**  Message automatically flagged for review by a human moderator *before* delivery. Sender & Recipient both receive a notification: “This communication is under review for security purposes.”
    *   **Low-to-Medium/High:**  Message automatically *rewritten* by an AI to remove potentially risky language (e.g., requests for off-platform payments, personal information). Rewritten message displayed to the recipient with a disclaimer: “This message has been automatically edited for clarity and security.”  Original message logged.
    *   **Medium/High-to-Low:** Message displayed to the recipient with a warning banner: “This sender has a limited transaction history. Exercise caution.”
    *   **High-to-High/Verified:**  Communication proceeds normally.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis Integration**: CGM integrates with sentiment analysis to identify potentially aggressive or threatening language, even if it doesn't trigger traditional fraud flags.  This information feeds into the Trust Score.
*   **AI Rewriting Protocol**:  The AI rewriting engine uses a combination of paraphrasing, word substitution, and sentence restructuring to achieve the desired result.  Priority is given to preserving the original intent of the message.  A “confidence score” is associated with each rewrite, indicating the degree of certainty that the meaning has been preserved.
*   **User Feedback Loop**: Users can report edited messages as inaccurate or misleading. This feedback is used to improve the AI rewriting engine.

**3.  Real-time Risk Adjustment:**

*   **Dynamic Thresholds:**  Fraudulence/inappropriateness thresholds are adjusted in real-time based on overall platform activity.  If a surge in fraudulent activity is detected, thresholds are temporarily raised.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The Trust Engine continuously learns from new data and adjusts weights accordingly.

**Pseudocode (CGM):**

```
function processMessage(message, senderTrustLevel, recipientTrustLevel) {
  if (senderTrustLevel == "Low" && recipientTrustLevel == "Low") {
    flagForModeration(message);
    notify(sender, "Message under review");
    notify(recipient, "Message under review");
  } else if (senderTrustLevel == "Low") {
    rewrittenMessage = rewriteMessage(message); // AI rewriting
    if (rewrittenMessage.confidence > 0.8) {
      deliverMessage(rewrittenMessage, recipient);
      notify(recipient, "Message has been automatically edited");
    } else {
      // Handle low-confidence rewrite (e.g., flag for moderation)
    }
  } else if (recipientTrustLevel == "Low") {
    deliverMessage(message, recipient);
    displayWarning(recipient, "This sender has limited history");
  } else {
    deliverMessage(message, recipient);
  }
}

function rewriteMessage(message) {
  // AI-powered rewriting logic here
  //  - Paraphrasing
  //  - Keyword replacement
  //  - Sentiment adjustment
  return {
    content: rewrittenContent,
    confidence: confidenceScore
  };
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond simply blocking or flagging content to *actively shaping* communication based on trust levels. It's a more nuanced and proactive approach to security that aims to guide users towards safer interactions, rather than simply shutting them down.  The integration of dynamic thresholds and adaptive learning ensures that the system remains effective over time.
