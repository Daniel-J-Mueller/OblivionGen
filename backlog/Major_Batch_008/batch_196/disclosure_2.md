## Adaptive Key Sharding with Entropy-Based Distribution

**Concept:** Expand upon the distributed key management by introducing *key sharding* coupled with an *entropy-based distribution* mechanism. Instead of distributing full keys, keys are split into multiple shares.  The distribution of these shares isnâ€™t uniform; it's weighted by the observed entropy (randomness/unpredictability) of the data the key will encrypt/decrypt. Higher entropy data receives a wider, more geographically dispersed share distribution to enhance security and resilience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Shard Generation:**

*   **Input:** A master key (generated traditionally) and a data entropy metric (described in section 3).
*   **Process:** Employ a Shamir Secret Sharing (SSS) or similar algorithm to split the master key into *n* shares. The value of *n* is dynamically determined based on the desired security level and network topology.
*   **Output:** *n* key shares.  Each share is independently encrypted using a unique, randomly generated symmetric key.

**2. Entropy-Aware Distribution:**

*   **Nodes:**  The distributed system consists of numerous nodes, each with a geographic location and a trust score.
*   **Data Analysis:** Before encryption, data is analyzed to determine its entropy (using statistical methods like Shannon entropy or similar).
*   **Share Assignment:**  Assign key shares to nodes based on:
    *   **Entropy Weight:** Data with higher entropy receives a greater weight in the share distribution.  This means more shares are assigned to geographically dispersed, high-trust nodes.
    *   **Node Trust:**  Nodes with higher trust scores are prioritized for share assignment.
    *   **Geographic Dispersion:** Algorithmically maximize the geographic distance between nodes holding shares of the same key.  Avoid clustering shares in a single region.
*   **Distribution Mechanism:**
    *   Utilize a distributed hash table (DHT) or gossip protocol to facilitate share distribution.
    *   Implement a redundancy mechanism: create *k* redundant shares (k > n) to ensure key reconstruction even if some shares are lost or compromised.

**3. Entropy Calculation & Metric:**

*   **Method:** Implement a rolling entropy calculation based on data streams. Calculate entropy for each data block as it's produced.
*   **Metric:** Entropy is represented as a numerical value (e.g., bits per byte). Scale this value to represent a risk level (low, medium, high).
*   **Implementation:**
    *   Utilize a sliding window to calculate entropy over a recent data history.
    *   Normalize entropy values to a standard range for consistent risk assessment.

**4. Key Reconstruction:**

*   **Process:** To reconstruct the master key, a minimum threshold of *t* shares (t <= n) must be gathered.
*   **Protocol:** Implement a secure multi-party computation (MPC) protocol to reconstruct the key without revealing individual shares.
*   **Error Handling:** Incorporate mechanisms to handle lost or compromised shares, utilizing redundant shares and/or key re-encryption techniques.

**5. System Architecture Integration:**

*   **Key Management Service (KMS):** Integrate the entropy-aware key sharding system into the existing KMS.
*   **API Extension:** Extend the KMS API to allow applications to specify data entropy levels or request keys based on entropy requirements.
*   **Monitoring & Auditing:** Implement comprehensive monitoring and auditing capabilities to track key share distribution, reconstruction attempts, and system performance.

**Pseudocode (Key Share Assignment):**

```
function assignKeyShares(masterKey, dataEntropy, nodeList):
  shares = splitKey(masterKey, numShares)
  weightedNodeList = []
  for node in nodeList:
    weight = node.trustScore * (1 + dataEntropyWeight * dataEntropy)  //Entropy influences weight
    weightedNodeList.append((node, weight))

  sortedNodeList = sort(weightedNodeList, descending=True) //Sort by weight

  for i in range(numShares):
    node = sortedNodeList[i % len(sortedNodeList)] // Distribute based on weight
    encryptShare(shares[i], node.encryptionKey) //Encrypt with node's key
    sendShare(shares[i], node)

  return // Shares distributed
```

This system enhances security by increasing the complexity of key compromise and improves resilience against network outages or targeted attacks.  The entropy-based distribution ensures that the most sensitive data receives the highest level of protection.
