## Dynamic Content "Lifespans" & Ephemeral Access

**Concept:** Extend the secure content delivery system to incorporate content "lifespans" – a limited time window during which the content is accessible *after* initial decryption – and tie access to dynamic, cryptographically-secured "proofs of presence". This goes beyond simple time-based access controls and introduces a layer of verifiable, real-time engagement.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Content Lifespan Metadata:**  Augment content storage with a "lifespan" parameter (in seconds/minutes/hours) after successful decryption. After this period, the decrypted content is automatically and irreversibly purged from the receiver's device *and* from any temporary storage on our servers.  The content remains encrypted on the server indefinitely.

2.  **"Proof of Presence" Tokens:**  Upon successful decryption and initial content playback, the receiver device generates a "Proof of Presence" token. This token is a digitally signed attestation that the content is *currently* being engaged with.  The signature utilizes a time-sensitive cryptographic key unique to the receiver device and the content item.

3.  **Periodic Token Refresh:**  The receiver device must periodically (e.g., every 30-60 seconds) refresh the "Proof of Presence" token and transmit it to our servers. Failure to refresh the token within a defined timeout (e.g., 15-30 seconds) triggers content access revocation.

4.  **Revocation Mechanism:**  Our servers continuously verify the validity of "Proof of Presence" tokens. Invalid or expired tokens trigger a revocation signal that instructs the receiver device to cease playback and purge the decrypted content.

5.  **Asynchronous Purge Confirmation:**  Following revocation, the receiver device initiates an asynchronous purge process and sends a confirmation signal to our servers. This confirmation is logged for auditing and ensures content deletion.

6. **Dynamic Key Derivation:** The initial decryption key derivation process (as outlined in the patent) is enhanced by factoring in a receiver-specific "engagement score". This score is calculated based on historical content usage patterns, device trust level, and other relevant factors.  A higher engagement score yields a longer initial access window.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side – Token Verification):**

```
function verifyToken(tokenId, contentId):
  tokenData = retrieveTokenData(tokenId)
  if tokenData is null:
    return false

  if tokenData.contentId != contentId:
    return false

  if tokenData.expiryTimestamp < currentTime:
    return false

  if tokenData.signature is invalid:
    return false

  return true
```

**Pseudocode (Receiver-Side – Token Refresh):**

```
function refreshProofOfPresence(contentId):
  currentTime = getCurrentTime()
  expiryTimestamp = currentTime + 60  // 60 second validity
  signature = generateSignature(contentId, expiryTimestamp, deviceKey)
  tokenData = {
    contentId: contentId,
    expiryTimestamp: expiryTimestamp,
    signature: signature
  }
  sendTokenToServer(tokenData)
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Ephemeral Streaming:**  Ideal for live events or time-sensitive content where access should expire immediately after viewing.
*   **Anti-Piracy:**  Significantly reduces the window of opportunity for content capture and redistribution.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:** Allows content creators to dynamically adjust access based on user engagement or other factors.
*   **Secure Collaboration:** Ensures confidential documents are only accessible while actively being reviewed.
