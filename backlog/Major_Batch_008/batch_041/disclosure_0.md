## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Classification via Bioacoustic Feature Fusion

**System Overview:** A wearable system incorporating bone conduction and air conduction microphones coupled with real-time bioacoustic feature extraction and machine learning classification. The goal is to classify the acoustic environment *and* the user's physiological state (stress, focus, etc.) to dynamically adjust audio processing parameters – not just for clearer communication, but for optimized cognitive performance and wellbeing.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Dual microphone setup – bone conduction (BC) and air conduction (AC) – positioned for optimal signal capture (BC near the mastoid process, AC near the ear canal opening).
*   **Analog Front End (AFE):** Low-noise amplifiers and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) with high dynamic range, capable of simultaneously digitizing signals from both microphones.
*   **Processing Unit:** Low-power, high-performance System-on-Chip (SoC) with dedicated neural processing unit (NPU).
*   **Memory:** Sufficient RAM for real-time signal processing and model execution. Flash memory for storing trained models and system software.
*   **Wireless Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) for data transmission to a companion device (smartphone, computer).
*   **Physiological Sensors (Optional):** Heart rate sensor, galvanic skin response (GSR) sensor, and/or EEG sensors for multi-modal data fusion.

**Software & Algorithm Specifications:**

1.  **Signal Acquisition & Preprocessing:**
    *   Simultaneous capture of BC and AC signals.
    *   Noise reduction filtering (adaptive filtering based on ambient noise estimation).
    *   Signal normalization and framing (e.g., 20ms frames with 10ms overlap).

2.  **Feature Extraction:**
    *   **BC Signal Features:** Extract features indicative of vocal cord vibration and internal physiological state.
        *   Fundamental frequency (F0) estimation.
        *   Formant analysis (characterizing vowel sounds).
        *   Glottal source parameters (reflecting vocal fold vibration).
        *   Micro-tremor analysis (detecting subtle muscle vibrations).
    *   **AC Signal Features:** Extract features representing the external acoustic environment.
        *   Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) – for sound classification.
        *   Spectral centroid, bandwidth, and roll-off.
        *   Sound event detection (e.g., speech, music, traffic).
    *   **Bioacoustic Feature Fusion:**  Combine BC and AC features using a weighted averaging or concatenation approach. The weighting factors can be adaptively adjusted based on signal quality and context.

3.  **Machine Learning Classification:**
    *   **Model Architecture:** A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to classify acoustic scenes and user states.
    *   **Training Data:** A large, labeled dataset of acoustic scenes (office, home, street, etc.) and user states (focused, stressed, relaxed, etc.). Data augmentation techniques to improve model robustness.
    *   **Classification Output:** A probability distribution over different acoustic scenes and user states.

4.  **Adaptive Audio Processing:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Adjustment:** Dynamically adjust audio processing parameters (noise cancellation, equalization, voice enhancement) based on the classified acoustic scene.
    *   **User State Adjustment:** Adapt audio processing parameters to optimize cognitive performance and wellbeing based on the classified user state.
        *   *Focus Mode:* Enhance speech clarity and reduce distracting noises.
        *   *Relaxation Mode:* Play calming ambient sounds and reduce harsh frequencies.
        *   *Stress Reduction Mode:*  Deliver binaural beats or other calming audio stimuli.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm):**

```
// Initialize System
Load Trained ML Model

// Real-Time Processing Loop
While (true) {
    // Acquire Signals
    BC_Signal = AcquireBoneConductionSignal()
    AC_Signal = AcquireAirConductionSignal()

    // Feature Extraction
    BC_Features = ExtractBoneConductionFeatures(BC_Signal)
    AC_Features = ExtractAirConductionFeatures(AC_Signal)

    // Fuse Features
    Fused_Features = FuseBoneAndAirConductionFeatures(BC_Features, AC_Features)

    // Classification
    Scene_Probabilities, State_Probabilities = Classify(Fused_Features)

    // Determine Acoustic Scene and User State
    Acoustic_Scene = Argmax(Scene_Probabilities)
    User_State = Argmax(State_Probabilities)

    // Adaptive Audio Processing
    AdjustAudioProcessingParameters(Acoustic_Scene, User_State)

    // Output Processed Audio
    OutputAudio()
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Integration with other wearable sensors (e.g., EEG, heart rate) for more comprehensive physiological monitoring.
*   Personalized model training based on individual user data.
*   Real-time adaptation of audio processing parameters based on changing environmental conditions.
*   Development of a biofeedback system to help users manage stress and improve focus.
