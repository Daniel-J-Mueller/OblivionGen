## Dynamic Haptic Texture Layer

**Concept:** Integrate a microfluidic layer *beneath* the crosspoint array to create dynamically changing haptic textures on the device's surface. This would go *beyond* simple touch sensing to provide tactile feedback simulating various materials and shapes.

**Specs:**

*   **Layer Stack (From Device Back to Display Surface):** Battery (with integrated 2nd Crosspoint Layer as per patent), Microfluidic Layer, Crosspoint Array (1st Layer), Display Element, Protective Sheet.
*   **Microfluidic Layer:** Composed of an array of micro-chambers filled with a non-conductive, magnetorheological fluid. Chamber dimensions: 0.5mm x 0.5mm x 0.1mm. Chamber density: 500 PPI (pixels per inch).
*   **Actuation:** Each micro-chamber contains a micro-electromagnet controlled by a dedicated driver circuit. Varying the current to the electromagnet changes the viscosity of the magnetorheological fluid, causing the chamber to stiffen or relax.
*   **Crosspoint Array Integration:** The 1st Crosspoint Array (embedded in the display) serves *dual* purpose. It continues to handle touch input *and* provides positional data for the haptic feedback system. The processor maps touch coordinates to specific micro-chambers.
*   **Control Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateHapticTexture(textureMap, touchCoordinates)
  // textureMap:  2D array defining desired haptic texture (stiffness values)
  // touchCoordinates:  (x, y) coordinates of touch input

  FOR each pixel in textureMap
    //Determine stiffness value at pixel location

    // Map stiffness value to current level for corresponding micro-chamber
    currentLevel = MapStiffnessToCurrent(stiffnessValue)

    //Send current level to corresponding micro-chamber driver
    SendCurrentToDriver(pixelX, pixelY, currentLevel)

  ENDFOR

  //Apply force compensation based on touch position and applied pressure

  //Apply ripple effect outwards from touch point
ENDFUNCTION
```

*   **Materials:**
