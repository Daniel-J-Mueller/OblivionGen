## Federated Role-Based Access with Ephemeral Credentials & Dynamic Policy Enforcement

**Concept:** Expand upon the cross-region access concept by introducing a system where roles aren’t pre-defined but *dynamically* constructed based on temporary attributes and contextual data at the time of access request.  Instead of a static role identifier, a “contextual profile” is generated. This profile isn’t stored, but derived on demand, influencing policy evaluation.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Profile Generation Service (CPGS):**

*   **Input:**
    *   User Account ID (from requesting region)
    *   Requesting Device Attributes (OS, location, security posture)
    *   Resource Attributes (data sensitivity, owner, compliance requirements)
    *   Time-of-Day/Date
    *   Optional: User-provided attributes (e.g., “project code”, “department”)
*   **Process:** CPGS applies a rule engine (e.g., a decision tree or a machine learning model) to these inputs, generating a “Contextual Profile” represented as a set of key-value pairs. Example:  `{“sensitivity_level”: “high”, “location”: “corporate_network”, “project”: “alpha”, “device_security”: “compliant”}`.  This profile is *not* persisted.
*   **Output:** Encrypted Contextual Profile (using a temporary key shared between requesting region and first region)

**2. Session Credential Generation (SCG):**

*   **Input:**
    *   User Account ID
    *   Digitally Signed Request
    *   Encrypted Contextual Profile
*   **Process:**
    *   Validates request.
    *   Decrypts Contextual Profile.
    *   Combines User Account ID and Contextual Profile to form a unique "Access Context."
    *   Generates Session Key Pair (SKp, SKs).
    *   Encrypts SKs with Session Encryption Key (SEK) maintained by security service.
    *   Constructs Session Token: {SKs_Enc, AccessContext_Hash}.  The hash ensures AccessContext isn’t tampered with.
*   **Output:** Session Token.

**3. Resource Access Gateway (RAG):**

*   **Input:**  Second Request (including Session Token), Resource Identifier
*   **Process:**
    *   Extracts SKs_Enc from Session Token.
    *   Decrypts SKs using SEK.
    *   Calculates the hash of the AccessContext from the received Session Token.
    *   Reconstructs the AccessContext using the User Account ID and the Session Token.
    *   **Dynamic Policy Evaluation:** Instead of referencing static roles, the RAG evaluates access policies *based on the reconstructed AccessContext*.  Policies are defined as rules that evaluate the AccessContext attributes (e.g., “ALLOW access IF sensitivity_level = ‘low’ AND location = ‘corporate_network’”).  Policy engine is pluggable (e.g., Open Policy Agent - OPA).
    *   Validates signature on the request using SKs.
    *   Grants/Denies access.

**Pseudocode (RAG – Dynamic Policy Evaluation):**

```
function evaluatePolicy(AccessContext, PolicyRules) {
  for each rule in PolicyRules {
    if (rule.condition(AccessContext)) {
      return rule.action; // Allow/Deny
    }
  }
  return "Deny"; // Default deny
}

// Example Policy Rule
rule = {
  condition: function(AccessContext) {
    return AccessContext.sensitivity_level == "low" && AccessContext.location == "corporate_network";
  },
  action: "Allow"
}
```

**4. Key Rotation & Ephemeral Nature:**

*   Session Keys and Contextual Profiles are short-lived (e.g., 5-15 minutes).
*   SEK is regularly rotated.
*   No persistent storage of Contextual Profiles.  This minimizes the attack surface.



This approach offers much finer-grained access control than traditional role-based systems, adapting to the *current* context of the access request. It’s well-suited for dynamic environments and enhances security by reducing reliance on pre-defined roles.
