## Adaptive Data Zoning with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand the locality-based durability concept to *proactively* zone data based on predicted access patterns, and prefetch data to slave nodes *before* a master failure, dramatically reducing failover latency. This moves beyond reactive quorum consensus to a predictive, optimized system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Application access logs (read/write frequency, data type, user/service ID), historical master node failure data, network latency metrics between data centers.
*   **Algorithm:** Time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) combined with a Markov chain model.  The Markov chain predicts the probability of accessing a specific data item after accessing another.  This creates a “heat map” of data access probabilities.
*   **Output:** A dynamically updated data zoning map.  Each data item is assigned to a 'zone', representing the optimal set of data centers for replication based on predicted access.  Zone assignment is not static; it adjusts over time.

**2. Data Zoning Manager:**

*   **Function:** Responsible for re-replicating data according to the zoning map generated by the Prediction Engine.
*   **Process:**  Initiates asynchronous data replication tasks to move data items to their assigned zones.  Prioritizes replication based on predicted access frequency; frequently accessed items are moved first.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Employs a versioning system (e.g., vector clocks) to handle concurrent writes and ensure data consistency during replication.

**3. Predictive Prefetching:**

*   **Trigger:** When the Prediction Engine identifies a high probability of a master node failure *or* a significant increase in access to a specific data item, prefetching is initiated.
*   **Process:** Data items predicted to be heavily accessed after a failover are proactively replicated to slave nodes in the optimal zones *before* the failure occurs.
*   **Caching:** Slave nodes maintain a cache of prefetched data.

**4. Failover Protocol Adaptation:**

*   **Detection:** Existing failure detection mechanisms are used.
*   **Election:**  The election process remains similar, but the new master prioritizes data already prefetched on slave nodes.
*   **Recovery:** Recovery focuses on verifying the consistency of prefetched data rather than replicating it from the old master.

**Pseudocode (Data Zoning Manager):**

```
function update_data_zones(prediction_map):
  for data_item, zone_preferences in prediction_map:
    current_zone = get_current_zone(data_item)
    if current_zone != zone_preferences:
      // Initiate asynchronous data replication to new zones
      start_replication(data_item, zone_preferences)
      update_current_zone(data_item, zone_preferences)

function start_replication(data_item, target_zones):
  for zone in target_zones:
    // Asynchronously replicate data_item to the specified zone
    // Use versioning to ensure consistency
    replicate_data(data_item, zone)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Prediction Map`:  {`data_item_id`: [`zone_id1`, `zone_id2`, ...], ...} – A map indicating the preferred zones for each data item.
*   `Data Zoning Table`: {`data_item_id`: `current_zone_id`, ...} - A table storing the current zone assignment for each data item.
