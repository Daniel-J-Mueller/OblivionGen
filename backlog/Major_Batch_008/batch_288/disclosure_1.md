## Optical Fiber Event Prediction & Preemptive Mitigation System

**Core Concept:** Instead of *reacting* to fiber events with logical cuts or switching, this system aims to *predict* events based on subtle signal degradation and proactively mitigate them *before* a complete failure occurs, minimizing disruption.

**System Specs:**

*   **Distributed Strain Sensing:** Integrate distributed fiber optic strain sensing (DFOSS) along the critical fiber optic paths. DFOSS utilizes Rayleigh backscattering to measure strain and temperature changes along the entire fiber length with high precision.
*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** Develop an AI model trained on historical DFOSS data, power level fluctuations, and environmental factors (temperature, humidity, seismic activity). This model will learn to identify subtle anomalies that *precede* fiber events (e.g., gradual increase in strain, minor power dips).
*   **Preemptive Wavelength Shifting:**  Upon detection of a high-probability event, the system will *smoothly shift* the transmitted wavelength to a less stressed portion of the fiber spectrum *before* the signal is completely degraded. This is achieved via tunable optical components.
*   **Dynamic Power Allocation:**  Simultaneously with wavelength shifting, dynamically allocate more power to the shifted wavelength to maintain signal integrity. This must be done within safe operating limits of the optical components.
*   **Redundant Path Pre-conditioning:** While performing wavelength/power adjustments on the primary path, the system begins *pre-conditioning* the redundant fiber path. This involves activating the redundant path's optical amplifiers and ensuring signal alignment. This reduces switchover time.
*   **Hybrid Switching Strategy:** Implement a hybrid switching strategy.  For minor, predicted events, a seamless wavelength/power adjustment is sufficient. For severe, unavoidable events, a fast, fully redundant path switchover occurs.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Continuous monitoring of the adjusted/switched path provides feedback to refine the AI modelâ€™s prediction accuracy and mitigation strategies.

**Pseudocode (AI Prediction & Mitigation Loop):**

```
loop:
    DFOSS_Data = Read_DFOSS_Data()
    Power_Level = Read_Power_Level()
    Environmental_Data = Read_Environmental_Data()

    Anomaly_Score = AI_Model.Predict(DFOSS_Data, Power_Level, Environmental_Data)

    if Anomaly_Score > Threshold:
        Event_Probability = Calculate_Event_Probability(Anomaly_Score)

        if Event_Probability > Critical_Threshold:
            #Preemptive Mitigation
            Tune_Wavelength(New_Wavelength)
            Increase_Power(New_Power_Level)
            Precondition_Redundant_Path()

        else:
            # Monitor Closely
            Log_Anomaly(Anomaly_Score)

    else:
        # Normal Operation
        Continue Monitoring

    Sleep(Monitoring_Interval)
```
