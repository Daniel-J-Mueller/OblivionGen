## Adaptive Credential Orchestration via Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the existing credential recovery system with continuous behavioral biometric authentication to dynamically adjust access control *before* a recovery process is even initiated. This moves beyond reactive recovery to proactive, risk-adaptive security.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Profile Creation & Monitoring Module:**

*   **Data Collection:**  Continuously collect data points from user interactions: keystroke dynamics, mouse movement patterns, scrolling speed, typing cadence, application usage sequences, and time-of-day access patterns.  These are treated as a 'behavioral fingerprint'.  Data is anonymized and encrypted at rest and in transit.
*   **Baseline Establishment:** During initial system use and during periods of confirmed valid authentication, establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user. This utilizes statistical modeling (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian Mixture Models) to map typical behavior.
*   **Real-time Deviation Analysis:**  Continuously compare current user behavior to the established baseline.  Calculate a ‘deviation score’ representing the degree of difference.  Thresholds are dynamically adjusted based on environmental factors (e.g., location, network type).
*   **Data Storage:**  Behavioral data is stored separately from credential data, using a dedicated, highly secure database.  Data retention policies are configurable.

**2. Risk-Adaptive Access Control Layer:**

*   **Integration with Existing System:**  Intermediary layer between client requests and the credential validation/recovery system.
*   **Deviation Score Interpretation:**  
    *   **Low Deviation:**  Access granted normally.
    *   **Medium Deviation:**  Trigger a ‘soft challenge’.  This might involve:
        *   Requesting a secondary factor (e.g., push notification to trusted device).
        *   Displaying a CAPTCHA.
        *   Presenting a knowledge-based question with a larger selection of answers.
    *   **High Deviation:**  Block access and initiate the existing credential recovery process. Prioritize recovery methods based on deviation analysis—a rapid shift suggests compromise, so stronger methods (e.g., biometric verification) are preferred.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:**  Dynamically adjust deviation score thresholds based on:
    *   **User Risk Profile:** Categorize users based on sensitivity of data accessed.
    *   **Environmental Context:**  Consider network location, device type, time of day.
    *   **System Learning:**  Utilize machine learning to refine thresholds over time.

**3.  Credential Recovery Enhancement Module:**

*   **Deviation Data Integration:** When the existing credential recovery process *is* initiated, the Deviation Score and associated data are passed as context.
*   **Method Prioritization:** The recovery system prioritizes recovery methods based on Deviation Score.  
    *   **High Deviation:** Focus on strong authentication methods (biometrics, hardware tokens).
    *   **Low Deviation:**  Allow self-service recovery options (knowledge-based questions, one-time passwords).
*   **Fraud Detection:**  Use deviation data to flag potentially fraudulent recovery attempts.  

**Pseudocode (Risk-Adaptive Access Control Layer):**

```
function processRequest(request):
  user = request.user
  deviationScore = calculateDeviationScore(user, request.interactionData)

  if deviationScore < lowThreshold:
    // Normal Access
    validateCredentials(request)
    grantAccess(request)
  else if deviationScore < mediumThreshold:
    // Soft Challenge
    presentSoftChallenge(user)
    if challengeSuccessful():
      validateCredentials(request)
      grantAccess(request)
    else:
      initiateCredentialRecovery(user)
  else:
    // High Deviation - Block Access & Initiate Recovery
    initiateCredentialRecovery(user)
```

**Novelty:** This design moves beyond simply *recovering* credentials to *proactively adapting* security based on real-time behavioral analysis, minimizing the need for recovery in the first place. It integrates behavioral biometrics with existing credential management systems, creating a layered security approach that is both more secure and more user-friendly.
