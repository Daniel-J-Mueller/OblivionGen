## Adaptive Anomaly Weighting via Generative Counterfactuals

**Concept:** Extend the VAE/RIF anomaly detection system by incorporating a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to create 'counterfactual' time series data points. These counterfactuals represent 'what *should* have happened' based on learned normal behavior.  Anomaly weighting is then adjusted dynamically based on the divergence between reconstructed data and the GAN-generated counterfactuals, providing a more nuanced and sensitive anomaly score.

**Specs:**

**1. GAN Component:**

*   **Architecture:** A conditional GAN (cGAN). The generator takes latent variables (from the VAE encoder) *and* a time-step indicator as input. The discriminator attempts to distinguish between real time-series data and GAN-generated data at specific time-steps.
*   **Training:** Train the cGAN *concurrently* with the VAE. The loss function incorporates both standard GAN loss (discriminator/generator) and a reconstruction loss that encourages the generated data to align with the original data. A 'regularization' term penalizes high divergence between the GAN output and the VAE reconstructed output, to maintain consistency.
*   **Output:** At each time-step, the cGAN produces a 'normal' expected time-series value, given the latent representation of the observed data.

**2. Enhanced Anomaly Scoring:**

*   **Divergence Metric:** Calculate a divergence metric (e.g., Mean Squared Error, Kullback-Leibler Divergence) between:
    *   The actual observed time-series data.
    *   The VAE reconstructed time-series data.
    *   The cGAN-generated 'normal' time-series data.
*   **Weighted Anomaly Score:** Calculate the final anomaly score using a weighted sum:

    `Anomaly Score = (Weight_Reconstruction * Reconstruction_Divergence) + (Weight_Counterfactual * Counterfactual_Divergence)`

    `Weight_Reconstruction + Weight_Counterfactual = 1`

    The weights can be fixed, or dynamically adjusted based on the characteristics of the input data.  For example, if the reconstruction divergence is consistently low, the `Weight_Counterfactual` is increased to emphasize subtle deviations from expected behavior.
*   **RIF Integration:** The weighted anomaly score is then fed into the RIF algorithm as the input for anomaly isolation. This allows the RIF to focus on the most significant deviations from both the reconstructed data *and* the expected normal behavior.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Components:**
    *   VAE (Encoder/Decoder) â€“ as defined in the original patent.
    *   cGAN (Generator/Discriminator)
    *   Divergence Calculation Module
    *   Weighted Anomaly Scoring Module
    *   RIF Algorithm
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  Raw time-series data enters the system.
    2.  The VAE encoder produces latent variables.
    3.  The VAE decoder reconstructs the time-series data.
    4.  The cGAN generator produces a counterfactual time-series data point.
    5.  The divergence calculation module computes the reconstruction divergence and counterfactual divergence.
    6.  The weighted anomaly scoring module calculates the final anomaly score.
    7.  The RIF algorithm isolates anomalies based on the weighted anomaly score.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Input: time_series_data
# Output: anomaly_score

# 1. Encode to latent variables
latent_variables = VAE_encoder(time_series_data)

# 2. Decode to reconstruct
reconstructed_data = VAE_decoder(latent_variables)

# 3. Generate counterfactual
counterfactual_data = cGAN_generator(latent_variables, current_time_step)

# 4. Calculate divergences
reconstruction_divergence = calculate_divergence(time_series_data, reconstructed_data)
counterfactual_divergence = calculate_divergence(time_series_data, counterfactual_data)

# 5. Calculate weighted anomaly score
weight_reconstruction = 0.6  # Adjustable parameter
weight_counterfactual = 0.4 # Adjustable parameter
anomaly_score = (weight_reconstruction * reconstruction_divergence) + (weight_counterfactual * counterfactual_divergence)

# 6. Anomaly Isolation with RIF
anomaly_result = RIF_algorithm(anomaly_score)

return anomaly_result
```

This approach allows for a more robust and sensitive anomaly detection system that can identify subtle deviations from expected behavior, providing a higher level of accuracy and reducing false positives. The dynamic weighting of the anomaly score allows the system to adapt to different data characteristics and improve its performance over time.
