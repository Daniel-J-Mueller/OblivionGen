**Dynamic Sub-Pixel Sculpting with Micro-Lens Arrays**

**Concept:** Enhance color gamut and perceived resolution by dynamically shaping sub-pixels using integrated micro-lens arrays controlled by electrowetting principles. This moves beyond simple color filtering to actively manipulate light paths *within* each pixel.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Stack:** Core electrowetting display structure as in the reference patent, but with a crucial addition: A layer of individually addressable micro-lenses integrated *above* the color filter layer (between color filter and viewing surface).
*   **Micro-Lens Array:** High-density array of micro-lenses, each approximately 5-10 microns in diameter. Each lens is a cavity filled with a clear fluid.
*   **Electrowetting Control:** Each micro-lens cavity has an associated electrowetting cell. Applying voltage alters the shape of the lens, focusing or dispersing light.
*   **Addressing Scheme:** Each micro-lens is addressed individually via a thin-film transistor (TFT) backplane similar to existing LCD/OLED addressing schemes.
*   **Color Filter Arrangement:** Standard RGB or more advanced color filter arrangements (e.g., Pentile) are permissible.
*   **Software Control:** Software algorithm that analyzes image data and dynamically adjusts the shape of each micro-lens to:
    *   **Sub-Pixel Blending:** Precisely blend light from adjacent sub-pixels to create intermediate colors, expanding the color gamut beyond that achievable with static filters.
    *   **Perceived Resolution Enhancement:**  Focus light from multiple sub-pixels onto a single point, effectively increasing the perceived resolution for fine details.
    *   **Contrast Enhancement:** Shape the lenses to direct more light towards the viewer in bright scenes and less in dark scenes, dynamically adjusting contrast.

**Pseudocode (simplified image processing):**

```
FOR each pixel in image:
    FOR each subpixel (R, G, B):
        desired_color = subpixel_color
        
        IF desired_color is outside standard color gamut:
            blend_factor = calculate_blend_factor(desired_color, color_gamut)
            
            // Adjust lens shape to blend light from neighboring subpixels
            adjust_lens_shape(lens_address, blend_factor)
        ELSE:
            adjust_lens_shape(lens_address, 1.0)  // Default lens shape
            
        IF pixel contains fine detail:
            focus_factor = calculate_focus_factor(detail_level)
            adjust_lens_shape(lens_address, focus_factor)
```

**Material Requirements:**

*   Electrowetting fluid:  Low viscosity, high dielectric constant.
*   Micro-lens cavity material: Transparent, mechanically robust polymer.
*   Thin-film transistor materials: Standard TFT materials (e.g., amorphous silicon).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Expanded color gamut
*   Enhanced perceived resolution
*   Dynamic contrast enhancement
*   Improved viewing angles
*   Potentially lower power consumption (by optimizing light transmission)

**Further Research:**

*   Optimization of micro-lens geometry and array density.
*   Development of advanced control algorithms for dynamic sub-pixel sculpting.
*   Integration with existing display manufacturing processes.
*   Investigation of the impact on viewing angle and off-axis performance.
