## Adaptive Trust Scoring with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the current signature/token-based authentication with a dynamic trust score calculated from real-time behavioral biometrics. This introduces a layered security approach where authentication isn't a one-time event, but a continuous assessment of trustworthiness.

**Specifications:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collection Module:**  Integrated within the network-addressable device (or agent on a user’s endpoint).  Captures:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, rhythm).
    *   Mouse/Touch movement patterns (speed, acceleration, trajectory, pressure).
    *   Device motion (accelerometer/gyroscope data – relevant for mobile devices).
    *   Application usage patterns (frequency, sequence, duration).
*   **Feature Extraction & Profiling:**
    *   Extracted features from raw behavioral data are fed into a machine learning model (e.g., Hidden Markov Model, Recurrent Neural Network) to create a personalized behavioral profile for each user/device.  Profiles are stored securely alongside existing authentication data.
    *   The model must handle drift (changes in user behavior over time) through continuous learning.
*   **Real-time Trust Score Calculation:**
    *   Incoming behavioral data is compared to the established profile. A trust score (0-100) is calculated based on the degree of similarity/deviation.
    *   The trust score is weighted and combined with the existing signature/token validation score.
*   **Dynamic Access Control:**
    *   Access is granted/denied based on a combined score that exceeds a predefined threshold.
    *   The threshold can be adjusted dynamically based on the sensitivity of the requested resource/operation.  Higher sensitivity = higher threshold.
    *   Actions can be taken based on score deviations:
        *   **Low Deviation:**  Normal operation.
        *   **Moderate Deviation:**  Multi-factor authentication prompt (e.g., OTP, biometric scan).
        *   **High Deviation:**  Access denied, alert triggered.
*   **API Integration:**
    *   Provide APIs for:
        *   Enrolling new users/devices.
        *   Updating behavioral profiles.
        *   Querying trust scores.
        *   Configuring access control policies.
*   **Data Privacy:**
    *   Behavioral data is anonymized and encrypted at rest and in transit.
    *   Users have control over their data and can opt out of behavioral tracking.

**Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(behavioralData, userProfile) {
  // Extract features from behavioralData
  features = extractFeatures(behavioralData);

  // Calculate similarity score between features and userProfile
  similarityScore = calculateSimilarity(features, userProfile);

  // Adjust score based on profile confidence (age, completeness)
  adjustedScore = similarityScore * profileConfidence;

  // Normalize score to 0-100 range
  trustScore = adjustedScore * 100;

  return trustScore;
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Network-addressable devices with sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, touch screen, etc.).
*   Sufficient processing power and memory to run the machine learning models.
*   Secure storage for behavioral profiles and authentication data.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual behavioral patterns that may indicate malicious activity.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Incorporate contextual factors (location, time of day, network environment) into the trust score calculation.
*   **Federated Learning:** Train the machine learning models on decentralized data sources without sharing sensitive information.
