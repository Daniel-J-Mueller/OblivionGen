## Adaptive Credential Orchestration via Decentralized Identity & Verifiable Credentials

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Move beyond short-lived credentials linked *solely* to a central authority. Implement a system leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) to create a dynamically adjusting trust fabric.  This allows applications to request *precisely* the permissions they need, and those permissions are cryptographically proven by multiple, independent issuers – not just a single central server.

**II. Components:**

*   **DID Provider:**  A service that registers and manages DIDs for application servers (the 'clients' in the original patent). This is akin to establishing a digital identity for each application server.
*   **VC Issuers:** Multiple, independent entities (internal teams, third-party services) capable of issuing VCs attesting to specific application capabilities or permissions (e.g., “Authorized to access database X with read-only access”, “Compliant with security standard Y”).  Each issuer has a strong cryptographic key pair.
*   **Credential Orchestrator:**  A module residing on the application server.  It handles requests from applications for specific resources, gathers relevant VCs from various issuers, and presents a combined, cryptographically verifiable proof to the resource provider.
*   **Resource Provider:** The service being accessed (e.g., database, API).  It verifies the presented VCs and grants access accordingly.
*   **Dynamic Trust Policy Engine:** A rule-based engine that monitors application behavior and dynamically adjusts the required VCs. For example, if an application unexpectedly tries to access a new resource, the engine automatically requests a new VC from the appropriate issuer.

**III. Workflow:**

1.  **Registration:** Application server registers a DID with the DID Provider.
2.  **Initial Credential Issuance:**  Initial VCs, defining basic application capabilities, are issued by designated issuers and stored on the application server.
3.  **Resource Request:** An application requests access to a resource.
4.  **VC Discovery & Aggregation:** The Credential Orchestrator determines which VCs are required for access. It queries various issuers for relevant VCs.
5.  **Cryptographic Proof Generation:** The Orchestrator aggregates the VCs and generates a cryptographic proof demonstrating that the application possesses the necessary permissions. This proof includes digital signatures from each VC issuer.
6.  **Verification & Access:** The Resource Provider verifies the cryptographic proof. If valid, access is granted.
7.  **Behavioral Monitoring & Dynamic Adjustment:** The Dynamic Trust Policy Engine monitors application behavior. If the application attempts an action outside its authorized scope, the engine automatically triggers a request for a new VC from the appropriate issuer. This VC request is cryptographically signed and authenticated.
8.  **Revocation Handling:**  VC Issuers maintain revocation lists. The Resource Provider checks for revoked credentials during verification.

**IV. Pseudocode (Credential Orchestrator):**

```
function requestAccess(resource, applicationDID):
  requiredCredentials = determineRequiredCredentials(resource)
  retrievedCredentials = retrieveCredentials(requiredCredentials)

  if (missingCredentials):
    requestNewCredentials(missingCredentials, applicationDID)
    retrievedCredentials = retrieveCredentials(missingCredentials)

  proof = generateProof(retrievedCredentials, applicationDID)
  return proof

function generateProof(credentials, applicationDID):
  // Aggregate credentials and create a cryptographically signed proof
  // Include signatures from each credential issuer
  signedProof = ... // Implementation details omitted
  return signedProof

function requestNewCredentials(credentialRequirements, applicationDID):
  // Loop through credential requirements
  // For each requirement:
  //   Identify the issuer
  //   Create a signed request for the credential
  //   Send the request to the issuer
  //   Receive the credential (or rejection)
  // Handle errors (e.g., issuer unavailable, credential denied)

function determineRequiredCredentials(resource):
  // Query a policy engine or configuration file to determine
  // the required credentials for accessing the resource
  // Return a list of credential requirements (e.g., "Read Access to Database X")
```

**V. Novelty:**

This design moves beyond centralized credential management and embraces a decentralized trust model.  The dynamic adjustment of credentials based on application behavior enhances security and reduces the attack surface. Leveraging VCs and DIDs provides cryptographic proof of authenticity and authorization, mitigating the risks associated with traditional credential-based systems. It introduces adaptability *during* operation, instead of just initial setup.
