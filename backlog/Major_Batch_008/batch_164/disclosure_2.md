## Adaptive Acoustic Zoning with Personalized HRTF Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the beamforming and signal selection principles of the patent to create dynamic acoustic zones within a space, personalized to each user's head-related transfer function (HRTF). This moves beyond simply selecting *which* signal to process, to actively shaping the *sound field* itself.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones, distributed spatially).
    *   High-fidelity loudspeaker system (capable of accurate directional audio).
    *   User wearable (earbuds/headphones with integrated inertial measurement unit (IMU) and potentially physiological sensors – heart rate, skin conductance).
    *   Dedicated processing unit (edge computing preferred, low latency).

*   **Software Modules:**

    1.  **HRTF Profiling:**
        *   Initial calibration phase: User wears the wearable, and the system generates an individualized HRTF profile using a series of precisely calibrated sound source emissions and measurements from the wearable’s microphones.  This profile captures how the user’s head and ears uniquely process sound. This will be saved for future sessions.
        *   Dynamic Adjustment: The IMU data tracks head movements. The HRTF profile is dynamically adjusted in real-time to compensate for head rotation and position, ensuring accurate spatial audio rendering.

    2.  **Source Localization & Tracking:**
        *   Multi-microphone array processes incoming audio to identify and track multiple sound sources (speech, music, environmental sounds).
        *   Algorithm combines beamforming, time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA), and potentially visual tracking (if integrated camera system) to improve accuracy.

    3.  **Acoustic Zone Definition:**
        *   User Interface (app or software): Allows users to define “acoustic zones” within their environment. Examples: “Focus Zone” around their workstation, “Quiet Zone” for relaxation, “Social Zone” for communication.
        *   Zone Geometry:  Zones are defined as 3D volumes (spheres, cuboids, or user-defined shapes).

    4.  **Adaptive Beamforming & Signal Processing:**
        *   For each user-defined zone, the system utilizes adaptive beamforming to:
            *   Enhance sounds originating *within* the zone (e.g., a colleague’s speech in the “Social Zone”).
            *   Suppress sounds originating *outside* the zone (e.g., background noise in the “Focus Zone”).
        *   Utilize the user’s personalized HRTF profile to render the enhanced sounds with accurate spatialization, creating the perception of sound originating from the correct location within the zone.
        *   Dynamically adjust beamforming weights and HRTF rendering based on:
            *   Sound source location and movement.
            *   User head movements.
            *   User preferences (e.g., level of noise suppression).
            *   Physiological data (e.g., increase noise suppression if user shows signs of stress).

    5.  **Communication Protocol:**
        *   Multi-device communication to allow multiple users to benefit from this technology.
        *   Allow a shared space to become 'segmented', based on zones.

*   **Pseudocode (Adaptive Beamforming with HRTF):**

```
// For each user and zone:
For each sound source:
    Calculate source location.
    If source location is within zone:
        Calculate beamforming weights to enhance sound from source.
        Apply beamforming weights to microphone signals.
        Apply user's personalized HRTF profile to render sound with accurate spatialization.
        Output enhanced and spatialized sound to user's headphones.
    Else:
        Calculate beamforming weights to suppress sound from source.
        Apply beamforming weights to microphone signals.
        Output suppressed sound to user's headphones.
```

*   **Potential Use Cases:**
    *   Open-plan offices: Create personalized “acoustic bubbles” around each workstation.
    *   Home offices: Enhance remote communication while minimizing distractions.
    *   Virtual reality/augmented reality:  Create more immersive and realistic soundscapes.
    *   Public spaces:  Improve audio clarity and reduce noise pollution in crowded environments.
