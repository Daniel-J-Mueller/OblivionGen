## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Dock

**Concept:** Integrate localized, programmable haptic feedback into the dock to communicate device status, charging progress, or incoming notifications *through* the docked device itself. This moves beyond visual indicators and leverages the device’s physical surface as a communication channel.

**Specifications:**

*   **Dock Material:** Primarily a durable polymer (ABS or Polycarbonate) with localized areas of flexible, high-durometer silicone or TPU integrated into the interior surfaces of both the top and bottom sections. These areas will house miniature linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motors.
*   **Actuator Density:** Minimum 3 actuators strategically placed along the contact points of the dock’s top and bottom sections, concentrating on areas corresponding to key device interaction points (e.g., where a thumb naturally rests). Scalable to a 5x5 matrix for more complex feedback patterns.
*   **Power & Control:** Dock integrates with the docked device via the pogo pins for both power delivery *and* data communication (I2C or SPI). A dedicated microcontroller within the dock manages the actuators and interprets commands from the docked device.
*   **Feedback Profiles:** Pre-programmed feedback profiles (e.g., pulsing for charging, rhythmic tapping for notifications, varying intensity for battery level). User-configurable profiles via a companion app.
*   **Localization Algorithm:** Implement a localization algorithm within the dock’s firmware. This algorithm uses input from the docked device (e.g., touch events, accelerometer data) to determine *where* on the device a user is interacting, and then activates the corresponding actuators on the dock.
*   **Force Sensing Integration (Optional):** Integrate miniature force sensors into the top section of the dock. These sensors detect pressure from the docked device and can be used to trigger specific haptic feedback patterns or adjust actuator intensity based on grip strength.
*   **Software Interface:**  SDK provided for developers to create custom haptic feedback experiences tailored to specific apps or device functionalities.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Trigger):**

```
// Event: Incoming Notification
function handleNotification(notificationType, intensity) {
  // Determine optimal actuator locations based on notification type
  actuatorLocations = getActuatorLocations(notificationType);

  // Activate actuators with specified intensity and pattern
  for each location in actuatorLocations {
    activateActuator(location, intensity, pattern="pulse");
  }
}

// Event: Charging Status Update
function handleChargingUpdate(chargeLevel) {
  // Map charge level to actuator intensity
  intensity = map(chargeLevel, 0, 100, 0, 100);

  // Activate actuators in a circular pattern to indicate charging progress
  activateCircularPattern(intensity);
}

// Event: User Touch Input
function handleTouchInput(x, y) {
  // Determine closest actuator to touch location
  closestActuator = findClosestActuator(x, y);

  // Activate actuator with a brief impulse
  activateActuator(closestActuator, intensity=50, duration=10ms);
}
```

**Refinement Notes:**  The localized haptic feedback system could be extended to include temperature control elements, adding another layer of sensory communication. Material selection is critical to maximize tactile sensation and minimize vibration bleed-through. Thorough testing is needed to ensure the feedback patterns are both informative and non-distracting.
