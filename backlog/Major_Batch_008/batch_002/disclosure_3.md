## Decentralized Key Escrow with Zero-Knowledge Proofs

**Specification:** A system enabling secure key escrow leveraging a distributed ledger and zero-knowledge proofs to minimize trust and maximize security. This builds on the core idea of managed keys within the provided patent, but removes the central control point of the cryptography service.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Distributed Ledger (DLT):** A permissioned or public DLT (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Ethereum) serves as the foundation. All key escrow-related actions are recorded immutably on the ledger.

2.  **Key Fragmentation & Distribution:** A master key is algorithmically split into *n* shares using a secret sharing scheme (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing). Each share is assigned to a unique “Custodian” node within the DLT network.

3.  **Custodian Nodes:** These nodes are responsible for securely storing their assigned key share. Custodians are incentivized (e.g., through token rewards) to maintain uptime and data integrity.

4.  **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Circuit:** A crucial component. This circuit allows a user (the key owner) to *prove* to the Custodian nodes that they possess the necessary information to reconstruct the full key *without revealing* that information.

5.  **Escrow Smart Contract:** A smart contract deployed on the DLT governs the key recovery process. It orchestrates the ZKP verification and key reconstruction.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Key Creation & Escrow:** The user initiates key creation. The system generates the master key, fragments it, and distributes shares to Custodian nodes. Metadata about key ownership and recovery policies is stored on the DLT.

2.  **Key Access Request:** When the user needs to access the key, they initiate a request through the smart contract.

3.  **ZKP Generation & Verification:**
    *   The user generates a ZKP demonstrating knowledge of all necessary shares to reconstruct the master key. This is done *locally* without exposing the shares.
    *   The smart contract broadcasts the ZKP to the Custodian nodes.
    *   Each Custodian node verifies the ZKP *without* learning anything about the user’s shares.

4.  **Key Reconstruction (Conditional):** If *all* Custodian nodes successfully verify the ZKP, the smart contract initiates a process to securely reconstruct the master key *only* within a trusted execution environment (TEE) controlled by the smart contract.

5.  **Key Delivery:** The reconstructed key is delivered to the user's authorized application.

**Pseudocode (ZKP Verification within Smart Contract):**

```
function verifyZKP(zkp: ZKP, custodianID: int) {
  // Input: ZKP object, Custodian Node ID
  // Output: Boolean (true if verification succeeds, false otherwise)

  // 1. Verify ZKP signature and validity
  if (!isValidZKP(zkp)) {
    return false;
  }

  // 2.  Retrieve Custodian's public key
  custodianPublicKey = getCustodianPublicKey(custodianID);

  // 3. Use Custodian's public key to verify the ZKP proof
  verificationResult = verifyProof(zkp, custodianPublicKey);

  // 4. Return verification result
  return verificationResult;
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **ZKP:**  Encapsulates the proof data, commitment, and verification key.
*   **CustodianRecord:** Includes Custodian ID, public key, uptime metrics, and reward balance.
*   **KeyRecord:** Stores key metadata, shard locations, owner ID, and access policies.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Threshold Decryption:**  Integrate threshold decryption to further enhance key security.
*   **Reputation System:** Implement a reputation system for Custodian nodes to incentivize good behavior.
*   **Automated Key Rotation:**  Enable automated key rotation to minimize the impact of key compromise.
*   **Multi-Party Computation (MPC):** Integrate MPC techniques for enhanced privacy and security during key reconstruction.
