## Decentralized Swarm Intelligence via Bio-Inspired Communication

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple message vetting to create a dynamic, bio-inspired communication system between unmanned vehicles, mimicking slime mold optimization for pathfinding and resource allocation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Node Definition (Unmanned Vehicle):**

*   **ID:** Unique alphanumeric identifier.
*   **Location:** GPS coordinates, updated continuously.
*   **Energy Level:** Percentage of remaining battery/fuel.
*   **Payload Capacity:** Maximum weight/volume of carried resources.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Data feed from onboard sensors (cameras, lidar, thermal, etc.). This data is *not* directly transmitted but is used for local ‘attractiveness’ calculations (see Section 3).
*   **Communication Range:** Maximum reliable communication distance.
*   **Attractiveness Factor:** A dynamically calculated value based on:
    *   Energy Level (lower = less attractive).
    *   Payload Capacity (higher = more attractive).
    *   Sensor Data (relevant to the current objective - e.g., thermal signature for search and rescue, object recognition for delivery).
    *   Proximity to Objective (closer = more attractive).

**2. Communication Protocol: ‘Pheromone’ Broadcasting**

*   **Message Type:**  Short-lived ‘Pheromone’ packets. These are *not* individual messages with specific content, but rather broadcasts of the Node’s Attractiveness Factor and a timestamp.
*   **Broadcast Frequency:**  Variable, dynamically adjusted based on energy level and network density.  Lower energy = less frequent broadcasts.  Higher network density = less frequent broadcasts.
*   **Broadcast Range:**  Limited to Communication Range.
*   **Reception Logic:**  Each Node maintains a rolling history of received Pheromone packets.

**3. Pathfinding & Resource Allocation Algorithm (Slime Mold Inspired):**

*   **Objective Definition:** A designated target location or resource.
*   **Network Initialization:** All Nodes broadcast their initial Attractiveness Factor.
*   **Attractiveness Mapping:** Each Node creates a local ‘attractiveness map’ based on:
    *   Received Pheromone packet Attractiveness Factors (weighted by distance and timestamp - older signals have less weight).
    *   Node's own Attractiveness Factor.
    *   Distance to the Objective.
*   **Gradient Ascent:** Each Node iteratively moves towards the highest concentration of Attractiveness, factoring in its own energy level and obstacle avoidance.  This creates emergent pathways.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   Nodes that reach the Objective deposit a virtual ‘resource’ signal, increasing the local Attractiveness.
    *   Nodes with low energy levels ‘decay’ their Attractiveness over time.
    *   Nodes that encounter obstacles reduce their Attractiveness in that direction.

**4.  Quorum & Vetting (Adapted from Patent):**

*   Instead of vetting specific messages, Nodes now vet the *validity of pathways*.
*   A pathway is considered ‘vetted’ if a sufficient number of independent Nodes have traversed it successfully *and* reported a positive outcome (e.g., reached the objective).
*   This quorum is dynamic and adjusts based on the criticality of the objective and the number of available Nodes.

**Pseudocode (Node Logic):**

```
Initialize:
  set NodeID, Location, EnergyLevel, PayloadCapacity, SensorSuite, CommunicationRange
  set AttractivenessFactor = calculateInitialAttractiveness()

Loop:
  update Location()
  update EnergyLevel()
  update AttractivenessFactor()

  broadcast Pheromone(AttractivenessFactor, timestamp)

  receive PheromonePackets()
  create AttractivenessMap(PheromonePackets)

  calculate NextMove(AttractivenessMap, ObjectiveLocation, EnergyLevel)
  move to NextMove()

  if reached Objective():
    deposit ResourceSignal()

  if EnergyLevel < threshold:
    decay AttractivenessFactor()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Search and Rescue operations in complex environments.
*   Autonomous delivery networks in urban areas.
*   Environmental monitoring and data collection.
*   Swarm robotics for construction and disaster relief.
