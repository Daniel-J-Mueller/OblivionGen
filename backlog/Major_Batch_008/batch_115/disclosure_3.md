## Adaptive Network Persona Construction & Behavioral Anomaly Detection

**Concept:** Extend the context-aware DLP framework to dynamically construct “Network Personas” for users based on observed network behavior, then use these personas to detect anomalies *before* they trigger content-based DLP rules. This shifts focus from *what* data is leaving to *how* a user is behaving, creating a proactive security layer.

**Specs:**

**I. Persona Construction Module**

*   **Data Ingestion:** Continuously monitor network traffic associated with a user (identified by credentials or device ID). Capture the following features:
    *   Time of day/week access patterns.
    *   Applications accessed (categorized).
    *   Data transfer volumes (per application/category).
    *   Destination IP ranges/domains (categorized - e.g., cloud storage, social media, personal email).
    *   Protocol usage (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SSH).
    *   Packet inter-arrival times (to identify potential automated data exfiltration).
*   **Behavioral Modeling:** Employ a time-series decomposition technique (e.g., Seasonal-Trend decomposition using Loess - STL) to establish baseline behavioral profiles for each user. This yields:
    *   Seasonal patterns (daily/weekly/monthly access routines).
    *   Trend analysis (increasing/decreasing usage of specific applications/services).
    *   Residual noise (random fluctuations in behavior).
*   **Persona Definition:**  Represent each user's behavior as a weighted combination of these features.  The weights are dynamically adjusted based on recent activity.
    *   Persona = w1 * SeasonalPattern + w2 * Trend + w3 * ResidualNoise.
    *   Weights are updated using an exponential moving average, giving more weight to recent data.
*   **Persona Storage:** Store personas in a high-performance key-value store (e.g., Redis) for fast retrieval during anomaly detection.

**II. Anomaly Detection Module**

*   **Real-time Feature Extraction:** For each network flow, extract the same features used for persona construction.
*   **Deviation Scoring:** Calculate a deviation score by comparing the real-time feature vector to the user's stored persona. Use a distance metric such as Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.
    *   DeviationScore = Distance(RealTimeFeatures, PersonaFeatures).
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the anomaly threshold based on the user's historical deviation scores. Use a statistical method like the Interquartile Range (IQR) or Z-score to identify outliers.
*   **Anomaly Classification:** Categorize anomalies based on the features exhibiting the highest deviation.  Examples:
    *   “Unusual Time Access” – Accessing resources outside of normal working hours.
    *   “Unexpected Application Usage” – Using an application not previously observed.
    *   “High-Volume Data Transfer” –  Transferring a large amount of data to an unusual destination.
*   **Alerting & Response:** Trigger alerts based on the severity of the anomaly and the classification. Initiate automated responses such as:
    *   Logging the event.
    *   Redirecting traffic for further inspection.
    *   Requiring multi-factor authentication.
    *   Temporarily blocking access.

**III. System Architecture**

*   **Deployment:** Implement as a distributed system using a message queue (e.g., Kafka) to handle high volumes of network traffic.
*   **Components:**
    *   **Network Packet Capture:** Capture network traffic using tools like tcpdump or Wireshark.
    *   **Feature Extraction Service:** Extract features from network packets.
    *   **Persona Management Service:** Store and manage user personas.
    *   **Anomaly Detection Service:** Detect anomalies in real-time.
    *   **Alerting & Response Service:** Trigger alerts and initiate automated responses.
*   **Integration:** Integrate with existing DLP systems to enhance their capabilities.
