**Personalized Recommendation 'Echo Chambers' & Bursting**

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on *comparing* recommendation engines. This builds on that by deliberately creating, then breaking, personalized 'echo chambers' to expand user discovery.  Instead of simply optimizing for immediate positive response, we aim to broaden horizons *after* establishing preference.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** 'Echo Chamber Generator' (ECG). This module initially serves recommendations highly aligned with established user profiles (purchases, views, explicit preferences). This quickly builds a strong positive feedback loop – the ‘echo chamber’.
*   **Chamber Duration:** Configurable via a 'Chamber Lifetime' parameter (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days, user-defined).
*   **Burst Module:** After the Chamber Lifetime, the ‘Burst Module’ activates. This module injects recommendations *intentionally* dissimilar to the user's established preferences. The degree of dissimilarity is controlled by a ‘Burst Radius’ parameter – a numerical value representing the distance (in feature space) from the user’s core preferences.
*   **Dissimilarity Metric:**  A multi-dimensional feature space representing items. Features include category, price, brand, keywords, user reviews (sentiment analysis), and collaborative filtering data.  Dissimilarity is calculated using a cosine distance or similar metric.
*   **Burst Strategy:**  Several strategies are possible:
    *   **Random Burst:** Selects random items outside the Burst Radius.
    *   **Thematic Burst:** Selects items from entirely unrelated categories.
    *   **Trend Burst:**  Highlights trending items *outside* the user’s typical preferences.
    *   **Serendipity Burst:** Focuses on items with high potential for surprising the user (based on novelty and unexpected features).
*   **Monitoring & Adjustment:** The system monitors user reactions to Burst recommendations. Reactions are categorized as positive (click, purchase, save), negative (dismiss, ignore), or neutral.
*   **Adaptive Burst Radius:** The Burst Radius is dynamically adjusted based on user reaction. If the user consistently rejects Burst recommendations, the radius is decreased. If the user responds positively, the radius is increased.
*   **User Control:**  Users can opt-out of the Echo Chamber/Burst cycle or adjust the frequency/intensity of bursts.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
For each user:
    ECG.GenerateEchoChamber(user.profile)  // Initial recommendations
    Set ChamberStartTime = CurrentTime()
    While (CurrentTime() - ChamberStartTime < ChamberLifetime):
        ServeEchoChamberRecommendations()

    BurstModule.InitiateBurst(user.profile)

    While (BurstDuration):
        ServeBurstRecommendations()
        MonitorUserReaction()
        AdjustBurstRadius(UserReaction)

    // Repeat cycle or return to standard recommendation algorithm
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed User Profiles (purchase history, browsing data, demographics, explicit preferences)
*   Item Metadata (category, price, brand, keywords, descriptions)
*   User Review Data (text and sentiment analysis)
*   Real-time Trending Data

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased User Engagement
*   Discovery of New Interests
*   Reduced Filter Bubbles
*   Improved Recommendation Diversity
*   Potential for Increased Sales (by exposing users to a wider range of products)
