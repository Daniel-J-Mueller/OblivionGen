## Adaptive Credential Lifecycle Management with Behavioral Biometrics

**Specification:**

**I. System Overview:**

This system expands on the concept of proactive credential status indicators by integrating behavioral biometrics to dynamically adjust access controls and credential generation triggers. It moves beyond simply *reporting* a credential's availability to *anticipating* access needs and potential security risks.

**II. Components:**

*   **Behavioral Data Collector:**  A client-side agent (integrated into the VM access portal/application) that continuously collects behavioral data from the requesting user. Data points include:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure, patterns)
    *   Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns)
    *   Scrolling behavior
    *   Application usage patterns (sequence, frequency)
    *   Time of day access attempts
*   **Behavioral Profile Builder:** A server-side module that constructs and maintains a baseline behavioral profile for each user. This uses machine learning algorithms (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to learn typical user behavior.
*   **Anomaly Detector:**  A server-side module that compares current user behavior (from the Behavioral Data Collector) against their established behavioral profile.  It identifies anomalies or deviations that could indicate compromised credentials or unauthorized access attempts.  Anomaly scoring is applied, weighting different data points based on their predictive power.
*   **Adaptive Credential Manager:** The central control module. Based on the anomaly score and pre-defined policies, it governs:
    *   **Credential Generation Triggers:**  Initiates credential generation *before* a user explicitly requests it, anticipating need based on behavioral patterns. (e.g., if a user typically accesses a VM at 9 AM, the system proactively generates a temporary password at 8:55 AM).
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) Adjustment:** Dynamically adjusts the strength of MFA based on anomaly scores.  Low scores might require only a simple password, while high scores could trigger biometric verification or device authentication.
    *   **Session Monitoring & Termination:** Monitors ongoing VM sessions for behavioral anomalies.  If anomalies are detected, the system can alert administrators or automatically terminate the session.
*   **Secure Data Store:** Stores user behavioral profiles, anomaly scores, and session data securely. Encryption at rest and in transit is required.

**III. Pseudocode â€“ Adaptive Credential Generation:**

```
FUNCTION GenerateCredentialProactively(userID)
  behavioralProfile = GetBehavioralProfile(userID)
  predictedAccessTime = CalculatePredictedAccessTime(behavioralProfile)
  currentTime = GetCurrentTime()

  IF currentTime WITHIN (predictedAccessTime - 5 minutes, predictedAccessTime + 5 minutes) THEN
    credential = GenerateTemporaryCredential(userID)
    StoreCredentialSecurely(credential)
    Log("Proactive credential generated for user " + userID)
    RETURN credential
  ELSE
    RETURN NULL
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION DetectBehavioralAnomaly(userID, behavioralData)
  behavioralProfile = GetBehavioralProfile(userID)
  anomalyScore = CalculateAnomalyScore(behavioralData, behavioralProfile)
  IF anomalyScore > threshold THEN
    Log("Behavioral anomaly detected for user " + userID + ". Score: " + anomalyScore)
    TriggerAlert(userID, anomalyScore) //e.g., request additional verification
  ENDIF
  RETURN anomalyScore
ENDFUNCTION
```

**IV.  Policy Configuration:**

Administrators can configure policies to define:

*   Anomaly score thresholds for triggering alerts or additional verification.
*   The frequency of credential rotation based on risk profiles.
*   The types of behavioral data to collect and analyze.
*   The types of MFA to apply based on risk levels.
*   The duration of temporary credentials.

**V.  Data Privacy Considerations:**

*   User consent is required for collecting behavioral data.
*   Data must be anonymized or pseudonymized whenever possible.
*   Users should have the ability to view and delete their behavioral data.
*   Compliance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is essential.
