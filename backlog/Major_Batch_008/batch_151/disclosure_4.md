## Virtual Request Orchestration for Decentralized Identity & Action Execution

**System Overview:** A system leveraging virtual requests to enable secure, auditable action execution across a network of decentralized identities (DIDs) and services without central authority. Expands on the concept of virtual requests, but focuses on DID integration and runtime policy enforcement.

**Core Components:**

*   **DID Registrar:** Maintains a registry of DIDs and associated public keys/credentials.  This could be a blockchain-based solution or a distributed hash table.
*   **Policy Engine:** A runtime enforcement point that evaluates policies attached to DIDs and actions.  Policies can specify constraints on resource access, data usage, and execution environment.
*   **Virtual Request Broker (VRB):**  Receives initial client requests, constructs/manages virtual requests, and interacts with the Policy Engine and service providers.
*   **Service Providers:** Independent services that perform actions requested via the VRB.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Virtual Request Format:** Extend the virtual request to include:
    *   `did`: The DID of the requesting entity.
    *   `action`: The specific action to be performed (e.g., "transferFunds", "readData").
    *   `parameters`: Data required for the action.
    *   `policy_id`:  Identifier for the policy associated with the DID and action.
    *   `request_signature`: Digital signature of the request using the DID’s private key.
    *   `timestamp`: Request creation time.

2.  **Workflow:**
    *   **Request Initiation:** Client sends an initial request to the VRB, including the desired action and parameters.
    *   **DID Verification:** VRB retrieves the client’s DID and public key from the DID Registrar.
    *   **Virtual Request Construction:** VRB constructs a virtual request based on the client’s input, incorporating the DID, action, parameters, timestamp, and a reference to the relevant policy.
    *   **Policy Enforcement:** VRB sends the virtual request to the Policy Engine. The Policy Engine evaluates the policy associated with the DID and action. If the request satisfies the policy, a signed authorization token is returned.
    *   **Service Invocation:** VRB forwards the signed authorization token and relevant parameters to the appropriate service provider.
    *   **Action Execution:** Service provider executes the action and returns the result to the VRB, which then relays it to the client.

**Pseudocode (VRB):**

```pseudocode
function handleClientRequest(clientRequest):
  did = resolveDID(clientRequest.clientId)
  if did == null:
    return "Invalid Client"

  virtualRequest = createVirtualRequest(clientRequest, did)
  policyEvaluation = evaluatePolicy(virtualRequest)

  if policyEvaluation.approved:
    authorizationToken = signToken(policyEvaluation, virtualRequest)
    serviceResponse = invokeService(virtualRequest.action, authorizationToken, virtualRequest.parameters)
    return serviceResponse
  else:
    return "Policy Violation"
```

**Innovation:**

This extends the concept of virtual requests to provide a framework for secure, policy-driven action execution across decentralized identities. It decouples identity from service interaction, allowing for granular access control and auditability.  The focus on runtime policy enforcement ensures that actions are always performed within defined boundaries, even if the underlying service provider is compromised. This is not simply about translation, it is about a *control plane* for decentralized services, making it possible to build trustworthy applications in a Web3 environment.
