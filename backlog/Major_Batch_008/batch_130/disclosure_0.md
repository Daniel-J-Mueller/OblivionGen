## Dynamic Authentication Object 'Chaining' & Contextual Policy Application

**System Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Extend the authentication object concept to allow *chained* authentication. Instead of a single authentication object granting access, an initial object triggers a sequence requiring further validation via subsequent objects – potentially across multiple devices and user actions.  This incorporates real-time contextual policy enforcement.

**Components:**

1.  **Authentication Object Manager (AOM):** Centralized service responsible for creation, storage, and management of authentication objects and chains.  Includes a policy engine.
2.  **Contextual Data Aggregator (CDA):** A service operating on the user’s device (and potentially cloud-sourced data) collecting real-time contextual information: location (GPS, WiFi), device posture (rooted, jailbroken, OS version), network environment (public WiFi, corporate network), biometric data (if available), time of day, user activity (app usage).
3.  **Chain Orchestrator:** Responsible for initiating and managing authentication chains. This could reside on the requesting service (e.g., application server) or a dedicated intermediary.
4.  **Dynamic Policy Evaluator (DPE):** Integrated into the Chain Orchestrator. Evaluates contextual data against policies associated with each authentication object in the chain, deciding whether to proceed to the next object or deny access.
5.  **User Interface (UI) Component:** Display of authentication object options (as in the base patent) with added indicators for chain status (e.g., "Step 1 of 3") and contextual policy prompts (e.g., "Confirm location for access").

**Workflow:**

1.  A user attempts to access a protected resource.
2.  The Chain Orchestrator initiates an authentication chain based on the resource’s security requirements.
3.  The UI presents the first authentication object to the user (e.g., a drag-and-drop selection).
4.  User selects the object.
5.  The CDA gathers contextual data.
6.  The DPE evaluates the contextual data against policies associated with the *current* authentication object.
    *   If the policies are met, the process continues to the next object in the chain (back to step 3).
    *   If policies are *not* met, the DPE can:
        *   Deny access.
        *   Present a policy-based prompt to the user (e.g., “Access from public WiFi is restricted. Confirm corporate VPN connection.”).
        *   Request additional authentication factors (e.g., biometric scan, OTP).
7.  Chain completion signals successful authentication, granting access.

**Pseudocode (Chain Orchestrator):**

```
function authenticate(resource, user):
  chain = get_authentication_chain(resource)
  if chain is null:
    deny_access()
    return

  for object in chain:
    context = get_user_context(user)
    policy_result = evaluate_policy(object.policy, context)

    if policy_result == FAIL:
      if object.requires_user_prompt:
        prompt_user(object.prompt_message)
        if user_response == DENY:
          deny_access()
          return
      else:
        deny_access()
        return

    if object.requires_additional_factor:
      additional_factor_result = get_additional_factor(object.factor_type)
      if additional_factor_result == FAIL:
        deny_access()
        return

  grant_access()
```

**Authentication Object Data Structure:**

```
{
  "object_id": "unique identifier",
  "name": "human-readable name",
  "credentials": { ... },
  "policy": {
    "location": { "allowed_networks": ["corporate_wifi"], "denied_locations": ["unknown_wifi"] },
    "device": { "os_version": ">=10", "rooted": false },
    "time": { "allowed_hours": [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] },
    "risk_score": { "threshold": 50 }
  },
  "requires_additional_factor": true,
  "factor_type": "biometric",
  "requires_user_prompt": false,
  "prompt_message": "Confirm your location for access."
}
```

**Novelty:**  The combination of chained authentication, real-time contextual policy enforcement *within* the authentication flow, and the dynamic adaptation of the authentication process based on changing conditions (device, location, time) surpasses existing methods. This moves beyond simple authentication to a continuous risk assessment and adaptive access control system.
