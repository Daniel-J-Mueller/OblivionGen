## Adaptive Payload Fragmentation & Reassembly with Predictive Congestion Avoidance

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**  Extend the multipath encapsulation concept by introducing *dynamic* payload fragmentation and reassembly coupled with a predictive congestion avoidance system. Instead of simply distributing packets across paths based on header manipulation, break down larger payloads into smaller, independent fragments *before* encapsulation.  These fragments are then distributed across available network paths.  The system predicts congestion *before* it occurs and proactively adjusts fragmentation size and path selection for subsequent fragments.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Fragmentation Engine (FE):** Resides at the source host. Responsible for splitting large payloads into fragments.  Fragmentation size is *adaptive*, influenced by the Predictive Congestion Engine (PCE).
*   **Encapsulation Module (EM):** As described in the base patent – encapsulates fragments with path-balancing data.
*   **Predictive Congestion Engine (PCE):**  A machine learning module running at the source host. It analyzes real-time network metrics (latency, packet loss, bandwidth utilization – gleaned from network interfaces or passively monitored) *and* historical data to predict congestion on each available path.  Output is a “congestion score” for each path.
*   **Path Selection Algorithm (PSA):**  Uses congestion scores from PCE and current path load to select the optimal path for each fragment.  Prioritizes paths with lower congestion.  The PSA is integral to the FE.
*   **Reassembly Buffer (RB):** Resides at the destination host. Buffers incoming fragments.
*   **Reassembly Engine (RE):**  Reconstructs the original payload from the received fragments. Utilizes sequence numbers embedded within the fragment headers to ensure correct ordering.

**III. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Payload Initiation:** A large payload is generated by the source application.
2.  **Fragmentation & Path Selection:** The FE divides the payload into fragments. The PSA, guided by the PCE's congestion predictions, assigns each fragment to a specific network path.
3.  **Encapsulation & Transmission:**  The EM encapsulates each fragment with the appropriate path-balancing information and transmits it via the assigned network path.
4.  **Reception & Buffering:**  The destination host receives the encapsulated fragments and stores them in the RB.
5.  **Reassembly:** The RE reassembles the fragments into the original payload based on the sequence numbers.
6.  **Congestion Feedback:**  The PCE monitors network performance (e.g., RTT, packet loss) *after* each fragment transmission. This feedback loop refines the PCE’s predictive model, improving future path selection.

**IV. Pseudocode (PCE - Simplified):**

```
// PCE Data Structures
path_congestion_score[path_id] = initial_score;
historical_path_data[path_id][timestamp] = {RTT, packet_loss, bandwidth};

// PCE Update Function (called after each fragment transmission)
function update_pce(path_id, RTT, packet_loss) {
  // Update historical data
  historical_path_data[path_id][current_timestamp] = {RTT, packet_loss};

  // Calculate congestion score (simplified)
  congestion_score = (RTT * weight_RTT) + (packet_loss * weight_loss);

  // Apply moving average for smoothing
  path_congestion_score[path_id] = (path_congestion_score[path_id] * smoothing_factor) + (congestion_score * (1 - smoothing_factor));
}

// PCE Prediction Function (called by Path Selection Algorithm)
function predict_congestion(path_id) {
  return path_congestion_score[path_id];
}
```

**V. Adaptations & Enhancements:**

*   **Fragment Size Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjust fragment size based on predicted congestion. Smaller fragments for congested paths, larger fragments for uncongested paths.
*   **Prioritization:** Assign priorities to fragments based on application requirements.  Time-sensitive fragments can be routed through less congested paths even if it means higher cost.
*   **Loss Detection & Retransmission:** Implement a lightweight loss detection mechanism (e.g., selective acknowledgment) and retransmit lost fragments.
*   **Cross-Path Congestion Awareness:** Extend the PCE to consider *correlated* congestion across multiple paths.

**VI. Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved network throughput and reduced latency.
*   Enhanced resilience to network congestion and failures.
*   Greater flexibility and control over network traffic.
*   Optimized bandwidth utilization.
