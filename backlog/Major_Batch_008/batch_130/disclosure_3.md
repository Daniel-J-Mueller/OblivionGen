## Dynamic Segment Importance & Adaptive Resolution

**Concept:** Instead of treating all segments of a network page equally, prioritize segments based on their visual prominence and content type, dynamically adjusting the resolution used for comparison. This reduces computational load and improves the accuracy of change detection, particularly on complex, content-rich pages.

**Specs:**

*   **Visual Prominence Engine:**
    *   Input: Segment image data.
    *   Processing:
        *   **Saliency Map Generation:** Employ a deep learning model (e.g., a CNN trained on eye-tracking data) to generate a saliency map for each segment, identifying areas likely to attract human attention.
        *   **Content Type Classification:** Utilize image recognition to classify segment content (e.g., text, image, button, video).
        *   **Importance Score Calculation:** Combine saliency map scores, content type weights (e.g., text > button > image background), and segment size to generate an importance score for each segment.
*   **Adaptive Resolution Control:**
    *   Input: Segment importance score.
    *   Processing:
        *   **Resolution Tier Assignment:** Map importance scores to resolution tiers (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
        *   **Downsampling/Upsampling:** Dynamically resize segments based on their assigned resolution tier. High-importance segments remain at full resolution. Medium and low-importance segments are downsampled to reduce processing time. Optionally, upsampling could be used on minor changes to emphasize them.
*   **Comparison Engine Integration:**
    *   The adaptive resolution control module sits *before* the pixel-by-pixel comparison stage.
    *   The comparison engine receives segments with dynamically adjusted resolutions.
    *   Thresholds for pixel differences should be *scaled* based on the segment's original resolution to maintain consistent accuracy.
*   **Machine Learning Refinement:**
    *   Continuously monitor false positive/negative rates for each segment type and resolution tier.
    *   Employ reinforcement learning to fine-tune the importance score calculation and resolution tier assignment algorithms over time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each segment in the image
segment_importance = CalculateSegmentImportance(segment)
resolution_tier = AssignResolutionTier(segment_importance)
resized_segment = ResizeSegment(segment, resolution_tier)

comparison_result = ComparePixels(resized_segment, reference_segment)

// Scale threshold based on original resolution
adjusted_threshold = threshold * (original_resolution / current_resolution)

if comparison_result > adjusted_threshold:
    report_change()
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Computational Cost:** Downsampling less important segments significantly reduces processing time.
*   **Improved Accuracy:** By focusing on visually prominent areas, the system is less likely to be distracted by minor changes in irrelevant areas.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** Allows for efficient comparison of complex, content-rich web pages.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The machine learning component enables the system to continuously improve its performance over time.
