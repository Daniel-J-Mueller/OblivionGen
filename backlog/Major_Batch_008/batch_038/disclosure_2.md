## Context-Aware Haptic Feedback System

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend contextual keyword activation to trigger *localized haptic feedback* on a wearable device (e.g., smart watch, wristband, glove). The system learns associations between keywords, contexts (applications running, detected environment – indoor/outdoor, user activity), and specific haptic patterns.

**II. Hardware Components:**

*   **Wearable Device:**  Includes a haptic actuator array capable of generating a wide range of vibration patterns, textures, and intensities.  Minimum 32 actuators distributed across the surface contacting the skin.
*   **Audio Input:** Integrated microphone or connection to a mobile device's microphone.
*   **Processing Unit:**  Low-power processor capable of running speech recognition and pattern matching algorithms.  Ideally integrated into the wearable or paired with a mobile device.
*   **Wireless Communication:**  Bluetooth or similar for communication with a host device (smartphone, computer).

**III. Software Modules:**

1.  **Speech Recognition Engine:**  Accurate, low-latency speech recognition capable of operating in noisy environments.
2.  **Contextual Awareness Module:**  Monitors running applications, sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS), and environmental information (ambient light, sound level).
3.  **Haptic Pattern Database:** Stores pre-defined and user-customizable haptic patterns. Patterns are defined by actuator activation sequences, intensity levels, and durations.  Includes a 'pattern editor' for user creation.
4.  **Association Learning Engine:**  Utilizes machine learning (reinforcement learning is ideal) to learn associations between keywords, contexts, and haptic patterns.
5.  **Haptic Control Module:**  Translates the selected haptic pattern into actuator control signals.

**IV. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Setup:** User associates keywords with desired haptic patterns and contexts.  Example: Keyword “Navigate”, Context “Maps Application”, Haptic Pattern “Directional Pulse”.
2.  **Audio Input & Speech Recognition:**  The system continuously monitors audio input and performs speech recognition.
3.  **Contextual Analysis:** The Contextual Awareness Module determines the current application, activity, and environment.
4.  **Keyword & Context Matching:** The system searches for a matching keyword and context in the learned associations.
5.  **Haptic Pattern Selection:** If a match is found, the corresponding haptic pattern is selected.
6.  **Haptic Feedback Delivery:** The Haptic Control Module activates the appropriate actuators to deliver the haptic pattern to the user’s skin.

**V. Pseudocode - Association Learning:**

```
// Data structure for associations
struct Association {
  string keyword;
  string context;
  int patternID;
  float confidence; // Confidence level of association
};

// Array to store associations
Association associations[MAX_ASSOCIATIONS];

// Function to learn a new association
void learnAssociation(string keyword, string context, int patternID) {
  // Check if association already exists
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ASSOCIATIONS; i++) {
    if (associations[i].keyword == keyword && associations[i].context == context) {
      // Increase confidence if association exists
      associations[i].confidence += LEARNING_RATE;
      return;
    }
  }

  // Find an empty slot in the array
  int emptySlot = -1;
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ASSOCIATIONS; i++) {
    if (associations[i].keyword == "" ) {
      emptySlot = i;
      break;
    }
  }

  // If no empty slot is found, return (or implement a more complex memory management system)
  if (emptySlot == -1) return;

  // Create a new association
  associations[emptySlot].keyword = keyword;
  associations[emptySlot].context = context;
  associations[emptySlot].patternID = patternID;
  associations[emptySlot].confidence = INITIAL_CONFIDENCE;
}

// Function to retrieve the best matching pattern ID
int getBestPatternID(string keyword, string context) {
    int bestPatternID = -1;
    float highestConfidence = 0.0;

    for (int i = 0; i < MAX_ASSOCIATIONS; i++) {
        if (associations[i].keyword == keyword && associations[i].context == context) {
            if (associations[i].confidence > highestConfidence) {
                highestConfidence = associations[i].confidence;
                bestPatternID = associations[i].patternID;
            }
        }
    }

    return bestPatternID;
}
```

**VI.  Novelty/Differentiation:**  This moves beyond simple audio alerts to a multi-sensory notification system. The localized haptic feedback provides discreet, contextual information *without* requiring visual or auditory attention. This is beneficial in scenarios where situational awareness is critical (e.g., driving, cycling, navigating crowded spaces). The learning aspect adapts to individual user preferences and environments, increasing usability and reducing alert fatigue.
