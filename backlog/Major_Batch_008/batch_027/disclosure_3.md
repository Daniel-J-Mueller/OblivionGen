## Dynamic Feed Personalization via Predictive User Lifetime Value

**Concept:** Extend the item feed generation beyond simple commercial performance aggregation to incorporate a predictive model of user lifetime value (LTV) derived from referral network interactions. This creates hyper-personalized feeds, maximizing long-term revenue instead of just short-term sales.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Ingestion:**
    *   Integrate with referral network sites to capture granular user interaction data: clicks, add-to-cart events, purchases *originating from the referral*, time spent viewing product details, search queries.
    *   Ingest existing e-commerce data: purchase history, browsing behavior, demographics.
    *   Capture explicit user preferences (wishlists, saved items, profile data).
*   **LTV Prediction Model:**
    *   Employ a machine learning model (e.g., regression, classification with probabilistic output) trained on historical data to predict the LTV of each user.  Features to include:
        *   Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM) of purchases.
        *   Engagement metrics from referral network interactions (clicks, views, time spent).
        *   Demographic data.
        *   Explicitly stated preferences.
        *   Propensity to engage with specific product categories.
    *   Model retraining: Implement a continuous retraining pipeline to update the model based on new data.
*   **Feed Generation Algorithm:**
    *   For each user, calculate a predicted LTV.
    *   Assign a “relevance score” to each item based on:
        *   Commercial performance data (as in the original patent).
        *   Predicted probability that the user will purchase the item (based on their LTV, browsing history, and product features).
        *   Diversity of the feed (to avoid overwhelming the user with similar items).
    *   Sort items by relevance score.
    *   Generate a personalized feed of the top N items.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:**
    *   Implement a robust A/B testing framework to evaluate the performance of the new feed generation algorithm against the baseline (original patent's approach).
    *   Metrics to track:
        *   Click-through rate.
        *   Conversion rate.
        *   Average order value.
        *   Customer lifetime value (measured over an extended period).

**Pseudocode (Feed Generation):**

```
function generatePersonalizedFeed(userId, items):
    userLTV = predictUserLTV(userId)
    itemScores = {}

    for each item in items:
        commercialPerformanceScore = calculateCommercialPerformanceScore(item)
        userPurchaseProbability = predictPurchaseProbability(userId, item, userLTV) //ML model
        diversityScore = calculateDiversityScore(item, user's viewed items) //avoiding repetition

        itemScore = (0.5 * commercialPerformanceScore) + (0.4 * userPurchaseProbability) + (0.1 * diversityScore)
        itemScores[item] = itemScore

    sortedItems = sortItemsByScore(itemScores, descending) //ML model

    return topNItems(sortedItems, 10) //Example: return the top 10 items
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Scalable cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
*   Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Data storage and processing technologies (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Cassandra).
*   Real-time data streaming platform (e.g., Kafka).
*   API integration with referral network sites and e-commerce platform.
