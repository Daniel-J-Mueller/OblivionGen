## Dynamic Resource ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Failover

**Concept:** Extend the availability group concept to include real-time ‘shadowing’ of resource performance metrics in the destination environment, coupled with a predictive failover system that proactively stages resources *before* a failure occurs, optimizing for application-specific performance. This goes beyond simply replicating data and reserves; it's about replicating *capability*.

**Specification:**

**1. Performance Metric Collection & Shadowing:**

*   **Agent Deployment:** Deploy lightweight agents within each virtual machine (VM) belonging to an availability group. These agents collect key performance indicators (KPIs) – CPU utilization, memory pressure, disk I/O, network latency, application response times, etc.
*   **Shadow VM Creation:** For each VM in the source environment, create a corresponding ‘shadow’ VM in the destination environment. These shadow VMs initially remain in a minimal state (e.g., stopped or with minimal resources allocated).
*   **Metric Mirroring:**  KPI data collected from the source VM is mirrored to its corresponding shadow VM. The shadow VM doesn't *process* the data, it simply *stores* it, building a performance profile.
*   **Historical Data Storage:** Store historical performance data for each shadow VM, allowing for trend analysis and capacity planning.

**2. Predictive Failover Engine:**

*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement an anomaly detection algorithm that analyzes the mirrored performance data. This algorithm identifies deviations from the established baseline performance profile for each shadow VM.
*   **Failure Prediction:** Based on anomaly detection, the engine predicts potential failures in the source VMs.  The prediction is weighted – minor anomalies trigger warnings, major anomalies trigger pre-emptive staging.
*   **Resource Staging:**  Upon a weighted failure prediction, the engine begins to ‘stage’ resources for the corresponding shadow VM:
    *   **Resource Allocation:** Dynamically allocate CPU, memory, and storage to the shadow VM, based on the historical performance profile and current demand.
    *   **Network Configuration:** Configure network routing to redirect traffic to the staged shadow VM.
    *   **Application Deployment:**  Deploy or pre-stage application components onto the shadow VM.  This could involve containerization (e.g., Docker) for rapid deployment.
    *   **Data Synchronization Verification:** Perform a final data synchronization check to ensure data consistency.

**3. Failover Orchestration:**

*   **Automated Switchover:**  Once staging is complete, the system automatically switches traffic to the staged shadow VM.
*   **Health Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the health of the shadow VM post-failover.
*   **Rollback Capability:** Implement a rollback mechanism to revert to the source environment if the failover is unsuccessful.
*   **Source Environment Remediation:**  Once the source environment is restored, the system automatically reverses the failover process, bringing the source environment back online.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Agent (running on Source VM)
LOOP:
  Collect KPIs (CPU, Memory, Disk I/O, Network Latency, etc.)
  Send KPIs to Destination VM's Shadow Agent

// Shadow Agent (running on Destination VM)
LOOP:
  Receive KPIs from Source VM
  Store KPIs in Historical Data Store
  Analyze KPIs for Anomalies
  IF Anomaly Detected AND Severity > Threshold:
    Trigger Resource Staging

// Resource Staging Service
FUNCTION StageResource(VMName, Severity):
  Allocate Resources (CPU, Memory, Disk)
  Configure Network Routing
  Deploy Application Components
  Verify Data Synchronization
  RETURN Success/Failure

// Failover Orchestration Service
FUNCTION InitiateFailover(VMName):
  Switch Traffic to Destination VM
  Monitor Destination VM Health
  IF Health Check Fails:
    Rollback to Source VM
  RETURN Success/Failure
```

**Novelty:** This extends availability groups beyond simple replication and reserved capacity by focusing on *proactive* resource staging based on real-time performance mirroring. It anticipates failures, rather than simply reacting to them, leading to faster recovery times and reduced downtime.  It also allows for scaling *before* the failure, preventing resource contention in the target environment.
