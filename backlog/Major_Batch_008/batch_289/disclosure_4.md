## Adaptive Schema Evolution via Change Log "Shadowing"

**Concept:** Extend the change log mechanism to not just *record* changes, but to facilitate *live* schema evolution and A/B testing of schema modifications without downtime or data migration. We call this "Change Log Shadowing".

**Specification:**

**1. Shadow Table Creation:**

*   Upon receiving a DDL statement (e.g., `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE`), the head node *doesn't* immediately apply it to the primary tables.
*   Instead, it creates a “shadow table” – a fully functional duplicate of the target table, but populated *only* with changes recorded in the change logs since a designated "shadow start time."
*   The shadow table’s schema reflects the *proposed* DDL change.
*   Metadata associates the shadow table with the original table and the triggering DDL statement.  This metadata includes a 'validation status' (initially 'pending').

**2. Change Log Redirection:**

*   For a configurable period, *both* the primary table and the shadow table receive change log records.
*   The head node intercepts INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.
*   It applies the statement to *both* tables. This ensures full data consistency during validation.
*   A flag indicates which table is the 'primary' and which is the 'shadow'.

**3. Validation & Comparison:**

*   A dedicated “validation engine” (separate process or service) continuously compares the data in the primary and shadow tables.
*   The comparison can use various methods:
    *   **Full Table Scan:**  Simple but resource-intensive.
    *   **Checksums/Hashing:** Generate checksums for data subsets and compare.
    *   **Data Sampling:**  Compare a statistically significant sample of records.
    *   **Query-Based Validation:** Run specific queries against both tables and compare the results.
*   The validation engine reports any discrepancies. Discrepancies should be categorized (data type mismatch, constraint violation, etc.).

**4. Schema Promotion/Rollback:**

*   If validation passes (no critical discrepancies), the head node initiates a coordinated switch:
    *   A brief maintenance window is required.
    *   Write operations are paused.
    *   The primary and shadow tables are swapped (metadata update).
    *   Write operations are resumed.
*   If validation fails, the shadow table is discarded, and the original schema remains unchanged.  The DDL statement is flagged for review.

**5.  A/B Testing Integration:**

*   The system can support multiple shadow tables for A/B testing different schema variations.
*   Routing rules (based on user ID, region, etc.) direct a percentage of traffic to each shadow table.
*   Performance metrics (query latency, resource utilization) are monitored for each variation.
*   The winning variation is promoted using the schema promotion process.

**Pseudocode (Schema Promotion):**

```
function promoteSchema(primaryTableId, shadowTableId) {
  pauseWrites(); // Prevent new writes to primary/shadow

  // Metadata Update (atomic operation)
  swap(primaryTableId, shadowTableId); // Swap primary/shadow table IDs in metadata

  resumeWrites(); // Allow writes to the new primary table (formerly shadow)

  // Optional: Drop the old shadow table
  dropTable(oldShadowTableId);
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Table Metadata:**  `{tableId, schemaDefinition, primary/shadow flag, associatedDdlStatement, validationStatus}`
*   **Change Log:** (Existing structure, enhanced with `shadowTableId` to indicate which table the change applied to)
*   **Validation Report:** `{tableId, timestamp, discrepancies: [ {type, message, recordId} ] }`
