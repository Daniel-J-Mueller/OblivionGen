## Dynamic Network Topology Reconstruction via Predictive Scripting

**Specification:** A system for proactive network reconfiguration based on predictive analysis of script execution impact and dynamic topology mapping.

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing script-based automation to include a ‘shadow network’ – a real-time, predictive model of the network state *before* script execution. This allows for testing changes in a simulated environment before live deployment, and enables automated rollback based on predicted impact.

**Components:**

1.  **Topology Mapper:** Continuously monitors network device states (using SNMP, NetFlow, etc.) and constructs a dynamic graph representing the network topology. This graph includes device relationships, bandwidth usage, latency metrics, and operational status.

2.  **Script Analyzer:** Parses each configuration update script, identifying dependencies on specific network devices and potential impact on network topology. This analysis goes beyond simple device identification; it models the likely *change* to network behavior (e.g., rerouting traffic, increasing bandwidth allocation).

3.  **Shadow Network Simulator:**  A virtualized instance of the network, mirroring the live environment. This simulator receives the parsed script from the Script Analyzer and executes it against the simulated network.  Crucially, it *predicts* the resulting network state changes based on the script’s impact analysis.

4.  **Impact Predictor:** Uses machine learning models (trained on historical network data) to evaluate the simulated network state changes.  It predicts key performance indicators (KPIs) like latency, throughput, packet loss, and resource utilization.  The predictor assigns a ‘risk score’ to the script based on its predicted impact.

5.  **Automated Rollback Engine:**  If the Impact Predictor’s risk score exceeds a pre-defined threshold, the rollback engine automatically generates a compensating script to revert the changes *before* they are applied to the live network. Alternatively, the engine can propose a revised script with reduced impact.

**Pseudocode (Rollback Engine):**

```
function analyze_script(script):
  topology_map = get_current_topology()
  simulated_topology = apply_script_to_simulation(topology_map, script)
  risk_score = predict_impact(simulated_topology)

  if risk_score > threshold:
    rollback_script = generate_rollback_script(script)
    return rollback_script
  else:
    return null

function generate_rollback_script(script):
  // Analyze script to identify changes
  changes = extract_changes(script)

  // Generate compensating changes to revert
  rollback_changes = generate_compensating_changes(changes)

  // Construct rollback script
  rollback_script = construct_script(rollback_changes)

  return rollback_script
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Network Graph:**  Node (Device ID, Device Type, IP Address, Status)  Edge (Source Device ID, Destination Device ID, Bandwidth, Latency)
*   **Script Metadata:** Script ID, Script Name, Script Version, Dependencies, Affected Devices, Risk Score, Rollback Script ID.
*   **KPIs:** Latency (ms), Throughput (Mbps), Packet Loss (%), CPU Utilization (%), Memory Utilization (%).

**Enhancements:**

*   **A/B Testing:**  Apply scripts to a small subset of the network (A/B group) before full deployment.
*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the live network after script deployment to validate predicted performance.
*   **Automated Script Optimization:**  Use machine learning to automatically optimize scripts for minimal impact.
*   **Integration with network analytics tools:** correlate simulation results with historical data to improve predictive accuracy.
