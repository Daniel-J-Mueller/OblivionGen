## Adaptive Audio Masking for Enhanced Privacy

**Core Concept:** Extend the principle of selectively silencing audio transmission during wakeword detection to proactively mask sensitive content within continuous audio streams, adapting to environmental noise and user preferences.

**Specifications:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Primary Device:** Wireless earbud with multi-microphone array, onboard processing (DSP/NPU), wireless communication (Bluetooth, UWB), and user interface (touch/voice).
*   **Secondary Device:**  Optional - secondary earbud or external audio output device (speaker).
*   **Mobile Device:** Smartphone/tablet acting as a data source and control hub.
*   **Privacy Profile Server:** Cloud-based server for storing and managing user privacy preferences and dynamic masking algorithms.

**2. Operational Modes:**

*   **Real-time Masking:** Continuous audio analysis for sensitive keywords, phrases, or patterns. Upon detection, audio is selectively masked *before* transmission to other devices or the cloud.
*   **Contextual Masking:** Utilizes sensor data (location, activity, ambient sound) to anticipate potentially sensitive conversations. Example: Entering a medical facility triggers heightened masking.
*   **Adaptive Masking:** Adjusts masking intensity based on environmental noise. Louder environments allow for more aggressive masking, while quieter environments require subtler techniques.

**3. Masking Techniques:**

*   **Frequency Shifting:** Alters the frequency range of sensitive audio, rendering it unintelligible to eavesdroppers while remaining understandable to the user.
*   **Phase Inversion:** Inverts the phase of sensitive audio segments, effectively canceling them out during wireless transmission.
*   **Noise Injection:** Adds subtle, randomized noise to sensitive audio, obscuring its content without significantly impacting user experience.  The noise profile adapts to ambient sound.
*   **Synthetic Audio Replacement:** Replace sensitive audio with non-sensitive synthetic audio of equivalent duration and cadence.  (E.g. replace a credit card number with a randomized sequence of syllables).

**4.  Pseudocode - Real-time Masking Engine (Primary Device)**

```
// Audio Input from Microphones
audio_stream = get_audio_input()

// Feature Extraction (Keyword Spotting, Voice Recognition)
features = extract_features(audio_stream)

// Privacy Profile Retrieval (User Preferences, Sensitivity Levels)
privacy_profile = get_privacy_profile()

// Sensitivity Level Check
if privacy_profile.sensitivity_level > 0:
  // Keyword/Phrase Detection
  sensitive_content_detected = detect_sensitive_content(features, privacy_profile.keywords)

  if sensitive_content_detected:
    // Masking Algorithm Selection (Based on Privacy Profile and Environment)
    masking_algorithm = select_masking_algorithm(privacy_profile, ambient_noise_level)

    // Apply Masking Algorithm to Audio Stream
    masked_audio_stream = apply_masking_algorithm(audio_stream, masking_algorithm)
  else:
    masked_audio_stream = audio_stream

// Send Masked Audio Stream to Secondary Device and/or Mobile Device
transmit_audio(masked_audio_stream)
```

**5.  Dynamic Masking Algorithm Optimization**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Employ reinforcement learning to optimize masking algorithms based on user feedback (e.g., clarity of audio, perceived privacy level).
*   **Federated Learning:** Leverage federated learning to train masking models on anonymized user data without compromising individual privacy.
*   **UWB Integration:** Utilize Ultra-Wideband (UWB) technology for secure, low-latency audio transmission between primary and secondary devices, minimizing the risk of interception.

**6.  User Interface Considerations**

*   **Privacy Level Control:**  Allow users to adjust the sensitivity of the masking system (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
*   **Keyword/Phrase Management:** Enable users to add or remove keywords/phrases from the sensitive content detection list.
*   **Masking Algorithm Selection:** Provide options for selecting different masking algorithms based on user preference.
*   **Real-time Privacy Indicator:** Display a visual indicator showing the current privacy level (e.g., a colored icon).
