## Adaptive Cache Tiering with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Extend the independent eviction strategy to incorporate a multi-tiered cache system, dynamically adjusting tier assignment based on predicted access patterns. This aims to reduce latency and improve hit rates by proactively moving frequently accessed data to faster tiers.

**Specifications:**

**1. Cache Tier Definitions:**

*   **Tier 0: Ultra-Fast Cache:**  Small, low-latency storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs, persistent memory) – Highest cost per GB.
*   **Tier 1: Fast Cache:** Moderate size, moderate latency (e.g., DRAM, SSD) – Medium cost per GB.
*   **Tier 2: Bulk Cache:** Large capacity, higher latency (e.g., HDD, object storage) – Lowest cost per GB.

**2. Data Item Metadata:**

Each cached data item will be associated with the following metadata:

*   `access_timestamp`:  Last access time.
*   `access_count`: Number of times accessed.
*   `predicted_access_score`:  A dynamically calculated score indicating the likelihood of future access (see section 4).
*   `current_tier`:  The current tier where the data item is stored (0, 1, or 2).

**3. Tier Assignment Logic:**

*   **Initial Assignment:** New data items are initially placed in Tier 1.
*   **Promotion:** If a data item's `predicted_access_score` exceeds a promotion threshold, it is moved from Tier 1 to Tier 0.  If already in Tier 0, it remains.
*   **Demotion:** If a data item's `predicted_access_score` falls below a demotion threshold, it is moved from Tier 0 to Tier 1 or from Tier 1 to Tier 2.  The demotion target tier is determined by the score relative to both thresholds.
*   **Eviction:** When eviction is required within a tier, the Least Frequently Used (LFU) algorithm is applied.

**4. Predictive Access Score Calculation:**

The `predicted_access_score` is calculated using a weighted moving average incorporating:

*   **Recency:**  A higher weight is given to recent accesses.
*   **Frequency:**  The number of accesses within a defined time window.
*   **Pattern Recognition:**  Analysis of access patterns based on historical data (e.g., time-of-day, weekday, correlated data access).  This can be implemented using a simple Markov model or more complex machine learning techniques.

    Pseudocode:

    ```
    predicted_access_score = (
        recency_weight * recency_score +
        frequency_weight * frequency_score +
        pattern_weight * pattern_score
    )
    ```

**5.  Independent Eviction with Tier Awareness:**

*   When a query accelerator node evicts data, it considers the current tier of the data item.
*   Evicting data from Tier 0 is avoided unless absolutely necessary.
*   If eviction from Tier 0 is required, the system attempts to proactively prefetch the data item to another node before removal.

**6.  System Components:**

*   **Tier Manager:** Responsible for monitoring cache usage, calculating predicted access scores, and managing data movement between tiers.
*   **Prefetcher:** Proactively fetches data items to improve hit rates and reduce latency.
*   **Cache Nodes:** Individual query accelerator nodes with multi-tiered storage.

**7.  API Considerations:**

*   The Tier Manager provides APIs for:
    *   Monitoring cache performance.
    *   Configuring tier thresholds and weights.
    *   Debugging cache behavior.
