## Adaptive Skill Chaining with Predictive Disambiguation

**Concept:** Expand the disambiguation process beyond simple two-skill selection to dynamically chain multiple skills based on predicted user intent and confidence scores. This goes beyond resolving ambiguity to proactively anticipating multi-step tasks.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Intent Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Raw natural language input, NLU results (intent, entities).
    *   Process: Employ a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on a dataset of multi-skill task sequences. This model predicts the probability of various skill sequences following the initial user input.
    *   Output: Ranked list of potential skill sequences with associated confidence scores.

2.  **Dynamic Skill Graph:**
    *   Representation: A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent skills, and edges represent potential transitions between skills based on successful execution and data passed between them.
    *   Maintenance: The graph is dynamically updated based on user interactions and usage patterns.  Edges are weighted based on frequency of use and success rate.

3.  **Confidence-Based Chaining:**
    *   Process:
        *   Initial Input: User provides natural language input.
        *   Skill Evaluation: The system evaluates multiple skills based on the initial input, producing confidence scores (as in the original patent).
        *   Sequence Proposal: The Intent Prediction Module proposes multiple skill sequences based on the initial input and the Dynamic Skill Graph.
        *   Combined Scoring: Confidence scores from individual skill evaluation are combined with sequence proposal probabilities to generate an overall confidence score for each potential skill chain.
        *   Thresholding: A dynamic threshold is applied to the overall confidence score. If no chain exceeds the threshold, disambiguation is initiated (as in the original patent).
    *   Pseudocode:
        ```
        function evaluate_skill_chain(input, skill_chain):
            chain_confidence = 1.0
            for skill in skill_chain:
                skill_confidence = evaluate_skill(input, skill)
                chain_confidence *= skill_confidence
            return chain_confidence

        function find_best_skill_chain(input):
            possible_chains = generate_possible_chains(input)  // From Intent Prediction Module
            best_chain = null
            highest_confidence = 0.0

            for chain in possible_chains:
                confidence = evaluate_skill_chain(input, chain)
                if confidence > highest_confidence:
                    highest_confidence = confidence
                    best_chain = chain

            return best_chain, highest_confidence

        if highest_confidence > confidence_threshold:
            execute_skill_chain(best_chain)
        else:
            initiate_disambiguation()
        ```

4.  **Proactive Disambiguation:**
    *   If confidence falls below the threshold, instead of a simple yes/no question, the system asks a question *targeted at predicting the next skill in the most likely chain*.  For example, if the system thinks the user is likely to book a flight *and then* a hotel, it might ask, “Are you planning to book accommodations as well?”
    *   This allows for more efficient disambiguation and proactively guides the user toward completing multi-step tasks.

5.  **User Model Integration:**
    *   The Dynamic Skill Graph and confidence thresholds are personalized based on the user’s history and preferences.
    *   Frequent skill sequences for a user are given higher priority and lower disambiguation thresholds.

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance compute infrastructure for training and running the Intent Prediction Module.
*   Scalable data storage for the Dynamic Skill Graph and user models.
*   Real-time speech processing and NLU engine.
*   API for integrating with various skill systems.
