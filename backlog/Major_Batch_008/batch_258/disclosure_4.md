## Modular, Bio-Integrated Scanner Pedestal

**Concept:** A pedestal scanner that isn’t static, but actively adapts its form and functionality via bio-integrated materials and modular components. The pedestal "grows" or reconfigures itself based on scanning needs and environmental factors.

**Materials:**

*   **Base:** Mycelium composite – Provides a self-healing, biodegradable base structure. Grown *in situ* around a temporary support structure.
*   **Sensor Housing:** Bio-luminescent algae/bacterial colonies encapsulated in a transparent, flexible polymer. The intensity of bioluminescence correlates with scan data, offering a visual feedback layer.
*   **Articulation:** Shape memory alloys (SMA) interwoven with the mycelium composite, allowing for dynamic adjustments to pedestal height and scanner angle. Controlled by low-voltage electrical signals.
*   **Surface:**  Electro-active polymers (EAP) covering the exterior. These can change color, texture, or rigidity based on user input or scan data.
*   **Internal Structure:** 3D-printed, biodegradable polymer scaffolding for initial growth and support, dissolving as mycelium takes over.

**Functionality:**

*   **Adaptive Height & Angle:** SMA actuation adjusts pedestal height and scanner angle for optimal scanning of objects or individuals of varying size/position. Controlled via user interface (voice, gesture, or app).
*   **Bio-Luminescent Feedback:** Scan data (e.g., density, composition) is mapped to bioluminescence intensity, creating a visual “aura” around the scanned object.  Different materials/densities trigger different bioluminescent colors.
*   **Morphing Surface:** EAP surface can “grip” objects for stable scanning, change texture for improved sensor contact, or display interactive information (e.g., scan progress, identified objects).
*   **Self-Repair:** Mycelium composite base has limited self-healing capabilities, repairing minor damage (scratches, small cracks).
*   **Environmental Integration:**  Pedestal can incorporate small-scale hydroponic systems within its base, using waste heat from the scanner to support plant growth, creating a "living" pedestal.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control System):**

```
// Inputs:
//  object_height: Estimated height of object being scanned (from distance sensors)
//  scan_density: Density of object being scanned (from scanner data)
//  user_preference_height: User-defined preferred pedestal height

// Outputs:
//  pedestal_height: Target height of pedestal
//  scanner_angle: Target angle of scanner
//  bioluminescence_color: Color of bioluminescence
//  surface_texture: Texture of EAP surface

function control_system(object_height, scan_density, user_preference_height) {

  // Calculate optimal pedestal height
  pedestal_height = max(object_height * 0.8, user_preference_height);

  // Adjust scanner angle based on object height
  scanner_angle = atan(object_height / pedestal_height);

  // Map scan density to bioluminescence color
  if (scan_density > 0.9) {
    bioluminescence_color = "bright blue";
  } else if (scan_density > 0.5) {
    bioluminescence_color = "green";
  } else {
    bioluminescence_color = "red";
  }

  // Adjust surface texture based on scan data
  if (scan_data contains “fragile”) {
    surface_texture = “soft, cushioning”;
  } else {
    surface_texture = “firm, grippy”;
  }

  return [pedestal_height, scanner_angle, bioluminescence_color, surface_texture];
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Nutrient supply for mycelium growth (automatic dispensing system).
*   Water management for hydroponics.
*   Electrical power delivery to actuators and sensors.
*   Containment of bio-luminescent materials.
*   Thermal management (waste heat dissipation or utilization).
*   Biodegradability and lifecycle management of components.
