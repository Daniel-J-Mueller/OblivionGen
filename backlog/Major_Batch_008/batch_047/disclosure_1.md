## Dynamic Information Overlay System - "Aura"

**Concept:** Extend the core functionality of selectively revealing restricted information to authorized users, but instead of solely modifying UI elements *within* the presented content, create a dynamic, interactive "Aura" that exists *around* the presented information, accessible via gesture or gaze control. This Aura would contain layers of contextual information, analytics, and tools, tailored to the user’s authorization level.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a device with a front-facing camera (AR glasses, laptop webcam, tablet camera) and gesture/gaze tracking capabilities. Minimal processing requirements – core logic handled remotely.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Content Analyzer:**  Identifies key entities (people, places, products, dates) within the presented information (webpage, document, presentation).
    *   **Authorization Manager:** Integrates with existing authentication systems to determine user permissions.
    *   **Aura Generator:** Creates a layered, interactive visual overlay surrounding the presented content.
    *   **Gesture/Gaze Interpreter:**  Translates user gestures/gaze into commands to interact with the Aura.
    *   **Data Connector:**  Accesses and retrieves restricted data from internal systems based on user authorization and identified entities.

*   **Aura Layers (examples, configurable):**
    *   **Restricted Data Panel:** Displays confidential information related to entities identified in the presented content. (e.g. for a product, show internal cost data, sales forecasts, margin information.)
    *   **Relationship Graph:** Visualizes connections between entities. (e.g., shows the relationships between people mentioned in a document, or supply chain connections for a product.)
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Displays real-time sentiment data about entities based on internal and external sources.
    *   **Action Panel:**  Provides authorized users with direct access to internal systems to perform actions related to entities (e.g., update inventory, approve a purchase order, contact a sales representative).

*   **Interaction Model:**
    *   User gazes or gestures towards an entity in the presented content.
    *   The system highlights the entity and displays a mini-menu indicating available Aura layers.
    *   User selects a layer to view information or perform an action.
    *   Information is displayed within the Aura, without obscuring the original content.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (userIsPresent) {
    content = CapturePresentedContent();
    entities = ContentAnalyzer(content);
    authorizedEntities = FilterEntitiesByUserAuthorization(entities, currentUser);

    for (entity in authorizedEntities) {
        //Highlight entity based on user gaze/gesture
        if (userIsFocusingOn(entity)) {
            auraLayers = GetAvailableAuraLayers(entity, currentUser);
            DisplayAuraLayers(auraLayers);

            if (userSelectsAuraLayer(layer)) {
                data = GetDataFromInternalSystems(layer, entity);
                DisplayDataInAura(data);

                if (userInitiatesAction(action)) {
                   ExecuteAction(action, entity);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Predictive Aura:**  Proactively displays relevant Aura layers based on user behavior and content analysis.
*   **Collaborative Aura:** Allows authorized users to share and annotate Aura layers in real-time.
*   **Holographic Projection:** Projects the Aura as a holographic overlay onto the physical environment.
