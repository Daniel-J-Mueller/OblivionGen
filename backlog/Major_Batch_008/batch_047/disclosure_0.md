## Adaptive Encryption with Dynamic Integrity Zones

**Concept:** Extend the integrity verification beyond a single "information to verify validity" value to a system of dynamic, granular integrity zones *within* the encrypted data itself. These zones aren't fixed; their size and content are determined by the data type and sensitivity, adjusted *during* encryption, and verified upon decryption.

**Specs:**

*   **Zone Definition Table (ZDT):** A data structure generated *prior* to encryption. This table maps data types (e.g., image header, financial transaction amount, user profile field) to:
    *   Zone Size (in bytes)
    *   Zone Sensitivity Level (Low, Medium, High – impacts hash algorithm strength & frequency)
    *   Hash Algorithm (SHA-256, BLAKE3, etc. – selectable per sensitivity)
    *   Zone Redundancy Factor (number of independent hashes per zone – for fault tolerance)
*   **Encryption Process:**
    1.  Data is segmented according to the ZDT.
    2.  For each segment (zone):
        *   Calculate the specified number of hashes using the specified algorithm.
        *   Interweave these hashes *within* the encrypted data stream itself, at pre-defined locations determined by the ZDT.  This ensures the hashes travel with the data.
        *   Encrypt the combined data + hashes using a symmetric key.
*   **Decryption & Verification Process:**
    1.  Decrypt the data stream.
    2.  Extract the interwoven hashes according to the ZDT.
    3.  Recalculate hashes for each zone using the original data and the algorithm specified in the ZDT.
    4.  Compare the extracted and recalculated hashes.  A mismatch in *any* zone indicates data corruption or tampering.
    5.  Implement a tiered response system based on the sensitivity level of the compromised zone.  Low sensitivity zones might trigger a warning, medium zones might require re-download, and high sensitivity zones could trigger system lockdown.

**Pseudocode (Encryption):**

```
function encryptData(data, key, zdt):
  encryptedData = ""
  for zone in zdt:
    zoneData = data.slice(zone.start, zone.end)
    hashes = calculateHashes(zoneData, zone.hashAlgorithm, zone.redundancyFactor)
    interwovenData = interweave(zoneData, hashes) // places hashes at pre-defined locations
    encryptedZone = encrypt(interwovenData, key)
    encryptedData += encryptedZone
  return encryptedData

function interweave(data, hashes):
  // Implementation to insert hashes within data at specified offsets.
  // Offset information is defined in the ZDT.
  ...
```

**Pseudocode (Decryption & Verification):**

```
function decryptAndVerify(ciphertext, key, zdt):
  decryptedData = decrypt(ciphertext, key)
  verificationResults = []
  for zone in zdt:
    extractedHashes = extractHashes(decryptedData, zone)
    recalculatedHashes = calculateHashes(decryptedData.slice(zone.start, zone.end), zone.hashAlgorithm, zone.redundancyFactor)
    match = compareHashes(extractedHashes, recalculatedHashes)
    verificationResults.append({"zone": zone.name, "match": match})

  return verificationResults
```

**Novelty:** Current integrity verification focuses on a single hash for the entire data. This proposes a dynamic, granular approach tailored to data types and sensitivity, enhancing security and enabling more targeted responses to data corruption. It’s also designed with resilience in mind using the redundancy factor and the tiered response system.
