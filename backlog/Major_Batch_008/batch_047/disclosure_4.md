## Dynamic Event-Driven Narrative Generation – “Choreography AI”

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply compiling detected events into a stream. Instead, leverage the detected events *as triggers* for an AI-driven narrative engine which dynamically orchestrates pre-authored (but modular) media – video clips, audio cues, graphic overlays, and even synthesized “virtual” actors – to create a richer, more emotionally resonant experience. Think of it as a real-time, event-driven director.

**Inspiration:** The patent’s focus on detecting events and generating context.  This takes it a step further – using the *meaning* of those events to drive a creative output.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Event Abstraction Layer:** A module to categorize detected events beyond simple labels. (e.g., “Player scores” isn’t just “score”, but “positive momentum,” “climax”, “turning point”).  This uses probabilistic reasoning based on historical data and pre-defined event “signatures”.
*   **Narrative Graph Database:** A knowledge graph storing modular media assets (clips, audio, graphics). Each asset is tagged with “emotional valence” (positive, negative, neutral), “intensity”, and “event triggers” (links to Event Abstraction Layer outputs).  Assets may also have “conditional logic” (e.g., “if player is leading by >10 points, play celebratory music”).
*   **AI Director Engine:**  The core component. This engine:
    *   Receives event data from the Event Abstraction Layer.
    *   Queries the Narrative Graph Database for matching assets based on event type, emotional valence, and intensity.
    *   Evaluates conditional logic within assets.
    *   Orchestrates the selected assets into a cohesive sequence, applying transitions, mixing audio, and layering graphics.
    *   Adapts the narrative in real-time based on ongoing event streams.
*   **User Profile Integration:** Allows customization of narrative style and asset selection based on user preferences (e.g., “more emphasis on dramatic moments,” “less use of music”).
*   **Output Module:** Transmits the dynamically generated narrative stream (video, audio, graphics) to various display devices.

**Pseudocode (AI Director Engine):**

```
function generate_narrative(event_stream, user_profile) {
  narrative_sequence = []
  current_emotional_state = neutral

  for each event in event_stream {
    event_type = event.type
    event_intensity = event.intensity
    event_emotional_valence = event.emotional_valence

    // Query narrative graph for matching assets
    matching_assets = query_graph(event_type, event_intensity, event_emotional_valence, user_profile)

    // Select asset based on current emotional state & randomness
    selected_asset = choose_asset(matching_assets, current_emotional_state)

    // Apply transitions and mixing
    edited_asset = apply_transitions(selected_asset, previous_asset)
    mixed_audio = mix_audio(edited_asset.audio, previous_audio)

    // Update emotional state
    current_emotional_state = calculate_new_state(current_emotional_state, event_emotional_valence)

    narrative_sequence.append(edited_asset)
    previous_asset = edited_asset
    previous_audio = mixed_audio
  }

  return narrative_sequence
}
```

**Example Use Case:** Live Sports Broadcasting. Instead of simply showing game footage, the system dynamically weaves in hype videos, player profiles, and animated graphics, tailored to the unfolding events. A clutch shot triggers a dramatic slow-motion replay with a soaring musical score. A player injury triggers a somber graphic overlay with a message of support.

**Novelty:** Moves beyond simple content compilation towards *creative direction* based on event context.  This is not just about *what* happened, but *how* it feels, and how that feeling is conveyed to the audience.
