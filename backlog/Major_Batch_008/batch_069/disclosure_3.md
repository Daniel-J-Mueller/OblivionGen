## Adaptive Resonance Noise Cancellation

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of grounding/isolating connector noise but move beyond simple switching. Implement an adaptive resonance system that *actively cancels* noise radiating from the connector *before* it impacts the antenna, leveraging the connector itself as part of the cancellation network.

**Specs:**

*   **Resonance Core:** A micro-fabricated resonant circuit embedded *within* the device's housing, physically adjacent to the port. This circuit will be tunable across a frequency range encompassing common noise sources (switching frequencies of data/power lines, EMI from the connected device).
*   **Connector as Antenna:** Treat the connected connector (USB-C, HDMI, etc.) as a radiating element. Characterize its inherent resonant frequencies and radiation patterns.
*   **Phase/Amplitude Adjustment:**  A dedicated microcontroller will control a network of variable capacitors/inductors within the resonance core, allowing for precise adjustment of phase and amplitude of the cancellation signal.
*   **Noise Sensing:** A miniature high-bandwidth RF probe (integrated within the housing, near the port) continuously monitors the noise radiating from the connector.
*   **Adaptive Algorithm:**  The microcontroller executes an adaptive algorithm (e.g., Least Mean Squares - LMS) to minimize the sensed noise. The algorithm dynamically adjusts the resonance coreâ€™s parameters based on the sensed noise signal.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Continuous feedback loop: Noise sensed -> processed by algorithm -> adjusts resonance core -> reduces noise -> repeats.
*   **Multi-Port Support:**  Implement the system for *all* major ports on the device.
*    **Calibration Routine:** A factory calibration routine will establish baseline parameters for each port. User-initiated recalibration may be offered.

**Pseudocode (Microcontroller Firmware):**

```
// Global Variables
float desiredNoiseLevel = 0.001; //Target noise floor (example)
float sensedNoise;
float phaseAdjustment;
float amplitudeAdjustment;

// Initialization
initializeRFProbe();
initializeResonanceCore();

// Main Loop
while(true){
    sensedNoise = readRFProbe();

    // Adaptive Algorithm (LMS example)
    error = desiredNoiseLevel - sensedNoise;
    phaseAdjustment += learningRate * error * sensedNoise; // Adjust phase
    amplitudeAdjustment += learningRate * error * sensedNoise; // Adjust amplitude

    // Constrain adjustments to prevent instability
    phaseAdjustment = constrain(phaseAdjustment, -maxAdjustment, maxAdjustment);
    amplitudeAdjustment = constrain(amplitudeAdjustment, 0, maxAdjustment);

    // Apply adjustments to resonance core
    setResonanceCorePhase(phaseAdjustment);
    setResonanceCoreAmplitude(amplitudeAdjustment);

    delay(1ms);
}
```
