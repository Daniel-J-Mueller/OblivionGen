## Dynamic Tutorial Generation via Predictive Action Sequencing

**Concept:** Extend the adaptive plan generation beyond simple choice presentation to proactively *demonstrate* optimal action sequences within the application itself, dynamically constructing contextual tutorials.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** “Predictive Tutorial Engine” (PTE) - a separate module communicating with the existing plan generation system.
*   **Data Input:**
    *   Application Event Stream (same as existing system)
    *   User Action Log (records every user interaction)
    *   “Success Metric” – A defined goal state or positive outcome within the application.
    *   “Optimal Action Sequence” Database –  A repository of recorded successful user journeys, indexed by initiating event and user profile (skill level, usage patterns). This database is populated and refined through passive observation of high-performing users and A/B testing.
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Event Trigger:** When an event occurs, the PTE receives it *concurrently* with the existing plan generation system.
    2.  **Prediction:** The PTE searches the “Optimal Action Sequence” database for similar events and user profiles. It identifies the *most likely* sequence of actions that lead to the “Success Metric”.
    3.  **Tutorial Construction:** If a suitable sequence is found:
        *   The PTE generates a “Tutorial Plan” – a time-ordered set of UI highlighting, tooltips, and potentially automated actions (limited scope, user-overridable).
        *   This plan is *integrated* with the existing action plan. Instead of *just* presenting choices, the system *demonstrates* the optimal path.
        *   Tutorial elements are presented *just-in-time* – as the user approaches a decision point.
    4.  **Adaptive Difficulty:**  The PTE adjusts the level of tutorial assistance based on user performance.
        *   Successful completion of tutorial steps reduces assistance.
        *   Repeated errors or deviation from the optimal path increases assistance.
    5.  **Learning & Refinement:** The PTE passively records user interactions with the tutorial (e.g., ignoring hints, taking alternative paths). This data is used to refine the “Optimal Action Sequence” database.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function handleApplicationEvent(event, userProfile):
  // Existing plan generation
  plan = generatePlan(event, userProfile)

  // Predictive Tutorial Generation
  optimalSequence = findOptimalSequence(event, userProfile)

  if optimalSequence != null:
    tutorialPlan = constructTutorialPlan(optimalSequence)
    integratedPlan = integratePlans(plan, tutorialPlan)
    displayIntegratedPlan(integratedPlan) //UI highlighting, tooltips, automation
    logTutorialInteraction(userActions) // For database refinement
  else:
    displayPlan(plan)
```

**Novelty:** This isn’t just about suggesting choices; it's about proactively *showing* users how to achieve their goals, creating a dynamic, personalized learning experience *within* the application itself. It moves beyond static tutorials or help documentation to become an embedded learning system. The integration with the existing plan generation allows for a seamless transition between guided assistance and independent exploration.
