## Dynamic Focal Plane Array for Gesture Recognition

**Concept:** Expand the low-resolution gesture sensing concept by incorporating a micro-lens array and dynamically adjustable focal plane. This allows for depth information extraction *without* needing complex stereo vision or time-of-flight sensors, enhancing gesture recognition accuracy and enabling more nuanced interactions.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor:** 64x64 micro-lens array integrated above a monochrome image sensor (resolution matching the array – 64x64 pixels). Individual micro-lenses are adjustable via MEMS actuators.
*   **Actuation:** Each micro-lens controlled independently to shift focal point. Control range: 5cm – 200cm. Adjustment speed: 20Hz.
*   **Illumination:** Integrated IR LED array (940nm).  Intensity adjustable via software.  Pulse width modulation to minimize power consumption.
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated co-processor (FPGA or similar) for real-time focal plane adjustment and depth map generation.
*   **Communication:** MIPI CSI-2 interface to main processor. I2C for control and configuration.
*   **Power:** 3.3V operation. Average power consumption: <50mW.
*   **Physical Dimensions:** 20mm x 20mm x 5mm

**Operation:**

1.  **Initialization:** System performs a calibration routine to map actuator signals to focal plane positions.
2.  **Depth Scanning:** The system rapidly scans focal planes across the field of view. The co-processor analyzes the image sharpness for each focal plane position. Sharpest image indicates the object distance.
3.  **Depth Map Generation:** A depth map is created based on the focal plane scan results.
4.  **Gesture Recognition:**  Gesture recognition algorithms utilize the depth map and 2D image data to identify gestures.  The system can differentiate between simple gestures (wave, swipe) and more complex gestures (pinch, rotate).
5.  **Adaptive Scanning:** The system can adapt the scanning pattern based on detected movement.  If a hand is detected, the system focuses scanning on that region, improving responsiveness and reducing power consumption.

**Pseudocode (Depth Map Generation):**

```
// Variables
image_width = 64
image_height = 64
focal_points = array of focal distances (e.g., 5cm to 200cm)
depth_map = 2D array of depth values (image_width x image_height)

// Main Loop
for each focal_point in focal_points:
    capture_image(focal_point)
    calculate_image_sharpness(image)
    store_sharpness_value(depth_map, focal_point)

// Determine depth
for each pixel in depth_map:
    find_focal_point_with_max_sharpness(pixel)
    depth = focal_point_distance
    depth_map[pixel] = depth

return depth_map
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced VR/AR interaction
*   Contactless user interfaces
*   Automotive gesture control
*   Medical imaging (non-contact depth sensing)
*   Robotics (object recognition and manipulation)
