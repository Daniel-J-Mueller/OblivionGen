**Dynamic Payment Field Masking & Behavioral Biometrics Integration**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a system where payment input fields dynamically adjust their masking (e.g., showing only the last four digits of a card number) *based on real-time behavioral biometric analysis of the user’s typing patterns and mouse movements*. This moves beyond static masking and adds a layer of active fraud prevention.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Client-Side JavaScript Module:** Embedded within the merchant webpage (delivered via the existing code injection mechanism described in the patent). This module handles:
    *   Capturing keystroke dynamics (timing between key presses, duration of key presses, key pressure – if available via device APIs).
    *   Tracking mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, path).
    *   Communication with the Payment Service's Behavioral Analysis API (see below).
    *   Dynamic masking of payment input fields.
*   **Payment Service Behavioral Analysis API:** Hosted on the payment service infrastructure. This API:
    *   Receives keystroke and mouse movement data from the client-side module.
    *   Uses machine learning models to establish a “behavioral profile” for each user (based on historical data).
    *   Calculates a “risk score” in real-time based on deviations from the user’s established profile.
    *   Returns masking instructions to the client-side module (e.g., “show all digits,” “show only last four,” “completely obscure”).
*   **Back-End Integration:** The payment service backend will need to store and manage user behavioral profiles.

**III. Pseudocode (Client-Side):**

```javascript
// Initialization
initializeBehavioralTracking();

// On Payment Field Focus
function onPaymentFieldFocus(fieldId) {
  startTracking(fieldId);
}

// Data Collection & Transmission
function collectData(fieldId) {
  // Capture keystroke data (timing, pressure, etc.)
  let keystrokeData = getKeystrokeData();

  // Capture mouse movement data
  let mouseData = getMouseData();

  // Send data to Behavioral Analysis API
  sendDataToAPI(keystrokeData, mouseData)
    .then(response => {
      updateMasking(response.maskingLevel); // e.g., "full", "partial", "none"
    })
    .catch(error => {
      console.error("Error communicating with API:", error);
      // Fallback to static masking
    });
}

// Masking Update
function updateMasking(level) {
  // Logic to dynamically update masking of payment input field
  if (level === "full") {
    // Obscure all digits
  } else if (level === "partial") {
    // Show last four digits
  } else {
    // Show all digits
  }
}
```

**IV. Novelty & Advantages:**

*   **Adaptive Security:** Moves beyond static security measures to dynamically adjust security based on user behavior.
*   **Reduced Friction:**  Allows trusted users to enter payment information with minimal masking, improving the user experience.
*   **Enhanced Fraud Detection:**  Can detect fraudulent activity in real-time by identifying deviations from established user behavior.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** Builds upon the existing code injection mechanism described in the patent, minimizing integration effort.
