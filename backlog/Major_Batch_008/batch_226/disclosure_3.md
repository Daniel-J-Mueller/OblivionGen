## Decentralized Biometric Attestation with Ephemeral Trust Anchors

**Concept:** Leverage blockchain technology and zero-knowledge proofs to create a system where biometric data never resides centrally, and attestation is performed by a distributed network, enhancing privacy and security. This builds on the idea of establishing a root of trust, but distributes that trust.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Standard biometric input device (fingerprint, iris, facial recognition) integrated with a secure enclave (e.g., ARM TrustZone). Edge compute capability is preferred for initial processing.
*   **Blockchain:** Permissioned blockchain â€“ consortium of trusted entities (e.g., device manufacturers, service providers, regulatory bodies) maintaining the ledger. This ensures a degree of control and compliance.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs):** Employ ZKPs to verify biometric *equivalence* without revealing the actual biometric data. This allows proving a match against a stored template without transmitting or storing the template itself.
*   **Ephemeral Trust Anchors:** Instead of a static root of trust, generate short-lived cryptographic keys (Ephemeral Trust Anchors - ETAs) for each attestation request. These ETAs are derived from a combination of user-specific data (e.g., device ID, timestamp) and a master seed held by the user.
*   **Attestation Process:**

    1.  User initiates biometric authentication.
    2.  Biometric data is captured and processed locally within the secure enclave.
    3.  An ETA is generated based on user-specific data and a master seed.
    4.  A ZKP is generated proving equivalence between the captured biometric data and a previously registered biometric template, *signed* with the ETA.
    5.  The ZKP, along with metadata (timestamp, device ID, service requesting authentication), is submitted to the blockchain network.
    6.  Blockchain nodes independently verify the ZKP and metadata. If valid, the attestation is recorded on the blockchain.
    7.  The service requesting authentication receives confirmation from the blockchain network.
*   **Key Management:**

    *   Master seed is securely stored by the user, potentially using multi-factor authentication and key sharding.
    *   ETAs are single-use and discarded after attestation.
    *   Blockchain nodes do not store biometric data or cryptographic keys.
*   **Pseudocode (Attestation Function - Secure Enclave):**

```
function attestBiometric(biometricData, masterSeed, serviceRequest):
  eta = generateEphemeralKey(masterSeed, serviceRequest.timestamp)
  zkp = generateZeroKnowledgeProof(biometricData, eta)
  transactionData = {
    zkp: zkp,
    metadata: serviceRequest
  }
  submitTransactionToBlockchain(transactionData, eta)
  return transactionConfirmation
```

*   **Scalability Considerations:** Implement sharding or layer-2 scaling solutions on the blockchain to handle a large volume of attestation requests.
*   **Privacy Enhancements:** Utilize privacy-preserving techniques such as differential privacy to further obfuscate biometric data and prevent deanonymization attacks.

This system shifts the paradigm from centralized biometric databases to a decentralized, privacy-preserving attestation mechanism, reducing the risk of data breaches and enhancing user control over their biometric information.
