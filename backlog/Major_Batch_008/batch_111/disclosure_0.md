## Adaptive Spatial Audio Masking

**Concept:** Dynamically generate localized audio ‘masks’ to selectively attenuate or enhance specific sound sources in a mixed acoustic environment, leveraging multi-microphone arrays and real-time spectral analysis. This moves beyond simple beamforming or noise cancellation, aiming for precise, user-defined audio shaping.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum 8-microphone array (circular or linear configuration).
    *   High-fidelity audio output (headphones or multi-speaker system).
    *   Dedicated DSP or FPGA for real-time processing.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Source Localization:** Implement a robust source localization algorithm (e.g., Time Difference of Arrival – TDOA, steered-response power) to identify the direction and distance of sound sources in the environment.  Accuracy target: +/- 5 degrees directionally, +/- 0.2 meters distance.
    *   **Spectral Decomposition:**  Perform Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) on audio from each microphone in the array.  Window size: adjustable (e.g., 20ms – 100ms), overlap: 50% - 75%.
    *   **Mask Generation:** This is the core of the system.
        *   For each identified sound source:
            *   Calculate a spectral mask based on the STFT data. The mask will have values between 0 and 1, representing the attenuation or enhancement level for each frequency bin.
            *   Mask shape:  Elliptical or user-defined shape, controlled by parameters for width, height, and rotation.  This allows shaping the mask to target specific frequency ranges.
            *   Mask edge falloff:  Sigmoid or Gaussian function to create a smooth transition between attenuated and non-attenuated frequencies.  Adjustable steepness parameter.
            *   Dynamic Mask Adjustment: Implement a feedback loop using a desired sound profile and analyzing the output spectrum to fine-tune the mask shape and attenuation levels.
    *   **Beamforming/Spatial Filtering:** Apply beamforming or spatial filtering techniques, using the generated masks as weights, to selectively enhance or attenuate sound from different directions.
    *   **Output Synthesis:**  Combine the filtered audio signals from each microphone and synthesize the final output signal.
*   **Control Interface:**
    *   Graphical User Interface (GUI) for:
        *   Visualizing the acoustic environment (sound source locations).
        *   Adjusting mask parameters (shape, attenuation, frequency range).
        *   Defining desired sound profiles (e.g., ‘focus on voice’, ‘suppress background noise’).
        *   Saving and loading mask presets.
*   **Pseudocode (Mask Generation):**

```
FOR each sound_source IN detected_sources:
    source_location = get_location(sound_source)
    frequency_spectrum = get_spectrum(sound_source)
    
    mask = create_empty_mask()
    
    FOR each frequency_bin IN frequency_spectrum:
        attenuation = calculate_attenuation(frequency_bin, source_location) # Based on user preference & sound profile
        mask[frequency_bin] = attenuation
        
    apply_mask_shape(mask, source_location) # Elliptical or custom shape
    smooth_mask_edges(mask)  # Sigmoid or Gaussian falloff
    
    add_mask_to_output(mask)
```

*   **Expansion Possibilities:**
    *   Integration with head-tracking systems for dynamic mask adjustment based on user’s gaze direction.
    *   Machine learning models to automatically learn user preferences and optimize mask parameters.
    *   Implementation of a ‘sound painting’ feature, allowing users to selectively enhance or suppress sounds by drawing regions on a virtual acoustic map.
    *   Support for virtual/augmented reality applications, creating immersive soundscapes tailored to the user’s environment.
