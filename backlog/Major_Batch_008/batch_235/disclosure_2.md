## Proactive Gift Need Anticipation & Fulfillment

**Concept:** Expand beyond reacting to *known* gift-giving events (birthdays, holidays) to *anticipate* needs based on life events and provide fulfillment options *before* the user even realizes they need a gift.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sources:**

*   **Public Records Integration:** Access publicly available data sources (news articles, social media - *with user consent where legally required*, professional networking sites). Identify life events: promotions, new jobs, engagements, births, deaths, house purchases, graduations.
*   **User-Explicit Data:**  Allow users to optionally link accounts (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc.) or manually input life events for friends/family.
*   **Purchase History Analysis:**  Analyze past gift purchases - *not just for the recipient, but for the giver as well* - to identify patterns and preferred gift types related to specific life events.
*   **Contextual Data:** Integrate with calendar applications (with user permission) to understand upcoming events that *might* necessitate a gift (e.g., a friend is hosting a dinner party).

**2.  Event/Need Inference Engine:**

*   **Rule-Based System:** Predefined rules linking life events to potential gift needs.  Example: “New job -> congratulatory gift,” “New baby -> baby shower gift/practical items,” “House purchase -> housewarming gift.”
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a model to predict gift needs based on a combination of the data sources above. Input features: life event type, relationship to recipient, past gift history, recipient preferences (from wish lists, purchase history), contextual data. Output: probability of a gift being needed, suggested gift categories, estimated budget.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze social media posts or news articles about the recipient to gauge their current emotional state and identify potential needs (e.g., someone recovering from illness might need comfort items).

**3.  Proactive Notification & Fulfillment System:**

*   **"Gift Opportunity" Alerts:** Notify the user when the system detects a potential gift opportunity for someone in their network.  Example: “John Doe was recently promoted to VP at Acme Corp – potential congratulatory gift opportunity.”
*   **Automated Gift Recommendation:** Generate a curated list of gift recommendations based on the recipient's preferences, the occasion, and the user's budget.  Include options from existing wish lists, suggested items based on past purchases, and personalized recommendations.
*   **Integrated Fulfillment:** Allow the user to purchase the gift directly through the system, with options for gift wrapping, personalized messages, and automated delivery.
*   **"Gift Subscription" Option:**  Allow users to set up automated gift subscriptions for specific individuals. The system will identify potential gift opportunities and automatically purchase and deliver a gift on their behalf (within a pre-defined budget and approval parameters).
*   **"Group Gifting" Facilitation:** Facilitate group gifting by allowing users to invite others to contribute to a gift. The system will collect contributions and automatically purchase a gift on behalf of the group.

**Pseudocode (Event Inference):**

```
FUNCTION infer_gift_need(user, recipient, event_data)
  IF event_data.type == "promotion" THEN
    need_level = calculate_need_level(recipient.preferences, user.past_gifts_to_recipient, "congratulatory")
    IF need_level > 0.7 THEN
      recommendations = generate_gift_recommendations(recipient.preferences, "congratulatory", user.budget)
      return "potential congratulatory gift opportunity", recommendations
    ENDIF
  ELSE IF event_data.type == "new_baby" THEN
    need_level = calculate_need_level(recipient.preferences, user.past_gifts_to_recipient, "baby_shower")
    IF need_level > 0.8 THEN
      recommendations = generate_gift_recommendations(recipient.preferences, "baby_shower", user.budget)
      return "potential baby shower gift opportunity", recommendations
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

  RETURN "no immediate gift opportunity detected"
END FUNCTION
```

**Scalability:** System designed to handle millions of users and events, using cloud-based infrastructure and distributed data processing.  Focus on real-time event detection and personalized recommendation generation.
