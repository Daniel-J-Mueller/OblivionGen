## Adaptive Packet Interpolation via Predictive Coding

**Concept:** Enhance packet loss resilience not by reconstructing *lost* packets, but by predicting their content *before* transmission, and sending only the residual (difference) between prediction and actual data. This shifts the burden from receiver-side reconstruction to sender-side prediction.

**Specifications:**

**I. Prediction Engine (Sender Side):**

*   **Model:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) – trained on representative audio data.
*   **Input:** Sequence of *n* previous audio data packets (e.g., last 10 packets).
*   **Output:** Predicted content of the next data packet.  Output format matches input data packet format.
*   **Residual Calculation:**  Subtract the predicted packet content from the actual packet content, element by element. The resulting difference is the “residual packet.”
*   **Residual Encoding:** Apply a lossless compression algorithm (e.g., zlib, LZ4) to the residual packet to further reduce its size.
*   **Transmission:** Send the encoded residual packet *instead* of the original data packet.  Also transmit a flag indicating the prediction model version used.

**II. Interpolation Engine (Receiver Side):**

*   **Model:**  Identical RNN architecture and trained weights as the sender’s prediction engine (model version must match the flag received).
*   **Input:**  Sequence of *n* previous audio data packets (same as sender) and the received encoded residual packet.
*   **Residual Decoding:** Decompress the received encoded residual packet.
*   **Packet Reconstruction:** Add the decoded residual packet to the predicted packet content. This yields the reconstructed data packet.
*   **Error Handling:** If residual decoding fails, or the prediction model version is incompatible, revert to a traditional packet loss concealment method (e.g., forward error correction) as a fallback.

**III. Adaptive Control:**

*   **Packet Loss Rate Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the packet loss rate.
*   **Prediction Confidence:**  Calculate a “prediction confidence” metric based on the magnitude of the residual (smaller residual = higher confidence).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   **High Packet Loss + Low Confidence:** Increase the number of previous packets (*n*) used as input to the prediction engine (more context).
    *   **Low Packet Loss + High Confidence:** Decrease *n* to reduce computational load.
    *   **Consistent High Confidence:** Switch to sending only the residual *without* compression (further reduce latency).
    *   **Consistent High Packet Loss:** Activate a more robust (but higher-latency) error correction scheme.

**Pseudocode (Receiver Side):**

```
function reconstruct_packet(previous_packets, received_residual):
  if residual_decoding_fails(received_residual):
    // Fallback to traditional packet loss concealment
    return conceal_packet(previous_packets)

  decoded_residual = residual_decode(received_residual)
  predicted_packet = predict_next_packet(previous_packets) // Using RNN model
  reconstructed_packet = predicted_packet + decoded_residual
  return reconstructed_packet
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sender and receiver require sufficient processing power to run the RNN models and compression/decompression algorithms.
*   Low-latency communication channel is crucial to minimize the impact of the prediction algorithm.
