## Adaptive Key Rotation via Biometric Drift Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the two-factor authentication (2FA) system with a continuously adapting key rotation schedule driven by analysis of biometric data drift. The premise is that subtle, measurable changes in a user's biometric signature (e.g., typing cadence, mouse movements, gait analysis via wearable integration) indicate potential compromise *before* traditional security alerts are triggered.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biometric Data Collection Module:**

*   **Input:** Continuous stream of biometric data from user interactions (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, integrated wearables - optional).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Real-time feature extraction (typing speed, pressure, error rate, mouse acceleration, movement patterns, gait analysis features).
    *   Establish a baseline biometric profile for each user during initial enrollment/authentication.
    *   Data normalization and preprocessing to remove noise and inconsistencies.
*   **Output:** Normalized biometric feature vector.

**2. Drift Detection Engine:**

*   **Input:** Real-time biometric feature vector, baseline biometric profile.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Employ statistical drift detection algorithms (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Drift Detection Method).
    *   Calculate a 'drift score' representing the degree of deviation from the baseline.  Thresholds define levels of suspicion.
    *   Dynamic weighting of biometric features based on their predictive power (machine learning-driven).
*   **Output:** Drift score, suspicion level (low, medium, high).

**3. Adaptive Key Rotation Manager:**

*   **Input:** Drift score, suspicion level, current key rotation schedule.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Key rotation schedule is initially determined by policy (e.g., every 30 days).
    *   Suspicion level modulates the schedule:
        *   **Low:** Maintain scheduled rotation.
        *   **Medium:** Advance next rotation date by a configurable interval (e.g., 7 days).
        *   **High:** Initiate immediate key rotation. Force re-authentication with new credentials.
    *   Key rotation occurs via secure exchange, managed by a dedicated Key Management Service (KMS).
    *   Audit logging of all key rotations and associated drift events.
*   **Output:** Command to KMS for key rotation. Alert to security team if high suspicion triggers immediate rotation.

**4. Integration with Existing 2FA:**

*   The system operates *in addition to* existing 2FA methods (e.g., TOTP, push notifications).
*   Key rotation is transparent to the user.
*   Increased security layer triggered by biometric anomalies.
*   Can be toggled on/off per user or group.

**Pseudocode (Drift Detection & Key Rotation):**

```
// Initialization
baseline_profile = CollectBaselineBiometricData(user)
key_rotation_schedule = GetDefaultKeyRotationSchedule()

// Real-time loop
while (true) {
    biometric_data = CollectRealtimeBiometricData(user)
    drift_score = CalculateDriftScore(biometric_data, baseline_profile)
    suspicion_level = DetermineSuspicionLevel(drift_score)

    if (suspicion_level == "High") {
        RotateKey(user)
        AlertSecurityTeam(user, "Biometric Drift Detected - Key Rotated")
    } else if (suspicion_level == "Medium") {
        AdvanceKeyRotationDate(user, 7) // Advance by 7 days
    }

    Sleep(1) // Sample every 1 second (configurable)
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Standard computing resources for processing biometric data.
*   Secure storage for baseline profiles and KMS integration.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Biometric data collection libraries.
*   Statistical analysis and drift detection algorithms.
*   KMS integration API.
*   Security auditing and logging framework.
