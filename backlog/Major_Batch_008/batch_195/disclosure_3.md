## Dynamic Feature Hashing with Learned Collision Resolution

**Concept:** The patent focuses on reducing model size through quantization and sparse representations. This builds on that by introducing a dynamic, learned collision resolution strategy within the feature hashing process itself, allowing for greater compression *before* the model parameters are even determined, and potentially improving accuracy.

**Specs:**

1.  **Hashing Layer:** Replace the single hash function used for feature indexing with a small, trainable neural network (a multi-layer perceptron with 2-3 layers). This network takes the raw feature data as input (e.g., the word, adjacent words, presence/absence indicators) and outputs *multiple* hash values (e.g., 3-5). Each hash value corresponds to a potential index in the model parameter store.

2.  **Collision Detection & Resolution:**
    *   During training, after calculating the hash values for a feature, check for collisions (multiple features mapping to the same index).
    *   If a collision occurs, assign a “collision weight” to each feature involved. This weight is learned during training via backpropagation. Higher weights indicate more “important” features that should be prioritized.
    *   Instead of simply overwriting, features involved in a collision now contribute to the model parameter at that index with a weight proportional to their collision weight.  The parameter value becomes a *weighted sum* of contributions from multiple features.

3.  **Sparse Activation & Pruning:**
    *   Introduce a threshold for collision weights.  If the collision weight for a feature falls below the threshold, it’s considered insignificant and its contribution to the parameter is effectively pruned (set to zero).
    *   Regularization (L1 or L2) can be applied to the collision weights to encourage sparsity and further pruning.

4.  **Training Process:**
    *   The entire system – hashing network, collision weights, model parameters – is trained end-to-end using backpropagation.
    *   A loss function incorporating both the prediction accuracy and a sparsity penalty on the collision weights should be used.

**Pseudocode (simplified training step):**

```python
# For each training example (sentence, label)
for word in sentence:
  # Generate feature data for the word
  feature_data = generate_feature_data(word)

  # Generate multiple hash values using the hashing network
  hash_values = hashing_network(feature_data)

  # For each hash value
  for hash_value in hash_values:
    # Get current parameter value at that index
    parameter_value = model_parameters[hash_value]

    # Calculate the contribution of this feature
    contribution = feature_data * weight_for_label  # Or some other feature-specific weight

    # Add the contribution to the parameter value
    parameter_value += contribution

    # Update the model parameters (backpropagation occurs here)

# Prune based on collision weights (after a full epoch)
for i in range(len(model_parameters)):
    if collision_weight[i] < threshold:
        model_parameters[i] = 0

```

**Rationale:** This approach allows for a more nuanced handling of collisions. Instead of simply losing information when multiple features map to the same index, we retain it (albeit in a combined form) and *learn* which features are most important. The learned collision resolution mechanism effectively increases the capacity of the hash space without increasing the number of parameters, enabling greater compression and potentially improving accuracy. The pruning step further reduces model size by eliminating insignificant features.
