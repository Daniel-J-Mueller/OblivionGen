## Networked Device Persona & Configuration Swapping

**Concept:** Extend the provisioning concept to allow networked devices to *adopt* the operational persona – including security profiles, software stacks, and intended network role – of other devices. This isn't just provisioning *to* a state, but *becoming* another device.

**Specification:**

**Hardware:**

*   **Persona Storage:** Non-volatile memory (NVMe preferred) with sufficient capacity to store complete OS images, configuration files, and associated software packages for a defined number (e.g., 5-10) of 'personas'.
*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** Dedicated cryptographic co-processor for secure key storage and attestation.
*   **Flexible Network Interface:** Gigabit Ethernet + WiFi 6E (or higher) to support diverse network connectivity requirements.

**Software:**

*   **Persona Manager:** Core software component responsible for persona storage, retrieval, and application.
*   **Attestation Service:** Verifies the authenticity of personas before application, preventing malicious or unauthorized adoption.
*   **Dynamic Configuration Engine:** Modifies system configuration (network settings, firewall rules, application settings) to match the selected persona.
*   **Virtualization/Containerization Layer:** Enables running multiple personas in isolation, potentially for testing or A/B deployment.
*   **Remote Persona Repository:** Cloud-based storage for personas, allowing for centralized management and distribution.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Persona Creation:** A 'master' device or administrator creates a persona by capturing its current OS image, configuration, and software stack. This persona is then signed and stored in the Remote Persona Repository.
2.  **Persona Discovery:** A target device scans for available personas in the Remote Persona Repository or on a local network.
3.  **Persona Selection:** An administrator or automated process selects a persona to adopt.
4.  **Attestation:** The target device verifies the authenticity and integrity of the selected persona using the Attestation Service.
5.  **Persona Application:** The Persona Manager downloads the persona and applies it to the target device, modifying system configuration and software as needed.
6.  **Operational State:** The target device now operates as if it *is* the original device from which the persona was created. This includes network identity, security profile, and software functionality.

**Pseudocode (Persona Application):**

```
function applyPersona(personaFile, signature) {
  if (verifySignature(personaFile, signature) == false) {
    logError("Invalid persona signature");
    return false;
  }

  personaData = loadPersonaData(personaFile);

  // Halt all services 
  haltAllServices();

  // Disable networking
  disableNetworking();

  // Apply network configuration from personaData
  applyNetworkConfiguration(personaData.networkConfig);

  // Apply security configuration (firewall, access control lists)
  applySecurityConfiguration(personaData.securityConfig);

  // Install/configure required software packages
  installSoftwarePackages(personaData.softwarePackages);

  // Restore OS Image (if included in persona)
  restoreOsImage(personaData.osImage);

  // Enable networking
  enableNetworking();

  // Start services
  startServices();

  logInfo("Persona applied successfully");
  return true;
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Rapid Device Provisioning:** Deploy pre-configured devices with specific roles (e.g., firewall, DNS server, web server) without manual configuration.
*   **Automated Disaster Recovery:** Restore devices to a known-good state after a security breach or system failure.
*   **Dynamic Network Adaptation:** Enable devices to automatically assume different roles in response to changing network conditions.
*   **Secure Remote Access:** Allow authorized users to securely access remote devices by adopting a pre-configured persona.
*   **A/B Testing & Staged Rollouts:** Deploy new software or configuration changes to a small group of devices by adopting a test persona.
