## Adaptive Contextual Wakeword Prioritization

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on preventing *secondary* wakeword responses while a primary system is active. This adaptation proposes a system that *dynamically adjusts* wakeword sensitivity based on contextual awareness, prioritizing likely relevant commands *before* a full wakeword detection is even confirmed, and intelligently ‘steering’ audio processing.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing user device microphone array and processor. Dedicated, low-latency processing unit for ‘steering’/filtering audio.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Contextual Awareness Engine (CAE):*  Integrates data from user profile (preferences, routines), device sensors (location, activity), calendar data, and ambient environment (noise levels, identified devices - smart home).
    *   *Wakeword Prioritization Matrix (WPM):*  A dynamic table correlating contexts with weighted wakeword probabilities.  The CAE updates the WPM in real-time.  Example: "Driving" context, high probability of "Navigation", "Call", "Music" wakewords; low probability of "Smart Home" commands.
    *   *Pre-Detection Audio Steering (PDAS):* A module which, *before* a full wakeword detection, applies directional filtering to the microphone array. The PDAS uses the WPM to subtly enhance audio frequencies associated with prioritized wakewords, and attenuate others. This is *not* full noise cancellation, but a gentle biasing of the audio signal.
    *   *Adaptive Threshold Control (ATC):* Adjusts the sensitivity threshold for each wakeword detection component *individually*, based on the WPM and the PDAS output. High-probability wakewords have lower thresholds; low-probability wakewords have higher thresholds.
    *   *Confidence Scoring Module (CSM):* Assesses the confidence level of detected wakewords, taking into account the PDAS, ATC, and WPM. Commands with low confidence are suppressed.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Context Acquisition:** CAE continuously gathers context data.
2.  **WPM Update:** CAE updates the WPM based on the acquired context.
3.  **PDAS Activation:** PDAS adjusts microphone array focus and frequency biasing according to the WPM.
4.  **ATC Adjustment:** ATC dynamically sets wakeword detection thresholds for each component based on the WPM and PDAS output.
5.  **Wakeword Detection:** Wakeword detection components analyze audio.
6.  **CSM Assessment:** CSM assesses the confidence level of detected wakewords.
7.  **Command Prioritization & Processing:**  High-confidence commands are processed; low-confidence commands are ignored. The primary/secondary designation is less crucial; relevant commands are prioritized regardless of source.

**Pseudocode (ATC Module):**

```
function adjustThreshold(wakeword, context, PDAS_output):
    // Retrieve wakeword probability from WPM based on context
    wakeword_probability = WPM.getProbability(wakeword, context)

    // Calculate base threshold
    base_threshold = 1.0 // Default threshold

    // Adjust threshold based on probability and PDAS output
    threshold = base_threshold * (1.0 - wakeword_probability) + (PDAS_output * 0.2)  // Reduce threshold for high probability, enhance with PDAS

    // Clamp threshold (ensure it stays within reasonable bounds)
    threshold = clamp(threshold, 0.1, 0.9)

    return threshold
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond simply suppressing secondary wakewords and actively *shapes* the audio input to prioritize likely commands. It’s a proactive rather than reactive system. The PDAS component is particularly innovative, subtly influencing audio perception before full detection, and potentially reducing false positives. The integration of contextual awareness and dynamic threshold control creates a highly adaptive and efficient speech processing system. It’s not about blocking, but about intelligent filtering and prioritization.
