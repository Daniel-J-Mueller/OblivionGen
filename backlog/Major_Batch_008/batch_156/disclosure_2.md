## Modular, Liquid-Cooled Compute Brick with Integrated Energy Storage

**Concept:** Develop a fully self-contained compute "brick" designed for dense rack deployment. This brick integrates compute (CPU/GPU), storage (NVMe SSDs), *and* energy storage (high-density batteries/ultracapacitors) within a sealed, liquid-cooled enclosure. The intent is to create a resilient, rapidly deployable compute node capable of short-term autonomous operation and/or load shifting.

**Specifications:**

*   **Dimensions:** 1U rack unit height x 8.89” (standard half-width) x 24”.
*   **Chassis:** Sealed aluminum alloy enclosure. Internal components mounted on vibration-dampening supports.
*   **Compute:**
    *   Dual AMD EPYC 9654 processors or equivalent.
    *   Two high-end GPUs (NVIDIA H100 or AMD Instinct MI300X) – passively cooled, directly contacting liquid cold plate.
    *   DDR5 ECC Registered RAM – 2TB total.
*   **Storage:**
    *   8 x 7.68TB NVMe PCIe Gen5 SSDs.
    *   RAID configuration – software defined, configurable per brick.
*   **Energy Storage:**
    *   Solid-state lithium-ion battery pack – 20 kWh capacity.
    *   Battery Management System (BMS) – monitors cell voltage, temperature, and current; provides balancing and protection.
    *   Integrated DC-DC converter – regulates battery voltage to power internal components.
*   **Cooling:**
    *   Direct liquid cooling – cold plates on CPU, GPU, and SSDs.
    *   Microchannel cold plate design for optimal heat transfer.
    *   Integrated pump and radiator – external rack-mounted cooling loop connection.
    *   Coolant: Non-conductive dielectric fluid.
*   **Networking:**
    *   Dual 400GbE network interfaces.
    *   Remote management via IPMI.
*   **Power Input/Output:**
    *   Standard AC power input with redundant power supplies.
    *   DC output – capable of providing limited power to neighboring bricks in a rack during short outages.
*   **Software:**
    *   Pre-installed operating system (Linux distribution preferred) with remote management tools.
    *   Software-defined power management – optimizes energy usage and manages battery charging/discharging.
    *   API for external control and monitoring.

**Operational Modes:**

1.  **Standard Rack Mode:** Operates as a typical rack server, drawing power from the rack’s PDU.
2.  **Autonomous Mode:** Disconnects from external power and operates solely on battery power. Duration depends on workload and battery capacity.
3.  **Load Shifting Mode:** Utilizes battery power to supplement rack power during peak demand. This can reduce power costs and improve grid stability.
4.  **Emergency Mode:**  Provides limited power to adjacent compute bricks within the rack during a short-duration power outage.

**Pseudocode – Battery Management System (Simplified):**

```
// Variables
float batteryLevel;
float loadDemand;
float rackPowerAvailable;

// Function - Adjust Power Source
function adjustPowerSource() {
  if (batteryLevel > 20% && loadDemand > rackPowerAvailable) {
    // Supplement rack power with battery
    powerOutput = loadDemand;
    batteryDischargeRate = (loadDemand - rackPowerAvailable) / batteryCapacity;
  } else {
    // Rely solely on rack power
    powerOutput = rackPowerAvailable;
    batteryDischargeRate = 0;
  }
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Read Sensor Data
  batteryLevel = readBatteryLevel();
  loadDemand = readLoadDemand();
  rackPowerAvailable = readRackPowerAvailable();

  // Adjust Power Source
  adjustPowerSource();

  // Monitor System Health
  if (batteryLevel < 5%) {
    // Alert Admin
    sendAlert("Low Battery!");
  }

  // Sleep
  sleep(1);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Edge computing deployments
*   High-frequency trading environments
*   Disaster recovery solutions
*   Remote data centers
*   High-performance computing clusters requiring increased resilience.
