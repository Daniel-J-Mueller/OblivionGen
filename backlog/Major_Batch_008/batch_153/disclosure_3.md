## Autonomous Damage Classification via Impact Acoustics & Robotic Manipulation

**System Specifications:**

*   **Robotic Platform:** Mobile manipulator arm (6-7 DoF) mounted on a wheeled base, capable of traversing uneven terrain. Payload capacity: 15kg. Repeatability: ±0.1mm.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-frequency accelerometers (kHz range) integrated into the robotic end effector (gripper/tool). Minimum 3-axis.
    *   Microphone array (4-8 elements) integrated into the end effector, synchronized with accelerometer data.
    *   High-resolution RGB-D camera mounted on the end effector.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robotic base for overall platform motion compensation.
*   **Actuation System:** Pneumatic or electric impulse hammer integrated into the robotic end effector. Capable of delivering controlled impacts with varying force (0.1N – 10N) and duration (1ms – 10ms).
*   **Data Acquisition:** High-speed data acquisition system (minimum 1MHz sampling rate) to capture accelerometer, microphone, and camera data simultaneously.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded processing unit (GPU-accelerated) capable of real-time signal processing and machine learning inference.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Target Acquisition:** System navigates to target object.  RGB-D camera performs initial 3D scan to identify potential impact points (flat surfaces preferred).
2.  **Controlled Impact:** Robotic arm positions the end effector. The impulse hammer delivers a series of controlled impacts to the identified impact points. Impact force and duration are varied to generate a range of acoustic and vibrational responses.
3.  **Data Capture:** Simultaneously, the accelerometer, microphone array, and RGB-D camera capture data during and immediately after each impact.
4.  **Signal Processing:**
    *   **Acoustic Emission Analysis:** Captured audio data undergoes spectral analysis (FFT, Wavelet Transform) to identify characteristic frequencies and transient events indicative of material damage. Beamforming techniques are used to localize the source of acoustic emissions.
    *   **Vibration Analysis:** Accelerometer data is processed to extract vibrational modes, damping characteristics, and resonant frequencies. Modal analysis techniques are employed to identify changes in structural integrity.
    *   **Fusion & Correlation:** Acoustic and vibrational data are fused to create a comprehensive damage signature. Correlation algorithms identify patterns and anomalies associated with different types of damage (cracks, delamination, voids, etc.).
    *   **Visual Inspection:**  RGB-D data is processed to create a point cloud representation of the object’s surface.  Algorithms are used to detect surface irregularities, deformation, or visual signs of damage.
5.  **Damage Classification:** A trained machine learning model (CNN, RNN, or hybrid architecture) classifies the damage type based on the fused acoustic, vibrational, and visual data. Model outputs a damage severity level (e.g., negligible, minor, moderate, severe).
6.  **Damage Mapping:** System creates a damage map overlaying the detected damage locations and severity levels onto the object’s 3D model.

**Pseudocode (Damage Classification):**

```
FUNCTION ClassifyDamage(acousticData, vibrationData, visualData):
    // Feature Extraction
    acousticFeatures = ExtractFeatures(acousticData)
    vibrationFeatures = ExtractFeatures(vibrationData)
    visualFeatures = ExtractFeatures(visualData)

    // Feature Fusion
    combinedFeatures = Concatenate(acousticFeatures, vibrationFeatures, visualFeatures)

    // Machine Learning Inference
    damageClass = trainedModel.Predict(combinedFeatures)

    // Severity Assessment (example - could be more complex)
    severity = DetermineSeverity(damageClass)

    RETURN damageClass, severity
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION ExtractFeatures(data):
  //Implement Signal and Image Processing techniques (FFT, Wavelets, Edge Detection)
  //Return vector of key features
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION DetermineSeverity(damageClass):
  //Based on damageClass return severity level (Minor, Moderate, Severe, etc.)
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**

This system distinguishes itself from existing non-destructive testing (NDT) methods by employing active excitation (controlled impacts) in combination with multi-modal sensing and machine learning.  It moves beyond passive listening or visual inspection to actively probe the object's structural integrity and identify damage at an early stage. The combination of acoustic emission, vibration analysis, and visual inspection provides a more robust and accurate damage assessment compared to traditional methods. The embedded processing and autonomous operation enables real-time inspection and damage mapping in challenging environments.
