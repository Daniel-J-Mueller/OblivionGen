## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Classification & Personalized Beamforming

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple beamforming for voice isolation to incorporate real-time acoustic scene classification *coupled* with personalized beamforming profiles based on user ear canal geometry and listening preferences. This isn’t just about *where* sound is coming from, but *what* environment the user is in, and how *they* prefer to hear in that environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   In-ear device with 4-6 microphones (existing 3 + 1-2 dedicated to scene analysis).
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) – accelerometer & gyroscope for head tracking and movement detection.
    *   Optional: Bone conduction transducer for supplementary audio input/confirmation.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Classifier:**  A deep learning model trained on a vast dataset of acoustic scenes (office, street, home, restaurant, vehicle, etc.) using microphone array data & IMU input.  Model outputs a probability distribution over possible scenes.  Latency target: < 50ms.
    *   **Ear Canal Geometry Scanner:**  Utilize a miniature ultrasonic or optical scanner integrated into the earbud to map the user’s ear canal shape during initial setup (or on demand). Generates a 3D model of the ear canal.
    *   **Personalized Beamforming Profile Generator:** Algorithm that utilizes the ear canal model to calculate optimal beamforming weights for different frequencies and directions. Factors in individual auditory perception characteristics (determined through a short subjective listening test).
    *   **Dynamic Beamforming Engine:**  The core beamforming algorithm.  It receives scene classification probabilities, personalized beamforming profiles, and real-time microphone data.  Adjusts beamforming weights dynamically based on this input.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:** Robust noise cancellation and echo suppression techniques based on real-time environment analysis.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Beamforming Engine):**

```
// Inputs:
//   micData[]: Array of microphone signals
//   sceneProbabilities[]: Probability distribution over acoustic scenes
//   personalizedProfile: Personalized beamforming profile (weights, filters)

function dynamicBeamforming(micData[], sceneProbabilities[], personalizedProfile) {

  // 1. Scene-Dependent Weight Adjustment
  adjustedWeights = calculateSceneWeights(sceneProbabilities, personalizedProfile.sceneWeights);

  // 2. Apply Personalized Beamforming
  beamformedSignal = applyBeamforming(micData, adjustedWeights, personalizedProfile.beamformingCoefficients);

  // 3. Adaptive Noise Cancellation
  noiseEstimate = estimateNoise(beamformedSignal, micData);
  cleanedSignal = subtractNoise(beamformedSignal, noiseEstimate);

  // 4. Echo Cancellation (optional)
  echoEstimate = estimateEcho(cleanedSignal, micData);
  finalSignal = subtractEcho(cleanedSignal, echoEstimate);

  return finalSignal;
}

function calculateSceneWeights(sceneProbabilities[], baseWeights[]) {
  // Weighted average of base weights based on scene probabilities
  // Higher probability = greater influence on final weights
  weightedWeights = [];
  for (i = 0; i < baseWeights.length; i++) {
    weightedWeights[i] = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < sceneProbabilities.length; j++) {
      weightedWeights[i] += sceneProbabilities[j] * baseWeights[j][i];
    }
  }
  return weightedWeights;
}
```

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Setup:** User scans ear canal. Listening test determines basic auditory profile.
2.  **Real-Time Operation:** The Acoustic Scene Classifier analyzes microphone data and IMU input to identify the current environment. The Dynamic Beamforming Engine combines this information with the personalized profile to dynamically adjust beamforming weights. The system prioritizes sound from the direction of the user's focus while suppressing noise and echo.  

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Directional Audio Cues:** Use beamforming to create the illusion of sound sources moving around the user's head (spatial audio).
*   **Biometric Integration:** Integrate biometric sensors (heart rate, EEG) to adapt beamforming profiles based on the user's emotional state.
*   **AI-Powered Profile Learning:** Allow the system to learn user preferences over time and automatically refine the personalized beamforming profile.
