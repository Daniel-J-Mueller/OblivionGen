## Dynamic Category Weighting via User Interaction

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts category relevance weights based on explicit user feedback *after* initial categorization. This expands on the provided patent’s categorization service by creating a learning loop.

**Components:**

1.  **Categorization Service (Existing):**  Receives item information and assigns initial primary and secondary categories as described in the patent.
2.  **Feedback Interface:** A user-facing component (e.g., within the network-based service) allowing users to indicate agreement/disagreement with assigned categories.  This could be a simple “thumbs up/down” system, or a more granular system allowing users to specify *why* a category is incorrect.
3.  **Weight Adjustment Module:**  This module receives feedback signals from the Feedback Interface and adjusts the weights assigned to different category attributes during the relevance assessment process.
4.  **Weight Storage:**  A database to store adjusted attribute weights. Weights are specific to user groups or even individual users, allowing personalization.
5.  **Relevance Assessment Engine (Modified):**  The original engine is modified to incorporate attribute weights during relevance scoring.

**Pseudocode - Relevance Scoring:**

```
function calculate_relevance(item_info, category_attributes, attribute_weights):
    relevance_score = 0
    for attribute in attribute_attributes:
        if attribute in item_info:
            relevance_score += item_info[attribute] * attribute_weights[attribute]
    return relevance_score
```

**Workflow:**

1.  Item submitted.
2.  Categorization Service assigns initial categories (as per patent).
3.  Categories presented to user via Feedback Interface.
4.  User provides feedback (e.g., ‘disagree’ with ‘Electronics > Headphones’).
5.  Weight Adjustment Module analyzes feedback.  If user disagrees with ‘Headphones’, the weight associated with attributes strongly tied to ‘Headphones’ (e.g., ‘earcup material’, ‘noise cancellation’) is *decreased* for this user (or user group).  Weights associated with attributes supporting *alternative* categories (e.g., ‘bluetooth connectivity’ potentially supporting ‘Accessories’) are *increased*.
6.  The Relevance Assessment Engine uses the adjusted weights for future categorization of this user's items.

**Data Structures:**

*   **User Profile:**  Contains adjusted attribute weights for each user.
*   **Attribute Weight Table:**  Base weights for each attribute (modifiable by the Weight Adjustment Module).

**Novelty:**  Existing systems typically rely on static category hierarchies and predefined relevance rules. This system introduces a dynamic learning component, allowing the categorization service to adapt to individual user preferences and improve accuracy over time.  It moves beyond simply *assigning* categories to *learning* what categories make sense to different users.
