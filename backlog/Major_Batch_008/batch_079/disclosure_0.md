## Dynamic Persona-Based Search Refinement

**Concept:** Extend relevance feedback beyond simple ‘relevant/irrelevant’ signals. Capture user *personas* through behavioral data and implicit feedback during search, and then actively tailor search results *before* explicit feedback is given.

**Specification:**

1.  **Persona Definition:**
    *   Establish a series of pre-defined personas (e.g., “Budget Shopper”, “Luxury Enthusiast”, “Technical Expert”, “Trend Follower”). These are archetypes influencing product preference.
    *   Each persona is assigned weighted criteria impacting search ranking (price sensitivity, brand preference, feature importance, aesthetic preferences, etc.).

2.  **Behavioral Data Collection:**
    *   Track user interactions beyond the current search session. This includes:
        *   Purchase history.
        *   Browsing patterns (time spent on pages, product categories visited).
        *   Explicitly saved preferences (wishlists, saved searches).
        *   Social media connections (if permission granted, to infer interests).
    *   Analyze this data to assign a probability distribution across the pre-defined personas for each user.  A user might be 70% “Budget Shopper”, 20% “Technical Expert”, 10% “Luxury Enthusiast”.

3.  **Real-Time Persona Inference:**
    *   During a search session, monitor user behavior *within* that session:
        *   Keywords used (e.g., “cheap”, “premium”, “high-end”, “powerful”).
        *   Filtering criteria (price range, brand selection, feature choices).
        *   Click-through rates on different result types.
        *   Time spent viewing each result.
    *   Update the persona probability distribution in real-time based on this session data.  A user initially classified as 70% “Budget Shopper” might shift to 50% if they start clicking on premium products.

4.  **Dynamic Search Ranking:**
    *   Before presenting results, re-rank them based on the user’s inferred persona.
    *   Apply weights to product features and attributes according to the active persona. For example:
        *   “Budget Shopper”: prioritize products with low prices and high discount percentages.
        *   “Luxury Enthusiast”: prioritize products from high-end brands and with premium materials.
        *   “Technical Expert”: prioritize products with detailed specifications and positive technical reviews.
    *   This ranking adjustment occurs *before* any explicit relevance feedback is received.

5.  **Implicit Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor user behavior *after* the re-ranked results are presented.
    *   Track:
        *   Click-through rates on the re-ranked results.
        *   Time spent viewing each result.
        *   Purchase conversions.
    *   Use this data to refine the persona probability distribution and the ranking weights.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function reRankSearchResults(searchResults, userProfile):
  userPersonaProbabilities = calculateUserPersonaProbabilities(userProfile)

  for each product in searchResults:
    productScore = baseSearchScore(product)  // Initial score from standard search

    for each persona in personas:
      personaWeight = userPersonaProbabilities[persona]
      personaRelevanceScore = calculatePersonaRelevance(product, persona)
      productScore += personaWeight * personaRelevanceScore

    rankedProduct.score = productScore
  return sorted(rankedProduct)

function calculatePersonaRelevance(product, persona):
  // Logic to assess how well the product matches the persona's preferences
  // based on product attributes and persona criteria.
  // Example:
  if persona == "Budget Shopper":
    return product.price * -1 + product.discount * 1
  elif persona == "Luxury Enthusiast":
    return product.brandPrestige * 1 + product.materialQuality * 1
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **A/B Testing of Persona-Based Ranking:**  Continuously experiment with different ranking algorithms to optimize performance.
*   **Personalized Facet Ordering:**  Dynamically order search facets (filters) based on the user’s inferred persona.
*   **Proactive Recommendations:**  Suggest products that align with the user’s inferred persona, even before they start searching.
