**Secure Attestation & Dynamic Root of Trust for Edge Devices**

**Specification:** A system enabling dynamic, remote attestation and a movable root of trust for resource-constrained edge devices. This leverages ephemeral, hardware-backed key generation and a distributed ledger for trust anchoring.

**Components:**

1.  **Ephemeral Key Provisioner (EKP):** Runs on a central server/cloud infrastructure. Responsible for generating short-lived, asymmetric key pairs. Keys are generated using a Hardware Security Module (HSM) for true randomness and protection.

2.  **Edge Device Attestation Agent (EDAA):** Embedded software on the edge device.  Includes a minimal cryptographic library and communication stack.

3.  **Distributed Ledger (DL):** A permissioned blockchain or similar distributed ledger technology. Stores cryptographic hashes of attested device configurations and public keys.

4.  **Attestation Server (AS):** Verifies attestation requests against the DL and provides validation responses.

**Operation:**

1.  **Device Boot & Key Request:** Upon boot, the EDAA requests a short-lived key pair from the EKP.  The request includes device identifiers and a timestamp.

2.  **Key Generation & Delivery:** The EKP generates a new key pair using the HSM. The private key is encrypted using a key derived from the device identifier and timestamp, and securely transmitted to the EDAA.

3.  **Configuration Reporting & Signing:** The EDAA gathers configuration data (firmware version, software state, hardware details) and signs it using the newly generated private key.

4.  **Attestation Request:** The EDAA sends an attestation request to the AS. This request contains the signed configuration data, the device's public key, and a timestamp.

5.  **Verification & Anchoring:** The AS verifies the signature using the provided public key. It then checks the configuration data against known good configurations and a 'trust policy'. If valid, the AS calculates a hash of the configuration data and anchors it (along with the public key and timestamp) on the DL.  It sends a success response to the EDAA.

6.  **Dynamic Root of Trust:**  Subsequent communications from the edge device are authenticated using a session key derived from the anchored configuration hash and a challenge from the AS.  This creates a dynamic root of trust based on the device's current attested state.

**Pseudocode (EDAA - simplified):**

```
function boot():
  device_id = get_device_id()
  timestamp = get_current_timestamp()
  request = create_key_request(device_id, timestamp)
  (public_key, private_key) = request_key_from_EKP(request)

  configuration_data = get_device_configuration()
  signed_configuration = sign_data(configuration_data, private_key)

  attestation_request = create_attestation_request(signed_configuration, public_key)
  attestation_response = send_attestation_request_to_AS(attestation_request)

  if attestation_response.success:
    root_of_trust = attestation_response.configuration_hash
    //Secure communication channel established using root_of_trust
  else:
    //Handle attestation failure â€“ device may enter safe mode/fail closed
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Edge Device: Minimal processing power, sufficient memory to run EDAA, secure storage for private key (even temporary).
*   EKP Server: HSM for key generation, secure network connection.
*   AS Server: Secure network connection, access to DL.

**Novelty:**

*   **Ephemeral Keys:** Reduces attack surface compared to long-lived keys.
*   **DL Anchoring:** Creates a tamper-proof record of device configuration.
*   **Dynamic Root of Trust:** Enables secure communication based on attested state, not static credentials.
*   **Resilience:**  If a device's configuration changes, a new attestation cycle is required, preventing unauthorized modifications.
