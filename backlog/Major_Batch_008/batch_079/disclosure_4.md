## Autonomous Predictive Maintenance System – Shelf-Edge Robotics

**System Overview:**

A distributed robotic system integrated with the existing device state notification framework, focused on *proactive* intervention at the shelf level. Rather than simply reporting device failures (camera, weight sensor), this system predicts potential failures *before* they occur, and autonomously attempts remediation.

**Components:**

1.  **Shelf-Edge Robots (SERs):** Small, lightweight robots (approx. 10cm x 10cm x 5cm) physically mounted to the shelf edge. Each SER is equipped with:
    *   Miniature articulated arm with interchangeable end-effectors (soft brush, compressed air nozzle, small suction cup).
    *   Local processing unit (Raspberry Pi equivalent).
    *   Short-range wireless communication (UWB/Zigbee) – for SER-to-SER and SER-to-Gateway communication.
    *   Capacitive touch sensors – for detecting presence/absence of items on the shelf.
    *   Ambient light sensor – to monitor lighting conditions.
2.  **Gateway Device:** A central hub responsible for:
    *   Aggregating data from SERs.
    *   Communicating with the existing Device State Notification Service (DSNS).
    *   Running predictive maintenance models.
    *   Providing high-level control to SERs.
3.  **Software Stack:**
    *   **SER Firmware:** Handles sensor data acquisition, basic local control, and communication.
    *   **Gateway Software:**  Implements data aggregation, predictive modeling, task scheduling, and DSNS integration.  Utilizes a time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB) for storing sensor data.
    *   **Predictive Maintenance Models:** Trained on historical sensor data to predict potential failures of cameras and weight sensors. Models could include:
        *   **Camera:** Image quality degradation prediction (blur, noise, color cast).  Analyzes image histograms and edge detection metrics.
        *   **Weight Sensor:** Drift prediction. Analyzes calibration data and identifies patterns indicative of sensor malfunction.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:** SERs continuously monitor shelf conditions:
    *   Item presence/absence using capacitive touch sensors.
    *   Ambient light levels.
    *   Periodically request snapshots from the camera (low-resolution thumbnails).
2.  **Data Processing & Prediction:** Gateway aggregates data from SERs and runs predictive maintenance models.
3.  **Autonomous Remediation:** If a potential failure is predicted:
    *   **Camera Dust/Obstruction:** SER arm gently brushes the camera lens.
    *   **Camera Low Light:** SER arm adjusts the position of an integrated miniature LED light source (if available) or alerts maintenance if lighting is insufficient.
    *   **Weight Sensor Drift:**  Gateway initiates a calibration sequence. SER arm temporarily removes items from the affected shelf area to facilitate accurate calibration.
4.  **Status Reporting:** Gateway updates the DSNS with the current status of each device and any autonomous actions taken. The DSNS then communicates this information to relevant services.

**Pseudocode (Gateway - Predictive Maintenance Loop):**

```
while True:
  sensor_data = receive_sensor_data_from_SERs()
  predicted_camera_failure = predict_camera_failure(sensor_data)
  predicted_weight_sensor_drift = predict_weight_sensor_drift(sensor_data)

  if predicted_camera_failure:
    send_command_to_SER(affected_SER_ID, "clean_camera_lens")
    update_DSNS(camera_ID, "autonomous_cleaning_initiated")
  if predicted_weight_sensor_drift:
    send_command_to_SER(affected_SER_ID, "remove_items_for_calibration")
    trigger_weight_sensor_calibration(weight_sensor_ID)
    update_DSNS(weight_sensor_ID, "calibration_initiated")
  sleep(5) # Check every 5 seconds
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond passive monitoring to *active* maintenance. By deploying robotic agents at the shelf edge, it enables autonomous remediation of common issues *before* they impact operations.  The integration with the existing DSNS provides a comprehensive view of device health and allows for proactive intervention. The system adds a physical layer to the existing notification system, moving from 'informed' to 'self-healing'.
