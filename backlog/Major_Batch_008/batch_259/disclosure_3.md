## Dynamic Structural Weighting for Document Classification

**Concept:** Expand on the complexity value metric by dynamically weighting structural elements based on their predictive power *during* the training phase, rather than relying solely on maximum depth or tag count. This allows the classifier to learn which structural features are *most* indicative of specific document classes.

**Specs:**

1.  **Training Data Preparation:**
    *   Augment training documents with "structural feature scores." These scores represent the predictive power of each HTML tag (or structural element) *for each document class*.
    *   Initial scores can be uniform (e.g., 1.0 for all tags/classes).
    *   During training, these scores will be updated based on classification performance.

2.  **Training Algorithm:**
    *   For each training document:
        *   Parse HTML structure into a text string of tags as described in the provided patent.
        *   Generate N-grams.
        *   For each N-gram:
            *   Identify the structural element (HTML tag) it represents.
            *   Calculate the 'contribution' of that N-gram to the *correct* document class. This could be a weighted score based on the Naive Bayesian probability or a similar metric.
            *   Update the structural feature score for that tag *for that document class* by adding a small fraction of the contribution.  (e.g., `score = score + 0.01 * contribution`)
            *   For incorrect classifications, *subtract* a fraction of the contribution, penalizing elements that led to misclassification.
        *   Re-normalize the structural feature scores for each document class after each training iteration to ensure values remain within a manageable range.

3.  **Classification Phase:**
    *   When classifying a new document:
        *   Parse the HTML structure and generate N-grams.
        *   For each N-gram, retrieve the corresponding structural feature score *for the document class being evaluated*.
        *   Multiply the N-gram's contribution to the probability calculation by this score.  This amplifies the influence of "important" structural elements and diminishes the influence of irrelevant ones.

**Pseudocode (Classification Phase â€“ Simplified):**

```
function classifyDocument(document, trainedModel):
  ngrams = generateNgrams(document)
  probabilities = {}

  for each class in trainedModel.classes:
    probability = 1.0  # Initialize probability
    for ngram in ngrams:
      tag = ngram.tag
      score = trainedModel.getStructuralScore(tag, class)  # Retrieve dynamic score
      probability *= (ngram.contribution * score)  # Weighted contribution

    probabilities[class] = probability

  # Return the class with the highest probability
  return argmax(probabilities)
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   This system could be implemented as a software module integrated into an existing document classification pipeline.
*   Requires sufficient memory to store and update structural feature scores for each tag and document class.
*   The learning rate (how quickly scores are updated) will require tuning to achieve optimal performance.
*   Consider utilizing parallel processing to speed up training and classification.
