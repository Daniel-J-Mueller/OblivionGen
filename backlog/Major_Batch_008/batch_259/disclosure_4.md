## Adaptive Content 'Breathing' - Specification

**Core Concept:** Leverage gaze tracking *not* to directly control scrolling, but to subtly animate content – a ‘breathing’ effect – to maintain engagement and reduce cognitive load. This isn’t about speed, it’s about drawing the eye *without* explicit control.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing gaze tracking hardware as described in the source patent (camera/IR).
*   High refresh rate display (minimum 120Hz preferred) to ensure smooth animation.
*   Processing unit capable of real-time image analysis & animation rendering.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Gaze Stability Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Raw gaze coordinates (x,y) from the tracking system.
    *   Process: Calculate a 'stability score' based on gaze velocity and acceleration. Low velocity/acceleration = high stability. Apply a smoothing filter (Kalman or similar) to reduce jitter.
    *   Output: Stability score (0-100) and smoothed gaze coordinates.

2.  **Content Animation Engine:**
    *   Input: Stability score, gaze coordinates, content type (text, image, video).
    *   Process: 
        *   **Content Type Classification:** Determine if the content is primarily textual, visual, or mixed.
        *   **Animation Parameter Generation:**  Based on content type and stability score, generate animation parameters:
            *   **Text:** Subtle vertical scaling (0.98-1.02) and horizontal shifting (-2 to +2 pixels). Frequency modulated by stability score – higher stability = slower animation.
            *   **Images:**  Slight color adjustments (brightness/contrast variation +/- 2%), small rotational shifts (-0.1 to +0.1 degrees), and parallax effect based on gaze location.
            *   **Video:** Frame rate variation (+/- 1 FPS).  Subtle masking/unmasking of the edges of the video.
        *   **Animation Rendering:** Apply the generated parameters to the content in real-time.  Ensure animations are smooth and non-distracting.

3.  **Engagement Metric Tracker:**
    *   Input: Gaze data, interaction data (e.g. clicks, selections), content consumption time.
    *   Process: Calculate engagement metrics (e.g. time spent viewing content, gaze dwell time, eye movement patterns).
    *   Output: Engagement data for use in adaptive animation refinement.

**Pseudocode (Animation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION ApplyAnimation(content, gazeX, gazeY, stabilityScore, contentType)
  stabilityFactor = Map(stabilityScore, 0, 100, 0.2, 1.0) // Scale stability to animation intensity

  IF contentType == "text" THEN
    verticalScale = 1.0 + (Sin(Time * stabilityFactor) * 0.02) // Gentle vertical oscillation
    horizontalShift = Cos(Time * stabilityFactor) * 2 // Subtle horizontal shift
    ApplyTransformation(content, verticalScale, horizontalShift)
  ELSE IF contentType == "image" THEN
    brightnessVariation = Sin(Time * stabilityFactor) * 2
    contrastVariation = Cos(Time * stabilityFactor) * 2
    rotationAngle = Sin(Time * stabilityFactor) * 0.1
    ApplyColorAndRotation(content, brightnessVariation, contrastVariation, rotationAngle)
  ELSE IF contentType == "video" THEN
    frameRateVariation = Sin(Time * stabilityFactor) * 1
    SetVideoFrameRate(content, BaseFrameRate + frameRateVariation)
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Operational Logic:**

1.  The Gaze Stability Analyzer continuously tracks the user's gaze.
2.  The Content Animation Engine receives gaze data and content type information.
3.  Based on the stability score and content type, the engine generates animation parameters.
4.  The engine applies these parameters to the content in real-time.
5.  The Engagement Metric Tracker monitors user engagement and provides feedback for adaptive refinement of the animation parameters.

**Refinement Considerations:**

*   **User Profiles:** Allow users to customize the intensity and type of animation.
*   **Content Sensitivity:**  Certain content (e.g. financial data) may require minimal or no animation.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The system should learn from user engagement data to optimize animation parameters over time.
*   **Multi-User Environments:** Consider how to handle multiple users with different gaze patterns.
