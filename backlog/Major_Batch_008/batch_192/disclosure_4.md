## Dynamic Haptic-Visual POI "Echolocation"

**Concept:** Extend the ideogram-based POI system with synchronized haptic feedback, creating a localized “echolocation” effect for users navigating a map.  Instead of *just* visually differentiating POIs, we provide a nuanced haptic "pulse" that strengthens the user's spatial understanding, particularly useful for accessibility or information-rich environments.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Device:** Integrated with a wearable device (smartwatch, glove, or dedicated band) capable of localized tactile feedback – multiple actuators are critical.
*   **POI Data Layer:**  Expand existing POI data to include "Haptic Profile" attributes:
    *   *Intensity:*  Overall strength of the haptic pulse.
    *   *Texture:*  Type of haptic feedback (vibration, pulse, ripple, etc.).
    *   *Directionality:*  Specifies which actuators on the haptic device should activate, creating a sense of direction toward the POI.  This utilizes multiple actuators.
    *   *Frequency:* The rate of the haptic pulse.
    *   *Pattern:* A complex sequence of actuator activations.
*   **Rendering Engine:** Develop a rendering engine that translates POI data into haptic commands.
    *   *Distance Mapping:*  Calculate the distance between the user’s location and each POI.
    *   *Haptic Intensity Scaling:*  Scale haptic intensity based on distance – closer POIs have stronger feedback.
    *   *Collision Avoidance:*  If multiple POIs are in close proximity, prioritize haptic feedback based on POI importance or user preferences. Use differing *frequencies* to differentiate.
    *   *Synchronization:*  Synchronize haptic feedback with visual ideogram updates.
*   **User Interface:** Allow users to customize haptic profiles:
    *   *Haptic Strength Adjustment*
    *   *Profile Selection:* Pre-defined profiles (e.g., “Quiet Mode”, “Navigation Focus”, “Detailed Exploration”).
    *   *POI Filtering:* Specify which types of POIs should generate haptic feedback.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function renderPOI(userLocation, poiList) {
  for each poi in poiList {
    distance = calculateDistance(userLocation, poi.location)
    intensity = map(distance, 0, maxDistance, maxIntensity, 0)
    texture = poi.hapticProfile.texture
    direction = calculateDirection(userLocation, poi.location)

    if (poi.hapticProfile.enabled) {
      activateHapticActuators(direction, intensity, texture)
    }
  }
}

function activateHapticActuators(direction, intensity, texture) {
  // Determine which actuators to activate based on direction
  actuatorList = calculateActuatorList(direction)

  // Set intensity and texture for each actuator
  for each actuator in actuatorList {
    setActuatorIntensity(actuator, intensity)
    setActuatorTexture(actuator, texture)
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  Current systems focus almost exclusively on visual cues. This introduces a *multimodal* system. The focus on directional haptics – specifically utilizing multiple actuators – creates a nuanced sense of location and proximity that significantly enhances spatial awareness and accessibility. The pseudocode focuses on the rendering engine.
