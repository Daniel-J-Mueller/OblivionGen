## Dynamic Hardware Root of Trust Provisioning

**Concept:** Leverage the hardware-emulated cryptographic device concept to create a dynamically provisioned, hardware-rooted trust anchor for edge devices – specifically, IoT sensors and actuators lacking inherent secure elements. This shifts the secure element *away* from being embedded in the device and *onto* a managed service.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Interface:** Utilize a standardized, low-power physical layer – potentially a variation of USB 2.0 or a lightweight serial protocol – for communication between the edge device and a ‘Trust Beacon’ – a small, hardened device containing the cryptographic interface controller. This beacon acts as a localized anchor point.
*   **Beacon Hardware:** The Trust Beacon houses a cryptographic interface controller (as per the original patent) and a minimal processor. It *does not* store cryptographic keys. It only manages the communication channel and hardware emulation.
*   **Key Management:**  All cryptographic keys reside in a centralized, secure key management system (KMS) operated by the service provider or, optionally, under customer control (HSM integration – extending Claim 10).
*   **Device Onboarding:**
    1.  Edge device powers on and establishes a communication link with the nearest Trust Beacon.
    2.  Device transmits a unique identifier (UID) to the beacon.
    3.  Beacon forwards the UID to the KMS.
    4.  KMS provisions a unique key pair (asymmetric) associated with the device UID.  The *private key never leaves the KMS*.
    5.  KMS returns a certificate chain (or other authentication material) to the beacon, signed with a key trusted by the edge device.
    6.  Beacon provisions a hardware-emulated cryptographic device (as in the patent) and establishes a secure channel with the edge device.
*   **Cryptographic Operations:**
    1.  Edge device initiates a cryptographic operation (e.g., signing data, encrypting a message).
    2.  Request is sent to the hardware-emulated cryptographic device.
    3.  The hardware-emulated device forwards the request to the central KMS via the beacon.
    4.  KMS performs the cryptographic operation using the private key associated with the device UID.
    5.  Result is returned to the hardware-emulated device, then to the edge device.

**Pseudocode (Edge Device - Cryptographic Operation):**

```
function perform_operation(data, operation_type):
  connection = establish_connection_with_beacon()
  emulated_device = connect_to_emulated_cryptographic_device(connection)
  request = create_cryptographic_request(data, operation_type)
  response = send_request_and_receive_response(emulated_device, request)
  disconnect(emulated_device)
  disconnect(connection)
  return response
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Decentralized Secure Element:** Moves the costly and complex secure element off the edge device and onto a manageable service infrastructure.
*   **Dynamic Provisioning:** Enables secure onboarding and key management for a large number of edge devices.
*   **Scalability:** The Trust Beacon infrastructure can be scaled to support massive deployments.
*   **Centralized Control:** Provides centralized key management and access control.
