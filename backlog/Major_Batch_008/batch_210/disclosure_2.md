## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & Filtering

**Concept:** Extend the existing notification system to incorporate dynamic prioritization and filtering based on real-time system load and operational context.  Instead of simply queuing notifications, introduce a tiered system where high-priority notifications preempt lower-priority ones and a filtering mechanism selectively discards less critical information under heavy load.

**Specifications:**

**1. Priority Levels:**

*   **Critical (0):**  Immediate attention required. Examples: Hardware errors, synchronization failures impacting core functionality.  Always transmitted, even under extreme load.
*   **High (1):**  Important information for debugging or performance analysis.  Transmission prioritized over Medium and Low.
*   **Medium (2):**  Standard operational notifications.  Transmitted when bandwidth allows.
*   **Low (3):**  Detailed tracing or verbose logging.  Discarded first under load.

**2. Dynamic Load Monitoring:**

*   Integrated hardware/software monitor tracking CPU utilization, memory bandwidth, and communication bus load.
*   Real-time calculation of a “System Load Factor” (SLF) ranging from 0.0 (idle) to 1.0 (saturated).
*   SLF directly influences the number of notifications transmitted per priority level.

**3.  Notification Filtering Logic:**

*   Each priority level associated with a configurable filter threshold.
*   Thresholds defined as a percentage of the SLF.
*   Example: High priority notifications only transmitted if SLF < 0.75.
*   Filtering performed *before* queuing, reducing unnecessary data transfer.

**4. Preemptive Queuing:**

*   Multiple queues per priority level.
*   Critical priority queue always processed first.
*   Higher priority notifications preempt lower priority ones within their respective queues.
*   Implementation uses a priority-based scheduler within the integrated circuit.

**5.  Configuration Register Set:**

*   `Notification_Enable_Register`:  Global enable/disable for the notification system.
*   `Priority_Threshold_Register[4]`:  Configures the SLF threshold for each priority level.
*   `Queue_Size_Register[4]`: Configures the size of each priority queue.
*   `Filter_Enable_Register`: Enables/disables the filtering mechanism.

**6. Pseudocode - Notification Generation & Filtering:**

```
// Inside the Integrated Circuit
function generate_notification(type, timestamp, internal_status) {
  priority = get_notification_priority(type)  // Determine priority based on type
  if (filter_enabled && system_load_factor > priority_threshold[priority]) {
    // Notification dropped
    return
  }

  notification = create_notification(type, timestamp, internal_status)

  // Access appropriate priority queue
  queue = priority_queue[priority]

  // Check queue full status
  if (queue.is_full()) {
    // Stall execution or discard (configurable)
    if(discard_on_full) {
        // drop the notification
        return
    }
    // Stall execution if configured
    stall_execution()
    
  }
  
  queue.enqueue(notification)
}
```

**7.  Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated hardware logic for SLF calculation and filtering decisions.
*   Sufficient on-chip memory for priority queues.
*   DMA engine for efficient transfer of notifications to processor memory.
