## Adaptive Packet Reconstruction with Temporal Context

**Concept:** Extend network visibility beyond flow metadata and sampled packets by reconstructing full packets based on identified flow characteristics and temporal patterns, even when initial capture is incomplete due to buffer overflows or deliberate obfuscation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Dedicated FPGA/ASIC core integrated alongside existing packet processing pipeline. Requires high-speed memory (HBM preferred) for packet buffer storage.
*   **Software:** Kernel module/driver for integration with network interface card (NIC) and packet capture framework (e.g., PF\_RING, DPDK). User-space application for configuration, control, and reconstructed packet output.

**Functional Description:**

1.  **Flow Profiling:** Analyze initial packets of each flow to establish a baseline ‘packet signature’. This signature includes:
    *   Packet size distribution (mean, standard deviation, mode).
    *   Inter-packet arrival time distribution.
    *   Header field patterns (e.g., TTL, DSCP, TCP flags).
    *   Payload entropy (rough estimate of data compressibility).

2.  **Partial Packet Capture:** Standard packet capture process, but with emphasis on capturing *at least* the initial portion of each packet (e.g., enough for IP/TCP header identification).

3.  **Reconstruction Trigger:** When a partial packet is captured, the system checks for matching flow profiles.

4.  **Temporal Prediction:** If a match is found, the system predicts the missing packet data based on:
    *   **Markov Model:** Predict next byte sequence based on previously observed byte sequences within the flow.  Use a limited-order Markov model to reduce computational complexity.
    *   **Size Prediction:**  Predict packet size based on the established size distribution for the flow.
    *   **Arrival Time Smoothing:** Use inter-packet arrival time smoothing to account for network jitter.
    *   **Header Completion:** Reconstruct missing header fields based on established patterns.

5.  **Reconstruction Validation:**
    *   **Checksum Verification:** Recalculate IP/TCP/UDP checksums to validate reconstructed packets.
    *   **Entropy Check:** Compare entropy of reconstructed payload to expected entropy based on flow profile. Significant discrepancies trigger reconstruction failure.

6.  **Output:** Output reconstructed packets alongside standard captured packets. Include a flag indicating whether reconstruction occurred and its confidence level.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Trigger & Validation):**

```
function reconstruct_packet(partial_packet):
  flow_id = extract_flow_id(partial_packet)
  flow_profile = get_flow_profile(flow_id)

  if flow_profile is null:
    // Flow not yet profiled – discard packet or initiate profiling
    return null

  predicted_size = predict_packet_size(flow_profile)
  predicted_payload = predict_payload(flow_profile, partial_packet.payload)

  reconstructed_packet = combine(partial_packet, predicted_payload)
  
  if validate_checksum(reconstructed_packet):
    if validate_entropy(reconstructed_packet, flow_profile):
      return reconstructed_packet  // Successful Reconstruction
    else:
      return null // Entropy validation failed
  else:
    return null // Checksum validation failed
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Intrusion Detection:** Reconstructing full packets allows for more thorough deep packet inspection, even in cases where initial capture is incomplete.
*   **Network Forensics:** Recovering lost or fragmented packets aids in incident investigation.
*   **Application Performance Monitoring:**  Detailed packet analysis provides insights into application behavior.
*   **Traffic Shaping:**  Accurate packet size information allows for more effective traffic shaping.
