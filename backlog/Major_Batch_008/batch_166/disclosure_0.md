## Dynamic Data Masking & Anonymization with User-Defined “Sensitivity Profiles”

**System Specifications:**

**I. Core Functionality:** Extend the existing rule builder to incorporate a data masking and anonymization layer *before* pattern identification. This system focuses on user control over data privacy during the exploratory data analysis process.

**II. User Interface Additions:**

*   **Sensitivity Profile Editor:** A new UI panel allowing users to define “Sensitivity Profiles.” These profiles contain rules specifying how different data types (e.g., names, addresses, credit card numbers, medical records) should be treated. Rules could include:
    *   **Redaction:** Complete removal of the data.
    *   **Tokenization:** Replacement with a unique, non-identifiable token.
    *   **Generalization:** Replacing specific values with broader categories (e.g., age 32 becomes age 30-39).
    *   **Pseudonymization:** Replacing identifiable data with pseudonyms (consistent but non-identifiable).
    *   **Noise Addition:**  Adding random noise to numeric data.
    *   **Shuffling:** Reordering data within a column.
*   **Column Mapping:** Within the Sensitivity Profile Editor, users map columns from the data set to predefined data types or create custom data types.
*   **Profile Application Toggle:**  A switch within the primary UI allowing users to enable/disable the Sensitivity Profile during data loading and rule building.  Enabling applies masking *before* the pattern identification process.
*   **Masking Preview:** A real-time preview of the masked data within the UI.

**III. System Architecture & Pseudocode:**

1.  **Data Loading & Masking:**
    ```pseudocode
    function loadData(dataset, sensitivityProfileEnabled):
        if sensitivityProfileEnabled:
            maskedDataset = applySensitivityProfile(dataset, loadedSensitivityProfile)
        else:
            maskedDataset = dataset
        return maskedDataset
    ```
2.  **`applySensitivityProfile(dataset, profile)` Function:**
    ```pseudocode
    function applySensitivityProfile(dataset, profile):
        for each column in dataset:
            columnName = column.name
            if columnName in profile:
                columnType = profile[columnName].type
                if columnType == "Redaction":
                    column.data = replaceAll(column.data, "REDACTED")
                elif columnType == "Tokenization":
                    tokenMap = generateTokenMap(column.data)
                    column.data = applyTokenMap(column.data, tokenMap)
                //Implement similar logic for other masking types
            //If column not in profile, leave data untouched
        return maskedDataset
    ```
3.  **Integration with Rule Builder:** The existing rule builder functionality operates on the *masked* dataset. This ensures that pattern identification happens without direct access to sensitive information.

**IV.  Advanced Features (Future Considerations):**

*   **Differential Privacy Integration:** Implement algorithms to add controlled noise to the data, providing stronger privacy guarantees.
*   **Audit Logging:** Track all masking operations and user actions for compliance and accountability.
*   **Dynamic Masking:**  Adjust masking rules based on user roles or data access permissions.
*   **Automated Sensitivity Detection:**  Use machine learning to automatically identify potentially sensitive data columns.
