## Adaptive Rack Cooling with Dynamic Airflow Shunting

**System Overview:** A rack-level thermal management system that dynamically adjusts airflow based on component heat signatures and rack density, maximizing cooling efficiency and enabling higher rack densities. This builds *from* the air moving device concept in claim 12, but moves beyond simply *moving* air to actively *shunting* it.

**Core Components:**

*   **Thermal Mapping Array:** An array of infrared (IR) sensors integrated into each rack unit (RU) space. These sensors continuously monitor the temperature of components within the RU, generating a real-time thermal map.
*   **Micro-Duct Array:** A dense array of micro-ducts embedded within the rack structure. These ducts are connected to a central manifold system. Each RU space contains inlet and outlet connections to the micro-duct array.
*   **Micro-Fan Matrix:** Miniature, digitally-controlled fans integrated within the micro-duct array. These fans direct airflow to specific RU spaces based on thermal map data.
*   **Central Control Unit (CCU):** A dedicated processor that receives thermal map data, calculates optimal airflow configurations, and controls the micro-fan matrix.
*   **Rack Power Distribution Unit (PDU) Integration:** The CCU communicates with the PDU to correlate power draw with thermal output, improving thermal modeling accuracy.
*   **Dynamic Airflow Shunts:** Physical dampers located at the junctions of the micro-ducts, enabling precise airflow routing.

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Thermal Mapping Array
Initialize Micro-Fan Matrix
Initialize Dynamic Airflow Shunts
Establish Communication with PDU

// Main Loop
While (Rack is Operational) {
    // 1. Data Acquisition
    ThermalMap = Read Thermal Mapping Array
    PowerDraw = Read PowerDraw from PDU

    // 2. Thermal Analysis
    HotSpots = Identify HotSpots in ThermalMap
    CriticalComponents = Identify CriticalComponents (based on config)

    // 3. Airflow Optimization
    For Each HotSpot {
        TargetRU = HotSpot's RU Location
        AirflowRate = Calculate AirflowRate (based on HeatOutput, Criticality)
        Set AirflowRate for TargetRU
        Adjust Dynamic Airflow Shunts to Route Airflow to TargetRU
    }

    // 4. Fan Speed Control
    For Each RU {
        FanSpeed = Calculate FanSpeed (based on AirflowRate)
        Set FanSpeed for RU's Micro-Fans
    }

    // 5. System Monitoring & Reporting
    Log Thermal Data, Airflow Rates, Fan Speeds
    Report Anomalies (overheating, fan failure)
}
```
