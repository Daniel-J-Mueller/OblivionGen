## Dynamic User Interface "Mood" Generation

**Concept:** Extend the contextual UI customization beyond simply *what* content is displayed, to *how* it’s displayed – a dynamic “mood” generation based on user behavior, time of day, and potentially even external data sources (weather, news sentiment). This goes beyond visual themes; it alters micro-interactions, animation styles, and even the degree of “verbosity” in displayed information.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Mood Engine:**

*   **Input Parameters:**
    *   `userID`: Unique identifier for the user.
    *   `webHostID`: Unique identifier for the requesting web host.
    *   `timeOfDay`: Current time, categorized (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night).
    *   `userActivityScore`:  A rolling average of user actions (clicks, scrolls, form submissions) over the last X minutes. Higher score indicates higher engagement.
    *   `externalContext`: (Optional) Data from external APIs (Weather: Sunny, Rainy; News Sentiment: Positive, Negative).
*   **Mood Profiles:** A database of pre-defined "moods", each characterized by a set of parameters:
    *   `colorPalette`: Primary and secondary colors.
    *   `animationStyle`: (e.g., "Subtle", "Playful", "Energetic", "Calm"). Defines transition effects, loading animations, etc.
    *   `interactionDensity`: Controls the frequency and intensity of micro-interactions (e.g., button hover effects, feedback animations).
    *   `verbosityLevel`: Controls the amount of explanatory text displayed. (e.g., “Concise”, “Detailed”).
    *   `fontStyle`: Primary and secondary fonts, weights.
*   **Mood Selection Algorithm:**
    *   Based on input parameters, the algorithm selects the most appropriate mood profile.
    *   A weighted scoring system can be used to combine the influence of different parameters. (e.g., Time of day: 30%, User Activity: 50%, External Context: 20%).
    *   The algorithm can also incorporate machine learning to personalize mood selection based on user preferences and behavior.

**2. UI Component Integration:**

*   All UI components must be designed to be "mood-aware".
*   Components should receive mood parameters (color palette, animation style, etc.) and adjust their rendering accordingly.
*   A central “Mood Service” provides the current mood parameters to all UI components.
*   Components can subscribe to the Mood Service to receive updates when the mood changes.

**3. Dynamic Adjustment & Learning:**

*   The system should continuously monitor user behavior and adjust the mood in real-time.
*   If the user appears frustrated (e.g., rapid mouse movements, repeated errors), the system can switch to a "Calm" mood with reduced interaction density and more helpful guidance.
*   User feedback (e.g., explicit mood selection, "thumbs up/down" ratings) should be used to refine the mood selection algorithm.

**Pseudocode (Mood Selection Algorithm):**

```
function selectMood(userID, webHostID, timeOfDay, userActivityScore, externalContext) {
  // Fetch user preferences from database
  userPreferences = getUserPreferences(userID)

  // Calculate base mood score for each mood profile
  for each moodProfile in moodProfiles {
    moodScore = 0
    // Time of day influence
    if (moodProfile.timeOfDayPreference == timeOfDay) {
      moodScore += userPreferences.timeOfDayWeight
    }
    // User activity influence
    if (userActivityScore > moodProfile.activityThreshold) {
      moodScore += userPreferences.activityWeight
    }
    // External context influence
    if (externalContext == moodProfile.contextPreference) {
      moodScore += userPreferences.contextWeight
    }
    moodProfile.score = moodScore
  }

  // Sort mood profiles by score (descending)
  sortedMoodProfiles = sortMoodProfiles(moodProfiles)

  // Return the top-ranked mood profile
  return sortedMoodProfiles[0]
}
```

**4. API Endpoints:**

*   `/mood/request`: Requests the current mood parameters for a given user and web host.
*   `/mood/feedback`:  Provides user feedback on the current mood.
*   `/mood/override`: Allows an administrator to manually override the mood selection for a specific user or web host.
