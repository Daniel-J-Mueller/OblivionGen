## Dynamic Schema Evolution with Predictive Parsing

**Concept:** Extend the automatic schema generation to *dynamically* adapt to evolving data sources *and* proactively predict future schema changes based on data patterns. This moves beyond simply mapping a static description to a table and into a system that learns and anticipates.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Source Monitoring Module:**

*   **Function:** Continuously monitor the data source for schema drifts (e.g., new fields, changed data types).
*   **Implementation:** Utilize a background process that periodically samples the data source.
*   **Drift Detection:** Employ statistical methods (e.g., Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-squared test) to identify statistically significant differences in schema compared to the previously generated schema.
*   **Thresholding:** Configure drift detection sensitivity via adjustable thresholds.

**2. Predictive Parsing Engine:**

*   **Foundation:** Leverages the existing parser selection mechanism but adds a machine learning component.
*   **Training Data:**  Historical data from the data source, including schema versions and data content.
*   **Model:** Employ a sequence-to-sequence model (e.g., Transformer) trained to predict the next likely schema change given the current schema and recent data samples. This model does *not* attempt to perfectly predict, but to suggest possible evolutions.
*   **Confidence Scoring:**  Assign a confidence score to each predicted schema change.
*   **Parser Generation:** Adapt existing parsers or generate new ones based on the predicted changes.
*   **Staging:** Predicted parsers exist in a staging environment and only move to live environments once high confidence is established or a certain number of samples support the prediction.

**3. Adaptive Table Definition Manager:**

*   **Function:** Manage the output table schema based on both detected drifts and predicted changes.
*   **Versioning:** Maintain a history of table schemas.
*   **Schema Merging:**  Algorithm to intelligently merge changes from detected drifts and predicted changes.  Prioritize confirmed drifts.
*   **Column Handling:**
    *   **New Columns:** Add new columns with appropriate data types.
    *   **Data Type Changes:**  Handle data type conversions with validation and potential data loss warnings.
    *   **Column Removal:**  Mark columns as deprecated and provide a migration path for dependent applications.
*   **Automated Migration:** Support automated table schema migrations with minimal downtime.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Predictive Parsing):**

```
function predict_next_schema(current_schema, recent_data, historical_data, model):
  # Input: Current schema, recent data samples, historical data, trained ML model
  # Output: Predicted schema changes, confidence score

  # 1. Prepare Input:  Combine current schema and recent data into a feature vector
  feature_vector = prepare_feature_vector(current_schema, recent_data)

  # 2. Model Prediction: Use the ML model to predict the next schema change
  predicted_change = model.predict(feature_vector)

  # 3. Confidence Scoring: Calculate a confidence score based on model output and
  #    historical data supporting the predicted change.
  confidence_score = calculate_confidence(predicted_change, historical_data)

  return predicted_change, confidence_score

function calculate_confidence(predicted_change, historical_data):
    # Analyze historical data for similar schema changes
    # Higher frequency of similar changes increases confidence
    # Consider data volume and time period for accurate calculation
    # Return confidence score (0.0 - 1.0)

function prepare_feature_vector(current_schema, recent_data):
    # Extract relevant features from current schema and recent data
    # Examples: column names, data types, data distributions, data values
    # Combine features into a vector format suitable for ML model input
```

**Integration Points:**

*   **Existing Parser Selection:** The predictive parsing engine builds upon the existing system.
*   **Monitoring Infrastructure:** Leverage existing monitoring tools to track data source health and schema changes.
*   **Alerting System:** Notify administrators of significant schema drifts or high-confidence predicted changes.
