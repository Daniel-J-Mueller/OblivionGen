## Adaptive Query Re-writing via Learned Disjunct Importance

**Specification:** A system to dynamically rewrite disjunctive queries by learning the relative importance of each disjunct based on historical execution data and query context. This goes beyond simply adding/inferring disjuncts – it prioritizes and restructures them for optimal performance.

**Core Concept:** The system maintains a learned model (e.g., a lightweight neural network or decision tree) that predicts the cardinality (estimated number of rows returned) of each disjunct in a disjunctive query, given the query's parameters and historical execution statistics. This cardinality prediction is then used to re-order the disjuncts in the query plan, prioritizing those predicted to yield the most results.

**Components:**

1.  **Disjunct Profiler:** Monitors the execution of disjunctive queries, recording the cardinality of each disjunct, execution time, and relevant query parameters (e.g., values in `WHERE` clauses).
2.  **Importance Model Trainer:**  Periodically trains the importance model using the data collected by the Disjunct Profiler.  Features used for training include:
    *   Query parameters
    *   Table statistics (cardinality, index usage)
    *   Historical cardinality of disjuncts
3.  **Query Rewriter:**  Intercepts disjunctive queries *before* query planning.  
    *   Calls the Importance Model to predict the cardinality of each disjunct.
    *   Re-orders the disjuncts in the query based on predicted cardinality – higher cardinality disjuncts are placed earlier in the query.
    *   Optionally, applies cost-based optimization – if a disjunct's predicted cardinality is below a certain threshold, it may be temporarily removed from the plan and executed separately if needed (a sort of "lazy evaluation" for low-impact disjuncts).
4.  **Feedback Loop:** Monitors the actual execution time of rewritten queries and uses this information to refine the Importance Model – essentially, a reinforcement learning approach.

**Pseudocode (Query Rewriter):**

```
function rewrite_disjunctive_query(query):
  disjuncts = extract_disjuncts(query)
  
  cardinality_predictions = ImportanceModel.predict_cardinalities(disjuncts, query_parameters)
  
  sorted_disjuncts = sort_disjuncts_by_cardinality(disjuncts, cardinality_predictions, descending=True)
  
  rewritten_query = build_query_from_sorted_disjuncts(sorted_disjuncts)
  
  return rewritten_query
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `DisjunctProfile`:  Stores historical execution data for a specific disjunct (cardinality, execution time, query parameters).
*   `ImportanceModel`:  A trained machine learning model that predicts disjunct cardinality.
*   `QueryParameters`: A structured representation of the parameters used in the query.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant performance improvements for complex disjunctive queries.
*   Adaptive query optimization – the system learns and adjusts to changing data distributions and query patterns.
*   Reduced query latency.
*   Improved resource utilization.
