## Dynamic Data Provenance & Trust Scoring

**Concept:** Extend the data transformation policy system to include a dynamic provenance tracking and trust scoring mechanism. This goes beyond simply *applying* transformations, and instead focuses on establishing a verifiable history and confidence level for data as it moves through the system.

**Specifications:**

**1. Provenance Metadata Layer:**

*   Each data object will have an associated "Provenance Metadata Layer" (PML). This PML is appended to the data object (or linked via a secure ID) and persists through all transformations.
*   The PML will contain a chronological log of all transformations applied, including:
    *   Timestamp
    *   User/System ID initiating the transformation
    *   Policy ID triggering the transformation
    *   Specific parameters used in the transformation
    *   Cryptographic hash of the data *before* the transformation
    *   Cryptographic hash of the data *after* the transformation.
*   PML will utilize a Merkle Tree structure to ensure data integrity and efficient verification.  Modifications to the PML (e.g., adding a new transformation) require recalculating only the affected branches of the tree.

**2. Trust Scoring Algorithm:**

*   A Trust Score will be associated with each data object, initially set to a default value (e.g., 0.5).
*   The Trust Score will be dynamically adjusted based on the following factors:
    *   **Policy Reputation:** Each data transformation policy will have a "Reputation Score" based on historical usage, audit results, and feedback.  Policies frequently used without issue will gain higher scores. Policies involved in security incidents will lose score.
    *   **Transformation Confidence:** The confidence level of a transformation will be derived from its associated policyâ€™s Reputation Score and the success/failure rate of the transformation itself.
    *   **Data Source Trust:**  Trust levels can be assigned to data sources, influencing the initial Trust Score of any data originating from that source.
    *   **Chain of Custody:** A longer, verifiable chain of custody (as tracked in the PML) will generally increase the Trust Score.  Gaps or inconsistencies will decrease it.
    *   **Auditing:** Regular automated audits of the PML will verify data integrity and the validity of transformations.

**3. Policy-Driven Trust Adjustment:**

*   Data transformation policies will be able to *explicitly* adjust the Trust Score as part of the transformation process.  For example:
    *   A redaction policy might *decrease* the Trust Score due to data loss.
    *   An encryption policy might *increase* the Trust Score due to enhanced security.
*   Policies can define thresholds for Trust Score adjustments.

**4.  Trust-Aware Access Control:**

*   Access control rules will be able to incorporate Trust Score as a condition.  For example:
    *   Only allow access to data with a Trust Score above a certain threshold.
    *   Require multi-factor authentication for data with a low Trust Score.

**Pseudocode (Policy Execution):**

```
function executeTransformation(data, policy) {
  // 1. Record transformation in PML
  recordTransformation(data.pml, policy, data)

  // 2. Apply transformation
  transformedData = applyTransformation(data, policy)

  // 3. Adjust Trust Score (if policy specifies)
  if (policy.trustAdjustment != null) {
    transformedData.trustScore = transformedData.trustScore + policy.trustAdjustment
    transformedData.trustScore = clamp(transformedData.trustScore, 0, 1) // Ensure score remains within [0, 1]
  }

  return transformedData
}
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   PML storage: Scalable and tamper-proof storage (e.g., blockchain-inspired data structures or distributed ledger technologies).
*   Performance: Optimization of PML operations to minimize overhead.
*   Auditing: Automated auditing tools to verify PML integrity.
*   Policy Management:  User-friendly interface for defining and managing transformation policies and their associated trust adjustments.
