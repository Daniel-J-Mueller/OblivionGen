## Automated Bag Conformity & Material Property Assessment

**Concept:** Integrate material property sensing *during* the bag-around-item process to dynamically adjust air nozzle parameters and confirm bag integrity *before* item lift. This shifts from simply conforming the bag to also *qualifying* it.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Implement a multi-modal sensor array integrated into the mechanical gripper and/or mount. This includes:
    *   **Capacitive Sensor:** Measures bag film thickness/density.
    *   **Strain Gauge:** Detects stretch/deformation of the bag material.
    *   **Optical Sensor (Time-of-Flight):** Maps bag surface contours and detects tears/holes.
*   **Dynamic Air Control:** Replace the fixed air nozzle setup with an array of individually controllable micro-nozzles. Each nozzle's output (pressure, volume, direction) will be adjusted based on real-time sensor data.
*   **Real-Time Data Processing:** A dedicated onboard processor analyzes sensor data and controls the micro-nozzle array. This allows for closed-loop control of the bag conformity process.
*   **Pass/Fail Criteria:** Define acceptable ranges for sensor readings (thickness, strain, contour deviation). If readings fall outside these ranges, the system flags the bag as defective and initiates a retry or alerts an operator.
*   **Software Integration:** The application's machine-readable instructions should include:
    *   **Calibration Routine:** To establish baseline sensor readings for different bag materials and sizes.
    *   **Adaptive Algorithm:** Adjusts nozzle parameters based on sensor data.
    *   **Defect Detection Logic:** Identifies and flags defective bags.
    *   **Retry Mechanism:** Attempts to conform the bag again with adjusted parameters.
    *   **Data Logging:** Stores sensor data and defect information for analysis and quality control.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
CalibrateSensors()
SetBaselineValues()

//Bag Conformity Loop
While (BagNotConformed) {
    ActivateAirNozzles()
    ReadSensorData()
    AnalyzeSensorData()

    If (DefectDetected()) {
        DeactivateAirNozzles()
        LogDefect()
        If (RetryAllowed()) {
            AdjustAirNozzleParameters()
            ActivateAirNozzles()
        } Else {
            AlertOperator()
            Break
        }
    } Else {
        If (ConformityThresholdMet()) {
            BagNotConformed = False
        }
    }
}
//Post-Conformity Check
ConfirmBagIntegrity()
//Proceed with item lift
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply conforming the bag to include *validation* of the bag's structural integrity. The system proactively assesses the bag material's properties and adjusts its actions accordingly, reducing the risk of item drops or packaging failures. The dynamic air control system and adaptive algorithm allow for optimized bag conformity and defect detection.
