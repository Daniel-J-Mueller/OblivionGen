## Dynamic Inventory Prediction via Social Media Trend Aggregation

**Core Concept:** Leverage publicly available social media data (posts, images, video) to *predict* localized demand for items *before* a user even requests information. This shifts the system from reactive (responding to requests) to proactive (anticipating needs) and improves response times.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Social Media Listener Module:**
    *   Constantly monitors major social media platforms (Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, etc.) and relevant online forums.
    *   Employs natural language processing (NLP) and image recognition to identify mentions of products or product categories.
    *   Geotagging of posts to narrow down localized interest. Sentiment analysis to determine if the mention is positive/negative/neutral.
    *   Data stream normalization and cleaning.

2.  **Demand Prediction Engine:**
    *   Time series analysis of social media activity data.
    *   Correlation with historical sales data (if available - can be seeded with aggregate data).
    *   Machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks - RNNs, LSTMs) to predict localized demand for specific items.
    *   Dynamic weighting of social media signals based on platform reliability & historical correlation.
    *   Output: Probability distribution of demand for each item in each geographic area.

3.  **Pre-Contact Merchant Prioritization Module:**
    *   Based on predicted demand, prioritize merchants most likely to have the item in stock.
    *   Algorithm considers merchant inventory history, location, and predicted demand.
    *   Ranks merchants based on probability of fulfillment.

4.  **Proactive Contact System:**
    *   Automatically initiates contact with the *top-ranked* merchants *before* any user request is received.
    *   Contact method: prioritized based on merchant preference & real-time response rate (IVR, SMS, email).
    *   Message content: standardized request for current inventory & pricing, tailored to the item.
    *   Data caching: store responses for rapid retrieval.

5.  **Real-Time Availability Map:**
    *   Displays a map of nearby merchants with real-time inventory information.
    *   Visual cues: color-coding based on inventory level & estimated time to retrieval.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Social Media Listener collects data
  social_media_data = listener.collectData();

  // 2. Demand Prediction Engine analyzes data
  demand_predictions = predictionEngine.predictDemand(social_media_data);

  // 3. Merchant Prioritization module ranks merchants
  prioritized_merchants = prioritizationModule.rankMerchants(demand_predictions);

  // 4. Proactive Contact System reaches out
  for each merchant in prioritized_merchants:
    if (merchant not already contacted today):
      contact_merchant(merchant);
      cache_response(merchant);
}

// Function: contact_merchant(merchant)
// Initiate contact with merchant (IVR, SMS, etc.)
// Request inventory and pricing for predicted high-demand items

// Function: cache_response(merchant)
// Store merchant's response in a readily accessible cache
```

**Novelty:** This system inverts the typical request-response model. It doesn't wait for user requests; it anticipates them based on social media trends. This reduces latency, improves customer experience, and potentially allows for speculative inventory acquisition (e.g., pre-ordering from merchants with predicted high demand).
