## Systolic Array Reconfiguration for Sparse Tensor Operations

**Specification:** A dynamically reconfigurable systolic array architecture optimized for sparse tensor operations, leveraging bitmasking and data skipping to minimize unnecessary computations and memory access.

**Rationale:** The provided patent details focus on dense tensor transposition. Many machine learning workloads operate on sparse tensors. Current systolic array designs struggle with sparsity as they perform operations on all elements, even those that are zero, leading to wasted cycles and energy consumption. This design addresses that by dynamically adjusting the systolic array's connectivity and operation based on a bitmask representing the non-zero elements.

**Components:**

*   **Sparse Tensor Representation:** Input tensors are represented as a coordinate list (COO) or compressed sparse row (CSR) format alongside a bitmask. The bitmask indicates the positions of non-zero elements.
*   **Reconfigurable Interconnect:** Each processing element (PE) in the systolic array has reconfigurable connections to its neighbors (above, below, left, right). This allows for selective data flow based on the bitmask.
*   **Bitmask Propagation Unit:** Dedicated hardware within each PE to propagate the bitmask along with the data. The bitmask is ANDed with the enable signal of each PE, effectively disabling computations for zero elements.
*   **Data Skipping Logic:** Each PE incorporates logic to skip data loading and forwarding if the corresponding bitmask element is zero.
*   **Control Unit:** A central control unit manages the reconfigurable interconnect and data skipping logic based on the input sparse tensor's structure.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Sparse Tensor Loading:** The control unit loads the sparse tensor data and its associated bitmask into the systolic array's input buffers.
2.  **Bitmask Propagation:** The bitmask is propagated through the systolic array along with the data.
3.  **Reconfiguration:** Based on the bitmask, the control unit configures the interconnect to selectively route data between PEs. PEs corresponding to zero elements are effectively bypassed.
4.  **Computation:** PEs perform the desired operation (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolution) only on non-zero elements. The bitmask ensures that computations involving zero elements are skipped.
5.  **Result Accumulation:** The results are accumulated in a designated output buffer.

**Pseudocode (Kernel for Matrix Multiplication of Sparse Tensors A and B):**

```
// Assuming A and B are in CSR format with associated bitmasks
function sparse_matrix_multiply(A, B, output_matrix):
    // Load A and B into systolic array input buffers
    load_tensor(A, B);

    // Propagate bitmasks of A and B
    propagate_bitmasks(A, B);

    for each row in A:
        for each column in B:
            accumulator = 0
            for k in range(A.width):
                // Check if A[row,k] and B[k,column] are non-zero
                if (A.bitmask[row, k] == 1) and (B.bitmask[k, column] == 1):
                    // Perform multiplication and accumulation only if both elements are non-zero
                    accumulator += A[row, k] * B[k, column];

            output_matrix[row, column] = accumulator;

    return output_matrix;
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Reduced Computational Cost:** By skipping operations on zero elements, the computational cost is significantly reduced for sparse tensors.
*   **Lower Energy Consumption:** Reduced computation translates to lower energy consumption.
*   **Improved Throughput:** By focusing on non-zero elements, the throughput is improved.
*   **Adaptability:** The reconfigurable architecture can adapt to different sparsity patterns.
