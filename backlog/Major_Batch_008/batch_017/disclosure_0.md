## Dynamic Inventory Projection & Anticipatory Ordering

**System Overview:** A combined hardware/software system extending the refrigerator inventory tracking to *project* future inventory needs based on consumption patterns and proactively initiate ordering.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Enhanced Weight Sensors:** Existing weight sensors are supplemented with arrays of pressure sensors integrated into shelf surfaces. These provide finer-grained weight distribution data, allowing for identification of *where* within an item weight is concentrated (e.g., identifying if half a gallon of milk remains even if the total weight is ambiguous).
*   **Internal Camera Array:** A low-resolution, wide-angle camera array positioned to capture images of each shelf. Not for direct visual identification (that's inferred), but for validating/correcting weight sensor data (e.g., detecting an item is misshapen or obstructed).
*   **Integrated Display/Speaker:** A small, integrated display and speaker on the refrigerator door for user interaction and alerts.
*   **Connectivity Module:** Standard Wi-Fi/Bluetooth connectivity.

**Software Components:**

*   **Consumption Pattern Analysis Engine:** A machine learning engine analyzing weight data, time-of-day data, and user interaction (e.g., manual inventory adjustments) to model consumption rates for each item.
*   **Predictive Modeling Engine:** Uses the consumption patterns to project future inventory levels, accounting for known events (e.g., scheduled gatherings, holidays).
*   **Automated Ordering Interface:** Securely integrates with online grocery retailers.
*   **User Profile Management:** Stores user preferences for brands, preferred retailers, and delivery schedules.
*   **Alerting System:** Proactively notifies users of projected shortages and requests confirmation for automated orders.
*   **"Ghost Item" Detection:** Identifies items whose weight/location hasn't changed for an extended period, prompting a "check for spoilage" alert.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - Runs continuously
WHILE (Refrigerator Powered On) {
    ReadWeightSensors();
    ReadCameraArray();
    ProcessSensorData();
    UpdateInventoryProfile();
    PredictFutureInventory();

    IF (InventoryLevel < Threshold) {
        GenerateOrderRequest();
        SendOrderRequestToRetailer();
        DisplayOrderConfirmationToUser();
    }

    IF (GhostItemDetected()) {
        DisplaySpoilageAlertToUser();
    }
}

// Function: ProcessSensorData()
Function ProcessSensorData() {
    // Combine weight & camera data for accurate item identification & weight estimation
    // Apply machine learning algorithms to filter noise & compensate for sensor drift
    // Account for item shape & distribution of weight across the sensor array
}

// Function: PredictFutureInventory()
Function PredictFutureInventory() {
    // Access historical consumption data for each item
    // Apply time series analysis to identify trends & seasonality
    // Factor in known events (e.g., calendar entries, holidays)
    // Calculate projected inventory levels for the next X days
}

// Function: GenerateOrderRequest()
Function GenerateOrderRequest() {
    // Determine the quantity of each item to order
    // Select preferred brand & size
    // Choose preferred retailer
    // Generate an order request in a standardized format
}
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems primarily *track* inventory. This system *predicts* future needs and automates replenishment, reducing food waste and simplifying grocery shopping. The integrated weight/camera sensor fusion provides significantly more accurate inventory data than weight sensors alone.  The "ghost item" detection is a unique feature that addresses a common household problem.
