## Adaptive Environmental ‘Mood’ Lighting System

**Concept:** Extend the anomaly detection to trigger nuanced environmental changes, specifically utilizing smart lighting to create ‘moods’ based on detected activity and predicted user preference. This isn’t simply turning lights on/off, but dynamically adjusting color temperature, brightness, and patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Smart Bulbs/Fixtures:** RGBW capable, individually addressable via a mesh network (Zigbee, Z-Wave, Thread). Minimum color temperature range: 2700K - 6500K. Lumens output: Adjustable 100-1500.
*   **Environmental Sensors:** Existing sensors from the patent (motion, presence) are augmented with:
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: Detects existing light levels.
    *   Sound Sensor: Detects sound levels and frequency patterns (speech, music, silence).
*   **Central Processing Unit (Hub):**  Edge computing device capable of running the AI models, processing sensor data, and controlling lighting.
*   **User Device Interface:** Mobile app for initial setup, preference configuration, and overrides.

**2. Software/AI Models:**

*   **Global Mood Model:** A pre-trained model correlating activity patterns (from the patent) with optimal lighting conditions.  This model is initially populated with broad categories (e.g., 'Relaxation', 'Focus', 'Alert', 'Entertainment') and associated lighting presets.
*   **Local Preference Model:**  Learns user preferences over time.  Utilizes reinforcement learning to refine the Global Mood Model based on user feedback (explicit ratings in the app, implicit feedback through overrides).
*   **Anomaly Detection Integration:**  The existing anomaly detection system feeds into the Mood Model. Anomalies trigger adjustments to lighting to signal the anomaly or create a calming effect.  (e.g.,  If the system detects someone falling, lights flash red and/or a calming blue wash illuminates the area).
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrates data from other smart home devices (e.g., calendar events, music playing, TV status) to inform mood selection.
*   **Predictive Lighting:** Based on historical data and contextual awareness, the system *anticipates* user needs and adjusts lighting proactively.

**3. Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop:
While (System is running) {

  // 1. Data Acquisition
  sensorData = GetSensorData();
  activityData = GetActivityData(); // From patent system
  contextData = GetContextData(); // Calendar, music, etc.

  // 2. Anomaly Detection (Existing System)
  anomaly = DetectAnomaly(activityData);

  // 3. Mood Selection
  mood = SelectMood(sensorData, activityData, contextData, anomaly, userPreferences);

  // Function: SelectMood
  Function SelectMood(sensorData, activityData, contextData, anomaly, userPreferences) {
    // If Anomaly Detected:
    If (anomaly) {
      // Select appropriate anomaly response mood.
      mood = GetAnomalyMood(anomaly);
    }
    // Else:
    Else {
      // Use local preference model to predict mood based on context and activity
      mood = localPreferenceModel.predict(sensorData, activityData, contextData);
    }
    Return mood
  }

  // 4. Lighting Adjustment
  AdjustLighting(mood);

  // 5. User Feedback & Model Update
  If (User Override) {
    UpdateLocalPreferenceModel(UserOverride);
  }

}
```

**4. Example Scenarios:**

*   **Late Night Activity:** If the system detects motion in the kitchen late at night, it subtly increases brightness and shifts to a cooler color temperature to promote alertness without fully waking the user.
*   **Relaxation Mode:** If the system detects the user is watching a movie, it dims the lights and adjusts the color temperature to create a cinematic ambiance.
*   **Emergency Response:**  If a fall is detected, lights flash red and a calming blue wash illuminates the area, providing visual cues for assistance while minimizing panic.
*   **Proactive Lighting:** Based on a calendar entry for a meeting, the system proactively adjusts lighting to a bright, focused color temperature 30 minutes before the scheduled start time.
