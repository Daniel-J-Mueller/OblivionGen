## Dynamic Communication Zones

**Concept:** Implement a system of dynamically defined communication zones within the enterprise messaging platform, linked to user roles, data sensitivity, and real-time risk assessment. This moves beyond simple policy compliance to proactive communication control.

**Specifications:**

*   **Zone Definition:** Administrators define zones based on criteria like department, project, data classification (public, internal, confidential, restricted), and geographic location. Zones are not fixed; they can be assigned and reassigned dynamically based on user activity and context.
*   **Risk Engine Integration:** Integrate a real-time risk engine. This engine analyzes communication content (keywords, sentiment, attachment types, sender/receiver profiles) and assigns a risk score. The score dictates zone restrictions.
*   **Dynamic Restriction Application:**  When a user initiates a message, the system determines the applicable zone based on sender/receiver roles, content, and current risk score. Restrictions can include:
    *   **Content Filtering:**  Blocking or redacting sensitive keywords or phrases.
    *   **Attachment Restrictions:**  Blocking specific file types or requiring encryption.
    *   **Delivery Delays:** Introducing a delay for review if the risk score is high.
    *   **Recipient Restrictions:** Limiting the message to approved recipients within the zone.
    *   **Communication Throttling:** Limiting the rate of messages to prevent data exfiltration.
*   **User Awareness & Override:** Users are informed of zone restrictions. Authorized users (e.g., managers, security officers) can request overrides with justification, triggering an audit log entry.
*   **Zone Mapping API:** Expose an API allowing integration with external security information and event management (SIEM) systems and other risk assessment tools.
*   **Audit Trail Enhancement:**  Audit logs include zone information, restriction details, override requests, and risk scores.
*   **Zone Visualization:**  Provide administrators with a visual representation of zones and communication flows, highlighting potential risks.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function sendMessage(sender, receiver, content, attachment) {
  zone = determineZone(sender, receiver, content, attachment)
  riskScore = calculateRiskScore(content, attachment, sender, receiver)
  restrictions = getRestrictions(zone, riskScore)

  if (restrictions.contentFilter) {
    content = applyContentFilter(content)
  }

  if (restrictions.attachmentRestrictions) {
    attachment = applyAttachmentRestrictions(attachment)
  }

  if (restrictions.deliveryDelay) {
    delay(restrictions.deliveryDelay)
  }

  if (restrictions.recipientRestrictions) {
    recipients = applyRecipientRestrictions(recipients)
  }
  
  sendEncryptedMessage(recipients, content, attachment)
  logCommunication(sender, recipients, content, attachment, zone, riskScore)
}

function determineZone(sender, receiver, content, attachment) {
  // Logic to determine zone based on user roles, data sensitivity, and content
  // Return zone ID
}

function calculateRiskScore(content, attachment, sender, receiver) {
  // Logic to analyze content and attachments for risk factors
  // Return risk score (e.g., 0-100)
}

function getRestrictions(zone, riskScore) {
  // Lookup restrictions based on zone and risk score
  // Return an object containing restrictions (e.g., contentFilter, attachmentRestrictions)
}
