## Adaptive Risk ‘Shadowing’ for Multi-Tiered Systems

**Concept:** Extend the risk scoring framework to dynamically ‘shadow’ communication flows across multiple tiers of interconnected systems, creating a real-time, cascading risk profile.  Instead of solely focusing on the initial node, track how risk propagates *through* the network as data moves.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Flow Tagging & Shadowing:**

*   Each communication link is assigned a unique ‘shadow tag’.
*   When data traverses a link, the shadow tag is attached to the data packet/stream metadata.
*   Risk scores associated with the link (derived from the patent’s method) are copied into the shadow tag.
*   As the data moves to the next node, the existing risk score in the shadow tag is combined with the new link’s risk score using a weighted average (weightings configurable per-node/link-type).
*   This process repeats for each hop, creating a cumulative risk profile that ‘shadows’ the data’s journey.

**2. Tiered Risk Aggregation:**

*   Systems are organized into tiers (e.g., Web Tier, Application Tier, Data Tier).
*   Each tier maintains an aggregate risk score calculated from the shadowed risk scores of all data currently traversing it.
*   Different aggregation functions can be used (e.g., maximum, average, percentile) to tailor the sensitivity to high-risk data flows.

**3. Dynamic Weighting & Learning:**

*   The weighting factors used for combining risk scores are *not* static.
*   A machine learning model (e.g., a reinforcement learning agent) observes the network behavior (e.g., security events, data exfiltration attempts).
*   The model adjusts the weighting factors to optimize the accuracy of the risk prediction.  For example, if a particular link type is frequently exploited, its weighting is increased.

**4. Risk Propagation Modeling:**

*   Beyond simple weighting, model *how* risk propagates.  
*   If a node is compromised, don't just apply a fixed risk increase to outbound links.  Instead, simulate a potential attack path and estimate the impact on other nodes.  This uses graph theory principles.

**5. Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Packet Arrives at Node A from Node B over Link X
packet.shadowTag = LinkX.riskScore  // Initial shadow tag

// Node A processes data and sends to Node C over Link Y
packet.shadowTag = (packet.shadowTag * weightA) + (LinkY.riskScore * weightB) // Combine risk scores
packet.shadowTag = applyRiskPropagationModel(packet.shadowTag, NodeA, NodeC) // Enhance score based on simulation

// Tier Aggregation (happens concurrently on each tier)
tierRisk = 0
for each packet in tier:
    tierRisk += packet.shadowTag
tierRisk = calculateTierRisk(tierRisk, packets.count) // Average, Max, etc.
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Network taps/SPAN ports for traffic capture.
*   High-performance servers for risk calculation and aggregation.
*   Machine learning platform for dynamic weighting.
*   Graph database for modeling network topology and attack paths.
