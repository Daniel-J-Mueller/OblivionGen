## Dynamic Data Sharding via Predictive Analytics

**Concept:** Extend the datastore pointer table concept to proactively shard data *before* performance bottlenecks occur, driven by predictive analytics on subscription patterns. Instead of simply routing to pre-defined datastores (concrete/wildcard), the system will dynamically adjust sharding configurations based on anticipated load.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Sharding Manager (PSM)
*   **Input:**
    *   Real-time subscription stream (topic, type - concrete/wildcard, client ID)
    *   Historical subscription data (aggregated metrics - TPS, data volume, client frequency)
    *   Datastore performance metrics (CPU usage, memory, IOPS)
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Pattern Identification:** PSM employs time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) on historical subscription data to predict future subscription rates for topics. Focus on both overall rates and distributions (e.g., bursty vs. consistent).
    2.  **Shard Prediction:** Based on predicted subscription rates, PSM forecasts the load on existing datastores. This includes modeling the cost of wildcard vs. concrete topic lookups.
    3.  **Dynamic Shard Allocation:**  
        *   If a topic is predicted to exceed a performance threshold, PSM allocates a new shard (datastore instance) *before* the bottleneck occurs.
        *   PSM automatically migrates existing subscriptions to the new shard, balancing load across all shards.
        *   The datastore pointer table is updated in real-time to reflect the new shard allocation.
    4.  **Adaptive Shard Sizing:** PSM monitors shard performance and dynamically adjusts shard size (CPU, memory) based on actual load.  This allows for optimized resource utilization.
    5.  **Cost Modeling:** PSM incorporates cost analysis.  It considers the cost of provisioning new shards, migrating data, and the ongoing operational costs of different datastore types.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Shard Map:** A hierarchical map that tracks shard allocation for each topic. (Topic -> Shard ID -> Datastore Instance)
    *   **Prediction Cache:** Stores predicted subscription rates for rapid lookup. (Topic -> Predicted Rate)

*   **Pseudocode (PSM core):**

```
function predict_and_shard(topic, subscription_type, client_id):
  if topic not in PredictionCache:
    // Run time series analysis on historical data for topic
    predicted_rate = analyze_historical_data(topic)
    PredictionCache[topic] = predicted_rate

  predicted_load = calculate_load(predicted_rate, subscription_type)

  if predicted_load > threshold:
    // Provision new shard
    new_shard_id = provision_shard()
    // Migrate relevant data
    migrate_data(topic, new_shard_id)
    // Update ShardMap
    ShardMap[topic] = new_shard_id
    // Update Datastore Pointer Table
    update_pointer_table(topic, new_shard_id)

  else:
    // Route to existing shard
    shard_id = ShardMap[topic]
    update_pointer_table(topic, shard_id)

  return shard_id
```

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/predict_load(topic)`: Returns predicted load for a given topic.
    *   `/get_shard_id(topic)`: Returns the ID of the assigned shard.
    *   `/update_metrics(shard_id, metrics)`:  Updates performance metrics for a shard.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply *routing* to existing shards. It *proactively* creates and manages shards based on predicted load, optimizing performance and resource utilization. The cost modeling component adds a layer of operational efficiency.
