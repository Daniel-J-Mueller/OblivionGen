## Predictive Prefetching with User Intent Modeling

**Specification:** Implement a system that predicts *which* data to prefetch not just based on network page requests, but on a continually updated model of user intent derived from real-time interaction data. This moves beyond simple "if this page loads, prefetch this data" to a proactive system anticipating user needs before explicit requests are made.

**Components:**

1.  **User Intent Engine (UIE):**
    *   Input: Real-time user interaction data (clicks, scrolls, dwell time, search queries within the application, form inputs, previously prefetched data successfully utilized).
    *   Processing: Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to model sequential user behavior. The LSTM maintains a hidden state representing the user's current inferred intent.
    *   Output: A probability distribution over potential data sets (categorized by content type, topic, relevance scores – see Data Catalog).

2.  **Data Catalog:**
    *   A centralized repository detailing all available data sets.
    *   Each data set is tagged with:
        *   Content Type (e.g., product details, news articles, map tiles, user profile data).
        *   Topic Keywords.
        *   Relevance Score (estimated based on content similarity to various user profiles and historical data).
        *   Data Size/Complexity.
        *   Cacheability parameters.

3.  **Prefetch Manager:**
    *   Input: Probability distribution from UIE, Data Catalog, Current Cache State.
    *   Processing:
        *   Calculates a “Prefetch Score” for each data set: `Prefetch Score = UIE Probability * Data Catalog Relevance * (1 - Cache Hit Rate) * Data Complexity Weight`. The `Data Complexity Weight` adjusts for the cost of prefetching large/complex data sets.
        *   Dynamically adjusts the prefetch queue based on the Prefetch Score, prioritizing high-scoring data sets while respecting bandwidth limitations.
        *   Employs a “Confidence Threshold” – only data sets exceeding a certain Prefetch Score are added to the queue.
    *   Output: Prefetch Queue (list of data sets to be prefetched).

4.  **Cache Manager:**
    *   Standard caching mechanisms (LRU, LFU) to manage pre-fetched data.
    *   Tracks Cache Hit Rate for each data set to inform Prefetch Score calculation.
    *   Implements a “Validity Timestamp” – pre-fetched data expires after a certain time, forcing a refresh if it hasn't been used.

**Pseudocode (Prefetch Manager):**

```
function calculate_prefetch_score(uie_probability, relevance, cache_hit_rate, complexity_weight):
  score = uie_probability * relevance * (1 - cache_hit_rate) * complexity_weight
  return score

function update_prefetch_queue():
  for each data_set in Data Catalog:
    prefetch_score = calculate_prefetch_score(
      UIE.get_probability(data_set),
      data_set.relevance,
      CacheManager.get_hit_rate(data_set),
      data_set.complexity_weight
    )

    if prefetch_score > confidence_threshold:
      add_to_prefetch_queue(data_set)

  # Bandwidth Management – prioritize based on Prefetch Score and Data Size

  return prefetch_queue
```

**Workflow:**

1.  As the user interacts with the application, the UIE continuously updates its model of user intent.
2.  The Prefetch Manager periodically calls `update_prefetch_queue()`.
3.  Data sets with high Prefetch Scores are added to the Prefetch Queue.
4.  A background thread fetches data from the Prefetch Queue and stores it in the Cache.
5.  When the client requests data, the Cache Manager checks if it’s available. If so, it’s served immediately. Otherwise, it’s fetched from the service.

**Novelty:**  This approach moves beyond static prefetching rules and embraces dynamic, personalized prefetching based on a continuously evolving understanding of user intent. The integration of an LSTM-based intent engine allows for proactive prefetching of data *before* the user explicitly requests it, resulting in a significantly improved user experience.
