## Dynamic Object Persona Generation

**Concept:** Extend the AI Builder’s capability beyond simply *building* objects to generating dynamic, interactive “object personas” within the XR environment. These personas aren’t just static models, but have behaviors, simulated ‘needs’, and can respond to user interaction in nuanced ways.

**Specifications:**

**I. Persona Definition & Attributes:**

*   **Attribute Categories:** Define core attribute categories (e.g., “Functionality,” “Aesthetics,” “Emotional State,” “Resource Requirements”). Each category contains multiple quantifiable attributes.
    *   *Functionality:* “Operational Range,” “Energy Consumption,” “Maintenance Frequency.”
    *   *Aesthetics:* “Color Palette,” “Texture Complexity,” “Form Factor.”
    *   *Emotional State:* “Happiness Level,” “Frustration Threshold,” “Responsiveness.”
    *   *Resource Requirements:* “Power Needs,” “Maintenance Schedule,” “Data Input Rate.”
*   **Attribute Ranges:** Each attribute has a defined range (min/max values) influencing behavior.  Example: “Happiness Level” range 0-100.  A low value might lead to malfunction, a high value to increased efficiency.
*   **Behavioral Scripts:** Associated with each persona are customizable behavioral scripts triggered by attribute states or user interactions.  These scripts define actions, animations, sounds, or even requests for resources.

**II. Persona Creation & Editing:**

*   **AI-Assisted Persona Editor:** A dedicated interface within the XR environment, accessible via the AI Builder (NPC). Allows users to define or modify persona attributes.
*   **Attribute Sliders & Input Fields:** Intuitive controls for adjusting attribute values in real-time.
*   **Behavior Scripting Language:** Simplified visual scripting language for defining behavioral logic. Drag-and-drop nodes representing actions, conditions, and events.
*   **Persona Templates:** Pre-built templates for common object types (e.g., “Smart Lamp,” “Automated Plant,” “Security Drone”) with default attribute settings and behavioral scripts.

**III.  Dynamic Interaction & Resource Management:**

*   **Resource Requests:** Personas can request resources from the user or other objects in the XR environment. Example: "Smart Lamp" requests "Energy" from a "Power Source" object, or "Automated Plant" requests "Water" from a "Water Source" object.
*   **User-Defined Resource Flows:** Allow users to establish resource flows between objects.  The AI Builder facilitates connection and management of these flows.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Personas respond to changes in their environment (lighting, sound, user proximity).
*   **“Needs” Simulation:**  Implement a simulated “needs” system where persona attributes decay over time, requiring user intervention or automated resource allocation.  Example: "Happiness Level" degrades if persona is ignored.

**IV.  Pseudocode Example (Simplified)**

```
//Object: SmartLamp

Attributes:
  EnergyLevel (0-100)
  Brightness (0-100)
  HappinessLevel (0-100)

Functions:
  ReceiveEnergy(amount):
    EnergyLevel += amount
    If EnergyLevel > 100:
      EnergyLevel = 100
    HappinessLevel += 5  //Increased happiness from resource fulfillment

  DecreaseEnergy(amount):
    EnergyLevel -= amount
    If EnergyLevel < 0:
      EnergyLevel = 0
      HappinessLevel -= 10 //Decreased happiness due to resource depletion

  UpdateState():
    //Based on EnergyLevel and HappinessLevel, adjust Brightness
    If EnergyLevel < 25:
      Brightness = 0
    Else If EnergyLevel < 50:
      Brightness = 25
    Else If EnergyLevel < 75:
      Brightness = 50
    Else:
      Brightness = 100

    //Based on HappinessLevel, trigger animations or sounds
    If HappinessLevel < 25:
      PlaySadAnimation()
    Else If HappinessLevel > 75:
      PlayHappyAnimation()
```

**V.  Extended Features:**

*   **Persona “Relationships”:** Allow personas to interact with each other, forming collaborative or competitive relationships.
*   **AI-Driven Persona Evolution:** Enable personas to learn and adapt their behavior over time based on user interactions and environmental factors.
*   **Procedural Persona Generation:**  Generate unique personas with randomized attributes and behaviors.
