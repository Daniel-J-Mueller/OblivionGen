## Dynamic Persona-Driven Keyword Expansion & Simulated Interaction

**Concept:** Extend the keyword suggestion system by building dynamic user personas based on observed interaction *patterns* (not just search history), then utilize a simulated interaction engine to predict likely search refinements *before* the user types.

**Specifications:**

**I. Persona Construction Module:**

1.  **Data Sources:**
    *   Search Queries (as in the base patent).
    *   Content Interactions (likes, shares, comments, saves).
    *   Profile Data (age, location, stated interests - used as *initial* seeds).
    *   Network Graph (who the user interacts with â€“ weighted by frequency/type of interaction).
    *   Time-Series Data (when the user is active, types of content consumed at specific times).
2.  **Pattern Identification:** Utilize time-series analysis and clustering algorithms to identify recurring behavioral patterns. Examples:
    *   "Morning News Consumer": High consumption of news articles between 6-9 AM.
    *   "Hobbyist Researcher": Deep dives into specific topics over extended periods.
    *   "Social Trend Follower": Frequent engagement with trending hashtags/accounts.
3.  **Persona Representation:**
    *   Each persona is a vector of weighted features representing behavioral characteristics.
    *   Feature weights dynamically adjust based on recent activity.
    *   A "confidence score" indicates the strength of the persona assignment.
4.  **Multi-Persona Support:** Users can be assigned *multiple* personas with varying confidence scores, allowing for nuanced suggestion targeting.

**II. Simulated Interaction Engine:**

1.  **Probabilistic Model:** Create a Markov Chain model trained on aggregated user interaction data. This model predicts the probability of a user taking specific actions (e.g., refining a query, clicking on a result, sharing a post) given their current state (e.g., initial query, displayed results).
2.  **Contextual Awareness:** The model incorporates:
    *   User Persona (from the Persona Construction Module).
    *   Current Query.
    *   Displayed Results (to avoid redundant suggestions).
    *   Time of Day/Week (to account for behavioral shifts).
    *   Trending Topics (real-time data feed).
3.  **Preemptive Suggestion Generation:** Based on the probabilistic model, the engine *predicts* likely user refinements *before* they type. This includes:
    *   Keyword additions/modifications.
    *   Filter/sort options.
    *   Related content categories.
4.  **Suggestion Ranking:** Suggestions are ranked based on:
    *   Probability of user action (from the model).
    *   Relevance to current query.
    *   Diversity of suggestions (avoiding repetitive options).

**III. Integration with Existing System:**

1.  The Persona Construction Module runs asynchronously in the background, continuously updating user personas.
2.  When a user begins typing a query, the Simulated Interaction Engine generates preemptive suggestions based on the user's persona and current context.
3.  These suggestions are displayed in the search interface alongside the standard keyword suggestions (from the base patent).

**Pseudocode (Simulated Interaction Engine - Suggestion Generation):**

```
function generate_suggestions(user_persona, current_query, displayed_results):
  // Predict next likely action probabilities
  action_probabilities = predict_action_probabilities(user_persona, current_query, displayed_results)

  // Filter actions based on confidence threshold
  filtered_actions = filter_actions(action_probabilities, confidence_threshold)

  // Rank actions based on relevance and diversity
  ranked_actions = rank_actions(filtered_actions, current_query, displayed_results)

  // Return top N ranked actions as suggestions
  return top_n_suggestions(ranked_actions, N)
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive keyword suggestion to *proactive* prediction of user intent, leveraging dynamic persona modeling and probabilistic action prediction.  The system aims to anticipate what the user *will* search for, rather than simply responding to what they *have* searched for.
