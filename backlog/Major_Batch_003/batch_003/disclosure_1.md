## Adaptive Resolution Motion Estimation with Per-Object Tracking

**Concept:** Extend the parallel motion estimation system to incorporate adaptive resolution processing *per object* within the video frame, dynamically adjusting the level of detail used for motion estimation based on object size, velocity, and predicted importance.  This dramatically reduces computational load without sacrificing perceived quality, and lays the groundwork for object-centric video compression and rendering.

**Specifications:**

**1. Object Segmentation & Prioritization Module:**

*   **Input:** Down-sampled video frame.
*   **Process:**  Employ a lightweight, real-time object segmentation algorithm (e.g., a simplified version of Mask R-CNN or a learned foreground/background separation network) to identify and delineate objects within the frame.
*   **Output:** A mask layer indicating object boundaries, and a priority score for each object based on:
    *   Object Size (larger objects generally require more detail).
    *   Object Velocity (faster-moving objects require more precise motion estimation).
    *   Object Importance (potentially determined by a higher-level AI model â€“ e.g., prioritize faces or areas of high visual change).  This priority can be a configurable parameter.

**2. Adaptive Resolution Block Partitioning:**

*   **Input:** Down-sampled video frame, object mask layer, object priority scores.
*   **Process:**  Divide the frame into variable-sized blocks.
    *   Blocks containing high-priority objects are further subdivided into smaller blocks (e.g., 8x8 or 4x4 pixels) to preserve detail.
    *   Blocks containing low-priority objects or background are aggregated into larger blocks (e.g., 32x32 or 64x64 pixels) to reduce computational load.
    *   A dynamic allocation scheme balances block size with available processing resources.
*   **Output:** A partitioned frame with varying block sizes and a corresponding metadata layer indicating the resolution level of each block.

**3. Parallel Motion Estimation with Resolution Awareness:**

*   **Input:** Partitioned frame, metadata layer, existing parallel motion estimation hardware.
*   **Process:**  Modify the existing hardware motion estimation search processing units to accept the metadata layer.
    *   Each processing unit receives a subset of the partitioned frame.
    *   The processing unit uses the metadata to determine the appropriate search range and sub-pixel precision for motion estimation within its assigned blocks.  Higher-resolution blocks get finer-grained searches.
    *   Units performing motion estimation on larger, lower-resolution blocks utilize a coarser search range and potentially reduced sub-pixel accuracy.
*   **Output:** Motion vectors and corresponding residual errors for each block, tagged with resolution level.

**4. Hierarchical Refinement & Fusion:**

*   **Input:** Motion vectors and residual errors for all blocks, resolution level tags.
*   **Process:**  Implement a hierarchical refinement stage.
    *   Low-resolution blocks are upsampled and refined using motion vectors from adjacent high-resolution blocks.
    *   A fusion algorithm combines the refined low-resolution data with the original high-resolution data to generate a final, visually coherent frame.
*   **Output:** A fully reconstructed frame with optimized motion vectors and reduced residual error.

**Pseudocode (Core Motion Estimation Unit Adaptation):**

```
function estimateMotion(sourceBlock, referenceFrames, metadata):
  resolutionLevel = metadata.resolutionLevel
  searchRange = calculateSearchRange(resolutionLevel) // Coarser for lower resolution
  subPixelPrecision = calculateSubPixelPrecision(resolutionLevel) // Reduced for lower resolution

  bestMotionVector = null
  minCost = infinity

  for each referenceFrame in referenceFrames:
    for each candidateMotionVector within searchRange:
      alignedBlock = applyMotionVector(referenceFrame, candidateMotionVector)
      cost = calculateBlockDifference(sourceBlock, alignedBlock)

      if cost < minCost:
        minCost = cost
        bestMotionVector = candidateMotionVector

  refinedMotionVector = refineMotionVector(bestMotionVector, subPixelPrecision)
  return refinedMotionVector
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Metadata Buffer:**  A small buffer within each processing unit to store the resolution level for its assigned blocks.
*   **Dynamic Search Range Control:**  Hardware logic to adjust the search range based on the metadata.
*   **Programmable Sub-Pixel Interpolation:**  Hardware support for different levels of sub-pixel interpolation.
*   **Communication Protocol:**  Adapt the communication protocol between processing units to transmit resolution level tags along with motion vectors.
