## Dynamic Event Reconstruction & Predictive Tagging

**Concept:** Expand upon the geospatial & temporal organization to *reconstruct* events dynamically from fragmented content, and then *predictively* tag future content as it’s captured, facilitating near-instant organization and enhanced contextual awareness.

**Core Innovation:** The current patent focuses on categorization *after* content exists. This system actively *builds* a contextual understanding *during* content capture, reconstructing probable events and preemptively tagging/organizing data.

**System Specs:**

1.  **Event Horizon Buffer:** A local (device) time-series database storing raw sensor data (location, time, accelerometer, microphone input, camera preview frames – low resolution) in a sliding window (adjustable, e.g., 60-120 seconds). This is a 'rough draft' of everything happening around the user.
2.  **Probabilistic Event Modeling Engine:**  A server-side (or powerful on-device) AI model trained on a vast dataset of labeled events (walking, driving, attending a concert, cooking, etc.) and associated sensor data patterns. This model estimates the probability of different events occurring *within* the Event Horizon Buffer. Crucially, this engine doesn't rely on perfect data. It embraces ambiguity.
3.  **Sensor Fusion & Pattern Matching:**  Real-time analysis of data *within* the Event Horizon Buffer.
    *   **Geospatial Clustering:** Identifies location clusters (e.g., user is at a specific venue).
    *   **Temporal Analysis:**  Detects time patterns (e.g., consistent movement, periodic sounds).
    *   **Motion Vector Analysis:**  Analyzes accelerometer data to infer activity (walking, running, stillness).
    *   **Audio Event Detection:** Identifies sounds (music, speech, engine noise).
4.  **Event Reconstruction Algorithm:** This algorithm combines the outputs of the Sensor Fusion & Pattern Matching module and the Probabilistic Event Modeling Engine to reconstruct likely events.
    *   It generates a probabilistic event timeline – a ranked list of events with associated confidence scores and time ranges.
    *   It utilizes a Bayesian approach to refine event probabilities as new data arrives.
    *   Handles fragmented data gracefully - an event doesn't need complete data to be recognized.
5.  **Predictive Tagging System:** This system preemptively tags new content *before* it's fully captured.
    *   When the user starts recording video/audio, the Predictive Tagging System analyzes the current context (derived from the Event Reconstruction Algorithm).
    *   It assigns preliminary tags based on the most likely event(s).
    *   As the recording continues, these tags are refined based on the incoming data.
6.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   A visual timeline displaying reconstructed events with confidence scores.
    *   The ability to manually confirm or correct reconstructed events.
    *   A tag suggestion interface that allows users to add or modify tags.
7.  **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   All processing should be performed locally whenever possible.
    *   Data sent to the server should be anonymized and encrypted.
    *   Users should have full control over their data and be able to opt out of data collection.

**Pseudocode (Event Reconstruction Algorithm - Simplified):**

```
function reconstruct_event(event_horizon_buffer):
  geospatial_clusters = analyze_geospatial_data(event_horizon_buffer)
  temporal_patterns = analyze_temporal_data(event_horizon_buffer)
  motion_vectors = analyze_motion_data(event_horizon_buffer)
  audio_events = analyze_audio_data(event_horizon_buffer)

  event_probabilities = {}
  for event in known_events:
    probability = calculate_event_probability(event, geospatial_clusters, temporal_patterns, motion_vectors, audio_events)
    event_probabilities[event] = probability

  ranked_events = sort_events_by_probability(event_probabilities)
  return ranked_events
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Social Context Integration:** Incorporate social data (e.g., location sharing, event attendance) to improve event reconstruction accuracy.
*   **AR Overlay:** Display reconstructed events and predicted tags as an augmented reality overlay on the user's camera view.
*   **Proactive Content Creation:**  Automatically suggest capturing specific content based on the reconstructed event (e.g., "Record a video of this concert!").
