## Adaptive Image Complexity based on Network Latency & Device Capability

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the number of progressive image scans delivered *not* based solely on client request, but also factoring in real-time network latency *and* client device processing power/screen resolution. This goes beyond simply delivering fewer scans – it’s about intelligent prioritization of *which* scans are delivered first, and how aggressively complexity is increased.

**Specs:**

**1. Network Latency Probe:**

*   **Implementation:** Client device periodically (e.g., every 500ms) pings a designated latency server (potentially co-located with edge servers).
*   **Data:** Round trip time (RTT) in milliseconds.
*   **Classification:**
    *   **Excellent:** < 50ms
    *   **Good:** 50-150ms
    *   **Fair:** 150-300ms
    *   **Poor:** > 300ms

**2. Device Capability Probe:**

*   **Implementation:** Client device sends device profile information upon initial connection:
    *   CPU Cores
    *   GPU Model
    *   Screen Resolution (Width x Height)
    *   Available Memory
*   **Scoring:**  Assign a “Device Performance Score” based on these parameters.  A simple weighted average can be used, with higher weights for CPU/GPU.

**3.  Progressive Scan Prioritization Algorithm:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Network Latency Classification
    *   Device Performance Score
    *   Total Number of Progressive Scans Available (from server)
*   **Algorithm:**

```pseudocode
function prioritizeScans(latency, deviceScore, totalScans):
  if latency == "Poor":
    // Focus on delivering base layers quickly
    scanPriority = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...] //Deliver scans in order.
    maxScansDelivered = 5
  else if latency == "Fair":
    // Moderate complexity increase
    scanPriority = [0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9...] //Deliver scans, skipping some
    maxScansDelivered = 8
  else if latency == "Good":
    scanPriority = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...]
    maxScansDelivered = 12
  else if latency == "Excellent":
    scanPriority = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...] //Deliver all scans
    maxScansDelivered = totalScans

  //Further refinement based on device score
  if deviceScore < 50: //Low end device
    maxScansDelivered = min(maxScansDelivered, 6)

  return scanPriority, maxScansDelivered
```

**4. Server-Side Implementation:**

*   The server stores progressive scans for each image.
*   Upon receiving a request, the server determines the optimal scan priority and maximum scans to deliver based on the client’s reported latency and device capability.
*   The server dynamically constructs the image response, delivering only the prioritized scans.

**5. Data Format:**

*   Client sends: `{"latency": "Fair", "deviceScore": 75}`
*   Server responds with:  Image data containing scans prioritized according to the algorithm.

**Benefits:**

*   Improved user experience on slow networks.
*   Optimized image rendering on low-end devices.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing network conditions.
*   Potential for reduced bandwidth usage.
