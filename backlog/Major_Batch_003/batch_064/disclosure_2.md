## Adaptive Agent Skill Synthesis

**Concept:** Dynamically combine the capabilities of multiple agents – not just for task completion, but to *create* new, temporary “skill agents” on-the-fly. These skill agents would possess a blended competency derived from their constituent parts, optimized for ultra-specific sub-tasks within a larger request.

**Specification:**

*   **Component Agents:** The system maintains a catalog of fundamental agent modules with clearly defined capabilities (e.g., ‘Data Retriever’, ‘Text Summarizer’, ‘Sentiment Analyzer’, ‘Image Generator’, ‘Code Interpreter’, ‘API Connector’). Each agent exposes an API with standardized input/output formats.

*   **Skill Graph:** A knowledge graph represents the relationships between agent capabilities and potential skill combinations. Nodes are agents or skills. Edges represent compatibility, dependency, or potential synergy (weighted).

*   **Request Decomposition & Skill Identification:** Upon receiving a user request, a decomposition module breaks it into a hierarchy of sub-tasks. A skill identification module uses the Skill Graph and request context (semantic intent, dialog history, user profile) to identify the optimal combination of agents for *each* sub-task. This isn’t simply selecting existing agents; it's creating a 'virtual agent' comprised of these modules.

*   **Dynamic Pipeline Construction:** A pipeline construction module dynamically assembles the selected agents into a sequential or parallel processing pipeline. This pipeline becomes the “skill agent” for that specific sub-task.

*   **Contextual Data Exchange:** A data exchange layer manages the flow of information between agents in the pipeline. It handles data transformation, error handling, and contextual data propagation. This ensures each agent receives the input it expects, and the output is properly formatted for the next agent.

*   **Skill Agent Lifecycle:** Each skill agent exists only for the duration of its associated sub-task. Once completed, the pipeline is dismantled, and the constituent agents return to the pool.

*   **Adaptive Weighting:**  A reinforcement learning module continuously optimizes the weighting of agents within each pipeline based on performance metrics (accuracy, speed, user satisfaction).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function processRequest(userRequest, contextData):
  subTasks = decomposeRequest(userRequest)

  for subTask in subTasks:
    skillCombination = identifySkillCombination(subTask, contextData)  // Uses Skill Graph & RL
    skillPipeline = constructSkillPipeline(skillCombination)
    result = executeSkillPipeline(skillPipeline, subTask)
    updateSkillPipelineWeights(skillPipeline, result) // Reinforcement Learning
    appendResultToOverallResponse(result)
  return overallResponse
```

**Novelty & Potential:** This moves beyond simple agent selection to *agent synthesis*. It allows the system to tackle incredibly complex tasks by creating temporary, specialized agents on-the-fly. This is particularly valuable for handling ambiguous or nuanced requests, adapting to changing user needs, and discovering novel solutions. Think of it like building a custom robot for *each* step of a process. The 'Skill Graph' itself becomes a powerful knowledge base for task decomposition and agent specialization.
