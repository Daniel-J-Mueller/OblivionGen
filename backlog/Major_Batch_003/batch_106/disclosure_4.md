## Dynamic User ‘Moment’ Aggregation & Predictive Pre-Order

**Concept:** Extend pre-launch engagement beyond simple countdowns and individual interactive elements by creating dynamically aggregated ‘moments’ based on real-time user activity and predicting pre-order demand with significantly increased granularity. This moves beyond static pre-launch pages to an evolving, collectively-shaped experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Moment Definition:** A 'Moment' is a short-form, multi-media experience (image, video clip, text snippet, poll result) derived from user interactions with the pre-launch product's social media presence *and* interactions within the social networking system itself. Examples: “3,000 users just ‘hearted’ the product reveal!”, “75% of polled users say they’ll use the product for X!”, “Trending hashtag: #ProductYUseCases”.
*   **Moment Aggregation Engine:**
    *   Continuously monitor all relevant user activity: likes, shares, comments, poll responses, hashtag usage, direct messages referencing the product, group discussions.
    *   Apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Sentiment Analysis to extract key themes and insights.
    *   Rank Moments based on engagement (total interactions, velocity of interactions, sentiment score).
    *   Curate a feed of top-ranked Moments, dynamically updated in near real-time.
*   **Personalized Moment Feeds:**
    *   User profiles track expressed interests and engagement patterns (based on past behavior).
    *   Moment Feed algorithm prioritizes Moments relevant to each user's profile.
    *   Allows users to ‘follow’ specific themes/aspects of the product (e.g., “follow updates on the product’s sustainability features”).
*   **Predictive Pre-Order System:**
    *   Correlate Moment engagement with stated purchase intent (e.g., users who ‘heart’ a sustainability update are more likely to pre-order the eco-friendly version).
    *   Machine Learning model predicts individual user pre-order probability and overall demand.
    *   Dynamically adjusts pre-order availability/limits based on predicted demand.
    *   Algorithm flags users with high pre-order probability for targeted incentives (e.g., early access, exclusive bundles).
*   **Pre-Launch Page Integration:**
    *   Replace static countdowns with a live, dynamically updating "Moment Feed" section on the pre-launch page.
    *   Display personalized Moments relevant to each user.
    *   Include a "Pre-Order Now" call to action, prominently displayed within the Moment Feed.
* **System Architecture:**
    *   **Data Ingestion Layer:** Real-time data streams from social media APIs, internal social networking system event logs.
    *   **Processing Layer:** NLP engine, Sentiment Analysis, Machine Learning model for pre-order prediction.
    *   **Storage Layer:** Time-series database for storing Moment data, user profiles, and prediction results.
    *   **Presentation Layer:** Dynamic Moment Feed component for pre-launch pages and user dashboards.

**Pseudocode (Moment Feed Update):**

```
function updateMomentFeed(userID) {
  userProfile = getUserProfile(userID);
  relevantMoments = getRelevantMoments(userID, userProfile); // Filter by user interests
  sortedMoments = sortMomentsByEngagement(relevantMoments);
  topMoments = sortedMoments.slice(0, 10); // Select top 10 moments
  renderMomentFeed(topMoments); // Display on pre-launch page
}

function getRelevantMoments(userID, userProfile) {
  moments = getAllMoments();
  filteredMoments = [];
  for (moment in moments) {
    if (moment.tags.includes(userProfile.interests)) {
      filteredMoments.push(moment);
    }
  }
  return filteredMoments;
}
```
