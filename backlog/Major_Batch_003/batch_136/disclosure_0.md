## Dynamic Avatar Morphing Based on Environmental Audio

**Concept:** Extend the avatar system to dynamically alter avatar appearance (beyond simple movements) based on detected environmental audio cues during the real-time communication session. This isn’t about *replacing* the avatar, but subtly morphing it to reflect the perceived “vibe” of the environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Audio Input:** System accesses audio from the sender’s environment (microphone input).
*   **Audio Analysis Module:** Real-time analysis of audio stream, focusing on characteristics like:
    *   **Dominant Frequency:**  Indicates overall 'tone' (high=energetic, low=calm).
    *   **Amplitude/Volume:**  Reflects activity level.
    *   **Audio Event Detection:** Identify specific events (e.g., laughter, music, sirens, nature sounds).
*   **Morph Target Library:**  Pre-defined avatar morph targets mapped to audio characteristics. Examples:
    *   **High Frequency/Volume:** Avatar becomes more vibrant – increased color saturation, subtle glow effects, slightly exaggerated features (e.g., wider smile, more expressive eyes).
    *   **Low Frequency/Volume:** Avatar adopts a calmer aesthetic – muted colors, softened features, relaxed posture.
    *   **Laughter:** Avatar’s expression dynamically shifts to mimic joy/amusement; small particle effects (e.g., sparkles) appear.
    *   **Music (Genre Detection):** Avatar’s appearance adapts to the music genre. (e.g., electronic music = geometric patterns, classical = ornate details, rock = edgy/textured look).
    *   **Nature Sounds:** Avatar may incorporate natural elements – leaves, flowers, water droplets as visual effects.
*   **Blending/Smoothing:**  Transition between morph targets is smooth and gradual, preventing jarring visual changes. Uses weighted averages for blending.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to define sensitivity levels for each audio characteristic.  Enable/disable specific morph targets.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function applyAudioMorphing(avatar, audioStream) {
  audioAnalysis = analyzeAudio(audioStream); // Returns dominantFrequency, amplitude, events

  morphWeights = {
    dominantFrequency: 0.0,
    amplitude: 0.0,
    event_laughter: 0.0,
    event_music_genre: 0.0
  };

  // Map audio characteristics to morph weights
  morphWeights.dominantFrequency = map(audioAnalysis.dominantFrequency, minFreq, maxFreq, 0.0, 1.0);
  morphWeights.amplitude = map(audioAnalysis.amplitude, minAmplitude, maxAmplitude, 0.0, 1.0);

  if (audioAnalysis.events.includes("laughter")) {
    morphWeights.event_laughter = 1.0;
  }

  if (audioAnalysis.events.includes("music")) {
    morphWeights.event_music_genre = 1.0;
    musicGenre = detectMusicGenre(audioStream); //function to determine genre
  }

  // Apply morph targets with blending
  applyMorphTarget(avatar, "vibrance", morphWeights.dominantFrequency * 0.5);
  applyMorphTarget(avatar, "softness", (1.0 - morphWeights.dominantFrequency) * 0.3);
  applyMorphTarget(avatar, "joy", morphWeights.event_laughter * 0.7);

  if (morphWeights.event_music_genre) {
    applyMusicStyle(avatar, musicGenre); //function to apply music specific styles
  }
}

function applyMorphTarget(avatar, targetName, weight) {
  // Code to manipulate avatar's mesh or properties based on targetName and weight
}

function applyMusicStyle(avatar, genre) {
  //Apply mesh/color/special effects based on music genre
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Real-time audio processing requires sufficient CPU/GPU power.
*   High-quality microphone input recommended for accurate audio analysis.
*   Avatar mesh complexity impacts rendering performance.
