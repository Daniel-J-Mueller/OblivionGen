## Surface Waveguide – Dynamic Beam Steering with Metamaterial Overlay

**Concept:** Implement dynamic beam steering for surface wave propagation using an electronically controllable metamaterial overlay atop the existing surface waveguide. This allows for focused energy delivery to multiple or moving electronic devices without physical mode converters, and enables higher data rates through spatial multiplexing.

**Specifications:**

*   **Surface Waveguide Base:** Utilize the existing two-dimensional conductive surface and conductive wall construction as described in the provided patent. Maintain the surface treatment for increased reactance and low insertion loss.
*   **Metamaterial Overlay:**
    *   Material: Array of individually addressable metamaterial elements (e.g., split-ring resonators, varactor diodes integrated with resonant structures) fabricated on a dielectric substrate.
    *   Dimensions: Metamaterial elements sized to interact with the surface wave at the desired frequencies (e.g., sub-wavelength scale). Array density optimized for beam steering resolution and sidelobe suppression.
    *   Addressing: Each metamaterial element is individually addressable via a control circuitry embedded within the dielectric substrate. This circuitry allows for tuning the resonant frequency and/or amplitude of each element.
    *   Control Algorithm: A real-time control algorithm adjusts the resonant frequency and/or amplitude of each metamaterial element to create a desired beam pattern. This algorithm can be based on optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent, genetic algorithms) or pre-programmed beam patterns.
*   **Control Circuitry:**
    *   Communication Interface: A wireless communication interface (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi) allows for external control of the beam steering algorithm.
    *   Power Supply: An integrated power supply provides power to the control circuitry and metamaterial elements.
    *   Processing Unit: A low-power processing unit executes the beam steering algorithm and controls the metamaterial elements.
*   **System Integration:**
    *   The metamaterial overlay is placed directly above the two-dimensional conductive surface of the surface waveguide.
    *   The control circuitry is embedded within the dielectric substrate and connected to the metamaterial elements via microstrip lines or other suitable interconnects.
    *   The entire assembly is encapsulated in a protective housing.
*   **Pseudocode (Beam Steering Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Target device coordinates (x, y)
// Output: Control signals for metamaterial elements

function steerBeam(x, y):
    // Calculate phase gradients required to steer the beam towards (x, y)
    phaseGradients = calculatePhaseGradients(x, y)

    // Calculate amplitude weights for each metamaterial element
    amplitudeWeights = calculateAmplitudeWeights(x, y)

    // Apply phase and amplitude to each metamaterial element
    for each element in metamaterialArray:
        element.setPhase(phaseGradients[element.index])
        element.setAmplitude(amplitudeWeights[element.index])

    return
```

**Innovation Details:**

This system moves beyond static mode converters. It enables focused energy transmission to multiple devices dynamically and supports more complex communication protocols by manipulating the phase and amplitude of surface waves. The metamaterial overlay acts as a programmable lens for surface waves, effectively steering the energy where it’s needed. By enabling spatial multiplexing and dynamic focusing, data transfer speeds are increased and power efficiency is maximized. The algorithm could adapt in real time to changes in device position and environment, offering a more robust and efficient wireless power and data transfer solution.
