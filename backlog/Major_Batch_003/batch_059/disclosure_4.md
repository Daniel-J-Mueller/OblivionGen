## Content Object ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Conflict Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the draft/fragment system to incorporate ‘shadow’ content objects – actively maintained, predictive versions of content objects reflecting potential changes *before* they are formally drafted as fragments. This allows for proactive conflict detection and resolution *before* a user even submits a draft fragment, significantly improving collaboration efficiency.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Object Creation:** When a user begins interacting with a content object, a ‘shadow’ instance is created in memory (or a fast-access cache). This shadow object mirrors the current live version.
2.  **Real-Time Shadow Updates:** As the user makes changes (even locally, before submitting a fragment), the shadow object is updated in real-time.  Changes are *not* immediately applied to the live object.
3.  **Predictive Conflict Analysis:** A background process continuously analyzes the shadow object against the live object *and* against other active shadow objects for potential conflicts.  This analysis employs the same conflict detection logic as the existing system (hashcode comparison, etc.).
4.  **Pre-Submission Conflict Indicators:** If a conflict is predicted, the user receives an immediate visual indicator *before* submitting a fragment. The indicator displays:
    *   The nature of the conflict (e.g., "Field X is being modified by User Y").
    *   Options for resolution:
        *   "View Conflict" – Displays a side-by-side comparison of the live object, shadow object, and conflicting changes.
        *   “Override” – Proceed with submission, acknowledging potential conflict.
        *   “Sync” – Attempt to automatically merge changes from the conflicting source into the shadow object.
5.  **Conflict Resolution Workspace:** A dedicated workspace is launched when ‘View Conflict’ is selected. This workspace allows users to:
    *   Compare the conflicting versions.
    *   Edit the shadow object to resolve conflicts.
    *   Initiate a direct chat with the conflicting user to coordinate changes.
6.  **Fragment Creation from Shadow:** When the user is satisfied with the shadow object, they can finalize and submit it as a formal draft fragment. This triggers the established conflict resolution process as a backup.
7. **System Architecture Integration:**
    *   New ‘Shadow Object Manager’ component responsible for creation, maintenance, and conflict detection.
    *   Integration with the existing fragment submission pipeline.
    *   Real-time communication channel for user-to-user conflict resolution.
8. **Pseudocode - Shadow Object Manager:**

```
//Initialization
shadowObjectMap = {} //Stores shadow objects keyed by content object ID

function createShadowObject(contentObjectID, liveContentObject) {
  shadowObject = clone(liveContentObject)
  shadowObjectMap[contentObjectID] = shadowObject
  return shadowObject
}

function updateShadowObject(contentObjectID, fieldName, newValue) {
  shadowObject = shadowObjectMap[contentObjectID]
  shadowObject[fieldName] = newValue
}

function detectConflicts(contentObjectID) {
  shadowObject = shadowObjectMap[contentObjectID]
  liveObject = getContentObject(contentObjectID) //Fetch current live version
  conflicts = compareObjects(liveObject, shadowObject) //Comparison Logic (hashcodes, field comparisons)
  return conflicts
}

function syncShadowObject(contentObjectID, remoteChanges) {
  shadowObject = shadowObjectMap[contentObjectID]
  applyChanges(shadowObject, remoteChanges)
}
```

**Novelty:** This moves conflict resolution from a *reactive* to a *proactive* approach. The system anticipates conflicts before they impact live content, fostering smoother collaboration and reducing potential disruptions. It fundamentally alters the user experience by providing immediate feedback on potential issues, rather than waiting for a submission to be flagged as problematic.
