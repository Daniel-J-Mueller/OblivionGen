## Dynamic Presence-Based Avatars

**Concept:** Extend the “co-present moment” indication beyond visual streaks in the messaging thread itself, and apply it to dynamically evolving, personalized avatars *representing* users within a shared digital space connected to the thread. This creates a richer sense of co-presence.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Avatar Core:** Each user possesses a customizable avatar. This isn’t a full-blown game avatar, but a simplified, animated representation – think animated profile picture, with basic expressions and movement.

2.  **Presence Mapping:** The system continuously monitors user access to the messaging thread.

3.  **Co-Presence Trigger:** When a “co-present moment” is detected (as per the patent’s criteria), the system initiates a dynamic avatar update for *all* participating users.

4.  **Dynamic Avatar Behaviors:**
    *   **Proximity Effect:** Avatars visually “move closer” to each other within a shared digital space (a simple 2D/3D environment visible alongside the messaging thread). The closer the users are to each other in the messaging thread activity (e.g., rapid replies, shared content), the closer the avatars move.
    *   **Shared Emotes:** The system provides a library of simple, synchronized emotes (e.g., thumbs up, laugh, surprise) that all co-present avatars perform simultaneously. These are triggered by keywords or dedicated buttons within the thread.
    *   **Content-Driven Animation:**  If users share media (images, videos, music) within the thread, the avatars react accordingly. For example, avatars "dance" to the music, show "surprise" at a shared image, or "focus" on a shared video.
    *   **Mood Mapping:** Sentiment analysis of messages can subtly affect avatar expressions. Positive messages lead to happier expressions, negative messages to concerned expressions, etc.
    *   **Activity Indicators:**  Avatars display subtle activity indicators reflecting thread engagement (e.g., a pulsing glow when a user is actively typing, a trail of particles following an avatar when it's scrolling through the thread).

5.  **Digital Space:** The "digital space" doesn't need to be elaborate. It can be a simple, shared visual area next to the messaging thread – a minimal 2D canvas, or a low-poly 3D environment. The core function is to visually represent the co-present users and their interactions.

6.  **Integration with Co-Present Features:** Integrate with the existing features described in the patent.  For example, during a call initiated within the thread, the avatars "face" each other and display animations indicating they are in a conversation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On User Access (User enters/exits thread)
function updateUserPresence(userID, isOnline) {
  userPresence[userID] = isOnline;
  checkForCoPresence();
}

// Check for co-presence
function checkForCoPresence() {
  coPresentUsers = [];
  for (userID in userPresence) {
    if (userPresence[userID]) {
      coPresentUsers.push(userID);
    }
  }

  if (coPresentUsers.length > 1) {
    activateCoPresenceMode();
  } else {
    deactivateCoPresenceMode();
  }
}

// Activate Co-Presence Mode
function activateCoPresenceMode() {
  for (userID in coPresentUsers) {
    updateAvatar(userID, "coPresent"); // Trigger avatar animations/behaviors
    positionAvatars(); // Adjust avatar positions based on activity
  }
}

// Update Avatar State
function updateAvatar(userID, state) {
  if (state == "coPresent") {
    //Trigger avatar animations, proximity effects, shared emotes, etc.
  }
}

// Position Avatars
function positionAvatars() {
  //Calculate avatar positions based on message frequency, shared content, etc.
}
```

**Potential Expansion:** Extend avatar customization to include integration with external services (e.g., Spotify for music-driven animations, YouTube for video-driven animations). Allow users to create and share custom avatar animations and emotes.
