## Dynamic Network 'Shadowing' for Proactive Failure Mitigation

**Concept:** Expand upon the real-time reliability updates (MTBF/MTTR) to create a predictive ‘shadow’ network representing anticipated failures. Instead of *reacting* to failures, the system proactively shifts traffic *before* they occur, minimizing disruption.

**Specs:**

*   **Shadow Network Generation:**
    *   Utilize observed link performance (from the patent) to build a probabilistic model for each link, predicting future failure likelihood (beyond just MTBF/MTTR).  This incorporates not just historical failure data, but also *correlated* failures (e.g., power supply failures affecting multiple links).
    *   Create a ‘shadow’ network mirroring the primary network topology.  Each link in the shadow network is weighted by its predicted failure probability *and* the estimated impact of that failure on overall network performance (using metrics like flow disruption, latency increase, and cost).
    *   The shadow network isn’t static.  It continuously updates as new performance data arrives, and predictive models refine.

*   **Traffic ‘Bleeding’ & Adaptive Routing:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to ‘bleed’ a small percentage of traffic (e.g., 5-10%) from high-risk links in the primary network *onto* alternative paths in the shadow network, *before* the link actually fails. This is done opportunistically, during periods of low network load.
    *   A ‘cost’ function is assigned to each path in both the primary and shadow networks. This includes factors like bandwidth, latency, link cost, and *predicted* disruption cost.  Traffic is routed to minimize this overall cost.
    *   The ‘bleeding’ percentage is dynamically adjusted based on the predicted failure risk, link capacity, and current network load.

*   **Failure Validation & Seamless Transition:**
    *   When a link *does* fail in the primary network, the system immediately validates the pre-shifted traffic.  If the alternate path is functioning as expected (confirmed by network monitoring), the transition is seamless.
    *   If the alternate path is congested or experiencing issues, the system can dynamically reroute the remaining traffic, using traditional routing protocols.

*   **Pseudocode (Traffic Routing):**

    ```
    FUNCTION RouteTraffic(flow, primaryNetwork, shadowNetwork)
      // 'flow' represents a data stream with source and destination
      // 'primaryNetwork' and 'shadowNetwork' are network topology graphs

      primaryPath = FindShortestPath(flow, primaryNetwork, CostFunction)
      shadowPath = FindShortestPath(flow, shadowNetwork, CostFunction)

      primaryCost = CalculatePathCost(primaryPath, CostFunction)
      shadowCost = CalculatePathCost(shadowPath, CostFunction)

      IF shadowCost < primaryCost AND shadowPathIsAvailable() THEN
        RouteFlowOver(flow, shadowPath)
      ELSE
        RouteFlowOver(flow, primaryPath)
      ENDIF
    ENDFUNCTION

    FUNCTION CalculatePathCost(path, CostFunction)
      // CostFunction considers: bandwidth, latency, link cost, predicted disruption cost
      // Includes a 'risk factor' based on link reliability data.
      // May also incorporate a 'congestion penalty' based on real-time network load.
      RETURN calculatedCost
    ENDFUNCTION
    ```

*   **Hardware/Software Considerations:**
    *   Requires significant processing power to run predictive models and perform dynamic routing calculations.  Could be implemented using a distributed architecture.
    *   Needs real-time network monitoring capabilities to collect performance data and detect failures.
    *   Integration with existing routing protocols (e.g., BGP, OSPF) is crucial.
