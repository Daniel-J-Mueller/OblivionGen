## Dynamic Contextual Media Layering

**Concept:** Extend the activation/deactivation area concept to support layering of multiple, dynamically-sourced media streams *over* the primary media presentation, altering the user experience based on proximity and context. This isn't simply pausing/playing, but augmenting the primary content.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** "Contextual Overlay Manager" (COM) - a server-side component responsible for managing and delivering contextual media streams.
*   **Client-Side Component:** "Dynamic Layer Renderer" (DLR) - integrated into the client application, responsible for receiving and rendering overlaid media streams.
*   **Activation Zones:** Define multiple activation zones beyond a simple "play/pause" area. Each zone is associated with a specific contextual media stream or set of streams. Zones can be geometric shapes (circles, rectangles, polygons) or utilize spatial mapping (using depth cameras or AR features).
*   **Contextual Media Sources:**
    *   **Location-Based:**  Integrate with location services to deliver content relevant to the user's physical location (e.g., historical information about a building, points of interest).
    *   **Object Recognition:** Use computer vision to identify objects within the user's view (via camera input) and overlay relevant information (e.g., product details, reviews, tutorials).
    *   **User Profile-Based:** Deliver personalized content based on the user's interests, preferences, and history.
    *   **Real-Time Data:** Overlay data feeds (e.g., stock prices, weather updates, social media feeds) onto the primary media presentation.
*   **Layering & Rendering:**
    *   Layers are prioritized and rendered based on their proximity to the activation zone or the identified object.
    *   Transparency and blending options allow for seamless integration of layers.
    *   Layers can include video, audio, images, text, 3D models, and interactive elements.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Users can interact with layers (e.g., tap to expand, swipe to dismiss, voice commands).
    *   Layers can trigger actions (e.g., open a website, make a purchase, share content).

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - DLR):**

```
function updateLayers(activationZones, contextualData) {
    clearExistingLayers();

    for (zone in activationZones) {
        for (layerData in contextualData.layersForZone[zone.id]) {
            layer = createLayer(layerData.type, layerData.content, layerData.settings);
            layer.position = zone.position;
            layer.render();
        }
    }
}

function createLayer(type, content, settings) {
    switch (type) {
        case "video":
            return new VideoLayer(content, settings);
        case "image":
            return new ImageLayer(content, settings);
        case "text":
            return new TextLayer(content, settings);
        // ... other layer types
    }
}

// Layer classes (simplified)
class VideoLayer {
    constructor(content, settings) {
        this.videoElement = createVideoElement(content);
        this.settings = settings;
    }
    render() {
        // Apply settings (position, size, transparency)
        // Play video
    }
}
```

**Example Use Case:**

A user is watching a historical documentary. The system detects a building in the video frame. A contextual layer overlays information about the building’s history, architecture, and current occupants. The user can tap the layer to view a 360° virtual tour of the building's interior.
