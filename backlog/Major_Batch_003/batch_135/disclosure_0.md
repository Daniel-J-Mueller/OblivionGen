## Adaptive Haptic Scripting for Assistant Interaction

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple non-visual feedback (sound, vibration) to provide nuanced, context-aware haptic 'scripts' delivered through wearable devices (smartwatches, haptic bands, smart gloves) *during* the assistant interaction.  Instead of just indicating 'listening' or 'processing', the assistant proactively communicates *what* it's doing and *how* it's interpreting the user's speech, pre-emptively guiding the interaction.

**Specs:**

**1. Haptic Script Library:**

*   **Data Structure:** JSON-based library containing pre-defined haptic 'phrases' or 'gestures'. Each entry contains:
    *   `script_id`: Unique identifier for the haptic sequence.
    *   `context_tag`:  Keywords describing the context (e.g., "navigation", "music control", "calendar event", "question answering", "error").
    *   `haptic_sequence`: Array of haptic commands (see section 2).
    *   `intensity_profile`:  Mapping of emotional state/confidence level to haptic intensity.
    *   `priority`: Integer indicating the urgency/importance of the script.
*   **Script Creation Tool:**  Software application allowing designers to create and edit haptic scripts. GUI-based timeline editor for sequencing haptic events. Import/export functionality for script sharing.

**2. Haptic Command Set:**

*   `vibration(frequency, amplitude, duration)`: Standard vibration command. Frequency in Hz, amplitude (0-1), duration in milliseconds.
*   `wave(pattern, amplitude, duration)`:  Complex wave pattern generated through multiple actuators. `pattern` is an array of frequency/amplitude pairs.
*   `texture(type, intensity, duration)`: Simulate a texture on the skin (e.g., "smooth", "rough", "bumpy"). Requires advanced haptic actuators.
*   `directional_pulse(location, intensity, duration)`: Fire specific actuators to create a sense of direction or movement on the skin.
*   `thermal_shift(temperature, duration)`:  Utilize thermal actuators to deliver subtle temperature changes. (Optional, requires specialized hardware).

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Speech Recognition Module:**  Transcribes user speech to text.  Outputs confidence scores for each transcribed word/phrase.
*   **Intent Parser:**  Determines the user's intent based on the transcribed text.
*   **Haptic Script Selector:**  Based on intent, confidence scores, and context, selects the most appropriate haptic script from the library. Prioritizes scripts based on urgency.
*   **Haptic Driver:**  Translates the selected haptic script into actuator commands.  Handles timing and synchronization.  Manages actuator resources.
*   **Wearable Device Interface:**  Communicates with the wearable device via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi.

**4.  Pseudocode - Haptic Script Selection:**

```pseudocode
function select_haptic_script(intent, confidence_score, context):
  // Filter scripts based on context
  filtered_scripts = get_scripts_by_context(context)

  // Filter scripts based on intent
  intent_scripts = filter_scripts_by_intent(filtered_scripts, intent)

  // Sort scripts by confidence score
  sorted_scripts = sort_scripts_by_confidence(intent_scripts, confidence_score)

  // Select the highest priority script
  selected_script = sorted_scripts[0]

  return selected_script
```

**5. Example Use Cases:**

*   **Navigation:** Subtle directional pulses guide the user during turn-by-turn navigation.  Increasing pulse intensity indicates proximity to the turn.
*   **Music Control:**  'Texture' changes indicate volume adjustments. A 'wave' pattern confirms song skip/pause.
*   **Question Answering:**  A 'smooth' vibration indicates a confident answer. A 'rough' vibration indicates uncertainty.
*   **Error Handling:**  A distinct 'thermal shift' alerts the user to a critical error. A complex 'wave' pattern provides a detailed error code.
