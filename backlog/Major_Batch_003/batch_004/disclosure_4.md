## Dynamic Contextual Polygon Generation & Behavioral Weighting

**Concept:** Instead of pre-defined polygons (neighborhoods, zip codes, etc.), generate polygons *dynamically* based on user interaction density and behavioral patterns *around* an entity.  This creates micro-localizations reflecting actual engagement, not just geographic boundaries. Combine this with a more nuanced weighting system incorporating not just interaction recency and type, but also *predictive* behavioral modeling.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:**

*   **Input:** User interaction data (as per the patent), user profiles (including demographic data, declared interests, social connections), entity data (type, keywords, associated content).
*   **Preprocessing:** Clean, normalize, and timestamp all data.  Create interaction vectors for each user, representing their engagement with the entity.

**2. Dynamic Polygon Generation - 'Engagement Clusters':**

*   **Algorithm:** Implement a density-based spatial clustering algorithm (e.g., DBSCAN, OPTICS) that operates on user interaction data points (lat/long coordinates of interaction events – clicks, check-ins, etc.).
*   **Parameters:**
    *   `epsilon`:  Search radius to define neighborhood for density calculation. Adaptive `epsilon` based on user density in the area.
    *   `min_points`: Minimum number of interaction points required to form a core point (cluster). Adaptive based on overall user activity levels.
*   **Output:** A set of polygons ("Engagement Clusters") representing areas of high user interaction with the entity. These polygons are not constrained by administrative boundaries. Polygons will vary in size and shape depending on the user interaction density.

**3. Behavioral Weighting - 'Propensity Score' Modeling:**

*   **Model:** Implement a machine learning model (e.g., Gradient Boosting, Neural Network) to predict a “Propensity Score” for each user, reflecting their likelihood to *continue* interacting with the entity, or to become a high-value user.
*   **Features:**
    *   Recency of last interaction.
    *   Frequency of interactions.
    *   Type of interaction (click, share, purchase, etc.).
    *   User’s declared interests (similarity to entity’s keywords).
    *   Social connections (influence/similarity to other high-value users).
    *   Temporal patterns (time of day/week of interaction).
*   **Output:** A Propensity Score (0-1) for each user.

**4. Score Computation & Polygon Selection:**

*   **Score Formula:**  `PolygonScore = Σ (UserPropensityScore * InteractionWeight)` for all users within the polygon.  `InteractionWeight` is dynamically adjusted based on interaction type.
*   **Polygon Selection:** Select the polygon (Engagement Cluster) with the highest `PolygonScore`.  Also maintain a ranked list of top N polygons.

**5. Output & Application:**

*   **Inferred Location:** The selected polygon represents the inferred geographic location of the entity at the granularity of the polygon’s size.
*   **Targeted Content Delivery:** Utilize the ranked list of polygons to deliver highly targeted content to users within those areas, based on the entity's content and user profiles.
*   **Dynamic Advertising:** Serve ads to users within the Engagement Clusters, highlighting the entity’s presence and relevant offerings.
*    **Real-time adjustment:** Retrain the propensity score model and regenerate polygons periodically (e.g., hourly, daily) to adapt to changing user behavior and engagement patterns.



**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```python
def infer_location(user_interactions, user_profiles, entity_data):
    engagement_clusters = generate_engagement_clusters(user_interactions)
    user_propensity_scores = calculate_user_propensity_scores(user_profiles, entity_data)

    polygon_scores = {}
    for cluster in engagement_clusters:
        score = 0
        for user in cluster.users:
            score += user_propensity_scores[user] * interaction_weight(user.interactions)
        polygon_scores[cluster] = score

    selected_polygon = max(polygon_scores, key=polygon_scores.get)
    return selected_polygon
```
