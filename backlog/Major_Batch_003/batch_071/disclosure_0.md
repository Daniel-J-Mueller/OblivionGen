## Dynamic K-Value Adjustment for Multi-Stage Ranking

**Concept:** Instead of a fixed 'K' value when labeling training items, dynamically adjust 'K' based on the item's score from the target model. This introduces a nuanced labeling process, better reflecting an item's inherent relevance *before* even reaching the early-stage model.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Set of candidate training items, Target Model, Initial K-value (e.g., K=10).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Score Prediction:** For each candidate item, obtain a score from the Target Model.
    2.  **K-Value Adjustment:**  Apply a scaling function to the Target Model score to determine the dynamic K-value for that item.  
        *   `Dynamic K = Initial K * (1 + α * Normalized Score)`
            *   `α` is a hyperparameter controlling the sensitivity of K to the score (e.g., 0.5).
            *   `Normalized Score = (Score - MinScore) / (MaxScore - MinScore)` (where MinScore & MaxScore are the minimum and maximum scores across all candidate items).  This ensures the Normalized Score is between 0 and 1.
    3.  **Labeling:** Determine the probability of the item being in the top ‘Dynamic K’ using a hypergeometric distribution.  Use this probability as the label.
*   **Output:** Labeled training items with labels reflecting a dynamic top-K consideration.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function label_training_data(candidate_items, target_model, initial_k, alpha):
  min_score = min(target_model(item) for item in candidate_items)
  max_score = max(target_model(item) for item in candidate_items)

  labeled_items = []
  for item in candidate_items:
    score = target_model(item)
    normalized_score = (score - min_score) / (max_score - min_score)
    dynamic_k = initial_k * (1 + alpha * normalized_score)
    dynamic_k = round(dynamic_k) #Ensure integer value

    #Calculate probability using hypergeometric distribution
    probability = hypergeometric_probability(item, candidate_items, dynamic_k)
    labeled_items.append((item, probability))

  return labeled_items
```

**Hypergeometric Probability Function (Conceptual):**

```
function hypergeometric_probability(item, candidate_items, k):
  #This function would calculate the probability of 'item' being in the top 'k'
  #of 'candidate_items' based on the target model scores.
  #Implementation would involve calculating combinations and probabilities 
  #based on the score distribution.
  return probability # Between 0 and 1
```

**Rationale:** Items with higher scores from the Target Model should have a higher effective 'K' value during labeling. This reflects the assumption that highly relevant items are more likely to be in a larger top-K set. Conversely, low-scoring items have a lower effective 'K', emphasizing their relative unimportance. This creates a more nuanced labeling scheme that potentially improves the performance of the early-stage model.
