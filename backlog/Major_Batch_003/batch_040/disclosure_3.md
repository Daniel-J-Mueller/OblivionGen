## Dynamic Game-Thread Avatars & Emotional State Projection

**Concept:** Expand the messaging thread's visual representation beyond static avatars to incorporate dynamically rendered, emotionally responsive avatars reflecting in-game events *and* user emotional state as detected via client-side analysis (microphone/camera).

**Specification:**

1.  **Avatar Rendering Engine:** Integrate a lightweight, real-time 3D rendering engine within the messaging client.  This engine renders avatars representing users within a game thread.  Avatars are initially customizable (appearance, clothing, etc.).

2.  **In-Game Event Triggers:** The game backend sends event data to the messaging client.  Events include:
    *   Damage Taken/Dealt
    *   Critical Hits/Misses
    *   Special Ability Use
    *   Game State Changes (e.g., winning, losing, leveling up)
3.  **Emotional State Analysis:** Client-side microphone/camera access (with explicit user permission) allows analysis of user vocal tone/facial expressions.  A simple emotion classification (e.g., joy, anger, sadness, neutral) is determined. A confidence score accompanies each emotion.
4.  **Avatar Animation/Morphing:**
    *   **In-Game Event Responses:**  Avatar animations triggered by in-game events.  Examples:  Avatar recoils when damage is taken, glows when a special ability is used, adopts a victory pose upon winning.  Animation intensity scales with event magnitude.
    *   **Emotional State Projection:** Avatar facial expressions morph to reflect detected user emotions. The intensity of the morph corresponds to the emotion's confidence score. Subtlety is key â€“ avoid exaggerated or cartoonish expressions.
    *   **Combined Effects:** In-game event responses and emotional state projections are blended. For example, an avatar might display a subtle smile (emotional state) *while* momentarily flinching (damage taken).

5.  **Thread Visualization:** The messaging thread displays a horizontally scrolling row of dynamically rendered avatars.  Avatars representing currently active players are highlighted.

6.  **Data Pipeline:**
    ```
    [Game Backend] --> [Event Data (JSON)] --> [Messaging Client]
    [Microphone/Camera] --> [Emotion Analysis] --> [Emotion Data]
    [Event Data + Emotion Data] --> [Avatar Rendering Engine] --> [Thread Visualization]
    ```

7.  **Configuration Options:**
    *   Enable/disable dynamic avatars.
    *   Adjust avatar detail level (performance optimization).
    *   Control the intensity of emotional state projections.
    *   Mute microphone/camera access.

8.  **Advanced Features (Potential Future Development):**
    *   Procedural avatar customization based on in-game achievements.
    *   Integration with external emotion tracking devices (e.g., heart rate monitors).
    *   Avatar "reactions" to messages within the thread (e.g., nodding in agreement).
