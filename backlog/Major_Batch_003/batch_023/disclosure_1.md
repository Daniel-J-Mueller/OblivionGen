## Adaptive Model Lineage & Drift Compensation

**Concept:** Extend the parent/child model relationship beyond simple parameter inheritance to encompass a dynamic lineage tracking system that actively compensates for model drift in descendant models.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Lineage Graph Database:** Implement a graph database to represent the entire model lineage. Nodes represent models (identified by hash, version, and training data signature). Edges represent inheritance/transformation relationships, along with metadata:
    *   Transformation type (e.g., fine-tuning, pruning, knowledge distillation).
    *   Transformation parameters.
    *   Performance metrics *at the time of transformation*.
    *   Training data distribution characteristics (statistical moments, concept drift detection results).

2.  **Drift Detection Agents:**  Deploy lightweight drift detection agents alongside each deployed model. These agents continuously monitor incoming data against the model's original training distribution.  Metrics: Population Stability Index (PSI), Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence.

3.  **Automated Repair Pipeline Trigger:** When a drift agent detects significant drift (threshold configurable), it triggers a repair pipeline. This pipeline doesn’t retrain from scratch. Instead, it leverages the lineage graph.

4.  **Lineage-Guided Repair:**
    *   Identify the nearest "healthy" ancestor model (lowest drift since its training).
    *   Calculate a “repair vector” – the difference in parameters between the drifted model and the healthy ancestor. This focuses on *what changed* rather than a full parameter space search.
    *   Apply the repair vector to the drifted model, potentially with a scaling factor (determined via validation data).
    *   Re-deploy the repaired model.

5.  **Active Learning Integration:** When the repair vector is insufficient or validation performance remains poor, trigger an active learning loop. The system selects the most informative data points (based on uncertainty or disagreement between models in the lineage) and requests human labeling. The updated data is used to refine the repair vector.

**Pseudocode (Repair Pipeline):**

```
function repair_model(drifted_model, drift_threshold):
  drift_detected = drift_agent.check_drift(drifted_model, drift_threshold)

  if drift_detected:
    ancestor = find_nearest_healthy_ancestor(drifted_model)
    repair_vector = ancestor.parameters - drifted_model.parameters
    
    #Scale repair vector with a hyperparameter
    scaled_repair_vector = repair_vector * hyperparameter

    repaired_model.parameters = drifted_model.parameters + scaled_repair_vector

    if validation_performance(repaired_model) < threshold:
       trigger_active_learning(repaired_model)
       update_repair_vector(repaired_model, new_data)

    deploy(repaired_model)
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   Increased storage for lineage graph database and historical model parameters.
*   Moderate increase in compute resources for drift detection and repair vector calculation.
*   Requirement for real-time data access for drift monitoring.
