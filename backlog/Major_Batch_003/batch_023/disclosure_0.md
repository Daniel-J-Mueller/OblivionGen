## Dynamic Query Sharding based on Data Skew Prediction

**Concept:** Enhance query performance by proactively predicting data skew *before* query execution and dynamically adjusting query sharding (partitioning) to distribute load more evenly across worker nodes.  The existing system appears to react to straggling nodes, this proactively addresses the *cause* of straggling nodes.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Skew Profiler Module:**

*   **Function:**  Continuously monitors incoming data writes to the distributed storage cluster.  Analyzes data distributions across partitions for key columns frequently used in query filters (WHERE clauses).
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `SkewProfile`:  A data structure for each table/partition, storing:
        *   `column_stats`:  Histograms of values for key columns.
        *   `skew_factors`:  Calculated skewness values for each column (e.g., standard deviation of histogram bins).
        *   `last_updated`: Timestamp of last data analysis.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  On data write, extract values from key columns.
    2.  Update histograms for the relevant `SkewProfile`.
    3.  Recalculate `skew_factors` based on the updated histograms.  Use a rolling average to smooth out transient data patterns.
    4.  Store `SkewProfile` in a dedicated metadata store (e.g., a key-value database).

**2. Query Planner Enhancement:**

*   **Integration:** The Query Planner module is modified to integrate with the Data Skew Profiler.
*   **Skew Detection:**
    1.  When a query is received, the Query Planner identifies the key columns used in filters.
    2.  It retrieves the corresponding `SkewProfile` from the metadata store.
    3.  If the `skew_factors` exceed a predefined threshold (tunable parameter), data skew is detected.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:**
    1.  If skew is detected, the Query Planner dynamically adjusts the number of shards (partitions) for the query.
    2.  The number of shards is increased proportionally to the degree of skew.  For example, if a column has a skew factor of 2, the number of shards is doubled.
    3.  The Query Planner generates a new query plan with the increased number of shards.
    4.  A "Shard Assignment Strategy" is employed to distribute the data more evenly.  Options include:
        *   **Hash Sharding:** Hash key values across shards.
        *   **Range Sharding:** Divide the data into ranges based on key values, assigning each range to a shard. This needs careful consideration to avoid creating hotspots.
        *   **Sampling & Assignment:** Sample the data, identify skewed values, and assign those values to dedicated shards.
*   **Metadata Propagation:**  The modified query plan and shard assignments are passed to the Gateway Server.

**3. Gateway Server Adaptation:**

*   **Shard Distribution:** The Gateway Server receives the modified query plan and shard assignments.  It distributes the partial queries to the worker nodes based on these assignments.
*   **Dynamic Task Allocation:**  If a worker node is overloaded, the Gateway Server can dynamically reassign tasks to other, less-loaded nodes.
*   **Performance Monitoring:**  The Gateway Server monitors the performance of each worker node and adjusts task allocation accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Query Planner Enhancement):**

```
function planQuery(query):
  skewProfiles = getDataSkewProfiles(query.filters)
  if any(skewProfiles.skewFactor > skewThreshold):
    numShards = calculateNumShards(skewProfiles)  // Based on skew factors
    newQueryPlan = generateShardedQueryPlan(query, numShards)
    return newQueryPlan
  else:
    return generateStandardQueryPlan(query)
```

**Novelty:** The proactive approach to query optimization, based on continuous data skew profiling *before* query execution, sets this apart from reactive systems that address straggling nodes only after they occur. This aims to prevent performance bottlenecks from occurring in the first place by distributing the workload more evenly.
