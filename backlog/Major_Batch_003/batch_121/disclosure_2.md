## Distributed Sensory Network with Optical Interconnects

**Concept:** Expand the disaggregated component model to include a distributed network of specialized sensors, all optically interconnected and managed by the existing resource-managing package. This creates a highly flexible, scalable, and low-latency data acquisition and processing system.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Modules:** Small, dedicated hardware modules focusing on specific sensing tasks (e.g., high-speed imaging, LiDAR, acoustic sensing, chemical analysis, pressure mapping). Each module contains:
    *   Dedicated sensor hardware.
    *   Analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) with high sampling rates and resolution.
    *   First Optical Chiplet: Transceiver for optical communication, converting digital sensor data into optical signals.
    *   Local Edge Processing: Minimal processing capability for pre-filtering, noise reduction, and data compression.
*   **Optical Mesh Network:** Sensor modules are interconnected via a multi-dimensional optical mesh network.
    *   Optical waveguides embedded within a structural substrate (e.g., a PCB, a molded plastic structure).
    *   Bidirectional optical communication between modules.
    *   Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) to maximize bandwidth and support multiple simultaneous data streams.
*   **Resource-Managing Package Enhancement:** Modify the existing resource-managing package to:
    *   Network Management: Implement protocols for discovering, configuring, and monitoring sensor modules within the optical mesh.
    *   Data Aggregation & Distribution: Aggregate data streams from multiple sensors. Distribute data to the processor package or external destinations.
    *   Sensor Fusion: Execute algorithms for combining data from different sensors to create a more complete and accurate representation of the environment.
    *   Dynamic Resource Allocation: Allocate processing resources (within the processor package) to specific sensors based on demand.
*   **Optical Interfaces:**
    *   Sensor Modules: Utilize compact, low-power optical transceivers integrated directly onto the sensor PCB.
    *   Resource-Managing Package: Integrate a high-bandwidth optical switch to route data streams between sensors and the processor package.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Scale out by adding more sensor modules to the optical mesh.
    *   Multiple resource-managing packages can be deployed to handle larger sensor networks.
    *   The processor package can be repurposed for various tasks, including machine learning, data analysis, and control.

**Pseudocode (Resource-Managing Package â€“ Network Discovery):**

```
FUNCTION discover_sensors():
    sensor_list = []
    FOR wavelength IN wavelengths:
        send_discovery_signal(wavelength)
        WHILE timeout_not_reached():
            response = receive_signal(wavelength)
            IF response != null:
                sensor_id = extract_sensor_id(response)
                sensor_type = extract_sensor_type(response)
                sensor_data = { "id": sensor_id, "type": sensor_type }
                sensor_list.append(sensor_data)
    RETURN sensor_list

FUNCTION send_discovery_signal(wavelength):
    // Construct a broadcast message with a unique identifier
    message = "DISCOVERY_REQUEST_" + generate_unique_id()
    // Modulate the message onto the specified wavelength
    modulated_signal = modulate(message, wavelength)
    // Transmit the modulated signal over the optical network

FUNCTION receive_signal(wavelength):
    // Listen for signals on the specified wavelength
    signal = listen(wavelength)
    IF signal != null:
        // Demodulate the signal
        message = demodulate(signal)
        RETURN message
    ELSE:
        RETURN null
```
