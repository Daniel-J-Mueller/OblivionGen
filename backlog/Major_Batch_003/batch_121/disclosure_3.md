## Dynamic Agent Composition via Skill Graphs

**Concept:** Extend the agent determination process beyond simple task association to a dynamic composition of agent *skills*. Instead of selecting agents whole-cloth, decompose tasks into sub-skills and compose agents with the *specific* skills needed, even if that means combining parts of multiple agents.

**Specs:**

1.  **Skill Graph Database:** Construct a graph database representing agent capabilities. Nodes are individual skills (e.g., “retrieve weather data”, “format date string”, “translate to Spanish”). Edges represent dependencies (e.g., “format date string” requires “parse date string”). Each skill is linked to the agents possessing it. Skills should also have associated confidence scores, representing an agent's proficiency.
2.  **Task Decomposition Module:**  Incoming dialog-intents are parsed into a skill dependency graph. This module utilizes a pre-trained (or dynamically trained) model to break down high-level intents into granular skill requirements. For example, "Book a flight to London next Tuesday" decomposes into:
    *   “Understand date”
    *   “Understand location”
    *   “Query flight availability”
    *   “Present flight options”
3.  **Skill-Based Agent Selection & Composition Engine:** This engine traverses the Skill Graph to identify agents possessing the required skills.
    *   If a single agent possesses *all* necessary skills, that agent is selected.
    *   If skills are distributed across multiple agents, the engine *composes* a new, virtual agent. This composition involves:
        *   Identifying the necessary skill modules from different agents.
        *   Establishing a communication pipeline between these modules.  (API calls, message queues, etc.)
        *   Creating a unified interface for the virtual agent.
4.  **Dynamic Interface Generation:**  A module that dynamically generates the necessary APIs and data transformations to enable communication between composed agent modules. This could leverage a schema definition language (like GraphQL) for flexibility.
5.  **Real-Time Performance Monitoring:** Track the execution time of each composed skill module. Use this data to:
    *   Identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   Dynamically re-compose agents to optimize for speed.
    *   Update skill confidence scores based on real-world usage.
6.  **API Standardization:** Every agent skill is wrapped inside a standardized API. A common schema and messaging protocol are utilized.

**Pseudocode (Skill Composition):**

```
function compose_agent(task_skill_graph):
  skill_mapping = {}
  for skill in task_skill_graph.nodes:
    candidate_agents = query_skill_graph(skill) // Returns agents with that skill + confidence
    best_agent = select_best_agent(candidate_agents) // Based on confidence, latency, etc.
    skill_mapping[skill] = best_agent

  virtual_agent_interface = generate_interface(skill_mapping) // Combines agent APIs
  return virtual_agent_interface
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond selecting *agents* to composing *capabilities*.  It allows for highly customized responses and efficient resource utilization. By dynamically combining skills, the system isn’t limited by the monolithic nature of pre-defined agents.
