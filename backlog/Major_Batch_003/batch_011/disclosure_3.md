**Personalized Anticipatory Gifting Network with Collaborative Budgeting**

**System Overview:**

The system extends the patent’s predictive life event targeting by introducing a collaborative gifting network. Instead of simply *suggesting* gifts to friends, the system facilitates a coordinated, budgeted contribution towards a single, significant gift.  It's a 'group gift' reimagined with AI-driven personalization and proactive contribution requests.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Predictive Event Engine:** (Inherited from the patent, but extended).  Continues to predict life events, but now assigns a ‘Gift Significance Score’ (GSS) based on the event type, user’s social connections, and past gifting patterns. Higher GSS triggers more proactive network engagement.

2.  **Network Coordinator Module:**
    *   Identifies potential contributors (friends/family of the target user) and their typical gifting budgets (derived from historical data).
    *   Calculates an optimal ‘Group Gift Budget’ based on the GSS and contributor budgets.
    *   Determines a ‘Fair Share’ contribution amount for each potential contributor.

3.  **Gift Preference Elicitation Engine:**
    *   Gathers gift preferences *before* the event. This is achieved through:
        *   Passive data collection (wish lists, browsing history, social media posts).
        *   Active preference elicitation via subtle in-app surveys (“If you were to gift [target user] something for a significant occasion, what comes to mind?” with selectable categories/themes).
        *   Direct question: “If a group gift were planned for [target user], what would be the ideal price range?”.
    *   Uses Machine Learning to generate a ranked list of potential gifts, with associated price points.

4.  **Collaborative Budgeting Interface:**
    *   Presents the ranked gift list to the potential contributors.
    *   Allows contributors to:
        *   ‘Pledge’ a contribution amount (which can be adjusted from the ‘Fair Share’ amount).
        *   Vote on their preferred gift from the list.
        *   Suggest alternative gifts.
        *   View the collective progress towards the group gift budget.

5.  **Automated Fulfillment Module:**
    *   Once the budget is met, the system automatically purchases the most popular gift (or a similar item if the original is unavailable).
    *   Coordinates shipping and delivery, potentially allowing contributors to add personalized messages.
    *   Provides a digital ‘gift registry’ to prevent duplicate gifting.

**Pseudocode (Network Coordinator & Budgeting):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateGroupGiftBudget(targetUser, eventType, GSS)
    potentialContributors = GetFriends(targetUser)
    contributorBudgets = [GetTypicalGiftBudget(user) FOR user IN potentialContributors]
    totalBudget = SUM(contributorBudgets) * GSS //Scale by GSS
    optimalBudget = MIN(totalBudget, DesiredMaxBudget) // Cap budget
    RETURN optimalBudget

FUNCTION DetermineFairShare(contributor, optimalBudget, numContributors)
    fairShare = optimalBudget / numContributors
    //Adjust based on contributor's past gifting habits (optional)
    RETURN fairShare

FUNCTION ManageContribution(contributor, pledgedAmount)
    // Update contribution status
    // Check if budget goal is met
    IF BudgetGoalReached():
        InitiateGiftPurchase()
    ENDIF
ENDIF

FUNCTION InitiateGiftPurchase():
    //Determine most popular gift based on votes
    selectedGift = GetMostPopularGift()
    PurchaseGift(selectedGift)
    ShipGift(targetUser)
ENDIF
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **Proactive Budgeting:**  Rather than reacting to an event, the system proactively builds a collective gift budget *before* the event occurs.
*   **Dynamic Fair Share:** Contribution amounts are calculated based on individual budgets and adjusted over time.
*   **Collaborative Gift Selection:** Contributors have a voice in choosing the final gift.
*   **GSS Integration:** Scaling the budget based on the predicted significance of the event ensures that larger occasions receive more substantial gifts.
