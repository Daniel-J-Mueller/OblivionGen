**Interactive Story World Generation**

**Concept:** Extend the interactive map functionality to generate a dynamic, explorable 3D world based on the multi-author story content. Instead of just displaying feed posts *on* a map, build a world *from* the story.

**Specs:**

1.  **World Seed Generation:**
    *   Input: Multi-author story text, associated feed post data (location, hashtags, topics, images).
    *   Process:
        *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract key entities (characters, locations, objects, events) and relationships.
        *   Geographic data association: Link identified locations to real-world coordinates if possible, otherwise generate procedural locations.
        *   Theme/Genre detection: Identify story genre (fantasy, sci-fi, historical) to inform visual style.
        *   World seed creation: Generate a unique seed based on extracted data and genre.
2.  **Procedural World Generation:**
    *   Input: World seed.
    *   Process:
        *   Terrain Generation: Create terrain based on story setting (mountains, forests, cities). Algorithms to blend terrain to match extracted descriptive keywords.
        *   Object Placement: Populate the world with objects and structures related to the story. Utilize object recognition on associated images/feed posts. (e.g., If a post shows a coffee shop, generate a coffee shop model).
        *   Character Representation: Generate simplified character models based on descriptions or associated profile pictures.
        *   Event Trigger Zones: Define areas where specific story events occur, triggering visual or audio cues.
3.  **Interactive Exploration:**
    *   User Interface: First-person or third-person perspective.
    *   Movement: Standard game-style movement controls.
    *   Interaction:
        *   Clickable Objects: Interact with objects to reveal story details or trigger events.
        *   Character Interaction: Engage with character models to access dialogue or backstory.
        *   Feed Post Integration: Display associated feed posts as in-world "documents" or projections.
        *   AR Overlay: Enable AR mode to overlay the generated world onto the user's real-world environment.
4.  **Dynamic Content Updates:**
    *   Real-time Feed Integration: Continuously monitor associated feed posts for new content.
    *   World Modification: Update the generated world based on new feed post data (e.g., add new buildings, modify terrain, introduce new characters).
    *   User Contribution: Allow users to contribute to the world by submitting their own content (text, images, models).

**Pseudocode (World Generation):**

```
function generateWorld(storyText, feedPosts) {
  entities = extractEntities(storyText);
  locations = resolveLocations(entities);
  worldSeed = createSeed(entities, locations);
  world = generateTerrain(worldSeed);
  placeObjects(world, feedPosts);
  populateCharacters(world, entities);
  addEventTriggers(world, feedPosts);
  return world;
}
```

**Potential Expansion:** Implement a collaborative world-building feature where multiple users can contribute to and modify the generated world in real-time. Introduce AI-powered NPCs that react to user actions and dynamically advance the story. Allow for user-created quests and challenges within the generated world.
