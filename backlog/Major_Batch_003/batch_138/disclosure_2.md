## Dynamic Nanophotonic Stress Mapping with Integrated Piezoelectric Harvesting

**Concept:** Extend the nanophotonic waveguide concept to function as a dynamic stress sensor, coupled with piezoelectric materials for energy harvesting from structural vibrations. Instead of *just* directing light, the waveguide itself *responds* to stress, altering its optical properties in a measurable way.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Waveguide Material:** Silicon Nitride (Si3N4) – chosen for high refractive index contrast, mechanical strength, and established fabrication processes.

2.  **Piezoelectric Integration:**  A thin film of Aluminum Nitride (AlN) is deposited *around* the Si3N4 waveguide. This creates a mechanically coupled system. The AlN serves as the piezoelectric element.

3.  **Waveguide Geometry:** The waveguide is not a simple linear structure. It’s a series of interconnected “islands” or segments with narrow “necks” connecting them. This geometry *concentrates* stress at the necks when external force is applied. The necks contain micro-ring resonators.

4.  **Resonator Design:** Each micro-ring resonator is designed to have a high Q-factor. The resonant wavelength is sensitive to changes in the refractive index of the surrounding material *and* the physical deformation of the ring itself.

5.  **Optical Interrogation:** A tunable laser sweeps across the resonant wavelengths of the micro-rings. Any applied stress causes a shift in the resonant wavelength. The *magnitude* of the shift is proportional to the stress.

6.  **Signal Processing:**
    *   **Wavelength Shift Detection:** High-resolution spectrometer detects the resonant wavelength shifts.
    *   **Stress Mapping:** The wavelength shifts are correlated with the location of each micro-ring resonator, creating a 2D or 3D stress map of the structure.
    *   **Data Fusion:** Combine stress data with accelerometer readings to further refine the analysis.

7.  **Energy Harvesting:** The piezoelectric AlN layer generates electrical charge in response to the structural vibrations that *cause* the stress. This harvested energy can be used to power the optical interrogation system, or other low-power sensors.

8.  **Fabrication Process:**
    *   Start with a silicon substrate.
    *   Deposit and pattern Si3N4 using plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and reactive ion etching (RIE).
    *   Deposit a layer of AlN using atomic layer deposition (ALD).
    *   Pattern the AlN layer using RIE to create electrodes for energy harvesting.
    *   Connect the waveguide to external optics for interrogation and data transmission.

**Pseudocode for Data Processing:**

```
FUNCTION analyze_stress_map(wavelength_shifts, resonator_locations):
    // wavelength_shifts: Array of wavelength shifts for each resonator
    // resonator_locations: Array of 2D/3D coordinates for each resonator

    stress_map = empty_map()

    FOR i IN range(length(wavelength_shifts)):
        wavelength_shift = wavelength_shifts[i]
        location = resonator_locations[i]

        // Convert wavelength shift to stress value using calibration data
        stress_value = calibrate(wavelength_shift)

        // Add stress value to stress map at corresponding location
        stress_map[location] = stress_value

    RETURN stress_map
