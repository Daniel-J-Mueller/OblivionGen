**Dynamic Contextual Remixing**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the digest interface concept to allow users to *remix* short-form video segments within the digest, creating derivative content on-the-fly. This isn’t about full video editing; it’s about fast, low-friction recombination.

**II. Functional Components:**

*   **Segment Identification:** System automatically identifies key segments (3-5 seconds) within each short-form video tile. This uses visual and audio analysis (scene detection, speech-to-text, etc.).
*   **Remix Canvas:** Within the digest interface, selecting a tile presents a small "Remix" option. This opens a simplified canvas displaying the identified segments as draggable tiles.
*   **Segment Drag & Drop:** Users can drag and drop segments from different tiles onto a timeline. Timeline length is limited (e.g., 15-30 seconds) to encourage brevity.
*   **Basic Transitions:** Pre-defined, simple transitions (crossfade, cut, wipe) are available to connect segments.
*   **Audio Ducking/Mixing:** System automatically ducks audio levels when segments with overlapping speech are combined. Basic audio mixing controls (volume, pan) are provided.
*   **AI-Assisted Prompting:**  A text input allows users to add a prompt like, “make it funny” or “highlight the action”.  The AI then intelligently chooses segments to match the prompt if the user doesn’t pick.
*   **Output & Sharing:** The resulting remix is a new, short-form video shared within the platform.  Original video creators are credited.
*   **Remix Chain:** Allow remixes to be remixed. (Remix of a remix).

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION open_digest_interface(topic)
    display tiles organized by subtopic
    FOR each tile DO
        ON tile_selected DO
            IF remix_option_selected THEN
                open_remix_canvas(tile)
            ELSE
                play_video(tile)
            ENDIF
        ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION open_remix_canvas(selected_tile)
    create remix_canvas
    load segments from selected_tile
    display segment thumbnails
    create timeline
    display basic transitions
    ON segment_dragged TO timeline DO
        add_segment_to_timeline(segment)
    ENDFOR
    ON transition_selected DO
        apply_transition(timeline, transition)
    ENDFOR
    ON prompt_entered DO
      AI_segment_selection(prompt)
    ENDFOR
    ON render_button_clicked DO
        render_remix_video(timeline)
        share_remix_video(video)
    ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION
```

**IV.  Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Cloud-based video processing is essential for rendering remixes quickly.
*   AI models for segment selection and audio processing.
*   Optimized video codecs for low-latency playback and sharing.
*   Mobile app and web interface.
