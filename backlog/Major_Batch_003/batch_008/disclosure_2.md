## Dynamic Engagement Weighting Based on Temporal Decay & Network Topology

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**  A system to dynamically adjust the weight given to social engagements when calculating the social-engagement score. This differs from a static weighting by incorporating both *temporal decay* (older engagements matter less) and *network topology* (engagements from highly connected/influential users matter more).

**II. Data Inputs:**

*   **Content Item:**  The digital content being evaluated (post, video, article, etc.).
*   **Engagement Events:**  A chronological log of all social engagements with the content (comments, shares, likes, emoji reactions, etc.).  Each event includes a timestamp and user ID.
*   **User Network Graph:**  A data structure representing the social network of platform users.  Nodes are users; edges represent connections (follows, friendships, etc.).  Edge weights could represent interaction frequency or strength of relationship.
*   **Decay Parameter (α):**  A configurable value (0 < α < 1) controlling the rate of temporal decay.  Higher values mean faster decay.
*   **Influence Parameter (β):**  A configurable value controlling the weighting of user influence.

**III. Algorithm – Calculating Weighted Engagement Score:**

1.  **Temporal Decay Calculation:** For each engagement event *i*, calculate a decay factor *D<sub>i</sub>* based on its age:

    *   *D<sub>i</sub>* =  e<sup>-α * (Current Time - Timestamp<sub>i</sub>)</sup>

    This exponential decay function ensures that more recent engagements have a higher weight.

2.  **Influence Score Calculation:** For each user *u* who generated an engagement, calculate an influence score *I<sub>u</sub>* based on the user network graph:

    *   *I<sub>u</sub>* =  Degree(u) + Σ (Weight(u,v) * Degree(v)) for all neighbors *v* of *u*.

    This considers both the number of direct connections (Degree) and the influence of *u*'s connections. (Alternative: PageRank could be used instead).

3.  **Weighted Engagement Value:** For each engagement event *i*, calculate a weighted engagement value *W<sub>i</sub>*:

    *   *W<sub>i</sub>* = *D<sub>i</sub>* * *I<sub>u</sub>* * EngagementTypeWeight

    Where EngagementTypeWeight is a fixed value based on the type of engagement (e.g. Share = 2, Comment = 1, Like = 0.5).

4.  **Social Engagement Score:** Calculate the overall social engagement score by summing the weighted engagement values for all engagement events associated with the content:

    *   Social Engagement Score = Σ *W<sub>i</sub>*

**IV. System Components:**

*   **Engagement Data Collector:**  Module to capture and log all social engagement events in real-time.
*   **Network Graph Manager:**  Module to maintain and update the user network graph.  Must handle real-time changes (new connections, removed connections).
*   **Score Calculation Engine:**  Module to implement the weighted score calculation algorithm.  Should be optimized for performance.
*   **Configuration Manager:** Module to allow adjustment of the decay parameter (α) and influence parameter (β).
*   **API Endpoint:**  An API to provide access to the social engagement score for any content item.

**V. Potential Refinements:**

*   **Content-Specific Decay:**  Allow different decay rates for different content types.  (e.g., news articles might have a faster decay than evergreen content).
*   **Community Detection:** Incorporate community detection algorithms to identify influential users within specific sub-communities.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:**  Integrate sentiment analysis to weight positive engagements higher than negative engagements.
*   **Bot Detection:** Filter out engagements from known bots or fake accounts.
