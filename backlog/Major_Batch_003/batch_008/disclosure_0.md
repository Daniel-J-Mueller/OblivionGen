## Dynamic Media "Mood Boards" & Contextual Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple search and presentation of media items within messaging. Introduce a system for generating dynamic “mood boards” *automatically* based on the ongoing conversation’s sentiment *and* user-defined aesthetic preferences.

**Specs:**

**1. Sentiment & Aesthetic Profile Creation:**

*   **User Profile:** Store user aesthetic preferences (color palettes, visual styles - e.g., “minimalist”, “vibrant”, “vintage”, “cyberpunk”). This could be done via explicit settings or, preferably, inferred from liked/saved media across various platforms (with user permission).
*   **Conversation Sentiment Analysis:** Real-time analysis of message content (text, emojis) to determine prevailing mood (joyful, sad, angry, reflective, etc.). Utilize a multi-layered analysis – lexical analysis (keywords), semantic understanding (natural language processing), and emoji/sticker interpretation.
*   **Dynamic Profile Combination:** Blend user aesthetic preferences *with* current conversation sentiment to create a ‘dynamic profile’.  Example: User likes “vintage” visuals + conversation is “joyful” -> dynamic profile prioritizes brightly colored vintage-style images/GIFs.

**2. Media Generation & Curation Pipeline:**

*   **Multi-Source Media Access:** Integrate with a wide range of media providers (image libraries, GIF databases, video platforms, music streaming services).
*   **AI-Powered Media Generation:**  Employ generative AI models (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion) to *create* unique media content tailored to the dynamic profile. Parameters for generation include:
    *   *Style:* Based on aesthetic preferences.
    *   *Mood:* Derived from sentiment analysis.
    *   *Keywords:* Extracted from conversation.
    *   *Aspect Ratio/Format:* Adaptable to messaging app constraints.
*   **Hybrid Curation:** Combine AI-generated media *with* curated content from existing libraries.  Rank content based on relevance to the dynamic profile.
*   **"Mood Board" Assembly:**  Automatically arrange selected media into a visually cohesive “mood board” (grid, carousel, collage).

**3. User Interface Integration:**

*   **Contextual Suggestion:**  Present “mood board” suggestions *within* the messaging interface, alongside the text input field.
*   **Interactive Editing:** Allow users to:
    *   *Refresh:* Generate a new mood board based on the current profile.
    *   *Customize:*  Swap out individual media items.
    *   *Adjust Style:* Fine-tune aesthetic preferences.
    *   *Save Profiles:* Create and save custom profiles for different conversational contexts.
*   **Sharing Options:**  Enable users to share the entire mood board or individual items directly within the message.
*   **"Vibe Check" Feature:**  A dedicated command/button to instantly generate a mood board reflecting the current conversation.

**Pseudocode (Mood Board Generation):**

```
function generateMoodBoard(conversationContext, userPreferences) {
  sentiment = analyzeSentiment(conversationContext);
  dynamicProfile = combinePreferences(userPreferences, sentiment);

  generatedMedia = generateAIContent(dynamicProfile);
  curatedMedia = retrieveRelevantMedia(dynamicProfile);

  combinedMedia = mergeAndRank(generatedMedia, curatedMedia);

  moodBoardLayout = chooseLayout(combinedMedia.length);
  moodBoard = createMoodBoard(moodBoardLayout, combinedMedia);

  return moodBoard;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Music Integration:** Automatically suggest background music to complement the mood board.
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Project mood boards into the user’s physical environment using augmented or virtual reality.
*   **Collaborative Mood Boards:** Allow multiple users to contribute to a shared mood board in real-time.
*   **Integration with external creative applications:** Allow users to export mood boards to design tools like Photoshop or Figma.
