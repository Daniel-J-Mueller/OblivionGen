## Dynamic Icon Morphing & Predictive Task Display

**Concept:** A display system where icons aren't static, but *morph* based on real-time data and predicted user needs. This goes beyond simple animations; the *shape* of the icon changes, creating a fluid, organic interface.

**Specs:**

*   **Icon Data Structure:** Icons are defined not as static images, but as a set of Bezier curves or splines.  Each curve represents a core visual element of the icon (e.g., a circle, a line, a rectangle). Associated with each curve are:
    *   `basePoints`: An array of coordinate pairs defining the initial shape.
    *   `dynamicOffsets`: An array of scalar values. Each value corresponds to a basePoint and dictates how much that point can move.
    *   `triggerConditions`: Boolean expressions linked to data streams (e.g., battery level, network signal, app usage frequency, calendar events, location).
    *   `morphSpeed`: A float value determining the animation duration for a morph.
    *   `iconType`: Categorization for predictive behavior (e.g., communication, utility, entertainment).
*   **Data Input Streams:**
    *   System data (battery, signal, memory).
    *   App usage data (frequency, duration, last used).
    *   Calendar events (time, location, attendees).
    *   Location data (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation).
    *   User interaction history (clicks, swipes, app launches).
*   **Morphing Engine:**
    *   `calculateMorphOffset(dataStream, triggerCondition, basePoint, dynamicOffset)`:  A function that takes a data stream, a trigger condition, a base point, and a dynamic offset. It evaluates the trigger condition against the data stream. If true, it scales the dynamic offset. The result is added to the base point to calculate the new point position.
    *   `morphIcon(iconData, dataStreams)`: This function iterates through each curve in the icon data. For each curve, it iterates through the points. It calls `calculateMorphOffset` for each point using the appropriate data stream and trigger condition. It then updates the point's position. Finally, it redraws the icon using the updated points.
*   **Predictive Display Logic:**
    *   An AI module analyzes user behavior and predicts the user’s next task/app.
    *   Based on the prediction, the relevant icon starts to *pre-morph* – subtly shifting its shape towards the visual representation of the predicted task. For example, if the user frequently opens a messaging app after checking email, the email icon might start to subtly morph towards a speech bubble shape *before* the user explicitly opens the messaging app.
*   **User Customization:**
    *   Users can define their own trigger conditions and morph behaviors for each icon.
    *   Users can set a "morph sensitivity" slider to control how aggressively the icons morph.
    *   A "learning mode" allows the system to automatically learn the user’s preferences.

**Pseudocode Example (Morphing Email Icon Based on Unread Message Count):**

```pseudocode
// Icon Data (Email Icon)
emailIcon.basePoints = [ (10,10), (90,10), (90,90), (10,90) ]
emailIcon.dynamicOffsets = [ 2, 2, 2, 2 ]
emailIcon.triggerConditions = [ "unreadMessageCount > 0" ]
emailIcon.morphSpeed = 0.5

// Data Stream
unreadMessageCount = getUnreadMessageCount()

// Morph Function
function morphEmailIcon() {
    if (unreadMessageCount > 0) {
        // Scale dynamic offset based on unread count
        offsetScale = map(unreadMessageCount, 0, 10, 0.5, 2)  // Map to a range of 0.5 to 2

        for (i = 0; i < emailIcon.basePoints.length; i++) {
            newX = emailIcon.basePoints[i].x + (emailIcon.dynamicOffsets[i] * offsetScale)
            newY = emailIcon.basePoints[i].y + (emailIcon.dynamicOffsets[i] * offsetScale)
            emailIcon.basePoints[i] = (newX, newY)
        }

        redrawIcon(emailIcon.basePoints) // Redraw the icon with the morphed points
    }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Haptic Feedback:** Link icon morphing to haptic feedback, providing tactile confirmation of the changes.
*   **Context-Aware Morphing:**  Factor in environmental context (location, time of day) to influence icon morphing.
*   **Procedural Icon Generation:**  Combine morphing with procedural icon generation, creating truly unique and dynamic visual representations.
