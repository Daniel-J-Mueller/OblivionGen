## Dynamic Dataflow Graph Partitioning with Inter-Cluster Memory Sharing

**Concept:** Extend the spatial tiling approach to dynamically construct and partition a dataflow graph *across* tensor processor clusters, enabling fine-grained workload balancing and memory optimization. Instead of static spatial partitioning, the system will analyze the dataflow graph and dynamically assign subgraphs to clusters based on real-time resource availability and data dependencies.  Crucially, a shared, distributed memory pool will be utilized between clusters, minimizing data transfer overhead.

**Specifications:**

*   **Dataflow Graph Compiler:** A pre-processing stage that transforms the machine learning model into a dataflow graph representing the computational steps. The compiler will annotate each node with estimated computational cost, data size, and dependency information.
*   **Dynamic Partitioning Engine:** This engine runs *before* execution. It receives the dataflow graph and dynamically partitions it into subgraphs, assigning each subgraph to a specific tensor processor cluster. The partitioning algorithm considers:
    *   **Cluster Resource Availability:**  CPU/GPU load, memory availability, and inter-cluster communication bandwidth.
    *   **Data Dependency Analysis:**  Minimizing data transfer between clusters by co-locating dependent operations.
    *   **Workload Balancing:** Distributing the computational load evenly across clusters.
*   **Shared Distributed Memory Pool:** A system where each cluster contributes a portion of its memory to a shared pool. This pool is managed by a distributed memory manager that provides a unified address space across clusters.  Data can be directly accessed by any cluster without explicit copying, using remote memory access protocols.
*   **Remote Memory Access Protocol:** A hardware-accelerated protocol that enables low-latency, high-bandwidth access to remote memory. Utilizing technologies like RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) or a custom interconnect.
*   **Synchronization Primitives:** Distributed locks and barriers to ensure data consistency and proper synchronization between clusters executing parallel subgraphs.
*   **Runtime Adaptation:** A monitoring system that tracks cluster resource utilization and data transfer rates during execution. If bottlenecks are detected, the partitioning engine can dynamically re-partition the dataflow graph and re-assign subgraphs to different clusters.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Partitioning Engine):**

```pseudocode
function dynamicPartition(dataflowGraph, clusterList):
  subgraphList = decompose(dataflowGraph) // Split graph into smaller subgraphs
  assignedSubgraphs = []
  for subgraph in subgraphList:
    bestCluster = findBestCluster(subgraph, clusterList) //Considering Resource Availability & Dependencies
    assignedSubgraphs.append((subgraph, bestCluster))
    updateClusterResources(bestCluster, subgraph) //update memory/compute load
  return assignedSubgraphs

function findBestCluster(subgraph, clusterList):
  bestCluster = null
  minCost = infinity
  for cluster in clusterList:
    cost = calculatePartitioningCost(subgraph, cluster) //Considers dependencies & communication
    if cost < minCost:
      minCost = cost
      bestCluster = cluster
  return bestCluster

function calculatePartitioningCost(subgraph, cluster):
  // Considers:
  // - Computational cost of the subgraph
  // - Data transfer cost to/from the cluster
  // - Dependency costs (data transfer between nodes)
  // - Cluster resource availability (cost increase if cluster is overloaded)
  return cost
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-bandwidth, low-latency interconnect between tensor processor clusters (e.g., NVLink, InfiniBand).
*   Hardware acceleration for remote memory access protocols.
*   Dedicated hardware for synchronization primitives.
*   Each cluster needs a local memory controller capable of accessing the shared distributed memory pool.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved workload balancing and resource utilization.
*   Reduced data transfer overhead.
*   Increased scalability.
*   Enhanced performance for large-scale machine learning models.
*   Dynamic adaptation to changing workloads and resource availability.
