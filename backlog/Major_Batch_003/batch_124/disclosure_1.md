## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System Integrated with Eyewear Antenna

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback actuators within the eyewear frame, directly linked to the antenna system and signal analysis. This allows for directional indication of signal source/strength, notification relay, and even augmented reality interaction via tactile cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Actuator Type:** Micro-pneumatic or piezoelectric actuators (approx. 3mm x 3mm x 1mm) embedded within the temple arms and bridge of the eyewear.  Multiple actuators per arm/bridge (minimum 4 per arm, 2 per bridge).
*   **Actuator Control:** Custom ASIC/FPGA located within the temple arm circuit assembly.  Individual control over each actuator.
*   **Signal Processing:**  Antenna system feeds signal strength and direction data to the control ASIC.  Algorithm translates signal data into actuator activation patterns.
*   **Activation Patterns:**
    *   **Directional Indication:**  Actuators on the side of the eyewear corresponding to the signal source are activated with intensity proportional to signal strength.
    *   **Notification Relay:**  Specific actuator patterns for different notifications (e.g., short pulse for text, long pulse for call).  Pattern customizable by user.
    *   **AR Interaction:** Activation patterns mapped to virtual objects or events in an AR environment.  For example, 'feeling' the edge of a virtual button.
*   **Power:**  Integrated rechargeable battery within the temple arm.  Wireless charging capable.
*   **Materials:**  Actuators encapsulated in flexible, biocompatible silicone to ensure comfort and durability.
*   **Software:**  Companion mobile application for customization of actuator patterns, notification settings, and AR interaction mappings.
*   **Antenna Integration:** The antenna traces, alongside supporting the wireless communication, also provide the low-voltage power rails for the haptic actuators. The antenna tuner logic is augmented to include control signals for the haptic actuator array.

**Pseudocode for Signal Processing & Actuator Control:**

```pseudocode
// Input: Signal Strength Array (SSA) - from antenna system
//        Directional Angle (DA) - from antenna system
// Output: Actuator Activation Array (AAA)

function controlHaptics(SSA, DA):
    // Normalize SSA values to a 0-1 range
    normalizedSSA = normalize(SSA)

    // Map normalized SSA values to actuator intensity (0-100%)
    actuatorIntensity = map(normalizedSSA, 0, 1, 0, 100)

    // Calculate actuator activation pattern based on DA
    AAA = calculateActivationPattern(DA, actuatorIntensity)

    // Apply AAA to individual actuators
    for each actuator in actuatorArray:
        actuator.activate(AAA[actuator.id])

    return AAA

function calculateActivationPattern(DA, intensity):
    // Define actuator positions
    actuatorPositions = [0, 45, 90, 135, 180] // Degrees relative to front

    // Calculate distance between DA and each actuator position
    distances = abs(DA - actuatorPositions)

    // Calculate activation level based on distance (higher activation for closer actuators)
    activationLevels = [intensity * (1 - (d / 45)) for d in distances] // Dampen intensity based on distance

    // Clamp activation levels to 0-100%
    activationLevels = clamp(activationLevels, 0, 100)

    return activationLevels
