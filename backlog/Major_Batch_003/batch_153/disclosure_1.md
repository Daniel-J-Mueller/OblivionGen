## Adaptive Metaverse Sensory Substitution

**Concept:** Extend prioritization beyond network traffic to *sensory data streams* within the metaverse experience itself, adaptively substituting lower-priority sensory input with AI-generated approximations to maintain a baseline experience during network congestion or device limitations.

**Specification:**

**1. Sensory Data Classification & Prioritization:**

*   **Module:** Sensory Stream Analyzer (SSA)
*   **Function:**  SSA monitors all incoming sensory data streams (visual, auditory, haptic, olfactory, gustatory - even if simulated) for a metaverse client.
*   **Prioritization Schema:** A configurable hierarchy assigns priority levels to sensory data types. Example:
    *   Critical: Spatial audio cues indicating immediate threats. Visual data defining navigable pathways.
    *   High: Facial expressions of other avatars, ambient environmental sounds.
    *   Medium: Detailed textures on non-interactive objects, background music.
    *   Low: Subtle haptic feedback on clothing, complex environmental scents.
*   **Metadata Tagging:**  All sensory data packets are tagged with priority level and associated ‘fidelity score’ (a measure of data complexity/detail).

**2. Dynamic Fidelity Adjustment:**

*   **Module:** Fidelity Manager (FM)
*   **Input:** Network bandwidth availability (from existing patent system), device processing capacity, sensory stream priorities (from SSA), and a user-defined ‘experience baseline’ (minimum acceptable fidelity).
*   **Function:**  FM dynamically adjusts the fidelity of sensory streams based on available resources. This is *not* simple downscaling.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Calculate ‘Resource Deficit’:  Available Resources – Required Resources (based on all streams at baseline fidelity).
    2.  Iterate through streams, starting with lowest priority:
        *   If Resource Deficit > 0: Stream maintains baseline fidelity.
        *   If Resource Deficit <= 0:
            *   Identify AI ‘Approximation Model’ associated with stream type (e.g., texture simplification model, procedural audio generation).
            *   Apply Approximation Model to reduce data complexity/bandwidth usage until Resource Deficit > 0 OR stream reaches ‘minimum acceptable fidelity’ threshold.

**3.  AI Approximation Models:**

*   **Examples:**
    *   **Visual:** Neural style transfer to simplify textures, object detection to render only essential elements, procedural generation of distant scenery.
    *   **Auditory:** Spatial audio reverb to mask bandwidth limitations, procedural music generation to fill gaps in lost audio, AI voice cloning to synthesize missing dialogue.
    *   **Haptic:** Reduced frequency range of haptic feedback, algorithmic approximation of complex textures.

**4. Client-Side Implementation:**

*   Metaverse client incorporates FM and AI Approximation Model library.
*   Communication with existing network optimization system to receive bandwidth/resource availability data.
*   Seamless switching between original and approximated sensory data streams.

**Pseudocode (FM Core):**

```
function adjustFidelity(bandwidth, processingPower, sensoryStreams):
  resourceDeficit = bandwidth + processingPower
  for each stream in sensoryStreams:
    requiredResources = stream.fidelity * stream.dataSize
    if resourceDeficit >= requiredResources:
      resourceDeficit -= requiredResources
    else:
      approximationModel = stream.approximationModel
      stream.fidelity = min(stream.fidelity, (resourceDeficit / stream.dataSize))
      stream.applyApproximation(approximationModel)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   User-configurable ‘experience baseline’ allows users to prioritize specific sensory modalities (e.g., prioritize visual fidelity over haptic feedback).
*   AI model training and optimization to minimize perceptual differences between original and approximated sensory data.
*   Integration with existing metaverse rendering and audio engines.
