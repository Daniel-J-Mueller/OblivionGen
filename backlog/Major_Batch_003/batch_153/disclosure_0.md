## Dynamic Complexity Scaling for Interframe Prediction

**Specification:** A system for dynamically adjusting the complexity of interframe prediction based on real-time video content analysis and encoding resource availability.

**Concept:** The provided patent focuses on *reducing* the candidate modes for interframe prediction. This is good, but assumes a static reduction strategy. What if the *amount* of reduction itself changed based on the video?  Highly dynamic scenes benefit from faster, less complex searches (even if suboptimal), while static scenes can tolerate exhaustive, high-complexity searches for optimal prediction.

**System Components:**

1.  **Scene Dynamics Analyzer:**  A module that analyzes incoming video frames to estimate scene change rate and complexity. Metrics include:
    *   Optical Flow Magnitude: Average pixel displacement between frames. Higher values indicate higher motion.
    *   Histogram Difference: Quantifies the change in color distribution between frames.
    *   Object Count/Tracking: (Optional, requiring object detection) Tracks the number and movement of objects in the scene.
2.  **Resource Monitor:**  Tracks available encoding resources (CPU/GPU utilization, memory, encoding time).
3.  **Complexity Scaling Controller:**  Based on the outputs of the Scene Dynamics Analyzer and Resource Monitor, dynamically adjusts the parameters for interframe candidate mode pruning. These parameters include:
    *   `MaxPruningLevel`: A value between 0 (no pruning) and 100 (aggressive pruning). Higher values reduce the search space more drastically.
    *   `DRLCombinationLimit`: The maximum number of combinations of Dynamic Reference Lists (DRLs) to evaluate.
    *   `InterframeModeOrderBias`:  Adjusts the ordering of interframe mode types in the pruning process, prioritizing faster modes during high-motion scenes.
4.  **Adaptive Prediction Engine:** The core encoding engine, modified to accept and apply the dynamically adjusted pruning parameters.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Inside the Encoding Loop (per frame/block)

// 1. Analyze Scene Dynamics
scene_dynamics = SceneDynamicsAnalyzer(current_frame)
motion_level = scene_dynamics.optical_flow_magnitude
histogram_change = scene_dynamics.histogram_difference

// 2. Monitor Resources
resource_usage = ResourceMonitor()
available_cpu = resource_usage.cpu_utilization
available_memory = resource_usage.memory_utilization

// 3. Calculate Pruning Parameters
max_pruning_level = base_pruning_level // Start with a default
if motion_level > high_motion_threshold:
  max_pruning_level = min(max_pruning_level + aggressive_pruning_boost, 100)
if available_cpu < low_cpu_threshold:
  max_pruning_level = min(max_pruning_level + resource_boost, 100)

drl_combination_limit = base_drl_limit
if max_pruning_level > medium_pruning_threshold:
    drl_combination_limit = base_drl_limit * 0.5 //Reduce DRL combos with heavy pruning

interframe_mode_order_bias = default_bias
if motion_level > high_motion_threshold:
   interframe_mode_order_bias = prioritize_faster_modes //Shift order for faster modes

// 4. Apply Parameters to Pruning
candidate_modes = PruneInterframeModes(
    original_candidate_modes,
    max_pruning_level=max_pruning_level,
    drl_combination_limit=drl_combination_limit,
    interframe_mode_order_bias = interframe_mode_order_bias
)
```

**Innovation:**  This isn't simply *reducing* candidate modes; it's dynamically *scaling* the complexity of the search based on the video content and available resources. This allows for a more intelligent trade-off between encoding speed and compression efficiency. It moves beyond static pruning, enabling a more adaptive encoding strategy.
