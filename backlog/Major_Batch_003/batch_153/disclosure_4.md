**Dynamic Scene Graph Augmentation with Predictive Interaction Modeling**

**Concept:** Expand the multimodal dialog state to not just *track* objects and their attributes, but to *predict* likely user interactions with those objects based on learned behavioral patterns and contextual cues. This moves beyond passive state tracking to proactive assistance.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Interaction Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Multimodal dialog state (current object attributes, relationships), visual data (scene context), user history (past interactions, preferences).
    *   Process: Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) – trained on a large dataset of human-object interactions. The RNN predicts the probability of various actions (e.g., “move,” “examine,” “compare,” “ask about”) concerning each object in the scene.
    *   Output: A probability distribution over possible user actions for each object.

2.  **Augmented Scene Graph:**
    *   Core: Existing scene graph structure (objects, attributes, relationships).
    *   Augmentation: Add “interaction likelihood” edges to the graph, connecting each object to its predicted action probabilities. This effectively creates a weighted graph representing potential user engagement.

3.  **Proactive Assistance Engine:**
    *   Trigger: When the interaction likelihood of an object exceeds a defined threshold.
    *   Action: Initiate a proactive assistance response:
        *   **Visual Highlighting:** Visually emphasize the object in the user's field of view (e.g., subtle glow, outline).
        *   **Contextual Information:** Present relevant information about the object (e.g., its purpose, features, related options) *before* the user explicitly requests it.
        *   **Suggested Actions:** Display a small set of suggested actions (e.g., “Ask about price,” “Show me similar items,” “Add to cart”).

4.  **User Feedback Loop:**
    *   Mechanism: Monitor user behavior (gaze, gestures, voice commands) to assess the accuracy of interaction predictions.
    *   Update: Use this feedback to retrain the RNN, refining its predictive capabilities over time.  Employ reinforcement learning where positive interactions (user acting on predicted action) reinforce the prediction network, and negative interactions penalize it.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize RNN with pre-trained weights
rnn = load_pretrained_rnn()

// Main Loop
while (user is interacting):

  // Get current multimodal dialog state
  dialog_state = get_dialog_state()

  // Access visual data from sensors
  visual_data = get_visual_data()

  // Predict interaction probabilities for each object
  interaction_probabilities = rnn.predict(dialog_state, visual_data)

  // Update augmented scene graph with interaction probabilities
  augmented_graph = update_scene_graph(scene_graph, interaction_probabilities)

  // Identify objects with high interaction likelihood
  high_likelihood_objects = find_high_likelihood_objects(augmented_graph, threshold)

  // For each high-likelihood object:
  for (object in high_likelihood_objects):
    // Trigger proactive assistance (visual highlighting, contextual information, suggested actions)
    trigger_assistance(object)

    // Observe user response (gaze, gesture, voice)
    user_response = observe_user_response()

    // Update RNN with feedback (reinforcement learning)
    update_rnn(user_response)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge computing device with sufficient processing power for real-time RNN inference.
*   High-resolution cameras for accurate visual data acquisition.
*   Gaze/gesture tracking sensors.
*   Wireless communication module for data transfer.
