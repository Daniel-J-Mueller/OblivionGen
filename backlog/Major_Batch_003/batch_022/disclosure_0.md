## Adaptive Sensor Masking with Dynamic Privacy Zones

**Concept:** Extend the privacy indicator functionality to not merely *disable* sensors, but to dynamically *mask* sensor data based on user-defined zones and activity. Imagine a device understanding *where* you are and *what* you’re doing, and selectively allowing/blocking sensor data accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based directional microphone array (4-8 microphones).
    *   Miniature Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor for coarse room mapping and activity recognition.
    *   Existing camera/microphone hardware (from the base device).
    *   Dedicated co-processor (low-power ARM Cortex-M series) for real-time audio/visual processing.
    *   Haptic feedback module for zone selection/confirmation.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Zone Definition Module:** User interface allowing creation of privacy zones via direct input (drawing on screen) or voice command ("Create privacy zone around my desk"). Zones are stored as polygonal regions in device memory.
    *   **Activity Recognition Engine:** Uses ToF and audio analysis to identify user activities (e.g., "typing", "speaking on the phone", "watching a video", "in a meeting").
    *   **Sensor Masking Rules Engine:** Combines zone definitions and activity recognition to create dynamic masking rules.  Rules are prioritized:
        *   **Absolute Mask:** Sensors are completely disabled within a zone, regardless of activity.
        *   **Conditional Mask:** Sensors are disabled *only* during specific activities within a zone. (e.g., “Disable microphone during ‘typing’ activity in ‘office’ zone.”).
        *   **Data Obfuscation:** Instead of complete blocking, sensor data is modified (e.g., audio is garbled, image is blurred) to protect privacy while still allowing some functionality.
    *   **Privacy Indicator Enhancement:**  The existing physical privacy indicator (LED) is augmented with visual feedback showing *which* sensors are currently masked, and *why* (zone/activity).
    *   **Learning Algorithm:** The system learns user preferences over time, automatically suggesting or creating new masking rules based on observed behavior. (e.g. “You frequently disable the microphone when in video conferences in the ‘living room’ zone.  Should I automate this?”).

**Pseudocode (Rule Engine):**

```
FUNCTION ApplyMaskingRules(sensorData, currentZone, currentActivity)

  // Retrieve all masking rules applicable to the current zone
  rules = GetRulesForZone(currentZone)

  FOR EACH rule IN rules

    IF rule.activity == "ANY" OR rule.activity == currentActivity

      IF rule.sensor == sensorData.sensorType

        IF rule.action == "DISABLE"
          RETURN NULL //Discards sensor data
        ELSE IF rule.action == "OBLUR"
          sensorData = ObfuscateData(sensorData, rule.obfuscationLevel)
        ELSE IF rule.action == "REPLACE"
          sensorData = ReplaceData(sensorData, rule.replacementData)
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  RETURN sensorData
END FUNCTION

```

**User Interaction Flow:**

1.  User defines privacy zones via on-screen drawing or voice commands.
2.  System automatically detects common activities (e.g., typing, talking, watching video).
3.  User can customize masking rules for each zone and activity.
4.  Physical privacy indicator shows overall privacy status, with additional visual cues indicating which sensors are masked.
5.  System learns user preferences and suggests automated rules.
