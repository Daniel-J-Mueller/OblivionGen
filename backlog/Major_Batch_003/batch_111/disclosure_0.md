## Adaptive Permission Granularity & Contextual Authorization

**System Overview:**

A system extending the core concept of delegated authorization, but dynamically adjusting permission scope based on real-time context *and* predicted user intent. Instead of static “allow/deny” permissions, this system operates on probabilistic authorization scores.

**Components:**

1.  **Contextual Sensor Suite (CSS):** Integrated into both host and guest applications. Collects data points including:
    *   **Location:** Precise geolocation.
    *   **Time:** Current time, day of week, known user schedules.
    *   **Activity:** User device activity (motion, app usage, network connectivity).
    *   **Environmental Data:** Microphone/camera input processed for scene understanding (e.g., "in a meeting," "driving"). *Privacy considerations are paramount; data is processed locally where possible, and anonymized/aggregated where transmission is necessary.*
    *   **User Biometrics:** (Optional, with explicit consent) Heart rate, facial expressions analyzed for stress/engagement levels.
2.  **Intent Prediction Engine (IPE):** A machine learning model trained on user behavior and contextual data. Predicts the *likely* action a user intends to perform within the guest application.  Outputs a probability score for various actions.
3.  **Dynamic Authorization Manager (DAM):**  The core component.
    *   Receives context data from CSS and intent predictions from IPE.
    *   Maintains a 'Permission Graph' - a network of permissions linked to contextual factors and intent scores.
    *   Calculates a real-time 'Authorization Score' for each requested action. This score is *not* binary but a continuous value between 0 and 1.
    *   Defines ‘Risk Thresholds’ – levels above which the authorization is automatically denied, or requires additional verification (e.g., biometric scan, multi-factor authentication).
4.  **Host Application Integration:** The host app acts as a mediator, receiving authorization requests from the guest app, forwarding them to DAM, and displaying appropriate prompts to the user.
5.  **Guest Application Integration:** The guest app initiates authorization requests with relevant context.

**Workflow:**

1.  Guest App attempts an action.
2.  Guest App sends request and contextual data to Host App.
3.  Host App forwards request to DAM.
4.  DAM gathers additional contextual data from CSS.
5.  IPE predicts user intent.
6.  DAM evaluates Permission Graph, calculates Authorization Score.
7.  If Authorization Score is below the Risk Threshold, DAM denies the request.
8.  If Score is above threshold:
    *   DAM communicates authorization to Host App.
    *   Host App displays a granular consent prompt: "Allow [Guest App] to [Specific Action] because it appears you are [Contextual Situation]?" (e.g. “Allow Maps to share your location because it appears you are navigating?”)
    *   User confirms/denies.
9.  Token is generated and passed to Guest App.

**Pseudocode (DAM - Calculate Authorization Score):**

```
function calculateAuthorizationScore(request, context, intentScore):
  baseScore = getBasePermissionScore(request.action, request.guestApp) // Static score from Permission Graph
  contextModifier = 0
  for each contextFactor in context:
    contextModifier += getContextWeight(contextFactor) * contextFactor.value

  intentModifier = intentScore * getIntentWeight(request.action)

  authorizationScore = baseScore + contextModifier + intentModifier

  // Ensure score remains within 0-1 range
  authorizationScore = clamp(authorizationScore, 0, 1)

  return authorizationScore
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Hyper-personalized security:** Tailoring access controls based on user behavior and context.
*   **Proactive fraud prevention:** Identifying and blocking suspicious activity in real-time.
*   **Smart home automation:**  Granting access to devices based on user location and activity.
*   **Context-aware advertising:**  Delivering relevant ads based on user context and predicted intent.
