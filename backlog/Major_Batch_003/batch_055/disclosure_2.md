## Dynamic Conversation 'Mood' Bots

**Concept:** Extend the bot suggestion system to dynamically create and suggest bots tailored to the *emotional* tone of a conversation, not just the explicit intent. This shifts from functional assistance to emotional support/enhancement within the messaging experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sentiment Analysis Module:** Real-time sentiment analysis of incoming messages. This goes beyond simple positive/negative; it should detect nuances like sarcasm, frustration, excitement, etc. Output: a vector representing the emotional ‘mood’ of the conversation.
2.  **'Mood Bot' Catalog:** A catalog of bots designed to respond to specific emotional states. Examples:
    *   **‘CalmBot’:** Activated by high frustration/anger. Offers breathing exercises, gentle music suggestions, or links to calming resources.
    *   **‘EnthusiasmBot’:** Activated by excitement/joy. Suggests celebratory stickers, GIFs, or initiating a group activity.
    *   **‘EmpathyBot’:** Activated by sadness/disappointment. Offers supportive messages, shares uplifting content, or suggests a private check-in with a friend.
    *   **‘HumorBot’:** Activated by neutral/slightly down moods. Provides lighthearted jokes or funny content relevant to the conversation.
3.  **Dynamic Bot Creation:** A system for *generating* new 'Mood Bots' based on conversation data. This employs a generative AI model trained on empathetic language and relevant content. Parameters: 
    *   Conversation History (last N messages)
    *   Current Sentiment Vector
    *   User Preferences (e.g., preferred humor style, music genre)
4.  **Suggestion Algorithm:**
    *   Calculate conversation sentiment vector.
    *   Query 'Mood Bot' catalog for bots with matching sentiment profiles.
    *   If no close match is found, trigger dynamic bot creation.
    *   Display the suggested bot as an interactable mini-app with a clear description of its function (e.g., "Feeling stressed? Let CalmBot help you relax.").
5. **User Customization:** Allow users to customize the behavior of 'Mood Bots' (e.g., set preferred calming techniques for CalmBot, filter content for HumorBot).
6. **Privacy Considerations:** Ensure all sentiment analysis and bot creation processes are conducted with strict user privacy controls. Option to opt-out of sentiment analysis altogether.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION AnalyzeConversation(conversationHistory):
    sentimentVector = SentimentAnalysisModule(conversationHistory)
    RETURN sentimentVector

FUNCTION FindMatchingBot(sentimentVector, moodBotCatalog):
    closestBot = NULL
    minDistance = INFINITY

    FOR EACH bot IN moodBotCatalog:
        distance = CalculateDistance(sentimentVector, bot.sentimentProfile)
        IF distance < minDistance:
            minDistance = distance
            closestBot = bot

    RETURN closestBot

FUNCTION CreateDynamicBot(conversationHistory, sentimentVector, userPreferences):
    # Utilize generative AI model to create new bot based on inputs
    dynamicBot = GenerativeAIModel(conversationHistory, sentimentVector, userPreferences)
    RETURN dynamicBot

ON MESSAGE RECEIVED:
    conversationHistory.append(message)
    sentimentVector = AnalyzeConversation(conversationHistory)

    closestBot = FindMatchingBot(sentimentVector, moodBotCatalog)

    IF closestBot == NULL:
        dynamicBot = CreateDynamicBot(conversationHistory, sentimentVector, userPreferences)
        closestBot = dynamicBot

    DisplayBotSuggestion(closestBot)
