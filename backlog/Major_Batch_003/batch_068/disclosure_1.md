## Adaptive Block Shape Prediction via Learned Transforms

**Specification:** A system for accelerating and improving motion estimation by dynamically adapting block shapes based on learned transforms of residual data. This builds upon the concept of multi-block-size motion estimation, but moves beyond fixed or pre-defined shapes.

**Core Idea:** Instead of searching for the best motion vector within pre-defined block sizes (4x4, 8x8, 16x16, etc.), the system *learns* optimal block shapes for each frame or region of a frame. This is achieved by applying a series of learned transforms to the residual data (the difference between predicted and actual frames) and using the transformed data to define variable-shaped blocks for motion estimation.

**Components:**

1.  **Residual Data Input:** Takes the residual data from the video encoder.
2.  **Learned Transform Network (LTN):** A convolutional neural network (CNN) trained to analyze the residual data and output a 'shape map'.
    *   **Input:** Residual data patch (e.g., 32x32).
    *   **Architecture:** Multiple convolutional layers, ReLU activations, and a final convolutional layer with a sigmoid activation to output a 2D map of shape coefficients.  These coefficients represent the degree to which the block shape should deviate from a standard rectangular form.
    *   **Output:** A 2D map (same size as the input patch) where each value represents a 'deformation' factor. Values close to 0 indicate a standard rectangular block, while larger values indicate greater deformation.
3.  **Block Shape Generator (BSG):**  Generates block shapes based on the shape map and a base block shape (e.g., 16x16).
    *   **Input:** Shape map, base block shape.
    *   **Process:** The shape map is used to displace the vertices of the base block shape, creating irregular polygon blocks. The degree of displacement is determined by the value in the shape map.
    *   **Output:** Irregular polygon representing the block shape.
4.  **Motion Estimation Engine:** Performs motion estimation using the generated block shapes.  It adapts standard motion estimation algorithms (e.g., block matching) to work with irregular polygons.
5.  **Adaptive Quantization:**  Quantization is adapted based on the block shape. Smaller, more complex blocks receive finer quantization to preserve details.

**Pseudocode (BSG):**

```
function generateBlockShape(shapeMap, baseShape):
  blockVertices = baseShape.vertices  // Get vertices of the base shape

  for each vertex in blockVertices:
    deformation = shapeMap[vertex.x, vertex.y]  // Get deformation factor

    // Calculate displacement vector based on deformation
    displacementX = deformation * cos(vertex.angle)
    displacementY = deformation * sin(vertex.angle)

    // Apply displacement to vertex coordinates
    vertex.x += displacementX
    vertex.y += displacementY

  return polygon defined by updated vertices
```

**Training Data:**  Large datasets of video frames with corresponding ground truth motion vectors and optimal block shapes (generated via computationally expensive exhaustive search).

**Benefits:**

*   **Increased Compression Efficiency:**  By adapting block shapes to better match the underlying content, the system can reduce residual errors and improve compression efficiency.
*   **Reduced Computational Complexity:** While training the LTN is computationally expensive, the resulting network allows for faster motion estimation during encoding and decoding.  The system can focus motion estimation searches on more relevant regions of the frame.
*   **Improved Visual Quality:** More accurate motion estimation leads to fewer artifacts and improved visual quality.
*   **Enhanced Robustness:** The system is more robust to complex motion and scene changes.
