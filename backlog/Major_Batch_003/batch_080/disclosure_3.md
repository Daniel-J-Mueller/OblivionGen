**Dynamic Temporal Feature Blending for Predictive Modeling**

**Concept:** Extend the additive decomposition model to dynamically blend features from different temporal windows *beyond* just the short and long-term conversion windows. This allows the system to capture nuanced temporal relationships between user interactions and conversions, and adapt to changing user behavior over time.

**Specs:**

1.  **Feature Bank:** Maintain a "feature bank" containing features derived from interactions within multiple, overlapping temporal windows (e.g., 1 hour, 6 hours, 1 day, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days). These features could include click-through rates, dwell time, content category preferences, purchase history, and demographic information.
2.  **Attention Mechanism:** Implement an attention mechanism that learns to weight the importance of each temporal window's features when predicting conversion probability. The attention weights would be dynamically adjusted based on the user's recent behavior, content characteristics, and overall market trends.
3.  **Gating Network:** Introduce a "gating network" that determines which features from each temporal window are relevant for the current prediction. This allows the model to ignore noisy or irrelevant data and focus on the most informative signals.
4.  **Temporal Decay Function:** Incorporate a temporal decay function that reduces the weight of features from older temporal windows. This helps to prioritize recent behavior and adapt to changing user preferences.  The decay rate would be a learnable parameter.
5.  **Model Architecture:** Modify the existing additive decomposition model to incorporate the dynamically blended features. The model would consist of:
    *   **Feature Embedding Layer:** Embeds each feature from the feature bank into a dense vector representation.
    *   **Attention Layer:** Applies the attention mechanism to weight the importance of each temporal window.
    *   **Gating Layer:** Selects relevant features based on the gating network's output.
    *   **Fusion Layer:** Combines the weighted and gated features into a single feature vector.
    *   **Prediction Layer:**  Predicts the conversion probability based on the fused feature vector.
6.  **Training Data:**  Augment the existing training data with more granular temporal information.  This could include timestamps of all user interactions, as well as data on seasonal trends and external events.
7.  **Pseudocode:**

```
function predict_conversion_probability(user_id, content_id):
    // Fetch features from feature bank for multiple temporal windows
    features = fetch_features(user_id, content_id, temporal_windows)

    // Embed features
    embedded_features = embed_features(features)

    // Calculate attention weights
    attention_weights = attention_layer(embedded_features)

    // Apply attention weights
    weighted_features = apply_attention(embedded_features, attention_weights)

    // Calculate gating signals
    gating_signals = gating_layer(weighted_features)

    // Apply gating signals
    gated_features = apply_gating(weighted_features, gating_signals)

    // Fuse features
    fused_features = fuse_features(gated_features)

    // Predict conversion probability
    conversion_probability = prediction_layer(fused_features)

    return conversion_probability
```
8.  **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluate the performance of the new model using metrics such as AUC, precision, recall, and F1-score. Compare the results to the baseline model to assess the improvement in prediction accuracy.
