## Dynamic Content Stitching & Generative Storytelling

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply adding data *to* content. Use the image analysis and entity association as a launchpad for *generating* related content, effectively creating micro-narratives or 'content stitches' around the user-submitted image.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Module: Narrative Engine**

*   **Input:** 
    *   Image (from user submission).
    *   Entity associated with image (determined by existing model).
    *   Item detected within image (determined by existing model).
    *   Quality Score (from existing model).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Concept Seed Extraction:** Based on the identified entity, item, and a semantic analysis of surrounding text (if any accompanies the image), extract 3-5 "concept seeds" representing core ideas or themes. (e.g., Entity = “Hiking Boots”, Item = “Mountain Peak”, Concept Seeds = “Adventure”, “Exploration”, “Resilience”).
    2.  **Generative Prompt Construction:** Formulate a prompt for a Large Language Model (LLM) combining:
        *   A base prompt: “Write a short, evocative paragraph connecting [concept seed 1], [concept seed 2], and the image of [item] within the context of [entity].”
        *   Image Captioning: Utilize an image captioning model to provide a brief textual description of the image. Inject this into the LLM prompt as context.
        *   Quality Weighting: Incorporate the quality score into the prompt's 'creativity' parameter. Higher quality = more creative/complex generation. Lower quality = simpler/factual generation.
    3.  **LLM Generation:** Execute the prompt against the LLM to generate a 2-4 sentence “content stitch.”
    4.  **Fact Verification:** Implement a fact verification module. The LLM output is checked against a curated knowledge base related to the entity.  Flag/revise any inaccurate or misleading statements.
*   **Output:** A generated "content stitch" – a short, contextually relevant paragraph.

**2. Content Integration & Display**

*   **User Interface:**
    *   Below the user-submitted image, display the generated content stitch in a visually distinct section ("Story Snippet", "Contextual Insight", etc.).
    *   Include a clear attribution: “Generated by AI based on this image and [Entity] data.”
*   **Data Association:**
    *   Link key entities/concepts within the generated text to relevant pages/products on the online system.
    *   Track user engagement (clicks, shares) with the generated content as a metric for AI performance.

**3. System Architecture & Components**

*   **LLM Integration:** API access to a capable LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, Google PaLM 2).
*   **Image Captioning Model:** Pre-trained model for generating image descriptions.
*   **Knowledge Base:** Curated database of factual information related to entities.
*   **Fact Verification Module:** API access to a fact-checking service or rule-based system.
*   **API Endpoints:** Expose endpoints for triggering content generation and receiving results.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateContentStitch(image, entity, item, qualityScore) {
  conceptSeeds = extractConceptSeeds(entity, item);
  imageCaption = generateImageCaption(image);
  prompt = constructPrompt(conceptSeeds, imageCaption, entity, qualityScore);
  generatedText = callLLM(prompt);
  verifiedText = verifyFacts(generatedText, entity);
  return verifiedText;
}
```

This expands the system's capabilities beyond passive data addition, turning user content into dynamic storytelling opportunities. This provides added user engagement while simultaneously enriching the platform’s knowledge base and content ecosystem. It is a step toward a more intelligent and adaptive online experience.
