## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction via Temporal Graph Fusion

**Concept:** Augment the existing multimodal state tracking with a continuously updating 3D reconstruction of the scene, fusing information across multiple camera views and temporal frames. This allows for reasoning about object relationships *in space* rather than solely relying on attribute/relationship tagging within a 2D image context.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Requires a client system with at least two cameras capable of synchronized video capture. Depth sensors (e.g., LiDAR, structured light) are optional but significantly improve reconstruction quality.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Visual Data Acquisition:* Module responsible for capturing and synchronizing video streams from multiple cameras.
    *   *Feature Extraction & Matching:* Extracts keypoints and descriptors (e.g., SIFT, ORB, SuperPoint) from each camera frame. Matches corresponding features across frames and cameras.
    *   *Incremental Reconstruction Engine:*  Implements a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) or Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm.  Utilizes feature matches to create a sparse or dense 3D point cloud of the environment.  Must support incremental updatesâ€”adding new frames without restarting the entire reconstruction process.  We could utilize Open3D or COLMAP as a base.
    *   *Temporal Graph Fusion:* This is the core innovation. The reconstruction engine outputs a dynamic scene graph, where nodes represent objects (identified via the existing multimodal dialog state) or significant scene features (e.g., corners, planes). Edges represent spatial relationships (distance, relative position, occlusion).  Critically, this graph is *temporal* - it maintains a history of these relationships over time.  Graph nodes are tagged with confidence scores reflecting the quality of the reconstruction and object identification.
    *   *Multimodal State Integration:*  The existing multimodal dialog state is integrated into the temporal graph. Object attributes and relationships (extracted from user requests and visual analysis) are added as node properties.  The graph serves as an enriched representation of the scene, extending beyond 2D image features.
    *   *Reasoning & Prediction Engine:* Utilizes the temporal graph to reason about object interactions and predict future states. For example, if a user asks "Where is the red cup?", the system can not only locate the cup in the current frame but also estimate its trajectory if it's being moved.

**Pseudocode - Temporal Graph Update:**

```
function updateTemporalGraph(newFrame, objectDetections, userRequest):
  // 1. Extract features from newFrame
  features = extractFeatures(newFrame)

  // 2. Match features to existing 3D map
  matches = matchFeatures(features, existing3DMap)

  // 3. Update 3D map based on matches
  updated3DMap = updateMap(existing3DMap, matches)

  // 4. Identify objects in newFrame
  detectedObjects = identifyObjects(newFrame, objectDetections)

  // 5. Create/update object nodes in temporal graph
  for each object in detectedObjects:
    if object not in temporalGraph:
      createNode(temporalGraph, object, object.position, object.attributes)
    else:
      updateNode(temporalGraph, object, object.position)

  // 6.  Infer spatial relationships between objects
  relationships = inferRelationships(temporalGraph)

  // 7. Update edge weights in temporal graph based on relationships and time.
  updateEdges(temporalGraph, relationships)

  // 8. Incorporate user request into temporal graph.
  if userRequest:
    updateGraphWithRequest(temporalGraph, userRequest)

  return temporalGraph
```

**Innovation Focus:** The combination of continuous 3D scene reconstruction with a temporal graph structure allows for a richer and more dynamic understanding of the environment. This goes beyond simple object recognition and attribute tagging, enabling the system to reason about object interactions, predict future states, and provide more contextually relevant responses to user requests.  This creates a system capable of learning a world-model of its surroundings.
