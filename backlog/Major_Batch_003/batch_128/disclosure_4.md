## Adaptive Dependency Granularity

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on a static dependency model defined during compilation. This design explores dynamically adjusting the granularity of dependencies *during runtime* based on observed performance and resource utilization. This allows for finer-grained parallelism where available, and coarser-grained synchronization where contention is high.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Each computation-control unit (CCU) gains a “Dependency Manager” module alongside its programmable dependency matrix. This module has a small, dedicated memory region ("Dependency Profile") to store runtime dependency settings.
*   **Software (Compiler):** The compiler generates dependency instructions with a *range* of granularity settings for each dependency. This range defines the minimum and maximum number of operations that must complete before signaling the dependent CCU.  Example: A dependency instruction might specify a granularity range of [1, 4] – meaning the dependent CCU can be signaled after 1, 2, 3, or 4 operations of the source CCU complete. The compiler also includes a "Dependency Profiler" to monitor runtime performance.
*   **Runtime System:** A central “Dependency Coordinator” monitors CCU performance (latency, throughput, resource usage). It interacts with the Dependency Profiler and Dependency Coordinator to dynamically adjust dependency granularity.
*   **Dependency Granularity Adjustment Algorithm:**

    1.  **Monitoring:** The Dependency Coordinator continuously monitors CCU performance metrics.
    2.  **Contention Detection:** If a CCU experiences high contention (e.g., frequent stalls waiting for dependencies), the Dependency Coordinator *increases* the granularity of dependencies pointing to that CCU. This reduces the frequency of signaling and the potential for contention.
    3.  **Underutilization Detection:** If a CCU is consistently underutilized, the Dependency Coordinator *decreases* the granularity of dependencies pointing to that CCU. This increases the frequency of signaling and allows for more fine-grained parallelism.
    4.  **Granularity Adjustment:**  The Dependency Coordinator signals the Dependency Managers in the relevant CCUs to adjust their dependency matrix based on the new granularity setting.  The Dependency Manager updates its programmable dependency matrix.
    5.  **Adaptive Range:** The Dependency Coordinator uses a PID controller to regulate the granularity settings.  The PID controller uses performance metrics (latency, throughput) as feedback signals.

*   **Synchronization Token Enhancement:** Synchronization tokens include a “Granularity Level” field.  This field indicates the number of operations completed before the token was generated, and it's used by the receiving CCU to update its dependency matrix.

**Pseudocode (Dependency Coordinator):**

```
// Every time step:
For Each CCU:
    PerformanceMetrics = MonitorCCUPerformance(CCU)
    ContentionLevel = CalculateContentionLevel(PerformanceMetrics)
    UnderutilizationLevel = CalculateUnderutilizationLevel(PerformanceMetrics)

    TargetGranularity = CalculateTargetGranularity(ContentionLevel, UnderutilizationLevel)
    CurrentGranularity = GetCurrentGranularity(CCU)

    If TargetGranularity != CurrentGranularity:
        AdjustGranularity(CCU, TargetGranularity)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased overall performance by dynamically optimizing for parallelism and minimizing contention.
*   Improved resource utilization by adapting to changing workloads.
*   Robustness to variations in hardware and software.
