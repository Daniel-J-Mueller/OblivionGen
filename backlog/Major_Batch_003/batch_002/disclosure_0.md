## Dynamic Event 'Echoes' & Predictive Social Mapping

**Concept:** Extend event suggestion beyond immediate attendance to model ‘social echoes’ – the propagation of event information and sentiment through a user's network – and proactively map potential social connections *at* events before they happen.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Modeling:**

1.  **Event Echo Data:**  Track not only event attendance, but also:
    *   **Shares/Mentions:** Count event shares, tags, and direct mentions within the social network.
    *   **Comment Sentiment:** Analyze sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) in comments relating to the event.
    *   **Network Propagation:** Map *who* shared with *whom* – building a network graph of event information flow.  Assign a ‘propagation score’ to each user based on their network reach and influence regarding the event.
2.  **User 'Social Resonance' Profile:**  For each user, build a profile reflecting:
    *   **Echo Amplifier/Dampener:**  Determine if the user generally amplifies (high propagation score) or dampens (low propagation score) event information.
    *   **Sentiment Bias:** Identify the user's tendency to express positive or negative sentiment towards events in general, and specific event types.
    *   **Network Overlap:** Calculate the degree to which a user's network overlaps with the networks of event attendees.
3. **Event ‘Resonance Signature’:**  Combine echo data and attendee network data to generate an 'event resonance signature’ – a vector representing the event's potential for network propagation and emotional impact.

**II. Predictive Social Mapping:**

1.  **‘Potential Connection’ Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm that identifies users who are *not* currently connected but who have a high probability of forming a meaningful connection *at* an event. Criteria:
    *   **Shared Network Nodes:**  Users who share multiple common connections are prioritized.
    *   **Complementary Interests:** Leverage user profiles to identify complementary interests (e.g., user A is interested in photography, user B is a model).
    *   **Echo Propagation:** Users who have both propagated the event information to similar nodes.
2.  **Proactive ‘Icebreaker’ Suggestions:** Based on the predictive social mapping, proactively suggest ‘icebreaker’ topics or introductions to users attending the same event.  Examples:
    *   "User A and User B both follow [Common Interest].  Suggest introducing them."
    *   “User C shared this event with User D – they may have a connection.”
3. **Event ‘Social Density’ Visualization:**  Provide event organizers with a visualization of the event’s ‘social density’ – a map of potential connections among attendees. This can inform event layout and activities.

**III. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
FUNCTION SuggestEvents(targetUser)

    events = RETRIEVE_EVENTS()
    userProfile = GET_USER_PROFILE(targetUser)

    FOR event IN events
        candidateScore = 0

        //Base score (original patent's logic)
        candidateScore += CalculateBaseScore(userProfile, event)

        //Social Echo Component
        eventEchoData = GET_EVENT_ECHO_DATA(event)
        userSocialResonance = GET_USER_SOCIAL_RESONANCE(targetUser)
        candidateScore += CalculateEchoScore(eventEchoData, userSocialResonance)

        //Potential Connection Component
        potentialConnections = FIND_POTENTIAL_CONNECTIONS(event, targetUser)
        candidateScore += CalculateConnectionScore(potentialConnections)

        event.relevanceScore = candidateScore
    END FOR

    SORT events BY relevanceScore DESC
    RETURN TOP_N(events, 5)
END FUNCTION
```

**IV. Data Structures:**

*   `EventEchoData`:  {shares: INT, mentions: INT, positiveSentiment: FLOAT, negativeSentiment: FLOAT, propagationGraph: GRAPH}
*   `UserSocialResonance`: {echoAmplifier: BOOLEAN, sentimentBias: FLOAT, networkOverlap: FLOAT}
*   `PotentialConnection`: {user1: USER_ID, user2: USER_ID, sharedNodes: INT, complementaryInterests: BOOLEAN, echoOverlap: FLOAT}
