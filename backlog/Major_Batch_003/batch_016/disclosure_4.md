**Adaptive Inbox Prioritization via Biofeedback**

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biofeedback data (heart rate variability, skin conductance, brainwave activity via wearable sensors) to dynamically adjust inbox prioritization *beyond* simple activity/time metrics. The goal is to surface messages most relevant to the user's current cognitive/emotional state.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Integration:**
    *   API to accept data streams from compatible wearable sensors (e.g., smartwatches, EEG headsets).
    *   Data normalization and filtering to reduce noise and ensure data quality.
    *   User profile to store sensor calibration data (baseline values, sensitivity settings).

2.  **Cognitive/Emotional State Detection:**
    *   Machine learning models trained to correlate biofeedback data with cognitive states (focused, distracted, stressed, relaxed).
    *   Real-time state estimation based on incoming sensor data.
    *   Confidence levels assigned to state estimations.

3.  **Dynamic Prioritization Algorithm:**
    *   Inbox messages categorized based on content analysis (keywords, sender, topic).
    *   Priority scores assigned to messages based on:
        *   Content relevance to estimated cognitive/emotional state. (e.g., Urgent work emails prioritized when user is detected as 'focused', calming content prioritized when user is 'stressed').
        *   Sender relationship (frequent contacts boosted, unknown senders penalized).
        *   Traditional metrics (time received, unread status).
    *   Priority score weighting adjustable via user settings.

4.  **Inbox Interface Adaptation:**
    *   Messages displayed in order of calculated priority.
    *   Visual cues to indicate priority level (color-coding, icons).
    *   Option to filter inbox based on priority.
    *   “Focus Mode” to display only the highest priority messages, minimizing distractions.

5.  **Learning and Adaptation:**
    *   User feedback mechanism (e.g., marking messages as relevant/irrelevant) to refine the state estimation and prioritization algorithms.
    *   Continuous learning to improve accuracy over time.
    *   Personalized prioritization profiles based on individual user behavior and preferences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Receive biofeedback data
bioData = SensorAPI.getData()

// Estimate cognitive/emotional state
state = StateEstimationModel.predict(bioData)
confidence = StateEstimationModel.confidence(bioData)

// Get inbox messages
messages = InboxAPI.getMessages()

// Calculate priority score for each message
for each message in messages:
    relevanceScore = ContentAnalysis.calculateRelevance(message.content, state)
    senderScore = RelationshipManager.getSenderScore(message.sender)
    timeScore = TimeBasedScoring.calculateScore(message.timestamp)
    priorityScore = (relevanceScore * 0.5) + (senderScore * 0.3) + (timeScore * 0.2)

    message.priority = priorityScore

// Sort messages by priority
sortedMessages = sort(messages, key=lambda x: x.priority, reverse=True)

// Display sorted messages in inbox interface
InboxUI.displayMessages(sortedMessages)
```
