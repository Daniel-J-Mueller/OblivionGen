## Dynamic Taxonomy Weighting & Predictive Content Injection

**Concept:** Extend the existing taxonomy-driven web page generation by introducing a dynamic weighting system for taxonomy nodes *and* a predictive content injection mechanism. This shifts from a purely hierarchical content display to one that adapts based on user engagement and external data streams.

**Specifications:**

**1. Taxonomy Weighting Engine:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   *User Interaction Data:* Click-through rates on web pages associated with specific taxonomy nodes. Dwell time on pages. Explicit user ratings/feedback (likes, dislikes, relevance scores).
    *   *External Trend Data:* Real-time data feeds from news sources, social media (trending topics), industry reports, and search engine trends, mapped to taxonomy concepts via keyword analysis.
    *   *Concept Relationships:* An ontology linking taxonomy nodes to broader semantic concepts (e.g., leveraging knowledge graphs) to allow weight transfer across related but non-directly linked nodes.
*   **Weight Calculation:**
    *   A scoring algorithm (e.g., a weighted average) combines signals from user interaction, external trends, and concept relationships.
    *   Weights are updated periodically (e.g., hourly or daily) based on the incoming data.
    *   Nodes with high scores receive increased prominence in the web page layout (e.g., larger font sizes, higher placement, more visual emphasis).
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   A dedicated microservice (TaxonomyWeightingService) handles data ingestion, processing, and weight calculation.
    *   Weights are stored in a scalable database (e.g., Redis or Cassandra) for fast retrieval.

**2. Predictive Content Injection:**

*   **Content Prediction Model:**
    *   A machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a transformer model) trained on historical user behavior and content metadata.
    *   The model predicts which taxonomy nodes a user is *likely* to be interested in *before* they navigate to a specific page.
*   **Content Sourcing:**
    *   A content repository (e.g., a CMS or a data lake) stores various content assets (articles, videos, images, etc.) associated with taxonomy nodes.
    *   The system identifies relevant content based on the predicted taxonomy nodes.
*   **Injection Strategy:**
    *   *Dynamic Snippets:* Inject small, relevant content snippets (e.g., headlines, summaries, images) into web pages associated with parent taxonomy nodes.
    *   *Recommended Nodes:* Display a “Recommended Nodes” section on each page, showcasing predicted nodes with links to their respective pages.
    *   *Personalized Layout:* Adjust the layout of web pages to emphasize predicted nodes and relevant content, creating a personalized user experience.

**3. System Architecture:**

```
[User] --> [Web Application] --> [TaxonomyWeightingService]
                                      |
                                      --> [ContentPredictionModel] --> [ContentRepository]
```

**Pseudocode (Content Prediction Model):**

```
function predict_relevant_nodes(user_id, current_node_id):
  user_history = get_user_history(user_id)
  current_node_metadata = get_node_metadata(current_node_id)

  input_data = concatenate(user_history, current_node_metadata)
  predicted_probabilities = model.predict(input_data)

  sorted_nodes = sort_nodes_by_probability(predicted_probabilities)
  return top_n_nodes(sorted_nodes, 5) // Return the top 5 predicted nodes
```

**4. Additional Considerations:**

*   **A/B Testing:** Continuously A/B test different weighting algorithms, prediction models, and injection strategies to optimize performance.
*   **Explainability:** Provide users with insights into why certain content is being recommended, enhancing trust and transparency.
*   **Privacy:** Implement appropriate data privacy measures to protect user information.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to handle a large number of users and taxonomy nodes.
