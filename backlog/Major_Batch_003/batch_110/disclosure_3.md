**Dynamic Persona-Driven Messaging Prompts**

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Augment the existing activity score and messaging feature promotion system with dynamically generated messaging *prompts* tailored to inferred user personas, going beyond simply suggesting a feature. The system anticipates conversation starters based on shared interests *and* predicted communication styles.

**Components:**

1.  **Persona Inference Engine:**
    *   Input: User profile data (social networking system), messaging history, app usage patterns, declared interests.
    *   Process: Machine learning model (e.g., BERT, GPT-3 fine-tuned) infers personality traits (Big Five, MBTI-inspired), communication preferences (formal/informal, direct/indirect, emoji usage frequency, typical message length), and preferred topics. Output is a persona vector.
2.  **Prompt Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Persona vectors for both users in the pair, shared interests (determined via graph analysis of connected data – friends, groups, pages liked), recent events (from profile/calendar data), activity score.
    *   Process:  A generative AI model (fine-tuned on a large corpus of conversational text, categorized by personality traits) generates several candidate messaging prompts. Prompts are scored based on:
        *   Relevance to shared interests.
        *   Alignment with both users’ predicted communication styles.  (Example:  A formal persona would generate a prompt with complete sentences, whereas an informal persona might generate a playful question or meme suggestion.)
        *   A ‘novelty’ factor – avoids repeatedly suggesting the same prompts.
    *   Output: A ranked list of candidate prompts.
3.  **Messaging Feature Integration:**
    *   The top-ranked prompt is *presented as a suggested message* within the messaging interface.  *Alongside* the prompt, relevant messaging features (stickers, GIFs, polls, video call button) are highlighted based on the prompt’s content and the users' personas.  (Example: A prompt about a shared sports team might highlight a GIF search for team celebrations.)
4.  **Adaptive Learning Loop:**
    *   User interaction data (did they send the suggested message, modify it, ignore it?) is fed back into the Persona Inference Engine and Prompt Generation Module to refine predictions and improve prompt quality.

**Pseudocode (Prompt Generation):**

```
function generatePrompt(user1Persona, user2Persona, sharedInterests, activityScore):
  candidatePrompts = []
  for interest in sharedInterests:
    promptTemplate = getPromptTemplate(interest, user1Persona, user2Persona) // Select template based on personas
    prompt = fillTemplate(promptTemplate)
    promptScore = calculatePromptScore(prompt, user1Persona, user2Persona, activityScore)
    candidatePrompts.append((prompt, promptScore))

  candidatePrompts.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  return candidatePrompts[0][0]  // Return the highest-scoring prompt
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PersonaVector`:  Array of floats representing personality traits (e.g., [0.8, 0.2, 0.5, 0.7, 0.3] – Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism).
*   `PromptTemplate`:  String containing a prompt with placeholders for specific information (e.g., "Hey, did you see the game last night? What did you think of [Player Name]?").

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Emotional Tone Analysis:**  Detect the emotional tone of recent messages to generate prompts that are empathetic or supportive.
*   **Contextual Awareness:**  Consider the user's current location or activity (e.g., if they are at a concert, suggest sharing photos).
*   **Multi-Modal Prompts:**  Combine text with images, videos, or audio to create more engaging prompts.
