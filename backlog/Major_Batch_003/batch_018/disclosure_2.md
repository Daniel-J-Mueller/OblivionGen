## Adaptive Transactional Shielding

**Concept:** Extend the delayed payout/reversal mechanism to actively *shield* transactions from fraudulent chargebacks *before* they occur, leveraging predictive analytics and dynamic authorization adjustments. This moves beyond simply reversing a transaction to proactively mitigating risk.

**Specifications:**

**1. Risk Scoring Engine:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Transaction Amount
    *   Destination Account History (chargeback rate, velocity)
    *   Source Account History (transaction volume, account age)
    *   Geolocation Data (IP address, device location)
    *   Device Fingerprinting (hardware, software)
    *   Time of Day/Week
    *   Real-time Fraud Databases (shared blacklist/whitelist)
*   **Model:** Machine learning model (gradient boosted trees, neural network) trained on historical transaction data and chargeback occurrences. Continuously retrained with new data. Outputs a risk score (0-100).
*   **Thresholds:** Configurable risk thresholds (Low, Medium, High). Different thresholds trigger different actions (see section 3).

**2. Dynamic Authorization Adjustment:**

*   **Mechanism:** Instead of a simple "approve/reject", the authorization request can be modified *before* submission to the payment processor.
*   **Adjustments:**
    *   **Delayed Authorization:** Hold the authorization for a configurable period (e.g., 24-72 hours).  Funds aren’t immediately transferred. Similar to existing functionality but coupled with risk scoring.
    *   **Partial Authorization:** Authorize only a percentage of the transaction amount initially. The remainder is authorized after a delay, contingent on a re-evaluation of the risk score.
    *   **Micro-Authorization:** Authorize a very small amount (e.g., $1.00) initially for verification. Full authorization occurs after successful verification.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication Trigger:**  If the risk score exceeds a threshold, require the user to complete a multi-factor authentication challenge before finalizing the authorization.

**3. Workflow Integration (Pseudocode):**

```
function process_transaction(transaction_data):
  risk_score = calculate_risk_score(transaction_data)

  if risk_score <= LOW_THRESHOLD:
    // Standard authorization process
    authorize_transaction(transaction_data)
    return success

  else if risk_score <= MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
    // Delayed Authorization
    delay_period = calculate_delay_period(risk_score)
    hold_authorization(transaction_data, delay_period)
    schedule_reauthorization(transaction_data, delay_period) // Re-evaluate risk score after delay

  else if risk_score <= HIGH_THRESHOLD:
    //Partial Authorization
    partial_amount = calculate_partial_amount(risk_score)
    authorize_partial_amount(transaction_data, partial_amount)
    schedule_reauthorization_remainder(transaction_data, partial_amount)

  else:
    // High Risk – Trigger MFA or Deny
    trigger_mfa(transaction_data) //Or deny transaction

    return failure
```

**4.  Ledger Integration:**

*   Extend the existing ledger to record not just completed transactions, but *authorization attempts*, risk scores, and any applied dynamic adjustments.
*   This data is critical for model training and refining risk thresholds.

**5.  Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:**

*   Dashboard to visualize risk scores, adjusted authorizations, and potential fraudulent activity.
*   Alerting system to notify administrators of high-risk transactions or suspicious patterns.



This system aims to move beyond reactive fraud prevention to a proactive, adaptive approach that minimizes chargebacks and protects both merchants and consumers. It builds upon the existing delayed payout mechanism by adding a layer of predictive analytics and dynamic authorization control.
