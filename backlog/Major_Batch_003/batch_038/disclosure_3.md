## Dynamic Storytelling Environment Mapping & Projection

**Concept:** Extend the environmental awareness of the system to *physically* alter the storyteller/audience environment in real-time, enhancing immersion beyond visual/audio effects.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multiple depth sensors (e.g., LiDAR, structured light) per environment (storyteller & audience). Resolution: >= 2m depth map. Range: 0.5m - 10m.
    *   Array of micro-projectors (pixel density >= 500dpi) capable of projecting onto arbitrary surfaces.  Minimum: 20 projectors per environment.  Color Gamut: DCI-P3.  Brightness: >= 500 nits.
    *   Haptic feedback emitters (localized vibration/air pressure) arrayed around the storyteller/audience space. Density: >= 1 emitter per 0.5m².
    *   Environmental control system: Ability to modulate temperature, humidity, and airflow within defined zones.  Resolution: +/- 0.5°C / +/- 5% RH.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Real-time 3D Reconstruction:**  Processes depth sensor data to build a dynamic, accurate 3D model of the environment.  Update rate: >= 30Hz.  Mesh complexity: Adjustable based on processing power.
    *   **Semantic Segmentation:**  Identifies objects and surfaces within the 3D model (walls, furniture, floor, etc.).  Accuracy: >= 85%.
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:**  Calculates projection patterns to seamlessly blend projected content onto identified surfaces, accounting for geometry, lighting, and texture.  Supports dynamic content updates.
    *   **Haptic Synchronization:**  Synchronizes haptic feedback with visual and audio effects to enhance immersion.  Supports localized and directional haptic patterns.
    *   **Environmental Control Interface:**  Modulates temperature, humidity, and airflow based on story events. (e.g., simulate a cold wind, humid jungle).
    *   **Story Event Trigger System:**  Receives triggers from the existing system (gestures, audio, time) and translates them into environmental control commands, projection patterns, and haptic feedback sequences.
    *   **Privacy/Safety Layer:** Restricts environmental changes (e.g., temperature) based on user preferences or safety parameters.

**Pseudocode (Story Event Trigger to Environment Modification):**

```
FUNCTION HandleStoryEvent(event, storyFragment)
    SWITCH event.type
        CASE "Gesture_SwipeRight"
            IF storyFragment.environment == "Forest" THEN
                // Simulate wind blowing through trees
                ActivateHapticEmitters(location="Audience_Left", pattern="WindGust")
                SetProjectorPattern("Forest_Trees", animation="SwayingBranches")
                AdjustAirflow(zone="Audience_Left", direction="LeftToRight", intensity="Medium")
            ENDIF
        CASE "Audio_Thunder"
            SetProjectorPattern("Sky", animation="LightningStrike")
            ActivateHapticEmitters(location="Audience_All", pattern="ThunderVibration")
            AdjustLighting(zone="Audience_All", brightness=-50%)
        CASE "Time_5Seconds"
            IF storyFragment.environment == "Cave" THEN
                AdjustTemperature(zone="Audience_All", degrees=-2) // Simulate cave chill
                SetProjectorPattern("CaveWalls", animation="DrippingWater")
                ActivateHapticEmitters(location="Audience_Front", pattern="WaterDrip")
        CASE "Voice_Command_Fire"
            SetProjectorPattern("Walls", animation="FlickeringFire")
            AdjustTemperature(zone="Audience_Front", degrees=5)
            ActivateHapticEmitters(location="Audience_Front", pattern="HeatWave")
    ENDSWITCH
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** The combination of dynamic 3D environmental reconstruction, synchronized projection mapping, haptic feedback, *and* physical environmental control, driven by story events, creates a level of immersion beyond anything currently available. It moves beyond passive viewing to active environmental participation. It can facilitate a broader range of emotional responses than typical AR.
