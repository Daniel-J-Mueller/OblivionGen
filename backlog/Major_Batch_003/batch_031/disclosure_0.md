## Dynamic Content Enrichment for Social Lead Generation

**Concept:** Extend the lead generation classification system to proactively *enrich* external lead pages with social context before the user even navigates there, creating a more seamless and personalized experience. This goes beyond simply mirroring input fields; it's about layering social data *onto* the external page itself, delivered via a browser extension or similar mechanism.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Social Context Broker:** A server component responsible for maintaining a database of user social profiles (with appropriate privacy controls, of course). This profile would include publicly available information, expressed preferences, and any explicitly granted permissions. 

2.  **Real-time URL Analysis:** Upon detection of a link shared on the social network (similar to the existing patent), the system analyzes the URL to determine if it’s a candidate for enrichment. If classified as a potential lead-gen page, the analysis proceeds.

3.  **Dynamic Injection Module:** A browser extension (or similar client-side component) that intercepts the HTTP response for the lead-gen page. This module receives instructions from the Social Context Broker regarding what data to inject.

4.  **Data Injection Strategies:** Several injection strategies are available:
    *   **Mutual Connection Highlighting:** Highlight (or visually indicate) if the user shares connections with anyone associated with the company/product on the lead-gen page (e.g., employees listed on a LinkedIn page).
    *   **Social Proof Overlay:** Display aggregated, anonymized social data (e.g., “X users in your network have expressed interest in this product”) directly on the lead-gen page.
    *   **Personalized Content Snippets:** Based on the user's social profile, inject personalized content snippets (e.g., related articles, case studies) directly into the lead-gen page content.
    *   **Pre-populated Social Fields:** As in the original patent, pre-populate input fields, but expand this to include social profile data (e.g., company, job title) beyond basic contact info.

5.  **User Control & Privacy:**
    *   A clear opt-in/opt-out mechanism for users to control whether their social data is used for enrichment.
    *   Data anonymization and aggregation where appropriate to protect user privacy.
    *   Transparency regarding what data is being used and how it is being used.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Injection Module):**

```
function intercept_http_response(response):
  url = response.url
  if is_lead_gen_url(url):
    social_data = get_social_data(user_id, url)
    enriched_html = enrich_html(response.html, social_data)
    return enriched_html
  else:
    return response.html

function enrich_html(html, social_data):
  # Apply enrichment strategies based on social_data
  if social_data.mutual_connections:
    html = highlight_mutual_connections(html, social_data.mutual_connections)
  if social_data.social_proof:
    html = display_social_proof(html, social_data.social_proof)
  if social_data.personalized_content:
    html = inject_personalized_content(html, social_data.personalized_content)
  if social_data.prepopulated_fields:
    html = prepopulate_input_fields(html, social_data.prepopulated_fields)
  return html
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   Scalability of the Social Context Broker.
*   Performance impact of dynamic HTML injection.
*   Cross-browser compatibility of the browser extension.
*   Robustness to changes in website HTML structure.
*   Maintaining user privacy and data security.
