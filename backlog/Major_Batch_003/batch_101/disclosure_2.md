## Adaptive Prediction Mode Blending

**Concept:** Instead of strictly *selecting* a primary or secondary prediction mode, blend the results of both modes proportionally, weighted by a dynamically calculated 'blend factor'. This allows for finer-grained control over encoding quality and potentially reduces artifacts by combining strengths of different prediction approaches.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Blend Factor Calculation Module:**
    *   Input: `Primary QM`, `Secondary QM`, `Primary Cost`, `Secondary Cost`, `Quality Preference Weight (QPW)` – User adjustable parameter ranging from 0.0 (cost prioritized) to 1.0 (quality prioritized).
    *   Process:
        *   `QM Difference = abs(Primary QM - Secondary QM)`
        *   `Cost Difference = abs(Primary Cost - Secondary Cost)`
        *   `Blend Factor = QPW * (1 - (Cost Difference / (Cost Difference + QM Difference))) + (1 - QPW) * (1 - (QM Difference / (Cost Difference + QM Difference)))`
        *   The `Blend Factor` will range between 0.0 and 1.0.
2.  **Blending Process:**
    *   Input: `Primary Encode`, `Secondary Encode`, `Blend Factor`.
    *   Process:  `Blended Encode = (Blend Factor * Primary Encode) + ((1 - Blend Factor) * Secondary Encode)`
        *   Pixel-wise blending. For each pixel, the corresponding values from `Primary Encode` and `Secondary Encode` are multiplied by `Blend Factor` and `(1 - Blend Factor)` respectively, then added together.
3.  **Integration with Existing Pipeline:**
    *   Insert the “Blend Factor Calculation Module” after the RDO and QM modules.
    *   Route the outputs of the prediction module (`Primary Encode`, `Secondary Encode`) to the blending process.
    *   The blended output replaces the selected primary or secondary encode as the input to subsequent encoding stages (e.g., transform, quantization, entropy coding).
4.  **Hardware Implementation Considerations:**
    *   The blending process is inherently parallelizable and well-suited for implementation in hardware using SIMD instructions.
    *   The `Blend Factor Calculation Module` requires a small amount of arithmetic logic.
    *   Dedicated memory buffers may be needed to store the `Primary Encode` and `Secondary Encode` during the blending process.  Potentially utilize existing buffers within the hardware video encoding pipeline.
5.  **Adaptive QP Adjustment:**
    *   Monitor the distribution of `Blend Factor` values over time.
    *   If the `Blend Factor` consistently favors one prediction mode, dynamically adjust the quantization parameters (QP) for both modes to encourage more balanced blending.  A PID controller may be useful.
    *   This adaptive QP adjustment can further improve encoding efficiency and quality.
