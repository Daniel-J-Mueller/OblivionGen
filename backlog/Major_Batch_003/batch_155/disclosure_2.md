## Dynamic Contextual GUI Elements

**Concept:** A display screen GUI where elements aren't fixed to screen coordinates, but dynamically reposition and resize based on detected user gaze, hand/object proximity, and inferred emotional state. This goes beyond simple touch or voice interaction; the interface *reacts* to the userâ€™s implicit cues.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution eye-tracking camera (minimum 120Hz).
    *   Depth sensor (ToF or structured light) for hand/object detection within a 50cm radius of the screen.
    *   Microphone array for voice tone analysis (emotional state inference).
    *   Optional: Facial expression analysis camera.
*   **GUI Element Classification:**
    *   All GUI elements are tagged with properties: 'importance' (high, medium, low), 'interaction_type' (touch, voice, gaze, proximity), 'sensitivity' (how much it reacts to user cues).
*   **Dynamic Repositioning Algorithm:**
    *   `IF eye_gaze_duration > 0.5s AND element.importance == 'high' THEN`
        *   `element.x = gaze_x + offset_x`
        *   `element.y = gaze_y + offset_y` (Offset is adjustable per element).
    *   `IF hand_proximity < 10cm AND element.interaction_type == 'touch' THEN`
        *   `element.scale = 1.2 + (10cm - hand_proximity) * 0.05` (Scale up element based on proximity, max 1.5).
        *   `element.z_index = 1` (Bring element to front).
    *   `IF inferred_emotion == 'frustration' AND element.importance == 'high' THEN`
        *   `element.highlight = TRUE` (Visual cue to draw attention).
        *   `display_help_tooltip(element)`
    *   `IF element.interaction_type == 'voice' AND voice_command_recognized THEN`
        *   `element.animate_pulse()`
*   **Element Prioritization:**
    *   A system prioritizes element reactions. High-importance elements always react first. Conflict resolution is based on importance levels.
*   **Smoothing & Prediction:**
    *   A Kalman filter is used to smooth gaze and hand movement data, preventing jittery element reactions. Predictive algorithms anticipate user intent based on movement patterns.
*   **Customization:**
    *   Users can define preferred reaction sensitivities and personalize element behaviors.
*   **Rendering Engine:**
    *   Must support dynamic element resizing, repositioning, and z-ordering without significant performance loss.
*   **API:**
    *   A robust API allows developers to create custom reaction behaviors and integrate with other sensor data.
