## Dynamic Avatar Synthesis & Projection

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple video feeds to project synthesized avatars representing user emotional states & gameplay actions *into* the communication layer, augmenting the video feed with reactive visual representations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Module: Affective State Analyzer**

*   **Input:** Real-time video feed of user, microphone input (voice analysis), in-game action data (via API - see section 4).
*   **Processing:** Employs computer vision and audio analysis to detect facial expressions, body language, vocal tone, and in-game events (e.g., taking damage, scoring points, using abilities).
*   **Output:**  A dynamic ‘Affective State Vector’ – a numerical representation of the user’s emotional/gameplay state.  Example components:  [Happiness: 0.8, Excitement: 0.6, Frustration: 0.2, Alertness: 0.9, GameplayIntensity: 0.7].

**2. Avatar Synthesis Engine**

*   **Input:** Affective State Vector.
*   **Processing:**  Maps elements of the Affective State Vector to pre-defined avatar characteristics and animations. This isn’t about creating a *realistic* representation, but an *expressive* one. 
    *   Example Mappings:
        *   High Excitement -> Avatar glows brighter, particle effects intensify.
        *   High Frustration -> Avatar displays agitated movements, color shifts towards red.
        *   Gameplay Intensity -> Avatar’s “attack” animations become more frequent.
        *   Happiness -> Avatar ‘smiles’ (abstracted form – light pattern change, shape distortion, etc.).
*   **Output:** Rendered avatar frame – a 2D or 3D visual representation designed for layered projection.  Rendered as a series of sprites/textures optimized for low latency.

**3. Communication Layer Integration**

*   **Input:** Rendered avatar frame, original video feed.
*   **Processing:** The avatar is projected *onto* the video feed, using a configurable blending mode (e.g., additive, multiplicative, screen).  Key features:
    *   **Dynamic Masking:**  The avatar is masked to avoid obscuring critical elements of the video feed (face, hands, etc.).  Computer vision algorithms identify these elements in real-time.
    *   **Layer Prioritization:**  The communication interface layers (video feed, avatar, game container) are assigned priorities.  Avatar layer is generally above video feed, but below critical game UI elements.
    *   **Customization:** Users can select from a library of avatar styles (e.g., abstract shapes, stylized creatures, energy beings) and customize their appearance.
*   **Output:** Combined visual output – the video feed augmented with the dynamic avatar.

**4. API Integration & Game Event Handling**

*   **API:**  Defines a standard interface for games to communicate in-game events to the Avatar Synthesis Engine.  Event Types: DamageTaken, ScorePoints, AbilityUsed,  StateChange (e.g., “in cover”, “reloading”).
*   **Event Handling:** The Avatar Synthesis Engine receives game events via the API and updates the Affective State Vector accordingly.
*   **Cross-Game Compatibility:**  A plugin architecture allows for easy integration with new games.

**Pseudocode (Avatar Synthesis Engine):**

```
function updateAvatar(affectiveState, gameEvent) {
  // Update Affective State Vector based on gameEvent
  affectiveState = updateState(affectiveState, gameEvent);

  // Map Affective State to Avatar Characteristics
  color = mapValue(affectiveState.Excitement, 0, 1, "blue", "red");
  brightness = mapValue(affectiveState.Happiness, 0, 1, 0.5, 1.0);
  scale = mapValue(affectiveState.GameplayIntensity, 0, 1, 1.0, 1.5);

  // Generate Avatar Frame (sprite/texture) based on characteristics
  avatarFrame = generateFrame(color, brightness, scale);

  return avatarFrame;
}

function generateFrame(color, brightness, scale) {
  // (Implementation details - sprite generation/texture blending)
  // Create and return a visual representation of the avatar
}

function mapValue(value, inMin, inMax, outMin, outMax) {
  // Maps a value from one range to another
}
```
