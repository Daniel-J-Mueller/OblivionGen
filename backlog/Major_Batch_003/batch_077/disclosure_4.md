## Dynamic Contextual Embedding Augmentation

**Concept:** Extend the embedding space to incorporate real-time contextual information gleaned *during* the text input process, not just static training data. This allows the system to better disambiguate meaning and suggest increasingly relevant labels.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Real-Time Input Stream Analysis:** Implement a module that analyzes the text input character-by-character (or word-by-word) as the user types. This module focuses on identifying potential ambiguities – words with multiple meanings, phrases with varied interpretations, etc.

2.  **Contextual Feature Extraction:**  For each identified ambiguity, extract contextual features from several sources:
    *   **User History:**  Previous inputs and interactions of the user.
    *   **Current Session Data:**  The topic of the current conversation or task (if applicable).
    *   **External Knowledge Graph:** Access a knowledge graph (e.g., Wikidata, ConceptNet) to retrieve related concepts and their associated probabilities.
    *   **Trending Topics:** Utilize a real-time trending topic API to identify currently popular themes and keywords.

3.  **Dynamic Embedding Adjustment:**  Create a ‘context vector’ based on the extracted contextual features.  This vector is then *added* to the initial text embedding generated by the deep-learning model. The weight of the context vector should be adjustable – higher weight for ambiguous inputs, lower weight for clear inputs.  

    *Pseudocode:*
    ```
    text_embedding = deep_learning_model(text_input)
    ambiguity_score = analyze_input(text_input) // Higher score = more ambiguity
    context_vector = generate_context_vector(text_input, user_history, trending_topics)
    weight = sigmoid(ambiguity_score) // Scale weight between 0 and 1
    augmented_embedding = text_embedding + (weight * context_vector)
    ```

4.  **Adaptive Label Scoring:**  Modify the label identification process to use the `augmented_embedding` when calculating similarity scores. This will bias the results toward labels that are relevant to the *current* context, not just the historical training data.

5.  **Feedback Loop:** Incorporate a user feedback mechanism.  If the user selects a suggested label, increase the weight given to the contextual features that contributed to that suggestion. If the user rejects a suggestion, decrease the weight.  This allows the system to learn and adapt to the user’s preferences over time.

6.  **Multi-Modal Input Consideration:** Extend feature extraction to include other modalities, like location data or time-of-day. This could be useful in suggesting labels related to local events or activities.

**Engineering Notes:**

*   The `generate_context_vector` function will require significant development and testing to ensure that the contextual features are effectively represented and contribute to improved label suggestions.
*   The `sigmoid` function is a suggested way to scale the weight of the context vector, but other scaling functions could also be used.
*   Consider using a dedicated machine learning model to predict the optimal weight for the context vector based on the input text and user history.
*   The system should be designed to handle a high volume of real-time input data and maintain low latency.
