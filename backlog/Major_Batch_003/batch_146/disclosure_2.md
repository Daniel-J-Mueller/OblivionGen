## Dynamic Congestion Prediction & Proactive Segment Re-ordering

**Concept:** Instead of solely reacting to NACKs, proactively predict network congestion *before* packets are lost, and re-order segments for transmission to mitigate predicted bottlenecks. This isn't about faster retransmission; it's about *avoiding* loss in the first place.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Congestion Prediction Engine (CPE) – implemented in both transmitter and receiver.
*   **Data Inputs (Transmitter CPE):**
    *   Packet Sequence Numbers (PSNs) – as in the patent.
    *   Round Trip Time (RTT) – measured per-packet or averaged.
    *   Inter-Packet Arrival Times – timestamp data from packet transmission.
    *   Historical Congestion Data – a rolling window of RTT and loss events.
*   **Data Outputs (Transmitter CPE):**
    *   Congestion Probability Vector (CPV) – a vector indicating the probability of congestion for each upcoming segment (e.g., next 10 segments).
    *   Segment Re-ordering Schedule – a prioritized list of segments for transmission.
*   **Data Inputs (Receiver CPE):**
    *   PSNs
    *   RTT
    *   Packet Loss Rate (PLR) – directly observed.
*   **Data Outputs (Receiver CPE):**
    *   Congestion Feedback – sent to transmitter.  More granular than simple ACK/NACK.
    *   PLR data for transmitter.
*   **Algorithm (Transmitter):**
    1.  **Prediction:** CPE analyzes historical data (RTT, PLR) and current network conditions (inter-packet arrival times) to predict congestion probability for each segment. Uses a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
    2.  **Prioritization:** Segments with higher congestion probability are assigned lower priority. The algorithm aims to send segments through less congested paths (if multiple paths are available), or to spread the load by introducing minor delays in transmission.
    3.  **Re-ordering:** Segments are re-ordered based on priority, creating a transmission schedule. This schedule isn't necessarily strict FIFO.
    4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The algorithm continuously monitors RTT and PLR, adjusting the congestion prediction and re-ordering schedule in real-time.
*   **Algorithm (Receiver):**
    1.  **Congestion Monitoring:** Track RTT and PLR.
    2.  **Feedback Generation:** Send congestion feedback to the transmitter, detailing observed congestion levels.
    3.  **PLR Reporting:** Report PLR to the transmitter.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `CongestionProbabilityVector`: `float[]` – representing the probability of congestion for each segment.
    *   `SegmentSchedule`: `SegmentID[]` – prioritized list of segment IDs for transmission.
    *   `HistoricalCongestionData`: `TimeSeriesData[]` – storing RTT, PLR, and other relevant metrics over time.

**Pseudocode (Transmitter):**

```
function transmitSegment(segmentID, segmentData):
  congestionProbability = predictCongestion(segmentID)
  priority = 1 / congestionProbability  // Higher probability = lower priority
  segmentSchedule = updateSegmentSchedule(segmentID, priority)
  transmit(segmentSchedule)
end function

function predictCongestion(segmentID):
  // Use historical data (RTT, PLR) and current network conditions
  // to predict congestion probability using a time-series forecasting model
  // (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
  return congestionProbability
end function

function updateSegmentSchedule(segmentID, priority):
    //Insert segment into schedule based on priority
    //May involve delaying segments to spread load
    return segmentSchedule
end function
```

**Innovation:** This system doesn’t just *react* to dropped packets, it attempts to *predict* and *prevent* them by intelligently re-ordering transmission segments. This moves beyond standard error correction and into proactive network management.  The granularity of feedback from the receiver informs a more sophisticated prediction model on the transmitter side.
