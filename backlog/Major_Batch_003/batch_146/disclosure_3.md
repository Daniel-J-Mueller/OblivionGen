## Dynamic Entity Persona Integration

**Concept:** Extend entity augmentation beyond simple previews and controls to create dynamically updating “personas” within messaging threads. These personas aren't static profiles, but active representations of entities that adapt their presentation and available actions based on context and real-time data.

**Specs:**

*   **Persona Core:** A data structure associated with each entity referenced in a thread. This core stores:
    *   Entity Type (User, Article, Location, etc.)
    *   Base Data (Name, Description, Static Preview)
    *   Dynamic Data Sources (APIs, RSS Feeds, Real-time Data Streams)
    *   Presentation Rules (How data is displayed, prioritized, and formatted)
    *   Action Rules (What actions are available based on context and user roles)

*   **Contextual Awareness Engine:** A component that analyzes the messaging thread content (text, media, user interactions) to determine the current context. This includes:
    *   Sentiment Analysis:  Detecting the emotional tone of messages related to the entity.
    *   Topic Extraction: Identifying the key topics being discussed.
    *   User Intent Recognition:  Inferring what users are trying to achieve.

*   **Dynamic Presentation Layer:**  Renders the entity persona within the message thread. This layer:
    *   Fetches data from the Dynamic Data Sources based on Contextual Awareness.
    *   Applies Presentation Rules to format the data.
    *   Updates the persona display in real-time as new data becomes available.
    *   Renders interactive elements based on Action Rules.

*   **Action Handling Module:** Processes user interactions with the entity persona.  This module:
    *   Executes the corresponding action defined in the Action Rules.
    *   Provides feedback to the user on the action’s outcome.
    *   Updates the Contextual Awareness Engine with the action’s result.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function updateEntityPersona(entityID, messageContext) {
  personaCore = getPersonaCore(entityID);
  dynamicData = fetchDynamicData(personaCore.dynamicDataSources, messageContext);
  presentation = applyPresentationRules(personaCore.presentationRules, dynamicData);
  actions = generateActionList(personaCore.actionRules, messageContext);
  renderPersona(presentation, actions);
}

function renderPersona(presentation, actions) {
    // Display dynamic preview + available actions in message thread
}

function handleUserAction(actionID, entityID) {
    // Execute action & update context
}
```

**Example:**

Imagine a user sharing an article link in a thread.  Instead of a static article preview, the dynamic persona could:

*   Display a trending topic summary related to the article.
*   Show real-time stock prices if the article discusses a public company.
*   Present a poll asking users for their opinion on the article’s main claim.
*   Offer a "Summarize" action using an AI to provide a concise overview.
*   Display the article's author's social media feed.

This shifts entity references from passive links to active, intelligent components within the messaging experience. The persona adapts to the conversation, providing relevant information and facilitating deeper engagement.
