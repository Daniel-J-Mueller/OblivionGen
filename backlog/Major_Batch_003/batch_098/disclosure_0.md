## Dynamic Location 'Fencing' Based on Predicted Intent

**Concept:** Extend location sharing beyond simple requests to proactively share location *within* predicted zones of user activity. The system learns user routines and anticipates likely destinations, initiating location sharing *before* a request is made, but only within pre-defined, dynamically adjusted 'fences'.

**Specs:**

*   **Intent Prediction Module:** A machine learning model trained on user location history, calendar events, communication patterns (message content analysis for keywords like “meeting”, “dinner”, “going to”), and app usage. This module predicts the user’s likely destinations and timeframes.
*   **Dynamic Geo-Fence Creation:** Based on intent prediction, the system creates geo-fences around predicted destinations. These fences aren’t static; their size and shape adapt based on real-time traffic, time of day, and learned user behavior (e.g., expanding the fence around a restaurant if the user frequently meets friends nearby).
*   **Proactive Location Sharing Protocol:**  Upon entering a predicted zone (geo-fence), the system *automatically* initiates location sharing with pre-approved contacts (defined by the user as 'trusted contacts' – leveraging the existing patent's framework).  Location data is *not* continuously streamed; instead, it's shared at pre-defined intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) or upon significant movement within the fence.
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Users have granular control over this proactive sharing:
    *   **Category-Based Filtering:**  Users can specify *types* of predicted activities for which proactive sharing is enabled (e.g., work meetings, social gatherings, errands).
    *   **Contact-Specific Rules:** Users can define different sharing rules for different trusted contacts (e.g., share location with family within a 1-mile radius of home, but only during evening hours).
    *   **'Ghost Mode' Override:** A user can temporarily disable all proactive sharing with a single tap.
    *   **Fence Visibility:**  The user can visualize the predicted fences on a map to understand *where* their location might be shared.
*   **Communication Protocol Enhancement:** The original patent’s messaging thread is used, but location updates are formatted as concise, time-stamped messages within the thread (e.g., "Arrived at [Location] - 7:15 PM").

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction & Fence Creation):**

```
FUNCTION PredictUserIntent(userLocationHistory, calendarEvents, communicationPatterns, appUsage):
  // ML Model Processes Data
  predictedDestinations = ML_Model.Predict(userLocationHistory, calendarEvents, communicationPatterns, appUsage)
  RETURN predictedDestinations

FUNCTION CreateDynamicFence(destination, confidenceLevel, timeOfDay, trafficData):
  fenceRadius = BaseRadius * ConfidenceLevel //Adjust radius based on prediction confidence
  fenceShape = OptimizeShape(destination, trafficData) //Account for road networks
  fenceCoordinates = CalculateCoordinates(destination, fenceRadius, fenceShape)
  RETURN fenceCoordinates

//Main Loop
WHILE User is Active:
  predictedDestinations = PredictUserIntent(userLocationHistory, calendarEvents, communicationPatterns, appUsage)
  FOR each destination in predictedDestinations:
    IF destination is within a reasonable timeframe:
      fenceCoordinates = CreateDynamicFence(destination, predictionConfidence, timeOfDay, trafficData)
      ActivateFence(fenceCoordinates)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **"Safe Zone" Alerts:**  Notify trusted contacts if the user deviates significantly from the predicted route or exits the fence unexpectedly.
*   **"ETA Prediction" Enhancement:** Leverage the predicted route and real-time traffic data to provide increasingly accurate Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) updates to trusted contacts.
*   **Integration with Smart Home Devices:**  Trigger actions based on location within the fence (e.g., automatically unlock the door when the user approaches home).
