## Dynamic Iconography Based on Biometric Data

**Concept:** A display screen interface where graphical icons representing applications or functions *morph* and visually adapt in real-time based on the user’s current biometric data – specifically, subtle facial muscle movements (micro-expressions) and heart rate variability (HRV). This goes beyond simple animations triggered by selection; the icons *become* a visual representation of the user's internal state.

**Specifications:**

*   **Input:**
    *   High-resolution camera (integrated into the display or external) – capable of capturing subtle facial muscle movements. Minimum 60fps.
    *   Heart rate sensor (integrated into the device, wearable, or via camera-based photoplethysmography). Sample rate: 100Hz.
    *   Machine Learning Model: Trained on a diverse dataset linking facial micro-expressions & HRV to emotional/cognitive states (e.g., focus, stress, calm, boredom).  Model must output 'state vectors' representing the current user state.

*   **Icon Design:**
    *   Icons are not static images. They are constructed from vector-based shapes and procedural animations.
    *   Each icon must have a defined set of ‘morph targets’ or ‘blend shapes’ – essentially pre-defined deformations representing different emotional/cognitive states. Example: an email icon might become more angular and ‘sharp’ when the user is stressed, or ‘soft’ and rounded when relaxed.
    *   Icons should have a base ‘neutral’ state and a set of corresponding state mappings.

*   **Real-time Processing:**
    1.  **Biometric Data Acquisition:** Capture facial video and HRV data.
    2.  **Feature Extraction:** Use computer vision algorithms to identify key facial landmarks and calculate micro-expression scores. Process HRV data to determine stress/relaxation levels.
    3.  **State Vector Generation:** The ML model combines facial expression data and HRV data to generate a 'state vector' – a multi-dimensional representation of the user's current emotional/cognitive state.
    4.  **Icon Morphing:**  The 'state vector' is mapped to the icon's morph targets. Blend shapes are dynamically applied, causing the icon to visually transform in real-time.

*   **Pseudocode (Icon Update):**

```
function UpdateIcon(icon, stateVector) {
  // Define weights for each morph target based on the state vector
  weightStress = stateVector.stressLevel * 0.8;
  weightFocus = stateVector.focusLevel * 0.6;
  weightCalm = stateVector.calmLevel * 0.4;

  // Apply weights to morph targets.  Scale values from 0-1
  icon.setMorphTarget("sharpness", weightStress);
  icon.setMorphTarget("roundness", weightCalm);
  icon.setMorphTarget("expansion", weightFocus);

  // Optional: Color shifting based on state
  icon.setColor(stateVector.emotionalColor); // color mapping from state

  // Render icon
}
```

*   **User Customization:**  Allow users to adjust the sensitivity of the biometric data and the intensity of the icon morphing effects. This allows personalization and prevents the system from being distracting.

*   **Potential Applications:** Enhanced user engagement, improved accessibility for users with cognitive impairments, real-time emotional feedback for gaming or virtual reality experiences.
