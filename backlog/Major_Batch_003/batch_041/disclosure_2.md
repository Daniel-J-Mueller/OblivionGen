**Dynamic Ad Component Dependencies & Predictive Rejection**

**Concept:** Extend the preliminary ad review process by not only prioritizing review based on component review *time*, but also by establishing *dependencies* between ad components. Furthermore, introduce a predictive rejection system based on historical data of component combinations leading to rejections.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dependency Graph Creation:**

*   **Data Input:** Each ad component type (image, headline, description, call to action, landing page URL, etc.) is assigned a set of dependent components. This is a configurable database.  For example:
    *   Image -> Landing Page URL (Image content must align with landing page)
    *   Headline -> Description (Description must elaborate on Headline)
    *   Call to Action -> Landing Page URL (Landing page must fulfill the CTA promise).
*   **Dependency Weighting:**  Each dependency has an associated weight (0-1). Higher weight indicates stronger dependency/more critical alignment.  Configurable per dependency type.
*   **Graph Structure:**  The system maintains a directed graph representing these dependencies.  Nodes are component types, edges are dependencies with associated weights.

**2.  Review Prioritization Enhancement:**

*   **Dependency-Aware Prioritization:** The initial review order isn’t *solely* based on review time, but combines review time *and* dependency criticality.  Components with high-weight dependencies on unreviewed components are prioritized.
*   **Cascading Review:**  When a component is reviewed, the system automatically flags dependent components for review, even if they weren’t originally scheduled based on time alone.

**3. Predictive Rejection System:**

*   **Historical Data Collection:** The system continuously logs component combinations and the resulting ad approval/rejection status.
*   **Pattern Identification:** A machine learning model (e.g., a Bayesian Network or a Random Forest) is trained on this data to identify patterns of component combinations that strongly correlate with rejections.
*   **Rejection Probability Score:** As the preliminary ad is built, the system calculates a “rejection probability score” based on the current combination of components. This score is updated dynamically with each new component addition or modification.
*   **Early Warning System:**  If the rejection probability score exceeds a certain threshold, the system proactively displays a warning to the advertiser, highlighting the potentially problematic component combination *before* final submission. The warning includes suggestions for modifying the components to mitigate the risk of rejection. This uses NLP to suggest changes based on the reasons for previous rejections.

**4.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Storage:** Dependency graph and historical rejection data stored in a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) for efficient querying.
*   **API Integration:**  Integration with existing ad review API to trigger reviews and receive results.
*   **Configurable Thresholds:**  Administrator controls for adjusting rejection probability thresholds and dependency weights.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Implementation of A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the predictive rejection system in reducing ad rejection rates.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
DependencyGraph = LoadDependencyGraphFromDB()
RejectionModel = LoadTrainedRejectionModel()

//Ad Creation Process
while (advertiser is building ad) {
    component = getNextAdComponent()
    if (component != null) {
        ReviewPriority = CalculateReviewPriority(component, DependencyGraph, ReviewedComponents)
        ReviewComponent(component, ReviewPriority)
        UpdateRejectionProbability(RejectionModel, CurrentAdComponents)
        if (RejectionProbability > Threshold) {
            DisplayWarningToAdvertiser(ProblematicComponents, SuggestedChanges)
        }
        UpdateReviewedComponents(component)
    }
}

//Function: CalculateReviewPriority
//Input: Component, DependencyGraph, ReviewedComponents
//Output: ReviewPriority (Integer)
//Logic:  Base priority on component review time.  Increase priority if dependent components are unreviewed.  Weight increase based on dependency weight.

//Function: UpdateRejectionProbability
//Input: RejectionModel, CurrentAdComponents
//Output: RejectionProbability (Float)
//Logic: Feed CurrentAdComponents to trained RejectionModel to get probability of rejection.
