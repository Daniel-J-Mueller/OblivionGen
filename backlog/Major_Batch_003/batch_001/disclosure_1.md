## Dynamic Life Event 'Mood Boards' & Generative Asset Integration

**Concept:** Expand beyond pre-defined life event templates and static content integration. Create dynamic, visually-rich 'mood boards' generated *proactively* based on predicted life events, leveraging generative AI for asset creation and personalized curation.

**Specs:**

**I. Predictive Life Event Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:** User activity (posts, interactions, calendar events, location data – with consent), publicly available data (news, weather, seasonal trends), inferred relationships (family, friends, colleagues).
*   **Algorithm:** Time-series forecasting model (LSTM or Transformer-based) to predict likelihood of specific life events (e.g., birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, job changes, travel plans, seasonal activities).  Output:  Probability score for each event within a defined time horizon (e.g., next 3 months).
*   **Trigger Threshold:**  Adjustable probability threshold to initiate mood board generation.  User-defined sensitivity settings (e.g., "Notify me of potential events with >70% probability").

**II. Generative Mood Board Engine:**

*   **Core:** Stable Diffusion/DALL-E 3 integration, locally or via API.
*   **Prompt Generation:**  Key component.  Based on predicted life event and user profile data.
    *   **Event Keywords:** Extract core keywords from predicted event (e.g., "graduation," "beach vacation," "new baby").
    *   **User Aesthetics Profile:**  Capture user's visual preferences (color palettes, art styles, themes) via implicit feedback (interaction with past content) and explicit input (style questionnaires).
    *   **Dynamic Prompt Construction:**  Combine event keywords, aesthetics profile, and “style modifiers” (e.g., "photorealistic," "watercolor painting," "vintage poster") to generate detailed prompts.
*   **Asset Generation & Curation:**
    *   **Generate Images:** Use generated prompts to create multiple image variations via the chosen generative model.
    *   **Stock Photo Integration:** Supplement generated images with relevant stock photos/videos (optional).
    *   **Automated Layout:** Algorithmically arrange generated/curated assets into a visually appealing layout (grid, collage, mosaic). Consider aspects of visual hierarchy, balance, and flow.
*   **Output:** Rendered mood board image/video.

**III. User Interface & Interaction:**

*   **Proactive Display:**  Present predicted mood boards to the user *before* the event occurs.  “Here's a mood board we created for your potential birthday celebration next month.  Feel free to customize it!”
*   **Customization Options:**
    *   **Asset Replacement:** Allow users to easily replace generated/curated assets with their own photos/videos.
    *   **Layout Adjustment:**  Provide tools to modify the layout (e.g., drag-and-drop, resizing, filtering).
    *   **Theme Selection:** Offer pre-defined theme options (e.g., “Tropical Getaway,” “Rustic Wedding,” “Modern Minimalist”).
    *   **Text Overlay:** Allow users to add custom text (e.g., “Happy Birthday!” “Congratulations!”).
*   **Sharing Options:**  Enable users to easily share mood boards on social media, via email, or as part of a larger life event announcement.
*   **Integration with Existing Life Event Features:**  Seamlessly integrate mood boards into existing life event templates and notification workflows.

**Pseudocode (Mood Board Generation):**

```
function generateMoodBoard(predictedEvent, userProfile) {
  eventKeywords = extractKeywords(predictedEvent);
  userAesthetics = getUserAesthetics(userProfile);
  prompt = constructPrompt(eventKeywords, userAesthetics);

  generatedImages = generateImagesWithAI(prompt);
  curatedImages = getRelevantCuratedImages(prompt);

  combinedImages = merge(generatedImages, curatedImages);
  layout = applyLayoutAlgorithm(combinedImages);

  renderedMoodBoard = render(layout);

  return renderedMoodBoard;
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond *classifying* events to *anticipating* and *visually preparing* for them. The proactive, AI-driven mood board generation creates a more engaging and personalized experience.  It leverages generative AI not just to create content, but to inspire and facilitate life event celebrations.
