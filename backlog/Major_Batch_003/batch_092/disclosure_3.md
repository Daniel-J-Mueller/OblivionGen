## Dynamic Precision Matrix Cores with Temporal Reconfiguration

**Concept:** Exploit inherent redundancies in matrix computations by dynamically adjusting the precision of individual matrix cores *during* computation, and reconfiguring the point-to-point connections to route data to cores optimized for the current precision level.

**Motivation:** Many matrix operations don’t *require* full precision throughout the entire calculation. Lower precision allows for faster computation and reduced power consumption. This system allows for adapting precision *on the fly*, maximizing efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. The existing patent focuses on data *joining* and routing – this expands on the *capabilities* of the processing elements themselves.

**System Specifications:**

1.  **Precision-Configurable Matrix Cores:** Each processing element’s matrix computing unit will be comprised of multiple sub-cores, each capable of operating at different precision levels (FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4, even binary).  Each sub-core has a performance/power metric associated with it.

2.  **Runtime Precision Assessment:** A dedicated “Precision Assessment Unit” (PAU) monitors the evolving data range and error propagation during matrix operations.  The PAU utilizes a predictive error model.  This model anticipates the error introduced by reduced precision, and adjusts precision levels preemptively.

3.  **Dynamic Reconfiguration Network (DRN):**  The point-to-point connections between processing elements are augmented with a “Dynamic Reconfiguration Network” (DRN). The DRN is a programmable switch fabric allowing for real-time alteration of data routing pathways. Each connection isn't fixed, but can be split or merged.

4.  **Precision-Aware Data Partitioning:** Input matrices are partitioned based on the predicted precision requirements of each sub-matrix.  Sub-matrices requiring high precision are routed to FP32/FP16 cores.  Those tolerant of lower precision are routed to INT8/INT4 cores.  The PAU informs the partitioning process.

5.  **Error Feedback Loop:**  The results from lower-precision cores are continuously monitored by the PAU.  If error exceeds a threshold, the PAU dynamically re-routes data to higher-precision cores, or adjusts the partitioning strategy.

6.  **Communication Protocol Enhancement:** The communication bus incorporates a "Precision Metadata" field alongside data packets. This metadata indicates the precision level of the data, enabling receiving cores to correctly interpret the data and perform necessary scaling/normalization.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Data Partitioning & Routing):**

```
function partition_and_route(matrix, PAU):
  sub_matrices = divide(matrix, block_size)
  routing_plan = {}
  for sub_matrix in sub_matrices:
    precision_level = PAU.predict_precision(sub_matrix)
    target_core = find_available_core(precision_level)
    routing_plan[sub_matrix] = target_core
  return routing_plan

function find_available_core(precision_level):
  #Search available cores. prioritize cores with matching precision.
  #If no exact match, select the closest available precision.
  return core

function process_sub_matrix(sub_matrix, core):
    result = core.compute(sub_matrix)
    return result
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Requires a significant increase in the complexity of the point-to-point connections due to the DRN.
*   Increased area overhead due to the multiple sub-cores within each processing element.
*   PAU requires dedicated hardware for error modeling and precision prediction.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Substantial performance gains through adaptive precision.
*   Reduced power consumption by leveraging lower-precision computation.
*   Increased computational throughput by optimizing resource allocation.
*   Fault tolerance due to dynamic resource allocation. If a core fails, it can be circumvented.
