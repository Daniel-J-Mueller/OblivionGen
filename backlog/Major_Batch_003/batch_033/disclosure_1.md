## Dynamic Ad Fatigue Prediction & Proactive Creative Refresh

**Concept:** Extend the yield curve optimization to *predict* ad fatigue *before* it manifests as declining performance, and proactively refresh creative assets based on predicted fatigue levels. This moves beyond reacting to performance drops to anticipating and preventing them, maximizing long-term revenue.

**Specs:**

1.  **Fatigue Modeling Module:**
    *   Input: Historical ad performance data (impressions, clicks, conversions), user attributes (as defined in the patent), ad creative features (image analysis, text analysis, keywords), time-based decay factors.
    *   Process: Train a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network) to predict a "fatigue score" for each ad creative asset *per user segment*.  The fatigue score represents the predicted rate of diminishing returns on impressions. Features should include, but aren't limited to: impression count, time since first impression, click-through rate decay, conversion rate decay, novelty score (how different the ad is from previously shown ads to the user).
    *   Output: Fatigue score (0-1, 1 being highest fatigue) for each ad creative/user segment combination.

2.  **Proactive Creative Refresh Engine:**
    *   Input: Fatigue score, current ad inventory (available creative assets), advertiser budget/constraints, yield curve data.
    *   Process:
        *   Define a "fatigue threshold" (e.g., 0.7). When the fatigue score for a particular ad/segment exceeds this threshold, trigger a creative refresh.
        *   Select a new creative asset from the advertiserâ€™s inventory. Selection criteria prioritize:
            *   Maximizing predicted yield curve improvement.
            *   Creative diversity (ensure the new ad is significantly different from the fatigued ad).
            *   Budget constraints.
        *   A/B test the new creative against the fatigued one for a small subset of users to validate performance before full deployment.
    *   Output: Replacement ad creative for fatigued segments.

3.  **Dynamic Yield Curve Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Predicted fatigue scores, historical performance data, advertiser data.
    *   Process:
        *   Adjust the yield curve calculation to incorporate a "fatigue factor."  Ads with higher predicted fatigue scores contribute less to the yield curve calculation, effectively decreasing their allocation of server resources.
        *   The algorithm dynamically adjusts resource allocation, prioritizing ads with lower fatigue scores and higher potential for revenue generation.
    *   Output: Adjusted yield curve for each user segment.

4.  **Creative Feature Database:**
    *   A database storing extracted features from all ad creatives (images, text, keywords). This allows for efficient comparison of creative assets and identification of diverse alternatives.  Features include: dominant colors, object detection (identifying objects in images), sentiment analysis (analyzing the emotional tone of ad text), keyword density.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Refresh Engine):**

```
FUNCTION refresh_creative(ad_id, user_segment):
  fatigue_score = get_fatigue_score(ad_id, user_segment)
  IF fatigue_score > fatigue_threshold:
    available_creatives = get_available_creatives(user_segment)
    best_creative = select_best_creative(available_creatives, user_segment)  //Based on predicted yield and diversity
    run_ab_test(ad_id, best_creative, user_segment)
    IF ab_test_results_positive:
      replace_ad(ad_id, best_creative, user_segment)
  END IF
END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:** This extends the core idea of dynamic resource allocation to *proactively* manage ad fatigue, rather than simply reacting to performance declines. The integration of creative feature analysis and proactive creative refresh is a novel approach to maximizing long-term revenue and advertiser satisfaction.  The combination of yield curve adjustment with the fatigue prediction creates a dynamic, self-optimizing advertising ecosystem.
