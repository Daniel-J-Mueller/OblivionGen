## Dynamic Resolution Cube Map Streaming with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Extend the cube map generation and streaming by incorporating dynamic resolution scaling based on viewer gaze and predictive occlusion culling to drastically reduce bandwidth and rendering load for VR experiences.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

*   **Gaze Tracking Integration:** Integrate with existing VR headset gaze tracking data. This provides a precise point of regard (POR) within the rendered environment.
*   **Dynamic Resolution Cube Map Generator:** A module that generates cube maps with variable resolutions for each face. Resolution is determined by:
    *   **Gaze Proximity:** Faces of the cube map that are closer to the POR receive higher resolutions.  Faces directly facing the viewer's gaze receive the highest resolution.
    *   **Occlusion Prediction:**  A predictive occlusion culling system analyzes the scene geometry to determine which portions of the cube map are likely to be obscured by foreground objects.  Resolutions for obscured portions are drastically reduced or eliminated.
*   **Streaming Server:** A server component optimized for streaming variable-resolution cube maps.  Utilizes a prioritized streaming protocol, ensuring high-resolution cube map faces are delivered before lower-resolution ones. Supports adaptive bitrate streaming based on network conditions.
*   **Client-Side Renderer:** VR client application receives cube map data and applies it to the environment. Performs final rendering and compositing.

**II. Algorithm â€“ Dynamic Resolution Calculation**

```pseudocode
function calculate_cube_map_resolution(face_index, gaze_direction, scene_geometry) {
  // gaze_direction: normalized vector indicating where the viewer is looking
  // face_index:  0-5 representing the six cube map faces (Right, Left, Up, Down, Front, Back)
  // scene_geometry:  Data structure representing the 3D scene

  // 1. Calculate Angle between gaze direction and cube map face normal
  angle = dot_product(gaze_direction, face_normal[face_index])

  // 2. Calculate Distance to nearest obstruction (occlusion culling)
  distance_to_obstruction = calculate_nearest_intersection(ray_from_camera, scene_geometry)

  // 3. Base Resolution
  resolution = BASE_RESOLUTION

  // 4. Resolution Scaling based on Angle
  if (angle > 0.8) { // Nearly direct view
    resolution = resolution * HIGH_RESOLUTION_FACTOR
  } else if (angle > 0.5) {
    resolution = resolution * MEDIUM_RESOLUTION_FACTOR
  }

  // 5. Resolution Scaling based on Occlusion
  if (distance_to_obstruction < OCCLUSION_THRESHOLD) {
    resolution = resolution * LOW_RESOLUTION_FACTOR // Reduce resolution significantly
  }

  // 6. Clamp Resolution
  resolution = clamp(resolution, MIN_RESOLUTION, MAX_RESOLUTION)

  return resolution
}
```

**III. Streaming Protocol:**

*   **Prioritized Streaming:**  The server prioritizes transmission of high-resolution cube map faces.
*   **Delta Compression:**  Utilize delta compression to minimize bandwidth usage, transmitting only changes between frames.
*   **Adaptive Bitrate:** Dynamically adjust the streaming bitrate based on network conditions to maintain a smooth VR experience.

**IV. Client-Side Rendering:**

*   **Asynchronous Loading:**  Load cube map faces asynchronously to prevent frame drops.
*   **Multithreading:** Utilize multithreading to optimize loading and rendering performance.
*   **Texture Filtering:** Utilize appropriate texture filtering techniques to minimize aliasing artifacts.

**V. Hardware Requirements:**

*   VR Headset with Gaze Tracking
*   High-Performance GPU
*   Fast Network Connection

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant Bandwidth Reduction
*   Improved Rendering Performance
*   Enhanced VR Experience
*   Scalability for Large and Complex Environments
