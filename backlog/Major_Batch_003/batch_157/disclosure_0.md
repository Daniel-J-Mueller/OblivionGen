## Dynamic Iconography & Predictive Resizing

**Concept:** A GUI element system where icons aren’t static images, but procedural animations *and* dynamically resize based on predicted user interaction frequency.

**Specs:**

*   **Icon Generation:** Icons are constructed from a library of base shapes (circles, squares, triangles, lines, bezier curves) and animation primitives (scale, rotate, pulse, color shift). Each app/function is assigned a "DNA" – a seed value and a set of rules defining how these primitives are applied.
*   **Prediction Engine:** A lightweight AI (running locally) monitors user interaction – tap/click locations, dwell time, frequency of use. This builds a predictive model of what icons the user is *likely* to interact with next.
*   **Dynamic Resizing:**
    *   Icons predicted to be used frequently are *enlarged* slightly – the enlargement is a function of the prediction confidence.  Maximum enlargement: 20%.
    *   Icons rarely used are *shrunk* – maximum reduction: 15%. This creates visual hierarchy based on usage.
    *   Resizing is animated – a smooth scale transition over 200ms.
*   **Animation Triggers:** Interaction (hover, tap) triggers a brief, unique animation based on the icon’s “DNA”. The animation is subtle – a color shift, a small scale pulse, or a rotational flicker.
*   **Icon “Breathing”:**  Inactive icons subtly “breathe” - a slow, gentle scaling in/out to maintain visual presence without being distracting. Frequency: 1 breath per 5 seconds. Amplitude: 2%.
*   **"DNA" Library:**  A central repository of base shapes, animation primitives, and “DNA” templates. Developers can create new "DNA" or modify existing ones.
*   **Adaptive Complexity:**  The complexity of the icon’s animation is scaled based on device processing power.  Low-end devices will receive simpler animations, while high-end devices receive more complex ones.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine - Simplified):**

```
// Data Structure: IconUsage
struct IconUsage {
  iconID: int;
  lastUsed: timestamp;
  useCount: int;
}

// Array to store icon usage data
IconUsage[] iconUsageData = new IconUsage[NUM_ICONS];

// Function to log icon usage
function logIconUsage(iconID) {
  iconUsageData[iconID].lastUsed = currentTime;
  iconUsageData[iconID].useCount++;
}

// Function to predict next used icon (simplified - uses recency and frequency)
function predictNextIcon() {
  highestScore = -1;
  predictedIconID = -1;

  for (i = 0; i < NUM_ICONS; i++) {
    // Calculate score:  recent usage + total usage
    score = (currentTime - iconUsageData[i].lastUsed)^-1 + iconUsageData[i].useCount;

    if (score > highestScore) {
      highestScore = score;
      predictedIconID = i;
    }
  }

  return predictedIconID;
}

// Main Loop:
onUserInteraction(iconID) {
  logIconUsage(iconID);
  predictedIconID = predictNextIcon();

  // Update icon sizes based on predictedIconID
  // Animate the size change

}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Contextual Animation:**  Animations could be tied to external data – weather, time of day, news feeds.
*   **User-Customizable DNA:** Allow users to create their own icon "DNA" sequences.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:**  Animations could be paired with subtle haptic feedback.
