## Dynamic Iconography Based on User Biometrics

**Concept:** A display screen interface where graphical icons *morph* and subtly animate based on real-time user biometric data – heart rate, skin conductance, facial micro-expressions – to provide immediate, non-verbal feedback on user state *and* as a dynamic aesthetic element.

**Specs:**

*   **Biometric Input:**
    *   Heart Rate: Input via wearable (watch, band) or integrated sensor (if applicable to the device - phone, tablet). Range: 60-180 BPM.
    *   Skin Conductance (Electrodermal Activity - EDA): Via wearable sensor. Measures stress/excitement levels.  Output: 0-100 scale.
    *   Facial Expression Analysis:  Integrated camera analyzes subtle facial muscle movements to determine emotional state (happy, sad, angry, neutral, surprised, fearful, disgusted). Output: weighted probability distribution across these seven core emotions.

*   **Icon Morphology System:**
    *   Core Icons: Standard app/function icons (mail, calendar, settings, etc.)
    *   Morphological Parameters: Each icon will have a set of programmable morphological parameters:
        *   Scale: 90%-110% of base size
        *   Rotation: -5 to +5 degrees
        *   Color Hue Shift: -10 to +10 degrees in the HSV color space.
        *   Shape Distortion:  Subtle deformation using Bezier curves; parameterized by control point offsets.
        *   Internal Animation:  A small, looped animation within the icon (e.g., a pulse, ripple, glow).
    *   Mapping Functions:
        *   Heart Rate -> Icon Pulse Rate & Scale: Higher BPM = faster pulse, slightly larger scale.
        *   Skin Conductance -> Icon Color Saturation & Distortion: Higher EDA = more saturated color, increased shape distortion (subtle 'stress' effect).
        *   Facial Expression -> Icon Internal Animation & Rotation:  'Happy' = brighter glow, slight upward rotation; 'Sad' = dimmer glow, slight downward rotation; ‘Angry’ = faster, jagged pulse; ‘Neutral’ = slow, steady pulse.
    *   Smoothing/Dampening:  Implement a moving average filter on biometric inputs to prevent overly-jittery icon changes.  Adjustable dampening factor.

*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Software:  Integration with existing OS/UI framework (Android, iOS, Windows, etc.).  Use of vector graphics for scalability and smooth animation.
    *   Hardware:  Requires access to biometric data from wearable device or integrated sensors.
    *   User Control:  Settings to enable/disable the feature, adjust sensitivity, and customize icon behavior.  Option to link specific icons to specific biometric indicators.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - runs continuously

readHeartRate() -> heartRateValue
readSkinConductance() -> skinConductanceValue
readFacialExpression() -> emotionVector

// Normalize values to 0-1 range
normalizedHeartRate = map(heartRateValue, 60, 180, 0, 1)
normalizedSkinConductance = map(skinConductanceValue, 0, 100, 0, 1)

// Apply dampening
dampenedHeartRate = dampenedHeartRate * 0.9 + normalizedHeartRate * 0.1
dampenedSkinConductance = dampenedSkinConductance * 0.9 + normalizedSkinConductance * 0.1

// Calculate Icon Parameters
iconScale = 1 + (dampenedHeartRate * 0.05) // up to 5% scale change
iconHueShift = (dampenedSkinConductance * 10) // up to 10 degree hue shift
iconRotation = getDominantEmotionRotation(emotionVector) // Function returns rotation based on emotion

// Apply changes to icon visual representation
updateIcon(icon, iconScale, iconHueShift, iconRotation)
