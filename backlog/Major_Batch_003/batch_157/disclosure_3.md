## Dynamic Focus Gestures for Display Panels

**Concept:** Integrate multi-layered, dynamically shifting visual “focus” areas on the display panel, responding to gaze, hand proximity *and* predicted cognitive load (using bio-sensors or inferred from application usage). These aren’t static highlights, but flowing, layered visuals indicating areas of current/predicted user attention, with varying levels of opacity and animation.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** The system requires integration with eye-tracking, proximity sensors (capacitive or ultrasonic), and optionally, bio-sensors (EEG, GSR – galvanic skin response) or application-level data to estimate cognitive load.
*   **Visual Layers:** The focus effect is comprised of 3-5 translucent layers. Each layer represents a different ‘depth’ of focus.
    *   Layer 1: Immediate gaze/hand proximity – High opacity, fast animation (e.g., radial expansion/contraction).
    *   Layer 2: Predicted next interaction point (based on user behavior/AI prediction) – Medium opacity, moderate animation (e.g., pulsing glow).
    *   Layer 3: Areas of related content/functions (contextual help, suggested actions) - Low opacity, slow animation (e.g., subtle color shift, flowing particles).
    *   Layer 4: Areas triggering Cognitive Load – (Based on bio-sensors/application usage) – Very Low opacity, subtle change in hue.
    *   Layer 5: Areas triggering high-priority notification. – A distinct and separate layer with it's own animation.
*   **Animation Profiles:** Each layer has customizable animation profiles (speed, style, color palette). User-selectable presets (e.g., “Calming,” “Energetic,” “Minimalist”).
*   **Dynamic Opacity:** Opacity of each layer dynamically adjusts based on sensor input and the confidence of the AI prediction (for Layer 2). Uncertainty = Lower opacity. High Confidence = Higher Opacity.
*   **Interaction Effects:** Touching an area with a focus layer triggers a visual ripple effect extending outwards, confirming the interaction.
*   **Adaptive Brightness:**  The intensity of the focus effect adapts to ambient lighting conditions.

**Pseudocode (Simplified – Focus Layer Update):**

```
function UpdateFocusLayers(eyeTrackingData, proximityData, bioSensorData, currentApplicationState) {

  // Calculate immediate focus point (eye/hand)
  immediateFocus = CalculateFocusPoint(eyeTrackingData, proximityData);

  // Predict next interaction point (AI)
  predictedFocus = PredictNextInteraction(currentApplicationState);

  // Determine cognitive load areas
  cognitiveLoadAreas = AnalyzeCognitiveLoad(bioSensorData, currentApplicationState);

  // Create focus layers
  layer1 = CreateLayer(immediateFocus, opacity: 0.8, animation: "radial_expand");
  layer2 = CreateLayer(predictedFocus, opacity: GetPredictedOpacity(predictedFocus), animation: "pulse");
  layer3 = CreateLayer(cognitiveLoadAreas, opacity: 0.2, animation: "color_shift");
  layer4 = CreateLayer(high_priority_notifications, opacity: 0.9, animation: "highlight");

  // Render layers onto display panel
  RenderLayers(layer1, layer2, layer3, layer4);
}

function GetPredictedOpacity(predictedFocus) {
    //AI confidence rating 0-1, mapped to opacity 0.1 - 0.7
    opacity = 0.1 + (AI_Confidence * 0.6);
    return opacity;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Improved user experience by guiding attention.
*   Reducing cognitive load by highlighting important information.
*   Accessibility features for users with visual impairments.
*   Gamification/interactive experiences.
