## Secure Data Attestation via Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) & Verifiable Credentials

**Concept:** Expand the secure data transfer concept to incorporate blockchain-based decentralized identifiers (DIDs) and verifiable credentials (VCs) for enhanced user control, data provenance, and trust. This moves beyond simply securing *in transit* to attesting to the validity and origin of the data itself.

**Specifications:**

**1. DID & VC Generation (User Device):**

*   The application on the user device (web browser, messaging app, etc.) generates a DID for the user, storing the private key securely (e.g., using device biometrics or a secure enclave).
*   Upon request for information (initiated by the business server), the application generates a Verifiable Credential representing the requested data. The VC includes:
    *   `subject`: The user's DID.
    *   `credentialSubject`: The specific data being shared (e.g., address, date of birth).
    *   `type`:  A descriptor of the data type (e.g., "KYCAddress", "DateOfBirth").
    *   `issuer`: The application's DID (acting as a temporary issuer, vouching for the user's input).
    *   `expiration`: A time-to-live for the credential.
    *   `signature`: A digital signature generated using the user’s private key.

**2.  Token Exchange & Credential Transfer:**

*   The business server requests information through the social networking system, as in the original patent.
*   The social networking system sends a token *and* a request for a signed VC to the user’s application.
*   The user application presents the request to the user, and upon consent, creates and signs the VC.
*   The user application sends the *VC itself* (not just raw data) directly to the business server via a secure socket, bypassing the social network server for the actual data transfer. The token is included for correlation.

**3.  Business Server Verification & Audit Trail:**

*   The business server receives the VC and verifies its validity:
    *   Verify the digital signature using the issuer's public key (obtained from a DID registry).
    *   Validate the credential schema (e.g., ensure the "KYCAddress" credential has the expected fields).
    *   Check the expiration date.
*   The business server logs the verification result and the VC hash for auditing purposes.  The token provides a link to the initial request.

**4.  Revocation Mechanism:**

*   Users can revoke their VCs at any time via the application.
*   The application publishes a revocation list (using a distributed ledger or other secure mechanism) containing the revoked VC hashes.
*   The business server periodically checks the revocation list to ensure the VCs it holds are still valid.



**Pseudocode (Business Server - VC Verification):**

```
function verifyVC(vcHash, token):
  // 1. Fetch VC from storage (based on vcHash)
  vc = fetchVC(vcHash)

  // 2. Fetch issuer's public key from DID registry
  issuerDID = vc.issuer
  issuerPubKey = getIssuerPubKey(issuerDID)

  // 3. Verify signature
  if !verifySignature(vc.signature, vc.credentialSubject, issuerPubKey):
    return false // Invalid signature

  // 4. Validate schema (e.g., check field types and required fields)
  if !validateSchema(vc.type, vc.credentialSubject):
    return false // Invalid schema

  // 5. Check expiration date
  if vc.expiration < currentTime:
    return false // Expired credential

  // 6. Check revocation list
  if isRevoked(vcHash):
    return false // Revoked credential

  // 7.  Verification successful
  return true
```

**Innovation Summary:**

This approach moves beyond secure *transmission* to secure *attestation*. By using DIDs and VCs, users gain greater control over their data, and businesses can have higher confidence in its validity.  It establishes a verifiable audit trail and reduces reliance on centralized trust providers.  The existing patent focuses on secure transport; this expands to secure *provenance* of the data itself.
