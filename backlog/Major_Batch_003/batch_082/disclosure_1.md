## Dynamic Content ‘Mood’ Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the system to not just recommend content *creation*, but to dynamically adjust existing content’s ‘mood’ or ‘tone’ to better resonate with current user engagement trends. This moves beyond simply suggesting new content and into active content *optimization*.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Mood/Tone Vectorization:** Develop a machine learning model to analyze existing content (text, images, videos) and assign a ‘mood vector’.  This vector represents quantifiable attributes like ‘positive/negative sentiment’, ‘energy level’ (fast/slow pace), ‘visual complexity’ (minimalist/detailed), ‘formality’ (casual/professional). Training data would consist of content labeled with these attributes by human raters.
2.  **Trend Identification:**  Monitor user engagement metrics (views, shares, saves, comments, time spent) *across the entire platform* to identify emerging ‘mood trends’.  For example, if users are consistently engaging more with upbeat, energetic content, that becomes the dominant trend.  This requires a time-series analysis module.
3.  **Content Adjustment Engine:**  This engine takes content (e.g., a product description) and adjusts it to better align with the current mood trend. Adjustments can include:
    *   **Text:** Rewriting sentences using synonyms with different emotional connotations, adjusting sentence length/complexity, adding/removing emojis.
    *   **Images:** Applying filters to adjust brightness, contrast, saturation, color temperature, and adding/removing visual elements.
    *   **Videos:** Adjusting playback speed, adding background music with different tempos/moods, applying visual effects (e.g., color grading, transitions).
4.  **A/B Testing Framework:** Implement an A/B testing framework to compare the performance of original content vs. adjusted content. This allows the system to learn which adjustments are most effective.
5.  **Entity Control Panel:** Provide the entity with controls to:
    *   View the proposed adjustments.
    *   Approve or reject the adjustments.
    *   Set ‘guardrails’ on the types of adjustments that are allowed (e.g., prevent overly dramatic changes).
    *   Specify a preferred ‘content voice’ (e.g., maintain a consistent brand identity).

**Pseudocode (Content Adjustment Engine):**

```
function adjustContent(content, moodTrend, contentVoice):
  moodVectorContent = analyzeMood(content)
  moodVectorTrend = moodTrend
  adjustmentVector = moodVectorTrend - moodVectorContent

  if abs(adjustmentVector) < threshold:
    return content  // No adjustment needed

  adjustedContent = content

  //Adjust Text
  if (adjustmentVector.sentiment > 0):
    adjustedContent.text = rewriteText(adjustedContent.text, “increase positivity”)

  //Adjust Images
  if (adjustmentVector.energy > 0):
      adjustedContent.image = applyFilter(adjustedContent.image, “increase brightness”)

  //Adjust Video
  if (adjustmentVector.pace > 0):
      adjustedContent.video = adjustVideoSpeed(adjustedContent.video, “increase pace”)

  return adjustedContent
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MoodVector`:  A multi-dimensional vector representing emotional and stylistic attributes (e.g., sentiment, energy, complexity, formality).
*   `ContentObject`:  An object containing the content itself (text, images, videos) and metadata.
*   `TrendData`:  A time-series data structure storing mood trends over time.
