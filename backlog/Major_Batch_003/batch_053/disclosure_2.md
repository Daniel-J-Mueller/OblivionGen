## Secure Delegation & Time-Locked Key Rotation with Multi-Party Computation

**Concept:** Extend the pre-signed transaction concept to incorporate multi-party computation (MPC) for generating and safeguarding the modified cryptographic key *before* it's actually needed. Introduce time-locking alongside delegated permission for automated key rotation, adding a layer of security against compromised delegation.

**Specs:**

**1. MPC Key Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Delegation transaction details (first/second user accounts), parameters for key generation (algorithm, key size), threshold value (n) for MPC, list of participating nodes.
*   **Process:** Upon successful delegation, initiate an MPC session. Participating nodes (e.g., a distributed network of trusted hardware security modules or independent servers) each generate a *share* of the modified cryptographic key. Shares are encrypted and distributed to the participating nodes. No single node possesses the complete key.
*   **Output:**  Encrypted key shares distributed to participating nodes.  A "key commitment" transaction is submitted to the distributed ledger, recording the commitment to a new key being generated under MPC.

**2. Time-Locked Key Reveal & Activation:**

*   **Input:** Time-lock expiration timestamp, key commitment transaction hash, encrypted key shares.
*   **Process:**  A smart contract monitors the blockchain for the time-lock expiration. Upon reaching the timestamp:
    *   Participating nodes collaboratively reveal their key shares.
    *   A distributed key reconstruction algorithm combines the shares to reconstruct the complete modified cryptographic key.
    *   The modified cryptographic key is used to sign a transaction exchanging the active key for the first user account.
    *   The signed exchange transaction is submitted to the distributed ledger.
*   **Output:** Active key exchanged for the modified key. 

**3. Revocation Mechanism:**

*   **Process:** A designated revocation authority (potentially requiring a multi-signature scheme) can initiate a revocation transaction *before* the time-lock expires. This transaction permanently destroys the key shares and signals that the delegated permission and key rotation are canceled.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Delegation Contract:** Manages delegation permissions and triggers MPC key generation.
*   **MPC Coordinator:** Orchestrates the MPC session, manages key share distribution, and initiates key reconstruction.
*   **Key Reconstruction Module:**  Implements the distributed key reconstruction algorithm (e.g., Shamir's Secret Sharing).
*   **Time-Lock Contract:** Monitors the blockchain for the time-lock expiration and triggers key reconstruction.
*   **Revocation Authority:** Controls the revocation process.

**Pseudocode (Time-Lock Contract):**

```
function onTimeLockExpired(blockTimestamp):
  if blockTimestamp >= timeLockExpirationTimestamp:
    // Initiate key reconstruction process
    reconstructionResult = MPCCoordinator.reconstructKey()
    if reconstructionResult.success:
      newKey = reconstructionResult.key
      // Sign key exchange transaction using newKey
      exchangeTransaction = signKeyExchangeTransaction(newKey)
      // Submit exchange transaction to blockchain
      submitTransaction(exchangeTransaction)
    else:
      // Handle reconstruction failure (e.g., log error, alert administrator)
      logError("Key reconstruction failed")
```

**Novelty:**  This combines pre-signed transactions with MPC and time-locking.  MPC enhances security by distributing key generation. Time-locking provides a safety net against compromised delegation, allowing automated key rotation within a defined timeframe. The revocation mechanism adds an extra layer of control. This shifts the risk model from trusting a single delegated entity to a distributed, time-bound, and revocable process.
