## Dynamic Challenge Difficulty & AI-Driven Prompt Generation

**Concept:** Expand challenge functionality to include dynamic difficulty adjustment *during* a challenge based on user performance, coupled with AI-generated prompts tailored to individual user interests and skill levels.

**Specs:**

**1. Challenge Difficulty Engine:**

*   **Performance Metrics:** Track key performance indicators (KPIs) during a challenge – for video/image challenges: video length, image complexity (calculated via edge detection/feature analysis), adherence to prompt themes, user engagement metrics (likes, shares, comments). For other challenge types (e.g., fitness, trivia), track completion time, accuracy, steps taken, distance traveled, etc.
*   **Difficulty Levels:** Define a tiered difficulty system (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   Monitor KPI data *in real-time* during challenge execution.
    *   Establish performance thresholds for each difficulty level.
    *   If a user consistently exceeds the thresholds for their current difficulty level, *automatically* increase the difficulty.  Conversely, if a user struggles, *decrease* the difficulty.
    *   Difficulty adjustments should be subtle and non-disruptive, perhaps manifested through minor prompt alterations or time constraints.
    *   Algorithm should adapt based on overall user base data – if many users struggle with a specific difficulty level, adjust thresholds.
*   **User Control:** Provide a setting allowing users to disable dynamic difficulty adjustment if desired.

**2. AI Prompt Generation Module:**

*   **User Interest Profiling:** Analyze user data (social media activity, content liked/shared, past challenge participation) to build a detailed interest profile. Employ NLP and machine learning techniques to extract keywords and topics.
*   **Prompt Database:** Maintain a vast database of challenge prompts, categorized by topic, difficulty, and media type (video, image, text, etc.).
*   **AI Prompt Generator:**
    *   Based on the user’s interest profile, select relevant keywords and topics from the prompt database.
    *   Utilize a generative AI model (e.g., GPT-3 or similar) to create *novel* challenge prompts tailored to the user.
    *   Prompts should be diverse – incorporate different styles (humorous, inspirational, thought-provoking), formats (questions, statements, scenarios), and creative constraints.
    *   Prompts can be dynamically generated during the challenge creation process, ensuring a fresh and engaging experience.
*   **Prompt Filtering & Moderation:** Implement a system to filter out inappropriate or offensive prompts generated by the AI model.
*   **Challenge 'Themes':** Allow users to select broad 'themes' (e.g., "Nature," "Food," "Music," "Technology") to guide AI prompt generation.

**3. System Integration:**

*   **Challenge Creation Interface:**  Integrate AI prompt generation into the existing challenge creation interface. Allow creators to either write their own prompts or generate them using the AI module.
*   **Newsfeed Integration:** Display dynamically adjusted challenges and AI-generated prompts within the user’s newsfeed.
*   **API Access:**  Provide an API allowing third-party developers to integrate the dynamic challenge and AI prompt functionality into their own applications.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment):**

```
function adjustDifficulty(userPerformance, currentDifficulty) {
  if (userPerformance > highThreshold[currentDifficulty]) {
    currentDifficulty = increaseDifficulty(currentDifficulty);
  } else if (userPerformance < lowThreshold[currentDifficulty]) {
    currentDifficulty = decreaseDifficulty(currentDifficulty);
  }
  return currentDifficulty;
}
```

**Pseudocode (AI Prompt Generation):**

```
function generatePrompt(userInterests) {
  keywords = extractKeywords(userInterests);
  prompt = generatePromptFromKeywords(keywords);
  filteredPrompt = filterPrompt(prompt);
  return filteredPrompt;
}
```
