**Adaptive Contextual Embedding for Multi-Modal Input**

**Specification:**

This design extends the byte-level embedding concept to accommodate multi-modal input (text, image, audio) on end-user devices while maintaining low latency and power consumption, especially within end-to-end encrypted environments. The core idea is to create an adaptive embedding space that dynamically adjusts its dimensionality and representation based on the input modality and available computational resources.

**Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Input Handler:** Receives input from various sources (text from messages, images/audio from attachments).
2.  **Modality Encoder:** A suite of lightweight encoders (e.g., a small CNN for images, a spectral analyzer for audio, a byte-level encoder for text â€“ as per the source patent).  Each encoder transforms its respective input into a base embedding.
3.  **Adaptive Embedding Fusion:**  The crucial component.  This module dynamically adjusts the dimensionality of each base embedding and fuses them into a unified embedding space.  It utilizes a learned attention mechanism to prioritize salient features from each modality.
4.  **Resource Monitor:** Tracks device CPU/GPU load, battery level, and network bandwidth.  This data informs the dimensionality reduction strategy.
5.  **Natural Language Understanding Model:** The same as in the source patent, but adapted to accept the unified multi-modal embedding.
6.  **Output & Recommendation Engine:**  Generates recommendations or actions based on the NLU output.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Embedding Fusion):**

```python
def adaptive_embedding_fusion(text_embedding, image_embedding, audio_embedding, resource_monitor):
    # Resource Monitor provides a 'complexity_budget' (0.0 to 1.0)
    complexity_budget = resource_monitor.get_complexity_budget()

    # Calculate target dimensions for each embedding based on the budget
    text_dim = int(128 * complexity_budget)  # Example scaling
    image_dim = int(64 * complexity_budget)
    audio_dim = int(32 * complexity_budget)

    # Apply dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA, autoencoders)
    text_embedding_reduced = reduce_dimensionality(text_embedding, text_dim)
    image_embedding_reduced = reduce_dimensionality(image_embedding, image_dim)
    audio_embedding_reduced = reduce_dimensionality(audio_embedding, audio_dim)

    # Learnable attention weights for each modality
    attention_weights = learn_attention_weights(text_embedding_reduced, image_embedding_reduced, audio_embedding_reduced)

    # Weighted sum of embeddings
    fused_embedding = (attention_weights['text'] * text_embedding_reduced) + \
                     (attention_weights['image'] * image_embedding_reduced) + \
                     (attention_weights['audio'] * audio_embedding_reduced)

    return fused_embedding
```

**Training Data:**

Training will require a dataset of multi-modal inputs paired with desired outputs/recommendations. Data augmentation techniques (e.g., adding noise to images, varying audio pitch) will be used to improve robustness.

**Hardware Considerations:**

The design is intended for mobile devices.  Model quantization and pruning will be employed to minimize model size and computational requirements. The resource monitor needs access to device performance metrics.

**End-to-End Encryption Compatibility:**

The embedding process occurs *before* any data is sent to a server. The NLU model operates entirely on the device. This preserves end-to-end encryption.
