## Modular Eyewear Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback into eyewear temple arms, synchronized with audio or visual cues from the integrated antenna system. This transforms the eyewear into a multi-sensory device, enhancing user experience for navigation, alerts, or immersive entertainment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Haptic Actuator Modules:**

*   **Type:** Micro-linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or eccentric rotating mass (ERM) motors. Selection based on desired intensity and responsiveness.
*   **Quantity:** Minimum of 3 per temple arm, spaced along the length. Allows for directional and localized feedback.
*   **Size:** Maximum dimensions: 8mm x 3mm x 1.5mm. Must fit within the temple arm housing without compromising structural integrity.
*   **Mounting:** Securely fastened using a combination of adhesive and miniature screws to prevent vibration-induced loosening.
*   **Power:** 3.3V DC, controlled by a dedicated PWM driver on the PCB.

**2. Temple Arm Integration:**

*   **Housing:** Temple arm interior designed with modular slots for actuator modules. Slots incorporate vibration damping material (e.g., silicone rubber) to minimize extraneous noise.
*   **Contact Points:** Soft, flexible silicone pads positioned against the user's skin, directly above each actuator. Pads designed to maximize contact area and distribute vibration evenly.
*   **Wiring:** Flexible, high-strand count wires routed internally within the temple arms to connect actuators to the PCB. Wires shielded to prevent electromagnetic interference.

**3. PCB Integration & Control:**

*   **Dedicated Driver:** Integrated PWM driver chip (e.g., DRV8833) on the PCB to control each actuator independently.
*   **Microcontroller Integration:** Microcontroller (integrated with existing radio controller) processes audio/visual cues and translates them into haptic patterns.
*   **Haptic Pattern Library:** Pre-programmed library of haptic patterns corresponding to different alerts, navigation cues, or in-game events. Users can customize patterns via a companion app.
*   **Real-time Processing:** The PCB performs real-time audio analysis (e.g., beat detection, directional sound) to generate dynamic haptic feedback synchronized with the audio stream.

**4. Software & API:**

*   **Companion App:** Mobile app allowing users to customize haptic patterns, adjust intensity levels, and configure trigger events.
*   **Open API:** Publicly accessible API enabling third-party developers to integrate haptic feedback into their apps and services.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Cue Generation):**

```
// Function: generateHapticCue
// Input: cueType (string), intensity (int)
// Output: hapticPattern (array of int)

function generateHapticCue(cueType, intensity) {
  // Define haptic patterns for different cue types
  patterns = {
    "navigation_turn": [100, 0, 0, 0, 100, 0, 0, 0],  // Alternating pulses
    "alert_message": [255, 0, 255, 0, 255, 0],        // Rapid bursts
    "low_battery": [50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50]            // Continuous low-level vibration
  }

  // Get pattern based on cue type
  pattern = patterns[cueType]

  // Adjust intensity
  scaledPattern = pattern.map(value => value * intensity / 255)

  return scaledPattern
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  // Get event from audio/visual stream
  event = getEvent()

  // Generate haptic cue based on event
  hapticPattern = generateHapticCue(event.type, event.intensity)

  // Send haptic pattern to actuators
  sendHapticPattern(hapticPattern)

  // Delay
  delay(50ms)
}
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple vibration alerts. The localized, directional haptic feedback combined with dynamic audio/visual synchronization provides a significantly more immersive and informative user experience. This could revolutionize applications such as AR navigation, gaming, accessibility features for the visually impaired, and discreet communication.
