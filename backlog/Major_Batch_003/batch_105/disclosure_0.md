## Dynamic Codec Selection Based on User Device Capabilities & Network Conditions

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of dynamic codec selection but introduces a real-time, granular approach leveraging user device characteristics *and* network conditions to optimize video quality and bandwidth usage. Instead of pre-determining codec rankings, the system continuously assesses and adjusts the encoding pipeline *during* video playback.

**Components:**

1.  **Client-Side Profiler:** Integrated into the user's client application (web browser, mobile app, smart TV app). Collects:
    *   Device CPU/GPU capabilities (specifically video decoding support – codec availability and hardware acceleration).
    *   Screen resolution and pixel density.
    *   Network bandwidth (real-time measurements – upload and download).
    *   Battery level (mobile devices).
    *   Current application priority (foreground/background).
2.  **Server-Side Orchestrator:**  Central server responsible for:
    *   Maintaining a codec capability database.
    *   Receiving client profiles.
    *   Calculating optimal encoding parameters.
    *   Instructing the encoding pipeline.
3.  **Encoding Pipeline:**  A modular system supporting multiple codecs (H.264, H.265/HEVC, AV1, VVC) and quality levels.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Profiling:** Upon application launch or user session start, the Client-Side Profiler collects device and network information.
2.  **Profile Transmission:** The Client-Side Profiler transmits this information to the Server-Side Orchestrator.
3.  **Codec & Parameter Selection:**  The Server-Side Orchestrator consults its codec database, cross-references it with the client profile, and determines the *optimal* codec and encoding parameters (resolution, bitrate, frame rate, GOP size). Parameters are selected *per-client*, not globally.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** This is the core innovation. The Server-Side Orchestrator *continuously* monitors network conditions (using periodic probes) and device status (via the client). If network bandwidth drops, or device CPU utilization spikes, it dynamically adjusts the encoding pipeline, switching to a lower bitrate or a more efficient codec.  This happens *without interrupting playback*.  
5.  **Feedback Loop:** The client provides feedback to the server on video playback smoothness and quality. The server uses this feedback to refine its codec selection algorithms (machine learning).

**Pseudocode (Server-Side Orchestrator):**

```
function determineOptimalEncoding(clientProfile):
  // 1. Filter available codecs based on client support
  supportedCodecs = filterCodecs(allCodecs, clientProfile.supportedCodecs)

  // 2. Calculate a 'quality score' for each codec
  for codec in supportedCodecs:
    codec.qualityScore = calculateCodecScore(codec, clientProfile)

  // 3. Select the codec with the highest quality score
  bestCodec = selectBestCodec(supportedCodecs)

  // 4. Determine optimal encoding parameters
  parameters = determineEncodingParameters(bestCodec, clientProfile)

  return bestCodec, parameters

function calculateCodecScore(codec, clientProfile):
  compressionEfficiency = codec.compressionRatio
  hardwareAcceleration = clientProfile.hardwareAccelerationSupportForCodec
  networkBandwidth = clientProfile.networkBandwidth

  score = (compressionEfficiency * 0.4) + (hardwareAcceleration * 0.3) + (networkBandwidth * 0.3)
  return score

function determineEncodingParameters(codec, clientProfile):
  // Implement a dynamic bitrate ladder
  baseBitrate = 1000  // kbps
  scalingFactor = clientProfile.networkBandwidth / 5000  // scale to network bandwidth
  bitrate = baseBitrate * scalingFactor

  resolution = determineResolution(clientProfile.screenResolution)
  frameRate = 30

  return bitrate, resolution, frameRate
```

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond static codec selection to *adaptive, per-client* encoding, responding in real-time to changing network and device conditions. The feedback loop allows the system to learn and improve its performance over time.  This minimizes buffering, maximizes video quality, and optimizes battery life for mobile users.  The dynamic bitrate ladder allows for smooth scaling based on network capability.
