## Dynamic Summary ‘Layers’ & Interactive Forecasting

**Concept:** Extend personalized summaries beyond simple content condensation. Introduce ‘layers’ of forecasting and ‘what-if’ scenario generation *within* the summary interface, tailored to user profiles and predicted needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Summary Engine:** Retains the existing functionality - personalized summaries based on user profiles and content analysis.
*   **Forecasting Module:**  Integrated AI model trained on user communication patterns, historical data (content source), and external datasets (news, trends).  Predicts likely future topics/events relevant to the summarized content.
*   **Layered Interface:** Summary presented as a base layer. Users can toggle on/off ‘forecast layers’ revealing predictions:
    *   **Topic Evolution:**  Highlights how key topics are likely to evolve over time (next day, week, month). Visualization could use trend lines, heatmaps, or animated ‘topic clouds’.
    *   **Actionable Insights:**  AI identifies potential actions triggered by summarized content, ranked by probability/impact. E.g., "Based on this project update, a meeting with [person] is 75% likely to be needed next week."
    *   **‘What-If’ Scenarios:**  Users can input hypothetical situations (e.g., "What if the competitor announces a new product?") to see how predicted outcomes shift.  AI dynamically re-calculates forecasts.
*   **Interactive Elements:**
    *   **Scenario Builder:** Drag-and-drop interface for creating custom scenarios.
    *   **Confidence Levels:**  Display AI confidence scores for each prediction.
    *   **Feedback Loop:**  User actions (e.g., scheduling a meeting based on a prediction) feed back into the AI model to improve accuracy.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User communication data (emails, messages, etc.)
    *   Content source data (project documents, newsfeeds, etc.)
    *   External APIs (news, weather, financial data, etc.)
*   **Output Formats:** Text, Audio, Visual (interactive dashboards, charts, graphs).

**Pseudocode (Scenario Builder):**

```
function buildScenario(baseForecast, scenarioInput) {
  // scenarioInput: { variable: "competitor_product", value: "new_launch", timeframe: "next_week" }
  modifiedForecast = baseForecast.copy()

  // Apply scenario input to relevant AI models
  impactAssessment = AI_Model_Impact.predict(modifiedForecast, scenarioInput)

  // Update forecast layers based on impact assessment
  modifiedForecast.topic_evolution = impactAssessment.topic_evolution
  modifiedForecast.actionable_insights = impactAssessment.actionable_insights

  return modifiedForecast
}
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server for AI model training/inference.
*   Scalable database for storing user data and historical content.
*   Real-time data ingestion pipeline.
*   Web/mobile app for user interface.
*   API integrations with external data sources.
