## Dynamic Ambient Projection System

**Concept:** Extending the idea of distance-based content adjustment to encompass the *entire* surrounding environment, not just a display. This creates immersive, reactive ambient experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-emitter array:  A network of low-power, wide-angle pico-projectors (minimum 4, ideally 8-12) capable of projecting onto surfaces in a room.  Projectors must support keystone correction and brightness/color temperature adjustment.
    *   Depth Sensor Array: Complementary to the projector array. LiDAR, time-of-flight cameras, or structured light sensors to create a real-time 3D map of the room, including detected individuals and objects. Minimum 3 sensors for broad coverage.
    *   Processing Unit: High-performance embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson series) capable of real-time 3D rendering, depth data processing, and projector control.
    *   Microphones: Array of microphones for audio input to influence ambient projections.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Environmental Mapping Module:**  Processes data from the depth sensor array to create a dynamic 3D model of the room. Object and individual identification/tracking.
    *   **Projection Mapping Engine:**  Renders ambient visuals onto the 3D model, accounting for surface normals, textures, and obstructions. Utilizes procedural generation to create diverse and evolving visuals.
    *   **Behavioral Logic Module:**  Defines rules for how ambient projections respond to:
        *   **Proximity:** Adjusts projection intensity, color temperature, and content complexity based on the distance of individuals to projectors/surfaces.
        *   **Movement:** Tracks movement within the room and generates reactive projection effects (e.g., light trails, flowing patterns).
        *   **Audio:** Analyzes audio input (speech, music) and generates visually corresponding effects (e.g., pulsating light, color shifts).
        *   **Time of Day:** Adjusts ambient themes based on time of day (e.g., warm colors in the morning, cool colors at night).
        *   **User Preferences:** Allows users to customize ambient themes and behavioral rules through a user interface.
    *   **Content Library:** A curated collection of ambient visuals (patterns, textures, animations) and soundscapes.
    *   **API:** External API to allow integration with other smart home devices and services.

**Pseudocode (Behavioral Logic - Proximity Effect):**

```
function updateProjection(individual, distance):
  if distance < 2 meters:
    intensity = 100%
    complexity = high
    colorTemperature = warm
  else if distance < 5 meters:
    intensity = 60%
    complexity = medium
    colorTemperature = neutral
  else:
    intensity = 20%
    complexity = low
    colorTemperature = cool

  applyProjectionSettings(individual, intensity, complexity, colorTemperature)
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Enhanced Home Entertainment:** Create immersive ambient experiences during movie nights or gaming sessions.
*   **Dynamic Workspace:** Adjust ambient lighting and visuals to promote focus and creativity.
*   **Retail Environments:**  Attract customers and create memorable shopping experiences.
*   **Healthcare Settings:**  Create calming and therapeutic environments for patients.

**Novelty:** This system differentiates itself from display-centric distance-based adjustments by extending the experience to the *entire* physical environment. It moves beyond simply altering content *on* a screen and instead *transforms* the space itself into an interactive and responsive ambient environment.
