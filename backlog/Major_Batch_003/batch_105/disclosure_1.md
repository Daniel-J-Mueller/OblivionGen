**Adaptive Thermal Mapping with Bio-Inspired Cooling**

**Concept:** Extend the thermal testing beyond simple property determination to create dynamic thermal maps of a device *while* simulating complex, real-world workloads. Incorporate a bio-inspired cooling system to actively manage heat distribution during testing, enabling assessment of performance under extreme and varied thermal conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Test Vehicle Enhancement:** Integrate an array of microfluidic channels within the heat spreader. These channels will function as the core of the bio-inspired cooling system.
*   **Microfluidic System:** Utilize a non-conductive dielectric fluid within the microfluidic channels. The fluid will be circulated by a miniature pump, controlled by the processor.
*   **Bio-Inspiration:** Model the microfluidic circulation after the vascular system of mammals. Implement algorithms to dynamically adjust flow rates to specific regions of the heat spreader based on temperature readings from an expanded array of thermal sensors (at least 32 sensors, evenly distributed).
*   **Thermal Sensor Array:** Increase the density of thermal sensors under the heat spreader. Each sensor should have a resolution of 0.1°C or better.
*   **Workload Profiles:** Implement a library of workload profiles that mimic realistic application usage. These profiles will control both the heating element *and* a simulated processing load on the target device. Include profiles for sustained high loads, burst workloads, and idle states.
*   **Adaptive Cooling Algorithm:**
    *   Input: Temperature readings from the sensor array, current workload profile.
    *   Process:
        1.  Calculate temperature gradients across the heat spreader.
        2.  Identify 'hot spots' exceeding a predefined threshold.
        3.  Increase fluid flow to the corresponding regions of the microfluidic channels.
        4.  Adjust flow rates to maintain a target temperature gradient across the heat spreader.
        5.  Continuously monitor and refine flow rates based on real-time temperature readings.
*   **Mapping Software:** Develop software to visualize the thermal map of the device during testing. The software should display temperature distributions, hot spots, and cooling efficiency.
*   **Data Logging:** Log all relevant data, including heating element power output, temperature readings, fluid flow rates, and workload profiles.
*   **Pseudocode for Adaptive Cooling:**

```
// Variables
float[] tempReadings; // Array of temperature readings from sensors
float targetGradient; // Desired temperature gradient
float flowRateMultiplier; // Adjustable constant for flow rate scaling
float[] flowRates; // Array of flow rates for each microfluidic channel

// Function: AdjustFlowRates()
function AdjustFlowRates() {
  // Calculate temperature gradient
  float gradient = max(tempReadings) - min(tempReadings);

  // Calculate error
  float error = gradient - targetGradient;

  // Adjust flow rates proportionally to error
  for (int i = 0; i < flowRates.length; i++) {
    flowRates[i] += error * flowRateMultiplier;
    // Clamp flow rates to a valid range
    flowRates[i] = constrain(flowRates[i], minFlowRate, maxFlowRate);
  }

  // Send flow rate commands to the microfluidic pump
  SendPumpCommands(flowRates);
}
```

*   **Materials:** Heat spreader – Copper or aluminum. Microfluidic channels – Polymer with high thermal conductivity. Fluid – Dielectric fluid with high heat capacity.
*   **Testing Procedure:**
    1.  Connect the test vehicle to the target device.
    2.  Select a workload profile.
    3.  Initiate the adaptive cooling algorithm.
    4.  Monitor the thermal map and data logs.
    5.  Repeat steps 2-4 for different workload profiles.
