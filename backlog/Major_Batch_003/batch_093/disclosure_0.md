## Dynamic Group Persona Assignment & Contextual Call Routing

**Concept:** Extend the multi-person calling functionality by dynamically assigning personas to each participant *within* the group call, tailoring the assistant's interaction and call routing based on pre-defined or real-time contextual data.

**Specifications:**

**1. Persona Database & Definition:**

*   **Data Structure:** A database storing persona definitions. Each persona includes:
    *   `persona_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `name`: Human-readable persona name (e.g., "Project Lead", "Technical Support", "Family Member").
    *   `voice_profile`: Parameters for voice modification (pitch, tone, speed, accent).
    *   `communication_style`:  Rules governing language complexity, formality, and preferred phrasing. (e.g. terse, detailed, enthusiastic, calm).
    *   `task_priorities`:  List of tasks the persona is likely to handle during the call.
    *   `access_level`: Defines what information is accessible to the persona via the assistant.
    *   `trigger_keywords`:  List of keywords that activate specific responses or actions.
*   **Population:** Persona database populated with pre-defined roles, customizable by the user.  Integration with user profiles and organizational data to suggest appropriate personas.

**2.  Contextual Data Integration:**

*   **Data Sources:** Real-time data streams integrated into the system:
    *   Calendar events (meeting purpose, attendees).
    *   User location (for emergency calls or location-based services).
    *   Application/device usage (to infer user intent).
    *   Sentiment analysis of user communication (email, chat).
    *   CRM/ERP data (customer history, support tickets).
*   **Context Engine:**  A module that fuses data from multiple sources to create a contextual profile for each call participant.

**3. Dynamic Persona Assignment Logic:**

*   **Assignment Algorithm:** Based on the contextual profile, the system automatically assigns a persona to each participant.
    *   Prioritize pre-defined roles (e.g., the meeting organizer is assigned “Project Lead”).
    *   Use machine learning to predict the most appropriate persona based on historical data and real-time context.
    *   Allow manual override by the call initiator.
*   **Persona Activation:** Upon assignment, the assistant:
    *   Modifies the participant’s voice using the `voice_profile`.
    *   Adjusts its communication style based on the `communication_style`.

**4.  Contextual Call Routing & Assistant Behavior:**

*   **Intelligent Routing:** Call routing based on assigned personas.
    *   Direct questions related to technical issues to the “Technical Support” persona.
    *   Escalate critical issues to the “Project Lead” persona.
*   **Personalized Assistant Responses:** The assistant’s responses tailored to each persona.
    *   Provide concise technical instructions to the “Technical Support” persona.
    *   Offer high-level summaries to the “Project Lead” persona.
*   **Automated Task Delegation:** The assistant can automatically delegate tasks to specific personas based on their `task_priorities`.

**Pseudocode (Persona Assignment):**

```
function assign_persona(user_context, meeting_context):
  // Determine default persona based on meeting context
  default_persona = get_default_persona(meeting_context)

  // Analyze user context to refine persona selection
  user_persona = analyze_user_context(user_context)

  // Combine default and user-specific personas
  final_persona = merge_personas(default_persona, user_persona)

  return final_persona

function analyze_user_context(user_context):
  // Analyze user data (location, app usage, communication history)
  // Predict user's role/intent based on data analysis
  // Return suggested persona
```

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   Requires a robust natural language understanding (NLU) module.
*   Voice modification technology for real-time voice manipulation.
*   Machine learning models for persona prediction.
*   Integration with calendar, CRM, and other relevant data sources.
*   Scalable infrastructure to handle multiple concurrent calls and persona assignments.
