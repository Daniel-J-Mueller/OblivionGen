## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Music Recommendation

**Concept:** Expand beyond feature-based music/video matching to incorporate *emotional* resonance. The current system relies on embeddings representing content features. This proposal introduces a layer that dynamically maps emotional arcs *within* both video and music, then matches based on those arcs, not just static features.

**Specs:**

1.  **Emotional Arc Extraction Module:**
    *   **Input:** Video content (frames/audio), Music content (audio).
    *   **Process:**
        *   Utilize pre-trained emotion recognition models (facial expression analysis for video, audio sentiment analysis for music) *over time*.  Crucially, this isnâ€™t a single emotion *per* video/song, but a *trajectory* of emotional changes.
        *   Represent emotional arcs as time-series data.  Normalize emotional intensity scales across models for comparability.
        *   Implement a smoothing filter (e.g., moving average) on the time-series data to reduce noise and highlight dominant emotional trends.
    *   **Output:**  A time-series representation of emotional intensity for key emotions (e.g., joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutrality) for both video and music.

2.  **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Module:**
    *   **Input:** Emotional time-series data from video and music.
    *   **Process:** Apply DTW to align the emotional arcs. DTW finds the optimal alignment between two time series that may vary in speed or length.  This accounts for different pacing in videos and music.
    *   **Cost Function:** Customize the DTW cost function to prioritize matching specific emotional transitions (e.g., a rapid shift from sadness to joy). Weights can be assigned to different emotional pairs.
    *   **Output:** A similarity score representing the alignment quality of the emotional arcs.

3.  **Hybrid Recommendation Engine:**
    *   **Input:**  Video embedding (from existing system), Music embeddings (from existing system), DTW similarity score.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Combine the existing embedding-based similarity score with the DTW score using a weighted average. The weights can be dynamically adjusted based on user preferences or content type.
        *   Rank music content based on the combined score.
    *   **Output:** Ranked list of music recommendations.

4. **User Feedback Loop:**
    * **Process:**  Track user engagement (skips, replays, completion rate) with recommended music.  Use this data to refine the weighting of the embedding-based score vs. the DTW score, and to adjust the weights within the DTW cost function.
    * **Data Points:** Timestamped user actions linked to specific recommendations.
    * **Algorithm:** Reinforcement learning to optimize weighting parameters.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
function recommend_music(video_embedding, music_embeddings):
  embedding_similarity_scores = calculate_embedding_similarity(video_embedding, music_embeddings)
  emotional_arcs = extract_emotional_arcs(video_embedding, music_embeddings)
  dtw_score = dynamic_time_warping(emotional_arcs)
  combined_score = (weight_embedding * embedding_similarity_scores) + (weight_dtw * dtw_score)
  ranked_music = sort_music_by_score(combined_score)
  return ranked_music
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond static feature matching to model and match the *emotional flow* of content. Existing systems might recommend music that fits the *genre* or *visual style* of a video. This system aims to recommend music that *feels* right, based on the emotional arc of the video.  DTW allows for flexible alignment of emotional timelines, even if the pacing differs. The reinforcement learning loop allows the system to personalize recommendations based on user emotional response.
