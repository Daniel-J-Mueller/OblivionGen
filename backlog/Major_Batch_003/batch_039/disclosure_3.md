## Dynamic Attention Sparsification with Learned Granularity

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on reducing attention matrix size through decomposition. This builds on that by introducing dynamic sparsification *within* the attention matrix itself, guided by a learned granularity system. Instead of a uniform reduction, we tailor the sparsity to the importance of specific input token relationships *and* the level of detail needed for accurate translation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Granularity Levels:** Define a set of granularity levels (e.g., coarse, medium, fine). Each level represents a different degree of attention detail. Coarse might represent attention focused on broad semantic concepts, while fine captures nuanced relationships.
2.  **Granularity Prediction Network (GPN):** Introduce a small neural network (GPN) that takes as input the encoder hidden state for a given input token *and* the current decoder hidden state. The GPN outputs a probability distribution over the defined granularity levels. This predicts the appropriate granularity for *that specific token pair*.
3.  **Attention Mask Generation:** Based on the GPN output, a corresponding attention mask is created.
    *   **Coarse:** A highly sparse mask, retaining only the strongest attention weights.
    *   **Medium:** A moderately sparse mask, retaining more detail than coarse.
    *   **Fine:** A dense mask, retaining most attention weights (possibly with minimal thresholding).
4.  **Dynamic Attention Application:** The attention mechanism applies the generated mask to the attention weights *before* weighting the context vector. This ensures that only relevant attention signals are used.
5.  **Training Signal:** The GPN is trained jointly with the translation model using the standard translation loss. This allows it to learn the optimal granularity levels for different input token pairs.
6.  **Implementation Notes:**
    *   The GPN could be a simple feedforward network or a more complex recurrent network.
    *   The attention mask could be implemented using boolean masking or other efficient techniques.
    *   A regularization term could be added to the loss function to encourage sparsity in the attention masks.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Inside the translation model's decode step:

# 1. Get encoder hidden states and decoder hidden state
encoder_hidden = #...
decoder_hidden = #...

# 2. Predict granularity level using GPN
granularity_probs = GPN(encoder_hidden, decoder_hidden)
granularity_level = sample_from_distribution(granularity_probs) #e.g., using argmax or sampling

# 3. Generate attention mask based on granularity level
attention_mask = generate_mask(granularity_level) #Implementation details will vary

# 4. Apply attention mask to attention weights
attention_weights = attention_weights * attention_mask #Element-wise multiplication

# 5. Continue with weighted context vector calculation as usual
# ...
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Translation Quality:** By focusing attention on the most relevant information, we can improve the accuracy and fluency of the translation.
*   **Reduced Computational Cost:** By selectively sparsifying the attention matrix, we can reduce the computational cost of the translation process.
*   **Enhanced Model Interpretability:** The granularity levels can provide insights into the model's attention patterns.
