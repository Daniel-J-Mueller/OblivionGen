**Personalized "Ambient Awareness" System - Extending Private Space Beyond the App**

**Concept:** The core idea is to extend the "private space" concept beyond the application interface itself, creating a subtle, personalized ambient awareness system that reflects the status and activities of the connected user *in the physical world*. This leverages smart home integration and wearable technology.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Smart Home Hub (compatible with major protocols: Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi).
    *   Smart Lighting System (color and brightness control).
    *   Wearable Device (smartwatch or fitness tracker with haptic feedback and potentially ambient light emission).
*   **Software Components:**
    *   API Integration: Secure API connections to the social application, smart home hub, and wearable device.
    *   "Mood Mapping" Engine: Algorithm that maps user activity within the private space (chat tone, photo sharing, calendar events) to “mood” states (e.g., “relaxed,” “excited,” “thinking,” “missing you”).  This is *not* sentiment analysis of text, but a probabilistic mapping based on *patterns* of interaction within the private space.
    *   Ambient Control Module: Translates mood states into specific ambient adjustments.
    *   Wearable Notification Module:  Provides subtle haptic feedback or ambient light signals on the wearable device based on activity within the private space.

**Functionality:**

1.  **Mood State Detection:** The "Mood Mapping" engine constantly analyzes activity within the private space. For instance:
    *   Frequent photo sharing + positive chat tone = "Excited"
    *   Calendar event "Date Night" + chat about preparations = “Anticipatory”
    *   Long periods of inactivity + melancholic chat = “Missing You”
2.  **Ambient Adjustments:**  Based on the detected mood state, the system adjusts the physical environment:
    *   **"Excited":**  Dynamic color lighting (fast cycling through warm colors), upbeat music integration (if available on smart speaker).
    *   **"Anticipatory":**  Subtle warm lighting, calming ambient sounds.
    *   **"Missing You":**  Soft, cool blue lighting, slow-tempo ambient music.  Potentially display a shared photo on a smart display.
    *   **"Relaxed":** Dim, warm lighting, nature sounds.
3.  **Wearable Notifications:**
    *   A gentle pulse on the smartwatch when the other user sends a message.
    *   A slow, rhythmic light pulse on the wearable when the other user is actively viewing shared photos.
    *   A different haptic pattern for different types of notifications (e.g., a short buzz for chat, a long pulse for calendar reminders).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop

while (true) {

    // Get Activity Data from Private Space
    activityData = getPrivateSpaceActivity();

    // Map Activity to Mood State
    moodState = mapActivityToMood(activityData);

    // Adjust Ambient Lighting
    setAmbientLighting(moodState);

    // Adjust Ambient Sound
    setAmbientSound(moodState);

    // Send Wearable Notification
    sendWearableNotification(moodState);

    sleep(5); // Check every 5 seconds
}

function mapActivityToMood(activityData) {
    // Implement mood mapping logic based on activity data
    // (e.g., frequent photo sharing + positive chat tone = "Excited")
    // This function would likely use a probabilistic model or rule-based system
    // to determine the most likely mood state
    return moodState;
}

function setAmbientLighting(moodState) {
    // Control smart lighting system to adjust color and brightness
    // based on the mood state
}

function setAmbientSound(moodState) {
    // Control smart speaker or sound system to play ambient sounds
    // based on the mood state
}

function sendWearableNotification(moodState) {
    // Send haptic feedback or light signal to wearable device
    // based on the mood state
}
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   **Scent Integration:**  Use smart scent diffusers to release appropriate scents based on mood.
*   **Temperature Control:**  Adjust smart thermostat settings to create a more comfortable atmosphere.
*   **Personalized "Ambient Themes":** Allow users to create custom "ambient themes" that combine lighting, sound, scent, and temperature settings.
