## Adaptive Sparsity Acceleration with Dynamic Re-weighting

**Concept:** Expand on the pipelined convolution architecture by introducing adaptive sparsity and dynamic re-weighting of connections *during* the convolution process, leveraging the parallel processing capabilities of the channel and dot product units. This isn't just about static pruning; it's about *real-time* adaptation based on input data.

**Specification:**

1.  **Sparsity Mask Generation Unit (SMGU):** Placed *before* the hardware channel convolution processor unit.
    *   Input: Convolution data matrix.
    *   Function: Analyzes the input data matrix and generates a dynamic sparsity mask. The mask isn't fixed; it changes with each input.  Algorithm:  Calculate an activation score for each data element. Elements falling below a dynamically adjusted threshold (based on overall input energy/variance) are masked.
    *   Output: Dynamic sparsity mask (boolean matrix).

2.  **Masked Channel Convolution Unit (MCCU):** Replaces the standard hardware channel convolution processor unit.
    *   Input: Convolution data matrix, dynamic sparsity mask, depthwise convolution weight matrices.
    *   Function:  Performs depthwise convolution, but *only* on unmasked elements. This requires modifications to the multiplication and summation operations within the unit. Zero-valued multiplications are skipped.
    *   Output: Partially convolved result (sparse).

3.  **Re-weighting Unit (RWU):**  Placed between the MCCU and the hardware dot product processor unit.
    *   Input: Sparse partial convolution result, Depthwise convolution weight matrices.
    *   Function:  Identifies zeroed connections. Dynamically re-weights remaining connections to compensate for the loss of information from the masked elements. This could involve scaling the activations or adjusting the weights themselves, based on a learned compensation strategy.  Algorithm:  For each channel, calculate the sum of weights for active connections. Distribute this sum proportionally across the active connections in that channel.
    *   Output: Re-weighted partial convolution result.

4.  **Modified Dot Product Unit (MDPU):** Replaces the standard hardware dot product processor unit.
    *   Input: Re-weighted partial convolution result, pointwise weight matrices.
    *   Function: Performs pointwise convolution on the re-weighted result. Modified to efficiently handle potentially varying numbers of active connections per channel, and to incorporate the re-weighting factors.
    *   Output: Separable convolution results.

**Pseudocode (RWU):**

```
function reweight(partial_result, weights):
  for channel in channels:
    active_weights = []
    for i in range(len(weights[channel])):
      if partial_result[channel][i] != 0:
        active_weights.append(weights[channel][i])

    total_weight = sum(active_weights)

    if total_weight > 0:  # Avoid division by zero
      for i in range(len(partial_result[channel])):
        if partial_result[channel][i] != 0:
          partial_result[channel][i] *= (total_weight / len(active_weights)) #Scale by average active weight

  return partial_result
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   MCCU: Requires additional logic to handle masked operations and conditional multiplications.
*   RWU: Can be implemented using a small array of multipliers and adders, or through lookup tables for faster compensation.
*   SMGU: Benefit from dedicated hardware to accelerate the activation score calculation and thresholding.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced computational cost due to sparsity.
*   Improved energy efficiency.
*   Enhanced model robustness by dynamically adapting to input data.
*   Ability to potentially 'discover' irrelevant connections in the network during inference.
