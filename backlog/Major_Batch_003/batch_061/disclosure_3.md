## Session-Aware Data Sharding with Predictive Consistency

**Concept:** Extend session consistency beyond simple read/write verification to *proactively* shard data based on predicted session access patterns, guaranteeing localized consistency and minimizing cross-server communication.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Access Profiler (PAP):**

*   **Input:** Session-level user token (from provided patent), client request logs, historical access patterns (anonymized & aggregated).
*   **Function:** PAP analyzes session activity to *predict* future data access. This isn’t just “what data has this session touched,” but “what data is this session *likely* to touch next?” 
*   **Output:** Predicted Data Access Map (PDAM): A probabilistic map indicating which data shards are likely to be accessed during the remainder of the session.  Probability scores assigned to each shard.

**2. Dynamic Shard Allocation (DSA):**

*   **Input:** PDAM, available data shards, server load information.
*   **Function:** DSA dynamically allocates (or pre-allocates) predicted data shards to the server(s) currently handling the session.  Prioritizes shards with high probability scores. Utilizes a Least Loaded First (LLF) allocation strategy.
*   **Output:** Shard Allocation Table (SAT): Records which shards are allocated to which server for the duration of the session (or a defined period).

**3. Session-Local Data Access:**

*   **Function:**  All subsequent data requests from the session are routed *directly* to the server(s) identified in the SAT. The system checks SAT before attempting to read/write data. If data is not found on the allocated server, the request falls back to standard distributed data access procedures.
*   **Optimization:**  For write requests, data is mirrored across multiple servers *after* the primary write to the allocated server, ensuring high availability and data durability.

**4. Consistency Verification & Shard Release:**

*   **Function:** Upon session expiration or a significant change in predicted access patterns (detected by PAP), the DSA releases the allocated shards, making them available for other sessions.  A consistency check verifies that all data written during the session is consistent across all replicas.
*   **Algorithm:**  Vector Clock comparison to confirm write order.

**Pseudocode (Simplified DSA):**

```
function allocateShards(sessionToken, pdam):
  servers = getAvailableServers()
  sortedShards = sortShardsByProbability(pdam)
  allocationTable = empty table

  for shard in sortedShards:
    server = findLeastLoadedServer(servers)
    allocateShard(shard, server)
    allocationTable[shard] = server
    updateServerLoad(server)

  return allocationTable

function findLeastLoadedServer(servers):
  // Implement logic to determine server load (CPU, memory, network)
  // Return the server with the lowest load
  ...
```

**Novelty:**

This approach goes beyond verifying consistency *after* access to *proactively* optimizing data placement based on anticipated session behavior. This drastically reduces latency, minimizes cross-server communication, and enhances overall system performance. The PAP and DSA components introduce a predictive element to session consistency, distinguishing it from purely reactive solutions.
