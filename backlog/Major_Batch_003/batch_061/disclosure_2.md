## Dynamic Contextual Itinerary Generation

**Concept:** Extend recommendation generation beyond static lists to proactively construct and refine personalized itineraries based on user posts, comments, and real-time location data. This goes beyond simply *suggesting* places; it builds a potential plan, adapts it based on user interaction, and offers just-in-time information.

**Specs:**

*   **Module:** Itinerary Builder (IB)
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User Post Text (from social network, as per patent)
    *   Associated Comments (prior and new, as per patent)
    *   Object References (extracted from posts/comments - places, events, products etc.)
    *   User Location (GPS, WiFi, IP-based)
    *   Real-time Data Feeds (traffic, weather, event schedules, business operating hours)
    *   User Preferences (explicitly stated or inferred from social activity)
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Intent Recognition:** Analyze user posts and comments to identify travel intent (e.g., “Looking for good Italian restaurants in Rome,” “Anyone been to the Uffizi Gallery recently?”).
    2.  **Object Clustering:** Group object references (restaurants, attractions, etc.) by proximity and thematic relevance.
    3.  **Route Optimization:** Generate potential routes connecting clustered objects, factoring in user location, time of day, and real-time conditions.
    4.  **Itinerary Scoring:** Assign scores to itineraries based on user preferences, object ratings, route efficiency, and real-time data. (e.g. prioritize “family friendly” attractions for a user with children).
    5.  **Dynamic Refinement:**
        *   Monitor user interactions with itinerary suggestions (e.g., clicks, saves, shares).
        *   Adjust itinerary scores and routes based on user feedback.
        *   Incorporate new object references from ongoing comments.
        *   Proactively suggest alternative options if real-time conditions change (e.g., a restaurant is unexpectedly closed).
*   **Output:**
    *   Interactive Itinerary Map: A visual representation of the proposed route with clickable points of interest.
    *   Estimated Travel Times and Costs: Accurate projections based on current conditions.
    *   Real-time Notifications: Alerts about potential delays, closures, or nearby points of interest.
    *   Personalized Recommendations: Suggestions for activities or restaurants along the route based on user preferences.
    *   Itinerary Sharing: Allow users to share their itineraries with friends or family.

**Pseudocode (IB Module):**

```
function buildItinerary(userPost, userLocation, userPreferences):
  objectReferences = extractObjects(userPost)
  clusteredObjects = clusterObjects(objectReferences, userLocation)
  potentialRoutes = generateRoutes(clusteredObjects)
  scoredRoutes = scoreRoutes(potentialRoutes, userPreferences)
  bestRoute = selectBestRoute(scoredRoutes)
  displayRoute(bestRoute)

function monitorUserActivity(route, userInteractions):
  updateRouteScore(route, userInteractions)
  suggestAlternatives(route, userInteractions)
  notifyUser(route, realTimeData)
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Gamification:** Reward users for contributing to itineraries (e.g., earning points for suggesting popular places).
*   **Augmented Reality:** Overlay itinerary information onto the user’s real-world view using their smartphone camera.
*   **Integration with Travel Services:** Allow users to book flights, hotels, and activities directly from the itinerary map.
*   **Privacy Controls:** Allow users to control how their location data is used and shared.
