## Dynamic Wavelength Shifting Waveguide Display

**Concept:** A display system utilizing a single waveguide, but dynamically shifting the emission wavelength of each monochromatic emitter array *before* entry into the waveguide. This allows for time-multiplexed color emission, potentially simplifying waveguide complexity and improving efficiency.

**Specs:**

*   **Emitter Arrays:** Three or more monochromatic emitter arrays (Red, Green, Blue, and potentially additional colors like Cyan, Magenta, Yellow). Each array comprises micro-LEDs or similar high-brightness emitters.
*   **Wavelength Shifters:** Each emitter array is coupled to a tunable wavelength shifter. These shifters could utilize micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) gratings, acousto-optic modulators, or similar technologies to precisely adjust the emission wavelength.  The shift range should be sufficient to create distinct, separable wavelengths within the visible spectrum, but not so broad as to cause significant spectral broadening. Target shift range: +/- 10nm around the peak emission wavelength.
*   **Waveguide:** A single, highly transmissive waveguide optimized for the shifted wavelengths.  Material: Barium Lanthanum Silicate (BLS) or similar high refractive index material. Waveguide geometry:  Planar waveguide with integrated micro-mirrors or diffractive optical elements for beam steering.
*   **Timing/Control System:** A high-speed timing and control system to synchronize the wavelength shifting and emitter activation. This system determines the duration and order of color emission for each frame. Target refresh rate: 120Hz or higher.
*   **Micro-Mirror/DOE Configuration:** A configurable array of micro-mirrors or diffractive optical elements (DOEs) integrated into the waveguide. These elements direct the emitted light from each wavelength-shifted emitter array to specific regions of the user's field of view. They can be dynamically adjusted to create a high-resolution image.
*   **Emission Sequence:**  The timing system cycles through each color emitter array, activating it and shifting its wavelength.  Light from each color is then directed to the appropriate region of the waveguide. This creates a time-multiplexed color image. The frame is built up color by color, utilizing persistence of vision to create the impression of a full-color display.
*   **Waveguide Coating:** The entire internal surface of the waveguide is coated with a material which minimizes reflections of all shifted wavelengths.
*   **Calibration System:** Automated calibration of wavelength shifters and the micro-mirror/DOE array is required.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Define color arrays and wavelengths
ColorArray = [Red, Green, Blue];
Wavelengths = [630nm, 520nm, 450nm];

// Define frame parameters
FrameRate = 120 Hz;
FrameDuration = 1/FrameRate;
ColorDuration = FrameDuration/len(ColorArray);

// Main Loop
while (displayOn):

    for (color in ColorArray):

        // Activate wavelength shifter for current color
        setWavelength(color, Wavelengths[colorIndex]);

        // Activate emitter array for current color
        activateEmitterArray(color);

        // Direct light to waveguide
        directLight(color, waveguide);

        // Delay for color duration
        delay(ColorDuration);

        // Deactivate emitter array
        deactivateEmitterArray(color);

    // End of Frame
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   Simplified Waveguide: Reduces complexity by using a single waveguide for all colors.
*   Higher Efficiency: Potential for increased efficiency by minimizing optical losses.
*   Compact Design: Could enable smaller and lighter display devices.
*   Dynamic Color Control: Offers precise control over color reproduction.
