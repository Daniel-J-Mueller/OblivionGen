## Adaptive Contextual Snippet Generation for Meetings

**Concept:** Extend the existing application-sharing prediction model to *proactively* generate and surface short, relevant “snippets” of content from identified applications *before* the user initiates sharing.  Instead of just predicting *what* the user might share, anticipate *what part* of it is most relevant to the current meeting context.

**Specifications:**

**1. Snippet Generation Module:**

*   **Input:**  Application list (identified as in the base patent), Current Meeting Metadata (title, attendees, transcript snippets if available – utilizing real-time speech-to-text), User Profile (as in base patent), Application Content (accessed via API if possible, otherwise via screen capture – prioritized API access).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Relevance Scoring:** Employ a separate, fine-tuned LLM (Large Language Model) trained on paired data: (Application Content Segment, Meeting Context) -> Relevance Score.  Training data can be synthetic (generated using LLMs) and augmented with real-world usage data.
    *   **Snippet Extraction:** Identify high-relevance content segments (snippets) within each application. Snippets should be short (e.g., image crops, code blocks under 20 lines, text excerpts under 100 words) and visually/textually coherent.
    *   **Snippet Prioritization:** Combine LLM relevance score with existing application sharing prediction score. Weighting can be adjusted based on A/B testing.
*   **Output:** Ranked list of content snippets (image/text/code) per application.

**2. User Interface Integration:**

*   **Snippet Preview Panel:** Display a dedicated panel within the meeting application UI.  This panel dynamically updates based on identified applications and meeting context.
*   **Visual Representation:** Snippets are presented as thumbnails or short text previews.  Application icon and title are clearly displayed.
*   **Actionable Snippets:**  Each snippet is clickable. Clicking initiates a "share" action, automatically presenting the user with options (e.g., "Share this snippet," "Share entire application with this snippet highlighted").
*   **Adaptive Layout:**  The panel automatically adjusts to available screen space, prioritizing the most relevant snippets.

**3. Model Training & Updates:**

*   **Initial Training Data:** Synthetic data generation using LLMs, paired with manually curated examples.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Implement a reinforcement learning loop. Reward signals are based on user interactions (snippet clicks, snippet shares, time spent viewing snippets).
*   **Federated Learning:** Train the model across multiple user devices to improve personalization without compromising user privacy.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Monitor snippet click-through rates and share rates to identify areas for model improvement.

**4.  Technical Considerations:**

*   **API Integration:** Prioritize applications with well-documented APIs to access content programmatically.
*   **Screen Capture Fallback:** Implement screen capture as a fallback mechanism for applications without APIs. Optimize screen capture performance to minimize resource usage.
*   **Privacy & Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to application content.
*   **Resource Management:** Optimize the system to minimize CPU and memory usage.  Use caching and lazy loading techniques.



**Pseudocode (Snippet Generation Module):**

```
function generate_snippets(application_list, meeting_context, user_profile):
  snippet_list = []
  for application in application_list:
    application_content = get_application_content(application) //API or screenshot
    relevant_segments = extract_relevant_segments(application_content, meeting_context, user_profile) //LLM based, returns list of text/image/code snippets
    scored_segments = score_segments(relevant_segments, meeting_context, user_profile) //LLM and sharing score combination
    snippet_list.append(scored_segments)
  return snippet_list
```
