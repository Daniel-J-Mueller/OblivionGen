## Dynamic Content Stitching for Personalized Video Previews

**Concept:** Extend the video quality prediction system to dynamically generate personalized video previews (akin to "trailers") based on predicted viewer preferences *before* the user begins watching. This moves beyond simply categorizing existing videos to *creating* content tailored to anticipated engagement.

**Specs:**

1.  **Preference Profile Generation:**
    *   Collect user interaction data (watch time, likes, shares, comments, search history) across all available platforms (social networks, streaming services – requires API access/data partnerships).
    *   Employ a multi-modal embedding model (trained on video content, text descriptions, user profiles) to create a high-dimensional preference vector for each user. This vector encapsulates aesthetic preferences (color palettes, shot composition), thematic interests (genres, keywords), and pacing preferences (edit rhythm, scene duration).

2.  **Scene Segmentation & Feature Extraction:**
    *   For each training/source video, implement a scene detection algorithm.
    *   Extract visual features (dominant colors, object detection, motion vectors, shot type) and audio features (mood classification, speech/music ratio) from each scene.
    *   Create a feature vector representing each scene, analogous to the user preference vector.

3.  **Scene Relevance Scoring:**
    *   Calculate the cosine similarity between the user preference vector and each scene feature vector. This yields a "relevance score" for each scene, indicating how closely it aligns with the user's predicted interests.

4.  **Dynamic Preview Generation:**
    *   Select a subset of scenes based on their relevance scores (e.g., top 5 highest-scoring scenes).
    *   Implement a sequence optimization algorithm (e.g., reinforcement learning) to determine the optimal order of these scenes within the preview. The optimization goal is to maximize predicted engagement (e.g., estimated watch time, click-through rate). Factors considered:
        *   Pacing – vary scene lengths to create a compelling rhythm.
        *   Emotional arc – build tension and release to create a narrative flow.
        *   Diversity – avoid repetitive visuals or themes.
    *   Render the selected scenes into a cohesive preview video.
    *   Implement a ‘cold start’ system: if user data is limited, rely on aggregate data for similar videos.

5.  **A/B Testing and Feedback Loop:**
    *   Continuously A/B test different preview generation algorithms and parameter settings to identify the most effective strategies.
    *   Monitor user engagement metrics (watch time, completion rate) for each preview.
    *   Use this data to refine the preference models, scene feature extraction techniques, and sequence optimization algorithms.

**Pseudocode (Preview Generation):**

```
function generatePreview(userProfile, videoContent):
  scenes = detectScenes(videoContent)
  sceneFeatures = extractFeatures(scenes)
  relevanceScores = calculateRelevance(userProfile, sceneFeatures)
  selectedScenes = selectTopN(scenes, relevanceScores, N=5)  // N configurable
  optimalSequence = optimizeSequence(selectedScenes, userProfile)
  preview = renderPreview(optimalSequence)
  return preview
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing infrastructure for video processing and machine learning.
*   Large-scale storage for video datasets and model parameters.
*   Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Video editing/rendering libraries (FFmpeg).
*   API access to social media and streaming services (optional).
