## Dynamic Contextual GUI "Layers"

**Concept:** A display system that presents GUI elements not as a flat 2D overlay, but as distinct, interactive "layers" extending *into* the screen's depth – visually and functionally. Think holographic, but built with standard display tech.

**Specs:**

*   **Display Hardware:** Requires a display capable of *localized* brightness and contrast control at a very granular level – ideally micro-LED or OLED with individually addressable pixels. A parallax barrier or lenticular lens sheet *may* be beneficial, but not strictly necessary.
*   **Depth Mapping:** The system maintains a dynamic depth map of active GUI elements. Elements closer to the "viewer" (screen surface) are rendered with higher brightness/contrast and potentially with slight blurring to create a sense of depth. Elements further back are rendered dimmer, with sharper focus.
*   **Layer Management:** GUI elements are grouped into “layers”. Each layer has associated depth, parallax, and interaction properties. Layers can be dynamically reordered, blended, and animated to create unique visual effects and user experiences.
*   **Interaction Model:**
    *   **Raycasting:** User input (touch, mouse, gaze tracking) uses raycasting to determine which layer and element is being interacted with, accounting for depth.
    *   **Depth-Aware Gestures:** Gestures are interpreted based on the depth of the interaction. For example, a "swipe" performed closer to the screen might move an element within the current layer, while a deeper swipe could switch between layers.
    *   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** Haptic feedback is modulated based on the perceived depth of the interaction, providing a more immersive experience.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Layer Manager Module:** Responsible for managing layers, their properties, and rendering order.
    *   **Depth Engine Module:** Calculates depth based on GUI element properties and user input.
    *   **Interaction Handler Module:** Processes user input and translates it into actions based on the active layer and element.
    *   **Rendering Pipeline:** Custom rendering pipeline that supports localized brightness/contrast control and parallax effects.

**Pseudocode (Interaction Handler):**

```
function handleInput(inputEvent):
    ray = createRayFromInput(inputEvent)
    intersection = findLayerIntersection(ray)

    if intersection != null:
        layer = intersection.layer
        element = intersection.element

        if element.isInteractive():
            action = element.handleAction(inputEvent)
            processAction(action, layer) // Updates UI, triggers events

        else:
            //Handle Layer specific actions, example - Layer Switch
            switchLayer(layer)

    else:
        //Background Interaction, example - System Menu
        showSystemMenu()
```

**Innovation Detail:** This goes beyond simple layering in image editing software. This dynamically alters the *perceived* depth of elements based on interaction, creating a truly 3D-like GUI experience. It can be used for a lot of things, but I feel like it could create a new paradigm for the types of applications we could provide.
