## Dynamic Trie Augmentation with Contextual Embeddings

**Concept:** Expand the static trie used for biasing with a dynamic layer that incorporates contextual embeddings derived from the entire utterance history, not just the immediate previous token. This allows for more nuanced biasing, anticipating likely words based on the broader conversation, rather than simply continuation probabilities.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Contextual Embedding Generator:**
    *   Input: Audio waveform of the entire utterance *up to the current point*.
    *   Model:  A recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a GRU or LSTM, trained to produce a fixed-length vector representing the contextual meaning of the utterance so far.
    *   Output: A ‘context vector’ of dimension *D*.

2.  **Dynamic Trie Layer:**
    *   Structure:  A layer positioned *between* the previous token and the core trie lookup.
    *   Function:  Transforms the previous token’s embedding and the context vector into a weighted set of biases for the trie nodes.
    *   Implementation:
        *   Concatenate the previous token embedding and the context vector:  `combined_embedding = concatenate(previous_token_embedding, context_vector)`
        *   Project `combined_embedding` to a bias dimension *B* using a fully connected layer with weights *W*: `bias_vector = fully_connected(combined_embedding, W)`
        *   The `bias_vector`’s elements represent weights assigned to the trie nodes. A higher weight indicates a stronger bias towards that node's corresponding wordpiece.
        *   During trie traversal, the node scores are adjusted by adding the corresponding bias weight from `bias_vector`.

3.  **Trie Modification**:
    *   The trie itself remains structurally the same. Only the *scoring* of nodes changes during lookup.
    *   No explicit trie updates are needed. The dynamic biasing is handled at runtime.

4.  **Training**:
    *   End-to-end training is required.
    *   Loss function: Standard ASR loss (e.g., cross-entropy) combined with a regularization term to prevent excessively strong biases.

**Pseudocode (Trie Lookup with Dynamic Bias):**

```
function lookup_with_dynamic_bias(previous_token, current_audio, trie, context_generator, bias_dimension):
  context_vector = context_generator(current_audio)
  bias_vector = fully_connected(concatenate(previous_token, context_vector), W)  //W is learned weight
  
  node_scores = {}
  
  function traverse_trie(node, current_path, current_score):
    if node is terminal:
      node_scores[current_path] = current_score
      return
    
    for wordpiece, next_node in node.children:
      new_score = current_score + next_node.base_score + bias_vector[next_node.id]
      traverse_trie(next_node, current_path + wordpiece, new_score)
  
  traverse_trie(trie.root, "", 0)
  
  return node_scores
```

**Rationale:** Current biasing methods rely heavily on immediate continuation. This system introduces a longer-term memory by encoding the entire utterance history into the context vector. This provides a richer signal for biasing the trie and anticipating likely words, especially in complex conversations where the topic may shift subtly. It enhances the trie's ability to guide the ASR system toward the most relevant vocabulary.
