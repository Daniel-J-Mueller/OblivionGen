## Dynamic Patch Scaling & Attention Focusing

**Concept:** Extend the existing patch-based video analysis by introducing dynamically scaled patches *and* a secondary attention mechanism focused on patch *change* over time, not just spatial/temporal relationships within the patch itself. This aims to improve performance on videos with high degrees of motion or deformation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Dynamic Patch Scaling Module:**

*   **Input:** Stream of F video frames, N patch grid.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Optical Flow Analysis:** For each patch in consecutive frames, compute dense optical flow.
    *   **Deformation Metric:** Calculate a 'deformation score' for each patch based on the magnitude and consistency of the optical flow.  Higher scores indicate more significant deformation.
    *   **Patch Scaling:**  Scale the size of each patch proportionally to its deformation score. Highly deformed patches are enlarged; static patches remain small.  Maximum scale factor = 2x original size. Minimum scale factor = 0.5x original size.
    *   **Resampling:** Resample the image to accommodate the variable patch sizes. This may require interpolation techniques.
*   **Output:**  Modified video frames with dynamically scaled patches.

**2. Change-Focused Attention Module:**

*   **Input:** Dynamically scaled patches, initial embedding vectors (as per the provided patent).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Change Vector Generation:** For each patch, compute a 'change vector' by subtracting the embedding vector of the patch in the previous frame from the current frame's embedding vector.  This highlights the *difference* in the patch's representation over time.
    *   **Change Attention Weighting:** Calculate attention weights based on the magnitude of the change vector. Larger magnitudes = higher attention weight.
    *   **Attention-Weighted Embedding:** Multiply the initial embedding vector by the change attention weight. This boosts the signal from patches undergoing significant changes.
    *   **Combined Attention:** Combine the change-focused attention weights with the original temporal and spatial attention weights from the self-attention model.  A weighted sum or concatenation could be used.
*   **Output:** Modified embedding vectors with enhanced change representation.

**3. Self-Attention Integration:**

*   Integrate the change-focused attention into the existing self-attention model. The combined attention weights are used in the attention calculations.
*   Retrain the self-attention model with the modified embeddings and attention mechanism.

**Pseudocode (Change-Focused Attention Module):**

```
function calculate_change_attention(embedding_current, embedding_previous):
  change_vector = embedding_current - embedding_previous
  change_magnitude = norm(change_vector)
  attention_weight = sigmoid(change_magnitude)  // Constrain between 0 and 1
  return attention_weight

function apply_change_attention(embedding, attention_weight):
  weighted_embedding = embedding * attention_weight
  return weighted_embedding
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration will be essential for optical flow computation and self-attention calculations.
*   Sufficient memory will be required to store dynamically scaled patches and intermediate embeddings.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Anomaly detection in video streams (e.g., identifying unusual movements or object behavior).
*   Action recognition in videos with complex motions.
*   Video compression with improved efficiency.
