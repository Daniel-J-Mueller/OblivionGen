## Dynamic Audio-Visual "Mood Painting" for Live Streams

**Concept:** Extend the existing system to allow real-time modification of audiovisual content based on *viewer* emotional response, creating a dynamically "painted" moodscape overlaid on the live stream. This goes beyond simply selecting audio based on content *attributes* and moves toward responsive, collaborative audio-visual experiences.

**System Specs:**

*   **Input:** Live video stream (existing), Real-time aggregated viewer emotional data (new). Emotional data sourced from:
    *   Facial expression analysis via webcam (optional, user consent required).
    *   Textual sentiment analysis of live chat (primary source).
    *   Emote/reaction data from streaming platform.
*   **Emotional Aggregation Unit:**
    *   Processes raw emotional data.
    *   Calculates a dominant "mood vector" representing the collective emotional state of the audience. (e.g., [Joy: 0.6, Sadness: 0.1, Anger: 0.05, Neutral: 0.25]).
    *   Applies smoothing algorithms to prevent jarring transitions.
*   **Audio-Visual Effects Library (Expanded):**
    *   Existing audio library augmented with:
        *   Procedurally generated ambient soundscapes (e.g., rain, wind, city noise) mapped to mood dimensions.
        *   Visual effects (color filters, particle systems, overlays) also mapped to mood dimensions.
        *   "Mood Themes" - pre-defined combinations of audio and visual effects.
*   **Real-Time Composition Engine:**
    *   Receives mood vector from Aggregation Unit.
    *   Selects/generates audio and visual effects based on mood vector.
    *   Applies effects to live video stream in real-time.
    *   Allows for layering and blending of multiple effects.
    *   Provides parameters for adjusting intensity, speed, and other characteristics of effects.
*   **User Control (Streamer):**
    *   Streamer can adjust the sensitivity of the emotional aggregation (how much audience emotion influences the stream).
    *   Streamer can override the automated system and manually select effects.
    *   Streamer can save/load custom “mood presets”.

**Pseudocode (Composition Engine):**

```
function compose(moodVector, videoStream):
  // Normalize moodVector
  normalizedMood = normalize(moodVector)

  // Select base audio effect
  baseAudio = selectAudio(normalizedMood.joy, normalizedMood.sadness, normalizedMood.anger)

  // Select visual filter
  visualFilter = selectVisualFilter(normalizedMood.joy, normalizedMood.sadness, normalizedMood.anger)

  // Generate particles
  particleCount = normalizedMood.joy * 100  // Scale particle count based on joy

  // Blend effects
  finalAudio = blend(baseAudio, generateAmbientSound(normalizedMood))
  finalVideo = applyFilter(videoStream, visualFilter)
  finalVideo = overlayParticles(finalVideo, particleCount)

  return finalVideo, finalAudio
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Interactive music performances.
*   Gaming streams with dynamic atmosphere.
*   Live storytelling with emotionally responsive visuals.
*   Meditation/relaxation streams.
*   Immersive virtual events.
