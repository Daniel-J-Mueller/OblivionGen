## Secure, Distributed BMC Firmware & Data Mirroring with Dynamic Key Rotation

**Specification:** A system augmenting the described removable storage card BMC architecture with a geographically distributed, peer-to-peer firmware and data mirroring system, incorporating dynamic key rotation for enhanced security and resilience.

**Components:**

1.  **BMC Node:**  The baseboard management controller as described, equipped with the removable storage card socket. Each node possesses a unique, cryptographically secure identifier (NodeID).

2.  **Removable Storage Card (RSC):**  As described, but extended to include a secure enclave and a dedicated hardware random number generator (HRNG). The RSC stores:
    *   BMC Firmware (immutable core + mutable configuration)
    *   Network Device Data (sensor data, logs)
    *   NodeID
    *   Current Encryption Key (CEK)
    *   Peer List (list of trusted BMC nodes)

3.  **Distributed Hash Table (DHT):**  An overlay network facilitating peer discovery and data exchange.  Each BMC node participates in the DHT.  Data is addressed by content hash, not location.

4.  **Key Management Service (KMS):** A distributed KMS utilizing a threshold cryptography scheme. No single node holds the complete key.

**Operation:**

1.  **Boot Process:** Upon boot, the BMC verifies the integrity of the firmware on the RSC via digital signature verification.

2.  **Peer Discovery:** The BMC uses the DHT to discover other trusted BMC nodes (peers) from its Peer List.

3.  **Firmware Synchronization:** The BMC periodically synchronizes its firmware with peers. Instead of copying entire firmware images, a delta-based synchronization is performed, transmitting only the changes.  Changes are digitally signed by the originating BMC node.

4.  **Data Mirroring:** Network device data stored on the RSC is mirrored to a subset of trusted peers, employing erasure coding for redundancy.

5.  **Dynamic Key Rotation:** The CEK is rotated periodically.
    *   Each BMC node generates a new symmetric key using its HRNG.
    *   The new key is encrypted using a key derived from a shared secret with a subset of peers and the KMS.
    *   The encrypted key is exchanged with peers.
    *   Peers decrypt the new key using their shared secrets and the KMS.
    *   Once a quorum of peers have successfully decrypted the key, the BMC switches to the new key.
    *   Old keys are securely erased after a transition period.

**Pseudocode (Key Rotation):**

```
// BMC Node A initiates key rotation

generateNewKey() -> newKey
quorumSize = 3 // Example: require 3 peers to agree

encryptedKey = encrypt(newKey, sharedSecretWithPeer1, sharedSecretWithPeer2, KMS_Key)

send(encryptedKey, Peer1)
send(encryptedKey, Peer2)

//Peer 1 & 2 decryption sequence
decryptedKey = decrypt(encryptedKey, sharedSecretWithPeerA, KMS_Key)

if (quorumMet()) {
  switchKey(decryptedKey)
  eraseOldKey()
}
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** Implement a dedicated HSM within each BMC node for secure key storage and cryptographic operations.
*   **Erasure Coding:** Use Reed-Solomon or similar erasure coding scheme to ensure data availability even with node failures.  (k=8, m=4 for example - can tolerate up to 4 node failures).
*   **Secure Boot:** Implement Secure Boot to prevent unauthorized firmware modifications.
*   **Authentication:**  Employ mutual authentication between BMC nodes before establishing secure communication channels.
*   **Protocol:** Establish a dedicated peer-to-peer communication protocol optimized for data mirroring and synchronization.  Utilize DTLS or similar secure transport layer protocol.
