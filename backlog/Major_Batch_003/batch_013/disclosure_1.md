## Temporal Attention for Multi-Modal Page Embeddings

**Specification:**

**I. Overview:**

This design expands on the concept of pooled page embeddings by incorporating temporal attention mechanisms and multi-modal data integration. The goal is to create significantly richer, more nuanced page representations that better capture user intent and content relevance.

**II. Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Input:** The system accepts input from multiple modalities associated with each page visited. These include:
    *   **Textual Content:** Page text, headings, and metadata.
    *   **Visual Content:** Images, videos, and other visual elements on the page.
    *   **Interactive Elements:** User interactions (clicks, scrolls, form submissions) on the page.
    *   **Temporal Data:** Timestamp of the page visit.

2.  **Modality-Specific Encoders:**  Each modality has a dedicated encoder:
    *   **Text Encoder:** Transformer-based language model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) to generate textual embeddings.
    *   **Visual Encoder:** Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Vision Transformer (ViT) to generate visual embeddings.
    *   **Interaction Encoder:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) or Transformer to generate interaction embeddings.

3.  **Temporal Attention Layer:** This is the core innovation. It operates on the sequence of page embeddings generated by the modality-specific encoders. 
    *   **Attention Mechanism:** A self-attention mechanism is used to weigh the importance of each page embedding in the sequence based on its temporal relationship to the current page. Specifically, it calculates attention weights based on the time difference between each page visit. 
    *   **Time Decay Factor:** Introduce a configurable time decay factor to prioritize more recent page visits. This allows the system to focus on the user's immediate browsing context.  This can be adjusted on a per-user basis.
    *   **Output:** The Temporal Attention Layer outputs a weighted sum of the page embeddings, resulting in a temporally-aware page representation.

4.  **Fusion Layer:** Combines the outputs from the Temporal Attention Layer and the modality-specific encoders.
    *   **Concatenation:** Simple concatenation of the embeddings.
    *   **Gated Fusion:**  Learnable gates control the contribution of each embedding, allowing the system to dynamically adjust the importance of different modalities and temporal features.

5.  **Pooled Page Embedding:** The output of the Fusion Layer is fed into a pooling layer (e.g., max pooling, average pooling) to generate the final pooled page embedding.

**III. Pseudocode:**

```python
def generate_pooled_embedding(page_sequence, text_encoder, visual_encoder, interaction_encoder, time_decay_factor):
    text_embeddings = [text_encoder(page['text']) for page in page_sequence]
    visual_embeddings = [visual_encoder(page['visual']) for page in page_sequence]
    interaction_embeddings = [interaction_encoder(page['interaction']) for page in page_sequence]

    # Temporal Attention
    attention_weights = []
    for i in range(len(page_sequence)):
        weights = []
        for j in range(len(page_sequence)):
            time_diff = abs(page_sequence[i]['timestamp'] - page_sequence[j]['timestamp'])
            weight = exp(-time_diff * time_decay_factor) # Exponential decay based on time difference
            weights.append(weight)
        attention_weights.append(weights)

    # Apply attention weights to embeddings
    attended_embeddings = []
    for i in range(len(page_sequence)):
        attended_embedding = sum([attention_weights[i][j] * embedding for j, embedding in enumerate([text_embeddings[i], visual_embeddings[i], interaction_embeddings[i]])])
        attended_embeddings.append(attended_embedding)

    # Fusion and Pooling
    fused_embedding = concatenate(attended_embeddings) # Or use gated fusion
    pooled_embedding = max_pool(fused_embedding) # Or use average pool

    return pooled_embedding
```

**IV. Implementation Notes:**

*   The `time_decay_factor` should be a configurable hyperparameter, tuned based on the specific dataset and user behavior.
*   Experiment with different fusion techniques (concatenation, gated fusion, etc.) to optimize performance.
*   Consider using pre-trained language models and vision transformers to leverage transfer learning.
*   This architecture is designed to be adaptable to various data modalities and can be extended to incorporate additional features (e.g., user demographics, location data).
