## Adaptive Response Granularity

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts the detail and complexity of template responses based on inferred user cognitive load and communication style.

**Core Concept:** The existing patent focuses on mapping intent to templates. This expands on that by recognizing *how* a user is communicating, not just *what* they are asking.  A stressed or hurried user requires succinct answers.  A detail-oriented user might appreciate elaboration.

**Components:**

1.  **Cognitive Load Analyzer:**
    *   **Input:** User message text, message timing (inter-message delay), and potentially audio analysis (if available via the messaging platform - tone, speed of speech).
    *   **Process:** Utilize NLP models (pre-trained or fine-tuned) to estimate cognitive load.  Features: sentence complexity, emotional tone, presence of urgency indicators ("ASAP", "immediately"), length of message, and typing speed.  A high score indicates high cognitive load.
    *   **Output:** Cognitive Load Score (0-100).

2.  **Communication Style Profiler:**
    *   **Input:** Historical message data from the user (if available).
    *   **Process:** Analyze message length, vocabulary richness, use of emojis, formality, and typical response patterns.  Cluster users into communication style archetypes (e.g., "Concise," "Detailed," "Formal," "Informal").  A new user starts with a default profile and learns over time.
    *   **Output:** Communication Style Archetype.

3.  **Response Granularity Controller:**
    *   **Input:** Cognitive Load Score, Communication Style Archetype, base template response.
    *   **Process:**  This is the core logic. Define a set of "granularity levels" for each template.  Each level represents a different degree of detail.
        *   Level 1: Minimal -  A very short, direct answer.
        *   Level 2: Standard - The original template response.
        *   Level 3: Elaborated -  Adds contextual information or examples.
        *   Level 4: Comprehensive - Provides a detailed explanation, links to resources, and proactive suggestions.
    *   **Logic:**
        *   High Cognitive Load: Select Level 1 or 2.
        *   Detailed Communication Style: Select Level 3 or 4.
        *   Concise Communication Style: Select Level 1 or 2.
        *   Combine factors:  e.g., High Cognitive Load + Detailed Style -> Level 2.  Low Cognitive Load + Concise Style -> Level 1.
    *   **Output:**  Selected Granularity Level.

4.  **Dynamic Template Renderer:**
    *   **Input:** Selected Granularity Level, base template, user profile data.
    *   **Process:**  Renders the template response according to the selected granularity level.  This may involve:
        *   Selecting a pre-defined version of the template.
        *   Adding or removing sentences or paragraphs.
        *   Substituting complex terms with simpler ones.
        *   Adding or removing links to external resources.
    *   **Output:**  Final, dynamically rendered response.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generate_response(user_message, user_profile):
  cognitive_load = analyze_cognitive_load(user_message)
  communication_style = get_communication_style(user_profile)
  base_template = get_base_template(user_message)

  granularity_level = determine_granularity_level(cognitive_load, communication_style)

  rendered_response = render_template(base_template, granularity_level, user_profile)

  return rendered_response

function determine_granularity_level(cognitive_load, communication_style):
  if cognitive_load > 70:
    level = 1 or 2
  elif communication_style == "Detailed":
    level = 3 or 4
  elif communication_style == "Concise":
    level = 1 or 2
  else:
    level = 2
  return level
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Large dataset of user messages and corresponding cognitive load assessments (potentially crowdsourced).
*   User communication style profiles (historical message data).
*   Multiple versions of each template response at different granularity levels.
