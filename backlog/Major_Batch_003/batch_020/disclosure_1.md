## Adaptive Ambiance Projection System

**Core Concept:** Extend the communication system’s awareness beyond the call itself to subtly influence the environment of the call participant, creating a more immersive and personalized communication experience. This goes beyond simply displaying video on a TV.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Communication Device: Integrated wide-angle, high-resolution projector capable of projecting onto surrounding surfaces. Ambient light sensor. Microphone array for spatial audio analysis.
    *   Television: Standard HDMI connectivity. (Used as a fallback/secondary display).
    *   Environmental Sensors (Optional): Integration with smart home systems for temperature, humidity, and lighting data.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Call Analysis Module:** Real-time analysis of audio and video streams for emotional cues (facial expressions, tone of voice).
    *   **Ambiance Engine:** Based on call analysis, selects and projects dynamic ambient scenes. Scene library includes abstract patterns, nature scenes, subtle color washes, and dynamic 'lightscapes'.
    *   **Spatial Mapping:** Uses camera and (optionally) environmental sensor data to create a 3D map of the room, enabling accurate projection alignment and avoiding obstacles.
    *   **Scene Customization:** Allows users to create and save custom ambient scenes, or to define preferences (e.g., "Calming scenes for work calls," "Energetic scenes for brainstorming").
    *   **Adaptive Brightness:** Adjusts projection brightness based on ambient light levels and user preferences.
    *   **Fallback Mode:** If projection fails or is disabled, seamlessly reverts to standard video output on the television.

**Operation:**

1.  Upon receiving a call, the system activates the projector and begins projecting a default ambient scene.
2.  The Call Analysis Module analyzes the audio and video streams, identifying emotional cues from both the local user and the remote participant.
3.  The Ambiance Engine adjusts the projected scene in real-time based on the identified cues. For example:
    *   A calming scene might be projected during a stressful conversation.
    *   An energetic scene might be projected during a brainstorming session.
    *   Subtle color changes might be used to emphasize key points.
4.  Spatial Mapping ensures that the projection is aligned correctly and avoids obstacles in the room.
5.  The user can customize the ambient scenes and define preferences.
6.  If the projection fails or is disabled, the system seamlessly reverts to standard video output on the television.

**Pseudocode (Ambiance Engine):**

```
function updateAmbiance(emotionalState, remoteEmotionalState) {

    // Determine overall call mood
    mood = calculateMood(emotionalState, remoteEmotionalState)

    //Select scene based on mood.
    if (mood == "stressed"){
        scene = getScene("calming_forest")
    } else if (mood == "excited"){
        scene = getScene("energetic_abstract")
    } else if (mood == "neutral"){
        scene = getScene("soft_blue_wash")
    }

    //Adjust scene parameters
    brightness = adjustBrightness(mood)
    colorTemperature = adjustColorTemperature(mood)

    //Apply scene
    projectScene(scene, brightness, colorTemperature)

}
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on *displaying* the call. This system focuses on *augmenting the environment* of the call, creating a more holistic and immersive communication experience. It doesn’t simply show the remote party, it subtly alters the local environment *in response to* the remote party, promoting a more natural and engaging interaction.
