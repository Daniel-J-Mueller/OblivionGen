## Spectral Region-Adaptive Precoding with Interference Nulling

**Concept:** Expand the spectral region customization to *active* interference mitigation. Instead of just shaping noise *within* the transmitted signal, proactively null interference from *other* signals within each spectral region.

**Specs:**

*   **System Architecture:** Multi-user MIMO system with beamforming capabilities. The system will operate in a frequency-division duplex (FDD) or time-division duplex (TDD) mode.
*   **Spectral Analysis Module:**
    *   Divides the total frequency band into N spectral regions. (N is configurable).
    *   For each region, estimates the interference covariance matrix based on pilot signals or channel estimation techniques.
    *   Identifies dominant interferers within each region.
*   **Precoding Matrix Generation:**
    *   A precoding matrix is generated for each user *and* each spectral region.
    *   The precoding is designed to simultaneously:
        1.  Maximize signal strength to the intended user within that spectral region.
        2.  Null the interference from identified interferers within the *same* spectral region.
        3.  Respect the constellation goal assigned to that spectral region (e.g., 256-QAM, 1024-QAM).  The precoder adjusts to maintain EVM within acceptable bounds for the targeted constellation.
*   **Dynamic Region Adjustment:**
    *   The system continuously monitors channel conditions and interference levels.
    *   If interference levels exceed a threshold in a specific region, the system can:
        1.  Increase the precoding nulling strength in that region.
        2.  Reduce the constellation goal in that region to increase robustness.
        3.  Dynamically reallocate spectral regions between users to minimize overall interference.
*   **Cancellation Pulse Integration:**
    *   The existing CFR cancellation pulse (from the parent patent) is *integrated* with the precoding matrix. The cancellation pulse acts as a *refinement* to the precoded signal, further reducing peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) and mitigating residual noise.
*   **Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) Optimization:**
    *   Each spectral region maintains a target EVM range.
    *   The precoding matrix and cancellation pulse scaling factors are adjusted dynamically to ensure EVM stays within the target range.
*   **Computational Complexity Reduction:**
    *   Utilize matrix decomposition techniques (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition - SVD) to reduce the complexity of calculating the precoding matrix.
    *   Implement efficient algorithms for SVD and matrix multiplication.

**Pseudocode (Precoding Matrix Calculation):**

```
// Input: Interference Covariance Matrix (R_i), Channel Matrix (H_i), Target Constellation Goal (C_i)
// Output: Precoding Matrix (W_i)

function calculate_precoding_matrix(R_i, H_i, C_i):
    // 1. Calculate the inverse of the interference covariance matrix
    R_i_inv = inverse(R_i)

    // 2. Calculate the precoding matrix based on channel and interference
    W_i = R_i_inv * H_i.conjugate().transpose()

    // 3. Constellation Goal Adjustment
    if C_i == "256-QAM":
        scaling_factor = 1.0
    elif C_i == "1024-QAM":
        scaling_factor = 0.8 // Reduce power to maintain EVM
    else:
        scaling_factor = 1.0

    W_i = W_i * scaling_factor

    return W_i
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly improved interference mitigation.
*   Increased spectral efficiency.
*   Enhanced system capacity.
*   Greater flexibility in adapting to dynamic channel conditions.
*   Support for higher-order modulation schemes (e.g., 1024-QAM).
