## Dynamic Occlusion Mapping with Learned Priors

**Concept:** Extend the 3D reconstruction to predict and render realistic occlusions – not just what *is* visible, but what *should* be hidden – by leveraging learned priors about object permanence and typical scene layouts. This goes beyond geometric reconstruction, moving into predictive rendering.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Utilize the existing stereo camera setup *plus* an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and, optionally, a low-resolution depth sensor (Time-of-Flight). The IMU provides robust tracking data, and the depth sensor acts as a "ground truth" for initial training and calibration.
*   **Data Synchronization:**  Precisely synchronize data streams from all sensors.  Timestamp all data packets.
*   **Feature Extraction:** Maintain existing edge/corner/surface detection. Add a semantic segmentation pass, identifying broad object classes (e.g., "wall," "floor," "furniture," "person").

**2.  3D Reconstruction & Scene Graph Creation:**

*   **Geometric Reconstruction:** Utilize the existing 2D/3D geometry generation pipeline.
*   **Scene Graph:** Create a dynamic scene graph representing the reconstructed environment. Nodes represent objects/surfaces. Edges represent spatial relationships (e.g., “on,” “near,” “behind”). Update this graph continuously.
*   **Object Persistence Tracking:**  Assign a ‘persistence score’ to each object node in the scene graph. This score is initially high for directly observed objects, and decays over time if the object is not re-observed. Utilize Kalman filtering or a similar tracking algorithm to predict object positions even when occluded.

**3. Occlusion Prediction & Rendering:**

*   **Learned Prior Network:** Train a deep neural network (a generative model, perhaps a Variational Autoencoder or GAN) on a large dataset of indoor scenes. This network learns the statistical relationships between object types, spatial layouts, and occlusion patterns. Input: partial 3D reconstruction, semantic segmentation, persistence scores, IMU data. Output:  Probability map of likely occlusions.
*   **Occlusion Mask Generation:** Combine the geometric reconstruction, persistence scores, semantic segmentation, and the output of the learned prior network to generate a dynamic occlusion mask. This mask defines which parts of the scene should be rendered as occluded.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** Integrate the occlusion mask into the rendering pipeline. This can be done using standard rendering techniques (e.g., stencil buffers, shadow mapping) to simulate realistic occlusions.
*   **Dynamic Refinement:** Continuously refine the occlusion mask based on new sensor data. If an object is re-observed, update its persistence score and the occlusion mask accordingly.

**4. Pseudocode (Occlusion Mask Generation):**

```
function generateOcclusionMask(geometry, semanticSegmentation, persistenceScores, priorNetworkOutput):
  // Initialize occlusion mask (all visible)
  occlusionMask = allVisible()

  // Apply geometric occlusion (based on reconstructed geometry)
  occlusionMask = applyGeometricOcclusion(geometry, occlusionMask)

  // Apply persistence-based occlusion (decay over time)
  for each object in scene:
    if object.persistenceScore < threshold:
      occlusionMask[object] = occluded()

  // Incorporate prior network output (predict likely occlusions)
  occlusionMask = blend(occlusionMask, priorNetworkOutput)

  return occlusionMask
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing HMD stereo camera system.
*   IMU (integrated into HMD or external).
*   Optional: Low-resolution Time-of-Flight sensor.
*   Edge computing device (GPU-accelerated) for real-time processing.

**6. Software Requirements:**

*   Deep learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   3D rendering engine.
*   Sensor data fusion library.
*   Custom software for data acquisition, processing, and rendering.
