**Ephemeral Group Concealment & Revelation**

**Concept:** Expand the individual concealed list functionality to allow users to create ephemeral, dynamically forming groups based on mutual, *unrevealed* interest. This isn’t about direct connection, but about gauging collective sentiment/interest *before* revealing any identities.

**Specs:**

*   **Group Creation:** A user initiates a ‘Sentiment Probe’ – specifying a topic or question. They then populate a concealed list with individuals they believe *might* share that sentiment.
*   **Mutual Signaling (Tiered):** Each person on the concealed list receives a notification: "Someone believes you may be interested in [topic]. Indicate interest without revealing yourself." This isn't a 'yes/no,' but a graded scale (e.g., "Not at all," "Slightly," "Maybe," "Interested," "Very Interested").  The user initiating the probe *does not* see individual responses, only aggregate data.
*   **Threshold & Revelation:** The probe initiator sets a ‘revelation threshold’ (e.g., 60% of concealed list registers “Interested” or “Very Interested”). If the threshold is met, *then* a temporary group chat is created consisting of all individuals who signaled interest.  Identities are revealed *at this point*.
*   **Ephemeral Nature:** The group chat (and revealed identities) automatically dissolves after a pre-defined period (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).  No permanent record is created.
*   **Anonymized Sentiment Reporting:** The probe initiator receives anonymized reports on the overall sentiment distribution. E.g., "70% indicated some level of interest," "Distribution: 20% 'Not at all', 30% 'Maybe', 50% 'Interested/Very Interested'". No individual identities are revealed *ever* unless they actively participate in the revealed group.
*   **Weighted Concealed Lists:** Allow users to 'weight' individuals on their concealed lists.  A higher weight means that person’s response contributes more heavily to the threshold calculation. (e.g., you strongly believe your friend will be interested, so give their response a weight of 2).
*   **Proximity/Network Layering**: Optionally, implement a proximity or network layer. Users can define a circle of contacts (e.g., “people within my network” or “people in my location”). The system prioritizes individuals *within* that circle when populating the concealed list.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Threshold Check):**

```
function checkThreshold(concealedList, topic, thresholdPercentage):
  totalResponses = 0
  interestedResponses = 0

  for each person in concealedList:
    response = getResponse(person, topic)  //Graded response (e.g., 1-5)
    totalResponses++

    if response >= 3: // Example: 3 or higher is considered "Interested"
      interestedResponses++

  interestPercentage = (interestedResponses / totalResponses) * 100

  if interestPercentage >= thresholdPercentage:
    return true //Threshold met
  else:
    return false //Threshold not met
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Market Research:** Gauge interest in a new product or service before public announcement.
*   **Event Planning:**  Determine potential attendance for an event without publicly soliciting RSVPs.
*   **Social Sentiment Analysis:**  Understand collective opinion on a sensitive topic without triggering public debate.
*   **Anonymous Polling**: Get a truly anonymous sense of how people feel about something.
