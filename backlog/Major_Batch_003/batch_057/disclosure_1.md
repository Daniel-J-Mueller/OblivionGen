**Variable Refraction Micro-Lens Array with Electrostatic Tuning**

**Concept:** A micro-lens array where each lens element's focal length is individually controllable via electrostatic manipulation of a dielectric fluid within the lens structure, leveraging principles akin to the provided patent’s flexure-based membrane control but shifting from mechanical deformation to dielectric constant modulation.

**Specifications:**

*   **Array Configuration:** Hexagonal close-packed arrangement of micro-lenses. Density: 1000 lenses/mm<sup>2</sup> – 5000 lenses/mm<sup>2</sup> (scalable).
*   **Lens Element Structure:** Each lens is a sealed cavity containing a dielectric fluid (high-permittivity, low viscosity).  The cavity is bounded by a flexible diaphragm (similar material to the patented membrane – elastomer) and a micro-fabricated electrode array on the substrate.
*   **Electrode Array:** Each lens has 6-12 individually addressable micro-electrodes surrounding the diaphragm.  Electrodes are patterned using standard lithographic techniques (e.g., photolithography, electron beam lithography). Electrode material: ITO or similar transparent conductor.
*   **Dielectric Fluid:** Fluorinated oil with high dielectric constant (ε<sub>r</sub> > 20) and low viscosity (< 1 cP).  Fluid is encapsulated within the micro-lens cavity under vacuum to prevent leakage.
*   **Flexure Integration:**  Each micro-lens is suspended above the substrate using micro-fabricated flexures, analogous to the patent's design but scaled down.  This provides mechanical isolation and prevents short-circuiting between the electrodes and the substrate. Flexure material: Polyimide or similar high-strength polymer.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Array of drivers capable of applying precise voltages to each electrode.
    *   Algorithm to map desired focal length or image characteristics to voltage levels.
    *   Feedback loop using an integrated photodetector to measure focal length and adjust voltages accordingly.
*   **Fabrication Process:**
    1.  Deep Reactive Ion Etching (DRIE) to create micro-cavities in a silicon substrate.
    2.  Deposition of flexure material (e.g., Polyimide).
    3.  Photolithography and etching to define electrode patterns.
    4.  Bonding of a cover plate to seal the micro-cavities.
    5.  Filling of micro-cavities with dielectric fluid under vacuum.
    6.  Electrical connections to individual electrodes.

**Pseudocode for Control Algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION adjustLens(lensID, desiredFocalLength)
  // Calculate required voltage based on desired focal length
  voltage = calculateVoltage(desiredFocalLength)

  // Apply voltage to electrodes for the specified lens
  SET electrodeVoltage(lensID, voltage)

  // Measure actual focal length using integrated photodetector
  actualFocalLength = measureFocalLength(lensID)

  // Adjust voltage based on difference between desired and actual focal length
  error = desiredFocalLength - actualFocalLength
  voltageAdjustment = error * gain // Proportional control

  voltage = voltage + voltageAdjustment
  SET electrodeVoltage(lensID, voltage)
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateVoltage(focalLength)
  // Empirical calibration curve relating voltage to focal length
  voltage = calibrationCurve(focalLength)
  RETURN voltage
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Adaptive optics for microscopy and astronomy

*   Miniature cameras with variable focus
