**Dynamic Event-Based Micro-Local Trend Prediction**

**Concept:** Expand the surge detection beyond static business categories and timeframes, and integrate real-time event data to predict hyper-local, short-term trends. This moves beyond *finding* surges to *predicting* them before they fully manifest, enabling preemptive recommendations.

**Specs:**

1.  **Event Data Ingestion:**
    *   Data Sources: Integrate APIs for real-time event feeds (e.g., concert schedules, sports events, public gatherings, weather alerts, traffic incidents).
    *   Data Normalization: Standardize event data formats (location, time, expected attendance, event type).
    *   Geospatial Indexing: Index event locations for rapid proximity queries.

2.  **Predictive Modeling:**
    *   Input Features:
        *   Historical surge data (as per the existing patent).
        *   Event data (proximity, type, expected attendance).
        *   Real-time social media activity (keyword monitoring near event locations).
        *   Weather data.
        *   Traffic data.
    *   Model Type: Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM network) trained on historical surge data and event features.  The model predicts surge potential for each business within a defined radius of an event.
    *   Surge Potential Score: Output a "Surge Potential Score" for each business, representing the likelihood and magnitude of a surge in activity.

3.  **Micro-Local Segmentation:**
    *   Dynamic Grid System: Divide the geographic area into a grid of small cells (e.g., 100m x 100m).
    *   Cell-Level Prediction: Predict surge potential at the cell level, considering all businesses within each cell.
    *   Adaptive Resolution: Adjust grid resolution based on population density and event concentration.

4.  **Recommendation Engine Adaptation:**
    *   Proactive Recommendations: Instead of reacting to surges, proactively recommend businesses with high Surge Potential Scores *before* a surge occurs.
    *   Time-Sensitive Offers:  Trigger time-sensitive offers (e.g., discounts, promotions) to capitalize on predicted surges.
    *   Personalized Recommendations: Factor in user preferences, location, and historical behavior to refine recommendations.

5.  **Alerting System:**
    *   Thresholds: Configure thresholds for Surge Potential Scores to trigger alerts for specific businesses or areas.
    *   Real-time Monitoring: Continuously monitor Surge Potential Scores and update recommendations accordingly.
    *   Administrative Dashboard: Provide a dashboard for administrators to view real-time data, adjust thresholds, and manage alerts.

**Pseudocode (Surge Potential Calculation):**

```
function calculate_surge_potential(business, event_list, historical_data):
  event_impact = 0
  for event in event_list:
    distance = calculate_distance(business.location, event.location)
    if distance < event_radius:
      event_impact += event.expected_attendance * (1 - distance/event_radius) # Closer events have greater impact

  historical_baseline = get_average_activity(business, historical_data)
  social_media_sentiment = analyze_social_media(business.name, business.location)

  surge_potential = historical_baseline + event_impact + social_media_sentiment

  return surge_potential
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Time-series database (e.g., InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) for storing historical activity data.
*   Geospatial database (e.g., PostGIS) for storing location data.
*   NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB) for storing event data and social media sentiment.
