## Dynamic Fan Tiering & Micro-Reward System

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply identifying "top fans" with a visual badge. Introduce a dynamic tiering system with granular, automated micro-rewards tied to engagement *quality* and *consistency*, not just volume. This aims to cultivate a deeper, more engaged fanbase and incentivize valuable contributions.

**System Specs:**

*   **Tier Structure:** Implement five tiers: "Explorer", "Advocate", "Luminary", "Champion", "Icon". Tier assignment is calculated *daily* based on a weighted engagement score.
*   **Engagement Score Components:**
    *   **Content Interaction (30%):** Likes, shares, comments (weighted – see below).
    *   **Comment Quality (40%):** Determined by the existing ML model for high-quality comments, but augmented with sentiment analysis to detect *positive* contributions.
    *   **Consistency (20%):** Measures engagement frequency over the past 30 days – rewarding consistent participation.  A decay function ensures recent activity is weighted more heavily.
    *   **"Helpfulness" Rating (10%):**  Allow other users to upvote/downvote comments as "helpful". Integrate this feedback into the comment quality score.
*   **Tier Thresholds:**  Define minimum engagement score ranges for each tier. These thresholds will *automatically adjust* based on overall platform activity to maintain meaningful tier distribution.
*   **Micro-Reward System:**  Each tier unlocks different micro-rewards, delivered *automatically*:
    *   **Explorer:** Early access to sneak peeks, exclusive wallpapers.
    *   **Advocate:**  Featured comment section placement, priority customer support response.
    *   **Luminary:** Virtual "gifts" (badges, emojis) to bestow on other users, access to exclusive Q&A sessions.
    *   **Champion:**  Opportunities to co-create content (polls, challenges, feedback requests).
    *   **Icon:**  Physical merchandise, invitations to exclusive events, personalized shout-outs.
*   **Gamification Elements:**  Implement progress bars, achievement badges, and leaderboards (segmented by tier) to further incentivize engagement.
*   **Dynamic Content Weighting:** The weighting of engagement components (like comments vs. likes) will *automatically adjust* based on entity goals. E.g., If the entity wants more in-depth discussion, comment weighting can be increased.
*   **API Integration:** An API endpoint to allow entities to customize tier thresholds, rewards, and content weighting.

**Pseudocode (Tier Calculation):**

```
function calculateTier(userID):
    totalScore = 0
    contentInteractionScore = calculateContentInteractionScore(userID)
    commentQualityScore = calculateCommentQualityScore(userID)
    consistencyScore = calculateConsistencyScore(userID)
    helpfulnessScore = calculateHelpfulnessScore(userID)

    totalScore = (0.3 * contentInteractionScore) + (0.4 * commentQualityScore) + (0.2 * consistencyScore) + (0.1 * helpfulnessScore)

    if totalScore >= 90:
        return "Icon"
    elif totalScore >= 75:
        return "Champion"
    elif totalScore >= 60:
        return "Luminary"
    elif totalScore >= 40:
        return "Advocate"
    else:
        return "Explorer"
```

**Future Considerations:**

*   **NFT Integration:**  Tier status could be represented by an NFT, providing verifiable proof of fandom and potential secondary market value.
*   **Decentralized Governance:**  Allow "Icon" tier fans to participate in decisions about platform features and content strategy.
*    **Personalized Reward Recommendations:** An ML model to suggest reward options tailored to individual fan preferences.
