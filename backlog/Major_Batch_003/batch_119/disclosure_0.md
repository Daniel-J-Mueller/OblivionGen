## Dynamic Trust Network Visualization & Prediction

**Concept:** Expand on the 'real-world interaction' detection to create a dynamic, visualized trust network. This goes beyond simple account recovery and evolves into a proactive security & social feature.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:**
    *   Social graph connections (as per the patent).
    *   Location data (opt-in, anonymized, coarse-grained – city level or broader).
    *   Device usage patterns (shared devices, frequent co-use).
    *   Communication metadata (frequency of messages, calls – *not* content).
    *   Publicly available event data (concerts, conferences – opt-in).
*   **Trust Score Calculation:**
    *   Real-world interaction frequency & recency (weighted).
    *   Network proximity (how close connections are to each other).
    *   "Vouch" System: Users can explicitly vouch for connections (with limited vouch capacity to prevent gaming the system).
    *   Anomaly detection: Deviations from established interaction patterns flag potential compromise.
*   **Visualization:**
    *   Interactive graph displayed within the social networking system.
    *   Nodes represent users.
    *   Edge thickness represents trust score.
    *   Color-coding indicates trust level (e.g., green = high, yellow = medium, red = low).
    *   Users control privacy settings: who can see their trust network, what data is shared.
*   **Prediction Engine:**
    *   Uses machine learning to predict potential trusted connections based on interaction patterns.
    *   Suggests connections to users ("You might trust X, based on your interactions with Y and Z").
*   **Account Recovery Integration:**
    *   Enhanced recovery flow leveraging the visualized trust network.
    *   Users can select trusted connections directly from the graph.
    *   System prioritizes connections with higher trust scores.
*   **Proactive Security Alerts:**
    *   Alerts users to suspicious activity on connections with low trust scores.
    *   Suggests reviewing connections if trust scores decline.
*   **API Access:**
    *   Allow third-party developers to integrate with the trust network (with user consent).

**Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(userA, userB):
  interactionScore = 0
  proximityScore = 0
  vouchScore = 0

  // Interaction Score (weighted)
  interactionScore = (recentLocationMatches(userA, userB) * 0.4) +
                   (sharedDeviceUsage(userA, userB) * 0.3) +
                   (communicationFrequency(userA, userB) * 0.2) +
                   (attendedSameEvent(userA, userB) * 0.1)

  // Proximity Score (based on network distance)
  proximityScore = calculateNetworkDistance(userA, userB) // Lower distance = higher score

  // Vouch Score
  if (userA vouched for userB):
    vouchScore = 0.5

  totalScore = interactionScore + proximityScore + vouchScore

  return totalScore
```

**Novelty:**  The patent focuses on *using* trust for recovery. This expands that to create a dynamic, visible trust network as a core feature of the platform, offering proactive security benefits and social discovery opportunities. It's less about 'proving' trust *during* a recovery event, and more about establishing and visualizing trust *continuously*.
