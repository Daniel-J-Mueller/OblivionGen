## Dynamic Keyframe Weighting based on Temporal Coherence

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on matching images to known locations using keyframes. This builds on that by introducing a system for dynamically weighting keyframes *within* a location’s database based on temporal coherence – how consistently a keyframe represents the location over time. This tackles issues arising from changing environmental conditions (lighting, seasons, temporary obstructions) or modifications to the environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Multi-Temporal Image Collection:**  A system to capture images of each known geographical location at varying times of day, seasons, and under different weather conditions.
*   **Keyframe Generation:** Existing keyframe extraction methods are utilized. Each location’s database stores a set of keyframes.
*   **Feature Extraction:**  For each keyframe, extract robust feature descriptors (e.g., SuperPoint, D2-Net) that are less sensitive to lighting and viewpoint changes.

**2. Temporal Coherence Calculation:**

*   **Sliding Window:** For each keyframe, define a sliding window representing a period of time (e.g., 1 week).
*   **Similarity Score:** Within the sliding window, compare the keyframe to newly captured images of the location (either from a continuous stream or scheduled captures).  Use a similarity metric (e.g., cosine similarity of feature descriptors, structural similarity index (SSIM)).
*   **Temporal Coherence Score:** Calculate a "Temporal Coherence Score" for the keyframe based on the average or weighted average of the similarity scores within the sliding window. Higher scores indicate greater consistency over time.
*   **Decay Function:** Implement a decay function to reduce the weight of older similarity scores, emphasizing more recent data.

**3. Dynamic Weighting & Matching:**

*   **Weight Assignment:** Assign a weight to each keyframe based on its Temporal Coherence Score.  Weights can be normalized to sum to 1.
*   **Weighted Matching:**  During localization, when comparing a captured image to the database, calculate a weighted sum of the matching scores for each keyframe, using the assigned weights.  Keyframes with higher Temporal Coherence Scores contribute more to the final matching score.

**4. Database Updates & Maintenance:**

*   **Periodic Re-evaluation:** Periodically re-evaluate the Temporal Coherence Scores of all keyframes to account for long-term changes in the environment.
*   **Keyframe Replacement:**  If a keyframe’s Temporal Coherence Score falls below a threshold, automatically trigger a process to capture new images and generate replacement keyframes.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Utilize anomaly detection algorithms on the temporal coherence scores to identify sudden changes in the environment (e.g., construction, natural disasters).

**Pseudocode (Matching Phase):**

```
function matchImage(capturedImage, locationDatabase):
  weightedScore = 0
  for each keyframe in locationDatabase:
    similarity = calculateSimilarity(capturedImage, keyframe) // e.g., using feature descriptors
    weightedScore += similarity * keyframe.temporalCoherenceWeight
  bestMatch = locationDatabase.keyframe with highest weightedScore
  return bestMatch
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Cameras for continuous image capture at known locations.
*   Edge devices for real-time feature extraction and similarity calculation.
*   Cloud infrastructure for database storage and management.
