## Dynamic Virtual Object Swarms & Collective Behavior

**Concept:** Expand the single virtual object guidance system into a swarm of objects exhibiting collective behavior influenced by user actions *and* data gleaned from a wider social network. Instead of guiding a user *to* an object, guide them *through* a responsive, evolving environment composed of virtual entities.

**Specs:**

*   **Entity Types:** Define multiple classes of virtual entities, each with distinct behaviors and visual characteristics (e.g., 'Seekers' - move towards user gaze, 'Reflectors' - mirror user movement, 'Observers' - passively track user, 'Guides' – lead toward specific areas).
*   **Swarm Control System:** Implement a physics-based simulation controlling the swarm. This system governs interactions between entities, user, and the virtual environment. Key parameters:
    *   *Cohesion*: How strongly entities stay together.
    *   *Separation*: How strongly entities avoid collisions.
    *   *Alignment*: How strongly entities align their movement with neighbors.
    *   *User Influence Radius*: Distance within which user actions directly affect swarm behavior.
*   **Social Network Integration:** Connect to a social network API. Analyze user posts, comments, and interactions related to virtual object categories. Derive collective ‘interest levels’ for each category. Map these levels to swarm density/behavior. Higher interest = denser swarm exhibiting more pronounced behaviors.
*   **Behavioral Triggers:** Define a set of triggers based on user actions (gaze direction, movement, vocal commands). Each trigger modifies swarm behavior within the user influence radius. Examples:
    *   *Focused Gaze*: Entities ‘flow’ towards the user’s focus point, forming a visual pathway.
    *   *Rapid Movement*: Entities disperse rapidly, creating a sense of urgency.
    *   *Vocal Command (“Show me X”)*: Entities relevant to “X” cluster around the user and move in a desired direction.
*   **Procedural Generation:** Implement a system to procedurally generate the swarm’s initial distribution and movement patterns. This system ensures the swarm’s behavior is unpredictable and engaging.
*   **Rendering System:** Optimised rendering system to handle large number of objects without performance issues. Support for different LOD based on distance.
*   **API:** Expose an API allowing developers to create custom entity types and behavioral triggers.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Update Loop):**

```
FOR EACH entity IN swarm:
    // Calculate force based on swarm rules
    cohesionForce = CalculateCohesion(entity, swarm)
    separationForce = CalculateSeparation(entity, swarm)
    alignmentForce = CalculateAlignment(entity, swarm)

    //Calculate influence of user
    userInfluenceForce = CalculateUserInfluence(entity, user)

    // Apply forces
    totalForce = cohesionForce + separationForce + alignmentForce + userInfluenceForce

    //Update position and velocity
    entity.velocity += totalForce * deltaTime
    entity.position += entity.velocity * deltaTime

    //Keep entities within bounds
    entity.position = Clamp(entity.position, environmentBounds)

    //Render entity
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond single object guidance to create a dynamic, reactive environment. The social network integration adds a layer of collective intelligence, making the experience more personalized and relevant. It isn’t about *finding* an object, it’s about *navigating* a space shaped by collective interests and individual actions.
