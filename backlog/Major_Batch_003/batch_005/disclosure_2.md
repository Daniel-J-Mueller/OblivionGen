## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Brush System

**Concept:** Extend the drawing functionality by integrating dynamic haptic feedback simulating various brush textures and resistances directly through the touchscreen.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Engine Integration:** Integrate a high-resolution haptic engine beneath the touchscreen capable of localized and dynamic force feedback. Resolution should be capable of simulating granular textures and varying resistance levels.
*   **Brush Texture Library:** Develop a software library containing data profiles for a wide range of simulated brush textures – oil paint, watercolor, charcoal, pencil, airbrush, calligraphy pen, etc. Each profile contains parameters defining the simulated friction, “give”, and granular texture characteristics.
*   **Real-time Texture Mapping:** Implement an algorithm that maps the user’s drawing stroke to the appropriate haptic feedback profile based on selected ‘brush’ type. The algorithm must analyze stroke speed, pressure, and angle to dynamically adjust the haptic feedback.
*   **Pressure Sensitivity Calibration:** Incorporate a calibration routine to account for individual user pressure variations and touchscreen sensitivity.
*   **Layered Haptic Effects:**  Allow for layered haptic effects to simulate complex materials (e.g., painting on canvas vs. painting on paper).
*   **Custom Texture Creation:** Provide a user interface for creating and saving custom haptic texture profiles. This UI should allow adjustment of parameters such as:
    *   Granularity (size and density of simulated particles)
    *   Friction Coefficient
    *   Elasticity/“Give”
    *   Texture Pattern (e.g., brush stroke direction, canvas weave)
*   **Haptic ‘Blending’:** Algorithm to smoothly transition between haptic profiles during a single stroke, allowing for complex effects such as changing brush types mid-stroke or blending colors.
*   **Audio Integration:** Synchronize haptic feedback with corresponding audio cues (e.g., brush sound, canvas texture noise) for enhanced immersion.  Sound and haptic profiles should be linked in the library.
*   **API Access:** Provide an API for third-party developers to integrate the haptic engine with their applications and create custom haptic experiences.

**Pseudocode – Haptic Feedback Loop:**

```
loop:
    get_user_input(touch_x, touch_y, pressure, angle, speed)
    selected_brush = get_current_brush()
    haptic_profile = get_haptic_profile(selected_brush)

    friction = haptic_profile.friction
    granularity = haptic_profile.granularity
    elasticity = haptic_profile.elasticity

    //Dynamic adjustment based on stroke characteristics
    friction = friction + (pressure * 0.1) //increase friction with pressure
    granularity = granularity + (speed * -0.05) //reduce granularity with speed

    //Send haptic feedback commands to the haptic engine
    send_haptic_feedback(touch_x, touch_y, friction, granularity, elasticity)
```
