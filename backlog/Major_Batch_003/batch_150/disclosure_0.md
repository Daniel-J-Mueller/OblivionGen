**Dynamic Contextual Recommendation "Bubbles"**

**Concept:** Expand on the recommendation engine by visualizing recommendations as interactive, spatially-aware "bubbles" overlaid onto live camera feeds (AR) or map views. These bubbles represent objects, locations, or experiences gleaned from the social network data *and* augmented by real-time environmental data.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   User's text post (as in the patent).
    *   Live camera feed from the user's device OR map location.
    *   Environmental data: time of day, weather, nearby points of interest (POI), ambient sound levels.
    *   Social network data (past comments, posts, connections).
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Query Extraction:** Parse the text post to identify the user's intent/query (as per patent).
    2.  **Relevance Scoring:**  Calculate a relevance score for potential recommendations based on:
        *   Social Network Data (frequency of mention, positive sentiment).
        *   Environmental Context (e.g., recommending an ice cream shop on a hot day).
        *   User Preferences (gleaned from past activity).
    3.  **Bubble Generation:**  Create AR "bubbles" (visual representations) for each relevant object/location.
        *   Bubble size = Relevance Score.
        *   Bubble color = Category (e.g., red = restaurants, blue = attractions).
        *   Bubble contains: Object name, rating (from social data), distance (if applicable), a small preview image/video.
    4.  **Spatial Anchoring:**  Anchor bubbles to their real-world location (using ARKit/ARCore or map coordinates). If the object isn’t physically locatable, anchor it relative to the user’s current viewpoint (e.g., a book recommendation “floating” in front of the user).
    5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Constantly update bubble size, color, and position based on user movement and changing environmental data.
*   **Output:**
    *   Augmented Reality view (via camera) OR Map View with overlaid bubbles.
    *   User Interaction:
        *   Tap a bubble to reveal more details (reviews, directions, booking options).
        *   "Pin" bubbles to create a personalized itinerary.
        *   "Share" bubbles with friends.
        *   Option to filter bubbles by category or relevance.

**Pseudocode (Core Processing Loop):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessRecommendationRequest(textPost, cameraFeed, userLocation)

    query = ExtractQuery(textPost)
    recommendations = GetRecommendations(query, userLocation)

    FOR EACH recommendation IN recommendations
        bubble = CreateBubble(recommendation)
        bubble.position = CalculateBubblePosition(recommendation.location, cameraFeed, userLocation)
        bubble.size = recommendation.relevanceScore
        bubble.color = recommendation.categoryColor
        DisplayBubble(bubble)
    END FOR

    //Continuously update bubble positions and sizes based on user movement and environmental changes

END FUNCTION
```

**Novelty:**  This moves beyond static lists of recommendations to a *dynamic*, spatially-aware experience. It blends social network data with real-world context, creating a more immersive and personalized recommendation system. It’s less about *telling* the user what to do and more about *showing* them possibilities within their immediate environment.
