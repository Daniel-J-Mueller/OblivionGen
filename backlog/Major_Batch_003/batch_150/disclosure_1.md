## Dynamic Slice Stitching for Multi-User AR/VR Experiences

**Concept:** Extend the network slicing concept to dynamically ‘stitch’ slices together for individual users based on their AR/VR application demands, creating a personalized, adaptive network experience. This goes beyond simple overload management to proactively optimize resources *before* congestion occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: AR/VR Application Profiler:**
    *   Function: Analyzes the AR/VR application running on the user’s device.
    *   Metrics: Bandwidth, latency sensitivity, jitter tolerance, required field of view (impacts bandwidth), interaction frequency (impacts latency).
    *   Output: A dynamic ‘application profile’ representing the real-time network requirements of the AR/VR application.  This is not static.
*   **Component 2: Slice Composition Engine:**
    *   Input: Application profile from Component 1, available slice characteristics (bandwidth, latency, reliability), user subscription level (priority).
    *   Function:  Determines the optimal combination of existing slices to meet the application’s needs.  Instead of *just* moving a user to a backup slice, this component might blend parts of multiple slices. This is accomplished via a weighted contribution.
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  Identify candidate slices based on bandwidth.
        2.  Filter slices based on latency constraints.
        3.  Calculate a ‘composite score’ for each slice combination using a weighted formula:
            `Composite Score = (BandwidthWeight * NormalizedBandwidth) + (LatencyWeight * NormalizedLatency) + (ReliabilityWeight * NormalizedReliability) + (PriorityWeight * UserPriority)`
        4.  Select the slice combination with the highest composite score.
*   **Component 3: Dynamic Packet Steering:**
    *   Function: Steers individual packets from the user’s device across the selected slice combination.
    *   Mechanism: Uses Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to classify packets based on application layer data.  High-priority packets (e.g., head tracking data) are steered to low-latency slices, while less critical packets (e.g., texture downloads) can utilize higher-bandwidth, less-critical slices.
    *   Consideration: This will necessitate a degree of buffering for reassembly, so the buffering logic will be critical.
*   **Component 4: Real-time Performance Monitoring & Adaptation:**
    *   Function: Continuously monitors the performance of the chosen slice combination (latency, jitter, packet loss).
    *   Mechanism: Closed-loop feedback system that dynamically adjusts packet steering weights and slice combinations based on real-time performance metrics.
    *   Logic: If latency on a primary slice increases, the system will automatically shift more traffic to lower-latency slices, even if it means sacrificing some bandwidth. This occurs in milliseconds.

**Pseudocode (Slice Composition Engine):**

```
function ComposeSlice(appProfile, availableSlices, userPriority):
  candidateSlices = FilterSlicesByBandwidth(availableSlices, appProfile.bandwidth)
  filteredSlices = FilterSlicesByLatency(candidateSlices, appProfile.latencySensitivity)

  for slice in filteredSlices:
    slice.normalizedBandwidth = slice.bandwidth / appProfile.bandwidth
    slice.normalizedLatency = appProfile.latencySensitivity / slice.latency
    slice.normalizedReliability = slice.reliability
    slice.compositeScore = (BandwidthWeight * slice.normalizedBandwidth) + (LatencyWeight * slice.normalizedLatency) + (ReliabilityWeight * slice.normalizedReliability) + (PriorityWeight * userPriority)
    slice.score = slice.compositeScore

  sortedSlices = SortSlicesByScore(sortedSlices)
  optimalSliceCombination = sortedSlices[0] // Select the highest-scoring slice

  return optimalSliceCombination
```

**Novelty:** The existing patent focuses on *reacting* to overload. This system *proactively* composes slices to *avoid* overload and optimize the AR/VR experience. This is more akin to a personalized network tailored to a specific application than simple failover.
