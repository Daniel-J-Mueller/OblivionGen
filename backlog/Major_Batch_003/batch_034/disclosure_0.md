**Dynamic Contextual Overlay for Shared Experiences**

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Expand the unidirectional/bidirectional streaming concept to encompass *any* shared digital experience (games, collaborative documents, browsing) visualized *within* the messaging thread itself, layered as an interactive overlay.  This isn’t about *watching* someone else, but *experiencing* with them, even passively.

**Components:**

*   **Experience Broker:** A service that mediates connections between users and available “experiences.” This isn’t limited to video; it's an API for integrating any digital activity. Think of it as a universal plugin architecture.
*   **Thread Canvas:** The messaging thread interface is enhanced to become a dynamic canvas.  Messages are still present, but act as “anchors” or markers within the active experience.  The canvas supports layering, transparency, and interactive elements.
*   **Experience Modules:**  These are plugins/modules that adapt specific digital experiences for display and interaction *within* the Thread Canvas. Examples:
    *   *Browser Module:* Displays a shared browsing session as a miniature viewport within the thread.
    *   *Game Module:* Renders a simplified, top-down view of a shared game session (e.g., a simple strategy game).
    *   *Document Module:* Enables collaborative editing of a document directly within the thread.
    *   *AR Module:* Integrates AR experiences, allowing users to view shared AR overlays.
*   **Contextual Anchors:**  User-generated or system-generated "anchors" (messages, timestamps, locations) that tie elements of the shared experience to the messaging thread.  These anchors provide context and allow users to rewind, fast-forward, or jump to specific moments.

**Workflow:**

1.  User A initiates a “shared experience” within the messaging thread.
2.  The Experience Broker identifies available experiences and presents options to User A.
3.  User A selects an experience (e.g., "Shared Browsing").
4.  The system generates a unique session ID.
5.  User A invites User B.
6.  User B accepts the invitation.
7.  The system renders the shared experience within the Thread Canvas, layered over the messaging thread.
8.  Both users can interact with the experience in real-time.
9.  Messages within the thread act as contextual anchors, allowing users to discuss specific moments or elements of the experience.
10. Users can seamlessly switch between interacting with the shared experience and continuing the text-based conversation.

**Pseudocode (Experience Broker):**

```
function GetAvailableExperiences(user_id):
  experiences = []
  // Query database for experiences compatible with user's profile and permissions
  experiences = database.query("SELECT * FROM experiences WHERE user_id = %s", (user_id,))
  return experiences

function LaunchExperience(user_id, experience_id, invitee_id):
  experience = GetExperienceDetails(experience_id)
  session_id = GenerateSessionID()
  CreateSession(session_id, user_id, invitee_id, experience)
  return session_id
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   **Rendering Engine:** A lightweight rendering engine capable of displaying various types of content within the Thread Canvas is required.
*   **Real-time Communication:** A robust real-time communication infrastructure is essential for synchronizing interactions between users.
*   **Security:** Security measures must be implemented to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access to shared experiences.
*   **Scalability:** The system must be scalable to accommodate a large number of users and experiences.
*   **Plugin Architecture:** A flexible plugin architecture is crucial for supporting a wide range of experiences.
