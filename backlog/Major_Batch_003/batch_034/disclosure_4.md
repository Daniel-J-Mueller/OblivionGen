## Dynamic Resolution Allocation Based on Per-Object Complexity

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic resolution selection based on convex hull analysis to operate at a *per-object* level within a video frame, rather than globally for the entire frame or segment. This allows for finer-grained optimization of bitrate allocation, focusing computational resources on complex areas and reducing them in simpler ones.

**Specs:**

1.  **Object Segmentation Module:** Integrate a real-time object segmentation algorithm (e.g., Mask R-CNN, YOLO with segmentation) into the encoding pipeline. This module identifies and segments distinct objects within each frame.

2.  **Complexity Metric:** Define a 'complexity score' for each segmented object. This score should combine multiple factors:
    *   **Motion Vector Variance:** Calculate the variance of motion vectors within the object’s bounding box. Higher variance indicates more complex motion.
    *   **Texture Variance:** Measure the variance of texture features (e.g., using a Laplacian filter or similar) within the object. Higher variance signifies more detailed textures.
    *   **Object Size:**  Larger objects generally require more bits to encode.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_complexity_score(object):
      motion_vector_variance = calculate_variance(object.motion_vectors)
      texture_variance = calculate_variance(object.texture_features)
      object_size = object.area()
      complexity_score = w1 * motion_vector_variance + w2 * texture_variance + w3 * object_size
      return complexity_score
    ```
    *(w1, w2, w3 are weighting factors determined through experimentation)*

3.  **Resolution Allocation Map:**  Create a resolution allocation map for each frame, based on the complexity scores of each segmented object.  
    *   Objects with high complexity scores are assigned a higher target resolution (e.g., 1080p or 4K).
    *   Objects with low complexity scores are assigned a lower target resolution (e.g., 720p or 480p).
    *   This creates a per-object resolution map.

4.  **Scalable Encoding Pipeline:** Utilize a scalable video codec (e.g., SVC, SHVC) to encode the frame with the per-object resolution map. This ensures that each object is encoded at its assigned resolution.

5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Implement a feedback loop to dynamically adjust the weighting factors (w1, w2, w3) in the complexity score calculation based on the achieved bitrate and quality metrics.

6.  **Convex Hull Integration:** Integrate the existing convex hull analysis from the cited patent as a *secondary* optimization layer. After the per-object resolutions are assigned, the convex hull analysis is applied to the *entire* frame to refine the bitrate allocation based on the overall performance boundaries. This provides both fine-grained (per-object) and coarse-grained (frame-level) optimization.

7.  **Bitrate Budgeting:** Distribute the total bitrate budget among the objects based on their assigned resolutions and complexity scores.

    ```pseudocode
    function allocate_bitrate(objects, total_bitrate):
      total_complexity = sum(object.complexity_score for object in objects)
      for object in objects:
        object.bitrate = (object.complexity_score / total_complexity) * total_bitrate * (object.resolution_factor)
      return objects
    ```
    *(resolution_factor scales bitrate according to the object’s resolution)*

8.  **Multi-Resolution Stream:** Output a multi-resolution stream that allows the decoder to reconstruct the frame at different levels of detail.

**Expected Outcomes:**

*   Significant bitrate savings without noticeable quality degradation, particularly in scenes with static or simple backgrounds.
*   Improved perceived quality in scenes with complex objects, as those objects receive a higher bitrate allocation.
*   More efficient utilization of computational resources.
*   Adaptability to various video content types.
