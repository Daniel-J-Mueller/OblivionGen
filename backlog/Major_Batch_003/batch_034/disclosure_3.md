## Proactive Reminder Chain Reaction – “Ripple”

**Concept:** Expand the proactive reminder system to not just *present* reminders, but to trigger a cascading series of connected, contextually-aware actions and information displays. Think beyond a simple notification, to a personalized “ripple” of assistance stemming from the initial reminder.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure: “Reminder Graph”**:  Instead of storing reminders as isolated entities, create a “Reminder Graph.” Each reminder node contains:
    *   Reminder Text
    *   Proactive Activation Conditions (as per the base patent)
    *   “Ripple Actions” - a list of associated actions/information displays.  These actions can be:
        *   Presenting additional information (weather, traffic, news)
        *   Initiating a task (e.g., "Start navigation to meeting")
        *   Querying another service (e.g., "Check flight status")
        *   Creating a new reminder (nested reminder)
        *   Adjusting smart home devices (e.g. turn on lights)
*   **Contextual Prioritization Engine:**  The system must analyze the user context *not just* for triggering the initial reminder, but for *prioritizing* and *filtering* the “Ripple Actions.”  The user's current activity, location, and stated preferences heavily influence what actions are presented, and in what order.
*   **Adaptive Ripple Intensity**: A “Ripple Intensity” setting, adjustable by the user, controls how aggressively the system initiates actions.
    *   Low Intensity: Only presents the initial reminder.
    *   Medium Intensity:  Presents the initial reminder + 1-2 high-priority Ripple Actions.
    *   High Intensity: Activates a broader range of Ripple Actions, potentially automating multiple tasks.
*   **“Echo” Feedback Loop**: The system monitors user interaction with Ripple Actions (e.g., dismissing, postponing, completing) and uses this feedback to refine future Ripple Action prioritization.  If a user consistently dismisses a certain type of action, it is downweighted in the algorithm.
*   **Multimodal Ripple Presentation**: Ripple Actions aren’t limited to notifications.  They can be displayed through various channels:
    *   Heads-up display (AR glasses)
    *   Smartwatch
    *   Ambient displays
    *   Voice assistant interactions
*   **“Chain Reaction” Triggers**:  Ripple Actions can themselves *trigger* further Ripple Actions.  This creates a cascading effect of assistance. (e.g., Reminder: "Pick up dry cleaning" triggers: "Check dry cleaner hours" -> "Navigate to dry cleaner" -> "Add 'pick up dry cleaning' to to-do list").

**Pseudocode (Ripple Action Evaluation):**

```
function evaluateRippleActions(reminder, userContext, rippleIntensity):
  // Get list of Ripple Actions associated with the reminder
  actions = getRippleActions(reminder)

  // Score each action based on relevance to user context
  scoredActions = []
  for action in actions:
    score = calculateRelevanceScore(action, userContext)
    scoredActions.append((action, score))

  // Sort actions by score (descending)
  sortedActions = sorted(scoredActions, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  // Filter actions based on Ripple Intensity
  if rippleIntensity == "Low":
    selectedActions = []
  elif rippleIntensity == "Medium":
    selectedActions = sortedActions[:2] // Top 2 actions
  else:
    selectedActions = sortedActions  // All actions

  return selectedActions
```
