## Dynamic Risk ‘Ecosystem’ Mapping & Predictive Cascade Analysis

**Concept:** Extend the LSH vectorization approach beyond individual risk characteristics to model *relationships* between risks as a dynamic ecosystem. This moves beyond identifying similar risks to *predicting* how mitigation of one risk affects others – positive or negative.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Input:** A ‘risk graph’ alongside standard risk characteristics. The risk graph represents known or suspected dependencies between risks (e.g., “Failure of System A increases probability of System B failure”). This graph isn’t static – it’s updated via event logging and anomaly detection.
*   **Vectorization Enhancement:**  Modify the LSH process to incorporate ‘relationship vectors’. Each risk gets a primary vector representing its characteristics (as in the patent).  Then, for each connected risk in the graph, a secondary ‘relationship vector’ is generated. This vector encodes the *type* and *strength* of the connection (positive correlation, negative correlation, probabilistic dependency).
*   **Ecosystem Vector:** Combine the primary and relationship vectors to create an ‘ecosystem vector’ for each risk. The ecosystem vector represents the risk *within the context of its interconnectedness*.
*   **Cascade Simulation:**  Implement a simulation engine that uses the ecosystem vectors to model the effect of applying a mitigation plan to one risk. This engine performs a ‘cascade analysis’:
    1.  Apply the mitigation plan to the target risk’s ecosystem vector.
    2.  Propagate the change to connected risks’ ecosystem vectors based on the relationship vectors.
    3.  Recalculate risk scores for all affected risks.
    4.  Repeat steps 2-3 for a defined number of iterations.
*   **Predictive Scoring:**  The simulation engine generates ‘predictive scores’ for each risk – indicating the likely change in risk score after mitigation. This allows for prioritization of mitigation plans based on maximizing positive impact and minimizing unintended consequences.
*   **Visualization Layer:** A dynamic graph visualization showing risks, their interdependencies, current risk scores, and predicted changes after mitigation. Color-coding indicates positive, negative, or neutral impacts.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Cascade Simulation):**

```
function simulate_cascade(target_risk, mitigation_plan, iterations):
  # Apply mitigation to target risk's ecosystem vector
  target_risk.ecosystem_vector = apply_mitigation(target_risk.ecosystem_vector, mitigation_plan)

  for i in range(iterations):
    for connected_risk in get_connected_risks(target_risk):
      impact = calculate_impact(target_risk.ecosystem_vector, connected_risk.ecosystem_vector, relationship_vector)
      connected_risk.ecosystem_vector = update_vector(connected_risk.ecosystem_vector, impact)

  return calculate_predictive_scores(all_risks)
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Real-time updates:** Integrate with event streams to dynamically update the risk graph and ecosystem vectors in real-time.
*   **Automated mitigation plan selection:** Use machine learning to identify optimal mitigation plans based on predicted outcomes.
*   **Scenario planning:** Allow users to define hypothetical events and simulate their impact on the risk ecosystem.
*   **Adversarial Simulation:** Introduce "attack vectors" to the ecosystem to test the resilience of the system and identify vulnerabilities.
