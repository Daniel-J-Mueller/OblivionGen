## Dynamic Feature Map Stitching for Multi-View Consistency

**Concept:** Extend the feature map updating process to incorporate information from multiple video streams/views of the same user simultaneously. This creates a more robust and consistent representation of the user’s identity and facial expressions, even with varying lighting conditions or partial occlusions.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multiple synchronized video streams (minimum of 2) of the same user, each with associated landmark data.
*   **Core Component:** *Multi-View Feature Map Aggregator (MVFMA)*. This module operates in parallel for each input stream, generating individual feature maps as described in the original patent. The MVFMA then stitches these feature maps together to create a unified representation.
*   **Stitching Algorithm:** Weighted averaging based on landmark consistency and image quality metrics (sharpness, brightness).  Higher weights are assigned to streams with more accurate landmark tracking and better image quality.
*   **Landmark Consistency Check:** A metric to assess how closely the landmarks in different streams align. Outlier streams (significant misalignment) receive reduced weighting.  Uses Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to refine alignment.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** The weights assigned to each stream are adjusted dynamically based on real-time conditions. If one stream experiences temporary occlusion or poor lighting, its weight decreases automatically.
*   **Occlusion Handling:** When an area of the face is occluded in one stream, the MVFMA prioritizes data from other streams to fill in the missing information. Leverages an occlusion map generated per stream. The weighted average blends information, but reduces the contribution from occluded regions.
*   **Output:** A unified, high-quality feature map representing the user’s identity and facial expressions.
*   **Hardware Requirements:** GPU with sufficient memory to handle multiple video streams and feature map processing in parallel.
*   **Software Libraries:** OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, ICP implementation.

**Pseudocode (MVFMA):**

```pseudocode
function aggregateFeatureMaps(videoStreams):
    featureMaps = []
    for stream in videoStreams:
        featureMap = generateFeatureMap(stream) // As per original patent
        featureMaps.append(featureMap)

    weights = calculateWeights(featureMaps)

    unifiedFeatureMap = 0
    for i, featureMap in enumerate(featureMaps):
        unifiedFeatureMap = unifiedFeatureMap + (weights[i] * featureMap)

    return unifiedFeatureMap
```

```pseudocode
function calculateWeights(featureMaps):
    weights = []
    for featureMap in featureMaps:
        weight = 1.0 // Base weight
        // Calculate landmark consistency score
        consistencyScore = calculateLandmarkConsistency(featureMap)
        weight = weight * consistencyScore

        // Calculate image quality score
        qualityScore = calculateImageQuality(featureMap)
        weight = weight * qualityScore

        weights.append(weight)

    // Normalize weights to sum to 1.0
    totalWeight = sum(weights)
    for i in range(len(weights)):
        weights[i] = weights[i] / totalWeight

    return weights
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced video conferencing quality in low-bandwidth environments.
*   More robust facial recognition in challenging conditions.
*   Improved avatar realism in virtual reality.
*   Security systems where multi-camera input is available.
