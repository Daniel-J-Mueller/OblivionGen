## Adaptive Model Specialization via Dynamic Sub-Graph Extraction

**Concept:** The patent details a system for updating a machine learning model based on resource availability. This inspires a system where the *model itself* is dynamically restructured – broken down into sub-graphs – to optimize for resource constraints and accelerate learning in specific domains. Instead of simply updating weights, the model’s architecture changes in real-time.

**Specs:**

1.  **Model Decomposition:** The primary ML model (e.g., a large neural network) is initially designed with inherent modularity – defined ‘sub-graphs’ representing specific functions or feature interactions. These sub-graphs are not merely layers, but self-contained units with defined inputs, outputs, and learning parameters.

2.  **Dynamic Sub-Graph Activation:** A ‘Sub-Graph Manager’ monitors resource availability (CPU, memory, power) and incoming data characteristics. Based on these factors, it activates only the relevant sub-graphs for a given prediction task.  A task needing high precision might activate more complex sub-graphs, while a quick, low-power task uses simpler ones.

3.  **Sub-Graph Learning Rates:** Each sub-graph has its own learning rate, allowing for faster adaptation in frequently used areas and slower learning in less common ones.  The Sub-Graph Manager dynamically adjusts these rates based on prediction accuracy and resource cost.

4.  **Sub-Graph ‘Swapping’:** If a sub-graph consistently underperforms or becomes resource-intensive, the Sub-Graph Manager can temporarily ‘swap’ it with a backup sub-graph trained on similar data. This provides fault tolerance and allows for continuous experimentation with different architectural designs.

5.  **Sub-Graph ‘Fusion’ & ‘Splitting’:**  Based on performance and data patterns, the Sub-Graph Manager can dynamically ‘fuse’ smaller sub-graphs into larger, more efficient units or ‘split’ larger sub-graphs into smaller, more specialized ones.  This happens *during runtime*, adapting the model’s architecture to the evolving data landscape.

**Pseudocode (Sub-Graph Manager):**

```
function manage_subgraphs(incoming_data, resource_status):
  active_subgraphs = []
  resource_threshold = get_resource_threshold(resource_status)

  for subgraph in all_subgraphs:
    cost = subgraph.get_resource_cost()
    relevance = subgraph.calculate_relevance(incoming_data)

    if cost <= resource_threshold and relevance > 0:
      active_subgraphs.append(subgraph)
      subgraph.update_learning_rate(get_optimal_learning_rate(subgraph, incoming_data))

  # Check for underperforming subgraphs
  for subgraph in active_subgraphs:
    if subgraph.get_performance() < threshold:
      swap_subgraph(subgraph)

  #Evaluate fusion and splitting potential
  evaluate_fusion_splitting(active_subgraphs)

  return active_subgraphs
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   FPGA or specialized AI accelerator for efficient sub-graph execution and swapping.
*   High-bandwidth memory for fast access to sub-graph parameters.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Edge devices with limited resources (e.g., smartphones, drones).
*   Real-time video processing and object detection.
*   Adaptive robotic control.
*   Personalized medicine – dynamic model specialization for individual patients.
