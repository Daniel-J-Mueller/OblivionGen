## Dynamic Focal Plane Adjustment via Multi-Camera Disparity

**Concept:** Extend dewarping beyond purely geometric correction to incorporate dynamic focal plane adjustment based on object depth estimation from multi-camera disparity. This allows for rendering a dewarped image with simulated depth-of-field effects, improving perceived realism and potentially enabling features like selective focus and object isolation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-camera array (minimum 3, ideally 5+). Cameras should be calibrated for intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Overlap is critical.
    *   High-speed processing unit (GPU/FPGA preferred) capable of real-time disparity map generation and image rendering.
    *   Optional: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for improved depth estimation and stabilization.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Stereo Disparity Engine:**  Algorithm (e.g., Semi-Global Matching, Block Matching) to generate a disparity map from the multi-camera input. Output: Disparity map (grayscale image where pixel value represents depth).
    *   **Dewarping Module:** (Based on the provided patent's core function) – Input: Original image, Crop Region, Disparity Map. Output:  Dewarped image with adjusted focal plane.
    *   **Focal Plane Adjustment Algorithm:**
        1.  **Depth Map Conversion:** Convert the disparity map into a depth map (using camera parameters).
        2.  **Focal Plane Determination:**  For each pixel in the crop region, determine its desired focus based on the depth map.  Pixels at the target depth should be in focus, while those further away or closer should exhibit blur.
        3.  **Blur Kernel Generation:** Generate a 2D Gaussian blur kernel dynamically based on the distance between the pixel’s depth and the target depth. Larger deviations result in larger kernel sizes/sigma values.
        4.  **Convolution Application:** Apply the generated blur kernel to the corresponding pixel in the dewarped image.
*   **Pseudocode (Focal Plane Adjustment Algorithm):**

```pseudocode
function adjustFocalPlane(dewarpedImage, depthMap, targetDepth, blurScale):
  for each pixel (x, y) in dewarpedImage:
    pixelDepth = depthMap[x, y]
    depthDifference = abs(pixelDepth - targetDepth)
    kernelSize = max(1, int(depthDifference * blurScale)) //Ensure kernel size is at least 1
    sigma = kernelSize / 3.0  // Adjust sigma as needed

    //Generate Gaussian blur kernel
    kernel = generateGaussianKernel(kernelSize, sigma)

    //Apply convolution
    blurredPixel = convolve(dewarpedImage, kernel, x, y)

    dewarpedImage[x, y] = blurredPixel
  return dewarpedImage
```

*   **Calibration Procedure:**  Rigorous multi-camera calibration is essential.  This includes:
    *   Intrinsic parameter estimation (focal length, principal point, distortion coefficients) for each camera.
    *   Extrinsic parameter estimation (rotation and translation) to determine the relative pose of each camera.
    *   Validation using a known 3D calibration target.
*   **Enhancements:**
    *   **Dynamic Target Depth:** Allow the target depth to be adjusted dynamically based on user input or object tracking.
    *   **Bokeh Simulation:**  Introduce simulated bokeh effects (highlights) to further enhance the realism of the depth-of-field.
    *   **Object Segmentation:** Integrate object segmentation algorithms to selectively apply the focal plane adjustment to specific objects in the scene.
    *   **IMU Integration:** Use IMU data to stabilize the depth estimation and compensate for camera motion.

This system moves beyond simple geometric correction to create a more visually compelling and informative dewarped image. It has potential applications in augmented reality, virtual reality, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).
