## Dynamic Story Weaving – Collaborative Temporal Narratives

**Concept:** Extend the ephemeral story channel concept beyond individual life events to create collaboratively authored, temporally-limited narratives shared amongst groups. Think of it as a shared, temporary "digital campfire" experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Group Story Channel Creation:**

*   **Initiation:** User initiates a “Story Weave” specifying:
    *   **Theme:** (Optional) Broad thematic guide (e.g., “Road Trip”, “Weekend Adventure”, “Inside Jokes”).
    *   **Duration:**  A defined lifespan for the Story Weave (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days, until a specific event).
    *   **Participants:**  A list of invited users.  Permissions can be set (e.g., view-only, contribute, moderate).
*   **Channel Creation:** A dedicated, ephemeral Story Weave channel is created, visually distinct from individual story channels.

**2. Contribution Mechanics:**

*   **Open Contribution (Default):**  All participants with “contribute” permissions can add story segments (images, videos, text) directly to the Story Weave.
*   **Prompt-Based Contribution:** The initiator or moderator can post “Story Prompts” – questions, challenges, or partial narratives – to guide contributions. (e.g., “Show us your favorite view”, “Continue the story…”, “What happened next?”).
*   **Segment Linking:**  Users can *link* their story segments to previous segments, creating a branching or linear narrative flow.  This linking is visually represented within the Story Weave interface.

**3. Temporal Mechanics & Archiving:**

*   **Lifespan:** Once the defined duration expires, the Story Weave channel is automatically archived and becomes inaccessible.
*   **Partial Archiving:** Option for the initiator to designate *specific* segments of the Story Weave for permanent saving, creating a curated “highlight reel”.
*   **Fragmented Replay:**  Archived Story Weaves can be replayed as a series of fragmented moments, re-experiencing the flow of contributions.

**4.  Interface Integration:**

*   **Dedicated Tab:** A “Story Weaves” tab within the Stories interface, displaying active and archived Weaves.
*   **Notifications:**  Notifications for new contributions to active Story Weaves.
*   **Visual Distinction:**  Story Weave channels will have a unique visual marker (e.g., woven border, shared color palette).

**Pseudocode (Contribution Flow):**

```
FUNCTION AddStorySegment(userID, weaveID, content, linkedSegmentID)
  IF UserHasPermission(userID, weaveID, "contribute") THEN
    CreateNewSegment(content)
    SetSegmentWeave(segmentID, weaveID)
    IF linkedSegmentID != NULL THEN
      LinkSegment(segmentID, linkedSegmentID)
    ENDIF
    NotifyWeaveParticipants(weaveID, segmentID)
  ELSE
    DisplayPermissionError()
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION

FUNCTION DisplayWeave(weaveID)
  segments = GetSegmentsForWeave(weaveID)
  SortSegments(segments, "chronological")  //Or "most liked", "random", etc.
  FOR EACH segment IN segments
    DisplaySegment(segment)
  ENDFOR
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Collaborative Editing:** Allow multiple users to edit a single story segment in real-time.
*   **Gamification:** Introduce challenges and rewards for contributions.
*   **AI-Assisted Storytelling:**  Use AI to suggest prompts, generate content, or curate the narrative flow.
*   **Location-Based Weaves:**  Tie Story Weaves to specific geographical locations.
