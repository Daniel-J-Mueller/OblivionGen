## Entity Relationship Graph with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the entity resolution system to create a dynamic, time-aware relationship graph. Instead of solely focusing on deduping records *at a single point in time*, model the *evolution* of entity attributes and relationships over time. This enables the system to understand how entities change, when attributes become unreliable, and predict future attribute values.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Structure:**  A graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph) with nodes representing entities (using the globally unique entity identifier from the patent) and edges representing attributes.
*   **Edge Attributes:** Each edge (attribute) has the following attributes:
    *   `attribute_name`:  The name of the attribute (e.g., "occupation", "address").
    *   `attribute_value`: The value of the attribute.
    *   `source_record_id`: Identifier of the record the attribute came from.
    *   `timestamp`: When the attribute was recorded.
    *   `reliability_score`: Initial score based on source trustworthiness (configurable).
    *   `decay_rate`:  Parameter controlling how quickly the attributeâ€™s reliability decreases over time. This could be attribute-specific.
*   **Temporal Decay Function:**  A function applied to the `reliability_score` over time. Example: `reliability_score = initial_reliability * exp(-decay_rate * (current_time - timestamp))`
*   **Conflict Resolution:** When multiple attributes exist for the same entity-attribute pair, prioritize based on:
    1.  Highest `reliability_score`.
    2.  Most recent `timestamp`.
    3.  Source trustworthiness.
*   **Prediction Module:** A time-series forecasting module (Prophet, LSTM) to predict future attribute values based on historical data.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `getEntityTimeline(entity_id)`: Returns the history of attributes for a given entity.
    *   `getPredictedAttribute(entity_id, attribute_name, prediction_date)`: Returns the predicted value of an attribute at a given date.
*   **Data Ingestion:** Modify the existing data-analyzing module to extract timestamps from data sources and populate the edge attributes.

**Pseudocode (Data Ingestion):**

```
function processRecord(record):
  entity_id = resolveEntityId(record)  // Existing functionality from patent
  timestamp = extractTimestamp(record)  // New functionality
  attributes = extractAttributes(record) // New functionality

  for attribute_name, attribute_value in attributes:
    // Check if attribute exists
    edge = findEdge(entity_id, attribute_name)
    if edge:
      // Update existing edge
      edge.timestamp = max(edge.timestamp, timestamp)
      edge.attribute_value = attribute_value
      edge.reliability_score = calculateReliability(source_record_id) // From patent
    else:
      // Create new edge
      createEdge(entity_id, attribute_name, attribute_value, timestamp, calculateReliability(source_record_id))

function calculateReliability(source_record_id):
  // Logic to determine reliability based on data source
  // (e.g., trusted sources get higher scores)
  return score
```

**Rationale:** This allows the system to not only consolidate entity data, but also understand *when* that data is valid.  This is crucial for applications where information changes rapidly (e.g., financial data, real-time location tracking, news feeds).  The predictive capabilities add a layer of intelligence, allowing the system to anticipate future entity states.
