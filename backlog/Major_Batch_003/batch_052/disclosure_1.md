## Adaptive Beamforming with UE-Specific Noise Shaping

**Concept:** Enhance MIMO performance and reduce inter-UE interference by not only selecting beams but actively *shaping* the noise floor experienced by each UE, creating a personalized interference null.

**Specs:**

*   **System Components:** Base Station (BS), Distributed Unit (DU), User Equipments (UEs). Existing SRS/CSI reporting pathways utilized.
*   **Noise Profile Mapping:** Each UE maintains a dynamic "Noise Profile Map" representing interference sources and sensitivity across the frequency spectrum. This map is constructed from:
    *   Received SRS from other UEs.
    *   CSI feedback (CQI, PMI, RI) augmented with explicit interference reporting.
    *   Real-time spectral analysis of received signals to identify spurious interference.
*   **Noise Shaping Algorithm:**
    1.  **Interference Prediction:** At the DU, predict the interference each UE will experience based on the Noise Profile Maps of other active UEs and channel conditions.
    2.  **Null Formation:** Generate a pre-coding matrix not just for signal maximization, but also to create targeted nulls in the predicted interference landscape for *each* UE.  This moves beyond simply nulling the signal from a specific interfering UE; it aims to reshape the overall noise floor to minimize perceived interference.
    3.  **Adaptive Weighting:**  Dynamically adjust the weighting between signal maximization and noise nulling based on UE priorities (QoS), channel conditions, and traffic demands.
    4.  **Precoding Matrix Construction:** Precoding matrix is composed of two components: a standard precoding matrix for signal transmission, and a supplementary matrix for noise shaping. This supplementary matrix is derived from the calculated noise nulls.
*   **Feedback Loop:** UEs provide feedback on the effectiveness of the noise shaping through metrics like SINR improvement and data throughput. This feedback is used to refine the Noise Profile Maps and the noise shaping algorithm.

**Pseudocode (DU-side):**

```
//For each RBG, for each UE in the selected subset
for RBG in ResourceBlockGroups:
    for UE in SelectedUEs:
        // 1. Predict Interference
        InterferenceMap = PredictInterference(UE, ChannelStateInformation, SRSReports);

        // 2. Calculate Noise Shaping Matrix
        NoiseShapingMatrix = CalculateNoiseShapingMatrix(InterferenceMap, TargetSINR);

        // 3. Compute Standard Precoding Matrix
        PrecodingMatrix = ComputePrecodingMatrix(UE, ChannelStateInformation);

        // 4. Combine Matrices: Weighted Sum
        CombinedMatrix = (α * PrecodingMatrix) + ((1 - α) * NoiseShapingMatrix); // α is weighting factor

        // 5. Apply Precoding
        PrecodedData = ApplyPrecodingMatrix(MultiUserData, CombinedMatrix);

        // 6. Transmit Data
        TransmitData(PrecodedData, UE);
```

**Hardware Considerations:**  Requires increased computational resources at the DU for real-time interference prediction and matrix calculations. Potential use of specialized hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs) to offload these tasks.
