## Dynamic Contextual Embeddings for Advertisement Targeting

**Concept:** Extend the inverted index feature generation to incorporate real-time contextual embeddings derived from multi-modal data (text, image, video) associated with both advertisements *and* user activity. This moves beyond static category paths and user engagement types to capture nuanced relevance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Sources:**

*   **Advertisement Data:** Text descriptions, images, video content, landing page content, associated keywords, category paths (as per existing patent).
*   **User Activity Data:** Browsing history, search queries, social media posts (with consent), location data (with consent), app usage, current device sensor data (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope).
*   **External Contextual Data:** News feeds, weather data, time of day, trending topics, current events.

**2. Embedding Generation:**

*   **Multi-Modal Embeddings:** Employ pre-trained multi-modal models (e.g., CLIP, DALL-E 2 inspired architectures) to generate vector embeddings representing the semantic meaning of advertisement content and user activity. These embeddings will be high-dimensional.
*   **Contextual Embedding Layer:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) or Transformer network will process the time-series data from user activity and external contextual data, generating a contextual embedding vector. This vector captures the userâ€™s current state and environment.
*   **Dynamic Weighting:** Implement a learnable weighting mechanism that determines the relative importance of advertisement embeddings, user activity embeddings, and contextual embeddings when forming the final combined embedding.

**3. Inverted Index Enhancement:**

*   **Embedding Storage:** Store the generated advertisement and user embeddings within an approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) index (e.g., Faiss, Annoy).
*   **Hybrid Indexing:**  Combine the existing category path-based indexing with the embedding-based indexing. This allows for both semantic and categorical matching.
*   **Real-time Updates:**  Continuously update the embeddings and indexes in real-time to reflect changes in advertisement content, user behavior, and contextual information.

**4. Neural Network Integration:**

*   **Embedding Input:** Pass the combined embedding vectors as inputs to the Deep and Wide Neural Network.
*   **Attention Mechanism:**  Implement an attention mechanism within the neural network to allow it to focus on the most relevant features within the embedding vectors.
*   **Personalized Normalization:**  Apply personalized normalization techniques to the embedding vectors, accounting for individual user preferences and biases.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Function to generate embedding for advertisement
def generate_ad_embedding(ad_text, ad_image, ad_category):
    # Multi-modal embedding generation
    text_embedding = generate_text_embedding(ad_text)
    image_embedding = generate_image_embedding(ad_image)
    category_embedding = generate_category_embedding(ad_category)
    # Combine embeddings
    combined_embedding = concatenate([text_embedding, image_embedding, category_embedding])
    return combined_embedding

# Function to generate contextual embedding for user
def generate_user_contextual_embedding(user_activity_history, external_context):
    # Process time-series data
    rnn = RNN() # Or Transformer
    contextual_embedding = rnn.process(user_activity_history, external_context)
    return contextual_embedding

# Main pipeline
def ad_targeting_pipeline(user_id, advertisement_list):
    user_activity = get_user_activity(user_id)
    external_context = get_external_context()

    user_contextual_embedding = generate_user_contextual_embedding(user_activity, external_context)

    candidate_ads = []
    for ad in advertisement_list:
        ad_embedding = generate_ad_embedding(ad.text, ad.image, ad.category)
        # Calculate similarity (e.g., cosine similarity)
        similarity_score = cosine_similarity(user_contextual_embedding, ad_embedding)
        candidate_ads.append((ad, similarity_score))

    # Sort ads by similarity score
    candidate_ads.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return candidate_ads
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPUs for embedding generation and neural network training.
*   Large-scale distributed storage for embedding indexes.
*   Low-latency network infrastructure for real-time data processing.
