## Dynamic Objectionable Content "Shadowing" with Probabilistic Propagation

**Concept:** Extend the demotion system to not just lower rank, but to *shadow* potentially objectionable content, actively reducing its reach through probabilistic propagation to connected content/accounts. This moves beyond simple demotion to a proactive "containment" strategy.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** `ShadowPropagationEngine`
*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   `ContentItem`: The content triggering the demotion process (as in the base patent).
    *   `ObjectionableSignalStrength`: A normalized value (0-1) representing the degree of objectionable content (derived from keyword analysis, user reports, etc.).
    *   `ConnectionGraph`: A dynamically updated graph representing connections between content items (shares, replies, related hashtags) and user accounts.  Nodes are content items and user accounts. Edges represent connections (share, reply, follow, hashtag co-occurrence).
    *   `PropagationRate`:  A configurable parameter determining how aggressively the shadow effect spreads. (0.0 - 1.0)
    *   `ShadowDecayRate`: A configurable parameter determining how quickly the shadow effect diminishes with distance from the originating content. (0.0 - 1.0)
    *   `AccountTrustScore`:  A value associated with a user account, calculated based on factors like account age, verification status, past behavior, and reporting history.
*   **Process:**

    1.  **Trigger:** When a `ContentItem` exceeds the demotion threshold (as defined in the base patent), the `ShadowPropagationEngine` is activated.
    2.  **Initial Shadow Value:** A `ShadowValue` is assigned to the triggering `ContentItem`, proportional to the `ObjectionableSignalStrength`.
    3.  **Graph Traversal:** The `ShadowPropagationEngine` traverses the `ConnectionGraph` starting from the triggering `ContentItem`.
    4.  **Shadow Propagation:** For each connected node (content item or user account):
        *   Calculate a `ReceivedShadowValue` based on the originating `ShadowValue`, the edge weight (representing connection strength), and the `ShadowDecayRate`. `ReceivedShadowValue = ShadowValue * EdgeWeight * ShadowDecayRate`.
        *   **Content Item Node:** If the node is a content item, apply a temporary rank reduction proportional to the `ReceivedShadowValue`.
        *   **User Account Node:** If the node is a user account, calculate an `AccountShadowScore` proportional to the `ReceivedShadowValue` and the `AccountTrustScore`.
    5.  **Account-Based Propagation:** For each user account with a significant `AccountShadowScore`:
        *   Identify content *created* by that account.
        *   Apply a temporary rank reduction to that content proportional to the `AccountShadowScore`.
    6.  **Decay and Re-evaluation:** The `ShadowValue` and `AccountShadowScore` decay over time. The system periodically re-evaluates connected nodes to account for changes in the `ConnectionGraph` and user behavior.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```python
def propagate_shadow(content_item, objectionable_signal_strength, connection_graph, propagation_rate, shadow_decay_rate):
    shadow_value = objectionable_signal_strength * propagation_rate
    queue = [content_item]
    visited = set()

    while queue:
        current_node = queue.pop(0)
        visited.add(current_node)

        for neighbor, edge_weight in connection_graph.get(current_node, {}).items():
            if neighbor not in visited:
                received_shadow_value = shadow_value * edge_weight * shadow_decay_rate

                if isinstance(neighbor, ContentItem):
                    neighbor.rank -= received_shadow_value  # Temporary rank reduction
                elif isinstance(neighbor, UserAccount):
                    account_shadow_score = received_shadow_value * neighbor.trust_score
                    # Apply shadow to content created by this account
                    for item in neighbor.created_content:
                        item.rank -= account_shadow_score

                queue.append(neighbor)
```

*   **Scalability Considerations:**  The `ConnectionGraph` could become very large. Implement graph partitioning and distributed processing to handle large-scale graphs efficiently.  Use caching to reduce the load on the graph database.
*   **Potential Benefits:** This system moves beyond simple demotion to proactively contain the spread of objectionable content. It leverages the network structure to identify and reduce the visibility of potentially harmful content *before* it reaches a wider audience.  It also discourages the creation and sharing of objectionable content by reducing the reach of accounts associated with such content.
