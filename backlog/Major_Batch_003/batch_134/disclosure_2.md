## Contextual Haptic Feedback System

**Concept:** Augment the visual text recognition with localized haptic feedback delivered via wearable devices (gloves, wristbands, or full-body suits) to enhance comprehension and interaction with recognized text in the real world.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Wearable haptic array (density adjustable based on application - reading, repair manuals, gaming).
    *   Low-latency wireless communication module (Bluetooth 6.0 or Wi-Fi 6E)
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for accurate hand/body pose tracking.
    *   Edge processing unit (integrated within wearable) for localized computation.
    *   Micro-vibration actuators (piezoelectric or similar) for precise haptic rendering.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Text-to-Haptic Translation Module:**  Transforms recognized text into haptic patterns.  This includes:
        *   **Character Mapping:** Assigns unique haptic signatures (frequency, intensity, pattern) to each alphanumeric character.  Emphasis on distinguishing easily confused characters (e.g., 'i' vs 'l', '0' vs 'O').
        *   **Grammatical Structure Encoding:** Uses varying haptic intensity/rhythm to represent sentence structure (e.g., stronger vibrations for subject/verb, pauses between clauses).
        *   **Semantic Highlighting:**  Identifies key terms/concepts (via knowledge graph integration - similar to patent claim 1) and encodes them with distinctive haptic signatures.
    *   **Contextual Awareness Integration:** Leverages visual context (from patent's image analysis) and user pose (from IMU) to refine haptic rendering.
        *   If the user is looking *at* a specific line of text, that line is rendered with stronger/more detailed haptics.
        *   If an object is identified alongside the text (patent claim 2), the haptic feedback is altered to reflect the object’s properties (e.g., “rough” vibration for sandpaper, “smooth” for glass).
    *   **Adaptive Learning Module:** Tracks user performance and dynamically adjusts haptic signatures to optimize comprehension and minimize cognitive load.
    *   **API/SDK:**  Allows integration with third-party applications (e.g., AR/VR platforms, assistive technology).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (running) {
    // 1. Acquire Visual Signals (from camera/AR headset)
    visual_signals = camera.capture();

    // 2. Recognize Text (using OCR model - patent claim 9)
    text = ocr.recognize(visual_signals);

    // 3. Object Detection (patent claim 2)
    objects = object_detect.detect(visual_signals);

    // 4. Context Determination (patent claim 1)
    context = context_engine.determine(visual_signals, text, objects);

    // 5. Text-to-Haptic Translation
    haptic_patterns = text_to_haptic.translate(text, context);

    // 6. Haptic Rendering
    haptic_device.render(haptic_patterns);

    // 7. User Feedback & Adaptation (Adaptive Learning Module)
    feedback = user.provide_feedback();
    adaptive_learning.update(feedback);
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Accessibility:** Provide tactile access to text for visually impaired users.
*   **Repair Manuals/Technical Documentation:** Guide users through complex procedures with tactile cues.
*   **Language Learning:**  Reinforce pronunciation and vocabulary with haptic feedback.
*   **Gaming/Immersive Experiences:**  Enhance immersion by providing tactile sensations associated with in-game text and events.
*   **Training/Simulation:**  Improve skill acquisition by providing tactile guidance during complex tasks.
