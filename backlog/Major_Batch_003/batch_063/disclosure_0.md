## Dynamic Latent Space Merging with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** The patent focuses on combining latent spaces derived from different "objects" associated with content. This builds on that by introducing *temporal decay* to the influence of each latent space, and a dynamic weighting system based on user interaction history *across* those object types.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `ObjectMetadata`: Stores metadata about content objects.
    *   `object_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `object_type`: (e.g., "product", "domain", "image").
    *   `last_updated_timestamp`: Timestamp of the last content update.
*   `UserHistory`: Stores user interaction data.
    *   `user_id`: Unique identifier.
    *   `object_id`: ID of the interacted-with object.
    *   `object_type`: Type of the interacted-with object.
    *   `interaction_timestamp`: Timestamp of the interaction.
    *   `interaction_weight`: Numeric value representing the importance of this interaction (initially 1.0).
*   `LatentVector`: Standard vector representation.

**2. Core Algorithm:**

1.  **Latent Vector Generation:**  For each `object_type` (product, domain, image, etc.), generate latent vectors for both the content item and the user, as described in the original patent.  Store these as `object_latent_vectors[object_type]` and `user_latent_vectors[object_type]`.

2.  **Temporal Decay Calculation:** For each `object_type`:
    *   Calculate `time_since_update` = `current_timestamp` - `last_updated_timestamp` (in days).
    *   Calculate `decay_factor` = `e^(-decay_rate * time_since_update)`.  `decay_rate` is a hyperparameter.  This means newer content has a higher influence.

3.  **User Weight Calculation:**  For each `object_type`:
    *   Retrieve all interactions for the user with objects of that type.
    *   Calculate an adjusted interaction weight for each interaction: `interaction_weight * e^(-age_decay_rate * (current_timestamp - interaction_timestamp))`. `age_decay_rate` is a hyperparameter controlling how quickly older interactions are downweighted.
    *   Calculate the total weighted interaction score for the user and object type.
    *   Normalize the total weighted interaction score to obtain a user weight (`user_weight[object_type]`) between 0 and 1.

4.  **Dynamic Latent Space Merging:**  Calculate the final content and user vectors:

    ```
    content_vector =  Σ (user_weight[object_type] * decay_factor * content_latent_vectors[object_type])
    user_vector =  Σ (user_weight[object_type] * decay_factor * user_latent_vectors[object_type])
    ```
    The summation is performed over all `object_type`s.

5.  **Scoring:** Calculate the similarity between `content_vector` and `user_vector` (e.g., using cosine similarity) to obtain the interaction score.

**3. Implementation Notes:**

*   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** `decay_rate` and `age_decay_rate` require careful tuning.  A grid search or Bayesian optimization approach is recommended.
*   **Scalability:**  Vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) can be used to efficiently store and query latent vectors.
*   **Cold Start Problem:**  For new users or content items with no interaction history, a default weight can be assigned.

**4. Novelty:**

This adaptation introduces temporal sensitivity and user-specific weighting to the latent space merging process, allowing the system to adapt to changing content relevance and user preferences over time. It addresses the static nature of the original patent's approach.
