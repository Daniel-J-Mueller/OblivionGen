## Dynamic Complexity-Aware Encoding Cascades

**Concept:** Instead of a single analysis/target encoder pairing, implement a cascade of encoders with dynamically adjusted complexity levels. This allows for a finer-grained optimization of encoding parameters based on the specific characteristics of each video segment and an evolving understanding of the target encoder's capabilities.

**Specifications:**

**1. Encoder Pool:** Maintain a pool of encoders, categorized by computational complexity (e.g., low, medium, high). Each complexity level represents a distinct codec or a configuration of the same codec.  

**2. Segment Analysis & Initial Assignment:** 
   * Divide source video into segments (shot detection as in the patent is a good starting point).
   * For each segment, perform a rapid, low-complexity analysis to estimate computational demand.  Metrics: motion vector density, texture complexity, scene change rate.
   * Initially assign each segment to a 'base' encoder from the pool, based on this analysis.

**3. Encoding Cascade & Iterative Refinement:**
   * Encode the segment using the base encoder, generating an initial encoded stream.
   * **Iteratively** refine the encoding by:
      * Decoding the encoded stream.
      * **Up-sampling to a 'reference resolution'** – a resolution higher than the initial downsampling, but still manageable.
      * Analyzing the reference-resolution decoded segment using a dedicated ‘Quality Estimation Module’ (QEM). QEM utilizes a lightweight neural network trained to predict perceptual quality metrics (e.g., VMAF, PSNR-SSIM) *without full decoding*.
      * Based on the QEM output, determine if the encoding quality is *sufficient* (defined by a user-set threshold).
      * If insufficient:
          * **Complexity Adjustment:**  Increase the encoding complexity level. This could involve:
              * Switching to a higher-complexity encoder from the pool.
              * Increasing quantization parameters within the current encoder (adjusting QP ranges).
              * Enabling more advanced encoding features (e.g., more motion estimation algorithms).
          * Re-encode the segment.
          * Repeat the process until the quality threshold is met *or* a maximum complexity level is reached.

**4. Dynamic Parameter Mapping:**
   * Maintain a dynamic parameter map *for each encoder pairing*.  This map is built and updated on-the-fly, based on the iterative refinement process.
   * The parameter map stores the optimal encoding parameters (QP, resolution, features) for a given input segment, based on the observed performance of different encoder configurations.
   * Parameter map construction relies on reinforcement learning. The 'agent' is the encoding system, the 'environment' is the video segment and target quality, the 'action' is the selection of encoder parameters, and the 'reward' is the achieved quality/bitrate tradeoff.

**5. Resource Management:**
    *  Implement a resource manager that dynamically allocates computational resources to the encoding cascade based on the complexity of the segments being processed.
    *  Prioritize segments with higher visual importance (e.g., keyframes, segments with significant motion) to ensure optimal quality.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each segment in video:
  initial_encoder = select_initial_encoder(segment)
  current_encoder = initial_encoder
  quality = 0
  complexity_level = 0

  WHILE quality < target_quality AND complexity_level < max_complexity:
    encoded_segment = encode(segment, current_encoder, parameters)
    decoded_segment = decode(encoded_segment)
    quality = estimate_quality(decoded_segment, QEM) 

    IF quality < target_quality:
      complexity_level += 1
      current_encoder = select_next_encoder(complexity_level)
      parameters = update_parameters(current_encoder, complexity_level) // Use dynamic parameter map

  final_encoded_segment = encoded_segment
  append(final_encoded_segment)
