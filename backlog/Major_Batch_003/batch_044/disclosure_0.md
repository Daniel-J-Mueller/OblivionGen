## Adaptive Event Prioritization & Predictive Sampling

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic sampling to not just *rate* limiting event data, but *prioritize* it based on predicted user impact or system criticality, then proactively sample at higher rates *before* a surge in those events occurs. This shifts from reactive to predictive sampling.

**Specification:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Event Impact Model:** A machine learning model (trained on historical usage data, user profiles, application behavior, and potentially real-time system metrics) to predict the ‘impact score’ of each event type. Impact is defined as a composite metric reflecting potential user frustration, system load, or business value loss. Input features: event frequency, user segment, application type, time of day, geo-location, etc. Output: a continuous ‘impact score’ (0.0 – 1.0).
*   **Predictive Sampling Engine:**  A component that uses the Event Impact Model’s output to dynamically adjust sampling rates *before* event surges. This engine monitors incoming event rates and, when a predicted surge in high-impact events is detected, proactively increases the sampling rate for those events.
*   **Tiered Data Storage:** Three-tier storage system:
    *   **Tier 1 (Fast):**  Stores a small, highly representative sample of *all* events, plus *all* instances of high-impact events (determined by a threshold).
    *   **Tier 2 (Medium):** Stores a larger, randomly sampled subset of all events.
    *   **Tier 3 (Slow):** Stores the raw, unfiltered event stream (for archival/audit purposes).
*   **Feedback Loop:** System continuously monitors the performance of the Event Impact Model (correlation between predicted impact scores and actual user behavior/system metrics) and adjusts model weights accordingly.

**2. Data Flow & Algorithm:**

1.  **Event Ingestion:**  Application events are ingested into the system.
2.  **Impact Score Prediction:** The Event Impact Model predicts an impact score for each event type.
3.  **Sampling Rate Adjustment:** The Predictive Sampling Engine adjusts the sampling rate for each event type based on:
    *   Current event rate.
    *   Predicted future event rate (using time series forecasting).
    *   Impact score.
    *   Storage capacity.
4.  **Tiered Storage:** Events are stored in the appropriate tier based on sampling rate and impact score.
5.  **Report Generation:** Reports are generated using data from all tiers.

**3. Pseudocode (Predictive Sampling Engine):**

```
function adjust_sampling_rate(event_type, current_rate, predicted_rate, impact_score):
  max_rate = 1.0  // Maximum sampling rate
  base_rate = current_rate  // Start with current rate

  // Adjust based on predicted rate
  if predicted_rate > current_rate:
    rate_increase = (predicted_rate - current_rate) * 0.5  // Increase by 50% of the difference
    base_rate = min(base_rate + rate_increase, max_rate)

  // Adjust based on impact score
  impact_factor = impact_score * 0.3  // Max increase of 30%
  base_rate = min(base_rate + impact_factor, max_rate)

  // Ensure minimum sampling rate (to avoid data loss)
  min_rate = 0.01
  adjusted_rate = max(adjusted_rate, min_rate)

  return adjusted_rate
```

**4.  Additional Considerations:**

*   **User Segmentation:**  Tailor the Impact Model and sampling rates to specific user segments.
*   **Real-time Anomaly Detection:** Integrate anomaly detection to identify unexpected events and adjust sampling rates accordingly.
*   **A/B Testing:** Experiment with different Impact Model configurations and sampling strategies to optimize performance.
*   **Privacy:**  Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations when collecting and storing user data.
