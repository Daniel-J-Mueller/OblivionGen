## Dynamic Predictive Buffering & Multi-Source Stitching

**Concept:** Expand the rolling buffer concept to not only capture data for repair, but to *predict* potential quality drops and proactively stitch together content from multiple redundant sources *before* a disruption occurs.

**Specs:**

*   **Multi-Source Input:** System accepts live feeds from N redundant sources (N > 1) transmitting the same media content. Sources could be geographically diverse broadcast towers, satellite uplinks, or even multiple encoders within a single broadcast facility.
*   **Predictive Analytics Engine:** A dedicated engine analyzes incoming data streams (audio levels, packet loss, network latency, source health metrics) in real-time.  Uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical data to predict potential quality drops *before* they manifest.  Key input features:
    *   Audio Variance (short & long term)
    *   Packet Loss Rate (per source)
    *   Network Jitter (per source)
    *   Source Signal Strength
    *   Correlation between source streams
*   **Dynamic Buffer Allocation:** Rolling buffers aren’t static size.  The size of each source’s buffer is dynamically adjusted based on the Predictive Analytics Engine’s assessment of its reliability. High-reliability sources get smaller buffers; low-reliability sources get larger ones.  The system aims to maintain a *total* buffer size limit.
*   **Seamless Stitching Algorithm:**  Algorithm identifies the point of predicted disruption *before* it occurs. It then stitches together frames from the most reliable sources *prior* to the disruption, creating a seamless transition.
    *   Frame matching is done via perceptual hashing (pHash) to ensure visual consistency.
    *   Audio synchronization is critical; uses cross-correlation techniques for precise alignment.
*   **Source Health Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of all input sources.  Sources that consistently degrade or fail are automatically removed from consideration. A weighting system is applied to sources to prefer healthier streams.
*   **Metadata Integration:** Integrate timestamps and source IDs into buffered frames for accurate stitching and recovery.
*   **Output Encoding:** Encodes the stitched stream using a robust codec (e.g., H.265, AV1) to minimize bandwidth requirements and ensure high-quality playback.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Algorithm):**

```
function stitch_stream(current_frame, predicted_disruption_time, source_streams):
  // source_streams is a list of streams with associated health metrics
  
  best_source = select_best_source(source_streams) // based on health, reliability
  
  if best_source == current_frame.source:
      return current_frame // no need to stitch
  
  // Find the closest matching frame in best_source near predicted_disruption_time
  matching_frame = find_closest_frame(best_source, predicted_disruption_time)
  
  // Crossfade or blend the frames for a smooth transition.
  stitched_frame = blend_frames(current_frame, matching_frame)
  
  stitched_frame.source = best_source //set source
  
  return stitched_frame
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance multi-core processor.
*   Significant RAM (64GB+).
*   High-speed network interface(s) for receiving multiple streams.
*   Dedicated GPU for accelerated video processing and AI inference.
*   Large capacity, high-speed storage (SSD or NVMe).
