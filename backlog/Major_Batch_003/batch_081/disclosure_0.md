## Dynamic Thread ‘Temperature’ & Contextual Sponsorship

**Concept:** Introduce a ‘temperature’ metric for each thread, reflecting user engagement *intensity* beyond simply ‘read/unread’. This temperature influences both thread prioritization *and* the type of sponsorship displayed. 

**Specification:**

**1. Thread Temperature Calculation:**

*   **Base Temperature:**  Initialized at a low value (e.g., 20) upon thread creation.
*   **Engagement Factors:**  Increase temperature:
    *   Message Sends: +5 per message sent by the user.
    *   Media Shares (images, videos, links): +10
    *   Reactions (likes, emojis): +2
    *   Time Spent Viewing (per minute): +1
*   **Decay Rate:** Temperature decreases over time if no interaction occurs (e.g., -0.5 per hour).  A minimum temperature floor (e.g., 0) is maintained.
*   **Formula:** `Temperature = Base + Σ(EngagementFactors) - Σ(DecayRate * TimeSinceLastInteraction)`

**2. Dynamic Thread Prioritization:**

*   Threads are ranked based on a combined score: `Priority = Temperature * (1 + RecentMessageModifier)`
*   `RecentMessageModifier` is a boost applied to threads with messages received within the last X minutes (e.g., X=15). This prioritizes active conversations.  The modifier could scale linearly or exponentially with time.

**3. Contextual Sponsorship Mapping:**

*   **Sponsorship Tiers:** Define sponsorship types (e.g., Tier 1: Generic offers, Tier 2: Related products/services, Tier 3: Highly personalized recommendations).
*   **Temperature-Based Tier Selection:**
    *   Temperature < 30: Display Tier 1 sponsorships.
    *   30 <= Temperature < 60: Display Tier 2 sponsorships.
    *   Temperature >= 60: Display Tier 3 sponsorships.
*   **Content Analysis for Tier 3:**  When Temperature >= 60, analyze the thread content (keywords, entities) to determine user interests and display highly relevant, personalized sponsorship content.  This could involve integration with external recommendation engines.

**4.  UI/UX Considerations:**

*   Sponsorship integration should be seamless and non-intrusive.
*   A subtle visual indicator (e.g., a heat map overlay) could show the relative ‘temperature’ of threads to provide the user with at-a-glance awareness.
*   Users should have control over the level of personalization in sponsorships (e.g., an option to disable content analysis).

**Pseudocode (Sponsorship Selection Logic):**

```
function select_sponsorship(thread):
  temperature = calculate_thread_temperature(thread)
  if temperature < 30:
    sponsorship_tier = 1
  elif temperature < 60:
    sponsorship_tier = 2
  else:
    sponsorship_tier = 3
    if sponsorship_tier == 3:
      relevant_keywords = extract_keywords_from_thread(thread)
      recommended_content = get_personalized_recommendation(relevant_keywords)
  return get_sponsorship_content(sponsorship_tier, recommended_content)
```
