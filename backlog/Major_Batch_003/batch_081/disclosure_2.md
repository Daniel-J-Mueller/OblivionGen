**Dynamic Difficulty & Benefit Scaling based on Viewer Skill/Profile**

**Concept:** Expand the existing call-to-action system to dynamically adjust the difficulty of interactions *and* the value of benefits based on an inferred skill level or pre-defined profile of the viewer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Viewer Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate data from:
    *   Viewing history (content types, duration).
    *   Interaction history (past CTA responses, accuracy).
    *   Optional account linkage (gaming platforms, social media – with explicit user consent).
    *   Real-time performance metrics (response time on CTAs).
*   **Skill/Profile Inference:**
    *   Employ a machine learning model to estimate viewer skill/profile based on combined data.  Categories could include: "Casual", "Enthusiast", "Expert".  The model should output a skill score ranging from 0-1.
    *   Maintain a rolling average of performance data to refine the skill assessment over time.
    *   Implement privacy controls allowing users to opt-out of profile creation or modify inferred attributes.

**2. Dynamic CTA Configuration Module:**

*   **Difficulty Adjustment:**
    *   Based on the viewer's skill score, adjust CTA parameters:
        *   **Response Time:** Lower time limits for higher-skill viewers.
        *   **Complexity:** Increase the number of steps or cognitive load in the CTA for higher-skill viewers.  Example:  "Identify the object" (easy) -> "Identify the object *and* its historical significance" (hard).
        *   **Accuracy Required:** Increase the percentage of correct responses needed to succeed.
    *   Implement tiered difficulty levels (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard) corresponding to skill score ranges.
*   **Benefit Scaling:**
    *   Scale the value of the benefit awarded proportionally to the difficulty level of the CTA *and* the viewer’s skill score.  Example:
        *   Easy CTA, Low Skill: Small discount code.
        *   Hard CTA, High Skill: Exclusive item, large discount, early access.
    *   Introduce a ‘risk/reward’ mechanic: Higher difficulty CTAs offer significantly greater benefits, incentivizing skilled viewers to participate.

**3. Real-Time Integration Module:**

*   **API Endpoint:** Expose an API endpoint to receive viewer skill scores and CTA configurations from the broadcaster’s system.
*   **Dynamic CTA Generation:**  Generate customized CTA elements (visuals, text, interaction mechanics) based on the received data.
*   **Event Tracking:**  Track CTA interactions, response times, and success rates to provide feedback to the skill assessment model.

**Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Broadcaster sets base CTA details (question, reward)
cta = {question: "...", reward: "...", difficulty: "medium"};

// Viewer connects
viewer = {id: "...", skill_score: 0.5};

// System retrieves viewer skill score

// Adjust difficulty based on skill score
if (viewer.skill_score > 0.7) {
    cta.difficulty = "hard";
    cta.reward = "premium_item";
} else if (viewer.skill_score < 0.3) {
    cta.difficulty = "easy";
    cta.reward = "small_discount";
}

// Generate CTA element with adjusted parameters
cta_element = generate_cta(cta);

// Display CTA element to viewer
display_cta(cta_element);

// Track viewer response
response = get_viewer_response();

// Award benefit based on response
if (response.correct) {
    award_benefit(viewer, cta.reward);
}
```
