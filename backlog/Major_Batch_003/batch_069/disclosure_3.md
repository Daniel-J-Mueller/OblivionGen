## Dynamic Multi-Perspective Storyboarding

**Concept:** Extend the object-tracking and text-overlay capability to facilitate the creation of dynamic, multi-perspective storyboards directly within the media presentation system. Imagine a collaborative storytelling tool built *into* the viewing experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Functionality: Perspective Capture & Stitching**

*   **Multi-Device Input:** The system will accept simultaneous video streams from multiple mobile devices (minimum 3, scalable to 10+). Each device represents a "capture point" or perspective.
*   **Spatial Calibration:**  Implement a quick, user-guided spatial calibration process. Utilizing device accelerometers and cameras, the system estimates the relative positions of each capture device in a 3D space. This doesn’t need absolute precision, just sufficient to create a coherent visual ‘stage’. (Think ARKit/ARCore-lite integration)
*   **Object-Centric Stitching:**  When a key object (detected via the patent's object detection) is present in multiple streams, the system will dynamically stitch together portions of each video to create a composite view. This could be:
    *   **Panoramic View:** Seamlessly blending the streams to create a wider field of view, following the object.
    *   **Dynamic Zoom/Rotate:** Allowing users to ‘fly around’ the object, switching between perspectives.
    *   **Split Screen/Picture-in-Picture:** Presenting multiple perspectives simultaneously.
*   **Perspective Locking:** Users can “lock” a specific perspective to maintain a consistent viewpoint.

**2.  Interactive Storyboard Creation**

*   **Keyframe Extraction:** The system automatically identifies key moments within the combined streams where significant object interactions or changes occur.
*   **Timeline Editor:** A simplified timeline editor allows users to select keyframes and arrange them in a desired sequence.
*   **Annotation Layer:**  Beyond text overlays (as in the patent), the annotation layer will support:
    *   **3D Objects:** Users can add simple 3D objects (arrows, highlights, shapes) to the scene to emphasize elements or guide attention.
    *   **Audio Notes:**  Voice recordings can be attached to keyframes for narration or commentary.
    *   **Motion Graphics:**  Basic animated elements (e.g., animated arrows, pulsing highlights) can be added to emphasize movement or draw attention.
*   **AI-Assisted Storyboarding:**
    *   **Scene Segmentation:** Automatically divide the combined video into coherent “scenes” based on object movement and scene changes.
    *   **Action Proposal:** Suggest potential keyframes based on detected actions (e.g., “object X moves to position Y”, “character A interacts with character B”).

**3.  Rendering & Output**

*   **Dynamic Compositing:** The final storyboard is rendered dynamically, allowing users to adjust perspectives, annotations, and transitions in real-time.
*   **Export Formats:** Support exporting the storyboard as:
    *   **Video File:** A standard video file with composited footage and annotations.
    *   **Interactive Presentation:** A navigable presentation that allows users to explore different perspectives and annotations.
    *   **AR/VR Experience:**  Export the storyboard as a basic AR/VR experience, allowing users to view the scene from different angles in a more immersive environment.



**Pseudocode (Core Stitching Logic):**

```
function stitch_streams(stream_list, object_id):
  //stream_list is list of video streams
  //object_id is object to track in the streams

  composite_frame = new Frame()

  for stream in stream_list:
    object_bounding_box = detect_object(stream, object_id)

    if object_bounding_box is not null:

      //Calculate a transformation matrix to align the stream's perspective to a chosen "master" perspective
      transformation_matrix = calculate_perspective_transformation(stream, object_bounding_box, master_stream)

      //Apply the transformation to the stream's frame
      transformed_frame = apply_transformation(stream.current_frame, transformation_matrix)

      //Composite the transformed frame onto the composite frame. Blending modes as needed.
      composite_frame = composite(composite_frame, transformed_frame)

  return composite_frame
```

This system transforms the passive viewing experience into an active creation tool, leveraging object tracking to enable a new form of dynamic storytelling and collaborative content creation. It's geared towards a different goal, from 'observing' to 'authoring'.
