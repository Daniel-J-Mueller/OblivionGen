## Dynamic Focus Grouping & AI-Driven Scene Construction

**Concept:** Expand on the idea of prioritizing video streams based on user importance, but move beyond simple quality adjustments. Introduce *dynamic focus grouping* where AI constructs coherent "scenes" for each participant, blending video, shared content, and contextual data into personalized views.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Contextual Layer:**

*   **Input Streams:** Primary video feed, shared content (screen share, documents), audio, user interaction data (mouse movement, keyboard input, gaze tracking if available), social networking data (as per patent), real-time sentiment analysis (audio and video).
*   **Contextual Data Sources:** Calendar information (meeting purpose), project management tools (relevant documents/tasks), CRM data (participant roles/relationships).
*   **Data Fusion:** Combine all data streams into a unified contextual layer. Timestamp synchronization is critical.

**2. AI Scene Construction Engine:**

*   **Object Detection & Segmentation:** AI identifies objects and participants within the video feed, and segments the frame.
*   **Semantic Understanding:** AI analyzes the content of shared materials (text, images, code) to extract key concepts.
*   **Scene Graph Generation:** Construct a scene graph representing relationships between objects, participants, and content. Nodes represent entities, edges represent interactions.
*   **Personalized Scene Layout:** Based on user importance (from patent's social graph) and contextual data, the AI generates a unique layout for each participant's view. This includes:
    *   **Dynamic Zoom/Crop:** Focus on the active speaker or shared content.
    *   **Content Highlighting:** Highlight relevant sections of shared documents based on the discussion.
    *   **Annotation Overlay:** Display contextual information (e.g., project tasks, CRM data) as overlays on the video feed.
    *   **Virtual Backgrounds:** Generate personalized virtual backgrounds that reflect the meeting context.
*   **AI-Driven Transition Effects:** Seamlessly transition between different layouts and viewpoints.

**3. Client-Side Rendering & Adaptive Streaming:**

*   **Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG):** Utilize SVG for UI elements and annotations to ensure high resolution and responsiveness.
*   **Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:** Adjust video quality based on network conditions and user device capabilities.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Leverage GPU for rendering and video processing.
*   **Client-Side Scene Composition:** Offload scene composition to the client device to reduce server load.

**Pseudocode (Scene Construction Engine):**

```
function constructScene(participantData, contextData, videoFeed, sharedContent):
    sceneGraph = createSceneGraph(videoFeed, sharedContent)
    importanceScore = participantData.importanceScore
    contextualRelevance = calculateContextualRelevance(contextData, sceneGraph)
    layout = generateLayout(sceneGraph, importanceScore, contextualRelevance)
    annotations = generateAnnotations(contextData, sceneGraph)
    composedScene = composeScene(layout, annotations, videoFeed, sharedContent)
    return composedScene
```

**Novelty:**

This expands the patentâ€™s concept of prioritizing video streams to a much more sophisticated level, moving beyond quality adjustments to dynamic scene construction.  It introduces contextual awareness and AI-driven composition to create a personalized and immersive video conferencing experience.  The use of scene graphs and AI-driven composition is novel in the context of video conferencing.
