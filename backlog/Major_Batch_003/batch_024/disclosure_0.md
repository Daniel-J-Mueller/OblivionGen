## Dynamic Action Weighting & Predictive Engagement

**Concept:** Expand upon the tracking of user actions *beyond* simple identification. Introduce a dynamic weighting system for actions, coupled with predictive modeling to anticipate user needs and proactively offer relevant information or services *through* the third-party system.

**Specs:**

**1. Action Weighting Engine (AWE):**

*   **Input:** Raw action data (from the provided patent - purchase, view, add to cart, etc.) + contextual data (time of day, user demographics - anonymized/aggregated, browsing history - limited to third-party domain, device type).
*   **Process:**
    *   AWE maintains a continuously updated weight for each action type. Weights are determined via a multi-armed bandit algorithm (e.g., Thompson Sampling) or Reinforcement Learning.
    *   Initial weights are assigned heuristically (e.g., purchase = 1.0, add to cart = 0.5, view = 0.2).
    *   Weights are adjusted based on downstream user behavior. If a "view" consistently leads to a purchase, the "view" weight increases.
    *   AWE considers *action sequences*. A "view" followed by an "add to cart" carries more weight than a standalone "view".  Sequence weighting utilizes Markov Chains to model action probabilities.
*   **Output:**  A weighted "engagement score" for each user, reflecting their immediate and predicted intent.

**2. Predictive Engagement Module (PEM):**

*   **Input:** Weighted engagement score (from AWE), user profile (anonymized), real-time data from third-party system (e.g., currently viewed product category, search query).
*   **Process:**
    *   PEM utilizes a machine learning model (e.g., Recurrent Neural Network or Transformer) trained on historical user behavior to predict the user's next likely action.
    *   Prediction horizon: short-term (next few minutes) to medium-term (next hour).
    *   PEM identifies "engagement thresholds".  When a user's engagement score exceeds a threshold, a specific action is triggered.
*   **Output:**  A targeted "engagement signal" transmitted to the third-party system. Signals include:
    *   **Content Recommendation:**  Suggest specific products or information.
    *   **Proactive Support:** Initiate a chat session or offer help.
    *   **Personalized Offers:** Display relevant promotions.
    *   **Automated Workflow:** Trigger a specific action within the third-party system (e.g., pre-populate a form).

**3. Third-Party System Integration:**

*   **API Endpoint:** Online system exposes a secure API for third-party systems to:
    *   Register for engagement signals.
    *   Transmit user action data.
    *   Receive engagement signals.
*   **Signal Format:** JSON payload containing:
    *   User ID (anonymized).
    *   Engagement Signal Type (e.g., "recommend_product", "offer_discount").
    *   Signal Payload (e.g., product ID, discount amount).

**Pseudocode (PEM):**

```
function predict_next_action(user_id, current_state):
  engagement_score = AWE.get_engagement_score(user_id)
  user_profile = get_user_profile(user_id)
  input_data = combine(engagement_score, user_profile, current_state)
  predicted_action = ML_Model.predict(input_data)
  return predicted_action

function generate_engagement_signal(predicted_action):
  if predicted_action == "purchase_likely":
    signal_type = "offer_discount"
    signal_payload = get_relevant_discount(user_id)
  elif predicted_action == "information_seeking":
    signal_type = "recommend_content"
    signal_payload = get_relevant_article(user_id)
  else:
    signal_type = "no_action"
    signal_payload = {}

  return signal_type, signal_payload
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond passively tracking actions to *actively influencing* user behavior in real-time. It leverages machine learning to predict user needs and deliver targeted interventions through the third-party system, creating a more engaging and personalized experience. It doesn’t just *see* what users do, it *anticipates* what they’ll do and adapts accordingly.
