## Adaptive Instruction Granularity & Parallel Decoding

**Concept:** This system builds upon the delta encoding concepts in the provided patent, but introduces *adaptive* granularity of encoding and parallel decoding pipelines tailored to the machine learning workload. Instead of fixed bit or instruction-level deltas, the system dynamically chooses the size of the ‘delta unit’ – a block of bits – to encode differences.  Furthermore, multiple of these adaptive delta units are decoded in parallel.

**Specifications:**

**1. Delta Unit Selector (DUS):**

*   **Input:**  Instruction stream, workload characteristics (e.g., layer type, data distribution), historical decoding latency data.
*   **Function:**  Analyzes the instruction stream and workload characteristics. Determines the optimal size of the delta unit (e.g., 4 bits, 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits) for maximizing compression ratio and decoding throughput.  Uses a reinforcement learning model trained on historical data to refine this selection over time.
*   **Output:** Delta Unit Size (integer representing bit width).

**2. Adaptive Delta Encoding Module (ADEM):**

*   **Input:** Instruction stream, Delta Unit Size.
*   **Function:**  Divides the instruction stream into delta units of the specified size.  Encodes differences *within* each delta unit, utilizing both spatial and temporal delta encoding schemes. The module dynamically switches between spatial and temporal encoding within a delta unit based on data redundancy.  Uses run-length encoding for consecutive zero/non-zero symbols *within* each delta unit, similar to the referenced patent.
*   **Output:** Compressed instruction stream, Delta Unit Map (records the size of each delta unit).

**3. Parallel Delta Decoding Pipeline (PDP):**

*   **Input:** Compressed instruction stream, Delta Unit Map.
*   **Function:** Decompresses the instruction stream in parallel. The PDP consists of multiple identical decoding lanes. Each lane processes a subset of the compressed instruction stream.
    *   **Lane Components:**
        *   **Delta Unit Extraction:** Extracts delta units from the compressed stream based on the Delta Unit Map.
        *   **Run-Length Decoding:** Performs run-length decoding on each delta unit.
        *   **Spatial/Temporal Delta Decoding:** Decodes spatial and temporal deltas within the delta unit, utilizing the logic described in the referenced patent.
        *   **Bit Stitching:** Combines the decoded bits from each delta unit to reconstruct the original instruction.
*   **Output:** Decoded instruction stream.

**4. Workload Profiler (WP):**

*   **Input:** Machine learning workload characteristics (e.g., layer type, data distribution, instruction sequence).
*   **Function:** Monitors the machine learning workload and collects data on instruction patterns, data dependencies, and decoding latency. This data is used to train the DUS and optimize the PDP.
*   **Output:** Workload profile data.

**Pseudocode (PDP Lane):**

```
function decodeLane(compressedStream, deltaUnitMap):
  unitIndex = 0
  while (compressedStream has data):
    deltaUnitSize = deltaUnitMap[unitIndex]
    deltaUnit = extract(compressedStream, deltaUnitSize)

    runLengthDecoded = runLengthDecode(deltaUnit)
    spatialTemporalDecoded = spatialTemporalDecode(runLengthDecoded)

    decodedBits = stitch(spatialTemporalDecoded)

    unitIndex++

  return decodedBits
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   The PDP should be implemented using a highly parallel architecture with multiple decoding lanes.
*   Dedicated hardware accelerators should be used for run-length decoding and spatial/temporal delta decoding.
*   A high-bandwidth memory interface is required to support the parallel data transfer between the instruction master and the PDP.
