**Dynamic Inbox 'Focus Stacks'**

**Concept:** Expand the modular inbox concept beyond simple content modules. Introduce "Focus Stacks" - dynamically generated, contextual groupings of messages *and* application features, triggered by user activity and AI analysis of message content. These aren't just static modules, but evolving, temporary workspaces within the inbox.

**Specs:**

*   **AI-Driven Stack Creation:** The system analyzes incoming messages (text, images, attachments) for keywords, sentiment, entities (people, places, dates, project names, etc.). It also monitors user actions – replies, forwards, file shares, app usage within conversations (e.g., scheduling meetings, creating tasks).

*   **Stack Types:**  Predefined stack templates (Project, Travel, Shopping, Quick Tasks, etc.), plus dynamically generated stacks based on AI analysis.

*   **Stack Composition:** Each stack contains:
    *   Relevant messages (primary).
    *   Related application features – miniature versions of tools relevant to the stack’s context (e.g., a mini-calendar for ‘Travel’ stack, a task list for ‘Project’ stack, a price comparison tool for ‘Shopping’ stack).
    *   Suggested actions – AI-generated prompts based on the stack’s content (e.g., “Schedule a follow-up meeting,” “Share this document with X,” “Add this to your shopping list”).

*   **Dynamic Reordering & Consolidation:** Stacks automatically reorder based on user interaction (most recently accessed stacks are prioritized).  The system consolidates similar stacks (e.g., two stacks related to the same project) into a single, comprehensive stack.

*   **Stack Persistence:** Stacks are temporary but can be 'pinned' for longer-term access. Unused stacks automatically dissolve after a defined period.

*   **User Customization:** Users can create custom stack templates, define stack behavior, and adjust the level of AI assistance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop - Message Received
function onMessage(message) {
    // AI Analysis
    analysisResult = analyzeMessage(message);

    // Determine Stack Candidates
    candidateStacks = findCandidateStacks(analysisResult);

    // If no suitable stack exists, create a new one
    if (candidateStacks.length == 0) {
        newStack = createStack(analysisResult);
        stacks.push(newStack);
    } else {
        // Add message to most relevant stack
        mostRelevantStack = selectMostRelevantStack(candidateStacks, analysisResult);
        mostRelevantStack.addMessage(message);
    }

    // Update Inbox UI to reflect stack changes
    updateInboxUI();
}

// Stack Creation Function
function createStack(analysisResult) {
    stack = new Stack(analysisResult.topic, analysisResult.keywords);
    stack.addMessage(currentMessage);
    stack.populateFeatures(analysisResult); // Add relevant app features
    return stack;
}

// Stack Class
class Stack {
    constructor(topic, keywords) {
        this.topic = topic;
        this.keywords = keywords;
        this.messages = [];
        this.features = [];
    }

    addMessage(message) {
        this.messages.push(message);
    }

    populateFeatures(analysisResult) {
        // Add relevant app features based on analysisResult.topic and keywords
        // Example: If topic is "Travel", add mini-calendar, flight search, hotel search
    }
}
```

**UI Considerations:**

*   Stacks are displayed as horizontally scrollable cards within the inbox.
*   Each card shows the stack topic, a preview of recent messages, and icons representing available features.
*   Users can drag and drop messages between stacks.
*   A “Stack Manager” allows users to pin, unpin, and customize stacks.
