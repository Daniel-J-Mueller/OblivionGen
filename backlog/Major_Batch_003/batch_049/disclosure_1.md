## Dynamic Avatar Emotional Contagion

**Concept:** Expand the system's ability to influence meeting dynamics beyond simple interruption warnings. Introduce a system where avatar expressions are *subtly* altered, mimicking emotional states detected in other participants, fostering empathy or calming tense situations.

**Specs:**

*   **Emotional State Detection:** Utilize the existing audio and sensor data to identify primary emotional states (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutrality) for *each* participant.  Refine current behavioral characteristic analysis to include nuanced emotional expression recognition – micro-expressions, vocal tonality shifts, physiological signals (heart rate, skin conductance if available via sensors).
*   **Contagion Mapping:**  Establish a “contagion map” representing the emotional influence between participants.  For example, if Participant A is showing frustration, subtly increase the "frustration" parameter in the avatar of Participant B (and potentially others) – not to *mirror* the expression perfectly, but to gently nudge it towards a similar state. The intensity of the contagion effect is modulated by pre-defined relationship weights (e.g., stronger contagion between manager and direct report).
*   **Avatar Expression Control:**  Develop a library of subtle avatar expressions – micro-movements of the mouth, eyebrows, and eyes – that can be blended to create nuanced emotional displays. These expressions should *not* be cartoonish or exaggerated; the goal is to create a subconscious effect.
*   **System Control & Overrides:**
    *   **Global Contagion Level:**  A system-wide parameter to adjust the overall intensity of emotional contagion.  This allows for a "safe" default setting with minimal influence.
    *   **Participant Opt-Out:**  Allow individual participants to disable emotional contagion for their own avatar.
    *   **Leader Override:**  The meeting leader can manually adjust the contagion level or even "inject" a specific emotional state (e.g., calm, enthusiasm) into the avatars of other participants.
*   **Data Logging & Analytics:**
    *   Record emotional states and contagion events to analyze the impact of the system on meeting dynamics.
    *   Identify patterns of emotional influence and refine the contagion mapping algorithm.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each participant:
participantEmotionalState = DetectEmotionalState(audioData, sensorData)

// For each participant:
for each otherParticipant:
    contagionFactor = CalculateContagionFactor(participantEmotionalState, otherParticipant.relationshipToSelf)
    if (contagionFactor > 0):
        otherParticipant.avatarExpression = BlendExpressions(otherParticipant.avatarExpression, participantEmotionalState, contagionFactor)
        LimitExpressionIntensity(otherParticipant.avatarExpression)

// Leader override function:
function InjectEmotion(targetParticipant, emotion, intensity):
    targetParticipant.avatarExpression = CreateExpression(emotion, intensity)
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Conflict Resolution:**  Subtly increase empathy between participants during heated discussions.
*   **Team Building:**  Boost enthusiasm and positive energy during brainstorming sessions.
*   **Employee Wellbeing:**  Calm anxious or stressed participants during challenging meetings.
