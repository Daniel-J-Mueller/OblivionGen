## Dynamic Ephemeral Post Layers

**Concept:** Expand upon the core ephemeral post concept by introducing layered visibility and access controls based on user relationship strength *and* predicted engagement. Instead of simple blocking based on interaction counts or time, create 'layers' of access, progressively revealing or concealing content.

**Specs:**

*   **User Relationship Graph:** Maintain a dynamic graph representing relationships between users. This isn't just "follows," but scored based on interaction frequency, type (comments vs. likes), shared interests (determined algorithmically), and explicit relationship tags (e.g., "close friend," "acquaintance").
*   **Engagement Prediction Model:** Utilize a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of a user engaging with a particular ephemeral post (viewing, reacting, commenting, sharing). Factors include past engagement patterns, content type, time of day, and user's current activity.
*   **Layered Visibility:** Each ephemeral post has multiple 'layers' of content – primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. Each layer represents a progressively more revealing version of the post (e.g., primary = blurred image, secondary = clearer image, tertiary = image with added caption/context).
*   **Dynamic Layer Assignment:**
    *   When a post is published, the system assigns layers to different users based on:
        1.  **Relationship Score:** Higher scores = access to more layers.
        2.  **Engagement Prediction:**  Higher prediction = access to more layers.
    *   Layers can dynamically shift based on *real-time* engagement. If a user initially only sees the primary layer, but then actively engages (comments, reacts), they are upgraded to the next layer.
*   **Post Creation Interface:**  Allow post creators to designate specific content for each layer. This is *not* automatic content generation; the creator deliberately crafts each layer.  Example: Layer 1 – quick photo. Layer 2 – photo with short text. Layer 3 – photo, text, and a link to a longer form article.
*   **Visual Indication:** Display a visual 'layer meter' on the post, indicating how much of the content the current viewer is seeing.
*   **Layer Override:** Allow post creators to explicitly assign certain users to specific layers, bypassing the automated scoring/prediction.

**Pseudocode (Layer Assignment):**

```
function assignLayers(post, user):
  relationshipScore = getRelationshipScore(user)
  engagementPrediction = predictEngagement(post, user)

  baseLayer = 1 //Minimum layer

  layerAdjustment = (relationshipScore * 0.5) + (engagementPrediction * 0.5)

  assignedLayer = baseLayer + floor(layerAdjustment)

  //Clamp to max layers (e.g., 5)
  assignedLayer = min(assignedLayer, 5)

  return assignedLayer
```

**Potential Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Storage:** Layered content stored as separate data segments, accessible based on user assignment.
*   **API:** New API endpoints for accessing layered content and updating user assignments.
*   **Privacy:** Explicit privacy settings for each layer, allowing creators to control who can see what.
*   **Notifications:** Notify users when they unlock a new layer of content.
