**Dynamic Scene Graph Propagation for Anticipatory Assistance**

**Concept:** Expand beyond relational understanding *within* a single image or session. Build a persistent, propagating scene graph across multiple sessions and client devices, leveraging probabilistic prediction to anticipate user needs *before* explicit requests.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Data Structure:** A multi-layered graph database.
    *   *Nodes:* Represent objects (identified via computer vision as per the patent), locations, attributes (color, size, material), and *predicted* user intents.
    *   *Edges:* Represent spatial relationships (e.g., "on", "beside", "inside"), temporal relationships ("previously interacted with", "last seen"), and probabilistic connections between objects and intents.
*   **Cross-Device Synchronization:** A distributed, peer-to-peer (P2P) network for sharing graph updates between client devices (phones, smart glasses, AR/VR headsets).  Each device maintains a local copy of the graph but participates in consensus updates.
*   **Probabilistic Intent Prediction:** A Bayesian network layered on top of the scene graph.
    *   *Inputs:* User interaction history, contextual data (time of day, location, calendar events), and real-time sensor data (e.g., gaze tracking, audio analysis).
    *   *Outputs:* Probability distributions over potential user intents (e.g., "user wants to know the price of the red mug", "user wants to turn off the lights").
*   **Anticipatory Action Engine:** Triggers actions based on high-probability intents. These actions may include:
    *   Pre-fetching information (e.g., product details, weather reports).
    *   Adjusting device settings (e.g., turning on lights, playing music).
    *   Proactively presenting information through AR/VR overlays.

**Pseudocode (Intent Prediction):**

```
function predict_intent(user_id, scene_graph, context):
  # Get recent user interactions with scene_graph
  interactions = get_recent_interactions(user_id, scene_graph)

  # Combine interactions with context
  evidence = combine(interactions, context)

  # Run Bayesian network to calculate probabilities of intents
  probabilities = bayesian_network.infer(evidence)

  # Return top N intents with highest probabilities
  top_intents = get_top_n(probabilities, N=3)

  return top_intents
```

**Further Refinement:**

*   **Graph Pruning:** Implement a mechanism for pruning the graph to remove stale or irrelevant information, preventing it from becoming too large and computationally expensive.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Implement differential privacy techniques to protect user data and ensure compliance with privacy regulations.
*   **Federated Learning:**  Utilize federated learning to train the Bayesian network on data from multiple devices without requiring the data to be centralized.
*   **Edge Computing:** Offload some of the computation to edge devices to reduce latency and improve responsiveness.
*   **Multi-Modal Input Fusion:** Integrate data from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, accelerometers) to create a richer understanding of the user's environment and intent.
