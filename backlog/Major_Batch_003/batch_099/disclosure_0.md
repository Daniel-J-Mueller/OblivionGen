**Dynamic Spatial Audio Broadcasting & Personalized Soundscapes**

**Concept:** Extend the live video stream compositing to include dynamic spatial audio mixing, creating personalized soundscapes for each viewer based on their perceived ‘engagement’ with individual participant streams.

**Specs:**

*   **Audio Source Isolation:** Each participant's audio feed is isolated and treated as a discrete spatial audio source.
*   **Engagement Metrics Integration:** The system utilizes the same engagement metrics as the video selection (active presence, viewing time, votes, purchases, bids, etc.). These metrics are translated into ‘audio prominence’ weights. Higher engagement = higher audio prominence.
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:** A real-time spatial audio engine (e.g., binaural rendering) processes the individual participant audio sources.
*   **Personalized Mixing:**  For each viewer, the system dynamically mixes the participant audio sources based on their individualized engagement weights.  A viewer highly engaged with Participant A will hear Participant A's audio significantly louder and with more spatial separation than Participant B.
*   **Soundscape Zones:** Define 'soundscape zones' around the video feed. For example, Participant A’s audio emanates from the left side of the viewer’s perceived space, Participant B from the right, and the central 'room' audio (if any) from the center.
*   **'Focus' Mode:** A user-selectable 'focus' mode allows a viewer to drastically boost the audio prominence of a single participant, effectively ‘tuning in’ to their stream.
*   **AI-Driven Audio Enhancement:**  Employ AI to analyze participant audio quality in real-time. Automatically apply noise reduction, equalization, and compression to ensure optimal audio clarity for each participant before spatial mixing.
*   **Haptic Feedback Integration:** (Optional) Synchronize haptic feedback (e.g., vibrations in headphones or a wearable device) with key audio events from highly engaged participants.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Mixing Algorithm):**

```
// For each viewer:
FOR each Participant in ParticipantList:
    engagementWeight = GetEngagementWeight(ViewerID, ParticipantID)
    volume = baseVolume * engagementWeight
    pan = GetParticipantPan(ParticipantID)  //Determines spatial position
    ApplySpatialAudio(ParticipantAudio, volume, pan)
END FOR
OutputCombinedAudio()
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance server with multi-core processors
*   Spatial audio rendering engine (e.g., Steam Audio, Dolby Atmos)
*   Real-time audio processing libraries
*   AI-powered audio enhancement tools
*   Compatible audio hardware (headphones or speakers)
