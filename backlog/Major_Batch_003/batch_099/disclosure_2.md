## Dynamic Ontology Merging for Contextual AI

**Specification:** A system capable of dynamically merging structural ontologies in real-time based on detected user context and agent capabilities.

**Problem:** The provided patent establishes a rigid structural ontology. While powerful, this limits adaptability. Different users, environments, or even time-of-day scenarios could benefit from subtly or dramatically different ontological structures.  A fixed ontology becomes a bottleneck.

**Innovation:** Instead of a single, monolithic ontology, we’ll create a system that leverages a library of modular ontologies, and intelligently merges them on-the-fly.  This allows for extreme contextualization of the AI’s understanding and response.

**System Components:**

1.  **Ontology Library:**  A repository of pre-defined, modular ontologies. Each module focuses on a specific domain (e.g., “home automation,” “music control,” “travel planning,” “cooking”).  Modules are designed to be composable—meaning they can be combined without conflict.  Each ontology module would define actions, objects, and attributes as in the base patent, but in a standardized, easily mergeable format.  A version control system is vital.

2.  **Context Engine:**  This component analyzes various data streams (user location, time of day, calendar events, recent user interactions, device sensor data, detected emotion from audio/video) to infer user context. It utilizes machine learning models to classify the current context into predefined categories (e.g., "commuting," "at work," "relaxing at home," "cooking dinner"). 

3.  **Ontology Merger:**  The core component.  It receives the current context from the Context Engine and selects appropriate ontology modules from the Ontology Library.  A conflict resolution system is essential.  

    *   **Merge Algorithm:** Uses a graph-based approach. Each ontology module is represented as a graph, where nodes represent actions, objects, or attributes, and edges represent relationships. The Merger algorithm identifies common nodes and edges, prioritizes conflicting definitions based on a configurable priority matrix (e.g., user preference overrides system default), and merges the graphs into a unified ontology.
    *   **Dynamic Weighting:**  Allows for assigning weights to different ontology modules based on the strength of the contextual signal. For example, if the user is actively engaged in a cooking activity, the "cooking" ontology module will have a higher weight than others.

4.  **Semantic Representation Engine:**  Operates as in the original patent, but utilizes the *dynamically merged* ontology to determine the semantic representation of user input.

**Pseudocode (Ontology Merger):**

```
function mergeOntologies(context, ontologyLibrary):
  selectedOntologies = ontologyLibrary.select(context)
  baseOntology = selectedOntologies[0] // Start with the most general ontology

  for each ontology in selectedOntologies[1...]:
    mergedOntology = graphMerge(baseOntology, ontology)
    baseOntology = mergedOntology

  return baseOntology
```

```
function graphMerge(ontology1, ontology2):
  mergedGraph = copy(ontology1)

  for each node in ontology2:
    if node exists in mergedGraph:
      // Conflict Resolution:  Prioritize based on rules/weights
      if priority(ontology2) > priority(mergedGraph):
        mergedGraph.updateNode(node, ontology2)
      else:
        // Optionally, merge attributes/properties
        mergedGraph.mergeNodeProperties(node, ontology2)
    else:
      mergedGraph.addNode(node)

  // Update edges/relationships accordingly
  return mergedGraph
```

**Example:**

User is “cooking dinner” (Context Engine). The system selects "cooking" and "home automation" ontologies. The "cooking" ontology defines actions like "chop," "stir," "bake," and objects like "vegetable," "pot," "oven." The "home automation" ontology defines actions like "turn on," "dim," and objects like "light," "thermostat." The Merger combines these, allowing a user to say, “Dim the lights while I stir the sauce.”  The system understands "stir" is a cooking action, "lights" are home automation objects, and the context allows for combining these into a single, coherent command.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **User Customization:** Allow users to explicitly define their own ontology modules or customize existing ones.
*   **Ontology Learning:**  Implement a mechanism for the system to learn new ontology modules from user interactions or external data sources.
*   **Federated Learning:**  Enable collaborative ontology development and sharing across multiple users and devices.
