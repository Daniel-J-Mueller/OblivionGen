## Dynamic Content Reframing with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Extend saliency prediction to dynamically reframe video content *before* presentation, not just for analysis. This anticipates where a user will likely look and subtly adjusts the frame to *prevent* key elements from being occluded by UI elements or the edges of the screen, especially on devices with varying aspect ratios or dynamic UI overlays.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**

*   **Input:** Live video stream or stored video file. Viewport tracking data from the device (eye-tracking, touch, mouse movement). UI element definitions (position, size, transparency) for the current application context.
*   **Saliency Map Generation:** Utilize the existing saliency prediction model (trained as described in the provided patent) to generate a saliency map for each frame.
*   **UI Element Mapping:** Create a ‘UI Occlusion Map’ representing potential occlusion areas based on UI element positions and sizes. This map is a grayscale image where brighter pixels indicate higher occlusion probability.
*   **Combined Risk Map:**  Combine the Saliency Map and the UI Occlusion Map to create a ‘Combined Risk Map’. This map highlights areas that are *both* salient *and* at risk of occlusion.  A weighted sum is used:  `CombinedRisk = (SaliencyWeight * SaliencyMap) + (OcclusionWeight * UIOcclusionMap)`.  Weights are tunable parameters.

**2. Dynamic Reframing Algorithm:**

*   **Reframing Zone Definition:**  Establish a limited ‘Reframing Zone’ around the borders of the video frame. This prevents drastic scene changes and maintains a sense of visual stability. The size of this zone is configurable.
*   **Reframing Vector Calculation:** For each frame, analyze the Combined Risk Map.  Identify regions with high risk (high Combined Risk value) that are near the edge of the frame. Calculate a ‘Reframing Vector’ – a direction and magnitude indicating how the frame should be subtly shifted to minimize occlusion risk.  The algorithm prioritizes shifts that align high-saliency regions with areas less likely to be occluded.
*   **Constraint Handling:**
    *   **Reframing Zone Constraint:** Ensure the Reframing Vector stays within the defined Reframing Zone.
    *   **Content Awareness:** Implement a mechanism to avoid shifting the frame into areas of low visual interest (e.g., solid black backgrounds).
    *   **Temporal Consistency:** Smooth the Reframing Vector over time using a moving average filter to prevent jarring shifts.
*   **Frame Transformation:** Apply the calculated Reframing Vector to the video frame, effectively shifting the view slightly.  Use a resampling algorithm (e.g., bilinear or bicubic interpolation) to fill in any resulting empty pixels at the edges of the frame.

**3. System Integration:**

*   **Real-Time Processing:**  The entire process (data acquisition, map generation, reframing) must be performed in real-time to ensure a seamless user experience.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Utilize hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU) to offload computationally intensive tasks (map generation, frame transformation).
*   **API Exposure:**  Provide an API that allows other applications to access and control the Dynamic Reframing system.

**Pseudocode (Key Algorithm Step):**

```
function CalculateReframingVector(CombinedRiskMap, ReframingZone):
  // Find regions with high risk near the frame edges
  HighRiskRegions = FindRegions(CombinedRiskMap, Threshold) // Threshold is a tunable parameter

  // Calculate the 'pull' towards the center of the frame for each high-risk region
  PullVectors = []
  for each region in HighRiskRegions:
    CenterX = imageWidth / 2
    CenterY = imageHeight / 2
    RegionCenterX = region.centerX
    RegionCenterY = region.centerY
    PullX = (CenterX - RegionCenterX) * region.saliencyWeight // Weight based on saliency
    PullY = (CenterY - RegionCenterY) * region.saliencyWeight
    PullVectors.append((PullX, PullY))

  // Sum the PullVectors to get the overall Reframing Vector
  TotalPullX = sum([vector[0] for vector in PullVectors])
  TotalPullY = sum([vector[1] for vector in PullVectors])

  // Apply constraint to keep within ReframingZone
  ReframingX = clamp(TotalPullX, -ReframingZone, ReframingZone)
  ReframingY = clamp(TotalPullY, -ReframingZone, ReframingZone)

  return (ReframingX, ReframingY)
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Predictive Reframing:**  Analyze user gaze patterns and predict future viewing behavior to proactively reframe the video.
*   **Personalized Reframing:** Adapt the reframing algorithm based on individual user preferences and viewing habits.
*   **AI-Driven Reframing:** Use reinforcement learning to train an AI agent to optimize the reframing algorithm for maximum user engagement.
