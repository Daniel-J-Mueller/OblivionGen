## Dynamic Policy Generation via Generative Adversarial Networks

**Concept:** Instead of maintaining a static set of policies and hierarchical structures of violating pages, utilize Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to dynamically generate policy definitions *and* examples of violating landing pages. This allows for proactive policy enforcement against emerging threats and circumvention techniques.

**Specs:**

1.  **GAN Architecture:** Implement a GAN with two primary components:
    *   **Generator:** Takes a seed input (random noise or a high-level policy concept – e.g., “phishing,” “malware distribution”) and generates a policy definition (textual description, rules) *and* a corresponding HTML/JavaScript snippet representing a violating landing page.
    *   **Discriminator:** Evaluates both the generated policy and the landing page. It assesses:
        *   **Policy Validity:** Is the generated policy internally consistent and logically sound?
        *   **Violation Realism:** Does the generated landing page convincingly violate the generated policy? Is it difficult for a human or existing detection mechanisms to identify as malicious *without* knowing the policy?
        *   **Policy-Violation Alignment:** Does the landing page *actually* violate the policy it was generated with?

2.  **Training Data:**
    *   Initial training will use existing known policy violations and policy definitions as seed data.
    *   Continuous learning: The system will monitor live web traffic, flag potential violations, and use human review/feedback to refine the GAN’s training data.  Human-reviewed cases become new training examples.

3.  **Hierarchical Structure Generation:** The Generator will produce not only the HTML/JavaScript for the landing page but also the corresponding DOM tree (hierarchical structure). This allows seamless integration with the existing similarity comparison engine.

4.  **Policy Complexity Control:** Introduce a “complexity parameter” for the Generator.  Higher complexity leads to more sophisticated policies and landing pages (potentially harder to detect, but also with a higher risk of false positives).  Lower complexity results in simpler policies and landing pages that are easier to detect.

5.  **Proactive Policy Deployment:** The system will periodically generate new policies and violating landing pages using the GAN. These generated examples will be used to:
    *   Update the existing set of hierarchical structures of violating pages.
    *   Stress-test existing detection mechanisms.
    *   Identify gaps in policy coverage.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Generator):**

```
function generate_policy_and_page(seed, complexity):
  policy_definition = generate_policy_text(seed, complexity)
  page_html = generate_html_from_policy(policy_definition, complexity)
  page_dom = parse_html_to_dom(page_html)
  return policy_definition, page_html, page_dom
```

**Pseudocode (Simplified Discriminator):**

```
function evaluate_policy_and_page(policy_definition, page_html, page_dom):
  policy_validity_score = check_policy_validity(policy_definition)
  violation_realism_score = assess_page_realism(page_html)
  alignment_score = verify_policy_violation(policy_definition, page_dom)

  overall_score = (policy_validity_score + violation_realism_score + alignment_score) / 3
  return overall_score
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance GPU(s) for training the GAN.
*   Large storage capacity for training data and generated examples.
*   Web crawling infrastructure to collect data for training.
*   HTML/JavaScript parsing libraries.
*   Machine learning frameworks (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
