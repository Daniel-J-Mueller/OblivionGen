## Dynamic Perspective Stitching & Temporal Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the media presentation system to not only identify content & social correspondence *between* segments, but to *actively reconstruct* a more complete scene/event from potentially incomplete or disparate contributions.  Imagine multiple users capturing the same concert, but from different angles/times.  This system would attempt to intelligently stitch those fragments together into a fluid, multi-perspective experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Pre-processing:**

*   **Input:**  Media segments (video, audio, images) from multiple client devices, timestamp data, and user metadata (location, identified interests).
*   **Feature Extraction:** Employ robust feature detection algorithms (e.g., ORB, SIFT, SURF) to identify keypoints and descriptors within each media segment.  Focus on both visual and auditory features.
*   **Sensor Data Integration:** If available (via phone sensors or connected devices), incorporate accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS data to estimate camera motion and orientation.

**2. Scene Reconstruction & Correspondence:**

*   **Spatial Mapping:** Use Structure from Motion (SfM) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) techniques to create a sparse 3D point cloud representing the scene.  Media segments act as viewpoints for the reconstruction.
*   **Temporal Alignment:**  Analyze timestamp data and audio/visual cues (e.g., applause, musical beats) to synchronize media segments along a timeline.  Employ dynamic time warping (DTW) for non-rigid temporal alignment.
*   **Perspective Graph:** Construct a graph where nodes represent media segments and edges represent spatial/temporal correspondence.  Edge weights indicate confidence in the correspondence.
*   **View Selection:**  Utilize a view selection algorithm (e.g., View Planning) to determine the optimal sequence of views for rendering a cohesive experience.  Prioritize views that maximize information gain and minimize jarring transitions.

**3. Dynamic Rendering & User Interaction:**

*   **Multi-Perspective Compositing:** Render a final output by compositing different views based on user-defined parameters (e.g., "Show me the widest angle," "Focus on the performer's face").  Employ blending techniques (alpha blending, depth blending) to create seamless transitions.
*   **Interactive Timeline:** Provide a timeline interface where users can scrub through the reconstructed event and switch between different perspectives.
*   **AI-Powered Fill-in:** Utilize generative AI (e.g., image/video inpainting) to fill in gaps in the reconstruction or smooth out transitions.
*   **Perspective "Painting":** Allow users to paint areas of the view with different perspectives, allowing for a personalized viewing experience. For example, a user could paint the stage with video from one user, and the crowd from another.

**Pseudocode (Simplified View Selection):**

```
function select_best_view(perspective_graph, user_preference):
    best_view = null
    max_score = -1

    for each node in perspective_graph:
        score = calculate_view_score(node, user_preference) // Considers angle, coverage, resolution, user rating

        if score > max_score:
            max_score = score
            best_view = node

    return best_view

function calculate_view_score(node, user_preference):
    // Calculate a score based on angle to event, resolution, relevance to user_preference,
    // and connections to other relevant nodes in the graph.
    // Score is a weighted sum of these factors.
    score = angle_weight * angle_score +
            resolution_weight * resolution_score +
            user_preference_weight * user_preference_score +
            graph_connectivity_weight * graph_connectivity_score
    return score
```

**Expansion Points:**

*   Integration with AR/VR headsets for immersive experiences.
*   Automated event tagging and metadata extraction using machine learning.
*   Crowd-sourced reconstruction of historical events.
*   Real-time reconstruction of live events.
