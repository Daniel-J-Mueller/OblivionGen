## Dynamic Emotional Captioning

**Concept:** Extend caption customization beyond textual edits to incorporate emotional cues visualized *within* the caption itself, synced with detected emotional shifts in the audio/video.

**Specs:**

*   **Emotional Analysis Module:** Real-time audio/video analysis to detect emotional states (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral). Utilizes facial expression recognition *and* speech prosody analysis (tone, pitch, rhythm). Outputs a confidence score for each detected emotion.
*   **Caption Style Library:** A pre-defined library of caption visual styles associated with each detected emotion. Examples:
    *   **Joy:** Bright yellow background, bouncy font, subtle animation.
    *   **Sadness:**  Dark blue background, muted font, slow fade-in/out.
    *   **Anger:** Red background, sharp font, slight shaking animation.
    *   **Fear:**  Purple background, jagged font, fast flicker.
    *   **Neutral:** Standard white background, clear font.
*   **Dynamic Style Application:**  A system to apply caption styles based on the real-time emotional analysis.  This should not be a hard switch, but a blend. The system should interpolate between styles based on emotion confidence scores. (e.g. 70% Joy, 30% Neutral = a caption with mostly joyful styling, but retaining some readability).
*   **User Override:** Provide granular user control.
    *   **Emotion Mapping:**  Allow users to remap emotions to different styles.  (e.g. User dislikes the default "Joy" style, and assigns a different visual theme to it.)
    *   **Intensity Control:** Users can adjust the intensity of the emotional styling. (e.g. Reduce the shaking effect for "Anger," or make the "Joy" background less vibrant.)
    *   **Manual Keyframing:** Users can manually define emotional styles at specific timestamps in the video, overriding the automated analysis.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function applyEmotionalStyling(video, audio):
  emotionData = analyzeAudioVideo(audio, video) // Returns array of {timestamp, emotion, confidence}

  for each entry in emotionData:
    timestamp = entry.timestamp
    emotion = entry.emotion
    confidence = entry.confidence

    style = getCaptionStyle(emotion)
    // Blend with default style based on confidence
    blendedStyle = blendStyles(style, defaultStyle, confidence)

    // Apply blendedStyle to caption at timestamp
    applyStyleToCaption(caption, timestamp, blendedStyle)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance CPU/GPU for real-time analysis.
*   Machine learning libraries for emotion detection (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Video editing SDK for caption manipulation.
*   User interface for customization controls.
