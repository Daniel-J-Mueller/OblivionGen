## Dynamic Perceptual Bitstream Stitching

**Concept:** Extend the convex hull-based encoding approach to incorporate real-time perceptual analysis of the decoded video *during* playback. This allows for dynamic stitching together of different encoded bitstream segments, optimizing perceived quality *specifically* for the current viewing conditions and device capabilities *after* initial encoding.

**Specs:**

*   **Perceptual Analysis Module:** Integrated into the playback device/application. Analyzes decoded frames for perceptual artifacts (blocking, blurring, color banding) and scene complexity (motion, detail). Outputs a "Perceptual Quality Score" (PQS) and “Complexity Score” (CS).
*   **Bitstream Segment Library:** The encoder generates a wider range of candidate encodings than typically used for ABR. These aren’t just different resolutions/bitrates but also variations in codec parameters impacting perceptual quality (e.g., varying levels of deblocking filter, different GOP structures optimized for specific content). These segments are stored/accessible during playback. The segments are tagged with metadata including PQS ranges for different CS levels.
*   **Stitching Logic:**
    *   The playback device constantly monitors PQS and CS.
    *   Based on the current PQS/CS, the stitching logic selects the *most appropriate* bitstream segment from the library for the next short interval (e.g. 0.5-2 seconds).  A “seamless switching” algorithm ensures smooth transitions.
    *   A predictive model anticipates future PQS/CS based on scene analysis.  This allows for pre-fetching and buffering of the next segment.
    *   Priority is given to segments exhibiting a higher PQS for a given bitrate, even if it means temporarily deviating from the standard ABR profile.
*   **Metadata Enhancement:** Each candidate encoding includes a ‘Perceptual Profile’. This profile details the strengths/weaknesses of the encoding regarding different types of perceptual artifacts and scene complexities.
*   **Dynamic Constraint Adjustment:** The system learns from user viewing patterns and preferences. User-defined “Quality Profiles” (e.g., “High Motion Clarity,” “Maximum Detail,” “Smooth Gradients”) adjust the weighting of different perceptual metrics.

**Pseudocode (Stitching Logic):**

```
function select_bitstream_segment(current_PQS, current_CS, predicted_PQS, predicted_CS, user_quality_profile) {
  // Query Bitstream Segment Library for segments matching predicted PQS/CS range
  candidate_segments = query_library(predicted_PQS, predicted_CS)

  // Apply user-defined quality profile weights
  weighted_scores = calculate_weighted_scores(candidate_segments, user_quality_profile)

  // Select segment with highest weighted score
  best_segment = select_best_segment(weighted_scores)

  return best_segment
}

function calculate_weighted_scores(segments, quality_profile) {
  for each segment in segments {
    score = quality_profile.motion_clarity_weight * segment.motion_clarity_score +
            quality_profile.detail_weight * segment.detail_score +
            quality_profile.gradient_smoothness_weight * segment.gradient_smoothness_score
    segment.weighted_score = score
  }
}

```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond static encoding profiles and ABR to a truly *dynamic* video streaming system. The stitching process optimizes perceived quality in real-time, adapting to both content characteristics and user preferences. It is a fine-grained, content-aware approach to video delivery.
