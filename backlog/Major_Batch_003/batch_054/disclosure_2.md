## Dynamic Content 'Reveal' Based on Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the obscuring/revealing mechanism beyond user profile/content data by incorporating real-time biofeedback to tailor content presentation. This moves beyond *predicting* reveal likelihood to *reacting* to user state.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Integration:** Compatible with readily available wearable biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability (HRV), galvanic skin response (GSR), electroencephalography (EEG) - specifically, attention/engagement metrics). API for direct data ingestion or compatible with standard data streams (e.g., Bluetooth LE).
*   **Biofeedback Processing Module:**
    *   Real-time data acquisition and filtering (noise reduction, artifact removal).
    *   Feature extraction: Calculate relevant metrics from raw biofeedback signals (e.g., HRV-derived stress level, GSR-based arousal, EEG-measured cognitive load).
    *   Normalization and scaling of biofeedback features.
*   **Dynamic Obscuration Engine:**
    *   Input: Likelihood score (from existing ML model, or a combined score), biofeedback features.
    *   Obscuration Methods: Color opacity, blur intensity, pixelation, geometric distortion. Potentially expanding to audio muting/filtering for video content.
    *   Mapping Function: A configurable function that maps the combined likelihood/biofeedback score to obscuration parameters.  Example:
        ```
        obscuration_level = (1 - (likelihood_score * biofeedback_weight)) * max_obscuration
        
        //Where:
        //likelihood_score = output from existing ML model (0-1)
        //biofeedback_weight = configurable parameter (0-1) - scaling biofeedback influence
        //max_obscuration = maximum level of obscuration (e.g., maximum blur radius)
        ```
        The function can be linear, exponential, or a more complex mapping.
    *   Smoothing Filter: Apply a smoothing filter (e.g., moving average) to the obscuration level to prevent jarring transitions.
*   **Calibration Routine:** User-specific calibration to establish baseline biofeedback levels and sensitivity. This ensures that the system responds appropriately to individual differences. The calibration could involve presenting known content while measuring biofeedback.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  Continuously refine the mapping function based on user feedback (explicit ratings, implicit engagement metrics - e.g., dwell time, completion rate). Use reinforcement learning to optimize the system's performance.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Local data processing where feasible. If data is transmitted, encrypt it securely. Provide users with clear control over data collection and usage.
*   **Content Type Support:**  Expand beyond images and videos to include text (obscuring sentences or paragraphs) and interactive content (adjusting the complexity of a game based on cognitive load).



This goes beyond prediction and introduces a reactive system.  If a user is already stressed (high HRV, high GSR), the content is presented with *more* obscuration to avoid overwhelming them. If they are engaged and calm, the obscuration is reduced or removed entirely. It's an attempt to create a more personalized, emotionally intelligent content delivery system.
