## Dynamic Content 'Echoes' & Predictive User Portraits

**Concept:** Extend the reaction-based animation system to create layered 'echoes' of past user interactions with content, coupled with predictive animations based on inferred user affinities.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   `ContentInteractionLog`: {`contentID`, `userID`, `reactionType`, `timestamp`, `interactionData` (e.g., dwell time, scroll depth)}.
*   `UserAffinityProfile`: {`userID`, `contentCategories`, `userTags`, `affinityScores` (for other users, content creators, topics)}.
*   `EchoLayer`: {`animationType`, `userData`, `animationData`, `startTime`, `duration`}.

**II. System Components:**

1.  **Echo Generator:**
    *   Input: `contentID`, `viewingUser`.
    *   Process:
        *   Retrieve `ContentInteractionLog` for `contentID`.
        *   Identify top *N* interacting users (based on interaction strength/recency).
        *   For each user:
            *   Retrieve `UserAffinityProfile` for the interacting user.
            *   Determine an `animationType` based on the interacting user's profile & reaction:
                *   'Ghost' – faint, translucent echo of the original reaction animation.
                *   'Ripple' – expanding animation originating from the user’s icon.
                *   'Highlight' – brief illumination of the content area the user interacted with.
            *   Create an `EchoLayer` with the determined `animationType`, user data (icon, name), and animation parameters.
        *   Sort `EchoLayers` based on interaction recency/strength.
    *   Output: List of `EchoLayers`.

2.  **Predictive Animation Engine:**
    *   Input: `viewingUser`, `contentID`, list of `EchoLayers`.
    *   Process:
        *   Retrieve `UserAffinityProfile` for `viewingUser`.
        *   Identify users with high affinity to `viewingUser` within the `EchoLayer` data.
        *   Predict potential reactions: based on the affinity, infer likely reactions the `viewingUser` might have to the content.
        *   Generate 'pre-reaction' animations: subtle, anticipatory animations suggesting potential reactions. (e.g., a slight 'glow' around a 'like' icon, a subtle 'sad' expression on an avatar).
        *   Add these ‘pre-reaction’ animations as additional `EchoLayers`, sorted by predicted likelihood.

3.  **Animation Composer:**
    *   Input: List of `EchoLayers`.
    *   Process:
        *   Layer `EchoLayers` onto the base animation, prioritizing:
            *   Recent interactions closest to the viewing user.
            *   High-affinity users.
            *   Pre-reaction animations.
        *   Implement visual blending/opacity adjustments to create a dynamic, layered effect.
        *   Synchronize animations to create a fluid, responsive experience.

**III. Pseudocode (Animation Composer):**

```
function composeAnimation(echoLayers):
  baseAnimation = generateBaseAnimation(content)
  sortedLayers = sortEchoLayers(echoLayers) // Sort by priority (recency, affinity)

  finalAnimation = baseAnimation

  for layer in sortedLayers:
    if layer.animationType == "Ghost":
      opacity = 0.2
    else if layer.animationType == "Ripple":
      opacity = 0.5
    else:
      opacity = 1

    finalAnimation = layerAnimation(finalAnimation, layer, opacity) // Blend layer onto animation

  return finalAnimation
```

**IV.  Refinements:**

*   **Content-Aware Echoes:** Tailor echo types based on content category (e.g., 'sparkles' for uplifting content, 'shadows' for somber content).
*   **Temporal Decay:** Implement a decay function to reduce echo intensity over time, reflecting diminishing memory.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to control the intensity/types of echoes they see.
