## Adaptive Request Granularity & Predictive Prefetching

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A ‘Granularity Manager’ module integrated within each Request Broadcasting Master (RBM).
*   **Memory Unit Enhancement:** Each memory unit gains a ‘Prefetch Queue’ and associated logic.
*   **Communication Protocol Addition:**  A ‘Granularity Flag’ is added to each memory request packet.
*   **RBM Configuration:**  RBMs dynamically adjust request size based on access patterns.
*   **Prefetch Queue Depth:** Configurable, ranging from 8 to 64 slots.
*   **Granularity Levels:** Three levels: ‘Coarse’ (large contiguous blocks), ‘Medium’ (cache-line sized), ‘Fine’ (individual data elements).

**Innovation Description:**

The system leverages the distributed RBM architecture to introduce adaptive request granularity and predictive prefetching. Currently, the patent focuses on *compressing* requests. We instead focus on intelligent *sizing* of requests, and anticipating data needs.

The Granularity Manager within each RBM analyzes the memory access patterns of its assigned processing element group.  It tracks sequential vs. random access, data reuse frequency, and access stride lengths. Based on this analysis, it dynamically selects the appropriate granularity level for each request.

*   **Sequential Access:** Coarse granularity is used to transfer large blocks of contiguous data with minimal overhead.
*   **Random Access:** Fine granularity is used to fetch only the required data elements, minimizing unnecessary transfers.
*   **Moderate/Predictable Access:** Medium granularity (cache-line size) provides a balance between overhead and efficiency.

The ‘Granularity Flag’ within the request packet informs the memory unit of the chosen granularity level.

**Prefetching Implementation:**

When the Granularity Manager detects a predictable access pattern (e.g., sequential access with a consistent stride length), it sends a ‘Prefetch Request’ to the corresponding memory unit *before* the data is actually needed. The Prefetch Request includes the predicted data address and size.

The memory unit queues the prefetch request in its Prefetch Queue. The Prefetch Queue is prioritized based on request urgency. Upon bandwidth availability, the memory unit services the Prefetch Request, placing the data in a dedicated ‘Prefetch Buffer’.  When the processing element requests the data, it is served directly from the Prefetch Buffer, reducing latency.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Manager within RBM):**

```
function generateRequest(processingElement, dataAddress, dataSize)
  accessPattern = analyzeAccessPattern(processingElement)

  if accessPattern == SEQUENTIAL
    granularity = COARSE
    requestSize = calculateCoarseSize(dataSize)
  else if accessPattern == RANDOM
    granularity = FINE
    requestSize = dataSize
  else
    granularity = MEDIUM
    requestSize = calculateCacheLineSize(dataSize)

  requestPacket = createRequestPacket(dataAddress, requestSize, granularity)
  return requestPacket
end function

function analyzeAccessPattern(processingElement)
  // Track recent memory accesses, stride lengths, and reuse frequency
  // Implement logic to identify sequential, random, or predictable patterns
  // Return appropriate pattern identifier (SEQUENTIAL, RANDOM, PREDICTABLE)
end function

function calculateCoarseSize(dataSize)
  // Determine optimal block size for sequential transfer
  // Consider memory bandwidth and cache line size
  return blockSize
end function

function calculateCacheLineSize(dataSize)
  // Return cache line size
  return cacheLineSize
end function

function detectPredictablePattern()
    //Logic to determine next memory access
    return predictable
end function
```

**System Enhancements:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** Implement a machine learning algorithm to dynamically adjust granularity levels based on observed performance.
*   **Hardware Prefetching Integration:** Leverage existing hardware prefetching capabilities within the memory controller.
*   **Cross-RBM Collaboration:** Allow RBMs to share access pattern information to improve prefetching accuracy.
