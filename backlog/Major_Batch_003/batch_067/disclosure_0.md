## Dynamic Content-Aware Encoding Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the distortion-based encoding thresholding to operate *per-object* within a video frame, creating dynamically adjusted encoding profiles optimized for perceptual importance. This moves beyond simply adjusting resolution or bitrate globally, towards a localized, object-centric approach.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Object Segmentation Module:**
    *   Input: Digital video frame.
    *   Output: Segmentation map identifying discrete objects/regions within the frame (e.g., person, car, sky, building). Utilize a pre-trained deep learning model (Mask R-CNN, YOLOv8-seg) for real-time object detection and segmentation.
    *   Configuration:  Adjustable confidence thresholds for object detection. Allow user-defined object categories to prioritize (e.g., prioritize faces over background elements).

2.  **Perceptual Importance Metric:**
    *   Input: Segmentation map, original video frame.
    *   Process:  Assign a "perceptual importance score" to each segmented object/region. This score combines multiple factors:
        *   **Object Size:** Larger objects receive higher scores.
        *   **Motion Vector Magnitude:** Objects with high motion receive higher scores.
        *   **Semantic Category:** User-defined weights for different object categories (e.g., “person” = 1.0, “car” = 0.8, “building” = 0.5).
        *   **Salience Map Integration:** Incorporate a pre-computed salience map to identify visually attention-grabbing regions.
    *   Output: A per-object/region importance score map.

3.  **Localized Distortion Analysis:**
    *   Input: Original video frame, downsampled/upsampled frame (as per original patent), per-object importance score map.
    *   Process:
        *   For each object/region, calculate downsampling distortion *specifically within that region*.
        *   Apply a weighting factor to the distortion metric based on the per-object importance score.  Higher importance = higher weight.
        *   Determine a *localized* constant rate factor transition threshold for each object/region.
    *   Output: A per-object/region constant rate factor transition threshold map.

4.  **Adaptive Encoding Parameter Selection:**
    *   Input: Per-object/region constant rate factor transition threshold map.
    *   Process:
        *   For each object/region:
            *   If distortion is below threshold: Select a set of encoding parameters prioritizing lower bitrate/smaller file size, potentially accepting some quality loss.
            *   If distortion is above threshold: Select a set of encoding parameters prioritizing higher bitrate/better quality, preserving detail.
    *   Output: A per-object/region encoding parameter map (resolution, bitrate, quantization parameters).

5.  **Encoding & Multiplexing:**
    *   Process: Encode each object/region independently using its assigned encoding parameters.
    *   Multiplex the encoded object streams into a single video stream, including metadata indicating object boundaries and encoding parameters. A scalable video coding (SVC) scheme may be employed.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FOR each frame IN video:
    segmentation_map = object_segmentation(frame)
    importance_map = perceptual_importance(segmentation_map, frame)

    FOR each object IN segmentation_map:
        distortion = downsampling_distortion(frame, object)
        weighted_distortion = distortion * importance_map[object]
        threshold = determine_threshold(weighted_distortion)

        IF threshold > distortion:
            encoding_params = low_bitrate_params
        ELSE:
            encoding_params = high_quality_params

        encoded_object = encode(object, encoding_params)
        encoded_objects.append(encoded_object)

    multiplexed_stream = multiplex(encoded_objects, metadata)
    output_stream.append(multiplexed_stream)
```

**Potential Refinements:**

*   **Temporal Consistency:** Smooth transitions in encoding parameters between frames to avoid jarring visual artifacts.
*   **Region of Interest (ROI) Control:** Allow users to manually define ROIs for customized encoding.
*   **AI-Driven Parameter Optimization:** Use reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust encoding parameters based on perceptual quality metrics and bitrate constraints.
*   **Layered Encoding:** Create multiple layers of encoding, with different levels of detail and bitrate, for adaptive streaming applications.
