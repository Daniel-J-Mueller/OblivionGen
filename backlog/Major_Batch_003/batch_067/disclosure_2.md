## Dynamic Join Window Modulation via Predictive Drift Compensation

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic windowing approach by introducing a predictive drift compensation mechanism. The core idea is to anticipate window misalignment caused by variations in processing speeds *before* they impact join accuracy, actively adjusting window boundaries based on predicted drifts.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `StreamState`: Structure containing:
    *   `last_event_time`: Last processed event time for the stream.
    *   `estimated_processing_time`: Current estimated processing time (as in the base patent).
    *   `processing_time_history`: A rolling window of recent processing times (e.g., last 10 batches).
    *   `drift_rate`: Rate of change of the estimated processing time (calculated from `processing_time_history`).
    *   `predicted_processing_time`: Estimated processing time ‘t’ seconds into the future.

*   `JoinConfiguration`: Structure containing:
    *   `first_stream_state`: `StreamState` for the first stream.
    *   `second_stream_state`: `StreamState` for the second stream.
    *   `base_join_window`: Initial join window size.
    *   `drift_threshold`: Maximum acceptable drift before window adjustment.
    *   `prediction_horizon`:  Time horizon for predicting processing time.

**2. Algorithm – Initialization:**

1.  Initialize `StreamState` for both streams.
2.  Calculate initial `estimated_processing_time` for both streams using statistical measures of initial data batches.
3.  Initialize `JoinConfiguration` with base join window, drift threshold, and prediction horizon.

**3. Algorithm – Processing Each Batch (First Stream):**

1.  Receive a micro-batch of data items from the first stream.
2.  Calculate the actual processing time for this batch.
3.  Update `processing_time_history` with the new processing time.
4.  Recalculate `drift_rate`.
5.  Calculate `predicted_processing_time` for the first stream using `drift_rate` and `prediction_horizon`.
6.  Calculate the expected arrival time of corresponding data from the second stream.
7.  Adjust the first join window boundary dynamically based on `predicted_processing_time` and `expected_arrival_time`.

**4. Algorithm – Processing Each Batch (Second Stream):**

1.  Receive a micro-batch of data items from the second stream.
2.  Calculate the actual processing time for this batch.
3.  Update `processing_time_history` with the new processing time.
4.  Recalculate `drift_rate`.
5.  Calculate `predicted_processing_time` for the second stream using `drift_rate` and `prediction_horizon`.
6.  Compare the observed arrival time with expected arrival time.
7.  Adjust the second join window boundary dynamically based on `predicted_processing_time` and the comparison.

**5. Window Adjustment Logic:**

*   If `predicted_processing_time` indicates a potential drift exceeding `drift_threshold`, preemptively adjust the join window boundaries.
*   Window adjustment should be proportional to the predicted drift.  Larger drifts require larger adjustments.
*   Ensure window adjustments do not exceed pre-defined minimum or maximum limits.

**6. Pseudocode - Window Adjustment:**

```
function adjust_window(stream_state, predicted_processing_time, drift_threshold, base_join_window):
    drift = predicted_processing_time - stream_state.estimated_processing_time
    if abs(drift) > drift_threshold:
        adjustment_factor = drift / drift_threshold  # Scale adjustment to drift magnitude
        new_window_size = base_join_window + (adjustment_factor * base_join_window)  # Proportional adjustment

        # Clamp window size to minimum and maximum values
        new_window_size = max(MIN_WINDOW_SIZE, min(MAX_WINDOW_SIZE, new_window_size))
        stream_state.estimated_processing_time = predicted_processing_time #Update estimate
        return new_window_size
    else:
        return base_join_window
```

**7. Implementation Notes:**

*   The `prediction_horizon` should be tuned based on the expected frequency of processing time variations.
*   The `drift_threshold` should be set to balance responsiveness to drift with the risk of unnecessary window adjustments.
*   Consider using smoothing techniques (e.g., moving averages) to reduce noise in the `drift_rate` calculation.
*   This approach can be extended to handle multiple streams by calculating drift rates and adjusting windows for each stream independently.
