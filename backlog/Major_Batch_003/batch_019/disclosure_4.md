## Dynamic Content Delivery via Predicted User 'Flow State'

**Specification:** System for predicting a user’s cognitive state ('flow state') based on mobile device data, and dynamically adjusting content delivery – beyond simple ad targeting – to maximize engagement and perceived value.

**Core Concept:**  The existing patent identifies ‘hotspots’ based on aggregate media consumption. This system layers *individual* user state prediction onto that geographical awareness, anticipating not just *if* a user will engage, but *what kind* of content will most effectively capture their attention *right now*, based on inferred cognitive load and emotional state.

**Data Inputs:**

*   **Geolocation:** (as per original patent) – identifies user location & relevant ‘hotspot’.
*   **Device Motion Data:** Accelerometer, gyroscope data to infer user activity (walking, running, stationary, commuting).  Raw data and derived features: speed, acceleration, jerk, turning radius.
*   **App Usage Patterns:**  Detailed log of app switching, duration of use, frequency, time of day. Categorization of apps (productivity, social, gaming, news).
*   **Keyboard/Screen Interaction:**  Typing speed, frequency of edits, scrolling speed, swipe patterns, touch pressure. (Privacy Considerations:  Data anonymization & user opt-in required)
*   **Audio Input (Optional/Opt-In):** Analysis of ambient sound (traffic, music, speech) to infer environment & emotional context. (Requires significant privacy safeguards)

**Processing & State Prediction:**

1.  **Feature Extraction:** Raw sensor data is processed to create a feature vector representing user state.
2.  **State Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically an LSTM – is trained on a large dataset of labeled user activity (labeled with subjective ‘flow’ states – e.g., ‘focused’, ‘relaxed’, ‘stressed’, ‘bored’ – gathered via user surveys and/or biometric data in a controlled environment).  The RNN learns to map feature vectors to predicted flow state probabilities.
3.  **Contextual Enrichment:** Predicted flow state is combined with hotspot data and user profile information (age, gender, interests) to create a contextual profile.

**Dynamic Content Delivery:**

1.  **Content Library:** A diverse content library is curated, categorized by content type (video, article, game, audio) and ‘cognitive demand’ (low, medium, high) and ‘emotional tone’ (positive, negative, neutral).
2.  **Content Selection:** Based on the contextual profile, a content selection algorithm chooses the content most likely to resonate with the user.  For example:
    *   **High Cognitive Load (commuting, working):** Short-form, visually-engaging content (memes, infographics, brief news summaries).
    *   **Low Cognitive Load (relaxing at home):** Long-form, immersive content (documentaries, podcasts, games).
    *   **Positive Emotional State:** Upbeat, inspiring content.
    *   **Negative Emotional State:** Calming, empathetic content.
3.  **Adaptive Delivery:** Content is delivered via push notifications, in-app recommendations, or dynamic ad insertion.  A/B testing is used to optimize content selection and delivery strategies.

**Pseudocode (Content Selection Algorithm):**

```
function selectContent(userContext) {
  cognitiveDemand = userContext.cognitiveDemand;
  emotionalState = userContext.emotionalState;

  // Define content weights based on context
  weights = {
    "shortFormVideo": 0.1,
    "longFormVideo": 0.1,
    "article": 0.1,
    "game": 0.1,
    "podcast": 0.1,
  };

  // Adjust weights based on context
  if (cognitiveDemand == "high") {
    weights["shortFormVideo"] = 0.5;
    weights["article"] = 0.3;
  } else if (cognitiveDemand == "low") {
    weights["longFormVideo"] = 0.5;
    weights["podcast"] = 0.3;
  }

  if (emotionalState == "positive") {
    weights["longFormVideo"] += 0.2; // Boost positive content
  } else if (emotionalState == "negative") {
    weights["podcast"] += 0.2; // Boost calming content
  }

  // Normalize weights
  totalWeight = sum(weights.values());
  for (key, value in weights) {
    weights[key] = weights[key] / totalWeight;
  }

  // Randomly select content based on weights
  selectedContent = weightedRandomChoice(weights.keys());

  return selectedContent;
}
```

**Privacy Considerations:**  Strict adherence to data privacy regulations is crucial. All data collection must be transparent, require user consent, and allow users to opt-out at any time. Data anonymization and aggregation techniques should be used whenever possible.  The system should be designed with privacy-by-design principles in mind.
