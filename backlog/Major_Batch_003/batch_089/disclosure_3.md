## Dependent Account "Life Mode" Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the dependent account monitoring beyond simple content/contact regulation to simulate distinct "life modes" for the child, altering device functionality and available apps based on pre-defined schedules or parental input. This goes beyond filtering *what* they access, to *how* they access it.

**Specs:**

*   **Profile Types:**
    *   **School Mode:** Limits app access to educational apps, disables games and social media.  May activate a simplified UI, focus mode, and restrict internet access to approved educational websites.  Timetable integration to automatically activate/deactivate based on school hours.
    *   **Homework Mode:** Similar to School Mode, but with limited access to specific research websites or tools. Could include a built-in timer for focused work sessions.
    *   **Creative Mode:**  Access to art/music/video editing apps, increased storage allocation. Filters content *about* creating content (tutorials, inspiration).
    *   **Family Time Mode:**  Limits screen time, prioritizes family-focused apps (video calling, shared photo albums), silences notifications from outside the family group.
    *   **Sleep Mode:**  Full device shutdown, or limited access to bedtime stories/music apps.

*   **Dynamic UI Adaptation:** The device UI adapts visually to reflect the current mode.  For example, School Mode might display a clean, minimalist interface with school-related widgets. Creative Mode could be bright and colorful, emphasizing artistic tools.

*   **App "Bundling":**  Allowing parents to create app bundles that automatically launch when a specific mode is activated. For example, a "Homework" bundle might launch a note-taking app, a research browser, and a calculator.

*   **"Proximity Mode":** If the managing device (parent's phone) is within a certain range of the dependent device, restrictions loosen. (e.g., unlocks access to limited messaging for coordination).

*   **Behavioral Learning:** Track dependent account usage within each mode. Suggest optimizations to parental controls based on observed behavior (e.g., suggests blocking a distracting website based on frequent access during Homework Mode).

**Pseudocode (Managing Account Interface):**

```
// Create New Mode
function createNewMode(modeName, allowedApps, timeSchedule, uiTheme) {
  // Save mode configuration to database
  // Update dependent device configuration
}

// Edit Existing Mode
function editMode(modeID, newAllowedApps, newTimeSchedule, newUITheme) {
  // Update mode configuration in database
  // Update dependent device configuration
}

// Activate Mode (Manually)
function activateMode(dependentAccountID, modeID) {
  // Send signal to dependent device to switch to specified mode
}

// Automatic Mode Switching (Background Service)
function checkTimeSchedule(dependentAccountID) {
  // Retrieve current time
  // Retrieve mode schedule for dependent account
  // If current time matches schedule, activate corresponding mode
}

//Realtime dependency
IF (parentLocation NEAR dependentLocation) THEN
  loosensRestrictions()
ELSE
  enforcesRestrictions()
```

**Technical Considerations:**

*   Requires deep integration with the dependent device's OS.
*   Needs a robust system for managing app permissions.
*   Privacy implications around location tracking.
*   Potential for system conflicts if multiple apps attempt to control device behavior.
