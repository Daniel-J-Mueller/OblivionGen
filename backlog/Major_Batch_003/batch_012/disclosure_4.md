## Multi-Modal Neuro-Feedback System with Haptic & Auditory Integration

**System Overview:** A wearable system extending the optical BCI principles to incorporate localized haptic stimulation and binaural auditory feedback. This aims to amplify cognitive signal detection and provide a richer, more intuitive BCI experience.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Optical Sensor Array:** (Based on patent's light source/detector system). High-density VCSEL array and CMOS detector array for fNIRS (functional near-infrared spectroscopy) data acquisition. Modified to include multiple wavelengths for deeper tissue penetration and enhanced signal clarity.
2.  **Haptic Stimulation Array:** An array of micro-actuators (piezoelectric or similar) integrated into the head-mountable interface, positioned to provide localized tactile feedback to the scalp. These will be positioned *between* the optical sensors.
3.  **Binaural Auditory System:** Miniature bone-conduction transducers embedded within the head-mountable interface, delivering targeted auditory stimuli to each ear.
4.  **Signal Processing Unit:** (Dedicated, low-power FPGA/ASIC). Processes fNIRS, haptic, and auditory data streams in real-time. Implements advanced signal processing algorithms for noise reduction, artifact removal, and cognitive state decoding.
5.  **Neuro-Feedback Engine:** Software module responsible for mapping decoded cognitive states to specific haptic and auditory feedback patterns. Allows for customizable neuro-feedback protocols tailored to individual users and applications.
6. **Wireless Communication Module:** Bluetooth 5.0 or similar for data transmission to external devices (smartphone, computer, etc.).

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition:**
    *   fNIRS: Continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow changes. Sample rate: 10-20 Hz. Wavelengths: 650nm, 850nm, 940nm.
    *   Haptic: Measures skin conductance changes in response to stimuli. Sample rate: 50-100 Hz.
    *   Auditory: Measures auditory evoked potentials. Sample rate: 200-500 Hz.

2.  **Signal Processing:**
    *   **Preprocessing:** Noise filtering (spatial and temporal), motion artifact correction, baseline correction.
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Identification of relevant spectral features in fNIRS data (oxy-hemoglobin, deoxy-hemoglobin concentrations). Detection of skin conductance response amplitudes and latencies. Analysis of auditory evoked potential waveforms.
    *   **Cognitive State Decoding:** Machine learning models (e.g., Support Vector Machines, Neural Networks) trained to classify cognitive states based on multi-modal feature vectors.

3.  **Neuro-Feedback Implementation:**

    *   **Haptic Feedback:** Varying the intensity, frequency, and pattern of haptic stimulation to reinforce desired cognitive states. For example, gentle pulses could indicate successful mental focus, while stronger vibrations could signal distraction.
    *   **Auditory Feedback:** Utilizing binaural beats, isochronic tones, or customized soundscapes to modulate brain activity and promote specific cognitive states. The auditory signals will be phase-locked to the detected fNIRS activity.
    *   **Adaptive Algorithm:** The neuro-feedback algorithm dynamically adjusts the haptic and auditory feedback parameters based on the userâ€™s real-time brain activity and performance.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main loop
while (true) {
  // Acquire fNIRS, haptic, and auditory data
  fNIRS_data = acquire_fNIRS_data();
  haptic_data = acquire_haptic_data();
  auditory_data = acquire_auditory_data();

  // Preprocess data
  fNIRS_processed = preprocess_fNIRS(fNIRS_data);
  haptic_processed = preprocess_haptic(haptic_data);
  auditory_processed = preprocess_auditory(auditory_data);

  // Extract features
  fNIRS_features = extract_features(fNIRS_processed);
  haptic_features = extract_features(haptic_processed);
  auditory_features = extract_features(auditory_processed);

  // Combine features
  combined_features = concatenate(fNIRS_features, haptic_features, auditory_features);

  // Decode cognitive state
  cognitive_state = decode_state(combined_features, trained_model);

  // Generate feedback
  haptic_feedback = generate_haptic_feedback(cognitive_state);
  auditory_feedback = generate_auditory_feedback(cognitive_state);

  // Apply feedback
  apply_haptic_feedback(haptic_feedback);
  apply_auditory_feedback(auditory_feedback);
}
```
