**Dynamic Emotional Resonance Mapping for Video Editing**

**Concept:** Expand the timed element functionality by incorporating real-time emotional analysis of both the video *and* the chosen audio track to automatically suggest and implement timed elements (stickers, animations, effects) which amplify the emotional impact of the clip.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Video clip, audio track (optional – can use video’s existing audio), user-defined emotional “intensity” preference (Low, Medium, High – affects the aggressiveness of the suggestion algorithm).
*   **Emotional Analysis Module:** Utilizes a pre-trained AI model (likely a recurrent neural network) to analyze video frames (facial expressions, scene content) and audio waveforms (tone, tempo, lyrics – if available) to determine the dominant emotions present at each point in time. Output: Emotion vector (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise) with a confidence score for each emotion, timestamped.
*   **Timed Element Library:** A database of stickers, animations, effects, and short musical phrases, each tagged with associated emotions.  Tagging is multi-faceted: primary emotion, secondary emotions, intensity level (subtle, moderate, strong), and aesthetic style (e.g., minimalist, cartoonish, dramatic).
*   **Resonance Algorithm:** This is the core of the system. It compares the emotion vector derived from the video/audio with the emotion tags in the timed element library. The algorithm calculates a “resonance score” based on:
    *   Emotion Match: How closely the emotions align.
    *   Intensity Match:  How closely the intensity levels align.
    *   Temporal Coherence: Preference for elements that sustain their emotional impact for a reasonable duration.
*   **Suggestion Engine:** Based on the resonance scores, the engine generates a timeline of suggested timed elements.  Suggestions include:
    *   Element Type (sticker, animation, effect, music snippet)
    *   Start Time
    *   End Time
    *   Placement (position on screen, layering order)
    *   Intensity/Opacity Adjustment
*   **User Interface:**
    *   “Emotional Overlay”: Visual representation of the emotional analysis on the video timeline (e.g., color-coded bars representing dominant emotions).
    *   “Suggestion Timeline”: Displays the suggested timed elements as bars on a timeline, aligned with the video timeline.
    *   “Auto-Apply” button:  Applies all suggestions with default settings.
    *   “Refine” mode: Allows the user to manually adjust the suggested elements (timing, placement, intensity) or add/remove elements.
*   **Pseudocode (Resonance Algorithm):**

```
function calculateResonanceScore(videoEmotionVector, elementEmotionTags):
  score = 0
  for each emotion in videoEmotionVector:
    if emotion is present in elementEmotionTags:
      score += (videoEmotionVector[emotion] * elementEmotionTags[emotion])
  return score
```

*   **Advanced Features:**
    *   “Emotional Blending”: Smooth transitions between different timed elements to create a more cohesive emotional flow.
    *   “Contextual Awareness”:  Consider the overall theme or genre of the video to prioritize certain types of timed elements.
    *   “User Emotional Profile”: Learn the user’s emotional preferences over time to provide more personalized suggestions.
