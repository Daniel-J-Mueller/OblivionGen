## Dynamic Interference Prediction & Pre-emptive Beam Shaping

**Concept:** Augment the existing interference management system with a predictive element. Instead of *reacting* to interference, anticipate it based on node movement, environmental changes (e.g., new obstacles), and learned traffic patterns. This involves creating a localized 'digital twin' for each node, predicting its future interference footprint, and preemptively adjusting beamforming weights.

**Specifications:**

*   **Node Profiling Module:** Each node continuously monitors its surroundings (signal strength, RSSI, detected node movements â€“ estimated via Doppler shift or trilateration if possible) and generates a dynamic profile representing its operational environment. This includes a probabilistic model of potential interference sources and a 'shadow' representing the areas most likely to experience interference.

*   **Prediction Engine:**  A localized prediction engine runs on each node. It leverages the node profile and historical data to forecast future interference.  Algorithms:
    *   **Kalman Filtering:** Predicts node movements and signal propagation.
    *   **Markov Chain Modeling:** Learns traffic patterns and predicts future link usage.
    *   **Ray Tracing/Path Loss Modeling:** Simulates signal propagation in the environment, accounting for obstacles.

*   **Preemptive Beamforming Adjustment:** Based on the predicted interference, the system proactively adjusts beamforming weights *before* interference occurs.
    *   **Optimization Function:** Minimize predicted interference *and* maximize predicted throughput. Constraints include transmit power limits and beamforming hardware capabilities.
    *   **Adjustment Granularity:** Adjustments occur on a per-link basis, targeting specific nodes or sectors.
    *   **Time Horizon:**  Predictions and adjustments cover a rolling time window (e.g., 100-500ms).

*   **Distributed Coordination:** Implement a distributed coordination protocol to avoid conflicting adjustments. This can be achieved via:
    *   **Gossip Protocol:** Nodes periodically share their predicted interference maps and adjustment plans with neighbors.
    *   **Consensus Algorithm:** (e.g., Raft or Paxos) used for critical adjustments that affect multiple nodes.

*   **Learning & Adaptation:** The system continuously learns from its performance.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:**  A reward function based on throughput and interference levels.
    *   **Federated Learning:** Share learned models between nodes without sharing raw data.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_interference(node_profile, historical_data, time_horizon):
  # Estimate future node positions using Kalman Filtering
  future_positions = kalman_filter(node_profile.current_position, node_profile.velocity, historical_data.node_movements)

  # Predict future traffic patterns using Markov Chain Modeling
  future_traffic = markov_chain_model(historical_data.traffic_patterns)

  # Simulate signal propagation based on future positions and traffic
  interference_map = ray_tracing(future_positions, future_traffic, environment_map)

  # Return predicted interference map
  return interference_map
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Increased processing power on each node to run prediction algorithms.
*   High-precision location tracking capabilities (e.g., UWB or advanced RSSI techniques).
*   Enhanced communication bandwidth for sharing interference maps and adjustment plans.
