## Dynamic Content Stitching for Personalized Narrative

**Concept:** Extend adaptive reframing to *narrative* elements within video content, creating unique viewing experiences based on user interaction and inferred emotional state.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Video source, user interaction data (clicks, pauses, skips), real-time emotion analysis (facial expressions via webcam, voice analysis), consumption surface details (device type, screen size, orientation).
*   **Core Module: Narrative Database & Stitching Engine.**
    *   The system will maintain a database of "narrative fragments" â€“ pre-edited short video clips representing alternative story branches, character reactions, or contextual details. These fragments are tagged with metadata related to emotional tone (joy, sadness, anger, fear, neutral), thematic relevance, and branching logic.
    *   The Stitching Engine dynamically selects and concatenates these fragments into the main video stream based on:
        *   **User Interaction:** If a user pauses frequently during a scene depicting conflict, the system can insert a fragment showing a character expressing remorse or attempting to de-escalate the situation.
        *   **Emotional State:**  If emotion analysis detects sadness, the system could insert clips showing heartwarming moments or offering a hopeful outlook. Conversely, if a user appears bored, the system can introduce a fast-paced action sequence or a comedic interlude.
        *   **Consumption Surface:**  Tailor fragment length/complexity to device. A smartwatch version may prioritize concise, emotionally resonant snippets while a large-screen TV can accommodate more elaborate branching narratives.
*   **Machine Learning Model:**
    *   A reinforcement learning model trains on user engagement metrics (watch time, completion rate, re-watches, social sharing) to optimize fragment selection strategies.
    *   The model learns to predict the impact of different fragment choices on user engagement and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
*   **Reframing Integration:**  Combine with existing reframing tech. The selected fragment's aspect ratio is adjusted *before* being stitched into the main video, ensuring seamless visual integration.

**Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION StitchVideo(videoSource, userInteractionData, emotionAnalysisData, consumptionSurfaceData)

    narrativeDB = LoadNarrativeDatabase()
    fragmentSelectionCriteria = DeriveCriteria(userInteractionData, emotionAnalysisData, consumptionSurfaceData)
    selectedFragments = SelectFragments(narrativeDB, fragmentSelectionCriteria)

    IF selectedFragments is not empty THEN
        stitchedVideo = StitchFragmentsIntoVideo(videoSource, selectedFragments)
        reframedStitchedVideo = ReframFragments(stitchedVideo, consumptionSurfaceData)
        RETURN reframedStitchedVideo
    ELSE
        RETURN videoSource // Return original video if no fragments selected
    ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **User-Generated Fragments:** Allow users to contribute their own short video clips or audio reactions, expanding the range of available narrative options.
*   **Collaborative Storytelling:**  Enable multiple users to influence the narrative trajectory in real-time, creating a shared viewing experience.
*   **Personalized Character Interactions:** Use AI to generate tailored dialogue or reactions from virtual characters based on user preferences and emotional state.
