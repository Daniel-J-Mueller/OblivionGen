**Dynamic Collaborative "Remix" Layers**

**Concept:** Expand the collaborative video editing concept to allow users to add *layers* of content on top of the original and each other’s edits, creating a “remix” effect. These layers aren’t necessarily about *changing* the base video, but augmenting it – think interactive annotations, dynamic data overlays, branching narratives, or even mini-games embedded within the video.

**Specs:**

*   **Layer Types:**
    *   **Annotation Layer:** Text, drawings, highlights, timestamps - pinned to specific video moments.
    *   **Data Layer:** Real-time data streams (weather, stock prices, social media feeds) displayed as overlays synchronized with the video.
    *   **Interactive Layer:** Buttons, polls, quizzes integrated into the video. User interaction affects video playback or reveals content.
    *   **Branching Layer:** At specific points, the video splits into multiple paths, each triggered by user choice. Think “choose your own adventure” video.
    *   **Game Layer:** Simple, browser-based mini-games embedded within the video. Score/progress tracked and potentially shared.
*   **Layer Visibility/Permissions:** Each user can control which layers they see and who can add/edit layers. Options: Public, Friends Only, Specific Users.
*   **Layer Blending Modes:** Control how layers are combined visually. Standard blending modes (Multiply, Screen, Overlay) + custom modes.
*   **Time-Based Layer Control:** Layers can be scheduled to appear/disappear at specific times, creating dynamic effects.
*   **Layer Marketplace/Sharing:** Users can create and share layer templates with others. Potential for a marketplace where creators can monetize layers.
*   **3D Layer Support:** Implement support for 3D models and animations as layers.

**Pseudocode (Layer Creation/Management):**

```
Class Layer {
  String layerType; // Annotation, Data, Interactive, Branching, Game, 3D
  String creatorID;
  String layerName;
  DateTime startTime;
  DateTime endTime;
  Boolean visible;
  String layerContent; // JSON/XML containing layer-specific data
  String blendingMode;
  List<String> permissions;

  Function createLayer() {
    // Save layer metadata to server
    // Return layer ID
  }

  Function updateLayer() {
    // Update layer metadata
  }

  Function deleteLayer() {
    // Delete layer metadata
  }

  Function getLayerData() {
    // Return layer data
  }
}

Function addLayerToVideo(videoID, layerID) {
  // Associate layer with video
}

Function removeLayerFromVideo(videoID, layerID) {
  // Dissociate layer from video
}

Function renderVideoWithLayers(videoID) {
  // Load video and associated layers
  // Render video frame by frame, applying layers based on time and blending mode
  // Return rendered video
}
```

**Engineer Notes:**

*   This will require a robust video rendering engine capable of handling complex layer compositions.
*   Consider using a modular architecture to allow for easy addition of new layer types.
*   Focus on optimizing performance to ensure smooth playback, even with multiple layers.
*   Develop a user-friendly interface for creating and managing layers.
*   Explore the use of WebAssembly for client-side rendering to improve performance.
