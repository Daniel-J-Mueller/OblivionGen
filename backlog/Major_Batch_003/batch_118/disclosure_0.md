## Dynamic Compositional "Mood" Generation

**Specification:** A system extending the core compositional framework to generate multiple renderings not based on *channel* (story/feed) but on *mood* or aesthetic intent, leveraging AI-driven stylistic transformations.

**Core Concept:** Users define an overall “mood” for their composition (e.g., “Energetic”, “Dreamy”, “Minimalist”, “Vintage”). The system then generates multiple renderings, each optimized for that mood, applying transformations to visuals and text.  These renderings *could* still be deployed to different channels, but the primary driver is aesthetic intent, not channel constraints.

**System Components:**

1.  **Mood Palette:** A curated library of predefined moods, each associated with a set of stylistic parameters. These parameters control aspects like:
    *   **Color Grading:** (e.g., warm/cool tones, desaturation, vibrancy)
    *   **Filter Application:** (AI-driven stylistic filters –  “Impressionist”, “Cyberpunk”, “Noir”)
    *   **Typography Styles:** (Font choices, sizes, weights, spacing, effects like shadows or outlines)
    *   **Animation/Transition Styles:** (e.g., fast cuts, slow fades, glitch effects)
    *   **Overlay Graphics/Textures:** (e.g., light leaks, grain, bokeh)
2.  **AI Style Transfer Engine:**  A neural network trained on a vast dataset of images and text styles. This engine receives the user's content (photos, text) and the selected mood parameters, and applies corresponding stylistic transformations.
3.  **Dynamic Rendering Generator:**  This module creates multiple renderings of the composition, each reflecting the chosen mood. It adapts the rendering process based on content type (photos, text, stickers) and mood parameters.  For photos, it performs color grading, filter application, and potentially object recognition to enhance specific elements. For text, it applies font styles, effects, and potentially dynamic text animation.
4.  **Mood-Aware Sticker Library:** An expanded sticker library tagged with mood associations. When a user selects a mood, the sticker library filters to show relevant stickers. Additionally, the sticker engine can *transform* sticker appearance to better fit the selected mood (e.g., desaturating stickers for a “Minimalist” mood).
5.  **Interactive Mood Editor:** Allows users to fine-tune mood parameters beyond the predefined options. This could involve adjusting color curves, filter intensity, typography settings, or adding custom effects.
6.  **Rendering Preview & Selection:**  Displays multiple renderings side-by-side, allowing the user to compare and choose the best one.  A "Mood Strength" slider allows for quick adjustment of the overall stylistic intensity.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateMoodRenderings(content, mood):
  moodParameters = getMoodParameters(mood)

  renderingList = []

  //Photo Rendering
  for each photo in content.photos:
    transformedPhoto = applyPhotoTransformations(photo, moodParameters)
    renderingList.add(transformedPhoto)

  //Text Rendering
  for each textBlock in content.text:
    transformedTextBlock = applyTextTransformations(textBlock, moodParameters)
    renderingList.add(transformedTextBlock)

  //Sticker Rendering
  for each sticker in content.stickers:
    transformedSticker = applyStickerTransformations(sticker, moodParameters)
    renderingList.add(transformedSticker)

  return renderingList
```

**Example Workflow:**

1.  User uploads photos and writes text.
2.  User selects "Dreamy" mood.
3.  System retrieves “Dreamy” mood parameters (soft color grading, subtle blur, flowing typography).
4.  System generates multiple renderings: a slideshow with desaturated photos and flowing text for "Stories", a collage with blurred photos and elegant typography for “Newsfeed”.
5.  User reviews renderings and selects the best one, or further adjusts the mood parameters.
