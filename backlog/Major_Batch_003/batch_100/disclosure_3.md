## Dynamic Content ‘Echoing’ Based on Real-World Event Correlation

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Event Correlation Engine (ECE)
*   **Input Data Streams:**
    *   Content Distribution Campaign Data (as per existing patent - impressions, clicks, conversions, budget, bids, etc.)
    *   Real-World Event Data Feed: Structured data from APIs providing information on global/local events (news, weather, sports scores, social media trends, economic indicators, stock market fluctuations, etc.).  Data should be categorized (e.g., "Natural Disaster", "Economic Shift", "Popular Culture Event").
    *   Geographic Data: Location data associated with content impressions and real-world events.
*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Event-Campaign Mapping:** ECE analyzes incoming real-world event data, identifying events potentially relevant to the content being distributed. Relevance determined by keyword matching between event descriptions and content keywords, and by event categorization.
    2.  **Echo Rule Generation:** Based on event relevance and severity, the ECE generates “Echo Rules”. Echo Rules define how the content campaign should be modified *in response to the event*. These modifications aren’t simply bid adjustments or budget increases. They involve altering the *content itself* or the targeting.
    3.  **Content Variation Library:**  A repository of pre-approved content variations. These variations are slight alterations of the original content – different headlines, images, calls to action, even entirely different ad copy focusing on a slightly different angle.
    4.  **Dynamic Content Insertion:** When an Echo Rule is triggered, the system dynamically inserts the appropriate content variation into the active campaign.
    5.  **Localized Echoing:** The system prioritizes localized events and applies Echo Rules based on geographic proximity between the event and the content impression.
    6.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Integrates sentiment analysis of event-related social media data. Positive sentiment amplifies campaign reach; negative sentiment may trigger a temporary pause or modified messaging.

*   **Output:** Modified content distribution campaign with dynamically adjusted content and targeting.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Event Correlation Engine

function analyzeEvent(eventData) {
    keywords = extractKeywords(eventData.description);
    category = eventData.category;
    location = eventData.location;

    relevantCampaigns = findCampaignsMatchingKeywords(keywords);

    for each campaign in relevantCampaigns {
        if (locationWithinRadius(campaign.targetLocation, location, 500km)) { //Example radius
            generateEchoRule(campaign, category);
        }
    }
}

function generateEchoRule(campaign, eventCategory) {
    if (eventCategory == "Natural Disaster") {
        //Example: Pause campaign in affected area for 24hrs, then display message of support
        echoRule = {
            action: "pause",
            duration: "24h",
            location: campaign.targetLocation
        };
    } else if (eventCategory == "Sports Victory") {
        //Example: Display celebratory ad variation with team colors
        echoRule = {
            action: "insertVariation",
            variation: "celebratoryAd",
            location: campaign.targetLocation
        };
    }
    //Add more categories and variations as needed
}

function applyEchoRule(campaign, echoRule) {
    if (echoRule.action == "pause") {
        pauseCampaign(campaign, echoRule.duration, echoRule.location);
    } else if (echoRule.action == "insertVariation") {
        insertContentVariation(campaign, echoRule.variation, echoRule.location);
    }
}

//Main Loop
while (incomingEvents) {
    event = getNextEvent();
    analyzeEvent(event);
    applyEchoRules();
}
```

**Content Variation Example:**

Original Ad: "Get 20% Off Running Shoes!"

Variation (after a local marathon): "Congratulations Runners! Celebrate Your Achievement with 20% Off Running Shoes!"

Variation (during a heatwave): "Stay Cool and Comfortable on Your Runs! 20% Off Lightweight Running Shoes!"
