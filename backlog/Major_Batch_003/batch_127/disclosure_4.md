## Adaptive Haptic Feedback for Head Gesture Confirmation

**Concept:** Enhance the user experience by providing subtle, directional haptic feedback correlated to recognized head gestures. This isn't just about *knowing* the gesture was understood, it's about creating a more intuitive and nuanced interaction.  Instead of solely relying on visual or auditory confirmation, we provide tactile cues *on the head-mounted device itself*.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Array:** Integrate a low-profile array of micro-actuators (e.g., voice coil actuators, piezoelectric elements) strategically positioned around the head-mounted device’s headband and/or earcups.  Density should be sufficient to create localized tactile sensations – approximately 20-30 actuators.
*   **Gesture-Haptic Mapping:**  Develop a mapping system that associates each recognized head gesture (as identified by the existing IMU-based system) with a specific haptic pattern.  This is *not* a 1:1 mapping, but utilizes directional and intensity variations.
    *   **Up/Down (Affirmative/Negative):**  Vertical vibration on the back of the head (subtle pulse). Intensity indicates confidence level of gesture recognition.
    *   **Left/Right (Selection/Deselection):**  Localized vibration on the corresponding side of the head. 
    *   **Nod & Hold (Confirm & Lock):**  Sustained, gentle vibration on the forehead.
    *   **Tilt (Scroll/Pan):**  A linear progression of vibrations along the headband corresponding to the tilt angle.
*   **Dynamic Intensity Scaling:**  Implement an algorithm that adjusts haptic intensity based on ambient noise levels and user preferences. User can adjust intensity or disable haptics entirely.
*   **Contextual Haptic Overrides:** Allow the assistant system to override the standard haptic mappings in specific situations. For example, during a navigation task, a left/right head tilt could trigger haptic feedback on the side the user should turn, *regardless* of the default selection/deselection mapping.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Include a built-in calibration routine to personalize the haptic feedback to individual head shapes and sensitivities. This routine uses gentle, automated sweeps of the actuators while the user provides feedback on comfort and detectability.
*   **Power Management:** The haptic system must be designed for low power consumption. Utilize pulse-width modulation (PWM) to control actuator intensity and minimize battery drain. 

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Trigger):**

```
function triggerHapticFeedback(gesture, confidenceLevel, context) {

  // Base haptic pattern based on gesture
  switch (gesture) {
    case "up_nod":
      hapticPattern = "vertical_pulse";
      break;
    case "down_nod":
      hapticPattern = "vertical_pulse";
      break;
    case "left_shake":
      hapticPattern = "left_side_pulse";
      break;
    case "right_shake":
      hapticPattern = "right_side_pulse";
      break;
    // Add other gestures
  }

  // Adjust intensity based on confidence level
  intensity = confidenceLevel * 0.5; // Scale confidence to intensity range

  // Override with contextual information if available
  if (context == "navigation") {
    if (direction == "left") {
      hapticPattern = "left_side_pulse";
    } else if (direction == "right") {
      hapticPattern = "right_side_pulse";
    }
  }

  // Activate actuators corresponding to haptic pattern and intensity
  activateActuators(hapticPattern, intensity);
}
