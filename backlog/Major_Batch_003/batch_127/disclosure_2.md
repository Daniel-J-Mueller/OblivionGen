## Dynamic Biometric 'Bloom' for Fraud Prevention

**Concept:** Expand the endpoint verification to proactively 'bloom' biometric data, creating a layered, dynamic signature beyond simple matching. This aims to detect sophisticated spoofing attempts and account takeover risks *during* the verification process, not just after a failed match.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Endpoint Device: Standard smartphone or computer with camera, temperature sensor, pulse sensor (as in the provided patent).  *Crucially*, a low-level access API for raw sensor data is required, bypassing typical OS filtering/smoothing.
*   Processing: Endpoint device must have sufficient processing power for real-time data analysis (likely requiring dedicated hardware acceleration – a small co-processor).

**2. Data Acquisition & Pre-processing:**

*   **Multi-Spectral Capture:**  Camera captures not just visible light, but also near-infrared (NIR) and potentially thermal data simultaneously.
*   **Micro-Expression Analysis:** Software analyzes subtle facial muscle movements (micro-expressions) during the verification process. This requires a high frame rate video capture (minimum 60fps).
*   **Physiological Signal Collection:**  Temperature and pulse sensors collect baseline physiological data *before* the verification prompt.
*   **Raw Data Stream:** All sensor data is streamed as raw, unfiltered data – minimal pre-processing at the endpoint.
*   **‘Challenge’ Sequence:**  A randomized sequence of actions is presented to the user *during* capture.  Examples:
    *   Slight head tilts (up, down, left, right).
    *   Blinking rhythmically.
    *   Subtle smile/frown.
    *   Speaking a randomly generated phrase.

**3. ‘Bloom’ Signature Generation:**

*   **Data Fusion:** Raw sensor data streams (visible light, NIR, thermal, micro-expressions, temperature, pulse) are time-synchronized and fused into a single ‘Bloom’ signature.
*   **Dynamic Feature Extraction:**  Features are *not* static. Instead, the system extracts features that *change* in response to the ‘Challenge’ sequence. This is critical for detecting 'replay' attacks using static biometric data. Examples:
    *   NIR reflectance patterns under different head tilts.
    *   Thermal gradient changes during facial expressions.
    *   Pulse rate variability during speech.
    *   Micro-expression timing in response to the random phrase.
*   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Utilize techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or autoencoders to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while preserving key dynamic information.

**4. Verification & Risk Scoring:**

*   **Bloom Matching:** Compare the generated ‘Bloom’ signature against a stored reference ‘Bloom’ signature for the user. *Focus is on the dynamic characteristics, not just static similarity*.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Employ anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) to identify unusual patterns in the ‘Bloom’ signature that deviate from the user’s baseline.
*   **Risk Score Calculation:**  Assign a risk score based on the Bloom Matching score, anomaly detection score, and the consistency of the physiological signals.
*   **Adaptive Authentication:**  Adjust the authentication requirements based on the risk score.  High-risk scores trigger multi-factor authentication or further verification steps.

**5. System Architecture:**

*   **Endpoint Module:** Responsible for data acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, and Bloom signature generation.
*   **Secure Enclave:** All sensitive data and cryptographic keys are stored and processed within a secure enclave on the endpoint device.
*   **Server Module:** Stores user reference Bloom signatures, manages risk scoring, and provides APIs for authentication services.  *The server does not have access to raw biometric data*. It only receives the risk score.



**Pseudocode (Endpoint Module - Bloom Signature Generation):**

```
function generateBloomSignature() {
    captureRawSensorData(); // Capture video, thermal, pulse, temperature
    applyChallengeSequence(); // Present random actions to user
    extractDynamicFeatures(rawSensorData);
    bloomSignature = createBloomSignatureFromFeatures();
    return bloomSignature;
}
```

This system moves beyond simple biometric matching to create a dynamic, multi-layered security system that is more resilient to sophisticated attacks. The key is to leverage the *change* in biometric data over time, making it significantly harder to spoof.
