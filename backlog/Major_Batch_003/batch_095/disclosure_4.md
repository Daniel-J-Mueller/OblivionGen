## Dynamic Content "Mood" Classification & Reactive Reel Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond content-centric metrics (image/audio/narrative quality) to incorporate *emotional* or "mood" classification of video content, and leverage this to dynamically assemble reels tailored to a user’s *current* emotional state.

**Specs:**

1.  **Mood Classification Model:**
    *   Input: Video content (frames, audio)
    *   Model: Train a multi-modal deep learning model (CNN for video frames, RNN/Transformer for audio) to classify content into a predefined set of "moods" (e.g., Joyful, Calm, Energetic, Nostalgic, Thoughtful, Melancholy, Exciting).
    *   Output: A probability distribution across the defined mood categories.
    *   Training Data: Utilize a large dataset of video clips explicitly labeled with mood categories.  Augment this with sentiment analysis of any accompanying text (captions, comments).

2.  **User Emotional State Detection:**
    *   Input: Real-time data from user device:
        *   Facial expression analysis (via camera).
        *   Voice tone/inflection analysis (via microphone).
        *   Text input analysis (typing speed, sentiment of messages).
        *   Device usage patterns (time of day, app usage).
        *   Physiological data (if available – heart rate, skin conductance via wearable device).
    *   Model: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Neural Network) to infer the user's current emotional state based on the combined input data.
    *   Output: A probability distribution across a set of emotional states (which may align with or be a refinement of the content mood categories).

3.  **Dynamic Reel Assembly Engine:**
    *   Input:
        *   User’s current emotional state (from Step 2).
        *   Content catalog with pre-computed mood classifications (from Step 1).
        *   User preferences (historical data, explicit interests, social connections).
    *   Algorithm:
        *   **Mood Matching:** Prioritize content whose mood aligns with the user’s current emotional state.  Allow for "mood blends" (e.g., if user is "thoughtful" and "calm", prioritize content that is either "thoughtful" or "calm", or a combination of both).
        *   **Content Diversity:** Introduce a degree of diversity to prevent the reel from becoming repetitive.  Randomly select content from different creators and categories, while still maintaining mood alignment.
        *   **Engagement Prediction:** Leverage a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of user engagement (watch time, likes, shares) based on content characteristics, user preferences, and the current context.  Prioritize content with higher predicted engagement.
        *   **Temporal Decay:** Factor in the age of the content.  Prioritize newer content, but also occasionally introduce "throwback" content to evoke nostalgia.
    *   Output: An ordered list of content items for inclusion in the reel.

4.  **Real-time Adaptation:**
    *   Continuously monitor user interactions with the reel (watch time, skips, likes, shares).
    *   Use this feedback to refine the dynamic reel assembly engine in real-time.
    *   Adjust the mood matching criteria, content diversity parameters, and engagement prediction model based on user behavior.



**Pseudocode:**

```
function generateReel(userId):
  userEmotionalState = detectUserEmotionalState(userId)
  contentCatalog = getContentCatalog()
  moodAlignedContent = filterContent(contentCatalog, userEmotionalState)
  diverseContent = applyDiversity(moodAlignedContent)
  rankedContent = rankContent(diverseContent, userId)
  reel = createReel(rankedContent)
  return reel

function detectUserEmotionalState(userId):
  facialExpression = analyzeFacialExpression(userId)
  voiceTone = analyzeVoiceTone(userId)
  textInput = analyzeTextInput(userId)
  usagePatterns = analyzeUsagePatterns(userId)
  // Combine data using a trained ML model
  emotionalState = predictEmotionalState(facialExpression, voiceTone, textInput, usagePatterns)
  return emotionalState
```
