## Dynamic Cohort Drift & Feature Obfuscation

**Concept:** Expand upon cohort creation by introducing ‘drift’ – the controlled, time-based alteration of cohort membership based on evolving feature data – coupled with layered feature obfuscation to further enhance privacy *beyond* simply limiting certainty. This moves beyond static cohorts towards fluid, self-modifying groupings.

**Specs:**

*   **System Components:** Existing system (as per patent) + Drift Engine + Obfuscation Layer.
*   **Drift Engine:**  A module responsible for continually evaluating cohort membership.
    *   **Drift Rate Parameter:** Configurable parameter defining the percentage of cohort members re-evaluated per defined time interval (e.g., hourly, daily).
    *   **Drift Criteria:** Multiple configurable criteria trigger member reassignment. Examples:
        *   **Feature Value Shift:** If a user's feature value crosses a defined threshold (e.g., ad engagement score increases beyond ‘X’), they are moved to a different cohort.
        *   **Cohort Feature Deviation:**  If a user's feature profile significantly deviates from the *average* profile of their current cohort (based on a configurable standard deviation), they are reassigned.
        *   **Random Drift:** Introduce a small degree of random cohort reassignment to further blur individual associations.
    *   **Cohort Splitting/Merging:**  Drift engine can *split* existing cohorts if feature divergence becomes significant, or *merge* similar cohorts to optimize data utility.

*   **Obfuscation Layer:** Operates on the cohort feature data *before* transmission to the modeler.
    *   **Differential Privacy Application:**  Apply differential privacy mechanisms (e.g., adding noise) to cohort feature data, with configurable epsilon/delta parameters.
    *   **Feature Subsampling:** Randomly exclude a percentage of features from the cohort data transmitted to the modeler.
    *   **Feature Generalization:** Replace specific feature values with generalized categories (e.g., replacing precise age with age ranges).
    *   **Obfuscation Level Parameter:**  A global parameter controlling the *intensity* of all obfuscation techniques. Higher levels prioritize privacy, lower levels prioritize data utility.

*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Initial cohort creation as per the original patent.
    2.  Drift Engine continuously monitors cohort membership based on defined criteria and Drift Rate.
    3.  Obfuscation Layer applies configured obfuscation techniques to cohort feature data *before* transmission.
    4.  Modeler receives obfuscated cohort data and membership information.
    5.  Drift and Obfuscation parameters can be dynamically adjusted by a central privacy controller based on evolving data utility/privacy trade-offs.

**Pseudocode (Drift Engine - Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION EvaluateCohortDrift(cohort, driftRate, driftCriteria):
  members = cohort.getMembers()
  numMembersToEvaluate = INT(len(members) * driftRate)
  evaluatedMembers = RANDOM_SAMPLE(members, numMembersToEvaluate)

  FOR member IN evaluatedMembers:
    FOR criterion IN driftCriteria:
      IF criterion.isMet(member):
        newCohort = findBestMatchingCohort(member)  // Based on feature profile
        moveMember(member, newCohort)

  RETURN cohort
```

**Innovation:**  This expands beyond static privacy thresholds by introducing dynamic cohort evolution and multi-layered feature obfuscation.  The system actively adapts to changing user behavior and applies privacy controls in a granular, configurable way. It moves from *preventing* certainty to *actively reducing* the signal available to the modeler over time. It's not just about what data is shared; it's about how much that data *means*.
