## Dynamic Mood-Based Music Station Blending

**Concept:** Extend personal music stations beyond individual user preference by dynamically blending stations based on real-time mood detection of *multiple* users within a shared digital space (e.g., a group chat, a co-watching experience).

**Specs:**

**1. Mood Data Acquisition:**

*   **Input Sources:**
    *   **Text Analysis:** Analyze text input (chat messages, comments) for sentiment and emotional keywords. Employ NLP models trained on emotional lexicons. (Score: -1.0 to 1.0, representing negativity to positivity).
    *   **Emotive Icon/Reaction Analysis:**  Interpret the meaning of emojis, reactions (likes, hearts, etc.) within the shared digital space.  Assign numerical values to represent emotional weight.
    *   **Audio Analysis (Optional):** If audio input is available (e.g., voice chat), utilize voice emotion recognition models to detect emotions from speech.
    *   **Video Analysis (Optional):** If video input is available, utilize facial expression recognition models to detect emotions from video.
*   **Aggregation:**  Combine data from multiple sources to create a composite mood score for the group/shared space.  Weighted averages can be used, allowing prioritization of certain input types.

**2.  Dynamic Station Blending Algorithm:**

*   **Station Representation:**  Each personal music station is represented as a vector of genre/mood tags with corresponding weights (e.g., [Pop: 0.6, Electronic: 0.3, Acoustic: 0.1]).
*   **Mood Mapping:**  Map the aggregated mood score to a set of target mood/genre profiles. (Example:  High positive mood -> Upbeat Pop/Electronic; Low mood -> Acoustic/Ambient).
*   **Blending Weights:**  Calculate blending weights for each participating user's station based on:
    *   **Mood Similarity:** How closely the user's station's mood profile aligns with the current aggregated mood.
    *   **User Preference:** A user-defined weight allowing them to control how much their station influences the blend.
    *   **Proximity:** Users closer in the digital space (e.g. actively chatting) could have more weight.
*   **Blend Creation:** Generate a new, temporary music stream by blending the selected stations based on the calculated weights.  Crossfading techniques should be employed for seamless transitions.

**3.  Interface & Controls:**

*   **Mood Visualization:** Display a visual representation of the current aggregated mood (e.g., a color gradient, an emotional "avatar").
*   **User Controls:** Allow users to:
    *   Adjust their individual station influence weight.
    *   Opt-out of mood-based blending.
    *   Manually override the blended stream with their preferred station.
*   **Real-Time Updates:** Update the blended stream and mood visualization in real-time as user interactions and mood shift.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function createBlendedStream(groupMembers, currentMood):
  blendedStream = []
  totalWeight = 0

  for member in groupMembers:
    memberStation = member.getPersonalMusicStation()
    memberPreferenceWeight = member.getPreferenceWeight()
    moodSimilarity = calculateMoodSimilarity(memberStation, currentMood)
    effectiveWeight = memberPreferenceWeight * moodSimilarity

    totalWeight += effectiveWeight

    for track in memberStation.getTracks():
      trackWeight = effectiveWeight / totalWeight
      blendedStream.append((track, trackWeight))

  // Sort blendedStream by trackWeight (descending)
  // Create playlist from top N tracks, crossfading for smooth transitions
  return blendedStream
```
