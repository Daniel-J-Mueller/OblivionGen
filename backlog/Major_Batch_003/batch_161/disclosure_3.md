## Adaptive Iconography & Contextual UI Layering

**Concept:** A display screen UI system that dynamically alters icon appearance *and* UI element layering based on inferred user emotional state, environmental factors, and task complexity. Beyond simple color changes, the iconography itself *morphs* – becoming more abstract during high-stress or high-complexity scenarios, and more concrete/detailed when the user is calm and performing simple tasks. Layering introduces “ghost” elements hinting at secondary functions, only becoming fully visible upon focused interaction.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Integration:**
    *   Camera: Facial expression analysis (happiness, sadness, anger, frustration, concentration)
    *   Microphone: Speech analysis (tone, volume, keywords indicating stress/confusion)
    *   Ambient Light Sensor: Measures environmental brightness and color temperature
    *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope: Detects device movement and user activity (walking, stationary, etc.)
    *   (Optional) Bio-sensor: Heart rate variability (HRV) via wearable integration.

2.  **Emotional State Inference Engine:**
    *   Multi-modal data fusion (camera, microphone, sensors).
    *   Machine learning model trained on emotional recognition.
    *   Output: Emotional state classification (e.g., Calm, Focused, Frustrated, Anxious) with confidence level.

3.  **Iconography Morphing Module:**
    *   Vector-based icon library.
    *   Parameterized icon design (control points, curves, detail level).
    *   Algorithm:
        *   `icon_detail = base_detail * (1 - emotional_stress_level)`
        *   `icon_abstraction = base_abstraction + emotional_stress_level`
        *   Adjust control points of vector graphics based on `icon_detail` and `icon_abstraction`.
        *   Example: A "settings" gear icon shifts from a detailed, spoked gear to a simplified, circular shape under stress. A mail icon goes from a realistic envelope to a simple, colored rectangle.
        *   “Complexity scaling” alongside stress, where more complex tasks see icon simplification *even if* the user isn't stressed.

4.  **UI Layering System:**
    *   Z-ordering of UI elements.
    *   Transparency/opacity control.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   `ghost_elements = [element_id1, element_id2...]` (Predefined set of secondary function access points.)
        *   `ghost_visibility = base_opacity * (1 - task_complexity)`
        *   Secondary functions are initially displayed as semi-transparent “ghost” elements.
        *   Upon user focus (gaze tracking, touch proximity), ghost elements become fully visible.
        *   Example: A music player might initially show only play/pause.  “Shuffle”, “EQ”, “Volume control” appear as ghost buttons that materialize when the user looks at or touches near the player.

5.  **Environmental Adaptation:**
    *   Brightness/contrast adjustment based on ambient light levels.
    *   Color palette shifting based on environmental color temperature (warm/cool).
    *   Algorithm:
        *   `color_temperature = ambient_light_sensor_value`
        *   Adjust UI color palette to complement or contrast the environment.
        *   Example: In a brightly lit room, use darker, saturated colors. In a dimly lit room, use lighter, desaturated colors.

6.  **Task Complexity Assessment:**
    *   Based on current app/screen and user interaction patterns.
    *   Algorithm:
        *   `complexity_score = number_of_visible_ui_elements + interaction_frequency`
        *   Higher complexity score reduces icon detail and increases ghost element visibility.

**Pseudocode (Icon Morphing):**

```
function morphIcon(iconData, emotionalStressLevel, taskComplexity):
  detailLevel = baseDetail * (1 - emotionalStressLevel) * (1 - taskComplexity)
  abstractionLevel = baseAbstraction + emotionalStressLevel + taskComplexity
  modifiedIconData = adjustIconVectors(iconData, detailLevel, abstractionLevel)
  return modifiedIconData
```

**Deliverables:**

*   Icon library with parameterized designs.
*   Emotional state inference engine (ML model).
*   UI layering system (software module).
*   API for app integration.
*   Calibration procedure for sensor data.
