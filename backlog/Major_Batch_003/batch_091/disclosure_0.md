## Dynamic Contextual Persona Generation

**Concept:** Expand the user memory graph to *actively generate* contextual personas during a dialog session, shifting the recommendation engine’s focus from static user profiles to fluid, moment-specific representations. This moves beyond simply *reacting* to user history and anticipates evolving needs.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Persona Module:** Introduce a "Persona Module" operating alongside the existing recommendation module. This module ingests:
    *   Current User Request
    *   First Response (from the patent)
    *   Relevant Nodes from the User Memory Graph (episodic & general)
    *   Sentiment Analysis of current request & recent exchanges.
2.  **Dynamic Persona Vector:** The Persona Module constructs a “Dynamic Persona Vector”. This isn’t a simple aggregation of existing data; it’s a weighted combination representing the user’s *current* mindset and immediate goals.  Weights are determined by:
    *   **Recency:** Recent interactions have higher weight.
    *   **Sentiment:** Positive/Negative sentiment boosts/suppresses related persona traits.
    *   **Contextual Relevance:**  Entities in the current request/response increase relevance of associated traits.
3.  **Trait Library:** A “Trait Library” defines user characteristics. Traits aren't simply "likes" or "dislikes," but behavioral patterns, motivations, and cognitive styles. (e.g., “Risk-Averse”, “Detail-Oriented”, “Value-Conscious”, “Experience-Seeking”).
4.  **Persona Synthesis:** The Persona Module combines the Dynamic Persona Vector with the Trait Library to synthesize a temporary “Contextual Persona”. This persona represents the user as they are *right now*.
5.  **Recommendation Filtering:** The Recommendation Module doesn’t operate on the static User Memory Graph. Instead, it filters recommendations *through* the Contextual Persona. Recommendations are scored based on their alignment with the current persona traits.
6. **Persona Drift Detection**: Monitor the Dynamic Persona Vector over time during a single dialog session. Significant shifts in the vector trigger a "Persona Re-Evaluation" – a recalculation of the Contextual Persona.

**Pseudocode (Persona Module):**

```
function generateContextualPersona(userRequest, firstResponse, userMemoryGraph):

  sentiment = analyzeSentiment(userRequest)
  relevantNodes = retrieveRelevantNodes(userMemoryGraph, userRequest, firstResponse)

  dynamicPersonaVector = calculateDynamicPersonaVector(relevantNodes, sentiment)

  contextualPersona = synthesizePersona(dynamicPersonaVector, traitLibrary)

  return contextualPersona
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Trait:** `[traitName: string, weight: float]`
*   **DynamicPersonaVector:**  `[traitName: string, activationLevel: float]` – A vector of trait activations.
*   **ContextualPersona:** `[traitName: string, strength: float]` – A representation of the user's current persona.



**Potential Downstream Applications:**

*   Adaptive dialog flow based on current user mood.
*   Hyper-personalized content recommendations tailored to immediate needs.
*   Proactive assistance anticipating user intentions.
*   Detection of cognitive overload or frustration.
*   More nuanced user modeling for long-term interaction.
