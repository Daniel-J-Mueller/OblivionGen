## Dynamic Content "Echoes" & Proactive Composition

**Concept:** Extend the personalized recommendation system to not just *suggest* content, but proactively *begin* composing responses or continuations, presented as editable drafts to the user. This moves beyond simple suggestion toward *assisted creation*.

**Specs:**

1.  **Echo Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Priming Content Object, Related Content Objects, User Profile, Trigger Action.
    *   Process: Employ the existing machine-learning model (potentially a fine-tuned version) to generate a *draft continuation* of the priming content. This is not a full composition, but a starting point – perhaps the first sentence of a comment, the subject line of a reply message, or the initial tags for a post.  The draft should leverage entity information from the priming content to maintain context.
    *   Output:  “Echo Draft” – A short, editable text fragment or structured data (tags, category selections).

2.  **Composition Interface Integration:**
    *   Content Suggestion Presentation: Instead of solely presenting recommended content *objects*, display both:
        *   Full Content Objects (as currently implemented)
        *   Echo Drafts (presented in an editable text field *directly within* the composer interface).
    *   Draft Highlighting: Visually differentiate Echo Drafts from user-typed content (e.g., a subtle background color, dashed underline).
    *   Accept/Reject Mechanism: Users can:
        *   Accept the Echo Draft (fully incorporating it into their composition).
        *   Reject the Echo Draft (dismissing it).
        *   Edit the Echo Draft before accepting.

3.  **Contextual Refinement Loop:**
    *   User Edits as Feedback: Capture all user edits to Echo Drafts.
    *   Feedback Incorporation: Re-train the machine-learning model using the edited drafts as positive examples, and rejected drafts as negative examples.  This creates a continuous improvement loop.
    *   Personalized Style Adaptation:  Analyze user editing patterns to adapt the generated Echo Drafts to the user’s individual writing style.

4.  **Proactive Echo Generation:**
    *   Predictive Triggering:  Beyond reacting to explicit trigger actions, use user behavior patterns (e.g., reading time, scrolling speed, cursor position) to *predict* when the user is likely to begin composing a response.  Generate an Echo Draft *before* the user initiates the composition process.
    *   "Ghostwriting" Mode (Optional):  If the user hesitates to begin composing, automatically populate the composer interface with a low-confidence Echo Draft. The user can then edit or discard it.

**Pseudocode (Echo Generation Module):**

```
function generateEchoDraft(primingContent, relatedContent, userProfile, triggerAction):
  // 1. Feature Vector Creation
  featureVector = createFeatureVector(primingContent, relatedContent, userProfile)

  // 2. Model Prediction
  predictedSequence = machineLearningModel.predictNextSequence(featureVector)

  // 3. Contextual Filtering
  filteredSequence = filterSequenceForRelevanceAndCoherence(predictedSequence, primingContent)

  // 4. Draft Construction
  echoDraft = constructEchoDraft(filteredSequence)

  return echoDraft
```
