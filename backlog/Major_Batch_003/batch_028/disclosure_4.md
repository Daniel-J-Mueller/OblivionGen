## Adaptive Multi-Modal Segment Labeling & Dynamic Embedding Space Merging

**Concept:** Extend the audio-based labeling system to incorporate visual data *and* dynamically merge/create embedding spaces based on video content, enabling finer-grained, context-aware labeling and improved accuracy, especially for ambiguous content.

**Specifications:**

**I. System Architecture:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Input Module:** Receives video file. Splits into audio & video streams.
2.  **Audio Feature Extraction:** (Existing from patent). Generates vector representing audio.
3.  **Visual Feature Extraction:** Employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) pre-trained on a large video dataset (e.g., Kinetics) to extract feature vectors from keyframes (sampled at configurable intervals). These keyframes are identified using scene detection algorithms.
4.  **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Concatenates the audio vector and the visual feature vector into a single, combined feature vector. Alternatively, employs an attention mechanism to weigh the contribution of each modality based on content.
5.  **Dynamic Embedding Space Manager:**
    *   **Embedding Space Library:** Contains pre-trained embedding spaces for various labels (language, genre, maturity, topic, objectionable content, *plus* new, dynamically created spaces).
    *   **Content Analysis Module:** Analyzes the combined feature vector to determine the *primary* content themes.
    *   **Space Selection/Creation:**
        *   If a matching embedding space exists, it's selected.
        *   If no suitable space exists, a new space is *created* by:
            *   Identifying similar videos in a database.
            *   Extracting feature vectors from those videos.
            *   Training a new embedding space using a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., UMAP, t-SNE).
6.  **Label Determination:** Projects the combined feature vector into the selected/created embedding space. Determines the nearest region and associated label.
7.  **Temporal Segmentation & Refinement:**
    *   Video divided into segments (scene changes, timestamps, speaker changes).
    *   Label determination performed on each segment.
    *   **Temporal Smoothing:** A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is used to smooth label transitions between segments. This helps to correct labeling errors and improve consistency. The HMM is trained on a large dataset of labeled videos.

**II. Data Structures:**

1.  **Video Segment:**
    *   `startTime`: Float (seconds)
    *   `endTime`: Float (seconds)
    *   `audioVector`: Float[]
    *   `visualVector`: Float[]
    *   `combinedVector`: Float[]
    *   `predictedLabel`: String
    *   `confidenceScore`: Float (0-1)
2.  **Embedding Space:**
    *   `name`: String (e.g., "Action Movie", "French Language")
    *   `dimension`: Integer
    *   `model`: Trained machine learning model (e.g., neural network, dimensionality reduction model)

**III. Pseudocode (Dynamic Embedding Space Creation):**

```pseudocode
function create_new_embedding_space(video_features, existing_spaces):
  similar_videos = find_similar_videos(video_features, video_database) //Uses cosine similarity or other metric
  training_features = []
  training_labels = []
  for video in similar_videos:
    features = extract_features(video)
    label = get_video_label(video)
    training_features.append(features)
    training_labels.append(label)

  model = train_embedding_model(training_features, training_labels) //UMAP, t-SNE, autoencoder
  new_space = EmbeddingSpace(name="Dynamic_" + label, dimension=dimension, model=model)
  return new_space
```

**IV. Key Innovations:**

*   **Multi-Modal Fusion:** Combines audio and visual information for more robust labeling.
*   **Dynamic Embedding Space Creation:** Adapts to novel content by creating new embedding spaces on demand.
*   **Temporal Smoothing:** Improves labeling accuracy by considering temporal context.
*   **Scalability:** System designed to handle large video datasets using distributed processing.
