## Adaptive Prediction Granularity for Transform Coefficient Coding

**Concept:** Enhance rate estimation by dynamically adjusting the granularity of prediction within transform coefficient blocks. Instead of uniformly partitioning and estimating rates, this system introduces a predictive model that analyzes coefficient distributions *within* partitions to refine rate control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Coefficient Distribution Analyzer:**

*   **Input:** Quantized transform coefficient matrix, current partition.
*   **Process:**
    *   Calculate the energy (sum of absolute values) of coefficients within the current partition.
    *   Determine the variance of coefficient magnitudes within the partition.
    *   Calculate a "complexity score" based on energy and variance.  Higher scores indicate more complex (less predictable) coefficient distributions.
    *   Output: Complexity Score (floating point).

**2. Granularity Controller:**

*   **Input:** Complexity Score, pre-defined granularity levels (e.g., 1x1, 2x2, 4x4 sub-partitions within the current partition).
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on the Complexity Score, select a granularity level.
    *   **Granularity Level Selection Logic:**
        *   Complexity Score < Threshold 1: Granularity Level = 4x4 (coarse)
        *   Threshold 1 <= Complexity Score < Threshold 2: Granularity Level = 2x2 (medium)
        *   Complexity Score >= Threshold 2: Granularity Level = 1x1 (fine)
    *   Output: Selected Granularity Level.

**3. Adaptive Rate Estimator:**

*   **Input:**  Quantized transform coefficient matrix, current partition, Selected Granularity Level.
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide the current partition into sub-partitions based on the Selected Granularity Level.
    *   For each sub-partition:
        *   Apply the existing rate estimation algorithm (from the provided patent) to estimate the rate for that sub-partition.
    *   Sum the rates of all sub-partitions to obtain the estimated rate for the current partition.
*   Output: Estimated Rate (floating point).

**4. End-of-Block Refinement:**

*   **Input:** True End-of-Block (from the existing system), rates from different sub-partitions
*   **Process:**
    *   The system will utilize rates from sub-partitions and re-evaluate the True End-of-Block. It will attempt to move the True End-of-Block towards the sub-partitions that contribute the most rate.
    *   This allows for a finer granularity in determining the True End-of-Block, improving compression.
*   Output: Refined True End-of-Block.

**5. System Integration:**

*   The Coefficient Distribution Analyzer, Granularity Controller, Adaptive Rate Estimator, and End-of-Block Refinement modules will be integrated into the existing hardware video processor.
*   The hardware will be modified to support the partitioning of blocks at different granularity levels.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Rate Estimator):**

```
function estimateRate(matrix, partition, granularityLevel):
  subPartitionRates = []
  if granularityLevel == "4x4":
    for i in range(0, partition.height, 4):
      for j in range(0, partition.width, 4):
        subPartition = extractSubPartition(partition, i, j, 4, 4)
        rate = existingRateEstimationAlgorithm(subPartition) // From original patent
        subPartitionRates.append(rate)
  else if granularityLevel == "2x2":
    for i in range(0, partition.height, 2):
      for j in range(0, partition.width, 2):
        subPartition = extractSubPartition(partition, i, j, 2, 2)
        rate = existingRateEstimationAlgorithm(subPartition) // From original patent
        subPartitionRates.append(rate)
  else: # granularityLevel == "1x1"
    rate = existingRateEstimationAlgorithm(partition)
    subPartitionRates.append(rate)
  totalRate = sum(subPartitionRates)
  return totalRate
```

**Novelty:** The key innovation lies in *dynamically* adjusting the granularity of rate estimation based on the complexity of the coefficient distribution *within* each partition. This is a departure from uniform partitioning and estimation, enabling more precise rate control and potentially leading to improved compression efficiency.
