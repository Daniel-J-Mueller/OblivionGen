## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Tiered Intervention

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the core notification concept by introducing a dynamic trust score for each teen account, influencing the level of parental intervention triggered by potentially problematic interactions. Instead of a simple notification, the system intelligently escalates responses based on the teen's history and the severity of the interaction.

**Components:**

*   **Trust Score Engine:** Continuously calculates a "Trust Score" for each teen account. This score is influenced by:
    *   **Interaction History:** Frequency of reporting/blocking/hiding content/accounts. A higher frequency initially *lowers* the score, indicating a need for closer monitoring. Conversely, consistently safe interactions *increase* the score.
    *   **Content/Account Sensitivity:**  The type of content/account involved in the interaction. Reporting/blocking known harmful content/accounts boosts the score. Interacting with neutral content has a minimal impact.
    *   **Reporting Accuracy:** If a reported item is verified as genuinely problematic by moderators, the score increases. False reports decrease the score.
    *   **Time Decay:**  The score decays over time, meaning past behavior has less influence as the teen demonstrates consistent responsible behavior.

*   **Interaction Severity Classifier:**  Categorizes interactions based on pre-defined severity levels (Low, Medium, High). This utilizes machine learning models trained on data identifying harmful content and interactions.

*   **Tiered Intervention System:** Based on the Trust Score and Interaction Severity, the system triggers one of several intervention levels:

    *   **Tier 1 (Low Severity, High Trust):** No notification. System logs the interaction for analytical purposes.
    *   **Tier 2 (Low/Medium Severity, Medium Trust):**  Gentle prompt to the teen: "We noticed you blocked/reported this content. Are you okay?  Here are some resources if you need help." No parental notification.
    *   **Tier 3 (Medium Severity, Low/Medium Trust):** Notification to parent: "Your teen blocked/reported content. No immediate cause for concern, but we wanted to inform you." Includes a link to view details.
    *   **Tier 4 (High Severity, Low Trust):**  Immediate notification to parent with detailed information about the interaction.  Option for parent to initiate a "safety check-in" with the teen.
    *   **Tier 5 (Critical Severity, Very Low Trust):** Automatic safety check-in initiated. System may also flag the account for review by human moderators and potentially contact emergency services if the interaction indicates imminent harm.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Interaction occurs
interactionData = collectInteractionData()
severity = classifyInteractionSeverity(interactionData)
teenAccount = getTeenAccount(interactionData)
trustScore = getTeenTrustScore(teenAccount)

interventionTier = determineInterventionTier(severity, trustScore)

switch (interventionTier) {
    case 1:
        logInteraction(interactionData);
        break;
    case 2:
        displayTeenPrompt(interactionData);
        break;
    case 3:
        sendParentNotification(interactionData, "Informational");
        break;
    case 4:
        sendParentNotification(interactionData, "Urgent");
        break;
    case 5:
        initiateSafetyCheckin(teenAccount);
        flagForModeration(teenAccount);
        break;
}
```

**Data Storage:**

*   Teen Account Profiles: User ID, Trust Score, Interaction History.
*   Interaction Logs: Timestamp, User ID, Content/Account Involved, Severity Level.
*   Severity Classification Model: Trained machine learning model.

**Further Enhancements:**

*   **Personalized Safety Resources:** Provide resources tailored to the specific type of harmful content encountered.
*   **Parent Customization:** Allow parents to customize intervention levels based on their comfort level and their teenâ€™s maturity.
*   **AI-Powered Safety Check-ins:** Use AI to analyze the conversation during a safety check-in and provide real-time support.
