## Dynamic Scene Reconstruction & Interactive Product Placement

**Core Concept:** Extend image-based product advertising by reconstructing a simplified 3D scene from the 2D image, allowing users to virtually “place” and interact with advertised products *within* the original image context.

**Specifications:**

**1. Scene Depth Estimation Module:**
    *   **Input:** 2D Image (from social feed, as in the patent).
    *   **Process:** Utilize a monocular depth estimation algorithm (e.g., MiDaS, DPT) to create a depth map of the image.  Focus on identifying planar surfaces and dominant object boundaries.  Prioritize accuracy in areas likely to contain products.
    *   **Output:** Depth Map (grayscale image representing distance from the camera) and Semantic Segmentation Map (identifying objects like walls, floors, tables, etc.).

**2. Simplified 3D Reconstruction Module:**
    *   **Input:** Depth Map & Semantic Segmentation Map.
    *   **Process:**  Convert the depth map into a point cloud.  Use the semantic segmentation to categorize points and create simplified 3D meshes representing surfaces.  Avoid complex geometry; focus on creating a basic, navigable environment.  Implement a raycasting system for collision detection.
    *   **Output:** Simplified 3D Scene Representation (mesh data, collision map).

**3. Product Integration Module:**
    *   **Input:**  Product Model (3D model of the advertised item, obtained from a database), Original Image, 3D Scene Representation.
    *   **Process:**  Allow the user to select a surface within the 3D scene (via touch or mouse).  Scale and rotate the product model.  Raycast to confirm placement is valid (no collisions with existing geometry).  Render the product model into the scene. Apply lighting and shadows consistent with the original image.
    *   **Output:** Augmented Scene (2D image with the product virtually placed within the 3D environment).

**4. Interactive Features:**
    *   **Rotation/Scaling:**  Allow the user to rotate and scale the placed product in real-time.
    *   **"Walkthrough" Mode:**  Enable a limited "walkthrough" of the reconstructed scene (first-person perspective) to view the product from different angles.  Movement should be constrained to the reconstructed geometry.
    *   **Product Information Overlay:** Display product details (name, price, description) when the user interacts with the placed product.
    *   **"Purchase in Scene" Button:** Provide a direct link to purchase the product.
    *    **"Save Scene" Functionality**: Allow users to save the scene with the placed item.

**5.  User Interface:**
    *   Minimalist UI.
    *   Intuitive touch/mouse controls.
    *   Real-time rendering of the augmented scene.
    *   Options for adjusting lighting and scene parameters.



**Pseudocode (Product Placement):**

```
function placeProduct(productModel, surfacePoint, rotationAngle):
  // Raycast from surfacePoint to check for collisions
  collision = raycast(surfacePoint, downwards)

  if collision:
    // Placement is valid
    rotatedModel = rotate(productModel, rotationAngle)
    scaledModel = scale(rotatedModel, desiredSize)
    placeModel(scaledModel, surfacePoint)
    return True
  else:
    // Placement is invalid
    return False
```
