## Dynamic Contextual GUI Elements

**Concept:** Introduce GUI elements that dynamically reshape and reposition themselves based on real-time data input and user interaction, going beyond simple animations or scaling. The goal is a truly fluid and adaptive interface.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** "MorphUI" - A system for defining GUI element behaviors beyond standard properties (size, color, position). This is done through "Behavior Scripts"
*   **Behavior Scripts:** Scripts (Python preferred, but adaptable) define rules for element transformation. These rules are triggered by:
    *   **Data Streams:** Connected to external data sources (sensors, APIs, internal program states). Example: A chart element's shape morphs based on incoming stock prices, becoming ‘spiky’ during volatility.
    *   **User Gestures:**  Recognized gestures (swipe, pinch, rotate) directly manipulate element geometry. A pinch gesture could ‘compress’ a text block into a summary.
    *   **Contextual Awareness:** Utilizing environmental data (time of day, user location, ambient light) to alter appearance and behavior. A dark mode isn’t sufficient – the entire interface *reconfigures* for low-light situations.
*   **Geometry Engine:** A vector graphics/mesh-based rendering engine capable of smoothly transitioning between complex shapes defined in Behavior Scripts.  Requires a robust collision detection system to avoid overlaps during morphing. Uses shaders to handle advanced visual effects.
*   **Element Types:**
    *   **Fluid Buttons:** Buttons that swell, contract, or change shape on interaction.
    *   **Adaptive Charts:** Charts whose visual representation dynamically changes based on data trends (e.g., a bar chart transforming into a line graph when the data becomes more time-series oriented).
    *   **Contextual Text Blocks:** Text blocks that re-flow and re-shape to fit available space and emphasize key information.
    *   **Morphing Icons:** Icons that subtly animate and transform to indicate status or progress.
*   **API:**
    *   `MorphUI.register_behavior(element_id, behavior_script)`:  Associates a Behavior Script with a GUI element.
    *   `MorphUI.bind_data_stream(element_id, data_stream)`: Connects a data stream to an element.
    *   `MorphUI.trigger_gesture(element_id, gesture_type)`:  Simulates a gesture for testing.
*   **Pseudocode (Behavior Script Example - Adaptive Chart):**

```python
def chart_morph(data):
    if len(data) < 5:
        return "bar_chart"  # Default to bar chart for small datasets
    
    trend = calculate_trend(data)
    
    if abs(trend) > 0.75: # Steep Trend
        return "line_chart"
    elif len(set(data)) < 3: # Limited Data Range
        return "pie_chart"
    else:
        return "scatter_plot"
```

*   **Rendering Pipeline:**
    1.  Receive data/gesture input.
    2.  Trigger Behavior Scripts associated with affected elements.
    3.  Behavior Scripts generate new geometry/rendering parameters.
    4.  Geometry Engine renders updated elements.
    5.  Repeat.
*   **Data Formats:** JSON, XML, CSV, API endpoints (REST, GraphQL).
*   **Target Platforms:** Desktop, mobile, VR/AR.
