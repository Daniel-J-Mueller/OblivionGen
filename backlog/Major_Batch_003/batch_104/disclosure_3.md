## Dynamic Persona Stitching for Multi-Modal Response

**Concept:** Expand the “multi-perspective response” beyond simply combining execution results. Introduce *dynamic persona stitching*, where the stitching model doesn’t just combine *what* is said, but *how* it’s said, by adopting and blending distinct communication personas derived from the agents involved. This extends to multi-modal output, altering voice tone, visual style, and even emoji usage.

**Specification:**

**I. Persona Profiles:**

*   Each agent maintains a “Persona Profile” – a vector embedding representing its communication style. Dimensions include:
    *   **Formality:** (0-1.0, 0=informal, 1=formal)
    *   **Emotionality:** (-1.0 to 1.0, -1=stoic, 1=expressive)
    *   **Technicality:** (0-1.0, 0=layman’s terms, 1=expert jargon)
    *   **Conciseness:** (0-1.0, 0=verbose, 1=succinct)
    *   **Multi-Modal Style:** (Encoding for preferred voice tone, visual aesthetic, emoji frequency/type, animation style). This is a learned embedding from interaction data.
*   Persona Profiles are dynamically updated based on user interactions and agent performance.

**II. Stitching Model Enhancement:**

*   **Persona Blending:**  Given a user query and execution results from multiple agents, the stitching model calculates a *target persona* for the combined response.  This is done via:
    *   **User Preference:**  Prioritize the communication style preferred by the user (derived from user profile and interaction history).
    *   **Agent Contribution Weighting:** Weight the Persona Profiles of contributing agents based on the relevance/importance of their execution result (determined by a separate relevance scoring module).
    *   **Conflict Resolution:** Algorithm to smoothly blend conflicting dimensions (e.g., high formality from one agent, low formality from another).  Utilizes a weighted average and clamping to maintain a coherent persona.
*   **Response Generation:**  The stitching model leverages a large language model (LLM) fine-tuned to generate text *conditioned on* the target persona. The LLM receives the combined information *and* the target persona vector as input.
*   **Multi-Modal Transformation:** A separate “Multi-Modal Engine” transforms the generated text into a multi-modal output. This engine:
    *   Uses the Persona Profile's “Multi-Modal Style” encoding to:
        *   Select an appropriate text-to-speech voice.
        *   Generate a visually appropriate background/avatar.
        *   Insert relevant emojis/animations.
        *   Dynamically adjust font size/color.

**III. Pseudocode (Stitching Model):**

```
function stitch_response(user_query, agent_results):
  // 1. Determine Target Persona
  user_preference = get_user_communication_preference(user_query.user_id)
  weighted_agent_personas = []
  for result in agent_results:
    weight = result.relevance_score  //Determined by separate relevance module
    weighted_agent_personas.append((result.agent.persona_profile, weight))

  target_persona = blend_personas(user_preference, weighted_agent_personas) //Weighted average, conflict resolution

  // 2. Generate Text with Persona Conditioning
  text = generate_text(user_query, agent_results, target_persona)  //LLM conditioned on target_persona

  // 3. Transform to Multi-Modal Output
  multi_modal_output = transform_to_multi_modal(text, target_persona)

  return multi_modal_output
```

**IV.  Novelty:**

Existing multi-perspective responses focus on information aggregation. This introduces *communication style* as a first-class citizen, resulting in a more nuanced and engaging user experience.  The dynamic persona blending allows for truly personalized responses, tailoring not just *what* is said, but *how* it’s said to the user’s preference and the context of the interaction. This shifts from information delivery to *relationship building*.
