## Dynamic Predictive Capture Presets

**Concept:** Expand the dynamic format identification to *predict* optimal capture settings (beyond just format) based on contextual awareness, proactively adjusting settings *before* the user initiates capture.

**Specifications:**

**1. Contextual Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Integrate with device sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, ambient light sensor, microphone).
*   **Environmental Analysis:** Utilize sensor data to determine:
    *   Device motion (static, panning, zooming, high-speed movement).
    *   Lighting conditions (low light, bright sunlight, indoor, outdoor).
    *   Audio environment (quiet, noisy, speech detection).
    *   Geographic location (indoor/outdoor, potential landmark recognition).
*   **User Behavior Tracking (Optional, with explicit consent):** Monitor user interactions:
    *   App usage patterns.
    *   Frequency of capture.
    *   Commonly used capture modes.
*   **External Data Sources (Optional, with explicit consent and network connectivity):** Access real-time data:
    *   Weather information.
    *   Traffic conditions.
    *   Event schedules (linked to location).

**2. Predictive Analysis Engine:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a decision tree) to predict optimal capture settings based on contextual data.
    *   **Training Data:** Utilize a large dataset of capture scenarios with corresponding optimal settings (manually curated or derived from expert knowledge).
    *   **Model Parameters:** Adjust parameters to prioritize specific settings (e.g., prioritize low-light performance over resolution).
*   **Setting Categories:** Control the following settings:
    *   **Capture Format:** (Resolution, frame rate, codec - building on existing patent)
    *   **Exposure:** (ISO, aperture, shutter speed)
    *   **Focus:** (Auto-focus mode, focus tracking)
    *   **Stabilization:** (Optical/electronic image stabilization)
    *   **White Balance:** (Automatic/preset)
    *   **HDR Mode:** (Enable/disable)
    *   **Scene Detection:** (Automatically select appropriate scene mode)

**3. Dynamic Preset System:**

*   **Preset Creation:** Generate a set of dynamically adjusted capture presets based on the Predictive Analysis Engine's output.
*   **Preset Prioritization:** Rank presets based on confidence level and relevance to the current context.
*   **Preset Suggestion:** Proactively suggest the top-ranked preset to the user via a dedicated UI element.
*   **Automatic Application:** Optionally allow the system to automatically apply the suggested preset after a short delay (with user confirmation).

**4. User Customization & Feedback Loop:**

*   **Manual Override:** Allow users to manually override the suggested preset and adjust settings as desired.
*   **Feedback Mechanism:** Record user overrides and use this data to retrain the machine learning model, improving prediction accuracy over time.
*   **Profile Management:** Allow users to create and manage custom profiles for different capture scenarios (e.g., “Low-Light Photography,” “Fast-Action Sports”).



**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function predictCaptureSettings(contextData):
  context = analyzeContextData(contextData)
  predictedSettings = machineLearningModel.predict(context)
  suggestedPreset = createCapturePreset(predictedSettings)
  return suggestedPreset

function analyzeContextData(data):
  // Extract relevant features from sensor data, user behavior, etc.
  features = extractFeatures(data)
  return features

function extractFeatures(data):
  // Example features:
  // - deviceMotion: "static", "panning", "highSpeed"
  // - lightingCondition: "lowLight", "brightSunlight"
  // - location: "indoor", "outdoor"
  // - userHistory: "frequentUseOfHDR", "preferenceForHighResolution"
  // ...
  return features

function createCapturePreset(settings):
  // Combine predicted settings into a coherent capture preset.
  preset = {}
  preset["resolution"] = settings["resolution"]
  preset["frameRate"] = settings["frameRate"]
  preset["iso"] = settings["iso"]
  // ...
  return preset
```
