## Dynamic Event Footprint Projection & Micro-Local Advertising

**Concept:** Expand the predictive capabilities beyond simply estimating *total* user volume at a location. Instead, project the *spatial distribution* of users attending multiple events, creating a heat map of expected activity. Couple this with real-time micro-local advertising opportunities, shifting ad spend based on predicted user density *within* the threshold distance, not just *to* the location.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Event Clustering:**

*   **Input:** Event data (location, time, attendee list/indications), real-time user location data (opt-in, anonymized), historical location traffic data.
*   **Processing:** Cluster events occurring within a defined timeframe (e.g., 1-2 hours) and a relatively small radius (e.g., 200-500 meters). Assign each event a "footprint" – a spatial probability distribution representing likely attendee locations *around* the event. This footprint isn't just a circle; it's influenced by event type (concert = wider spread, workshop = concentrated), time of day, and historical movement patterns. Use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to model the footprint, allowing for non-uniform density.
*   **Output:** A dynamically updated set of event footprints represented as rasterized heatmaps.

**2. Footprint Aggregation & Prediction:**

*   **Input:** Multiple event footprints for a given time window and location.
*   **Processing:** Aggregate overlapping footprints. This isn’t simple addition; prioritize footprints based on event size (attendee count), event type (impact on local traffic), and confidence in attendee predictions (based on historical data and confirmed RSVPs). Implement a weighted overlay algorithm.  Output a single “aggregate footprint” – a high-resolution heatmap representing the predicted density of users across the area.
*   **Output:** A time-series of aggregate footprint heatmaps.

**3. Micro-Local Ad Bidding & Delivery:**

*   **Input:** Aggregate footprint heatmaps, available ad inventory (micro-local ad slots – think digital billboards, mobile ads targeted to specific geofences), ad campaign parameters (budget, target audience, ad creative).
*   **Processing:** Divide the area covered by the aggregate footprint into a grid of small geofences (e.g., 10m x 10m).  For each geofence, determine the predicted user density based on the heatmap.  Run an auction (Real-Time Bidding – RTB) for ad impressions within each geofence.  Bidding price is proportional to predicted user density, campaign budget, and target audience overlap.  Ads are served to users within the winning geofences.
*   **Output:** Real-time ad serving optimized for predicted user density.

**Pseudocode (Ad Bidding):**

```
For each geofence in area:
    user_density = heatmap.get_density(geofence)
    bid_price = base_price * user_density * target_audience_overlap
    submit_bid(bid_price, ad_creative)
If bid wins:
    display_ad_to_users_in_geofence
```

**4. Dynamic Budget Allocation:**

*   **Monitoring:** Track ad performance (impressions, clicks, conversions) within each geofence.
*   **Adjustment:** Dynamically reallocate ad budget from underperforming geofences to high-performing ones.  Use a Reinforcement Learning algorithm to optimize budget allocation over time.



**Novelty:** This shifts from predicting overall traffic to predicting *where* users will be, enabling hyper-targeted advertising and optimized resource allocation (e.g., staffing, security) at the micro-local level.  The dynamic budget allocation using Reinforcement Learning provides a significant advantage over static or rule-based ad spend strategies.
