## Dynamic Obfuscation Profiles & User-Specific Sensitivity

**Concept:** Extend the existing obfuscation system to allow for dynamically generated, user-specific obfuscation profiles. Instead of a blanket application of obfuscation, the system learns user sensitivities and applies obfuscation levels tailored to *their* individual preferences and history.

**Specs:**

*   **User Sensitivity Data:** Gather data points indicating a user’s sensitivity to content types. This isn't explicit tagging (e.g., "sensitive to violence"), but inferred from interaction patterns:
    *   *Dwell Time:* How long a user views different content. Shorter dwell times suggest discomfort.
    *   *Scroll Speed:* Rapid scrolling past certain content suggests avoidance.
    *   *Interaction Rate:* Liking, commenting, sharing – positive engagement indicates tolerance. Reporting or blocking indicates aversion.
    *   *Keyword Analysis:* Analyze text associated with interacted content to identify recurring themes the user avoids.
    *   *Image/Video Analysis:* Utilize computer vision to categorize content (e.g., scenes of conflict, suggestive imagery) and track user reactions.
*   **Sensitivity Profile Generation:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., a collaborative filtering algorithm or a neural network) to construct a ‘Sensitivity Profile’ for each user. This profile is a weighted representation of their sensitivities across different content categories.  The profile is *dynamic*, constantly updated with new interaction data.
*   **Dynamic Obfuscation Level:**  For each piece of content posted:
    1.  Analyze the content to determine its relevant categories (using computer vision/NLP).
    2.  Retrieve the user’s Sensitivity Profile.
    3.  Calculate an Obfuscation Level based on the content’s category and the user’s corresponding sensitivity score.  Higher sensitivity = higher obfuscation.  A scale from 0 (no obfuscation) to 100% (complete obscuring) is proposed.
    4.  Apply obfuscation techniques dynamically based on the calculated level. This could range from simple blurring or pixelation to more sophisticated techniques like content replacement or abstract rendering.
*   **Obfuscation Technique Library:** Maintain a library of different obfuscation techniques. Each technique has associated ‘cost’ metrics (processing time, visual fidelity impact) and ‘effectiveness’ scores (how well it obscures the content). The system selects the optimal technique for each situation, balancing effectiveness with performance.
*   **Transparency & Control:** Allow users to view and adjust their Sensitivity Profile. Provide granular control over content categories and obfuscation levels.  A simple ‘comfort slider’ per category could be used for ease of use.
*   **Content Creator Control:** Allow content creators to tag their content with sensitivity warnings. These warnings can be used to boost the obfuscation level for certain users, ensuring they are not exposed to potentially disturbing content.



**Pseudocode (Obfuscation Level Calculation):**

```
function calculateObfuscationLevel(contentCategory, userSensitivityProfile):
  sensitivityScore = userSensitivityProfile[contentCategory]  //Get user sensitivity for this category
  obfuscationLevel =  sensitivityScore * 100 // Scale score to 0-100%

  //Optional: Add creator-defined sensitivity boost
  if contentHasSensitivityWarning:
    obfuscationLevel += 25 //Add 25% boost

  //Cap obfuscation level at 100%
  obfuscationLevel = min(obfuscationLevel, 100)

  return obfuscationLevel
```
