## Dynamic Content Stitching with Multi-Perspective Commentary

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of elevating comments into content, but introduce a dynamic stitching system enabling multiple, concurrent ‘perspectives’ on a central content item. Instead of *one* elevated comment, allow several, presented as distinct, visually separated ‘layers’ overlaid on the original content.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Item Structure:** Original content (image, video, text) remains central. Associated with it is a dynamic “Perspective Container”.
*   **Perspective Layers:** Within the Perspective Container, multiple perspective layers are maintained. Each layer represents a distinct stream of elevated comments, curated by a different user or automated system. Think of them as annotation tracks.
*   **Layer Creation/Ownership:** Any user (with permissions) can create a new perspective layer, becoming its ‘curator’. The curator is responsible for elevating comments *into that specific layer*.
*   **Comment Elevation (Layer-Specific):** When a user elevates a comment, they *must* select a perspective layer. The comment is then added to that layer’s stream, not the global elevated comment pool.
*   **Visual Presentation:** Each perspective layer is rendered as a semi-transparent ‘overlay’ on the original content.  Users can toggle the visibility of each layer independently.
*   **Layer Styles:**  Curators can customize the visual style of their layer (font, color, background opacity, highlighting style).
*   **AI-Driven Layers:** Create automated layers.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis Layer:** AI identifies comments expressing positive/negative sentiment and visually highlights them.
    *   **Question/Answer Layer:** AI identifies questions within comments and pairs them with relevant answers from other comments, presenting them as Q&A pairs.
    *   **Summary Layer:** AI generates a concise summary of the overall comment discussion and presents it as a floating overlay.
*   **Interaction:**
    *   Users can ‘follow’ specific layers to receive notifications when new comments are elevated into them.
    *   Users can ‘rate’ layers based on their quality or usefulness.
    *   Curators can moderate comments within their layer.
*   **Data Structure:**

```
ContentItem {
    id: string;
    originalContent: string; // URL/data of original content
    perspectiveContainer: {
        layers: [Layer];
    };
}

Layer {
    id: string;
    curatorId: string;
    style: { // visual customizations
        font: string;
        color: string;
        opacity: float;
    };
    elevatedComments: [Comment]; // ordered list of elevated comments
}

Comment {
    id: string;
    text: string;
    authorId: string;
    timestamp: datetime;
    positionInContent: { x, y }; // for visual anchoring
}
```

**Workflow Example:**

1.  User posts a video.
2.  Three users create layers: "Technical Analysis", "Humor/Memes", "Fan Theories".
3.  Users comment on the video.
4.  Each user elevates relevant comments into their chosen layer.
5.  Other users can toggle each layer on/off, viewing the content with different perspectives overlaid.
