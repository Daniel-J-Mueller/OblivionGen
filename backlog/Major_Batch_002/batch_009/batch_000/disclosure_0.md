## Dynamic Action Prediction & Proactive Content Prefetching

**System Overview:**

A system designed to dynamically predict user actions *beyond* immediate clicks or page views, leveraging a multi-layered prediction model. This enables proactive content prefetching and rendering, minimizing perceived latency and improving user experience. The system differs from the provided patent by focusing on *anticipating* complex action sequences, not just improving models for existing actions.

**Components:**

1.  **Action Graph Database:** A graph database storing a hierarchical representation of user actions. Nodes represent individual actions (e.g., “view product detail,” “add to cart,” “begin checkout,” “research competitor pricing”), and edges represent probabilities of transitioning between actions based on historical data. Action probabilities are weighted by user segments (demographics, purchase history, browsing behavior).

2.  **Contextual Feature Extractor:** Extracts features from user context. These features include:
    *   Current page content (text, images, videos)
    *   Referring URL
    *   Time of day
    *   User location (approximate)
    *   Device type
    *   User’s past behavior (browsing history, purchase history, search queries)
    *   Real-time behavior (mouse movements, scroll depth, time spent on page elements)

3.  **Multi-Layered Prediction Model:** A model composed of several sub-models:
    *   **Short-Term Predictor (LSTM):** An LSTM network trained on sequences of user actions to predict the *next* most likely action.
    *   **Long-Term Predictor (Transformer):** A Transformer network trained on longer sequences of user actions to identify patterns and predict *future action sequences* (e.g., a user researching a product is likely to compare prices and read reviews before making a purchase).
    *   **Contextual Refiner (CNN):** A CNN trained on contextual features to refine the predictions from the short-term and long-term predictors. The CNN learns to adjust predictions based on the current context.
    *   **Similarity Matcher (Vector Database):** Utilizes a vector database to identify users with similar behavioral patterns. Predictions are refined based on the actions of similar users.

4.  **Prefetching Engine:** Responsible for prefetching content based on the predictions from the Multi-Layered Prediction Model.
    *   **Content Prioritization:** Prioritizes content based on the probability of being requested.
    *   **Adaptive Prefetching:** Dynamically adjusts the amount of content prefetched based on network conditions and user behavior.
    *   **Client-Side Caching:** Leverages client-side caching to store prefetched content.

5.  **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitors user behavior and updates the prediction models.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function prefetchContent(user, context) {
  predictedActions = multiLayeredPredictionModel.predict(user, context)
  prioritizedContent = prioritizeContent(predictedActions)
  
  for each contentItem in prioritizedContent {
    if (contentItem not in clientCache) {
      requestContent(contentItem)
      storeContentInClientCache(contentItem)
    }
  }
}

function prioritizeContent(predictedActions) {
  // Calculate a score for each potential content item based on:
  //   - Probability of being requested (from predictedActions)
  //   - Content size (smaller content items are prioritized)
  //   - Network latency (prioritize content that can be loaded quickly)
  
  sortedContent = sort(contentItems by score in descending order)
  return sortedContent
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system moves beyond simply predicting immediate actions (like clicks) to anticipating complex user journeys. The Multi-Layered Prediction Model and the adaptive prefetching engine work together to create a seamless user experience by proactively loading content before it is even requested. This enhances perceived performance and improves user engagement. The use of a vector database for similarity matching is also novel in this context.
