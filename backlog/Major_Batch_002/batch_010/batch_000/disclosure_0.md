## Dynamic Event Remixing & Personalized Ambient Storytelling

**System Overview:**

This system extends event suggestion beyond simple attendance to active, personalized event *remixing* – altering event details in real-time based on user preferences and social context – and layering a personalized ambient storytelling experience *around* the event. It builds on the patent’s concept of suggesting events based on affinity, but actively modifies and enhances the experience *of* the event itself.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Event Data Ingestion & Semantic Parsing:**
    *   Ingests event data (location, time, description, organizers, attendees) from various sources (social networks, ticketing platforms, live event feeds).
    *   Employs NLP and semantic parsing to extract key event features and *potential modification points*. Examples: music genre, lighting style, ambient temperature, food/beverage options, projected visuals, speaker topics.
    *   Creates a ‘modification profile’ for each event, listing adjustable parameters.

2.  **User Preference & Contextual Data Aggregation:**
    *   Aggregates user data from multiple sources: social network activity, location history, past event attendance, stated preferences, real-time sensor data (weather, noise levels, proximity to others).
    *   Builds a ‘sensory profile’ for each user – preferences for lighting, music, temperature, social interaction levels, food/beverage preferences.
    *   Creates a ‘social context profile’ – identifying nearby friends, shared interests, and current social mood.

3.  **Real-Time Event Modification Engine:**
    *   This engine is the core of the system. It dynamically modifies event parameters based on the user’s sensory profile, social context, and event modification profile.
    *   Modifications can range from subtle adjustments to dramatic transformations. Examples:
        *   **Music:** Dynamically adjust the playlist to match the user's preferred genre or energy level.
        *   **Lighting:** Adjust the lighting color and intensity to match the user's preferences or create a specific mood.
        *   **Visuals:** Project personalized visuals onto surfaces in the event space, based on the user's interests or current social context.
        *   **Temperature:** Adjust the temperature in a localized area around the user to match their preference.
        *   **Food/Beverage:** Suggest personalized food and beverage options to the user based on their preferences and dietary restrictions.
        *   **Content:** If the event includes presentations or performances, dynamically adjust the content to align with the user's interests. (e.g. a speaker's topic selection dynamically shifting based on audience composition).

4.  **Ambient Storytelling Layer:**
    *   Beyond simple modification, the system layers an ambient storytelling experience around the event.
    *   This involves generating a personalized narrative that unfolds in real-time, triggered by the user’s actions and interactions with the event.
    *   The narrative can be delivered through multiple channels:
        *   **Augmented Reality:** AR overlays on the event space, displaying personalized information or interactive elements.
        *   **Spatial Audio:** Sounds and music that change based on the user’s location and actions.
        *   **Haptic Feedback:**  Vibrations or other tactile sensations that enhance the immersive experience.
        *   **Dynamic Projection Mapping:**  Projecting stories or visual elements onto surfaces around the user.

**Pseudocode (Event Modification Engine):**

```
function modifyEvent(userProfile, eventData, currentContext) {

  // 1. Calculate Affinity Scores
  affinityScore = calculateAffinity(userProfile, eventData)

  // 2. Identify Modifiable Parameters
  modifiableParams = getModifiableParameters(eventData)

  // 3. Prioritize Modifications based on Affinity & Context
  prioritizedParams = prioritizeModifications(modifiableParams, affinityScore, currentContext)

  // 4. Apply Modifications
  for each param in prioritizedParams {
    newVal = generateOptimalValue(param, userProfile, currentContext)
    applyModification(eventData, param, newVal)
  }

  return modifiedEventData
}

function generateOptimalValue(param, userProfile, currentContext) {
  // Logic to determine the best value for the parameter
  // based on user preferences, current context, and event constraints
  // Could involve machine learning models or rule-based systems
}

function applyModification(eventData, param, newVal) {
  // Logic to actually modify the event data and/or trigger changes in the event environment
}
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Smartphones / Wearable Devices (for user data collection & AR/VR experiences).
*   IoT Sensors (temperature, humidity, lighting, proximity).
*   AR/VR Headsets (optional, for enhanced immersion).
*   Smart Lighting / Sound Systems (for dynamic control).
