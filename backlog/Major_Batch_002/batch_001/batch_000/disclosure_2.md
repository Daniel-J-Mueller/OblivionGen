## Dynamic Polymorphic Cache with Predictive Pre-Fetching

**Specification:** Implement a caching system where cache entries aren't solely typed at creation, but can dynamically shift types based on runtime usage patterns. This is coupled with a predictive pre-fetching mechanism that anticipates type shifts and pre-allocates/populates cache entries with potential future types.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Polymorphic Cache Entry:** Each cache entry maintains a primary type, but also a metadata field storing a probability distribution over potential future types. This distribution is updated continuously based on observed access patterns.
2.  **Type Shift Manager:** Monitors access patterns and updates the probability distribution within each cache entry.  If the probability of a secondary type exceeds a threshold, the entry's internal data structure is *recast* (without complete invalidation) to accommodate the new type. This utilizes a flexible data representation capable of adapting to different types (e.g., tagged unions, variant types).
3.  **Predictive Pre-Fetcher:**  Analyzes historical type shift patterns across the entire cache.  If a specific sequence of type shifts is frequently observed, it proactively allocates new cache entries or expands existing ones with potential future types *before* they are explicitly requested. This is implemented using a Markov chain model to predict type transitions.
4.  **Adaptive Data Representation:** Implement a core data structure that can efficiently represent multiple data types without excessive overhead. Consider a tagged union or a variant type with a mechanism for runtime type identification and safe casting.
5.  **Cache Coherency Protocol:** Extend existing cache coherency protocols to handle polymorphic cache entries. This ensures that all replicas of a cache entry are updated correctly when a type shift occurs.

**Pseudocode (Type Shift Manager):**

```
class CacheEntry:
    primaryType: Type
    typeProbabilities: Dictionary<Type, Float>
    data: VariantType

    def access(requestedType: Type):
        if requestedType == primaryType:
            // Normal access
        else:
            // Type mismatch - potential shift
            updateTypeProbabilities(requestedType)
            if shouldShiftType(requestedType):
                shiftType(requestedType)

    def updateTypeProbabilities(newType: Type):
        typeProbabilities[newType] += 1
        normalizeProbabilities()

    def shouldShiftType(newType: Type):
        return typeProbabilities[newType] > shiftThreshold

    def shiftType(newType: Type):
        // Recast data to accommodate newType
        // Update primaryType
        // Adjust metadata
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Shift Threshold:**  A configurable parameter determining the probability threshold for triggering a type shift.
*   **Data Recasting:**  The process of converting the data within a cache entry to a new type. This may involve allocating new memory, copying data, and performing type conversions.
*   **Metadata Management:**  Storing and updating the type probabilities for each cache entry. This metadata should be compact and efficient to minimize overhead.
*   **Markov Chain Model:**  The predictive pre-fetcher should use a Markov chain model to learn the probabilities of type transitions. The order of the Markov chain can be adjusted to balance prediction accuracy and computational cost.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:**  Consider using hardware acceleration to speed up the data recasting and type conversion processes.
