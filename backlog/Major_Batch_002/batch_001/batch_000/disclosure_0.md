## Dynamic Polymorphic Type Resolution with Probabilistic Inference

**Specification:** Implement a system for resolving untyped variables in dynamic scripting languages (like PHP) using a probabilistic inference engine.  Instead of strict type assignment during compilation, associate each untyped variable with a probability distribution over possible types.  This distribution evolves during runtime based on observed usage patterns.

**Components:**

1.  **Type Inference Engine:**  A Bayesian network or Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) engine to model the probability distribution over types for each untyped variable.  Initial distribution can be uniform or seeded based on common usage patterns.

2.  **Runtime Type Observer:**  A hook within the execution environment to monitor variable usage.  This observer records:
    *   Operations performed on the variable (e.g., addition, string concatenation, function call).
    *   Types of operands/arguments involved in these operations.

3.  **Distribution Updater:**  A module that receives observations from the Runtime Type Observer and updates the probability distribution for the corresponding variable using the Type Inference Engine.  Updates are performed after each operation or after a configurable number of operations to reduce overhead.

4.  **Dynamic Dispatch Mechanism:** A modified dispatch system that considers the probability distribution when resolving function calls or operator overloads.  The most likely type (highest probability) is used for dispatch, but the system can also handle multiple dispatch scenarios by attempting to resolve the function for several likely types and selecting the best match.

**Pseudocode (Distribution Updater):**

```
function update_distribution(variable, operation, operand_types):
  current_distribution = get_distribution(variable)

  // Calculate likelihood of each type given the observed operation and operand types
  likelihoods = {}
  for type in possible_types:
    likelihoods[type] = calculate_likelihood(type, operation, operand_types)

  // Update the probability distribution using Bayes' theorem
  new_distribution = {}
  for type in possible_types:
    prior = current_distribution.get(type, 0.0)  // Get prior probability
    evidence = calculate_evidence(type, operation, operand_types)
    posterior = (likelihoods[type] * prior) / evidence
    new_distribution[type] = posterior

  // Normalize the distribution
  total = sum(new_distribution.values())
  for type in new_distribution:
    new_distribution[type] /= total

  set_distribution(variable, new_distribution)
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Type Hierarchy:** A well-defined type hierarchy is crucial for accurate probability calculations.
*   **Evidence Calculation:**  The `calculate_evidence` function estimates the overall probability of observing the current operation given a specific type. This can be based on historical data or statistical models.
*   **Contextual Inference:** Incorporate contextual information (e.g., calling function, surrounding code) to improve inference accuracy.
*   **Performance Optimization:**  Caching, lazy evaluation, and parallel processing can mitigate performance overhead.
