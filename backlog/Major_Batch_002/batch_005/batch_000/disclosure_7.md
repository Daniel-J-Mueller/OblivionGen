## Bio-Acoustic Resonance Mapping for Personalized Spatial Audio & Haptic Feedback

**System Overview:** A system that dynamically generates a personalized ‘bio-acoustic resonance map’ of a user’s internal physiological state and translates this map into a spatially distributed pattern of audio and haptic feedback. This moves beyond simple reactive biofeedback to create a deeply immersive and personalized sensory experience aimed at achieving specific emotional or cognitive states.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Multi-Modal Bio-Sensing Array:**  High-resolution sensors capture real-time physiological data.
    *   **fNIRS (Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy):** Measures cortical blood flow, focusing on prefrontal cortex, amygdala and insula.
    *   **ECG (Electrocardiography):** Measures heart rate variability (HRV) for emotional state assessment.
    *   **GSR (Galvanic Skin Response):** Measures skin conductance to indicate arousal levels.
    *   **EEG (Electroencephalography):** Captures brainwave activity (alpha, beta, theta, delta) for cognitive state assessment.

2.  **Bio-Signal Feature Extraction & Mapping Engine:**
    *   **Real-time signal processing:** Extracts relevant features from raw bio-signals (e.g., HRV parameters, EEG band power, GSR peaks).
    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Uses techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the complexity of the bio-signal data.
    *   **Resonance Map Generation:** Creates a ‘resonance map’ – a multi-dimensional representation of the user’s internal state. This map assigns specific spatial coordinates to different bio-signal features (e.g., high HRV -> positive X coordinate, increased alpha power -> positive Y coordinate).  This is key – we're *spatially* representing the internal state.

3.  **Spatial Audio & Haptic Rendering System:**
    *   **Phased Array of Miniature Speakers:** A hemispherical array of miniature speakers capable of creating precise 3D soundscapes.
    *   **Array of Haptic Actuators:** A corresponding array of haptic actuators (vibration motors, electrotactile stimulators) strategically positioned around the user’s body.
    *   **Spatial Mapping Engine:** Translates the ‘resonance map’ into spatial instructions for the audio and haptic systems.  For example, a high value on the X-coordinate of the resonance map might be translated into a sound source positioned on the user’s right side and a vibration on their right shoulder.

4. **Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm:**
    * **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a reinforcement learning agent to dynamically adjust the parameters of the audio and haptic rendering system based on user feedback and physiological responses.
    * **User Feedback**: Incorporates user input (e.g., subjective ratings of relaxation, focus, or enjoyment) to refine the mapping between the resonance map and the sensory output.

**Workflow:**

1.  The user is equipped with the multi-modal bio-sensing array.
2.  The Bio-Signal Feature Extraction & Mapping Engine creates the personalized ‘resonance map’ in real-time.
3.  The Spatial Audio & Haptic Rendering System translates the resonance map into a spatially distributed pattern of audio and haptic feedback.
4.  The Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm continuously refines the mapping between the resonance map and the sensory output based on user feedback and physiological responses.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Adjustment Algorithm):**

```python
class SensoryAdjuster:

    def __init__(self, bio_signal_processor, spatial_renderer):
        self.bio_signal_processor = bio_signal_processor
        self.spatial_renderer = spatial_renderer
        self.q_table = {}
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.discount_factor = 0.9
        self.epsilon = 0.1

    def get_state(self):
        return self.bio_signal_processor.get_resonance_map()

    def choose_action(self, state):
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
            return self.get_random_action()
        else:
            return self.get_best_action(state)

    def apply_action(self, action, state):
        #Translate the action to a specific configuration of the spatial audio/haptic system
        self.spatial_renderer.set_configuration(action)
        # Get the reward based on the users response to the action.
        reward = self.get_reward(state)
        return reward

    def get_reward(self, state):
        #Use user input as a basis for getting the reward.
        return self.bio_signal_processor.get_user_reward(state)

    def update_q_table(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
        #Update Q table to optimize the reward.
        #Get the best action from the next state.
        #Update the Q table based on the actions.

        pass

    def run(self):
        state = self.get_state()
        while True:
            action = self.choose_action(state)
            reward = self.apply_action(action, state)
            next_state = self.get_state()
            self.update_q_table(state, action, reward, next_state)
            state = next_state
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple biofeedback by creating a spatially distributed representation of the user’s internal state and translating this map into a fully immersive and personalized sensory experience.  The key is the spatial mapping – it's not just about reacting to bio-signals, but about creating a sensory environment that *resonates* with the user's internal state on a deeper level. The dynamic adjustment algorithm ensures that the sensory experience is continuously refined to maximize the user's wellbeing and cognitive performance.  This system isn’t just about *reducing* stress – it’s about *orchestrating* an experience that facilitates a desired state of mind.
