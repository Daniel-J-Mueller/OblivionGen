## Dynamic Personal Space Projection & Contextual Awareness

**System Overview:**

This system expands upon the concept of a personal space within a shared 3D environment by introducing dynamic projection based on user intent *and* external contextual awareness.  Rather than a static ‘bubble’ around the user, the personal space fluidly adapts in size, shape, and content based on a combination of inferred user goals and real-world data.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Intent Inference Engine:**  Analyzes user actions (gaze direction, hand movements, voice commands, selected content, dwell time on objects, physiological data from wearable sensors – heart rate, skin conductance) to *predict* the user's immediate focus and potential needs.  This isn’t just “what are they looking at,” but “what are they *about* to do?”
2.  **Contextual Awareness Module:**  Integrates external data feeds:
    *   **Location:** Precise location data (GPS, indoor positioning) to understand the user’s physical environment.
    *   **Time of Day/Weather:** Influences content presentation (e.g., displaying relevant notifications about commute delays during rush hour, showing weather-appropriate content).
    *   **Calendar/Appointments:** Proactively surfaces relevant information for upcoming meetings or events.
    *   **Social Context:** Awareness of nearby users and their activity (with appropriate privacy controls).
    *   **Environmental Sensors:** Data from smart home devices, office sensors (temperature, lighting, noise levels) to adjust the personal space accordingly.
3.  **Dynamic Projection System:** Renders the personal space as a volumetric, deformable shell around the user.  This shell isn't a fixed size; it expands and contracts based on intent and context.  Content *within* the shell is also dynamically adjusted.
4. **Spatial Audio Integration:**  Personal space is not just visual; spatial audio cues reinforce the boundaries of the space and draw attention to relevant content.

**Operational Specifications:**

1.  **Personal Space States:** The system operates in several defined states:
    *   **Focused Mode:**  Personal space contracts tightly around the user, emphasizing immediate tasks or content.  Distractions are minimized.
    *   **Exploratory Mode:** Personal space expands, providing a broader canvas for browsing and discovery.  Related content is suggested.
    *   **Collaborative Mode:** Personal space partially overlaps with other users’ spaces, facilitating shared experiences.  Privacy boundaries are maintained.
    *   **Ambient Mode:** Personal space retracts to minimal size, providing a non-intrusive background for real-world interaction.

2.  **Content Prioritization & Presentation:**  The system prioritizes content based on intent and context.  For example:
    *   If the user is looking at a document and speaking about editing it, the editing tools are prominently displayed *within* their personal space.
    *   If the user has a meeting scheduled, the meeting agenda and relevant participants are displayed.
    *   If the user is near a smart home device, controls for that device are displayed.
    *   If the user is in a crowded area, the system filters out irrelevant notifications and prioritizes essential information.

3.  **Gesture & Voice Control:** Users can manipulate the personal space using gestures and voice commands.  Examples:
    *   “Expand my space” – Expands the personal space.
    *   “Focus on document” – Contracts the space and brings up relevant tools.
    *   Gesture: Pinch to zoom – Zooms in on content within the space.
    *   Gesture: Swipe to dismiss – Dismisses notifications or unwanted content.

4. **Privacy Safeguards:** Robust privacy controls are essential. Users must have full control over:
    *   What data is collected and used.
    *   Who can access their personal space.
    *   The level of detail displayed within the space.
    *   The ability to disable contextual awareness altogether.

**Pseudocode (Intent Inference Engine – Simplified):**

```
function inferIntent(gazeDirection, handMovements, voiceCommands, physiologicalData):
    intentScore = {}

    // Gaze Analysis
    if gazeDirection.object == "document":
        intentScore["editDocument"] += 0.7
        intentScore["readDocument"] += 0.3
    // Hand Movement Analysis
    if handMovements.action == "selection":
        intentScore["editDocument"] += 0.5

    // Voice Command Analysis
    if voiceCommands.contains("edit"):
        intentScore["editDocument"] += 0.9

    // Physiological Data (e.g., increased heart rate during editing)
    if physiologicalData.heartRate > threshold:
       intentScore["editDocument"] += 0.2

    // Determine primary intent
    primaryIntent = argmax(intentScore)

    return primaryIntent
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   VR/AR Headset with accurate tracking and hand/eye tracking.
*   Wearable sensors for physiological data (optional).
*   High-performance processing unit for real-time rendering and inference.
*   Secure network connection for accessing external data feeds.
