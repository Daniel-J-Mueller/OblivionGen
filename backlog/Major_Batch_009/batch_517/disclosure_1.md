## Dynamic Payload Composition for Subscription Events

**Specification:** A system to dynamically compose payloads delivered via the timer service, shifting from simple data delivery to complex event orchestration.

**Core Concept:** Instead of delivering a static payload at the scheduled time, the system builds the payload *at* execution time based on real-time data and pre-defined composition rules.  This allows for highly personalized and contextually relevant subscription events.

**Components:**

*   **Payload Composition Engine:** This component resides alongside the timer service and is responsible for constructing the final payload. It receives a 'payload template ID' as part of the timer request.
*   **Payload Template Repository:** Stores pre-defined payload templates. These templates contain placeholders for dynamic data. Example: `{user.name}, your {subscription.service} is expiring in {time.remaining}`.
*   **Data Source Integrations:** Connectors to various data sources (user profiles, subscription details, usage statistics, external APIs, etc.).  The Payload Composition Engine pulls data from these sources to populate the placeholders in the template.
*   **Rules Engine:** A system to define complex logic for determining *which* data to pull and *how* to transform it before inserting it into the template. This allows for conditional logic (e.g., "If user is a premium member, include a discount code").
*   **Client Configuration Extension:** The client configuration record is extended to include a 'default payload template ID' and a 'rules engine ID'. The rules engine ID points to a specific set of rules for that client.

**Workflow:**

1.  Client creates a timer request via the API, specifying the desired execution time and optionally overriding the default payload template and rules engine.
2.  Timer service stores the request.
3.  At the scheduled time, the timer service triggers the Payload Composition Engine.
4.  The Payload Composition Engine retrieves the client's default (or overridden) payload template and rules engine.
5.  The Rules Engine executes, pulling data from the configured Data Source Integrations.
6.  The Rules Engine transforms the data as needed.
7.  The Payload Composition Engine populates the payload template with the transformed data.
8.  The complete, dynamic payload is delivered to the destination.

**Pseudocode (Payload Composition Engine):**

```
function composePayload(timerRequest) {
  clientConfig = getClientConfig(timerRequest.clientId)
  payloadTemplateId = timerRequest.payloadTemplateId ?: clientConfig.defaultPayloadTemplateId
  rulesEngineId = timerRequest.rulesEngineId ?: clientConfig.rulesEngineId

  payloadTemplate = getPayloadTemplate(payloadTemplateId)
  rulesEngine = getRulesEngine(rulesEngineId)

  dynamicData = rulesEngine.execute(timerRequest.clientId, timerRequest.payload) // Pass the original payload for context

  composedPayload = populateTemplate(payloadTemplate, dynamicData)

  return composedPayload
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Personalized renewal reminders with tailored offers.
*   Usage-based notifications with custom recommendations.
*   Proactive support messages based on user behavior.
*   Dynamic pricing updates and promotions.
