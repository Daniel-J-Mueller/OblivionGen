## Dynamic Graph Embedding with Temporal Attention

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical clustering approach to incorporate a dynamic graph embedding that learns node representations evolving over time, using temporal attention mechanisms to prioritize relevant connections for clustering at each iteration. This moves beyond static similarity scores to capture the *changing* relationships between entities.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Input & Preprocessing:**

*   **Input:** Time-series data representing entity interactions. This can be edge creations/deletions in a graph, transactions, communication logs, etc. Each interaction has a timestamp.
*   **Embedding Layer:** Each entity is assigned an initial embedding vector.
*   **Temporal Encoding:**  A temporal encoding function (e.g., sine/cosine positional encoding, learned embeddings) is applied to the timestamp of each interaction.

**2. Dynamic Graph Construction & Embedding Update:**

*   **Iteration-Based Graph Construction:** At each analysis iteration *t*, a graph *G<sub>t</sub>* is constructed based on interactions occurring *up to time t*.
*   **Edge Weighting with Temporal Attention:** Edge weights between nodes in *G<sub>t</sub>* are determined by a temporal attention mechanism:

    *   **Query:** Node embedding of the source node.
    *   **Key:** Node embedding of the target node + temporal encoding of the interaction.
    *   **Value:**  Interaction data (e.g., interaction type, magnitude).
    *   **Attention Score:**  `score(Query, Key) = softmax(Query ⋅ Key)`
    *   **Weighted Edge:**  `edge_weight = Attention_Score * Value`
*   **Embedding Propagation:** Node embeddings are updated using a graph neural network (GNN) layer (e.g., Graph Convolutional Network, Graph Attention Network) that propagates information from neighboring nodes, weighted by `edge_weight`.

**3. Hierarchical Clustering Adaptation:**

*   **Similarity Criterion:** Instead of static similarity scores, the similarity between entity pairs is calculated based on the cosine similarity of their current embeddings. A threshold is maintained to trigger cluster formation.
*   **Cluster Formation:** As in the original patent, clusters are formed based on a similarity threshold.
*   **Spanning Tree Generation & Accumulation:**  Spanning trees are generated for each cluster. Accumulated spanning trees are used to reduce the number of entity pairs considered in subsequent iterations.
*   **Representative Node Selection:** Representative nodes are selected based on centrality measures within the cluster's spanning tree (e.g., betweenness centrality, degree centrality), but also incorporating the temporal evolution of the node’s embedding.

**4. Pseudocode - Embedding Update & Clustering:**

```pseudocode
# Initialization
Entities = {entity1, entity2, ...}
Initial_Embeddings = {entity: random_vector for entity in Entities}
Current_Iteration = 0

# Main Loop
while Current_Iteration < Max_Iterations:
    # 1. Construct Graph
    Graph = Construct_Graph(Interactions_up_to_time(Current_Iteration))

    # 2. Update Embeddings
    for Entity in Entities:
        Embedding = Initial_Embeddings[Entity] # Start with existing embedding
        Neighbor_Embeddings = []
        for Neighbor in Graph.Neighbors(Entity):
            Neighbor_Embeddings.append(Graph.EdgeWeight(Entity, Neighbor) * Initial_Embeddings[Neighbor])

        Embedding = Embedding + sum(Neighbor_Embeddings) # Apply embedding propagation
        Initial_Embeddings[Entity] = Embedding

    # 3. Clustering
    Clusters = Perform_Hierarchical_Clustering(Initial_Embeddings, Similarity_Threshold)

    # 4. Spanning Tree & Accumulation
    Accumulated_Spanning_Tree = Accumulate_Spanning_Tree(Clusters)

    # 5. Edge Reduction
    Reduced_Entity_Pairs = Reduce_Entity_Pairs(Accumulated_Spanning_Tree)

    Current_Iteration = Current_Iteration + 1

# Output: Hierarchical Representation
```

**5. Novelty:**

*   **Dynamic Embeddings:** Captures evolving relationships between entities, going beyond static similarity.
*   **Temporal Attention:** Prioritizes relevant connections based on the *timing* of interactions.
*   **Adaptive Clustering:** Clustering adapts to changing relationships, potentially identifying emerging communities and patterns.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Fraud Detection:**  Detecting anomalous transaction patterns over time.
*   **Social Network Analysis:**  Tracking the evolution of communities and influence.
*   **Recommendation Systems:** Providing personalized recommendations based on evolving user preferences.
*   **Cybersecurity:** Identifying malicious activity based on network traffic patterns.
