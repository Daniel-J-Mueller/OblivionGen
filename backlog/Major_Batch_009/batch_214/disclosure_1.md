## Dynamic Recipe Adaptation via Environmental Sensors

**Concept:** Extend voice-controlled recipe execution beyond simple step-by-step guidance. Integrate real-time environmental data (temperature, humidity, ambient light, presence of specific aromas) to dynamically adjust recipe parameters *during* execution, improving outcomes and accommodating variations in ingredient quality or user skill.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Integration:** System supports integration with a range of environmental sensors via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi (temperature, humidity, light, gas/aroma). Standardized API for sensor data ingestion.
*   **Adaptive Algorithm:** Core logic utilizes a rule-based system *and* a lightweight machine learning model (trained on recipe outcome data, sensor readings, and user feedback).
*   **Recipe Database Enhancement:** Existing recipe data is augmented with "adaptation profiles."  These profiles define how specific sensor readings influence recipe parameters. Examples:
    *   High ambient temperature: Reduce cooking time by X%, lower oven temperature by Y degrees.
    *   Low humidity: Increase liquid volume by Z%.
    *   Detection of burnt aroma: Initiate alarm, suggest immediate action (e.g., lower temperature, add liquid).
*   **Voice Interface Integration:**  System proactively communicates adaptations to the user via voice prompts. Example: "Detected low humidity. Increasing liquid volume by 2 tablespoons."  User can override suggestions.
*   **Learning Mode:** System records sensor data and user overrides during recipe execution. This data is used to refine adaptation profiles and improve accuracy over time.
*   **Ingredient Quality Assessment:**  Sensor data (e.g., aroma detection) can be used to assess ingredient quality and provide feedback to the user. Example: "The vanilla extract appears to be old. Consider using a fresh extract."
*   **Multi-Recipe Coordination:**  In scenarios involving multiple dishes, the system can prioritize adaptations based on the overall meal plan.

**Pseudocode (Adaptation Logic):**

```
function adaptRecipe(recipe, sensorData) {
  adaptationProfile = recipe.adaptationProfile;
  adaptedParameters = {};

  // Rule-based adjustments
  if (sensorData.temperature > adaptationProfile.maxTemperature) {
    adaptedParameters.cookingTime = recipe.cookingTime * (1 - adaptationProfile.temperatureReductionFactor);
    adaptedParameters.ovenTemperature = recipe.ovenTemperature - adaptationProfile.temperatureOffset;
    voicePrompt = "Temperature is high. Adjusting cooking time and oven temperature.";
  }

  if (sensorData.humidity < adaptationProfile.minHumidity) {
    adaptedParameters.liquidVolume = recipe.liquidVolume + adaptationProfile.humidityIncreaseFactor;
    voicePrompt = "Humidity is low. Increasing liquid volume.";
  }

  // Machine Learning-based adjustments (predictive model)
  predictedOutcome = mlModel.predict(sensorData);
  adaptedParameters = merge(adaptedParameters, predictedOutcome); // Overwrite existing values

  // Voice output
  if (voicePrompt) {
    tts.speak(voicePrompt);
  }

  return merge(recipe, adaptedParameters); // Return the adapted recipe
}
