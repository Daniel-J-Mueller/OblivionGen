**Adaptive UI Projection with Environmental Context**

**Core Concept:** Expand screen sharing beyond a 1:1 mirrored view to a dynamic, context-aware UI projection onto the remote user's perceived environment. Instead of simply *seeing* what's on the primary device, the remote user experiences an augmented reality overlay based on the shared UI elements and their surroundings.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Primary device (smartphone/tablet) utilizes onboard sensors (camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, barometer) to build a real-time 3D map of the immediate environment.
*   **Environmental Mapping:** Remote device receives environment data (point cloud or mesh) alongside UI data.  The remote device either builds its own environment map via its sensors *or* uses the primary device's data as a base.
*   **UI Element Projection:** The system identifies UI elements (buttons, text fields, maps, video feeds) and projects them onto surfaces in the remote device's environment.  
    *   Example: A navigation app's turn-by-turn directions are projected as glowing arrows onto the road ahead as seen through the remote device’s camera.
    *   Example: A music player's album art is projected onto a nearby wall.
    *   Example: A video call window is ‘pinned’ to a specific location in the remote environment.
*   **Interaction Layer:** Remote user interacts with projected UI elements using gestures, voice commands, or a dedicated remote controller. Interaction data is sent back to the primary device for execution.
*   **Occlusion Handling:** System accurately handles occlusion – projecting elements *behind* real-world objects or adjusting visibility based on the remote device's perspective.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Projections dynamically adjust based on movement of either device, changes in lighting conditions, or alterations to the UI on the primary device.
*   **Calibration Routine:** Initial calibration phase establishes relative positions and orientations of the two devices, establishing a consistent spatial relationship.

**Pseudocode (Remote Device – Environment Processing & Projection):**

```
// Initial Setup
Receive Environment Data (Point Cloud/Mesh) from Primary Device
Initialize AR Engine
Establish Tracking (Sensor Fusion – Camera, IMU)

// Main Loop
While (Connection Active) {
  Receive UI Data (Element Type, Position, Size, Content)
  Receive Updated Environment Data (if available)

  // World Tracking
  Update World Pose (using sensor fusion)

  // Projection Mapping
  For Each UI Element {
    Calculate Projection Matrix (based on Element Position, World Pose, Camera Parameters)
    Render UI Element onto AR Scene
    Handle Occlusion (using depth information)
  }

  // Interaction Handling
  Process User Input (Gestures, Voice, Controller)
  Send Interaction Data to Primary Device

  Render AR Scene (Display projected UI and real-world view)
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Remote Technical Support:**  Remote technician "projects" UI elements onto the user's device, guiding them through troubleshooting steps visually.
*   **Collaborative Gaming:** Players share a mixed-reality gaming experience, with game elements overlaid onto their real-world environments.
*   **Hands-Free Navigation:** Driver receives turn-by-turn directions projected onto the windshield or road ahead, eliminating the need to look at a screen.
*   **Remote Assistance for Visually Impaired:**  UI elements are projected as tactile or auditory cues, providing information about the surrounding environment.
