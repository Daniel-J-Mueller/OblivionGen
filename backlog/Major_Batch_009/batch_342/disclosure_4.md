**Dynamic Dictionary Fusion for Multi-Modal Compression**

**Concept:** Extend adaptive dictionary compression by dynamically fusing dictionaries generated from *different data modalities* during compression. This allows leveraging redundancies *across* data types, potentially achieving significantly higher compression ratios for complex, multi-modal data.

**Specs:**

1.  **Modality-Specific Dictionary Generation:**
    *   Implement separate dictionary generation modules for each supported modality (e.g., text, image, audio, video, sensor data).
    *   Each module should employ techniques appropriate for that modality (e.g., Lempel-Ziv for text, feature extraction and clustering for images/audio).
    *   Dictionaries are initially generated from a training dataset representative of the expected input.

2.  **Real-time Modality Detection:**
    *   A pre-processing step analyzes incoming data streams to identify the modality present in each block. This could involve basic file type detection, header analysis, or more sophisticated machine learning classification.

3.  **Dynamic Dictionary Selection & Fusion:**
    *   Based on the detected modality, a primary dictionary is selected.
    *   A “fusion engine” assesses the similarity between the primary dictionary and secondary dictionaries (dictionaries from other modalities). Similarity metrics could include:
        *   **Sequence similarity:**  Comparing the longest common subsequences between dictionary entries.
        *   **Feature vector similarity:**  Representing dictionary entries as feature vectors (e.g., using embeddings) and calculating cosine similarity.
    *   If a significant similarity is detected, entries from the secondary dictionary are *merged* into the primary dictionary, *or* a new hybrid dictionary is created.  A threshold determines the degree of merging.  Low-similarity entries are excluded to avoid bloat.
    *   A “recency” metric tracks how recently a dictionary entry was used. Less-used entries from the primary dictionary may be replaced with more promising entries from the secondary dictionary.

4.  **Compression & Decompression:**
    *   Compression proceeds as in standard adaptive dictionary compression, but using the dynamically fused dictionary.
    *   Decompression requires transmitting information about which dictionaries were used at each stage, allowing the decompression engine to reconstruct the fused dictionary.

**Pseudocode (Fusion Engine):**

```
function fuse_dictionaries(primary_dict, secondary_dict, similarity_threshold):
  fused_dict = primary_dict.copy()

  for entry2 in secondary_dict:
    best_match = None
    max_similarity = 0

    for entry1 in fused_dict:
      similarity = calculate_similarity(entry1, entry2)
      if similarity > max_similarity:
        max_similarity = similarity
        best_match = entry1

    if max_similarity > similarity_threshold:
      # Merge/Replace based on recency or other criteria
      # Example: Replace least recently used entry
      lru_entry = find_least_recently_used(fused_dict)
      if lru_entry != None:
          fused_dict.remove(lru_entry)
          fused_dict.add(entry2)

  return fused_dict
```

**Example Use Case:**

Compressing a multimedia document containing text, images, and audio. The system would:

1.  Generate separate dictionaries for text, images, and audio from a training set.
2.  Analyze the document data stream.
3.  When processing a text block, the text dictionary is used as the primary. If the text contains image captions, and the image dictionary contains common image labels (e.g., "sky", "tree"), those labels may be merged into the text dictionary.
4.  When processing an audio block, the audio dictionary is used as the primary. If the audio contains spoken words found in the text dictionary, those words might be merged.
5.  Decompression reconstructs the dynamic dictionary based on metadata embedded in the compressed stream.
