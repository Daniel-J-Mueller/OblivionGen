## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction with Dynamic Resolution Wavelet Decomposition

**Concept:** Expanding on the idea of decomposing sound fields, this system moves beyond directional component separation to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene itself – not just “where” sounds are coming from, but “what” is present in the environment, leveraging dynamic resolution wavelet analysis.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multi-microphone array data (minimum 4 microphones, configurable array geometry). Raw audio streams.
*   **Wavelet Decomposition Engine:**  A custom wavelet transform engine capable of *dynamic resolution*. Standard wavelet transforms use fixed resolutions across the frequency spectrum. This engine adjusts resolution based on frequency – higher resolution for lower frequencies (better temporal resolution, critical for transient events) and lower resolution for higher frequencies (captures broad spectral characteristics without excessive computational load). The wavelet family will be selectable (e.g., Daubechies, Symlets) based on application requirements.
*   **Spatial Mapping Module:**
    *   Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and beamforming techniques to create a coarse spatial map. This map identifies potential sound sources.
    *   Combines spatial data with wavelet coefficients to estimate the size, shape, and material properties of reflecting surfaces within the environment. This is achieved by analyzing the subtle variations in wavelet coefficients caused by reflections.
*   **Semantic Classification Layer:** A deep learning model trained on a database of acoustic signatures associated with different objects and events (e.g., speech, music, car horn, glass breaking).
    *   Inputs: Wavelet coefficients, spatial map data, and estimated material properties.
    *   Outputs: Probabilistic classification of objects and events present in the acoustic scene. Semantic labels will include object type, event type, and estimated distance.
*   **Acoustic Rendering Engine:**  A system capable of synthesizing realistic acoustic scenes based on the output of the Semantic Classification Layer and the estimated material properties. This module allows for verification of the scene reconstruction and provides a method for generating training data for the Semantic Classification Layer.
*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-performance multi-core processor.
    *   Dedicated GPU for wavelet transform and deep learning processing.
    *   High-bandwidth memory for storing large wavelet coefficient arrays.
    *   Low-latency audio interface for real-time processing.

**Pseudocode (Core Processing Loop):**

```
function processAudio(audioData, microphoneArrayGeometry):
    waveletCoefficients = performDynamicResolutionWaveletTransform(audioData)
    spatialMap = createSpatialMap(waveletCoefficients, microphoneArrayGeometry)
    surfaceEstimates = estimateSurfaceProperties(waveletCoefficients, spatialMap)
    semanticLabels = classifyScene(waveletCoefficients, surfaceEstimates, spatialMap)
    renderAcousticScene(semanticLabels, surfaceEstimates)
    return semanticLabels // Outputs scene description
end function
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems primarily focus on source separation or localization. This design emphasizes *reconstruction* of the entire acoustic environment, providing a more holistic understanding of the scene.  The dynamic resolution wavelet transform, combined with the semantic classification layer, allows for a detailed and accurate representation of the acoustic environment. This could be used for applications such as:

*   Smart surveillance systems that can identify and categorize events in real-time.
*   Assistive technology for the visually impaired, providing a detailed auditory representation of the surroundings.
*   Virtual and augmented reality applications, creating more realistic and immersive audio experiences.
*   Acoustic fingerprinting of spaces for security or identification purposes.
