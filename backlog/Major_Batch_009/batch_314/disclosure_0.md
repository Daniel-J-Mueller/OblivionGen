## Dynamic Contextual Audio Layering

**Concept:** Expand upon the "conversation card" concept to introduce dynamically layered audio experiences triggered by voice commands *while* existing audio is playing, creating a richer, more interactive experience without interrupting the primary audio stream. This goes beyond simply swapping audio content.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Architecture:**

*   **Audio Engine:** A multi-channel audio engine capable of mixing and prioritizing multiple audio streams.
*   **Contextual Trigger Engine:**  A natural language processing (NLP) module that identifies user intent from voice commands *while* the primary audio stream is active.  This module analyzes for keywords, phrases, and contextual cues relevant to layering.
*   **Layer Library:** A repository of pre-recorded and dynamically generated audio “layers”.  These layers are categorized by type (e.g., informational, sound effect, ambient noise, music sting).
*   **Priority System:** A configurable priority system governing how layers are mixed.  Layers can be assigned a priority level (High, Medium, Low) determining their relative volume and potential to interrupt other layers.
*   **Dynamic Parameter Control:**  Parameters for each audio layer (volume, pan, reverb, EQ) are adjustable in real-time based on contextual factors (e.g., distance of sound effect, emotional tone).

**2. Functionality & Operation:**

1.  **Primary Audio Playback:**  Device plays primary audio content (music, podcast, audiobook).
2.  **Voice Input Capture:** Device continuously monitors for voice input.
3.  **Intent Recognition:** Contextual Trigger Engine analyzes voice input *without* interrupting primary audio.
4.  **Layer Selection:** Based on recognized intent, a relevant audio layer is selected from the Layer Library.
5.  **Layer Mixing & Playback:**  Selected layer is mixed with the primary audio stream, adhering to the configured priority system. The primary audio stream's volume can be dynamically attenuated or unaffected.
6.  **Contextual Adaptation:** Layer parameters (volume, pan, effects) are adjusted based on contextual factors.

**3. Layer Types (Examples):**

*   **Informational Layers:** Short audio clips providing additional information related to the primary content (e.g., "Learn more about the artist," "Show me lyrics," "What year was this song released?").
*   **Sound Effect Layers:** Ambient sounds or distinct effects that enhance the scene (e.g., playing rain sounds during a nature documentary, adding a whoosh sound during a space-themed podcast).
*   **Interactive Layers:**  Prompts or questions that encourage user engagement (e.g., "Would you like to hear a similar song?").
*   **Personalized Layers:** Audio content tailored to the user's preferences or history.

**4. Pseudocode (Layer Activation):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessVoiceCommand(voiceData)

    intent = AnalyzeVoiceData(voiceData)

    IF intent.category == "Information" THEN
        layer = GetLayer("Information_" + intent.keyword)
        MixLayer(layer, volume=0.6) // moderate volume for information
    ELSE IF intent.category == "SoundEffect" THEN
        layer = GetLayer("SoundEffect_" + intent.keyword)
        MixLayer(layer, volume=0.3, pan=Random(-0.2, 0.2)) // subtle sound effect, randomized panning
    ELSE IF intent.category == "Interactive" THEN
        layer = GetLayer("Interactive_" + intent.keyword)
        MixLayer(layer, volume=0.8) // clear interactive prompt
    END IF

END FUNCTION
```

**5. Hardware Considerations:**

*   Multi-channel audio DAC
*   Dedicated audio processing chip (DSP) for real-time mixing and effects
*   High-quality microphone array for accurate voice capture

**6. Potential Use Cases:**

*   Enhanced podcast listening experience with contextual sound effects and information layers.
*   Interactive audiobooks with dynamically added music and character voices.
*   Immersive gaming audio with dynamic soundscapes and contextual cues.
*   Accessible audio experiences for users with visual impairments.
