## Dynamic Access ‘Shadowing’ with Predictive Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Extend the gradual expiration concept by *shadowing* user access – mirroring live actions to a limited ‘shadow’ resource – *before* restrictions fully engage. This allows for behavioral analysis *during* the grace period, predicting critical workflow interruptions and dynamically adjusting access restrictions to minimize disruption.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Resource Creation:** Upon credential nearing initial expiration, automatically create a ‘shadow’ instance of the user’s frequently accessed resources. This is a read-only mirror, updated in near real-time with user actions.

2.  **Behavioral Monitoring & Profiling:**  Continuously monitor user interaction with the shadow resources. Capture data points including:
    *   Resource access frequency.
    *   Data modification patterns.
    *   Workflow sequences (e.g., opening document A, then editing field X, then saving).
    *   Application usage patterns.

3.  **Workflow Interruption Prediction:** Employ a machine learning model (trained on historical data and real-time monitoring) to predict the impact of impending access restrictions on user workflows.  Key metrics:
    *   Probability of workflow failure.
    *   Estimated time to recover from workflow interruption.
    *   Criticality of affected resources/data.

4.  **Dynamic Access Adjustment:** Based on predicted workflow interruption, dynamically adjust the *level* of access restriction during the grace period.  Instead of a linear restriction (e.g., full access -> read-only -> no access), offer granular control:
    *   **Priority Workflow Preservation:** Maintain full access to resources critical for ongoing tasks with high workflow interruption probability.
    *   **Delayed Restriction:** Delay restriction of less critical resources.
    *   **Temporary Access Extension:**  Grant limited, temporary extensions to expiring sessions for specific tasks with high criticality.

5.  **Access Right Level Mapping:** Define a range of access right levels beyond simple ‘read/write/no access’. Include levels like:
    *   ‘Limited Write’ – restrictions on data modification (e.g., no deletion, only edits to specific fields).
    *   ‘Audited Write’ – all write operations are logged and potentially require approval.
    *   ‘Background Processing’ - ability to initiate long-running processes but not directly interact with results.

6.  **Pseudocode (Dynamic Access Adjustment):**

    ```
    function AdjustAccess(user, resource, accessRequestTime, expirationInfo) {
      workflowImpact = PredictWorkflowImpact(user, resource, accessRequestTime, expirationInfo);
      if (workflowImpact.probabilityOfFailure > threshold) {
        accessRight = GrantFullAccess(resource);  // Maintain full access
        LogEvent("Workflow Preservation: Full access granted to " + resource);
      } else if (workflowImpact.criticality > threshold) {
        accessRight = GrantLimitedAccess(resource); // Limited or audited access
        LogEvent("Workflow Mitigation: Limited access granted to " + resource);
      } else {
        accessRight = DetermineAccessRightBasedOnDuration(accessRequestTime, expirationInfo); //Standard gradual restriction
      }
      return accessRight;
    }
    ```

7.  **Sensor Data Integration:** Extend sensor data analysis beyond security breaches. Include data related to user activity (e.g., keyboard/mouse activity, screen orientation) to improve workflow prediction accuracy. Is the user in the middle of writing a critical document? Then delay restrictions.

8.  **Alerting & User Communication:** Proactively notify users of impending access restrictions and provide tools to mitigate disruption (e.g., automatic document saving, workflow continuation options).
