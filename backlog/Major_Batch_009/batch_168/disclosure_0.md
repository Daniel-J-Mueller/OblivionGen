## Adaptive Modular Truck Bed System

**Concept:** A truck bed system utilizing a network of interconnected, dynamically reconfigurable modules. These modules aren't just storage – they incorporate active elements for temperature control, weight distribution, and even basic robotic assistance.

**Module Specs:**

*   **Dimensions:** Standardized base unit: 60cm x 60cm x 30cm. Modules can combine to create larger units (120cm x 60cm, 60cm x 120cm, etc.). Max stack height 3 modules.
*   **Material:** Lightweight alloy frame with impact-resistant polymer panels. Internal honeycomb structure for strength and weight reduction.
*   **Connectivity:** Each module features a standardized docking interface on all six sides.  Interface includes power delivery (12V/24V DC), data communication (CAN bus), and mechanical locking mechanisms.
*   **Module Types:**
    *   **Standard Cargo:**  Basic storage, internal dividers configurable via app.
    *   **Temperature Controlled:**  Integrated thermoelectric cooler/heater.  Temperature set via app, monitored by internal sensors. Target Temp: -20C to 50C
    *   **Weight Distribution:** Internal pneumatic bladders.  Controlled via app to shift weight for optimal vehicle handling. Weight Capacity: 250kg
    *   **Robotic Assist:**  Small, integrated robotic arm (reach: 60cm, lift capacity: 5kg). Controlled via app or voice command. Purpose: Assists with loading/unloading, retrieving items.
    *   **Power Supply:** Module containing a high-capacity battery pack & inverter. Provides power for other modules, or external devices. Capacity: 5kWh
    *   **Sensor Module:** Houses sensors for environmental monitoring (temperature, humidity, vibration, impact). Data transmitted to vehicle’s onboard computer and user app.
*   **Control System:**
    *   **User App:** Mobile app for configuring module layout, setting temperatures, adjusting weight distribution, controlling robotic arm, viewing sensor data.
    *   **Vehicle Integration:** CAN bus connection to vehicle’s onboard computer.  Displays module status, alerts for temperature/weight anomalies, integrates with vehicle’s navigation system.
*   **Actuation:**
    *   Modules connect via automated locking system.
    *   Pneumatic actuators within weight distribution modules.
    *   Servo motors for robotic arm.
    *   Thermoelectric coolers/heaters.

**Pseudocode (Module Configuration):**

```
// User selects desired module configuration in app
function configureModules(moduleArray) {
  // moduleArray is a list of desired module types
  // Calculate optimal layout based on truck bed dimensions and module sizes
  layout = calculateLayout(moduleArray);

  // Display layout to user for confirmation
  displayLayout(layout);

  // If user confirms, send configuration commands to truck's CAN bus
  if (userConfirms()) {
    for (each module in layout) {
      sendModuleCommand(module, "connect", module.position);
    }
  }
}
```

**Additional Notes:**

*   Potential for automated module reconfiguration based on delivery route/cargo.
*   Modules could be rented or leased, providing a flexible and cost-effective solution.
*   Data collected by sensor modules could be used for supply chain optimization.
*   Material may be partially recycled plastics to decrease overall cost.
