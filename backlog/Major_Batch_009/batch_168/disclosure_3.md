## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Predictive Device Interaction

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the concept of predicting user behavior but shifts the response from automated device adjustments to *haptic feedback* delivered through the device itself. The goal isn't to *do* things for the user, but to subtly guide them *toward* likely actions, enhancing intuitive interaction.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Array:**  A multi-point haptic array integrated into the device casing (e.g., edges, back surface, screen bezel).  This is *not* simple vibration; it utilizes localized pressure variations, texture changes (via micro-actuators), or thermal gradients.  Resolution: minimum 20 points, ideally 100+.
*   **Contextual Sensor Suite:**  Combines existing sensors (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope) with environmental sensors (ambient light, temperature, humidity, microphone).  Also includes a proximity sensor array to detect hand position relative to the device.
*   **Dedicated Processing Unit:** A low-power processor dedicated to real-time sensor fusion, behavioral prediction, and haptic pattern generation.  This offloads processing from the main application processor.

**Software Architecture:**

1.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Continuous collection of sensor data.
2.  **Behavioral Prediction Engine:**  A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, Bayesian network) trained on user interaction data. The model predicts the *probability* of various actions (e.g., opening an app, adjusting volume, sending a message).  Uses time, location, device state, contextual information, and learned patterns. *Crucially, predictions aren't acted upon directly.*
3.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:** Based on predicted probabilities, the system generates a *subtle* haptic pattern.  Higher probabilities translate to stronger/more defined patterns.  Patterns are designed to *suggest* likely actions, not dictate them. For example:
    *   **App Launch Suggestion:**  A brief, localized pressure increase on the edge of the device corresponding to the icon location of a frequently used app, when the user is in a location/time where they typically use it.
    *   **Volume Adjustment Cue:**  A gentle, pulsing texture change on the device back, indicating the direction to swipe for volume adjustment.
    *   **Notification Preview:** Subtle thermal gradient indicating an incoming notification, corresponding to the app icon.
4.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from user interactions. If a user ignores a haptic cue, the prediction model is adjusted to reduce the probability of that cue in the future.  If a user responds positively, the probability is increased.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
function generate_haptic_pattern(predicted_actions, user_context) {
  // predicted_actions: Array of {action: string, probability: float}
  // user_context:  Current sensor data (location, time, etc.)

  haptic_pattern = {}

  for each action in predicted_actions {
    if (action.probability > threshold) { // Threshold adjustable by user
      //Determine haptic stimulus based on action type
      if(action.action == "launch_app"){
        haptic_pattern[action.action] = generate_app_launch_stimulus(action.probability)
      }
      else if(action.action == "adjust_volume"){
        haptic_pattern[action.action] = generate_volume_stimulus(action.probability)
      }
      //Add more stimulus patterns for various actions
    }
  }
  return haptic_pattern
}

function generate_app_launch_stimulus(probability){
  //Map probability to pressure, location, and duration
  pressure = map(probability, 0, 1, 0, MAX_PRESSURE);
  location = app_icon_location;
  duration = base_duration * probability;
  return { pressure: pressure, location: location, duration: duration}
}
```

**User Customization:**

*   **Sensitivity Control:** User can adjust the overall sensitivity of the haptic feedback.
*   **Action Whitelisting/Blacklisting:** User can specify which actions trigger haptic cues.
*   **Haptic Pattern Preferences:** User can choose from a variety of pre-defined haptic patterns or create their own.
