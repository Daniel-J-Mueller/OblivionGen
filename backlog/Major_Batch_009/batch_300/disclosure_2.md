## Dynamic Source ‘Health’ Scoring & Proactive Diversification

**Concept:** Expand beyond static source scoring to a dynamic ‘health’ assessment factoring in real-time performance, risk, and external data. Implement proactive diversification strategies to mitigate supply chain disruptions *before* they occur.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Acquisition & ‘Health’ Metric Construction**

*   **Real-time Performance Monitoring:**
    *   API integration with source systems to track: order fulfillment rates, shipping times, return rates, defect rates, customer complaints.
    *   Web scraping of public review sites, social media feeds for sentiment analysis related to the source.
    *   Data ingestion from logistics providers (UPS, FedEx, DHL) regarding on-time delivery performance.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Geopolitical risk data feeds (e.g., conflict zones, trade embargoes, natural disaster probabilities) linked to source locations.
    *   Financial risk scores for sources (credit ratings, bankruptcy watchlists).
    *   Cybersecurity risk assessments (based on publicly available breach reports, security certifications).
*   **External Data Enrichment:**
    *   News article monitoring (using NLP) for events impacting source operations (e.g., factory fires, labor strikes).
    *   Weather data integration to anticipate disruptions due to extreme weather events.
    *   Commodity price fluctuations impacting input costs.
*   **‘Health’ Score Calculation:**
    *   Weighted sum of normalized scores from each data category (performance, risk, external factors).
    *   Weightings dynamically adjusted based on the criticality of the sourced item and overall supply chain resilience goals.
    *   Score decays over time to reflect the recency of information.

**II. Proactive Diversification Engine**

*   **Threshold-Based Alerting:** System generates alerts when a source’s ‘health’ score falls below a predefined threshold.
*   **Automated Diversification Trigger:** When a source’s score drops below a critical level, the system automatically initiates a search for alternative sources.
*   **Alternative Source Identification:**
    *   Uses the existing keyword-based search methodology but prioritizes sources with:
        *   High ‘health’ scores.
        *   Geographically diverse locations.
        *   Multiple sourcing options (to reduce single points of failure).
    *   Leverages machine learning to predict the likelihood of a new source successfully fulfilling orders based on historical data.
*   **Dynamic Inventory Allocation:** System adjusts inventory allocation across sources based on their ‘health’ scores and predicted reliability.
*   **Multi-Source Order Routing:** Orders are automatically routed to multiple sources simultaneously to mitigate the impact of a single source failure.
*   **Automated Contract Negotiation:**  System initiates automated contract negotiations with alternative sources to secure pricing and capacity.

**III. System Architecture**

*   **Microservices-based architecture:**  Each component (data acquisition, risk assessment, diversification engine) is deployed as a separate microservice.
*   **Event-driven communication:**  Microservices communicate via an event bus (e.g., Kafka) to ensure loose coupling and scalability.
*   **Data lake:**  All data is stored in a data lake (e.g., AWS S3) for long-term storage and analysis.
*   **Machine learning platform:**  A machine learning platform (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) is used to train and deploy predictive models.

**Pseudocode (Diversification Engine):**

```
function diversify_supply(item_id):
  source_list = get_current_sources(item_id)
  for source in source_list:
    health_score = calculate_health_score(source)
    if health_score < critical_threshold:
      alternative_sources = find_alternative_sources(item_id)
      prioritized_sources = prioritize_sources(alternative_sources)
      allocate_inventory(prioritized_sources)
      route_orders(prioritized_sources)
      initiate_contract_negotiation(prioritized_sources)
```
