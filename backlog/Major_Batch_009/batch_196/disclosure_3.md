## Dynamic Audience-Driven Product Sequencing

**Concept:** Leverage real-time audience engagement metrics *during* a live stream to dynamically adjust the order of products presented, maximizing conversion rates and viewer retention.  This builds on the existing sequence editing functionality, but moves from pre-production editing to *in-flight* optimization.

**Specs:**

*   **Metric Collection:** System collects the following metrics *per client* (or aggregated, with client-level detail available):
    *   View duration on each product detail page.
    *   Click-through rate on selectable product components.
    *   Add-to-cart events.
    *   Chat sentiment analysis regarding each product (positive/negative/neutral).
    *   “Pulse” input: A dedicated, lightweight UI element (e.g., heart icon) allowing viewers to quickly express interest in a product.
    *   Polling results (as already present in the patent, but integrated into the dynamic sequencing).
*   **Sequencing Algorithm:** A weighted scoring system calculates a "demand score" for each product in the sequence. Weights are configurable via the UI.  Example: `Demand Score = (0.4 * View Duration) + (0.3 * Click-Through Rate) + (0.2 * Chat Sentiment Score) + (0.1 * Pulse Count)`.
*   **Dynamic Reordering:**
    1.  Every *N* seconds (configurable, default 60 seconds), the system re-evaluates the demand scores for all remaining products in the sequence.
    2.  If the demand score for a product *i* is significantly higher (configurable threshold) than the product currently scheduled to be presented next, the sequence is dynamically reordered, bringing product *i* forward.
    3.  The reordering is performed seamlessly, minimizing disruption to the live stream. (see “Transition Management” below).
*   **UI Integration:**
    *   Producer UI displays:
        *   Real-time demand scores for each product.
        *   Visual representation of the current sequence and any proposed reordering.
        *   Controls to override the dynamic sequencing algorithm (manual control).
        *   Configurable weights for the demand score calculation.
        *   Threshold for significant demand score difference triggering reordering.
    *   Option to activate/deactivate dynamic sequencing.
*   **Transition Management:**
    *   A “soft transition” buffer is implemented. Rather than instantly switching to a new product, the system displays a visually engaging transition (e.g., product spotlight reel, related products) for a few seconds while preparing for the new segment.
    *   The system automatically adjusts any pre-scheduled promotional elements (e.g., on-screen graphics, special offers) to match the dynamically reordered sequence.
* **Predictive Sequencing:** Integrate a machine learning model to *predict* product demand based on historical data, viewer profiles, and real-time stream data. This adds a proactive layer to the reactive dynamic sequencing.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function update_sequence(current_sequence, stream_data):
  demand_scores = calculate_demand_scores(stream_data)
  predicted_scores = predict_demand_scores(historical_data, stream_data)
  combined_scores = (0.6 * demand_scores) + (0.4 * predicted_scores)  //Weighting of real-time vs. predictive

  new_sequence = sort_by_score(current_sequence, combined_scores) // Sort remaining items

  if significant_change(new_sequence, current_sequence):
    transition_buffer(new_sequence[0])
    return new_sequence
  else:
    return current_sequence
```
