## Adaptive Contextual Component Prioritization & ‘Ghosting’

**Concept:** Enhance conversational recovery not by *choosing* between components, but by dynamically layering them. Introduce a system where multiple components operate in parallel, with their outputs blended based on confidence scores and user interaction history.  A ‘ghosting’ mechanism allows for transient component activation/deactivation, mitigating the perception of failure.

**Specification:**

**1. Component Architecture:**

*   **Base Components:** Existing functional modules (similar to those in the patent). These handle core tasks (e.g., weather, music, navigation).
*   **Contextual Layer:** A new module responsible for analyzing user input *beyond* intent and entities. This analyzes sentiment, phrasing complexity, and conversational history.
*   **Blending Engine:**  This module receives outputs from Base Components and the Contextual Layer. It uses a weighted blending algorithm to produce a unified response.
*   **‘Ghost’ Components:**  Components capable of running ‘silently’ in the background, providing data to the blending engine without directly generating audible/visible output.

**2.  Dynamic Weighting Algorithm:**

*   **Confidence Scores:** Each Base Component provides a confidence score for its output.
*   **Contextual Analysis Weights:** The Contextual Layer assigns weights to components based on:
    *   **Sentiment:** Positive sentiment boosts components offering proactive suggestions. Negative sentiment prioritizes error correction/assistance.
    *   **Phrasing Complexity:**  Complex phrasing triggers components offering detailed explanations. Simple phrasing favors concise responses.
    *   **User History:** Prior component selections & feedback influence weights.
    *   **Real-time User Engagement:** Monitoring for hesitation, repetition, or ‘undo’ signals triggers re-weighting.
*   **Blending Function:**  A weighted average is calculated for each component's output, producing a blended response.

**3. ‘Ghosting’ Mechanism:**

*   **Silent Activation:** Components can be activated ‘silently’ in the background, processing user input without generating immediate output.
*   **Data Contribution:** Silent components contribute data to the blending engine.
*   **Transient Activation/Deactivation:** Components are dynamically activated/deactivated based on confidence scores, contextual analysis, and user feedback. If a component consistently produces low-confidence results, it is temporarily ‘ghosted’ (deactivated).
*   **Seamless Failover:** If a primary component fails, a ‘ghosted’ component with relevant data can be seamlessly activated, mitigating the perception of error.

**4.  Pseudocode Example (Blending Engine):**

```
function blend_response(user_input):
  // Get outputs from Base Components
  component_outputs = get_component_outputs(user_input)

  // Get Contextual Analysis weights
  contextual_weights = analyze_context(user_input)

  // Calculate blended response
  blended_response = {}
  for component, output in component_outputs.items():
    weight = contextual_weights.get(component, 0.1) // Default weight
    blended_response[component] = output * weight

  // Normalize weights to sum to 1
  total_weight = sum(blended_response.values())
  for component in blended_response:
    blended_response[component] /= total_weight

  // Return the blended response
  return blended_response
```

**5.  Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Multi-core processor capable of parallel processing.
*   Sufficient RAM to accommodate multiple active components.
*   Machine learning framework for contextual analysis and weight prediction.
*   API for seamless communication between components.
