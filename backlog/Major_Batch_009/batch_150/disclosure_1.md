## Adaptive Proximity-Based Service Triggering

**Concept:** Expand beyond device provisioning to utilize proximity detection for dynamically adjusting service levels or features based on user context and device relationships. Instead of *just* establishing a connection, the system learns and responds to proximity events to offer personalized experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Proximity Zones:** Define multiple proximity zones (e.g., Immediate – <1m, Near – 1-5m, Far – 5-10m) based on radio signal strength (BLE, WiFi, UWB). These zones aren't fixed; the system learns optimal boundaries per device pair.
*   **Service Profiles:** Each device maintains a set of “Service Profiles.” These profiles define actions to be taken based on proximity zone and the identity of other devices nearby. Examples:
    *   **"Home Entertainment"**: When near a smart TV, automatically cast music or video.
    *   **"Productivity Boost"**: Near a work laptop, disable social media notifications.
    *   **"Security Enhancement"**: Near a smart lock, automatically activate enhanced security protocols.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** Implement a reinforcement learning algorithm to optimize Service Profile activation.  The algorithm rewards actions that lead to positive user feedback (explicit ratings, implicit usage patterns – e.g., continued music playback, prolonged app usage).
*   **Dynamic Profile Creation:** Allow users to create custom Service Profiles through a mobile app. The app should provide a simple, visual interface to define trigger conditions (proximity zones, device types) and actions (app launch, settings change, data transfer).
*   **Contextual Awareness Integration:** Integrate with other sensor data (location, time of day, activity recognition) to refine Service Profile activation. Example: Only activate “Productivity Boost” during work hours.

**Pseudocode (Service Profile Activation):**

```
function activateServiceProfiles(deviceA, deviceB, proximityZone, sensorData):
    // 1. Retrieve relevant Service Profiles for deviceA
    profiles = getServiceProfiles(deviceA, deviceB)

    // 2. Filter profiles based on proximity zone and sensor data
    filteredProfiles = []
    for profile in profiles:
        if (profile.proximityZone == proximityZone) and (profile.sensorConditionsMet(sensorData)):
            filteredProfiles.append(profile)

    // 3. Prioritize profiles (based on user preference or learning algorithm)
    sortedProfiles = prioritizeProfiles(filteredProfiles)

    // 4. Execute the highest priority profile
    if (sortedProfiles.length > 0):
        executeProfile(sortedProfiles[0])

function executeProfile(profile):
    // Perform actions defined in the profile
    // (e.g., launch app, change settings, send data)

function prioritizeProfiles(profiles):
    // Use a learning algorithm to rank profiles
    // based on user feedback and usage patterns
    // (e.g., reinforcement learning)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Devices with BLE, WiFi, or UWB capability.
*   Sensors for contextual awareness (location, activity, etc.).

**Software Requirements:**

*   Mobile app for Service Profile creation and management.
*   Cloud-based platform for learning algorithm and data storage.
