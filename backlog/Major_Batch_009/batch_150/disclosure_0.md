## Dynamic Salt Rotation & Predictive Entropy

**Concept:** Enhance security by not just *having* a salt, but actively rotating it based on predicted entropy of user behavior and communication patterns, coupled with a tiered key derivation function.

**Specification:**

**I. Entropy Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User agent strings.
    *   IP address geolocation.
    *   Time of day/week of login attempt.
    *   Keystroke dynamics (analyzed client-side, transmitted securely).
    *   Network traffic analysis (packet size variance, timing).
*   **Algorithm:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict the entropy of a login attempt. Higher entropy indicates a potentially more sophisticated attack vector. Output is a scaled entropy score (0.0 - 1.0).
*   **Output:** Real-time entropy score for each authentication attempt.

**II. Tiered Key Derivation Function (TKDF):**

*   **Input:**
    *   Base Salt (Initially generated and stored).
    *   Dynamic Salt (Generated per authentication attempt – see Section III).
    *   Customer Password.
    *   Entropy Score (From Section I).
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Tier 1 (Base Salt + Password):**  Standard PBKDF2 or Argon2 to generate an initial derived key.
    2.  **Tier 2 (Dynamic Salt + Derived Key):**  Another round of PBKDF2/Argon2, incorporating the dynamic salt and the output from Tier 1. This adds an extra layer of obfuscation.
    3.  **Tier 3 (Entropy-Weighted Key):** The final derived key is created by XORing the Tier 2 key with a pseudorandom value. The pseudorandom value is generated using the Entropy Score as a seed.  Higher entropy = more randomness in the seed, making the final key significantly harder to predict.

**III. Dynamic Salt Generation:**

*   **Base Salt Storage:** The initial, randomly generated salt is securely stored.
*   **Salt Rotation Trigger:**  A salt rotation is triggered under the following conditions:
    *   Authentication attempt fails.
    *   Entropy Score exceeds a threshold (e.g., 0.7).
    *   Periodic rotation (e.g., every 24 hours) – as a baseline.
*   **Salt Generation:** A new dynamic salt is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG).  The CSRNG is seeded with the Base Salt *and* a timestamp to prevent replay attacks.

**IV. System Architecture:**

1.  **Client:** Captures keystroke dynamics and sends it securely to the Authentication Server.
2.  **Authentication Server:**
    *   Receives login request and client data.
    *   Runs Entropy Prediction Module.
    *   Determines if salt rotation is necessary.
    *   Generates/Retrieves salt.
    *   Executes TKDF.
    *   Compares generated hash with stored hash.
3.  **Data Store:** Stores:
    *   Base Salt.
    *   Customer Password Hash (generated with the initial Base Salt).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function authenticate(username, password, clientData):
  entropyScore = predictEntropy(clientData)
  baseSalt = retrieveBaseSalt(username)

  if entropyScore > threshold or requiresRotation():
    dynamicSalt = generateDynamicSalt(baseSalt)
    storeDynamicSalt(username, dynamicSalt)
  else:
    dynamicSalt = retrieveDynamicSalt(username)

  derivedKeyTier1 = PBKDF2(password, baseSalt)
  derivedKeyTier2 = PBKDF2(derivedKeyTier1, dynamicSalt)
  randomSeed = generateRandomSeed(entropyScore)
  finalKey = XOR(derivedKeyTier2, randomSeed)

  storedHash = retrieveStoredHash(username)

  if hash(finalKey) == storedHash:
    return "Authentication Successful"
  else:
    return "Authentication Failed"
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   Keystroke dynamics data must be transmitted securely (e.g., over TLS).
*   The Entropy Prediction Module should be regularly updated to adapt to evolving attack patterns.
*   The pseudorandom number generator used for the random seed must be cryptographically secure.
*   Dynamic salt storage must be protected against unauthorized access.
