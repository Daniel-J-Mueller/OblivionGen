## Dynamic Contextual List Expansion via Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the “flipping list” paradigm beyond simple shopping carts or wishlists to a dynamic contextual expansion of information, coupled with haptic feedback to guide user interaction and discovery.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Functionality – The “Orb”:**

*   **Visual Representation:** Instead of a standard list “flip,” the interface presents a spherical “Orb” element. The Orb visually represents the current context (e.g., a product page, a search result, an article).
*   **Orb State:** Initially, the Orb displays a summarized view of the current context (e.g., product image, title, key stats).
*   **Haptic Trigger:** A gentle pulsing haptic feedback signals the Orb is interactive.

**2. Expanding the Orb – Contextual Layers:**

*   **Gesture-Based Expansion:** A short, firm “push” gesture (detectable via touchscreen or dedicated pressure sensor) on the Orb causes it to “bloom” outwards, revealing a contextual layer.
*   **Contextual Layers Defined:**
    *   **Layer 1 – Related Items:**  Displays a carousel of related products, user recommendations, or items frequently purchased together.
    *   **Layer 2 – Deep Dive:** Provides access to detailed product specifications, reviews, comparison charts, and user-generated content.
    *   **Layer 3 – Community & Social:** Links to relevant forums, social media discussions, or user groups related to the current item.
*   **Haptic Guidance:** As the user “swipes” or “rotates” around the expanding Orb, different sections of the contextual layers provide subtle haptic feedback. Stronger vibrations indicate focus, while lighter taps signal available options.

**3. The ‘Ripple’ and ‘Collapse’ Effect:**

*   **Ripple Activation:** When the user selects an item *within* a contextual layer (e.g., a related product), a ‘ripple’ effect visually propagates outwards from that selection.
*   **Orb Collapse/Transition:** This ripple causes the Orb to dynamically re-configure, transitioning to a new summarized view focused on the selected item.  The transition is smooth and visually engaging.
*   **Gesture-Based Collapse:** A reverse “push” gesture will quickly collapse the Orb back to its original summarized view.

**4. Adaptive Haptic Patterns:**

*   **AI-Driven Adaptation:** The system utilizes AI to learn user preferences and adapt the haptic feedback patterns accordingly.
*   **Personalized Exploration:** Users can customize the intensity, frequency, and type of haptic feedback to create a personalized exploration experience.
*   **Accessibility Mode:**  A simplified haptic mode with clear, consistent patterns will improve accessibility for users with visual impairments.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Orb Object
class Orb {
  state: "collapsed" | "layer1" | "layer2" | "layer3"
  currentContext: Object // Data representing the item/page
  hapticEngine: HapticEngine

  constructor(context) {
    this.currentContext = context
    this.state = "collapsed"
    this.hapticEngine = new HapticEngine()
  }

  expand() {
    if (this.state === "collapsed") {
      this.state = "layer1"
      // Render Layer 1 content
      this.hapticEngine.pulse(intensity: 0.5, duration: 100)
    } else if (this.state === "layer1") {
      this.state = "layer2"
      // Render Layer 2 content
      this.hapticEngine.pulse(intensity: 0.7, duration: 150)
    }
    // ... continue for Layer 3
  }

  collapse() {
    this.state = "collapsed"
    // Render initial summarized view
  }

  // Handle user selection within layers
  onItemSelected(item) {
    // Update currentContext to reflect selected item
    // Trigger ripple animation
    // Transition Orb to new state
  }
}

// HapticEngine Class (Simplified)
class HapticEngine {
  pulse(intensity, duration) {
    // Send haptic feedback signal to device
  }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   E-commerce product exploration
*   News article summarization and related content discovery
*   Travel planning (exploring destinations, attractions, and accommodations)
*   Educational platforms (deep diving into complex topics)
