## Adaptive Spatial Audio Cancellation & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend feedback suppression beyond frequency-band attenuation to encompass spatial audio cancellation and reconstruction. Rather than simply *reducing* problematic frequencies, actively *cancel* feedback originating from specific spatial locations and reconstruct the missing audio information.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Requirements:**

*   **Multi-Microphone Array:** A minimum of four microphones arranged in a tetrahedral configuration, capable of capturing spatial audio data. Higher microphone counts (8, 16, or more) improve spatial resolution.
*   **High-Performance Processor:** Capable of real-time spatial audio processing and beamforming.
*   **Dedicated DSP:** (Optional) Offload spatial processing tasks from the main processor.
*   **Speaker Array:** (Optional) Facilitate audio reconstruction/replacement. Could be integrated into the device or utilize external speakers.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Spatial Localization Module:**  Utilizes Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) or beamforming techniques to pinpoint the origin of feedback within the audio capture space. Algorithm must be robust to noise and reverberation.
*   **Feedback Signature Analysis:** Identifies the specific spectral characteristics of the feedback signal emanating from the localized source.
*   **Spatial Cancellation Filter:** Dynamically generates a spatial filter that nullifies the feedback signal at its source. This filter is applied to the captured audio stream.  Adaptive filter coefficients adjust based on real-time feedback analysis.
*   **Audio Reconstruction Engine:**  When feedback is aggressively canceled, the affected audio content is lost. The Reconstruction Engine attempts to intelligently fill these gaps using contextual audio information (from neighboring frequencies, preceding audio segments, etc.).  Could leverage machine learning models to predict missing audio data.
*   **Beamforming Module:** Utilizes microphone array data to focus on desired sound sources and suppress unwanted noise and feedback.  Dynamically adjusts beamforming parameters based on spatial localization and feedback analysis.
*   **Gain Control Module:** Traditional frequency-band gain control operates in parallel with the spatial cancellation system for robust feedback suppression.
*   **Spatial Audio Renderer:** (If speaker array is present)  Renders reconstructed or modified audio signals to the speaker array, effectively creating a localized audio 'bubble'.

**3. Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
initialize Microphone Array
initialize Spatial Localization Module
initialize Feedback Signature Analysis Module
initialize Spatial Cancellation Filter
initialize Audio Reconstruction Engine

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    capture Audio Data from Microphone Array
    
    // Spatial Localization
    feedbackSource = Spatial Localization Module.localizeFeedback(Audio Data)
    
    // Feedback Analysis
    feedbackSignature = Feedback Signature Analysis Module.analyze(Audio Data, feedbackSource)
    
    // Spatial Cancellation
    filteredAudio = Spatial Cancellation Filter.cancelFeedback(Audio Data, feedbackSignature, feedbackSource)
    
    // Audio Reconstruction
    reconstructedAudio = Audio Reconstruction Engine.reconstructLostAudio(filteredAudio, feedbackSignature)
    
    // Beamforming
    beamformedAudio = Beamforming Module.applyBeamforming(reconstructedAudio)

    // Gain Control
    finalAudio = Gain Control Module.applyGainControl(beamformedAudio)
    
    output finalAudio to Speaker/Headphones
}
```

**4. Operational Modes:**

*   **Standard Mode:** Combines frequency-band gain control with spatial cancellation and reconstruction.
*   **Spatial-Only Mode:**  De-emphasizes frequency-band gain control and relies primarily on spatial cancellation for minimal audio distortion.
*   **Reconstruction-Focused Mode:**  Prioritizes audio reconstruction over aggressive feedback suppression, trading off some level of feedback for improved audio clarity.

**5. Potential Applications:**

*   Live sound reinforcement (concerts, conferences)
*   Teleconferencing systems
*   Hearing aids and assistive listening devices
*   Virtual and augmented reality environments
*   Automotive audio systems
