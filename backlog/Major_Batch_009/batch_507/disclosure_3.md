## User-Specific Ambient Contextual Messaging

**Concept:** Expand upon the user device polling to incorporate ambient contextual data *from* the device to proactively tailor message delivery *beyond* simply which device to send it to. This goes beyond interaction scores and aims for anticipatory messaging.

**Specs:**

**1. Ambient Data Collection Module (ADC):**

*   **Function:** Continuously (or at configurable intervals) collects ambient data from the user device.
*   **Data Points:**
    *   **Motion Data:** Accelerometer, gyroscope data to determine user activity (stationary, walking, running, in a vehicle).
    *   **Audio Input:** Analyze ambient audio for keywords/categories (e.g., meeting, music, silence, traffic) – processed *locally* for privacy.
    *   **Location Data:** Fine-grained location (with user permission) for context (home, work, gym, traveling).
    *   **Environmental Sensors:** If available on the device (temperature, humidity, light levels).
    *   **Connected Device State:** Identify connected devices (Bluetooth headphones, smart watch, car infotainment) – indicating current activity.
*   **Privacy:** All data is anonymized and processed locally whenever possible. User has granular control over which data points are collected.

**2. Contextual Inference Engine (CIE):**

*   **Function:** Processes the ambient data from the ADC to infer the user’s current context.
*   **Algorithm:** A hybrid rules-based and machine learning approach:
    *   **Rules-Based:** Defines basic contextual states based on data point combinations (e.g., "Walking + Headphones = Commuting").
    *   **ML Model:** Trained on user data to predict contextual states with higher accuracy.
*   **Output:** A contextual state string (e.g., “Commuting”, “In Meeting”, “Relaxing at Home”, “Driving”, “Exercising”).

**3. Message Prioritization & Delivery Module (MPDM):**

*   **Function:**  Combines the interaction scores from the original patent with the new contextual information to determine message priority and optimal delivery method.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Score Calculation:**  `Final Priority = (Interaction Score * Weight_Interaction) + (Contextual Relevance Score * Weight_Context)`
    *   **Contextual Relevance Score:** Based on how well the message content aligns with the inferred user context. (e.g., a work-related message has high relevance during "Commuting" or "In Office" but low relevance during "Exercising").
    *   **Delivery Method:**  Determines the most appropriate delivery method based on the Final Priority and context. Options:
        *   **Push Notification (High Priority):** Immediate delivery.
        *   **Summarized Digest (Medium Priority):**  Bundle multiple messages into a digest delivered at a less disruptive time.
        *   **Delayed Delivery (Low Priority):** Deliver the message when the user is predicted to be in a more receptive state.
        *   **Ambient Display (Low Priority/Informational):** Display a non-intrusive notification on a smartwatch or ambient display.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// ADC collects ambient data (motion, audio, location, etc.)
ambientData = ADC.getData()

// CIE infers user context
context = CIE.inferContext(ambientData)

// MPDM determines message priority
priority = calculatePriority(interactionScore, context, messageContent)

// Determine delivery method
deliveryMethod = determineDeliveryMethod(priority, context)

// Send message
sendMessage(messageContent, deliveryMethod)
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond simply *where* to send a message to *how* and *when*, leveraging a richer understanding of the user’s current situation. The system anticipates user needs and delivers information in a way that minimizes disruption and maximizes relevance.
