## Dynamic Data Masking Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specifications:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Behavioral Biometrics Module (BBM) - Integrated within the client application.
    *   Dynamic Masking Service (DMS) - Server-side component interacting with database systems.
    *   Access Control Layer (ACL) - Existing security infrastructure, modified to integrate with DMS.
*   **Data Collection (BBM):**
    *   Keystroke dynamics (typing speed, rhythm, pressure).
    *   Mouse movements (speed, acceleration, patterns, click locations).
    *   Scroll behavior (speed, patterns).
    *   Application usage patterns (features accessed, time spent on each, sequence of actions).
*   **Biometric Profile Generation (BBM):**
    *   Initial learning phase: Collects data over a defined period (e.g., 1 week) to establish a baseline behavioral profile for each user.
    *   Continuous adaptation:  Constantly updates the profile based on ongoing user behavior.
    *   Profile storage: Encrypted and securely stored on the server.
*   **Real-time Authentication & Risk Assessment (BBM):**
    *   Continuous monitoring of user behavior.
    *   Deviation scoring:  Calculates a score based on the difference between current behavior and the established profile.
    *   Risk level assignment: Assigns a risk level (Low, Medium, High) based on the deviation score.
*   **Dynamic Masking Implementation (DMS):**
    *   Integration with database queries: Intercepts database queries originating from the client application.
    *   Data Sensitivity Classification: Database schemas are pre-defined with sensitivity levels for each field (e.g., Public, Internal, Confidential, Highly Confidential).
    *   Masking Rules:
        *   Based on risk level AND data sensitivity.
        *   Risk Level = Low: No masking.
        *   Risk Level = Medium: Partial masking (e.g., replace middle digits of credit card numbers with ‘X’, truncate long strings).
        *   Risk Level = High: Full masking (e.g., replace all characters with ‘X’), or data redaction.
        *   Dynamic Masking Policies: Defined via a rules engine allowing administrators to customize masking behavior based on specific data fields, user roles, and risk levels.
    *   Masked Data Delivery: Returns the masked data to the client application.
*   **Access Control Integration (ACL):**
    *   ACL integrates with DMS to consider behavioral risk score in access control decisions.
    *   Adaptive Access Policies: ACL dynamically adjusts access privileges based on behavioral risk.
    *   Alerting:  High-risk events trigger alerts to security administrators.

**Pseudocode (DMS):**

```
function processQuery(query, user_id, behavioral_risk_score):
  // Retrieve data sensitivity levels for fields in query
  sensitivity_levels = getDataSensitivityLevels(query)

  // Apply masking based on risk score and sensitivity levels
  for each field in sensitivity_levels:
    if behavioral_risk_score > threshold_medium AND field.sensitivity == "Confidential":
      masked_data = applyPartialMasking(field.data)
    elif behavioral_risk_score > threshold_high AND field.sensitivity == "Highly Confidential":
      masked_data = applyFullMasking(field.data)
    else:
      masked_data = field.data

  // Return masked data
  return masked_data
```

**Innovation Details:**

This system shifts from static data masking to dynamic masking. Current masking techniques primarily focus on role-based access control. This specification introduces behavioral biometrics as an additional layer of authentication and risk assessment. By continuously monitoring user behavior, the system can adapt data masking policies in real-time, providing a more granular and responsive security solution. This mitigates insider threats and compromised accounts. The system isn’t about *preventing* access, but dynamically adjusting the *visibility* of data based on authenticated user behavior. This is especially valuable in environments where users require access to sensitive data but may present a heightened risk due to unusual activity.
