## Automated Network 'Health' Verification & Dynamic Access Control

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple authentication to continuous network 'health' verification of the customer’s network *before* and *during* service access. Leverage this data for dynamic access control – automatically adjusting service levels or entirely blocking access based on detected network anomalies.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component 1: Customer Network Probe (CNP)**: A lightweight software agent deployed *within* the customer's network (with consent, of course). This isn’t a full-blown security appliance. It's designed to passively monitor key network health indicators.
    *   Data Points: Latency to key internet endpoints (e.g., DNS servers, CDN nodes), Packet Loss (ICMP-based, limited scope to avoid DoS), Jitter, DNS resolution times, basic TCP connection success rates, and – critically – detection of known malicious IP addresses via a continuously updated threat feed.
    *   Communication: Secure TLS connection to a dedicated 'Health Monitoring Service' within the Provider Network.  Data is aggregated and transmitted at configurable intervals (e.g., every 5-15 minutes).
*   **Component 2: Health Monitoring Service (HMS)**:  A centralized service within the Provider Network responsible for receiving, analyzing, and acting upon data from CNPs.
    *   Analysis:  Applies configurable thresholds to received data.  Utilizes anomaly detection algorithms (e.g., moving averages, standard deviations) to identify deviations from baseline network behavior.  Correlation of multiple metrics.
    *   Actionable Intelligence: Generates a ‘Network Health Score’ for each customer.  This score is dynamic and reflects the current state of their network.  Score is categorized (e.g., Excellent, Good, Warning, Critical).
*   **Component 3: Dynamic Access Control Module (DACM)**: Integrates with the existing authentication system and network infrastructure.
    *   Integration with Authentication:  Upon initial authentication, the DACM retrieves the customer’s Network Health Score.
    *   Dynamic Policy Enforcement:
        *   Excellent/Good: Full access to provisioned services.
        *   Warning: Reduced bandwidth allocation.  Prioritization of critical services.  Warning message displayed to the customer.
        *   Critical: Service access blocked.  Automated notification to the customer and support team.  Detailed logs generated for investigation.
    *   Automated Remediation (Optional): Trigger automated scripts to attempt basic network troubleshooting (e.g., ping, traceroute) and report results.

**Pseudocode (DACM):**

```
function handleAuthenticationRequest(customerID):
  healthScore = getNetworkHealthScore(customerID)

  if healthScore == "Excellent" or healthScore == "Good":
    grantFullAccess(customerID)
  else if healthScore == "Warning":
    limitBandwidth(customerID)
    prioritizeCriticalServices(customerID)
    displayWarningMessage(customerID)
  else if healthScore == "Critical":
    blockAccess(customerID)
    sendNotification(customerID)
    logEvent("Access Blocked - Critical Network Health")
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus primarily on authenticating *who* the customer is. This expands to verifying the *health* of their network *before* and *during* service access, creating a more resilient and secure infrastructure. The dynamic access control component is key - proactively mitigating risks and improving the overall customer experience.
