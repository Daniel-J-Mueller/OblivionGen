## Adaptive Transaction Prioritization & Predictive Shutdown

**System Overview:** A distributed system component designed to dynamically prioritize transactions based on predicted device shutdown or reboot events. This moves beyond simply completing outstanding transactions *during* shutdown; it proactively adjusts transaction flow *before* shutdown is initiated, minimizing data loss and maximizing system stability.

**Core Innovation:** The patent focuses on graceful shutdown. We’re pushing into *predictive* shutdown handling – anticipating the need for shutdown and adjusting the system *before* the request is even made.  This is achieved by integrating predictive models with transaction prioritization.

**Components:**

*   **Predictive Model Engine (PME):**  Utilizes machine learning models (trained on device health metrics, workload analysis, scheduled maintenance, etc.) to predict potential device shutdowns or reboots.  Outputs a “Shutdown Probability Score” (SPS) for each device.
*   **Transaction Prioritization Manager (TPM):**  Receives the SPS from the PME.  Dynamically adjusts transaction priorities based on the SPS. Transactions targeting devices with high SPS are given higher priority (and potentially replicated across devices with lower SPS).
*   **Adaptive Routing Module (ARM):** Modifies transaction routing based on TPM instructions. Can redirect transactions, replicate data, or delay non-critical operations.
*   **Health Monitoring Agent (HMA):** Continuously monitors device health metrics (CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, network latency, error rates) and feeds data to the PME.
*   **Interconnect Fabric Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with existing AXI or similar interconnect fabrics.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Data Collection:** HMAs collect device health metrics.
2.  **Prediction:** PME analyzes metrics and generates an SPS for each device.
3.  **Prioritization:** TPM receives SPS and adjusts transaction priorities accordingly.
4.  **Routing:** ARM modifies transaction routing based on TPM instructions.
5.  **Shutdown/Reboot:** When a shutdown or reboot is initiated, outstanding transactions are minimized, and data integrity is maximized.

**Pseudocode (TPM Logic):**

```pseudocode
function prioritizeTransactions(deviceSPS, transactionList):
    # transactionList is a list of transactions. Each transaction contains a priority value
    # deviceSPS is the shutdown probability score for the target device of the transactions

    for each transaction in transactionList:
        if transaction.priority < deviceSPS * 10:  # Scale SPS for effect
            transaction.priority = deviceSPS * 10
        end if
    end for

    # Sort transactionList by priority (highest first)
    transactionList.sort(key=lambda x: x.priority, reverse=True)

    return transactionList
end function
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Dedicated FPGA or ASIC implementation for low-latency operation.
*   **Software:** Machine learning models implemented in Python/TensorFlow/PyTorch. Control logic in C/C++.
*   **Communication:** AXI or similar interconnect fabric. Dedicated control channel for priority updates.
*   **Scalability:** Support for thousands of devices. Distributed architecture for fault tolerance.
*   **Model Training:** Continuous learning based on historical data and real-time feedback.

**Novelty:**  This isn't just about *handling* shutdowns gracefully. It's about *anticipating* them and preemptively adjusting system behavior to minimize disruption and maximize data protection. The integration of predictive modeling with transaction prioritization is a significant advancement. It moves beyond reactive shutdown handling towards proactive system resilience.
