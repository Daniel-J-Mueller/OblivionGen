## Dynamic Phase-Shifted Redundancy with Predictive Load Balancing

**Concept:** Extend the 'hot-swap' power feed concept by incorporating dynamic phase shifting *within* the redundant power feeds *before* they reach the load. This allows for predictive load balancing and mitigates transient spikes by proactively distributing load across phases, even *before* a failure or overload is detected.

**Specs:**

*   **System Architecture:** Modular, distributed power delivery system. Each power feed (input lines) connects to a 'Phase Shifter Module' (PSM) before reaching the Power Distribution Unit (PDU). Multiple PSMs connect to a single PDU, forming a redundant, dynamically balanced power network.
*   **Phase Shifter Module (PSM):**
    *   **Input:** Three-phase AC power.
    *   **Output:** Three-phase AC power with dynamically adjustable phase angles (0-360 degrees per phase).
    *   **Components:**
        *   High-speed digital signal processors (DSPs).
        *   Solid-state AC voltage controllers (Triacs or IGBT-based) for precise phase angle control.
        *   Current sensors (high bandwidth, high accuracy).
        *   Voltage sensors.
        *   Communication interface (Ethernet/TCP/IP) for system control and monitoring.
*   **Predictive Load Balancing Algorithm (Implemented on DSPs within PSMs):**
    *   **Data Input:** Real-time current and voltage measurements from each phase of each power feed. Historical load data. Predicted load changes (based on system logs, scheduled tasks, or AI-driven prediction models).
    *   **Algorithm:**
        1.  Calculate instantaneous power consumption on each phase.
        2.  Compare current load to historical patterns and predicted changes.
        3.  Proactively adjust phase angles on individual PSMs to redistribute load across phases, aiming for balanced power consumption and minimized harmonic distortion.
        4.  Prioritize phase shifting to phases with available capacity.
        5.  Implement a ‘soft-start’ feature to avoid transient spikes during phase adjustments.
        6.  Algorithm runs in background, constantly optimizing phase angles.
*   **Communication Network:**
    *   High-speed Ethernet network connecting all PSMs and the central monitoring system.
    *   Communication protocol: Modbus TCP/IP or similar industrial protocol.
    *   Central monitoring system: Displays real-time power consumption, phase angles, and system status.
*   **Integration with PDU:** The PDU remains largely unchanged. It receives power from multiple PSMs, providing inherent redundancy. The PSMs handle the dynamic load balancing before the power reaches the PDU.
*   **Failure Handling:** In case of a PSM failure, the PDU automatically switches to the remaining PSMs, maintaining power delivery. The algorithm will adapt to the new configuration to redistribute the load across the remaining active PSMs.
*   **Pseudocode for Phase Adjustment (Simplified):**

```
// Input: Current power consumption on each phase (P1, P2, P3)
//        Target power consumption per phase (PT)
//        Phase angle adjustment step size (step)

function adjustPhaseAngles(P1, P2, P3, PT, step) {
    // Calculate power imbalances
    imbalance1 = P1 - PT
    imbalance2 = P2 - PT
    imbalance3 = P3 - PT

    // Identify phase with highest imbalance
    if (abs(imbalance1) > abs(imbalance2) && abs(imbalance1) > abs(imbalance3)) {
        // Adjust phase angle of phase 1
        if (imbalance1 > 0) {
            // Reduce phase angle (delay current)
            phaseAngle1 = phaseAngle1 - step
        } else {
            // Increase phase angle (advance current)
            phaseAngle1 = phaseAngle1 + step
        }
    } else if (abs(imbalance2) > abs(imbalance1) && abs(imbalance2) > abs(imbalance3)) {
        // Adjust phase angle of phase 2
        // ... similar logic as above
    } else {
        // Adjust phase angle of phase 3
        // ... similar logic as above
    }
}
```

**Novelty:** This system goes beyond simple redundancy and introduces *proactive* load balancing by dynamically adjusting phase angles before imbalances or failures occur. This can reduce stress on power components, improve energy efficiency, and enhance system reliability. Furthermore, it offers a flexible and scalable solution for managing power distribution in demanding environments.
