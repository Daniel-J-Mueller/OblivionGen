## Predictive Crash Memory Allocation & Dynamic Partitioning

**Concept:** Instead of reserving a fixed crash memory area during boot, dynamically allocate and partition memory based on predicted system load and potential failure points *during* runtime. This allocation is guided by a real-time analysis of system metrics and machine learning models.

**Specs:**

1.  **Real-Time System Monitoring Agent:** A lightweight agent running in the kernel collects metrics like CPU utilization per core, memory pressure, disk I/O, network traffic, temperature readings from various sensors, and frequency of exceptions/interrupts.
2.  **Failure Prediction Model:** A machine learning model (trained offline on historical system data and failure logs) predicts the probability of failure for different system components (CPU, memory, disk, network). This model is updated periodically with new data.
3.  **Dynamic Memory Allocator:** A specialized allocator that can reserve and release memory regions on demand.  It utilizes a combination of buddy allocation and slab allocation to efficiently manage memory fragments.
4.  **Crash Memory Partitioning Scheme:**  Memory is partitioned into 'slices' of varying sizes, assigned to specific components based on failure probability.
    *   High probability = larger slice.
    *   Slices are contiguous to improve DMA performance.
    *   Each slice has metadata indicating the component it serves.
5.  **Crash Data Structuring:** Crash data is structured into modular 'event records'. Each record captures a specific type of error (e.g., page fault, invalid opcode, thermal shutdown). Event records contain relevant register states, memory snapshots, and diagnostic information.
6.  **Selective Data Capture:** Based on the detected error type, only the relevant event records are populated, minimizing memory overhead.
7.  **Alert Mechanism:** Upon error detection, the system triggers an alert and initiates data capture to the allocated crash memory.  A dedicated hardware interrupt signals the BMC.
8.  **BMC Integration:**  The BMC uses DMA to read the crash memory region.  Metadata within the crash memory allows the BMC to identify the failed component and the type of error.
9.  **Adaptive Allocation:** The system continuously monitors system load and adjusts the size of each crash memory partition.  Unused memory can be reclaimed and reallocated to other components.
10. **Configuration Parameters:**
    *   `allocation_frequency`: How often the system re-evaluates and adjusts crash memory allocations (in seconds).
    *   `minimum_partition_size`: The minimum size of a crash memory partition (in bytes).
    *   `maximum_partition_size`: The maximum size of a crash memory partition (in bytes).
    *   `failure_prediction_model_path`: Path to the trained machine learning model.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Memory Allocation):**

```
// System Boot
Load Failure Prediction Model

// Runtime Monitoring Loop
while (System Running) {
  Collect System Metrics
  Predict Failure Probabilities for Each Component
  Calculate Required Crash Memory Size for Each Component
  Adjust Crash Memory Partition Sizes Based on Predicted Sizes
  Reallocate Memory Using Dynamic Memory Allocator
  Sleep(allocation_frequency)
}

// Error Handling
On Error Detected {
  Identify Failed Component
  Capture Relevant Crash Data to Allocated Partition
  Trigger Alert to BMC
}
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   DMA controller capable of high-speed transfers to the BMC.
*   Hardware performance counters for accurate system metric collection.
*   Dedicated memory region for the dynamic memory allocator.
