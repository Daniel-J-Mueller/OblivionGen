## Dynamic Code Mutation via Probabilistic Execution

**Concept:** Expand upon the dynamic function switching by introducing probabilistic execution paths *within* functions, not just around them. This allows for A/B testing of code changes in production *without* requiring full deployments, and enables resilience against subtly malicious code injection.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A runtime code mutation engine. This engine operates on compiled bytecode or intermediate representation (IR) of functions.
*   **Mutation Primitives:** A library of mutation operations including:
    *   Arithmetic operation swaps (e.g., `+` becomes `*`).
    *   Conditional branch inversions (e.g., `if (x > 0)` becomes `if (x <= 0)`).
    *   Variable substitution (replacing one variable with another of compatible type).
    *   Dead code insertion/removal.
    *   Instruction reordering (within safe limits).
*   **Control Data Expansion:** The existing control data system is extended. Each mutation primitive is assigned a unique identifier. Control data now includes a probability value (0.0 to 1.0) *per mutation primitive*.
*   **Runtime Operation:** During function execution:
    1.  Before each instruction, the runtime checks if a mutation primitive applies to that instruction.
    2.  If a primitive applies, a random number is generated.
    3.  If the random number is less than the probability associated with that primitive, the mutation is applied *in place*. The original instruction is overwritten with the mutated instruction.
    4.  Execution continues with the mutated code.
*   **Telemetry & A/B Testing:** The runtime collects telemetry on which mutations are applied, their execution time, and any errors encountered. This data is used for A/B testing different code variations in production.
*   **Security Feature â€“ Mutation Rate Limiting:** A global mutation rate limit can be set. If an unexpected surge in mutations occurs (potentially indicating an attack), the system can throttle or disable mutations.
*   **Metadata Integration:** The compiler adds metadata to the compiled code indicating which instructions are susceptible to mutation, and the associated metadata IDs.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Mutation Application):**

```
function execute_instruction(instruction):
  metadata = get_instruction_metadata(instruction)
  if metadata != null:
    mutation_id = metadata.mutation_id
    probability = get_mutation_probability(mutation_id) // From control data
    random_value = generate_random_number(0.0, 1.0)
    if random_value < probability:
      mutated_instruction = apply_mutation(instruction, mutation_id)
      execute_instruction(mutated_instruction) // Recursive call with mutated instruction
    else:
      execute_instruction(instruction) // Execute original instruction
  else:
    execute_instruction(instruction) // Execute original instruction (no mutation possible)
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Continuous A/B Testing:** Automatically test code variations in production without requiring full deployments.
*   **Resilience to Code Injection:** Subtle malicious code injected into a function may be mutated into harmless or detectable code.
*   **Performance Optimization:** Experiment with different code optimizations in real-time to find the best performing version.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Mutations can create slightly different execution paths that may bypass faulty code.
