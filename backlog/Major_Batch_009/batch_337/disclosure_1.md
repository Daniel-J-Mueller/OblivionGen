**Dynamic Policy Grafting for Multi-Tenant Resource Access**

**Concept:** Extend the existing authentication/authorization framework to support *dynamic* policy modification based on real-time contextual data *after* initial authentication. This moves beyond static policies associated with a caller and allows for granular access control based on factors like resource load, time of day, geographical location, or detected threat levels.

**Specifications:**

*   **Component:** Policy Grafting Engine (PGE). This engine exists *between* the request management service and the customer service endpoint. It receives the authenticated request *and* real-time contextual data.
*   **Contextual Data Sources:** Configurable integration with external data sources:
    *   Resource Monitoring: CPU, memory, network bandwidth utilization of underlying resources.
    *   Geolocation: IP address-based location data.
    *   Threat Intelligence Feeds: Integration with external threat intelligence APIs.
    *   Time-Based Rules: Ability to define policies based on time of day/week.
    *   Customer-Defined Metrics: Ability for customers to inject custom metrics influencing policy.
*   **Policy Grafting Logic:** PGE uses a rule engine (e.g., Drools, easy-rules) to evaluate the contextual data against a set of “graft” rules. These rules determine whether to *modify* the authorization context before forwarding the request.
*   **Graft Actions:**
    *   **Attribute Injection:** Add/modify attributes in the authorization context (e.g., `resource_priority=high`, `access_limited=true`).
    *   **Permission Modification:** Add/remove specific permissions.
    *   **Request Redirection:** Route the request to a different instance or endpoint.
    *   **Request Throttling:** Limit the request rate.
    *   **Request Blocking:** Deny the request.
*   **Policy Updates:** Support for dynamic policy updates without requiring service restarts. PGE should monitor a configuration store (e.g., etcd, Consul) for policy changes.
*   **Auditing:** Log all policy grafting actions, including the contextual data used, the graft rules applied, and the resulting authorization context changes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// PGE receives authenticated request and contextual data
request = ReceiveRequest()
context = GatherContextualData()

// Evaluate graft rules
graftRules = LoadGraftRules()
modifiedContext = EvaluateRules(context, graftRules)

// Apply modifications to authorization context
request.authorizationContext.Merge(modifiedContext)

// Log the action
LogGraftAction(request, modifiedContext)

// Forward the request
ForwardRequest(request)
```

**Example Graft Rule:**

“If resource CPU utilization exceeds 90% AND request is associated with a low-priority customer, THEN reduce request timeout to 1 second.”

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   PGE should be stateless and horizontally scalable.
*   Caching of contextual data and graft rules to reduce external dependencies.
*   Redundant PGE instances to ensure high availability.
