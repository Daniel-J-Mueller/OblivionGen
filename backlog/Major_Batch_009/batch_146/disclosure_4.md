## Dynamic Subpage Granularity & Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Extend the existing write endurance tracking to operate at a *dynamic* subpage level, coupled with a predictive migration system that anticipates write hotspots and proactively moves data to less-worn subpages *before* endurance limits are reached. This significantly surpasses simply tracking and ranking.

**Specs:**

*   **Granularity Control:** Implement a configurable subpage size. Initially, subpage size mirrors existing implementation. However, allow runtime adjustment based on workload analysis (see Predictive Analysis Module). Smaller subpages = finer tracking, larger = lower overhead.
*   **Predictive Analysis Module:** A dedicated hardware/software module monitors write patterns *at the application level* (requires integration with hypervisor/OS). Uses machine learning (specifically, time-series forecasting) to predict future write locations. Key metrics:
    *   Write frequency to virtual/physical memory blocks.
    *   Application-specific write patterns (e.g., log file appends, database updates).
    *   Time-based decay of write frequency.
*   **Migration Engine:** Based on Predictive Analysis Module's output, proactively migrates data from high-wear subpages to low-wear subpages *before* endurance thresholds are hit. Migration is done in the background.
*   **Write Interception:** Intercept write requests from applications. Before writing, the Migration Engine checks if the target subpage is nearing its endurance limit. If so, the data is written to a different, less-worn subpage, and metadata is updated to reflect the new location.
*   **Metadata Structure:** Extend the existing tracking table (or create a new one) to store:
    *   Subpage-level write counts.
    *   Subpage status (active, migrating, offline).
    *   Data relocation history (chain of subpages where the data has resided).
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Implement the Predictive Analysis Module and Migration Engine in hardware (FPGA or dedicated ASIC) for maximum performance and minimal overhead.
*   **Adaptive Learning:**  The Predictive Analysis Module continually learns from write patterns and adjusts its forecasting models to improve accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Migration Engine):**

```
function migrateData(virtualAddress, physicalAddress, subpageOffset, data):
  subpage = getSubpage(physicalAddress, subpageOffset)
  wearLevel = getWearLevel(subpage)

  if wearLevel > threshold:
    newSubpage = findLeastWornSubpage()
    copyData(data, subpage, newSubpage)
    updateMetadata(virtualAddress, newSubpage)
    markSubpageAsMigrating(subpage)
  else:
    writeData(data, subpage)
```

**Potential benefits:**

*   Prolonged storage device lifespan.
*   Reduced performance degradation due to wear leveling.
*   Improved application responsiveness.
*   Greater predictability of storage performance.
