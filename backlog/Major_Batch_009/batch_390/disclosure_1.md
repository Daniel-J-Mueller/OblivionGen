## Adaptive Spatial Index Granularity & Dynamic Tier Assignment

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on partitioning a spatial index. This design expands on that by introducing *dynamic* granularity for spatial index partitions *and* tying that to a fluid assignment of tiers within the distributed system. The aim is to optimize for both speed *and* resource utilization based on real-time data density and query patterns.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Density Mapping:** Implement a data density mapping function. This function analyzes incoming signal data (images, sensor readings, etc.) and assigns a ‘density score’ to different spatial regions. This score reflects the complexity of the data within that region (e.g., number of objects, feature richness).

*   **Granularity Profiles:** Define a set of granularity profiles (e.g., coarse, medium, fine). Each profile dictates the size and complexity of spatial index partitions. Coarse partitions cover larger areas with fewer data points; fine partitions are smaller and contain more detail.

*   **Dynamic Partition Adjustment:** A ‘Partition Manager’ module continuously monitors the density scores of spatial regions. Based on pre-defined thresholds (adjustable via programmatic interface), the Partition Manager dynamically adjusts the granularity of spatial index partitions. Regions with high density scores receive finer granularity partitions; low-density regions receive coarser partitions.

*   **Tier Assignment Heuristics:** Introduce a ‘Tier Assignment Engine’. This engine uses the granularity of spatial index partitions to determine the appropriate tier for processing.
    *   **Fine Granularity:**  Partitions with fine granularity are assigned to the camera-proximity tier for immediate processing. This minimizes latency for complex scenes.
    *   **Medium Granularity:** Medium granularity partitions are assigned to an intermediary tier for moderate processing requirements.
    *   **Coarse Granularity:** Coarse granularity partitions are assigned to the back-end analytics tier for resource-intensive analysis.

*   **Tier Fluidity:** Implement a mechanism for *dynamic* tier reassignment. If the density score of a spatial region changes significantly (e.g., due to object movement or scene changes), the corresponding partition can be reassigned to a different tier in real-time.  This requires a ‘Tier Migration Manager’ module.

*   **Inter-Tier Communication Protocol:** Enhance the existing programmatic interfaces to support the exchange of partition metadata (granularity, tier assignment) between tiers. This allows tiers to proactively request data from the appropriate source.

**Pseudocode (Tier Migration Manager):**

```
function migratePartition(partitionID, newTier):
  currentTier = getPartitionTier(partitionID)

  if currentTier != newTier:
    // Step 1: Signal other tier to stop processing this partition
    signalStop(currentTier, partitionID)

    // Step 2: Transfer partition data to new tier
    transferData(partitionID, currentTier, newTier)

    // Step 3: Update partition metadata with new tier
    updatePartitionTier(partitionID, newTier)

    // Step 4: Signal new tier to start processing
    signalStart(newTier, partitionID)

  end if
end function

// Monitor density changes and trigger migration
function monitorDensity(partitionID):
  densityScore = getDensityScore(partitionID)
  if densityScore > highDensityThreshold:
    migratePartition(partitionID, cameraProximityTier)
  else if densityScore < lowDensityThreshold:
    migratePartition(partitionID, analyticsTier)
  else:
    migratePartition(partitionID, intermediaryTier)
  end if
end function
```

**Programmatic Interface Extensions:**

*   `getPartitionDensity(partitionID)`: Returns the current density score for a given partition.
*   `setDensityThresholds(high, low)`: Allows programmatic adjustment of density thresholds.
*   `getPartitionTier(partitionID)`: Returns the current tier assigned to a partition.
*   `requestTierMigration(partitionID, targetTier)`:  Allows external requests for tier migration (e.g., for load balancing).
