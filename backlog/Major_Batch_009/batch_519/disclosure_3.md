**Personalized Live Stream "Rewind & Explore" System**

**Concept:** Extend the live stream experience beyond simple playback. Allow viewers to "rewind and explore" not just the video itself, but also associated data streams and viewer-generated content synchronized to the live event.

**Specs:**

1.  **Multi-Layer Manifest Generation:**  Instead of *just* video fragments, the media server generates manifests containing:
    *   Video Fragments (as per the base patent).
    *   Metadata Fragments: Timestamped data relating to the live event (e.g., player statistics, social media sentiment analysis, geographic viewer distribution, product placements triggered).
    *   Viewer Interaction Fragments: Aggregated, anonymized data regarding viewer interactions at specific times (e.g., most frequent questions asked in a live Q&A, commonly highlighted moments).
    *   Optional UGC Fragments:  If enabled, integrated viewer-submitted content (short video clips, images, comments) timestamped to the live event.

2.  **Client-Side Composition Engine:** The viewer device utilizes a composition engine to:
    *   Download fragments from the multi-layer manifests.
    *   Synchronize playback of all layers based on timestamps.
    *   Allow viewers to scrub through the stream *and* simultaneously explore the associated data layers.  (e.g., while watching a goal in a sports game, a user can instantly view aggregated social media reactions to that moment).

3.  **Interactive Timeline:**  A timeline visualization displays the live stream alongside key events from the data layers. This allows for non-linear exploration.  Events on the timeline are clickable to jump to that point in the stream and reveal associated data.

4.  **Personalized Data Streams:**  The system allows viewers to customize which data layers are displayed. (e.g., a sports fan might only want to see player statistics and social media reactions, while a marketer might focus on product placement data).

5.  **"Moment Highlighting" Engine:** A server-side AI engine automatically identifies and highlights "interesting moments" within the live stream based on a combination of video analysis (e.g., fast action, dramatic shifts) and data layer analysis (e.g., spikes in social media activity). These highlighted moments are visually indicated on the timeline.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side Composition Engine):**

```
function loadManifest(manifestURL) {
    fetch(manifestURL)
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(manifestData => {
            videoFragments = manifestData.videoFragments;
            metadataFragments = manifestData.metadataFragments;
            interactionFragments = manifestData.interactionFragments;
            // ... other fragment types

            initializePlayers(videoFragments);
            loadDataLayers(metadataFragments, interactionFragments, /*...*/);
        });
}

function initializePlayers(videoFragments) {
    // Create video player, load fragments, set up scrubbing
}

function loadDataLayers(metadataFragments, interactionFragments, /*...*/) {
    // Create data visualization components for each layer
    // Load fragments, synchronize with video player's current time
}

function onVideoScrub(currentTime) {
    // Find corresponding data fragments for currentTime
    // Update data visualization components with those fragments
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with VR/AR environments for immersive data exploration.
*   Real-time UGC integration (allowing viewers to contribute content during the live event).
*   AI-powered summarization of data layers (e.g., "During this minute, viewer sentiment towards player X was overwhelmingly positive.").
