## Autonomous Micro-Region Health & Remediation

**Concept:** Expand the micro-region concept beyond static latency-based grouping to a dynamically self-healing system that proactively addresses performance degradation *within* a micro-region. This goes beyond simply routing requests to healthy nodes; it introduces automated remediation and resource adjustment *before* user-facing impact.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1: Region Health Probes:** Each node within a micro-region (both customer-managed and provider-managed) will deploy lightweight "Health Probes". These aren’t simple ping tests. They execute a representative workload – a small subset of common requests – and measure end-to-end response time, error rates, and resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O). Probe frequency is adaptive, increasing during periods of high load or detected anomalies.
*   **Component 2: Distributed Anomaly Detection:** Probe data is fed into a distributed anomaly detection system (e.g., based on time-series forecasting algorithms, like Prophet or similar) running *within* the micro-region itself. This reduces reliance on centralized monitoring and provides faster response times. The system learns the baseline behavior of each node and flags deviations.
*   **Component 3: Automated Remediation Engine:** Upon anomaly detection, the Remediation Engine kicks in. Actions are prioritized based on severity and impact. Possible actions include:
    *   **Resource Scaling:** Dynamically adjust resources (CPU, memory) on the affected node.
    *   **Workload Shifting:** Temporarily redirect traffic from the affected node to healthier nodes within the micro-region. This leverages the micro-region’s distributed nature.
    *   **Self-Healing Scripts:** Execute pre-defined scripts on the affected node to address common issues (e.g., restarting a service, clearing caches).
    *   **Automated Rollback:** If a recent deployment is suspected, initiate an automated rollback to a previous known-good state.
*   **Component 4: Predictive Capacity Planning:** Aggregate historical performance data and utilize machine learning models to predict future capacity needs within the micro-region. This allows for proactive scaling *before* issues arise.
*   **Component 5: Micro-Region Governance & Policies:** Define policies governing automated remediation actions. For example:
    *   Maximum allowable resource scaling.
    *   Thresholds for triggering automated rollbacks.
    *   Notification requirements for critical events.

**Pseudocode (Remediation Engine):**

```
function handleAnomaly(node, anomalyType, severity) {
  if (severity == "critical") {
    // Attempt immediate mitigation
    if (anomalyType == "high_latency") {
      scaleResources(node, "cpu", 2x);
      shiftTraffic(node, 50%); // Shift 50% of traffic
    } else if (anomalyType == "high_error_rate") {
      restartService(node, "webserver");
    } else if (anomalyType == "resource_exhaustion") {
       scaleResources(node, "memory", 1.5x);
    }

    // Log event & notify operators
    logEvent(node, anomalyType, severity);
    sendNotification("Critical anomaly detected on " + node);

  } else if (severity == "warning") {
    // Implement less aggressive actions
    logEvent(node, anomalyType, severity);
    sendNotification("Warning anomaly detected on " + node);
  }
}
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Health Probes collect performance data.
2.  Data is streamed to the Distributed Anomaly Detection system.
3.  Anomaly Detection flags deviations from baseline.
4.  Remediation Engine takes automated actions.
5.  Events are logged and notifications are sent to operators.
6.  Historical data is used for Predictive Capacity Planning.
