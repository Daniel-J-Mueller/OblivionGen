## Automated Conflict Prediction & Resolution via Simulated Branch Merges

**Concept:** Proactively identify potential merge conflicts *before* they occur by simulating branch merges in a sandboxed environment. This moves conflict resolution from a reactive (after a pull request) to a proactive phase, significantly reducing development friction.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Simulation Engine:**

*   **Input:** Version control graph (as per the patent), branch definitions, commit history, and code base.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Identify branches slated for merge (either scheduled or predicted based on developer activity).
    2.  Create a sandboxed copy of the codebase at the common ancestor commit of the branches.
    3.  Apply commits from the target branch (the branch being merged *into*) sequentially onto the sandboxed copy.
    4.  Apply commits from the source branch (the branch being merged *from*) sequentially onto the sandboxed copy.
    5.  During commit application, the engine *actively* monitors for conflicts. Conflict detection uses standard version control algorithms.
    6.  If a conflict is detected, the engine *pauses* and records detailed information about the conflict:
        *   Files involved
        *   Lines of code in conflict
        *   Commits introducing the conflicting changes
        *   A 'conflict severity' score (based on the number of lines, complexity of changes, and potentially, the criticality of the affected code).
    7.  The engine attempts automated resolution of conflicts using configurable strategies (e.g., 'take ours', 'take theirs', custom resolution rules based on file type or code patterns).
    8.  If automated resolution fails, the engine flags the conflict for manual review.
*   **Output:** A ‘conflict prediction report’ detailing:
    *   List of predicted conflicts
    *   Conflict severity scores
    *   Details of each conflict (as described above)
    *   Status (resolved automatically or requires manual review)

**II. Integration with Issue Tracking System:**

*   Conflicts identified *before* a pull request is created automatically generate a new ‘pre-merge conflict’ issue in the issue tracking system.
*   The issue includes all the details from the conflict prediction report.
*   Assign the issue to the developers who authored the conflicting commits.
*   Allow developers to resolve conflicts *within* the issue tracking system (potentially through integration with a code editor).
*   Automatically close the issue when the conflict is resolved and the merge is confirmed.

**III. Predictive Conflict Analysis:**

*   Collect data on historical merge conflicts.
*   Train a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of conflicts based on:
    *   Developer activity patterns
    *   Code churn metrics
    *   Dependencies between code modules
    *   Commit message keywords
*   Use the model to proactively identify branches that are likely to experience conflicts.
*   Trigger the simulation engine *before* a merge is even attempted for high-risk branches.

**IV. Pseudocode (Core Simulation Engine):**

```pseudocode
function simulate_merge(base_commit, target_branch, source_branch):
  sandbox = clone_repository(base_commit)

  apply_commits(sandbox, get_commits(target_branch))

  for commit in get_commits(source_branch):
    try:
      apply_commit(sandbox, commit)
    except ConflictException as e:
      conflict_report = create_conflict_report(e)
      //Record the conflict with all related information
      record_conflict(conflict_report)
      //Attempt automated resolution
      resolution_result = attempt_auto_resolution(conflict_report)
      if resolution_result == FAILURE:
        //Flag for manual review
        flag_for_manual_review(conflict_report)
    end try
  end for

  return conflict_reports
end function

```

**V. Scalability & Performance Considerations:**

*   Employ parallel processing to simulate multiple merges concurrently.
*   Cache sandbox copies to reduce setup time.
*   Implement incremental conflict detection (only analyze changed files).
*   Provide configuration options to control the scope of the simulation (e.g., exclude certain branches or files).
