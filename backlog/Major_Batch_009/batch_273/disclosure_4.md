## Predictive QoS Shaping via Device Behavioral Profiling

**System Overview:** A system that proactively shapes SMS/MMS delivery Quality of Service (QoS) *before* transmission, based on learned behavioral profiles of mobile devices. This differs from the provided patent's reactive measurement of QoS *after* delivery.

**Core Concept:**  Recognize that not all messages *need* the same level of immediacy.  A device’s typical usage patterns (time of day, location, app usage) are predictive of the *importance* of incoming messages. This system dynamically adjusts transmission priority (and potentially message encoding) *before* sending, optimizing for perceived user need rather than simply aiming for the fastest possible delivery.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler:**  Runs on the mobile device. Collects anonymized usage data:
    *   Time of day
    *   Location (coarse-grained – e.g., home, work, transit)
    *   App usage frequency and categories (communication, gaming, utilities)
    *   Frequency of incoming SMS/MMS – baseline messaging activity.
    *   Device Motion – Stationary, Walking, Driving
2.  **Priority Prediction Engine:**  A server-side component.
    *   Receives behavioral profiles from devices.
    *   Uses machine learning models (trained on aggregated, anonymized data) to predict the *priority* of incoming messages.  Priority levels: Critical (immediate delivery), High, Normal, Low (delayed delivery).
3.  **QoS Shaper:**  Integrated within the notification service/SMS gateway.
    *   Receives the predicted priority from the Priority Prediction Engine.
    *   Dynamically adjusts transmission parameters:
        *   **Transmission Priority:**  Flags the message for preferential handling by carriers.
        *   **Message Encoding:**  For low-priority messages, reduce image/video quality or use text-only mode to reduce bandwidth usage.
        *   **Batching:** Delay transmission of low-priority messages and batch them with other low-priority messages.
        *   **Retry Strategy:** Aggressively retry critical messages.
4. **Feedback Loop:** The system tracks whether predicted priority aligns with user engagement (e.g., if a 'low' priority message is immediately opened, the model is adjusted).

**Pseudocode (QoS Shaper):**

```
FUNCTION shapeQoS(message, recipientID)
  priority = getPredictedPriority(recipientID)

  IF priority == "Critical" THEN
    message.transmissionPriority = "High"
    message.encoding = "Best"
    message.retryAttempts = 5
  ELSE IF priority == "High" THEN
    message.transmissionPriority = "Normal"
    message.encoding = "Good"
    message.retryAttempts = 3
  ELSE IF priority == "Normal" THEN
    message.transmissionPriority = "Normal"
    message.encoding = "Standard"
    message.retryAttempts = 2
  ELSE // priority == "Low"
    message.transmissionPriority = "Low"
    message.encoding = "TextOnly"
    message.retryAttempts = 1
    // Add to batching queue
    enqueueForBatching(message)

  END IF

  return message
END FUNCTION
```

**Data Model:**

*   **Device Profile:** `deviceID`, `timeOfDayPatterns`, `locationPatterns`, `appUsagePatterns`, `messagingFrequency`
*   **Priority Prediction Model:** (Machine Learning Model – parameters depend on chosen algorithm)
*   **Message:** `messageID`, `recipientID`, `content`, `transmissionPriority`, `encoding`, `retryAttempts`, `timestamp`

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved user experience by ensuring critical messages are delivered promptly.
*   Reduced bandwidth usage by intelligently encoding and delaying low-priority messages.
*   More efficient carrier network utilization.
*   Proactive QoS management – addresses potential issues *before* they impact users.
