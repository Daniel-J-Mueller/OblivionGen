## Decentralized Key Attestation with Bio-Signature Integration

**Concept:** Extend the key management system by integrating biometric signatures as an additional layer of attestation *before* cryptographic operations are authorized, and decentralize the key holder function utilizing a blockchain-based reputation system. This addresses scenarios where traditional key holders (third parties or internal systems) might be compromised or unavailable, and adds a strong user-centric security component.

**Specifications:**

**1. Bio-Signature Enrollment Module:**

*   **Function:** Securely enroll user biometric data (fingerprint, facial scan, voice print - configurable) linked to their cryptographic key pair.
*   **Technology:** Utilize a secure enclave (e.g., Intel SGX, ARM TrustZone) for biometric data storage and matching *without* exposing raw biometric data.  Data is tokenized and encrypted.
*   **Interface:** Mobile app / hardware security module (HSM) integration for enrollment and authentication.
*   **Output:**  A biometric template token and associated public key stored securely.

**2. Request Pre-Processing with Bio-Attestation:**

*   **Function:**  Intercept a request for a cryptographic operation. Initiate a bio-attestation challenge to the requestor.
*   **Process:** The system sends a unique, time-sensitive challenge to the requestor's enrolled device.  The device captures a live biometric sample, matches it against the enrolled template, and generates a signed attestation token.
*   **Validation:** The system verifies the attestation token's signature and timestamp to confirm liveness and authorization.

**3. Decentralized Key Holder Network:**

*   **Technology:**  Private/Permissioned Blockchain (e.g., Hyperledger Fabric, Corda).
*   **Nodes:**  Multiple independent nodes act as potential key holders. Each node possesses a shard of the private key (using Shamir's Secret Sharing or similar).
*   **Reputation System:** Each node maintains a reputation score based on successful key provision and attestation verification.
*   **Key Reconstruction:**  A quorum of nodes (based on reputation and availability) must agree to reconstruct the private key *only after* successful bio-attestation.

**4. Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) for Key Usage:**

*   **Function:**  Perform cryptographic operations *without* exposing the complete private key.
*   **Process:** MPC protocols distribute computations across the quorum of key holder nodes, combining their partial key shares to generate the necessary cryptographic results.

**5. Request Fulfillment Workflow (Pseudocode):**

```
function fulfillRequest(requestData, requestSignature):
  // 1. Verify request signature (initial authentication)
  if !verifySignature(requestData, requestSignature):
    return ERROR_INVALID_SIGNATURE

  // 2. Initiate Bio-Attestation
  attestationToken = requestBioAttestation(requestorDeviceId)

  // 3. Verify Attestation Token
  if !verifyAttestationToken(attestationToken):
    return ERROR_BIO_ATTESTATION_FAILED

  // 4. Select Key Holder Quorum (based on reputation and availability)
  quorum = selectKeyHolderQuorum()

  // 5. Initiate MPC for Key Reconstruction and Cryptographic Operation
  result = performMPC(quorum, requestData)

  // 6. Return Result to Requestor
  return result
```

**6. Smart Contract Logic (Simplified):**

*   `registerKeyHolder(nodeId, reputation)`: Registers a new key holder node with an initial reputation score.
*   `updateReputation(nodeId, scoreChange)`: Updates a node's reputation based on successful/failed operations.
*   `requestKeyProvision(requestId, requestData)`: Initiates a request for key provision.
*   `verifyAttestation(attestationToken)`: Verifies the validity of the bio-attestation token.
*   `executeMPC(requestData)`: Triggers the MPC execution with the selected quorum.



This system enhances security, availability, and user control over cryptographic keys. The combination of biometrics and a decentralized key holder network mitigates risks associated with single points of failure and unauthorized access.  The reputation system incentivizes reliable operation and discourages malicious behavior.
