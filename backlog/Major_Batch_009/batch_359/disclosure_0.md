**Dynamic Data Stream Provenance & Reconstitution**

**Concept:** Extend the shared-access data stream concept to not only allow multiple consumers with filtered views, but also to track *how* those views were created and allow for retroactive reconstruction of data as if consumed under different filters. This moves beyond simply *accessing* subsets to *re-experiencing* subsets.

**Specs:**

*   **Provenance Metadata:** Each data record in the shared-access stream will have embedded provenance metadata. This metadata includes:
    *   Original record ID.
    *   Timestamps for record creation & modification.
    *   List of all active filters applied at creation.
    *   Hash of the original data payload.
*   **Filter Definition Language (FDL):** A standardized language to define complex filtering rules. These rules can include boolean logic, range comparisons, pattern matching, and user-defined functions. FDL is versioned to allow for reproducible results.
*   **Reconstitution Engine:** A service that takes a stream consumer ID, a timestamp, and an FDL definition as input. It then reconstructs the data stream *as it would have been seen* by that consumer at that time, applying the specified FDL.
*   **Historical Filter Store:** Stores all FDL definitions used by each stream consumer, indexed by consumer ID and timestamp.
*   **Data Archiving:**  Archive original, unfiltered data records for long-term storage and reconstitution. Utilize immutable storage.
*   **Reconstitution API:**
    *   `reconstitute(consumerId, timestamp, fdl)`: Returns a reconstituted data stream.
    *   `getFilters(consumerId, startTime, endTime)`: Returns a list of filters used by the consumer within the specified time range.
    *   `validateFDL(fdl)`: Validates a filter definition against the FDL schema.
*   **Data Format:** Data records will be stored in a columnar format (e.g., Apache Parquet) to optimize reconstitution performance.

**Pseudocode (Reconstitution Engine):**

```
function reconstitute(consumerId, timestamp, fdl):
  // 1. Retrieve historical filters for the consumer up to the timestamp
  filters = getHistoricalFilters(consumerId, timestamp)

  // 2. Load original data records from archive
  originalData = loadOriginalData()

  // 3. Apply the specified FDL and historical filters
  filteredData = originalData.filter(fdl AND historicalFilters)

  // 4. Return the filtered data stream
  return filteredData
```

**Novelty:**

Existing systems focus on *access control* to data streams. This proposal goes beyond access to allow for the retroactive reconstruction of data as it was *perceived* by a specific consumer at a specific time. This opens up possibilities for auditing, debugging, anomaly detection, and personalized data experiences. It moves from simply reading what *is* there to experiencing what *was* there.
