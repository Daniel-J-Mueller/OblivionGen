## Dynamic Content Stitching via Predictive Pre-Fetch & AI-Driven Segment Creation

**Concept:** Enhance the existing multi-datacenter video packaging system by introducing AI-driven content segment creation *and* a predictive pre-fetch mechanism that anticipates user viewing patterns to enable seamless, low-latency content delivery, even with highly variable network conditions.

**Specs:**

**1. AI-Driven Segment Creation Module (integrated into Ingress Nodes):**

*   **Input:** Raw video stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Scene Detection:** Employ a deep learning model (e.g., a 3D convolutional neural network trained on a large dataset of video scenes) to identify scene boundaries within the raw video stream.
    *   **Complexity Analysis:**  Analyze each scene for visual complexity (motion vector density, color variance, edge density). Assign a 'complexity score' to each scene.
    *   **Dynamic Segmentation:** Instead of fixed-duration segments, create variable-length segments based on scene boundaries and complexity scores.  High-complexity scenes get shorter segments. Low-complexity scenes allow for longer segments. 
    *   **Metadata Enrichment:**  Append metadata to each segment:
        *   Scene ID
        *   Complexity Score
        *   Estimated Bandwidth Requirement (based on complexity)
        *   Keyframe Indicator (identifies keyframes within the segment)
    *   **Encoding Profile Selection:** Dynamically select encoding profiles based on scene complexity. High complexity = higher bitrate, more encoding passes.

**2. Predictive Pre-Fetch Module (integrated into Content Management Service):**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time streaming request logs (user IDs, content IDs, timestamps, geographic location, device type, bandwidth).
    *   Historical viewing data.
    *   Social media trends (detecting trending content).
    *   External event data (sports scores, news events).
*   **Prediction Model:**
    *   Employ a recurrent neural network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to predict future viewing requests.
    *   Input features: historical request patterns, current trending content, user demographics, time of day, day of week, event data.
    *   Output: probability distribution over future content requests (which content is likely to be requested, and when).
*   **Pre-Fetch Logic:**
    *   Based on the probability distribution, proactively pre-fetch content segments and store them in local cache components.
    *   Prioritize pre-fetching segments with high probability and high bandwidth requirements.
    *   Employ a caching strategy that balances cache size, pre-fetch accuracy, and staleness.

**3. Adaptive Stitching Engine (integrated into Egress Nodes):**

*   **Input:** Streaming request, available segments in cache, network conditions.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Segment Selection:** Select segments based on requested encoding profile and availability in cache.
    *   **Seamless Stitching:** Stitch segments together to create a continuous stream.
    *   **Network Adaptation:** Dynamically adjust the bitrate and encoding profile based on real-time network conditions.  Prioritize segments with lower bandwidth requirements if network congestion is detected.
    *   **Error Correction:** Implement forward error correction (FEC) to mitigate packet loss and ensure smooth playback.
*   **Output:** Continuous video stream to user device.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Stitching Engine):**

```
function stitchStream(request, cache, networkConditions) {
  segments = getAvailableSegments(request, cache)
  if (segments.length == 0) {
    // Request segments from origin server
  }

  while (stream is running) {
    nextSegment = selectNextSegment(segments)
    if (networkConditions.bandwidth < threshold) {
      nextSegment = selectLowerBitrateSegment(segments)
    }
    transmitSegment(nextSegment)
  }
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static segmentation and pre-caching, employing AI to anticipate viewing patterns and proactively deliver content *before* it's requested. The dynamic segment creation allows for optimized bandwidth usage and improved viewing quality. This architecture will adapt to network conditions and ensure seamless playback.
