## Dynamic Complexity Scaling for Video Streams

**Concept:** Leverage client-side processing capability to dynamically adjust video stream complexity *beyond* resolution/bitrate, creating a nuanced viewing experience tailored to individual device resources. This moves beyond simply delivering a lower quality stream, and instead focuses on managing computational load *within* the decoded video.

**Specification:**

**I. Client-Side Analysis & Reporting:**

*   **Computational Load Metrics:** Client devices continuously monitor and report metrics related to decoding complexity. These include:
    *   **Motion Estimation Units (MEU):** Number of motion estimation operations per second.
    *   **Transform/Quantization Complexity:**  A score reflecting the complexity of the transform and quantization processes (e.g., number of DCTs, entropy coding operations).
    *   **Texture Complexity:** Analysis of frame texture to estimate rendering demands. High texture detail = higher computational cost.
    *   **Scene Change Rate:**  Frequency of scene changes impacts decoding/rendering load.
*   **Resource Availability:** Report available CPU/GPU resources, memory usage, and thermal throttling status.
*   **Reporting Frequency:**  Metrics reported to the server every 100-500ms.
*   **Adaptive Sampling:** Client dynamically adjusts reporting frequency based on observed system load. Less frequent reporting during stable conditions, more frequent during transitions.

**II. Server-Side Complexity Management:**

*   **Complexity Profiles:** Server maintains a database of pre-defined complexity profiles. These profiles dictate modifications to encoding parameters *beyond* bitrate/resolution. Examples:
    *   **High Complexity:** Maximize detail, use advanced encoding techniques (e.g., SAO, ASM), minimal quantization.
    *   **Medium Complexity:** Balance detail and efficiency, moderate quantization, standard encoding techniques.
    *   **Low Complexity:** Prioritize efficiency, aggressive quantization, simplified encoding techniques.
*   **Dynamic Profile Selection:** Based on client-reported metrics, server selects the appropriate complexity profile.
*   **Encoding Parameter Modulation:** Server dynamically adjusts encoding parameters based on the selected profile.
    *   **Quantization Parameter (QP):** Primary control for compression/detail.
    *   **Intra Prediction Modes:** Adjust the complexity of intra-frame prediction.
    *   **Motion Estimation Search Range:** Control the complexity of motion estimation.
    *   **Number of B-frames:** Adjust the number of bi-directional frames.
*   **Per-Object Complexity:** Enable differential complexity levels on a per-object basis within a frame. This is extremely demanding, but allows focusing resources on key elements (e.g., faces, moving objects) while simplifying background rendering. *Requires object detection and segmentation.*

**III. Manifest & Stream Delivery:**

*   **Complexity-Aware Manifest:** Manifest file includes information about available complexity profiles for each stream.
*   **Adaptive Switching:** Client dynamically switches between complexity profiles based on server instructions and local resource conditions.
*   **Seamless Transitions:** Implement techniques to minimize visual artifacts during transitions between complexity profiles.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function processClientMetrics(clientID, metrics) {
  resourceLoad = metrics.cpuLoad + metrics.gpuLoad
  thermalStatus = metrics.thermalStatus

  if (resourceLoad > 0.8 || thermalStatus == "throttling") {
    complexityProfile = "low"
  } else if (resourceLoad > 0.5) {
    complexityProfile = "medium"
  } else {
    complexityProfile = "high"
  }

  sendComplexityProfile(clientID, complexityProfile)
}

function sendComplexityProfile(clientID, profile) {
  // Adjust encoding parameters based on profile
  if (profile == "low") {
    qp = 32
    bFrames = 0
    intraPred = "simple"
  } else if (profile == "medium") {
    qp = 28
    bFrames = 2
    intraPred = "moderate"
  } else {
    qp = 24
    bFrames = 4
    intraPred = "complex"
  }
  // Encode/re-encode stream with adjusted parameters
  // Update manifest file with new stream information
  // Send updated manifest to client
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved viewing experience on low-end devices.
*   Reduced power consumption.
*   Enhanced thermal management.
*   More nuanced control over video quality.
*   Potential for content-aware optimization.
