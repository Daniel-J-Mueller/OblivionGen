## Dynamic Resource Allocation via Predictive Thermal Modeling

**Concept:** Leverage real-time and historical thermal data, combined with predicted workload, to preemptively shift tasks *between* processing units (cores, GPUs, dedicated accelerators) *before* thermal thresholds are reached. This is more granular than simply switching to a low-power mode or entering a sleep state.

**Specification:**

1.  **Thermal Profiling Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors temperature sensors across all processing units.
    *   Maintains a historical thermal profile for each processing unit, logging temperature fluctuations over time under varying workloads.
    *   Employs a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network or long short-term memory network) trained on the historical data to predict future temperature based on current workload and recent thermal trends.

2.  **Workload Analysis Module:**
    *   Monitors resource utilization (CPU, GPU, memory) for all active tasks.
    *   Identifies tasks that are thermally intensive (high resource usage, prolonged activity).
    *   Predicts future resource demands based on task type, user behavior, and historical data.

3.  **Dynamic Task Scheduler:**
    *   Receives thermal predictions and workload analysis.
    *   Implements a cost function that balances performance, power consumption, and thermal risk.
    *   Dynamically migrates tasks between processing units based on the cost function. 
        *   If a processing unit is predicted to exceed a thermal threshold, the scheduler moves thermally intensive tasks to cooler units *before* the threshold is reached.
        *   Prioritizes tasks based on user-defined importance (e.g., real-time applications receive higher priority).

4. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) & State Migration:**
   *   The system needs to quickly and reliably move the process state without corrupting data. 
   *   Employ shared memory regions with locking mechanisms for fast state transfer.
   *   Use serialization/deserialization protocols for complex data structures.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Task Scheduler):**

```
FUNCTION scheduleTasks()
  FOREACH processingUnit IN allProcessingUnits
    predictedTemperature = thermalProfilingModule.predictTemperature(processingUnit)
    IF predictedTemperature > thermalThreshold
      // Identify thermally intensive tasks on this unit
      intensiveTasks = workloadAnalysisModule.getIntensiveTasks(processingUnit)
      FOREACH task IN intensiveTasks
        // Find a cooler processing unit with available resources
        coolerUnit = findCoolerUnit()
        IF coolerUnit != NULL
          // Move task to cooler unit
          migrateTask(task, coolerUnit)
        ENDIF
      ENDFOREACH
    ENDIF
  ENDFOREACH
END FUNCTION
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Multiple processing units (CPU cores, GPUs, dedicated accelerators).
*   High-resolution temperature sensors embedded in each processing unit.
*   Fast inter-processor communication links.
*   Sufficient memory bandwidth to handle state migration.

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-performance computing
*   Mobile devices
*   Data centers
*   Gaming consoles
*   Autonomous vehicles
