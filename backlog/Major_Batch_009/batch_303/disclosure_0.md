## Dynamic Layout Sensitivity Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the layout testing to incorporate a 'sensitivity map' that identifies regions of the content most visually impacted by minor layout shifts. This prioritizes correction efforts and provides insight into content fragility.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensitivity Calculation:**
    *   Post-DOM vector array generation (as per patent claim 1/8/12), calculate a 'visual importance' score for each DOM element. This can be based on:
        *   Element size (larger = more important)
        *   Text density (more text = more important)
        *   Proximity to viewport center (closer = more important)
        *   Element type (headings, images > simple text blocks)
    *   Simulate minor layout shifts (e.g., 1-5 pixels) in various directions for each element.
    *   For each shift, calculate a 'delta score' representing the visual difference between the original and shifted render. This could use image comparison algorithms (e.g., structural similarity index - SSIM).
    *   Aggregate delta scores for each element, weighted by the element’s 'visual importance'.  The result is the 'layout sensitivity' score for that element.

2.  **Sensitivity Map Generation:**
    *   Visualize the layout sensitivity scores as a heatmap overlaid on a rendered screenshot of the content.  High sensitivity areas are indicated by brighter colors.
    *   Allow users to filter the map by sensitivity threshold, element type, or other criteria.

3.  **Automated Correction Prioritization:**
    *   During automated correction (as per patent claim 1/8/12), prioritize relocation recommendations for elements with high layout sensitivity scores.
    *   Adjust the ‘third amount of pixels’ (relocation amount) based on the sensitivity score. Highly sensitive elements receive smaller, more precise adjustments.

4.  **User Interaction:**
    *   Provide a user interface where designers can manually inspect the sensitivity map and override automated recommendations.
    *   Allow users to 'pin' specific elements to prevent relocation, even if they have high sensitivity.

**Pseudocode (Correction Prioritization):**

```
function prioritizeCorrections(domVectorArray, layoutRules, sensitivityMap) {
  corrections = []
  for each element in domVectorArray {
    sensitivityScore = sensitivityMap.getScore(element.id)
    layoutError = detectLayoutError(element, layoutRules)
    if (layoutError) {
      relocationAmount = calculateRelocation(layoutError, layoutRules)
      // Adjust relocation amount based on sensitivity
      adjustedRelocation = relocationAmount * (1 - sensitivityScore)
      corrections.add({
        element: element,
        relocation: adjustedRelocation
      })
    }
  }
  return corrections
}
```

**Potential Downstream Applications:**

*   **Adaptive Layout:** Dynamically adjust content layout based on real-time sensitivity maps to minimize disruption during user interactions.
*   **Content Robustness Scoring:** Assign a "robustness score" to content based on its average sensitivity.
*   **A/B Testing:** Use sensitivity maps to identify layout changes that are most likely to impact user experience during A/B tests.
