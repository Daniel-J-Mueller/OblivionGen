## Dynamic Query Expansion via Predictive Semantic Drift

**Concept:** Extend query relevance emphasis by *proactively* anticipating semantic shifts in user intent *during* a search session, not just based on initial query/result relevance. This goes beyond simple query refinement; it predicts where the user’s focus is *going*.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Component: Intent Drift Prediction Model (IDPM)**

*   **Input:**  A sequence of user interactions: initial query, results clicked, dwell time on results, subsequent queries, scrolling behavior (time spent viewing different sections of the results page), and any explicit feedback (thumbs up/down).
*   **Model:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with attention mechanism.  Specifically, a Transformer-based model trained on a massive corpus of search session data.  The attention mechanism identifies which aspects of previous interactions are most predictive of the current/future intent.
*   **Output:** Probability distribution over a "semantic space." This space isn't based on keywords, but on latent semantic embeddings derived from a large language model (LLM) like BERT or its successors. Each point in the semantic space represents a potential shift in the user’s information need.  The IDPM outputs not just *where* the user might go next, but *how likely* each direction is.

**2. Adaptive Emphasis System (AES)**

*   **Input:** Current search query, initial search results, IDPM output (probability distribution over semantic space), user interactions (as above).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Semantic Drift Vectors:**  From the IDPM output, derive "drift vectors." These vectors represent the most likely directions of semantic shift.
    2.  **Proactive Result Augmentation:** *Before* the user interacts with the initial results, augment them with results that align with the top N drift vectors. These are subtly integrated into the main results list (e.g., displayed with slightly lower prominence initially).
    3.  **Dynamic Emphasis Adjustment:** Based on the user's interaction with *all* results (including the augmented ones), dynamically adjust the emphasis applied to text passages.  
        *   If the user interacts with results aligned with a drift vector, increase the emphasis on passages within those results that are most strongly associated with that semantic direction.
        *   If the user ignores results aligned with a drift vector, decrease the emphasis on those passages and potentially remove those results from the display.
    4.  **Emphasis Types:**  Expand on the existing emphasis types. Introduce "predictive emphasis" – a subtle visual cue (e.g., a very light background highlight) applied to passages predicted to be relevant based on the IDPM output.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Search Index (existing)
    *   IDPM (trained model, deployed as a microservice)
    *   AES (microservice)
    *   User Interaction Tracker (captures user behavior)
    *   LLM API (access to semantic embeddings)
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  User submits query.
    2.  Search index returns initial results.
    3.  User Interaction Tracker captures query and initial results.
    4.  IDPM predicts semantic drift.
    5.  AES augments results and adjusts emphasis.
    6.  Updated results are displayed to the user.
    7.  User interaction data is fed back to the IDPM and AES for continuous learning.

**Pseudocode (AES):**

```
function adjust_emphasis(query, results, drift_vectors, user_interactions):
  augmented_results = augment_results(results, drift_vectors)
  scored_passages = score_passages(augmented_results, query, drift_vectors)
  emphasized_results = apply_emphasis(scored_passages)
  return emphasized_results

function apply_emphasis(scored_passages):
  for passage in scored_passages:
    if passage.score > threshold_high:
      passage.emphasis = "bold_underline"  // or similar
    elif passage.score > threshold_medium:
      passage.emphasis = "highlight"
    elif passage.score > threshold_low:
      passage.emphasis = "predictive_highlight" // subtle cue
    else:
      passage.emphasis = "none"
  return scored_passages
```

**Novelty:** This system isn’t reactive to user interaction; it *anticipates* it, proactively guiding the user towards relevant information before they even express a refined need. The integration of a predictive model alongside dynamic emphasis represents a significant advancement over existing search highlighting techniques.  The "predictive highlight" adds a subtle layer of guidance not present in current systems.
