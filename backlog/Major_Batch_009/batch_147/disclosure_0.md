## Autonomous Network "Shadowing" & Predictive Remediation

**Concept:** Extend the automated remediation service to proactively *learn* network behavior via a "shadow" network, and predict/prevent failures *before* they impact production traffic.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Network Creation:**
    *   Establish a parallel "shadow" network mirroring the production network topology. This could be virtualized within existing infrastructure (e.g., using network virtualization overlays, containerization).
    *   Mirror production traffic (sampled, not full duplication to avoid bandwidth saturation) to the shadow network. Utilize technologies like sFlow/NetFlow, or dedicated traffic mirroring appliances.
    *   Implement a 'delay' mechanism for mirrored traffic to simulate propagation delays.  Adjustable delay parameters for each link.

2.  **Behavioral Baseline Establishment:**
    *   Deploy monitoring agents within the shadow network to capture performance metrics: latency, packet loss, jitter, bandwidth utilization, CPU/memory usage on network devices.
    *   Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, time series forecasting) to establish a baseline of “normal” network behavior for each link and device within the shadow network. Algorithms should adapt over time.
    *   Maintain historical data for comparison and trend analysis.

3.  **Predictive Failure Analysis:**
    *   Continuously monitor shadow network performance.
    *   When deviations from the established baseline exceed predefined thresholds, trigger predictive failure analysis.
    *   Analyze the nature and location of the deviation.  Is it a gradual degradation or a sudden spike? Is it localized to a single device or propagating across the network?
    *   Utilize simulation tools (network emulators) to model potential failure scenarios based on the observed deviations. Test various remediation strategies within the simulated environment.

4.  **Proactive Remediation Orchestration:**
    *   If the simulation predicts a likely failure impacting production traffic, the system automatically initiates a proactive remediation strategy.
    *   Remediation actions could include:
        *   Re-routing traffic around the potentially failing device.
        *   Adjusting QoS parameters to prioritize critical traffic.
        *   Initiating a graceful shutdown of the failing device and failover to a redundant device.
        *   Applying firmware updates or configuration changes to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Remediation actions are staged and validated within the shadow network before being applied to the production network.
    *   The system logs all remediation actions and their impact on network performance.

5.  **Policy Integration:**
    *   Integrate with existing network policies to ensure that remediation actions comply with security and compliance requirements.
    *   Allow administrators to define custom remediation policies based on specific failure scenarios.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Shadow Network Monitoring Loop
while (true) {
  shadowNetworkMetrics = collectMetricsFromShadowNetwork()
  anomalyDetected = detectAnomaly(shadowNetworkMetrics)

  if (anomalyDetected) {
    simulationResults = runSimulation(anomalyDetected)
    if (simulationResults.predictedImpact > threshold) {
      remediationPlan = generateRemediationPlan(simulationResults)
      stagingResults = stageRemediationPlan(remediationPlan)
      if (stagingResults.success) {
        applyRemediationPlanToProduction(remediationPlan)
        logRemediationAction(remediationPlan)
      }
    }
  }
  sleep(interval)
}
```
