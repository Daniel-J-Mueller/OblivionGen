## Dynamic Intent Graph Generation from User Interaction Logs

**Specification:** A system for automatically evolving the transitional graph of intents used for conversational training data generation, driven by real-time user interaction data.

**Core Concept:** Instead of relying on a static, pre-defined intent graph, the system dynamically updates the graph based on observed user behavior and dialogue patterns. This allows the bot to adapt to evolving user needs and discover previously unforeseen conversational paths.

**Components:**

1.  **Interaction Log Parser:**  Analyzes user interactions (chat logs, voice transcripts) with the bot. Extracts key information such as user utterances, bot responses, identified intents, and slot values.

2.  **Intent Discovery Module:**  Utilizes machine learning (specifically, clustering and sequence modeling) to identify emerging intents or variations of existing intents. This module will look for recurring patterns in user utterances that are *not* currently mapped to any defined intent.

3.  **Graph Evolution Engine:**  Responsible for modifying the intent graph.
    *   **Node Creation:** Adds new nodes to the graph representing newly discovered intents.
    *   **Edge Creation:** Establishes connections between existing and new nodes based on observed transitions in user dialogue.  The strength of the edge is weighted by the frequency of the observed transition.
    *   **Edge Pruning:** Removes weak or unused edges to prevent the graph from becoming overly complex.  Edges that haven't been traversed in a certain timeframe are candidates for pruning.
    *   **Intent Merging:**  Identifies similar intents and merges them into a single, more generalized intent.  This can reduce redundancy and improve the bot's ability to handle diverse user inputs.

4.  **Confidence Scoring:**  Assigns a confidence score to each node and edge in the graph based on the amount of supporting data (user interactions).  Low-confidence elements are flagged for review or further data collection.

5.  **Training Data Generator Integration:** The system feeds the updated intent graph into the existing conversational training data generation pipeline.  This ensures that the training data reflects the latest user behavior and conversational patterns.

**Pseudocode (Graph Evolution Engine - Simplified):**

```
function evolve_graph(interaction_logs, current_graph):
  new_intents = discover_new_intents(interaction_logs)

  for intent in new_intents:
    add_node_to_graph(current_graph, intent)

  transition_pairs = extract_transition_pairs(interaction_logs)

  for pair in transition_pairs:
    intent1, intent2 = pair
    add_edge_to_graph(current_graph, intent1, intent2, weight=transition_frequency(pair))

  prune_weak_edges(current_graph, threshold=0.05) // Remove edges with low weight

  merge_similar_intents(current_graph)

  return current_graph
```

**Innovation:** The system doesn't *just* generate training data; it actively *learns* from real-world user interactions and adjusts the underlying conversational framework. This allows the bot to continuously improve its understanding of user needs and provide more relevant and engaging responses. This is a shift from a static training paradigm to a dynamic, adaptive learning system.
