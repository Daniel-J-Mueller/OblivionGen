## Dynamic Skill Chaining with Predictive Entity Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the multi-stage entity resolution system to dynamically chain skills based on *predicted* entity types *before* complete resolution, enabling proactive data enrichment and context building. This moves beyond reactive skill selection after entity identification to a proactive system that anticipates user needs.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Entity Type Modeling:**

*   **Data Source:** Train a model using historical user interaction data (utterances, selected skills, post-skill actions) and a knowledge graph linking entities to likely skill chains. The knowledge graph will contain probabilistic relationships between entity types and the skills they frequently trigger.
*   **Model Type:** Utilize a lightweight transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT) fine-tuned for entity type prediction given a partial utterance.
*   **Output:** A probability distribution over potential entity types (e.g., "Movie", "Restaurant", "Location", "Date") given the initial parsed utterance fragment.

**2. Proactive Skill Chain Initiation:**

*   **Thresholding:** Define a confidence threshold for entity type prediction. If the confidence for a specific entity type exceeds this threshold, initiate a corresponding skill chain *before* complete entity resolution.
*   **Skill Chain Templates:** Design pre-defined skill chain templates for each entity type. These templates outline a sequence of skills to execute (e.g., for "Restaurant":  "Find Restaurants" -> "Filter by Cuisine" -> "Show Reviews").
*   **Parallel Execution:** Launch initial skills in the chain *concurrently* with the entity resolution process.  This reduces latency.

**3. Dynamic Chain Adjustment:**

*   **Feedback Loop:**  As the entity resolution system returns complete entities, update the skill chain dynamically.
    *   If the resolved entity *confirms* the predicted type, continue executing the chain.
    *   If the resolved entity is *different* than the predicted type, *interrupt* the current chain and initiate a new chain based on the resolved entity.
*   **Chain Merging:** Allow for chain merging.  If partial resolution yields an entity that is relevant to a running chain, integrate the new entity into the existing workflow.
*   **Context Propagation:** Ensure seamless context propagation between skills in the chain. Pass relevant entities, user preferences, and intermediate results to subsequent skills.

**4. System Components:**

*   **Prediction Module:** Implements the entity type prediction model and handles thresholding.
*   **Chain Manager:** Responsible for managing skill chains, launching skills, and handling dynamic adjustments.
*   **Skill Orchestrator:** Coordinates the execution of skills and manages context propagation.
*   **Entity Resolution System:** (Existing System) Provides resolved entities to the Chain Manager.

**Pseudocode â€“ Chain Manager:**

```
function processUtterance(utterance):
  partialEntity = parseInitialEntity(utterance)
  entityTypePrediction = PredictionModule.predictEntityType(partialEntity)

  if entityTypePrediction.confidence > threshold:
    skillChain = SkillChainTemplates.getChain(entityTypePrediction.type)
    chainID = startSkillChain(skillChain) //Launch Initial Skills

  resolvedEntity = EntityResolutionSystem.resolveEntity(utterance)

  if resolvedEntity.type != predictedType:
    stopSkillChain(chainID) //Interrupt Existing Chain
    skillChain = SkillChainTemplates.getChain(resolvedEntity.type)
    chainID = startSkillChain(skillChain)

  //Pass Resolved Entity to Current Skill in Chain
  currentSkill = getSkill(chainID)
  currentSkill.processEntity(resolvedEntity)
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply selecting a skill *after* entity resolution.  It anticipates user needs based on *probabilistic* entity type predictions and proactively initiates workflows, significantly reducing latency and improving the user experience.  The dynamic chain adjustment mechanism allows for flexible handling of ambiguous utterances and ensures the system adapts to the actual user intent.
