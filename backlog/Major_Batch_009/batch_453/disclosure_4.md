## Dynamic Topical Drift Detection & Recommendation

**Concept:** Extend the originality score concept to track *how* content diverges over time, identifying ‘topical drift’ – shifts in underlying themes – and recommending content based on *anticipated* future interests, not just current similarity.

**Specs:**

1.  **Content Segmentation:** Divide each item’s content into granular topical segments (e.g., using BERT or similar transformers).  Each segment gets a vector embedding representing its dominant topic.
2.  **Temporal Tagging:**  Associate each segment with a ‘creation timestamp’ representing when that content was originally published or created. This could be metadata or, if unavailable, estimated based on language models.
3.  **Drift Vector Calculation:** For each item, calculate a ‘drift vector’. This vector represents the change in dominant topics over time.  
    *   Divide the content into time slices (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
    *   Calculate the average topic vector for each time slice.
    *   The drift vector is the difference between these average topic vectors, chronologically ordered.
4.  **User Drift Profile:**  Maintain a ‘drift profile’ for each user. This profile is calculated by aggregating the drift vectors of items the user has interacted with.  Smoothing (e.g., exponential moving average) is crucial here to account for user evolution.
5.  **Recommendation Algorithm:**
    *   Calculate the drift vector of candidate items.
    *   Compute a ‘drift similarity’ score between the user's drift profile and the item's drift vector (e.g., cosine similarity).
    *   Combine drift similarity with the existing originality score (e.g., weighted average).  Weighting should be tunable.
    *   Recommend items with high combined scores.

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Phase):**

```
function recommend_items(user_id, candidate_items):
  user_drift_profile = get_user_drift_profile(user_id)

  for item in candidate_items:
    item_drift_vector = calculate_item_drift_vector(item)
    drift_similarity = cosine_similarity(user_drift_profile, item_drift_vector)
    originality_score = calculate_originality_score(item) #From original patent
    combined_score = (weight_originality * originality_score) + (weight_drift * drift_similarity)
    item.combined_score = combined_score

  sorted_items = sort(items, descending=True, key=item.combined_score)
  return sorted_items[:N] #Return top N recommendations
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Item content (text, etc.)
*   Item creation/publication timestamps
*   User interaction history (views, purchases, etc.)
*   Tunable weights for originality and drift similarity.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   More proactive and personalized recommendations.
*   Discovery of content that aligns with *evolving* interests.
*   Increased user engagement and retention.
*   Novelty beyond simple content similarity.
