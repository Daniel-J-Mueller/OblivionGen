## Dynamic Haptic Ghosting Compensation

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback with the flash update to actively *mask* ghosting instead of purely reducing its visual effect. Instead of simply refreshing the screen, the system anticipates lingering visual artifacts and provides corresponding tactile stimulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-density array of micro-actuators integrated beneath the touchscreen surface. Piezoelectric or electrostatic actuators preferred for speed and precision. Resolution: minimum 60 actuators per square inch.
    *   Dedicated haptic processing unit co-located with the main processor.
    *   Capacitive or resistive sensor array to determine precise finger/stylus location and pressure.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Ghosting Prediction Algorithm:** Analyze user gesture data (speed, direction, pressure) in real-time to predict the *likelihood* and *location* of potential ghosting artifacts. This algorithm should be trained on a dataset of user gestures and their corresponding visual ghosting patterns.
    *   **Haptic Mapping:** Map predicted ghosting locations to corresponding actuator activations. The intensity of the haptic feedback should be proportional to the predicted severity of the ghosting.
    *   **Synchronized Flash & Haptic Update:** Trigger the flash update *and* the haptic feedback simultaneously. The flash update should be optimized to minimize afterimages, while the haptic feedback provides a tactile "counter-stimulus" to mask any remaining visual artifacts.
    *   **User Customization:** Allow users to adjust the intensity and pattern of the haptic feedback. Include presets for different content types (e.g., reading, drawing, gaming).
    *   **Learning Mode:** System learns user-specific ghosting patterns and adapts the haptic feedback accordingly.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Receive User Gesture Data
    gestureData = getGestureData();

    // Predict Ghosting
    ghostingMap = predictGhosting(gestureData);

    // Generate Haptic Feedback Pattern
    hapticPattern = generateHapticPattern(ghostingMap);

    // Trigger Flash Update
    performFlashUpdate();

    // Activate Actuators
    activateActuators(hapticPattern);

    // Capture User Feedback (Learning Mode)
    if (learningModeEnabled) {
        captureUserFeedback();
        updateGhostingModel();
    }
}
```

**Refinement:**

*   Explore different haptic patterns beyond simple vibrations. For example, use spatially varying textures or directional forces to create a more convincing illusion.
*   Implement a dynamic adjustment of the flash update based on ambient lighting conditions.
*   Integrate with eye-tracking technology to further refine the prediction of ghosting artifacts and optimize the haptic feedback.
*   Consider using ultrasound to create localized tactile sensations without requiring physical actuators.
