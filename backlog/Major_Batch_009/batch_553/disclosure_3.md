## Virtual Network "Shadowing" for Dynamic Security & Compliance

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network capability to create ephemeral, "shadow" networks that mirror production networks, enabling real-time security testing, compliance auditing, and vulnerability exploitation *without* impacting live systems.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Network Creation API:** 
    *   `createShadowNetwork(productionNetworkID, shadowNetworkName, replicationScope)`
        *   `productionNetworkID`:  Unique identifier of the existing production virtual network.
        *   `shadowNetworkName`:  User-defined name for the shadow network instance.
        *   `replicationScope`:  Enum {“full”, “subset”, “specificVMs”}. Defines the extent of replication. “full” replicates all VMs and network configurations. “subset” replicates based on user-defined tags/groups. “specificVMs” replicates only designated VMs.
    *   Returns: `shadowNetworkID`.

2.  **Real-time Data Mirroring:**
    *   Employ network taps/port mirroring (at hypervisor level) to capture all ingress/egress traffic from the production network (or selected VMs based on `replicationScope`).
    *   Stream mirrored traffic to the corresponding shadow network VMs.  Maintain minimal latency (target < 50ms).
    *   Traffic filtering/scrubbing to remove sensitive data *before* it enters the shadow network (configurable policies).

3.  **Dynamic VM Provisioning:**
    *   Shadow network VMs are provisioned *on-demand* based on the VMs active in the production network.
    *   VM configurations (OS, applications, data – scrubbed/synthetic) are dynamically copied/recreated.
    *   Ability to "freeze" the shadow network at a specific point in time for forensic analysis.

4.  **Security/Compliance Engines Integration:**
    *   Integrate with vulnerability scanners, intrusion detection systems, and compliance auditing tools.
    *   Run security tests/audits *exclusively* on the shadow network.
    *   Report findings to a central dashboard.

5.  **Automated Incident Response Simulation:**
    *   Simulate attacks (e.g., ransomware, DDoS) on the shadow network.
    *   Test incident response procedures (e.g., firewall rule updates, VM isolation) without impacting production.
    *   Record performance metrics (e.g., time to detect, time to respond).

6.  **Ephemeral Nature:**
    *   Shadow networks are automatically destroyed after a defined period of inactivity or upon user request.
    *   All data stored within the shadow network is deleted.

**Pseudocode (Shadow Network Creation):**

```
function createShadowNetwork(productionNetworkID, shadowNetworkName, replicationScope) {
    // Validate input parameters

    // Create new virtual network instance (shadowNetworkID)

    // Configure network taps/port mirroring on production network VMs

    // Create shadow VMs (based on replicationScope)

    // Copy/create VM configurations (scrubbed/synthetic data)

    // Establish network connectivity between shadow VMs

    // Configure security policies (firewall rules, access control lists)

    // Start data mirroring

    return shadowNetworkID
}
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Proactive vulnerability management.
*   Compliance auditing (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA).
*   Security training and simulations.
*   Rapid incident response testing.
*   Application security testing.
