## Dynamic Wake Word Blending & Emotional Context

**Concept:**  Instead of discrete wake word models, create a system that *blends* wake word detection with real-time emotional analysis of the user’s speech *prior* to formal wake word detection. This creates a more nuanced and adaptive response.  The core idea is to prime the wake word detection system based on the *likelihood* of intentional command, filtering out incidental phrases that happen to sound like wake words.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**  Existing device microphone array.  Edge TPU or similar for on-device processing of audio features.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):** Standard VAD to isolate speech segments.
    *   **Emotional Feature Extraction:**  Model trained to extract features indicative of emotional state (e.g., valence, arousal, dominance) from raw audio waveforms. Features will include prosodic features (pitch, intensity, rhythm) and spectral characteristics.
    *   **Intent Probability Estimator:**  A machine learning model that takes emotional features as input and outputs a probability score representing the likelihood the user is about to issue a command.  Trained on labeled data where users are either giving explicit commands or engaging in casual conversation.
    *   **Dynamic Wake Word Model Selector:** Based on the intent probability, this module adjusts the sensitivity and parameters of the wake word detection model.  High intent probability = increased sensitivity.  Low intent probability = decreased sensitivity or even temporary deactivation of wake word detection.
    *   **Wake Word Detection Engine:**  Existing wake word detection models (potentially multiple, for different wake words). These models are *dynamically adjusted* by the Dynamic Wake Word Model Selector.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  audio = getAudioData();
  if (VAD(audio)) {
    emotionalFeatures = extractEmotionalFeatures(audio);
    intentProbability = estimateIntentProbability(emotionalFeatures);
    
    if (intentProbability > threshold) {
      // High Intent: Activate/Increase Sensitivity
      adjustedWakeWordModel = adjustWakeWordModel(wakeWordModel, sensitivityIncrease);
      wakeWordDetected = detectWakeWord(audio, adjustedWakeWordModel);
    } else {
      // Low Intent: Reduce Sensitivity or Deactivate
      adjustedWakeWordModel = adjustWakeWordModel(wakeWordModel, sensitivityDecrease);
      wakeWordDetected = detectWakeWord(audio, adjustedWakeWordModel);
      //Alternatively:
      //wakeWordDetected = false; //deactivate for low intent
    }
    
    if (wakeWordDetected) {
      //Process command
    }
  }
}
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   The system could learn user-specific emotional profiles to personalize the intent estimation.
*   Different ‘emotional contexts’ could be mapped to different wake word sensitivities.  (e.g., happy/excited = higher sensitivity, calm/relaxed = lower sensitivity).
*   A confidence threshold for the emotional analysis is critical to prevent false positives.
*   The system must account for cultural differences in emotional expression.
*   Explore using Generative AI to create synthetic audio data for training the intent probability estimator. This could significantly improve the accuracy of the system.
*   The system could be expanded to prioritize wake words based on the user’s current activity (e.g., if the user is cooking, prioritize wake words related to cooking).
