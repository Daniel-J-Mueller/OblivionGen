## Dynamic Feature Synthesis via Generative AI

**Concept:** Extend the hierarchical page modeling with a generative AI component that synthesizes new features based on context and user profiles. Instead of relying solely on inherited or original features defined by designers, dynamically *create* features tailored to the individual viewing the page.

**Specifications:**

**1. Feature Synthesis Engine:**

*   **Model:** Utilize a multimodal generative AI model (e.g., a variant of GPT-4 with image/video understanding) trained on a massive dataset of web content, UI/UX patterns, and user interaction data.
*   **Input:**
    *   Page Model: The existing hierarchical page model, including original and inherited features.
    *   User Profile: Data about the user (demographics, browsing history, preferences, current context - time of day, location, device).
    *   Real-time Context: Information about the current page being viewed, e.g., keywords, topic, sentiment, entities.
*   **Output:**  A set of "synthetic features". These features aren't pre-defined; they are generated *on the fly*.  Each synthetic feature includes:
    *   Feature Type: (e.g., text snippet, image, video, interactive element, link).
    *   Content: The generated content for the feature.
    *   Network Page Region:  A suggested region for placement (based on the page model and predicted relevance).
    *   Priority:  A score indicating the relevance of the feature.
    *   Rendering Instructions: Data for rendering the feature.

**2. Integration with Existing Page Model:**

*   **Feature Conflict Resolution:**  The existing priority system is extended to include synthetic features. A weighted scoring mechanism determines which features (original, inherited, synthetic) are displayed, resolving conflicts based on priority and relevance.
*   **Dynamic Feature Insertion:** New API calls are added to the page rendering engine allowing insertion of synthetic features into the page layout.
*   **A/B Testing Framework:** Built-in A/B testing capabilities to evaluate the performance of synthetic features and optimize the generative AI model.

**3.  Training Data Pipeline:**

*   **Web Scraping & Data Augmentation:** Continuously scrape the web for UI/UX patterns and user-generated content. Augment data with synthetic examples generated by the AI model itself.
*   **User Interaction Feedback:** Capture user interactions with synthetic features (clicks, views, engagement metrics) and use this data to refine the generative AI model.

**Pseudocode (Feature Synthesis Engine):**

```
function synthesizeFeatures(pageModel, userProfile, context):
  // 1. Prepare Input for AI Model
  inputData = {
    pageModel: pageModel,
    userProfile: userProfile,
    context: context
  }

  // 2. Call Generative AI Model
  aiOutput = callAIModel(inputData) // AI Model returns a list of synthetic features

  // 3. Filter and Rank Features
  filteredFeatures = filterIrrelevantFeatures(aiOutput)
  rankedFeatures = rankFeatures(filteredFeatures)

  return rankedFeatures
```

**Novelty:** This diverges from the existing patent by *proactively generating* features instead of simply managing inherited/original ones. It shifts the focus from static page models to dynamic, personalized experiences. The AI model acts as a creative engine, continuously adapting the page content to individual user needs. It's a move toward truly intelligent, self-optimizing web pages.
