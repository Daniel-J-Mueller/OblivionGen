## Dynamic Proximity-Based Task Assignment

**Concept:** Expand the proximity-based payment request system into a broader task assignment platform. Instead of just payments, utilize proximity and historical interaction data to dynamically assign small, location-specific tasks to nearby users.

**Specs:**

**1. Task Definition & Posting:**

*   **Task Types:** Predefined and customizable task categories (e.g., “Delivery – Small Package”, “Information Gathering – Check Store Stock”, “Quick Help – Carry Item”, "Photograph - Landmark", "Crowdsource - Opinion").
*   **Task Payload:** Tasks include:
    *   Task description.
    *   Geographic coordinates (target location).
    *   Radius (proximity range).
    *   Reward (monetary or points-based).
    *   Estimated completion time.
    *   Requester ID.
*   **Posting Interface:** Users (Requesters) post tasks via a mobile app. Location services enabled.

**2. User Profiling & Matching:**

*   **Proximity Detection:** System continuously monitors the location of all active users (Workers) with location services enabled.
*   **Historical Interaction Data:** Track frequency and type of past interactions between users (e.g., payments, task completions, mutual contacts).
*   **Skill/Preference Profiles:** Workers can define skills, preferences (e.g., preferred task types, maximum travel distance).
*   **Matching Algorithm:**
    *   Prioritize Workers within the specified radius of the task location.
    *   Factor in historical interaction data (higher priority to frequent interactors).
    *   Match based on skill/preference profiles.
    *   Implement a reputation system (Worker ratings/reviews).
    *   Algorithm weights: dynamically adjust weights based on task urgency & reward amount.

**3. Task Notification & Acceptance:**

*   **Push Notifications:** Send task notifications to matched Workers.
*   **Task Preview:** Workers can view task details before accepting.
*   **Acceptance Deadline:** Implement a time limit for acceptance.
*   **Automatic Re-bidding:** If a task remains unaccepted after the initial round, the system automatically expands the search radius and/or adjusts reward amounts.

**4. Task Completion & Verification:**

*   **Location Tracking:** Track Worker location during task completion (optional, for certain task types).
*   **Proof of Completion:**
    *   Photo/video upload.
    *   Geofencing verification (Worker must be within a specific area).
    *   Requester confirmation.
*   **Payment/Reward Distribution:** Automatic payment/reward distribution upon successful verification.

**5. System Architecture (Pseudocode):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Scan for new tasks
    newTasks = TaskQueue.getNewTasks();

    for each (task in newTasks) {
        // Find potential workers
        workers = WorkerDatabase.getNearbyWorkers(task.location, task.radius);

        // Filter workers based on skills/preferences
        filteredWorkers = filterWorkers(workers, task.requirements);

        // Rank workers based on history and proximity
        rankedWorkers = rankWorkers(filteredWorkers, task.requester, historyData);

        // Send task notifications
        sendNotifications(rankedWorkers, task);

        // Wait for worker acceptance
        acceptedWorker = waitForAcceptance(task);

        // Verify completion and distribute reward
        verifyCompletion(acceptedWorker, task);
        distributeReward(acceptedWorker, task);
    }
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Task`: { `taskID`, `requesterID`, `location`, `radius`, `requirements`, `reward`, `status` }
*   `Worker`: { `workerID`, `location`, `skills`, `preferences`, `reputation` }
*   `HistoryData`: { `workerID`, `requesterID`, `interactionCount`, `interactionType` }

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with smart contracts for secure and automated reward distribution.
*   Gamification elements (badges, leaderboards) to incentivize participation.
*   AI-powered task routing to optimize efficiency.
*   Dynamic pricing based on supply and demand.
