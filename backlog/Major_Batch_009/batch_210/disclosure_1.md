## Dynamic Resolution Stitching for Multi-Perspective Event Reconstruction

**System Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multiple synchronized video streams (minimum 2, scalable) captured from independent image capture devices. Each stream possesses inherent, potentially differing, resolutions and frame rates. Streams are timestamped with nanosecond precision.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance multi-core processor with dedicated GPU acceleration for real-time video processing.
*   **Memory:** Minimum 64GB RAM, expandable to 128GB for handling high-resolution streams.
*   **Storage:** Fast NVMe SSD storage (minimum 2TB) for buffering and storing intermediate video data.
*   **Output:** A single, reconstructed video stream with variable resolution zones, dynamically adjusted based on event saliency and perceived importance. Output format: MP4 with HEVC codec.

**Innovation Description:**

The system creates a unified video representation by intelligently merging multiple perspectives. Instead of forcing all streams to a single, lowest-common-denominator resolution, or simply mosaicking them, we leverage a dynamic resolution stitching approach. 

The core principle is to analyze each video stream for regions of interest (ROIs) â€“ detected faces, objects, motion, or other user-defined criteria. Each ROI is assigned a 'saliency score' based on the strength of detection and user-defined weights.

The system then determines the optimal resolution for each ROI *within the final output video*. High-saliency ROIs are rendered at their native resolution (or upscaled if necessary), while low-saliency ROIs are downscaled or even excluded from the final output. 

This results in a 'patchwork' video where critical areas are rendered with maximum clarity, and less important areas are reduced in resolution or omitted to conserve bandwidth and processing resources.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: List of VideoStreams (streamID, resolution, frameRate, timestamp)
//        List of SaliencyCriteria (criteriaID, detectionMethod, weight)

function reconstructVideo(VideoStreams, SaliencyCriteria):
    OutputVideo = new Video()

    for frame in synchronizedFrames(VideoStreams):
        frameData = {}
        for stream in VideoStreams:
            frameData[stream.streamID] = stream.getFrame(frame.timestamp)

        ROIs = detectROIs(frameData, SaliencyCriteria) //Returns list of ROIs with saliency scores

        //Calculate optimal resolution for each ROI based on saliency score
        resolutionMap = calculateResolutionMap(ROIs)

        //Stitch together the different video streams based on the resolutionMap
        stitchedFrame = stitchFrame(frameData, resolutionMap)

        OutputVideo.addFrame(stitchedFrame)

    return OutputVideo

function stitchFrame(frameData, resolutionMap):
    //Based on resolutionMap, downscale/upscale and combine frames
    //Handle edge cases and seamless transitions between different resolutions
    return stitchedFrame

function detectROIs(frameData, SaliencyCriteria):
    //Apply different detection methods to identify ROIs
    //Calculate saliency score for each ROI based on detection confidence and SaliencyCriteria weights
    return ROIs
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **AI-Driven Saliency Prediction:** Utilize machine learning models to predict areas of interest based on video content and user behavior.
*   **User-Defined Regions of Interest:** Allow users to manually define ROIs and adjust their saliency weights.
*   **Adaptive Bandwidth Control:** Dynamically adjust the overall video bitrate based on network conditions and user preferences.
*   **Multi-View Stereo Reconstruction:** Generate 3D models of the scene from the multiple video streams.
*   **Event Triggered Stitching:** Only stitch together sections of the video which have a high score based on the input.
