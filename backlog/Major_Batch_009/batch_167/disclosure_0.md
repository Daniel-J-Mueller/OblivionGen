## Adaptive Endpoint Masking & Federated Identity Stitching

**Specification:** A system that extends the core concept of redirecting users to login pages with a dynamic masking of the initial URL and a federated identity stitching component.

**Core Concept:** Instead of simply redirecting *to* a login page, the system intercepts the initial URL request, *replaces* the visible portion with a generic placeholder (e.g., "access.unified.com"), then injects the original URL as a hidden parameter within the login request.  Upon successful authentication, the system reconstructs the original URL, enabling a seamless transition.  Federated identity stitching is enabled by analyzing user context (geolocation, organization, device type) to dynamically select the most appropriate identity provider (IdP) *before* redirection, minimizing user friction.

**Components:**

*   **URL Masking Proxy:** A lightweight proxy server positioned before the primary computing resource service provider.  This proxy intercepts incoming requests, replaces the visible URL portion with a standardized placeholder, and appends the original URL as a hidden parameter (e.g., `?originalURL=https://original.domain.com/path`).
*   **Contextual Identity Selector:** A rule-based engine that analyzes user context (geolocation, organization, device type, time of day, network conditions) to select the optimal Identity Provider (IdP). This can integrate with existing directory services or rely on a dynamically maintained mapping table.
*   **Federated Identity Stitcher:** A component responsible for consolidating identity information from multiple IdPs. It utilizes a common identifier (e.g., email address, user principal name) to link identities across different systems.
*   **Authentication Orchestrator:** Manages the authentication flow, including redirection to the selected IdP, handling of authentication tokens, and communication with the Federated Identity Stitcher.
*   **Dynamic URL Reconstructor:** Upon successful authentication, this component extracts the original URL from the hidden parameter and reconstructs the full URL, redirecting the user to the intended resource.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic URL Reconstructor):**

```
function reconstructURL(authenticationToken, requestParameters):
  originalURL = requestParameters.get("originalURL")
  if originalURL is null:
    // Fallback to default URL if original URL is not found
    originalURL = defaultURL
  
  // Verify the authenticity of the authenticationToken (important security step)
  if isValidToken(authenticationToken):
    // Append any relevant query parameters from the original request
    finalURL = originalURL + "?" + requestParameters.getQueryString()
    
    // Redirect the user to the final URL
    redirect(finalURL)
  else:
    // Handle invalid token (e.g., redirect to error page)
    redirect("/error/invalid-token")
  
end function
```

**Deployment Scenario:**

Imagine a large organization with multiple subsidiaries, each using a different authentication system.  This system allows users to access resources across all subsidiaries using a single, unified access point.  The Contextual Identity Selector intelligently routes users to the appropriate IdP based on their organization, while the URL Masking Proxy provides a consistent user experience.
