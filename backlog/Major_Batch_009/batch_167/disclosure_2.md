## Dynamic Reputation Scoring with Behavioral Weighting

**Concept:** Extend the threat intelligence system to incorporate dynamic reputation scoring for IP addresses and domains, weighted by observed behavioral patterns. This goes beyond static blacklists/whitelists to assess risk based on *how* an entity is behaving, not just *that* it has been seen before.

**Specifications:**

**1. Behavioral Data Collection:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate logs from network traffic analysis (NTA), endpoint detection and response (EDR), and security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
*   **Feature Extraction:**  Identify key behavioral features:
    *   **Connection Rate:** Number of connections initiated per unit time.
    *   **Data Volume:** Amount of data transferred.
    *   **Protocol Mix:** Distribution of protocols used (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, etc.).
    *   **Geographic Diversity:** Number of distinct geographic locations connected to.
    *   **Payload Entropy:** Measure of randomness in data payloads.
    *   **User Agent Diversity:** Variety of user agents used in HTTP requests.
    *   **API Call Frequency/Patterns:** (as noted in the patent) Tracking API requests and flagging anomalies.
*   **Data Normalization:** Normalize all features to a common scale (e.g., 0-1).

**2. Reputation Score Calculation:**

*   **Base Reputation:** Each IP/Domain starts with a neutral reputation score (e.g., 500).
*   **Behavioral Weighting:** Assign weights to each behavioral feature based on its correlation with malicious activity (determined through machine learning analysis of historical data).  Example: High weight to “suspicious payload entropy”, low weight to “common user agent”.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** The reputation score is adjusted based on observed behavior.  
    *   **Positive Adjustment:**  Consistent normal behavior increases the score.
    *   **Negative Adjustment:** Anomalous behavior decreases the score. The magnitude of the adjustment is proportional to the feature weight and the degree of anomaly.
*   **Time Decay:**  Reputation scores decay over time to account for changing circumstances.  Older data has less influence on the current score.
*   **Score Range:** Maintain a defined score range (e.g., 0-1000) where:
    *   0-300: Highly Malicious
    *   301-600: Suspicious
    *   601-900: Neutral/Good
    *   901-1000: Trusted

**3. Integration with Threat Intelligence System:**

*   **Real-time Scoring:** Calculate reputation scores in real-time as network traffic is analyzed.
*   **Correlation with Existing Threat Data:** Combine reputation scores with existing threat intelligence feeds (blacklists, whitelists, vulnerability data).
*   **Adaptive Thresholds:**  Adjust alert thresholds based on reputation scores.  Entities with low scores trigger more sensitive alerts.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Use security analyst feedback (confirmed malicious/benign activity) to refine feature weights and improve the accuracy of the reputation system.

**4. Pseudocode (Reputation Update):**

```
function updateReputation(ipAddress, behavioralData, currentReputation):
    // behavioralData is a dictionary of feature values
    totalWeightedAnomaly = 0

    for feature, value in behavioralData:
        weight = getFeatureWeight(feature) // Fetch weight from ML model
        anomalyScore = calculateAnomalyScore(value) // Based on historical data
        totalWeightedAnomaly += weight * anomalyScore

    reputationChange = totalWeightedAnomaly * 0.1  // Scaling factor
    newReputation = currentReputation + reputationChange

    // Clamp the reputation within the defined range (0-1000)
    newReputation = max(0, min(1000, newReputation))

    return newReputation
```

**5. Infrastructure Considerations:**

*   **Scalable Data Storage:** Utilize a distributed database (e.g., Cassandra, MongoDB) to store reputation scores and behavioral data.
*   **Real-time Processing:**  Employ a stream processing framework (e.g., Kafka, Apache Flink) to process network traffic in real-time.
*   **Machine Learning Pipeline:**  Establish a pipeline for training and updating the machine learning model used to determine feature weights.
