## Adaptive Feature Interaction Network for Proactive A/B Testing

**Concept:** Extend the causal analysis system to *proactively* suggest A/B tests based on predicted feature interactions *before* any live testing occurs. Instead of simply prioritizing features for testing, the system forecasts which feature *combinations* will yield the largest impact on the target metric, allowing for more efficient experiment design and faster optimization.

**Specifications:**

**1. Feature Interaction Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical data including treatment features, control features, and target metric.
*   **Process:** Employ a neural network architecture specifically designed for detecting feature interactions (e.g., Deep & Cross Network, xDeepFM, AutoInt). This module learns non-linear relationships and interactions between features. The model should be trained to predict the target metric given the feature set.
*   **Output:** A ranked list of feature pairs/combinations with associated predicted impact scores (estimated causal effect).  The score represents the predicted lift in the target metric if the feature combination is activated.

**2.  Causal Effect Propagation Layer:**

*   **Input:** Predicted impact scores from the Feature Interaction Module.
*   **Process:** A layer which leverages the existing causal inference engine (Double ML or RNN) to refine the impact scores. This corrects for potential confounding variables and ensures the predicted impact is truly causal, not merely correlational. Specifically, this layer will model the *interventional distribution* of the target metric given the proposed feature interaction.
*   **Output:** Causal impact scores for each feature interaction.

**3. A/B Test Suggestion Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Causal impact scores, current application state (feature flags, active experiments), business constraints (cost, risk tolerance).
*   **Process:**
    *   Selects top-N feature interactions based on their causal impact score.
    *   Filters interactions based on business rules (e.g., avoid testing features that negatively impact key performance indicators).
    *   Generates an A/B test plan including:
        *   Test name and description
        *   Treatment group (activation of the feature interaction)
        *   Control group (no activation)
        *   Target metric
        *   Sample size and duration
        *   Rollout strategy (percentage-based, cohort-based)
*   **Output:** A prioritized list of A/B test plans ready for implementation.

**4. Continuous Learning Loop:**

*   **Process:** Monitor the results of executed A/B tests.  Use the data to retrain the Feature Interaction Module and the Causal Effect Propagation Layer.  This ensures the system continuously improves its ability to predict impactful feature interactions.  Implement a bandit algorithm to automatically explore and exploit promising feature interactions in a real-time manner.

**Pseudocode (A/B Test Suggestion Engine):**

```
function suggest_ab_tests(impact_scores, business_constraints):
  // Filter out interactions violating business constraints
  filtered_scores = filter(impact_scores, business_constraints)

  // Sort interactions by impact score in descending order
  sorted_scores = sort(filtered_scores, impact_score, descending)

  // Select top-N interactions
  top_n_interactions = take(sorted_interactions, N)

  // Generate A/B test plans
  test_plans = []
  for interaction in top_n_interactions:
    plan = create_ab_test_plan(interaction)
    test_plans.append(plan)

  return test_plans

function create_ab_test_plan(interaction):
  // Define test parameters (name, treatment, control, metric, size, duration)
  plan = {
    "name": interaction.name,
    "treatment": interaction.treatment,
    "control": interaction.control,
    "metric": interaction.metric,
    "size": calculate_sample_size(),
    "duration": calculate_test_duration()
  }
  return plan
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Historical data of application usage, feature activations, and target metrics.
*   User behavior data (e.g., demographics, usage patterns).
*   Feature metadata (e.g., feature description, category).

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased efficiency of A/B testing.
*   Faster optimization of key metrics.
*   Proactive identification of impactful feature interactions.
*   Reduced reliance on manual experimentation.
