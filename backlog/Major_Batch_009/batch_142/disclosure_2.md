## Dynamic HyperLogLog Tiering for Multi-Dimensional Joins

**Concept:** Expand the hyperloglog cardinality estimation approach to handle not just pairwise column relationships, but *n*-dimensional relationships, and optimize resource usage via dynamic tiering based on estimated selectivity.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Structures:**

*   **Multi-Dimensional HyperLogLog (MDHLL):**  An extension of the standard HyperLogLog. Instead of a single set of registers, MDHLL maintains a hierarchical structure of HLLs.
    *   *Root HLL*:  Estimates the cardinality of the entire dataset.
    *   *Tiered HLLs*:  Each tier represents a specific combination of columns. Tier 1 might represent individual columns, Tier 2 represents pairs, Tier 3 triplets, and so on.
    *   *Register Structure*: Each HLL within a tier comprises standard HyperLogLog registers.  Each register stores the maximum observed leading zeros for a hashed value of a composite key (combination of column values).

*   **Selectivity Profile:** A data structure storing estimated selectivity for each column and column combination.

**II. Algorithm:**

1.  **Initial Scan & Tier 0 HLL Creation:**
    *   Perform an initial scan of the data.
    *   Create a Tier 0 HLL representing the cardinality of each individual column. This forms the basis for the selectivity profile.

2.  **Tiered HLL Construction (Adaptive):**
    *   **Iterative Combination:**  Start with Tier 1 (individual columns). For each subsequent tier (Tier 2, Tier 3, etc.):
        *   **Candidate Combination Generation:** Generate candidate combinations of columns based on a heuristic (e.g., data type similarity, correlation analysis).
        *   **Selectivity Estimation:**  Estimate the selectivity of each candidate combination using the existing selectivity profile and the estimated intersection/union of the corresponding HLLs.  
            *   `Selectivity(Combination) = EstimateIntersection(HLL_ColumnA, HLL_ColumnB) / EstimateUnion(HLL_ColumnA, HLL_ColumnB)`
        *   **Tiering Decision:** Based on the estimated selectivity:
            *   *High Selectivity (Low Cardinality)*:  Create a dedicated HLL for this column combination.
            *   *Low Selectivity (High Cardinality)*: Skip creating a dedicated HLL.  Instead, rely on estimations derived from lower tiers. This avoids unnecessary memory consumption.

3.  **Join Path Optimization:**
    *   When determining the optimal join path between tables:
        *   For each potential join condition (column combination):
            *   Check if a dedicated HLL exists for that column combination.
            *   If yes, use the HLL to accurately estimate the join cardinality.
            *   If no, estimate the cardinality by combining estimations from lower-tier HLLs.
        *   Select the join path with the lowest estimated cardinality.

**III. Pseudocode (Join Path Optimization):**

```
function optimizeJoinPath(tableA, tableB, joinConditions):
  bestPath = null
  minEstimatedCardinality = Infinity

  for each condition in joinConditions:
    columns = condition.columns
    
    if dedicatedHLLExists(columns):
      estimatedCardinality = getCardinalityFromHLL(columns)
    else:
      estimatedCardinality = estimateCardinalityFromLowerTiers(columns) // Combine lower tier HLL estimations

    if estimatedCardinality < minEstimatedCardinality:
      minEstimatedCardinality = estimatedCardinality
      bestPath = condition

  return bestPath
```

**IV. Considerations:**

*   **Hashing:** Efficient and consistent hashing is crucial for accurate cardinality estimation.
*   **Memory Management:** Dynamic tiering helps optimize memory usage, but careful memory allocation and deallocation are essential.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to handle large datasets and a large number of columns.
*   **Concurrency:** Implement appropriate locking mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
