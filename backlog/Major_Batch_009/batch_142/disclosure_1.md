## Dynamic Item Bundling & Predictive Desire Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the item transaction system to dynamically bundle items based on *predicted* user desire, going beyond simple item matching. This moves from reacting to expressed needs to proactively anticipating them.

**System Specs:**

*   **Desire Mapping Module:** A continuously learning AI model. Input: Transaction history, user profiles, item attributes, external trend data (social media, news). Output: "Desire Vectors" – multi-dimensional representations of user preferences, *including latent desires* not explicitly stated.  This is updated in real-time.
*   **Bundle Generation Engine:**  This engine takes the Desire Vectors and item catalog as input. It employs a combinatorial optimization algorithm (Genetic Algorithm or Simulated Annealing preferred) to identify item *bundles* that maximize predicted “Desire Score” for a given user. The Desire Score is calculated by summing the dot product of each item’s attribute vector (extracted from item metadata) with the user’s Desire Vector.
*   **Proactive Bundle Presentation:** The system *proactively* presents these predicted bundles to users *before* they actively search for items. Presentation formats include:
    *   “You Might Also Love…” carousel on the homepage
    *   Personalized email campaigns featuring curated bundles
    *   “Complete the Experience” suggestions during item browsing (e.g., “Customers who bought this game also enjoyed…” bundled with accessories and related titles)
*   **Dynamic Pricing & Incentives:** The Bundle Generation Engine also incorporates pricing algorithms. Bundles are dynamically priced to maximize revenue while incentivizing purchase (e.g., offering a small discount for bundled items).
*   **"Wishlist Anticipation" Module:** Monitors user wishlist activity. If a user adds an item to their wishlist, the system can immediately generate and present relevant bundles, leveraging the wishlist item as a seed for prediction.
*   **Feedback Loop:** User interactions with presented bundles (clicks, purchases, dismissals) are fed back into the Desire Mapping Module to refine predictions and improve bundle quality.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Generation Engine):**

```
function generateBundle(user_id, max_bundle_size):
  user_desire_vector = DesireMappingModule.getUserDesireVector(user_id)
  item_catalog = ItemDatabase.getAllItems()
  best_bundle = []
  highest_bundle_score = -1

  for each possible combination of items in item_catalog (up to max_bundle_size):
    bundle_score = 0
    for each item in combination:
      item_attribute_vector = ItemDatabase.getItemAttributeVector(item.item_id)
      bundle_score += dotProduct(user_desire_vector, item_attribute_vector)

    if bundle_score > highest_bundle_score:
      highest_bundle_score = bundle_score
      best_bundle = combination

  return best_bundle
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Detailed item metadata (attributes, tags, categories)
*   User transaction history (purchases, browsing activity, wishlist items)
*   User profile data (demographics, interests, preferences)
*   External data sources (social media trends, news articles, product reviews)

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Increased sales through proactive recommendations.
*   Enhanced user engagement and satisfaction.
*   Discovery of latent user needs and preferences.
*   Improved inventory management through optimized bundle creation.
*   Creation of a more personalized and immersive shopping experience.
