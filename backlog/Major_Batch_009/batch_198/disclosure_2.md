## Dynamic Peripheral Power Allocation & Prioritization

**Concept:** Expand the shared data bus/addressing scheme to actively manage power delivery to peripherals *during* data transmission. Instead of simply selecting a peripheral, the system dynamically adjusts voltage/current *while* data is being sent, optimizing for the specific data being transmitted and the peripheral's immediate needs.

**Specifications:**

*   **Power Supply Units (PSUs):** Each PSU retains the addressing terminal connection as per the original patent, but adds a programmable power stage. This stage allows for voltage *and* current adjustments within defined safety limits. Each PSU will have a dedicated Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) controlled by the power supply controller.
*   **Power Supply Controller (PSC):** The PSC receives the management message *and* a 'power profile' associated with the data message. This profile dictates the optimal voltage/current for the destination peripheral during transmission. The PSC sends a combined ‘address/power’ command to the shared data bus. This command includes the peripheral address *and* the desired voltage/current level (encoded digitally).
*   **Data Bus Enhancement:** Add a dedicated ‘Power Enable’ line to the existing data bus. This line acts as a handshake signal, confirming that the PSU has successfully adjusted power levels before data transmission begins.
*   **Peripheral Response:** Each peripheral includes a voltage/current monitor.  It confirms receipt of the correct power level by asserting a 'Power Ack' signal on a dedicated line *back* to the PSC.  If power levels are incorrect, the peripheral signals an error, and data transmission is halted.
*   **Dynamic Prioritization Algorithm:** The Management Controller incorporates an algorithm that dynamically assigns power prioritization to peripherals based on data urgency and system load. This prioritization influences the power profiles sent to the PSC.

**Pseudocode (Management Controller):**

```
function generatePowerProfile(dataMessage, destinationPeripheral):
  urgency = dataMessage.urgencyLevel // High, Medium, Low
  peripheralType = destinationPeripheral.type // e.g., SSD, Fan, Sensor

  if (peripheralType == "SSD" and urgency == "High"):
    voltage = 12.0
    current = 5.0
  elif (peripheralType == "Fan" and urgency == "High"):
    voltage = 5.0
    current = 2.0
  else:
    voltage = destinationPeripheral.defaultVoltage
    current = destinationPeripheral.defaultCurrent

  powerProfile = {
    voltage: voltage,
    current: current
  }
  return powerProfile
```

**Pseudocode (PSC - combined address/power command):**

```
function sendCombinedCommand(address, powerProfile):
  command = {
    address: address,
    voltage: powerProfile.voltage,
    current: powerProfile.current
  }
  serializeCommand(command) // Convert to bitstream for data bus
  sendBitstream(bitstream)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-speed DACs for precise voltage/current control.
*   Robust power regulation circuitry within each PSU.
*   Error detection and correction mechanisms for data bus communication.
*   Safety features to prevent over-voltage/over-current conditions.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced power consumption.
*   Improved system performance.
*   Enhanced data integrity.
*   Dynamic resource allocation.
*   Real-time power management.
