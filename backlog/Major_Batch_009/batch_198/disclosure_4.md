## Dynamic Power Islanding & Predictive Load Shedding

**Concept:** Extend the power disturbance detection system to not only *identify* issues but proactively isolate affected zones ("power islands") and predictively shed non-critical loads *before* a complete failure, maximizing uptime for critical infrastructure.

**Specs:**

*   **Power Island Controller (PIC):** A software module residing on the existing computer system. Receives real-time data from all networked power meters and implements islanding logic.
*   **Zone Definition:** The datacenter is logically partitioned into "zones" based on power meter topology and pre-defined criticality levels. Each zone represents a potential power island. Critical zones (e.g., core servers) have higher priority.
*   **Islanding Logic:**
    *   When a disturbance is detected within a zone, the PIC initiates a staged disconnect of that zone from the main power grid via intelligent circuit breakers.
    *   The PIC leverages local uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) and/or backup generators within the zone to maintain power during the transition and for a defined period.
    *   Transition time targets: < 50ms for critical zones, < 500ms for non-critical zones.
*   **Predictive Load Shedding:**
    *   The PIC analyzes historical power data, real-time load, and disturbance patterns to predict potential overload scenarios *before* they occur.
    *   Based on these predictions, the PIC proactively sheds non-critical loads within zones to prevent cascading failures.
    *   Load shedding prioritization: based on pre-defined rules (e.g., deferrable tasks, non-essential services).
*   **Adaptive Learning:** The system continuously learns from past events and adjusts its islanding and load shedding strategies accordingly.
*   **Communication Protocol:** PIC communicates with intelligent circuit breakers and load controllers via a secure, low-latency network protocol (e.g., Modbus TCP/IP, IEC 61850).

**Pseudocode (PIC â€“ core logic):**

```
// Global variables
zone_map: Dictionary (zone_id -> zone_data)
power_data: Dictionary (power_meter_id -> power_data)
disturbance_data: List (disturbance_events)

// Initialization
load zone_map from configuration file
populate power_data from network scan

// Main Loop
while true:
    receive power_data updates
    receive disturbance_data updates

    for each disturbance in disturbance_data:
        zone_id = disturbance.zone_id
        disturbance_type = disturbance.type

        if disturbance_type == "critical":
            // Initiate islanding procedure for zone_id
            isolate_zone(zone_id)
        else if disturbance_type == "warning":
            // Predict potential overload
            predicted_load = calculate_predicted_load(zone_id)
            if predicted_load > zone_map[zone_id].capacity:
                // Initiate load shedding
                shed_non_critical_loads(zone_id)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Intelligent Circuit Breakers: Equipped with remote control and monitoring capabilities.
*   Load Controllers: Capable of remotely switching on/off non-critical loads.
*   Dedicated Network Infrastructure: For low-latency communication between PIC, circuit breakers, and load controllers.

**Further Development:**

*   Integration with AI-powered forecasting models to improve prediction accuracy.
*   Self-healing capabilities: Automatic re-establishment of power connections after disturbances subside.
*   Distributed PIC architecture: Deploying PIC instances at multiple locations within the datacenter for increased resilience and scalability.
