## Dynamic Network Persona Generation & Predictive Resilience

**Concept:** Augment the network monitoring system with the ability to generate ‘network personas’ – probabilistic models representing the expected behavior of logical devices under various stress conditions – and proactively adjust network configurations to enhance resilience *before* failures occur.

**Inspiration:** The patent focuses on *reactively* assessing network health based on current state. This builds on that by shifting towards *predictive* health and preemptive optimization.

**Specs:**

**1. Persona Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical network telemetry data (bandwidth usage, latency, error rates, device CPU/memory load, application traffic patterns) segmented by logical device.
*   **Process:** Employ a Bayesian Network or Hidden Markov Model to construct a probabilistic representation of each logical device’s ‘normal’ operational state.  This model should capture correlations between different metrics (e.g., high CPU load on a router correlates with increased latency on downstream links).  
*   **Output:** A ‘Persona Profile’ for each logical device, containing:
    *   Probability Distributions for key performance indicators (KPIs).
    *   Correlation Matrix detailing relationships between KPIs.
    *   Anomaly Detection Thresholds (dynamically adjusted based on historical variance).
    *   ‘Failure Signature’ – a probabilistic model representing the likely symptom set if a component within the logical device fails.
*   **Implementation Detail:**  Utilize a rolling time window for data analysis to adapt to changing network conditions.  Implement a ‘forgetting factor’ to de-emphasize older data.

**2. Stress Testing & Persona Validation Module:**

*   **Process:** Periodically subject each logical device to simulated stress tests (e.g., increased traffic load, link failures, application surges). This can be done in a sandboxed environment or during off-peak hours.
*   **Data Collection:** Monitor the logical device's performance during stress tests.
*   **Persona Refinement:**  Compare the observed behavior to the predicted behavior based on the Persona Profile.  Adjust the Persona Profile to minimize the discrepancy. Employ a Kalman filter for continuous adaptation.

**3. Predictive Resilience Engine:**

*   **Input:** Current network state, Persona Profiles for all logical devices, Predicted future load (based on historical patterns, scheduled events, and real-time traffic analysis).
*   **Process:**
    *   **Scenario Simulation:**  Simulate various failure scenarios (e.g., link outage, device failure) for each logical device.
    *   **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the impact of each scenario on overall network performance.  (e.g. using the failure signature to estimate the outcome.)
    *   **Proactive Optimization:** Dynamically adjust network configurations to mitigate the potential impact of failures. This could include:
        *   Traffic rerouting
        *   Bandwidth allocation adjustments
        *   Virtual machine migration
        *   Quality of Service (QoS) policy changes
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
for each logical_device in network:
    for each potential_failure in failure_signatures(logical_device):
        simulated_impact = simulate_failure(logical_device, potential_failure)
        if simulated_impact > acceptable_threshold:
            optimization_plan = generate_optimization_plan(logical_device, simulated_impact)
            apply_optimization_plan(optimization_plan)
```

**4. Tiered Persona Model:**

*   Introduce the concept of ‘aggregate personas’ representing the combined behavior of multiple logical devices within a tier.
*   Allows for more efficient resilience planning at a higher level of abstraction.

**5. Alerting and Visualization:**

*   Develop a dashboard to visualize network personas, predicted risks, and implemented optimizations.
*   Generate alerts when predicted risks exceed acceptable thresholds.
