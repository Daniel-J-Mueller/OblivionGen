## Dynamic Narrative Construction via MAB-Driven Storytelling

**Concept:** Expand the multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework beyond simple content selection to dynamically construct branching narratives. Instead of optimizing for immediate cancellation/retention, the MABs will optimize for *narrative engagement* – measured by user interaction (time spent, clicks, responses). This shifts the focus from purely transactional outcomes to building a more immersive, personalized experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Narrative Units:** Define granular “Narrative Units” (NUs) – short blocks of text, image, video, or interactive elements. Each NU has associated metadata:
    *   **Emotional Valence:** (e.g., positive, negative, neutral, suspenseful)
    *   **Topic Tags:** (e.g., “account benefits”, “security concerns”, “feature explanation”)
    *   **Narrative Hooks:** (keywords or phrases suggesting potential follow-up NUs)
*   **MAB Structure:**
    *   Each “page” in the sequence (cancellation flow) is associated with a dedicated MAB.
    *   Each "arm" in the MAB represents a distinct NU.
    *   Multiple MABs, one per “page” – each page can have its own contextual MAB.
*   **Reward Function:**
    *   **Primary Reward:** User engagement time on the page.
    *   **Secondary Rewards:**
        *   Click-through rate on specific elements within the NU.
        *   User responses to interactive prompts (e.g., polls, open-ended questions).
        *   Completion of micro-tasks (e.g., watching a short video, completing a form field).
*   **Contextual Features:**
    *   **User Profile Data:** (demographics, usage history, account status)
    *   **Previous NU Selection:** The ID of the NU presented on the previous page.
    *   **Current Page Number:** Indicates position in the cancellation flow.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Real-time sentiment analysis of user input (if available) to tailor NU selection.
*   **Narrative Coherence Engine:** A rule-based system designed to maintain a semblance of narrative coherence:
    *   **Hook Matching:** Prioritizes NUs whose "Narrative Hooks" match keywords from the previous NU.
    *   **Sentiment Transition Rules:** Enforces rules about how sentiment should transition between NUs (e.g., avoid abruptly shifting from positive to negative).
    *   **Topic Diversification:** Encourages the system to explore a variety of topics to prevent redundancy.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initialization:** Create MABs for each page, populating arms with available NUs.
    2.  **NU Selection:** For each page, select an NU arm based on the current MAB policy (e.g., epsilon-greedy, Thompson sampling).
    3.  **Presentation:** Display the selected NU to the user.
    4.  **Reward Calculation:** Measure user engagement time and other secondary rewards.
    5.  **MAB Update:** Update the MAB based on the observed rewards, adjusting arm probabilities.
    6.  **Contextual Feature Input:** Input contextual features to the MAB.
    7.  **Narrative Coherence Check:** Apply the Narrative Coherence Engine to ensure the selected NU fits the overall narrative. If necessary, override the MAB selection with a more coherent option.
    8.  **Repeat Steps 2-7 for each page in the sequence.**

**Pseudocode (MAB Update - Thompson Sampling Example):**

```
//For each arm 'a' in the MAB
alpha_a = observed_reward_a + 1 //prior successes
beta_a = number_of_times_arm_a_was_shown - observed_reward_a + 1 //prior failures

//Sample from the Beta distribution
theta_a = random_beta(alpha_a, beta_a)

//Select the arm with the highest sampled value
selected_arm = argmax(theta_a)
```

**Potential Outcomes:**

*   Highly personalized cancellation flows that adapt to user behavior in real-time.
*   Increased user engagement and potentially reduced cancellation rates.
*   A more positive brand experience, even during a cancellation process.
*   Data-driven insights into user preferences and motivations.
