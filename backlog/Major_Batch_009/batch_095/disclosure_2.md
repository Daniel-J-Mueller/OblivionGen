## Dynamic Packet Shadowing & Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the internal/external testing modes beyond simple validation of packet content & routing. Implement a "shadowing" system where *all* packets (test & non-test) traversing the device are mirrored and reconstructed in a dedicated, isolated processing pipeline. This allows for real-time, non-intrusive analysis of network traffic *as it happens*, without impacting forward performance.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Dedicated hardware block ("Shadow Engine") consisting of:
    *   High-speed packet capture module (integrated with ingress/egress ports).
    *   Large, high-bandwidth internal buffer (DDR6+).  Minimum 64GB, scalable.
    *   Dedicated processing cores (RISC-V preferred) for packet reconstruction & analysis.
    *   DMA engine for efficient data transfer between ports, buffer, and processing cores.
*   **Software:**
    *   Kernel module to control Shadow Engine.
    *   API to access reconstructed packets & analysis results.
    *   Configuration options:
        *   Shadowing mode (always on, triggered by specific events, triggered by packet type).
        *   Capture filters (based on port, VLAN, IP address, protocol, etc.).
        *   Reconstruction level (full packet, header only, payload only).
        *   Analysis plugins (user-definable).
*   **Operation:**
    1.  The Shadow Engine passively mirrors all traffic based on configured filters.
    2.  Mirrored packets are stored in the internal buffer.
    3.  Dedicated processing cores reconstruct the packets.  This includes reassembling fragmented packets, handling out-of-order packets, and potentially performing deep packet inspection.
    4.  Analysis plugins process the reconstructed packets.  Examples:
        *   Anomaly detection.
        *   Malware signature scanning.
        *   Performance monitoring.
        *   Traffic profiling.
        *   Debugging & troubleshooting.
    5.  Results are made available via the API.
*   **Pseudocode (Analysis Plugin Interface):**

```
PluginHandle loadPlugin(const char* pluginPath);
void unloadPlugin(PluginHandle handle);
bool processPacket(PluginHandle handle, Packet* packet);
void getStats(PluginHandle handle, Stats* stats);

//Struct definitions
typedef struct {
    uint32_t magic; //For sanity check
    uint32_t length;
    uint8_t data[]; //Variable length
} Packet;

typedef struct {
    uint32_t anomalyCount;
    uint32_t malwareDetected;
    uint64_t totalBytesProcessed;
} Stats;
```

*   **Novelty:** This goes beyond standard packet checking. It allows for *real-time, non-intrusive analysis* of all network traffic, including legitimate production traffic. The mirrored packets create a “shadow” of the network environment, which can be used for security, performance monitoring, and troubleshooting *without impacting forward performance*. The API allows for flexible integration with custom analysis tools and plugins. It isn’t just checking – it's creating a dynamically reconstructed network image.
*   **Scalability:** The Shadow Engine can be scaled by increasing the size of the internal buffer and adding more processing cores. Multiple Shadow Engines can be deployed in parallel to handle higher traffic volumes.
*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Intrusion detection & prevention.
    *   Network performance monitoring & optimization.
    *   Security forensics & incident response.
    *   Debugging & troubleshooting complex network issues.
    *   Real-time traffic analysis for application performance management.
