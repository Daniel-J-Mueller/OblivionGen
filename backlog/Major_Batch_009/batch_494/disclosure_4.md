**Adaptive Scene Point Density & Trajectory Weighting for Dynamic Foreground Detection**

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on static scene point selection and trajectory analysis. This builds on that by dynamically adjusting scene point density and weighting trajectories based on observed motion and scene complexity. The goal is to improve foreground detection accuracy in challenging scenarios like fast motion, low-light conditions, or scenes with repetitive patterns.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Scene Complexity Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Video frame data.
    *   Process: Employ a spatial frequency analysis (e.g., using a Fast Fourier Transform) to determine the level of detail and complexity within each frame.  Higher spatial frequency indicates more complex textures and edges.  Calculate a “Complexity Score” for the frame.
    *   Output: Complexity Score (0-1, 1 being the most complex).

2.  **Adaptive Scene Point Generation:**
    *   Input: Video frame data, Complexity Score.
    *   Process:
        *   Base Density: Establish a base scene point density (e.g., 1 point per 10x10 pixel area).
        *   Density Adjustment:  Dynamically adjust the scene point density based on the Complexity Score.  Higher Complexity Score results in higher density (e.g., linearly scale density up to 1 point per 5x5 pixel area).
        *   Point Distribution: Utilize a Poisson disk sampling algorithm to distribute scene points evenly across the frame, ensuring minimum distance between points.
    *   Output: Set of scene point locations.

3.  **Motion-Weighted Trajectory Analysis:**
    *   Input: Scene point trajectories (calculated as in the original patent), current frame, previous frame.
    *   Process:
        *   Optical Flow Calculation: Compute dense optical flow between the current and previous frames using a robust algorithm (e.g., Farnebäck).
        *   Trajectory Weighting:  Assign a weight to each scene point trajectory based on the magnitude of the optical flow at that point. Higher optical flow magnitude indicates faster motion and greater importance for foreground detection. Normalize the weights to sum to 1.
        *   Weighted Vector Subspace Generation:  When generating the vector subspace, use the weighted scene point trajectories as basis vectors. The weighting emphasizes the contributions of trajectories associated with greater motion.
    *   Output: Weighted vector subspace.

4.  **Dynamic Projection Error Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Projection error, trajectory weight, displacement of the scene point (as in the original patent).
    *   Process: Dynamically adjust the projection error threshold based on trajectory weight and displacement. The higher the weight and displacement, the larger the allowable projection error. This allows for greater tolerance of motion and displacement while still accurately identifying foreground objects.
    *   Output: Adjusted projection error threshold.

5.  **Foreground Pixel Listing Refinement:**
    *   Input: Foreground pixel listing, adjusted projection error threshold.
    *   Process: Refine the foreground pixel listing by removing pixels with projection errors below the adjusted threshold.
    *   Output: Final foreground pixel listing.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
baseDensity = 10x10
complexityThreshold = 0.5

//Per Frame Processing
calculateComplexityScore(frame)
adjustedDensity = baseDensity * (1 + complexityScore) //adjust based on complexity
generateScenePoints(frame, adjustedDensity)

for each scenePoint in scenePoints:
    calculateTrajectory(scenePoint)
    opticalFlowMagnitude = calculateOpticalFlow(scenePoint)
    trajectoryWeight = normalize(opticalFlowMagnitude) // Normalize weights
    
    weightedBasisVectors.add(trajectoryWeight * trajectory)

    projectionError = calculateProjectionError(scenePoint, weightedBasisVectors)
    adjustedThreshold = calculateAdjustedThreshold(displacement, trajectoryWeight)
    
    if projectionError > adjustedThreshold:
        addPixelToForegroundList(scenePoint)
