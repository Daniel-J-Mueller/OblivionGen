## Adaptive Frequency Chunking with Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Enhance multi-DSP core audio processing by dynamically adjusting frequency chunk sizes transmitted between cores, paired with a predictive buffering system that anticipates processing load and pre-fetches data. This goes beyond static buffer allocation and bit rate configuration, aiming to maximize DSP utilization and minimize latency, particularly in scenarios with varying audio complexity.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Compatible with multi-core DSP architectures. Requires communication channels with configurable bandwidth and low latency.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   *Complexity Analyzer:*  Analyzes incoming time-domain audio data to determine its spectral complexity (e.g., number of prominent frequencies, harmonic content, transient events). Outputs a 'complexity score'.
    *   *Chunk Size Manager:* Dynamically adjusts the size of frequency chunks sent between DSP cores based on the complexity score. Higher complexity = smaller chunks (more frequent updates, finer granularity); lower complexity = larger chunks (increased throughput).
    *   *Predictive Buffer:*  Utilizes a short-term prediction model (e.g., Kalman filter, LSTM) to anticipate future complexity scores based on recent history. This allows the buffer to pre-fetch frequency chunks *before* they are fully processed, minimizing latency.
    *   *Buffer Synchronization Module:*  Manages buffer synchronization between DSP cores, handling potential buffer overflows or underflows caused by dynamic chunk size adjustments.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Complexity Analysis:** Input time-domain data is fed into the Complexity Analyzer, which generates a complexity score.
    2.  **Chunk Size Selection:** The Chunk Size Manager maps the complexity score to a specific frequency chunk size. A lookup table or a learned function can be used for this mapping.
    3.  **Predictive Buffering:** The Predictive Buffer uses the complexity score history to predict the future complexity. Based on this prediction, it proactively requests frequency chunks from the upstream DSP core.
    4.  **Data Transmission:** Frequency chunks are transmitted between DSP cores using a communication link with a configurable bit rate.
    5.  **Buffer Synchronization:** The Buffer Synchronization Module monitors buffer levels and adjusts data transmission rates to prevent overflows or underflows.

**Pseudocode (Chunk Size Manager):**

```
FUNCTION DetermineChunkSize(complexityScore):
  IF complexityScore > 0.8:
    chunkSize = 64 // Smallest chunk size - high complexity
  ELSE IF complexityScore > 0.5:
    chunkSize = 128
  ELSE IF complexityScore > 0.2:
    chunkSize = 256
  ELSE:
    chunkSize = 512 // Largest chunk size - low complexity
  RETURN chunkSize
```

**Potential Improvements:**

*   **Adaptive Bit Rate Control:** Dynamically adjust the communication link's bit rate based on the selected chunk size and available bandwidth.
*   **Priority-Based Chunking:** Prioritize transmission of frequency chunks corresponding to critical audio features (e.g., speech, transients).
*   **Multi-Level Buffering:** Implement a hierarchical buffering system with multiple buffers of varying sizes to handle different levels of audio complexity.
*   **Machine Learning Integration:** Train a machine learning model to predict optimal chunk sizes and bit rates based on historical audio data and system performance metrics.
