## Adaptive Subscription Granularity & Predictive Fan-Out

**Concept:** Expand the fan-out concept beyond simple field combinations to dynamically adjust subscription granularity *based on predicted user interest*. This moves beyond reactive notification to *proactive* information delivery, minimizing noise and maximizing relevance.

**Specifications:**

**1. User Interest Modeling Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Historical mutation data (what data has the user previously subscribed to/interacted with?)
    *   User profile data (demographics, stated preferences, roles)
    *   Real-time interaction data (clicks, views, dwell time on specific data elements)
*   **Model:** A hybrid approach combining:
    *   **Collaborative Filtering:** Identify users with similar subscription patterns.
    *   **Content-Based Filtering:** Analyze the *content* of the mutations to understand user preferences.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Reward/penalize predictions based on user engagement with delivered data.
*   **Output:**  A dynamic “interest profile” for each user, expressed as a weighted vector representing the likelihood of interest in specific data fields/combinations.

**2. Predictive Fan-Out Engine:**

*   **Integration Point:**  Sits between the data proxy and the messaging service.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Receive mutation results from the data proxy.
    2.  For each user with relevant subscriptions:
        a.  Calculate a "relevance score" based on the mutation results and the user's interest profile.
        b.  Dynamically adjust the granularity of the fan-out. This can include:
            *   **Full Fan-Out:** Send all relevant fields (default for high relevance).
            *   **Partial Fan-Out:** Send only the *most* relevant fields (for medium relevance).
            *   **Summarized Fan-Out:** Send a summarized version of the data, highlighting key changes (for low relevance).
            *    **Suppression:**  Suppress the notification entirely if relevance is below a threshold.
    3.  Send the tailored message to the messaging service.

**3. Adaptive Schema Management:**

*   Support schema evolution without breaking existing subscriptions.
*   New fields are automatically added to the interest profile and incorporated into relevance scoring.
*   Deprecated fields are flagged and gradually removed from the system, adjusting user interest profiles accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Fan-Out Engine):**

```
function processMutation(mutationResults, userSubscriptions) {
  for each user in userSubscriptions {
    relevanceScore = calculateRelevanceScore(mutationResults, user.interestProfile)
    if relevanceScore > thresholdHigh {
      message = createFullFanOutMessage(mutationResults)
    } else if relevanceScore > thresholdMedium {
      message = createPartialFanOutMessage(mutationResults, user.interestProfile)
    } else if relevanceScore > thresholdLow {
      message = createSummarizedFanOutMessage(mutationResults)
    } else {
      // Suppress notification
      continue
    }
    sendMessageToMessagingService(message, user)
  }
}

function calculateRelevanceScore(mutationResults, interestProfile) {
  // Implement scoring algorithm using weighted vector comparison,
  // considering field matches and profile weights
  // (e.g., dot product, cosine similarity)
  // Return a score between 0 and 1
}

function createFullFanOutMessage(mutationResults) {
  // Create a message containing all relevant fields from mutationResults
}

function createPartialFanOutMessage(mutationResults, interestProfile) {
  // Select only the most relevant fields based on interestProfile
}

function createSummarizedFanOutMessage(mutationResults) {
  // Generate a summarized version of the data
}

```

**Scalability Considerations:**

*   Interest profiles should be cached to minimize computation.
*   Relevance scoring should be optimized for performance.
*   Message summarization should be handled asynchronously.
*   Utilize distributed message queues for high throughput.
