## Modular Debris Sorting & Repurposing Drive Unit

**Concept:** Expand the debris collection functionality of the drive unit to include onboard sorting and rudimentary repurposing of collected materials. This moves beyond simple collection to a closed-loop system within the inventory management environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Modular Collection & Sorting System:**

*   **Debris Intake:** Existing blower/duct system modified to accept interchangeable intake modules. Modules optimized for different debris types (e.g., cardboard, plastic film, dust/particles).
*   **Multi-Stage Filtration:**  Beyond particulate filtering, integrate a series of progressively finer mesh filters/cyclonic separators post-intake. 
*   **Sensor Array:** Install a multi-spectral sensor array (visible light, near-infrared) after filtration to identify debris composition.  Data fed to onboard processor.
*   **Diverter Mechanisms:**  Small pneumatic/servo-actuated diverters to route sorted debris into dedicated storage bins.
*   **Bin Capacity Sensors:**  Ultrasonic/optical sensors to monitor fill levels of each bin.

**2. Onboard Repurposing Module (Optional - scalable)**

*   **Compaction/Shredding:**  For cardboard/plastic film, include a small compaction/shredding unit. Output is compressed material.
*   **Heating Element/Binder:** If appropriate (e.g. plastic film), a small heating element & eco-friendly binder (plant-based resin) to create rudimentary "bricks" or blocks.  These could be used for minor repairs within the inventory system (e.g. filling small gaps).
*   **Forming Chamber:** Small, temperature-controlled forming chamber for the binding/shaping process.

**3. Control System & Integration:**

*   **Path Planning Integration:**  Modify path planning algorithms to incorporate “debris hotspot” data. The drive unit can proactively target areas identified as requiring cleaning.
*   **Bin Full Alerts:**  Transmit alerts to central management system when storage bins are nearing capacity.
*   **Remote Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of debris composition & volume via central management system.
*   **Self-Maintenance Routines:** Automated routines to clear clogged filters and optimize airflow.

**Pseudocode (Simplified - Debris Sorting):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessDebris():
    INPUT: DebrisStream
    OUTPUT: SortedDebrisBins

    AnalyzeDebrisComposition(DebrisStream) -> DebrisType, ConfidenceLevel

    IF DebrisType == "Cardboard" AND ConfidenceLevel > 0.8:
        RouteDebrisToBin("CardboardBin")
    ELSE IF DebrisType == "PlasticFilm" AND ConfidenceLevel > 0.8:
        RouteDebrisToBin("PlasticBin")
    ELSE:
        RouteDebrisToBin("GeneralWasteBin")

    MonitorBinLevels()
    IF BinFull("CardboardBin"):
        TransmitAlert("CardboardBinFull")

    RETURN SortedDebrisBins
```

**Materials:**

*   Lightweight, high-strength polymer chassis for modular components.
*   Stainless steel/corrosion-resistant alloys for internal mechanisms.
*   Eco-friendly, biodegradable binding agents.
