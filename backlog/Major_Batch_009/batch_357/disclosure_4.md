## Dynamic Subtitle 'Mood' Generation

**Concept:** Extend subtitle presentation beyond simple text and timing. Leverage AI to analyze video content (visuals *and* audio) and dynamically adjust subtitle styling – not just color/font, but also subtle animations, outlines, and 'glow' effects – to reinforce the emotional tone of a scene.

**Specs:**

*   **Module 1: Sentiment/Emotion Analysis Engine:**
    *   *Input:* Video stream (audio + video frames).
    *   *Process:* Employ a multi-modal AI (combining computer vision and audio analysis) to identify dominant emotions/sentiment in each scene/shot. This includes recognizing facial expressions, vocal tone, background music, color palettes, and scene content (e.g., a chase scene evokes excitement).
    *   *Output:*  Emotion vector (e.g., [Excitement: 0.8, Sadness: 0.1, Anger: 0.2]).  Also, confidence score for the overall emotion determination.

*   **Module 2: Subtitle Styling Library:**
    *   A database of pre-defined subtitle styles associated with different emotion profiles. Examples:
        *   **Excitement:**  Bright, saturated colors (yellow, orange), subtle pulsating glow, fast fade-in/out transitions, slightly italicized font.
        *   **Sadness:**  Desaturated blues/greys, soft outline, slow fade-in/out, rounded font.
        *   **Anger:**  Red/dark orange, sharp outline, quick, jerky transitions, bold, aggressive font.
        *   **Mystery:** Dark blues/purples, subtle shadow effect, elongated font, slow reveal.
    *   Each style includes parameters for: Color, Font, Outline/Shadow, Animation (fade, scale, position), Opacity, Blur.

*   **Module 3: Dynamic Styling Engine:**
    *   *Input:* Emotion vector (from Module 1), Current subtitle text, Current frame number/scene context.
    *   *Process:*
        1.  Map the emotion vector to a corresponding subtitle style from the Styling Library. This mapping can be a weighted average, or a rule-based system.
        2.  Apply the selected style to the current subtitle text.
        3.  Implement smoothing/interpolation to avoid jarring style transitions between consecutive subtitles.  A short crossfade/animation between styles.
        4.  Add a ‘subtlety’ parameter to control the intensity of the styling effects. (User Adjustable)
        5.  Implement a 'safe mode' which disables dynamic styling if the confidence score from the Sentiment Analysis Engine is low (prevents inaccurate styling).

*   **Module 4:  Scene Context Integration:**
    *   The Dynamic Styling Engine should also consider the broader scene context:
        *   **Character Focus:** If a character is speaking, the subtitle style should reflect their emotional state *and* their visual prominence in the frame.
        *   **Environmental Factors:**  Dark, shadowy scenes should trigger darker subtitle styles.  Bright, sunny scenes should trigger brighter styles.
        *   **Music:** Analyze the soundtrack to further refine the emotional profile and style selection.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Styling Engine):**

```
function apply_dynamic_styling(subtitle_text, emotion_vector, confidence_score, frame_number):
  if confidence_score < threshold:
    return default_subtitle_style

  selected_style = map_emotion_to_style(emotion_vector)

  #Consider Scene Context – example
  if is_dark_scene(frame_number):
    darken_style(selected_style)

  # Smooth Transition
  if last_style != null:
      interpolated_style = interpolate(last_style, selected_style, transition_speed)
      return interpolated_style

  return selected_style
```

**Output Format:**  Subtitle file (e.g., SRT, VTT) with added styling information. (e.g., `<style class="subtitle-style">color: #FF0000; text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #000000</style>`)
