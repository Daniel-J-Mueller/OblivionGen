## Personalized Conversational "Moodscapes"

**Core Concept:** Extend the dialog act selection beyond functional task completion to proactively curate immersive, emotionally resonant conversational experiences – "Moodscapes" – tailored to user context and preference.  Rather than just *responding* to requests, the system anticipates and builds conversational atmospheres.

**Specifications:**

**1. Moodscape Definition & Library:**

*   **Data Structure:** A Moodscape is defined by a directed graph. Nodes represent conversational states (e.g., topic, emotional tone, pacing). Edges represent transitions between states, weighted by probability and associated with specific dialog acts (questions, statements, sound effects, music snippets).
*   **Moodscape Categories:** Predefined categories (e.g., "Relaxing Evening", "Energetic Morning", "Creative Inspiration", “Nostalgic Remembrance”) with associated Moodscape graphs.  These serve as templates.
*   **Dynamic Moodscape Generation:** Ability to algorithmically generate Moodscapes based on user-defined parameters (e.g., “a conversation that feels like a warm campfire”, “a discussion that sparks curiosity”). Utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize graph structures and content.

**2. Contextual Awareness & Mood Profile:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:** Integrates data from smart speakers (audio tone, speaking rate), wearable devices (heart rate, skin conductance), calendar events, location data, and historical conversation logs.
*   **Mood Inference Engine:** Utilizes machine learning to infer the user's current emotional state (e.g., happy, stressed, bored, curious).  This isn't about *detecting* mood, but building a probabilistic *profile* over time.
*   **Preference Learning:** Tracks user responses (verbal cues, pauses, topic changes) within Moodscapes to refine preference models.  Reinforcement learning is employed to optimize Moodscape selection and transitions.

**3. Dialog Act Selection & Orchestration:**

*   **Mood-Aware Scoring:**  Extends the existing dialog act scoring system.  Each dialog act is assigned a "Mood Affinity" score for each defined mood category. The score is multiplied by the existing probability score to produce a combined score.
*   **Moodscape Navigation:** When initiating a conversation, the system selects a Moodscape (either pre-defined or dynamically generated) based on the user's Mood Profile and context.
*   **Proactive Transitions:**  Rather than passively awaiting user responses, the system *proactively* transitions between conversational states within the selected Moodscape, based on pre-defined rules and learned user preferences.  This creates a sense of conversational flow and immersion.
*   **Multi-Sensory Integration:**  Coordinates dialog act delivery with other sensory outputs (e.g., ambient lighting, music playback, smart home device control) to enhance the Moodscape experience.

**4.  Implementation Pseudocode (Core Navigation Logic):**

```
function NavigateMoodscape(userContext, currentMoodscapeState) {
  // Get list of possible next states based on current state
  nextStates = GetNextStates(currentMoodscapeState)

  // Calculate scores for each next state
  for each state in nextStates {
    score = CalculateStateScore(state, userContext)
    scoredStates.add(state, score)
  }

  // Apply Randomization Policy (Softmax Exploration)
  probabilities = Softmax(scoredStates.scores)
  nextState = SelectState(probabilities)

  // Select Dialog Act for Transition
  dialogAct = SelectDialogAct(nextState)

  // Orchestrate Multi-Sensory Output (Optional)
  OrchestrateSensoryOutput(dialogAct)

  return dialogAct, nextState
}

function CalculateStateScore(state, userContext) {
  moodAffinity = state.moodAffinityFor(userContext.currentMood)
  probability = state.transitionProbability
  score = moodAffinity * probability * userContext.preferenceWeight
  return score
}
```

**5.  Expansion:**

*   **Collaborative Moodscapes:**  Allow multiple users to co-create and experience Moodscapes together.
*   **Moodscape Marketplace:**  Enable users to share and monetize their custom-created Moodscapes.
*   **Adaptive Moodscape Complexity:** Dynamically adjust the complexity of the Moodscape based on user engagement and cognitive load.  A simple Moodscape for a stressed user, a complex one for a curious user.
*   **Integration with Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Extend Moodscapes into immersive VR/AR experiences.
