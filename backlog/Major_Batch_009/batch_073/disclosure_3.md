## Dynamic Suggestion Sculpting via Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Augment text suggestion interfaces with localized haptic feedback, shaping suggestions into a tangible, explorable "landscape" for the user. This moves beyond visual arrangement and font scaling to create a more intuitive and efficient selection process.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Grid:** Integrate a low-profile haptic grid (piezoelectric actuators or similar) directly beneath the suggestion display area. Resolution: minimum 20 actuators/inch<sup>2</sup>.
*   **Suggestion Mapping:**
    *   Confidence Score -> Height: Higher confidence suggestions rise higher above the grid surface.
    *   Suggestion Type -> Texture:
        *   Correction Type: Smooth, polished texture.
        *   Common Base Portion Type: Slightly rough, granular texture.
        *   Completion Type: Pulsating, rhythmic texture.
    *   Semantic Similarity -> Proximity: Suggestions with higher semantic similarity are placed closer together on the grid.  Calculate similarity using word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) or contextual embeddings (BERT, etc.).
*   **User Interaction:**
    *   Proximity Detection: Utilize infrared or ultrasonic sensors to detect the user’s finger(s) hovering above the grid.
    *   Dynamic Sculpting: As the user’s finger approaches a suggestion, subtly lower its height (creating a “dimple” effect) to provide tactile confirmation and encourage selection.
    *   "Sweep" Mode: Allow the user to "sweep" their finger across the grid. The system highlights suggestions under the finger with increased haptic intensity and visual cues.
    *   Force Feedback: Provide gentle resistance when the user attempts to select a low-confidence suggestion.
*   **Software Implementation:**
    *   Real-time Haptic Rendering Engine: Must render haptic effects with minimal latency (<20ms).
    *   Suggestion Management Module: Integrates with existing text prediction algorithms.
    *   User Profile Management: Adapts haptic feedback parameters based on user preferences and usage patterns.
*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   High-resolution display.
    *   Haptic grid controller.
    *   Proximity sensors.
    *   Processing unit capable of real-time haptic rendering.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Input: List of suggestions (Suggestion object with text, confidence, type)

FOR EACH suggestion IN suggestions:
    height = confidence * scale_factor  // Map confidence to height
    texture = determine_texture(suggestion.type) // Get texture based on suggestion type
    x, y = calculate_position(suggestion, semantic_similarity, grid_size)

    render_haptic_element(x, y, height, texture)

// User Interaction Loop
WHILE user_is_interacting:
    finger_position = get_finger_position()

    IF finger_position is valid:
        closest_suggestion = find_closest_suggestion(finger_position)
        lower_height(closest_suggestion) // Create "dimple" effect

        IF user selects suggestion:
            update_text_entry(suggestion.text)
            break

```

**Innovation Rationale:** Existing text suggestion interfaces are primarily visual. Haptic feedback adds a new dimension to the interaction, allowing users to “feel” their way through suggestions. This can be particularly beneficial for users with visual impairments, or in situations where visual attention is limited (e.g., while driving). The dynamic sculpting effect creates a more engaging and intuitive experience, potentially increasing text entry speed and accuracy.
