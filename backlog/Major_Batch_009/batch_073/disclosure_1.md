## Dynamic Packet Payload Reconstruction with Adaptive Bitfield Handling

**Concept:** Extend the pipeline concept to not just *modify* packets, but to dynamically *reconstruct* payload data based on complex rules and variable bitfield definitions, enabling support for highly flexible and evolving data formats *without* requiring changes to core pipeline logic. This targets scenarios like IoT sensor data with varying precision, software-defined networking with dynamic header extensions, or future-proofing against unknown protocol variations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Definition Language (DDL) – ‘Packet Schema’:**

*   A declarative language (similar to Protocol Buffers or Avro) defining the structure of packet payloads.
*   Includes field names, data types (integer, float, string, boolean, enum), bit offsets, bit lengths, and optional scaling/translation factors.
*   Supports nested structures and arrays.
*   Schema versioning.

**2. Pipeline Stage – ‘Schema Interpreter’:**

*   First stage of the pipeline.  Receives the raw packet bytes and the applicable ‘Packet Schema’ (determined via packet type/identifier).
*   Parses the schema and generates a runtime representation of the payload structure (e.g., a tree of bitfield descriptors).
*   Outputs a ‘Payload Map’ – a data structure representing the extracted payload fields and their values.

**3. Pipeline Stages – ‘Bitfield Extractor & Converter’ (Multiple Instances):**

*   Configurable pipeline stages, dynamically configured by the ‘Payload Map’.
*   Each stage extracts a specific field from the packet, using the bit offset and length specified in the ‘Payload Map’.
*   Applies data type conversion and scaling/translation as needed.
*   Outputs the converted field value to the next stage.

**4. Pipeline Stages – ‘Payload Assembler’:**

*   Collects the extracted and converted field values from the ‘Bitfield Extractor’ stages.
*   Assembles them into a structured data format (e.g., JSON, a custom binary format).
*   Outputs the assembled payload.

**5. Dynamic Configuration & Control Plane:**

*   A control plane component manages the ‘Packet Schemas’ and dynamically configures the pipeline stages based on packet type and schema version.
*   This allows for runtime updates to packet formats without requiring pipeline restarts.
*   A schema registry stores and version controls the schemas.

**Pseudocode (Schema Interpreter):**

```
function interpretSchema(packetBytes, schema):
  payloadMap = new Map()
  schemaRoot = parseSchema(schema) // Parses the schema string

  function processField(fieldDescriptor, currentOffset):
    fieldName = fieldDescriptor.name
    fieldType = fieldDescriptor.type
    bitOffset = fieldDescriptor.bitOffset
    bitLength = fieldDescriptor.bitLength

    // Extract bits from packetBytes based on bitOffset and bitLength
    extractedBits = extractBits(packetBytes, bitOffset, bitLength)

    // Convert bits to appropriate data type
    fieldValue = convertBitsToValue(extractedBits, fieldType)

    payloadMap.put(fieldName, fieldValue)
    return currentOffset + bitLength

  currentOffset = 0
  for fieldDescriptor in schemaRoot.fields:
    currentOffset = processField(fieldDescriptor, currentOffset)

  return payloadMap
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Pipeline stages implemented as dedicated hardware blocks for high throughput.
*   Configurable bit extraction and conversion logic.
*   Fast memory access for packet bytes and configuration data.
*   Support for variable bitfield lengths and offsets.

**Novelty:**

This differs from simply modifying packets. It allows for *complete* payload reconstruction based on a flexible, externally defined schema. This is significantly more powerful than fixed transformations and enables true adaptability to evolving data formats. The dynamic configuration system allows for runtime schema updates without pipeline disruption.
