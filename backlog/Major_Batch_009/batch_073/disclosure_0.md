## Automated Canary Deployment with Predictive Rollback via Synthetic Transactions

**Concept:** Extend the remote testing framework to facilitate automated canary deployments with intelligent rollback capabilities. Leverage synthetic transactions – automated scripts mimicking real user behavior – to proactively assess deployment health *before* and *during* rollout, triggering rollback if anomalies are detected.

**Specs:**

**1. Synthetic Transaction Definition Module:**

*   **Input:**  A YAML or JSON definition file describing the synthetic transaction. Fields include:
    *   `transaction_name`: Unique identifier.
    *   `entrypoint_url`: URL to initiate the transaction.
    *   `steps`: Ordered list of HTTP requests/actions to perform. Each step includes:
        *   `method`: HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
        *   `url`: URL for the request.
        *   `payload`: Request body (JSON, XML, form data).
        *   `expected_response_code`: Expected HTTP status code.
        *   `response_validation`:  JSONPath or regex expressions to validate response content.
    *   `sla_success_threshold`:  Percentage of successful transactions required to consider the deployment healthy.
    *   `error_budget`:  Acceptable number of failed transactions before triggering an alert.
*   **Output:** Parsed transaction definition object.
*   **Functionality:** Loads and validates transaction definitions.

**2. Canary Deployment Controller:**

*   **Input:** Deployment configuration (image, version, rollout percentage), synthetic transaction definitions, target environment.
*   **Output:** Deployment status (running, success, failure).
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  **Initial Rollout:** Deploy a small percentage (e.g., 5%) of traffic to the new version.
    2.  **Synthetic Transaction Execution:**  Initiate synthetic transactions against both the existing and new versions concurrently.
    3.  **Metric Collection:** Aggregate metrics (response time, error rate, transaction success rate) for each version.
    4.  **Anomaly Detection:**
        *   Calculate a baseline for each metric based on historical data from the existing version.
        *   Use statistical methods (e.g., moving average, standard deviation) to detect deviations from the baseline in the new version.
    5.  **Rollout Adjustment:**
        *   If metrics are within acceptable ranges, gradually increase the rollout percentage.
        *   If anomalies are detected:
            *   Pause the rollout.
            *   Trigger an automated rollback to the previous version.
            *   Alert operations team.
    6.  **Predictive Rollback:** Utilize time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) on collected metrics to *predict* potential future anomalies. If the forecast indicates a high probability of failure, initiate a rollback *before* the anomaly actually occurs.

**3. Remote Testing Integration:**

*   Leverage the existing remote testing infrastructure to execute synthetic transactions on both isolated and production environments.
*   Extend the deployment coordinator to manage the execution of synthetic transactions as part of the deployment process.

**Pseudocode (Canary Deployment Controller):**

```
function deploy_canary(deployment_config, transaction_definitions):
  initial_rollout_percentage = 5
  current_rollout_percentage = initial_rollout_percentage

  while current_rollout_percentage <= 100:
    execute_synthetic_transactions(transaction_definitions)
    metrics = collect_metrics()

    if anomaly_detected(metrics):
      rollback_deployment()
      alert_operations()
      return

    if predictive_rollback_triggered(metrics):
      rollback_deployment()
      alert_operations()
      return

    current_rollout_percentage += 5 # Increment rollout percentage
    update_deployment(current_rollout_percentage)

  print("Deployment successful!")
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Sufficient compute resources to execute synthetic transactions concurrently.
*   Scalable monitoring infrastructure to collect and analyze metrics.

**Software Dependencies:**

*   Time-series forecasting library (e.g., Prophet, ARIMA).
*   Statistical analysis library.
*   Monitoring and alerting tools.
