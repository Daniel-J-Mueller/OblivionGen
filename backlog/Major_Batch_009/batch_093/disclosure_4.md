## Dynamic Data Tiering with Predictive Prefetching

**Specification:** Implement a dynamic data tiering system coupled with predictive prefetching, moving beyond simple storage/retrieval to proactively manage data placement and access.

**Core Concept:** Analyze data access patterns, not just frequency, but *contextual* access – what other data is typically accessed *around* a given object. Use this to predict future access and prefetch data to faster storage tiers.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Analyzer (APA):** Monitors all read/write requests, logging not just the object ID but also timestamps, user/application ID, and associated metadata.  Crucially, it tracks *sequences* of accessed objects – the 'access graph'.
*   **Contextual Similarity Engine (CSE):** Compares current access sequences against historical data in the access graph. Uses machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural networks – RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory – LSTM) to identify similar sequences and predict likely next accesses.  Output is a probability distribution of potential next objects.
*   **Tiered Storage Manager (TSM):**  Controls multiple storage tiers (e.g., SSD, NVMe, HDD, tape). The TSM uses the probability distribution from the CSE to intelligently move data between tiers.  High-probability objects are pre-fetched to faster tiers. Low-probability objects are moved to slower, cheaper tiers.
*   **Prefetch Engine:**  Initiates asynchronous data retrieval based on predictions from the CSE and TSM. Prefetched data is cached in a fast-access layer (e.g., DRAM, SSD).
*   **Metadata Store:** Stores the access graph, tier assignments, and prefetch status.

**Pseudocode (TSM – Simplified):**

```
function TierAssignment(objectID):
  metadata = MetadataStore.get(objectID)
  accessProbability = CSE.predictAccessProbability(objectID)
  
  if accessProbability > 0.8:
    tier = "NVMe"
  elif accessProbability > 0.5:
    tier = "SSD"
  elif accessProbability > 0.2:
    tier = "HDD"
  else:
    tier = "Tape"

  MetadataStore.set(objectID, {tier: tier})
  return tier

function HandleAccess(objectID):
  currentTier = MetadataStore.get(objectID).tier
  //Trigger asynchronous data retrieval if in low tier
  if(currentTier != "NVMe" and currentTier != "SSD"):
     prefetch(objectID)
  
  //Update Access pattern Analyzer
  APA.LogAccess(objectID)

```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Access Graph:** Graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to store access sequences. Nodes represent objects, edges represent access order.
*   **Object Metadata:** JSON document containing object ID, tier assignment, access statistics (frequency, recency), predicted access probability.

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on frequency-based tiering. This system introduces *contextual* awareness via the access graph and predictive prefetching, minimizing latency and maximizing throughput.  The asynchronous prefetching further decouples data access from the underlying storage.
