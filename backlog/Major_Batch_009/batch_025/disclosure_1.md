## Dynamic Emotional Color Grading via Biofeedback

**System Specs:**

*   **Input:** Real-time video stream (e.g., from a webcam, game capture, live broadcast). Biofeedback data stream (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial muscle tension) from a wearable sensor or camera-based analysis. Provider metadata (event type, scene context).
*   **Processing Unit:** Dedicated GPU with real-time image processing capabilities. Embedded system for biofeedback data acquisition and pre-processing.
*   **Output:** Modified video stream with dynamically adjusted color grading.

**Innovation Description:**

This system aims to create a deeply immersive and personalized viewing experience by linking the visual presentation of video content to the viewer's emotional state. The core idea is to translate biofeedback data into real-time adjustments to the video’s color grading – shifting hues, saturation, and contrast based on detected emotions.

**Functional Breakdown:**

1.  **Biofeedback Acquisition & Analysis:**  A wearable sensor (or camera) captures physiological data (HRV, skin conductance, facial EMG). This data is processed to determine the viewer’s emotional state (e.g., excitement, relaxation, fear, sadness). A baseline calibration phase is crucial to establish individual responses.  Machine learning models (trained on labeled emotional data) will map physiological signals to emotional states.

2.  **Emotional Mapping to Color Grading:**  A predefined mapping table links emotional states to specific color grading parameters.  For example:
    *   High Excitement: Increased saturation, warmer tones, fast color cycling.
    *   Relaxation: Desaturated colors, cooler tones, slow, subtle color shifts.
    *   Fear:  High contrast, desaturation, shift towards colder hues (blues, grays).
    *   Sadness: Muted colors, desaturation, shift toward desaturated blues and grays.

    This mapping is customizable by the viewer or content provider.

3.  **Real-time Color Grading Application:** The system applies the selected color grading parameters to the video stream in real-time.  This is achieved using GPU-accelerated shaders and image processing algorithms.

4.  **Contextual Awareness:**  The system incorporates provider metadata (scene type, event context) to refine the emotional mapping. For example, a “scary” scene in a horror movie would amplify the fear-based color grading, even if the viewer’s baseline emotional state is neutral.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Data Structures
struct BiofeedbackData {
  float heartRate;
  float skinConductance;
  float facialMuscleTension;
};

struct ColorGradingParameters {
  float saturation;
  float hueShift;
  float contrast;
};

// Functions

// Get Biofeedback Data from Sensor
BiofeedbackData getBiofeedbackData();

// Analyze Biofeedback Data & Determine Emotional State
String determineEmotionalState(BiofeedbackData data);

// Get Color Grading Parameters based on Emotional State & Context
ColorGradingParameters getColorGradingParameters(String emotionalState, String context);

// Apply Color Grading Parameters to Video Frame
VideoFrame applyColorGrading(VideoFrame frame, ColorGradingParameters parameters);

// Main Loop
while (videoStream.hasNextFrame()) {
  VideoFrame frame = videoStream.getNextFrame();
  BiofeedbackData bioData = getBiofeedbackData();
  String emotionalState = determineEmotionalState(bioData);
  String context = getContext(); // From provider metadata
  ColorGradingParameters parameters = getColorGradingParameters(emotionalState, context);
  VideoFrame gradedFrame = applyColorGrading(frame, parameters);
  displayStream.displayFrame(gradedFrame);
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Immersive Gaming:** Dynamically adjust the visuals based on the player’s emotional state.
*   **Personalized Streaming:** Tailor the viewing experience to individual emotional responses.
*   **Therapeutic Applications:**  Use color grading to evoke specific emotions as part of a therapy program.
*   **Live Event Enhancement:**  Augment live broadcasts with emotionally responsive visuals.
