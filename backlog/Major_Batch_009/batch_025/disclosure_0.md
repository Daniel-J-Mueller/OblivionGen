## Autonomous Mobile Robot Integration & Environmental Mapping

**Concept:** Expand the intermediary device's capabilities by integrating with a fleet of autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) for enhanced environmental awareness, task execution, and dynamic security protocols.

**Specifications:**

*   **AMR Fleet:** Dedicated fleet of small-form factor AMRs equipped with:
    *   High-resolution RGB-D cameras (for 3D mapping & object recognition)
    *   Microphones (for audio detection & voice command processing)
    *   Environmental sensors (temperature, humidity, air quality, gas detection)
    *   Secure communication module (compatible with intermediary device protocols - Bluetooth/Wi-Fi)
    *   Small manipulation arm (capable of light object handling - key, card, package)

*   **Dynamic Mapping:** Intermediary device receives real-time 3D map data from AMRs, creating a persistent environmental model of the secure facility. This model includes:
    *   Static geometry (walls, furniture, doors)
    *   Dynamic objects (people, pets, deliveries)
    *   Environmental data overlays (temperature, air quality)
    *   Accessibility information (clear paths, obstacles)

*   **Task Orchestration:** Intermediary device can assign tasks to AMRs, such as:
    *   **Patrol:** Continuously scan the facility for anomalies (unauthorized access, environmental hazards).
    *   **Delivery Confirmation:** Verify delivery of items to specific locations, capture image/video proof.
    *   **Environmental Monitoring:** Collect and report environmental data.
    *   **Remote Assistance:** Provide a visual/audio link between occupants and remote support personnel.

*   **Adaptive Security Protocols:** Based on real-time environmental data, the intermediary device can:
    *   **Dynamic Path Planning:**  Adjust access routes for workers or visitors based on obstacles or security concerns.
    *   **Automated Lockdown:** Trigger lockdowns in specific areas of the facility based on detected threats (e.g., intrusion, fire).
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify unusual activity (e.g., unexpected presence of a person in a restricted area) and alert occupants/security personnel.
    *   **Proactive Hazard Mitigation:** Detect environmental hazards (e.g., water leaks, gas buildup) and automatically activate mitigation measures (e.g., shut off water valve, open windows).

*   **Intermediary Device Software:**
    *   **AMR Fleet Management Module:** Controls AMR deployment, task assignment, and data collection.
    *   **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) Integration:** Processes 3D map data from AMRs to create a persistent environmental model.
    *   **Behavior Tree Engine:** Defines complex behaviors for AMRs based on environmental data and task assignments.
    *   **Security Policy Engine:** Enforces security policies based on real-time environmental data and user permissions.
    *   **API Integration:** Allows third-party applications to access environmental data and control AMR behavior.

**Pseudocode (Task Assignment):**

```
function assignTask(taskType, location, workerID):
  // Get available AMRs
  availableAMRs = getAvailableAMRs()

  // Select an AMR based on proximity to location
  selectedAMR = selectAMR(availableAMRs, location)

  // Assign task to selected AMR
  selectedAMR.assignTask(taskType, location, workerID)

  // Monitor task progress
  monitorTask(selectedAMR, taskType)

function monitorTask(amr, taskType):
  if taskType == "deliveryConfirmation":
    if amr.taskCompleted():
      // Verify delivery and capture proof
      deliveryProof = amr.getDeliveryProof()
      // Send confirmation to owner
      sendConfirmation(deliveryProof)
  else if taskType == "patrol":
    if amr.anomalyDetected():
      // Alert owner and security personnel
      alertAnomaly()
```
