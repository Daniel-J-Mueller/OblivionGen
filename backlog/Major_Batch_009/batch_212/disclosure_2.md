## Dynamic Trust Scoring & Adaptive Authentication – “Chameleon”

**Concept:** Expand the ‘step-up’ authentication beyond simply *requiring* it, to actively *modulating* access based on a real-time trust score calculated from device/user behavior.  Instead of binary ‘allowed/denied’ access, introduce a spectrum of permissions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Components:**

*   **Device Trust:** (0-100) – Derived from hardware attestation (if available), OS integrity checks, known vulnerabilities, recent software updates, jailbreak/root detection.  Baseline score is 50.
*   **Behavioral Biometrics:** (0-100) – Continuous monitoring of user interaction: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, touchscreen pressure, scrolling speed, app usage patterns.  Uses machine learning to establish a baseline 'profile' for each user. Deviation from this profile decreases the score. Baseline score 75.
*   **Network Context:** (0-100) – IP address reputation, geolocation consistency, connection type (e.g., public Wi-Fi has a lower score). Score adjusts dynamically based on threat intelligence feeds. Baseline score 80.
*   **Transaction Risk:** (0-100) – Analyzes the API call itself: data being accessed, modifications being attempted, time of day, historical usage.  Score is context-dependent. Baseline score 90.
*   **External Threat Feeds:** (0-100) - Integration with threat intelligence providers to identify compromised accounts or malicious activity associated with the user/device. Baseline score 95.

**2. Trust Score Aggregation:**

*   Weighted average calculation. Weights are configurable and adjustable based on risk tolerance. Example: Device Trust (15%), Behavioral (30%), Network (10%), Transaction (35%), External (10%).
*   Final Trust Score range: 0-100.

**3. Adaptive Permission Levels:**

*   **Level 1 (Trust Score 90-100):** Full access to all API endpoints. No additional authentication required.
*   **Level 2 (Trust Score 70-89):** Standard access. Requires initial authentication (as in the provided patent).
*   **Level 3 (Trust Score 50-69):** Limited access. Only read-only operations allowed. Requires step-up authentication (MFA).
*   **Level 4 (Trust Score 30-49):** Highly restricted access.  Only basic operations allowed (e.g., password reset).  Strong step-up authentication (biometrics, hardware security key).
*   **Level 5 (Trust Score 0-29):**  Account locked. Requires manual review and intervention.

**4. Dynamic Adjustment & Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
function calculateTrustScore(deviceID, userID, transactionData):
  deviceTrust = getDeviceTrust(deviceID)
  behavioralTrust = getBehavioralTrust(userID)
  networkTrust = getNetworkTrust(deviceID)
  transactionRisk = getTransactionRisk(transactionData)
  externalThreat = getExternalThreat(deviceID, userID)

  trustScore = (0.15 * deviceTrust) + (0.30 * behavioralTrust) + (0.10 * networkTrust) + (0.35 * transactionRisk) + (0.10 * externalThreat)
  return trustScore

function determineAccessLevel(trustScore):
  if trustScore >= 90:
    return "Level 1"
  else if trustScore >= 70:
    return "Level 2"
  else if trustScore >= 50:
    return "Level 3"
  else if trustScore >= 30:
    return "Level 4"
  else:
    return "Level 5"

//Within API Gateway
on API_CALL_RECEIVED(request):
  userID = request.user_id
  deviceID = request.device_id
  transactionData = request.data

  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(deviceID, userID, transactionData)
  accessLevel = determineAccessLevel(trustScore)

  if accessLevel == "Level 1":
    ALLOW_ACCESS()
  else if accessLevel == "Level 2":
    CHECK_INITIAL_AUTHENTICATION()
  else if accessLevel == "Level 3":
    REQUIRE_STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION(MFA)
  else if accessLevel == "Level 4":
    REQUIRE_STRONG_STEP_UP_AUTHENTICATION(biometrics)
  else:
    LOCK_ACCOUNT()
```

**5.  "Chameleon" Profile Learning:**

*   The system continuously learns user behavior and device characteristics.
*   Trust Score baselines are dynamically adjusted based on long-term data.
*   Anomaly detection algorithms identify deviations from established patterns.
*   Machine learning models predict potential security threats.
