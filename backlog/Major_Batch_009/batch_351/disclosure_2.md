## Dynamic Content “Echoes” – Multi-Sensory Relationship Presentation

**Concept:** Extend relationship visualization beyond textual or visual representations to incorporate multi-sensory “echoes” triggered by proximity to relevant content. This goes beyond simply *displaying* relationships, it aims to subtly *reinforce* them through ambient sensory cues.

**Specs:**

**1. Sensory Profile Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** A JSON-based database linking objects (characters, places, events) to sensory profiles.
    ```json
    {
      "character_name": "Elara",
      "sensory_profile": {
        "sound": "gentle flute melody",
        "haptic": "subtle warmth – like sunshine",
        "visual_aura": "pale blue shimmering effect",
        "olfactory": "hint of lavender"
      }
    }
    ```
*   **Profile Generation:**  Initially populated by author/creator input.  AI-driven suggestion engine to automatically generate profiles based on character descriptions, plot events, and environmental settings.

**2. Proximity Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Reader’s current bookmarked location (character, keyword, location).
*   **Processing:** Calculates “relevance score” based on relationships defined in the data.  Includes:
    *   Direct connections (character A is parent of character B).
    *   Indirect connections (character A is friend of character B, character B is enemy of character C).
    *   Weighted scoring based on connection strength (e.g., family relationships weighted higher than casual acquaintances).
*   **Output:** Ranked list of relevant objects and their associated sensory profiles, adjusted for current reading context.

**3. Multi-Sensory Output Device Integration:**

*   **Device Types:** Compatible with a range of devices:
    *   Smartphones/Tablets: Utilize haptic feedback, screen color adjustments, and audio output.
    *   Dedicated E-Readers: Integrate haptic actuators and miniature audio emitters.
    *   Smart Home Integration: Control ambient lighting, temperature, and even subtle scent diffusion.
*   **Output Control:**
    *   **Intensity Mapping:** Sensory output intensity is proportional to relevance score and proximity.
    *   **Blending/Layering:** Multiple sensory signals are blended to create a cohesive experience.
    *   **Adaptive Filtering:** Filters out irrelevant sensory signals based on user preferences.

**4. Pseudocode – Proximity Engine:**

```
FUNCTION CalculateSensoryOutput(currentLocation, relationshipData, userPreferences)

  relevantObjects = []
  FOR each object IN relationshipData
    IF object IS related TO currentLocation
      relevanceScore = CalculateRelevance(object, currentLocation, relationshipData)
      IF relevanceScore > threshold
        relevantObjects.APPEND(object)
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  sortedObjects = SORT relevantObjects BY relevanceScore DESCENDING

  sensoryOutput = []
  FOR each object IN sortedObjects
    sensoryProfile = GetSensoryProfile(object)
    intensity = MapIntensity(relevanceScore, userPreferences)
    sensoryOutput.APPEND(sensoryProfile WITH intensity)
  ENDFOR

  RETURN sensoryOutput
END FUNCTION
```

**5. Advanced Features:**

*   **Emotional Mapping:** Adjust sensory profiles based on the emotional tone of the content. (e.g.,  a dark, ominous sound for a scene of tension).
*   **Dynamic Profile Generation:** AI continuously learns user preferences and adapts sensory profiles accordingly.
*   **Collaborative Sensory Experience:**  Multiple readers can share a synchronized sensory experience in a virtual reading group.
*   **Authoring Tools:** Allow authors to easily create and customize sensory profiles for their content.
