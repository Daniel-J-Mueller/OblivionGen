## Dynamic Page Role Assignment & Content-Aware Restructuring

**Concept:** Expand beyond static page classification (front cover, TOC, etc.) to *dynamic* page role assignment, coupled with automated content restructuring for optimal digital presentation. This leverages the existing classification framework but adds a layer of AI-driven adaptation.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Page Role Modeler (PRM):** AI module trained on a vast corpus of book/document layouts & digital presentation best practices. It analyzes classified page content *and* its context within the overall document to assign a “role” – not just “TOC”, but “TOC – hierarchical”, “TOC – alphabetical”, “TOC – image-focused”, etc. These roles dictate presentation style.
*   **Content Segmentation Engine (CSE):**  Divides page content into logical blocks (paragraphs, images, tables, headings) using computer vision & NLP. Critical for restructuring.
*   **Restructuring Algorithm (RA):** Based on the PRM’s assigned role, the RA rearranges content blocks within the page for optimal display on various devices (eReaders, tablets, phones, desktops).  The algorithm uses a scoring system based on readability, visual appeal, and information hierarchy.
*   **Device Profile Database (DPD):** Stores display characteristics and user preferences for different devices. RA uses this data to tailor the restructuring process.
*   **User Feedback Loop (UFL):** Collects user interactions (scroll depth, zoom level, time spent on page) to refine the PRM & RA over time.

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Initial Classification:** The existing system classifies the page (e.g., “Table of Contents”).
2.  **Role Assignment:** The PRM analyzes page content and context. It might determine the TOC is best presented as a collapsible hierarchical tree on mobile devices or as a clickable image map on larger screens.  The output is a “Role Descriptor” (e.g., `TOC – mobile – collapsible – hierarchical`).
3.  **Content Segmentation:** The CSE breaks the page into content blocks, identifying their logical function.
4.  **Restructuring:**
    *   RA retrieves the appropriate restructuring rules from the DPD based on the target device and the Role Descriptor.
    *   RA rearranges content blocks, applying style transformations (font sizes, colors, margins) as needed. It prioritizes readability and visual flow.
5.  **Output:** Restructured page content is delivered to the target device.
6.  **Feedback:** User interactions are logged and fed back to the UFL for model refinement.

**III. Pseudocode (Restructuring Algorithm - simplified):**

```pseudocode
function restructurePage(pageContent, roleDescriptor, deviceProfile):
  blocks = segmentPage(pageContent)
  rules = getRestructuringRules(roleDescriptor, deviceProfile)

  //Apply rules to blocks
  for each block in blocks:
    if rule applies to block:
      applyStyleTransformations(block, rule)
      repositionBlock(block, rule)

  //Combine blocks into restructured page
  restructuredPage = combineBlocks(blocks)
  return restructuredPage
```

**IV. Innovation Notes:**

*   This goes beyond simple classification to *adaptive* presentation.
*   Focuses on optimizing the *reading experience* based on device & user preferences.
*   Leverages AI to automate the design process, reducing manual effort.
*   The UFL creates a continuously improving system.
*   The system could be extended to other document types (reports, articles, etc.).
*   Consider the use of Generative AI to *generate* alternative page layouts based on the assigned role.
