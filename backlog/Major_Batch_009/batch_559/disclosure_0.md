## Modular, Self-Configuring Power Adapter - "Chameleon"

**Concept:** A power adapter that automatically detects and configures itself for different plug types *and* voltage/frequency standards, going beyond simple physical swapping of pins. It aims to be globally compatible *without* the user needing to select or change any physical components.

**Core Innovation:** Micro-robotic pin array & dynamic voltage regulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Roughly the size of a standard phone charger (approximately 5cm x 5cm x 2.5cm). Primarily rectangular with rounded edges.
*   **Housing:** Durable, heat-resistant plastic (polycarbonate blend). Matte finish to minimize fingerprints. Integrated LED status indicators.
*   **Pin Array:** A 4x4 grid (16 total) of miniature, independently-controlled robotic pins. Each pin is capable of extending/retracting and rotating.
    *   Pin Material: Conductive, shape-memory alloy (Nickel-Titanium).
    *   Actuation: Micro-servos for precise control of pin extension/retraction and rotation.
    *   Control System: Embedded microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M7) with real-time operating system.
*   **Voltage/Frequency Regulation:**
    *   Input Voltage Range: 100-240V AC (universal).
    *   Output Voltage: Dynamically adjustable, covering common standards (5V, 9V, 12V, 19V).
    *   Frequency: Dynamically adjustable (50Hz/60Hz).
    *   Components: High-frequency switching power supply, DC-DC converters, and a microcontroller-controlled phase-shift oscillator.
*   **Detection System:**
    *   Pin Resistance Measurement: Each pin measures resistance to determine if a socket is present.
    *   Socket Shape Analysis: Pin array dynamically probes the socket.
    *   Voltage/Current Monitoring: Real-time monitoring of input and output voltages and currents.
*   **Connectivity:** Bluetooth module for firmware updates and potential app integration.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Pin Array
Initialize Voltage Regulation Circuit
Establish Bluetooth Connection (optional)

// Main Loop
While (True)
    Detect Socket Presence:
        For Each Pin in Pin Array:
            Extend Pin
            Measure Resistance
            If Resistance < Threshold:
                Socket Present
                Record Pin Location
                Retract Pin
            Else:
                Retract Pin
    If No Socket Detected:
        // Idle Mode
        Display "No Socket" Indicator
        Continue
    Analyze Socket Shape:
        // Algorithm to determine plug type based on pin locations
        If Plug Type == Type A:
            Extend Pins 1 & 2
        Else If Plug Type == Type C:
            Extend Pins 3 & 4
        // ... (other plug type mappings)
    Configure Voltage/Frequency:
        // Read device requirements (e.g., USB Power Delivery protocol)
        // Adjust output voltage/frequency accordingly
    Establish Power Connection:
        Enable Power Output
    Monitor System:
        Continuously monitor voltage/current levels
        Detect and respond to overcurrent/overvoltage conditions
        Log usage data (optional)
End While

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Fail-safes:** Implement multiple layers of safety features to prevent electrical hazards.
*   **Adaptive Learning:** Incorporate machine learning to improve plug type identification accuracy over time.
*   **Wireless Charging:** Integrate a wireless charging coil for compatible devices.
*   **Miniaturization:** Explore advanced microfabrication techniques to further reduce the adapter's size.
*   **Material Science:** Utilize materials with high thermal conductivity to dissipate heat efficiently.
