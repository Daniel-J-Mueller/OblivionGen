## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Peripheral Awareness

**Concept:** Extend the gaze-tracking and display adjustment system to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a “peripheral awareness” layer for the user. This enhances the low-distraction interface by providing subtle physical cues *without* requiring direct visual attention.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Array:** A flexible array of micro-actuators integrated into the bezel of the display or incorporated into wearable accessories (e.g., glasses frame, wristband). Resolution: 2mm actuator spacing. Actuator Type: Electroactive Polymers (EAPs) for fast response and subtle texture changes.
*   **Sensor Integration:** Utilize the existing image capture element (camera) to determine not only gaze direction, but also proximity and orientation of objects *outside* the display area – specifically, the presence and location of other people. Depth sensor integration (e.g., Time-of-Flight) is optional for improved accuracy.
*   **Mapping Algorithm:** A dynamic mapping algorithm correlates the location of detected individuals with specific actuators in the haptic array. The algorithm prioritizes providing feedback only when a person is within a defined "social proximity" range (adjustable by user preference).
*   **Feedback Modalities:**
    *   **Proximity Alert:** Gentle, pulsing vibration on the actuator corresponding to the direction of the approaching person. Intensity scales with proximity.
    *   **Attention Cue:** Subtle texture change (e.g., raised bumps, smooth ridges) on the actuator corresponding to a person who is *looking* at the user (detected via facial recognition/gaze tracking of the external individual).
    *   **Social Boundary:** Continuous, low-intensity vibration on actuators corresponding to the direction of individuals crossing a user-defined “social boundary” (e.g., stepping into the user’s personal space).
*   **Software Interface:**
    *   **Calibration Routine:** User-guided calibration to map the haptic array to the user’s head position and viewing angle.
    *   **Sensitivity Adjustment:** Configurable sensitivity levels for each feedback modality.
    *   **Social Boundary Definition:** Virtual tool for defining the user’s preferred social boundaries.
    *   **Privacy Mode:** Option to disable all haptic feedback.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Capture Image Data
    imageData = captureImage();

    // Analyze Image Data for User Gaze Direction
    userGazeDirection = analyzeGaze(imageData);

    // Analyze Image Data for External People
    peopleDetected = detectPeople(imageData);

    // For each person detected
    for (person in peopleDetected) {
        // Calculate Relative Angle between User Gaze and Person
        angleDifference = calculateAngleDifference(userGazeDirection, person.position);

        // Calculate Distance to Person
        distance = calculateDistance(person.position);

        // Determine Feedback Modality
        if (distance < socialProximityThreshold) {
            // Proximity Alert
            activateHapticActuator(angleDifference, pulsingVibrationIntensity);
        }

        if (person.isLookingAtUser) {
            // Attention Cue
            activateHapticActuator(angleDifference, subtleTextureChange);
        }

        if (person.crossedSocialBoundary) {
            // Social Boundary Alert
            activateHapticActuator(angleDifference, continuousVibrationIntensity);
        }
    }
}

```

**Use Case:** A user is engrossed in information displayed on the device during a meeting. The system provides subtle haptic feedback indicating someone is approaching from the side, or that a colleague is attempting to make eye contact, without disrupting the user's visual focus or requiring them to look up.
