## Adaptive Assistant Personalization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend multi-assistant functionality by dynamically adjusting assistant behavior and selection based on real-time user biofeedback. This aims to provide a truly personalized and intuitive experience, moving beyond static profiles and context (time, location, etc.).

**Specs:**

**1. Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**

*   **Hardware:** Compatible with a range of wearable sensors (smartwatches, fitness trackers, dedicated biofeedback devices). Minimum required sensors: Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), potentially EEG (future expansion).
*   **Data Acquisition:** Secure, low-latency data stream from sensors to the voice-controlled device. API for seamless integration with various sensor manufacturers.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** Noise filtering, artifact removal, and signal standardization within the device. Privacy-preserving data handling – data is processed locally whenever possible.

**2. Emotional State Inference Engine:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** Trained model to map biofeedback data to emotional states (e.g., calm, stressed, focused, frustrated). Model should be adaptable and personalized to the individual user. Continual learning to improve accuracy over time.
*   **State Representation:** Discrete emotional states, or a continuous emotional space (e.g., valence-arousal model).
*   **Confidence Scoring:**  Assign a confidence level to each inferred emotional state. Low confidence triggers a fallback mechanism (e.g., prompt user for clarification).

**3. Dynamic Assistant Selection & Behavior Modification:**

*   **Assistant Profiles:** Each virtual assistant has associated ‘behavioral profiles’ linked to emotional states.  For example:
    *   **Calm:** Assistant adopts a soothing tone, focuses on long-form content (audiobooks, podcasts).
    *   **Stressed:** Assistant offers guided meditation, provides calming music, simplifies information delivery.
    *   **Focused:**  Assistant minimizes distractions, prioritizes task completion, offers concise updates.
    *   **Frustrated:** Assistant offers helpful suggestions, provides access to troubleshooting resources, actively seeks user feedback.
*   **Behavioral Parameters:**  Control parameters within each assistant. These could include:
    *   **Voice Tone:** Adjust pitch, speed, and emotion.
    *   **Response Length:** Short, concise answers vs. detailed explanations.
    *   **Proactivity Level:**  Passive (responds to requests) vs. proactive (offers suggestions).
    *   **Content Filtering:**  Prioritize positive/uplifting content vs. neutral content.
*   **Adaptation Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    function AdaptAssistant(emotionalState, confidenceLevel):
        if confidenceLevel > threshold:
            selectedAssistant = ChooseAssistantBasedOnEmotionalState(emotionalState)
            ModifyAssistantBehavior(selectedAssistant, emotionalState)
        else:
            // Fallback: Use default assistant or prompt user for preferences
            UseDefaultAssistant()
        end if
    end function
    ```

**4. User Control & Customization:**

*   **Emotional State Override:** Allow users to manually override the inferred emotional state.
*   **Behavioral Profile Editor:**  Provide a user interface for customizing behavioral profiles associated with each emotional state.
*   **Privacy Settings:**  Clear and transparent control over data collection and usage. Option to disable biofeedback integration entirely.



**Expansion:**  Explore integration with other contextual data (e.g., calendar events, location, activity level) to further refine assistant personalization. Investigate the use of advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., reinforcement learning) to optimize assistant behavior over time.
