## Federated Identity & Dynamic Trust Scores

**Concept:** Extend the federated identity broker to incorporate a dynamic trust scoring system for identity providers, influencing access granted to identity requests. This goes beyond simply listing "trusted providers" and introduces a continuous assessment of reliability.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Components:**

*   **Trust Score Engine:** A module within the federated identity broker responsible for calculating and updating trust scores for each registered identity provider.
*   **Data Sources:** The Trust Score Engine leverages multiple data sources:
    *   **Uptime/Availability:** Monitoring of the identity provider’s service availability.
    *   **Response Time:** Tracking the responsiveness of the identity provider.
    *   **Attestation Validity:** Verification of the validity of attestations/assertions provided by the identity provider.  Expired or improperly formatted attestations reduce the score.
    *   **Historical Access Logs:** Analysis of past access requests fulfilled by the identity provider. Patterns of suspicious activity (e.g., unusually high volume of requests, requests for sensitive resources) lower the score.
    *   **Reputation Services:** Integration with external reputation services (optional) to incorporate broader trust assessments.
*   **Trust Score Thresholds:** Configurable thresholds defining different trust levels (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

**II. Workflow:**

1.  **Provider Registration:**  Identity providers register with the broker as before. Initial trust score is set to a default value (e.g., Medium).
2.  **Continuous Monitoring:** The Trust Score Engine constantly monitors the data sources for each registered provider, updating the trust score in real-time.
3.  **Identity Request Processing:** When an identity consumer requests access, the broker:
    *   Retrieves the trust score for the selected identity provider.
    *   Applies a policy based on the trust score:
        *   **High:**  Access granted immediately.
        *   **Medium:**  Standard access control procedures.
        *   **Low:**  Multi-factor authentication required, or access restricted to less sensitive resources.  The request may be flagged for manual review.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Trust scores are adjusted dynamically based on real-time performance and historical behavior. A provider exhibiting consistent reliability will have its score increased; a provider experiencing downtime or security issues will have its score decreased.

**III. Pseudocode (Trust Score Engine):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(identityProviderID) {
  uptimeScore = getUptimeScore(identityProviderID)  // Returns 0-100
  responseTimeScore = getResponseTimeScore(identityProviderID) // Returns 0-100
  attestationValidityScore = getAttestationValidityScore(identityProviderID) // Returns 0-100
  accessLogScore = getAccessLogScore(identityProviderID) // Returns 0-100

  //Weighted average calculation
  totalScore = (0.3 * uptimeScore) + (0.25 * responseTimeScore) + (0.25 * attestationValidityScore) + (0.2 * accessLogScore)

  return totalScore
}

function applyTrustPolicy(identityProviderID, resourceRequested) {
  trustScore = calculateTrustScore(identityProviderID)

  if (trustScore >= 90) {
    //High Trust
    grantAccess(resourceRequested)
  } else if (trustScore >= 70) {
    //Medium Trust
    //Standard Access Control Procedures
    verifyUserCredentials(resourceRequested)
  } else {
    //Low Trust
    //Multi-Factor Authentication Required
    requireMultiFactorAuth(resourceRequested)
  }
}
```

**IV.  API Endpoints:**

*   `/providers/{providerID}/trustscore` – Returns the current trust score for a given provider.
*   `/providers/{providerID}/trusthistory` – Returns historical trust score data.
*   `/policies/trust` –  Endpoint for managing trust-based access control policies.
