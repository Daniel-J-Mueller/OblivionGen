**Adaptive Resonance Frequency Modulation for Battery Pack Integrity Assessment**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** A non-destructive testing (NDT) system utilizing adaptive resonance frequency modulation (ARFM).
*   **Excitation Source:** Piezoelectric transducers arrayed around the battery pack perimeter. These transducers generate a swept frequency sine wave.
*   **Resonance Detection:** Highly sensitive accelerometers positioned strategically on the battery pack surface detect mechanical resonances.
*   **Adaptive Algorithm:** A closed-loop algorithm continuously adjusts the frequency sweep range and resolution based on real-time resonance detection.  The algorithm prioritizes frequencies exhibiting anomalous damping or frequency shifts.
*   **Damage Localization:** A spatial mapping algorithm correlates resonance patterns with potential failure locations within the battery pack. This utilizes a finite element model (FEM) of the battery pack, calibrated with baseline resonance data from undamaged units.
*   **Data Acquisition:** High-speed data acquisition system capable of capturing transient resonance responses.
*   **Signal Processing:** Advanced signal processing techniques, including wavelet transforms and spectral analysis, to extract subtle resonance features.
*   **Environmental Control:** System capable of operating in a controlled temperature and humidity environment.
*   **User Interface:** Graphical user interface (GUI) for data visualization, analysis, and reporting.

**Innovation Detail:**

Existing battery pack testing often relies on destructive methods or simple vibration analysis. This system moves beyond simple vibration analysis by using *adaptive* resonance frequency modulation. The key is the closed-loop algorithm that dynamically adjusts the frequency sweep based on real-time data, allowing it to home in on subtle changes in resonance patterns indicative of damage. The FEM model is not static; it's continuously refined based on the detected resonances, improving the accuracy of damage localization.  This allows for early detection of internal failures, such as cell cracking or internal shorts, before they manifest as catastrophic failures. The system is intended to be fully non-destructive, allowing for in-line testing during manufacturing and regular inspection of deployed battery packs. This could significantly improve safety and reliability.
