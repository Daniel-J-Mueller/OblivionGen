## Dynamic Request Shaping with Predictive Canonical ID Generation

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the identifier translation service to *predictively* generate canonical IDs *before* receiving the full request. This allows for early request shaping, pre-fetching of associated data, and potentially, mitigation of service overload scenarios.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Request Interception Module:** (RIM) – Sits *before* the existing identifier translation service. Analyzes the *initial* portion of an incoming request (e.g., first few parameters, header information suggesting the request type).
*   **Predictive Canonical ID Generator (PCIDG):** – A machine learning model trained on historical request data (external to canonical ID mappings, request patterns, service load).  Receives partial request information from the RIM. Outputs a *probability distribution* of likely canonical IDs.
*   **Request Shaping Module (RSM):** – Based on the PCIDG’s output, the RSM constructs a ‘pre-request’ – a minimal request containing the predicted canonical IDs and any essential parameters needed to validate/confirm them. This pre-request is sent to the target service *before* the full request.
*   **Canonical ID Confirmation Service (CICS):** – A lightweight service within the target service that receives the pre-request, validates the predicted canonical IDs, and returns a confirmation status (valid/invalid) and any necessary corrections.
*   **Full Request Assembly Module (FRAM):** – Upon receiving confirmation from the CICS, the FRAM assembles the full request (including all remaining parameters) and forwards it to the target service.
*    **Feedback Loop:**  Data from each stage (RIM, PCIDG, RSM, CICS, FRAM) is fed back into the PCIDG to improve its prediction accuracy over time.

**III. Data Structures:**

*   **Pre-Request:** {predicted_canonical_ids: [canonical_id_1, canonical_id_2, ...], essential_parameters: {param_1: value_1, ...}}
*   **CICS Response:** {status: “valid” | “invalid”, corrections: {canonical_id_1: corrected_canonical_id_1, ...}}
*   **Prediction Data:** (Historical request data, external ID to canonical ID mappings, request patterns, service load metrics)

**IV. Pseudocode (PCIDG):**

```
function predict_canonical_ids(partial_request):
  // 1. Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from partial_request
  features = extract_features(partial_request)

  // 2. Model Prediction: Use trained ML model to predict probability distribution of canonical IDs
  probability_distribution = ml_model.predict(features)

  // 3. Ranking and Filtering:  Rank canonical IDs based on probability, and filter based on a confidence threshold
  ranked_ids = sort_by_probability(probability_distribution)
  predicted_ids = filter_by_confidence(ranked_ids, confidence_threshold)

  return predicted_ids
```

**V. Workflow:**

1.  Client sends request.
2.  RIM intercepts request and extracts initial information.
3.  PCIDG predicts likely canonical IDs.
4.  RSM creates pre-request with predicted IDs.
5.  CICS validates/corrects IDs and returns confirmation.
6.  FRAM assembles full request.
7.  Target service processes full request.
8.  Data is fed back into the PCIDG for continuous improvement.

**VI. Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency through pre-fetching and parallel processing.
*   Improved service scalability and resilience.
*   Enhanced security through proactive validation of identifiers.
*   Ability to handle high-volume requests more efficiently.
