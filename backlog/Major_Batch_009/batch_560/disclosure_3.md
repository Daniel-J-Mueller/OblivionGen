## Modular Robotic Fan System

**Concept:** Expand upon the movable fan support to create a fully robotic, modular fan system capable of dynamically adjusting airflow direction and intensity, and even moving *between* buildings.

**Specs:**

*   **Fan Module:** Standardized fan unit with integrated electric motor, fan blades (adjustable pitch), and wireless communication module (WiFi/Bluetooth). Dimensions: 60cm x 60cm x 30cm. Power: 220V AC/12V DC.
*   **Robotic Support Module:** Articulated robotic arm with 6 degrees of freedom. Mounts directly to the Fan Module. Material: Lightweight aluminum alloy. Payload Capacity: 25kg.  Control: ROS (Robot Operating System) based.  Integrated sensors: IMU, encoders, force/torque sensors. 
*   **Mounting System:** Universal mounting bracket compatible with various wall types (concrete, wood, metal).  Includes quick-release mechanism for easy module swapping.
*   **Power & Communication:** Wireless power transfer (short-range inductive charging) and data communication. Wired backup connection.
*   **Navigation System (Optional):** For inter-building fan modules, incorporate a small drone-like propulsion system (ducted fans) and GPS/LiDAR for autonomous navigation.  Requires safety features (obstacle avoidance, geofencing).

**Operation:**

1.  **Standard Mode:** Fan module is mounted on a stationary bracket. Robotic arm adjusts fan angle and speed for optimal airflow.  Controlled via a central building management system or user app.
2.  **Dynamic Mode:** Robotic arm can move the fan module within a defined workspace (e.g., a large warehouse) to direct airflow where it's needed most. 
3.  **Inter-Building Mode (Optional):**  For applications requiring airflow between buildings (e.g., ventilation, emergency smoke removal), the fan module can be equipped with a propulsion system and autonomously navigate to a designated receiver module on another building.  Requires a secure docking mechanism and failsafe systems.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Logic):**

```
// Function: AdjustFanDirection(targetX, targetY, targetZ)
// Input: Desired 3D coordinates for airflow direction
// Output: Robotic arm movement commands

function AdjustFanDirection(targetX, targetY, targetZ) {

    currentPosition = GetRoboticArmPosition();
    distanceX = targetX - currentPosition.x;
    distanceY = targetY - currentPosition.y;
    distanceZ = targetZ - currentPosition.z;

    // Calculate joint angles required to reach target position
    jointAngles = InverseKinematics(distanceX, distanceY, distanceZ);

    // Send commands to robotic arm actuators
    SetJointAngles(jointAngles);

    // Monitor fan speed and adjust as needed
    AdjustFanSpeed(CalculateOptimalFanSpeed(distanceX, distanceY, distanceZ));
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Smart building ventilation
*   Emergency smoke removal
*   Industrial process cooling
*   Localized air purification
*   Temporary ventilation solutions (e.g., construction sites)
*   Mobile ventilation for outdoor events.
