**Dynamic Resolution & Fidelity Streaming via Predicted Player Gaze**

**Concept:** Expand on deferred rendering by introducing a system that dynamically adjusts rendering resolution and fidelity *based on predicted player gaze*, streaming only high-fidelity visuals to the areas the player is likely to focus on. This moves beyond static or reactive foveated rendering.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Gaze Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Player input (controller/mouse movement, head tracking data), game state (object interactions, enemy positions), scene geometry.
    *   Algorithm: Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) trained on player behavior data (from multiple players). The RNN predicts the probability distribution of the player's future gaze point within a short time window (e.g., 100ms).  The network should incorporate attention mechanisms to prioritize salient objects and areas of the scene.
    *   Output: A heatmap representing the probability distribution of the player's gaze. This is overlaid onto the render target.

2.  **Dynamic Resolution Map Generation:**
    *   Input: Gaze prediction heatmap, target frame rate, available rendering budget (GPU power), and a pre-defined resolution scale range (e.g., 0.25x to 1.0x).
    *   Algorithm:
        *   The heatmap is divided into zones (e.g., 16x16 pixel blocks).
        *   Each zone is assigned a resolution scale based on its probability value in the heatmap. Higher probability = higher resolution.
        *   The total rendering budget is dynamically allocated across zones, prioritizing areas with the highest resolution.
        *   A constraint is applied to maintain a minimum acceptable frame rate. If the rendering budget is insufficient to render all zones at the desired resolution, the resolution of lower-priority zones is reduced.

3.  **Deferred Rendering Pipeline Integration:**
    *   Modified Deferred Shading: Extend the standard deferred rendering buffers to include a ‘resolution scale’ buffer.
    *   Shader Modification: Shaders read the resolution scale from the buffer and dynamically adjust the number of samples used for shading, lighting, and texturing. This will allow high-fidelity rendering in areas where the resolution is higher, and lower-fidelity rendering in areas where the resolution is lower.
    *   Temporal Upscaling: Implement a temporal upscaling technique (e.g., DLSS or FSR) to reduce aliasing artifacts and improve the visual quality of low-resolution areas.

4.  **Streaming Component:**
    *   Scene Partitioning: Divide the scene into smaller, manageable chunks (e.g., tiles).
    *   Chunk Prioritization: Prioritize streaming chunks based on their predicted relevance to the player's gaze.
    *   Progressive Streaming: Stream chunks at progressively higher resolutions and detail levels, based on their predicted relevance and the available bandwidth.
    *   Error Correction: Implement error correction mechanisms to minimize the impact of network latency and packet loss.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Resolution Map Generation):**

```
function generate_dynamic_resolution_map(gaze_heatmap, target_frame_rate, rendering_budget):
  resolution_map = empty map
  total_heatmap_value = sum(gaze_heatmap)
  for each zone in gaze_heatmap:
    zone_heatmap_value = gaze_heatmap[zone]
    resolution_scale = min(1.0, (zone_heatmap_value / total_heatmap_value) * max_resolution_scale)
    resolution_map[zone] = resolution_scale
  
  # Budget constraint
  while total_rendering_cost(resolution_map) > rendering_budget:
    lowest_resolution_zone = find_zone_with_lowest_resolution(resolution_map)
    reduce_resolution(lowest_resolution_zone, reduction_factor)

  return resolution_map
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant performance gains by reducing the rendering workload.
*   Improved visual fidelity in areas where the player is looking.
*   Scalability to support a wider range of hardware configurations.
*   Enhanced immersion and realism.
*   Reduced bandwidth requirements for streaming applications.
