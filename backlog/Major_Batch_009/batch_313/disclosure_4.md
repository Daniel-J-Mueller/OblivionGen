## Dynamic Neural Network ‘Shattering’ for Compression Profile Search

**Concept:** Instead of iteratively refining a single search policy to find optimal compression profiles, explore a massively parallel ‘shattering’ approach. Generate a vast, diverse population of radically different compression policies, apply them to the target neural network, and evaluate the resulting compressed models *simultaneously*. This bypasses the sequential nature of iterative refinement and allows for discovery of non-obvious compression strategies.

**Specs:**

*   **Population Size:**  Define a population size (e.g., 1000 - 10,000) representing the number of unique compression policies to generate.
*   **Policy Generation:** Each policy will be a function mapping layers/modules of the target network to compression parameters. Parameters could include:
    *   Pruning percentage (0-100%)
    *   Quantization level (e.g., 8-bit, 4-bit, binary)
    *   Knowledge distillation target selection (which layers to distill from)
    *   Weight sharing strategy.
*   **Policy Encoding:** Encode each policy as a vector of floating-point numbers.  The length of the vector will depend on the complexity of the target network.  Use a genetic algorithm or neuroevolution to evolve this vector.
*   **Parallel Execution:** Implement a distributed computing framework (e.g., using Kubernetes or a similar orchestration system) to execute the compression and evaluation of each policy in parallel across multiple GPU/CPU nodes.  Each node will handle a subset of the policy population.
*   **Evaluation Metrics:** Define key performance indicators (KPIs) beyond simple accuracy/loss.  Include:
    *   Model size (bytes)
    *   Inference latency (ms)
    *   Energy consumption (Joules)
    *   Robustness to adversarial attacks.
*   **Fitness Function:**  Combine the KPIs into a single fitness score. Use weighted sums or more complex multi-objective optimization techniques.
*   **Selection & Reproduction:**  After each generation, select the highest-performing policies based on their fitness scores.  Use genetic algorithms (crossover, mutation) or neuroevolutionary techniques to create new policies from the selected parents.
*   **Dynamic Sharding:** Implement a mechanism to dynamically shard the search space.  If certain regions of the policy space consistently produce poor results, reduce the sampling rate in those regions and increase it in promising areas.
*   **'Policy Seed' Preservation**: After each generation preserve a set of 'seed' policies, representing radically different compression strategies. These 'seeds' prevent the population from converging to a local optimum and encourage exploration of diverse solutions.
*   **Automated Hyperparameter Tuning**: Utilize automated hyperparameter tuning algorithms (e.g. Bayesian Optimization, Random Search) to find optimal hyperparameters for both the compression process itself, and the population evolution process.



**Pseudocode:**

```
# Initialize Population of Policies (Policy = vector of compression parameters)
population = generate_random_population(population_size)

for generation in range(num_generations):
    # Evaluate each policy in parallel
    results = parallel_evaluate(population, target_network, data_set)

    # Calculate fitness score for each policy
    fitness_scores = calculate_fitness(results)

    # Select best policies
    selected_policies = select_best(population, fitness_scores, selection_rate)

    # Create new generation using crossover and mutation
    new_population = create_new_generation(selected_policies, crossover_rate, mutation_rate)

    # Update population
    population = new_population

# Return best policy from final population
best_policy = find_best_policy(population)
```

This approach trades increased computational cost for potentially discovering dramatically better compression profiles than iterative refinement can achieve.  The parallel execution and dynamic sharding are critical for managing the computational complexity of exploring such a vast search space.
