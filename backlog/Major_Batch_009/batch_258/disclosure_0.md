## Dynamic Deception Network – ‘Mirage’

**Concept:** Leverage identified compromised devices *not* as targets for containment, but as active nodes in a dynamic deception network. Instead of simply blocking traffic from infected machines, redirect portions of their outbound communication through ‘Mirage’ – a continuously shifting network of honeypots, emulated services, and false data.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core Component: ‘Shifter’:** A central controller responsible for dynamic network topology generation. It receives data from the existing compromised device identification system (as outlined in the patent) and constructs a temporary, isolated network. This network isn’t static; it reshuffles configurations (IP addresses, service ports, data payloads) on a rolling basis – every 5-15 minutes.
*   **Honeypot Deployment:** Mirage utilizes a library of diverse honeypots – emulated web servers, databases, file shares, IoT devices, etc. These are not static images, but running processes capable of receiving and responding to requests. The selection of honeypots is dynamically matched to the observed outbound traffic of compromised devices.
*   **Data Emulation:** The system must be capable of generating and injecting plausible, but subtly incorrect, data into the outbound stream. This includes fabricated user credentials, modified log entries, altered financial transactions, and misleading reports. The goal is *not* immediate detection, but delayed attribution and disruption.
*   **Traffic Interception & Redirection:** A lightweight agent (installed via existing network management infrastructure) intercepts outbound traffic from identified compromised devices. This agent doesn't block the traffic; it redirects it through the 'Mirage' network. The redirection is transparent to the compromised device.
*   **Behavioral Analysis Module:** The system continually monitors the interaction between compromised devices and the 'Mirage' network. This includes tracking response times, data volume, request patterns, and error rates. Anomalous behavior triggers alerts and informs adaptive network reconfiguration.
*   **Attribution Delay Mechanism:** Inject subtle delays (milliseconds to seconds) into outbound responses. This makes accurate timing analysis for attribution significantly more difficult.
*   **Feedback Loop to Compromised Device Identification:** Data gathered from the 'Mirage' network (interaction patterns, attempted exploits, data exfiltration attempts) feeds back into the existing compromised device identification system, enhancing its accuracy and identifying previously undetected infections.
*   **Pseudocode – Shifter (Core Controller):**

```
function generate_network_topology(compromised_devices, honeypot_library) {
    // Analyze outbound traffic patterns of compromised_devices
    traffic_analysis = analyze_traffic(compromised_devices)

    // Select honeypots based on traffic analysis
    selected_honeypots = select_honeypots(traffic_analysis, honeypot_library)

    // Assign IP addresses and ports to honeypots (randomly, within defined ranges)
    assigned_resources = assign_resources(selected_honeypots)

    // Create routing rules to redirect traffic from compromised devices to assigned resources
    routing_rules = create_routing_rules(compromised_devices, assigned_resources)

    // Configure honeypots with realistic data (based on traffic analysis)
    configure_honeypots(assigned_resources, traffic_analysis)

    return routing_rules, assigned_resources
}

function update_network_topology() {
    while (true) {
        routing_rules, assigned_resources = generate_network_topology(compromised_devices, honeypot_library)
        apply_routing_rules(routing_rules)
        sleep(5-15 minutes)
    }
}
```

**Deployment Considerations:** Requires robust network infrastructure and significant computational resources to manage the dynamic network topology and emulated services. Needs careful monitoring to avoid inadvertently disrupting legitimate traffic.
