**Adaptive Foveated Rendering with Predictive Inter-View Synthesis**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:**

Extend foveated rendering beyond the immediate viewport by predicting user gaze direction *between* views within the virtual environment. Instead of solely rendering what's directly visible, we proactively generate high-resolution proxies for anticipated gaze locations in neighboring views, even if those views arenâ€™t currently prioritized by traditional foveation. This reduces perceived latency when the user's gaze shifts.

**II. System Components:**

*   **Gaze Prediction Module:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on user gaze patterns. Input: historical gaze data (past N frames), current head/body pose, scene geometry. Output: Probability distribution of likely gaze locations (x, y, z) within a defined radius around the current view. Includes confidence scores for each prediction.
*   **Inter-View Synthesis Engine:** Utilizes multi-view stereo (MVS) or neural radiance fields (NeRF) to generate high-resolution image patches corresponding to the predicted gaze locations in neighboring views.  Prioritizes synthesis quality based on prediction confidence and proximity to the current view.
*   **Adaptive Resolution Control:** A hierarchical resolution system. Base layer rendered at minimum acceptable quality. Enhancement layers generated on demand for predicted gaze locations, up to maximum resolution.  Resolution scaling is dynamic, based on prediction confidence and available computational resources.
*   **View Caching System:** Stores recently synthesized view patches in a GPU-accessible cache. Hit rate is tracked, and cache eviction policy prioritizes frequently accessed or high-quality patches.

**III. Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
// Per Frame Processing
for each view in active view list:
    // 1. Gaze Prediction
    predicted_gazes = GazePredictionModule(historical_gaze_data, head_pose, scene_geometry)

    // 2. Prioritize Predicted Gazes
    sorted_gazes = sort(predicted_gazes, by: confidence_score, descending)

    // 3. Inter-View Synthesis
    for gaze in sorted_gazes:
        if gaze.view != current_view:  // Synthesize only if in a different view
            if gaze.view not in view_cache:
                synthesized_patch = InterViewSynthesisEngine(gaze.view, gaze.coordinates)
                view_cache[gaze.view] = synthesized_patch

            // Assign synthesized patch to appropriate rendering target.

    // 4. Render base layer for all views
    RenderBaseLayer(all_views)

    // 5. Apply enhancement patches
    ApplyEnhancementPatches(view_cache)
```

**IV. Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-bandwidth memory (HBM) for fast access to view caches and synthesized patches.
*   Dedicated neural processing unit (NPU) or tensor cores for accelerating gaze prediction and inter-view synthesis.
*   Eye-tracking hardware providing low-latency gaze data.

**V. Novelty & Potential:**

This approach moves beyond traditional foveated rendering by pre-fetching and synthesizing content for *anticipated* gaze locations.  This proactive strategy can reduce perceived latency and improve the overall VR experience, particularly for fast-paced movements or dynamic scenes.  It complements existing foveated rendering techniques, providing an additional layer of optimization.  This system inherently works with the provided patent by expanding on the dynamic selection of views.
