## Dynamic Haptic Label System

**Core Concept:** A label incorporating microfluidic channels and programmable actuators to create dynamically changing tactile graphics *and* temperature variations. Instead of a static touch graphic, the label can *morph* the graphic presented to the user, providing directional cues, highlighting areas of interest, or even simulating textures.

**Specs:**

*   **Label Material:** Flexible polymer substrate (e.g., PDMS) with embedded microfluidic channels (channel width: 50-200 microns, channel depth: 20-50 microns). Transparent where graphics are displayed.
*   **Actuation System:** Integrated array of miniature piezoelectric pumps (density: 50-100 pumps/cm²) connected to the microfluidic channels. These pumps will circulate a thermally conductive fluid.
*   **Fluid:** Non-toxic, biocompatible fluid with a high thermal conductivity and low viscosity (e.g., a water-glycol mixture with nanoparticles).
*   **Thermal Control:** Miniature Peltier elements integrated beneath the label substrate for localized heating/cooling. Controlled via a microcontroller.
*   **Graphic Display:** The graphic itself is embossed or etched into the polymer substrate, creating raised or lowered areas. The fluid flow and temperature changes modify how the user *perceives* the graphic.
*   **Power/Control:** Wireless power transfer (Qi standard) for both actuation and thermal control. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication for user control/programming.
*   **Programming Interface:**  Software interface allowing users to define dynamic graphic sequences. Users can specify:
    *   Which areas of the graphic ‘rise’ or ‘fall’ via fluid pressure changes.
    *   Temperature gradients within the graphic.
    *   Animation speed/patterns.

**Operational Logic (Pseudocode):**

```
// Define graphic elements as nodes in a graph.
// Each node represents a section of the graphic, connected to a set of pumps & Peltier elements.
// Data structure: Node {
//     ID: integer,
//     Pumps: [integer], // Pump IDs controlling fluid flow to this node
//     Peltier: integer, // Peltier element ID for local temp control
//     DefaultHeight: float, // Initial height of the node (0.0 - 1.0)
//     AnimationSequence: [ {time: float, height: float, temp: float} ]
// }

// Function: UpdateGraphic(currentTime)
//   For each Node in Graphic:
//     Find the closest time entry in Node.AnimationSequence to currentTime
//     Set Node height and temperature accordingly.
//     Activate associated pumps to achieve desired fluid pressure for height.
//     Activate Peltier element to achieve desired temperature.

// Main loop:
//   Read currentTime
//   UpdateGraphic(currentTime)
//   Repeat
```

**Innovation:** The dynamic element. Existing touch graphics are static. This label *changes* over time, providing a more engaging and informative user experience. Imagine a map that highlights the route as you follow it, or a diagram that animates to demonstrate a process. This isn’t just about feeling a graphic; it's about *interacting* with a dynamic representation.
