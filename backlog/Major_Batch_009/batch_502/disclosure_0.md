## Haptic Swarm Composition

**Concept:** Expand the coordinated haptic feedback beyond a single stylus/device pairing to a swarm of haptic devices, dynamically composing a “virtual texture” experienced by the user. Imagine feeling the edges of a virtual object not just through the stylus, but also through coordinated vibrations on a glove, a chair, or even localized sound waves.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device Network:**

*   **Communication Protocol:**  Short-range, low-latency wireless protocol (e.g., modified UWB or dedicated RF) allowing for sub-10ms communication between the computing device and all networked haptic devices.
*   **Device Discovery:**  Automatic discovery and registration of compatible haptic devices within range. Each device broadcasts its capabilities (frequency range, force levels, actuator types).
*   **Addressing:** Unique device IDs for granular control.
*   **Network Topology:**  Mesh networking support for redundancy and scalability.

**2. Virtual Texture Definition:**

*   **Texture Primitives:** Define a library of basic haptic primitives (ridges, bumps, edges, voids) with adjustable parameters (height, width, frequency, sharpness).
*   **Texture Composition:** Allow complex textures to be built from combinations of primitives. Each primitive is assigned a spatial location and an intensity value.
*   **Procedural Generation:** Implement algorithms to procedurally generate textures based on input parameters (material type, surface roughness, etc.).
*   **Texture Mapping:** Algorithms to map textures onto virtual objects or spaces. This will include collision detection to ensure textures are activated appropriately.

**3. Haptic Rendering Engine:**

*   **Coordination Algorithm:**  A central algorithm that determines how to distribute haptic feedback across the networked devices. This should consider:
    *   **Proximity:**  Prioritize devices closest to the point of interaction.
    *   **Device Capabilities:**  Allocate feedback to devices capable of producing the desired effect.
    *   **User Preference:** Allow users to customize the distribution of haptic feedback.
    *   **Occlusion:** Avoid redundant feedback from devices blocked by other objects or the user’s body.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Real-time adjustment of haptic feedback based on user movement, interaction, and environment.
*   **Spatial Audio Integration:** Combine haptic feedback with spatial audio cues to enhance the sense of immersion.
*   **Force Field Generation:** Implement algorithms to generate localized force fields using coordinated vibrations, creating the sensation of pushing against or being pulled by virtual objects.

**4. Software API:**

*   **Haptic Scene Graph:** A data structure for organizing and managing haptic elements in a virtual environment.
*   **Haptic Material Definition:** Define haptic properties of materials (friction, stiffness, texture).
*   **Haptic Event Handling:** Trigger haptic feedback based on user interactions or events in the virtual environment.
*   **Calibration Tools:** Tools for calibrating haptic devices and ensuring accurate feedback.

**Pseudocode (Coordination Algorithm):**

```
function distributeHapticFeedback(interactionPoint, hapticData, deviceList) {
  // Calculate distance from each device to the interaction point
  distances = calculateDistances(interactionPoint, deviceList);

  // Filter devices based on range and capabilities
  eligibleDevices = filterDevices(distances, hapticData);

  // Assign haptic data to devices based on proximity and capabilities
  for (device in eligibleDevices) {
    // Adjust haptic data based on device capabilities
    adjustedData = adjustHapticData(hapticData, device);

    // Send haptic instructions to the device
    sendHapticInstructions(device, adjustedData);
  }
}
```

**Example Use Case:**

A virtual sculpting application. The user is sculpting a clay model with a stylus. Coordinated haptic feedback is provided not only through the stylus but also through a haptic glove and a vibrating chair. The glove provides detailed texture information about the clay surface, while the chair provides overall shape and weight information. This creates a much more immersive and realistic sculpting experience.
