## Personalized Command Chaining & Predictive Execution

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Module:** Command Chain Manager (CCM) - Software component integrated with the existing payment service.
*   **Data Store:** User Command History (UCH) - Timestamped log of all personalized commands executed by each user.
*   **AI Module:** Predictive Execution Engine (PEE) – Machine learning model trained on UCH data.
*   **Interface:** Expanded User Interface (EUI) – Modification of existing UI to support command chaining & prediction feedback.
*   **Communication:** SMS/Text integration remains. Extended support for voice command input.

**Innovation Description:**

The current patent focuses on mapping personalized commands to base actions. This expands upon that by introducing command *chains* and *predictive execution*. Users can define sequences of actions triggered by a single personalized command. The system learns user behavior and *predicts* likely subsequent actions, offering suggestions and even automatically initiating those actions with user confirmation.

**Detailed Operation:**

1.  **Chain Definition (EUI):**  Users access the EUI to create chains. They define a trigger command (e.g., "X") and then add a sequence of base actions to be executed in order.  The UI allows for conditional branching within the chain (e.g., "If balance < $100, then send low balance notification").

2.  **Command Execution & Logging:**  When a personalized command is received, the CCM checks if it’s associated with a chain. If so, it executes the chain. Every action taken, and the context (time, location, user account details, recent transactions) is logged in the UCH.

3.  **Predictive Modeling (PEE):**  The PEE constantly analyzes the UCH. It identifies patterns in user behavior – what actions are frequently performed *after* a specific action or command.  It builds a probability model for each user.

4.  **Proactive Suggestions (EUI):**  Before a user enters a command, the EUI displays a list of predicted actions based on their recent behavior.  For example, if a user frequently sends $20 to a specific contact after receiving a paycheck, the EUI might suggest "Send $20 to [Contact]" as a quick option.

5.  **Automated Execution (Optional):**  Users can configure the system to *automatically* execute predicted actions with a brief confirmation prompt ("Execute predicted action: Send $20 to [Contact]?  Y/N").

**Pseudocode (PEE – Simplified):**

```
function predict_next_action(user_id, last_action, context_data):
  // Load user's historical action data from UCH
  user_history = load_user_history(user_id)

  // Filter history for similar contexts
  similar_contexts = filter_contexts(user_history, last_action, context_data)

  // Calculate probabilities of next actions
  action_probabilities = calculate_action_probabilities(similar_contexts)

  // Sort actions by probability
  sorted_actions = sort_actions_by_probability(action_probabilities)

  // Return top N predicted actions
  return sorted_actions[0:N]
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased server processing power to handle the machine learning model and real-time prediction calculations.
*   Sufficient data storage for the UCH logs.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with calendar/scheduling apps to predict actions based on upcoming events.
*   Contextual awareness via location services (e.g., predict ordering coffee when near a coffee shop).
*   Personalized recommendations for new features or services based on command patterns.
