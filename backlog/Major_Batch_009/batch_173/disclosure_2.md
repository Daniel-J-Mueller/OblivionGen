## Dynamic Content 'Weighting' via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Augment the relevance scoring system with real-time biofeedback data from the user to dynamically adjust content 'weighting' and scrolling speed. Instead of *predicting* relevance based on past behavior, actively *measure* user engagement and adjust the feed accordingly.

**Specs:**

*   **Biofeedback Sensors:** Integrate support for wearable biosensors (e.g., EEG, GSR/EDA, heart rate variability) via Bluetooth/USB. Data transmission rate minimum 10Hz. Data must be encrypted in transit.
*   **Engagement Metric:** Develop an ‘Engagement Score’ derived from biofeedback data. This score combines:
    *   **Cognitive Load:** Measured via EEG (alpha/theta wave ratios) – higher cognitive load suggests increased engagement.
    *   **Emotional Arousal:** Measured via GSR/EDA – increased arousal indicates greater emotional connection.
    *   **Attentional Focus:** Measured via HRV – consistent HRV suggests focused attention.
*   **Content Weighting Adjustment:** Implement a dynamic weighting system where:
    *   High Engagement Score = Increased content weight (more likely to be presented) & potentially slower scrolling speed.
    *   Low Engagement Score = Decreased content weight & faster scrolling speed (skipping less interesting content).
*   **Calibration Phase:** Initial calibration phase where the system learns baseline biofeedback levels for the user during neutral/resting states.
*   **Real-Time Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   `Content Weight = Base Weight + (Engagement Score * Sensitivity Factor)`
    *   `Scroll Speed = Base Scroll Speed * (1 - (Engagement Score * Speed Factor))`
    *   Sensitivity Factor & Speed Factor are tunable parameters determined during calibration & user preference settings.
*   **Content Tagging:**  The system needs to tag each content item with its initial weight.
*   **Data Buffering:** Implement a rolling buffer to store biofeedback data for smoothing and noise reduction. Minimum buffer length: 5 seconds.
*   **Privacy Controls:**  Provide users with granular control over biofeedback data collection and usage. Clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms. Local data storage option. Data anonymization and aggregation features.
*   **API Integration:** Expose an API for third-party developers to integrate biofeedback data into their content creation and delivery systems.
*   **Hardware Support:** Support a range of commercially available biosensors with standardized data formats.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling for biosensor connectivity issues and data anomalies. Fallback to traditional relevance scoring if biosensor data is unavailable.



**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
calibrateBiosensor()
establishBaselineEngagement()

// Main Loop
while (userIsBrowsing) {
    biosensorData = readBiosensorData()
    engagementScore = calculateEngagementScore(biosensorData)

    contentItem = getNextContentItem()
    contentItem.weight = adjustContentWeight(contentItem.weight, engagementScore)

    scrollSpeed = calculateScrollSpeed(engagementScore)

    presentContent(contentItem, scrollSpeed)

    if (userGestureDetected) {
        processGesture(contentItem)
    }
}
```
