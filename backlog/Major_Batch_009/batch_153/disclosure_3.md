## Adaptive Focal Point Encoding for VR/AR

**Concept:** Expand upon the idea of encoding based on 3D projection space characteristics by dynamically adjusting encoding fidelity *around* predicted or user-defined focal points within the scene. This creates a "sweet spot" of high-resolution rendering while aggressively compressing peripheral regions, optimizing bandwidth and processing power.

**Specifications:**

**1. Focal Point Determination Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw image frame, User gaze tracking data (VR/AR headset), Scene depth map (optional – can be estimated), Predicted area of interest (AI-driven).
*   **Process:**
    *   Fuse user gaze, depth map, and AI prediction to determine a primary focal point (x, y, z coordinates within the 3D projection space).
    *   Calculate a focal radius (configurable parameter – default 10 degrees field of view).
    *   Identify secondary focal points based on object recognition (AI) and their proximity to the primary focal point. Weight secondary focal points based on object significance (e.g., faces, text).
*   **Output:** List of focal points with associated weights and radii.

**2. Encoding Parameter Modulation Module:**

*   **Input:** Focal point list, Raw image frame, Encoding quality presets (Low, Medium, High).
*   **Process:**
    *   Divide image frame into variable-sized encoding blocks. Block size dynamically adjusted based on proximity to focal points (smaller blocks near focal points, larger blocks in periphery).
    *   For each encoding block:
        *   Calculate distance and angle relative to nearest focal point.
        *   Determine quantization parameter (QP) based on distance and angle.  QP decreases (higher quality) as proximity to focal points increases.  A sigmoid function can be used to map distance/angle to QP.
        *   Implement a 'sweet spot' effect where a circular region around the primary focal point uses a fixed, high-quality QP regardless of other factors.
        *   Implement 'foveated rendering' techniques within the sweet spot to further optimize performance.
        *   Optionally, adjust chroma subsampling based on distance to focal points. Reduce chroma subsampling in the periphery.
        *   Implement adaptive bit-rate control based on motion vector analysis. Regions with high motion receive higher bit-rates.
*   **Output:** Per-block encoding parameters (QP, chroma subsampling, bit-rate).

**3. Encoding Engine Integration:**

*   Integrate the above modules with a standard video codec (e.g., H.265, AV1).
*   Codec must support per-block or region-based encoding parameter control.
*   Implement a data stream format that includes metadata specifying the focal point locations and encoding parameters for each frame.

**Pseudocode (Encoding Parameter Modulation Module):**

```
function modulate_encoding_parameters(frame, focal_points, quality_preset):
  encoding_parameters = {}
  for block in frame.blocks:
    nearest_focal_point = find_nearest_focal_point(block, focal_points)
    distance = calculate_distance(block, nearest_focal_point)
    angle = calculate_angle(block, nearest_focal_point)

    qp = base_qp(quality_preset) //Initial value based on preset

    //Adjust based on distance and angle
    qp = qp - (distance * distance_weight)
    qp = qp - (angle * angle_weight)

    //Clamp qp to valid range
    qp = clamp(qp, min_qp, max_qp)

    //Sweet Spot effect
    if is_within_sweet_spot(block, primary_focal_point, sweet_spot_radius):
      qp = high_quality_qp

    encoding_parameters[block] = {
      "qp": qp,
      "chroma_subsampling": calculate_chroma_subsampling(distance),
      "bitrate": calculate_bitrate(motion_vectors(block))
    }

  return encoding_parameters
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significant bandwidth savings.
*   Reduced processing requirements.
*   Improved perceived visual quality by focusing resources on areas of interest.
*   Scalability to different VR/AR headsets and display resolutions.
