## Dynamic Highlight Personalization via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend automated highlight generation by incorporating real-time biofeedback data from the viewer to dynamically adjust highlight clip selection and presentation, creating a truly personalized experience.

**Specs:**

**1. Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**
   *   **Hardware:** Support integration with readily available wearable biofeedback sensors (heart rate monitors, galvanic skin response (GSR) sensors, EEG headsets). Open API for adding new sensor types.
   *   **Data Acquisition:** Real-time capture of biofeedback data streams via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. Data preprocessing (noise filtering, artifact removal) performed on the device or edge server.
   *   **Synchronization:** Precise timestamping of biofeedback data synchronized with the event’s audio and video streams.

**2. Emotional State Estimation:**
   *   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a multi-modal ML model (RNN, LSTM, or Transformer-based) to map biofeedback data to emotional states (e.g., excitement, tension, joy, boredom).
   *   **Personalized Calibration:** Implement a calibration phase where the viewer performs specific actions (e.g., watching short clips, imagining scenarios) while biofeedback data is recorded to personalize the emotional state estimation model.
   *   **Emotional State Output:** Continuous output of estimated emotional state (e.g., a vector representing probabilities for different emotions) with low latency.

**3. Dynamic Highlight Adjustment:**
   *   **Highlight Library:** Maintain a database of pre-generated highlight clips, each tagged with emotional characteristics (e.g., "high energy," "dramatic," "funny").
   *   **Real-time Clip Selection:** Based on the viewer’s current emotional state, dynamically select highlight clips from the library that align with or complement that state.
        *   *If viewer is experiencing high excitement:* Select clips with high energy and fast pacing.
        *   *If viewer is experiencing tension:* Select clips with dramatic pauses or suspenseful moments.
        *   *If viewer is experiencing boredom:* Select clips with unexpected twists or humorous elements.
   *   **Clip Stitching:** Seamlessly stitch together selected clips to create a continuous, personalized highlight reel.
   *   **Dynamic Duration Adjustment:** Adjust the duration of clips based on emotional intensity. Longer clips for moments of high engagement, shorter clips for moments of low engagement.

**4. Feedback Loop and Model Refinement:**
   *   **Explicit Feedback:** Allow viewers to provide explicit feedback on selected clips (e.g., thumbs up/down).
   *   **Implicit Feedback:**  Use biofeedback data as implicit feedback.  A drop in engagement (e.g., decreasing heart rate) after a clip is played indicates a poor selection.
   *   **Model Training:** Continuously train the emotional state estimation model and highlight selection algorithm using both explicit and implicit feedback. Federated learning approach for privacy preservation.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (event is live) {
  // Get biofeedback data
  bioData = getBiofeedbackData();

  // Estimate emotional state
  emotionalState = estimateEmotionalState(bioData);

  // Select highlight clip
  clip = selectHighlightClip(emotionalState);

  // Play clip
  playClip(clip);

  // Get feedback (explicit/implicit)
  feedback = getFeedback(clip);

  // Update models
  updateModels(feedback);
}

// Function: selectHighlightClip
function selectHighlightClip(emotionalState) {
  // Filter clips based on emotional tags
  filteredClips = filterClipsByEmotionalTags(emotionalState);

  // Rank clips based on relevance and diversity
  rankedClips = rankClips(filteredClips);

  // Select the top-ranked clip
  selectedClip = rankedClips[0];

  return selectedClip;
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Multi-Viewer Personalization:** Adapt highlights based on the collective emotional states of multiple viewers (e.g., a group watching a game together).
*   **Genre-Specific Models:** Develop specialized models for different event types (e.g., sports, concerts, movies).
*   **AR/VR Integration:**  Integrate personalized highlights into augmented or virtual reality experiences.
*   **Predictive Highlighting:**  Utilize pre-event data (e.g., team statistics, artist popularity) to predict moments of high excitement and pre-generate highlights.
