## Automated Fiber Optic Cleaning Station – Integrated Airflow & Static Dissipation

**Concept:** A self-contained cleaning station for fiber optic connectors leveraging localized airflow, static dissipation, and a modular consumable system. This expands upon the 'protection' aspect of the existing patent, transitioning from passive protection to *active* maintenance & cleaning.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Unit – Physical Dimensions:**
    *   Height: 30cm
    *   Width: 20cm
    *   Depth: 15cm
    *   Material: ABS Plastic with ESD Coating
    *   Weight: 2kg

**2. Airflow System:**
    *   Miniature Blower (Brushless DC, low noise – <30dB) – Located in base unit.
    *   Airflow Rate: Adjustable, 5-20 CFM.
    *   Air Filter: HEPA filter (replaceable) located at air intake.
    *   Nozzle Design: Conical nozzle with adjustable aperture (1mm-5mm).  Nozzle material: Conductive Silicone.
    *   Airflow Path: Air drawn in through filter, channeled to nozzle, focused on connector ferrule.

**3. Static Dissipation System:**
    *   Ionizer: Miniature negative ion generator (produces <10kV of ions). Located near nozzle outlet.
    *   Grounding: Unit connected to earth ground via power cord.
    *   Conductive Materials: Nozzle, ferrule holder, and internal components utilize conductive materials to dissipate static charge.

**4. Ferrule Holder & Alignment:**
    *   Universal Ferrule Holder: Designed to accommodate LC, SC, ST, and MPO connectors.
    *   Self-Centering Mechanism: Spring-loaded mechanism to center the connector within the holder.
    *   Visual Alignment Aid: Integrated LED illumination and a magnifying lens to visually confirm proper alignment.

**5. Consumable System:**
    *   Cleaning Wipes: Pre-moistened, lint-free wipes housed in a replaceable cartridge. Wipes automatically advance after each cleaning cycle.
    *   Wipe Delivery System: Micro-servo controlled arm to present a clean wipe to the ferrule.
    *   Cartridge Capacity: 50 wipes.
    *   Cartridge Detection: Optical sensor to detect low wipe levels.

**6. Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller: ARM Cortex-M4 based microcontroller.
    *   User Interface: 2.4" TFT LCD with capacitive touchscreen.
    *   Cleaning Modes:
        *   **Auto Mode:** Automatically cycles through airflow, ionization, and wipe cleaning.
        *   **Airflow Only:** Continuous airflow for dust removal.
        *   **Ionization Only:** Static charge neutralization.
        *   **Manual Mode:** User control over airflow, ionization, and wipe delivery.
    *   Error Detection: Sensors to detect wipe cartridge errors, airflow obstructions, and system malfunctions.
    *   Connectivity: USB port for firmware updates and data logging.

  }

  If (Input == "Airflow Only") {
    Activate Airflow (User Defined Speed)
  }

  If (Input == "Ionization Only") {
    Activate Ionizer
  }

  If (Input == "Settings") {
    // Access Configuration Options (Airflow Speed, etc.)
  }
}
```

**8. Future Enhancements:**
    *   Automated Ferrule Inspection via Micro-Camera.
    *   Real-time Dust/Contamination Level Reporting.
    *   Wireless Connectivity (Bluetooth/WiFi).
    *   Integration with Remote Monitoring/Management Systems.
    *   Self-Calibration Routines.
