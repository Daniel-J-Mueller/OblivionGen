## Gaze-Contingent Procedural Environment Generation

**Concept:** Leverage gaze prediction to dynamically alter a virtual or augmented reality environment *procedurally*, creating a responsive and personalized experience. This moves beyond static environment adaptation to actively *building* the environment around the user's attention.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Module: Procedural Generation Engine**

*   **Input:** Gaze direction (x, y, z – normalized vector), gaze fixation duration (milliseconds), scene context data (pre-existing environment mesh, object types, lighting), user profile (preferences, historical gaze data).
*   **Output:** Modified environment mesh, object placement data, updated lighting parameters, procedural asset instantiation requests.
*   **Procedural Ruleset:** A library of rules defining how gaze input affects the environment. Examples:
    *   **Detail Enhancement:**  Areas receiving sustained gaze (above a threshold duration) receive increased geometric detail (e.g., tessellation, displacement mapping) and texture resolution.
    *   **Object Instantiation:** Fixations on empty spaces trigger the procedural creation of relevant objects. Object type selection is based on scene context and user profile (e.g., gazing at a barren wall might trigger the creation of a painting, a bookshelf, or a window).
    *   **Environmental Storytelling:** Gaze-driven object placement and scene modification can construct a narrative.  A user repeatedly looking at a closed door might trigger the door to slowly open, revealing a hidden room or clue.
    *   **Dynamic Obstruction:** Gaze can create or remove temporary obstructions within the environment. A quick glance towards a path might cause virtual foliage to briefly grow, obscuring it.
    *   **Aesthetic Modification:** Gaze duration and direction influence color palettes, lighting styles, and the application of visual effects.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive gaze data & scene context.
    2.  Identify Areas of Interest (AOI) – regions receiving sustained gaze.
    3.  Apply procedural rules to AOI based on rule priority and user profile.
    4.  Generate modified environment data.
    5.  Output data to rendering engine.

**2.  Gaze Prediction Integration Module**

*   **Input:** Raw camera feed, gaze direction data (from the provided patent's core functionality).
*   **Output:**  Refined gaze data including fixation detection, dwell time calculation, and a "gaze heat map" representing areas of sustained attention.
*   **Filtering:** Implement a Kalman filter to smooth gaze data and reduce jitter.
*   **Fixation Detection:** Utilize a dispersion threshold algorithm to identify stable gaze fixations.
*   **Dwell Time Calculation:** Track the duration of each fixation.
*   **Heatmap Generation:** Create a 2D heatmap overlayed onto the environment, indicating areas receiving the most attention.  This provides a visual representation of user focus.

**3.  Rendering Engine Interface**

*   **Input:** Modified environment data (from the Procedural Generation Engine).
*   **Output:** Rendered virtual or augmented reality environment.
*   **Dynamic Mesh Updates:**  Support for real-time mesh updates to accommodate procedural changes.
*   **Streaming Assets:** Implement a streaming asset system to load procedural assets on demand.
*   **Level of Detail (LOD) Management:** Adjust the level of detail of procedural assets based on viewing distance and gaze direction.

**Pseudocode (Procedural Generation Engine):**

```
function GenerateProceduralEnvironment(gazeData, sceneContext, userProfile):
  heatmap = CalculateGazeHeatmap(gazeData)
  for region in sceneContext:
    attentionLevel = heatmap.getAttention(region)
    if attentionLevel > threshold:
      rule = SelectProceduralRule(region, attentionLevel, userProfile)
      if rule != null:
        ApplyProceduralRule(region, rule)
  return modifiedScene
```

**Novelty:** This extends gaze prediction beyond simply tracking where a user looks. It actively *uses* that information to build and modify the environment in real-time, creating a truly personalized and responsive experience. This differs from existing adaptive environments which typically respond to broad user actions or predefined rules. This is a dynamic, gaze-driven construction of reality.
