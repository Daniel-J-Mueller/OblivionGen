## Dynamic Emotional Layering for Media

**Concept:** Extend the selective content presentation to incorporate real-time emotional analysis of the user and dynamically adjust media presentation *beyond* simple suppression or enrichment. This builds on the existing idea of content tags, expanding them to include emotional valence and arousal data.

**Specs:**

**1. Emotional Input Module:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrate access to a suite of sensors including:
    *   Facial Expression Analysis (camera-based)
    *   Voice Tone Analysis (microphone-based)
    *   Biometric Data (heart rate, skin conductance – via wearable integration)
    *   Textual Input Analysis (sentiment analysis of typed/spoken input).
*   **Emotional State Estimation:** Develop an AI model (trained on labeled emotional data) to infer the user’s current emotional state (e.g., happy, sad, angry, anxious, neutral) with associated valence (positive/negative) and arousal (high/low) levels. Output: `EmotionalState = {emotion: "string", valence: "float", arousal: "float"}`.
*   **Calibration/Personalization:** Implement a calibration routine where the system learns to accurately map sensor data to the user’s emotional responses. Allow the user to manually correct misinterpretations.

**2. Content Emotional Tagging:**

*   **Expanded Tag Schema:** Augment existing content tags with emotional profile data. Example: `ContentTag = {contentType: "string", contentID: "string", emotionalProfile: [{scene: "int", emotion: "string", valence: "float", arousal: "float"}]}`.
*   **Automated Tagging:** Develop algorithms to automatically analyze media content (video, audio, text) and generate preliminary emotional profiles.  Utilize scene detection for granular tagging.
*   **User-Created Tags:** Allow users to manually add or modify emotional tags for content.

**3. Dynamic Media Layering Engine:**

*   **Emotional Resonance Algorithm:** Develop an algorithm to determine the degree of emotional resonance between the user’s current emotional state and the emotional profile of the content.  Consider valence, arousal, and specific emotion types.
*   **Dynamic Layering:** Implement a system to dynamically adjust media presentation based on emotional resonance.  This goes beyond suppression/enrichment to include:
    *   **Color Grading:** Adjust color temperature and saturation to enhance or dampen emotional impact.
    *   **Audio Mixing:**  Adjust volume levels of different audio elements (music, sound effects, dialogue) to emphasize or de-emphasize emotional cues.
    *   **Visual Effects:** Add or remove subtle visual effects (e.g., bloom, vignette, motion blur) to enhance emotional atmosphere.
    *   **Pacing Adjustment:**  Dynamically adjust playback speed or insert short pauses to alter the pacing of the content.
*   **Layering Profiles:** Allow users to create custom layering profiles tailored to their preferences. Example: “Comfort Mode” (gentle layering, positive reinforcement), “Intense Mode” (heightened emotional impact), "Neutral Mode" (minimal alteration).

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Modular Design:** Implement a modular architecture to facilitate the integration of new sensors, algorithms, and layering effects.
*   **API Exposure:** Expose APIs to allow third-party developers to create custom layering effects and integrations.
*   **Data Logging & Analysis:** Log user emotional states, content tags, and layering effects to enable data-driven optimization and personalization.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
function adjustMedia(content, userEmotionalState) {
  contentEmotionalProfile = getContentEmotionalProfile(content);
  resonanceScore = calculateEmotionalResonance(userEmotionalState, contentEmotionalProfile);

  if (resonanceScore > thresholdPositive) {
    // Enhance positive emotions
    applyLayeringEffect(content, "positiveEnhancement");
  } else if (resonanceScore < thresholdNegative) {
    // Mitigate negative emotions
    applyLayeringEffect(content, "negativeMitigation");
  } else {
    // Maintain neutral presentation
    // Apply default layering profile
  }
}
