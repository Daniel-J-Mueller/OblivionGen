## Adaptive Illumination Normalization with Temporal Filtering

**Concept:** Expand the discontinuity detection to proactively *normalize* illumination changes, rather than just detect them, improving motion detection robustness and enabling more accurate scene understanding. This system doesn’t just say “illumination changed”, it adjusts the image to *compensate* for that change.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Illumination Map Generation:**
    *   Utilize a rolling window of N frames (N > 4, configurable).
    *   For each pixel, calculate the mean and standard deviation of pixel intensity across the rolling window.
    *   Generate an “Illumination Map” where each pixel’s value represents the standard deviation of its intensity over time. High values indicate significant illumination fluctuations.
    *   Implement a spatial smoothing filter (e.g., Gaussian blur) on the Illumination Map to reduce noise and highlight broad illumination changes.

2.  **Adaptive Gain Control:**
    *   For each pixel in the current frame, calculate a gain factor based on its corresponding value in the Illumination Map.
    *   The gain factor is inversely proportional to the Illumination Map value:  `Gain = 1 + (k * (1 / IlluminationMapValue))` where `k` is a tunable scaling factor.  This boosts the signal in areas with low illumination stability.
    *   Apply the gain factor to the pixel intensity. This effectively normalizes the illumination, reducing the impact of flickering lights or shadows.

3.  **Temporal Filtering & Discontinuity Detection Refinement:**
    *   After applying adaptive gain control, re-implement the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) calculation described in the provided patent.
    *   Apply a temporal median filter to the SSD values over a short window (e.g., 3-5 frames). This further reduces noise and stabilizes the detection process.
    *   The core discontinuity detection logic remains the same, but now operates on the *normalized* image data.
    *   The convolution kernel parameters (α) and threshold values are dynamically adjusted based on the overall scene’s illumination variability (calculated from the Illumination Map).

4.  **Event Triggered Refinement:**
    *   If a significant discontinuity is *still* detected after normalization and filtering:
        *   Initiate a localized analysis of the discontinuity region.
        *   Employ a more advanced edge detection algorithm (e.g., Canny edge detection) to determine if the discontinuity is due to genuine motion or residual illumination artifacts.
        *   Adjust the adaptive gain control parameters dynamically based on the characteristics of the identified artifacts.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
rollingWindow = new CircularBuffer(N);
for each frame in videoStream:
    // 1. Illumination Map Generation
    pixelIntensities = extractPixelIntensities(frame);
    rollingWindow.add(pixelIntensities);
    standardDeviations = calculateStandardDeviations(rollingWindow);
    illuminationMap = applyGaussianBlur(standardDeviations);

    // 2. Adaptive Gain Control
    gainMap = 1 + (k * (1 / illuminationMap));
    normalizedFrame = frame * gainMap;

    // 3. Temporal Filtering & Discontinuity Detection
    ssdValues = calculateSSD(normalizedFrame, previousFrame);
    filteredSSD = applyTemporalMedianFilter(ssdValues);

    if (filteredSSD > threshold):
        // Event Triggered Refinement
        edgeMap = cannyEdgeDetection(normalizedFrame);
        if (edgeMap indicates motion):
            // Motion detected
            generateAlert();
        else:
            // Adjust gain parameters
            updateGainParameters(edgeMap);
    
    previousFrame = normalizedFrame;
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Dedicated image processing hardware (GPU or FPGA) for efficient pixel-level operations.
*   Sufficient memory bandwidth to handle large image data and rolling window buffers.
*   Real-time operating system (RTOS) for deterministic performance.
