## Dynamic Resource Credit Swapping & Market

**Concept:** Extend the resource credit system to allow *swapping* of credits between virtual compute instances, creating a dynamic, internal market for compute resources. This addresses situations where one VM has excess credits and another is critically short, even across different user accounts (with permissions).

**Specification:**

**1. Credit Swapping Agent (CSA):**  Each virtual compute instance will host a Credit Swapping Agent.

   * **Monitoring:** Continuously monitors the individual resource credit balance.
   * **Prediction:** Predicts future resource credit needs based on historical usage patterns (CPU, Memory, Network I/O).  Uses a simple moving average, with configurable weighting for recent data.
   * **Offer/Request Generation:** 
      * If the predicted balance will be *positive* beyond a threshold (configurable), the CSA generates ‘offer’ messages indicating credits available for swap, along with a price (credits per credit – a floating point number).
      * If the predicted balance will be *negative*, the CSA generates ‘request’ messages indicating credits needed, and a maximum acceptable price.
   * **Communication:** The CSA broadcasts offer/request messages to a centralized ‘Credit Exchange’ service.

**2. Credit Exchange Service (CES):**  A centralized service managing the credit swapping market.

   * **Matching Engine:**  Matches offer and request messages based on price. Prioritizes matches where the offer price is less than or equal to the request price.  Uses a first-come, first-served approach for matches with identical prices.
   * **Transaction Management:**  Facilitates the credit transfer between virtual compute instances.  Logs all transactions for auditing and accounting.
   * **Permission Control:** Enforces policies for cross-account credit swapping (e.g., requiring explicit user authorization, limiting the total amount of credits that can be swapped).
   * **Price Discovery:** Tracks average offer/request prices to provide real-time market data.
   * **API:** Provides an API for administrators to monitor the market, adjust policies, and intervene in transactions.

**3.  Integration with Existing System:**

   * **Control Plane Modification:** The existing control plane receives notifications from the CES about completed credit swaps.  It updates the resource credit balances of the affected virtual compute instances.
   * **Security:**  All communication between the CSA, CES, and Control Plane is secured using TLS.
   * **Auditing:**  All transactions are logged with timestamps, involved virtual compute instances, amounts, and prices.

**Pseudocode (CSA - simplified):**

```pseudocode
loop:
    currentBalance = getResourceCreditBalance()
    predictedBalance = predictFutureBalance(historicalUsageData)

    if predictedBalance > POSITIVE_THRESHOLD:
        offerPrice = calculateOfferPrice()
        createOfferMessage(offerPrice, availableCredits)
        sendToCreditExchange(offerMessage)
    elif predictedBalance < NEGATIVE_THRESHOLD:
        maxAcceptablePrice = calculateMaxAcceptablePrice()
        createRequestMessage(maxAcceptablePrice, requiredCredits)
        sendToCreditExchange(requestMessage)
    end
end
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static credit allocation to a dynamic, market-driven approach. It increases resource utilization by allowing VMs to ‘borrow’ resources from others, and potentially creates a more efficient and responsive cloud infrastructure.  Existing systems are largely focused on *provisioning* credits; this focuses on *exchanging* them. The inter-account functionality with permissioning is also novel.
