## Adaptive Authentication Weighting & Dynamic Thresholds

**Concept:** Extend the multi-layered authentication to incorporate a dynamic weighting system for each authentication layer *and* adaptive thresholds based on real-time risk assessment. Instead of a static progression through layers, the system assesses risk *after each layer* and dynamically adjusts which subsequent layers are engaged, and to what degree.

**Specifications:**

*   **Risk Engine:** A real-time risk engine analyzes request characteristics (IP reputation, geo-location, time of day, user behavior, request frequency, data sensitivity requested) and assigns a risk score. This engine is continuously trained via machine learning.
*   **Authentication Layer Weighting:** Each authentication layer (e.g., basic credential check, MFA, behavioral biometrics) is assigned a weighting factor reflecting its effectiveness against different threat types. These weights are configurable and adjustable via policy.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:** Each layer has an associated threshold.  If the risk score *after* a layer is below the threshold, subsequent layers can be skipped. If the risk score is above a higher threshold, additional layers can be engaged.
*   **Layer Prioritization:**  Layers aren't strictly sequential.  The risk engine can *select* which layers to engage based on the detected risk profile.  For instance, a low-risk request might only require the initial credential check, while a high-risk request might trigger MFA *and* behavioral biometrics simultaneously.
*   **Feedback Loop:**  Authentication success/failure feeds back into the risk engine to refine the risk model and weighting factors.  False positives/negatives are used for continuous improvement.
*   **Adaptive MFA Challenge:** The type of MFA challenge presented (e.g., push notification, SMS code, biometric scan) is dynamically selected based on risk and user preference.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION AuthenticateRequest(request):
  riskScore = RiskEngine.CalculateInitialRisk(request)
  
  // First Layer: Basic Credential Check
  IF BasicCredentialCheck(request) == SUCCESS:
    riskScore = RiskEngine.UpdateRiskAfterLayer(riskScore, "BasicCredCheckSuccess")
  ELSE:
    RETURN FAILURE
  
  // Dynamic Layer Selection
  IF riskScore < LowRiskThreshold:
    RETURN SUCCESS // Request Approved
  
  // Evaluate for subsequent layers
  IF riskScore < MediumRiskThreshold:
    // Engage MFA Layer
    IF MFALayer(request) == SUCCESS:
      riskScore = RiskEngine.UpdateRiskAfterLayer(riskScore, "MFASuccess")
      IF riskScore < HighRiskThreshold:
          RETURN SUCCESS
    ELSE:
        RETURN FAILURE
  
  // Highest Risk - Engage Advanced Biometrics & Monitoring
  IF riskScore > HighRiskThreshold:
    IF AdvancedBiometricsLayer(request) == SUCCESS:
        riskScore = RiskEngine.UpdateRiskAfterLayer(riskScore, "BiometricsSuccess")
        IF riskScore < CriticalThreshold:
            RETURN SUCCESS
        ELSE:
            // Trigger Incident Response - potential attack in progress
            TriggerIncidentResponse()
            RETURN FAILURE
    ELSE:
        RETURN FAILURE

  RETURN FAILURE // Default failure if something goes wrong
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Real-time risk engine (machine learning platform - TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Scalable authentication services (microservices architecture).
*   Secure data store for authentication data and risk profiles.
*   Monitoring and alerting system for incident response.
*   API for integration with existing applications and services.
