## Modular, Adaptive Bag System with Integrated Biometric Lock & Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** A bag system built around a core frame onto which various modular pouches and panels can be attached, combined with a biometric lock for security and haptic feedback for navigation/alerts.

**Core Frame Specifications:**

*   **Material:** Lightweight, high-strength polymer composite (carbon fiber reinforced nylon preferred)
*   **Dimensions:** Customizable base size (Small: 30cm x 20cm x 5cm, Medium: 40cm x 25cm x 8cm, Large: 50cm x 30cm x 10cm).  Dimensions are *internal*.
*   **Attachment System:**  A grid of standardized, recessed POG-pin (Pin-On-Grid) connectors covering the entire exterior surface of the frame. Spacing: 1cm x 1cm. Connector type: Self-locking, quick-release.
*   **Internal Structure:** Semi-rigid internal dividers configurable via Velcro or magnetic attachment points.
*   **Power:** Integrated rechargeable battery (USB-C charging). Capacity: 5000 mAh. Battery life: 24 hours (typical use).
*   **Sensors:** 
    *   Biometric scanner (fingerprint or facial recognition) integrated into the frame’s access point (main opening).
    *   IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit - accelerometer, gyroscope) for motion tracking.
    *   Proximity sensors (4x, one per side) for collision detection.

**Modular Pouch/Panel Specifications:**

*   **Material:** Varied - ballistic nylon, waterproof canvas, transparent TPU, etc. (User selectable)
*   **Attachment:** Matching POG-pin connectors on the back surface, aligning with the core frame grid.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Standard Pouches:** Various sizes for holding items.
    *   **Water Bottle Holder:** Specifically designed for standard water bottle sizes.
    *   **Laptop Sleeve:** Padded sleeve for laptops (13”, 15”, 17”).
    *   **Transparent Panel:**  Allows viewing of contents without opening the bag.  (TPU material)
    *   **Wireless Charging Pad:** Integrated wireless charging pad for phones/devices. (Requires power connection to core frame)
    *   **Expandable Compartment:**  Accordion-style compartment for increasing storage capacity.
    *   **Heated/Cooled Compartment:** Small compartment to maintain food/drink temperature.

**Haptic Feedback System:**

*   **Actuators:** Array of small vibration motors embedded within the core frame.
*   **Control:** Controlled by onboard microcontroller based on:
    *   **Navigation:** Using IMU data, provide directional cues (e.g., vibrate left side for "turn left").  Requires connection to a smartphone navigation app.
    *   **Proximity Alerts:**  Vibrate when the bag is getting too close to obstacles detected by proximity sensors.
    *   **Security Alerts:**  Vibrate/flash if the biometric lock is tampered with or the bag is moved without authorization.
    *   **Custom Alerts:**  User-defined alerts triggered by smartphone notifications.

**Biometric Lock:**

*   **Sensor:** High-resolution fingerprint scanner *or* facial recognition camera.
*   **Security:** Encrypted storage of biometric data.
*   **Override:** Physical key override for emergency access.
*   **Authentication:** Only authorized users can access the bag’s contents.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Feedback Control):**

```
function processIMUData(accelerationX, accelerationY, gyroscopeZ) {
  if (abs(accelerationX) > threshold) {
    vibrateLeftOrRight(accelerationX > 0); //Vibrate left/right based on acceleration
  }
}

function checkProximitySensors(sensor1, sensor2, sensor3, sensor4) {
  if (sensor1 < distanceThreshold OR sensor2 < distanceThreshold OR sensor3 < distanceThreshold OR sensor4 < distanceThreshold) {
    vibrateAll(); //Vibrate if object is too close
  }
}

function handleSecurityAlert() {
  vibrateRapidly();
  flashLED();
}

function mainLoop() {
  processIMUData();
  checkProximitySensors();
  // Check security status
  // ...
}
```

This system allows for extreme customization and adaptation. Users can configure the bag to fit their specific needs and add functionality as required. The biometric lock and haptic feedback system provide enhanced security and convenience.
