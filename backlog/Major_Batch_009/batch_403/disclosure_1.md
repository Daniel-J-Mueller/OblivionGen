## Thermal Gradient Slab for Targeted Cooling

**Concept:** Expand upon the slab-based cooling concept by introducing a thermally stratified slab – a slab constructed with varying thermal conductivity materials arranged to create a temperature gradient *within* the slab itself. This allows for localized cooling and heat distribution tailored to the specific heat load profile of the data center or room.

**Specifications:**

*   **Slab Construction:** Multi-layered composite slab. Layers composed of materials with differing thermal conductivities (e.g., concrete, graphite-infused concrete, aerogel composites, phase change materials). Layer thicknesses and material selection determined by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling and heat load mapping.
*   **Zonal Control:** Slab divided into thermally distinct zones (e.g., high-density zones directly under server racks, lower-density zones under aisles). Each zone independently controlled via embedded thermoelectric modules (TEMs) or microchannel heat exchangers.
*   **Fluid Circulation:** A network of microchannels embedded *within* the slab layers, running both horizontally and vertically. Multiple independent fluid circuits serving different thermal zones. Fluid: dielectric coolant (e.g., fluorinert) to prevent electrical shorts.
*   **Sensor Network:** Dense array of temperature, humidity, and heat flux sensors embedded throughout the slab and within the fluid circuits. Real-time data fed to a central control unit.
*   **Control Algorithm:** Predictive control algorithm utilizing machine learning. Learns heat load patterns and dynamically adjusts fluid flow rates and TEM/heat exchanger outputs to maintain optimal temperature distribution. Algorithm prioritizes maintaining a consistent dew point temperature across the slab surface.
*   **Integration with Raised Floor:** Slab designed to integrate seamlessly with a raised floor system. The space between the slab and the raised floor utilized for fluid distribution manifolds and sensor network cabling.
*    **Phase Change Material Integration:** Utilize PCM integrated into zones of high heat flux. The PCM will absorb excess heat and keep the zones more thermally stable. PCM will need to be dynamically refreshed through the existing system.

**Pseudocode – Control Algorithm:**

```
// Define Variables
target_dewpoint = 15.0 // degrees Celsius
heat_map[x, y] = // 2D array representing heat load
slab_temp[x, y] = // 2D array representing slab temperature
fluid_flow_rate[x, y] = // 2D array representing fluid flow rate
tem_output[x, y] = // 2D array representing thermoelectric module output

// Main Loop
while (true) {

  // Read Sensor Data
  Read heat_map[x, y] from sensor network
  Read slab_temp[x, y] from sensor network

  // Calculate Predicted Heat Load
  predicted_heat_load = HeatLoadPredictionModel(heat_map, historical_data)

  // Calculate Optimal Fluid Flow Rates
  fluid_flow_rate[x, y] = CalculateFluidFlow(predicted_heat_load[x, y], slab_temp[x, y], target_dewpoint)

  // Calculate Optimal TEM Outputs
  tem_output[x, y] = CalculateTemOutput(predicted_heat_load[x, y], slab_temp[x, y], target_dewpoint)

  // Apply Control Signals
  SetFluidFlowRates(fluid_flow_rate)
  SetTemOutputs(tem_output)

  //Log Data for Machine Learning Model
  LogData(heat_map, slab_temp, fluid_flow_rate, tem_output)
}
