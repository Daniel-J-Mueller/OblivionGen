## Dynamic Permission Inheritance with Temporal Decay

**Concept:** Extend the graph database permissions model to incorporate a time-based decay factor for inherited permissions. This allows for permissions to be granted temporarily and automatically revoked after a set duration, even if the granting group or user remains active. This is particularly useful for just-in-time access, temporary project teams, or sensitive data with time-limited access requirements.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Edge Attributes:**  Introduce a `decay_rate` attribute to each directed edge in the graph. This attribute represents the rate at which permission is lost over time.  A value of 0 indicates permanent permission. Higher values indicate faster decay.  The unit of time will be configurable (e.g., hours, days, weeks).

2.  **Permission Evaluation Function:** Modify the path determination logic to include a "permission strength" calculation for each edge in the path. The permission strength will be determined by the `decay_rate` and the time elapsed since the permission was granted (or inherited).

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_permission_strength(edge, last_granted_time):
        decay_rate = edge.decay_rate
        time_elapsed = current_time - last_granted_time
        strength = 1.0 - (decay_rate * time_elapsed)
        return max(0.0, strength) // Ensure strength doesn't go below 0
    ```

3.  **Path Scoring:** During path determination, calculate a cumulative permission score for the entire path. This score is the product of the permission strengths of all edges in the path.

    ```pseudocode
    function calculate_path_score(path):
        score = 1.0
        for edge in path:
            score *= calculate_permission_strength(edge, edge.last_granted_time)
        return score
    ```

4.  **Access Control Threshold:**  Define a minimum acceptable path score for access to be granted. This threshold will be configurable based on the sensitivity of the resource. 

5.  **Permission Propagation:** When a permission is granted to a group, propagate the permission to all member nodes, along with the initial `last_granted_time`. When a user inherits permission through a group, record the inheritance time. The `decay_rate` is inherited.

6.  **Background Refresh:** Implement a background process that periodically recalculates permission scores for all active paths. This ensures that permissions are automatically revoked when the score falls below the threshold.

7.  **Graph Node Attributes:** Add a `last_granted_time` attribute to each node representing a user or group. This attribute records the last time the node received a permission or inherited a permission.

8.  **API Endpoints:** Add API endpoints to:
    *   Set the `decay_rate` when granting permissions.
    *   Query the current permission strength for a given user-resource pair.
    *   Force a recalculation of permissions.

**Use Cases:**

*   **Temporary Access:** Grant access to a shared drive for the duration of a project.
*   **Just-In-Time Access:** Grant access to sensitive data only when a user needs it for a specific task.
*   **Dynamic Roles:**  Automatically revoke permissions when a user's role changes.
*   **Automated Compliance:**  Ensure that access to sensitive data is automatically revoked after a set period, meeting compliance requirements.
