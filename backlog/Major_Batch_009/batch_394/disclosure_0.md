## Dynamic Data Provenance & Adaptive Query Generation

**Concept:** Extend the system to not only *retrieve* data from heterogeneous sources, but to *actively track* the lineage of that data *through* the query process. This provenance information is then used to dynamically adapt queries *during* execution, improving accuracy and resilience to data inconsistencies.

**Specifications:**

**1. Provenance Capture Module:**

*   **Function:**  Intercepts data retrieved from each datastore.
*   **Data Collected:**
    *   Datastore ID
    *   Query used to retrieve the data
    *   Timestamp of retrieval
    *   Data format and schema
    *   Any transformations applied *immediately* after retrieval (e.g., type conversion)
    *   A unique identifier for this data “chunk”
*   **Storage:**  Provenance data stored in a dedicated, high-throughput graph database optimized for tracing relationships. (Neo4j, JanusGraph)

**2.  Data Quality Assessment Engine:**

*   **Input:** Provenance data, retrieved data.
*   **Function:** Performs real-time data quality checks based on:
    *   **Schema Validation:** Checks if the retrieved data conforms to the expected schema.
    *   **Value Range Checks:** Validates values against expected ranges or allowed lists.
    *   **Data Consistency Checks:**  Compares data from different sources for inconsistencies based on known relationships.  (e.g., customer ID should be unique).
    *   **Freshness Checks:** Determines if the data is within an acceptable time window.
*   **Output:**  A "Quality Score" for each data chunk, and flags indicating the specific types of quality issues detected.

**3. Adaptive Query Rewriter:**

*   **Input:** Original query plan, Quality Scores for retrieved data.
*   **Function:**  Dynamically rewrites queries *during* execution based on data quality. This is a key innovation.
    *   **If Quality Score is low:**
        *   **Source Prioritization:**  If multiple sources provide the same data, the system automatically prioritizes higher-quality sources.
        *   **Query Modification:** Modifies the query to filter out potentially bad data. (e.g., adding a `WHERE` clause based on a known good value).
        *   **Fallback Sources:**  Automatically switches to alternative data sources if the primary source is unreliable.
        *   **Query Augmentation:** Adds additional checks or transformations to the query to compensate for data inconsistencies.
    *   **If Quality Score is high:**  Original query remains unchanged, maximizing performance.
*   **Implementation:** A rule-based engine with customizable rules for query rewriting based on specific data quality issues.

**4.  User Interface Enhancements:**

*   **Data Provenance Visualization:**  A visual interface allowing users to explore the lineage of data, including the sources, transformations, and quality scores.
*   **Query Rewriting Transparency:**  Alerts the user when a query has been rewritten due to data quality issues.
*   **User-Configurable Quality Thresholds:** Allows users to define acceptable data quality levels for different types of data.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Query Rewriter):**

```
function rewrite_query(original_query, data_quality_scores) {
  if (data_quality_scores.is_low()) {
    priority_source = get_highest_priority_source(data_quality_scores);
    if (priority_source != current_source) {
      rewritten_query = rewrite_query_source(original_query, priority_source);
    } else {
       rewritten_query = add_data_quality_filters(original_query, data_quality_scores);
    }
  } else {
    rewritten_query = original_query;
  }
  return rewritten_query;
}
```

**Novelty:** The system doesn’t just *retrieve* data; it actively monitors its quality *during* retrieval and adapts the query process in real-time.  This is a significant improvement over traditional data integration approaches, which typically rely on static data quality rules or manual intervention. The provenance tracking combined with dynamic query rewriting allows for a much more robust and resilient data integration pipeline.
