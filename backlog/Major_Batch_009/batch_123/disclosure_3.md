## Adaptive Authentication Difficulty Scaling

**Concept:** Dynamically adjust the complexity requirements for authentication factors (passwords, biometrics, MFA) *during* a session, based on observed user behavior *and* real-time threat intelligence.  This moves beyond static difficulty levels and considers the ‘trust score’ of the current interaction.

**Specification:**

**1. Core Components:**

*   **Behavioral Analytics Engine:**  Monitors user actions *during* a session – typing speed/pattern, mouse movements, application usage, time spent on tasks, geographical location shifts, device context changes (network, sensors).  These form the 'behavioral fingerprint'.
*   **Threat Intelligence Feed:** Real-time data on emerging threats – known compromised credentials, phishing campaigns, malware signatures, geo-political events impacting security.
*   **Trust Score Calculator:** Combines behavioral data and threat intelligence to generate a dynamic ‘trust score’ for the current session. Higher score = more trusted interaction.
*   **Authentication Factor Manager:** Controls the complexity requirements for each authentication factor (password length, biometric quality, MFA method).

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Initial Authentication:** Standard authentication process establishes baseline trust.
2.  **Session Monitoring:** Behavioral Analytics Engine continuously monitors user activity. Trust Score is calculated.
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   **High Trust Score:**  Reduce authentication friction. For example, temporarily bypass MFA for low-risk actions, or allow simpler passwords.
    *   **Medium Trust Score:** Maintain standard authentication.
    *   **Low Trust Score:** Increase authentication friction. Require stronger passwords, more robust biometrics, or immediate MFA challenges. Trigger behavioral biometrics analysis.
4.  **Adaptive Factor Selection:**  The system could *automatically* switch between authentication factors.  If a user’s typing speed dramatically changes during a sensitive transaction, automatically trigger a biometric challenge *before* completing the action.
5.  **Contextual Awareness:** Integration with application context. A user editing a profile photo requires less authentication than initiating a large financial transfer.
6.  **Anomaly Detection:** Flag unusual behavior patterns for manual review or automated response.

**3. Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(behavioralData, threatIntelligence):
  baseScore = 0.5 // Default starting score

  // Behavioral Analysis
  typingSpeedVariance = calculateTypingSpeedVariance(behavioralData.typingData)
  mouseMovementConsistency = calculateMouseMovementConsistency(behavioralData.mouseData)
  applicationUsageAnomaly = detectApplicationUsageAnomaly(behavioralData.applicationData)

  behavioralScore = 0.5 - (typingSpeedVariance * 0.2) - (mouseMovementConsistency * 0.3) - (applicationUsageAnomaly * 0.4)

  // Threat Intelligence
  ipReputation = getIPReputation(threatIntelligence.ipAddress)
  credentialCompromise = checkCredentialCompromise(threatIntelligence.username)

  threatScore = 0.5 - (ipReputation * 0.3) - (credentialCompromise * 0.5)

  trustScore = (behavioralScore * 0.6) + (threatScore * 0.4)

  // Clamp score between 0 and 1
  trustScore = max(0, min(1, trustScore))

  return trustScore
```

**4. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance processing unit for real-time analysis.
*   Secure storage for behavioral profiles and threat intelligence data.
*   Integration with existing authentication systems (e.g., Active Directory, OAuth).
*   Machine learning libraries for anomaly detection and behavioral modeling.
*   API for accessing threat intelligence feeds.
