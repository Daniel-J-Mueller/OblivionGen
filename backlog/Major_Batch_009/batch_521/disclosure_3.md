## Adaptive Feature Interaction with Dynamic Graph Embeddings

**Concept:** Extend the feature pruning and addition process with a dynamic graph representation of feature interactions, allowing the model to learn *how* features relate and prune/add based on graph connectivity and influence, rather than solely weight magnitude. This moves beyond simple weight-based pruning to a more nuanced understanding of feature importance within a complex system.

**Specs:**

1.  **Feature Graph Construction:**
    *   During initial training, establish a fully connected graph where each node represents a feature.
    *   Edge weights are initialized based on a correlation metric (e.g., Pearson correlation) calculated from the initial observation records.
    *   Implement a ‘decay factor’ – edge weights diminish over time if the feature interaction doesn't contribute significantly to prediction accuracy.

2.  **Graph Embedding Layer:**
    *   Add a Graph Embedding Layer to the model architecture. This layer takes the feature graph as input and generates a low-dimensional embedding for each feature, capturing its relationship with other features.
    *   Embedding generation uses Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) – specifically, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) or Graph Attention Networks (GATs).
    *   Embeddings are concatenated with existing feature vectors before being fed into the linear prediction model.

3.  **Dynamic Pruning & Addition – Graph-Guided:**
    *   **Pruning:** Instead of solely pruning based on weight magnitude, calculate a ‘graph centrality score’ for each feature (e.g., PageRank, Betweenness Centrality) using the current graph structure. Features with *low* centrality scores and *low* weights are prioritized for pruning. The idea is that a feature weakly connected in the graph *and* with a low weight is less critical.
    *   **Addition:** When adding features, identify ‘bridge’ features – features that connect previously disconnected components of the graph. These bridge features are added to promote graph connectivity and potentially unlock new feature interactions. The selection of bridge features can be guided by maximizing a ‘connectivity metric’ (e.g., number of connected components).

4.  **Graph Update Mechanism:**
    *   After each learning iteration:
        *   Update edge weights based on the change in prediction accuracy when features interact. If removing a feature interaction increases loss, the edge weight increases.
        *   Implement a ‘structural refinement’ step – add/remove edges based on correlation exceeding a dynamic threshold (adjusts based on graph density).
        *   Regularization term to discourage overly dense graphs (e.g., L1 regularization on edge weights).

5.  **Pseudocode (Pruning Step):**

```
function prune_features(graph, feature_weights, threshold):
  for feature in graph.nodes():
    centrality = graph.calculate_centrality(feature)
    weight = feature_weights[feature]
    if centrality < threshold AND weight < threshold:
      remove_feature_from_graph(feature)
      remove_feature_from_weights(feature)
```

6. **Scalability Considerations:** Implement distributed graph processing using frameworks like DGL (Deep Graph Library) or PyTorch Geometric to handle large feature graphs efficiently.

7. **Integration with Existing System:** The Graph Embedding Layer and dynamic pruning/addition mechanism should be seamlessly integrated into the existing linear prediction model. The system should support incremental graph updates without requiring full retraining.



This approach allows the model to learn a more robust and adaptable feature representation, going beyond simple weight-based pruning and embracing the complex relationships between features. The dynamic graph structure can potentially uncover hidden feature interactions and improve prediction accuracy.
