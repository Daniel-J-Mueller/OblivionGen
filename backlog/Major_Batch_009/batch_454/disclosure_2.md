## Temporal Data Weaving with Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** Expand the dual-store system (commit log & batch-updated store) to incorporate a third layer: a *predictive prefetch cache*. This cache doesn't store *all* data, but anticipates frequently-accessed data *based on transaction sequences* and proactively loads it *before* a search even begins. This aims to drastically reduce search latency, particularly for time-series or sequential data access patterns.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Model:**

*   **Input:** Commit log transaction stream (record additions, deletions, updates).
*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cells.  LSTM is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies in transaction sequences.
*   **Training:** Continuously trained on the commit log data. The model learns to predict the probability of accessing specific records given the preceding N transactions.  N is a configurable parameter.
*   **Output:**  A ranked list of records predicted to be accessed in the near future, along with a confidence score.

**2. Prefetch Cache Structure:**

*   **Tiered Storage:**
    *   **L1 Cache:**  Small, fast in-memory cache for the highest-confidence predictions.
    *   **L2 Cache:**  Larger, slower SSD-based cache for medium-confidence predictions.
*   **Cache Invalidation:** Records are evicted based on Least Frequently Used (LFU) or Least Recently Used (LRU) policies, augmented with a time-to-live (TTL) based on the prediction confidence score.  Lower confidence = shorter TTL.
*   **Data Format:** Compressed columnar format optimized for read performance.

**3. Search Flow Modification:**

1.  **Receive Query:** Standard search request arrives.
2.  **Prefetch Trigger:** Before accessing either data store, the predictive model is consulted.
3.  **Data Prefetching:** The model provides a list of records.  These are prefetched into the tiered cache *before* the search begins.
4.  **Hybrid Search:** The search proceeds against:
    *   Prefetch Cache (highest priority).
    *   Commit Log (for recent transactions not yet in the cache).
    *   Batch-Updated Store (for historical data).
5.  **Model Feedback:**  Search results are fed back into the predictive model to refine its predictions.  Did the model accurately anticipate required data? Adjust weights accordingly.

**4.  Implementation Details:**

*   **Data Partitioning:** Partition data based on time or customer ID to improve prefetching accuracy and reduce cache contention.
*   **Asynchronous Prefetching:** Prefetching is performed asynchronously in a separate thread to avoid blocking search requests.
*   **Monitoring & Tuning:**  Monitor cache hit rate, prefetching latency, and model accuracy. Tune model parameters and cache sizes to optimize performance.
*   **API:** Extend the existing search API to include a "prefetch" flag that enables/disables prefetching.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Prefetching Logic):**

```
function prefetchData(query, model):
  predictedRecords = model.predictNextRecords(query) // Returns list of record IDs
  for recordID in predictedRecords:
    if recordID not in cache:
      fetchRecordFromStorage(recordID)
      storeRecordInCache(recordID)
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply caching frequently accessed data. It *predicts* access patterns based on transaction sequences, proactively loading data *before* a search begins. This offers a potentially significant performance improvement, particularly for time-series or sequential data access patterns.
