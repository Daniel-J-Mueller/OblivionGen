## Virtual Network ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the internal network scanning capability to create a dynamic, predictive system for resource allocation within and across virtual networks. Instead of just *detecting* resources, we proactively ‘shadow’ expected traffic patterns to pre-allocate and optimize resources *before* demand spikes.

**Specification:**

**1. Traffic Pattern Profiler (TPP):**
   *   **Input:** Historical network scan data, real-time traffic logs from virtual networks (collected via agents), application-level performance metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O).
   *   **Process:** Employs machine learning (time-series forecasting, anomaly detection) to identify recurring traffic patterns, predict future demand, and establish baseline resource utilization profiles for each virtual network and application. The TPP builds a ‘digital twin’ of expected network behavior.
   *   **Output:**  Resource demand forecasts (CPU, memory, bandwidth) per virtual network and application, confidence intervals for forecasts, and identified anomalies.

**2. Shadow Network Generator (SNG):**
   *   **Input:** Resource demand forecasts from TPP, virtual network configuration details (topology, security policies), and available computing resources.
   *   **Process:**  Creates a ‘shadow network’ – a temporary, lightweight replica of the target virtual network – within the provider’s infrastructure. This shadow network mirrors the topology and security rules of the target network.
   *   The SNG then *simulates* expected traffic flows based on the demand forecasts. This utilizes the same scanning packets as the original patent but extends their purpose beyond detection to active simulation. Scans are directed to 'shadow' destinations within the shadow network.
   *   **Output:** Performance metrics from the shadow network (latency, throughput, resource utilization), identified bottlenecks, and optimized resource allocation plans.

**3. Predictive Resource Allocator (PRA):**
   *   **Input:** Optimized resource allocation plans from SNG, current resource utilization across the provider’s infrastructure.
   *   **Process:**  Proactively allocates computing resources (VMs, containers, network bandwidth) to the target virtual network *before* demand peaks. This utilizes the provider’s orchestration tools (Kubernetes, OpenStack). It dynamically adjusts resource allocations based on real-time monitoring data.
   *   The PRA generates and injects specific control packets to influence network routing and QoS settings in preparation for anticipated traffic.
   *   **Output:**  Adjusted resource allocations, updated network configurations, and performance improvement metrics.

**Pseudocode (PRA):**

```
Function AllocateResources(Forecast, CurrentUtilization):
  // Forecast: Predicted resource demand (CPU, memory, bandwidth)
  // CurrentUtilization: Real-time resource utilization data

  RequiredResources = Forecast - CurrentUtilization

  If RequiredResources > 0:
    //Identify available resources
    AvailableResources = QueryResourcePool()

    //Allocate resources based on priority and availability
    AllocationPlan = OptimizeAllocation(AvailableResources, RequiredResources)

    //Deploy resources
    DeployResources(AllocationPlan)

    //Configure Network (QoS, Routing)
    ConfigureNetwork(AllocationPlan)
  End If
End Function

Function ConfigureNetwork(AllocationPlan):
  For Each Resource in AllocationPlan:
    SetQoS(Resource, AllocationPlan.QoS)
    ConfigureRouting(Resource, AllocationPlan.Routing)
  End For
End Function
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  TPP collects data and generates forecasts.
2.  SNG uses forecasts to create a shadow network and simulate traffic.
3.  PRA analyzes simulation results and proactively allocates resources.
4.  Real-time monitoring data feeds back into TPP for continuous optimization.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved application performance and user experience.
*   Reduced latency and increased throughput.
*   Optimized resource utilization and cost savings.
*   Proactive identification and mitigation of potential bottlenecks.
*   Enhanced security through proactive resource allocation.
