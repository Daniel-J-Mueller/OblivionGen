## Automated Predictive Cartoning & Stacking for Data Tapes

**System Overview:**

This system augments the robotic data storage library by incorporating predictive cartoning and automated stacking of data tapes *immediately* after retrieval or write completion. The goal is to optimize space utilization within the library and reduce robotic travel time for tape re-shelving.

**Core Components:**

*   **Predictive Analytics Module:** Software that analyzes historical data access patterns. It predicts which tapes are likely to be requested *next* based on job sequencing, application dependencies, and time-based access.
*   **Cartoning Station:** A small, integrated robotic arm and conveyance system located *adjacent* to the tape drives. It receives tapes directly from the drives.  It is capable of automatically inserting tapes into standardized, lightweight cardboard or plastic ‘cartons’ (think miniature shipping boxes).
*   **Automated Stacking System:** A vertically oriented system of conveyors and robotic arms positioned *adjacent* to the cartoning station. This system receives full cartons from the cartoning station and stacks them efficiently on pallets or directly on library shelving.  The stacking pattern is dynamically adjusted based on library space availability and predicted access frequency.
*   **Library Management System (LMS) Integration:**  The Predictive Analytics Module and Automated Stacking System are fully integrated with the existing LMS, receiving task requests and providing real-time status updates.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Tape Completion:** After a read or write operation, the tape drive signals the LMS.
2.  **Prediction & Carton Assignment:**  The LMS queries the Predictive Analytics Module. Based on the prediction, the LMS assigns a carton (either new or partially filled) to the tape.
3.  **Cartoning:** The cartoning station receives the tape from the drive and places it into the assigned carton.
4.  **Stacking:** Once a carton is full or reaches a pre-defined weight/size limit, the Automated Stacking System receives it and stacks it in the optimal location.
5.  **Request Handling:** When a tape is requested, the LMS identifies the carton containing the tape and directs a robotic picker to retrieve the entire carton.  The carton is then brought to the drive.  Once the request is complete, the process repeats.

**Pseudocode (LMS Integration - Simplified):**

```
// Function: HandleTapeCompletion(tapeID, driveID)
// Input: tapeID, driveID (ID of completed tape, drive it came from)

function HandleTapeCompletion(tapeID, driveID) {
  predicted_carton = PredictiveAnalytics.GetPredictedCarton(tapeID);
  if (predicted_carton.isFull()) {
    predicted_carton = CreateNewCarton();
  }
  CartoningStation.ReceiveTape(tapeID, driveID, predicted_carton);
  if (predicted_carton.isFull()) {
    AutomatedStackingSystem.StackCarton(predicted_carton);
  }
}

// Function: GetTapeForRequest(tapeID)
// Input: tapeID (ID of requested tape)

function GetTapeForRequest(tapeID) {
  carton = LocateCartonContainingTape(tapeID);
  if (carton != null) {
    BringCartonToDrive(carton);
    return carton;
  } else {
    // Error: Tape not found
    return null;
  }
}
```

**Specifications:**

*   **Carton Dimensions:** Standardized size (e.g., 6” x 6” x 4”) to maximize stacking efficiency.
*   **Carton Material:** Lightweight, recyclable cardboard or durable plastic.
*   **Stacking Height:** Maximum stacking height of 8 feet.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Integration with existing LMS via REST API.
*   **Redundancy:**  Dual redundant systems for critical components (e.g., cartoning station, stacking system).
*   **Sensors:** Utilize barcode readers and weight sensors for accurate carton tracking and inventory management.
