## Dynamic Event-Driven Multi-Perspective Synthesis

**Core Concept:** Leverage the real-time event detection from the patent to not just *recommend* streams, but dynamically synthesize new streams by combining elements from multiple sources, tailored to a user’s evolving interest in an event.

**Specification:**

**1. System Components:**

*   **Event Core:** (Existing from Patent) Real-time event detection module. Outputs event type, confidence score, and relevant media stream IDs.
*   **Perspective Engine:** Module responsible for identifying & extracting relevant segments from multiple media streams based on the detected event.
*   **Synthesis Engine:** Combines the extracted segments into a new, coherent stream.
*   **User Profile Manager:** Stores user preferences (preferred commentators, preferred camera angles, desired level of analysis, etc.).
*   **Adaptive Streaming Server:**  Delivers the synthesized stream to the user’s device.
*   **Metadata Enrichment Module:**  Augments the synthesized stream with dynamic graphics, stats, and contextual information.

**2. Data Flow:**

1.  **Event Detection:** Event Core detects an event in multiple streams (e.g., a goal in a soccer match).
2.  **Stream Identification:**  Event Core identifies the streams carrying the event, and passes event data.
3.  **Perspective Selection:** Perspective Engine, guided by User Profile Manager, selects segments from various streams:
    *   Primary broadcast feed.
    *   Alternate camera angles.
    *   Commentary feeds (different languages, different experts).
    *   Social media feeds (relevant tweets, fan reactions).
    *   Statistical overlays (real-time data).
4.  **Synthesis:** Synthesis Engine seamlessly combines selected segments:
    *   Prioritizes primary feed for core action.
    *   Switches to alternate angles for replays or unique perspectives.
    *   Integrates commentary from preferred sources.
    *   Overlays relevant stats and social media highlights.
5.  **Delivery:** Adaptive Streaming Server delivers the synthesized stream to the user, adjusting quality based on network conditions.
6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Based on user interaction (e.g., pausing, rewinding, selecting different commentators), the Synthesis Engine dynamically adjusts the stream composition.

**3. Pseudocode - Synthesis Engine:**

```pseudocode
function synthesizeStream(eventData, streamSegments, userPreferences):
  # streamSegments is a list of {streamID, startTimestamp, endTimestamp}
  # userPreferences contains preferred commentator, camera angle, etc.

  primaryStream = selectStream(streamSegments, "primaryBroadcast")
  commentatorStream = selectStream(streamSegments, "preferredCommentator", userPreferences)
  alternateAngleStream = selectStream(streamSegments, "preferredCameraAngle", userPreferences)

  finalStream = []
  currentTime = 0

  while currentTime < eventDuration:
    # Prioritize primary stream for core action
    primarySegment = getSegment(primaryStream, currentTime, segmentDuration)
    if primarySegment:
      finalStream.append(primarySegment)
      currentTime = primarySegment.endTime

    # Integrate commentary
    commentarySegment = getSegment(commentatorStream, currentTime, segmentDuration)
    if commentarySegment:
      # Overlay audio onto primary stream segment
      finalStream.append(commentarySegment)
      currentTime = commentarySegment.endTime

    # Insert alternate angles for replays
    if shouldInsertReplay(currentTime):
      replaySegment = getSegment(alternateAngleStream, currentTime - replayDuration, replayDuration)
      if replaySegment:
        finalStream.append(replaySegment)
        currentTime = replaySegment.endTime

  return finalStream
```

**4.  Novelty & Potential:**

This goes beyond simple stream recommendation by *creating* a unique viewing experience tailored to each user. It allows for personalized, dynamic content creation in real-time, significantly enhancing engagement.  Potential applications extend beyond sports to news, concerts, and any live event. The system learns user preferences over time, continuously refining the synthesis process. Further development could incorporate AI-driven summarization, automatic highlight generation, and interactive elements.
