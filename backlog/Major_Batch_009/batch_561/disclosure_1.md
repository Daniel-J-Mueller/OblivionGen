## Dynamic Index Shards & Federated Queries

**Concept:** Extend the indexing mechanism to support *sharding* of index nodes across a distributed system and introduce a query federation layer to seamlessly access these shards. This moves beyond a single graph database instance limitation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Index Shard Creation & Management:**

*   **Shard Key:** Introduce a `shard_key` parameter during index creation.  This key determines how indexed nodes are distributed across shards. Possible key types:  Hash of attribute value, range of attribute values, geographical location (if applicable to the data), or a custom function.
*   **Shard Assignment:**  A `Shard Manager` component is responsible for assigning nodes to the appropriate shard based on the `shard_key`.  This can be a centralized service or a distributed hash table (DHT).
*   **Shard Node Type:** Each shard is represented by a special `ShardNode` type.  A `ShardNode` contains:
    *   `shard_id`: Unique identifier for the shard.
    *   `shard_key_range`:  Defines the range of `shard_keys` this shard handles.
    *   `index_node`: The root index node for this shard, mirroring the structure in the original patent.
    *   `location`: Network address (URI) of the shard's storage/processing location.
*   **Dynamic Shard Splitting/Merging:**  Implement mechanisms to automatically split a shard if it exceeds a size/performance threshold, and to merge shards if they are underutilized.  This requires re-balancing indexed nodes and updating the `Shard Manager`.

**2. Federated Query Layer:**

*   **Query Planner:**  A `Query Planner` receives a query targeting an indexed attribute.  It performs the following steps:
    1.  **Shard Identification:** Determine which shards potentially contain nodes matching the query criteria based on the `shard_key` and query parameters.
    2.  **Query Decomposition:** Decompose the query into sub-queries, one for each relevant shard.  These sub-queries are tailored to the shardâ€™s local index.
    3.  **Parallel Execution:**  Submit the sub-queries to the corresponding shards for parallel execution.
    4.  **Result Aggregation:**  Collect the results from all shards and merge them into a single result set.
*   **Query Routing:** The `Query Planner` utilizes a `Shard Routing Table` to map shard IDs to network locations. This table is maintained by the `Shard Manager`.
*   **Result Serialization:** Define a standardized format for serializing query results between shards and the `Query Planner`.  Protocol Buffers or Apache Arrow are suitable choices.

**3. Transactional Consistency (Optional, but desirable):**

*   **Distributed Transactions:**  Implement support for distributed transactions (e.g., using two-phase commit) to ensure consistency across shards when updating indexed nodes. This adds complexity but is crucial for applications requiring strong consistency.

**Pseudocode (Query Planner):**

```pseudocode
function execute_indexed_query(query, attribute):
  shard_list = determine_relevant_shards(query, attribute)
  subqueries = decompose_query(query, shard_list)
  results = []
  for shard in shard_list:
    result = send_query(shard, subqueries[shard])
    results.append(result)
  merged_result = merge_results(results)
  return merged_result

function determine_relevant_shards(query, attribute):
  // Use shard key and query attributes to determine shards
  // Consult shard routing table
  return list_of_shard_ids

function send_query(shard_id, subquery):
  // Send subquery to shard via network connection
  return result_set

function merge_results(result_sets):
  // Combine result sets into a single result
  return combined_result_set
```

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Massively large graph databases that exceed the capacity of a single machine.
*   Geographically distributed graph databases.
*   Federated graph queries across multiple data sources.
