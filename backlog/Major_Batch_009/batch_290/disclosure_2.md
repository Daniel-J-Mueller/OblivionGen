## Automated Data Store ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Migration

**Concept:** Extend the multi-target conversion capability to include *dynamic* mirroring of data stores with predictive schema adaptation, enabling zero-downtime migrations and continuous ‘what-if’ analysis.

**Specification:**

**I. Core Functionality – Shadow Store Creation:**

1.  **Trigger:** Initiate a ‘shadow’ creation based on selected source(s) and target(s). This differs from traditional migration by *not* immediately cutting over. The source remains the primary data store.
2.  **Metadata Extraction & Schema Mapping:** Utilize the existing metadata collection process. However, introduce a ‘schema drift’ monitoring component. This component tracks schema changes in the source data store *in real-time*.
3.  **Incremental Data Replication:** Establish a continuous, incremental replication pipeline from the source to the shadow target.  This uses Change Data Capture (CDC) to minimize latency and resource usage.
4.  **Schema Adaptation Engine:**  The core innovation. This engine *predicts* how schema changes in the source will impact the shadow target. It employs a rules-based system, augmented by machine learning (trained on historical schema evolution data) to:
    *   Identify potential conflicts (e.g., incompatible data types, missing columns).
    *   Suggest automated schema adaptations (e.g., data type conversions, default value assignments, column additions).
    *   Present proposed adaptations to a human operator for approval or modification.  A confidence score is assigned to each adaptation suggestion, indicating its reliability.
5.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** If a new column is added to the source, and the target lacks a corresponding column, the engine generates *synthetic* data for that column in the target, based on existing data patterns and configurable rules. This prevents data loss and maintains data integrity.

**II. Predictive Migration & Zero Downtime:**

1.  **Performance Profiling:** Continuously monitor the performance of both the source and shadow data stores. This includes query latency, throughput, and resource utilization.
2.  **Simulated Cutover:** Allow operators to initiate a ‘simulated cutover’ – a dry run of the migration process. This involves redirecting a small percentage of read traffic to the shadow store and monitoring its performance.
3.  **Dynamic Traffic Shifting:** Based on performance profiling and simulated cutovers, the system automatically shifts traffic from the source to the shadow store in a phased manner.  This minimizes disruption to end-users.
4.  **Rollback Mechanism:** If any issues are detected during the traffic shift, the system automatically rolls back to the source data store.
5.  **Post-Migration Validation:** After the migration is complete, the system performs a comprehensive data validation check to ensure data consistency and integrity.

**III. Pseudocode (Schema Adaptation Engine - Simplified):**

```
FUNCTION AdaptSchema(SourceSchema, TargetSchema, SchemaChange)

  IF SchemaChange.Type == "COLUMN_ADDED" THEN
    IF SchemaChange.Column NOT IN TargetSchema THEN
      DataType = SchemaChange.DataType
      DefaultValue = DetermineDefaultValue(DataType) //Based on data type and configurable rules
      AddColumnToTargetSchema(TargetSchema, SchemaChange.Column, DataType, DefaultValue)
      GenerateSyntheticData(TargetSchema, SchemaChange.Column)
    ENDIF
  ELSE IF SchemaChange.Type == "DATA_TYPE_CHANGED" THEN
    IF SourceSchema[SchemaChange.Column].DataType != TargetSchema[SchemaChange.Column].DataType THEN
      ConversionPossible = CheckDataTypeConversion(SourceSchema[SchemaChange.Column].DataType, TargetSchema[SchemaChange.Column].DataType)
      IF ConversionPossible THEN
        SuggestDataTypeConversion(TargetSchema, SchemaChange.Column)
      ELSE
        ReportSchemaConflict(SchemaChange)
      ENDIF
    ENDIF
  ENDIF

  RETURN TargetSchema
```

**IV. System Components:**

1.  **CDC Agent:** Captures changes in the source data store.
2.  **Metadata Repository:** Stores metadata about both the source and target data stores.
3.  **Schema Adaptation Engine:**  Applies schema adaptations based on detected changes.
4.  **Traffic Manager:**  Redirects traffic between the source and target data stores.
5.  **Monitoring & Alerting System:** Monitors system performance and alerts operators to any issues.
