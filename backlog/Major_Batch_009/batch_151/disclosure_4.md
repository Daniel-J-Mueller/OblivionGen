## Adaptive Workflow Sharding with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the workflow evaluation service to support dynamic workflow *sharding* â€“ breaking down a single workflow definition into smaller, independently executable sub-workflows. This, coupled with a predictive resource allocation system, drastically improves scalability and responsiveness, particularly for long-running or complex workflows.

**Specifications:**

**1. Workflow Definition Extension:**

*   **Sharding Annotations:** Introduce annotations within workflow definitions to designate natural breaking points for sharding. These annotations define criteria for splitting a workflow (e.g., specific task completion, data size thresholds, time elapsed).
*   **Sub-Workflow Definitions:** Allow workflow definitions to reference reusable sub-workflow definitions. These sub-workflows represent independent units of execution.
*   **Data Dependency Mapping:** The workflow definition must include explicit mapping of data dependencies *between* sub-workflows. This allows the system to orchestrate data transfer and synchronization.

**2. Sharding Engine:**

*   **Dynamic Shard Creation:** Upon workflow initiation, a Sharding Engine analyzes the workflow definition and creates a dynamic dependency graph representing the sub-workflows and their data dependencies.
*   **Shard Prioritization:** Based on dependency analysis and resource availability, the Sharding Engine prioritizes sub-workflow execution.
*   **Data Orchestration:** The Sharding Engine manages data transfer between sub-workflows, ensuring data consistency and availability. This could involve techniques like message queues, shared memory, or distributed caching.

**3. Predictive Resource Allocation:**

*   **Historical Data Collection:** Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, network) for each sub-workflow type. Store this data in a time-series database.
*   **Machine Learning Model:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA) to predict resource requirements for each sub-workflow type, based on historical data and input parameters.
*   **Resource Provisioning:** When a sub-workflow is scheduled, the predictive model estimates resource requirements and provisions resources accordingly. This can be integrated with a container orchestration system (e.g., Kubernetes) to dynamically scale resources.
*   **Adaptive Scaling:** Continuously monitor resource usage and adjust resource allocation in real-time, based on actual performance.

**4. Workflow Evaluation Service Integration:**

*   **Shard Assignment:** The Workflow Evaluation Service receives requests for workflow decisions, determines the appropriate sub-workflow to execute, and assigns it to a dedicated evaluation thread.
*   **Context Propagation:** The Workflow Evaluation Service propagates relevant context (e.g., workflow ID, input data, user credentials) to the evaluation thread.
*   **Result Aggregation:**  Upon completion of a sub-workflow, the evaluation thread sends the results to the Workflow Handling Service, which aggregates the results and progresses the overall workflow.

**Pseudocode (Sharding Engine - `create_shards()`):**

```pseudocode
function create_shards(workflow_definition):
  dependency_graph = build_dependency_graph(workflow_definition)
  shards = []
  queue = [root_task]

  while queue:
    task = queue.pop(0)
    shard = create_shard(task, dependency_graph)
    shards.append(shard)

    for dependent_task in get_dependent_tasks(task, dependency_graph):
      queue.append(dependent_task)
  
  return shards
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shard:** {`task_id`, `dependencies`, `input_data`, `output_data`, `resource_requirements`}
*   **Dependency Graph:** A directed graph representing task dependencies.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Scalability:** Distribute workload across multiple resources.
*   **Reduced Latency:** Execute sub-workflows in parallel.
*   **Enhanced Resilience:** Isolate failures to individual sub-workflows.
*   **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Allocate resources dynamically based on predicted needs.
*   **Complex Workflow Management:** Handle highly complex workflows with many tasks and dependencies.
