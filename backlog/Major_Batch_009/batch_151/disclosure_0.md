## Dynamic Power Allocation via Predictive Component Usage

**Concept:** Expand beyond simply *displaying* remaining power to proactively *allocating* power based on predicted component usage, shifting from reactive power management to predictive power management. This builds on the voltage/current/resistance calculation, but adds a layer of machine learning to anticipate demand.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensors:**  Maintain existing battery voltage (VBATT MEASURED), current draw (Icompensated), and series resistance (Rseries) sensing.  *Add* individual component current sensors – ideally, non-invasive current sensors for key components (CPU, GPU, Display, Wireless Modules, etc.).
*   **Sampling Rate:**  All sensors sample at a minimum of 10Hz. Component-level current sensors should ideally sample at 50Hz to capture finer-grained usage patterns.
*   **Data Storage:**  A rolling buffer to store sensor data for the last 24 hours. This buffer is accessible by the Predictive Modeling Module.

**2. Predictive Modeling Module:**

*   **Machine Learning Algorithm:**  Employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network.  LSTMs excel at time series prediction.
*   **Training Data:** Train the LSTM on the rolling sensor data buffer. The training objective is to predict the *next* 5 minutes of component-level current draw.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Input features to the LSTM include:
    *   Time of day
    *   Day of week
    *   VBATT MEASURED, Icompensated, Rseries (global power metrics)
    *   Current draw for each individual component (historical and current)
    *   Application/process currently running (obtained via OS API)
*   **Prediction Horizon:** 5 minutes. The model predicts component current draw for the next 5 minutes in 1-second intervals.

**3. Dynamic Power Allocation Module:**

*   **Power Budget:**  Based on VBATT REAL (calculated as per the original patent), define a total power budget for the device.
*   **Allocation Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive predicted component current draw from the Predictive Modeling Module.
    2.  Calculate the *total* predicted power draw.
    3.  If the predicted power draw exceeds the power budget:
        *   Identify components with the *lowest predicted utilization* over the prediction horizon.
        *   Reduce power to those components via:
            *   CPU/GPU clock throttling.
            *   Display brightness reduction.
            *   Disabling unused wireless modules.
            *   Putting components into low-power states (e.g., sleep).
        *   Prioritize disabling/throttling components that have minimal impact on the currently running application (determined via OS API).
    4.  Continuously monitor actual current draw and adjust power allocation in real-time.

**4. User Interface Integration:**

*   Display a "Predictive Battery Life" estimate based on the model's predictions.
*   Provide a user-adjustable "Power Saving Mode" that influences the aggressiveness of the power allocation algorithm (e.g., "Balanced," "Aggressive," "Maximum").

**Pseudocode (DynamicPowerAllocationModule):**

```
function allocatePower():
  predictedPowerDraw = PredictiveModelingModule.getPredictedPowerDraw()
  powerBudget = calculatePowerBudget()

  if predictedPowerDraw > powerBudget:
    componentsToReduce = findLowUtilizationComponents(predictedPowerDraw)
    for component in componentsToReduce:
      reducePowerToComponent(component)

  monitorCurrentDraw()
  adjustAllocationBasedOnRealTimeData()
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive Learning:** The LSTM should continuously re-train on new data to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection to identify unexpected power consumption patterns, which may indicate a malfunctioning component.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Explore the use of dedicated hardware (e.g., a Neural Processing Unit) to accelerate the LSTM inference.
