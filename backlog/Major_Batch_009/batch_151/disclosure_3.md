## Dynamic Skill Chaining & Predictive Content Generation

**Concept:** Expand beyond parallel skill output to a system that *chains* skills based on user interaction and *predicts* subsequent supplemental content needs before the user explicitly requests it.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Architecture – Skill Graph:**

*   **Data Structure:** Implement a directed graph where nodes represent individual skills (as defined in the patent) and edges represent potential transitions between skills based on inferred user intent and context.  Edge weights represent transition probabilities, learned via ML.
*   **Intent Mapping:** Augment NLU with a ‘skill affinity’ layer. This layer assigns probabilities to various skills based on the parsed intent *and* historical user interaction data.
*   **Contextual Data:**  Include persistent user profiles containing interaction history, preferred skills, and device characteristics.

**2. Predictive Content Pipeline:**

*   **Content Prediction Model:**  Train an ML model (e.g., a Recurrent Neural Network with attention) to predict the likelihood of needing supplemental content *from specific skills* following an initial skill response. This model uses:
    *   Current user input
    *   Activated skill
    *   User profile data
    *   Skill graph edge weights
*   **Pre-Fetching & Caching:** Based on the prediction model’s output, proactively fetch and cache potential supplemental content *before* the user requests it. This minimizes latency.
*   **Content Prioritization:** Rank pre-fetched content based on prediction confidence and user preferences.

**3. Dynamic Skill Orchestration:**

*   **Skill Chain Trigger:** If the content prediction model identifies a high probability of needing supplemental content from a different skill, initiate a skill chain.
*   **Chain Definition:** The skill graph dictates the chain – the system dynamically selects the next skill in the chain based on learned transitions.
*   **Seamless Transition:**  Present the supplemental content as a natural continuation of the initial response.

**4.  Content Blending & Presentation:**

*   **Adaptive Layout:** Implement a dynamic layout engine that seamlessly blends content from multiple skills into a single, coherent presentation.
*   **Visual Cueing:** Use subtle visual cues (e.g., animations, transitions) to indicate the source and relationship of different content elements.
*   **User Control:** Allow users to explicitly control the skill chain – pause, skip, or modify the sequence.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// User Input Received
input = getUserInput();
intent = getNLUOutput(input);
skillAffinity = getSkillAffinity(intent, userProfile); // Returns probabilities for each skill
primarySkill = selectSkill(skillAffinity);
primaryResponse = primarySkill.generateResponse(input);

// Content Prediction
predictedSkills = predictSupplementalSkills(primarySkill, input, userProfile);
predictedContent = preFetchContent(predictedSkills);

// Skill Chaining (if applicable)
if (predictedSkills.length > 0) {
    chain = buildSkillChain(predictedSkills, userProfile);
    chainResponses = chain.generateResponses(input);
    combinedContent = combineContent(primaryResponse, chainResponses);
} else {
    combinedContent = primaryResponse;
}

// Present to User
presentContent(combinedContent);
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Emotion Detection:** Integrate emotion detection to tailor skill selection and content presentation based on the user’s emotional state.
*   **Proactive Assistance:**  Based on user behavior, proactively suggest relevant skills or content before the user explicitly requests it.
*   **Multi-Modal Interaction:**  Support a wider range of input modalities (e.g., voice, gesture, eye tracking) to enhance the user experience.
