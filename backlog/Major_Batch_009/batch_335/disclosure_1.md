## Adaptive Attribute Weighting for Dynamic Sub-Clustering

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on static attribute analysis within clusters. This expands on that by introducing *dynamic* attribute weighting during the sub-clustering process, enabling the system to prioritize attributes based on real-time cluster characteristics and evolving data patterns. It creates a self-tuning sub-clustering mechanism.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Input & Initial Cluster Definition:**

*   **Input:** A cluster of entity records, each with a defined set of attributes (text, image, numerical, etc.).
*   **Initial Clustering:** Assume initial clustering has already been performed as per the prior art. This system operates on *existing* clusters.

**2. Attribute Importance Score Calculation:**

*   **Entropy Metric:** Calculate the entropy of each attribute *within* the cluster. Higher entropy suggests greater diversity and potentially greater discriminatory power.
*   **Variance Metric:** Calculate the variance of numerical attributes.  Higher variance suggests greater spread and potentially greater discriminatory power.
*   **Gradient Calculation (Text Attributes):**  For text attributes, calculate the gradient of term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) vectors. High gradient magnitudes indicate rapidly changing information content.
*   **Combined Score:**  Calculate an "Attribute Importance Score" (AIS) for each attribute using a weighted combination of entropy, variance, and gradient.  Weights are adjustable parameters.

    ```
    AIS(attribute) = w1 * Entropy(attribute) + w2 * Variance(attribute) + w3 * Gradient(attribute)
    ```

**3. Dynamic Weighting & Sub-Clustering:**

*   **Normalization:** Normalize the AIS for all attributes to create a probability distribution.
*   **Weighted Similarity:**  When calculating similarity between entity records for sub-clustering, multiply the similarity contribution of each attribute by its normalized AIS.  This emphasizes attributes that are currently most informative.

    ```
    Similarity(record1, record2) = Î£ [AIS(attribute) * attribute_similarity(record1, record2, attribute)]
    ```

*   **Sub-clustering Algorithm:** Utilize any suitable sub-clustering algorithm (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) *incorporating the weighted similarity metric*.

**4. Iterative Refinement:**

*   **Sub-cluster Evaluation:** Evaluate the quality of the sub-clusters (e.g., using Silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index).
*   **Weight Adjustment:** Adjust the weights (w1, w2, w3) in the AIS calculation based on the sub-cluster evaluation metrics. Use a gradient ascent/descent optimization algorithm.
*   **Iteration:** Repeat steps 3 and 4 for a predetermined number of iterations, or until convergence is reached.

**5. Output:**

*   A set of sub-clusters, dynamically created based on attribute importance.
*   Optimized attribute weights for future sub-clustering tasks.

**Hardware/Software Considerations:**

*   GPU acceleration for entropy, variance, and gradient calculations.
*   Distributed computing framework (e.g., Spark) for large datasets.
*   Python-based implementation with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and scikit-learn.
*   REST API for integration with existing systems.
*   Storage for attribute weights and sub-cluster results.
