## Dynamic Snapshot Composition & Permissioning

**Concept:** Extend snapshot functionality to allow *composition* of snapshots from multiple source volumes, dynamically adjusting permissions based on contributing accounts *at the time of export*. This creates a system where a user can request a combined snapshot reflecting data from various sources, but access is governed not just by their overall permissions, but by the permissions of the *originating* data within that composite snapshot.

**Specification:**

**1. Composite Snapshot Creation Service:**

*   **Input:** Request specifying source volumes (potentially owned by different accounts), desired snapshot consistency (e.g., point-in-time), and export destination.
*   **Process:**
    *   Service orchestrates snapshot creation from specified source volumes.
    *   Each data block within the composite snapshot is tagged with metadata identifying the originating volume *and* the originating account.
    *   A new composite snapshot manifest is generated, mapping data blocks to origin volume/account pairs.  This manifest differs from existing ones: It is *dynamic* during export (see section 3).
*   **Output:** A composite snapshot stored as a collection of data blocks with associated metadata, and a preliminary composite snapshot manifest.

**2. Data Block Metadata:**

*   Each data block must contain:
    *   Block ID
    *   Origin Volume ID
    *   Origin Account ID
    *   Creation Timestamp
    *   Checksum

**3. Dynamic Permissioning Engine (DPE):**

*   **Trigger:**  Request to export (or list) a composite snapshot.
*   **Process:**
    *   Receives export request and composite snapshot manifest.
    *   For *each* data block in the snapshot:
        *   DPE queries the origin account’s permission settings.
        *   Checks if the requesting user has export rights for data originating from that specific account.
        *   Modifies the composite snapshot manifest *in memory*.  Blocks for which the user lacks permission are flagged as inaccessible.
    *   The DPE generates an *export manifest* – a filtered version of the composite manifest reflecting the user’s permitted access.
*   **Output:** Export manifest.

**4. Export Service:**

*   Receives export request and export manifest.
*   Exports *only* data blocks identified as accessible in the export manifest.
*   Checksum verification on exported data to ensure integrity.

**Pseudocode (DPE Core):**

```
function generate_export_manifest(composite_manifest, requesting_user):
  export_manifest = {}
  for block_id, metadata in composite_manifest.items():
    origin_account = metadata.origin_account
    if has_export_rights(requesting_user, origin_account, block_id):
      export_manifest[block_id] = metadata
    else:
      // Log blocked access attempt
      log_access_denied(requesting_user, origin_account, block_id)
  return export_manifest

function has_export_rights(user, account, block_id):
  // Query permissions service for user's rights on account
  rights = permissions_service.get_user_rights(user, account)
  if rights.can_export:
    return True
  else:
    return False
```

**Considerations:**

*   **Performance:** Dynamic permissioning will add latency. Caching is crucial. Cache export manifests per user/snapshot pair.
*   **Scalability:** Distributed permissioning service to handle large numbers of users and accounts.
*   **Auditing:**  Comprehensive logging of access attempts and blocked data.
*   **Granularity:**  Permissioning can be extended to individual files or directories within the snapshot.
