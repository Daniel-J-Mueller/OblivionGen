**Dynamic Lenticular Projection Mapping**

**Concept:** Expand the lenticular image capture and display concept into a real-time, dynamic projection mapping system. Instead of capturing still images for a lenticular display, use the principles to create a projection system that adapts the projected image based on the viewer's position *in real time*. This moves beyond simple parallax effects and allows for true volumetric-feeling visuals without requiring special glasses.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution depth camera (e.g., LiDAR or structured light) to accurately map the viewer’s position and orientation in 3D space.
    *   High-speed, wide-angle camera array to capture the viewer’s field of view for gaze tracking and subtle adjustment of projected content.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) integrated into the projection unit to compensate for its own movement and maintain accurate tracking.
*   **Projection System:**
    *   Multiple high-brightness, high-resolution projectors (minimum 4, optimally 8+) arranged in a circular or polygonal configuration. Projectors need to support edge blending.
    *   Fast, programmable warping and blending engine to dynamically adjust the projected image for each projector based on viewer position. 
    *   Low-latency image processing pipeline to minimize delay between viewer movement and projected image update. Target latency < 10ms.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Tracking Module:** Processes data from the depth camera, camera array, and IMU to determine viewer position, orientation, and gaze direction. Kalman filtering or similar techniques to smooth tracking data.
    *   **Rendering Engine:** Responsible for generating multiple views of the 3D scene or content based on the viewer’s position. Utilize a view frustum culling and level of detail (LOD) system for performance optimization.  Support for real-time shaders and effects.
    *   **Warping & Blending Module:** Maps the rendered views onto the projection surface, warping and blending them to create a seamless image.  Use a mesh warping algorithm based on the projection surface geometry.
    *   **Communication Interface:** High-speed data communication link (e.g., Ethernet, Fiber Optic) between the sensor suite, processing unit, and projection system.
*   **Calibration Procedure:**
    *   Automated calibration routine to map the projection surface geometry, projector positions, and sensor locations.
    *   Calibration targets placed within the projection space for accurate alignment.
    *   User interface for fine-tuning calibration parameters.
*   **Pseudocode – Real-time View Generation:**

```
loop:
  // 1. Acquire sensor data
  sensor_data = get_sensor_data()

  // 2. Calculate viewer position & orientation
  viewer_pose = calculate_viewer_pose(sensor_data)

  // 3. Render multiple views based on viewer pose
  views = render_views(scene, viewer_pose, num_projectors)

  // 4. Warp and blend views for each projector
  projected_images = warp_and_blend(views, projector_positions, projector_calibration)

  // 5. Send projected images to projectors
  send_to_projectors(projected_images)

  // Repeat
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Interactive art installations
*   Immersive gaming experiences
*   Holographic telepresence
