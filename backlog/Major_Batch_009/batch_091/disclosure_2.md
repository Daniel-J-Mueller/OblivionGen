## Dynamic UI ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Error Detection & Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the semantic block comparison beyond *detecting* discrepancies to *predicting* likely future discrepancies before the user even encounters them. Create a “shadow” UI that renders a predictive model of how the UI *should* behave, based on historical data and learned patterns.

**Specs:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Model Training:**

*   **Historical UI State Capture:**  Implement a system to log the complete UI state (DOM, CSS, data payloads) at regular intervals for a statistically significant user base. This data includes successful interactions *and* those leading to discrepancies.
*   **Anomaly Detection Model:** Train a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, to predict the next UI state given the current state and user action. The LSTM will learn temporal dependencies and predict expected values for semantic blocks. This model forms the core of the “shadow UI”.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Include features beyond DOM structure and data values. Incorporate user profile data (demographics, purchase history, session length) as contextual input to improve prediction accuracy.

**2. Shadow UI Implementation:**

*   **Parallel Rendering:**  Create a separate, off-screen rendering process (the “shadow UI”). This process mirrors the live UI’s rendering pipeline, but operates on predicted states.
*   **Asynchronous Prediction:** After each user action in the live UI, send the action and current UI state to the prediction model. The model returns a predicted next UI state.
*   **Real-Time Comparison:**  The shadow UI renders the predicted state. A dedicated comparison module then compares the rendered shadow UI with the *actual* rendered live UI, focusing on semantic blocks.

**3. Predictive Discrepancy Detection & Resolution:**

*   **Threshold-Based Alerting:** Define a tolerance threshold for differences between predicted and actual values within semantic blocks.  If the difference exceeds the threshold, a “predictive discrepancy” is flagged *before* the user visually notices it.
*   **Automated Resolution (Tiered Approach):**
    *   **Tier 1: Data Correction:** If the discrepancy is solely a data value mismatch, attempt automated data correction by querying backend services for the correct value.
    *   **Tier 2: UI Patch Application:** If the discrepancy involves a minor UI element rendering issue, apply a pre-defined UI patch (e.g., CSS override) to the live UI.
    *   **Tier 3: Backend Issue Reporting:** If the discrepancy is complex or requires code changes, automatically generate a detailed bug report including the predicted state, actual state, and a confidence score for the prediction.
*   **Confidence Scoring:** Attach a confidence score to each prediction.  Lower confidence scores trigger more aggressive alerting and reporting.

**4. System Architecture:**

```
[User Interaction] -> [Live UI]
                      ^
                      | User Action & Current State
                      v
[Prediction Model] -> [Predicted UI State]
                      ^
                      | Comparison
                      v
[Discrepancy Detection & Resolution Module] -> [Live UI (patched/corrected)]
                                                -> [Backend Bug Report]
```

**Pseudocode (Discrepancy Detection):**

```
function detectDiscrepancy(predictedDOM, actualDOM):
  discrepancyScore = 0
  for each semanticBlock in semanticBlockList:
    predictedValue = getValueFromDOM(predictedDOM, semanticBlock)
    actualValue = getValueFromDOM(actualDOM, semanticBlock)
    difference = abs(predictedValue - actualValue)
    discrepancyScore += difference * weightForSemanticBlock(semanticBlock)

  if discrepancyScore > threshold:
    return True, discrepancyScore
  else:
    return False, discrepancyScore
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond reactive error detection to *proactive* prediction and potentially automated resolution. The use of an LSTM to model UI state transitions and a dynamically weighted discrepancy score provides a more nuanced and accurate assessment of UI health. The tiered resolution approach allows for varying levels of automated intervention, minimizing user disruption.
