## Dynamic PCI Address Space Partitioning & Migration

**Concept:** Implement a system where PCI address spaces aren't statically assigned at boot, but are dynamically partitioned and migrated between PCI switches based on workload demands and resource availability. This moves beyond simple peer-to-peer communication and allows for a fluid, reconfigurable PCI fabric.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   PCI Switches: Modified to support dynamic address space assignment and migration. Includes hardware acceleration for address translation and remapping.
    *   Address Space Manager (ASM): A dedicated hardware module (FPGA or ASIC) responsible for tracking available address space, allocating partitions, and coordinating migrations.  Connects to all PCI switches in the system.
    *   Root Complex Extension: Modified root complex to interface with the ASM and receive updated address maps.
*   **Software:**
    *   Address Space Management API: A driver interface allowing applications or a hypervisor to request address space partitions and initiate migrations.
    *   Workload Profiler: Software component to monitor application resource usage and predict future address space needs.
    *   Migration Coordinator: Software component that interacts with the ASM and workload profiler to orchestrate address space migrations.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initial Boot:**  The ASM initializes a global address space map.  PCI switches are allocated a base address space range.
2.  **Workload Profiling:** The workload profiler monitors application resource usage and predicts future address space requirements.
3.  **Address Space Request:**  An application (or hypervisor) requests an address space partition via the Address Space Management API, specifying the required size and performance characteristics.
4.  **ASM Allocation:**  The ASM determines the optimal PCI switch to allocate the partition based on available address space, bandwidth, and latency.
5.  **Address Remapping:**  The ASM programs the PCI switches with new address mappings, re-routing traffic to the allocated partition.  This utilizes a fast address translation table within each switch.
6.  **Dynamic Migration:** If a workload moves or requires more resources, the ASM can dynamically migrate the associated address space partition to a different PCI switch. This process is transparent to the application.
7.  **Address Space Reclamation:** When a workload terminates, the ASM reclaims the associated address space partition and adds it back to the available pool.

**Pseudocode (Migration Coordinator):**

```
function MigrateAddressSpace(workloadID, newSwitchID):
    // 1. Lock access to the workload's address space
    LockAddressSpace(workloadID)

    // 2. Identify all devices mapped to the workload's address space
    deviceList = GetDevicesInAddressSpace(workloadID)

    // 3. Build a new address map for the new switch
    newAddressMap = CreateAddressMap(deviceList, newSwitchID)

    // 4. Communicate the new address map to all relevant PCI switches.
    //    This includes updating address translation tables and routing tables.
    BroadcastAddressMap(newAddressMap)

    // 5. Flush any cached data associated with the old address space.
    FlushCaches(workloadID)

    // 6. Update the workload's address space association.
    AssociateWorkloadWithSwitch(workloadID, newSwitchID)

    // 7. Unlock access to the workload's address space
    UnlockAddressSpace(workloadID)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Increased Resource Utilization:** Dynamically allocate address space to workloads based on demand.
*   **Improved Performance:** Migrate workloads to PCI switches with available bandwidth and low latency.
*   **Enhanced Scalability:** Easily add or remove PCI devices without requiring system downtime.
*   **Flexibility:** Support a wide range of workloads and configurations.
*   **Virtualization Support:** Optimized for virtualized environments.
