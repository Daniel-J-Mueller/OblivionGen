## HSM-Integrated Attestation & Dynamic Root of Trust

**Concept:** Leverage the HSM's secure key storage and cryptographic capabilities to create a dynamic, hardware-rooted trust anchor for software components *outside* the HSM itself, facilitating remote attestation and continuous integrity validation.

**Motivation:**  The patent focuses on key synchronization *within* an HSM cluster. This expands that trust outwards, verifying the software environment accessing the HSM, essentially creating a 'sealed' software stack.  If the software stack is compromised, the HSM *refuses* operations.

**Specs:**

1.  **Attestation Key Pair:** Each HSM generates a unique attestation key pair (public/private). The public key is provisioned to a central Attestation Server.
2.  **Measured Boot Extension:** The HSM is integrated into the system's boot process. Before the OS loads, a hash of the initial bootloader, kernel, and critical system components is calculated.  This hash is signed by the HSM's attestation private key.
3.  **Runtime Measurement & Attestation:**  
    *   Critical software components (e.g., application servers, database drivers) register with the HSM.
    *   Before executing sensitive operations, these components calculate a hash of their code, configuration, and runtime state.
    *   This hash is presented to the HSM for signing using the attestation private key.
    *   The signed hash (attestation evidence) is sent to the Attestation Server.
4.  **Attestation Server:**
    *   Verifies the HSM signature using the pre-provisioned HSM public key.
    *   Maintains a 'policy database' that defines the expected hashes for each component version.
    *   Compares the received hash with the policy database.
    *   If the hash matches, the Attestation Server issues a 'trust token' to the requesting component.
5.  **HSM Enforcement:**
    *   Before the HSM processes any request, the HSM verifies the presence of a valid trust token. 
    *   If the trust token is absent or invalid, the HSM *rejects* the operation.

**Pseudocode (HSM Component):**

```
function processRequest(requestData):
    trustToken = requestData.trustToken

    if trustToken == null or verifyTrustToken(trustToken) == false:
        log("Invalid trust token. Operation rejected.")
        return ERROR_INVALID_TOKEN

    // Proceed with cryptographic operation
    result = performCryptoOperation(requestData)
    return result
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Secure storage for the attestation key pair.
*   A mechanism for measuring boot components during the boot process (e.g., a dedicated measurement module).
*   Hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations (signing, verification).

**Security Benefits:**

*   Hardware-rooted trust.
*   Continuous integrity validation.
*   Protection against software-based attacks.
*   Remote attestation capabilities.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Secure cloud computing.
*   IoT device security.
*   Secure software supply chain.
*   Zero-trust architectures.
