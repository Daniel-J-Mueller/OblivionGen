## Adaptive Coefficient Granularity

**Concept:** Expand the optimization beyond simply transmitting a reduced matrix. Introduce adaptive granularity in coefficient representation *within* the residual coefficient matrix itself, based on perceptual importance. This moves beyond spatial sparsification to frequency/perceptual sparsification.

**Specs:**

1.  **Perceptual Mask Generation:**
    *   Implement a pre-processing stage that generates a perceptual mask based on the content. This mask highlights regions/frequencies more sensitive to distortion. Considerations: Luminance masking, motion masking, texture complexity. Output is a matrix matching the dimensions of the parent transform block.

2.  **Coefficient Classification:**
    *   Divide residual coefficients into categories:
        *   *Significant*:  Coefficients above a threshold *and* within perceptually important regions (high mask value).  Transmit full precision.
        *   *Moderate*: Coefficients above a threshold *but* in less perceptually important regions.  Reduce precision (e.g., 8-bit instead of 16-bit).
        *   *Negligible*: Coefficients below a threshold.  Represent with a single bit or compact encoding.

3.  **Adaptive Encoding:**
    *   Include metadata indicating the classification scheme used for each block/macroblock.
    *   Employ variable-length coding (e.g., Huffman, CABAC) to efficiently encode coefficients based on their category.
    *   Design a compact representation for ‘Negligible’ coefficients. A single bit indicating presence/absence, or a run-length encoding for consecutive zeros.

4.  **Inverse Transform Adaptation:**
    *   Decoder utilizes metadata to determine the precision and encoding scheme for each coefficient.
    *   Implement separate inverse transform paths based on precision. Reduced precision coefficients require scaling/quantization adjustments.
    *   Adaptive scaling/quantization is performed *before* the inverse transform to mitigate precision loss.

**Pseudocode (Decoder):**

```
function decode_block(residual_data, metadata):
  classification_scheme = metadata.classification_scheme
  block_size = metadata.block_size

  significant_coefficients = []
  moderate_coefficients = []
  negligible_coefficients = []

  for coefficient in residual_data:
    if coefficient.importance == "significant":
      significant_coefficients.append(coefficient.value)
    else if coefficient.importance == "moderate":
      moderate_coefficients.append(coefficient.value)
    else:
      negligible_coefficients.append(0)

  # Apply inverse transform to significant/moderate coefficients
  transformed_significant = inverse_transform(significant_coefficients)
  transformed_moderate = inverse_transform(moderate_coefficients)

  # Combine transformed coefficients and negligible coefficients
  reconstructed_block = combine_coefficients(transformed_significant, transformed_moderate, negligible_coefficients)

  return reconstructed_block
```

**Novelty:**  Existing approaches focus on spatial sparsification (transmitting only non-zero coefficients). This concept adds perceptual awareness *within* the remaining coefficients, dynamically adjusting precision based on human visual sensitivity. This could yield significantly higher compression ratios without perceivable quality loss. It also allows the inverse transform to be more focused, with more resources dedicated to perceptually important data.
