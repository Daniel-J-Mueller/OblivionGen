## Adaptive Card Stacking & Predictive Dismissal

**Concept:** Extend the card stacking/overlay functionality to incorporate predictive dismissal based on user gaze and micro-gestures, combined with dynamic card priority adjustment informed by real-time environmental context.

**Specs:**

**1. Gaze Tracking Integration:**

*   **Hardware:** Integrate with existing or future device gaze tracking capabilities (IR emitters/cameras, eye-tracking algorithms).
*   **Software:**  Gaze point data stream input.  Establish a ‘dwell time’ threshold.  If gaze remains fixed on a card element (icon, text) for the dwell time, trigger a ‘highlight’ visual cue (subtle animation).  If gaze *averts* from the card stack *while* a highlight is active, initiate a predictive dismissal sequence.

**2. Micro-Gesture Recognition:**

*   **Sensor:** Utilize the device's inertial sensor (accelerometer/gyroscope) and potentially capacitive touch sensors on the device bezel.
*   **Algorithm:**  Develop a model to detect subtle hand movements near the device (e.g., a quick outward swipe *without* physical contact with the screen).  This is a ‘pre-dismissal gesture’.
*   **Integration:**  Combine the pre-dismissal gesture with gaze aversion. The combination signifies a stronger intent to dismiss.

**3. Dynamic Card Priority & ‘Heatmap’ Adjustment:**

*   **Contextual Data:** Access device sensors (location, time, activity – walking, stationary, in meeting) and environmental data (ambient noise, lighting).
*   **Priority Engine:** Develop a dynamic priority algorithm.  Cards are assigned a priority score. Scores are adjusted based on contextual data. For example:
    *   A “Meeting Reminder” card gains priority when location data indicates the user is near the meeting location *and* time data aligns with the meeting start time.
    *   A “News Headline” card loses priority when ambient noise indicates a user is in a focused work environment.
*   **Visual Heatmap:** Implement a subtle visual ‘heatmap’ effect on the card stack. Cards with higher priority are visually ‘warmer’ (e.g., slightly brighter, subtle glow), lower priority cards are ‘cooler’ (desaturated, dimmer).

**4. Predictive Dismissal Sequence:**

*   **Animation:** When gaze aversion and a pre-dismissal gesture are detected, initiate a smooth, predictive dismissal animation. The card subtly shrinks and fades out *before* the user completes a full swipe.
*   **Confirmation Window:** If the user *does* initiate a swipe, the swipe gesture completes the dismissal. If the user withdraws their swipe gesture *during* the predictive dismissal sequence, the card returns to its previous state.
*   **Feedback:** Haptic feedback accompanies the dismissal sequence to confirm the action.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop

While (Device is Active) {

    Get Gaze Data
    Get Sensor Data
    Get Contextual Data

    Update Card Priorities (Based on Contextual Data)
    Render Card Stack (With Priority-Based Visual Heatmap)

    If (Gaze Aversion AND Pre-Dismissal Gesture) {
        Initiate Predictive Dismissal Sequence (Smooth Animation)
        If (User Completes Swipe) {
            Dismiss Card
        } Else {
            Return Card to Previous State
        }
    }
}
```
