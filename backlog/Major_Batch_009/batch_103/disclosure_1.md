## Dynamic Item "Wishlist Evolution" & Proactive Bundling

**Concept:** Extend the non-conversion event tracking to encompass a continuously evolving "wishlist" derived from browsing behavior.  Instead of *just* notifying about price drops or availability, proactively bundle related items based on predicted needs *before* the user actively searches for them, driven by wishlist evolution.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Source:**  Existing User Activity Data (browsing history, time spent on pages, selections within pages, previous purchases). Enhanced with a "Wishlist Confidence" score per item (based on dwell time, repeated views, selection of related options, etc.).
*   **Wishlist Evolution Engine:**
    *   Continuous monitoring of user browsing.
    *   Automatic addition of items to a dynamic "wishlist" when Wishlist Confidence exceeds a threshold (adjustable per user segment).
    *   Decay of Wishlist Confidence over time if no further interaction. Removal from wishlist if confidence falls below a threshold.
    *   "Related Item Prediction" module utilizing collaborative filtering and content-based analysis to identify items likely to be needed *in conjunction* with wishlist items (e.g., if user browses a camera, predict need for memory cards, tripods, camera bags).
*   **Proactive Bundle Generation:**
    *   Bundle creation based on predicted needs (related item prediction).
    *   Dynamic pricing & incentive application to bundles (e.g., percentage discount, free shipping, bundled accessory).
    *   Bundle presentation via multiple channels:
        *   Homepage widget (personalized).
        *   Item detail pages (related bundles).
        *   Email notification (triggered by significant bundle savings or introduction of new bundle components).
*   **"Need Anticipation" Score:** Calculate a score for each user representing the probability that they will make a purchase in the near future, based on wishlist activity and historical data.  Adjust bundle incentives and presentation frequency based on this score.
*   **User Interface Elements:**
    *   "My Evolving Wishlist" page: Displays items, confidence score, related bundle suggestions, and historical price/availability data.
    *   "Bundle Builder" tool: Allows users to customize bundle suggestions or create their own bundles.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (runs continuously for each user)
For Each User:
    UserActivityData = GetLatestUserActivityData()
    UpdateWishlist(UserActivityData)
    PredictedNeeds = PredictNeedsBasedOnWishlist()
    GenerateBundles(PredictedNeeds)
    PresentBundlesToUser()

// UpdateWishlist Function
Function UpdateWishlist(UserActivityData):
    For Each ItemViewed in UserActivityData:
        WishlistConfidence = CalculateWishlistConfidence(ItemViewed)
        If WishlistConfidence > ConfidenceThreshold:
            AddItemToWishlist(ItemViewed, WishlistConfidence)
        Else:
            DecayWishlistConfidence(ItemViewed)
            If WishlistConfidence < DecayThreshold:
                RemoveItemFromWishlist(ItemViewed)

// PredictNeedsBasedOnWishlist Function
Function PredictNeedsBasedOnWishlist():
    For Each ItemInWishlist:
        RelatedItems = GetRelatedItems(ItemInWishlist)  //Collaborative Filtering & Content Analysis
        Sort RelatedItems by Relevance Score
        Return Top N Related Items

//PresentBundlesToUser Function
Function PresentBundlesToUser():
    Calculate 'Need Anticipation' Score
    If NeedAnticipationScore > Threshold:
        Present Bundles on Homepage, Item Detail Pages, & via Email
