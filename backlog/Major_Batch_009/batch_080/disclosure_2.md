## Adaptive Staleness Thresholding & Predictive Decay

**Concept:** Extend the staleness detection beyond simple identification of out-of-date *content* to dynamically adjust staleness thresholds based on content *impact* and *predicted decay*.  The system learns not just *what* is stale, but *how quickly* things become stale *for specific audiences* and adjusts detection accordingly.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Impact Scoring Module:**
    *   Input: Content item (document, search index entry, etc.), User profile/segment data.
    *   Process: Calculates an "Impact Score" based on:
        *   **Historical Engagement:** Views, clicks, shares, time spent (weighted towards recent activity).
        *   **Content Type:** News articles (high decay), legal documents (low decay), product specs (medium decay).
        *   **User Segment:** Different user groups prioritize different information (e.g., experts vs. novices).
        *   **External Signals:**  Trending topics, breaking news events influencing content relevance.
    *   Output: Numerical Impact Score (0-100).

2.  **Decay Prediction Model:**
    *   Data Source: Historical Impact Score data across a large corpus of content.
    *   Model Type:  Time-series forecasting (e.g., LSTM, Prophet).  Trains on how Impact Scores degrade over time for different content types/segments.
    *   Output: Predicted Impact Score at future time intervals.  Defines a "Relevance Horizon" – the time until the content is deemed significantly stale.

3.  **Adaptive Staleness Threshold:**
    *   Input: Predicted Impact Score, Relevance Horizon, User Profile.
    *   Process:  Dynamically calculates a staleness threshold.
        *   High Impact, Long Horizon:  Higher threshold – more tolerance for minor inaccuracies.
        *   Low Impact, Short Horizon:  Lower threshold – stricter staleness detection.
        *   User Profile overrides: Experts may tolerate older data on niche topics.
    *   Output:  Staleness Threshold (percentage change from original Impact Score).

4.  **Integration with Existing System:**
    *   The existing Model Training Service would now also be trained on Impact Score data and Relevance Horizon predictions.
    *   The CSC Service would use the Adaptive Staleness Threshold when processing content.
    *   Output: Instead of just flagging stale content, the system provides a “Relevance Score” indicating the confidence in the content’s accuracy and timeliness.

**Pseudocode (CSC Service Enhancement):**

```
function check_staleness(content_item, user_profile):
  impact_score = calculate_impact_score(content_item, user_profile)
  predicted_impact_score = decay_prediction_model.predict(impact_score)
  staleness_threshold = calculate_adaptive_threshold(predicted_impact_score, user_profile)
  relevance_score = impact_score / predicted_impact_score
  if relevance_score < staleness_threshold:
    flag_content(content_item, "Stale")
    highlight_outdated_sections(content_item)
  else:
    set_relevance_score(content_item, relevance_score)
  return content_item // or relevance score
```

**Potential Benefits:**  Reduces false positives, improves user experience, adapts to evolving information landscapes, and enables more nuanced content management strategies.  Allows for a proactive approach to content staleness, rather than a reactive one.
