## Intersection ‘Echo’ System – Predictive Congestion & Route Mirroring

**Concept:** Leverage the directional bias system to *proactively* mirror traffic routes based on predicted congestion, effectively creating ‘echo’ paths to alleviate bottlenecks *before* they fully form.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Real-time traffic data from all mobile drive units (speed, direction, estimated arrival at intersections).
    *   Historical traffic patterns (time of day, day of week, special events).
    *   External data feeds (construction, weather, public events).
*   **Prediction Engine:**  A recurrent neural network (RNN) trained to predict congestion levels at intersections 5-15 seconds in advance.  Input: historical data, real-time data, external feeds. Output: congestion probability matrix for each intersection and associated routes.
*   **Route Mirroring Algorithm:**
    1.  **Identify Potential Bottleneck:** Prediction Engine flags an intersection with a high probability of congestion (e.g., >70% chance of a slowdown).
    2.  **Identify Mirror Routes:**  The system scans for alternative routes with similar destination points that have lower predicted congestion.  These become ‘mirror’ routes.
    3.  **Proactive Redirection:**  The system *suggests* (or, with higher confidence, *automatically* redirects) a percentage of incoming mobile drive units onto the mirror routes *before* congestion fully develops. The percentage is dynamically adjusted based on prediction confidence and the number of available mirror routes.  A ‘comfort factor’ (user configurable) determines how aggressively redirects are issued.
    4.  **Directional Bias Adjustment:** The system temporarily adjusts the directional bias at intersections on both the primary and mirror routes to favor the flow of redirected traffic.  This creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging more units to follow the preferred paths.
    5.  **Dynamic Re-Evaluation:**  The Prediction Engine and Route Mirroring Algorithm continuously re-evaluate traffic conditions and adjust routes/biases in real-time.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop (runs continuously)

FOR each MobileDriveUnit in MobileDriveUnitList:
    Receive RealTimeData(MobileDriveUnit)
    Update HistoricalData(MobileDriveUnit)

// Prediction Engine
congestionMatrix = PredictCongestion(HistoricalData, RealTimeData, ExternalFeeds)

// Route Mirroring Algorithm
FOR each Intersection in IntersectionList:
    IF congestionMatrix[Intersection] > Threshold:
        mirrorRoutes = FindMirrorRoutes(Intersection, congestionMatrix)
        redirectPercentage = CalculateRedirectPercentage(congestionMatrix, mirrorRoutes)
        FOR i = 0 to redirectPercentage:
            IF IncomingDriveUnitExists(Intersection):
                RedirectDriveUnit(IncomingDriveUnit, mirrorRoutes)
                AdjustDirectionalBias(Intersection, mirrorRoutes)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-performance computing cluster for running the Prediction Engine.
*   Low-latency communication network for real-time data exchange.
*   Integration with existing mobile drive unit control systems.
