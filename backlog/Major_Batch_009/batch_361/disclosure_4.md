## Dynamic Resource 'Shadowing' and Predictive Inventory

**Concept:** Extend the inventory system to not just *report* on current resource state, but to proactively create a 'shadow' inventory representing *predicted* future states based on observed usage patterns and scheduled changes.

**Specification:**

**1. Shadow Inventory Creation:**

*   **Data Sources:** Utilize existing gatherer data, augmented with:
    *   Scheduled maintenance windows (from existing system management tools).
    *   Application deployment schedules (integrated with CI/CD pipelines).
    *   Real-time resource utilization metrics (CPU, memory, network I/O).
    *   Log analysis for application-level change detection (e.g., new feature flags enabled).
*   **Prediction Engine:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) to predict resource configuration changes.  The engine learns from historical data to anticipate future states.  Different models can be employed per resource type or application.
*   **Shadow Data Structure:**  A parallel data structure mirroring the live inventory, but populated with predicted values.  Each entry includes a confidence score representing the prediction accuracy.  (Confidence can be determined via cross-validation.)

**2.  'What-If' Analysis Interface:**

*   **Simulated Deployments:**  Allow users to simulate the impact of code deployments or configuration changes *before* applying them to live resources. The system applies the simulated changes to the shadow inventory and displays the predicted resource state.
*   **Capacity Planning:**  Model projected workload increases and assess the impact on resource requirements.  Identify potential bottlenecks or resource shortages *before* they occur.
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Highlight potential conflicts between predicted changes and existing resource configurations. Flag situations where a change might cause service disruptions or performance degradation.

**3.  Dynamic Gatherer Orchestration:**

*   **Adaptive Sampling:**  Adjust the frequency of gatherer execution based on the prediction accuracy.  If the prediction engine is confident, reduce the gathering frequency.  If the prediction accuracy is low, increase the gathering frequency to gather more data.
*   **Targeted Gathering:**  Direct gatherers to focus on specific resources or configuration parameters that are predicted to change.
*   **'Pre-emptive' Gathering:**  Trigger gatherers to collect data *before* a scheduled change occurs, allowing for a baseline comparison.

**4.  Integration with Automation Tools:**

*   **Automated Rollback:**  If a simulated deployment reveals a critical issue, automatically trigger a rollback procedure.
*   **Proactive Scaling:**  Based on predicted workload increases, automatically scale resources up or down.
*   **Automated Remediation:**  If a predicted issue is unavoidable, automatically trigger a remediation workflow (e.g., restart a service, failover to a redundant instance).

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function predict_resource_state(resource_id, timestamp):
  historical_data = get_historical_data(resource_id)
  scheduled_events = get_scheduled_events(resource_id, timestamp)

  model = select_best_model(resource_id)  // Based on historical accuracy
  predicted_state = model.predict(historical_data, scheduled_events, timestamp)

  confidence_score = model.evaluate(predicted_state, historical_data)

  return predicted_state, confidence_score
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `ShadowInventoryEntry`: {`resource_id`, `predicted_state`, `confidence_score`, `last_updated` }
*   `ScheduledEvent`: {`event_id`, `resource_id`, `event_type`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `details` }
