## Dynamic Tile Shaping with Predictive Geometry

**Concept:** Extend the core concept of dynamic tiling by not just *what* content goes *into* a tile, but *how* the tile itself is shaped, based on predicted user gaze and interaction. Instead of strictly rectangular tiles, utilize non-rectangular, dynamically adjusted polygonal tiles that conform to areas the user is most likely to focus on. This would dramatically reduce wasted rendering resources and improve perceived responsiveness.

**Specs:**

*   **Gaze Prediction Module:** Integrate with existing eye-tracking hardware or utilize webcam-based gaze estimation (even rudimentary).  This module predicts the user’s likely gaze point within a set timeframe (e.g., 100ms - 500ms).  Output: X, Y coordinates, confidence level.
*   **Interaction Prediction Module:**  Analyze user interaction patterns (mouse movements, touch gestures, scrolling behavior) to predict likely areas of interest (buttons, links, form fields). Output: bounding boxes of predicted interaction areas, confidence level.
*   **Tile Geometry Engine:**  A core component responsible for generating and managing tile geometry.
    *   Input: Content page DOM, gaze prediction data, interaction prediction data, performance constraints (CPU/GPU load thresholds).
    *   Algorithm:
        1.  **Initial Rectangular Tile Grid:** Start with a standard rectangular tile grid as a baseline.
        2.  **Heatmap Generation:** Combine gaze and interaction data to create a 'heat map' of user attention. Higher density = higher attention.
        3.  **Voronoi Diagram Generation:**  Generate a Voronoi diagram based on the 'attention points' (peaks in the heatmap). Each Voronoi cell represents a potential tile.
        4.  **Tile Merging & Simplification:**  Merge adjacent tiles with low attention levels or similar content. Simplify the resulting polygon mesh to reduce complexity.
        5.  **Performance Check:**  Evaluate the CPU/GPU load associated with rendering the generated tile configuration. If thresholds are exceeded, iteratively simplify the mesh or revert to a more conservative tile configuration.
        6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Continuously monitor gaze and interaction data, and re-generate the tile configuration as needed (e.g., every 100-200ms).
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** Adapt the rendering pipeline to support non-rectangular tiles. Utilize techniques like mesh shaders or tessellation to efficiently render the dynamic tile geometry.
*   **Content Segmentation:** The system needs to segment content appropriately for tiling.  Intelligent content grouping algorithms should prioritize semantic coherence within tiles. (e.g. don’t split a paragraph across multiple tiles).

**Pseudocode (Tile Geometry Engine - Simplified):**

```
function generateTileGeometry(contentDOM, gazeData, interactionData, performanceConstraints) {
  // 1. Create initial rectangular tile grid
  tileGrid = createRectangularTileGrid(contentDOM);

  // 2. Generate attention points from gaze & interaction data
  attentionPoints = generateAttentionPoints(gazeData, interactionData);

  // 3. Generate Voronoi diagram
  voronoiDiagram = generateVoronoiDiagram(attentionPoints);

  // 4. Create tiles from Voronoi cells
  tiles = createTilesFromVoronoiCells(voronoiDiagram, contentDOM);

  // 5. Simplify & merge tiles based on performance constraints
  while (CPU_load > threshold OR GPU_load > threshold) {
    mergeLowestAttentionTiles(tiles);
    simplifyTileGeometry(tiles);
  }

  return tiles;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced rendering overhead by focusing resources on areas the user is actively looking at.
*   Improved perceived responsiveness and smoothness.
*   More visually engaging and immersive user experience.
*   Potential for personalized content delivery based on user attention patterns.
