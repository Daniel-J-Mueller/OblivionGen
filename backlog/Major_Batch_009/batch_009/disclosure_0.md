## Adaptive Datapath ‘Stitching’ for Heterogeneous Chiplets

**Concept:** Extend the pipelining approach to inter-chiplet communication, but introduce a ‘stitching’ mechanism that dynamically reconfigures datapath length *after* placement and routing. This addresses timing variations stemming from manufacturing tolerances and operating conditions *without* requiring redesign or respinning of the chiplets.

**Specification:**

1.  **Chiplet Architecture:** Assume a modular design with multiple functionally specialized chiplets communicating over a high-bandwidth interconnect (e.g., UCIe). Chiplets contain master and servant partitions as in the source patent.

2.  **‘Stitch’ Points:**  Between each master and servant partition pair, introduce configurable 'stitch' points within the interconnect. These are essentially arrays of programmable delay lines, configurable buffers, and muxes. The number of stitch points is determined during initial design, and strategically placed based on simulations predicting worst-case path delays.

3.  **Runtime Calibration:** During post-fabrication testing (and potentially periodically during operation), a calibration routine activates each master partition. The master transmits a test pattern to its corresponding servant. The servant measures the arrival time and reports back to the master.

4.  **Delay Line Configuration:** Based on the arrival time, the master adjusts the programmable delay lines and buffer configurations within the stitch points. The goal is to equalize the effective datapath length for all master-servant pairs.

5.  **Granularity Control:** Stitch point granularity is configurable. Coarse-grained adjustment changes the delay of entire blocks of data. Fine-grained adjustment affects individual bits or nibbles, allowing for compensation of skew.

6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** Implement a closed-loop feedback system that monitors datapath latency during operation. The system can automatically adjust stitch point configurations to compensate for temperature variations, voltage fluctuations, and process drift.

7.  **Arbitration Logic Integration:** The arbitration logic within the servant partitions needs to be aware of the dynamically adjusted datapath lengths. This ensures fair access to resources and prevents deadlock.

**Pseudocode (Calibration Routine):**

```
// Master Partition
function calibrate(servant_id) {
  test_pattern = generate_test_pattern();
  transmit(test_pattern, servant_id);
  arrival_time = receive_arrival_time(servant_id);
  target_time = calculate_target_time(); // Based on clock frequency and ideal path length
  delta_time = target_time - arrival_time;

  stitch_configuration = calculate_stitch_configuration(delta_time);

  send_configuration(servant_id, stitch_configuration);
}

function calculate_stitch_configuration(delta_time) {
  // Algorithm to determine delay line settings and buffer enable/disable
  // based on the time difference.
  // Consider delay line resolution, buffer latency, and mux configurations.
}

// Servant Partition
function receive_arrival_time() {
  // Measure time of arrival for the test pattern
  return current_time;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved performance and yield.
*   Increased design flexibility.
*   Reduced reliance on accurate pre-characterization.
*   Support for heterogeneous chiplet integration.
*   Enhanced robustness to manufacturing variations.
