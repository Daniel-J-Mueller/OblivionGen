## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Mapping for Multi-Channel Audio

**Concept:** Extend the clock synchronization concept to *actively map* resonance frequencies within a multi-channel audio system. Instead of solely focusing on sample rate offsets, this system identifies and compensates for variations in physical resonance – the way sound waves naturally vibrate within speaker enclosures, microphone housings, and even the surrounding environment. This goes beyond timing correction to address *tonal* differences that impact echo cancellation performance.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-precision MEMS accelerometers integrated into each speaker and microphone unit. (Target sensitivity: +/- 0.1 Hz)
    *   Dedicated low-latency ADC/DAC for accelerometer data processing.
    *   DSP capable of FFT and real-time filtering.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Resonance Profiler:** Upon system initialization, each speaker emits a swept sine wave across a defined frequency range (20Hz – 20kHz). The accelerometer data captures the resulting vibrational profile of the enclosure. A baseline resonance fingerprint is created.
    *   **Environmental Resonance Mapper:** A continuously running process analyzing ambient audio captured by microphones. It identifies dominant environmental resonance frequencies (room modes, structural vibrations) contributing to the overall soundscape.
    *   **Dynamic Compensation Filter:** An adaptive filter that alters the transmitted audio signal *before* it reaches the speaker. This filter dynamically adjusts the frequency response to counteract the identified resonance characteristics of both the speaker/environment *and* the microphone. (Uses IIR filtering for low latency).
    *   **Cross-Channel Phase Alignment:** Adjusts the phase of audio signals across different channels to minimize inter-channel interference arising from resonance-induced timing variations. (Uses Hilbert Transform for phase estimation).
*   **Pseudocode (Dynamic Compensation Filter):**

```
// Input: Audio signal (audio_in), Resonance Profile (resonance_profile)
// Output: Compensated audio signal (audio_out)

function compensate_audio(audio_in, resonance_profile):
    fft_audio = FFT(audio_in)
    fft_resonance = FFT(resonance_profile)

    // Calculate the inverse resonance signature.  (1/resonance_profile)
    inverse_resonance = 1.0 / fft_resonance 

    // Apply compensation in the frequency domain
    fft_compensated = fft_audio * inverse_resonance

    // Convert back to time domain
    audio_out = IFFT(fft_compensated)

    return audio_out
```

*   **Communication Protocol:**
    *   High-speed, low-latency communication bus (e.g., EtherCAT) for sharing resonance profiles and compensation parameters between devices.
*   **Calibration Routine:**
    *   Automated calibration process utilizing a known acoustic reference signal and measurement microphones to verify the accuracy of the resonance profiling and compensation.

**Novelty:**

This system goes beyond simple timing correction. It actively maps the *physical* resonance characteristics of the audio system and environment, and utilizes this information to *pre-shape* the audio signal, improving echo cancellation performance by reducing tonal discrepancies between the original signal and the sound captured by the microphones.  This pre-shaping effectively 'flattens' the frequency response, making the echo cancellation algorithm more effective.
