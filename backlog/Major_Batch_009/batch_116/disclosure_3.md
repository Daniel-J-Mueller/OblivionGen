## Dynamic Transaction Instrument 'Splitting' & Micro-Offers

**Concept:** Extend the core idea of customized transactions based on membership status to allow for *dynamic splitting* of transaction amounts across multiple transaction instruments (cards, accounts, etc.) *and* delivery of 'micro-offers' tied to each split portion.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   `TransactionSplit`:
    *   `instrument_id`: Unique identifier for the transaction instrument.
    *   `split_percentage`: Percentage of the total transaction amount allocated to this instrument (sum of all splits = 100%).
    *   `micro_offer_id`: Identifier for a specific, targeted offer applying *only* to this split portion.
    *   `authorization_status`: Status of authorization for this split (pending, approved, declined).
*   `MicroOffer`:
    *   `offer_id`: Unique offer identifier.
    *   `offer_details`: JSON payload containing offer specifics (discount, points multiplier, etc.).
    *   `eligibility_rules`: Rules defining which user accounts/segments are eligible.
    *   `instrument_types`: Allowed transaction instrument types for this offer.

**2. System Components:**

*   **Split Decision Engine:**  Responsible for determining the optimal split of a transaction across available instruments based on user profile, membership status, offer eligibility, and potentially real-time risk assessment.
*   **Offer Orchestrator:**  Identifies and delivers relevant `MicroOffer`s to the `Split Decision Engine` based on user profile and transaction context.
*   **Instrument Authorization Manager:** Manages the authorization process for each split portion of the transaction with the respective payment processors.
*   **Dynamic UI Module:** Adapts the user interface to display split payment options, allowing users to review and potentially override the system-determined split.

**3. Process Flow:**

1.  User initiates a transaction.
2.  System authenticates user and retrieves user profile, including membership status and linked transaction instruments.
3.  The `Offer Orchestrator` retrieves eligible `MicroOffer`s based on user profile and transaction details.
4.  The `Split Decision Engine` determines the optimal split of the transaction amount across available instruments, considering:
    *   User preferences (if any).
    *   `MicroOffer` eligibility and potential savings.
    *   Instrument limits and available credit.
    *   Risk scores associated with each instrument.
5.  The `Dynamic UI Module` presents the split payment options to the user, displaying the amount allocated to each instrument and any associated `MicroOffer` details.
6.  User confirms or modifies the split payment options.
7.  The `Instrument Authorization Manager` initiates authorization requests for each split portion with the respective payment processors.
8.  Upon successful authorization, the transaction is completed.
9.  The system records the transaction details, including the split payment configuration and any applied `MicroOffer`s.

**4. Pseudocode (Split Decision Engine):**

```
function determineTransactionSplit(userProfile, transactionAmount, availableInstruments, eligibleOffers):
  splitConfig = []
  remainingAmount = transactionAmount

  for each instrument in availableInstruments:
    bestOffer = null
    maxSavings = 0

    for each offer in eligibleOffers:
      if (offer.instrument_types contains instrument.type):
        savings = calculateSavings(offer, remainingAmount)
        if (savings > maxSavings):
          maxSavings = savings
          bestOffer = offer

    if (bestOffer != null):
      splitAmount = min(remainingAmount, max(bestOffer.minSpend, remainingAmount * bestOffer.splitPercentage))
      splitConfig.add({instrumentId: instrument.id, splitAmount: splitAmount, offerId: bestOffer.id})
      remainingAmount -= splitAmount
    else:
      //No offer, allocate proportionally
      splitAmount = remainingAmount / len(availableInstruments)
      splitConfig.add({instrumentId: instrument.id, splitAmount: splitAmount, offerId: null})
      remainingAmount = 0

  //Handle rounding errors
  if (remainingAmount > 0):
    //Distribute remaining amount to instruments with offers
    for i in range(len(splitConfig)):
        if splitConfig[i].offerId != null:
            splitConfig[i].splitAmount += remainingAmount / splitConfig.length()
            break;

  return splitConfig
```

**Novelty:**  This goes beyond simply offering a discount on a transaction. It enables granular control over how a transaction is paid, dynamically splitting it across multiple instruments and applying *different* offers to each split portion, maximizing both user benefits and provider revenue opportunities. It adds a layer of complexity, but introduces a potent new method for customer engagement.
