## Dynamic Projection Mapping via Multi-Agent Drone Swarm

**Concept:** Expand the single-point calibration of projection distortion to a dynamic, real-time system utilizing a swarm of miniature drones equipped with cameras and calibrated laser emitters. The drones act as mobile, distributed calibration points, actively mapping projection distortions and relaying correction data to the projection device.

**Specs:**

*   **Drone Swarm:** 5-20 miniature drones (approx. 100g each) with the following capabilities:
    *   High-resolution camera (minimum 1080p, 60fps)
    *   Calibrated laser emitter (visible spectrum, adjustable intensity)
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for precise spatial orientation
    *   Wireless communication module (Wi-Fi 6 or equivalent)
    *   Autonomous flight and obstacle avoidance capabilities
    *   Battery life: minimum 15 minutes continuous operation
*   **Projection Device Interface:**  Custom API for receiving real-time distortion correction data from the drone swarm. Supports keystone correction, color/brightness adjustments, and potentially warping mesh data for complex surface projections.
*   **Central Processing Unit:** A dedicated processing unit (edge compute device or cloud-based server) responsible for:
    *   Drone swarm coordination and control.
    *   Real-time image processing and distortion analysis.
    *   Calculation of correction parameters.
    *   Communication with the projection device.

**Operation:**

1.  **Initialization:** The drone swarm is launched and autonomously navigates to pre-defined positions within the projection environment.  Positions are distributed to maximize coverage and minimize occlusion.
2.  **Calibration Phase:** Each drone projects its laser onto the projection surface. The projection device simultaneously projects a test pattern. Drones capture images of the test pattern with the laser as a reference point. The central processing unit analyzes the captured images to determine the distortion present at each drone's location. This is essentially a distributed, real-time version of the patentâ€™s calibration process.
3.  **Dynamic Correction:** During projection, drones continuously monitor the projected image and compare it to the expected image. Any detected distortion is immediately relayed to the central processing unit. The CPU calculates the necessary correction parameters and sends them to the projection device in real-time. Drones can also adjust their position slightly to improve the accuracy of distortion measurements.
4.  **Adaptive Mesh Generation:**  The system generates a dynamic, high-resolution distortion mesh based on the data from the drone swarm. This mesh is used to warp the projected image in real-time, ensuring accurate and seamless projection on any surface, even those that are moving or deforming.

**Pseudocode (CPU side):**

```
// Drone Data Structure
struct DroneData {
  droneID;
  positionX, positionY, positionZ;
  cameraOrientationX, cameraOrientationY, cameraOrientationZ;
  imageCaptured;
};

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Receive Data from Drones
  for each drone in droneSwarm {
    receive DroneData from drone;
  }

  // 2. Process Images & Calculate Distortion
  distortionMap = calculateDistortion(droneSwarmImages);

  // 3. Generate Correction Parameters
  correctionParameters = generateCorrectionParameters(distortionMap);

  // 4. Send Correction Parameters to Projection Device
  send correctionParameters to projectionDevice;

  // 5. Optional: Adjust Drone Positions
  if (distortion exceeds threshold) {
      adjustDronePositions(droneSwarm);
  }
}
```

**Novelty & Potential:**

*   **Dynamic Calibration:** Addresses the limitations of static calibration by adapting to changes in the projection environment.
*   **Complex Surfaces:** Enables projection onto non-planar, moving, or deforming surfaces.
*   **Immersive Experiences:**  Creates highly immersive augmented reality experiences.
*   **Scalability:**  The swarm size can be adjusted to meet the requirements of different projection environments.
