## Predictive Partitioning & Adaptive Retention

**Concept:** Extend the existing partitioning scheme with a predictive component, anticipating future data access patterns to *dynamically* adjust partition assignments and retention policies. This moves beyond static hashing and timestamp-based eviction towards a self-optimizing data lifecycle management system.

**Specs:**

1.  **Access Pattern Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Historical data access logs (metric identifier, timestamp of access).
    *   Algorithm: Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict future access frequency for each metric identifier.  Consider seasonality, trends, and cyclical patterns.
    *   Output: Predicted access score for each metric identifier (normalized 0-1).

2.  **Dynamic Partition Assignment:**
    *   Trigger: Partition reassignment occurs periodically (e.g., hourly) or when a significant shift in predicted access scores is detected.
    *   Logic:
        *   Calculate a weighted score for each partition based on the predicted access scores of the metric identifiers currently assigned to it.
        *   If a metric identifier's predicted access score exceeds a threshold *and* its current partition's weighted score is below a threshold, migrate that metric identifier to a different partition with a higher weighted score.
        *   Prioritize migrations to partitions with available capacity.  If all partitions are near capacity, employ a limited eviction strategy (see Adaptive Retention).
    *   Implementation:  A background service monitors access patterns and initiates migrations asynchronously.

3.  **Adaptive Retention Policy:**
    *   Input: Predicted access score for each metric identifier, current retention policy, partition capacity.
    *   Logic:
        *   Adjust retention periods dynamically based on predicted access frequency.
            *   High Access Score: Extend retention period.
            *   Low Access Score: Shorten retention period.
        *   When a partition is nearing capacity *and* a metric identifier's retention period is near expiration, prioritize eviction of that identifier *before* evicting identifiers with longer remaining retention periods.
        *   Implement a “grace period” – even if retention expires, retain the data for a short period to handle late access requests.
    *   Implementation: A retention manager service monitors retention policies and manages eviction based on predicted access scores and partition capacity.

4.  **Data Serialization Enhancement:**
    *   Extend the binary serialization format to include a “prediction score” for each measurement. This allows retrieval services to prioritize data from frequently accessed metrics.
    *   Include metadata on prediction model version and last updated timestamp.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Partition Assignment):**

```
function reassess_partitions(access_logs, current_partition_assignments):
    partition_scores = {}  // Dictionary to store scores for each partition
    for partition_id in get_all_partition_ids():
        partition_scores[partition_id] = 0

    for log_entry in access_logs:
        metric_id = log_entry.metric_id
        current_partition = current_partition_assignments[metric_id]
        partition_scores[current_partition] += 1

    for metric_id, current_partition in current_partition_assignments.items():
        predicted_access_score = predict_access_score(metric_id)
        if predicted_access_score > HIGH_ACCESS_THRESHOLD and partition_scores[current_partition] < LOW_PARTITION_SCORE_THRESHOLD:
            best_target_partition = find_best_target_partition(partition_scores)
            if best_target_partition:
                migrate_metric_id(metric_id, best_target_partition)
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Model Training:** Regularly retrain the access pattern prediction model with the latest data to maintain accuracy.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Monitor partition capacity, migration rates, and prediction accuracy. Alert operators if performance degrades or anomalies are detected.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement robust conflict resolution mechanisms to handle concurrent access and modification of data during migrations.
