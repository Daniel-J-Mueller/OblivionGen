**Adaptive Skill Chaining with Predictive Data Prefetching**

**Core Concept:** Extend the described system to proactively anticipate data needs *across* skill chains, pre-fetching information before it's explicitly requested, using a probabilistic model informed by user history, context, and skill dependencies.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Probabilistic Skill Dependency Graph:**
    *   Maintain a graph representing skill relationships. Nodes are skills (speechlets). Edges represent the probability of one skill invoking another, weighted by historical usage data.
    *   Weights dynamically adjusted based on real-time user interaction and feedback.
    *   Graph construction and updating handled by a separate 'Skill Dependency Learning' module.

2.  **Contextual User Profile Expansion:**
    *   Extend user profiles to include:
        *   'Skill Affinity' - a vector representing user preference for specific skills.
        *   'Temporal Skill Usage' - a time-series of skill invocations.
        *   'Contextual Anchors' - tags associated with frequently co-occurring skills. (e.g., "Morning Routine", "Driving Mode").

3.  **Predictive Data Prefetching Module:**
    *   Input: Current user utterance, active skill chain, contextual user profile, skill dependency graph.
    *   Process:
        *   Analyze the current skill chain and identify potential next skills based on the graph and user profile.
        *   For each potential next skill, determine the required input data.
        *   Based on historical data, predict the probability that this data *will* be needed before it's explicitly requested.
        *   If the probability exceeds a threshold, initiate a pre-fetch request to the relevant skill component.

    *Pseudocode:*

```
function prefetch_data(utterance, skill_chain, user_profile, skill_graph) {
  potential_next_skills = skill_graph.get_next_skills(skill_chain, user_profile);
  for (skill in potential_next_skills) {
    required_data = skill.get_required_data();
    prefetch_probability = calculate_prefetch_probability(required_data, user_profile, skill);
    if (prefetch_probability > PREFETCH_THRESHOLD) {
      request_data(required_data, skill);
    }
  }
}

function calculate_prefetch_probability(data, profile, skill) {
  // Combine historical data, user profile, and skill dependencies to calculate probability
  // Implement a probabilistic model (e.g., Bayesian network, Markov model)
  // Consider temporal aspects (e.g., time since last request)
  return probability;
}
```

4.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**
    *   The `PREFETCH_THRESHOLD` should be dynamically adjusted based on:
        *   User latency tolerance (measured implicitly from interaction speed).
        *   System resource availability.
        *   Accuracy of the predictive model.

5.  **Data Cache & Eviction:**
    *   Implement a caching mechanism to store pre-fetched data.
    *   Use an LRU (Least Recently Used) or similar eviction policy.

6.  **Feedback Loop:**
    *   Monitor the accuracy of pre-fetches.
    *   If data is pre-fetched but not used, decrease the probability of pre-fetching that data in the future.
    *   If data is needed but not pre-fetched, increase the probability of pre-fetching that data in the future.
