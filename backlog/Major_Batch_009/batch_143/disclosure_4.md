## Dynamic Contextual Catalog Expansion via Generative AI

**Concept:** Leverage generative AI to dynamically expand catalog item descriptions *and* associated secondary content (like the linked encyclopedia articles) with hyper-personalized contextual information derived from real-time user behavior and external data sources.  Instead of static supplementary content, create a "living" catalog experience.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & User Profile Construction:**

*   **Real-time Behavior Tracking:** Monitor user interactions within the catalog system (views, clicks, purchases, dwell time, search queries).
*   **External Data Integration:**  Access data feeds like:
    *   Social media trends (relevant hashtags, trending topics).
    *   News feeds (articles related to catalog items).
    *   Geographic location (user’s city, weather).
    *   Calendar data (upcoming events, holidays).
*   **User Profile Creation:** Construct dynamic user profiles incorporating behavioral data, demographic information (if available), and inferred interests. Profiles should be represented as a vector embedding.

**2. Generative AI Engine:**

*   **Model:** Fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) – potentially a variant of GPT-3 or similar.  Must be capable of text generation *and* contextual understanding.
*   **Prompt Engineering:**  Develop a prompting system that accepts:
    *   Catalog Item Data (name, description, specifications).
    *   Associated Secondary Content (existing encyclopedia article).
    *   User Profile Vector Embedding.
    *   Contextual Signals (time of day, weather, trending topics).
*   **Output:**  Generate:
    *   **Expanded Catalog Description:** A revised catalog item description incorporating personalized details relevant to the user and current context.  (e.g., "This hiking backpack is perfect for your upcoming trip to Yosemite next week, where temperatures are expected to be mild.")
    *   **Dynamic Secondary Content Supplement:** A short paragraph or bullet point list that *augments* the existing encyclopedia article with personalized information (e.g., "Did you know this author also wrote a series of books popular in your city?")

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservice Architecture:**  The system should be implemented as a set of independent microservices:
    *   **Data Ingestion Service:** Collects and processes user behavior and external data.
    *   **Profile Service:** Manages user profiles.
    *   **AI Generation Service:** Hosts the LLM and handles content generation requests.
    *   **Catalog Service:** Integrates the generated content into the catalog item display.
*   **API Integration:** Expose APIs for the Catalog Service to request personalized content for specific items and users.
*   **Caching Layer:** Implement a caching mechanism to reduce latency and AI generation costs.

**4. Pseudocode (Catalog Service API Request):**

```
function getPersonalizedCatalogItem(itemId, userId) {
  userProfile = profileService.getUserProfile(userId);
  contextualSignals = dataIngestionService.getContextualSignals();

  aiResponse = aiGenerationService.generatePersonalizedContent(
    itemId,
    userProfile,
    contextualSignals
  );

  // aiResponse contains:
  //  - expandedDescription
  //  - dynamicSecondaryContent

  catalogItem = catalogService.getCatalogItem(itemId);
  catalogItem.description = aiResponse.expandedDescription;
  catalogItem.secondaryContent = aiResponse.dynamicSecondaryContent;

  return catalogItem;
}
```

**5. User Interface Considerations:**

*   **Subtle Integration:** Avoid jarring transitions or overly aggressive personalization.
*   **Transparency:**  Consider a visual cue to indicate that the content has been personalized (e.g., a small icon).
*   **User Control:** Provide users with options to adjust the level of personalization or disable it entirely.
