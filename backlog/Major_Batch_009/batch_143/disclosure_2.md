## Automated Schema Reconciliation with Predictive Refactoring

**Concept:** Expand on the schema conversion aspect of the patent by introducing *predictive refactoring*. Instead of simply converting schema elements, the system analyzes code *using* those schema elements to predict potential compatibility issues *before* migration, and automatically proposes refactoring solutions. This goes beyond simple conversion to proactively minimizing post-migration code adjustments.

**Specifications:**

**1. Component: Predictive Analysis Engine**

   *   **Input:** Source schema, source code (SQL, stored procedures, application code accessing the database), target schema.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Dependency Mapping:** Analyze source code to identify dependencies on specific schema elements (tables, columns, data types, constraints).
        *   **Compatibility Assessment:** Compare source and target schema. Identify direct incompatibilities (e.g., different data types, missing columns).
        *   **Behavioral Analysis:**  Utilize static analysis techniques to understand the *behavior* of code accessing schema elements. This includes identifying common query patterns, data transformation logic, and error handling. 
        *   **Impact Prediction:** For each incompatibility, predict the potential impact on existing code.  This uses the behavioral analysis to estimate how many code blocks would be affected and the complexity of the required changes.
        *   **Refactoring Suggestion Generation:** Generate a list of potential refactoring solutions for each incompatibility.  These solutions could include:
            *   Data type transformations.
            *   Column renaming/mapping.
            *   Code modifications to accommodate schema changes.
            *   Creation of views or stored procedures to maintain backward compatibility.
        *   **Cost Estimation:** Assign a "cost" to each refactoring solution based on factors like code complexity, potential impact on performance, and estimated development effort.

**2. Component: Automated Refactoring Module**

   *   **Input:** Refactoring suggestions with cost estimates.
   *   **Process:**
        *   **Refactoring Application:** Apply the refactoring suggestions to the source code. This could be done automatically for simple changes or presented to the developer for approval in more complex cases.
        *   **Unit Testing Integration:**  Automatically generate unit tests to verify the correctness of the refactored code.
        *   **Code Versioning:** Maintain a complete version history of all code changes.

**3. Component:  Schema Conflict Resolution Interface**

   *   **Input:** List of identified schema conflicts, predicted impact, refactoring suggestions, and cost estimates.
   *   **Output:** Interactive interface for developers to:
        *   Review schema conflicts.
        *   Evaluate refactoring suggestions.
        *   Approve or reject refactoring solutions.
        *   Manually modify code if necessary.
        *   Track the status of all schema conflicts.

**Pseudocode (Refactoring Suggestion Generation):**

```
FUNCTION generateRefactoringSuggestions(sourceSchema, targetSchema, sourceCode):
  conflicts = identifySchemaConflicts(sourceSchema, targetSchema)
  suggestions = []
  FOR EACH conflict IN conflicts:
    impactAnalysis = performImpactAnalysis(conflict, sourceCode)
    refactorings = generatePotentialRefactorings(conflict, targetSchema)
    FOR EACH refactoring IN refactorings:
      cost = estimateRefactoringCost(refactoring, impactAnalysis)
      suggestion = {
        "conflict": conflict,
        "refactoring": refactoring,
        "cost": cost,
        "impactAnalysis": impactAnalysis
      }
      suggestions.append(suggestion)
  RETURN suggestions
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Schema Conflict:**  { type: "data_type_mismatch", source_column: "...", target_column: "...", source_data_type: "...", target_data_type: "..." }
*   **Refactoring Suggestion:** { type: "data_type_conversion", source_column: "...", target_column: "...", conversion_function: "...", estimated_effort: "..." }

**Novelty:** 

This goes beyond simple schema conversion by *proactively* addressing potential code compatibility issues *before* migration. It introduces a cost-benefit analysis of different refactoring solutions, allowing developers to make informed decisions and minimize post-migration effort. The behavioral analysis adds a layer of intelligence to the process, ensuring that refactoring solutions do not introduce unintended side effects.
