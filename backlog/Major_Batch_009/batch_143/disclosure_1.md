## Virtual Character Emotional Contagion System

**System Overview:**

This system expands on the avatar-based support interface by incorporating real-time emotional state detection from the live support agent and subtly mirroring those emotions in the virtual character's animation and vocal delivery. The goal is to foster greater rapport and empathy during the support interaction, improving customer satisfaction.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Agent Emotion Analysis Module:**
    *   **Input:** Live audio and video feed from the support agent.
    *   **Processing:** Utilizes computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze:
        *   Facial expressions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise).
        *   Voice tonality (e.g., pitch, speed, volume).
        *   Sentiment analysis of spoken words.
    *   **Output:**  A real-time "emotion vector" representing the dominant emotional states of the agent.  Example: {Happiness: 0.7, Empathy: 0.5, Neutral: 0.2}.

2.  **Virtual Character Emotion Engine:**
    *   **Input:**  Emotion vector from Agent Emotion Analysis Module.  Pre-defined mapping of emotional states to avatar animation parameters and vocal characteristics.
    *   **Processing:** Modifies avatar animation in real-time.
        *   **Facial Expressions:** Adjusts avatar’s facial muscles to reflect detected emotions. For example, slight eyebrow raise for surprise, subtle smile for happiness, furrowed brows for concern.
        *   **Body Language:** Incorporates minor shifts in posture, head movements, and hand gestures to reflect emotional state. (e.g. Leaning forward to express engagement, slight head tilt for empathy).
        *   **Vocal Modulation:** Adjusts avatar's vocal delivery using text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. (e.g., Pitch variation, speaking rate, intonation). This is achieved by adjusting the TTS engine's parameters based on the emotion vector.
        *   **Subtlety Control:**  Critical parameter to prevent the avatar from appearing overly dramatic or artificial.  A "Subtlety Factor" (0.0-1.0) controls the intensity of emotional mirroring.

3.  **Customer Feedback Loop:**
    *   **Input:**  Real-time sentiment analysis of customer voice/text input during the session.
    *   **Processing:** The system monitors the customer's emotional response to the avatar’s emotional mirroring.
    *   **Output:**  Dynamic adjustment of the “Subtlety Factor” to optimize emotional rapport.  If the customer’s sentiment decreases, the Subtlety Factor is lowered.

**Pseudocode - Virtual Character Emotion Engine:**

```
function UpdateAvatarEmotion(emotionVector, subtletyFactor) {
  happinessLevel = emotionVector.Happiness * subtletyFactor
  empathyLevel = emotionVector.Empathy * subtletyFactor
  neutralLevel = emotionVector.Neutral * subtletyFactor

  // Adjust Facial Expression Parameters
  avatar.mouthSmile = happinessLevel * 0.5 // Map level to animation value
  avatar.eyebrowRaise = empathyLevel * 0.3
  avatar.eyebrowFurrow = (1 - empathyLevel) * 0.2

  // Adjust Body Language Parameters
  avatar.headTilt = empathyLevel * 5  // Degrees
  avatar.leanForward = (happinessLevel + empathyLevel) * 0.1 // Proportion

  // Adjust Vocal Parameters
  ttsEngine.pitch = basePitch + (happinessLevel * pitchVariance)
  ttsEngine.rate = baseRate + (empathyLevel * rateVariance)
  ttsEngine.intonation = baseIntonation + (happinessLevel * intonationVariance)
}

function MainLoop() {
  emotionVector = AgentEmotionAnalysisModule.GetEmotionVector()
  UpdateAvatarEmotion(emotionVector, subtletyFactor)
  RenderAvatar()
}
```

**System Specifications:**

*   **Processing Requirements:** Dedicated GPU for real-time facial expression rendering. High-speed CPU for emotion analysis and TTS processing.
*   **Software Requirements:**  Facial expression recognition library.  Advanced TTS engine with parameter control.  3D animation software.
*   **Data Requirements:**  Training dataset for facial expression recognition.  Large database of vocal variations.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**  Ensure all audio and video data is securely stored and anonymized. Obtain explicit consent from both the agent and the customer.
