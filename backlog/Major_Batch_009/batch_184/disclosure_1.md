## Adaptive Cross-Domain Communication with Contextual Data Injection

**Concept:** Extend the cross-domain communication established via the iframe bridge to include adaptive data injection based on real-time contextual information of *both* the target and child windows. This allows for dynamic message construction, richer data transfer, and potential for proactive data pre-filling, enhancing user experience and streamlining interactions.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Contextual Data Collection Module (CDCM):** 
    *   Each window (target & child) implements a CDCM.
    *   CDCM collects data points relevant to the transaction/interaction. Example data points:
        *   User geolocation (with permission).
        *   Device type & screen size.
        *   Current URL/Page context.
        *   User input history within the window.
        *   Transaction stage (e.g., address entry, payment confirmation).
        *   Time since last activity.
    *   Data is stored locally within the CDCM and accessible via a defined API.  Data is NOT transmitted directly unless explicitly requested.
2.  **Adaptive Message Constructor (AMC):**
    *   Resides within the target window.
    *   The AMC is triggered by user actions or system events.
    *   It defines ‘message profiles’ – templates for messages sent across the iframe bridge. Each profile specifies:
        *   A base message structure (e.g., ‘request_address_data’).
        *   Data injection points – placeholders within the base message.
        *   Data source – specifies from which CDCM (target or child) to retrieve data for each injection point.
    *   The AMC dynamically populates the message based on the selected profile and data retrieved from the specified CDCMs.
3.  **Iframe Bridge Enhancement:**
    *   The existing iframe bridge is augmented to support:
        *   A ‘metadata’ field within messages – carrying information about the message profile used and data sources accessed.
        *   A callback mechanism – allowing the receiving window to validate the message and potentially request additional data.
4.  **Communication Flow:**
    *   Target window triggers an action (e.g., user clicks ‘continue’ on address form).
    *   Target window’s AMC selects a message profile (e.g., ‘request_shipping_address’).
    *   AMC retrieves necessary data from its own CDCM and the child window’s CDCM (via iframe bridge).
    *   AMC constructs the message with the injected data.
    *   Message is sent via the enhanced iframe bridge.
    *   Child window receives the message, validates it (using metadata), and potentially requests additional data if needed.
5.  **Pseudocode (Target Window - AMC):**

```pseudocode
function constructMessage(action, profileName):
  profile = getProfile(profileName) //Load Profile Data
  message = profile.baseMessage

  for each injectionPoint in profile.injectionPoints:
    source = injectionPoint.source // 'target' or 'child'
    dataKey = injectionPoint.dataKey

    if source == 'target':
      data = getContextData(dataKey) // Retrieve from Target CDCM
    else:
      requestData = {key: dataKey}
      responseData = requestDataFromChildWindow(requestData) // Request data via iframe
      data = responseData[dataKey]

    message = replacePlaceholder(message, injectionPoint.placeholder, data)

  message.metadata = {profileName: profileName, source: source} //Add Metadata

  return message
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Proactive Form Filling:** Pre-populate forms in the child window with known data from the target window (e.g., name, email).
*   **Personalized Offers:** Dynamically display customized offers in the child window based on the user’s browsing history or purchase data.
*   **Contextual Support:** Provide relevant help or guidance in the child window based on the user’s current task.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Use contextual data to verify the authenticity of messages and prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
