## Dynamic Code Attestation via Hardware-Bound Randomness

**Concept:** Leverage a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) and hardware-bound randomness to dynamically attest code integrity *during* runtime, moving beyond static pre-execution checks. This creates a continuously verified execution environment.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware Requirement:** A system with a TEE (e.g., Intel SGX, AMD SEV) and a True Random Number Generator (TRNG). The TRNG *must* be accessible from within the TEE.
*   **Software Component: Integrity Beacon:** A small piece of code running *solely* within the TEE. It’s responsible for generating and managing attestations.
*   **Software Component: Code Instrumentation Agent:** An agent integrated into the compilation/linking process, or dynamically injected at runtime (carefully, to avoid compromising security).
*   **Attestation Protocol:** A remote attestation service (could be cloud-based) that verifies the integrity beacon and code signatures.
*   **Runtime Operation:**

    1.  **Code Segmentation:** The instrumentation agent divides the executable into small, functionally cohesive “code segments.”
    2.  **Segment Hashing:**  As each code segment is about to be executed, the agent calculates a cryptographic hash of that segment’s memory region.
    3.  **Random Nonce Generation:** The Integrity Beacon, using the TRNG, generates a unique, random nonce for *each* code segment execution. This nonce is crucial to prevent replay attacks.
    4.  **Signed Attestation Request:** The Integrity Beacon combines the code segment hash, the nonce, and a timestamp. This data is cryptographically signed using a key provisioned within the TEE.
    5.  **Remote Attestation:** The signed attestation request is sent to a remote attestation service.
    6.  **Verification & Execution Permission:**  The remote attestation service verifies the signature, confirms the integrity beacon’s authenticity, and checks if the hash matches the expected value for that code segment. Upon successful verification, a permission token is returned to the main execution environment.
    7.  **Conditional Execution:** The main execution environment only allows the code segment to execute if a valid permission token is received.
    8.  **Continuous Monitoring:** This process is repeated for *every* code segment execution, creating a continuous runtime integrity check.

**Pseudocode (Integrity Beacon):**

```pseudocode
function verify_and_execute_segment(segment_address, segment_size):
  random_nonce = TRNG.generate_random_number()
  segment_hash = hash(memory[segment_address:segment_address + segment_size])
  attestation_data = {
    "segment_hash": segment_hash,
    "nonce": random_nonce,
    "timestamp": current_time()
  }
  signed_attestation = sign(attestation_data, tee_private_key)
  attestation_response = send_attestation_request(signed_attestation)

  if attestation_response.status == "verified":
    return True # Allow execution
  else:
    return False # Prevent execution
```

**Innovation:**

This system significantly strengthens code integrity by moving beyond static pre-execution checks. The use of hardware-bound randomness and continuous runtime attestation makes it far more resistant to sophisticated attacks. Because the attestation is done *during* execution, any malicious modifications to code are detected immediately, before they can cause harm. The constant stream of attestations provides an audit trail, enhancing accountability and providing valuable forensic data. It shifts from 'trust but verify' to 'continuously verify'.
