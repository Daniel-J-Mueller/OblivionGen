## Dynamic Confidence Weighting via Federated Learning

**Concept:** Expand the confidence scoring beyond device-local data. Leverage federated learning to create a globally-informed confidence model, weighted by user-specified privacy preferences.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A federated learning (FL) module integrated into the progressive authorization system.
*   **Data Sources:** Anonymized identifying information (biometrics, location, device ID) from user devices *with explicit consent*.  Crucially, users define a 'privacy budget' â€“ a weighting factor determining how much their data contributes to the global model. Higher budgets mean stronger contributions, but potentially reduced privacy.
*   **Model Architecture:**  A central server hosts a global confidence model (e.g., a neural network). Each user device runs a local version of this model, trained on their own data *and* updated with parameters from the global model.
*   **Training Process:**
    1.  Central server distributes the current global model to participating devices.
    2.  Each device trains the model *locally* using their anonymized identifying information and their privacy budget.
    3.  Devices send *only model updates* (gradients) back to the central server. Raw data *never* leaves the device.
    4.  The central server aggregates the model updates (e.g., using federated averaging) to improve the global model.
    5.  Repeat steps 2-4 periodically.
*   **Confidence Calculation:**  The confidence score for a user is calculated by combining:
    1.  The output of the globally-trained FL model.
    2.  Device-local confidence based on the patent's existing method.
    3.  The user's privacy budget as a weighting factor.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/register_privacy_budget` (POST):  Allows users to set their privacy budget (0-100).
    *   `/get_confidence_score` (POST):  Returns the confidence score for a user, given identifying information.
    *   `/update_global_model` (Internal):  Triggered by the central server to update the FL model on devices.

**Pseudocode (Confidence Score Calculation):**

```
function calculate_confidence(user_id, identifying_info) {
  // Get user's privacy budget
  privacy_budget = get_user_privacy_budget(user_id);

  // Calculate device-local confidence (from existing patent method)
  local_confidence = calculate_local_confidence(identifying_info);

  // Get confidence from federated learning model
  fl_confidence = get_fl_confidence(user_id, identifying_info);

  // Weighted average of local and FL confidence
  confidence = (local_confidence * (1 - privacy_budget/100)) + (fl_confidence * (privacy_budget/100));

  return confidence;
}
```

**Innovation:**  This extends the static, device-bound confidence model of the original patent to a dynamic, globally-informed system that respects user privacy. Users have granular control over how their data contributes to the confidence calculation, enabling a balance between security and privacy. This also allows the system to adapt to evolving threats and user behaviors more effectively.
