## Acoustic Mapping & Personalized Spatial Audio for Conferencing

**Concept:** Extend the locale-based aggregation to incorporate real-time acoustic mapping of the shared physical space and deliver personalized spatial audio to each participant, enhancing presence and clarity.

**Specs:**

**1. Acoustic Mapping Module:**

*   **Hardware:** Array of miniature, low-power microphones distributed within the shared locale (e.g., integrated into ceiling fixtures, wall-mounted units). Minimum density: 1 microphone per 50 sq ft.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Beamforming:** Implement adaptive beamforming algorithms to identify and isolate individual speakers within the locale.
    *   **Sound Source Localization:** Utilize Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) and/or Angle of Arrival (AOA) techniques to pinpoint the precise 3D location of each speaker.
    *   **Reverberation Mapping:** Analyze reflected sound waves to create a dynamic map of the room’s acoustic properties.
    *   **Noise Cancellation:**  Adaptive filtering to remove ambient noise and improve signal-to-noise ratio.
    *   **Data Fusion:** Combine data from all microphones to create a comprehensive acoustic map updated in real-time (minimum 10Hz refresh rate).

**2. Spatial Audio Rendering Module:**

*   **Input:** Acoustic map data, individual speaker audio streams, listener positions (obtained from client devices – headphone tracking, webcam head pose estimation).
*   **Processing:**
    *   **Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) Customization:**  Utilize pre-computed or learned HRTFs to simulate how sound waves interact with the listener’s head and ears. Personalized HRTFs could be learned via brief calibration exercises on the client device.
    *   **3D Audio Scene Reconstruction:** Reconstruct the audio scene based on speaker locations and acoustic map data.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering Engine:**  Render individual audio streams with appropriate spatial cues (pan, distance attenuation, Doppler effect) to simulate realistic sound localization.
    *   **Dynamic Mixing:**  Adjust audio levels and spatialization parameters dynamically based on speaker activity and listener positions.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Local Aggregation Node:** Dedicated device within the shared locale responsible for acoustic mapping and initial audio processing. Can be a dedicated hardware appliance or software running on a powerful local server.
*   **Cloud-Based Mixing:** Cloud server receives processed audio streams from multiple local aggregation nodes and performs final mixing and distribution to all participants.
*   **Client-Side Rendering:** Client devices receive spatial audio streams and render them using built-in or dedicated audio processing libraries.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Low-latency, high-bandwidth communication protocol (e.g., WebRTC, Dante) for transmitting audio data between local aggregation nodes, cloud server, and client devices.

**4. Pseudocode (Local Aggregation Node):**

```
// Initialize Microphone Array and Audio Processing Libraries

LOOP:
    // Capture Audio from Microphone Array
    audio_data = CaptureAudio()

    // Perform Beamforming and Sound Source Localization
    speaker_locations = LocateSpeakers(audio_data)

    // Estimate Room Acoustics
    room_acoustics = EstimateRoomAcoustics(audio_data)

    // Separate Individual Speaker Streams
    speaker_streams = SeparateSpeakerStreams(audio_data, speaker_locations)

    // Apply Noise Cancellation
    cleaned_streams = ApplyNoiseCancellation(speaker_streams)

    // Encode and Transmit Audio Streams to Cloud Server
    TransmitAudioStreams(cleaned_streams, speaker_locations, room_acoustics)
ENDLOOP
```

**5.  Advanced Features:**

*   **Automatic Room Calibration:** Automated process for calibrating the acoustic mapping system based on room geometry and acoustic properties.
*   **Virtual Room Modeling:**  Creation of a virtual 3D model of the shared locale for enhanced acoustic simulation.
*   **Adaptive Localization:**  Automatic adjustment of speaker localization algorithms based on ambient noise and room acoustics.
*   **AI-Powered Speaker Identification:** Utilize AI models to identify individual speakers based on voice characteristics.
*   **Multi-Locale Integration:** Seamless integration with multiple local aggregation nodes to create a truly immersive and realistic conferencing experience.
