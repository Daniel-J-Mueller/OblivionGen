## Dynamic Vectorization with Semantic Understanding

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple raster-to-vector conversion to incorporate semantic understanding of image content, enabling intelligent vectorization that preserves not just visual appearance, but also underlying meaning and editability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Module: Semantic Image Parser (SIP)**

*   **Input:** Raster Graphics (RG) Image
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a pre-trained Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) for object detection and classification within the RG image. This DCNN will be trained on a vast dataset of graphical elements (equations, diagrams, charts, custom fonts, etc.).
    *   Output a semantic map: a data structure representing the image as a collection of identified objects and their relationships (e.g., "equation consisting of 'x', 'y', '+', '='"; "chart with axis labels 'Time' and 'Value'").
*   **Output:** Semantic Map (JSON or similar format).

**2. Vectorization Engine (VE)**

*   **Input:** RG Image, Semantic Map
*   **Process:**
    *   Utilize the Semantic Map to guide the vectorization process. Instead of blindly tracing edges, the VE will:
        *   Recognize and vectorize equations using dedicated equation rendering algorithms. Variable names and symbols will be represented as editable text elements.
        *   Identify chart elements (axes, bars, lines) and recreate them as scalable vector graphics. Axis labels will be vectorized text.
        *   Render custom fonts as vector paths, ensuring accurate representation of unique glyphs.
        *   Segment the image into logical units (e.g., a single equation, a chart section) for easier manipulation.
*   **Output:** Vector Graphics (VG) Image, Metadata (semantic information, segment boundaries).

**3.  Dynamic Reflow & Adaptation Module (DRAM)**

*   **Input:** VG Image, Metadata, Target Display Dimensions, Content Flow Specifications.
*   **Process:**
    *   Based on the target display dimensions and content flow specifications (e.g., column width, font size), the DRAM will intelligently reflow and adapt the VG image.
    *   For equations, the DRAM can dynamically adjust equation spacing and line breaks to fit within the available space.
    *   For charts, the DRAM can scale chart elements and adjust axis labels to maintain visual clarity.
    *   Content reflow will consider semantic relationships to maintain meaningful structure.
*   **Output:** Reflowed and Adapted VG Image.

**4. Pseudocode for DRAM (Reflow Equation Example)**

```
function reflowEquation(equationVG, targetWidth) {
  equationSegments = getEquationSegments(equationVG);
  currentWidth = 0;
  lines = [];
  currentLine = [];

  for (segment in equationSegments) {
    segmentWidth = getSegmentWidth(segment);

    if (currentWidth + segmentWidth <= targetWidth) {
      currentLine.push(segment);
      currentWidth += segmentWidth;
    } else {
      lines.push(currentLine);
      currentLine = [segment];
      currentWidth = segmentWidth;
    }
  }
  lines.push(currentLine);

  // Reconstruct the VG image with the new line breaks
  reconstructVG(lines);
  return reconstructedVG;
}
```

**5. Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Semantic Image Parser and Vectorization Engine will replace the existing raster-to-vector conversion step.
*   The Dynamic Reflow & Adaptation Module will be integrated with the viewing deviceâ€™s rendering pipeline.

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond simple image conversion to semantic understanding and dynamic adaptation, enabling truly intelligent and flexible rendering of text-based images. This system isn't just about *displaying* an image; it's about *understanding* its content and *adapting* it to fit the user's needs.
