## Adaptive Lock Screen "Contextual Glances"

**Concept:** Expand the lock screen beyond simple recommended content to provide dynamic, contextually relevant "glances" of information *before* full unlock, driven by predictive AI and user behavioral patterns.  These glances aren’t just notifications, but actively anticipated information.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Existing fingerprint scanner.
*   Ambient light sensor (existing or upgraded).
*   Optional: Low-power proximity sensor (to initiate glance preparation).
*   Sufficient processing power for predictive AI model (edge processing preferred).

**Software Specifications:**

1.  **Behavioral Data Collection:**
    *   Track app usage patterns (time of day, location, frequency).
    *   Monitor sensor data (motion, ambient light, time).
    *   Calendar integration (upcoming events).
    *   Communication monitoring (with user permission - SMS, email subject lines - for travel confirmations etc.).
    *   Web browsing history (with user permission - for anticipated needs).

2.  **Predictive AI Model:**
    *   Train a machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network or transformer) to predict the user's likely next action or information need.
    *   Model outputs a ranked list of “glance cards” – concise information displays.
    *   Model dynamically adjusts based on user interactions (dismissals, selections, time spent viewing).

3.  **Glance Card Design:**
    *   Cards are visually distinct and prioritize legibility.
    *   Card types:
        *   **Travel:** Flight/train status, gate information, traffic to airport.
        *   **Calendar:** Upcoming event details, location, attendees.
        *   **Communication:** Preview of recent messages/emails (sender, subject).
        *   **News/Finance:** Personalized headline/stock ticker updates.
        *   **Smart Home:** Control options for frequently used devices (lights, thermostat).
        *   **Task Management:** Reminders, to-do list items.

4.  **Lock Screen Integration:**
    *   Upon wake event, the system predicts the most relevant glance cards.
    *   The lock screen displays a carousel of these cards, initially showing the top prediction.
    *   The user can swipe horizontally to browse other predictions.
    *   A fingerprint scan unlocks the device while the currently displayed card remains briefly visible.

5.  **Adaptive Countdown:**
    *   The countdown timer (as in the original patent) is *dynamically adjusted* based on the complexity of the displayed glance card. Simple cards (e.g., time/date) have shorter countdowns. Complex cards (e.g., travel itinerary) have longer countdowns.
    *   This prevents the user from being "locked out" of critical information while waiting for the timer to expire.

6. **Privacy Considerations**
    * All data collection will be opt-in, with transparent user controls.
    * Data will be processed locally on the device whenever possible.
    * Anonymized usage data can be used to improve the model.

**Pseudocode (Glance Card Prediction):**

```
function predictGlanceCards(userBehaviorData, sensorData, calendarData, communicationData):
    // Train ML model with historical data
    model = trainModel(historicalData)

    // Generate feature vector from current data
    features = createFeatureVector(userBehaviorData, sensorData, calendarData, communicationData)

    // Predict relevance scores for each glance card type
    scores = model.predict(features)

    // Rank cards based on scores
    rankedCards = sortCards(scores)

    // Return top N cards
    return rankedCards
```
