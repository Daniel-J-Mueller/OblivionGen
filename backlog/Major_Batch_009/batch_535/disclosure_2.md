## Time-Series Event Horizon Prediction

**Concept:** Extend continuous function generation to *predict* potential event horizons within the time-series data, proactively flagging regions of high uncertainty or potential anomaly emergence *before* they fully manifest as discrete data points.

**Specification:**

1.  **Horizon Function Generation:**
    *   Alongside the standard continuous function (regression-based), generate a secondary "Horizon Function."
    *   The Horizon Function is based on a *divergence metric* calculated from multiple regression models applied to the loaded data points within the time range. (e.g., standard linear regression, polynomial regression, exponential smoothing).
    *   Divergence is calculated as the standard deviation of the predictions made by these diverse models. High divergence = high uncertainty = potential event horizon.
    *   The Horizon Function outputs a "Uncertainty Score" at each point in time within the specified range.

2.  **Adaptive Granularity:**
    *   Implement a system where the granularity of the regression applied for both the primary Continuous Function *and* the Horizon Function adapts based on the Uncertainty Score.
    *   If the Uncertainty Score exceeds a threshold, *increase* the regression granularity (e.g., use a higher-degree polynomial, shorter smoothing windows) to capture more subtle shifts in the data.
    *   If the Uncertainty Score is low, *decrease* granularity for computational efficiency.

3.  **Proactive Alerting:**
    *   Establish configurable thresholds on the Uncertainty Score.
    *   When the Uncertainty Score exceeds these thresholds, generate a proactive alert indicating a potential event horizon.
    *   Alerts include metadata: time range of the horizon, severity level based on the Uncertainty Score, and a visual representation of the predicted horizon overlaid on the time-series data.

4.  **Pseudocode - Horizon Function Generation:**

```
function generateHorizonFunction(dataPoints, conversionParameters):
    models = []
    models.append(linearRegression(dataPoints))
    models.append(polynomialRegression(dataPoints, degree=2))
    models.append(exponentialSmoothing(dataPoints, alpha=0.2))

    predictions = []
    for model in models:
        predictions.append(model.predict(dataPoints))

    stdDevs = []
    for i in range(len(dataPoints)):
        deviation = 0
        for j in range(len(predictions)):
            deviation += (predictions[j][i] - predictions[0][i])**2
        stdDevs.append(math.sqrt(deviation / len(predictions)))
    
    return stdDevs
```

5.  **Integration with Existing System:** The Horizon Function operates *in parallel* with the existing Continuous Function generation. The results of both are combined and returned to the client. The client application displays both the Continuous Function (representing the current state) and the Horizon Function (representing the potential future state).
