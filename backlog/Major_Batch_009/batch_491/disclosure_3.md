## Adaptive Resonance Field for Drone Swarm Cohesion & Obstacle Avoidance

**Concept:** Expand the capacitive proximity sensing beyond individual drone safety to create a localized “resonance field” for cohesive swarm behavior and enhanced obstacle avoidance. Instead of simply *reacting* to proximity, drones actively modulate their capacitive fields, creating a shared awareness space.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Each drone equipped with an array of capacitive sensors, distributed across the exterior housing (similar to existing patent, but denser and more widespread). Sensors operate at multiple frequencies to differentiate object type/material.
*   **Field Modulation:** Drones continuously emit low-intensity capacitive fields. These fields are not static – they modulate in frequency and amplitude.
*   **Inter-Drone Communication:** Drones utilize the *changes* in received capacitive fields from neighboring drones as primary communication. Data is not transmitted via radio, but *implied* through field distortion.
*   **Swarm Cohesion Algorithm:**
    *   Each drone maintains a “cohesion vector” – a direction and strength indicating optimal position relative to the swarm center (calculated from field distortions).
    *   If a drone’s cohesion vector deviates significantly (due to drift or external forces), it adjusts its motor output to realign.
    *   The algorithm prioritizes maintaining consistent field *gradients* – drones actively move to create a smooth, predictable field across the swarm.
*   **Obstacle Detection/Avoidance:**
    *   Changes in received field *patterns* indicate obstacles. Obstacles disrupt the expected field gradients.
    *   Algorithm calculates obstacle size, shape, and trajectory based on field distortion.
    *   Drones dynamically adjust their positions to create a “void” in the field around the obstacle, effectively guiding the swarm around it.
*   **Multi-Frequency Analysis:**
    *   Different materials will have different dielectric properties.
    *   Assign frequency bands to material types.
    *   Enable filtering, and differentiation of objects.
*   **Pseudocode (Swarm Cohesion):**

```
// Drone i
while (true) {
    // Read capacitive field data from surrounding drones
    fieldData = readFieldData();

    // Calculate expected field gradient based on swarm center
    expectedGradient = calculateExpectedGradient(swarmCenter);

    // Calculate deviation from expected gradient
    deviation = calculateDeviation(fieldData, expectedGradient);

    // If deviation exceeds threshold
    if (abs(deviation) > threshold) {
        // Calculate motor adjustments to reduce deviation
        motorAdjustments = calculateMotorAdjustments(deviation);

        // Apply motor adjustments
        applyMotorAdjustments(motorAdjustments);
    }
}
```

*   **Materials:** Existing drone materials + high-dielectric constant polymers for sensor construction. Flexible PCB construction for sensor arrays.
*   **Power:** Minimal additional power requirements – capacitive sensing inherently low-power.
*   **Scalability:** Algorithm designed to scale effectively with increasing swarm size.
*   **Potential Applications:** Search and Rescue, Environmental Monitoring, Infrastructure Inspection, Coordinated Delivery.
