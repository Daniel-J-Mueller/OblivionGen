## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the AEC system to not just *cancel* unwanted audio, but to *reconstruct* a desired acoustic scene independent of the capture environment. This is achieved by learning to separate not just speech/echo, but *all* constituent sound events – footsteps, keyboard clicks, door slams – and then selectively recombine them.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Microphone array data, playback audio data.
*   **Core Module:** A multi-headed deep neural network (MH-DNN). The first head performs standard AEC (as in the provided patent). Subsequent heads are trained to identify and isolate individual sound events.
*   **Sound Event Database:** A large, labeled database of diverse acoustic scenes and individual sound events is essential. This database fuels the MH-DNN’s training. The database will be constantly growing, curated by users, and verified through a quality control system.
*   **Scene Descriptor:** A user-definable scene descriptor allows users to specify the desired acoustic scene (e.g., "quiet office," "busy cafe," "concert hall"). This descriptor acts as a conditioning signal for the MH-DNN.
*   **Event Masking:** The MH-DNN generates masks for each identified sound event. These masks control the amplitude and frequency content of each event, allowing selective attenuation or amplification.
*   **Spatial Audio Engine:** A spatial audio engine renders the reconstructed acoustic scene in 3D space, creating a realistic and immersive audio experience. The engine leverages the microphone array data to estimate the location of sound sources.
*   **Output:** Processed audio data representing the reconstructed acoustic scene.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: microphoneData, playbackData, sceneDescriptor

// 1. Standard AEC (as in provided patent)
aecOutput = performAEC(microphoneData, playbackData)

// 2. Sound Event Identification & Isolation
identifiedEvents = identifySoundEvents(aecOutput) // Returns a list of events (e.g., speech, footsteps, keyboard clicks)
eventMasks = generateEventMasks(identifiedEvents, sceneDescriptor) // Based on scene descriptor

// 3. Event Reconstruction
reconstructedAudio = 0
for each event in identifiedEvents:
    eventAudio = isolateEventAudio(event, eventMasks)
    reconstructedAudio += eventAudio

// 4. Spatial Audio Rendering
finalAudio = renderSpatialAudio(reconstructedAudio, microphoneData)

// Output: finalAudio
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond simple echo cancellation towards active acoustic scene control. Users don't just eliminate unwanted sounds; they *choose* the acoustic environment they want. The system can create a 'virtual' acoustic space independent of the physical environment.
