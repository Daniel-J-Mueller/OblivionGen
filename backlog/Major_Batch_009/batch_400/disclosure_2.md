## Virtual Machine Communication Orchestration via Predictive Policy Adjustment

**Concept:** Enhance the communication management system by introducing predictive policy adjustments based on observed communication patterns *between* virtual machines. Instead of solely relying on static or manually modified access policies, the system learns typical communication flows and dynamically adjusts policies to optimize performance and security.

**Specs:**

**1. Communication Pattern Observer (CPO):**

*   **Function:** Monitors inter-VM communication on the physical computing system.
*   **Data Collected:**
    *   Source VM ID
    *   Destination VM ID
    *   Port Numbers Used
    *   Communication Protocol
    *   Data Transfer Volume
    *   Timestamp
*   **Output:**  Time-series data representing communication patterns.  Data is aggregated into ‘communication signatures’ – representative patterns of interaction.

**2. Predictive Policy Engine (PPE):**

*   **Input:** Communication signatures from the CPO, current access policies.
*   **Algorithm:** A machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, Bayesian Network) trained to predict *future* communication needs based on historical patterns.  The model identifies emerging communication flows that aren’t explicitly covered by the current policies.
*   **Output:**  Policy adjustment recommendations – suggested modifications to access control lists (ACLs) for VMs. These recommendations include:
    *   Adding new source/destination pairings.
    *   Opening new ports.
    *   Allowing specific protocols.
    *   Adjusting data transfer limits.
*   **Risk Assessment:** Integrates a risk assessment module.  Policy adjustments are flagged based on potential security implications.  High-risk adjustments require human review.

**3. Policy Orchestration Service (POS):**

*   **Input:** Policy adjustment recommendations from the PPE.
*   **Function:** Manages the application of policy adjustments.
    *   **Automatic Adjustment:** Low-risk adjustments are applied automatically.
    *   **Human Review:** High-risk adjustments are presented to an administrator for approval.
    *   **Rollback Mechanism:**  A mechanism to revert to previous policies if an adjustment causes issues.
*   **Integration:**  Integrates with the existing transmission manager component to enforce the dynamically adjusted policies.

**Pseudocode (PPE - Policy Prediction):**

```
function predict_policy_changes(communication_signatures, current_policies):
  // Train ML model on historical communication signatures
  model = train_model(communication_signatures)

  // Predict future communication needs
  predicted_communication = model.predict(latest_communication_data)

  // Calculate policy adjustments
  policy_changes = calculate_policy_diff(current_policies, predicted_communication)

  // Assess risk of changes
  risk_level = assess_risk(policy_changes)

  // Return policy changes with risk level
  return policy_changes, risk_level
```

**Novelty:**  The core innovation lies in the *proactive* adjustment of communication policies based on observed patterns, rather than solely relying on static configurations or manual interventions. This allows the system to adapt to changing application needs and optimize performance and security dynamically. It moves beyond the typical static policy management described in the patent towards a dynamic, learning-based approach.
