## Dynamic Impression Prioritization with Predictive User Gaze

**Concept:** Extend the bid placement system to dynamically prioritize ad impressions based on *predicted* user gaze direction on a display. This anticipates where a user is *likely* to look, optimizing ad placement not just for position (above/below fold, etc.) but for actual visual engagement.

**Specs:**

1.  **Gaze Prediction Module:**
    *   Integrate a lightweight, real-time gaze prediction model. This could utilize:
        *   **Hardware Integration:** Leverage eye-tracking hardware where available (built-in laptop cameras, VR/AR headsets).
        *   **Software-Based Prediction:** Implement a model trained on user behavior data (mouse movements, scrolling speed, dwell time on content) to predict gaze direction. This requires a substantial dataset and ongoing learning.
    *   Output: Probability map indicating the likelihood of a user looking at specific areas of the display. Resolution: Matching or finer than the rendered UI element.
2.  **Bid Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   Modify the bid acceptance and positioning algorithm to incorporate gaze prediction data.
    *   `adjusted_bid_score = original_bid_score + (gaze_prediction_score * gaze_weight)`
        *   `gaze_prediction_score`: Derived from the gaze prediction moduleâ€™s probability map. Higher score for ads falling within areas of high gaze probability. Normalized between 0-1.
        *   `gaze_weight`: Adjustable parameter controlling the influence of gaze prediction on bid score.
    *   Prioritize bids with higher adjusted scores during ad selection.
3.  **Dynamic UI Layout Adjustment:**
    *   Based on the predicted gaze direction and accepted bids, dynamically adjust the UI layout to optimize ad visibility.
    *   **Proactive Expansion:** If a high-value ad is predicted to fall within a low-visibility area, subtly expand the UI element containing the ad (e.g., increase the width of a sidebar) to improve its prominence. This expansion should be minimal and not disrupt the overall user experience.
    *   **Subtle Animation:** Use subtle animations (e.g., gentle scaling, color shifting) to draw the user's attention to high-value ads predicted to be within their gaze path. The animation should be non-intrusive and visually appealing.
4.  **Data Collection & Model Training:**
    *   Collect anonymized data on user gaze direction, ad impressions, click-through rates, and other relevant metrics.
    *   Use this data to continuously train and refine the gaze prediction model and the bid adjustment algorithm.
    *   Employ A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies and parameters.

**Pseudocode (Bid Adjustment):**

```
function adjust_bid(bid_score, ad_position, gaze_probability_map, gaze_weight):
  # ad_position: (x, y) coordinates of the ad on the screen
  # gaze_probability_map: 2D array representing gaze probability
  # gaze_weight: weight factor for gaze prediction

  gaze_prediction_score = gaze_probability_map[ad_position.x][ad_position.y]
  adjusted_bid_score = bid_score + (gaze_prediction_score * gaze_weight)
  return adjusted_bid_score

function select_ads(list_of_bids, gaze_probability_map, gaze_weight, size_limitation):
  # Filter bids based on size limitation (as in original patent)
  filtered_bids = ...
  # Calculate adjusted bid scores for each bid
  adjusted_bids = []
  for bid in filtered_bids:
    adjusted_score = adjust_bid(bid.score, bid.position, gaze_probability_map, gaze_weight)
    adjusted_bids.append((bid, adjusted_score))
  # Sort bids by adjusted score (descending)
  sorted_bids = sorted(adjusted_bids, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
  # Select top N bids that fit within size limitation
  selected_ads = []
  current_size = 0
  for bid, score in sorted_bids:
    if current_size + bid.size <= size_limitation:
      selected_ads.append(bid)
      current_size += bid.size
    else:
      break
  return selected_ads
```

This system goes beyond simply *where* an ad is placed to proactively optimize ad visibility based on where a user is *likely* to look. The dynamic UI adjustments and ongoing model training ensure that the system adapts to individual user behavior and maximizes ad engagement.
