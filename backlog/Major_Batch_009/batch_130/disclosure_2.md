## Acoustic Holography for Dynamic Room Correction

**Concept:** Extend the acoustic modeling from the patent to create a real-time, dynamic room correction system using acoustic holography. Instead of *simulating* a room for analysis, we'll *actively map* and correct the room's acoustic response on the fly.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Array:** Utilize a dense array of miniature microphones (MEMS based) strategically positioned within the listening space. Minimum density: 1 microphone per 1 cubic meter.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance embedded system (GPU accelerated) capable of processing audio from the sensor array in real-time.
*   **Acoustic Holography Algorithm:** Implement an algorithm that reconstructs the sound field within the room based on the data captured by the microphone array. This leverages principles of wavefield synthesis and beamforming. The core of this algorithm will be a sparse representation of the sound field using spherical harmonic decomposition.
*   **Dynamic Room Impulse Response (DRIR) Calculation:**  From the reconstructed sound field, calculate a DRIR for each point in the listening space. Unlike the static impulse responses in the patent, this will *change* with sound source location and listener position.
*   **Active Correction System:**  Employ an array of digitally controlled loudspeakers distributed throughout the room. These loudspeakers will generate anti-phase signals based on the calculated DRIR to actively cancel out unwanted reflections and create a ‘clean’ sound field.
*   **Real-Time Tracking:** Integrate a tracking system (camera or ultrasonic sensors) to determine the location of the sound source and listener in real-time. This data is fed into the DRIR calculation to ensure accurate correction.
*   **Adaptive Filtering:** Implement an adaptive filtering algorithm to adjust the correction signals based on the current acoustic environment. This will compensate for changes in room conditions (e.g., doors opening/closing, people moving).

**Pseudocode (DRIR Calculation & Correction):**

```
// Inputs: Microphone array data (micData), Source location (sourceLoc),
// Listener location (listenerLoc), Room geometry (roomGeo)

// 1. Wavefield Reconstruction (Acoustic Holography)
reconstructedWavefield = AcousticHolography(micData, roomGeo)

// 2. DRIR Calculation
drir = CalculateDRIR(reconstructedWavefield, sourceLoc, listenerLoc)

// 3. Correction Signal Generation
correctionSignal = GenerateCorrectionSignal(drir)

// 4. Playback Correction Signal
PlaybackCorrectionSignal(correctionSignal)
```

**Innovation Details:**

*   **Moving Beyond Simulation:** The patent simulates acoustic behavior. This moves towards *actively* controlling it.
*   **Dynamic Correction:** The system adapts to changing room conditions and sound source/listener locations in real-time.
*   **Localized Control:**  The distributed loudspeaker array allows for precise control of the sound field, creating sweet spots and minimizing reflections in specific areas.
*   **Spherical Harmonic Decomposition:**  Using spherical harmonics for wavefield reconstruction offers computational efficiency and accurate representation of complex sound fields.
