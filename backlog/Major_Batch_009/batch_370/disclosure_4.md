**Dynamic Palette Morphing via Temporal Image Sequences**

**Concept:** Expand the color palette generation beyond a single static image to leverage sequences of images (video, animated GIFs, or a series of related photographs). This allows for palettes that *evolve* over time, reflecting changes in lighting, scene content, or artistic intent.

**Specs:**

1.  **Input:** A temporal image sequence (e.g., a video file, a series of JPEG images). Sequence length is configurable.
2.  **Preprocessing:**
    *   Frame Sampling: The sequence is sampled at a configurable rate (frames per second or interval). Higher rates yield smoother transitions, lower rates produce more drastic shifts.
    *   Keyframe Extraction: An algorithm identifies keyframes representing significant color changes.  Options:
        *   Histogram Difference: Measure the difference between histograms of consecutive frames.
        *   Optical Flow Analysis: Detect motion and color changes simultaneously.
        *   User-defined intervals.
3.  **Palette Generation (Per Keyframe):**
    *   Utilize the core palette generation algorithm from the referenced patent (representative color selection, weighting based on collective measures).
    *   Output: A series of palettes, one per keyframe.  Each palette includes:
        *   Representative Colors (RGB or other color space).
        *   Color Weights.
        *   Timestamp/Frame Number (identifying the palette's origin in the sequence).
4.  **Palette Interpolation:**
    *   Algorithm: Linear interpolation, cubic spline interpolation, or more sophisticated methods (e.g., using optical flow data to guide the transitions).
    *   Input: The series of generated palettes and the desired transition speed.
    *   Output: A dynamic color palette that smoothly morphs between the keyframe palettes over time.
5.  **Output:**
    *   Palette Data: A data structure representing the dynamic palette (e.g., a sequence of RGB colors and weights at specific time intervals).
    *   Visualization: An optional visualization tool to preview the palette morphing in real-time.
    *   Export Formats: Standard palette formats (e.g., Adobe Swatch Exchange (.ase), GIMP Palette (.gpl)).

**Pseudocode (Palette Interpolation):**

```
function interpolate_palette(palette1, palette2, time_ratio):
  // time_ratio is between 0 and 1, representing the interpolation point
  interpolated_palette = []
  for i in range(length(palette1)):  // Assuming palette1 and palette2 have the same number of colors
    color1 = palette1[i]
    color2 = palette2[i]
    // Linear interpolation for each color component (R, G, B)
    r = color1.r * (1 - time_ratio) + color2.r * time_ratio
    g = color1.g * (1 - time_ratio) + color2.g * time_ratio
    b = color1.b * (1 - time_ratio) + color2.b * time_ratio
    interpolated_color = Color(r, g, b)
    interpolated_palette.append(interpolated_color)
  return interpolated_palette
```

**Possible Applications:**

*   Dynamic website themes.
*   Animated color schemes for user interfaces.
*   Video editing and color grading tools.
*   Generative art and visual effects.
*   Real-time color adaptation in augmented reality applications.
