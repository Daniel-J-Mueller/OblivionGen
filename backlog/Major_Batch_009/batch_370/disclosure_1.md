## Dynamic Metadata Injection & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Expand upon the concurrent monitoring capability to proactively inject synthetic or derived metadata *into* the media stream itself *before* transcoding. Simultaneously, employ predictive buffering based on monitored parameters to optimize the shared memory transfer.

**Specifications:**

**1. Metadata Injection Module:**

*   **Input:** Monitored parameters (audio/video format, timecode, volume, resolution, frame rate – as per the patent) *plus* derived data (scene change detection, object recognition via integrated AI – see Section 3).
*   **Processing:**
    *   Scene Change Detection: Real-time analysis of video frames to identify scene transitions.
    *   Object Recognition: Integrate a lightweight AI model to identify key objects within video frames (e.g., faces, vehicles, logos).
    *   Metadata Construction:  Combine monitored parameters and derived data to create a structured metadata packet (e.g., JSON, XML). Include timestamps synchronized with the media stream.
    *   Injection Method:  Embed the metadata packet directly into the media stream.  Options:
        *   **SMPTE Timed Text:** Utilize SMPTE Timed Text format for embedding metadata alongside video.
        *   **Sidecar File Synchronization:** Create a synchronized sidecar file (e.g., JSON) and signal the transcoding process to access it.
        *   **Custom Packetization:** Define a custom packet structure and inject it into reserved areas of the media stream (requires transcoding process support).
*   **Output:** Modified media stream (with embedded metadata) or synchronized sidecar file.

**2. Predictive Buffering System:**

*   **Input:** Monitored parameters (frame rate, bitrate, resolution), current buffer occupancy, transcoding process demand.
*   **Processing:**
    *   Demand Prediction:  Analyze transcoding process history to predict future data requests (based on content type, resolution, etc.).
    *   Buffer Management: Implement a dynamic buffer allocation strategy.  Prioritize allocation for segments anticipated to be in high demand.
    *   Pre-Fetch:  Proactively copy media data from the SDI input into the shared memory buffer *before* it is explicitly requested.
    *   Adaptive Bitrate Adjustment:  If demand cannot be met, dynamically adjust the bitrate of the incoming stream (within acceptable quality limits) to reduce data volume.
*   **Output:** Optimized shared memory buffer with pre-fetched data.

**3. AI Integration (Optional):**

*   Integrate lightweight AI models for:
    *   **Scene Change Detection:** Improves accuracy of scene transition identification.
    *   **Object Recognition:** Enables semantic metadata injection (e.g., “Scene contains a vehicle,” “Face detected at timestamp X”).
    *   **Content Analysis:** Automatically identify content type (e.g., news, sports, movie) and optimize transcoding parameters.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   The Metadata Injection Module and Predictive Buffering System are implemented as separate modules within the ingest process.
*   Communication between modules is via internal queues or shared memory.
*   The AI Integration module is a separate, pluggable component.



**Pseudocode (Predictive Buffering):**

```pseudocode
function predictDemand(history, contentType, resolution):
  # Analyze transcoding history to predict future demand
  # Return predicted data rate (e.g., MB/s)

function manageBuffer(currentOccupancy, predictedRate, incomingRate):
  # Adjust buffer allocation based on predicted demand and incoming data
  # Allocate more space if predicted demand exceeds incoming rate
  # Reduce allocation if incoming rate exceeds predicted demand

function preFetchData(buffer, incomingData, bufferCapacity):
  # Copy incoming data into the buffer
  # Prioritize segments predicted to be in high demand
  # Ensure buffer does not exceed capacity

loop:
  predictedRate = predictDemand(history, contentType, resolution)
  manageBuffer(currentOccupancy, predictedRate, incomingRate)
  preFetchData(buffer, incomingData, bufferCapacity)
  # Monitor buffer occupancy and adjust allocation as needed
```
