## Dynamic Contextual Projection

**Concept:** Augment the contextual launch interface with a localized, projected display element that anticipates user needs *before* gesture input. This moves beyond reactive launching to proactive assistance.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integrated pico-projector embedded within the device (smartphone, tablet, wearable). Optimal placement: top edge, angled slightly upwards.
    *   Ambient light sensor to dynamically adjust projection brightness and contrast.
    *   Optional: Miniature depth sensor (ToF) for projection surface adaptation and gesture recognition within the projected space.
*   **Software – Contextual Engine:**
    *   Leverage existing contextual data (location, time, usage history, app data) – as outlined in the base patent.
    *   Predictive Algorithm: Develop a machine learning model to forecast likely application usage *before* a swipe gesture is initiated. Factors: time since last use, correlation with current activity (e.g., navigating in a car, attending a meeting), scheduled events.
    *   Projection Mapping: Determine optimal projection surface – user’s palm, nearby flat surface (table, desk), or even a temporary “virtual” surface created via the depth sensor.
*   **Software – Projection Interface:**
    *   Dynamic Icons: Project a small set of contextually relevant icons onto the chosen surface. Icon size and layout adapt to surface area.
    *   Proactive Highlighting: Highlight *one* predicted application icon with a subtle animation (pulse, glow). This is the system’s ‘best guess’.
    *   Gesture Integration:
        *   *Direct Tap*:  A tap *on the projected icon* launches the application. This bypasses the need for a swipe.
        *   *Swipe Extension*: A swipe gesture originating *from the projection* (instead of the screen edge) can be used to select an icon and launch the app. This maintains existing gesture familiarity but adds a new dimension.
        *   *Projection Dismissal*: A quick covering gesture (hand over projection) dismisses the projection and reverts to the standard contextual launch interface.
*   **Pseudocode (Contextual Engine – Prediction):**

```
function predict_next_app(context_data) {
  // Retrieve historical usage data (user preferences, time-based patterns, location)
  historical_data = get_historical_data(context_data);

  // Fetch relevant app data (e.g., scheduled events, reminders)
  app_data = get_app_data(context_data);

  // Combine data and apply machine learning model
  prediction_result = ml_model.predict(historical_data, app_data);

  // Return top 3 predicted applications with confidence scores
  return prediction_result.top_3_apps;
}

function update_projection(predicted_apps) {
  // Select primary app (highest confidence score)
  primary_app = predicted_apps[0];

  // Map app icons to projection area
  map_icons_to_projection(primary_app, predicted_apps);

  // Highlight primary icon
  highlight_icon(primary_app);
}
```

**Refinements:**

*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate haptic feedback into the projection surface (if a physical surface is used) to confirm icon selection.
*   **Multi-User Support:** Allow multiple users to register their profiles to the system.
*   **AR Integration:** Augment the projection with augmented reality elements (e.g., contextual information overlaid on the projected icons).
*   **Privacy Mode:** Disable projection functionality for increased privacy.
