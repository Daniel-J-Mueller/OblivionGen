## Adaptive Resource Shadowing & Predictive Rollback

**Concept:** Extend the rollback functionality by creating ‘resource shadows’ – near real-time copies of critical data and configuration – *before* updates are initiated. Couple this with a predictive analysis engine to anticipate rollback complexities and pre-stage necessary resources.

**Specification:**

**I. Resource Shadow Creation:**

1.  **Shadow Identification:**  A configuration file (or dynamic query) defines which resources (files, database entries, VM snapshots, etc.) are designated for shadowing.  Priority levels can be assigned.
2.  **Shadowing Mechanism:**
    *   **File-Based:** Utilize rsync or similar tools for incremental mirroring to a shadow storage location. Implement version control (e.g., Git) for file shadows.
    *   **Database:** Implement logical replication or snapshotting for database shadows. Consider differential backups.
    *   **VMs/Containers:**  Utilize VM/container snapshotting features for full or incremental shadows.
3.  **Triggering:**  Shadow creation is triggered *before* any update process commences.  A dedicated "shadow manager" service oversees this.
4.  **Metadata:**  Store metadata alongside each shadow:
    *   Timestamp of creation
    *   Update process ID associated
    *   Resource dependencies (other resources shadowed)
    *   Checksum/hash for data integrity

**II. Predictive Rollback Analysis:**

1.  **Dependency Mapping:**  Automatically discover and map dependencies between shadowed resources. Use system calls and configuration file parsing.
2.  **Rollback Complexity Scoring:**  Assign a complexity score to each resource based on:
    *   Dependency depth (number of dependent resources)
    *   Data volume
    *   Resource type (VM rollback is inherently more complex than a file restore)
    *   Known rollback failure rates (historical data)
3.  **Resource Pre-staging:**  Based on the complexity score:
    *   High Complexity: Allocate dedicated resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) for rollback. Pre-create VMs/containers if applicable.
    *   Medium Complexity:  Increase resource allocation priority for rollback tasks.
    *   Low Complexity: Standard resource allocation.

**III. Rollback Process:**

1.  **Rollback Trigger:**  Rollback initiated by watchdog process (as in original patent).
2.  **Shadow Activation:**
    *   Identify corresponding shadows based on update process ID.
    *   Activate shadows, restoring data/configuration to pre-update state.
    *   Leverage shadow metadata to resolve dependencies.
3.  **Validation:**  Post-rollback validation process to ensure system integrity.
4.  **Dynamic Resource Adjustment:**  If rollback fails for a resource, dynamically allocate additional resources to attempt recovery.

**Pseudocode (Rollback Process):**

```
function rollback(updateProcessID):
  shadows = getShadows(updateProcessID)
  if shadows is null:
    log("No shadows found for process ID: " + updateProcessID)
    return false

  dependencies = getDependencies(shadows)

  for resource in dependencies:
    if resource.rollbackFailed:
      allocateAdditionalResources(resource)
      attemptRollback(resource)
      if resource.rollbackFailed:
        log("Rollback failed for resource: " + resource.name)
        //Implement escalation procedure.

    restoreFromShadow(resource) //Uses shadow data.
    validateResource(resource)

  log("Rollback successful for process ID: " + updateProcessID)
  return true
```

**IV. Implementation Details:**

*   **Language:** Python for scripting and orchestration, C/C++ for performance-critical components.
*   **Storage:** Distributed file system (e.g., Ceph, GlusterFS) for shadow storage.
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes or similar container orchestration platform.
*   **Monitoring:** Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring and alerting.
