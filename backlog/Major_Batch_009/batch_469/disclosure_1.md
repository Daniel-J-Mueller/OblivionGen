## Adaptive Data Granularity Processing

**Concept:** Expand the concept of switching configurations for different neural network layers to incorporate *adaptive data granularity* during processing. Instead of fixed-size data chunks for each layer, dynamically adjust the granularity based on data complexity and processing element availability.

**Specifications:**

**1. Granularity Assessment Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw data stream, layer configuration (weights, biases), processing element status (busy/idle).
*   **Function:** Analyze incoming data characteristics (e.g., entropy, variance).  Determine optimal data chunk size for current layer. Higher complexity -> smaller chunk size.  Consider processing element availability; if elements are saturated, reduce chunk size to distribute load.
*   **Output:**  Recommended data chunk size (in bits/bytes) for the current layer and data segment.  A 'granularity flag' indicating the chosen size.

**2. Dynamic Data Partitioning:**

*   **Input:** Data stream, granularity flag, recommended chunk size.
*   **Function:** Divide the incoming data stream into variable-sized chunks based on the granularity flag.  Implement a buffering system to hold these chunks.  Prioritize chunks based on dependency within the network (e.g., essential nodes first).
*   **Output:** A queue of data chunks with associated priority levels.

**3. Adaptive Processing Element Allocation:**

*   **Input:** Chunk queue, processing element status, layer configuration.
*   **Function:** Dynamically assign processing elements to process data chunks.  Smaller chunks may be processed by a single element; larger chunks may require multiple elements working in parallel.  Implement a scheduling algorithm that minimizes latency and maximizes throughput.
*   **Output:**  Allocation map (element ID -> chunk ID).

**4. Granularity-Aware Weight Loading:**

*   **Input:** Weight data (from state buffer), chunk ID, layer configuration.
*   **Function:** Load only the necessary weights for the current chunk, based on its position within the overall data set. This minimizes memory access and improves efficiency.  Implement a caching mechanism to store frequently used weights.
*   **Output:**  Chunk-specific weight set.

**5. Result Aggregation:**

*   **Input:** Partial results from processing elements, chunk ID, layer configuration.
*   **Function:** Reassemble partial results into a complete layer output.  Handle potential synchronization issues due to variable chunk sizes.  Implement error detection and correction mechanisms.
*   **Output:**  Complete layer output.

**Pseudocode (Core Processing Loop):**

```
FOR each layer IN neural_network:
  WHILE data_available:
    chunk = get_next_data_chunk()
    granularity = assess_granularity(chunk, layer)
    chunk_size = determine_chunk_size(granularity)
    partition_data(chunk, chunk_size)

    allocate_processing_elements(chunk_size)
    load_weights(chunk_size)

    process_chunk()

    aggregate_results()
END
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Reconfigurable interconnect network to dynamically route data between processing elements.
*   High-bandwidth memory interface to support variable data rates.
*   Fine-grained power management to optimize energy consumption.
*   Local buffers on each processing element to store intermediate results.
