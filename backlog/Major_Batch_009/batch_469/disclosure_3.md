## Dynamic Subgraph Granularity & Adaptive Optimization

**Concept:** The patent focuses on classifying subgraphs as compute or memory bound to suppress optimizations. This builds on that by *dynamically* adjusting the size/granularity of subgraphs during compilation *and* adaptively switching between optimization strategies based on real-time profiling of execution on target hardware.

**Specs:**

**1. Compilation Phase – Initial Subgraph Formation:**

*   **Algorithm:** Employ a hierarchical subgraph formation algorithm.  Start with a large, coarse-grained graph representing the entire neural network.  Recursively subdivide this graph based on operator dependencies and data flow.  The depth of this recursion (i.e., the size of the resulting subgraphs) is determined by a configurable parameter, `initial_granularity`.
*   **Profiling Hooks:** Insert profiling hooks within the initial graph structure.  These hooks will measure operator execution time, memory access patterns, and data transfer volumes *during a short, representative execution run on the target hardware*. This run does *not* need to be a full inference or training cycle; a sample batch or a limited number of iterations is sufficient.
*   **Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL):** The profiling hooks must interact with a HAL to gather hardware-specific metrics (e.g., L1/L2 cache hit rates, DRAM bandwidth utilization, core clock speeds).

**2. Runtime Profiling & Adaptive Subdivision:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** During execution (inference/training), continuously monitor the performance of each subgraph using the profiling hooks. Metrics to track include: execution time, memory bandwidth usage, and data transfer volumes.
*   **Subdivision Trigger:**  If a subgraph’s performance falls below a predefined threshold (determined by `performance_threshold`), trigger a subdivision process.
*   **Dynamic Subdivision:**  The subdivision process splits the problematic subgraph into smaller subgraphs. The splitting criteria prioritize operators with the highest compute or memory bottlenecks. This process is recursive until the desired granularity is achieved.
*   **Merging:** Conversely, if subgraphs demonstrate consistently high performance and low overhead, a merging process can combine adjacent subgraphs to reduce compilation and runtime overhead.

**3. Adaptive Optimization Selection:**

*   **Optimization Library:**  Maintain a library of optimization techniques categorized as compute-focused, memory-focused, or hybrid.  Examples include:
    *   **Compute:** Kernel fusion, loop unrolling, quantization, pruning.
    *   **Memory:**  Operator tiling, data layout transformation, buffer allocation strategies, prefetching.
    *   **Hybrid:** Mixed precision training, gradient accumulation.
*   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** Implement a reinforcement learning agent that learns to select the optimal optimization strategy for each subgraph based on its characteristics and runtime performance.
    *   **State:** The state representation includes the subgraph’s size, compute/memory usage, performance metrics (execution time, bandwidth), and the current optimization strategy applied.
    *   **Action:** The action space consists of the available optimization strategies.
    *   **Reward:** The reward function is designed to maximize performance (minimize execution time) and minimize resource utilization (memory bandwidth).

**Pseudocode (RL Agent):**

```python
class RLAgent:
    def __init__(self, optimization_library):
        self.optimization_library = optimization_library

    def select_optimization(self, subgraph_state):
        # Predict the best action (optimization strategy) based on the subgraph state
        action = self.predict_action(subgraph_state)
        return action

    def predict_action(self, subgraph_state):
        #  Use a trained model (e.g., deep Q-network) to predict the optimal action.
        #  This is a placeholder.  The actual implementation depends on the RL algorithm.
        #  For simplicity, assume a policy table:
        if subgraph_state['compute_bound']:
            return self.optimization_library['compute_optimizations']
        else:
            return self.optimization_library['memory_optimizations']
```

**4.  Compilation & Execution Pipeline:**

1.  Initial graph compilation & subgraph formation (using `initial_granularity`).
2.  Short profiling run on target hardware.
3.  RL Agent selects initial optimization strategies for each subgraph.
4.  Compilation with selected optimizations.
5.  Execution monitoring.
6.  If performance degrades, trigger subgraph subdivision or merging.
7.  RL Agent re-evaluates optimization strategies.
8.  Re-compile and re-deploy the optimized subgraph.
9.  Repeat steps 5-8 continuously.

**Configurable Parameters:**

*   `initial_granularity`: Controls the initial size of subgraphs.
*   `performance_threshold`: Defines the performance threshold for triggering subgraph subdivision.
*   `merging_threshold`: Defines the performance threshold for triggering subgraph merging.
*   `RL_training_epochs`: Number of training epochs for the reinforcement learning agent.
