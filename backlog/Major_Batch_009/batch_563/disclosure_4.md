## Adaptive Network Prioritization based on User Behavior & Predictive Modeling

**Concept:** Extend the idea of a preferred network list by dynamically adjusting prioritization *not just* based on roaming availability, but on predicted user experience. This goes beyond simply identifying available networks; it anticipates which network will provide the *best* experience for the user *at that moment*, learning from historical usage patterns and real-time network conditions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection Module:**

*   **Behavioral Data:** Tracks application usage (bandwidth, latency sensitivity), time of day, location (GPS, cell tower triangulation), and user-defined preferences (e.g., “prioritize video streaming”, “minimize data usage”).
*   **Network Performance Data:** Continuously monitors signal strength, latency, packet loss, and throughput for all detectable networks (Wi-Fi, cellular). Data sourced from device measurements and potentially crowd-sourced data (anonymized from other users).
*   **Contextual Data:** Integrates external data sources like weather (impacts signal propagation) and local event schedules (potential network congestion).

**2. Predictive Modeling Engine:**

*   **Machine Learning Model:** A recurrent neural network (RNN) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network trained on historical data to predict user Quality of Experience (QoE) on each available network. QoE metric incorporates bandwidth, latency, packet loss, and application-specific weighting.
*   **Feature Engineering:** Uses behavioral, network, and contextual data as features for the ML model. Includes time-series analysis of network performance.
*   **Model Update:** Continuously retrains the ML model with new data to adapt to changing network conditions and user behavior.  (Cloud-based retraining with federated learning to preserve user privacy).

**3. Dynamic Prioritization Logic:**

*   **Network Scoring:**  Calculates a score for each available network based on the predicted QoE from the ML model.
*   **Prioritization Adjustment:** Dynamically adjusts the preferred network list based on the calculated scores. Networks with higher predicted QoE are moved to the top of the list.
*   **Adaptive Switching:** Implements a logic to seamlessly switch between networks based on real-time performance monitoring and predicted QoE. Avoids "sticky" connections to suboptimal networks.
*   **User Override:** Allows users to manually override the dynamic prioritization logic if desired.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **On-Device Processing:** Most data collection, scoring, and prioritization logic performed on the user device to minimize latency and preserve privacy.
*   **Cloud Synchronization:** Periodically synchronizes user preferences, historical data, and updated ML models with the cloud.
*   **API for 3rd Party Integration:** Provides an API for 3rd party applications to access network performance data and influence prioritization logic.

**Pseudocode (Prioritization Adjustment):**

```
// Get list of available networks
networks = scanForAvailableNetworks()

// Calculate QoE score for each network
for each network in networks:
  network.QoEScore = predictQoE(network, userBehaviorData, contextualData)

// Sort networks by QoEScore (descending)
sortedNetworks = sort(sortedNetworks, QoEScore)

// Update preferred network list
preferredNetworkList = sortedNetworks.slice(0, N) // N = number of networks to include in the list

// Apply the preferred network list to the modem
updateModemPreferredNetworkList(preferredNetworkList)
```

**Potential Innovations:**

*   **Personalized Network Profiles:** Creating unique network profiles for each user based on their historical behavior and preferences.
*   **Proactive Network Optimization:**  Predicting potential network congestion and proactively switching to a better network before the user experiences a degradation in service.
*   **Gamified Network Contribution:** Rewarding users for contributing anonymized network performance data to improve the accuracy of the predictive models.
