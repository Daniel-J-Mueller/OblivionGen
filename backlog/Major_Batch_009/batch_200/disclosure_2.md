## Dynamic Content Prefetching Based on Predicted User Movement

**Concept:** Leverage mobile device motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS) to *predict* a userâ€™s likely change in location and proactively prefetch content to a nearby PoP *before* the user explicitly requests it. This minimizes latency for streaming during movement.

**Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Mobile application continuously samples accelerometer, gyroscope, and GPS data. Frequency adjustable (10Hz - 60Hz) based on network conditions and battery life.
*   **Movement Prediction Engine:**  A machine learning model (Recurrent Neural Network preferred) trained on historical user movement data.
    *   **Input:** Time-series data from sensors.
    *   **Output:**  Probability distribution over potential future locations (latitude/longitude coordinates) for the next 5-30 seconds.  Confidence score associated with each predicted location.
*   **PoP Selection Algorithm:**
    *   For each predicted location with a confidence score above a threshold (adjustable, default 0.7), identify the geographically closest PoP.
    *   Evaluate network connectivity to the potential PoP based on ping times and historical data.
    *   Rank potential PoPs based on proximity *and* network performance.
*   **Content Prefetching Logic:**
    *   Based on current streaming content (video ID, bitrate) *and* predicted content likely to be viewed next (based on viewing history, recommendations, or explicit user selection), prefetch segments of the content to the top-ranked PoP.
    *   Prefetching is adaptive:
        *   Adjust prefetch buffer size based on predicted movement speed and network conditions. Faster movement requires a larger buffer.
        *   Prioritize prefetching based on content popularity and available bandwidth.
    *   Content is prefetched using standard HTTP/HTTPS requests with appropriate caching headers.
*   **Client-Side Buffering & Switching:**
    *   Mobile application maintains a local buffer of streamed content.
    *   Upon detecting a significant change in location (based on GPS), the application seamlessly switches to the pre-fetched content from the nearest PoP *before* buffering stalls occur.
    *   Switching is transparent to the user.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **Mobile Application:** Sensor data acquisition, movement prediction, local buffering, PoP switching.
    *   **Edge Servers (PoPs):** Content caching, prefetching requests, content delivery.
    *   **Central Prediction Service:**  Model training, model updates, historical data analysis.
*   **Pseudocode (Mobile App - Location Update):**

```
FUNCTION onLocationUpdate(latitude, longitude):
  // Check if significant location change
  IF distance(currentLocation, (latitude, longitude)) > threshold:
    // Get predicted locations from prediction model
    predictedLocations = getPredictedLocations()
    
    // Select best PoP based on predicted locations
    bestPoP = selectBestPoP(predictedLocations)
    
    // Switch to pre-fetched content from best PoP
    switchContentSource(bestPoP)
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Scalability:** The central prediction service can be scaled horizontally using a distributed database and message queue.
*   **Privacy:** User location data is anonymized and aggregated for model training.  Users can opt-out of location tracking.
