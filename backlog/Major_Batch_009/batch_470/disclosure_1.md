**Dynamic Referral Incentive Layer - 'Momentum'**

**Concept:** Expand the referral system beyond simple commissions to incorporate a dynamic incentive layer based on 'referral momentum'. This aims to gamify the referral process and incentivize sustained, high-quality referrals, not just initial sign-ups.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Referral Momentum Metric:**
    *   Define a 'Momentum Score' for each referring entity (website/affiliate).
    *   Base Score: Starts at 0.
    *   Positive Contribution: Each *successful* purchase attributed to a referral link adds to the Momentum Score. Weighting can be applied (higher value items = higher contribution).
    *   Time Decay: Momentum Score *decays* over time. A consistent stream of referrals is required to maintain a high score. Decay rate is configurable.
    *   'Quality' Factor:  Introduce a 'Quality' factor based on post-purchase user behavior. Returns, negative reviews, or account inactivity *decrease* the Quality factor. High Quality = larger Momentum boost.
2.  **Tiered Incentive Structure:**
    *   Momentum Score determines the referral commission rate.
    *   Tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond. Each tier corresponds to a specific commission multiplier.
    *   Tier Thresholds: Define minimum Momentum Scores for each tier.
    *   Tier Maintenance:  Momentum Score must remain above the threshold to maintain the tier. Falling below the threshold causes a downgrade.
3.  **'Referral Chain' Bonus:**
    *   If a referred user *also* becomes a referring entity, the original referrer receives a small percentage of the commissions generated by *their* referrals (a 'chain bonus').
    *   Maximum Chain Depth: Limit the depth of the referral chain to prevent runaway bonuses.
4.  **'Spotlight' Feature:**
    *   High-Momentum referrers are featured prominently on the merchant’s website or marketing materials (e.g., “Top Referrers of the Month”).
    *   This provides visibility and recognition, incentivizing sustained performance.
5.  **Technical Implementation (Pseudocode):**

```
// Data Structures
struct Affiliate {
    AffiliateID: String;
    MomentumScore: Float;
    QualityFactor: Float;
    CommissionRate: Float;
    Tier: String;
};

// Function: ProcessPurchase(PurchaseData)
function ProcessPurchase(PurchaseData) {
    AffiliateID = PurchaseData.ReferringAffiliateID;
    Affiliate = GetAffiliate(AffiliateID);

    // Calculate Momentum Boost
    MomentumBoost = PurchaseData.PurchaseValue * Affiliate.QualityFactor * 0.1;

    // Update Affiliate Momentum Score
    Affiliate.MomentumScore += MomentumBoost;

    // Recalculate Commission Rate based on Momentum Score
    Affiliate.CommissionRate = CalculateCommissionRate(Affiliate.MomentumScore);

    // Apply Time Decay (e.g., reduce MomentumScore by 1% per day)
    Affiliate.MomentumScore *= 0.99;

    //Update Quality Factor (based on post purchase reviews/returns)
    Affiliate.QualityFactor = CalculateQualityFactor(PurchaseData);

    SaveAffiliate(Affiliate);

    //Return Commission amount for the purchase
    Return PurchaseValue * Affiliate.CommissionRate;
}
```

6.  **Reporting & Analytics:**
    *   Real-time dashboard for affiliates to track their Momentum Score, Tier, and commission earnings.
    *   Merchant-side analytics to identify top-performing referrers and analyze the effectiveness of the referral program.
