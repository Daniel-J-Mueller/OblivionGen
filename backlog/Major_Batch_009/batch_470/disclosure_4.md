**Adaptive Microservice Shadowing & Predictive Refactoring**

**Specification:**

*   **Core Concept:** Implement a system that dynamically creates “shadow” microservices based on real-time user interaction data *before* a full refactor is initiated. These shadows mirror anticipated heavily-used functionality, allowing for A/B testing, performance profiling, and gradual migration of traffic *without* impacting the monolithic application’s stability.

*   **Components:**
    *   **Interaction Recorder:** Captures user interactions (API calls, UI events) with the monolithic application.  This data includes request/response payloads, timestamps, user IDs, and associated application components.
    *   **Prediction Engine:** An AI/ML model trained on the interaction data to predict future usage patterns.  It identifies “hot paths” – frequently executed code sequences – and estimates future load.  It doesn't just look at frequency, but also *change* in frequency - identifying emerging trends.
    *   **Shadow Service Generator:**  Automatically generates lightweight microservices representing the predicted hot paths.  These services are deployed in a staging environment, mirroring the functionality of the corresponding code within the monolith.  Generation should be code-first or API-first - supporting a range of languages.
    *   **Traffic Mirroring/Shifting:**  A configurable system to mirror a small percentage of production traffic to the shadow services.  Gradually increase the percentage based on performance and error rates.  Implement canary deployments.
    *   **Performance Profiler:** Continuously monitors the performance of both the monolithic application and the shadow services, comparing metrics (latency, throughput, CPU usage, memory consumption).
    *   **Automated Refactoring Engine:** Based on the performance data and traffic shifting results, automatically generates refactoring proposals for the monolithic application, extracting the proven-stable functionality into fully-fledged, independent microservices. The refactoring engine should *also* suggest optimal deployment configurations (e.g., auto-scaling parameters, resource allocation).
    *   **Feedback Loop:**  The performance data and refactoring proposals feed back into the prediction engine, improving its accuracy and refining the extraction process.

*   **Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
    interactionData = InteractionRecorder.captureData();
    predictedHotPaths = PredictionEngine.predict(interactionData);

    for each hotPath in predictedHotPaths {
        if (hotPath not already shadowed) {
            shadowService = ShadowServiceGenerator.generate(hotPath);
            deployShadowService(shadowService);
        }

        mirrorTraffic(hotPath, shadowService, percentage); // percentage increases over time
        performanceData = PerformanceProfiler.collectData(hotPath, monolith, shadowService);
        refactoringProposal = AutomatedRefactoringEngine.generate(performanceData);
        if (refactoringProposal.isValid()) {
           applyRefactoring(refactoringProposal);
        }
    }
}
```

*   **Data Model:**
    *   `InteractionRecord`: {`timestamp`, `userId`, `apiCall`, `requestPayload`, `responsePayload`, `componentId`}
    *   `HotPath`: {`componentId`, `executionSequence`, `predictedLoad`, `performanceMetrics`}
    *   `RefactoringProposal`: {`componentId`, `newMicroserviceName`, `dependencies`, `estimatedCost`, `riskAssessment`}

*   **Deployment:** Containerized microservices deployed using Kubernetes or similar orchestration platform.

*   **Novelty:** This moves *beyond* reactive microservice extraction to *proactive* extraction based on predictive analysis and iterative traffic shifting.  It drastically reduces the risk and disruption associated with traditional monolithic application refactoring. It isn't just about *identifying* candidates for microservices, but *preparing* them for live deployment *before* the full refactor.
