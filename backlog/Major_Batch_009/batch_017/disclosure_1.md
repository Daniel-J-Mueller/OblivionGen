## Dynamic Emotional Resonance Editing

**Concept:** Extend the video rule engine to dynamically adjust video editing *based on detected emotional responses* of viewers watching the video. This creates a personalized and adaptive viewing experience.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Video Data: Standard video input.
    *   Real-time Viewer Data: Facial expression analysis (via webcam), heart rate (via wearable), galvanic skin response (GSR), or other biometrics indicating emotional state.  Multiple viewers are supported concurrently.
    *   Emotion Mapping Table:  A configurable table mapping detected emotions (joy, sadness, fear, anger, surprise, neutral) to editing parameters.

*   **Processing:**
    1.  **Emotional State Detection:**  Real-time analysis of viewer data to determine current emotional state.  AI model employed, trained on diverse emotional expression datasets.  Confidence score associated with each emotion.
    2.  **Rule Application:** Based on detected emotion and confidence score, select appropriate editing parameters from the Emotion Mapping Table.  Parameters may include:
        *   **Scene Cut Timing:** Adjust the timing of scene cuts to emphasize or de-emphasize emotional peaks.  Faster cuts during high excitement, slower cuts during melancholic moments.
        *   **Music Selection/Volume:** Dynamically adjust background music based on detected emotion.  Uplifting music during joy, somber music during sadness, suspenseful music during fear.  Volume level also adjusted.
        *   **Color Grading:** Subtle adjustments to color saturation and contrast to enhance emotional impact.  Warmer tones during joy, cooler tones during sadness.
        *   **Visual Effects Intensity:** Adjust the intensity of visual effects (e.g., blur, zoom, distortion) to amplify emotional response.
        *   **Pacing:** Speed up or slow down the video playback rate slightly to influence viewer engagement.
    3.  **Adaptive Editing:** The video editing pipeline is dynamically adjusted in real-time based on selected parameters. This occurs *before* the video is presented to the viewer.  Multiple editing streams are generated in parallel, allowing for a smoother transition between adjustments.
    4. **Personalization Profile:** Viewer emotional responses are stored (with appropriate consent) to create a personalized profile.  Future video editing can be tailored to individual preferences.

*   **Output:**
    *   Dynamically Edited Video: A personalized video experience adapted to the viewerâ€™s emotional state.
    *   Emotional Response Data:  Data logging of viewer emotional responses for analysis and profile building.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function DynamicEdit(videoData, viewerData, emotionMappingTable) {
  emotion = DetectEmotion(viewerData); // AI model returns primary emotion
  confidence = GetConfidenceScore(emotion); // Model returns confidence score
  editingParameters = GetEditingParameters(emotion, confidence, emotionMappingTable);
  editedVideoData = ApplyEditingParameters(videoData, editingParameters);
  return editedVideoData;
}

function ApplyEditingParameters(videoData, parameters) {
  //Implement logic for scene cut timing, music adjustment, color grading, etc.
  //This will be a complex function involving video and audio processing
  //May involve using a video editing library
  return editedVideoData;
}

```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Webcam and/or Biometric Sensor.
*   Powerful Processing Unit (GPU recommended) for real-time video and audio processing.
*   Sufficient Memory for storing video data and emotional response data.
