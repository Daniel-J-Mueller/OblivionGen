## Adaptive Event Granularity & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** The existing system focuses on capturing *all* state changes and compiling them into event data. This proposal introduces adaptive event granularity – dynamically adjusting the level of detail captured based on predicted application needs – coupled with predictive buffering to preemptively store relevant data.

**Rationale:** Not all state changes are equally important for all applications. Fine-grained data is valuable for debugging/auditing, while coarse-grained data suffices for high-level monitoring or alerting.  Pre-emptive buffering can dramatically reduce latency.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Modeling Component:**

*   **Input:** Historical state change data, application profiles (defined by users/administrators – e.g., "debug mode", "performance monitoring"), resource utilization metrics.
*   **Process:**  Utilize a time-series forecasting model (e.g., LSTM, Prophet) to predict future state change patterns *and* the level of granularity required by applications. The model should output a ‘granularity score’ (0-100, where 0=minimal, 100=maximal).  The model should also output a ‘buffer prefetch size’ representing the number of state changes to pre-buffer.
*   **Output:** Granularity score, Buffer prefetch size, updated every N seconds (configurable).

**2. Adaptive State Change Capture:**

*   **Integration Point:**  Intercept state change information *before* it's added to the transaction journal.
*   **Process:**
    *   Retrieve the current granularity score and buffer prefetch size from the Predictive Modeling Component.
    *   Apply a filtering/aggregation function to the state change data based on the granularity score.  Examples:
        *   Score < 20: Only capture critical errors and key performance indicators (KPIs).
        *   Score 20-60: Capture significant state transitions and moderate KPIs.
        *   Score > 60: Capture all state changes.
    *   Write the filtered/aggregated state change data to the transaction journal.

**3. Predictive Buffering System:**

*   **Implementation:** A ring buffer maintained by each worker system.
*   **Process:**
    *   Worker systems proactively fetch state change data from the transaction journal based on the buffer prefetch size.
    *   Fetched data is stored in the ring buffer.
    *   When a request for event data arrives, the worker system first checks the ring buffer. If the required data is present, it serves it immediately. Otherwise, it accesses the transaction journal.

**4. Database Integration**

*   Add a new field to the transaction journal entry – `granularity_score`.
*   Add a new table – `application_profiles` – to store application-specific configuration (granularity requirements, monitoring preferences).

**Pseudocode (Worker System):**

```
function process_event_request(request):
  // Check ring buffer first
  event_data = ring_buffer.get(request.container_id)
  if event_data != null:
    return event_data

  // Access transaction journal if data is not in buffer
  state_changes = transaction_journal.get(request.container_id)
  event_data = compile_event_data(state_changes)

  //Add to ring buffer
  ring_buffer.put(request.container_id, event_data)
  return event_data
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased memory requirements for ring buffers.
*   Potential need for faster storage to support predictive fetching.

**Scalability Notes:**

*   The predictive modeling component could be implemented as a distributed service to handle a large number of applications.
*   Ring buffer sizes should be configurable to balance memory usage and latency.
