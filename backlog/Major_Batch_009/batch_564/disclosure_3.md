## Temporal Feature Blending for Predictive Maintenance

**Concept:** Extend the frequency-based image manipulation to *time-series data*, specifically for predictive maintenance applications. Instead of manipulating spatial frequencies in images, we’ll manipulate temporal frequencies in sensor data streams to generate synthetic failure scenarios for training machine learning models.

**Specification:**

**I. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**

1.  **Sensor Suite:** Deploy a sensor suite on target equipment (e.g., turbines, pumps, motors). Sensors should capture relevant data streams: vibration, temperature, pressure, current draw, acoustic emissions.
2.  **Data Buffering:** Each sensor stream is buffered into time-series data segments (e.g., 5-minute windows).
3.  **Feature Extraction:** Apply a Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to each time-series segment. This decomposes the signal into its constituent frequencies over time, creating a spectrogram-like representation.  Extract amplitude and phase data for each frequency bin.

**II. Temporal Frequency Manipulation**

1.  **Frequency Band Selection:** Define frequency bands representing “normal” operation and potential failure modes (e.g., imbalance, misalignment, bearing wear).  This can be informed by domain expertise or anomaly detection algorithms.
2.  **Temporal Pyramid Decomposition:** Implement a temporal pyramid decomposition (similar to a Laplacian pyramid, but operating on time-series data).  This involves downsampling the time-series data at different scales, creating representations at varying temporal resolutions. Each level of the pyramid represents different temporal frequencies.
3.  **Parameter Definition:** Introduce parameters controlling the manipulation of temporal frequencies:
    *   `amplitude_scale`: Scaling factor for amplitude values in a specific frequency band.
    *   `phase_shift`: Phase shift applied to frequencies in a band (simulates component misalignment or resonance).
    *   `frequency_shift`: Shifting the frequencies within a band to simulate changes in operating speed.
    *   `noise_injection`: Adding stochastic noise to specific frequency bands (simulates sensor noise or unpredictable failure modes).
4.  **Data Blending:**
    *   Select a 'source' time-series segment representing normal operation.
    *   Select a 'target' time-series segment representing an early-stage failure.
    *   For each level of the temporal pyramid:
        *   Extract temporal frequency data from both source and target segments.
        *   Apply the defined parameters (`amplitude_scale`, `phase_shift`, `frequency_shift`, `noise_injection`) to the source data.
        *   Blend the modified source data with the target data using weighted averaging. The weights can be adjusted based on the severity of the simulated failure.
5.  **Synthetic Data Generation:** Reconstruct the modified time-series data from the blended temporal pyramid representation.

**III. Training & Validation**

1.  **Training Dataset:** Create a training dataset comprising:
    *   Real-world data representing normal operation.
    *   Synthetic data generated using the above process, representing various failure scenarios.
2.  **Machine Learning Model:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., LSTM, CNN, Transformer) to predict equipment failure based on the time-series data.
3.  **Validation:** Validate the model’s performance on a holdout dataset comprising real-world data, including examples of actual failures.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def generate_synthetic_data(source_data, target_data, params):
  # Decompose source and target data into temporal pyramid
  source_pyramid = temporal_pyramid_decomposition(source_data)
  target_pyramid = temporal_pyramid_decomposition(target_data)

  blended_pyramid = []
  for level in range(len(source_pyramid)):
    # Apply parameters to source data at this level
    modified_source = apply_parameters(source_pyramid[level], params[level])

    # Blend modified source and target data
    blended_level = weighted_average(modified_source, target_pyramid[level])
    blended_pyramid.append(blended_level)

  # Reconstruct synthetic data from blended pyramid
  synthetic_data = reconstruct_from_temporal_pyramid(blended_pyramid)
  return synthetic_data
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Predictive maintenance for industrial equipment.
*   Anomaly detection in real-time sensor data.
*   Training robust machine learning models for time-series forecasting.
*   Simulating extreme operating conditions for equipment testing.
