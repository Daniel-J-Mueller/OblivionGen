## Adaptive Temporal Filtering with Perceptual Loss Guidance

**Concept:** Extend the temporal filtering approach by incorporating a perceptual loss function during the filtered block generation. This aims to minimize visually noticeable artifacts introduced by the filtering process, especially in areas of high detail or motion. Instead of solely relying on MSE-based filtering, the system learns to prioritize preserving perceptual quality.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Perceptual Loss Network:**
    *   Implement a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (e.g., VGG, ResNet) as a feature extractor. This network serves as the basis for the perceptual loss calculation.
    *   Extract features from both the original block and the filtered block using the pre-trained network.  Multiple layers can be used to capture varying levels of detail.
    *   Calculate the L1 or L2 distance between the extracted features. This distance represents the perceptual difference between the original and filtered blocks.

2.  **Filter Weight Optimization:**
    *   Augment the existing filter weight calculation (MSE, quantization parameter, variance) with a perceptual loss weight.
    *   The perceptual loss weight controls the trade-off between minimizing MSE and preserving perceptual quality.
    *   Implement a dynamic adjustment mechanism for the perceptual loss weight based on scene complexity and motion intensity. Higher complexity/motion -> higher weight.

3.  **Filtering Process:**
    *   Instead of directly applying filter weights to reference blocks, use them to modulate the *difference* between the current block and a predicted block.
    *   The predicted block can be generated using a simple interpolation or a learned model (e.g., a small CNN).
    *   The filtered block is then reconstructed by adding the modulated difference to the predicted block. This approach allows for more controlled filtering and reduces the risk of introducing artifacts.

4.  **Training & Adaptation:**
    *   Train the system using a dataset of video sequences with varying content and complexity.
    *   Use a loss function that combines MSE, perceptual loss, and a regularization term to prevent overfitting.
    *   Implement an online adaptation mechanism to adjust the filter weights and perceptual loss weight based on real-time video characteristics.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Input: Current Block (CB), Reference Blocks (RB1, RB2, ...), Quantization Parameter (QP), Variance (V)

// 1. Predict CB using interpolation or learned model -> PredictedCB

// 2. Calculate Differences:  Diff1 = CB - RB1, Diff2 = CB - RB2, ...

// 3. Calculate MSE for each Difference -> MSE1, MSE2, ...

// 4. Calculate Perceptual Loss:
    // Extract features from CB and each RB using pre-trained CNN -> FeatureCB, FeatureRB1, ...
    // Calculate L1/L2 distance between features -> PerceptualLoss1, PerceptualLoss2, ...

// 5. Calculate Filter Weights:
    // FilterWeight_i = MSE_i * Weight_MSE + PerceptualLoss_i * Weight_Perceptual + QP_Factor * QP + V_Factor * V

// 6. Modulate Differences:
    // ModulatedDiff_i = Diff_i * FilterWeight_i

// 7. Reconstruct Filtered Block:
    // FilteredBlock = PredictedBlock + Sum(ModulatedDiff_i)
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Implementation of the perceptual loss network will require a GPU or dedicated AI accelerator.
*   Memory bandwidth will be critical for accessing and processing video frames and feature maps.
*   Optimization of the filtering process will be necessary to meet real-time performance requirements.
