## Dynamic Contextual Activity Bundles

**Concept:** Expand the core activity monitoring to create and share “contextual activity bundles” – pre-packaged sets of activities representing a particular experience or goal. This moves beyond simply sharing *what* someone did, to sharing *how* to achieve something, leveraging the user's activity history.

**Specifications:**

**1. Bundle Creation Module:**

*   **Trigger:** User initiates “Create Bundle” function within the network navigation browser interface.
*   **Activity Selection:** System presents user with a chronological activity log (browsing history, purchases, social engagements, etc.).
*   **Context Tagging:** User assigns a descriptive "context tag" to the bundle (e.g., "Weekend Hiking Prep", "Planning a Home Office", "Learning Italian").  System suggests tags based on dominant activity categories.
*   **Activity Sequencing (Optional):**  User can reorder activities within the bundle to suggest a preferred sequence.
*   **Annotation:** User can add short text annotations to individual activities within the bundle ("This backpack is essential!", "Read this article first").
*   **Privacy Control:**  User defines bundle visibility (Public, Friends Only, Specific Users).

**2. Bundle Sharing & Discovery:**

*   **Social Feed Integration:** Bundles appear in friend's feeds with a preview of the context tag and a summary of activities.
*   **Bundle Directory:**  A searchable directory of public bundles organized by context tags.
*   **"Try This Bundle" Function:**  Clicking on a bundle initiates a guided browser experience:
    *   System automatically opens relevant websites in sequence.
    *   Pop-up windows display the user’s annotations for each activity.
    *   System tracks user progress through the bundle.
*   **Bundle Collaboration:** Users can “Remix” existing bundles – adding, removing, or modifying activities.  Attribution to the original creator is maintained.

**3. AI-Powered Bundle Generation:**

*   **Automatic Bundle Creation:** AI analyzes user activity logs and proactively suggests bundles ("Looks like you're planning a trip to Japan - want to create a 'Japan Trip Planning' bundle?").
*   **Bundle Enhancement:**  AI suggests additional activities to enhance existing bundles ("People who created 'Home Office Setup' bundles also added a monitor stand and a noise-canceling headset").
*   **Bundle Recommendation:** Based on user interests and friend activity, AI recommends relevant bundles.

**4. Data Structures:**

*   **Bundle Object:**
    *   `bundleID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `creatorID`: User ID of the bundle creator.
    *   `contextTag`: Descriptive tag.
    *   `activityList`: Ordered list of `activityID`s.
    *   `annotationMap`: Map of `activityID` to annotation text.
    *   `visibility`: Privacy setting.
    *   `creationDate`: Timestamp.
*   **Activity Object:**
    *   `activityID`: Unique identifier.
    *   `userID`: User ID who performed the activity.
    *   `timestamp`: Timestamp of the activity.
    *   `activityType`: (e.g., "website visit", "purchase", "social post").
    *   `resourceURL`: URL of the website or resource.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Creation):**

```
function createBundle():
  contextTag = prompt("Enter context tag:")
  activityList = []
  for activity in userActivityLog:
    if confirm("Include " + activity.resourceURL + "?"):
      activityList.append(activity.activityID)
  annotationMap = {}
  for activityID in activityList:
    annotation = prompt("Enter annotation for " + activity.resourceURL + ":")
    annotationMap[activityID] = annotation
  bundle = new Bundle(contextTag, activityList, annotationMap)
  saveBundle(bundle)
```

This system moves beyond passive activity monitoring to active experience sharing and collaborative learning, leveraging the user’s own activity as a source of curated guidance.
