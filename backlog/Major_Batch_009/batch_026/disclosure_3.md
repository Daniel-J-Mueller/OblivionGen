## Dynamic Product ‘Personality’ & Contextual Pricing

**Concept:** Expand the “image item” vs. “non-image item” classification beyond profitability to encompass a product’s perceived ‘personality’ or brand alignment, and dynamically adjust pricing not just based on cost & demand, but on contextual relevance to user activity/environment.

**Specifications:**

**I. Data Inputs:**

*   **Product Attribute Database:**  Expanded beyond basic features.  Includes subjective attributes: “Luxury”, “Eco-Friendly”, “Playful”, “Minimalist”, “Tech-Forward”, “Rustic”, etc. These are assigned via internal tagging *and* potentially through sentiment analysis of online reviews/social media mentions.  Each attribute is assigned a weighting factor.
*   **User Profile Data:** Detailed user data: Purchase history, browsing history, demographics, declared interests, social media connections (optional, with consent), location data (with consent), time of day, device type.
*   **Contextual Data:**  Real-time data: Weather conditions, local events (concerts, sports games, festivals), trending topics on social media, news headlines, current stock market conditions.
*   **"Vibe" Engine:** A machine learning model trained to identify the ‘dominant vibe’ of a user’s current activity.  This could be inferred from:
    *   The content of websites they are currently browsing.
    *   The apps they are currently using.
    *   The music they are listening to.
    *   Their recent social media posts.
    *   Location-based activity (e.g., attending a concert).

**II. Core Logic – ‘Personality’ Matching & Price Adjustment:**

1.  **Personality Profile Creation:** For each product, generate a ‘personality profile’ based on its attribute database. This is a vector representing the product’s alignment with various subjective attributes.
2.  **User ‘Vibe’ Calculation:**  The ‘Vibe’ Engine calculates the user's current ‘vibe’ – a vector representing their current preferences and mindset.
3.  **Similarity Scoring:** Calculate the cosine similarity between the product's personality profile and the user’s current vibe.  A high score indicates a strong alignment.
4.  **Dynamic Price Multiplier:**  Apply a price multiplier based on the similarity score:
    *   **High Similarity (0.8 - 1.0):** Increase price (premium pricing - user is more willing to pay for relevance).  Multiplier: 1.1 - 1.3
    *   **Medium Similarity (0.5 - 0.79):** Maintain standard price. Multiplier: 1.0
    *   **Low Similarity (0.0 - 0.49):** Decrease price (encourage trial/purchase - broaden appeal). Multiplier: 0.8 - 0.9
5.  **Contextual Adjustment:** Incorporate contextual factors:
    *   **Weather:** Increase price of umbrellas/raincoats during rain, decrease during sunshine.
    *   **Local Events:** Increase price of related merchandise (e.g., team jerseys before a game).
    *   **Trending Topics:** Increase price of related products (e.g., camping gear during a survival show).
6.  **Inventory & Cost Constraints:**  Standard inventory and cost constraints apply (ensure prices remain above cost and reflect available stock).

**III. Pseudocode:**

```
function calculateAdjustedPrice(product, user, context) {
  productPersonality = getProductPersonality(product);
  userVibe = getUserVibe(user, context);
  similarityScore = cosineSimilarity(productPersonality, userVibe);

  if (similarityScore >= 0.8) {
    priceMultiplier = 1.1 + (similarityScore - 0.8) * 0.2; //Up to 1.3
  } else if (similarityScore >= 0.5) {
    priceMultiplier = 1.0;
  } else {
    priceMultiplier = 0.8 + (0.5 - similarityScore) * 0.2; //Down to 0.8
  }

  adjustedPrice = product.basePrice * priceMultiplier;

  //Apply contextual adjustments (weather, events, trending topics)
  adjustedPrice = applyContextualAdjustments(adjustedPrice, context);

  //Apply inventory/cost constraints
  adjustedPrice = applyInventoryCostConstraints(adjustedPrice, product);

  return adjustedPrice;
}
```

**IV. Engineering Considerations:**

*   **Scalability:**  The ‘Vibe’ Engine must be scalable to handle a large number of users and products in real-time.
*   **Data Privacy:**  User data must be handled responsibly and in compliance with privacy regulations.
*   **Machine Learning Model Training:**  The ‘Vibe’ Engine and the product attribute weighting model will require ongoing training and optimization.
*   **API Integration:** The system must be integrated with the existing e-commerce platform and data sources.
