## Dynamic Resolution Prioritization & Predictive Streaming

**Concept:** Expand upon the region-of-interest (ROI) transmission concept by introducing a predictive streaming system that leverages both low- and high-resolution data, dynamically adjusting ROI resolution based on predicted user/system needs *before* a request is even made.

**Specs:**

*   **Multi-Tiered Resolution Buffering:**  Maintain *three* circular buffers:
    *   **Low-Resolution Buffer (LRB):**  Stores downsampled frames as currently implemented.  Used for initial object detection & prediction.
    *   **Medium-Resolution Buffer (MRB):** Stores a moderately downsampled version of the high-resolution frame. Allows for a quicker transmission of more detailed data when predicted need exists.
    *   **High-Resolution Buffer (HRB):** Existing high-resolution storage.

*   **Predictive AI Module:** Integrated within the camera device.
    *   **Input:** LRB data, object detection results, historical ROI request data, user behavioral patterns (if available - e.g., tracking gaze, areas of frequent interaction).
    *   **Output:** Probability scores for future ROI requests, predicted ROI coordinates, and a *recommended resolution tier* (LR, MR, or HR).

*   **Dynamic ROI Prioritization Queue:**  Replaces the single priority queue. Now contains three sub-queues: LR-ROI Queue, MR-ROI Queue, HR-ROI Queue.  The AI module assigns each detected/predicted ROI to the appropriate queue based on the recommended resolution tier.

*   **Prefetching Mechanism:** Based on the AI’s predictions, prefetch ROI data *before* a formal request is received.  For example: If the AI predicts a high probability of a user interacting with object ‘X’ within 200ms, start streaming the MR-ROI (or even HR-ROI if probability is exceptionally high) for object ‘X’ *immediately*.

*   **Adaptive Bandwidth Control:** The camera device actively monitors network bandwidth and adjusts the streaming resolution and frequency of prefetched ROIs to avoid congestion.  If bandwidth is limited, prioritize the most critical ROIs or temporarily reduce the resolution of prefetched data.

*   **Request Override:**  External requests can still override the predictive system. If an external request comes in for an ROI, the predictive stream is paused, the requested ROI is transmitted at the requested resolution, then the predictive system resumes.

**Pseudocode (AI Prediction Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    frame = get_latest_frame_from_LRB()
    objects = detect_objects(frame) // using existing object detection
    
    FOR each object IN objects:
        prediction_score = calculate_prediction_score(object, historical_data, user_behavior)
        
        IF prediction_score > threshold_MR:
            recommended_resolution = MR
        ELSE IF prediction_score > threshold_LR:
            recommended_resolution = LR
        ELSE:
            recommended_resolution = NONE // Don't prefetch
        
        add_to_ROI_queue(object, recommended_resolution)
        
    END LOOP
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The thresholds for MR and LR predictions will require extensive tuning based on application and user behavior.
*   The “historical data” could include frequency of ROI requests for specific objects, time since last request, etc.
*   User behavioral patterns may require privacy considerations and user consent.
*   This system introduces increased computational complexity within the camera device, but the potential benefits in reduced latency and improved responsiveness could be significant.
