## Adaptive Acoustic Perimeter System

**Concept:** Leverage the speed detection and communication infrastructure to create a dynamic, localized acoustic perimeter for noise mitigation or targeted audio delivery. 

**Specs:**

*   **Core Components:** Illuminated signal device (as per patent), array of directional microphones, miniature audio amplifiers, weatherproof acoustic emitters, local processing unit (integrated within signal device housing or adjacent dedicated unit).
*   **Functionality:**
    1.  **Vehicle Detection & Tracking:** Utilize PIR/Radar/Lidar for vehicle detection and speed estimation (existing patent functionality).
    2.  **Acoustic Mapping:** Based on vehicle speed and trajectory, the system calculates a "sound shadow" – the area likely to be impacted by vehicle noise.
    3.  **Dynamic Acoustic Barrier:**
        *   Directional microphones capture ambient sound.
        *   The local processing unit analyzes the sound, identifies the vehicle’s contribution to the noise, and generates an inverse wave signal.
        *   Acoustic emitters positioned around the signal device project the inverse wave, effectively canceling out a portion of the vehicle's noise *within a limited radius*.
    4.  **Targeted Audio Delivery (Alternative Mode):**  Instead of noise cancellation, the system can *amplify* audio directed towards the vehicle. Example: Emergency vehicle sirens localized to the immediate vicinity, or public service announcements targeted at drivers.
    5.  **Communication & Network Integration:**
        *   System communicates vehicle speed/position data to the backend server.
        *   Backend server manages system parameters (noise cancellation profiles, audio content) and distributes updates.
        *   Users can customize system behavior via a mobile app (e.g., adjust cancellation intensity, select audio content).

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  vehicleDetected = detectVehicle();
  if (vehicleDetected) {
    speed = getVehicleSpeed();
    trajectory = getVehicleTrajectory();
    soundShadow = calculateSoundShadow(trajectory, speed);

    if (mode == "noiseCancellation") {
      inverseWave = generateInverseWave(soundShadow, ambientSound);
      emitSound(inverseWave, soundShadow);
    } else if (mode == "targetedAudio") {
      audioContent = getAudioContent();
      emitSound(audioContent, soundShadow);
    }
  }
}
```
