## Predictive Part Degradation & Proactive Ordering System

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the existing sales ranking foundation by integrating real-time vehicle data with predictive failure modeling. Instead of *ranking* popularity, the system *predicts* when parts are likely to fail for individual users, triggering proactive order suggestions.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Vehicle Telemetry Integration:**
    *   Direct API access to vehicle ECUs (where permissible) or integration with existing vehicle data platforms (OnStar, connected car apps, aftermarket OBDII adapters).
    *   Data points collected: mileage, engine hours, operating conditions (temperature, load, speed), sensor data (e.g., brake pad wear sensors, oil quality sensors, tire pressure).
    *   Data Security/Privacy: Prioritize anonymization and user consent. Data is primarily used for localized prediction and never shared externally.

2.  **Failure Mode Database:**
    *   A comprehensive database mapping part types to common failure modes (e.g., brake pad wear, battery degradation, sensor drift).
    *   Each failure mode has an associated predictive model (see below).
    *   Model updates: Continuously updated with data from warranty claims, field repairs, and user-reported issues.

3.  **Predictive Models:**
    *   Utilize machine learning algorithms (e.g., time series analysis, regression, neural networks) to predict remaining useful life (RUL) for each part.
    *   Input features: Vehicle telemetry data, historical failure data, part manufacturing data (batch numbers, quality control metrics).
    *   Model types:
        *   **Rule-based models:** For simple failure modes with clear thresholds (e.g., brake pad thickness).
        *   **Statistical models:** For predicting degradation based on usage patterns.
        *   **Deep learning models:** For complex failure modes with non-linear relationships.

4.  **Proactive Ordering Engine:**
    *   Monitors predicted RUL for each part.
    *   Triggers order suggestions when RUL falls below a predefined threshold (configurable by user).
    *   Order suggestions include:
        *   Part options (OEM, aftermarket, different price points).
        *   Estimated delivery time.
        *   Installation instructions/resources.
        *   Local service center recommendations.

**Pseudocode - Core Logic (Per Vehicle/Part):**

```
FUNCTION predict_part_failure(vehicle_id, part_type):
  // Retrieve telemetry data for vehicle
  telemetry_data = GET_TELEMETRY(vehicle_id)

  // Load predictive model for part type
  model = LOAD_MODEL(part_type)

  // Predict remaining useful life (RUL)
  RUL = model.predict(telemetry_data)

  RETURN RUL

FUNCTION generate_order_suggestion(vehicle_id, part_type):
  RUL = predict_part_failure(vehicle_id, part_type)
  threshold = GET_USER_THRESHOLD(vehicle_id, part_type)

  IF RUL < threshold:
    // Retrieve part options
    part_options = GET_PART_OPTIONS(part_type)

    // Generate order suggestion
    suggestion = {
        "part_type": part_type,
        "part_options": part_options,
        "estimated_delivery": "2-3 days",
        "installation_instructions": "link_to_instructions",
        "local_service_centers": "list_of_centers"
    }

    RETURN suggestion
  ELSE:
    RETURN None

// Main Loop (for each vehicle and part)
FOR vehicle_id IN vehicles:
  FOR part_type IN parts:
    suggestion = generate_order_suggestion(vehicle_id, part_type)
    IF suggestion != None:
      DISPLAY_ORDER_SUGGESTION(vehicle_id, suggestion)
```

**User Interface Integration:**

*   Integrated dashboard within vehicle infotainment system or mobile app.
*   Proactive notifications: "Your brake pads are estimated to need replacement in 3,000 miles."
*   One-click ordering.
*   Visual representation of part health (e.g., color-coded gauges).

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond *reactive* part sales ranking to *proactive* failure prediction and order fulfillment, creating a more valuable and personalized user experience. It relies on granular data analysis, machine learning, and seamless integration with vehicle systems.
