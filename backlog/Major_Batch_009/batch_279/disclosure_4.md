## Dynamic Format String Composition with Semantic Awareness

**Specification:**

This system extends the concept of format strings beyond simple placeholder replacement to a dynamically composable format string built *during* runtime, informed by semantic understanding of the data being formatted.  Instead of a static format string and parameters, we define a "format graph" and a data object.

**Components:**

*   **Format Graph:** A directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the desired output structure. Nodes represent output segments (text literals, data transformations, conditional logic). Edges represent the flow of data and control. Nodes can contain metadata defining formatting options (precision, alignment, date/time styles, currency symbols).

*   **Data Object:** A structured representation of the data to be formatted (e.g., a JSON object, a database record).  Includes semantic metadata –  data types, units of measure, relationships to other data, localization information.

*   **Format Engine:** Responsible for traversing the format graph, extracting data from the data object, applying transformations, and composing the final output string.

*   **Semantic Resolver:** Interprets the data object’s semantic metadata to guide the format engine.  It dynamically adjusts the format graph based on data characteristics (e.g., choose a different date format for different locales, adjust precision based on data magnitude, display units of measure).

**Workflow:**

1.  **Graph Definition:** A base format graph is loaded or created. This graph defines the general structure of the output.  It may contain placeholders for data, but it primarily describes the *arrangement* of data.
2.  **Data Object Input:** The data object is provided to the system.
3.  **Semantic Analysis:** The semantic resolver analyzes the data object’s metadata.
4.  **Dynamic Graph Modification:** Based on the semantic analysis, the format graph is dynamically modified. This could involve:
    *   Adding or removing nodes.
    *   Changing the connections between nodes.
    *   Adjusting the formatting options of nodes.
5.  **Graph Traversal & Composition:** The format engine traverses the modified format graph. For each node:
    *   If the node is a text literal, it's appended to the output string.
    *   If the node represents data, the corresponding value is extracted from the data object, transformed as specified, and appended to the output string.
    *   Conditional logic nodes determine whether certain branches of the graph are executed.
6.  **Output:** The final formatted string is returned.

**Pseudocode (Format Engine):**

```
function format(graph, data):
  output = ""
  for node in graph.nodes:
    if node.type == "text":
      output += node.value
    elif node.type == "data":
      value = data.get(node.key) // Extract value from data object
      formatted_value = apply_transformations(value, node.options) // Apply formatting options
      output += formatted_value
    elif node.type == "conditional":
      if node.condition(data):
        output += format(node.true_branch, data)
      else:
        output += format(node.false_branch, data)
    // ... other node types
  return output

function apply_transformations(value, options):
  // Apply transformations based on options (e.g., precision, date format, currency symbol)
  // ...
  return formatted_value
```

**Example:**

Imagine formatting a temperature reading.  The base format graph might include a placeholder for the temperature value and the unit ("°C" or "°F").  The semantic resolver detects that the user's locale is set to the United States.  It dynamically modifies the graph to display the temperature in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius.

**Innovation:**

This system moves beyond simple string formatting to a more flexible and semantic-aware approach. It allows for dynamic customization of the output based on the data being formatted and the user's context. This opens up possibilities for creating highly personalized and context-aware output formats.  It’s a fundamentally different paradigm than relying on pre-defined format strings.
