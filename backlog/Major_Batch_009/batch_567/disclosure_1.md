## Dynamic Terrain Masking with Predictive Occlusion

**Concept:** Extend the virtual map updating system to not only incorporate sensed terrain and object data but to *predict* occluded areas and dynamically mask them within the virtual map. This allows for a more realistic and informative aerial view, particularly in scenarios with dense foliage, urban canyons, or dynamic weather conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Fusion:** Integrate LiDAR, multi-spectral imagery, and potentially radar data from aerial vehicles. The combination improves accuracy in determining ground height, vegetation density, and material properties.
*   **Real-time 3D Reconstruction:** Implement a real-time 3D reconstruction engine on the processing unit. This engine generates a point cloud representation of the sensed terrain and objects.
*   **Occlusion Prediction Model:** Train a machine learning model (e.g., a convolutional neural network) on a massive dataset of aerial imagery and LiDAR data to predict areas of occlusion. The model learns to identify features that typically hide underlying terrain or objects (e.g., tree canopies, building facades, fog banks). Inputs will include terrain slope, vegetation type, sensor readings, and potentially weather data. Outputs will be an occlusion probability map.
*   **Dynamic Mask Generation:** Use the occlusion probability map to generate a dynamic mask that covers areas predicted to be occluded. The mask will be overlaid on the virtual aerial map.
*   **Variable Mask Transparency:** Implement variable mask transparency based on the occlusion probability. Higher probability areas will have darker/more opaque masks, while lower probability areas will be more transparent, allowing a glimpse of the underlying terrain. The transparency level will be adjustable by the user.
*   **Multi-Layer Masking:** Enable multi-layer masking to represent different types of occlusion. For example, one layer could represent foliage occlusion, another building occlusion, and another weather-related occlusion. Each layer will have its own transparency settings.
*   **Object Recognition Integration:** Link the object recognition component (from claim 12) with the occlusion prediction model.  If an object is identified, the model can refine the occlusion mask around it. For example, identifying a specific building type can allow the system to predict the shape of its shadow and occlude areas accordingly.
*   **Data Streaming and Synchronization:** Establish a robust data streaming pipeline to receive sensor data from aerial vehicles in real-time. Implement data synchronization mechanisms to ensure that the virtual map is updated consistently.
*   **Processing Pipeline Pseudocode:**
    1.  Receive sensor data (LiDAR, imagery, radar) from aerial vehicle.
    2.  Perform sensor calibration and data fusion.
    3.  Generate point cloud representation of terrain and objects.
    4.  Run occlusion prediction model on point cloud and sensor data.
    5.  Generate occlusion probability map.
    6.  Generate dynamic mask based on occlusion probability map and transparency settings.
    7.  Overlay mask on virtual aerial map.
    8.  Update virtual aerial map with new sensor data and mask.
    9.  Repeat steps 1-8 in real-time.

*   **User Interface Elements:** Provide a UI to allow users to:
    *   Adjust mask transparency.
    *   Enable/disable different mask layers.
    *   Select different occlusion prediction algorithms.
    *   Visualize the occlusion probability map.
    *   Report false positives/negatives to improve the occlusion prediction model.
