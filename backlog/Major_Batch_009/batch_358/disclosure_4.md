## Temporal Key Shards & Distributed Entropy

**Concept:** Extend the durability concept by not just limiting the *lifetime* of a key, but fracturing it into multiple 'shards', each decryptable by a different, time-limited key.  These shards are distributed across geographically diverse, independent storage.  Reconstruction requires coordination of multiple time-sensitive decryption operations.

**Specs:**

*   **Shard Count (N):** Configurable parameter. Higher N increases security/complexity. Default: 5.
*   **Shard Size:**  Equal division of the original cryptographic key.
*   **Shard Encryption Keys (SEK):** Each shard is encrypted using a unique SEK.
*   **SEK Lifetimes (T<sub>i</sub>):**  Each SEK has an independently configurable lifetime.  Staggered lifetimes are crucial. (e.g., SEK<sub>1</sub>: 1 month, SEK<sub>2</sub>: 2 months, SEK<sub>3</sub>: 3 months, etc.)
*   **Storage Locations:** Shards are stored in physically separated, geographically diverse storage nodes. These nodes are ideally managed by separate entities.
*   **Coordination Service:** A secure coordination service (e.g., a distributed ledger/blockchain) maintains the mapping of shard locations, SEK identifiers, and valid SEK lifetimes.
*   **Reconstruction Protocol:**
    1.  Client requests key reconstruction.
    2.  Coordination service provides the locations of all N shards and the current SEK identifiers.
    3.  Client initiates parallel requests to each storage node for its shard.
    4.  Each storage node validates the SEK identifier and its lifetime (T<sub>i</sub>) against the coordination service.  If valid, the shard is returned *encrypted* with the SEK.
    5.  Client decrypts each shard using the corresponding SEK.
    6.  Client recombines the decrypted shards to reconstruct the original cryptographic key.
    7.  Expired SEKs invalidate shard access.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Protocol - Client Side):**

```
function reconstructKey(keyIdentifier):
    shardLocations, sekIdentifiers = coordinationService.getShardInfo(keyIdentifier)
    decryptedShards = []

    for i in range(len(shardLocations)):
        shard = storageNode.requestShard(shardLocations[i], sekIdentifiers[i])
        if shard:
            decryptedShards.append(decrypt(shard, sekIdentifiers[i]))
        else:
            print("Shard retrieval failed")
            return null

    reconstructedKey = recombineShards(decryptedShards)
    return reconstructedKey
```

**Security Considerations:**

*   **Threshold Cryptography:** Implement threshold cryptography to require a minimum number of valid SEK decryptions for reconstruction.  This mitigates the risk of a single compromised node.
*   **SEK Rotation:** Regularly rotate SEKs and redistribute shards.
*   **Storage Node Auditing:** Regularly audit storage nodes for compliance.
*   **Coordination Service Security:**  The coordination service *must* be highly secure and tamper-proof.
