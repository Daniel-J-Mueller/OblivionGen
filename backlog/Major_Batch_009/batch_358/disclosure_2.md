## Dynamic Highlight Personalization via Predictive Emotional Response

**Concept:** Extend dynamic highlight generation to *predict* user emotional response to potential highlights and personalize content selection accordingly. This goes beyond engagement metrics (rewinds, skips) to proactively cater to individual user preferences and potentially *influence* emotional state.

**Specifications:**

**1. Emotional Response Modeling:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Integrate biofeedback sensors (heart rate variability, skin conductance, facial expression analysis via webcam) into user devices.  Data will be anonymized and aggregated with user interaction data.
*   **Model Training:** Train a machine learning model (likely a recurrent neural network â€“ RNN with LSTM or GRU layers) to predict emotional response (valence & arousal) to media segments. Features:
    *   Segment-by-segment metadata (as defined in patent)
    *   User interaction data
    *   Biofeedback data (historical and real-time)
    *   Demographic/Preference Data (age, gender, stated interests)
*   **Personalization Profiles:**  Create user-specific emotional response profiles based on model predictions. This will establish a baseline understanding of what types of content evoke specific emotional states in each user.

**2. Predictive Highlight Selection:**

*   **Highlight Candidate Generation:**  As media streams, generate potential highlight clips based on existing quality scoring mechanisms (patent claims).
*   **Emotional Impact Prediction:** For each candidate clip, use the personalized emotional response model to predict the user's emotional response (valence & arousal).
*   **Personalized Scoring:** Combine the traditional quality score with the predicted emotional impact score.  Weightings for each score will be user-adjustable (e.g., prioritize "high excitement" or "calming" content).
*   **Highlight Selection & Sequencing:** Select the clips with the highest combined score, taking into account desired emotional arc.  Optionally, implement a "surprise" factor by occasionally selecting clips with moderate scores that deviate from the user's usual preferences.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Edge Processing:**  Biofeedback data processing and initial emotional response prediction will occur on the user device (edge computing) for privacy and reduced latency.
*   **Cloud-Based Model Training & Update:**  Aggregated and anonymized data will be used to retrain and improve the emotional response model in the cloud.  Updated models will be pushed to user devices.
*   **API Integration:**  Provide an API for third-party applications to access emotional response data (with user consent) for applications like mood-based music recommendations or personalized gaming experiences.

**Pseudocode (Highlight Selection Algorithm):**

```
function selectHighlights(mediaStream, userProfile) {
  candidateClips = generateCandidateClips(mediaStream);
  scoredClips = [];

  for each clip in candidateClips {
    qualityScore = calculateQualityScore(clip);
    emotionalImpact = predictEmotionalImpact(clip, userProfile);
    combinedScore = (qualityScore * weightQuality) + (emotionalImpact * weightEmotion);
    scoredClips.push({ clip: clip, score: combinedScore });
  }

  // Sort clips by score (descending)
  sortedClips = sortedClips.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score);

  // Select top N clips (configurable)
  selectedClips = sortedClips.slice(0, N);

  return selectedClips;
}
```

**Novelty:**

This concept moves beyond reactive highlight generation based on *observed* engagement to *proactive* personalization based on *predicted* emotional response.  The integration of biofeedback sensors and emotional response modeling represents a significant departure from existing approaches. It aims to create truly immersive and emotionally resonant media experiences.
