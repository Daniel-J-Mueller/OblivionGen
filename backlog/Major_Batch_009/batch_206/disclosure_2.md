## Dynamic Recipe Adaptation & Predictive Ingredient Ordering

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple item availability to dynamically adapt recipes *based* on real-time ingredient availability across multiple merchants, and proactively suggest/initiate ingredient ordering before the user even begins cooking.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time inventory feeds from multiple merchants (as per existing patent).
    *   Extensive recipe database (ingredient lists, quantities, preparation times, dietary restrictions).
    *   User preference profiles (dietary needs, preferred cuisines, disliked ingredients, skill level).
    *   Historical order data (user’s past purchases, frequently used ingredients).
*   **Core Functionality:**
    1.  **Recipe Input:** User selects a recipe (from database, imported, or manually entered).
    2.  **Availability Scan:** System scans merchant inventories for *all* recipe ingredients.
    3.  **Dynamic Adaptation:**  If an ingredient is unavailable, the system *automatically* suggests recipe adaptations (substitutions, ingredient omissions, quantity adjustments) while displaying a "deviation score" indicating how much the adaptation alters the original recipe. The user can preview the altered recipe.
    4.  **Predictive Ordering:** Based on user’s shopping habits, pantry inventory (user-maintained, or inferred via purchase history), and recipe selection, the system *predicts* which ingredients the user is likely to need. It proactively offers to order those ingredients (via a preferred merchant) *before* the user begins cooking.
    5.  **Multi-Merchant Optimization:**  The system identifies the optimal combination of merchants to fulfill the order, minimizing cost, delivery time, and the number of separate orders.
    6.  **"Pantry Mode":** The user can input their current pantry inventory. The system adjusts ingredient lists to prioritize using what the user *already* has, minimizing new purchases.
*   **User Interface:**
    *   Recipe view displays ingredient list with real-time availability indicators (color-coded).
    *   Adaptation suggestions are presented with clear explanations and deviation scores.
    *   Predictive order suggestions are displayed prominently.
    *   Shopping cart displays optimal merchant selection and total cost.
    *   Pantry management interface (optional).

**Pseudocode (Core Logic - Adaptation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION AdaptRecipe(recipe, merchantInventoryList):
  unavailableIngredients = []
  FOR ingredient IN recipe.ingredients:
    isAvailable = FALSE
    FOR merchantInventory IN merchantInventoryList:
      IF merchantInventory.hasIngredient(ingredient) AND merchantInventory.quantity >= ingredient.quantity:
        isAvailable = TRUE
        break
    IF NOT isAvailable:
      unavailableIngredients.append(ingredient)

  IF unavailableIngredients.isEmpty():
    RETURN recipe // No adaptation needed

  adaptationSuggestions = []
  FOR unavailableIngredient IN unavailableIngredients:
    substitutes = FindSubstitutes(unavailableIngredient) // Uses a knowledge graph or database
    FOR substitute IN substitutes:
      adaptation = CreateAdaptation(recipe, unavailableIngredient, substitute)
      adaptation.deviationScore = CalculateDeviationScore(recipe, adaptation)
      adaptationSuggestions.append(adaptation)

  //Rank suggestions by deviation score, user preferences, and cost.
  rankedSuggestions = RankAdaptationSuggestions(adaptationSuggestions, userPreferences)
  RETURN rankedSuggestions[0] // Return the best adaptation.
```

**Novelty:** Existing systems focus on *reacting* to item unavailability. This proactively *adapts* the recipe and anticipates ingredient needs *before* the user even starts cooking. It transforms the experience from passive shopping to proactive culinary planning. This shifts the paradigm from ‘what’s available’ to ‘what can I make, given my preferences and available resources’.
