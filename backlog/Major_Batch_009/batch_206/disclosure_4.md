## Dynamic Resource Prefetching Based on Predicted User Interaction

**Specification:** A system for intelligently prefetching embedded resources based not just on consolidated request patterns (as in the provided patent), but on *predicted* user interaction with content displaying those resources. This moves beyond optimization of loading *existing* requests to proactively preparing for *future* user actions.

**Core Concept:** Analyze user interaction data (mouse movements, scroll speed, dwell time on elements, predicted gaze direction via webcam) to anticipate which embedded resources will be needed *before* the user explicitly requests them. This involves a probabilistic model of user behavior.

**System Components:**

1.  **Interaction Tracker:** Captures user interaction data.  Can operate with varying levels of granularity (e.g., coarse-grained scroll tracking vs. precise gaze direction).
2.  **Behavioral Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., recurrent neural network, long short-term memory network) trained on a corpus of user interaction data. This model predicts the probability of a user interacting with a specific element (and therefore needing the associated embedded resources) within a defined time window. The model outputs a 'request likelihood score'.
3.  **Resource Prefetcher:**  Responsible for proactively fetching resources based on the request likelihood score.  A threshold score triggers prefetching. Prefetching can be prioritized based on the score and resource size (smaller, high-probability resources fetched first).
4.  **Resource Cache:** A local cache to store prefetched resources.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Interaction Tracker - continuously running in the background
loop:
    interactionData = captureUserInteraction()
    emitInteractionData(interactionData)

// Behavioral Model - periodically updates based on emitted data
function updateModel(interactionData):
    trainModel(interactionData)
    return predictedRequestLikelihoodScores

// Resource Prefetcher - runs on a timer or event-driven
function prefetchResources():
    requestLikelihoodScores = behavioralModel.predict()
    for each resource, score in requestLikelihoodScores:
        if score > prefetchThreshold:
            if resource not in resourceCache:
                fetchResource(resource)
                storeResource(resourceCache, resource)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `interactionData`:  A timestamped record of user actions (e.g., mouse coordinates, scroll delta, gaze position, element hovered).
*   `resourceCache`:  A key-value store where the key is the resource URL and the value is the cached resource content.
*   `requestLikelihoodScores`: Dictionary mapping resource URLs to predicted request likelihood scores (probability between 0 and 1).

**Refinements & Considerations:**

*   **Adaptive Threshold:** Adjust the `prefetchThreshold` dynamically based on network conditions, user device capabilities, and past prefetching success rates.
*   **Personalized Models:** Train individual behavioral models for each user to improve prediction accuracy.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Incorporate contextual information (e.g., time of day, user location, device type) into the behavioral model.
*   **Resource Prioritization:** Prioritize prefetching based on resource size, predicted impact on user experience, and network bandwidth availability.
*    **Cancelation Mechanism**: A system for canceling prefetched resources if the user does not interact with the expected content.
