## Adaptive Renderer Granularity

**Specification:**

**Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust the granularity of renderer processes based on content complexity *and* user interaction patterns. The existing patent focuses on splitting browser/renderer, and assigning a renderer *per tab/window*. This expands on that by allowing *sub-renderer* processes within a single tab/window.

**Components:**

*   **Content Complexity Analyzer:** A module within the renderer system that analyzes incoming content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) *before* rendering. It assigns a "Complexity Score" based on factors like:
    *   DOM size & depth
    *   Number of active JavaScript event listeners
    *   CSS animation/transition count & complexity
    *   Use of WebGL/Canvas/Video elements
    *   External resource count & size
*   **Interaction Pattern Monitor:** A module that tracks user interactions *within* a tab/window:
    *   Scrolling speed & frequency
    *   Mouse movement patterns (e.g., rapid vs. deliberate)
    *   Keyboard input rate
    *   Frequency of DOM manipulations triggered by user actions
*   **Granularity Manager:** The central control module that utilizes the Complexity Score and Interaction Patterns to determine the optimal number of sub-renderer processes.
*   **Sub-Renderer Processes:** Lightweight renderer processes responsible for rendering specific portions of the DOM. These are *smaller* and *faster* to start/stop than traditional renderer processes.
*   **Communication Bridge:** A high-performance inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism for coordinating sub-renderer processes and the main renderer process.  Utilizes shared memory where appropriate to minimize overhead.
*   **Resource Governor:**  Manages CPU, memory, and GPU resources allocated to each sub-renderer process, preventing resource starvation.

**Operational Flow:**

1.  **Content Analysis:** Upon receiving content for a tab/window, the Content Complexity Analyzer calculates the Complexity Score.
2.  **Initial Granularity:** Based on the Complexity Score, the Granularity Manager determines an initial number of sub-renderer processes.  A low score might result in a single process, while a high score might trigger multiple.
3.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The Interaction Pattern Monitor continuously tracks user interactions.
    *   **High Interaction / High Complexity:** The Granularity Manager *splits* existing sub-renderer processes or *creates* new ones to distribute the rendering load.
    *   **Low Interaction / Low Complexity:** The Granularity Manager *merges* sub-renderer processes to reduce overhead.
4.  **Rendering Delegation:**  The main renderer process divides the DOM tree into sections and assigns each section to a sub-renderer process.
5.  **Composition:** Sub-renderer processes render their assigned sections and transmit the resulting bitmaps (or other rendering formats) to the main renderer process. The main renderer process composes the individual bitmaps into the final rendered image and displays it to the user.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Manager):**

```
function determine_granularity(complexity_score, interaction_pattern) {
  base_granularity = 1  // Start with one process

  if (complexity_score > HIGH_THRESHOLD) {
    base_granularity = 4
  } else if (complexity_score > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
    base_granularity = 2
  }

  if (interaction_pattern == HIGH_ACTIVITY) {
    base_granularity = base_granularity * 2  // Double granularity
  } else if (interaction_pattern == LOW_ACTIVITY) {
    base_granularity = max(1, base_granularity / 2) // Halve granularity
  }

  return base_granularity
}

function adjust_granularity(current_granularity, complexity_score, interaction_pattern) {
  target_granularity = determine_granularity(complexity_score, interaction_pattern)

  if (target_granularity > current_granularity) {
    // Split existing processes or create new ones
  } else if (target_granularity < current_granularity) {
    // Merge processes
  }
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Responsiveness:** Distributing the rendering load across multiple processes can reduce lag and improve responsiveness, especially for complex pages.
*   **Reduced Resource Usage:** Dynamically adjusting the granularity allows the system to allocate resources more efficiently, reducing CPU and memory usage.
*   **Enhanced Stability:** Isolating rendering tasks into separate processes can prevent a single crash from bringing down the entire browser.
*   **Scalability:** Enables the browser to handle increasingly complex web applications and content.
