**Dynamic Product Lifecycle Notifications & Automated Resale Offers**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Extend the purchase history data beyond simply prompting resale. Implement a system that predicts *when* a product’s value will peak or decline based on real-time data (market trends, competitor pricing, social media sentiment, product updates/replacements) and proactively offers automated resale options to the user at the optimal time.

**II. Data Inputs:**

*   **Purchase History:** (From existing system) – Items purchased, date of purchase, price paid.
*   **Real-time Market Data:** Integration with external APIs (eBay, Amazon, StockX, etc.) to track current resale prices for similar items.
*   **Product Lifecycle Data:** Web scraping/API access to manufacturer websites/databases to track product updates, revisions, end-of-life announcements.
*   **Social Media Sentiment Analysis:** Track mentions of the product on social media platforms (Twitter, Reddit, Facebook) to gauge public interest and demand.
*   **User Preferences:** Allow users to set preferred resale timelines (e.g., “Resell when the price reaches X,” “Resell after 6 months,” “Resell if the price drops below Y”).

**III. System Architecture:**

1.  **Data Collection Module:** Gathers data from all sources listed above.
2.  **Predictive Modeling Engine:** Employs machine learning algorithms (time series analysis, regression models) to predict future resale values based on historical data and real-time trends.
3.  **Automated Offer Generation Module:** Generates personalized resale offers to users, including:
    *   Predicted resale price.
    *   Estimated fees.
    *   Shipping options.
    *   A single-click “Accept Offer” button.
4.  **Listing Management Module:** Automatically creates and manages the listing on the marketplace (or integrated external platforms) upon user acceptance. Handles all aspects of listing creation, optimization, and updates.
5.  **User Interface:** A dedicated section within the marketplace app/website where users can view their eligible products, predicted resale values, and available offers.

**IV. Pseudocode:**

```
// For each user in the system:
FOR EACH user IN userDatabase:

    // Get the user's purchase history
    purchaseHistory = getUserPurchaseHistory(user.id)

    // For each item in the purchase history:
    FOR EACH item IN purchaseHistory:

        // Fetch real-time data for the item
        marketData = fetchMarketData(item.productId)
        productLifecycleData = fetchProductLifecycleData(item.productId)
        socialMediaData = fetchSocialMediaData(item.productId)

        // Predict future resale value
        predictedResaleValue = predictResaleValue(marketData, productLifecycleData, socialMediaData)

        // Check if the predicted value meets the user's preferences
        IF predictedResaleValue > user.minimumResalePrice OR
           timeSincePurchase(item) > user.minimumResaleTime:

            // Generate a personalized resale offer
            offer = generateResaleOffer(item, predictedResaleValue)

            // Send the offer to the user
            sendResaleOffer(user, offer)
```

**V. Advanced Features:**

*   **Dynamic Pricing Adjustments:** Automatically adjust listing prices based on market fluctuations and competitor pricing.
*   **Bundle Offers:** Suggest bundling multiple items for resale to increase overall value.
*   **Automated Shipping Label Generation:** Integrate with shipping carriers to automatically generate and print shipping labels.
*   **Gamification:** Reward users for actively managing their resale listings and achieving high resale values.
