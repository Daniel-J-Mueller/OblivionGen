## Adaptive Priority Scheduling with Predictive Drift Correction

**Concept:** Extend the clock monitoring concept to dynamically adjust task priorities *before* significant clock drift impacts performance, leveraging predictive modeling of drift rates and task sensitivity. This isn't just about delaying recovery, it’s about proactively reshaping the execution landscape.

**Specifications:**

**1. Drift Rate Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical clock value data (timestamp pairs from reference clock and application). Minimum data requirement: 60 seconds of data, sampled at 10Hz.
*   **Algorithm:** Implement a Kalman filter to predict future clock drift rate. Parameters: Process noise (Q) and Measurement noise (R) must be configurable. Initial estimates for drift rate and variance required.
*   **Output:** Predicted clock drift rate (samples/second) with associated confidence interval.  Output frequency: 1Hz.

**2. Task Sensitivity Profiler:**

*   **Input:** Application task list with estimated execution time and data dependency graph. Each task is assigned a ‘drift sensitivity’ score (0-100), determined empirically or through static analysis. High score = Highly sensitive to timing variations.
*   **Output:**  A sorted list of tasks based on drift sensitivity, along with each task’s estimated completion time.

**3. Adaptive Priority Scheduler:**

*   **Input:** Predicted drift rate, drift sensitivity task list, and current system load.
*   **Logic:**
    *   **Drift Thresholds:** Define three drift thresholds: Low, Medium, High. These thresholds correspond to acceptable drift rates based on system performance testing.
    *   **Priority Adjustment:**
        *   **Low Drift:** Maintain normal task priorities.
        *   **Medium Drift:**  Increase priority of high-sensitivity tasks by a configurable percentage (e.g., 10-20%). Lower priority of non-critical tasks.
        *   **High Drift:**  Aggressively prioritize high-sensitivity tasks, potentially pre-empting lower-priority tasks. Temporarily suspend non-essential background processes.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** Re-evaluate drift rate and task priorities every 500ms.
*   **Output:**  Updated task priority list for the OS scheduler.

**4.  Data Buffering & Rollback Mechanism:**

*   **Buffer Creation:** Create small circular buffers for critical data associated with high-sensitivity tasks.
*   **Versioning:** Timestamp each data version stored in the buffer.
*   **Rollback Trigger:** If drift exceeds a critical threshold *despite* priority adjustments, initiate a rollback to the last valid data version in the buffer. (This is a last-resort measure).

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Priority Scheduler):**

```
function adjust_priorities(drift_rate, task_list, system_load):
  if drift_rate < LOW_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
    return task_list  // No change

  elif drift_rate < MEDIUM_DRIFT_THRESHOLD:
    // Increase priority of high-sensitivity tasks
    for task in task_list:
      if task.drift_sensitivity > 50:
        task.priority += 10  // Configurable value

  else:
    // Aggressive prioritization and suspension
    for task in task_list:
      if task.drift_sensitivity > 70:
        task.priority = MAX_PRIORITY

    // Suspend non-essential tasks
    suspend_background_processes()

  return task_list
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Real-time clock source with high precision.
*   Operating system with process priority control.
*   Ability to monitor system load.
*   Low-latency communication between clock monitor and scheduler.
*   Configurable parameters for drift thresholds and priority adjustments.
