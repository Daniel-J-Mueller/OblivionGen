## Adaptive Color Filtering via Micro-Resonator Arrays

**Specification:** An electrowetting display enhancement system utilizing arrays of tunable micro-resonators positioned *above* each electrowetting pixel, for dynamic color and brightness adjustment.

**Components:**

*   **Micro-Resonator Array:** A grid of individually addressable micro-resonators (approx. 50-100Î¼m diameter) fabricated from a material with a high refractive index (e.g., silicon nitride, titanium dioxide). Each resonator is a micro-cavity designed to exhibit resonant light interference.
*   **Piezoelectric Actuators:** Each micro-resonator is coupled to a micro-piezoelectric actuator. Applying a voltage to the actuator alters the physical distance between the resonator surfaces, tuning its resonant frequency.
*   **Transparent Electrode Layer:** A transparent conductive layer (e.g., ITO, graphene) deposited *below* the piezoelectric actuators. This layer serves as the electrode for applying voltage and controlling the resonator spacing.
*   **Control Circuitry:** Integrated circuit (IC) for addressing individual micro-resonators and controlling the applied voltage.  Includes a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for precision voltage control and a memory for storing resonator control profiles.
*   **Display Backlight:** Existing or modified display backlight.

**Operation:**

1.  The display backlight provides illumination.
2.  Light passes through the electrowetting pixel and then through the micro-resonator array.
3.  The control circuitry, driven by display image data, applies voltages to the piezoelectric actuators.
4.  Changing the voltage alters the spacing between the resonator surfaces, shifting the resonant frequency of each resonator.
5.  The resonators selectively enhance or attenuate specific wavelengths of light, dynamically filtering the color and brightness of the light passing through each pixel.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// For each pixel (x, y) in the display:

    // Read RGB values from image data
    redValue = image.getRed(x, y)
    greenValue = image.getGreen(x, y)
    blueValue = image.getBlue(x, y)

    // Calculate target resonator frequencies for each color channel
    redFrequency = calculateFrequency(redValue, baseFrequency)
    greenFrequency = calculateFrequency(greenValue, baseFrequency)
    blueFrequency = calculateFrequency(blueValue, baseFrequency)

    // Convert frequencies to voltage levels
    redVoltage = frequencyToVoltage(redFrequency)
    greenVoltage = frequencyToVoltage(greenFrequency)
    blueVoltage = frequencyToVoltage(blueFrequency)

    // Apply voltages to corresponding resonators
    setResonatorVoltage(x, y, redChannel, redVoltage)
    setResonatorVoltage(x, y, greenChannel, greenVoltage)
    setResonatorVoltage(x, y, blueChannel, blueVoltage)

// Function calculateFrequency(colorValue, baseFrequency):
//    Returns the target resonator frequency based on the color value
//    and a predefined base frequency.  Linear or non-linear mapping.

// Function frequencyToVoltage(frequency):
//    Maps the target frequency to a corresponding voltage level
//    for the piezoelectric actuator. Calibration required.
```

**Enhancements/Considerations:**

*   **Polarization Control:** Introduce polarization filters integrated into the resonator structure for additional color control and contrast enhancement.
*   **Subpixel Integration:** Divide each pixel into subpixels, each with its own micro-resonator array for even finer color control.
*   **Multi-Layer Resonators:** Stack multiple resonator layers to expand the range of achievable colors and brightness levels.
*   **Dynamic Calibration:** Implement a dynamic calibration routine to compensate for variations in manufacturing and environmental conditions.
*   **Power Optimization:** Optimize the control algorithm to minimize power consumption by selectively activating resonators only when needed.
