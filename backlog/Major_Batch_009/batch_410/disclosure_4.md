## Haptic Audio Localization System

**Concept:** A system that combines audio playback with localized haptic feedback to create a more immersive and precise sense of sound source location. This builds on the concept of delay-based audio synchronization but extends it to physical sensation.

**Specs:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Multi-channel audio output system (existing from patent).
    *   Array of micro-actuators distributed across a surface (e.g., a chair, a headset, a dedicated panel). These actuators could be ultrasonic transducers, small vibration motors, or electroactive polymers.
    *   Central processing unit (CPU) with high-speed digital signal processing (DSP) capabilities.
    *   Precision time synchronization module (e.g., PTP – Precision Time Protocol – compatible hardware).
*   **Operation:**
    1.  **Sound Source Decomposition:** Incoming audio is analyzed to decompose the sound field into individual sound sources (using beamforming or other sound source separation techniques).
    2.  **Localization:** For each identified sound source, the system calculates its 3D location relative to the listener (using microphone arrays or other positioning systems).
    3.  **Haptic Mapping:** The calculated location is mapped to a corresponding location on the array of micro-actuators.
    4.  **Time-Aligned Activation:**  Crucially, the activation of the micro-actuators is *precisely* time-aligned with the corresponding audio output. This is where the delay calculation from the original patent comes in. The system determines the time it takes for the audio to reach the listener *and* the time it takes for the haptic sensation to be perceived (this will require calibration for each user and actuator type).
    5.  **Haptic Pulse Generation:** A short, focused haptic pulse is generated by the activated actuators. The intensity of the pulse is proportional to the perceived loudness of the sound source.
    6.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors the listener's head position (using a head tracker) and adjusts the haptic mapping accordingly to maintain accurate localization.
*   **Software Architecture:**
    *   **Audio Processing Module:** Responsible for sound source decomposition, localization, and audio output.
    *   **Haptic Control Module:** Manages the actuator array, generates haptic pulses, and synchronizes haptic output with audio output.
    *   **Calibration Module:**  Determines the optimal delay and intensity settings for each actuator and user.
    *   **Communication Module:** Facilitates communication between the audio and haptic control modules and the head tracker.
*   **Pseudocode (Haptic Control Module):**

```
function generateHapticPulse(sourceLocation, audioDelay, pulseIntensity):
    actuatorLocation = mapLocationToActuator(sourceLocation)
    activationTime = currentTime + audioDelay + calibrationDelay(actuatorLocation)
    scheduleActuatorActivation(actuatorLocation, activationTime, pulseIntensity)

function scheduleActuatorActivation(actuatorLocation, activationTime, pulseIntensity):
    // Use a real-time scheduler to ensure accurate timing
    scheduleTask(activationTime, function():
        activateActuator(actuatorLocation, pulseIntensity)
        deactivateActuator(actuatorLocation)
    )
```

*   **Potential Applications:**
    *   Gaming: Enhanced immersion and spatial awareness.
    *   Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality: More realistic and engaging experiences.
    *   Assistive Technology: Providing directional cues for visually impaired individuals.
    *   Sound Design: Creating more immersive and compelling soundscapes.
