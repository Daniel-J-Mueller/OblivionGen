## Dynamic Task Dependency Graph Generation & Predictive Sharding

**Concept:** Expand the shard-based task distribution beyond simple criteria-based assignment to incorporate *dynamic dependency graphs* representing relationships between tasks.  Predictive sharding adjusts shard assignments *during* job execution based on real-time dependency resolution and worker load.

**Specification:**

**I. Dependency Graph Builder:**

*   **Input:** Raw task list in first format (as per patent). Each task includes metadata defining dependencies on other tasks (task IDs).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Parse tasks to build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing task dependencies. Nodes are tasks, edges represent dependencies (Task A -> Task B means Task A must complete before Task B).
    2.  Identify critical paths within the DAG â€“ the longest sequence of dependent tasks.
    3.  Estimate task execution time (based on historical data or profiling).
*   **Output:**  Dependency graph (DAG) with estimated execution times for each task.  Critical path highlighted.

**II. Predictive Sharding Engine:**

*   **Input:** Dependency graph, initial shard assignments (based on initial criteria, as in the patent), real-time worker load data (CPU, memory, I/O utilization).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Shard Rebalancing:** Continuously monitor worker loads. If a worker becomes overloaded, identify tasks assigned to that worker that *can* be moved to underutilized workers *without* violating dependencies.
    2.  **Critical Path Prioritization:**  Tasks on the critical path are given priority. If a worker responsible for a critical path task is overloaded, aggressively move non-critical path tasks from that worker.
    3.  **Dependency-Aware Movement:**  When moving tasks, ensure all dependencies are met.  If moving Task B, verify all tasks Task B depends on have already completed or are scheduled on the same worker.
    4.  **Predictive Assignment:**  Based on historical data and real-time worker performance, *predict* future bottlenecks.  Pre-emptively move tasks to avoid those bottlenecks.  (e.g., if a worker historically slows down during certain I/O-intensive operations, move tasks requiring I/O away from that worker *before* the slowdown occurs).
*   **Output:** Updated shard assignments, dynamically adjusted during job execution.

**III. Communication Protocol:**

*   **Shard Manager:** Central component responsible for managing shard assignments and communicating changes to workers.
*   **Worker Notification:**  Workers subscribe to shard updates. When a worker's assigned tasks change, the Shard Manager pushes the updated task list to that worker.
*   **Dependency Tracking:** Workers maintain a local cache of task dependencies. Before starting a task, they verify all dependencies are met. If not, they request the Shard Manager to prioritize the dependent tasks.

**Pseudocode (Shard Manager):**

```
function update_shard_assignments(dependency_graph, worker_loads):
  for worker in workers:
    tasks = worker.get_assigned_tasks()
    for task in tasks:
      if worker_load(worker) > threshold:
        // Find movable tasks that do not violate dependencies
        movable_tasks = find_movable_tasks(task, dependency_graph, workers)
        if movable_tasks:
          move_task(task, movable_tasks)
```

**Expansion Considerations:**

*   **Integration with existing storage layer:** Leverage information about data locality to further optimize shard assignments.
*   **Machine learning for prediction:**  Use machine learning models to predict task execution times and worker loads more accurately.
*   **Fault tolerance:** Implement mechanisms to handle worker failures and ensure job completion.
