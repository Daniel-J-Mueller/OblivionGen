## Dynamic Multipath Group Composition via Predictive Analytics

**Concept:** Extend the existing multipath routing by incorporating predictive analytics to *proactively* compose and decompose multipath groups *before* congestion occurs, and to dynamically adjust hash ranges based on predicted traffic patterns. This moves beyond reactive congestion avoidance to proactive traffic steering.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Traffic Prediction Module:**
    *   Input: Historical network traffic data (flow statistics, destination addresses, time of day, day of week, etc.), real-time traffic snapshots, and potentially external data sources (e.g., scheduled events, known network outages).
    *   Function: Utilize machine learning models (e.g., time series forecasting, regression models, neural networks) to predict future traffic demand on each interface and for each destination. Output a probability distribution of expected traffic volume for each interface over a defined prediction horizon (e.g., 5-15 minutes).
    *   Output:  Predicted traffic volume for each interface, expressed as a probability distribution over time.

2.  **Multipath Group Composer/Decomposer:**
    *   Input: Predicted traffic volume from the Traffic Prediction Module, current multipath group configurations, interface capacities, and cost metrics (e.g., latency, bandwidth cost).
    *   Function:  Dynamically create, modify, and delete multipath groups based on predicted demand. 
        *   If predicted demand on a specific interface exceeds a threshold, *proactively* create a new multipath group that *excludes* that interface.  
        *   If demand on multiple interfaces is predicted to be low, merge existing multipath groups to reduce routing table complexity.
        *   Employ optimization algorithms (e.g., genetic algorithms, simulated annealing) to find the optimal multipath group configuration that minimizes cost and maximizes throughput, based on predicted traffic patterns.
    *   Output: New or modified multipath group configurations.

3.  **Dynamic Hash Range Adjustment:**
    *   Input: Multipath group configurations, predicted traffic volume per interface, and real-time traffic statistics.
    *   Function:  Adjust the size and mapping of hash value ranges within each multipath group *before* congestion occurs.
        *   If an interface is predicted to experience increased traffic, *reduce* the range of hash values mapped to that interface, effectively diverting traffic to other interfaces within the group.  The unassigned hash ranges can be distributed to other interfaces.
        *   If an interface is predicted to experience decreased traffic, *increase* the range of hash values mapped to that interface to utilize available capacity.
        *   Implement a feedback loop: Monitor actual traffic on each interface and adjust hash ranges accordingly, refining the prediction model over time.
    *   Output: Updated hash value range mappings for each multipath group.

4. **Routing Table Manager:**
    * Input: Modified Multipath Group Configurations and Hash range mappings.
    * Function: Based on the new configurations, updates the routing table accordingly. 
    * Output: New Routing Table.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Hash Range Adjustment):**

```
function adjustHashRanges(multipathGroup, predictedTraffic, realTimeTraffic):
  for each interface in multipathGroup:
    predictedLoad = predictedTraffic[interface]
    realTimeLoad = realTimeTraffic[interface]

    targetLoad = (predictedLoad + realTimeLoad) / 2  // Blend prediction and reality

    currentHashRangeSize = getHashRangeSize(interface)

    if targetLoad > threshold:
      newHashRangeSize = currentHashRangeSize * reductionFactor // Reduce range
      redistributeHashRange(interface, newHashRangeSize)
    else if targetLoad < threshold:
      newHashRangeSize = currentHashRangeSize * expansionFactor // Increase range
      addHashRange(interface, newHashRangeSize)
    end if
  end for
end function
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The Traffic Prediction Module requires significant data collection and model training.
*   Dynamic Hash Range Adjustment needs to be performed efficiently to avoid introducing latency.
*   A robust monitoring system is crucial to track traffic patterns and refine the prediction model.
*   Consider incorporating Quality of Service (QoS) metrics into the optimization algorithms to prioritize critical traffic.
