## Adaptive Propeller Aerofoil Control System

**System Overview:** A closed-loop system utilizing micro-actuated, variable-geometry aerofoil sections on each propeller blade to optimize performance based on real-time flight conditions and individual blade load. This builds upon the idea of tracking propeller speed/angle but *controls* the propeller shape itself, rather than simply measuring.

**Core Components:**

*   **Micro-Actuator Network:** Each propeller blade will be composed of numerous small, independently controllable sections. These sections will utilize Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) or piezoelectric actuators embedded within a polymer matrix forming the blade surface.
*   **Strain Sensor Array:** A network of miniature strain gauges will be embedded *within* each blade section, measuring local aerodynamic loads and deflections.
*   **Edge Computing Unit:** A dedicated, low-power processor located near the propulsion system. This unit will execute algorithms for sensor data fusion, blade shape optimization, and actuator control.
*   **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU):** Integrated IMU data provides overall flight attitude and acceleration for predictive control.
*   **Communication Bus:** High-speed, reliable communication bus (e.g., EtherCAT) to transmit sensor data and control signals between the edge computing unit and the actuator network.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Initialization:** System calibrates actuator range and sensor offsets during pre-flight checks.
2.  **Sensor Data Acquisition:** Strain sensors continuously measure aerodynamic loads on each blade section. IMU provides overall flight attitude and acceleration.
3.  **Load Analysis:** Edge computing unit fuses sensor data to create a real-time map of aerodynamic loads across each blade.
4.  **Blade Shape Optimization:** A control algorithm calculates the optimal shape for each blade section, aiming to:
    *   Minimize drag.
    *   Maximize lift.
    *   Distribute load evenly across the blade.
    *   Compensate for asymmetric flight conditions (e.g., wind gusts, turning maneuvers).
5.  **Actuator Control:** The control algorithm sends commands to the micro-actuators, adjusting the shape of each blade section.
6.  **Closed-Loop Feedback:** The system continuously monitors strain sensor data and adjusts actuator commands to maintain optimal blade shape and performance.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Control Loop):**

```
FOR EACH bladeSection IN blade:
    read strainData FROM bladeSection.strainSensors
    calculate targetShape BASED ON strainData, flightConditions, & optimizationGoals
    calculate actuatorCommands TO achieve targetShape
    send actuatorCommands TO bladeSection.microActuators
    END FOR
```

**Hardware Specifications (Per Blade):**

*   **Actuator Density:** 50-100 actuators per meter of blade length.
*   **Actuator Type:** Miniature SMA or Piezoelectric actuators.
*   **Strain Gauge Type:** Piezo-resistive strain gauges.
*   **Processor:** Embedded ARM Cortex-M7 processor with dedicated DSP capabilities.
*   **Communication Protocol:** EtherCAT.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced Aerodynamic Efficiency: Optimized blade shape for various flight conditions.
*   Improved Maneuverability: Asymmetric blade control for precise and responsive handling.
*   Reduced Vibration: Load distribution to minimize blade flutter and resonance.
*   Increased Payload Capacity: Higher lift generation.
*   Extended Flight Time: Lower energy consumption.

**Expansion Considerations:**

*   AI-Powered Shape Optimization: Implement machine learning algorithms to learn optimal blade shapes from flight data.
*   Adaptive Flight Control: Integrate the system with the flight control system to enable advanced maneuvers and stabilization.
*   Active Flutter Suppression: Develop algorithms to actively suppress blade flutter in real-time.
*   Morphing Propeller Geometry: Investigate the feasibility of dynamically changing the overall propeller diameter and pitch.
