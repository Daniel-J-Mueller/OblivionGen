## Dynamic Widget Stacking & Anticipatory Skill Loading

**Concept:** Extend multi-modal widget interaction beyond simple context awareness to a dynamic, stackable widget system anticipating user needs *before* explicit input. This system proactively loads relevant skill components, minimizing latency and enhancing responsiveness.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Structures:**

*   **Widget Stack:** A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure representing currently active widgets. Each entry contains:
    *   `widgetID`: Unique identifier for the widget.
    *   `skillID`: Associated skill identifier.
    *   `contentSnapshot`: Current displayed content (text, images, data).
    *   `activationTime`: Timestamp of widget activation.
    *   `predictedIntentScore`: A probability score based on historical use, current context, and observed user behavior.
*   **Skill Prefetch Queue:** A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) queue storing `skillID`s to be preloaded into memory.
*   **Context Vector:** A numerical representation of the user's current state, incorporating:
    *   Time of day.
    *   Location (if permission granted).
    *   Recent application usage.
    *   Calendar events.
    *   Social media activity (optional, permission-based).
    *   Widget Stack state.

**2. System Components:**

*   **Context Analyzer:** Responsible for generating the `Context Vector` by integrating data from various sources.
*   **Intent Prediction Engine:** Uses machine learning (e.g., recurrent neural network) trained on historical widget interaction data to predict the user's next likely intent, given the `Context Vector` and `Widget Stack`. Outputs a list of `skillID`s with associated probabilities.
*   **Skill Loader:** Manages loading and unloading skill components into memory. Prioritizes skills based on the Intent Prediction Engine's output and actively maintains a buffer of frequently used skills.
*   **Widget Manager:** Handles the creation, destruction, stacking, and presentation of multi-modal widgets.
*   **ASR/NLU Module:** Standard speech recognition and natural language understanding for voice input.

**3. Workflow:**

1.  **Context Capture:** The Context Analyzer continuously updates the `Context Vector`.
2.  **Intent Prediction:** The Intent Prediction Engine analyzes the `Context Vector` and `Widget Stack` to predict the most likely user intents.
3.  **Skill Prefetch:** The Skill Loader proactively loads skill components corresponding to the predicted intents into memory, adding them to the Skill Prefetch Queue.
4.  **Widget Interaction:** User interacts with a widget (voice, touch, gesture).
5.  **ASR/NLU Processing:** Speech input is processed by the ASR/NLU module.
6.  **Skill Selection:** The system selects the appropriate skill component based on the NLU data and the currently active widget. If the predicted skill is already loaded (from the Skill Prefetch Queue), skill loading latency is minimized.
7.  **Output Generation:** The selected skill component generates output data.
8.  **Widget Update:** The Widget Manager updates the active widget with the output data.
9.  **Stack Management:** Widget stacking happens on activation, with the newest widget added to the top of the stack. Interaction with a widget brings it to the foreground. Dismissal removes it from the stack.

**4. Pseudocode (Skill Prefetch Logic):**

```
function prefetchSkills(contextVector, widgetStack):
  intentPredictions = IntentPredictionEngine.predict(contextVector, widgetStack)
  skillQueue = []
  for prediction in intentPredictions:
    skillID = prediction.skillID
    probability = prediction.probability
    if skillID not in SkillLoader.loadedSkills and skillID not in skillQueue:
      skillQueue.append(skillID)
  SkillLoader.loadSkills(skillQueue)
```

**5. Novel Aspects:**

*   **Proactive Skill Loading:** Pre-loading skills based on predicted intent significantly reduces latency.
*   **Dynamic Widget Stack:** The LIFO stack manages widget context efficiently.
*   **Contextual Intent Prediction:** Combining user context, historical data, and widget state improves prediction accuracy.
*   **Multi-layered Context:** Combining time, location, app usage, and calendar events for a more holistic understanding of user needs.
