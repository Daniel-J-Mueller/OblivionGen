## Adaptive Data Sharding with Predictive Consistency

**Concept:** Extend the "object" focus of the patent towards a proactive, sharded architecture where data is not merely stored in objects, but *predictively* sharded across multiple storage nodes *before* a transaction even begins, based on access patterns and anticipated modifications. This moves beyond reactive recovery and unlocks potential for massive parallelization.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** *Predictive Sharding Engine (PSE)* – A system process running alongside (or integrated with) the Agent Server.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   *Access Pattern Database (APD):* Time-series data logging all reads/writes to objects, including timestamps, user/process ID, geographic location (if applicable), and request type.
    *   *Shard Map:*  A dynamic mapping of objects to physical storage nodes (shards). This map is *constantly* updated by the PSE.
    *   *Consistency Vector:*  A vector associated with each object, representing the shards currently holding valid data.
*   **Algorithm – PSE Operation:**
    1.  **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor APD for access patterns.
    2.  **Prediction:**  Utilize time-series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future access rates for each object.
    3.  **Shard Assignment:** Based on predicted access rates and available shard capacity, dynamically assign objects to shards. Prioritize shards geographically closest to predicted request origins.
    4.  **Replication:** Replicate objects to multiple shards based on predicted concurrency and failure tolerance requirements. (e.g., 3-way replication for critical data).
    5.  **Pre-Fetching:** Based on transaction history, predict the objects likely to be accessed in a future transaction and *pre-fetch* them to shards closest to the initiating client.
    6.  **Shard Map Update:**  Update the Shard Map with new shard assignments and replication status.
*   **Transaction Flow Modification:**
    1.  **Transaction Initiation:** When a transaction is initiated, the Agent Server *first* consults the Shard Map.
    2.  **Shard Access:** The Agent Server directly accesses the relevant shards for all objects involved in the transaction *in parallel*.
    3.  **Local Operations:**  Each shard performs its portion of the transaction locally.
    4.  **Consistency Protocol:** Implement a distributed consensus protocol (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure data consistency across all shards.
    5.  **Commit/Rollback:** Once all shards have completed their operations, the transaction is either committed or rolled back atomically.
*   **Recovery Enhancement:**
    *   **Partial Failure:** If a shard fails, the transaction can continue on the remaining shards, as data is replicated.
    *   **Reduced Recovery Time:**  Recovery is significantly faster, as only a small portion of the data needs to be recovered from replicas.

**Pseudocode (Agent Server – Transaction Initiation):**

```
function initiateTransaction(transactionRequest):
  shardMap = getShardMap()
  objects = transactionRequest.getObjects()
  parallelTasks = []

  for object in objects:
    shard = shardMap.getShardForObject(object)
    task = createShardTask(shard, object, transactionRequest)
    parallelTasks.append(task)

  results = executeParallelTasks(parallelTasks) // Uses a thread pool or similar

  if (all tasks succeeded):
    commitTransaction(results)
  else:
    rollbackTransaction(results)
```

**Novelty:** This extends the object-centric approach by proactively sharding and replicating data *before* a transaction begins, based on predicted access patterns. This minimizes latency, maximizes parallelism, and dramatically reduces recovery time. It moves beyond simply recovering from failures to preventing them through predictive optimization.
