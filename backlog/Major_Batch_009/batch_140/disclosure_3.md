## Dynamic Network Resilience Scoring & Proactive Re-Routing

**Concept:** Extend the predictive failure analysis to create a real-time “Resilience Score” for each route, factoring in not just predicted load under failure, but also *speed of recovery* given available alternate paths. This score then drives proactive, dynamic re-routing *before* failures occur, optimizing for resilience *and* latency/cost.

**Specs:**

*   **Resilience Score Calculation:**
    *   Base: Predicted failure-case traffic load (as per the existing patent).
    *   Recovery Time Estimate: Calculate estimated time to reroute traffic around a failure using available paths, considering path bandwidth, latency, and current load.  Employ a shortest-path-first (SPF) or similar algorithm, weighted by latency *and* bandwidth utilization.
    *   Redundancy Factor:  Number of viable alternate paths.  Higher number = higher redundancy.
    *   Resilience Score = (Failure Load * (1/Redundancy Factor)) / Recovery Time.  Lower score is better (more resilient).
*   **Proactive Re-Routing Engine:**
    *   Thresholds: Define Resilience Score thresholds (e.g., Critical, Warning, Optimal).
    *   Dynamic Path Selection:  Continuously monitor Resilience Scores for all routes. When a route’s score falls below a threshold, proactively shift a percentage of traffic to alternate paths *before* a failure occurs.  This percentage is adjustable based on the severity of the score degradation.
    *   Cost/Latency Balancing:  Allow for configuration of weighting factors between cost (e.g., bandwidth costs) and latency when selecting alternate paths.  A user could prioritize minimizing cost or prioritizing minimizing latency.
    *   Traffic Shaping: Implement traffic shaping on proactively rerouted traffic to avoid congestion on the alternate paths.
*   **Real-time Topology Adaptation:**
    *   Integrate with network management systems to receive real-time updates on network topology changes (e.g., link additions, removals, bandwidth changes).
    *   Automatically recalculate Resilience Scores and adjust routing policies based on topology changes.
*   **AI-Powered Prediction Refinement:**
    *   Implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent that learns to predict future network failures based on historical data and real-time network telemetry.
    *   The RL agent can refine the failure prediction models used in the Resilience Score calculation, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of the proactive re-routing engine.

**Pseudocode (Proactive Re-Routing Engine):**

```
function ProactiveRerouting(Route, CurrentTrafficLoad, ResilienceScore) {

  if (ResilienceScore < WarningThreshold) {

    // Calculate percentage of traffic to reroute
    reroutePercentage = (WarningThreshold - ResilienceScore) / (WarningThreshold - CriticalThreshold) * MaxReroutePercentage

    // Identify alternate paths
    alternatePaths = FindAlternatePaths(Route)

    //Distribute traffic across alternate paths, considering bandwidth and latency
    for each path in alternatePaths {
      trafficToShift = Min(reroutePercentage * CurrentTrafficLoad, path.AvailableBandwidth)
      ShiftTraffic(CurrentTrafficLoad, trafficToShift, path)
      CurrentTrafficLoad -= trafficToShift
    }
  }
}

function FindAlternatePaths(Route) {
    //Use a shortest path algorithm like Dijkstra’s or Bellman-Ford, weighted by latency and bandwidth
    //Return a list of alternate paths sorted by a combined latency/bandwidth cost
}
```

**Novelty:**

This moves beyond *reacting* to failures to *anticipating* and *mitigating* them proactively, improving overall network resilience and reducing the impact of outages.  The combination of Resilience Scoring, AI-powered prediction refinement, and dynamic path selection provides a more intelligent and adaptive approach to network management.
