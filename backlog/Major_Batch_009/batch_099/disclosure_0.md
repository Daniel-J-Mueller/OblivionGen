## Dynamic Record Schemas & Predictive Attribute Generation

**Concept:** Extend the record embedding generation to *dynamically* adapt to evolving record schemas and proactively *predict* missing or future attributes. Instead of solely embedding existing structured data, the system learns the underlying relationships *between* attributes and can infer plausible new attributes or fill in gaps in incomplete records.

**Specs:**

*   **Schema Inference Module:** This module runs concurrently with the token embedding training. It analyzes the relationships between attributes across the dataset (co-occurrence, correlation, conditional probabilities). It generates a ‘schema graph’ representing these relationships. The graph isn’t static; it updates as new data is ingested.

*   **Attribute Prediction Engine:**  Given a record with missing attributes, this engine traverses the schema graph to identify potential attributes. It calculates a ‘plausibility score’ for each candidate attribute based on the relationships in the schema graph and the existing attributes of the record. 

*   **Synthetic Attribute Generation:** Once a set of plausible attributes is determined (based on a threshold for the plausibility score), the system *synthesizes* values for those attributes. This could involve:
    *   **Token Value Sampling:**  Sampling tokens from the token vocabulary, weighted by the probabilities learned during token embedding training.
    *   **Value Regression:**  Training a regression model to predict attribute values based on the existing attributes of the record and the schema graph.
    *   **Generative Modeling:** Employing a generative model (e.g., a variational autoencoder) trained on the dataset to generate realistic attribute values.

*   **Embedding Enhancement:**  The embeddings generated for the synthesized attributes are integrated into the record embedding. A weighting mechanism adjusts the contribution of synthesized attributes based on their plausibility score.

**Pseudocode (Attribute Prediction & Embedding Enhancement):**

```
FUNCTION predict_and_enhance_record(record, schema_graph, token_embeddings, plausibility_threshold):

  candidate_attributes = find_candidate_attributes(record, schema_graph)

  predicted_attributes = {}
  FOR attribute IN candidate_attributes:
    IF calculate_plausibility(record, attribute, schema_graph) > plausibility_threshold:
      predicted_value = generate_attribute_value(attribute, token_embeddings)
      predicted_attributes[attribute] = predicted_value

  # Create augmented record with predicted attributes
  augmented_record = record + predicted_attributes

  # Calculate record embedding with augmented record
  record_embedding = calculate_record_embedding(augmented_record, token_embeddings)

  RETURN record_embedding
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Schema Graph:**  A directed graph where nodes represent attributes, and edges represent relationships (e.g., “attribute A implies attribute B”). Edge weights represent the strength of the relationship.
*   **Plausibility Score:** A numerical value representing the likelihood that a particular attribute is relevant to a given record.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Data Completion:** Filling in missing data in incomplete records.
*   **Proactive Data Enrichment:**  Adding potentially relevant attributes to records before they are needed.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying records with unusual combinations of attributes.
*   **Personalized Recommendations:**  Predicting user preferences based on their attribute profiles.
