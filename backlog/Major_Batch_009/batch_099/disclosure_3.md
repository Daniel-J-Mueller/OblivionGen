## Dynamic Authentication Orchestration via Biometric Drift Analysis

**Concept:** Expand the authentication method beyond simple call/SMS confirmation by incorporating real-time biometric drift analysis of the user’s mobile device usage *during* the authentication process. This introduces a passive, continuous authentication layer, making it significantly harder to spoof.

**Specification:**

**I. Hardware Components:**

*   **Mobile Device SDK:**  A lightweight SDK integrated into native mobile applications (iOS/Android) or browser extensions.
*   **Authentication Server:**  A scalable server infrastructure capable of receiving and processing biometric data streams.
*   **Biometric Data Acquisition Module:**  Within the SDK, responsible for collecting authorized biometric data. This includes:
    *   **Keystroke Dynamics:** Capture timing, pressure, and patterns of keystrokes within the authentication application or web interface.
    *   **Touch/Swipe Dynamics:** Capture pressure, speed, and patterns of touch/swipe gestures on the device screen.
    *   **Device Motion Sensors:** Utilize accelerometer and gyroscope data to analyze device handling patterns (e.g., how the device is held during interaction).
    *   **Network Latency Profiling:** Monitor the typical network latency between the device and the authentication server. (Baseline is established during initial enrollment).
*   **Secure Enclave Integration:** Utilize the device’s secure enclave (if available) for storing sensitive biometric enrollment data and performing initial feature extraction.

**II. Software Components & Pseudocode:**

**A. Enrollment Phase:**

```pseudocode
function enrollUser(userID, biometricData):
  // 1. Collect biometric data over a defined period (e.g., 30 seconds)
  rawBiometricData = collectBiometricData(userID)

  // 2. Extract key features from raw data (keystroke timings, touch pressure variance, device motion patterns, baseline latency)
  featureVector = extractFeatures(rawBiometricData)

  // 3. Securely store the feature vector (encrypted) in the Authentication Server.
  secureStore(userID, featureVector)
```

**B. Authentication Flow:**

```pseudocode
function authenticateUser(userID, confirmationNumber):

  // 1. Initiate confirmation process (SMS/Call – as in the original patent)
  sendConfirmation(userID, confirmationNumber)

  // 2. Simultaneously, begin capturing real-time biometric data during the confirmation process.
  realtimeBiometricData = captureBiometricData(userID)

  // 3. Extract features from real-time data.
  realtimeFeatureVector = extractFeatures(realtimeBiometricData)

  // 4. Calculate a "drift score" by comparing the real-time feature vector to the enrolled feature vector. (Utilize a distance metric like Euclidean distance, Mahalanobis distance, or Dynamic Time Warping.)
  driftScore = calculateDriftScore(enrolledFeatureVector, realtimeFeatureVector)

  // 5. Combine drift score with success of confirmation code verification.
  combinedScore = calculateCombinedScore(driftScore, confirmationSuccess)

  // 6. If combinedScore exceeds a predefined threshold, authenticate the user.
  if (combinedScore > threshold):
    return AUTHENTICATED
  else:
    return FAILED
```

**C. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**

*   Implement an algorithm that dynamically adjusts the authentication threshold based on user behavior and risk profile.
*   Factors considered:  Time of day, location, device type, frequency of authentication requests, detected anomalies (e.g., unusual network latency spikes).

**III. Network Considerations:**

*   Biometric data transmission must be encrypted (TLS/SSL) to protect user privacy.
*   The system should be designed to handle intermittent network connectivity gracefully. (Store biometric data locally and transmit when connectivity is restored.)

**IV.  Security Enhancements:**

*   **Data Obfuscation:** Obfuscate raw biometric data before transmission to prevent replay attacks.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement machine learning models to detect anomalous biometric patterns that may indicate fraudulent activity.
*   **Device Binding:** Bind the authentication process to the specific device being used. (Utilize device identifiers and hardware attestation.)
*   **Behavioral Biometrics Fusion**: Combine keystroke dynamics, touch dynamics and device motion to create a multifaceted authentication profile.



This system aims to provide a more robust and user-friendly authentication experience by leveraging passive biometric data and dynamic risk assessment.  The inclusion of behavioral biometrics makes spoofing far more difficult and reduces reliance on easily compromised verification codes.
