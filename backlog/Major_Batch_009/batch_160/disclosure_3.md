## Dynamic Resource Allocation Based on Job ‘Shape’ & Predicted Interdependence

**Concept:** Instead of solely focusing on job *difficulty* or queue *size*, this system analyzes the inherent ‘shape’ of transcoding jobs (resolution changes, codec conversions, filter application sequences) and *predicts interdependencies* between jobs to proactively allocate resources. This allows for a more granular and efficient use of resources than simply scaling up/down based on volume or complexity.

**Specifications:**

**1. Job Shape Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Raw transcoding job request.
*   **Process:** Deconstructs the transcoding request into a series of operations (e.g., "Scale to 720p," "Convert to H.264," "Apply Gaussian Blur").  Assigns a 'cost' to each operation based on CPU/GPU usage, memory footprint, and estimated completion time.  Creates a ‘shape vector’ representing the sequence and cost of operations.
*   **Output:** Shape Vector.

**2. Interdependence Prediction Engine:**

*   **Input:** Shape Vectors of jobs in the work queue.
*   **Process:**  Uses a machine learning model (trained on historical transcoding data) to identify jobs that can benefit from shared resources or parallel processing.  Looks for patterns where a common operation is required for multiple jobs (e.g., multiple jobs requiring scaling to the same resolution).  Calculates a ‘dependency score’ indicating the potential for resource sharing.
*   **Output:** Dependency Matrix (showing pairwise dependency scores between jobs).

**3. Resource Allocation Optimizer:**

*   **Input:** Dependency Matrix, Shape Vectors, available resources, target completion time.
*   **Process:**  Employs a constraint satisfaction algorithm (e.g., Integer Programming) to optimize resource allocation.  Prioritizes jobs with high dependency scores for co-location on the same processing units.  Groups jobs based on resource requirements and shared operations.  Determines the optimal number of processing units needed to meet the target completion time.
*   **Output:** Resource Allocation Plan (specifying which jobs are assigned to which processing units).

**4. Dynamic Resource Provisioning:**

*   **Input:** Resource Allocation Plan, currently provisioned resources.
*   **Process:**  Provisions or de-provisions resources (CPU, GPU, memory) based on the Resource Allocation Plan. Uses a cloud orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes) to automatically scale resources up or down.
*   **Output:** Active Resource Configuration.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Optimizer):**

```
function optimizeResourceAllocation(dependencyMatrix, shapeVectors, availableResources, targetTime):
  numJobs = length(shapeVectors)
  jobAssignments = array of size numJobs (initially empty)

  // Iterate through jobs and assign to best available resource
  for i = 0 to numJobs - 1:
    bestResource = null
    bestScore = -1

    for j = 0 to availableResources.length - 1:
      // Calculate a 'fit score' based on resource capacity, job requirements, and dependency scores
      fitScore = calculateFitScore(availableResources[j], shapeVectors[i], dependencyMatrix[i])

      if fitScore > bestScore:
        bestScore = fitScore
        bestResource = availableResources[j]

    // Assign job to best resource
    jobAssignments[i] = bestResource

    // Update resource capacity
    updateResourceCapacity(bestResource, shapeVectors[i])

  return jobAssignments
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-performance compute cluster with scalable CPU and GPU resources.
*   Cloud orchestration platform (Kubernetes, AWS ECS).
*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Message queue (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for inter-component communication.
*   Data storage for historical transcoding data and ML model training.
