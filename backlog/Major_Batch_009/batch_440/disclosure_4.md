**Adaptive Metric Weighting via Reinforcement Learning**

**Specification:**

1.  **Core Concept:** Implement a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to dynamically adjust the weights assigned to individual metrics used in anomaly detection. The system, as described in the patent, currently *selects* metrics. This goes further by modulating the *influence* of existing metrics, allowing for nuanced anomaly scoring.

2.  **Components:**
    *   **RL Agent:** A Q-learning or Policy Gradient-based agent. State space represents the current metric weights and recent anomaly scores. Action space involves adjusting the weight of each metric (increase, decrease, hold).
    *   **Reward Function:** Defined based on the accuracy of anomaly detection. Positive reward for correctly identifying anomalies (confirmed by human operators or other ground truth). Negative reward for false positives/negatives. A secondary reward component could incentivize exploration of different weight combinations.
    *   **Metric Weight Storage:**  A database or key-value store to persist learned metric weights for each application or service.

3.  **Workflow:**
    1.  Initialization: Start with uniform weights for all selected metrics.
    2.  Data Collection: Gather time-series data for selected metrics.
    3.  Anomaly Scoring: Calculate an anomaly score based on weighted metric values (e.g., weighted sum of z-scores).
    4.  Feedback Loop:
        *   Present detected anomalies to human operators for confirmation/correction.
        *   Use operator feedback to update the reward function.
        *   The RL agent observes the current state (metric weights, anomaly scores) and takes an action (adjust metric weights).
        *   The agent receives a reward based on the accuracy of the anomaly detection.
        *   The agent updates its Q-table or policy network to improve future actions.
    5.  Continuous Adaptation:  The RL agent continuously learns and adapts metric weights over time, improving the accuracy of anomaly detection.

4.  **Pseudocode:**

```
# Initialization
metric_weights = {metric: 1.0 for metric in selected_metrics}
rl_agent = RL_Agent(state_space, action_space)

# Main Loop
while True:
    # 1. Collect Metric Data
    metric_data = collect_metric_data(selected_metrics)

    # 2. Calculate Anomaly Score
    anomaly_score = calculate_anomaly_score(metric_data, metric_weights)

    # 3. Detect Anomaly
    is_anomaly = detect_anomaly(anomaly_score, threshold)

    # 4. Get Feedback (Human or Automated)
    feedback = get_feedback(is_anomaly, actual_event)

    # 5. Calculate Reward
    reward = calculate_reward(feedback)

    # 6. RL Agent Action
    next_weights = rl_agent.choose_action(metric_weights, reward)

    # 7. Update Metric Weights
    metric_weights = next_weights
```

5.  **Hardware/Software Requirements:**
    *   Sufficient compute resources for RL training (GPU recommended).
    *   Scalable data storage for metric time-series data.
    *   RL framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, Stable Baselines3).
    *   APIs for integrating with existing monitoring and alerting systems.

6.  **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Multi-Agent RL:  Employ multiple RL agents, each responsible for a subset of metrics.
    *   Transfer Learning:  Pre-train the RL agent on a large dataset of metric data from other applications.
    *   Explainable AI:  Provide insights into why the RL agent adjusted specific metric weights.
