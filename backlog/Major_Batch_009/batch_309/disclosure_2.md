## Automated Tray Sorting & Re-Orientation System

**Concept:** Expand on the automated tray handling with a system that not only dispenses, but *sorts* trays based on content, and re-orients them for automated repacking or return to inventory. This moves beyond simple dispensing to a complete automated fulfillment loop.

**System Specifications:**

*   **Base Unit:** Modular conveyor system with integrated tray detection sensors (weight, optical scan for labels/barcodes, potentially RFID).
*   **Tray Interface:** Compatible with existing tray dimensions specified in the provided patent. Magnetic or pneumatic grippers for secure tray handling.
*   **Sorting Mechanism:** Series of high-speed diverting arms (rotary or linear actuators) positioned above the conveyor. Diverting arms will push/pull trays onto designated output lanes based on sensor data.
*   **Re-Orientation Module:**  A rotating carousel or indexing platform. This platform accepts trays from the sorting lanes. 
    *   **Rotation Control:** Precise stepper motors control the carouselâ€™s rotation.
    *   **Tray Lock:** Pneumatic or magnetic locking mechanism to secure trays on the carousel.
    *   **Repacking/Return Path:** Carousel indexes to either a repacking station (for damaged goods/returns processing) or a return conveyor for inventory restocking.
*   **Repacking Station (Optional):**
    *   Robotic arm equipped with a vacuum gripper for handling individual items.
    *   New tray presentation system to receive repacked items.
    *   Automated labeling and sealing system.
*   **Control System:**  PLC-based control system with a HMI for operator interface and monitoring.  Integrated with warehouse management system (WMS) for real-time inventory tracking.

**Pseudocode (Sorting Logic):**

```
FUNCTION SortTray(trayData, tray)

    IF trayData.weight > threshold_heavy THEN
        routeTray(tray, lane_heavy)
    ELSE IF trayData.barcode == "fragile" THEN
        routeTray(tray, lane_fragile)
    ELSE IF trayData.barcode == "return" THEN
        routeTray(tray, lane_return)
    ELSE
        routeTray(tray, lane_standard)
    END IF

END FUNCTION

FUNCTION routeTray(tray, lane)
    //Activate diverting arm corresponding to the specified lane
    divertingArm[lane].activate()
    //Delay to allow tray to move onto lane
    wait(1 second)
    //Deactivate diverting arm
    divertingArm[lane].deactivate()
END FUNCTION
```
