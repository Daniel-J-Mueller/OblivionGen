## Dynamic Foveated Rendering with Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Extend head/gaze tracking to incorporate real-time biometric data (heart rate variability, electrodermal activity) to dynamically adjust rendering resolution and detail *beyond* foveated rendering based on cognitive load and emotional state.

**Specs:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Existing:** Head tracking system (as per patent), high-resolution display, rendering component.
*   **New:** Bio-sensor array integrated into the head-mounted display or worn as a separate peripheral.  Sensors include:
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) for heart rate variability (HRV) measurement.
    *   Electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor for measuring skin conductance (emotional arousal).
    *   Optional: EEG sensors for rudimentary cognitive state detection.
*   Dedicated processing unit (integrated or external) for real-time bio-signal processing.

**2. Software Components:**

*   **Bio-Signal Processing Module:**
    *   Filters and cleans raw bio-signal data.
    *   Calculates HRV metrics (e.g., RMSSD, SDNN).
    *   Calculates EDA metrics (e.g., peak amplitude, frequency).
    *   Applies machine learning algorithms (trained on user-specific data) to infer cognitive load and emotional state (e.g., focused, stressed, bored).
*   **Dynamic Rendering Manager:**
    *   Receives gaze direction and cognitive/emotional state from the Bio-Signal Processing Module.
    *   Calculates a ‘Rendering Priority Score’ based on:
        *   Gaze direction (foveated rendering – highest priority at center of gaze).
        *   Cognitive load (higher load = prioritize critical details, reduce peripheral clutter).
        *   Emotional state (e.g., high stress = reduce visual complexity, increase calming elements; focused = increase detail in area of interest).
    *   Dynamically adjusts rendering parameters:
        *   Resolution (level of detail).
        *   Texture quality.
        *   Shader complexity.
        *   Ambient occlusion/lighting effects.
        *   Motion blur/depth of field.
*   **User Calibration Module:**
    *   Collects baseline bio-signal data in various states (resting, focused, stressed, bored).
    *   Allows users to customize the response of rendering parameters to bio-signal changes.
    *   Machine learning component to personalize rendering adjustments over time.

**3. Pseudocode (Dynamic Rendering Manager):**

```
function UpdateRenderingParameters(gazeDirection, cognitiveLoad, emotionalState) {

    RenderingPriorityScore = CalculatePriorityScore(gazeDirection, cognitiveLoad, emotionalState);

    if (RenderingPriorityScore > HighThreshold) {
        RenderingLevel = HighDetail;
    } else if (RenderingPriorityScore > MediumThreshold) {
        RenderingLevel = MediumDetail;
    } else {
        RenderingLevel = LowDetail;
    }

    // Apply rendering adjustments based on RenderingLevel
    SetResolution(RenderingLevel);
    SetTextureQuality(RenderingLevel);
    SetShaderComplexity(RenderingLevel);
    SetAmbientOcclusion(RenderingLevel);

}

function CalculatePriorityScore(gazeDirection, cognitiveLoad, emotionalState) {

    GazePriority = CalculateGazePriority(gazeDirection);
    CognitivePriority = Normalize(cognitiveLoad);
    EmotionalPriority = Normalize(emotionalState);

    PriorityScore = (GazePriority * 0.6) + (CognitivePriority * 0.2) + (EmotionalPriority * 0.2);

    return PriorityScore;
}

function CalculateGazePriority(gazeDirection) {
    // Calculate a priority score based on the distance from the center of gaze
    // Higher score for areas closer to the center of gaze
    return 1.0 - Distance(gazeDirection, CenterOfScreen);
}
```

**4. Integration with Existing System:**

The Bio-Signal Processing Module and Dynamic Rendering Manager integrate into the existing computing device, utilizing the existing head tracking data and rendering component. The system communicates between the bio-sensors and the rendering component, enabling real-time adjustments to rendering parameters based on user physiological state.
