## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** This system leverages multi-microphone arrays and advanced signal processing to *reconstruct* the acoustic scene surrounding the user, creating a spatial audio ‘bubble’ independent of the device's physical location or orientation. Instead of simply dereverberating and reducing noise, it aims to *model* the environment, allowing for dynamic spatial audio rendering.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum 8-microphone circular array (diameter > 15cm). Higher density arrays preferred.
    *   High-fidelity ADC (minimum 24-bit, 96kHz sampling rate).
    *   Dedicated DSP/FPGA for real-time processing.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) - 6DoF minimum (accelerometer, gyroscope).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Beamforming & Source Localization:** Adaptive beamforming algorithms (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, MVDR, MUSIC) combined with time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and frequency-domain source localization techniques. The IMU data is fused with the acoustic data to refine localization accuracy, especially for moving sources.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Mapping:** The system builds a probabilistic acoustic map of the environment. This map represents the location and characteristics of sound sources (speech, music, environmental sounds) and the reflective surfaces contributing to reverberation.  Map resolution dynamically adjusts based on acoustic activity.
    *   **Spatial Audio Rendering:** A spatial audio rendering engine creates a 3D soundscape based on the acoustic map. This includes HRTF (Head-Related Transfer Function) filtering for realistic spatialization, and ambisonic encoding for accurate sound field reproduction.
    *   **Dynamic Reverberation Synthesis:** Instead of merely *removing* reverberation, the system *synthesizes* realistic reverberation based on the acoustic map. This allows it to create a 'virtual acoustic space' around the user, independent of the actual environment.
    *    **Adaptive Noise Cancellation:** Noise cancellation is performed *after* acoustic scene reconstruction and spatial rendering. This allows the system to preserve the spatial characteristics of desired sounds while suppressing unwanted noise.

**Pseudocode (Scene Reconstruction Loop):**

```
// Initialize Acoustic Map
map = initialize_acoustic_map()

loop:
    // Capture Microphone Data
    mic_data = capture_microphone_data()

    // IMU Data Acquisition
    imu_data = acquire_imu_data()

    // Beamforming & Source Localization
    sources = localize_sound_sources(mic_data, imu_data)

    // Update Acoustic Map
    map = update_acoustic_map(map, sources)

    // Spatial Audio Rendering
    rendered_audio = render_spatial_audio(map)

    // Adaptive Noise Cancellation
    output_audio = apply_noise_cancellation(rendered_audio)

    // Output Audio
    output(output_audio)
```

**Novel Aspects:**

*   **From Dereverberation to Reconstruction:** The system shifts the focus from suppressing artifacts (reverberation, noise) to actively modeling and recreating the acoustic environment.
*   **Dynamic Virtual Acoustic Space:**  The ability to synthesize reverberation based on the acoustic map allows for the creation of a personalized acoustic bubble, independent of the real-world environment.
*   **IMU Fusion for Enhanced Accuracy:** Integration of IMU data significantly improves source localization and tracking, particularly for mobile users.
*   **Application Potential:** This technology could revolutionize conferencing, gaming, virtual/augmented reality, and accessibility for hearing-impaired individuals.
