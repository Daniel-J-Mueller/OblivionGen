## Adaptive Packet Prioritization via Predictive Congestion Modeling

**System Overview:**

This system introduces dynamic packet prioritization based on predicted network congestion *before* packets are transmitted, enhancing reliability and potentially throughput beyond simple sequence-number acknowledgment. It builds upon the foundation of connectionless communication detailed in the provided patent, but shifts from reactive acknowledgment to proactive congestion avoidance.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Congestion Prediction Module (CPM):**  This module resides on the sending device. It maintains a historical model of network latency and packet loss rates for each destination (or destination *group*). This model isn't just an average; it's a time-series prediction.  The CPM leverages machine learning – specifically, a recurrent neural network (RNN) – trained on network performance data. Input features include:
    *   Historical latency to the destination.
    *   Historical packet loss rates.
    *   Current network load (estimated – see section 3).
    *   Time of day/week (to capture recurring congestion patterns).
    *   Packet size.

2.  **Packet Prioritization Engine (PPE):** Based on the CPM’s output (a congestion score for the *next* transmission window), the PPE assigns a priority level to each packet.  Priorities are not absolute; they are relative within a defined range (e.g., 0-3).  Higher priority packets are preferentially buffered and transmitted when network resources are constrained.

3.  **Network Load Estimation (NLE):** To enhance the CPM, the NLE component estimates current network load *without* relying on direct acknowledgment. This is achieved through a distributed "probe" system. The sending device periodically sends small, low-priority probe packets to the destination. The round-trip time (RTT) of these probes is used as a proxy for network load. A sudden increase in RTT signals increased congestion. This data is aggregated across multiple sending devices to create a broader view of network conditions.

4.  **Adaptive Buffering/Scheduling:** The sending device’s network stack incorporates adaptive buffering and scheduling logic. Higher-priority packets are placed in a dedicated buffer with preferential access to the network interface.  A scheduling algorithm dynamically adjusts transmission rates based on congestion predictions and buffer occupancy.  

**Pseudocode (Simplified PPE):**

```
function prioritizePacket(packet, destination):
  congestionScore = CPM.predictCongestion(destination)
  
  if congestionScore > thresholdHigh:
    priority = 3  // Highest priority
  else if congestionScore > thresholdMedium:
    priority = 2
  else if congestionScore > thresholdLow:
    priority = 1
  else:
    priority = 0  // Lowest priority
  
  packet.priority = priority
  return packet
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **DestinationProfile:** Contains historical network data (latency, loss rates), RNN model parameters, and congestion prediction history for a specific destination.
*   **PriorityQueue:** A data structure used for buffering packets based on their assigned priority.

**Implementation Notes:**

*   The RNN model in the CPM requires training on representative network data to achieve accurate congestion predictions.
*   The priority levels and threshold values need to be tuned based on network characteristics and application requirements.
*   The system should be designed to handle situations where congestion predictions are inaccurate or unavailable.
*   Consider using a decentralized approach to NLE to reduce reliance on a single point of failure.
*   Potential extension: incorporate Quality of Service (QoS) markings into packets to signal priority to network devices.
