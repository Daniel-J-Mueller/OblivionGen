## Dynamic Permission Inheritance via Graph Database

**Concept:** Extend the permissioning system beyond static user groups and roles by leveraging a graph database to model relationships between users, resources, and permissions. This allows for dynamic, context-aware permission inheritance and fine-grained access control.

**Specifications:**

**1. Graph Database Schema:**

*   **Nodes:**
    *   `User`: Represents a user account. Properties: `user_id`, `name`, `department`.
    *   `Resource`: Represents a managed resource (server, database, application). Properties: `resource_id`, `resource_type`, `location`.
    *   `Permission`: Represents a specific action allowed on a resource (read, write, execute, delete). Properties: `permission_id`, `permission_name`, `description`.
    *   `Group`: Represents a user group (similar to existing OS groups). Properties: `group_id`, `group_name`.
    *   `Relationship`: Represents relationships between these entities. Types: `BELONGS_TO` (User-Group), `HAS_PERMISSION` (Group-Permission), `ACCESSES` (User-Resource), `OWNS` (Group-Resource), `INHERITS` (Permission-Permission).

*   **Relationships:** Directed edges connecting the nodes, defining the relationships between them.

**2. Permission Inheritance Engine:**

*   **Traversal Algorithm:**  A graph traversal algorithm (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search) used to determine effective permissions for a user on a resource.
*   **Inheritance Rules:**
    *   A user's effective permissions are the combination of permissions directly assigned to the user, permissions inherited through group membership, and permissions inherited through relationships between permissions themselves (e.g., a "data_analyst" permission automatically grants "read" permission).
    *   Conflict resolution: Define rules for handling conflicting permissions (e.g., deny overrides allow, most specific permission wins).
*   **Dynamic Updates:** The graph database is updated in real-time to reflect changes in user roles, resource ownership, and permission assignments.
*   **Caching:** Implement a caching layer to improve performance and reduce the load on the graph database.

**3. Integration with Existing System:**

*   **Agent Modification:** Modify the existing systems-manager agent to query the graph database for effective permissions instead of relying solely on OS user groups.
*   **API:** Expose an API for managing the graph database (adding/removing users, resources, permissions, and relationships).
*   **Authentication:** Integrate with the existing IAM component to authenticate users and retrieve their user ID.

**4. Pseudocode (Permission Check):**

```
function checkPermission(userId, resourceId, operation) {
  // 1. Retrieve user's direct permissions, permissions inherited through groups.
  directPermissions = queryGraphDB(userId, resourceId, operation, "DIRECT")
  groupPermissions = queryGraphDB(userId, resourceId, operation, "GROUP")
  inheritedPermissions = queryGraphDB(userId, resourceId, operation, "INHERITED")
  
  // 2. Combine permissions, resolving conflicts according to defined rules.
  effectivePermissions = combinePermissions(directPermissions, groupPermissions, inheritedPermissions)

  // 3. Return true if the requested operation is allowed, false otherwise.
  if (effectivePermissions.includes(operation)) {
    return true
  } else {
    return false
  }
}
```

**5. Scalability and Resilience:**

*   **Distributed Graph Database:** Utilize a distributed graph database (e.g., Neo4j AuraDB, Amazon Neptune) to handle large-scale deployments.
*   **Replication and Sharding:** Implement replication and sharding to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor the performance of the graph database and alert administrators to any issues.
