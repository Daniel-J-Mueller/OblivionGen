## Dynamic File Preview & Collaborative Annotation Overlay

**Core Concept:** Extend the sharing link functionality to include a real-time, collaborative annotation overlay directly within the message interface *before* the recipient even clicks the link. This moves beyond simple link-based access and facilitates immediate, contextual feedback.

**Specs:**

*   **Component 1:  Real-Time Preview Engine.**  The messaging client (or a dedicated plugin) must incorporate a miniature rendering engine capable of displaying previews of supported file types (images, PDFs, certain video formats, text documents) *within* the message composition window. This preview isn't a full-screen experience; it’s embedded alongside the message text field.
*   **Component 2: Annotation Layer.**  On top of the preview, an annotation layer allows users to add:
    *   Freehand drawings/highlights
    *   Text comments/notes pinned to specific areas of the preview
    *   Pre-defined stamp/emoji reactions (e.g., "Approved," "Needs Revision")
*   **Component 3: Synchronization Protocol.**  A WebSocket-based communication protocol ensures real-time synchronization of annotations between the sender and recipient (or multiple collaborators).  Each annotation has a unique ID and timestamp.
*   **Component 4:  Permission Control.**  Fine-grained permission controls allow the sender to define annotation access:
    *   **View Only:** Recipient can see annotations but not add/edit them.
    *   **Collaborative:**  Multiple users can co-create annotations.
    *   **Sender Control:** Only the sender can create/edit annotations.
*   **Component 5: Link Generation & Embedding.** The sharing service generates a special link that, when clicked, opens the file *with* the embedded annotation layer visible. It’s not just a file download; it's an interactive experience.  The link should also contain a session ID for maintaining real-time synchronization.
*   **Component 6: Version Control & History.**  The annotation layer stores a complete history of all changes made, allowing users to revert to previous versions.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Sending):**

```
function shareFileWithAnnotations(file, recipients) {
  // 1. Display file preview in message composer
  displayFilePreview(file);

  // 2. Enable annotation layer
  enableAnnotationLayer();

  // 3. Capture all annotations made by the user
  annotations = captureAnnotations();

  // 4. Send file and annotations to sharing service
  sharingService.uploadFile(file, annotations);

  // 5. Sharing service generates special link with session ID
  link = sharingService.generateAnnotatedLink(fileId, sessionId);

  // 6. Insert link into message and send
  insertLinkIntoMessage(link);
  sendMessage(message);
}
```

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Receiving):**

```
function openAnnotatedFile(link) {
  // 1. Extract file ID and session ID from link
  fileId = extractFileId(link);
  sessionId = extractSessionId(link);

  // 2. Request file from sharing service
  sharingService.downloadFile(fileId);

  // 3. Establish WebSocket connection with sharing service using sessionId
  websocket = establishWebSocketConnection(sessionId);

  // 4. Render file with annotation layer
  renderFileWithAnnotationLayer(file, websocket);

  // 5. Display file with annotations
  displayFileWithAnnotations(file);
}
```

**Expansion Possibilities:**

*   Integration with other productivity tools (e.g., task management, project planning).
*   Support for voice annotations and video comments.
*   AI-powered annotation suggestions (e.g., automatic tagging of key areas).
*   Support for 3D model annotation.
