## Adaptive Pedal Texture - Dynamic Friction Control

**Concept:** A vehicle pedal surface incorporating micro-actuated texture variation to dynamically adjust friction based on driver input and environmental conditions.

**Specs:**

*   **Pedal Surface Material:** Durable, high-coefficient-of-friction polymer composite with embedded micro-actuators. Base material should be resistant to wear from shoe contact and temperature fluctuations.
*   **Micro-Actuator Array:** A dense grid of individually controllable micro-actuators (piezoelectric, shape memory alloy, or micro-electromechanical systems - MEMS based) embedded within the pedal surface. Actuators must have a minimal footprint to avoid compromising pedal feel. Resolution: minimum 100 actuators per square centimeter.
*   **Actuation Range:** Each actuator capable of altering the height of a small "bump" or "ridge" on the pedal surface by 0.1 - 1.0 mm. This change in height modifies the contact area and thus the friction coefficient.
*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   **Pedal Force Sensor:** Measures the force applied by the driver’s foot. Range: 0-200N, resolution 1N.
    *   **Foot Moisture Sensor:** Capacitive sensor integrated into the pedal surface to detect moisture levels.
    *   **Vehicle Speed Sensor:** Input from vehicle’s CAN bus.
    *   **Environmental Sensor:** Detects outside temperature and precipitation levels.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller with real-time processing capabilities.
    *   Algorithm to map sensor data to actuator control signals.
    *   User-adjustable sensitivity settings.
*   **Power Supply:** Integrated power supply connected to vehicle’s 12V system.

**Algorithm Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
set base_friction_level = 50%  // Default friction level
set sensitivity = 75%       // User-defined sensitivity

// Main Loop
while (vehicle is running) {
    read pedal_force from pedal force sensor
    read foot_moisture from foot moisture sensor
    read vehicle_speed from vehicle CAN bus
    read environmental_data (temp, precipitation)

    // Adjust friction based on conditions
    if (pedal_force > threshold_heavy_pressure) {
        friction_level = 100% // Max friction for hard braking/acceleration
    } else if (foot_moisture > threshold_wet_foot) {
        friction_level = 75% // Increased friction for wet feet
    } else if (vehicle_speed > threshold_high_speed) {
        friction_level = 85% // Increased friction for high-speed conditions
    } else if (environmental_data.precipitation == "raining") {
        friction_level = 90% // increased friction in wet weather
    } else {
        friction_level = base_friction_level
    }

    // Apply Sensitivity
    final_friction_level = friction_level + (sensitivity * (friction_level - base_friction_level))

    // Map friction level to actuator control signals
    for each actuator in actuator_array {
        actuator_height = map(final_friction_level, 0, 100, 0, 1.0) // Actuator height in mm
        set actuator.height = actuator_height
    }
}
```

**Innovation Rationale:** This system allows for dynamic adjustment of pedal friction, enhancing driver control in various conditions. It can compensate for wet shoes, improve responsiveness during performance driving, and provide a more confident feel in adverse weather. The micro-actuators allow for subtle and precise control of the pedal surface, creating a highly customizable and adaptable driving experience.
