## Dynamic Content Layering via Multi-Modal Sensory Input

**Concept:** Extend the system to dynamically layer content based not just on spoken requests, but also on *environmental* sensory input from the electronic device – ambient light, detected motion, proximity to other devices, even detected emotional tone from microphone analysis. This creates a "smart ambient content feed" reacting to the user *and* their surroundings.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensory Input Module:**
    *   Integrate with device sensors: microphone, accelerometer, light sensor, proximity sensor, camera (optional, privacy-controlled).
    *   Data normalization and filtering: convert raw sensor data into standardized values for analysis.
    *   Real-time data stream: continuous monitoring of environmental conditions.
*   **Contextual Analysis Engine:**
    *   Multi-modal fusion: combine speech recognition data with sensor data.
    *   Rule-based system: define rules that map sensor data to content categories. (e.g., Low light + topic "relaxation" -> ambient soundscape of rain)
    *   Machine learning model: train a model to predict optimal content based on combined input. (Consider reinforcement learning - reward content selection that maintains user engagement, defined by continued interaction.)
    *   Intent disambiguation: Use sensory data to resolve ambiguous speech commands (e.g. “play something” in a dark room might prioritize ambient music, versus an upbeat playlist in bright daylight.)
*   **Content Prioritization and Layering:**
    *   Dynamic content queue: manage a prioritized list of content items.
    *   Layered output: enable blending or switching between content layers (e.g., background ambient sound, overlaid with a short informational snippet, prompted by a user question.)
    *   Adaptive volume/brightness: Adjust output parameters based on environmental conditions.
*   **User Profile Integration:**
    *   Sensory preferences: Allow users to customize their responses to environmental input. (e.g. "I prefer nature sounds in low light.")
    *   Learning from user behavior: track user interactions and refine sensory preferences automatically.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Analysis Engine):**

```
FUNCTION analyze_context (speech_data, sensor_data, user_profile)
  sensor_context = process_sensor_data(sensor_data)
  speech_intent = extract_intent(speech_data)

  IF speech_intent is ambiguous
    contextual_hint = get_contextual_hint(sensor_context, user_profile)
    speech_intent = refine_intent(speech_intent, contextual_hint)

  content_category = map_intent_to_category(speech_intent, user_profile)
  content_priority = calculate_priority(content_category, sensor_context, user_profile)

  RETURN content_category, content_priority
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION process_sensor_data(sensor_data)
  light_level = sensor_data.light_sensor
  motion_detected = sensor_data.accelerometer
  proximity = sensor_data.proximity_sensor

  IF light_level < threshold_low AND motion_detected == false
    sensor_context = "low_light_still"
  ELSE IF proximity > threshold_close
    sensor_context = "nearby_device"
  ELSE
    sensor_context = "general_environment"

  RETURN sensor_context
END FUNCTION
```

**Use Case:** User is cooking in a dimly lit kitchen. They say "Play something." The system, detecting low light and stillness, prioritizes a relaxing instrumental playlist over an upbeat pop song. As they begin to move around, the system subtly increases the tempo.
