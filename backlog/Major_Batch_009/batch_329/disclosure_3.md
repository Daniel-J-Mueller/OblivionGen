## Substrate-Integrated RF Lens Array for Enhanced Signal Focusing

**Concept:** Integrate a miniature RF lens array directly onto the substrate alongside the data signal interconnects. This allows for focused RF signal transmission/reception, potentially improving signal integrity and reducing interference, especially in high-density arrays.

**Specs:**

*   **Substrate Material:** High-frequency, low-loss dielectric material (e.g., Rogers 4350B).  Material thickness: 0.15mm - 0.3mm.
*   **Lens Material:**  Electrically conductive polymer or deposited metallic nanostructures (e.g., silver nanowires embedded in polymer).  Permittivity adjustable via post-deposition treatment.
*   **Lens Array Configuration:**  Phased array of micro-lenses, each focusing RF signals onto a corresponding data signal interconnect.  Lens diameter: 50-200µm.  Lens pitch: 100-400µm (adjustable based on array density).
*   **Lens Profile:** Gradient refractive index (GRIN) lenses, fabricated via focused ion beam milling or nano-imprint lithography.  Alternative:  Arrays of metallic resonators designed to act as focusing elements.
*   **Interconnect Integration:**  Data signal interconnects positioned at the focal points of the RF lenses.  Precise alignment (±5µm) critical during fabrication.
*   **Control System:** Microcontroller-based system for dynamically adjusting the phase and amplitude of RF signals emitted by each lens element.  Allows for beam steering and shaping.
*   **Frequency Range:** 2.4 GHz – 5 GHz (adjustable based on application).
*   **Power Consumption:** < 10mW per lens element.

**Implementation:**

1.  **Substrate Preparation:** Fabricate a substrate with embedded data signal interconnects.
2.  **Lens Fabrication:**  Using nano-imprint lithography or focused ion beam milling, create a layer of GRIN lenses on the substrate surface, aligning them with the data signal interconnects.  Metallic resonator arrays could be deposited through sputtering and etching.
3.  **Control Circuit Integration:** Integrate a micro-controller based control circuit to manage RF signal phase and amplitude for each lens.
4.  **Testing & Calibration:**  Employ a near-field scanning probe microscope to measure the RF field distribution and calibrate the lens array for optimal focusing.

**Pseudocode for Control System:**

```
// Define lens array dimensions
arrayWidth = 10;
arrayHeight = 10;

// Define signal parameters
frequency = 2.4e9;
amplitude = 1.0;

// Function to calculate phase shift for beam steering
function calculatePhaseShift(x, y, angle) {
  // Calculate phase shift based on lens position (x, y) and steering angle
  phaseShift = 2 * PI * (x * cos(angle) + y * sin(angle)) / wavelength;
  return phaseShift;
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Get desired steering angle from user/application
  steeringAngle = getSteeringAngle();

  // Loop through each lens element
  for (i = 0; i < arrayWidth; i++) {
    for (j = 0; j < arrayHeight; j++) {
      // Calculate phase shift for current lens element
      phaseShift = calculatePhaseShift(i, j, steeringAngle);

      // Generate RF signal with calculated phase shift
      signal = generateRFSignal(frequency, amplitude, phaseShift);

      // Transmit signal to lens element
      transmitSignal(signal, i, j);
    }
  }

  // Delay for next iteration
  delay(1ms);
}
```

**Potential Applications:** Wireless charging, high-speed data communication, improved touch sensitivity, and localized RF energy delivery.
