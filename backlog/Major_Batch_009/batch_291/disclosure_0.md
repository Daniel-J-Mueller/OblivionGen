## Adaptive Echo Cancellation with Bioacoustic Feature Integration

**Concept:** Augment traditional acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) with real-time analysis of bioacoustic features extracted from the near-end signal (microphone input). The goal is to improve AEC performance in noisy environments or scenarios where traditional AEC struggles (e.g., highly reverberant spaces, non-stationary noise). The system dynamically adjusts AEC parameters based on identified biological vocal tract characteristics to improve separation between desired speech and echo.

**System Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   High-fidelity microphone array (minimum 4 elements) for capturing near-end audio.
    *   Dedicated DSP/FPGA for real-time bioacoustic feature extraction and AEC processing.
    *   Standard audio interface for speaker output (far-end signal).
*   **Software:**
    *   **Bioacoustic Feature Extraction Module:**
        *   Input: Near-end audio signal.
        *   Processing:
            *   Preprocessing: Noise reduction, bandpass filtering (focus on speech frequencies).
            *   Feature Extraction:
                *   Formant Analysis: Real-time tracking of formant frequencies (F1, F2, F3, etc.).
                *   Pitch Detection: Estimation of fundamental frequency (F0).
                *   Vocal Tract Length (VTL) Estimation: Estimate based on formant spacing.
                *   Glottal Source Characteristics: Assessment of glottal pulse shape (e.g., shimmer, jitter).
        *   Output: Vector of bioacoustic features.
    *   **AEC Parameter Adaptation Module:**
        *   Input: Bioacoustic feature vector, estimated delay from existing AEC methods (e.g., PHAT GCC, as in the provided patent), far-end signal, near-end signal.
        *   Processing:
            *   Bioacoustic Feature Mapping: Utilize a trained machine learning model (e.g., neural network, random forest) to map bioacoustic features to optimal AEC parameters. Parameters to adjust include:
                *   Filter Length: Adjust the length of the adaptive filter in the AEC algorithm.
                *   Step Size: Control the convergence speed of the adaptive filter.
                *   Regularization: Add regularization to prevent filter divergence.
                *   Noise Gate Threshold: Adjust the noise gate to minimize residual echo.
            *   Dynamic Parameter Adjustment: Continuously update AEC parameters based on real-time bioacoustic analysis.
            *   Fallback Mechanism: If bioacoustic analysis is unreliable (e.g., signal is too noisy, not speech), revert to default AEC parameters or previously estimated values.
    *   **AEC Core:** Utilize an existing AEC algorithm (e.g., Wiener filter, adaptive filter) with parameters dynamically adjusted by the Adaptation Module.

**Pseudocode - Adaptation Module:**

```
function AdaptAECParameters(bioacousticFeatures, estimatedDelay, farEndSignal, nearEndSignal):
  // 1. Predict optimal AEC parameters using trained model
  predictedParameters = Model.Predict(bioacousticFeatures)

  // 2. Apply parameter constraints (to prevent instability)
  filteredStepSize = constrain(predictedParameters.stepSize, minStepSize, maxStepSize)
  filteredFilterLength = constrain(predictedParameters.filterLength, minFilterLength, maxFilterLength)

  // 3. Update AEC core parameters
  AEC_Core.SetStepSize(filteredStepSize)
  AEC_Core.SetFilterLength(filteredFilterLength)

  // 4. Monitor AEC performance (e.g., residual echo level)
  residualEcho = AEC_Core.CalculateResidualEcho()

  // 5. Adaptive Learning (optional): Fine-tune the prediction model based on the observed performance
  if (residualEcho > threshold):
    // Adjust the model weights based on the error
    Model.Train(bioacousticFeatures, desiredParameters)

  return residualEcho
```

**Novelty:**

This approach goes beyond traditional AEC by incorporating biologically-inspired features to dynamically adapt the AEC process. It moves beyond simply estimating *delay* to understanding the *characteristics* of the speaker and using that information to improve separation. This could lead to significantly improved performance in challenging acoustic environments and a more natural-sounding audio experience. The machine learning component enables personalization and optimization of AEC performance for individual speakers.
