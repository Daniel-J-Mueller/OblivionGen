## Dynamic Recipe Composition via User Feedback Loops

**Specification:** A system enabling real-time adaptation of ‘recipes’ (sequences of service calls) based on implicit and explicit user feedback, moving beyond static recipe definitions.

**Core Concept:**  Recipes are not fixed. They are ‘seeded’ with a base structure, but can dynamically expand, contract, or modify their operation sequences *during* execution, guided by a feedback loop analyzing user interaction.

**Components:**

1.  **Recipe Seed:**  The initial recipe definition, similar to the patent’s concept, outlining a core set of operations and service calls.
2.  **Feedback Analyzer:** Monitors user interactions with the results of each operation within the recipe. This includes:
    *   **Implicit Feedback:** Dwell time on specific results, scroll depth, click-through rates, and session duration.
    *   **Explicit Feedback:** Thumbs up/down ratings, direct text input (“This result wasn't helpful”), or selectable tags.
3.  **Dynamic Recipe Modeler (DRM):** A machine learning model trained to predict optimal recipe modifications based on feedback data.  This model outputs a set of ‘mutation’ instructions.
4.  **Mutation Engine:** Applies the mutation instructions to the current recipe.  Mutations can include:
    *   **Operation Reordering:**  Changing the sequence of operations.
    *   **Operation Insertion:** Adding new operations to the recipe.
    *   **Operation Deletion:** Removing unnecessary operations.
    *   **Parameter Adjustment:** Modifying the inputs to existing operations.
    *   **Service Substitution:** Replacing one service with another (assuming compatible APIs).
5.  **Safety Governor:** Limits the scope of mutations to prevent runaway complexity or unintended consequences. Includes a rollback mechanism to revert to a stable recipe state.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initial Setup
Recipe currentRecipe = loadRecipe(recipeID)
FeedbackData feedbackData = initializeFeedbackData()

// Main Loop
while (requestNotComplete()) {
  Operation nextOperation = currentRecipe.getNextOperation()
  ServiceResult result = executeOperation(nextOperation)

  // Collect User Feedback
  feedbackData.update(result, getUserInteraction())

  // Analyze Feedback & Generate Mutations
  MutationSet mutations = DRM.predict(feedbackData)

  // Apply Mutations (governed by Safety Governor)
  if (SafetyGovernor.isValid(mutations)) {
    currentRecipe.applyMutations(mutations)
  }

  // Return Result to User
  transmitResult(result)
}

// Cleanup
saveRecipe(currentRecipe) // Persist learned improvements
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `Recipe`:  A list of `Operation` objects, each referencing a `Service` and input parameters.  Includes metadata for versioning and tracking modifications.
*   `Operation`: Contains the `Service` identifier, input parameters, and a pointer to the next operation.
*   `Service`: Defines the API endpoint, input/output schemas, and error handling logic.
*   `FeedbackData`: Stores aggregated user interaction data (dwell time, clicks, ratings, etc.) associated with each `Operation` and `Service`.
*    `MutationSet`:  A list of instructions for modifying the `Recipe` (e.g., "insert Operation X after Operation Y," "remove Operation Z," "adjust parameter A").

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond static recipes to create adaptive, self-improving service coordination workflows. The feedback loop and dynamic modeling allow recipes to tailor themselves to individual user needs and optimize performance over time.  The safety governor mitigates risks associated with uncontrolled modification. This is a shift from pre-defined logic to emergent behavior.
