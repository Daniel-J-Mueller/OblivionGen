## Dynamic Feature Sculpting with Haptic Feedback

**Concept:** Extend the visualization region refinement system by integrating haptic feedback and allowing users to *sculpt* feature representations directly. Instead of simply selecting items, users physically manipulate representations within the visualization region, influencing search refinement in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Haptic display capable of rendering varying degrees of resistance and texture. This could be a force-feedback touchscreen or a more advanced volumetric display.
*   **Visualization Region:** Initial visualization region generated as per the existing patent. Representational items are assigned a 'material property' – a baseline haptic profile.
*   **User Interaction:**
    *   **Proximity Detection:** As the user’s hand/stylus approaches an item, the haptic display activates.
    *   **Sculpting Modes:** Three primary sculpting modes:
        *   **Emphasis:**  ‘Pushing’ into an item increases its weight in the search algorithm.  Haptic feedback reflects increasing resistance.
        *   **Suppression:** ‘Pulling’ away from an item decreases its weight.  Feedback simulates a ‘release’ or decreasing resistance.
        *   **Merging:**  ‘Dragging’ one item onto another merges their associated features, creating a new, combined feature representation in the visualization region. Feedback is a ‘sticking’ or blending sensation.
    *   **Material Properties:**  Each feature can have material properties assigned - 'soft', 'rigid', 'grainy', 'smooth', which impact haptic feedback during sculpting.
*   **Algorithm Integration:**
    *   **Force Mapping:**  Force applied by the user is mapped to a weighting factor for the associated feature.  Higher force = greater weight.
    *   **Dynamic Adjustment:** As the user sculpts, the search algorithm dynamically adjusts the search results in real-time.
    *   **Haptic-Driven Exploration:** Algorithm also suggests ‘sculpting’ actions, for example, pulsing an item to encourage exploration of related features.
*   **User Interface Data:** Generate UI data that displays the visualization region with associated haptic profiles for each item.
*   **Pseudocode:**

```
// User Interaction Loop
while (true) {
    detectUserInteraction();
    if (interactionType == "touch") {
        item = getItemAtPosition(touchPosition);
        if (item != null) {
            if (gesture == "push") {
                increaseFeatureWeight(item.feature, force * sensitivity);
            } else if (gesture == "pull") {
                decreaseFeatureWeight(item.feature, force * sensitivity);
            } else if (gesture == "drag") {
                targetItem = getItemAtDragTarget();
                if (targetItem != null) {
                    mergeFeatures(item.feature, targetItem.feature);
                    updateVisualizationRegion();
                }
            }
        }
    }
    updateSearchQuery();
    renderVisualizationRegion();
}
```

*   **Potential Extensions:**  Integration with voice control (e.g., “Soften the red items”),  AI-driven haptic feedback to guide user exploration.  Different haptic ‘palettes’ for different product categories.
