## Dynamic Query Graph Optimization & Materialized View Synthesis

**Concept:** Extend the query routing/rewriting concept to build a dynamic query graph, allowing for *synthesis* of materialized views on-the-fly, leveraging diverse data sources beyond pre-defined databases. This isn't just about routing *to* a different database, but *combining* data from multiple sources dynamically, creating temporary, optimized views tailored to the specific query.

**Specs:**

**1. Query Graph Builder Module:**

*   **Input:** Original client query (SQL, etc.).
*   **Process:**
    *   Parse the query into an abstract syntax tree (AST).
    *   Identify data requirements (tables, columns, predicates).
    *   Construct a dependency graph representing data access patterns. Nodes are data entities (tables, columns, data streams), edges represent dependencies.
    *   This graph will be a dynamic representation of the query’s data needs, not a static pre-defined plan.

**2. Data Source Discovery & Profiling:**

*   **Data Source Registry:** A continuously updated catalog of available data sources. This includes traditional databases, data lakes, APIs, real-time data streams (Kafka, etc.), and even potentially external cloud services.
*   **Profiling Engine:** Continuously profile each data source based on:
    *   Schema information.
    *   Data statistics (cardinality, distribution).
    *   Query performance characteristics (estimated cost).
    *   Data freshness/latency.
*   The Profiling Engine leverages machine learning to predict data source performance for various query patterns.

**3. Materialized View Synthesis Engine:**

*   **Input:** Query Graph, Data Source Profiles.
*   **Process:**
    *   Identify potential materialized views that can satisfy parts of the query graph.  These views don’t need to pre-exist.
    *   The engine *synthesizes* these views on-the-fly using a cost-based optimizer. It determines the optimal combination of data sources and transformations to create a temporary, optimized view.
    *   Transformations include filtering, aggregation, joins, and data type conversions.
    *   Views are materialized in a temporary storage layer (e.g., in-memory cache, distributed object store).
    *   Parallelize the view synthesis process to minimize latency.

**4. Query Execution Engine:**

*   **Input:** Original Query, Synthesized Views.
*   **Process:**
    *   Rewrite the original query to leverage the synthesized views.  This may involve breaking the query into sub-queries that can be executed against the views.
    *   Execute the rewritten query against the views and the remaining data sources.
    *   Combine the results and return them to the client.

**Pseudocode (View Synthesis):**

```
function synthesize_views(query_graph, data_source_profiles):
  views = []
  for node in query_graph:
    best_data_source = find_best_data_source(node, data_source_profiles)
    if best_data_source:
      view_definition = generate_view_definition(node, best_data_source)
      materialize_view(view_definition)
      views.append(view_definition)
  return views

function find_best_data_source(node, data_source_profiles):
  // Use machine learning model to predict performance
  // based on node characteristics and data source profiles
  return best_data_source

function generate_view_definition(node, data_source):
  // Create SQL or other query language definition
  // for the view
  return view_definition
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Dynamic View Creation:**  The system doesn't rely on pre-defined materialized views. It creates them on-the-fly, adapting to the specific query.
*   **Cross-Source Optimization:** The optimizer considers data sources beyond traditional databases, including real-time streams and external APIs.
*   **ML-Driven Performance Prediction:**  Machine learning is used to predict data source performance, enabling the optimizer to make more informed decisions.
*   **Query Decomposition:**  The system decomposes complex queries into smaller sub-queries that can be executed against the synthesized views.
