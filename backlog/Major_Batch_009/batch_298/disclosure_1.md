## Dynamic Inventory ‘Shadowing’ & Predictive Replenishment

**Concept:** Extend the inventory analysis beyond simple purchase/decline decisions to create a ‘shadow’ inventory forecast based on simulated purchase scenarios and real-time demand fluctuations. This moves beyond reactive analysis to proactive replenishment planning.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Inputs:**

*   Real-time inventory levels (current stock).
*   Historical sales data (at least 2 years).
*   Current offer data (price, quantity).
*   Sales channel data (pricing, promotion schedules).
*   External factors:
    *   Seasonality data (holidays, weather patterns).
    *   Economic indicators (consumer confidence, disposable income).
    *   Social media trends (sentiment analysis related to the product).
    *   Competitor pricing and stock levels (web scraping).

**2. ‘Shadow Inventory’ Simulation:**

*   **Scenario Generation:**  Create multiple 'shadow' inventory simulations. Each simulation assumes a different purchase quantity – ranging from zero to a maximum feasible order quantity.
*   **Demand Modeling:** Employ a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM) trained on historical sales data, adjusted for seasonality, economic indicators, and social media sentiment. This model predicts demand for each time step within a defined forecasting horizon (e.g., 90 days).
*   **Holding Cost Calculation:**  Determine holding costs per unit, including storage, insurance, obsolescence, and capital costs.
*   **Scenario Evaluation:** For each simulation:
    *   Calculate projected inventory levels over the forecasting horizon.
    *   Calculate total holding costs.
    *   Calculate projected lost sales due to stockouts.
    *   Calculate projected profit margin.
    *   Determine a 'risk score' based on the probability of stockouts and the potential for lost profit.

**3. Dynamic Replenishment Trigger:**

*   **Risk Threshold:** Define a configurable risk threshold.
*   **Replenishment Recommendation:** If the risk score for *any* simulation falls below the threshold, trigger a replenishment recommendation. The recommendation specifies the purchase quantity from the simulation with the *lowest* risk score.
*   **Automated Order Placement:** Optionally, integrate with a procurement system to automatically place an order based on the replenishment recommendation.

**4. AI-Powered Refinement:**

*   **Reinforcement Learning:**  Employ a reinforcement learning agent to optimize the replenishment strategy over time. The agent learns from past performance (e.g., stockout rates, profit margins) and adjusts the risk threshold and replenishment parameters to maximize profitability.
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Use anomaly detection algorithms to identify unexpected demand spikes or supply chain disruptions. Trigger alerts and adjust replenishment plans accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Replenishment Recommendation Engine):**

```
FUNCTION get_replenishment_recommendation(offer_data, inventory_data, external_data):

  simulations = []
  FOR quantity IN range(0, max_order_quantity):
    simulation = run_inventory_simulation(quantity, inventory_data, external_data)
    simulations.append(simulation)

  valid_simulations = []
  FOR simulation IN simulations:
    IF simulation.stockout_probability < stockout_threshold AND simulation.profit_margin > minimum_acceptable_profit:
      valid_simulations.append(simulation)

  IF valid_simulations is empty:
    RETURN "No replenishment recommended"

  best_simulation = min(valid_simulations, key=lambda x: x.risk_score)

  RETURN best_simulation.quantity
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Cloud-based computing infrastructure (AWS, Azure, GCP).
*   Database for storing historical data and simulation results.
*   Machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Data analytics tools (Pandas, NumPy).
*   API integration with procurement systems.
