## Adaptive Notification Ecosystem – Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Expand context-aware notifications by integrating real-time biofeedback data from wearable sensors to dynamically adjust notification delivery *beyond* proximity and ambient sound. The goal is to present information when the user is *most receptive*, optimizing information intake and minimizing disruption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Sensor Integration Module:**
   *   **Input:** Real-time data streams from wearable biofeedback sensors (e.g., heart rate variability (HRV), electrodermal activity (EDA), brainwave activity (EEG – utilizing readily available consumer EEG headsets)).  API compatibility with major wearable platforms (Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.).  Raw data transmission preferred; onboard preprocessing optional.
   *   **Processing:**  Data cleaning, filtering, and feature extraction. Calculation of 'cognitive load' and 'emotional state' metrics.  Algorithm: Weighted combination of HRV, EDA, and EEG features.  Adjustable weighting parameters for personalization.  Establish baseline metrics during periods of known low cognitive load (e.g., sleep, meditation).
   *   **Output:**  'Receptivity Score' (0-100). A normalized metric reflecting the user’s current ability to process information.

**2. Notification Prioritization & Modulation Engine:**
   *   **Input:** Incoming notifications (message type, sender, content keywords, urgency flags).  Receptivity Score (from Sensor Integration Module).
   *   **Prioritization Logic:**
        *   **Critical Alerts:** (e.g., emergency services, life-threatening medical conditions) – Bypass Receptivity Score, deliver immediately via all available channels (visual, aural, haptic).
        *   **High Priority:** (e.g., direct supervisor, immediate family) – Deliver if Receptivity Score > 70. Modulate delivery based on Receptivity Score (see Modulation Logic).
        *   **Medium Priority:** (e.g., work colleagues, social media) – Deliver if Receptivity Score > 50.  Significant modulation.
        *   **Low Priority:** (e.g., marketing, promotional content) – Deliver only if Receptivity Score > 80 *and* during predefined 'Acceptable Notification Windows' (user-configurable time slots).
   *   **Modulation Logic:** (Dynamic adjustment of notification characteristics)
        *   **Visual:** Brightness, color saturation, animation speed, screen real estate occupied. Lower Receptivity Score = More subtle visual cues.
        *   **Aural:** Volume, frequency, timbre, sound complexity.  Lower Receptivity Score =  Simpler tones, lower volume, use of ambient sound masking.
        *   **Haptic:** Intensity, pattern, location on body.  Lower Receptivity Score = Gentle vibrations, localized to non-distracting areas.
        *   **Content Summarization:**  Automatically condense lengthy notifications into concise summaries based on Receptivity Score.  Offer full content access on demand.

**3. Personalized Learning & Adaptation:**
   *   **User Feedback Mechanism:**  Allow users to rate notification relevance & intrusiveness *after* exposure.  Implement a simple 'helpful/distracting' rating system.
   *   **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilize a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to optimize notification delivery strategies based on user feedback and biofeedback data.
   *   **Profile Storage:**  Store personalized notification profiles in the cloud, accessible across multiple devices.

**Pseudocode (Notification Delivery Flow):**

```
function deliverNotification(notification):
  receptivityScore = getReceptivityScore()
  priority = getNotificationPriority(notification)

  if priority == "critical":
    deliverImmediately(notification)
  else if priority == "high":
    if receptivityScore > 70:
      modulateNotification(notification, receptivityScore)
      deliverNotification(notification)
  else if priority == "medium":
    if receptivityScore > 50:
      modulateNotification(notification, receptivityScore)
      deliverNotification(notification)
  else:
    if receptivityScore > 80 and isWithinAcceptableWindow():
      modulateNotification(notification, receptivityScore)
      deliverNotification(notification)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Compatible wearable biofeedback sensors.
*   Smartphone or other computing device with processing power for real-time data analysis.
*   Secure cloud storage for user profiles and machine learning models.

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Integration with environmental sensors (e.g., light level, noise level) to further refine context awareness.
*   Predictive modeling of user cognitive load based on calendar events and location data.
*   Proactive notification suppression during periods of high cognitive demand (e.g., driving, attending a meeting).
