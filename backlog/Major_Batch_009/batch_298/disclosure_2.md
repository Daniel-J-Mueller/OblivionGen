## Circuit Breaker Diagnostic & Predictive Maintenance System

**System Overview:** A distributed sensor network integrated with existing circuit breaker infrastructure to provide real-time diagnostics, predictive maintenance alerts, and automated fault isolation. This builds upon the physical lockout/cover concepts to *actively* monitor and respond to breaker health.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Breaker Interface Module (BIM):** Retrofittable module that attaches to existing circuit breakers.  Includes:
    *   Micro-vibration sensors (3-axis accelerometer) – Detects internal arcing, contact wear, or loose components.
    *   Temperature sensors (Thermocouple/RTD) – Monitors operating temperature, identifies overheating.
    *   Current sensors (Hall effect) – Precise current measurement for load analysis and anomaly detection.
    *   Magnetic Field Sensor – Detects anomalies in magnetic fields associated with internal components.
    *   Microcontroller (ARM Cortex-M series) – Processes sensor data, executes diagnostics, and communicates with the central system.
    *   Wireless Communication Module (Zigbee/Bluetooth Mesh) – Low-power, reliable communication to the gateway.
    *   Power Harvesting Module – Miniature thermoelectric generator (TEG) utilizes breaker heat to supplement/replace battery power.
*   **Gateway:** Central hub that collects data from all BIMs, performs advanced analytics, and provides a user interface.
    *   High-performance processor (Intel/AMD)
    *   Wireless communication (WiFi/Ethernet)
    *   Data storage (SSD/Cloud)
*   **Mobile App/Web Interface:** Provides real-time monitoring, historical data analysis, and alert notifications.

**Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Baseline Establishment:** During initial setup, the system learns the “normal” operating parameters for each breaker (vibration signature, temperature profile, current draw).
*   **Anomaly Detection:**  Utilizes machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection forests, autoencoders) to identify deviations from the baseline.
*   **Fault Classification:** Algorithms classify the type of fault (e.g., contact wear, overheating, internal arc).
*   **Predictive Maintenance:**  Based on historical data and fault trends, the system predicts remaining useful life (RUL) and schedules maintenance proactively.
*   **Automated Fault Isolation:** Integrates with building management systems (BMS) to automatically isolate faulty circuits.
*   **Secure Over-the-Air (OTA) Updates:**  Enables remote software updates and security patches.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Installation:** BIMs are installed on existing circuit breakers.
2.  **Baseline Learning:** System gathers data to establish baseline parameters.
3.  **Real-time Monitoring:** Sensors continuously monitor breaker health.
4.  **Anomaly Detection:** Algorithms identify deviations from the baseline.
5.  **Alerting & Reporting:** Notifications are sent to maintenance personnel via the mobile app/web interface.
6.  **Predictive Maintenance:** System schedules maintenance based on RUL predictions.
7.  **Automated Isolation:** Faulty circuits are automatically isolated (optional).

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
// Define baseline parameters (mean, standard deviation) for each sensor
sensor_data[sensor_name].mean
sensor_data[sensor_name].std_dev

// Function to detect anomalies
function detect_anomaly(sensor_name, current_reading) {
  z_score = (current_reading - sensor_data[sensor_name].mean) / sensor_data[sensor_name].std_dev
  if (abs(z_score) > threshold) { // Threshold is a configurable parameter
    return true // Anomaly detected
  } else {
    return false // No anomaly
  }
}

// Main loop
while (true) {
  // Read sensor data
  vibration = read_vibration_sensor()
  temperature = read_temperature_sensor()
  current = read_current_sensor()

  // Detect anomalies
  vibration_anomaly = detect_anomaly("vibration", vibration)
  temperature_anomaly = detect_anomaly("temperature", temperature)
  current_anomaly = detect_anomaly("current", current)

  // If any anomaly is detected, trigger alert
  if (vibration_anomaly || temperature_anomaly || current_anomaly) {
    trigger_alert("Anomaly detected in circuit breaker")
  }
}
```

**Novelty:**  This system moves beyond physical lockout and adds *active* monitoring and predictive capabilities. It anticipates failures *before* they occur, reducing downtime and improving safety. The combination of distributed sensors, machine learning, and automated fault isolation creates a significantly more robust and intelligent circuit breaker system.
