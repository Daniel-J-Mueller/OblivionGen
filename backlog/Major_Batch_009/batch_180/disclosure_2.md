## Adaptive Feature Weighting via Reinforcement Learning

**System Specifications:**

**Core Concept:** Dynamically adjust the weights assigned to different feature types (Hamming distance, association strength, skip bigram determination, etc.) *during* entity resolution, using a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent. This moves beyond static feature selection/weighting based solely on context data *before* scoring.

**Components:**

*   **Entity Resolution Pipeline:** The existing system for candidate entity selection and initial scoring (as detailed in the provided patent). This forms the environment for the RL agent.
*   **RL Agent:** A Q-learning or Policy Gradient agent.
    *   **State:** Represents the current context of entity resolution. This includes:
        *   The input text segment.
        *   The top N candidate entities.
        *   The currently selected feature type weights.
        *   Potentially, confidence scores from prior resolution attempts (if applicable).
    *   **Action:** Adjust the weight of a specific feature type.  Actions could be discrete (increase weight, decrease weight, no change) or continuous (adjust weight by a specific amount).
    *   **Reward:** Based on the accuracy of the entity resolution.  A positive reward is given if the correct entity is selected; a negative reward (or zero) if the wrong entity is selected. The magnitude of the reward could be scaled by the confidence score of the selection.
*   **Feature Weight Storage:** A table or data structure to store the learned feature weights for different states.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:** Initialize the RL agent and feature weights (potentially with default values derived from training data).
2.  **Candidate Selection & Initial Scoring:** The system identifies potential candidate entities and calculates initial relevance scores using a baseline feature weighting scheme.
3.  **State Observation:** The RL agent observes the current state of the entity resolution process.
4.  **Action Selection:** The RL agent selects an action (adjusting the weight of a specific feature type) based on its current policy.
5.  **Weight Adjustment:** The system adjusts the weight of the selected feature type.
6.  **Re-scoring:** The system re-calculates the relevance scores for the candidate entities using the updated feature weights.
7.  **Entity Selection:** The system selects the entity with the highest relevance score.
8.  **Reward Calculation:** The system calculates a reward based on the accuracy of the entity selection.
9.  **Policy Update:** The RL agent updates its policy based on the received reward.
10. **Iteration:** Steps 3-9 are repeated for each entity resolution request, allowing the RL agent to learn and improve its policy over time.

**Pseudocode (simplified Policy Update):**

```
// Q-Learning Update
Q(state, action) = Q(state, action) + learning_rate * (reward + discount_factor * max_a Q(next_state, a) - Q(state, action))
```

**Data Requirements:**

*   Labeled dataset of text segments and corresponding correct entities (for initial training and evaluation).
*   A mechanism for collecting data on the accuracy of entity resolution in a production environment (for online learning).

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   Hierarchical RL: Use a hierarchical RL approach where higher-level agents select feature groups and lower-level agents fine-tune the weights within those groups.
*   Multi-Agent RL:  Train multiple RL agents, each specializing in a different domain or entity type.
*   Exploration/Exploitation Strategies: Implement advanced exploration/exploitation strategies (e.g., epsilon-greedy, Boltzmann exploration) to encourage the RL agent to discover new and potentially better feature weightings.
