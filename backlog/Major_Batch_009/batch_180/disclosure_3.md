## Haptic Stylus Feedback System - “FeelTech”

**Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback directly into the stylus tip, modulated by surface properties detected by the capacitive sensor. This moves beyond simple pressure sensitivity to provide textural feedback, simulating the ‘feel’ of different surfaces on a touchscreen.

**Specifications:**

*   **Stylus Tip Material:** Multi-layered construction. Inner core of shape-memory alloy (SMA), surrounded by a piezoelectric polymer layer, encapsulated in a durable, low-friction polymer sheath.
*   **Capacitive Sensor Integration:** Existing receive electrode augmented with a micro-controller to analyze electric field fluctuations beyond simple signal detection. This secondary analysis will map surface characteristics (roughness, material type – glass, plastic, etc.).
*   **Haptic Actuation:** The micro-controller drives the SMA core based on surface characteristic data. SMA deformation changes the tip’s physical profile – creating subtle bumps, ridges, or softening the contact point. Piezoelectric layer will add higher frequency vibrations for textures like ‘grain’ or ‘stipple’.
*   **Feedback Modes:**
    *   *Texture Simulation:*  Mapping detected surface characteristics to pre-defined haptic profiles. (e.g., detecting glass = smooth feedback, detecting paper = slightly resistive, textured feedback).
    *   *UI Element Feedback:* Distinct haptic ‘clicks’ or vibrations when interacting with specific UI elements (buttons, sliders, etc.).
    *   *Dynamic Friction Control:* Modulating the SMA to simulate varying levels of friction, providing feedback during drawing or writing.
*   **Power Source:** Miniature solid-state battery integrated into the stylus body. Wireless charging capability.
*   **Communication Protocol:** Existing capacitive communication channel supplemented with a low-power Bluetooth link for firmware updates and custom haptic profile uploads.
*   **Software API:** SDK provided for developers to create custom haptic experiences and integrate with applications.
*   **Analog Front End Modification:**  Addition of a dedicated processing core to the analog front end capable of pre-processing capacitive data for texture analysis *before* sending the signal to the main processor.  This reduces the load on the main processor.
*   **Data Encoding:**  Capacitive signal includes an additional data packet encoded using Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) to transmit texture data to the stylus.

**Pseudocode (Texture Mapping):**

```
//On Computing Device:
function analyzeSurface(capacitiveReading) {
  //Apply Machine Learning Algorithm (trained on various surface types)
  surfaceType = ML_Predict(capacitiveReading)

  //Lookup corresponding haptic profile
  hapticProfile = HapticProfileDatabase[surfaceType]

  //Format haptic profile as FSK data packet
  dataPacket = FSK_Encode(hapticProfile)

  //Transmit dataPacket via capacitive link
}

//On Stylus:
function receiveHapticData(dataPacket) {
  hapticProfile = FSK_Decode(dataPacket)

  activateHapticProfile(hapticProfile)
}

function activateHapticProfile(profile) {
  //Adjust SMA deformation
  SMA_SetPosition(profile.SMA_Position)

  //Set Piezoelectric vibration frequency & amplitude
  Piezo_SetFrequency(profile.Piezo_Frequency)
  Piezo_SetAmplitude(profile.Piezo_Amplitude)
}
