## Contextual Audio Tagging & Predictive Environment Control

**System Overview:** A distributed sensor network leveraging localized audio analysis to dynamically adjust environmental parameters (lighting, temperature, scent) based on inferred user activity and emotional state. This goes beyond simple keyword detection; it focuses on *contextual* understanding of audio events and *predictive* environmental responses.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Distributed Audio Nodes (DANs):** Small, low-power devices equipped with microphones and localized processing capabilities. These nodes are strategically placed throughout a defined area (home, office, vehicle).

2.  **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** A more powerful device (server, dedicated hub) responsible for aggregating data from DANs, running advanced analytics, and controlling environmental actuators.

3.  **Environmental Actuators:** Devices capable of adjusting environmental parameters (smart lights, thermostats, scent diffusers, etc.).

**Functional Specifications:**

*   **Audio Capture & Pre-processing:** Each DAN continuously captures audio. Raw audio is pre-processed locally: noise reduction, signal amplification, and feature extraction (MFCCs, spectral centroid, chroma features).
*   **Event Classification (DAN-local):**  DANs employ a lightweight machine learning model (e.g., TinyML-compatible CNN) to classify broad audio events: speech, music, silence, sound effects (e.g., footsteps, door slams).
*   **Keyword/Phrase Spotting (CPU):** The CPU receives event classifications and associated audio segments from DANs. Advanced speech recognition and Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used to identify keywords, phrases, and infer user intent.  A significant enhancement: analysis of *prosody* (tone, pitch, rhythm) to assess emotional state.
*   **Contextual Scene Building:** The system doesn't just react to individual keywords. It builds a *contextual scene* based on a history of detected events, emotional analysis, and *sensor fusion*.  For example: “User speaking with frustrated tone + sound of typing + late hour = potentially working on a difficult task.”
*   **Predictive Environmental Control:** Based on the contextual scene, the system *predicts* the user's needs and proactively adjusts environmental parameters.
    *   **Example 1:** Frustrated user working late: dim lights, reduce temperature, introduce calming scent (lavender), play ambient focus music.
    *   **Example 2:** Energetic music detected + sound of footsteps + bright light: increase temperature, introduce energizing scent (citrus), increase volume of music.
    *   **Example 3:** Calming music + soft speech + low light: further dim lights, maintain comfortable temperature, introduce relaxing scent.
*   **User Profile & Personalization:**  Each user has a profile storing preferences for scents, lighting, temperature, and music. The system adapts to individual user tastes.
*   **Privacy Considerations:**
    *   Audio data is processed locally on DANs whenever possible.
    *   Only aggregated and anonymized data is sent to the CPU.
    *   Users have full control over data collection and can opt-out at any time.

**Pseudocode (Contextual Scene Building):**

```
// Event data received from DANs
event_data = {
    timestamp: 1678886400,
    source_dan: "LivingRoom_1",
    event_type: "speech",
    audio_segment: <audio_data>,
    keywords: ["deadline", "stress"],
    emotion: "frustrated",
    confidence: 0.85
}

// Contextual scene data structure
contextual_scene = {
    timestamp: current_time(),
    location: event_data.source_dan,
    events: [],
    user_state: {},
}

// Add event to scene
contextual_scene.events.append(event_data)

// Update user state
contextual_scene.user_state["current_activity"] = "working"
contextual_scene.user_state["emotional_state"] = "stressed"

// Prioritize emotional state for environment control
priority_factor = contextual_scene.user_state["emotional_state"]

// Determine environment adjustments based on priority factor
if (priority_factor == "stressed"):
    adjust_lighting("dim")
    adjust_temperature("decrease")
    activate_scent("lavender")
    play_music("ambient focus")

// Update scene history
scene_history.append(contextual_scene)
```

**Further Development:** Integration with other smart home devices (e.g., smart blinds, smart fans) to create a fully responsive and personalized environment.  Machine learning models to predict user needs based on historical data.  Advanced sensor fusion with visual and motion sensors to improve context awareness.
