## Adaptive Dataflow Network with Dynamic Precision

**Concept:** Expand beyond static row input bus allocation. Implement a fully connected, dynamically reconfigurable dataflow network *within* each row of the processing element array. This allows for arbitrary data dependencies and precision scaling *at runtime*, maximizing throughput and energy efficiency.

**Specifications:**

*   **Dataflow Graph Representation:** Neural network layers (or sub-graphs) are compiled into dataflow graphs. Each node represents an operation (multiply, add, activation, etc.), and edges represent data dependencies.
*   **Row-Level Dataflow Engine:** Each row contains a local dataflow engine. This engine consists of:
    *   **Configurable Interconnect:** A programmable switch matrix allowing arbitrary connections between processing elements (PEs) within the row.  Utilize nanoscale crossbar switches for high density and low latency.
    *   **Precision Scaling Units (PSUs):** Each PSU is attached to a PE and can dynamically adjust the precision of data (e.g., 8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit floating-point). PSUs support mixed precision â€“ different PEs within the row can operate at different precisions based on data sensitivity.
    *   **Local Data Buffers:** Small, high-bandwidth SRAM buffers within each PE to store intermediate results and facilitate data reuse.
*   **Global Control Network:** A low-latency network connecting all row-level dataflow engines, enabling synchronization and control.
*   **Dynamic Scheduling:** A runtime scheduler analyzes the dataflow graph and dynamically allocates resources (PEs, interconnect paths, precision levels) to optimize performance and energy efficiency.
*   **Input/Output:** Input data (FMAPs, weights) is streamed into the array via the row input buses, but distribution *within* the row is handled by the dataflow engine. Output data is collected from the PEs and streamed out via column output buses.

**Pseudocode (Runtime Scheduling):**

```
function schedule_dataflow_graph(graph, array_config):
  // graph: Dataflow graph representing the layer
  // array_config: Configuration of the processing element array

  for each node in graph:
    // Determine required precision based on data sensitivity
    precision = determine_precision(node)

    // Find available PEs with the required precision
    available_pes = find_available_pes(precision)

    // Allocate PE to the node
    allocate_pe(node, available_pe)

    // Determine data dependencies
    dependencies = get_dependencies(node)

    // Route data from dependencies to the PE
    route_data(dependencies, available_pe, array_config)

  // Synchronize PEs and start execution
  synchronize_pes(array_config)
  start_execution(array_config)
```

**Novelty:** The prior art focuses on optimizing data movement *into* the array. This design optimizes data movement *within* each row, enabling more flexible and efficient computation. The dynamic precision scaling allows for significant energy savings without sacrificing accuracy.

**Potential Applications:** This architecture is particularly well-suited for complex neural networks with dynamic workloads, such as those used in autonomous driving and natural language processing.
