## Dynamic Data Lineage & Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the node hierarchy concept to incorporate *data lineage* tracking alongside query processing, and use this lineage data to *predictively* allocate resources for subsequent queries. This anticipates processing needs before they arise, improving overall system responsiveness and reducing latency.

**Specification:**

**1. Data Lineage Capture Module:**

*   **Function:**  Monitor data flow between nodes during query execution. Record which nodes processed which data segments, and the transformations applied.
*   **Implementation:**  Intercept data transfer operations (file transfers, network calls) between nodes. Log source node, destination node, data segment identifier, and transformation details (e.g., filter criteria, aggregation functions). Store lineage information in a graph database indexed by data segment ID.
*   **Data Structure:**  Graph Database.  Nodes: Data Segments, Processing Nodes. Edges: “Processed By” (direction: Data Segment -> Processing Node), “Transformed Into” (direction: Data Segment -> Data Segment). Edge properties: Transformation type, timestamp.

**2. Predictive Resource Allocation Engine:**

*   **Function:** Analyze data lineage graphs to predict resource requirements for future queries.  Identify frequently accessed data segments and the nodes responsible for their processing.
*   **Algorithm:**
    *   **Phase 1: Lineage Graph Analysis:**  Traverse the lineage graph to identify “hot” data segments (high degree of connectivity – many queries accessing them). Calculate a “processing load score” for each node based on the number and complexity of transformations it performed on hot data.
    *   **Phase 2:  Resource Prediction:**  When a new query arrives, parse its data access patterns.  Identify the data segments it requires.  Look up the corresponding processing nodes in the lineage graph.  Estimate resource requirements (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) based on the processing load score and historical performance data.
    *   **Phase 3:  Dynamic Allocation:**  Provision resources on the identified nodes *before* query execution.  This can involve scaling up virtual machines, increasing memory allocation, or pre-fetching data.

**3.  Integration with Existing System:**

*   The Data Lineage Capture Module integrates as a middleware component between nodes.
*   The Predictive Resource Allocation Engine interfaces with the job scheduler. It adds a new scheduling priority level (“Proactive”) which triggers resource allocation based on prediction.

**Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Engine):**

```
function predict_resources(query):
  data_segments = extract_data_segments(query)
  processing_nodes = []
  for segment in data_segments:
    node = get_processing_node(segment) # lookup in lineage graph
    processing_nodes.append(node)

  resource_estimates = {}
  for node in processing_nodes:
    load_score = get_load_score(node)
    resource_estimates[node] = calculate_resource_needs(load_score)

  return resource_estimates

function calculate_resource_needs(load_score):
  # Based on load score, estimate CPU, Memory, Network
  # Utilize historical data and scaling factors
  cpu = base_cpu + (load_score * cpu_scaling_factor)
  memory = base_memory + (load_score * memory_scaling_factor)
  network = base_network + (load_score * network_scaling_factor)

  return (cpu, memory, network)
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Graph database (Neo4j, JanusGraph)
*   Message queue (RabbitMQ, Kafka) for inter-node communication
*   Monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana) to track performance
*   API endpoints for resource provisioning (e.g., cloud provider APIs)
