## Dynamic Risk-Aware Document Bucketing & Predictive Threat Modeling

**Concept:** Extending the idea of document bucketing (Claim 17) beyond simple topic similarity to incorporate *predictive* risk assessment based on real-time external threat intelligence and contextual document features. Instead of static bucket risk scores, these scores become dynamic and predictive, allowing for proactive threat mitigation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Feature Engineering:**

*   **Document Source:** Standard crawl of electronic resources (as in existing patent).
*   **Internal Features:** Topic vectors (from topic model), identified entities within documents (names, locations, organizations), document metadata (author, creation date, access frequency), element-level risk scores (as per Claim 16).
*   **External Threat Intelligence:** Real-time feeds from various sources:
    *   Vulnerability databases (NVD, CVE)
    *   Threat actor profiles (MITRE ATT&CK)
    *   Dark web monitoring (indicators of compromise)
    *   Reputation services (IP address, domain name)
*   **Feature Combination:**  Combine internal & external features to create a comprehensive feature vector for each document.  Example features:
    *   "Number of CVEs associated with software mentioned in document"
    *   "Similarity to known phishing emails"
    *   "Threat actor interest in entities mentioned"

**2. Predictive Risk Model:**

*   **Model Type:** Gradient Boosting Machine (XGBoost, LightGBM) - chosen for its ability to handle complex feature interactions & provide feature importance scores.
*   **Training Data:** Historical document data labeled with security incidents (exploits, data breaches, phishing attacks).  Labeling can be automated via correlation with security logs.
*   **Output:**  Probability of a document being involved in a future security incident. This forms the "Predictive Risk Score".

**3. Dynamic Bucketing:**

*   **Bucket Creation:** Buckets are initially formed based on topic similarity (as in Claim 17).
*   **Dynamic Re-Scoring:**  Each bucket’s risk score is *dynamically* updated based on:
    *   Average Predictive Risk Score of documents within the bucket.
    *   Time decay factor - older documents contribute less to the score.
    *   External Threat Signals - if a topic is currently under active exploitation, bucket risk increases.
*   **Bucket Splitting/Merging:**  Buckets are automatically split or merged based on risk score divergence. High-risk buckets are isolated.

**4. Alerting & Response:**

*   **Risk Thresholds:**  Customizable risk thresholds for each bucket.
*   **Alert Generation:**  Alerts triggered when a bucket’s risk score exceeds a threshold.
*   **Automated Response:**
    *   Increased monitoring of documents in high-risk buckets.
    *   Automatic restriction of access to sensitive documents.
    *   User notification and training.

**Pseudocode (Bucket Re-scoring):**

```
function reScoreBucket(bucket, currentTime):
  bucketRisk = 0
  totalWeight = 0
  for document in bucket:
    timeSinceCreation = currentTime - document.creationTime
    weight = exp(-timeSinceCreation / decayFactor) //Exponential decay for older documents
    bucketRisk += document.predictiveRiskScore * weight
    totalWeight += weight

  bucketRisk = bucketRisk / totalWeight

  // Incorporate external threat signals
  if topicUnderActiveExploitation(bucket.topic):
    bucketRisk += externalThreatBoost

  return bucketRisk
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond reactive security posture to a *proactive* one by predicting potential threats *before* they materialize. The dynamic bucketing and automated response mechanisms allow for efficient resource allocation and mitigation of risk.
