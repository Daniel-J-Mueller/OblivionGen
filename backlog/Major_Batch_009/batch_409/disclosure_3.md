## Dynamic Embedding Space Partitioning with Adaptive Resolution

**Concept:** Expand upon the error correction code (ECC) clustering approach by introducing a dynamic, multi-resolution embedding space. Instead of a fixed d-dimensional space, the system will learn and adapt the dimensionality and partitioning of the embedding space based on data density and query patterns. This will allow for both broad, coarse-grained searches and fine-grained, precise nearest neighbor identification.

**Specifications:**

**1. Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction/Expansion Module:**

*   **Input:** Dataset entries, initial embedding space parameters (initial dimensionality, ECC parameters).
*   **Process:**
    *   Employ a dimensionality reduction technique (e.g., autoencoders, PCA) to initially map entries into a lower-dimensional space.
    *   Monitor data distribution within the embedding space. Calculate density metrics (e.g., k-nearest neighbor distances, kernel density estimation) at various points.
    *   Implement a feedback loop. If density is low in certain regions, *increase* dimensionality locally for those regions using additional embedding layers. If density is high, *decrease* dimensionality.  This creates a non-uniform, adaptive embedding space.
    *   The system tracks 'resolution maps' which indicate the current dimensionality of each region of the embedding space.
*   **Output:**  Adapted embeddings, resolution maps.

**2. Hierarchical ECC Partitioning:**

*   **Input:** Adapted embeddings, resolution maps.
*   **Process:**
    *   Apply ECC partitioning *within* each resolution region. The ECC parameters (code length, rate) can be adjusted based on the local dimensionality and density.
    *   Create a hierarchical tree structure.  Each node in the tree represents a cluster/region.  Leaf nodes represent individual data points or small clusters.  Parent nodes represent coarser-grained clusters formed by combining child clusters.
    *   Maintain index structures at each level of the hierarchy.
*   **Output:** Hierarchical cluster index.

**3. Query Processing with Multi-Scale List Decoding:**

*   **Input:** Query entry, hierarchical cluster index, resolution maps.
*   **Process:**
    *   Map the query entry into the adaptive embedding space.
    *   Begin list decoding at a coarse level of the hierarchy (low dimensionality, large cluster size). This rapidly narrows down the search to a few candidate regions.
    *   Refine the search by traversing down the hierarchy to higher-resolution levels within the candidate regions. The list decoder parameters (list size, decoding algorithm) are adjusted based on the local dimensionality and density.  A smaller list size is used in high-density regions, and a larger list size is used in low-density regions.
    *   Implement a dynamic pruning mechanism.  If the list decoder produces a high-confidence set of candidate neighbors, terminate the search early.
*   **Output:**  Nearest neighbor list.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function query(query_entry):
  query_embedding = embed(query_entry)
  current_node = root_node // Start at the root of the hierarchy

  while current_node is not a leaf:
    // List decode within the current region
    candidate_codewords = list_decode(query_embedding, current_node.ecc_code)

    // Determine child node corresponding to the closest codeword
    closest_child = find_closest_child(candidate_codewords, current_node.children)

    current_node = closest_child

  // Current node is a leaf, representing a data point
  return current_node.data_point
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Resolution Map:**  Dictionary: {region_id: dimensionality}
*   **Hierarchical Cluster Index:** Tree structure with nodes representing clusters and edges representing parent-child relationships.
*   **ECC Code Dictionary:** Dictionary: {region_id: ECC code parameters}
