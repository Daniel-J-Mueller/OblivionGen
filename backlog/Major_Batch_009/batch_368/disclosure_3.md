## Adaptive Replication Granularity

**Specification:** Implement a system for dynamically adjusting replication granularity beyond the logfile entry level described in the base patent. Current circular replication appears to treat the logfile as a singular unit of replication. This adaptation proposes breaking the logfile into smaller, independently replicable ‘shards.’

**Components:**

*   **Shard Manager:** A module residing on each node responsible for dividing the incoming data stream into shards. Shard size will be configurable, dynamically adjusted based on network conditions and node load.
*   **Replication Policy Engine:** A module analyzing incoming data types and assigning priority/replication policies to individual shards.  For example, critical metadata shards would have higher replication frequency and priority than less important log data.
*   **Dynamic Shard Assignment:**  A system whereby shards are not permanently assigned to specific nodes, but are dynamically routed based on node availability and shard priority. This introduces a form of ‘sharding’ within the circular replication structure.
*   **Conflict Resolution Protocol:** A mechanism to handle potential conflicts arising from asynchronous shard replication.  Timestamping, versioning, and potentially a voting system could be employed.
*   **Heartbeat Extension:** Modify heartbeat messages to include shard status information (e.g., last replicated timestamp, replication success/failure flags).

**Operation:**

1.  Incoming data is received by a node.
2.  The Shard Manager divides the data into shards based on configurable parameters.
3.  The Replication Policy Engine assigns a replication priority/policy to each shard.
4.  Each shard is routed to downstream nodes based on the priority policy and node availability.
5.  Downstream nodes replicate the shard to their own downstream nodes.
6.  Heartbeat messages are extended to include shard status information.
7.  If a node fails, the system uses shard status data in heartbeats to determine which shards need to be recovered and from which nodes.
8.  Conflict resolution protocol handles any data inconsistencies.

**Pseudocode (Shard Manager):**

```
function createShards(data, shardSize):
  shards = []
  currentShard = []
  for item in data:
    currentShard.append(item)
    if len(currentShard) >= shardSize:
      shards.append(currentShard)
      currentShard = []
  if len(currentShard) > 0:
    shards.append(currentShard)
  return shards

function assignPriority(shard, dataType):
  if dataType == "critical_metadata":
    priority = 1  # Highest
  elif dataType == "transaction_log":
    priority = 2
  else:
    priority = 3  # Lowest
  return priority

function routeShard(shard, priority, downstreamNodes):
  # Implement logic to select downstream node based on priority and load
  selectedNode = selectNode(downstreamNodes, priority)
  sendShard(shard, selectedNode)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Improved Scalability:**  Allows for finer-grained scaling of the replication system.
*   **Reduced Latency:**  Critical data can be replicated with lower latency.
*   **Enhanced Resilience:**  Failure of a single node has a limited impact on the overall system.
*   **Optimized Bandwidth Usage:**  Less critical data can be replicated with lower frequency.
