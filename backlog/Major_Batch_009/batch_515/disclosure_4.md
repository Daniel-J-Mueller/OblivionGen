## Secure Data ‘Ghosting’ with Temporal Key Derivation

**Concept:** Extend the sanitization mode functionality to not simply erase, but to create a ‘ghost’ of the data using a temporally-derived key, rendering recovery extremely difficult even with advanced forensic techniques. This moves beyond simple cryptographic erasure to a probabilistic data obfuscation scheme.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:** Storage device with a secure enclave/Trusted Platform Module (TPM) capable of generating and storing keys, and performing cryptographic operations independent of the main processor.
*   **Firmware:** Modified storage device controller firmware to implement the ‘Ghosting’ mode, alongside the existing sanitization mode.
*   **Key Derivation:** The key used for ‘ghosting’ is *not* stored persistently. Instead, it is derived from a combination of:
    *   A root key stored securely in the TPM.
    *   A time-based seed (e.g., high-resolution timestamp during the ‘ghosting’ operation).
    *   Hardware-specific entropy sources (e.g., thermal noise, jitter from the clock oscillator).
    *   A unique device identifier.
*   **‘Ghosting’ Process:**
    1.  Upon entering ‘Ghosting’ mode (initiated during boot sequence, authenticated via boot firmware), the root key and time-based seed are combined with hardware entropy and the device ID to derive a unique, session-specific key.
    2.  The data on the storage medium is XORed with the derived key.  Multiple passes with different key derivations (using slightly adjusted time seeds) are performed for increased obfuscation.
    3.  The derived key is *never* stored. It exists only in the secure enclave during the XOR operation.
    4.  The secure enclave *overwrites* the root key after the operation is complete, rendering the previous derivation impossible. A new root key is generated (and secured) during the next boot sequence.
*   **Verification:**  A ‘Verification’ mode allows the system to confirm the data is successfully ‘ghosted’, but *cannot* reconstruct the original data. This involves re-deriving a key (using the *last known* root key and the approximate time of the ghosting operation) and attempting to XOR the data. A successful XOR produces random noise, while a failed XOR (due to incorrect key derivation) would reveal fragments of the original data.
*   **Boot Sequence Integration:**  The boot firmware must be modified to support:
    *   Securely requesting the ‘Ghosting’ mode.
    *   Providing a timeframe within which the ‘Ghosting’ operation is expected to complete.
    *   Authenticating the request to prevent unauthorized access to the ‘Ghosting’ mode.
*   **API:** A secure API exposed to the boot firmware to initiate and monitor the ‘Ghosting’ operation.

**Pseudocode (Firmware - Ghosting Function):**

```
function GhostData(rootKey, timeframe) {
  entropy = GatherHardwareEntropy();
  timestamp = GetHighResolutionTimestamp();
  derivedKey = DeriveKey(rootKey, timestamp, entropy, deviceID);

  for (i = 0; i < numberOfPasses; i++) {
    // XOR each sector of storage medium with derivedKey
    for (each sector in storageMedium) {
      sectorData = ReadSector(sector);
      ghostedData = XOR(sectorData, derivedKey);
      WriteSector(sector, ghostedData);
    }

    // Slightly modify timestamp for subsequent passes
    timestamp += timeIncrement;
  }

  // Overwrite root key in secure enclave
  OverwriteRootKey(GenerateNewRootKey());
}
```

**Novelty:** This goes beyond simply erasing or encrypting data. By *not* storing the key used for obfuscation and constantly rotating the root key, it creates a significantly higher barrier to data recovery, even with sophisticated forensic techniques. The temporal component adds another layer of complexity, as recovering the key requires knowing the exact time of the operation.
