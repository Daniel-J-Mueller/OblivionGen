## Adaptive Haptic Feedback Case

**Concept:** An earbud case incorporating localized haptic feedback to indicate earbud status (charging, paired, low battery) and even act as a simplified notification system.

**Specs:**

*   **Case Material:** Rigid polymer shell with embedded micro-actuators. Preferably a material with good vibrational transmission.
*   **Actuator Array:** 9x9 grid of micro-actuators embedded within the case’s exterior surface. Each actuator capable of independent vibration.
*   **Power Source:**  Integrated into case battery – utilize existing charging circuitry.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection to earbuds and paired device (smartphone).
*   **Software/Firmware:**
    *   Earbud Status Mapping:  Firmware maps earbud charging/connection status to specific actuator patterns.
        *   Charging: Pulsating vibration in the earbud slot location. Intensity reflects charge level.
        *   Paired: Static, low-intensity vibration in the earbud slot.
        *   Low Battery:  Rapid, rhythmic vibration in the earbud slot.
    *   Notification Mode:  User-configurable mapping of smartphone notifications to haptic patterns across the actuator array.
        *   User selects notification categories (calls, texts, email, etc.).
        *   Firmware translates each category to a distinct vibration pattern (e.g., a sweeping wave across the array for a call, a localized pulse for a text).
        *   Intensity and speed customizable via companion app.
*   **Companion App (Smartphone):**
    *   Configuration: User interface to customize haptic patterns, intensity, and notification mappings.
    *   Calibration:  Algorithm to calibrate actuators for consistent performance across different case units.
* **Dimensions/Form Factor:**  Maintain compatibility with existing earbud form factors and charging standards.

**Pseudocode (Notification handling):**

```
FUNCTION handleNotification(notificationType, data)
    IF notificationType == "CALL" THEN
        pattern = "SWEEP_ARRAY" // Sweep vibration across the entire actuator array
        intensity = HIGH
        speed = MEDIUM
    ELSE IF notificationType == "TEXT" THEN
        pattern = "LOCALIZED_PULSE" // Single, localized pulse in the center of the array
        intensity = MEDIUM
        speed = FAST
    ELSE IF notificationType == "EMAIL" THEN
        pattern = "WAVE_PATTERN" // Ripple effect originating from one side of the array
        intensity = LOW
        speed = SLOW
    ELSE
        // Default pattern
        pattern = "STATIC_PULSE"
        intensity = LOW
        speed = SLOW
    ENDIF

    activateActuators(pattern, intensity, speed)
END FUNCTION
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   Integration with voice assistants (Siri, Google Assistant) to allow voice control over haptic feedback settings.
*   Advanced haptic algorithms to create more complex and nuanced vibration patterns.
*   Exploration of different actuator technologies (e.g., piezoelectric, electromagnetic) to optimize performance and power consumption.
*   Development of a 'learning mode' where the case adapts to user preferences based on haptic feedback responses.
