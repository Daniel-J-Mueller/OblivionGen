## Dynamic Resource ‘Shadowing’ for Predictive Scaling & Rollback

**Specification:** Implement a system where, alongside a ‘live’ stack of resources, a ‘shadow’ stack mirroring the live stack is maintained. The shadow stack receives a *stream* of anticipated changes – modifications defined in templates *before* they are applied to the live stack. 

**Core Functionality:**

1.  **Change Stream Ingestion:** The system accepts templates representing desired stack states *ahead* of actual deployment. These are treated as ‘predicted’ changes.

2.  **Shadow Stack Application:** The predicted changes are applied *solely* to the shadow stack.  This allows for ‘dry-run’ testing of the changes *without* impacting live services.

3.  **Performance & Dependency Analysis:** The shadow stack undergoes continuous monitoring.  Key performance indicators (KPIs) are tracked, and dependency validations are performed.  The system models the *predicted impact* of the changes.

4.  **Rollback Prediction & Pre-Provisioning:**  If the shadow stack analysis indicates a negative impact (performance degradation, dependency conflicts), the system *pre-provisions* the resources required to roll back to the last known good state – *before* the live stack is modified. This means having the rollback resources allocated but idle.

5.  **Live Stack Update & Monitoring:** Once the shadow stack analysis is positive, the live stack is updated with the changes.  The live stack is monitored *concurrently* with the shadow stack. Any deviation from predicted behavior on the live stack triggers an immediate rollback to the pre-provisioned state.

6.  **Dynamic Shadow Stack Scaling:** The shadow stack's resource allocation should dynamically scale based on the complexity of the predicted changes.  A simple configuration change requires fewer shadow resources than a full application rewrite.

**Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessTemplate(template, stackID):
    shadowStackID = GenerateShadowID(stackID)
    
    // Apply template to shadow stack
    ApplyTemplate(template, shadowStackID)
    
    // Run performance/dependency analysis on shadow stack
    analysisResults = AnalyzeStack(shadowStackID)
    
    IF analysisResults.isPositive():
        // Pre-provision rollback resources
        PreProvisionRollback(stackID)
        
        // Apply template to live stack
        ApplyTemplate(template, stackID)
        
        // Monitor live stack for deviations
        MonitorLiveStack(stackID, expectedResults)
        
        IF DeviationDetected():
            RollbackToPreProvisionedState(stackID)
    ELSE:
        LogNegativeAnalysis(template, analysisResults)
        // Alert operator/trigger automated mitigation
        AlertOperator(template, analysisResults)
```

**Innovation:**

This moves beyond reactive rollback (responding *after* a failure) to *predictive* rollback.  By analyzing changes on a shadow stack *before* they impact live services, the system proactively prepares for potential failures. The pre-provisioned rollback resources drastically reduce recovery time and minimize service disruption. This also allows for ‘what-if’ scenario testing without affecting production environments.
