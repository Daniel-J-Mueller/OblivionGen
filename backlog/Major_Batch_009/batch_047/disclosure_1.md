## Adaptive Data Persistence Granularity

**Specification:** A system to dynamically adjust the granularity of data persistence – moving beyond range-based persistence to object-level or even field-level persistence based on real-time access patterns and predicted data volatility.

**Components:**

*   **Access Pattern Monitor:** Continuously monitors data access frequency and patterns within system memory. This can utilize hardware performance counters and software hooks.
*   **Volatility Predictor:** Employs machine learning (specifically, time series forecasting and anomaly detection) to predict the volatility of individual data objects or fields. Volatility is defined as the probability of data modification within a given timeframe.
*   **Granularity Manager:** Controls the level of persistence.  It receives input from the Access Pattern Monitor and Volatility Predictor. Levels include:
    *   **Coarse:** Range-based persistence (as in the reference patent).
    *   **Medium:** Object-level persistence – individual objects are identified and persisted/restored.
    *   **Fine:** Field-level persistence – individual fields *within* objects are identified and persisted/restored.
*   **Persistence Engine:** Manages the actual copying of data to non-volatile storage and restoration from it, driven by the Granularity Manager.
*   **Mapping Database:** Stores mappings between in-memory data locations (object/field addresses) and corresponding locations on non-volatile storage. This database is crucial for efficient restoration.

**Pseudocode (Granularity Manager):**

```
function managePersistence(dataObject, field) {
  accessFrequency = AccessPatternMonitor.getFrequency(dataObject, field);
  volatility = VolatilityPredictor.predictVolatility(dataObject, field);

  if (accessFrequency > HIGH_THRESHOLD && volatility < LOW_THRESHOLD) {
    persistenceLevel = FINE; // Field-level persistence
  } else if (accessFrequency > MEDIUM_THRESHOLD && volatility < MEDIUM_THRESHOLD) {
    persistenceLevel = MEDIUM; // Object-level persistence
  } else {
    persistenceLevel = COARSE; // Range-based persistence
  }

  PersistenceEngine.setPersistenceLevel(dataObject, field, persistenceLevel);
}

onDataWrite(dataObject, field) {
  managePersistence(dataObject, field);
  PersistenceEngine.writeData(dataObject, field); //Persist data at the determined level
}

onSystemFailure() {
  //Trigger data recovery based on mapping database.
  PersistenceEngine.recoverData();
}
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Access Pattern Entry:**  `{objectAddress: int, fieldName: string, accessCount: int, lastAccessTime: timestamp}`
*   **Volatility Prediction Entry:** `{objectAddress: int, fieldName: string, volatilityScore: float, predictionTime: timestamp}`
*   **Persistence Mapping Entry:** `{objectAddress: int, fieldName: string, storageLocation: int}`

**Implementation Considerations:**

*   **NV-DIMM Integration:**  Leverage NV-DIMMs for fast persistence.
*   **Asynchronous Persistence:**  Use asynchronous operations to minimize performance impact.
*   **Data Compression/Deduplication:**  Reduce storage requirements.
*   **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:**  Adapt the thresholds for access frequency and volatility based on system load and usage patterns.
*   **Security:** Encrypt persisted data for protection against unauthorized access.
