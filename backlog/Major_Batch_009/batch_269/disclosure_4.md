## Adaptive Animation Complexity based on User Gaze

**Specification:** A system that dynamically adjusts the fidelity of 3D animation curves based on where the user is looking on the display.

**Core Concept:** The patent details animation curve *reduction* based on device capabilities. This builds on that by adding a *user-centric* dimension – prioritizing animation fidelity where the user is actively looking.

**System Components:**

*   **Eye Tracker Integration:**  Hardware and/or software to determine the user’s gaze point on the display.  Could be integrated directly into the device (e.g., phone camera-based), or utilize external tracking hardware.
*   **Gaze-Weighted Region Definition:** The display area is divided into regions.  A ‘heat map’ is dynamically created. The center of the user’s gaze is assigned a high weight. Regions further from the gaze receive diminishing weights.
*   **Animation Curve Fidelity Mapping:** Animation curves are associated with specific visual elements (UI objects).  Each curve has a defined ‘base fidelity’ (number of samples).
*   **Dynamic Fidelity Adjustment Algorithm:**

    ```pseudocode
    function adjustFidelity(animationCurve, gazeWeight, regionWeight):
        targetFidelity = baseFidelity * (gazeWeight * regionWeight)
        
        // Ensure targetFidelity is within acceptable bounds.
        targetFidelity = clamp(targetFidelity, minFidelity, maxFidelity)
        
        //Reduce or expand animation curve based on targetFidelity.
        if targetFidelity < currentFidelity:
            reduceCurveSamples(animationCurve, currentFidelity - targetFidelity)
        else if targetFidelity > currentFidelity:
            expandCurveSamples(animationCurve, targetFidelity - currentFidelity)
    ```
*   **Rendering Pipeline Integration:** The rendering engine receives adjusted animation curves. Fidelity changes are applied *per frame* based on gaze tracking.
*   **Smoothing Filter:** A temporal smoothing filter (e.g., moving average) is applied to fidelity adjustments to prevent jarring transitions.

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Gaze Weight:** A function that maps gaze distance to a weight (0.0 - 1.0).  Direct gaze = 1.0.  Periphery = 0.0.
*   **Region Weight:** A factor based on the area of the display. Larger areas (e.g., full screen) could have lower weights to reduce computational load.
*   **Curve Reduction/Expansion:** Existing curve reduction techniques (e.g., the methods described in the original patent) are used, but the *amount* of reduction/expansion is controlled by the `targetFidelity`.
*   **Priority System:** A prioritization scheme for curves. Essential UI elements (e.g., buttons) always maintain a minimum fidelity, regardless of gaze.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Mobile Gaming:** Optimize performance by reducing animation complexity in areas the user isn’t focusing on.
*   **AR/VR Applications:** Enhance realism by dynamically adjusting fidelity based on gaze direction.
*   **User Interfaces:** Create smoother, more responsive UIs, especially on resource-constrained devices.
*   **Educational Software:** Highlight key elements of a simulation or visualization.
