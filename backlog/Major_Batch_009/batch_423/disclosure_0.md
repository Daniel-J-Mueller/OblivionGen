## Adaptive Priority Burst Scheduling with Predictive Congestion

**Concept:** The core idea stems from the patent’s handling of data priority, but extends it beyond simple prioritization to a dynamic, predictive burst scheduling system. Instead of *reacting* to contention on the RACH, this system *anticipates* it and pre-allocates resources based on learned user behavior and network conditions. It introduces a “congestion shadow” – a predictive model of future RACH load, derived from historical data and real-time observations.

**System Specs:**

**1. UT (User Terminal) Enhancements:**

*   **Behavioral Profiling Module:** Continuously monitors data transmission patterns – burst size, frequency, priority tags – and builds a user-specific behavioral profile. This profile is stored locally and updated with each transmission.
*   **Predictive Burst Size Estimation:**  Uses the behavioral profile to estimate the likely size of the *next* burst of data, even *before* the data is generated.  This is based on the historical distribution of burst sizes for that user, weighted by recent activity.
*   **Proactive ‘Intent’ Signal:**  Instead of *only* sending the SBDS message when data is ready, the UT periodically sends a low-bandwidth “intent” signal indicating the *predicted* burst size and priority. This signal is sent even when no data is immediately available. The frequency of intent signals is adaptive, based on user activity.
*   **Multi-Channel Intent Signaling:**  UT employs multiple low-power channels for intent signaling to mitigate interference and improve reliability.
*   **Adaptive Signal Strength Adjustment:** UT adjusts the signal strength of intent signals based on downlink signal quality to maximize reach without causing excessive interference.

**2. Satellite Enhancements:**

*   **Congestion Shadow Model:** A machine learning model trained on historical RACH contention data, real-time RACH load, and UT intent signals.  The model predicts future RACH load with a defined confidence interval.
*   **Dynamic Resource Allocation Engine:** Uses the Congestion Shadow Model and UT intent signals to dynamically allocate uplink resources *before* the UT requests them.  Allocations are probabilistic, based on the confidence interval of the Congestion Shadow Model.
*   **Burst Coalescing Algorithm:** If multiple UTs are predicted to have similar bursts at the same time, the algorithm attempts to coalesce them into a single, larger transmission window, optimizing bandwidth utilization.
*   **Grant Revocation Mechanism:** If a UT fails to utilize a pre-allocated grant within a defined timeframe, the grant is revoked and re-allocated to another user.
*   **Feedback Loop:** A mechanism for the satellite to provide feedback to the UT on the accuracy of its predicted burst sizes. This feedback is used to refine the UT’s behavioral profile and improve the accuracy of future predictions.
*   **Multi-Tiered Prioritization:** Beyond simple priority tags, the system introduces multiple tiers of prioritization based on data type (e.g., real-time video vs. background data). Each tier has a corresponding resource allocation weight.

**3. Pseudocode (Satellite - Dynamic Resource Allocation):**

```
// Inputs:  UT Intent Signals (predicted burst size, priority),
//          Real-time RACH Load,
//          Congestion Shadow Model

function allocateResources() {
  // 1.  Retrieve Intent Signals from all UTs
  intentSignals = getUTIntentSignals();

  // 2.  Predict future RACH load using Congestion Shadow Model
  predictedRACHLoad = CongestionShadowModel.predict(intentSignals, realTimeRACHLoad);

  // 3.  Calculate Resource Allocation Weights based on priority and predicted load
  for each UT in intentSignals {
    allocationWeight = UT.priority * (1 - predictedRACHLoad);
    //Adjust weight based on UT behavioral profile (historical data)
    allocationWeight += UT.behavioralProfile.weightModifier;
  }

  // 4.  Allocate Resources based on Allocation Weights
  resourceGrants = allocateResourcesBasedOnWeights(allocationWeights, availableResources);

  // 5.  Send Resource Grants to UTs
  sendResourceGrants(resourceGrants);
}
```

**Novelty:**

This system differs significantly from the original patent by shifting from reactive to proactive resource allocation. The predictive nature, combined with behavioral profiling and dynamic prioritization, allows for more efficient bandwidth utilization and reduced RACH contention. It creates a more ‘fluid’ and responsive network, capable of adapting to changing user demands and network conditions. It also introduces a feedback loop, which is crucial for improving the accuracy of predictions and optimizing performance over time.
