## Adaptive Notification Haptic Patterns

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple intensity levels of vibration or sound and leverage haptic feedback to convey *information* within notifications – not just alert the user, but communicate the *type* of notification without requiring visual confirmation.

**Specifications:**

**1. Haptic Library & Mapping:**

*   **Haptic Primitives:** Define a set of fundamental haptic patterns. Examples:
    *   *Pulse Wave:*  Short, sharp bursts – indicates urgent/time-sensitive notifications (e.g., alarms, critical system alerts).
    *   *Sweep:* A vibration that moves across the device surface – signifies informational notifications (e.g., news headlines, weather updates).
    *   *Ripple:* A localized vibration expanding outwards – represents social interactions (e.g., messages, mentions).
    *   *Texture:*  Rapid, subtle vibrations creating a perceived texture – flags specific app categories or sender types (e.g., finance apps, VIP contacts).
*   **Dynamic Mapping:** Employ a machine learning model to dynamically map notification types to appropriate haptic primitives. This model is trainable based on:
    *   *App Category:* Notifications from finance apps trigger ‘Texture’ haptics, while social media uses ‘Ripple’.
    *   *Sender/Contact Priority:* VIP contacts receive distinct haptic patterns compared to unknown senders.
    *   *Content Analysis:* Use NLP to analyze notification content (e.g., "Low battery" triggers a specific haptic signifying system status).
    *   *User Preferences:* Allow users to customize haptic mappings for specific apps or contacts.

**2.  Haptic ‘Layers’ & Complexity:**

*   **Layered Haptics:** Combine multiple haptic primitives to create more nuanced notifications. For example: ‘Sweep’ for informational content *combined with* a subtle ‘Pulse Wave’ if the information is time-sensitive.
*   **Haptic ‘Sequences’:**  Create short sequences of haptic patterns to convey more complex information.  e.g. “Short Pulse + Long Sweep” could indicate “New email from VIP contact”.
*   **Variable Intensity within Patterns:**  Control the *intensity* not just of the overall vibration, but of *components within* the haptic pattern.  A ‘Sweep’ could start subtly and gradually increase in intensity to draw attention.

**3.  Sensor Integration & Contextual Adaptation:**

*   **Grip Detection:** Utilize touch sensors to determine *how* the user is holding the device. Adapt haptic feedback to maximize perceived clarity. (e.g., stronger vibrations if the device is held loosely).
*   **Activity Recognition:**  Integrate with activity recognition sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope). Adjust haptic intensity and complexity based on user activity (e.g., reduce vibration intensity during running/exercise).
*   **Environmental Noise Cancellation:** Use microphone data to adjust haptic feedback. Increase vibration intensity in noisy environments to ensure the notification is perceived.

**4. Pseudocode - Haptic Notification Engine:**

```
function generateHapticFeedback(notificationData):
  notificationType = notificationData.type
  senderPriority = notificationData.senderPriority
  contentSummary = analyzeNotificationContent(notificationData)
  userPreferences = getUserHapticPreferences()

  hapticPattern = selectDefaultHapticPattern(notificationType)

  if senderPriority == "VIP":
    hapticPattern = enhanceHapticPattern(hapticPattern, "VIP")

  if contentSummary contains "urgent":
    hapticPattern = addUrgencyToHapticPattern(hapticPattern)

  hapticPattern = applyUserPreferences(hapticPattern, userPreferences)

  hapticPattern = adaptToContext(hapticPattern, sensorData)

  playHapticPattern(hapticPattern)
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-fidelity haptic actuator (linear resonant actuator or similar)
*   Multiple touch sensors integrated into device chassis
*   Accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone.
*   Sufficient processing power for real-time sensor data analysis and haptic pattern generation.
