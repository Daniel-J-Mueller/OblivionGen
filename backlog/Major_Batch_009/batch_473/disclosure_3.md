## Adaptive Fragment Obfuscation via Chaotic Mapping

**Concept:** Extend the existing fragmentation and encryption scheme by introducing a chaotic mapping function applied *after* the initial XOR encryption but *before* storage. This adds an additional layer of obfuscation, making reconstruction significantly more difficult without the correct chaotic key – even if the primary encryption keys are compromised. The chaotic mapping operates on the bit patterns of the encrypted fragments, effectively ‘shuffling’ them in a deterministic but complex manner.

**Specs:**

*   **Chaotic Map Selection:** Implement a library of at least three different chaotic maps (e.g., Logistic Map, Henon Map, Tinkerbell Map). The map used for a particular data file (or fragment set) is determined by a seed value generated from a high-entropy source (e.g., hardware random number generator) and combined with file metadata.
*   **Fragment-Specific Keys:**  Each fragment should have its own unique key derived from the chaotic map seed and a fragment identifier. This ensures that even if one fragment’s obfuscation key is discovered, it doesn’t compromise others.
*   **Mapping Granularity:**  The chaotic map should operate on bit-blocks within the encrypted fragment.  Experiment with block sizes of 8, 16, and 32 bits to optimize for security and performance.
*   **Reverse Mapping:**  A robust reverse mapping function must be implemented to undo the chaotic transformation during reconstruction.  This function requires the same seed, fragment identifier, and block size as the forward mapping.
*   **Key Management:** Chaotic map seeds and fragment identifiers should be stored securely, ideally using a key derivation function (KDF) based on a master encryption key.
*   **Storage Metadata:** Include metadata with each fragment indicating the chosen chaotic map, the fragment identifier, and the block size used for mapping.

**Pseudocode (Obfuscation):**

```
function obfuscate_fragment(encrypted_fragment, chaotic_map_seed, fragment_id, block_size):
  metadata = {
    "chaotic_map_seed": chaotic_map_seed,
    "fragment_id": fragment_id,
    "block_size": block_size
  }

  bit_blocks = split_into_blocks(encrypted_fragment, block_size)
  
  for i in range(len(bit_blocks)):
    mapped_block = apply_chaotic_map(bit_blocks[i], chaotic_map_seed, fragment_id, i)
    bit_blocks[i] = mapped_block
  
  obfuscated_fragment = combine_blocks(bit_blocks)
  return obfuscated_fragment, metadata
```

**Pseudocode (Deobfuscation):**

```
function deobfuscate_fragment(obfuscated_fragment, metadata):
  chaotic_map_seed = metadata["chaotic_map_seed"]
  fragment_id = metadata["fragment_id"]
  block_size = metadata["block_size"]

  bit_blocks = split_into_blocks(obfuscated_fragment, block_size)
  
  for i in range(len(bit_blocks)):
    original_block = reverse_apply_chaotic_map(bit_blocks[i], chaotic_map_seed, fragment_id, i)
    bit_blocks[i] = original_block
  
  original_fragment = combine_blocks(bit_blocks)
  return original_fragment
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **Dynamic Map Selection:** Adaptively choose the chaotic map based on network conditions, data sensitivity, or detected intrusion attempts.
*   **Multi-Level Mapping:** Apply multiple chaotic maps in sequence for increased obfuscation.
*   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate the chaotic map seeds to minimize the impact of key compromise.
*   **Hardware Acceleration:** Implement the chaotic mapping functions in hardware for improved performance.
