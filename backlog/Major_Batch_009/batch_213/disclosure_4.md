## Modular Scanner Array - "Chameleon"

**Concept:** A pedestal scanner comprised of dynamically configurable, individual scanning modules. Instead of a fixed scanner head, the pedestal supports an array of smaller, identical scanning units that can physically re-position and activate/deactivate independently. This allows for variable scan resolution, adaptable scan shapes, and redundancy.

**Hardware Specs:**

*   **Pedestal Base:** Circular base, 60cm diameter, constructed from aluminum alloy. Includes internal wiring harness and power supply.
*   **Scanning Modules:** 20 identical modules, each approximately 10cm x 10cm x 5cm.  Each module contains:
    *   Solid-state LiDAR sensor (range: 0.1m - 10m)
    *   Miniature pan/tilt mechanism (range: +/- 45 degrees pan, +/- 30 degrees tilt)
    *   RGB Camera (12MP, 30fps) â€“ integrated with LiDAR data for color point clouds.
    *   Wireless communication module (802.11ax) for data transmission.
    *   Embedded processor (ARM Cortex-A72) for local processing and control.
    *   Magnetic mounting base for secure attachment to the pedestal.
*   **Mounting System:** Pedestal surface is a grid of electromagnetic locking points. Modules attach via magnetic force, and are locked into position via localized electromagnetic field activation.  Allows for rapid reconfiguration.
*   **Power Distribution:** Wireless power transfer to each module via inductive charging pads integrated into the pedestal.
*   **Cooling:** Passive heat dissipation via aluminum housing of each module.

**Software/Control Logic (Pseudocode):**

```pseudocode
// Main Control Loop

while (scanning) {

  // 1.  Receive scan parameters (target area, resolution, desired scan shape)

  // 2.  Path Planning Algorithm:
  //     -  Divide target area into scan sectors.
  //     -  Assign scan sectors to available modules.
  //     -  Optimize module positioning (pan/tilt) to minimize scan time & maximize coverage.
  //     -  Consider occlusion avoidance (based on pre-mapped environment or real-time obstacle detection).

  // 3.  Module Activation:
  //     -  Activate assigned modules (power on, initialize sensors).
  //     -  Send pan/tilt instructions to each module.

  // 4.  Data Acquisition:
  //     -  Each module scans assigned sector.
  //     -  LiDAR data & RGB images transmitted wirelessly to central processing unit.

  // 5.  Data Fusion & Point Cloud Generation:
  //     -  Combine data from all modules into a single, coherent point cloud.
  //     -  Apply data filtering & noise reduction algorithms.

  // 6.  Output:  Generate 3D model or other desired output format.
}
```

**Operational Modes:**

*   **High-Resolution Scan:**  All modules focused on a small area for ultra-detailed scanning.
*   **Wide-Area Scan:** Modules dispersed to cover a larger volume quickly.
*   **Dynamic Shape Scan:**  Modules arranged to conform to a non-standard shape (e.g., scan the interior of a curved object).
*   **Redundancy Mode:** If one module fails, surrounding modules automatically adjust to cover its area.
*   **Adaptive Scanning:** System learns the environment and dynamically adjusts module placement based on scan history.
