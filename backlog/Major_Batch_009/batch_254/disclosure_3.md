## Predictive Maintenance & Augmented Reality Integration - Switchgear Controller

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:** Integration of a predictive maintenance module utilizing machine learning algorithms into the existing Switchgear Controller device.
*   **Data Sources:**
    *   Real-time data streams from all upstream and downstream components (as currently captured by the controller).
    *   Historical operational data (logged by the controller).
    *   Environmental data (temperature, humidity – via optional external sensor integration).
    *   Component-specific degradation models (populated and updated via cloud connection – see ‘Software Updates’).
*   **Predictive Engine:**
    *   Algorithm: Hybrid approach – combining time-series analysis (e.g., LSTM networks) with anomaly detection (e.g., autoencoders).
    *   Focus: Predicting potential failures of critical components (circuit breakers, UPS components, transformers, etc.) *before* they occur.
    *   Output: Risk score (0-100) for each monitored component, along with estimated time to failure (if applicable).
*   **Augmented Reality Interface:**
    *   Integration with AR-compatible mobile devices/headsets.
    *   Real-time overlay of predicted component health data directly onto the physical switchgear equipment.
    *   Visual indicators:
        *   Color-coded components based on risk score (green = low, yellow = medium, red = high).
        *   Animated visualizations of potential failure modes.
        *   AR-guided troubleshooting steps (displayed directly on the equipment).
    *   Remote Expert Assistance: AR interface enables remote experts to see what the on-site technician sees and provide real-time guidance.

**Software Components:**

*   **Data Preprocessing Module:** Cleans, normalizes, and transforms raw data from various sources.
*   **Machine Learning Module:** Implements and trains the predictive models.
*   **AR Application:** Renders the AR interface and manages the interaction with the physical equipment.
*   **Communication Module:** Handles data transfer between the controller, the cloud, and the AR application.
*   **Software Updates:**  Over-the-air updates for ML models, AR application, and firmware.  Includes updated component degradation models based on fleet-wide data analysis.
*   **API Access:** Open API for integration with existing CMMS/EAM systems.

**Hardware Components (Additional):**

*   Edge Computing Module: Embedded within the controller to perform real-time data processing and predictive analysis.  Reduces latency and bandwidth requirements.
*   Optional Environmental Sensors: Wireless temperature and humidity sensors.
*   AR Headset Compatibility: Designed for compatibility with a range of AR headsets.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Maintenance Algorithm):**

```
FUNCTION predict_failure(component_data, historical_data, degradation_model):
  // Preprocess data
  processed_data = preprocess(component_data, historical_data)

  // Feature extraction
  features = extract_features(processed_data)

  // Predict risk score
  risk_score = ML_model.predict(features, degradation_model)

  // Estimate time to failure (if applicable)
  IF risk_score > threshold:
    time_to_failure = estimate_ttf(risk_score)
  ELSE:
    time_to_failure = NULL

  RETURN risk_score, time_to_failure
```

**Operational Scenario:**

A technician uses an AR headset to inspect the switchgear. The headset displays real-time risk scores for each component. A red indicator highlights a circuit breaker with a high risk score. The technician points the headset at the breaker, and the AR interface displays a detailed analysis of the potential failure mode, along with recommended maintenance steps and a parts list. The technician can then initiate a repair or replacement order directly through the AR interface. The system automatically logs all maintenance activities and updates the component degradation models.
