## Adaptive Cache Partitioning via Predictive Access Streams

**Concept:** Dynamically partition the cache based on predicted access streams derived from thread behavior, moving beyond simple lock-based granularity. This allows for proactive isolation *before* contention, not just reactive locking.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware/Software Components:**

*   **Prediction Engine:** A dedicated hardware or micro-threaded software component monitoring thread access patterns (read/write ratios, access frequency, data locality). It utilizes a Markov Model or a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to predict future access streams.  The engine should support multiple prediction models per thread.
*   **Cache Partition Manager:** A hardware component responsible for dynamically re-partitioning the cache based on predictions from the Prediction Engine.  It manages a physical cache re-mapping table.
*   **Cache Re-Mapping Table:** A table stored in fast SRAM, mapping logical cache lines to physical cache lines.  Allows for on-the-fly re-arrangement of the cache without flushing.  Must support atomic updates.
*   **Thread Metadata Store:** A per-thread data structure holding prediction model parameters, predicted access stream, and preferred cache partition identifiers.

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  **Thread Launch:** Upon thread creation, the Thread Metadata Store is initialized.  A default prediction model is assigned.
2.  **Access Monitoring:** The Prediction Engine continuously monitors each thread’s cache access patterns.
3.  **Model Training:** The Prediction Engine trains/updates the prediction model based on observed access patterns.  Learning rate is dynamically adjusted based on prediction accuracy.
4.  **Stream Prediction:** The Prediction Engine predicts the thread’s near-future access stream (sequence of cache lines).  Confidence levels are assigned to each prediction.
5.  **Partition Request:** Based on the predicted stream and confidence, the Prediction Engine requests a dedicated cache partition from the Cache Partition Manager.
6.  **Partition Allocation:** The Cache Partition Manager allocates a partition (contiguous or non-contiguous blocks of physical cache) that can accommodate the predicted stream.  Allocation policy prioritizes minimizing fragmentation and maximizing locality.
7.  **Cache Re-Mapping:** The Cache Partition Manager updates the Cache Re-Mapping Table to map the logical cache lines requested by the thread to the newly allocated physical cache lines.
8.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** If a thread's actual access pattern deviates significantly from its prediction, the Prediction Engine re-trains the model and requests a new partition.  The system gracefully handles cases where a partition cannot be immediately allocated (e.g., due to high contention).
9. **Eviction Strategy**: When a partition needs to be reclaimed, the system prioritizes partitions with low prediction confidence or threads with lower priority. A 'warm-up' period is incorporated to allow threads to re-establish their prediction models after a partition change.

**3. Pseudocode (Cache Partition Manager – Allocation):**

```pseudocode
function allocatePartition(threadID, predictedStream, streamSize, priority):
  partition = findAvailablePartition(streamSize)

  if partition == null:
    //Partition unavailable. Implement backoff/throttling/shared partition.
    return null

  //Mark partition as in use by threadID
  markPartitionInUse(partition, threadID)

  //Update Cache Re-Mapping Table
  for each cacheLine in predictedStream:
    mapLogicalToPhysical(cacheLine, partition.baseAddress + cacheLine.offset)

  return partition
```

**4. Considerations:**

*   **Partition Granularity:** Fine-grained partitions reduce contention but increase overhead. Coarse-grained partitions reduce overhead but increase contention. A dynamic adjustment of partition granularity based on system load and thread behavior is desirable.
*   **False Sharing Mitigation:** Consider non-contiguous partition allocation to minimize false sharing between threads using different partitions.
*   **Security:** Protect the Cache Re-Mapping Table from unauthorized access and modification.
*    **System Wide Awareness**: A global scheduler could integrate with this system to further optimise resource allocation to threads based on predicted cache requirements.
