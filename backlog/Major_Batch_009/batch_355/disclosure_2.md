## Dynamic Trust Score & Geofencing for Adaptive Access

**Concept:** Augment the authentication system with a dynamic trust score influenced by real-time location data (geofencing) and device behavior. This moves beyond simple credential validation to a continuous assessment of risk, enabling granular access control.

**Specs:**

**1. Trust Score Engine:**

*   **Input Factors:**
    *   **Authentication Success/Failure History:** Weight based on recency and frequency.
    *   **Device Integrity:** Checks against known compromised device lists, root/jailbreak detection.
    *   **Location Data:** (GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, cellular tower data). Comparison to known "safe" locations (home, work) or association with flagged locations (suspicious activity zones).
    *   **Behavioral Biometrics:**  Keystroke dynamics, touch patterns, app usage patterns (deviation from user baseline).
    *   **Network Data:** IP address reputation, VPN/Proxy detection.
*   **Scoring Algorithm:** Weighted sum of input factors.  Weights are configurable per user/service.  Normalization to a scale of 0-100 (0 = high risk, 100 = low risk).
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**  Trust score decays over time if no legitimate activity is detected.  Increases with successful authentications and normal device behavior.

**2. Geofencing Integration:**

*   **User-Defined Fences:**  Allow users to define "safe zones" (home, work, trusted Wi-Fi networks) within the system.
*   **Service-Defined Fences:** Services can define geofences relevant to their operations (e.g., a retail store location).
*   **Fence Breach Detection:**  Real-time monitoring of device location against defined fences.

**3. Adaptive Access Control:**

*   **Risk Thresholds:**  Define multiple risk thresholds (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
*   **Access Policies:**  Associate access policies with each risk threshold. Examples:
    *   **Low Risk:**  Full access to service.
    *   **Medium Risk:**  Multi-factor authentication required.  Reduced access to sensitive features.
    *   **High Risk:**  Account lockout.  Manual review required.
*   **Granular Permissions:**  Enable services to define permissions based on risk score.  Example: Allow location-based features only when the device is within a safe zone.

**4. System Architecture Integration:**

*   **Trust Score API:**  Provide an API for services to query the trust score for a given user/device.
*   **Real-time Event Stream:**  Publish trust score updates and fence breach events to a real-time event stream (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
*   **Data Storage:**  Store trust score history, location data, and behavioral biometrics in a scalable database.

**Pseudocode (Trust Score Calculation):**

```
function calculateTrustScore(userId, deviceId):
  // Retrieve historical data
  history = getAuthenticationHistory(userId, deviceId)
  locationData = getCurrentLocation(deviceId)
  behavioralData = getBehavioralData(userId, deviceId)

  // Calculate scores for each factor
  authScore = calculateAuthenticationScore(history)
  locationScore = calculateLocationScore(locationData)
  behaviorScore = calculateBehavioralScore(behavioralData)

  // Apply weights (configurable per user/service)
  authWeight = getConfig('authWeight', userId)
  locationWeight = getConfig('locationWeight', userId)
  behaviorWeight = getConfig('behaviorWeight', userId)

  // Calculate weighted sum
  trustScore = (authScore * authWeight) + (locationScore * locationWeight) + (behaviorScore * behaviorWeight)

  // Normalize to 0-100
  trustScore = map(trustScore, 0, 100) // Assuming appropriate mapping function

  return trustScore
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond static authentication to a continuous assessment of risk, enabling more granular and adaptive access control. By combining location data, behavioral biometrics, and authentication history, it provides a more comprehensive picture of user trust.  The dynamic nature of the trust score allows for real-time adjustments to access policies, enhancing security and user experience.
