## Adaptive Haptic Feedback for Predicted Selections

**Specification:** Integrate localized haptic feedback with the user input prediction system. Instead of *only* acting on the highest probability selection, provide subtly increasing haptic feedback to *multiple* likely selections (top 3-5).  The intensity of the haptic feedback should scale with the probability score assigned by the prediction algorithm.

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-resolution haptic actuator array beneath the touchscreen surface.  Individual actuators must be capable of delivering distinct and localized vibrations.
*   Touchscreen controller capable of coordinating haptic feedback with display updates and input processing.

**Software Components:**

1.  **Probability Mapping Module:** This module receives probability scores for each selectable object from the existing prediction algorithm. It creates a spatial map of probability values, assigning a value to each object’s location on the touchscreen.
2.  **Haptic Intensity Scaling:** A function to map probability scores to haptic feedback intensity.  This allows for fine-grained control over the vibration strength. Example: `intensity = probability * max_intensity;`  `max_intensity` is a configurable parameter.
3.  **Haptic Feedback Controller:** Responsible for driving the haptic actuators based on the probability map and scaled intensity values.  It should smooth transitions between feedback levels to avoid jarring sensations.
4.  **User Calibration Module:**  Allows users to customize the intensity scaling and feedback characteristics to their preferences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On User Touch Input:

1.  Get predicted probabilities for selectable objects from prediction algorithm.
2.  Create probability map.
3.  Scale probabilities to haptic intensity values.
4.  For each selectable object with intensity > threshold:
    Activate corresponding haptic actuator with calculated intensity.
5.  Monitor user touch duration and position.
6.  If user lifts finger before definite selection:
    Deactivate all haptic actuators.

7.  If user selects an object *not* predicted as highest probability:
    Record this as negative feedback to refine prediction model.
```

**Refinement & Expansion:**

*   **Directional Haptics:** Use the haptic array to create a subtle “pull” towards the most likely selection, guiding the user’s finger.
*   **Dynamic Threshold:**  Adjust the minimum intensity threshold based on ambient noise and user activity.
*   **Multi-Modal Feedback:** Combine haptic feedback with subtle visual cues (e.g., highlighting the predicted object with a faint glow).
*   **Integration with Accessibility Features:** Allow users with visual impairments to rely heavily on haptic feedback for navigation and selection.
*    **Personalized Haptic Profiles:** Store user preferences for haptic feedback (intensity, pattern, duration) and load them automatically.
*   **Predictive Pulse:** Initiate a brief, escalating haptic pulse on the highest probability selection *before* the user fully commits to a touch, offering a preemptive confirmation.
