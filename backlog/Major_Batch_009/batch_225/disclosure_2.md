## Dynamic Affect-Based Recommendation Refinement

**Concept:** Expand upon the user deselect functionality by introducing *real-time affect recognition* (via webcam/microphone) to dynamically refine recommendations, moving beyond explicit 'dislike' signals to implicit emotional responses.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Affect Recognition Module:**
    *   Input: Live webcam feed and/or microphone input.
    *   Processing: Utilize a pre-trained emotion classification model (Facial Expression Recognition, Voice Tone Analysis – potentially fused). Output a vector representing detected emotional state (e.g., valence, arousal, dominance, specific emotion labels: happy, sad, frustrated, etc.). This must operate in near real-time (<200ms latency).
    *   Calibration: Initial user calibration phase to personalize affect recognition – adjust sensitivity thresholds, account for individual expression nuances.

2.  **Recommendation Adjustment Logic:**
    *   `affect_vector`:  Real-time output from Affect Recognition Module.
    *   `candidate_recommendations`:  Current set of ranked candidate items (as per existing patent).
    *   `displayed_recommendations`:  Subset of `candidate_recommendations` currently visible to the user.
    *   `thresholds`: Pre-defined emotional thresholds for triggering recommendation adjustments. (e.g., High Frustration = Aggressive Filtering; Low Arousal = Increased Diversity).

    **Pseudocode:**

    ```
    function adjust_recommendations(affect_vector, candidate_recommendations, displayed_recommendations, thresholds):
        if affect_vector.frustration > thresholds.high_frustration:
            # Aggressively filter out items similar to currently viewed/displayed items
            filtered_recommendations = remove_similar_items(candidate_recommendations, displayed_recommendations, similarity_threshold=0.8)
            return filtered_recommendations

        elif affect_vector.sadness > thresholds.high_sadness:
            # Increase the diversity of recommendations - show items from entirely different categories
            diverse_recommendations = get_diverse_items(candidate_recommendations, num_categories=5)
            return diverse_recommendations

        elif affect_vector.low_arousal > thresholds.low_arousal:
            # Show more visually stimulating items (high color saturation, dynamic content)
            stimulating_recommendations = filter_by_visual_stimulation(candidate_recommendations)
            return stimulating_recommendations

        else:
            # No significant affect detected - return original recommendations
            return candidate_recommendations
    ```

3.  **User Interface Integration:**
    *   Subtle visual indicator to denote affect recognition is active (e.g., small icon near webcam).
    *   Option for user to disable affect recognition.
    *   Potential for "Explain Recommendation" feature - "This item was recommended because you appeared frustrated, and this item is known to be relaxing/engaging".

4.  **Data Collection & Model Training:**
    *   Anonymized affect data paired with user interactions (clicks, purchases) to continuously refine emotion-to-recommendation mappings.
    *   A/B testing to validate the effectiveness of affect-based recommendations.

5.  **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Webcam and Microphone capable of capturing clear audio and video.
    *   Sufficient processing power to run emotion classification model in real-time (GPU acceleration recommended).



This system moves beyond explicit user feedback (deselecting items) to *implicitly* understand user emotional state and adapt recommendations accordingly.  The potential lies in creating a truly personalized and responsive recommendation experience that anticipates user needs before they are explicitly expressed.
