## Adaptive Notification Prioritization & Predictive Buffering

**Concept:** Extend the existing notification system to incorporate dynamic prioritization based on real-time system load and predictive buffering to mitigate queue overflow. The goal is to ensure critical notifications aren’t dropped during peak operation, and to proactively prepare for potential notification bursts.

**Specifications:**

**1. Prioritization Engine:**

*   **Input:**
    *   Notification Type (from existing system)
    *   System Load (CPU utilization, memory pressure, bus bandwidth – measured by a dedicated hardware monitoring unit, or through OS hooks)
    *   Notification Source (ID of the accelerator/IC module generating the notification)
    *   Configurable Priority Rules (stored in a dedicated region of processor memory)
*   **Process:**
    *   The prioritization engine evaluates the incoming notification against the configured rules. Rules are defined as weighted combinations of notification type, system load, and source.
    *   A priority score is calculated.
    *   Notifications are tagged with a priority level (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).
*   **Output:**
    *   Prioritized Notification Queue (a separate queue, or priority tags appended to existing notifications).

**2. Predictive Buffering System:**

*   **Mechanism:**
    *   Monitor notification generation rates from each source.
    *   Maintain a rolling average of notification rates.
    *   Predict potential bursts based on deviations from the rolling average.
    *   Pre-allocate buffer space in the queues based on predicted burst size. (This pre-allocation is dynamic, adjusting as the rolling average changes).
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   A dedicated hardware unit (or software module with hardware acceleration) manages the rolling average and prediction calculations.
    *   Buffer pre-allocation uses a 'watermark' system. Once a queue reaches a lower watermark, it requests more buffer space (up to a predefined maximum).
    *   If buffer pre-allocation fails (due to memory constraints), the prioritization engine is instructed to aggressively drop low-priority notifications.

**3.  Hardware/Software Interface**

*   **Accelerator Updates:** The accelerator needs a new instruction/register set to:
    *   Read the current system load.
    *   Query the available buffer space in each queue.
    *   Specify a minimum acceptable buffer size.
*   **Processor-Side Driver Updates:** The driver needs to:
    *   Expose system load information to the accelerator.
    *   Manage the dynamic buffer allocation/deallocation.
    *   Implement the priority rule configuration interface.

**Pseudocode (Processor-Side Buffer Management):**

```
// Function to allocate buffer space
function allocateBuffer(queueId, size) {
  if (availableMemory > size) {
    allocate(memoryRegion, size)
    queue[queueId].add(memoryRegion)
    return true
  } else {
    // Trigger priority-based notification dropping
    dropLowPriorityNotifications()
    return false
  }
}

// Function to monitor queues and proactively allocate buffer
function monitorQueues() {
  for each queue in queues {
    if (queue.size() < queue.lowerWatermark) {
      // Calculate buffer needed for next predicted burst
      bufferNeeded = predictBurstSize(queue.source)
      allocateBuffer(queue.id, bufferNeeded)
    }
  }
}
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Energy Efficiency:** Optimize the monitoring and prediction algorithms to minimize power consumption.
*   **Scalability:** Design the system to support a large number of accelerator modules and queues.
*   **Security:** Implement appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access to the priority rules and buffer allocation mechanisms.
