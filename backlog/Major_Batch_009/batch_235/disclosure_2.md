## Variable Geometry Ducted Fan with Bio-Inspired Morphing

**Concept:** Develop a ducted fan system incorporating blades with individually controlled, bio-inspired morphing capabilities, allowing for dynamic adjustment of airflow and thrust vectoring beyond simple blade pitch control. This moves beyond solely stacked/offset blade arrangements to truly adaptable aerodynamic surfaces.

**Specs:**

*   **Fan Diameter:** Scalable, target range 10cm - 50cm.
*   **Blade Count:** 4-8 blades per fan.
*   **Blade Material:** Shape Memory Polymer (SMP) composite with embedded carbon nanotube (CNT) heating elements. This allows for precise, localized heating and controlled deformation. Alternative: Electrorheological fluid filled flexible structures.
*   **Morphing Mechanism:** Each blade segment (approx. 5-10 segments per blade) capable of independent curvature adjustment via CNT heating/SMP activation. Segment length ~1-2cm.
*   **Control System:**
    *   Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32) with integrated IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) for fan orientation and vibration analysis.
    *   Individual PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) control for each blade segmentâ€™s CNT heating element.
    *   Real-time feedback loop utilizing miniature strain gauges integrated *within* each blade segment to precisely monitor deformation.
    *   Algorithm allowing for automated morphing based on desired thrust vector, airflow conditions, and flight stability data.
*   **Duct Design:**
    *   Variable geometry duct incorporating flexible panels controlled by small servo motors. Enables adjustment of duct inlet and outlet area, optimizing airflow capture and exhaust velocity.
    *   Internal duct surface coated with micro-riblets (similar to shark skin) to reduce drag and turbulence.
*   **Power:** Dedicated high-current power supply capable of delivering sufficient energy to both the fan motor and the blade/duct actuators.
*   **Communication:** Wireless communication module (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) for remote control and data logging.
*   **Software:**
    *   Python-based control software with a GUI for manual control and algorithm development.
    *   Machine learning module for adaptive control and optimization of morphing patterns.
*   **Manufacturing:** Blades produced via additive manufacturing (3D printing) to enable complex internal structures and integration of sensors/actuators.

**Operation:**

1.  The control system receives input data from the IMU and/or remote control.
2.  Based on this data, the algorithm calculates the optimal morphing pattern for each blade segment and the duct geometry.
3.  PWM signals are sent to the CNT heating elements, causing localized heating and deformation of the SMP composite.
4.  Servo motors adjust the duct geometry.
5.  Strain gauges provide real-time feedback, allowing the control system to fine-tune the morphing pattern and ensure precise control.

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced maneuverability for drones and UAVs.
*   Improved efficiency and reduced noise for electric VTOL aircraft.
*   Adaptive airflow control for wind turbines.
*   Biomimetic robotics inspired by bird flight.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Initialization
initialize IMU, strain gauges, PWM controllers, servo motors

// Main Loop
while (true) {
    // Read sensor data
    imu_data = read IMU()
    strain_data = read strain gauges()

    // Calculate desired thrust vector
    desired_thrust = calculate_thrust(imu_data)

    // Calculate morphing pattern
    morphing_pattern = calculate_morphing_pattern(desired_thrust, strain_data)

    // Send PWM signals to heating elements
    for (each segment in blade) {
        set_pwm(segment, morphing_pattern[segment])
    }

    // Adjust duct geometry
    set_duct_geometry(morphing_pattern)

    // Delay
    wait(0.01)
}
