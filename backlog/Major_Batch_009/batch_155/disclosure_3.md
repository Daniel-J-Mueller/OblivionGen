## Dynamic Color Palette Generation from Environmental Sensors

**System Specifications:**

*   **Sensor Suite:** Integration with diverse environmental sensors â€“ ambient light, temperature, humidity, air quality (VOCs, particulate matter), sound level, and even subtle vibrations.
*   **Data Acquisition & Processing Module:** Real-time data ingestion from sensor suite. Noise filtering, outlier removal, and data normalization.  Conversion of sensor readings into a weighted color vector.
*   **Color Vector Mapping:**  A configurable mapping algorithm translates the weighted sensor vector into RGB, CMYK, or other color space values.  Allows user-defined sensitivity curves for each sensor input. (e.g., higher temperature = more red, lower humidity = more blue).
*   **Palette Generation Engine:**  Generates a color palette (5-10 colors) based on the mapped color values.  Utilizes color harmony algorithms (complementary, analogous, triadic, etc.) to ensure visual appeal and balance. Option for user-defined harmony rules.
*   **Adaptive Palette Library:** Stores generated palettes linked to the corresponding sensor data. Allows users to save and recall palettes based on specific environmental conditions or locations.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** The system will ingest the color palettes and associate them with images as described in the provided patent.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
WHILE (TRUE) {
  // Read sensor data
  light = readLightSensor();
  temp = readTempSensor();
  humidity = readHumiditySensor();
  airQuality = readAirQualitySensor();
  sound = readSoundSensor();

  // Calculate weighted color vector
  red = (temp * 0.4) + (light * 0.3) + (airQuality * 0.2) + (sound * 0.1);
  green = (humidity * 0.5) + (light * 0.3) + (temp * 0.2);
  blue = (airQuality * 0.6) + (humidity * 0.4);

  // Normalize RGB values (0-255)
  red = constrain(red, 0, 255);
  green = constrain(green, 0, 255);
  blue = constrain(blue, 0, 255);

  // Generate palette (example: 5 colors)
  color1 = RGB(red, green, blue);
  color2 = RGB(red * 0.8, green * 0.8, blue * 0.8);
  color3 = RGB(red * 1.2, green * 0.9, blue * 0.7);
  color4 = RGB(red * 0.6, green * 1.1, blue * 0.5);
  color5 = RGB(red * 0.7, green * 0.7, blue * 1.2);

  palette = [color1, color2, color3, color4, color5];

  // Store Palette
  storePalette(palette, light, temp, humidity, airQuality, sound);

  // Make Palette Available for Image Association (as in patent)
  // Send palette to existing image processing system

  delay(5000); // Update palette every 5 seconds
}

// Function to store palette and associated sensor data
function storePalette(palette, light, temp, humidity, airQuality, sound) {
  // Store palette data in a database or file
  // Include timestamp and location data (if available)
}
```

**Innovation Focus:**

Moving beyond static or user-defined color palettes, this system dynamically generates palettes *from the environment*. This expands the applicability of the existing system, allowing for contextual image selection and presentation based on real-world conditions. Imagine a smart home system adjusting the color scheme of displayed images to match the ambient lighting and air quality. Or an art installation that changes its visual appearance based on the surrounding environment.
