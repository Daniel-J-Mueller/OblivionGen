## Dynamic Shard Migration Based on Query Load

**Concept:** Instead of static bucket/shard assignments, dynamically migrate data shards *during* query processing based on real-time query load analysis. This allows for hot-spot mitigation and optimized parallelization beyond what's achievable with fixed partitioning.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Query Load Analyzer (QLA) - runs alongside database cluster.
*   **Data Input:** Query stream (SQL, NoSQL, etc.), Database Metadata (shard location), System Resource Metrics (CPU, I/O, Network).
*   **QLA Functionality:**
    *   **Query Decomposition:** Breaks down complex queries into individual data access patterns.
    *   **Access Pattern Identification:** Identifies frequently accessed shards for each query or query type.
    *   **Load Prediction:** Predicts future shard load based on historical data and current query trends.
    *   **Migration Recommendation:** Recommends temporary data shard migrations to balance load and minimize query latency.
*   **Component:** Dynamic Shard Manager (DSM) – orchestrates shard migrations.
*   **DSM Functionality:**
    *   **Migration Execution:** Initiates data transfers between nodes based on QLA recommendations.
    *   **Metadata Updates:** Updates database metadata to reflect temporary shard locations.  Metadata consistency is critical.
    *   **Query Redirection:**  Redirects queries to the new shard location *in-flight* without interrupting existing queries.
    *   **Rollback Mechanism:** In case of migration failure, roll back to the original shard location seamlessly.
*   **Data Structures:**
    *   **Shard Load Map:**  A real-time map of shard load, updated by the QLA.  (Shard ID -> Load Value).
    *   **Query Access Graph:** A directed graph representing query access patterns. (Query ID -> List of Shard IDs).
    *   **Migration Plan:**  A sequence of data transfer operations. (Source Shard, Destination Shard, Data Range).

**Pseudocode (DSM – Query Intercept & Redirection):**

```
function intercept_query(query)
  access_graph = generate_access_graph(query)
  for shard_id in access_graph
    current_location = get_shard_location(shard_id)
    predicted_location = QLA.predict_best_location(shard_id)

    if current_location != predicted_location
      redirect_query_to(query, predicted_location) // Modify query execution plan
      log_redirection(query, current_location, predicted_location)
    end if
  end for
  execute_query(query)
end function

function redirect_query_to(query, new_location)
  // Modify query execution plan to route data access to new_location
  //  (e.g., rewrite SQL query, update NoSQL query routing rules)
end function
```

**Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   **Distributed QLA:** Run multiple QLA instances in parallel, each responsible for a subset of the database.
*   **Replication:** Replicate data across multiple nodes for redundancy.
*   **Checksums:** Use checksums to verify data integrity during migration.
*   **Conflict Resolution:** Implement a conflict resolution mechanism to handle concurrent migrations.
