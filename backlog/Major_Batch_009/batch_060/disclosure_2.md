## Dynamic Seller “Momentum” Scoring & Predictive Trust

**Concept:** Expand the existing seller scoring system to incorporate a “momentum” factor, predicting future trustworthiness based on *rate of change* in performance metrics, rather than solely on historical averages. This aims to identify rising-star sellers and flag potentially deteriorating ones *before* they significantly impact buyer experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Traditional Seller Score inputs (as per patent – buyer ratings, transaction success, etc.).
    *   **Velocity Metrics:** Calculate the rate of change for key performance indicators (KPIs) over defined time windows (e.g., 7-day, 30-day, 90-day). KPIs include:
        *   Average Rating (daily/weekly change)
        *   Transaction Completion Rate (daily/weekly change)
        *   Response Time to Inquiries (daily/weekly change)
        *   Rate of Positive/Negative Feedback (daily/weekly change)
        *   Return/Refund Request Rate (daily/weekly change)
*   **Momentum Calculation:**
    *   **Weighted Averaging:** Assign weights to each velocity metric based on its predictive power (determined through machine learning - see below).  Higher weights for metrics demonstrably correlated with future negative/positive outcomes.
    *   **Decay Factor:**  Apply a decay factor to older data. Recent performance should have a greater impact on the momentum score than distant history.
    *   **Normalization:** Normalize the weighted, decayed velocity metrics to a common scale.
    *   **Momentum Score:** Combine the normalized velocity metrics to generate the “Momentum Score”.
*   **Dynamic Thresholds:**
    *   **Adaptive Score Thresholds:**  Instead of fixed score thresholds for “featured”/“non-featured” status, use dynamically adjusted thresholds based on the overall seller population’s momentum distribution.  This prevents manipulation and ensures meaningful differentiation.
    *   **Risk Bands:** Categorize sellers into “Risk Bands” based on their momentum score: “Rising Star”, “Stable”, “Warning”, “High Risk”.
*   **Predictive Modeling (Machine Learning Component):**
    *   **Training Data:** Utilize historical transaction data, seller performance metrics, and buyer behavior to train a machine learning model.
    *   **Model Output:** The model should predict the probability of a seller engaging in negative behavior (e.g., shipping delays, product defects, fraudulent activity) within a specified timeframe.
    *   **Integration:** Integrate the model's output into the overall seller scoring system.  High-risk predictions should trigger increased monitoring or temporary restrictions.
*   **User Interface (Buyer View):**
    *   **Momentum Indicator:** Display a visual “Momentum Indicator” alongside each seller's name/rating.  Colors/icons can represent the Risk Band (e.g., Green = Rising Star, Yellow = Warning, Red = High Risk).
    *   **Detailed Momentum Report:** Allow buyers to access a “Detailed Momentum Report” for any seller, showing the trend of key performance indicators over time.
*   **System Architecture:**
    *   **Real-time Data Pipeline:**  Implement a real-time data pipeline to ingest and process seller performance data from various sources (transaction systems, customer support logs, etc.).
    *   **Microservices Architecture:**  Decompose the system into microservices responsible for specific tasks (data ingestion, momentum calculation, machine learning model training/inference).
    *   **API Integration:** Expose APIs for accessing seller scores and momentum data.

**Pseudocode (Momentum Calculation):**

```
function calculateSellerMomentum(sellerId, transactionData, customerSupportData):
  // Calculate velocity metrics for each KPI
  ratingVelocity = calculateVelocity(transactionData.ratings, 7)
  completionRateVelocity = calculateVelocity(transactionData.completions, 7)
  responseTimeVelocity = calculateVelocity(customerSupportData.responseTimes, 7)
  returnRateVelocity = calculateVelocity(transactionData.returns, 7)

  // Apply weights (determined by ML model)
  ratingWeight = 0.3
  completionWeight = 0.4
  responseTimeWeight = 0.15
  returnWeight = 0.15

  // Calculate weighted momentum score
  momentumScore = (ratingWeight * ratingVelocity) + (completionWeight * completionRateVelocity) + (responseTimeWeight * responseTimeVelocity) + (returnWeight * returnRateVelocity)

  //Apply decay factor
  decayFactor = 0.9
  momentumScore = momentumScore * decayFactor

  return momentumScore
```
