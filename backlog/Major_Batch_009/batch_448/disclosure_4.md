## Dynamic Key Sharding with Attestation

**Concept:** Extend the controlled key access concept to *shard* cryptographic keys across multiple enforcer devices, requiring a quorum of attestations before a full key is reconstructed and utilized. This dramatically increases security by eliminating single points of failure and adding a temporal element to key access.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Sharding Module (KSM):**

*   **Function:** Responsible for splitting a master cryptographic key into 'n' shares.  Shares are *not* individually decryptable or useful.
*   **Input:** Master Key, ‘n’ (number of shares), ‘t’ (threshold – minimum number of shares needed for reconstruction).
*   **Output:** ‘n’ Key Shares. Each share is associated with a specific enforcer device.
*   **Algorithm:** Shamir's Secret Sharing or similar polynomial interpolation-based scheme. 

**2. Enforcer Device Enhancement (EDE):**

*   **Hardware:** Each enforcer device receives a unique Key Share. Secure storage for the share is paramount (e.g., Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) based storage).
*   **Attestation Module:**  Incorporates a hardware-based attestation module (e.g., TPM/SGX) to cryptographically prove its identity and the integrity of its stored Key Share.
*   **Share Request Handler:**  Listens for Share Request messages on a secure channel.
*   **Share Release Policy:** Only releases its Key Share *after* successfully verifying:
    *   Authenticity of the requesting entity (e.g., a designated key reconstruction manager).
    *   A valid, time-stamped request.
    *   Proof of attestations from a minimum of ‘t-1’ other enforcer devices (quorum).

**3. Key Reconstruction Manager (KRM):**

*   **Function:** Initiates key reconstruction, gathers attestations, and manages share collection.
*   **Process:**
    1.  Broadcasts a Key Reconstruction Request to all enforcer devices.
    2.  Receives Attestation Responses from enforcer devices.
    3.  Verifies attestations for validity and quorum fulfillment.
    4.  Requests Key Shares from enforcer devices that meet the quorum.
    5.  Collects Key Shares.
    6.  Reconstructs the Master Key using the collected shares.

**4. Secure Communication Protocol (SCP):**

*   **Purpose:** Provides a secure, authenticated, and encrypted channel for communication between KRM and EDEs.
*   **Features:**
    *   Mutual authentication using digital signatures.
    *   End-to-end encryption using strong symmetric/asymmetric cryptography.
    *   Protection against replay attacks.

**Pseudocode (KRM - Key Reconstruction):**

```
function reconstructKey(masterKeyID):
  requestTimestamp = getCurrentTimestamp()
  attestationResponses = []
  
  // Send Reconstruction Request to all enforcers
  for each enforcer in enforcerList:
    send(enforcer, ReconstructionRequest(masterKeyID, requestTimestamp))
    
  // Receive and verify attestations (timeout after X seconds)
  while len(attestationResponses) < threshold:
    response = receive(attestationResponses, timeout=X)
    if isValidAttestation(response, requestTimestamp):
      attestationResponses.append(response)
    
  // If quorum not met, fail
  if len(attestationResponses) < threshold:
    return ERROR_QUORUM_FAILED
    
  // Request Key Shares from enforcers with valid attestations
  keyShares = []
  for attestation in attestationResponses:
    enforcerID = attestation.enforcerID
    share = receive(enforcerID, KeyShareRequest())
    keyShares.append(share)

  // Reconstruct Master Key
  masterKey = reconstructKeyFromShares(keyShares)
  return masterKey
```

**Innovation:** Traditional key management relies on securing a single, complete key. This system distributes the key across multiple devices and requires a dynamic quorum of attestations *before* the key can be reconstructed. This approach drastically increases resilience against compromise and provides a temporal aspect to key access (attestations can expire).
