## Adaptive Key Lifespan Based on Behavioral Biometrics

**System Specifications:**

*   **Components:**
    *   Key Distribution Host (KDH) – Existing.
    *   Authentication Endpoint (AE) – Existing.
    *   Behavioral Monitoring Module (BMM) – New. Integrated into AE. Captures keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, and app usage patterns.
    *   Risk Assessment Engine (RAE) – New. Integrated into KDH. Analyzes BMM data to calculate a continuous risk score.
    *   Dynamic Key Provisioning Service (DKPS) – New. Integrated into KDH. Adjusts key lifespan based on RAE output.
*   **Data Flow:**
    1.  AE initiates authentication request.
    2.  BMM collects behavioral biometrics during the authentication process.
    3.  AE transmits biometric data to KDH.
    4.  RAE analyzes biometric data, comparing it to a baseline profile for the user. Deviations increase the risk score.
    5.  DKPS receives risk score.
    6.  DKPS dynamically adjusts the validity period of the authentication key. High risk = short lifespan (minutes). Medium risk = standard lifespan (hours). Low risk = extended lifespan (days).
    7.  KDH provisions key with adjusted lifespan to AE.
    8.  AE uses key for authentication.
    9.  BMM continues monitoring behavior during sessions to refine the baseline and risk assessment.

**Pseudocode (DKPS):**

```
function provisionKey(riskScore):
  if riskScore > 0.8:
    keyLifespan = 5 minutes
  else if riskScore > 0.5:
    keyLifespan = 1 hour
  else if riskScore > 0.2:
    keyLifespan = 6 hours
  else:
    keyLifespan = 24 hours

  generate new authentication key
  set key expiration to current time + keyLifespan
  return key
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   **Baseline Creation:** BMM establishes a baseline profile for each user during initial usage. This requires a 'learning period' where the system observes and stores typical behavior patterns.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** RAE employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., anomaly detection, clustering) to identify deviations from the baseline.
*   **Risk Score Calculation:** RAE combines anomaly scores from various biometric data points into a single risk score. Weighted factors may be used to prioritize certain data points.
*   **Key Rotation:** Regardless of the risk score, keys should be rotated periodically to limit the impact of potential compromises.
*   **Secure Communication:** All communication between AE and KDH must be secured using mutually authenticated TLS or equivalent.
*   **Privacy Considerations:** Biometric data must be handled securely and in compliance with relevant privacy regulations. Users should be informed about data collection practices.
