## Adaptive Sensory Contextualization for Proactive Assistance

**Concept:** Extend intent recognition beyond audio and visual input to incorporate a wider range of sensor data from the device and environment, building a dynamic "sensory profile" that predicts user needs *before* explicit requests are made. This moves beyond re-ranking existing hypotheses to proactively formulating them.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Sensor Fusion Module:**
    *   **Input:** Real-time data streams from:
        *   Microphone (audio)
        *   Camera (visual)
        *   Accelerometer/Gyroscope (motion/orientation)
        *   Ambient Light Sensor
        *   Temperature Sensor
        *   Bluetooth/Wi-Fi beacon detection (proximity to known devices/locations)
        *   GPS (location, if available and permitted)
        *   Barometer (altitude/weather conditions)
    *   **Processing:**
        *   Data normalization and synchronization.
        *   Feature extraction (e.g., audio events, object detection, motion patterns, light levels, temperature gradients, proximity signals, location coordinates).
        *   Sensor data weighting – dynamic allocation based on reliability and relevance. (e.g. GPS low, WiFi high, vice versa).
        *   Time-series analysis for pattern identification.

2.  **Contextual Profile Builder:**
    *   **Data Input:** Processed sensor data from the Sensor Fusion Module. User history (permissions allowing). Time of day/day of week. Calendar events (permissions allowing).
    *   **Profile Structure:**
        *   **Baseline Profile:** Captures typical user behavior across different contexts. (e.g., User usually listens to podcasts while commuting).
        *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identifies deviations from the Baseline Profile. (e.g., User is walking slowly indoors – potential fall risk).
        *   **Predictive Modeling:** Employs machine learning models (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks) to predict future user needs based on current context and historical data.
    *   **Profile Storage:** Secure and privacy-preserving storage of Contextual Profiles.

3.  **Proactive Intent Formulation Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Contextual Profile, Sensor Data, Time of Day, Calendar Events
    *   **Process:**
        *   Based on the Contextual Profile and current sensor data, the engine generates a ranked list of *potential* user intents – even *before* the user speaks.
        *   Each potential intent is assigned a confidence score based on the strength of the evidence.
        *   Hypotheses are generated even with incomplete or ambiguous data. For example: “User is cooking” based on motion and sound, even without a verbal request.
        *   The Engine also generates a list of ‘clarification prompts’ in case a high-confidence hypothesis cannot be confidently acted upon. “Would you like me to set a timer for 20 minutes?”
    *   **Output:** Ranked list of potential user intents with associated confidence scores and suggested actions.

4.  **Adaptive Action Trigger:**
    *   **Input:** Ranked list of potential user intents, Confidence Scores.
    *   **Process:**
        *   If the confidence score of the top-ranked intent exceeds a predefined threshold, the corresponding action is automatically triggered (e.g., start playing music, adjust thermostat, initiate a phone call).
        *   If the confidence score is below the threshold, the system initiates a clarification prompt to confirm the user’s intent.
        *   The Action Trigger also includes a ‘Safety Override’ – allowing the user to immediately cancel any automatically triggered action.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
// Sensor Fusion Module
sensorData = getSensorData()
processedData = processSensorData(sensorData)

// Contextual Profile Builder
contextProfile = buildContextProfile(processedData, userHistory)

// Proactive Intent Formulation Engine
potentialIntents = formulatePotentialIntents(contextProfile, processedData)
rankedIntents = rankIntents(potentialIntents)

// Adaptive Action Trigger
if (rankedIntents[0].confidence > threshold) {
  triggerAction(rankedIntents[0].intent)
} else {
  displayClarificationPrompt(rankedIntents[0].intent)
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond simply re-ranking intent *hypotheses* based on contextual information; it *proactively* formulates intents *before* explicit requests are made, leveraging a broad range of sensor data to anticipate user needs and provide truly seamless assistance. The system doesn’t wait for you to ask, it anticipates and responds.
