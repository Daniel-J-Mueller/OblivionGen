## Dynamic Content Assembly with Behavioral Biometrics

**Concept:** Extend the selective content decryption idea by tying decryption key access *not just* to user identity, but to real-time behavioral biometrics. This adds a layer of dynamic authorization, making content access dependent on *how* a user interacts with the system, not just *who* they are.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biometric Data Collection Module:**
    *   Continuous monitoring of user interactions: keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scrolling speed, touch pressure (if applicable), device orientation changes, and inter-action timings.
    *   Data is collected *after* initial authentication (password, MFA). This isn’t a replacement for initial authentication, but a continuous authorization layer.
    *   Data is processed locally (client-side) to generate a “behavioral profile” for the user.  This profile is a constantly updating vector of statistical features.
    *   Data is *not* raw. Only the statistical features are transmitted.  Minimize data transmission.

2.  **Authorization Server Enhancement:**
    *   The existing authorization server must be extended to receive and validate behavioral profiles.
    *   Each content item will now have an associated “behavioral access rule.” This rule defines the acceptable range of behavioral profile features for access.  The rule is created during content packaging.
    *   When a client requests a content segment, the server requests the client’s current behavioral profile (statistical features).
    *   The server compares the client’s profile to the behavioral access rule.
    *   If the profile falls within the acceptable range, the decryption key (or a segment key) is released. Otherwise, the unencrypted fallback content is served.

3.  **Content Packaging Tool:**
    *   An extension to the existing content packaging tool.
    *   Allows content creators/administrators to define behavioral access rules during content packaging.
    *   Rules are defined using a simple scripting language or GUI. Example: “Acceptable keystroke dynamics variability: +/- 15% from baseline. Acceptable mouse movement smoothness: > 0.8.”
    *   Rules are stored as metadata alongside the encrypted content.

4.  **Client-Side Integration:**
    *   The client-side decryption module must be updated to collect and transmit behavioral profile data to the server.
    *   It should also handle the case where decryption fails due to behavioral mismatch – seamlessly switching to the unencrypted fallback content.
    *   The client should implement a ‘learning phase’ after initial login, to establish a baseline behavioral profile for the user. This improves accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - simplified):**

```
function requestContentSegment(segmentID) {
  behavioralProfile = collectBehavioralData()
  serverResponse = sendRequestToServer(segmentID, behavioralProfile)

  if (serverResponse.decryptionKeyAvailable) {
    decryptionKey = serverResponse.decryptionKey
    encryptedSegment = downloadEncryptedSegment(segmentID)
    decryptedSegment = decryptSegment(encryptedSegment, decryptionKey)
    displaySegment(decryptedSegment)
  } else {
    unencryptedSegment = downloadUnencryptedSegment(segmentID)
    displaySegment(unencryptedSegment)
  }
}
```

**Innovation:** This creates a continuously adaptive authorization system.  Content isn’t just protected by *who* you are, but by *how* you are interacting with the system *right now*. It adds an extra layer of security against account compromise (if an attacker gains access but doesn’t mimic the user’s behavior) and enables granular control over content access based on context and risk.  For example, sensitive financial data might only be decryptable if the user exhibits consistent, focused interaction patterns, while casual browsing is served unencrypted.
