## Dynamic Data Tiering with Predictive Partitioning

**Concept:** Extend the existing partitioned table system with a dynamic tiering mechanism, coupled with predictive partitioning based on access patterns and data characteristics. This aims to optimize storage costs and query performance by proactively migrating partitions to different storage tiers (e.g., SSD, NVMe, HDD, cloud archive) *before* resource constraints become an issue.

**Specifications:**

*   **Tier Definitions:** Define a hierarchy of storage tiers, each characterized by cost, performance (IOPS, latency), and capacity. This should be configurable via an administrative interface. Example tiers:
    *   `Tier 0`: NVMe SSD – Highest performance, highest cost, limited capacity.
    *   `Tier 1`: SSD – High performance, high cost, moderate capacity.
    *   `Tier 2`: HDD – Moderate performance, low cost, high capacity.
    *   `Tier 3`: Cloud Archive – Lowest performance, lowest cost, unlimited capacity.
*   **Data Classification Module:** Analyze incoming data based on:
    *   **Access Frequency:** Track read/write operations per partition.
    *   **Data Age:**  Monitor the creation/modification timestamps of data within partitions.
    *   **Data Type/Schema:**  Identify data types and schema attributes that correlate with access patterns. (e.g. time-series data, log data)
    *   **User/Application:** Identify which users or applications are accessing which partitions.
*   **Predictive Modeling:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future access patterns for each partition. This model will consider historical access data, data age, and data characteristics.
*   **Partition Migration Engine:**
    *   Based on predictions from the predictive modeling module, the engine will proactively migrate partitions between storage tiers.
    *   Migration will occur in the background with minimal disruption to ongoing queries.
    *   The migration engine supports the following operations:
        *   `Promote`: Move a partition from a lower tier to a higher tier.
        *   `Demote`: Move a partition from a higher tier to a lower tier.
        *   `Rebalance`: Distribute partitions across tiers to optimize resource utilization.
*   **Query Optimizer Integration:**
    *   The query optimizer must be aware of partition locations across tiers.
    *   It should formulate query plans that minimize data transfer costs between tiers.
    *   Cost-based optimization will consider the performance characteristics of each tier.

**Pseudocode (Partition Migration Engine):**

```
function migratePartitions():
  for each partition in partitions:
    predictedAccess = predictFutureAccess(partition)
    currentTier = getPartitionTier(partition)
    targetTier = determineOptimalTier(predictedAccess, currentTier)

    if targetTier != currentTier:
      logMigration(partition, currentTier, targetTier)
      if targetTier > currentTier:
        promotePartition(partition)
      else:
        demotePartition(partition)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `PartitionMetadata`: Stores information about each partition, including:
    *   `partitionId`: Unique identifier.
    *   `tier`: Current storage tier.
    *   `accessHistory`: Time-series data of read/write operations.
    *   `dataAge`: Age of the oldest data in the partition.
    *   `dataCharacteristics`: Attributes of the data within the partition.

**Scalability & Resilience:**

*   The system should be horizontally scalable to handle large datasets and high query loads.
*   Partition replication should be implemented to ensure data availability and resilience.

This dynamic tiering system proactively optimizes storage costs and query performance by adapting to changing data access patterns, rather than reacting to resource constraints. It builds upon the existing partitioned table system by adding a layer of intelligence and automation.
