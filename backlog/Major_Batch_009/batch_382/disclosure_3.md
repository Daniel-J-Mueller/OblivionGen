## Acoustic Scene Reconstruction via Filter Coefficient Mapping

**Concept:** Leverage the adaptive FIR filter coefficients not just to *detect* proximity issues, but to *reconstruct* a simplified acoustic map of the environment. This map could then be used for beamforming, noise cancellation, or even augmented reality applications.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Acquisition:** Continuously capture the sequence of dynamically updated FIR filter coefficients from the AEC process (as per the provided patent). Simultaneously capture raw audio input from both the first and second devices.
*   **Coefficient Clustering:** Implement a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) to group filter coefficients based on similarity.  Each cluster represents a distinct acoustic path – direct sound, first-order reflections from walls/objects, etc.
*   **Path Distance Estimation:**  For each cluster, estimate the corresponding acoustic path distance. This can be done by:
    *   Analyzing the time delay associated with that cluster's coefficients (calculated from the filter’s impulse response).
    *   Using known speed of sound to convert time delay to distance.
    *   Employing a pre-calibrated room map (if available) to constrain distance estimations.
*   **Acoustic Map Creation:** Build a point cloud representation of the acoustic environment. Each point in the cloud corresponds to a detected acoustic path, with coordinates representing the estimated location of the reflecting surface or sound source.
*   **Map Refinement:**  Use sensor fusion (if available - e.g., data from cameras, IMUs) to refine the acoustic map. This can help to correct for errors in distance estimation and to identify objects in the environment.
*   **Output:** Provide a dynamic, real-time acoustic map as a data stream.  The map should include:
    *   3D coordinates of detected acoustic paths.
    *   Confidence levels for each path.
    *   Information about the type of path (direct, reflection, etc.).

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Real-time processing loop
while (audio_data_available()) {

  // Get filter coefficients
  filter_coefficients = get_FIR_coefficients();

  // Cluster coefficients (k-means)
  clusters = cluster_coefficients(filter_coefficients, num_clusters);

  // For each cluster:
  for (cluster in clusters) {
    // Estimate time delay from filter impulse response
    time_delay = estimate_time_delay(cluster.impulse_response);

    // Calculate distance
    distance = time_delay * speed_of_sound;

    // (Optional) Refine distance using sensor fusion
    refined_distance = refine_distance(distance, sensor_data);

    // Create 3D point representing acoustic path
    point = create_3D_point(refined_distance, angle, elevation);

    // Add point to acoustic map
    acoustic_map.add_point(point);
  }
  output_acoustic_map();
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Improved Beamforming:** Steer audio beams more accurately based on the reconstructed acoustic map.
*   **Enhanced Noise Cancellation:**  Identify and suppress noise sources more effectively.
*   **AR/VR integration:** Overlay virtual objects onto the real world based on the acoustic map.
*   **Acoustic Scene Understanding:**  Automatically identify the type of environment (e.g., office, living room, concert hall).
*   **Assistive Technology:** Help visually impaired users navigate by providing acoustic feedback about their surroundings.
