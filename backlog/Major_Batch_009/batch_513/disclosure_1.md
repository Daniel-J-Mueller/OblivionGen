## Dynamic Multi-Modal Similarity Scoring & Automated Product Ontology Generation

**Concept:** Extend the item similarity scoring beyond attributes & values to incorporate visual data (images) *and* dynamically generate a product ontology from the classified data, improving classification accuracy and enabling more granular tariff/duty calculations.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing Module:**

*   **Input:** New item data (attributes, values, image(s)), existing classified item data (attributes, values, image(s), classification code).
*   **Image Processing:** Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a large dataset of product images for feature extraction.  Output a high-dimensional feature vector representing the visual characteristics of the item.
*   **Attribute Normalization:** Standardize attribute names and data types across the dataset to ensure consistency.  Handle missing values with imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, mode).
*   **Text Embeddings:** Utilize pre-trained word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT) to convert textual attribute values into vector representations.

**2. Multi-Modal Similarity Scoring Engine:**

*   **Attribute Similarity Score:** (As defined in patent) - Number of common attributes.
*   **Attribute Value Similarity Score:** (As defined in patent) - Number of matching attribute values.
*   **Visual Similarity Score:** Calculate the cosine similarity between the CNN feature vectors of the new item and each classified item.
*   **Weighted Combination:**  Calculate a combined similarity score using the following formula:
    *   `Combined Similarity = w1 * Attribute Similarity + w2 * Attribute Value Similarity + w3 * Visual Similarity`
    *   `w1`, `w2`, `w3` are weights determined through experimentation or machine learning (e.g., using a genetic algorithm to optimize weights for a given dataset). Weights are also product-category aware - categories may dynamically bias the weights.
*   **Dynamic Weight Adjustment:** Implement a mechanism to adjust weights based on product category. For example, visual similarity might be more important for fashion items than for industrial components.  The dynamic weights may be derived from category-specific training.

**3. Ontology Generation Module:**

*   **Hierarchy Construction:** After each classification, update a product ontology based on the relationships between items.  Utilize a graph database (e.g., Neo4j) to represent the ontology.  Nodes represent items, and edges represent relationships (e.g., "is a type of", "is similar to").
*   **Relationship Inference:**  Infer relationships based on similarity scores.  If two items have a high similarity score, create or strengthen the "is similar to" edge between them.
*   **Automated Category Refinement:** Monitor the ontology for emerging categories or subcategories.  If a cluster of items consistently receives the same classification code, automatically create a new category or subcategory.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Use the ontology to improve classification accuracy.  If a new item is similar to items in a specific category, prioritize that category during classification.

**4. Classification & Duty Estimation Module:**

*   **Closest Match Identification:** Identify the closest match based on the combined similarity score.
*   **Classification Code Assignment:** Assign the classification code associated with the closest match to the new item.
*   **Duty Estimation:** Estimate import duties and taxes based on the assigned classification code and destination country.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function classify_item(new_item):
  attributes_new = new_item.attributes
  image_new = new_item.image
  
  similarity_scores = []
  
  for classified_item in database:
    attributes_classified = classified_item.attributes
    image_classified = classified_item.image
    
    attribute_similarity = calculate_attribute_similarity(attributes_new, attributes_classified)
    attribute_value_similarity = calculate_attribute_value_similarity(attributes_new, attributes_classified)
    visual_similarity = calculate_visual_similarity(image_new, image_classified)
    
    # category aware weight application
    weights = get_category_weights(classified_item.category)
    combined_similarity = weights[0] * attribute_similarity + weights[1] * attribute_value_similarity + weights[2] * visual_similarity
    
    similarity_scores.append((classified_item, combined_similarity))
    
  closest_match, highest_similarity = max(similarity_scores, key=lambda item: item[1])
  classification_code = closest_match.classification_code
  
  # Update ontology
  update_ontology(new_item, closest_match)
  
  import_duty = estimate_duty(classification_code, destination_country)
  
  return classification_code, import_duty
```

**Further Refinements:**

*   Implement active learning to solicit feedback from human experts on classification results, further refining the model.
*   Explore the use of generative models (e.g., GANs) to augment the training data with synthetic product images.
*   Integrate with real-time data sources (e.g., product catalogs, shipping databases) to improve data quality and accuracy.
