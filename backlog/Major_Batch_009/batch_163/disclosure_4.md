## Dynamic Knowledge Graph Visualization & Prediction

**Concept:** Expand the system's knowledge representation beyond simple fact storage and inference to incorporate a dynamic, visually interactive knowledge graph. This graph isnâ€™t just *displayed* but actively participates in the prediction/inference process, allowing for human-in-the-loop refinement and discovery of previously unseen connections.

**Specifications:**

*   **Knowledge Graph Construction:**  The existing structured knowledge base is transformed into a node-link graph. Nodes represent entities (objects, concepts) and links represent relationships. This conversion happens automatically and continuously.

*   **Visual Interface:**  A 3D interactive visualization engine displays the knowledge graph. Users can:
    *   Pan, zoom, and rotate the graph.
    *   Filter nodes and links based on type, relevance, or confidence scores.
    *   Highlight paths between nodes.
    *   Manually add/edit nodes and links (with appropriate version control and audit trails).
    *   Dynamically adjust graph layout algorithms (force-directed, hierarchical, etc.).

*   **Predictive Pathing:**  When a query is received, the system doesn't *just* infer answers. It visualizes *potential* inference paths on the graph, ranked by confidence.  These paths are displayed as highlighted routes through the graph.

*   **Human-in-the-Loop Refinement:**  Users can:
    *   Inspect the visualized inference paths.
    *   Modify the paths (add/remove links, adjust weights).
    *   Provide feedback (correct/incorrect).
    *   This feedback is used to retrain the inference engines *and* refine the graph structure.

*   **Anomaly Detection:** The system tracks statistical properties of the graph (node degree, link density, path lengths). Significant deviations from established norms flag potential anomalies or knowledge gaps.

*   **Causal Inference Engine:** Integrate a dedicated causal inference module. This module attempts to identify causal relationships within the graph (beyond simple correlations). This requires sophisticated algorithms (e.g., Bayesian networks, do-calculus). Visualized causal models are overlaid onto the knowledge graph.

*   **API Integration:**  A comprehensive API allows developers to integrate the dynamic knowledge graph into other applications (e.g., decision support systems, recommendation engines).

**Pseudocode (Query Processing with Visualization):**

```
function processQuery(query):
  // 1. Initial Inference
  inferredResults = infer(query, knowledgeBase)

  // 2. Path Generation
  potentialPaths = generatePaths(query, inferredResults, knowledgeBase)

  // 3. Visualization
  displayGraph(knowledgeBase)
  highlightPaths(potentialPaths)

  // 4. User Interaction (Loop)
  while (userHasNotConfirmed):
    userModifiesPaths()
    recalculateInference(userModifiedPaths)
    updateVisualization()
    if (userConfirms):
      break

  // 5. Final Result
  return recalculatedInference
```

**Novelty:** Existing knowledge graphs are typically static or have limited user interaction. This system dynamically visualizes the *inference process itself*, allowing users to actively participate in knowledge discovery and refinement. The integration of causal inference and anomaly detection further enhances the system's capabilities.
