## Adaptive Resonance Frequency Tagging for Dynamic Re-Routing

**Concept:** Expand upon the mote/sensor network by incorporating resonant frequency tagging into each receptacle. Instead of *only* indicating correct/incorrect placement, the system dynamically adjusts routing based on receptacle ‘fullness’ or content type, communicated via shifting resonant frequencies.

**Specs:**

*   **Receptacle Tags:** Each receptacle (tote, bin, shelf segment) is fitted with a miniature, tunable resonant frequency tag. Initial frequency is pre-programmed based on receptacle type/intended content.
*   **Mote Integration:** Existing motes are enhanced with resonant frequency readers *and* transmitters. They continuously monitor the frequency of nearby receptacle tags.
*   **Frequency Modulation:** Receptacle ‘fullness’ (determined by weight sensors within the receptacle) or content type (identified by item scanning) modulates the tag's resonant frequency.  A full tote shifts frequency downwards; a specific product type triggers an upward shift.
*   **Dynamic Re-Routing Algorithm:**
    *   The control system maintains a real-time map of receptacle resonant frequencies.
    *   When an agent scans an item, the system identifies the optimal destination receptacle *not just* by pre-assignment, but by considering:
        *   Current frequency of potential receptacles.
        *   Pre-programmed frequency ranges for different item types.
        *   System-wide capacity balancing (prioritizing receptacles with higher frequency ranges – indicating more space).
    *   The system transmits a signal to the mote on the chosen receptacle to activate its indicator.
*   **Ad-Hoc Network Enhancement:** The resonant frequency data is broadcast through the ad-hoc network, allowing motes to collaboratively build a dynamic map of receptacle availability and content.
*   **Control System Pseudocode:**

```
FUNCTION determine_destination(item_id):
    item_type = get_item_type(item_id)
    available_receptacles = get_available_receptacles(item_type) //Initial list
    best_receptacle = NULL
    lowest_frequency_deviation = INFINITY

    FOR EACH receptacle IN available_receptacles:
        current_frequency = get_receptacle_frequency(receptacle)
        ideal_frequency = get_ideal_frequency_for_item(item_type)
        frequency_deviation = ABS(current_frequency - ideal_frequency)

        IF frequency_deviation < lowest_frequency_deviation:
            lowest_frequency_deviation = frequency_deviation
            best_receptacle = receptacle

    RETURN best_receptacle
```

*   **Hardware Requirements:**
    *   Tunable resonant frequency tags (miniaturized, low power).
    *   Enhanced motes with frequency readers/transmitters.
    *   Receptacle weight sensors (integrated).
*   **Potential Benefits:**
    *   Improved space utilization.
    *   Reduced congestion and bottlenecks.
    *   Automated load balancing.
    *   Increased picking efficiency.
    *   Greater system adaptability to changing demands.
