## Adaptive Credential Lifespan Based on Event Complexity

**Specification:** Implement a system that dynamically adjusts the lifespan of event-specific credentials based on the complexity of the triggering event and the sensitivity of the accessed resources.

**Rationale:** The existing patent focuses on a fixed-time lifespan for credentials. This is inefficient and potentially insecure. Simple events accessing non-critical data require minimal credential lifespan, while complex events accessing sensitive resources necessitate longer, but still bounded, validity.

**Components:**

1.  **Event Complexity Analyzer:** A module analyzing incoming events.  This analyzes event metadata, payload size, number of resource requests, and resource sensitivity tags (e.g., "critical", "confidential", "public"). It assigns a complexity score (1-100) to each event.

2.  **Resource Sensitivity Database:** A database mapping resources to sensitivity levels and recommended maximum credential lifespans.  This is configurable by administrators.

3.  **Credential Lifespan Calculator:** A module that calculates the appropriate credential lifespan based on the event complexity score and the resource sensitivity.

    *   `lifespan = base_lifespan + (complexity_score * sensitivity_multiplier)`
    *   `base_lifespan`: Configurable minimum lifespan (e.g., 60 seconds).
    *   `sensitivity_multiplier`: A value derived from the Resource Sensitivity Database. Higher sensitivity = higher multiplier.
    *   `maximum_lifespan`: An absolute maximum lifespan to prevent excessively long credentials.

4.  **Credential Cache with Time-to-Live (TTL):** The existing credential cache is augmented to support TTL values derived from the Credential Lifespan Calculator.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function process_event(event_data):
  complexity_score = EventComplexityAnalyzer.analyze(event_data)
  resource_sensitivity = ResourceSensitivityDatabase.get_sensitivity(event_data.resource_id)
  lifespan = CredentialLifespanCalculator.calculate(complexity_score, resource_sensitivity)

  event_specific_policy = generate_event_specific_policy(event_data)
  base_credential = get_base_credential()

  event_specific_credential = TokenService.generate_credential(base_credential, event_specific_policy)
  credential_cache.store(event_specific_credential, lifespan)

  resource_instance.process(event_data, event_specific_credential)
```

**Implementation Details:**

*   The Event Complexity Analyzer could utilize machine learning models trained on historical event data to improve accuracy.
*   The Resource Sensitivity Database should be regularly updated to reflect changing security requirements.
*   The credential cache must efficiently handle TTL expiration and garbage collection.
*   Consider introducing a "grace period" before credential expiration to prevent service disruptions.
