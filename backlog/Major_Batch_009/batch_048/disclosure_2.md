## Adaptive Haptic Feedback System for Immersive Media

**Concept:** Extend orientation-based media control to incorporate localized haptic feedback, creating a more immersive and intuitive experience. This goes beyond simple playback adjustments, allowing users to 'feel' the orientation changes within the media itself.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Computing device with existing sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope, image sensor) as per patent 9213419.
    *   Haptic array integrated into wearable device (glove, wristband, vest). Array comprises multiple micro-actuators capable of generating localized pressure, vibration, or thermal changes.
    *   Wireless communication module (Bluetooth Low Energy preferred) for data transfer between computing device and haptic array.
*   **Software:**
    *   Orientation Tracking Module: Utilizes the device sensors (and potentially computer vision) to determine the user’s head orientation and track changes in real-time. (As per patent 9213419, this can be based on head position).
    *   Media Analysis Module: Analyzes the media content (video, audio, 3D models) to identify relevant "haptic events". These could be:
        *   **Visual events:** Rapid camera movements, object impacts, explosions, changes in scene depth.
        *   **Audio events:** Sound directionality, bass frequencies, sudden loud noises, specific sound effects.
        *   **3D Model Events:**  Collision events, texture changes, proximity alerts.
    *   Haptic Mapping Module:  Maps identified haptic events to specific activation patterns on the haptic array. This includes:
        *   **Directional Mapping:**  Maps the direction of movement/sound in the media to the location on the haptic array. (E.g., Sound coming from the left translates to pressure on the left side of the wristband).
        *   **Intensity Mapping:**  Maps the intensity of the event to the strength of the haptic feedback. (E.g., Louder sounds equate to stronger pressure).
        *   **Event-Specific Mapping:**  Assigns unique haptic patterns to different types of events. (E.g., Explosions trigger a strong, short burst of pressure across the entire array).
    *   Orientation-Haptic Synchronization Module: Combines orientation data with haptic event data. The module will alter haptic feedback based on the user’s head orientation.
        *   If the user orients their head toward the *source* of an event in the media, the haptic feedback is *enhanced*.
        *   If the user orients their head *away* from the event, the haptic feedback is *diminished*.
    *   User Calibration Module: Allows users to customize haptic intensity, event mapping, and overall sensitivity to their preferences.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Main Loop
while (mediaPlaying) {

  // 1. Get Orientation Data
  orientationData = getOrientationData();

  // 2. Analyze Media Content
  hapticEvents = analyzeMediaContent();

  // 3.  For each haptic event:
  for (event in hapticEvents) {
    // Calculate Haptic Intensity based on event properties
    intensity = calculateIntensity(event);

    // Modify intensity based on orientation
    orientationFactor = calculateOrientationFactor(orientationData, event);
    intensity = intensity * orientationFactor;

    // Apply haptic feedback
    applyHapticFeedback(intensity, event.location);
  }
}

// Function: calculateOrientationFactor
function calculateOrientationFactor(orientationData, event) {
  // Calculate the angle between the user's head orientation and the event's direction
  angle = calculateAngle(orientationData.headDirection, event.direction);

  // Map the angle to a factor between 0 and 1
  // 1 = Directly facing the event, 0 = Facing away
  factor = mapAngleToFactor(angle);

  return factor;
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive gaming (feel impacts, environmental effects).
*   VR/AR experiences (enhanced sense of presence).
*   Accessibility (providing haptic cues for visually impaired users).
*   Training simulations (realistic feedback for medical, military, and industrial applications).
