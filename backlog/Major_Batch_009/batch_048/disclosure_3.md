## Decentralized Credential Attestation with Zero-Knowledge Proofs

**Concept:** Extend the secure credential storage and reset functionality by integrating a decentralized identity (DID) system and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). This shifts credential storage *off* the central authentication management service and provides user-controlled, privacy-preserving credential resets.

**Specs:**

1.  **DID Integration:**
    *   The authentication management client generates a DID for the user upon initial setup. This DID serves as the user's verifiable digital identity.
    *   Instead of storing encrypted account data *on* the authentication management service, the service acts as an initial “attester” of the user’s credentials. It signs (cryptographically) a statement verifying certain attributes (e.g., “user owns account X on site Y”).  This signed attestation is then stored by the user, linked to their DID.
    *   Subsequent credential changes are not communicated *to* the central service. Instead, the service provides a framework for *proving* changes, via ZKPs.

2.  **Zero-Knowledge Proof Framework:**
    *   The authentication management client incorporates a ZKP library (e.g., Circom, SnarkJS).
    *   When a user requests a credential reset (e.g., password change), the client generates a ZKP demonstrating that the requested change is authorized *without revealing the new credential itself*.
    *   The ZKP circuit takes as input:
        *   The user’s DID.
        *   A cryptographic commitment to the new credential (prevents tampering).
        *   Proof of ownership of the account on the target site (e.g., signing a challenge with the old credential).
        *   A pre-defined policy governing credential resets (e.g., minimum password length, multi-factor authentication requirement).
    *   The ZKP circuit outputs a proof that *all* conditions are met *without revealing the new credential*.

3.  **Credential Revocation & Recovery:**
    *   A decentralized revocation list (DRL) managed via a blockchain or distributed ledger technology (DLT) is implemented.
    *   If a user loses access to their account, a recovery process is initiated. This involves:
        *   A designated set of recovery guardians (identified during initial setup).
        *   Guardians submit a multi-signature transaction to the DRL, authorizing a temporary credential reset.
        *   The ZKP framework verifies the recovery authorization before accepting the reset.

4. **Client-Side Policy Engine:** The authentication management client includes a local policy engine that enforces credential requirements. This minimizes reliance on the central authentication management service during credential changes.

**Pseudocode (ZKP Verification):**

```
function verify_credential_reset(proof, commitment, signature, policy, recovery_authorization):
  // Verify ZKP proof
  if not verify_zkp(proof):
    return false

  // Verify commitment validity
  if not verify_commitment(commitment):
    return false

  // Verify signature authenticity
  if not verify_signature(signature):
    return false

  // Enforce policy rules
  if not enforce_policy(commitment, policy):
    return false

  // Verify recovery authorization (if applicable)
  if recovery_required and not verify_recovery_authorization(recovery_authorization):
    return false

  return true // Credential reset authorized
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Privacy:** Credentials are not stored centrally, reducing the risk of mass data breaches.
*   **User Control:** Users have greater control over their credentials and can manage them independently.
*   **Increased Security:** ZKPs prevent unauthorized credential changes and protect against man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Reduced Reliance on Central Authority:** Decentralization minimizes the risk of service outages and censorship.
