## Acoustic Scene Composition with Generative Spatial Audio

**Concept:** Extend beam selection and spatial audio processing beyond directional speech detection to *compose* entire acoustic scenes based on detected sound sources and generative AI. Instead of simply identifying *where* speech is coming from, the system will create a spatial soundscape, layering sounds originating from estimated locations within the environment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Acquisition & Feature Extraction:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Utilize a high-density microphone array (64+ microphones) for precise spatial localization.
*   **Audio Processing Pipeline:**  Implement a pre-processing stage for noise reduction, echo cancellation, and acoustic feature extraction (MFCCs, spectrograms, etc.).
*   **Source Localization:** Employ advanced source localization algorithms (e.g., MUSIC, ESPRIT) to estimate the 3D position of all detected sound sources (speech, music, environmental sounds).

**2. Generative Acoustic Model:**

*   **Core:** A Variational Autoencoder (VAE) or Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on a massive dataset of environmental sounds and their spatial characteristics.
*   **Spatial Conditioning:**  The generative model is *conditioned* on the estimated 3D position of detected sound sources.  This means the model learns to generate sounds appropriate for that location (e.g., birds chirping in a tree, car sounds from a road).
*   **Sound Category Prediction:** Simultaneously, a classifier predicts the *category* of the sound source (speech, music, traffic, nature, etc.).  This information is fed into the generative model.
*   **Output:** Generates a spatially-coherent audio stream containing both detected and generated sounds.

**3. Acoustic Scene Composition Engine:**

*   **Dynamic Mixing:** A dynamic mixing engine combines the raw audio from the microphone array with the generated audio from the generative model.
*   **Spatialization:**  Utilizes Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) to spatialize the audio, creating a convincing 3D soundscape.
*   **Real-time Processing:** The entire pipeline must operate in real-time with low latency.
*   **User Control:** Allow users to adjust the level of generated sound, the types of sounds generated, and the overall acoustic environment.

**4. Pseudocode (Scene Composition Engine):**

```
FOR each audio frame:
    1.  Process microphone array data -> feature vectors.
    2.  Run DNN Classifier -> identify sound sources, locations, and categories.
    3.  FOR each identified sound source:
            a. Extract audio data from microphone array based on source location.
    4.  FOR each source location *without* a detected source:
            a. Generate sound category based on environment profile.
            b. Generate audio using Generative Acoustic Model, conditioned on location and category.
    5. Mix detected audio and generated audio.
    6. Apply HRTF spatialization.
    7. Output spatialized audio stream.
```

**5. Hardware Requirements:**

*   High-density microphone array (64+ microphones).
*   High-performance CPU and GPU for real-time processing.
*   Dedicated audio interface with low latency.

**6. Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive telepresence and virtual reality.
*   Adaptive sound masking for noisy environments.
*   Enhanced accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
*   Realistic audio simulation for gaming and entertainment.
*   Creation of personalized acoustic environments.
