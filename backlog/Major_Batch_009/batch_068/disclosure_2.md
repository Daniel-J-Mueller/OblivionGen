## Adaptive Ambient Lighting System – ‘AuraSync’

**Concept:** Extend voice control beyond AV devices to include and *react* to content displayed on the AV device via synchronized ambient lighting. Essentially, the system aims to create immersive, reactive environments tailored to displayed content.

**System Components:**

*   **Voice-Controlled Hub:** (Existing tech from the patent - utilized as the core control unit). Must support expanded communication protocols (see below).
*   **Smart Ambient Lights:** Addressable RGB/W LED strips, bulbs, or panels – networked via a low-latency protocol (e.g., Thread, Zigbee, or a proprietary RF solution).
*   **AV Device Interface:** Hardware/software module to analyze video/audio output from the AV display device.  This is the *critical* new component.  Options:
    *   **HDMI Analyzer:**  A dedicated chip that passively monitors HDMI data stream for color, brightness, and audio information.
    *   **Screen Capture/Analysis:** Software running on a connected device (e.g., streaming box, PC) that captures a portion of the screen and analyzes dominant colors and motion.
*   **Content Database/API:** Cloud-based service to store pre-defined lighting profiles for popular streaming services (Netflix, YouTube, Spotify) or game titles.  Allows for dynamic profile updates.

**Functional Specifications:**

1.  **Voice Command Integration:**
    *   "Aura, set mood for [movie title/streaming service/game title]." – Triggers a pre-defined lighting profile or initiates dynamic analysis (see 2).
    *   “Aura, sync lights to [content type - e.g., music, action movie, nature documentary].”
    *   “Aura, brighten/dim the room.”
    *   “Aura, set lights to [color name/preset].”
2.  **Dynamic Content Analysis:**
    *   The AV Device Interface continuously analyzes the displayed content in real-time.
    *   **Color Extraction:** Dominant colors are extracted from the video frame. A weighted average of colors across the screen can be used.
    *   **Brightness/Contrast Detection:** System detects overall brightness and contrast levels of the displayed image.
    *   **Motion Detection:** System monitors movement within the video frame (e.g., fast action sequence, panning shot).
    *   **Audio Analysis:** Extracts audio characteristics (e.g., bass, treble, volume) to supplement visual data.
3.  **Lighting Control Algorithm:**
    *   Based on the analyzed data, the system adjusts the color, brightness, and patterns of the smart ambient lights.
    *   **Example Scenarios:**
        *   **Action Movie:** Rapid color shifts synced to explosions and fast-paced action.  Increased brightness during intense scenes.
        *   **Nature Documentary:**  Soft, natural colors mimicking the displayed scenery.  Slow color transitions.
        *   **Music:**  Pulsating lights synced to the beat of the music.  Color changes based on genre.
4.  **User Customization:**
    *   Users can create and save custom lighting profiles.
    *   Adjust intensity, color palettes, and transition speeds.
    *   Configure the system to prioritize certain content sources or streaming services.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
function analyze_content(video_stream, audio_stream):
  dominant_colors = extract_dominant_colors(video_stream)
  brightness = calculate_brightness(video_stream)
  motion = detect_motion(video_stream)
  audio_characteristics = analyze_audio(audio_stream)
  return dominant_colors, brightness, motion, audio_characteristics

function apply_lighting_profile(profile_name, content_data):
  if profile_name == "action":
    color = content_data["dominant_colors"]
    brightness = content_data["brightness"] * 1.5
    pattern = "fast_shift"
  elif profile_name == "nature":
    color = content_data["dominant_colors"]
    brightness = content_data["brightness"] * 0.8
    pattern = "slow_fade"
  # ... other profiles

  set_ambient_lights(color, brightness, pattern)

function on_voice_command(command):
  if command == "set mood for [movie]":
    profile = get_profile_for_movie(movie)
    content_data = analyze_content(video_stream, audio_stream)
    apply_lighting_profile(profile, content_data)
  # ... other commands

```

**Future Enhancements:**

*   **AI-powered content understanding:** Use machine learning to identify the *emotional tone* of the content and adjust the lighting accordingly.
*   **Integration with smart home ecosystems:**  Connect the system to other smart devices (e.g., smart blinds, thermostats) to create a fully immersive environment.
*   **Haptic feedback:**  Synchronize lighting with haptic devices (e.g., vibrating cushions) for a more engaging experience.
