## Adaptive Quorum with Predictive Repair

**Concept:** Extend the individual write quorum approach by integrating predictive failure analysis and pre-replication to *dynamically* adjust quorum membership *before* potential node failures, aiming to minimize recovery time and maintain data availability.

**Specs:**

1.  **Failure Prediction Module:** Each storage node runs a localized, lightweight machine learning model trained on its own performance metrics (disk I/O, CPU usage, network latency, error rates) and correlated with cluster-wide failure events. This module outputs a rolling ‘health score’ and a ‘predicted time to failure’ (PTF) estimate.  Data for training could be a rolling window of 30-60 days, depending on operational characteristics. The model can be a simple exponential smoothing or a more complex time series forecasting method.

2.  **Dynamic Quorum Adjustment:** A centralized (or distributed consensus-based) Quorum Manager monitors health scores and PTF estimates from all nodes. 
    *   If a node’s PTF falls below a configurable threshold (e.g., 24 hours), the Quorum Manager initiates a ‘quorum shift’.
    *   The quorum shift proactively adds one or more ‘shadow’ nodes to the quorum set *before* the predicted failure.  Shadow nodes are selected based on available capacity, network proximity, and current load. The selection algorithm must avoid concentrating risk (e.g., avoid selecting multiple nodes from the same rack or availability zone).
    *   The system begins replicating data to the shadow nodes *immediately*. This replication can be incremental to minimize bandwidth usage.
    *   The client-side storage driver is updated to be aware of the dynamic quorum membership. This awareness is achieved through a metadata service that provides the current active quorum set for each client.

3.  **Write Path Modifications:**
    *   When a client sends a write request, the driver identifies the current quorum set (including potential shadow nodes).
    *   The write is sent to the quorum set, and acknowledgments are collected as usual.
    *   A ‘replication progress’ indicator tracks the completion of replication to the shadow nodes.  This indicator is returned to the client as part of the write response.

4.  **Failure Handling:**
    *   If a node fails, the system automatically detects the failure.
    *   Since the data has already been replicated to the shadow nodes, the system can seamlessly switch over to the replicated data without requiring a full recovery process.
    *   The Quorum Manager automatically promotes the shadow nodes to become permanent members of the quorum set.
    *   A background process initiates data rebalancing to distribute the load evenly across the remaining nodes.

5. **Metadata Service:**
    * Stores mapping between client & its active quorum set.
    * Tracks replication progress per node/log record.
    *  Provides APIs for querying active quorum, replication status, and predicted failures.

**Pseudocode (Quorum Manager):**

```
function monitor_nodes():
  for each node in cluster:
    health_score = get_node_health_score(node)
    ptf = get_predicted_time_to_failure(node)
    if ptf < threshold:
      quorum_shift(node)

function quorum_shift(failing_node):
  shadow_nodes = select_shadow_nodes(failing_node)
  add_shadow_nodes_to_quorum(shadow_nodes)
  initiate_replication(failing_node, shadow_nodes)
  update_metadata_service(shadow_nodes)

function select_shadow_nodes(failing_node):
  # Criteria: Available capacity, network proximity, load balancing, rack diversity
  candidates = get_candidate_nodes()
  sorted_candidates = sort_candidates_by_criteria(candidates)
  return sorted_candidates[:N] # N = number of shadow nodes

function initiate_replication(failing_node, shadow_nodes):
  for each shadow_node in shadow_nodes:
    start_replication_process(failing_node, shadow_node)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced recovery time from node failures.
*   Improved data availability.
*   Proactive fault tolerance.
*   More graceful handling of node failures.
