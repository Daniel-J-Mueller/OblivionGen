## HSM-Based Decentralized Identity Attestation

**Concept:** Leverage the secure enclave properties of HSMs not just for key storage and cryptographic operations, but as anchors for a decentralized identity system where attestation of identity characteristics is performed *within* the HSM itself, preventing external compromise.

**Specifications:**

*   **HSM Role:** Each HSM functions as a “verifier” for specific identity attributes. Instead of *holding* identifying information, the HSM holds cryptographic proof generation capabilities related to attributes it has verified.
*   **Attribute Registration:** An entity (e.g., a government agency, university) possessing verified attributes registers a public key with an HSM. This key is used for signing attestations.  The HSM *does not* store the attribute data itself, only the registration of the public key as a trusted source for that attribute.
*   **Attestation Protocol:**
    1.  A presenter (entity seeking to prove identity) initiates a request for attestation of a specific attribute (e.g., “Driver’s License Valid”).
    2.  A designated HSM (verified as the authority for that attribute type) receives the request.
    3.  The HSM queries a trusted data source (e.g., a database) to confirm the attribute's validity for the presenter.
    4.  If valid, the HSM generates a digitally signed attestation using its private key (secured within the HSM) and the presenter's identifier.  The attestation includes a timestamp and validity period.
    5.  The HSM returns the signed attestation to the presenter.
*   **Verifier Operation:** A relying party receives the attestation from the presenter. The relying party validates the attestation:
    1.  Retrieves the corresponding public key of the HSM from a publicly available registry.
    2.  Verifies the digital signature of the HSM on the attestation.
    3.  Checks the timestamp and validity period to ensure the attestation is current.
*   **Key Rotation & Revocation:** HSMs participate in a distributed key rotation scheme.  Revoked HSMs are flagged in the public registry, preventing reliance on their attestations.
*   **HSM Intercommunication:** HSMs communicate with each other to verify the status of other HSMs and share revocation lists, enhancing system trust.
*   **Non-Exportable Attribute Mapping:** The HSM stores a mapping between attribute identifiers and the specific data sources used for verification. This mapping is non-exportable, preventing unauthorized access to verification sources.

**Pseudocode (HSM Attestation Generation):**

```
function generateAttestation(attributeIdentifier, presenterIdentifier):
    // 1. Retrieve attribute verification source from non-exportable mapping
    verificationSource = getVerificationSource(attributeIdentifier)

    // 2. Query verification source for attribute validity
    attributeValid = queryVerificationSource(verificationSource, presenterIdentifier)

    if attributeValid:
        // 3. Create attestation data
        attestationData = {
            "attributeIdentifier": attributeIdentifier,
            "presenterIdentifier": presenterIdentifier,
            "timestamp": getCurrentTimestamp(),
            "validityPeriod": DEFAULT_VALIDITY_PERIOD
        }

        // 4. Sign attestation data using HSM private key
        signedAttestation = sign(attestationData, HSM_PRIVATE_KEY)

        // 5. Return signed attestation
        return signedAttestation
    else:
        // Attribute not valid
        return ERROR_INVALID_ATTRIBUTE
```

**Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   Standard HSMs with secure key storage and cryptographic processing capabilities.
*   Secure communication channels between HSMs and external data sources.
*   Publicly accessible registry for HSM public keys and revocation lists.
*   Software agents for managing HSM interactions and attestation requests.
*   Trusted data sources for attribute verification.
