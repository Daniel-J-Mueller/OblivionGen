## Adaptive Hierarchy Sharding with Dynamic Consistency

**Concept:** Expand the non-overlapping update concept into a full-blown sharding strategy for extremely large, hierarchical datasets. Instead of simply preventing conflicts during updates, proactively *shard* the hierarchy based on anticipated access/modification patterns, and dynamically adjust sharding based on real-time usage. Introduce varying levels of consistency per shard.

**Specification:**

**1. Hierarchy Profiler:**
    *   **Input:**  Hierarchical dataset (as described in the provided patent), access logs, modification timestamps.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Analyze access patterns: Identify frequently co-accessed subtrees.
        *   Calculate 'cohesion score' for each subtree (based on frequency of joint access).
        *   Identify 'hotspots' - subtrees with high modification rates.
        *   Build a 'sharding recommendation graph' – a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent subtrees, and edges represent potential sharding boundaries (based on cohesion scores and hotspot analysis).
    *   **Output:** Sharding recommendation graph.

**2. Dynamic Sharding Engine:**
    *   **Input:** Sharding recommendation graph, current load metrics (CPU, memory, network), user-defined latency requirements.
    *   **Process:**
        *   Apply a cost function to evaluate different sharding configurations (based on the recommendation graph, load metrics, and latency requirements). This cost function should consider inter-shard communication overhead, data replication costs, and the impact on query performance.
        *   Select the optimal sharding configuration.
        *   Dynamically split/merge shards based on the selected configuration. This process should be minimally disruptive – utilize techniques like online schema changes and data migration.
    *   **Output:** Active shard configuration.

**3. Adaptive Consistency Levels:**
    *   **Process:**
        *   Assign different consistency levels to different shards, based on their usage patterns.
            *   **Read-heavy shards:** Employ eventual consistency with optimistic locking.
            *   **Write-heavy shards:**  Utilize strong consistency with multi-version concurrency control (MVCC).
            *   **Critical data shards:** Enforce strict serializability.
        *   Implement a consistency manager that dynamically adjusts consistency levels based on real-time load and user-defined policies.
    *   **Output:** Shard-specific consistency configuration.

**4.  Projection-Aware Routing:**
    *   **Process:**  Extend the existing projection mechanism to route updates and reads to the appropriate shard(s).
        *   The Projection-Aware Router maintains a mapping between projections and shard IDs.
        *   Upon receiving a request, the router identifies the relevant shard(s) based on the projection and routes the request accordingly.
    *   **Output:** Route requests to specific shards.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Shard Selection):**

```
function selectShard(projection, shardMap):
  shardId = shardMap.get(projection)
  if shardId is None:
    // Calculate shard ID based on projection path
    shardId = calculateShardId(projection)
    shardMap.put(projection, shardId)
  return shardId

function calculateShardId(projection):
  // Based on the projection path, determine the appropriate shard.
  // Utilize a hashing function or range-based partitioning.
  return hash(projection) % numShards
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **Shard Map:**  A dictionary storing the mapping between projections and shard IDs.
*   **Sharding Recommendation Graph:** DAG representing potential sharding boundaries.
*   **Shard Metadata:** Information about each shard (ID, location, consistency level, load metrics).
