## Dynamic Segment Importance Weighting for UI Regression

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on segment-level matching for UI regression testing. This builds on that by introducing dynamic weighting of segments based on perceived user importance and change sensitivity. Segments representing critical user interaction points (buttons, input fields) or frequently updated data receive higher weighting. Changes in these high-weight segments trigger more immediate and detailed analysis, while changes in low-weight segments are treated as less critical or ignored.

**Specifications:**

**1. Segment Importance Profile Generation:**

*   **Input:** Network page DOM structure (HTML/CSS), historical user interaction data (clicks, scrolls, form submissions), business rules defining critical elements.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Heuristic Assignment:** Initial importance scores assigned based on element type (e.g., buttons = 0.8, text blocks = 0.2, images = 0.3).
    *   **Interaction Weighting:** Scores adjusted based on frequency of user interaction. Higher interaction frequency = higher weight.  A decaying average should be applied to account for changes in user behavior over time.
    *   **Business Rule Overrides:**  Manual overrides to increase/decrease segment weights based on critical business functions.
    *   **Output:**  A JSON file containing a segment ID to importance weight mapping for each network page.  Format: `{ "segment_id_1": 0.9, "segment_id_2": 0.2, ... }`.

**2.  Change Impact Calculation:**

*   **Input:**  Two images of the same network page (before/after), segment importance profile, segment differences (from the existing patent's image comparison process).
*   **Process:**
    *   For each segment, calculate a weighted difference score: `Weighted Difference = Segment Difference * Segment Importance Weight`.
    *   Sum the weighted differences for all segments.
    *   Compare the total weighted difference to a dynamic threshold.  The threshold can be adjusted based on the severity of potential issues.
*   **Output:** A single score representing the overall change impact.

**3.  Adaptive Thresholding:**

*   **Process:**
    *   Maintain a rolling average of change impact scores over time.
    *   Dynamically adjust the threshold based on the rolling average. If the rolling average is consistently low, the threshold can be lowered to detect more subtle changes. If the rolling average is high, the threshold can be raised to reduce false positives.
*   **Output:** The current change impact threshold.

**4.  Alerting System:**

*   **Process:**
    *   If the total weighted difference exceeds the change impact threshold, trigger an alert.
    *   Alerts should include:
        *   The total weighted difference score.
        *   A list of the segments with the highest weighted differences.
        *   Screenshots of the changed segments.
*   **Output:** An alert notification with detailed information about the changes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_change_impact(image1, image2, importance_profile):
  segment_differences = compare_images(image1, image2) // From existing patent
  total_weighted_difference = 0

  for segment_id, difference in segment_differences.items():
    if segment_id in importance_profile:
      weight = importance_profile[segment_id]
      total_weighted_difference += difference * weight

  return total_weighted_difference

function adaptive_threshold(historical_scores, current_score, learning_rate):
  average_score = calculate_average(historical_scores)
  threshold = average_score + learning_rate * (current_score - average_score)
  return threshold
```

**Engineering Considerations:**

*   The segment importance profile can be pre-computed and stored for each network page.
*   The learning rate for adaptive thresholding should be carefully tuned to balance sensitivity and stability.
*   Integration with existing CI/CD pipelines for automated UI regression testing.
*   UI for managing segment importance profiles and alert configurations.
