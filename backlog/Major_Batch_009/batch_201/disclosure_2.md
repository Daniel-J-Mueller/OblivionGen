## Dynamic Haptic Feedback Synchronization with Audio

**Core Concept:** Extend the audio-driven power modulation concept to *simultaneously* control a haptic feedback actuator, creating a synchronized audio-haptic experience tailored to the audio signal characteristics. This isn't simply about vibrating *with* the audio, but dynamically adjusting the haptic intensity *based* on the power delivery scheme already in place for the audio amplifier.

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Actuator:** Piezoelectric transducer, chosen for its rapid response time and low power consumption. Integrated *within* the device chassis for direct user contact.
*   **Power Management Unit (PMU) Integration:** The existing multi-stage power converter (boost/buck) is modified to include a dedicated output stage for the haptic actuator, controlled by a secondary PWM signal. The same processor logic controlling audio amplifier power also controls the haptic PWM duty cycle.
*   **Audio Analysis Module:** The processor analyzes incoming audio for amplitude *and* spectral content (frequency distribution). This data informs *both* audio amplifier power *and* haptic actuator PWM duty cycle.
*   **Haptic Mapping Profiles:** Predefined mapping profiles link specific audio characteristics to haptic responses.  Examples:
    *   Low Amplitude/High Frequency (e.g., cymbals, high-pitched synth):  Brief, sharp haptic pulses. Low power.
    *   High Amplitude/Low Frequency (e.g., bass drum, deep vocals): Sustained, stronger haptic vibration. Higher power.
    *   Mid-Range Audio: Moderate haptic response.
*   **Dynamic Range Control:** A dynamic range algorithm ensures haptic feedback remains perceptible across all audio levels without becoming overwhelming or fatiguing. This algorithm adjusts the haptic intensity based on the overall audio signal loudness.
*   **User Customization:** A user interface (software) allows adjustment of haptic intensity and selection of pre-defined or custom mapping profiles.
*   **Power Optimization:** The haptic actuator's power draw is directly linked to the audio amplifier's power delivery.  During low-power audio playback, haptic feedback is minimized to conserve battery life.

**Pseudocode (Processor Logic):**

```
// Input: Audio Signal, External Power Status
// Output: Audio Amplifier Voltage, Haptic Actuator PWM Duty Cycle

function processAudio(audioSignal, externalPower) {

  amplitude = calculateAmplitude(audioSignal);
  frequency = calculateDominantFrequency(audioSignal);

  if (amplitude < loudnessThreshold && frequency > frequencyThreshold) {
    // Low amplitude, high frequency (e.g. cymbal)
    audioVoltage = lowPowerVoltage;
    hapticDutyCycle = shortPulseDutyCycle;
  } else if (amplitude > amplitudeThreshold && frequency < frequencyThreshold) {
    // High amplitude, low frequency (e.g. bass)
    audioVoltage = highPowerVoltage;
    hapticDutyCycle = sustainedVibrationDutyCycle;
  } else {
    // Default - Midrange
    audioVoltage = defaultVoltage;
    hapticDutyCycle = defaultDutyCycle;
  }

  if (!externalPower) {
    // External power unavailable - reduce power consumption
    audioVoltage *= powerReductionFactor;
    hapticDutyCycle *= powerReductionFactor;
  }

  setAudioAmplifierVoltage(audioVoltage);
  setHapticActuatorDutyCycle(hapticDutyCycle);
}
```

**Expansion Points:**

*   **Directional Haptics:** Integrate multiple haptic actuators to create a sense of directional audio.
*   **Gaming Applications:**  Map in-game events (e.g., impacts, explosions) directly to haptic feedback.
*   **Accessibility Features:** Enhance audio perception for users with hearing impairments.
*   **Biometric Integration:** Adjust haptic feedback based on user's physiological state (e.g., heart rate, stress level).
