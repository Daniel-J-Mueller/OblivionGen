## Adaptive Packet Reconstruction with Temporal Awareness

**Specification:** A system to dynamically reconstruct fragmented or out-of-order packets, leveraging a temporal buffer and probabilistic path prediction to minimize latency and maximize throughput.

**Core Concept:** Existing packet processing often assumes complete and in-order delivery. This design addresses scenarios with high packet loss or reordering – common in wireless or congested networks – by proactively buffering fragments and predicting likely completion paths.

**Components:**

*   **Temporal Buffer:** A multi-tiered buffer designed to store partial packets (fragments, out-of-order segments) keyed by a unique Flow ID (combination of source/destination IP/Port).  The buffer comprises:
    *   *Fast Tier:*  Small, SRAM-based, for recently received fragments – ultra-low latency access.
    *   *Medium Tier:* DRAM-based, larger capacity, for fragments with moderate age.
    *   *Slow Tier:*  SSD/NVMe-based, highest capacity, for older fragments – used only if reconstruction requires data beyond the first two tiers.
*   **Fragment Analyzer:**  Examines incoming fragments, identifying key parameters:
    *   Fragment Offset
    *   Fragment Length
    *   Next Hop (if available in fragment header)
    *   Time of Arrival
*   **Path Predictor:**  An AI-driven module that predicts the most likely completion path for a given flow. This is achieved by:
    *   Analyzing historical flow data.
    *   Identifying common packet loss patterns.
    *   Considering network topology information (if available).
    *   Utilizing a reinforcement learning model to refine predictions based on observed performance.
*   **Reconstruction Engine:** Assembles complete packets from fragments stored in the temporal buffer, guided by the Path Predictor. It prioritizes fragments predicted to arrive soonest, minimizing reconstruction latency.
*   **Flow Manager:** Tracks active flows, manages the temporal buffer, and coordinates the other modules.

**Pseudocode (Reconstruction Engine):**

```
function reconstructPacket(flowID):
  packet = new Packet()
  fragments = getFragments(flowID)
  sortFragments(fragments, predictedArrivalTime) // Based on Path Predictor
  
  for fragment in fragments:
    if fragment.offset == 0:
      packet.header = fragment.header
    
    if fragment.offset + fragment.length <= packet.maxSize:
      packet.data += fragment.data
    else:
      // Truncate if necessary, logging the event
      log("Packet truncated due to size limits.")
      break
  
  if packet.isComplete():
    return packet
  else:
    // Hold packet in partial buffer for further fragments
    storePartialPacket(packet)
    return null
```

**Novelty:**

*   **Predictive Reconstruction:**  Unlike traditional buffering which waits for all fragments, this system proactively predicts and prioritizes likely fragments.
*   **Multi-Tiered Buffer with Temporal Awareness:** The tiered buffer optimizes for both speed and capacity, while the temporal awareness ensures that frequently accessed fragments are readily available.
*   **AI-Driven Path Prediction:** The use of reinforcement learning allows the system to adapt to changing network conditions and improve its prediction accuracy over time.
*   **Adaptive Truncation:** The system doesn't simply drop oversized packets but adaptively truncates them, potentially preserving some usable data.
