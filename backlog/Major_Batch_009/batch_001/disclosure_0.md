## Dynamic Material Sculpting with Projected Force Fields

**Concept:** Expand the projection system to not only *guide* activity but to actively *manipulate* materials during the process. Instead of simply projecting lines for folding or cutting, project focused ultrasonic or electrostatic fields to temporarily bind, lift, or shape materials in real-time.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Augmented Projection System: Core system inherited from the base patent. Requires modification to support high-frequency emission.
    *   Multi-Modal Emitter Array: Replace existing projector lens with a phased array of micro-emitters capable of both visible light *and* directed ultrasonic/electrostatic energy.  Array resolution: 5000x5000 micro-emitters. Emission frequency range: 20kHz – 5MHz ultrasonic, 0 – 10kV electrostatic.
    *   Material Sensing Suite: Integrated array of proximity, force, and capacitive sensors surrounding the projection area.  Data feeds into real-time control algorithms. Resolution: 1mm.
    *   Precision Stage:  A small, automated platform upon which materials are placed. Allows for Z-axis control and tilting for complex manipulations. Travel Range: 30cm x 30cm x 10cm.
*   **Software:**
    *   Material Database:  A library of material properties (density, rigidity, electrostatic charge affinity, ultrasonic resonance frequencies) required for accurate manipulation. Users can add custom materials.
    *   Force Field Designer:  A visual programming interface allowing users to define ‘force field templates’.  These templates specify the intensity, frequency, and shape of emitted energy for specific manipulation tasks.
    *   Real-Time Control Algorithm:  This algorithm takes input from the Material Sensing Suite and the Force Field Designer, and dynamically adjusts the emitter array to achieve desired material manipulation.  Utilizes PID control loops and predictive modeling.
    *   Activity Template Integration:  Existing activity templates are modified to incorporate force field control parameters.  For example, a "folding template" would now include not only projected fold lines, but also localized ultrasonic fields to temporarily hold the material in place during folding.

**Pseudocode (Force Field Control Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    Read Sensor Data (proximity, force, capacitance)
    Calculate Error (desired material position vs. actual position)
    Adjust Emitter Array Parameters (intensity, frequency, phase) based on Error
    Transmit Control Signals to Emitter Array
    WAIT(0.01 seconds)
ENDLOOP
```

**Example Application (Origami Assistant):**

1.  User selects an origami template.
2.  System projects the initial folding instructions onto the paper.
3.  Localized ultrasonic fields temporarily bind the paper at each fold line, preventing slippage.
4.  The system calculates the next fold based on user progress (detected via camera) and projects the instructions.
5.  Ultrasonic fields maintain the shape, and the process repeats until the origami is complete.

**Novelty:** This goes beyond passive guidance. The system actively shapes materials, enabling complex tasks that would be impossible with traditional methods.  The combination of projection and directed energy fields creates a new paradigm for material manipulation and interactive design.
