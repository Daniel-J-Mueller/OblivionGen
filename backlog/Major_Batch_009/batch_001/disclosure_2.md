## Adaptive Acoustic Scene Reconstruction

**Concept:** Expand echo cancellation beyond simply *removing* unwanted sound to *reconstructing* the acoustic environment, allowing for selective sound capture and manipulation. Instead of just suppressing echoes, analyze the combined signal (direct sound + reflections) to create a spatial model of the room and isolate individual sound sources.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-microphone array (minimum 8 microphones, strategically placed for 3D sound capture).
    *   High-performance DSP/FPGA for real-time signal processing.
    *   Optional: IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) to track microphone array movement & orientation.
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Beamforming & Source Localization:** Utilize advanced beamforming techniques (e.g., Delay-and-Sum, MVDR, MUSIC) combined with Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) calculations to pinpoint sound source locations in 3D space.  Implement robust tracking algorithms to follow moving sources.
    *   **Acoustic Scene Modeling:**  Build a dynamic spatial map of the environment using ray tracing or similar techniques.  Estimate Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) based on microphone array data and environmental geometry. Use the RIR to represent echoes and reflections.
    *   **Adaptive Echo Separation & Reconstruction:** Employ a hybrid approach combining adaptive filtering (similar to the provided patent, but focused on *isolating* echoes rather than suppressing them) with source separation algorithms (e.g., Independent Component Analysis, Non-negative Matrix Factorization).  The goal is to *de-mix* the combined signal into its constituent components â€“ direct sound, early reflections, late reverberation, and distinct sound sources.
    *   **Spatial Audio Manipulation:** Allow for selective manipulation of the reconstructed sound field.  This could include:
        *   **Spatial Filtering:** Attenuate or amplify sound from specific directions.
        *   **Source Isolation:** Extract a single sound source from the combined signal.
        *   **Virtual Source Creation:** Synthesize new sound sources at arbitrary locations.
        *   **Acoustic Beam Steering:** Dynamically redirect sound waves using phase and amplitude adjustments in the reconstructed sound field.
*   **Algorithm Pseudocode (Echo Separation & Reconstruction):**

```
// Input: Mixed signal (x[n]), Reference signal (y[n]), Microphone array geometry
// Output: Estimated direct sound (s_direct[n]), Estimated echo signal (s_echo[n])

// 1. Estimate Room Impulse Response (RIR) - using System Identification techniques
RIR = SystemIdentification(y[n], x[n], microphone_geometry)

// 2. Deconvolve the mixed signal using the estimated RIR
s_echo[n] = Convolution(x[n], RIR) //Estimated Echo

s_direct[n] = x[n] - s_echo[n] //Remaining signal is estimated direct sound.

// 3. Refine direct sound estimate with advanced source separation techniques
//    (ICA, NMF, etc.) to further isolate desired source from residual echoes

// 4. Update RIR based on changes in environment (user movement, object rearrangement)
//    using real-time tracking and adaptive filtering.
```

*   **Applications:**
    *   **Advanced Teleconferencing:**  Isolate individual speakers in a noisy environment, suppress background noise, and create a more immersive audio experience.
    *   **Virtual/Augmented Reality:** Create realistic and spatially accurate soundscapes for VR/AR applications.
    *   **Smart Home/Office:**  Control and manipulate sound in a room to create optimal acoustic environments for different activities.
    *   **Security & Surveillance:**  Enhance audio recording quality, isolate voices in crowded areas, and detect abnormal sounds.
    *   **Acoustic Beamforming Microphones:** Significantly enhance directional microphone performance.
