**Dynamic Contextual Audio Integration**

**Concept:** Extend the visual emphasis techniques described in the patent to include dynamically generated and layered audio cues, creating a multi-sensory reading experience. This moves beyond simply highlighting text; it *sounds* like the text is emphasized, and leverages spatial audio to create a more immersive experience.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Audio Cue Generation Module:**
    *   Input: Selected text segment (primary text), surrounding text (secondary text), user-defined audio profiles (e.g., “calm,” “energetic,” “narrative”).
    *   Process:
        *   Analyze primary text for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral).
        *   Generate a base audio cue (short sound effect, ambient tone) corresponding to the sentiment.
        *   Modulate the base cue based on text characteristics (e.g., length, punctuation). Longer sentences could have sustained tones; questions could have rising intonation.
        *   Generate secondary audio cues for surrounding text, lower in volume and potentially utilizing different timbres (e.g., a subtle whoosh, a low hum).
2.  **Spatial Audio Engine:**
    *   Input: Audio cues, text position on screen.
    *   Process:
        *   Pan primary audio cue to the location of the emphasized text on the screen using head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) to simulate sound source location.
        *   Position secondary audio cues around the primary cue, creating an “aura” of sound.
        *   Adjust volume and panning based on screen orientation (portrait/landscape).
3.  **Animation Synchronization:**
    *   Input: Visual emphasis animation sequence (from patent), audio cues.
    *   Process:
        *   Synchronize audio cue onset with the initial visual emphasis effect.
        *   Modulate audio cue volume and panning to match the animation sequence (e.g., increase volume as the visual effect intensifies, pan with the animation).
        *   Implement a decay curve for the audio cues to match the visual effect decay.
4.  **User Profiles & Customization:**
    *   Allow users to create and select audio profiles.
    *   Provide options for adjusting volume, timbre, and spatialization of audio cues.
    *   Enable users to disable audio cues altogether.
5.  **Hardware Integration:**
    *   Optimize for devices with built-in spatial audio capabilities (e.g., headphones with HRTF support).
    *   Provide fallback mechanisms for devices without spatial audio support (e.g., stereo panning).

**Pseudocode (Audio Cue Generation):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateAudioCue(textSegment, surroundingText, userProfile):
  sentiment = AnalyzeSentiment(textSegment)
  baseCue = SelectBaseCue(sentiment, userProfile)
  modulation = CalculateModulation(textSegment)
  modulatedCue = ApplyModulation(baseCue, modulation)
  secondaryCue = GenerateSecondaryCue(surroundingText, userProfile)
  RETURN modulatedCue, secondaryCue
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Narrative Integration:**  Allow users to upload or select pre-recorded audio narrations that can be synchronized with the text.
*   **Emotionally Responsive Audio:** Use AI to analyze the emotional content of the text and generate audio cues that reflect those emotions.
*   **Haptic Feedback:** Integrate haptic feedback to provide tactile cues alongside the visual and audio emphasis.
