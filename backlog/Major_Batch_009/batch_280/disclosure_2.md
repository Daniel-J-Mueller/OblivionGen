## Dynamic Embedding Space Partitioning for Scalable Image Search

**Concept:** Extend the backward compatibility training with a dynamic partitioning system for the embedding space, optimized for both speed and recall in large-scale image search. The current patent focuses on ensuring new embedding models remain compatible with older ones. This builds on that by actively *organizing* the embedding space to improve search efficiency *after* training, and adapting that organization over time.

**Specifications:**

**1.  Embedding Space Partitioning Module:**

   *   **Input:**  A trained embedding model (either the original or the backward-compatible new model). A dataset of images (for initial partitioning, or a sample thereof).
   *   **Process:**
        *   Generate embeddings for the input image dataset.
        *   Employ a hierarchical clustering algorithm (e.g., Ward's linkage) to partition the embedding space.  The number of clusters is dynamically determined based on dataset size and desired recall/precision trade-offs.  Start with a small number of coarse clusters.
        *   For each cluster, record a representative embedding vector (centroid).
        *   Assign each embedding vector in the dataset to its nearest cluster centroid.
   *   **Output:** A partitioning structure (e.g., a tree or graph) representing the clustered embedding space.  Mapping of embedding vectors to cluster IDs.

**2.  Query Routing Module:**

   *   **Input:** A query image, the partitioning structure, the trained embedding model.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Generate an embedding vector for the query image.
        *   Determine the most likely cluster for the query embedding (based on distance to cluster centroids).
        *   **Limited Search:**  Perform the initial search *only* within the determined cluster.
        *   **Expansion Phase:** If the initial search yields insufficient results (based on a configurable threshold), expand the search to neighboring clusters (defined by adjacency in the clustering structure).  Adjust the number of neighboring clusters searched dynamically based on confidence levels.
   *   **Output:** Ranked list of matching images.

**3.  Dynamic Re-Partitioning Module:**

   *   **Input:**  Search logs (query embeddings, clicked images), a performance metric (e.g., average search time, recall at k), a trigger threshold.
   *   **Process:**
        *   Periodically (or triggered by performance degradation) analyze search logs.
        *   Identify clusters with high search costs or low recall.
        *   **Fine-Grained Re-Clustering:**  Re-cluster the problematic cluster using a finer-grained clustering algorithm. This creates sub-clusters.
        *   **Cluster Splitting/Merging:**  Dynamically split overpopulated clusters or merge similar, sparsely populated clusters.
        *   Update the partitioning structure and cluster assignments.
   *   **Output:**  Updated partitioning structure.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Re-Partitioning):**

```
function dynamic_repartition(search_logs, performance_metric, threshold):
  problematic_clusters = identify_problematic_clusters(search_logs, performance_metric, threshold)
  for cluster_id in problematic_clusters:
    cluster_embeddings = get_embeddings_for_cluster(cluster_id)
    if len(cluster_embeddings) > max_cluster_size:
      sub_clusters = perform_fine_grained_clustering(cluster_embeddings)
      update_partition_structure(cluster_id, sub_clusters)
    else if cluster_density < min_cluster_density:
      neighbor_clusters = find_nearby_clusters(cluster_id)
      if neighbor_clusters exist:
        merge_clusters(cluster_id, neighbor_clusters)
  return updated_partition_structure
```

**Novelty:**

The core innovation lies in the *dynamic* and adaptive nature of the embedding space partitioning.  The system doesn't just create a static partition; it actively monitors search performance and adjusts the partition structure to optimize search efficiency. This is particularly important in scenarios where the image dataset is constantly evolving, or where search patterns change over time.  The backward compatibility aspect ensures that even with re-partitioning, older embeddings remain searchable, while the dynamic component allows for scalability and improved performance on new data.
