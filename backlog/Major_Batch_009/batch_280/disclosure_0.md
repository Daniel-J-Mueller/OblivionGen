## Dynamic Proximity-Based Event Triggering & Augmented Reality Layering

**Concept:** Expand location-based services beyond simple user location sharing. Implement a system where user proximity *triggers* pre-defined events and layers augmented reality content onto the user's view, all managed through a centralized platform. This moves beyond "where are my friends?" to "what happens *when* my friends are nearby?".

**Specs:**

**1. Event Definition Module:**

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `Event`: {`EventID`, `EventName`, `TriggerType` (proximity, time, condition), `TriggerParameters` (distance, time, conditional logic), `ActionType` (AR overlay, notification, API call, data transmission), `ActionParameters`, `UserGroup` (optional – limits event to specific users/groups), `ExpirationDate` (optional)}.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   `CreateEvent(Event)`:  Adds a new event to the system.
    *   `EditEvent(EventID, Event)`: Modifies an existing event.
    *   `DeleteEvent(EventID)`: Removes an event.
    *   `ListEvents(UserGroup)`: Returns a list of active events applicable to a given user group.
*   **API Endpoints:**  `POST /events`, `PUT /events/{EventID}`, `DELETE /events/{EventID}`, `GET /events?group={group}`

**2. Proximity Engine:**

*   **Input:**  Real-time location data from user devices (lat/long, accuracy).
*   **Process:**
    *   Continuously scans for users within defined proximity ranges (defined in `Event` records).
    *   Utilizes a geofencing approach to optimize performance (detecting entry/exit from virtual boundaries).
    *   Implements a dynamic range adjustment algorithm – adjusts proximity range based on user movement (faster movement = wider range to account for potential 'misses').
*   **Output:**  List of triggered `EventID`s and associated user data.

**3. Augmented Reality Layer Manager:**

*   **Input:**  `EventID` with associated AR content specifications.  Specifications include:
    *   `ContentType`: (3D model, image, video, text)
    *   `ContentURL`:  URL pointing to AR content.
    *   `AnchorType`: (location-based, device-based, image-based). Location based AR overlays content based on coordinates, device based overlays content on the device itself, image based overlays content when a specific image is detected via camera.
    *   `Scale`, `Rotation`, `Offset`.
*   **Process:**
    *   Retrieves AR content from the specified URL.
    *   Uses device's AR capabilities (ARKit, ARCore) to render the content in the user's view.
    *   Handles content updates and synchronization across multiple users.
*   **Output:** Augmented reality view rendered on user's device.

**4. Data Transmission Module:**

*   **Functionality:** Allows events to trigger the transmission of data between users. This could include file sharing, message broadcasting, or API calls to external services.
*   **Data Structures:** `DataPayload`: {`DataType`, `DataContent`}.
*   **Security:**  Encryption and access control mechanisms to ensure data privacy.

**Pseudocode (Event Processing):**

```
LOOP:
  FOR EACH UserDevice IN UserDevices:
    UserLocation = GetLocation(UserDevice)
    ActiveEvents = ListEvents(GetUserGroup(UserDevice))

    FOR EACH Event IN ActiveEvents:
      IF Event.TriggerType == "proximity":
        FOR EACH OtherUserDevice IN UserDevices:
          OtherUserLocation = GetLocation(OtherUserDevice)
          Distance = CalculateDistance(UserLocation, OtherUserLocation)
          IF Distance <= Event.TriggerParameters.distance:
            ExecuteEventAction(Event, UserDevice, OtherUserDevice)
      // Add other trigger types (time, condition)
```

**Example Use Cases:**

*   **Gamified Events:** When two players come within proximity, a mini-game is triggered.
*   **Contextual Advertising:** Displaying location-specific advertisements when a user approaches a point of interest.
*   **Automatic Check-ins:**  Automatically checking a user into a venue when they enter a geofence.
*   **Emergency Alerts:** Broadcasting emergency alerts to users within a specific area.
*   **Interactive Storytelling:** Triggering audio or visual cues as a user explores a location.
