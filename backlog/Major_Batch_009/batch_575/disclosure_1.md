## Adaptive Network Topology Prediction & Pre-emptive Routing

**Concept:** Leverage machine learning to predict network congestion *before* it manifests, and proactively adjust routing paths to avoid it. The existing patent focuses on *reacting* to congestion. This design aims to *predict* and *prevent* it, significantly reducing latency and improving overall network performance.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Modules:** Distributed agents deployed on edge devices (routers, switches, end-user devices). These agents continuously collect the following data:
    *   Round Trip Time (RTT) – measured as in the base patent.
    *   Packet Loss Rate – percentage of packets failing to reach their destination.
    *   Interface Utilization – percentage of bandwidth being used on each network interface.
    *   Queue Depth – number of packets queued on each interface.
    *   Time of Day/Week – cyclical patterns influence network usage.
    *   Application Type – categorize traffic to understand usage patterns (video streaming, gaming, etc.)
    *   Geographic Location – aggregate data to identify regional congestion hotspots.
*   **Centralized Prediction Engine:** A cloud-based machine learning model.
    *   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTMs excel at processing sequential data (network traffic patterns) and identifying long-term dependencies.
    *   **Training Data:** Historical network performance data collected from the data collection modules. The model is continuously retrained to adapt to changing network conditions.
    *   **Prediction Output:** A probability map indicating the likelihood of congestion on different network paths within a specified time window (e.g., next 5 minutes).
*   **Dynamic Routing Module:** Integrated with network routers and switches.
    *   **Input:** Congestion probability map from the prediction engine.
    *   **Algorithm:**  A modified version of the Dijkstra's algorithm, prioritizing paths with the lowest predicted congestion probability.  The algorithm incorporates a ‘risk factor’ based on the predicted congestion level.  Higher risk = lower priority.
    *   **Implementation:** Software Defined Networking (SDN) principles used to dynamically adjust routing tables in real-time.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitor the performance of dynamically adjusted routes.
    *   Collect RTT, packet loss, and utilization data.
    *   Feed this data back into the prediction engine to improve its accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Routing Module):**

```
function calculate_route(source, destination):
  // Get congestion probability map from prediction engine
  congestion_map = get_congestion_map()

  // Initialize routing table with all possible paths
  paths = find_all_paths(source, destination)

  // Calculate a ‘cost’ for each path, considering both traditional metrics (distance, bandwidth) and predicted congestion
  for each path in paths:
    cost = calculate_path_cost(path) + calculate_congestion_cost(path, congestion_map)

  // Select the path with the lowest cost
  best_path = select_lowest_cost_path(paths)

  // Update routing table with the best path
  update_routing_table(best_path)

  return best_path

function calculate_congestion_cost(path, congestion_map):
  total_congestion_cost = 0
  for each segment in path:
    // Get predicted congestion probability for this segment from the congestion map
    congestion_probability = congestion_map[segment]
    // Scale the congestion probability to create a cost value
    cost = congestion_probability * segment_weight
    total_congestion_cost += cost
  return total_congestion_cost
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Edge devices require sufficient processing power to run the data collection modules and communicate with the central prediction engine.
*   Network routers and switches need to support SDN protocols and have the capacity to handle dynamically adjusted routing tables.
*   The central prediction engine requires significant computing resources (e.g., cloud servers, GPUs) for training and running the machine learning model.
