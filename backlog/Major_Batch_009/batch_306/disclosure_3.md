## Temporal Data Sharding with Predictive Pre-Fetch

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Implement a data sharding strategy not based on key ranges, but on *time of creation/modification* coupled with a predictive pre-fetch mechanism. This allows for optimization assuming temporal locality of access.

**II. Data Sharding:**

*   Divide the data store into "time slices" – discrete periods (e.g., 1 hour, 1 day, configurable).
*   Each time slice constitutes a shard. Data objects are assigned to a shard based on their creation or last modification timestamp.
*   Shard assignment is deterministic – given a timestamp, the assigned shard is always the same.

**III. Predictive Pre-Fetch:**

*   **Access History Monitoring:**  The system continuously monitors access patterns to identify frequently accessed time slices.
*   **Prediction Algorithm:** Employ a time series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, LSTM) to predict future access patterns – which time slices will likely be accessed in the near future.
*   **Proactive Loading:**  Based on the prediction, proactively load data from the predicted time slices into a cache layer (in-memory or fast SSD).  The system should manage a 'confidence interval' to gauge the reliability of the prediction.  Higher confidence = more aggressive pre-loading.
*   **Eviction Policy:** Cache eviction policy prioritizes data from time slices predicted *not* to be accessed soon, and those with low confidence predictions.

**IV.  Metadata Management:**

*   A global metadata store maintains the mapping of timestamps to shards.  This metadata store needs to be highly available and scalable.
*   Each shard maintains its own local index for efficient object lookup *within* the shard.

**V.  API Integration:**

*   The API remains unchanged from the current system.  The sharding and pre-fetch logic operate transparently.
*   Introduce a new system metric: “Pre-Fetch Hit Rate” – percentage of requests served directly from the pre-fetch cache. This is a key performance indicator.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Pre-Fetch Logic):**

```
function predict_next_time_slices(access_history, prediction_horizon):
  // Use time series forecasting algorithm (e.g., ARIMA)
  predicted_slices = forecasting_algorithm(access_history, prediction_horizon)
  return predicted_slices

function load_data_into_cache(time_slices):
  for slice in time_slices:
    // Retrieve data from storage for the given time slice
    data = storage.get_data_for_slice(slice)
    cache.put_data(slice, data)

function handle_request(request):
  user_key = request.user_key
  timestamp = request.timestamp // Added timestamp to request
  slice = timestamp_to_slice(timestamp)

  if cache.contains(slice, user_key):
    // Cache Hit!
    return cache.get(slice, user_key)
  else:
    // Cache Miss
    data = storage.get(slice, user_key)
    cache.put(slice, user_key, data)
    return data
```

**VI.  Scalability & Fault Tolerance:**

*   Each time slice (shard) can be replicated across multiple storage nodes for redundancy and scalability.
*   A distributed consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) can be used to ensure consistency across replicas.
*   The metadata store should be highly available (e.g., using a distributed key-value store).
