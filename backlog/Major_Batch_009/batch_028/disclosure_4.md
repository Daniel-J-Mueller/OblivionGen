## Propeller Blade Resonance Dampening & Energy Harvesting System

**Concept:** Integrate piezoelectric materials within the propeller blade structure and utilize blade resonance – normally a source of stress and inefficiency – as a means of both dampening vibration *and* harvesting energy.

**Specifications:**

*   **Blade Core Material:** Carbon fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite with embedded piezoelectric fiber networks. These networks are densely packed along the leading and trailing edges, and also layered transversely across the blade's span.
*   **Piezoelectric Material:** Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) or equivalent high-performance piezoelectric ceramic fibers. Fiber diameter: 50-100 microns.
*   **Electrical System:**
    *   Each piezoelectric network connected to a micro-rectifier and voltage regulator circuit embedded within the blade root.
    *   Multiple blade roots wired in parallel to a central power management system (PMS) located within the propeller hub.
    *   PMS includes: DC-DC converters, charge controllers, battery storage (solid-state lithium-polymer), and data telemetry.
    *   Output: Regulated DC power for onboard systems (sensors, avionics, communications) or wireless power transmission.
*   **Resonance Tuning:** Implement micro-actuators (shape memory alloys or micro-servo motors) at strategic points along the blade span to slightly adjust blade stiffness and fine-tune resonance frequencies. Controlled via the PMS.
*   **Dampening Algorithm:** The PMS constantly monitors blade vibration using integrated accelerometers and strain gauges. It modulates the output of the micro-actuators to actively dampen harmful resonances and maximize energy harvesting.
*   **Blade Construction:** Incorporate a modular blade design. Piezoelectric networks and micro-actuators are assembled into independent “modules” that can be easily replaced or upgraded.
*   **Aerodynamic Profile:** Blade profile optimized for the specific application (e.g., aircraft, marine vessel, drone). Aerodynamic loads considered in piezoelectric network design.
*   **Sensor Suite:** Integrated blade health monitoring system including strain gauges, temperature sensors, and crack detection sensors. Data transmitted wirelessly to the PMS.

**Pseudocode – PMS Control Loop:**

```
loop:
    read_sensor_data() // Accelerometers, strain gauges, temperature
    calculate_resonance_frequency()
    calculate_dampening_required()
    calculate_energy_harvested()
    if (resonance_frequency > threshold) {
        adjust_micro_actuators(dampening_required)
    }
    store_energy(energy_harvested)
    transmit_data() // Blade health, power output
    delay(1ms)
end loop
```

**Refinement Notes:**

*   Investigate different piezoelectric materials and geometries to maximize energy conversion efficiency.
*   Develop advanced algorithms for real-time resonance detection and dampening.
*   Explore wireless power transmission technologies to minimize wiring complexity.
*   Optimize blade design for both aerodynamic performance and energy harvesting.
*   Address material fatigue and long-term reliability concerns.
