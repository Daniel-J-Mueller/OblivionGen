## Dynamic Order Consolidation & Robotic Swarm Delivery

**System Overview:** A multi-agent system integrating the existing unit-sortation with localized, dynamic order consolidation performed by a swarm of small, autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) operating *within* the sorting station itself. This eliminates the need for dedicated sorting bins or lanes for complete orders, drastically increasing throughput and flexibility.

**Core Innovation:** Instead of delivering *complete* orders to a final staging area, the system dynamically assembles orders *in-flight* using a swarm of AMRs. 

**Specifications:**

*   **AMR Fleet:** 100-500 small AMRs (approx. 30cm x 30cm x 20cm) with:
    *   Payload capacity: 1-2 kg.
    *   Top-down camera for item recognition.
    *   RFID/barcode scanner.
    *   Secure, recessed compartment for holding items.
    *   Wireless charging capability.
    *   Mesh network communication.
*   **Sorting Station Floor Plan:**  A large, open space with a grid-based flooring system (e.g., QR codes or Ultra-Wideband (UWB) beacons embedded in the floor) providing precise AMR positioning. No fixed bins or lanes.
*   **Control System Integration:** The existing control system interfaces with a new “Swarm Coordinator” module.
*   **Item Tracking:** Each item retains its unique identifier (from the existing system) throughout the process.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Unit Release:** The existing unit-sortation system delivers individual items on the conveyance mechanism to a designated "Swarm Release Zone" within the sorting station.
2.  **Swarm Assignment:** The Swarm Coordinator assigns each incoming item to an available AMR based on the AMR’s current task (completing an order) and proximity.
3.  **AMR Pickup:** The assigned AMR navigates to the Release Zone, scans the item’s identifier, and securely picks it up.
4.  **Order Assembly:** The AMR navigates to the designated "Delivery Point" for the order it is fulfilling.
5.  **Dynamic Route Optimization:** The Swarm Coordinator continuously optimizes AMR routes to avoid congestion and minimize travel time.  AMRs communicate with each other to share location and status information.
6.  **Order Completion & Dispatch:** Once an AMR has collected all items for a complete order, it navigates to a final dispatch station for packaging and shipment.
7.  **AMR Return & Re-assignment:** The AMR returns to the Swarm Release Zone or a charging station to await a new task.

**Pseudocode (Swarm Coordinator):**

```
FUNCTION assign_item(item_id, item_location):
  available_amrs = get_available_amrs()
  
  IF available_amrs is empty:
    queue_item(item_id) # Wait for AMR availability
    RETURN
  
  best_amr = select_best_amr(available_amrs, item_id)
  
  best_amr.add_item_to_task(item_id)
  best_amr.update_route()
  
  RETURN
  
FUNCTION select_best_amr(amr_list, item_id):
  # Criteria: Distance to item, Current task progress, Battery level
  # Use a weighted scoring system to rank AMRs
  
  scored_amrs = calculate_scores(amr_list, item_id)
  best_amr = sorted(scored_amrs, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[0][0]
  
  RETURN best_amr
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Increased Throughput:** Eliminates bottlenecks associated with fixed sorting bins.
*   **Scalability:** Easily adapt to changing order volumes by adding or removing AMRs.
*   **Flexibility:** Accommodate a wide variety of item sizes and shapes.
*   **Reduced Footprint:** Requires less floor space than traditional sorting systems.
*   **Resilience:** System can continue to operate even if some AMRs fail.
