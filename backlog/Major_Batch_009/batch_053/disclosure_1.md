## Dynamic Transaction Weaving with Predictive Dependency Resolution

**Concept:** Extend the dependency resolution concept to *predictively* weave transactions together, not just reactively call them based on discovered dependencies. This allows for simulating complex user journeys *before* they happen, preemptively loading necessary data and reducing latency.

**Specs:**

**1. Transaction Profile Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** Key-value store.
    *   Key: Transaction Method Name
    *   Value: Transaction Profile (see below)
*   **Transaction Profile:**
    *   `method_name`: String (e.g., "createUser")
    *   `dependencies`: List of Strings (Transaction Method Names)
    *   `data_requirements`: Dictionary (Key: Data Field, Value: Data Type) – Specifies what data this transaction *needs* to function.
    *   `predicted_next_transactions`: List of Strings (Transaction Method Names) – Probabilistic prediction of what transactions users are *likely* to perform next.  This is populated via machine learning analysis of historical user data. Weights assigned to each transaction in the list reflecting probability.
    *    `data_outputs`: Dictionary (Key: Data Field, Value: Data Type) – Specifies what data this transaction *produces*.
*   **Population:** Automatically built from source code annotations *and* continuously refined by machine learning algorithms monitoring live transaction flow.

**2. Predictive Transaction Scheduler:**

*   **Function:** Orchestrates the execution of transactions based on the Transaction Profile Database and real-time event streams.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Receive initial transaction request (e.g., user login).
    2.  Retrieve the Transaction Profile for the initial transaction.
    3.  Identify *immediate* dependencies and execute them.
    4.  *Simultaneously* evaluate `predicted_next_transactions`.
    5.  Initiate pre-fetching of data required by *likely* next transactions (using asynchronous calls).
    6.  Maintain a "transaction web" representing the active dependencies and predicted paths.
    7.  When a transaction completes, update the web and re-evaluate predictions.
    8.  If a predicted transaction becomes *highly probable* (confidence score > threshold), proactively execute it.

**3. Data Prefetching Mechanism:**

*   **Data Queue Enhancement:** Add a “priority” field to the data queue. Prefetched data gets higher priority.
*   **Asynchronous Calls:** Prefetching initiated via non-blocking calls.
*   **Data Validation:** Before using prefetched data, validate it against the current state of the system.  Discard stale data.

**4.  Transaction Web Visualization (Debugging/Monitoring):**

*   Real-time graph displaying the active transaction web.
*   Nodes represent transactions.
*   Edges represent dependencies and predicted paths.
*   Color-coding indicates transaction status (running, completed, failed).
*   Ability to drill down into individual transactions to view data inputs/outputs.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Transaction Scheduler):**

```
function scheduleTransaction(initialTransactionRequest):
  transactionProfile = getTransactionProfile(initialTransactionRequest.methodName)
  transactionWeb = createTransactionWeb(initialTransactionRequest)

  while transactionWeb.activeTransactions > 0:
    currentTransaction = selectNextTransaction(transactionWeb) // Prioritize based on dependencies & predictions

    if currentTransaction.isNew:
      transactionProfile = getTransactionProfile(currentTransaction.methodName)
      prefetchDependencies(transactionProfile.dependencies)

    executeTransaction(currentTransaction)

    updateTransactionWeb(currentTransaction)
    re-evaluatePredictions(transactionWeb)
```

**Novelty:** This extends dependency resolution from a reactive mechanism to a *proactive* one. By predicting future transactions, it allows for pre-fetching data and reducing latency, creating a more responsive and efficient system.  The combination of source code annotation with machine learning-driven prediction is key.  The visualization tool enables deeper understanding and optimization of complex transaction flows.
