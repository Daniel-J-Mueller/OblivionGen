**Dynamic Inventory 'Shadowing' & Predictive Disposition**

**Core Concept:** Extend the existing profitability assessment to incorporate a 'shadow inventory' – a virtual representation of future expected inventory based on order patterns, lead times, and probabilistic forecasting.  Couple this with a predictive disposition engine that doesn't just *react* to declining profitability, but *anticipates* it and proactively stages inventory for disposition *before* profitability drops below threshold.

**Specs:**

1.  **Shadow Inventory Creation Module:**
    *   Input: Historical sales data, current inventory levels, supplier lead times, order frequency distributions (for each SKU).
    *   Process:  Generate a probabilistic model of future inventory levels. This is *not* a simple reorder point calculation. It's a Monte Carlo simulation projecting inventory *distributions* over a defined time horizon (e.g., 3-6 months).
    *   Output:  A ‘shadow inventory’ dataset representing the *expected range* of inventory levels for each SKU at various points in the future.  This dataset is constantly updated as new sales data arrives.

2.  **Predictive Profitability Engine:**
    *   Input:  Current profitability data (as in the source patent), Shadow Inventory data, Cost of Capital (discount rate), Holding Cost (per unit, per time period), and a user-defined 'Profitability Decay Rate' (how quickly profitability is expected to decline if no action is taken).
    *   Process:
        *   For each SKU, project future profitability curves *across the range of possible inventory levels* (derived from Shadow Inventory).
        *   Calculate a ‘Time to Unprofitability’ (TTU) for each SKU. This is the point at which projected profitability drops below a user-defined threshold.
        *   Assign a ‘Disposition Priority Score’ (DPS) based on TTU, DPS = 1 / TTU.  Lower TTU = Higher DPS.
    *   Output:  A prioritized list of SKUs, ordered by DPS, indicating which items require proactive disposition planning.

3.  **Automated Disposition Staging Module:**
    *   Input: DPS List, Disposition Options (Liquidation, Discount, Promotion, Transfer to different location), Disposition Cost Estimates (for each option), and a user-defined ‘Staging Lead Time’ (how far in advance to start preparing for disposition).
    *   Process:
        *   For SKUs with high DPS (above a threshold), *automatically* trigger the staging of disposition activities.
        *   This staging includes:
            *   Generating liquidation requests.
            *   Creating discount codes.
            *   Scheduling promotional campaigns.
            *   Initiating transfer orders.
        *   Monitor the execution of disposition activities and adjust strategies based on real-time results.
    *   Output: Disposition Work Orders, Automated price changes, scheduled promotional communications.

**Pseudocode (Simplified):**

```
FOR EACH SKU:
    Calculate Shadow Inventory (Monte Carlo simulation)
    Project Future Profitability (using Shadow Inventory data)
    Calculate Time to Unprofitability (TTU)
    Calculate Disposition Priority Score (DPS) = 1 / TTU
    IF DPS > Threshold:
        Initiate Disposition Staging (Liquidation, Discount, Promotion)
        Monitor Execution
```

**Novelty:**

This system doesn't just react to declining profitability. It proactively anticipates it using probabilistic forecasting and automated staging. The ‘Shadow Inventory’ is a key differentiator, providing a much more nuanced understanding of future inventory risk than traditional reorder point systems.  It’s a shift from ‘firefighting’ to ‘preventative maintenance’ for inventory.
