**Personalized Gifting Anticipation & Proactive Procurement System**

**Concept:** Extend the inferred recurring gift-giving event detection to *anticipate* gift needs *before* a traditional purchase cycle begins, and proactively offer procurement options to the affiliated user. This moves beyond simply reminding someone about a birthday/holiday and into a predictive, assistance-based system.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   Gift Transaction Data (as in the provided patent)
    *   Wish List Data
    *   Social Media Activity (public posts mentioning needs, desires, hobbies - opt-in required)
    *   Calendar Integration (optional, user-authorized access) – identifies potential gifting occasions beyond birthdays/holidays (e.g., housewarming, promotions).
    *   Product Browsing History (user's own browsing data - opt-in).
*   **AI Engine:**
    *   **Need/Want Inference Module:** Analyzes combined data streams to identify potential gifts *before* they are explicitly added to a wish list.  Uses NLP to interpret social media posts and identify needs/desires. 
    *   **Proactive Prediction Model:** Predicts gift categories and price ranges based on historical data, social signals, and inferred needs.  Considers seasonality, trends, and the recipient’s evolving interests.
    *   **Procurement Option Generator:** Identifies available products matching predicted gift criteria.  Considers user preferences for vendors, price points, and ethical sourcing.
*   **User Interface (Affiliated User – Gifter):**
    *   **“Gifting Insights” Dashboard:** Presents a prioritized list of potential upcoming gifting occasions for their affiliated contacts.
    *   **“Suggested Gifts” Section:** Displays curated product recommendations for each contact, with price comparisons and vendor options.
    *   **“Proactive Procurement” Feature:**  Allows users to pre-purchase gifts and schedule delivery. Option to wrap and include a message.
    *   **“Needs/Want Alerts:**  Notifies the user when a significant inferred need/want is detected for an affiliated contact.
*   **User Interface (Recipient):**
    *   Opt-in settings to control the level of data shared and the types of suggestions received.
    *   Ability to provide feedback on suggested gifts to refine the accuracy of the prediction model.

**Pseudocode (Affiliated User - Gifter):**

```
FUNCTION GetGiftingInsights(user_id):
  insights = []
  contacts = GetAffiliatedContacts(user_id)
  FOR contact IN contacts:
    upcoming_events = GetUpcomingEvents(contact)
    predicted_needs = PredictNeeds(contact) //AI engine call
    IF upcoming_events OR predicted_needs:
      insight = {
        "contact_id": contact.id,
        "event_type": upcoming_events.type,
        "predicted_needs": predicted_needs,
        "suggested_gifts": GetSuggestedGifts(contact, predicted_needs) //AI Engine + Product Catalog Query
      }
      insights.append(insight)
  RETURN insights

FUNCTION GetSuggestedGifts(contact_id, predicted_needs):
    gifts = AI_Engine.GenerateGiftRecommendations(contact_id, predicted_needs)
    filtered_gifts = FilterGifts(gifts, user_preferences) //Price, Vendor, Ethics
    RETURN filtered_gifts
```

**Novelty:** Moves beyond reactive gift reminders to a proactive, predictive, and assistance-based gifting system. Integrates broader data sources (social media, calendar) and AI-driven need/want inference to provide more relevant and timely gift suggestions.  Focuses on *anticipating* needs rather than simply responding to expressed desires.
