## Adaptive Session "Shadowing" for Proactive Threat Modeling

**Concept:** Expand the notion of "emulation session data" beyond simply preventing malicious actions *during* a compromise, to actively building a continuously updated behavioral model of legitimate user sessions *before* any compromise occurs. This model is then used to proactively identify anomalies *before* they escalate into full-blown attacks, essentially "shadowing" the user's typical behavior.

**Specifications:**

**1. Session Profiling Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Capture detailed session data beyond typical request logs. Include:
    *   Keystroke dynamics (timing, pressure - if available through device API)
    *   Mouse movement patterns (speed, acceleration, common paths)
    *   Scroll behavior (speed, areas focused on)
    *   Time spent on each page element (using client-side JavaScript tracking)
    *   Device fingerprinting (browser, OS, hardware - continuously updated)
    *   Network characteristics (latency, bandwidth fluctuations)
*   **Data Normalization:** Standardize data across different users and devices to enable meaningful comparison. Implement statistical techniques to account for natural variations.
*   **Model Creation:** Utilize machine learning (e.g., Hidden Markov Models, Long Short-Term Memory networks) to build a probabilistic model of each user's typical session behavior.  Models should be dynamically updated with each session.
*   **Profile Storage:** Store session profiles securely, with appropriate access controls. Consider differential privacy techniques to protect user data.

**2. Anomaly Detection Engine:**

*   **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously monitor incoming requests and compare them against the user's established session profile.
*   **Deviation Scoring:** Assign a deviation score to each request based on the degree to which it deviates from the expected behavior.  Combine multiple deviation metrics (keystroke dynamics, mouse movement, network characteristics, etc.) into a single score.
*   **Adaptive Thresholding:** Dynamically adjust the anomaly detection threshold based on the user's history and the context of the session.  Avoid false positives by accounting for legitimate variations in behavior.
*   **Contextual Analysis:** Consider the broader context of the session (e.g., time of day, location, recent activity) when evaluating anomalies.

**3.  Predictive Mitigation System:**

*   **Pre-Compromise Alerts:** Generate alerts when the deviation score exceeds a predetermined threshold *before* any malicious activity is detected.
*   **Adaptive Authentication:** Trigger additional authentication steps (e.g., multi-factor authentication) when anomalies are detected.
*   **Session Freezing/Limiting:**  Temporarily freeze or limit the user's access to sensitive data or functionality when high-risk anomalies are detected.
*   **Automated Threat Modeling:**  Use the detected anomalies to automatically generate hypotheses about potential attack vectors and vulnerabilities.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Engine):**

```
function detectAnomaly(request):
  profile = getSessionProfile(request.sessionId)
  if profile == null:
    return false // First session, no profile yet

  deviationScore = calculateDeviationScore(request, profile)

  if deviationScore > adaptiveThreshold(request.sessionId):
    logAnomaly(request, deviationScore)
    triggerMitigation(request)
    return true // Anomaly detected

  return false // No anomaly detected
```

**Data Flow:**

1.  Client interacts with web application.
2.  All session data is captured and sent to the Session Profiling Module.
3.  Session Profiling Module builds and updates the user's session profile.
4.  The Anomaly Detection Engine continuously monitors incoming requests.
5.  The Anomaly Detection Engine compares each request against the userâ€™s session profile.
6.  If an anomaly is detected, the Predictive Mitigation System is triggered.
7.  Alerts are generated, and automated mitigation measures are taken.
