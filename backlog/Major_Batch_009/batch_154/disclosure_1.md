## Dynamic Attribute Inheritance for Multi-Tiered Networks

**Specification:** A system for propagating and inheriting network attributes across multiple network tiers (e.g., data center fabrics, WANs, cloud interconnects) using a modified version of the attribute/prefix separation concept. This extends beyond simple routing updates to encompass Quality of Service (QoS), security policies, and performance characteristics.

**Core Concept:** Instead of solely focusing on prefix-attribute association, introduce the concept of *Attribute Chains*.  An Attribute Chain is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where nodes represent attribute sets and edges represent inheritance/modification rules.

**Components:**

1.  **Attribute Node:**  Contains a set of attributes (e.g., QoS priority, security level, bandwidth allocation).  Each node has a unique identifier.
2.  **Inheritance Edge:**  A directed edge from Node A to Node B, indicating that Node B *inherits* attributes from Node A. Inheritance can be *complete* (all attributes copied) or *selective* (specified attributes copied). Selective inheritance can also include *transformations* (e.g., increasing QoS priority, adding a security tag).
3.  **Prefix Binding:** Prefixes are bound to *root* Attribute Nodes within the Attribute Chain.  This establishes the initial attribute context for the prefix.
4.  **Tiered Propagation:** Each network tier maintains a partial view of the global Attribute Chain. Tiers only need to store and propagate Attribute Nodes that are relevant to their scope.

**Operation:**

1.  A source network tier initiates a flow with a specific prefix. This prefix is bound to a root Attribute Node within that tier's Attribute Chain.
2.  As the flow traverses network tiers, each tier determines which attributes are relevant to its policies and propagates those attributes along the path.
3.  Tiers can *add* new attributes or *modify* existing ones along the path, creating new Attribute Nodes and linking them to the existing chain.
4.  Each tier uses the inherited attributes to make forwarding and policy decisions.
5.  Attribute Chain updates are propagated in a similar fashion, allowing for dynamic policy adjustments.

**Pseudocode (Update Propagation):**

```
function propagateAttributeUpdate(tier, attributeNodeId, newAttributes) {
  // 1. Retrieve the current attribute node
  currentNode = tier.getAttributeNode(attributeNodeId);

  // 2. Create a new attribute node if the update is significant
  if (currentNode.attributes != newAttributes) {
    newNodeId = tier.createAttributeNode(newAttributes);
    tier.linkAttributeNodes(currentNode.id, newNodeId); //Inheritance edge
  }

  // 3. Propagate the update to neighboring tiers (if applicable)
  for (neighborTier in tier.neighbors) {
    neighborTier.receiveAttributeUpdate(tier, newNodeId);
  }
}

function receiveAttributeUpdate(sourceTier, newNodeId) {
  // 1. Check if the new node is already known
  if (!knownAttributeNode(newNodeId)) {
    // 2. Add the new node to the local cache
    addAttributeNode(newNodeId);

    // 3. Propagate the update to neighboring tiers
    for (neighborTier in neighbors) {
      neighborTier.receiveAttributeUpdate(this, newNodeId);
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits:**

*   **Granular Control:** Allows for fine-grained control over network policies at each tier.
*   **Scalability:**  Reduces the amount of state that each tier needs to maintain.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Enables rapid adaptation to changing network conditions.
*   **Simplified Management:**  Centralized policy definition with distributed enforcement.

**Potential Applications:**

*   **SD-WAN:**  Dynamic traffic steering based on application requirements and network conditions.
*   **Cloud Interconnect:**  Seamless integration of cloud services with consistent policy enforcement.
*   **Data Center Fabrics:**  Optimized resource allocation and traffic management.
