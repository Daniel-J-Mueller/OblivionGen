## Temporal Data Weaving with Multi-Dimensional Keys

**Concept:** Expand the key-value pair storage beyond simple sequential node numbering to incorporate multi-dimensional keys representing *relationships* between events. This creates a "woven" temporal graph rather than a linear chain, allowing for more nuanced data analysis and querying.

**Specifications:**

**1. Key Structure:**

*   **Base Key:** `[ChainID, Timestamp]` – Identifies the chain and event time.
*   **Relationship Keys:** `[ChainID, Timestamp, RelationshipType, TargetChainID, TargetTimestamp]` – Defines relationships *to other events* (within the same chain or different chains). `RelationshipType` can be predefined (e.g., “caused”, “inhibited”, “correlated”, “followed_by”) or custom.  `TargetChainID` and `TargetTimestamp` point to the related event.

**2. Data Storage:**

*   Key-value store remains the base.  Each event (a set of data representing a state) is stored under both the Base Key and potentially multiple Relationship Keys.
*   Event data includes metadata to describe the event, and any payloads the event requires.
*   A separate indexing layer (Bloom filter, or similar) maintains a fast lookup of all Relationship Keys associated with a given event (identified by its Base Key).

**3. Querying:**

*   **Temporal Queries:**  Standard time-based queries remain functional, using the Timestamp component of the Base Key.
*   **Relational Queries:**  New query syntax to traverse relationships.  Example: “Find all events that *caused* event X at time T”.  This query uses the indexing layer to find all events with a Relationship Key pointing *to* event X at time T with `RelationshipType = “caused”`.
*   **Pattern Matching:** Implement a query language that allows specifying patterns of relationships between events.  Example: “Find all chains where event A is followed by event B within 5 minutes, and event B *caused* event C”.

**4.  Data Weaving Algorithm (Pseudocode):**

```
function weave_event(event_data, chain_id, timestamp, relationships):
    // Store event under Base Key
    base_key = [chain_id, timestamp]
    store(base_key, event_data)

    // Store event under Relationship Keys
    for relationship in relationships:
        relationship_type = relationship.type
        target_chain_id = relationship.target_chain_id
        target_timestamp = relationship.target_timestamp
        relationship_key = [chain_id, timestamp, relationship_type, target_chain_id, target_timestamp]
        store(relationship_key, event_data) // or a pointer to the event data

    // Update Index: Add relationship keys to the index for quick retrieval
    update_index(relationship_key, base_key)
end function

function query_relationships(base_key, relationship_type, time_range):
    // Retrieve relevant relationship keys using the index.
    related_keys = index.get(relationship_type, time_range)

    // Fetch event data associated with the keys.
    related_events = fetch_data(related_keys)

    return related_events
end function
```

**5.  Tail Management (Adaptation):**

*   The “tail” concept is extended.  Instead of simply pointing to the oldest node for physical deletion, the tail can also indicate "dangling" relationships - relationships pointing to events that have been fully deleted.
*   A separate garbage collection process periodically resolves dangling relationships or marks them for historical analysis.

**Innovation Rationale:**  This system moves beyond a simple chronological log to a dynamic network of events. It allows for complex event correlation, anomaly detection, and a richer understanding of temporal data. The key-value storage remains efficient, while the relational layer unlocks new analytical capabilities.
