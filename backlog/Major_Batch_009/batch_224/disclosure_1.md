## Adaptive Reputation System for Network Traffic Prioritization

**Concept:** Integrate a dynamic reputation system directly into network infrastructure to proactively prioritize legitimate traffic during potential DDoS events, rather than reactively limiting suspected malicious sources. This builds upon the idea of observing traffic patterns, but moves towards *incentivizing* good behavior and rewarding established, reliable sources.

**Specs:**

*   **Reputation Score (RS):** Each network source (identified by IP address/port combination) is assigned a continuously updated RS, initialized to a neutral value (e.g., 50).
*   **Behavioral Metrics:** RS is influenced by the following:
    *   **Packet Inter-Arrival Time (IAT):** Consistent, reasonable IATs increase RS. Highly variable or excessively rapid IATs decrease RS.
    *   **TCP Handshake Completion Rate:**  High completion rates increase RS.  Failed/incomplete handshakes decrease RS.
    *   **Application Layer Validation:** Successful validation of application layer protocols (e.g., HTTP GET requests with valid headers) increase RS. Invalid requests decrease RS.
    *   **Historical Data:**  Long-term positive behavior increases RS more significantly than short-term bursts.  Repeated negative behavior leads to a steeper RS decrease.
    *   **Content Analysis (Optional):**  For certain protocols (e.g., HTTP), analyze content for indicators of legitimacy (e.g., valid user agent strings, reasonable request sizes).  This is more computationally intensive and should be configurable.
*   **RS Adjustment Algorithm:**
    ```
    RS_new = RS_old + (IAT_score + Handshake_score + App_score + History_score) * Adjustment_Factor
    ```
    *   `Adjustment_Factor`: A configurable parameter controlling the sensitivity of RS changes.
    *   Each score (IAT, Handshake, App, History) is normalized between -1 and 1.
*   **Traffic Prioritization:**
    *   **Quality of Service (QoS) Queues:** Network devices utilize QoS queues based on RS.
        *   RS > 80: Highest priority queue (minimal latency).
        *   RS 60-80: Medium priority queue.
        *   RS < 60: Low priority queue. Potential rate limiting for sustained low scores.
    *   **Adaptive Rate Limiting:** For sources with consistently low RS, dynamically adjust rate limits based on RS level.
*   **Sybil Attack Mitigation:**
    *   **RS Decay:** RS gradually decays over time if no traffic is observed.
    *   **IP Reputation Databases:** Integrate with external IP reputation databases to identify known malicious actors.
    *   **Behavioral Clustering:**  Detect groups of sources exhibiting similar negative behavior.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   Software: Implement as a software module within network devices (routers, switches, firewalls).
    *   Hardware Acceleration: Utilize hardware acceleration (e.g., FPGA) for computationally intensive tasks (e.g., packet analysis, RS calculation).
    *   Monitoring and Logging: Provide detailed monitoring and logging of RS changes, traffic prioritization, and potential attacks.
*   **Pseudocode - RS Update:**
```
function update_reputation(source_ip, packet):
  iat_score = calculate_iat_score(packet)
  handshake_score = calculate_handshake_score(packet)
  app_score = calculate_app_score(packet)
  history_score = get_history_score(source_ip)

  rs = get_reputation(source_ip)
  rs = rs + (iat_score + handshake_score + app_score + history_score) * adjustment_factor

  #Clamp RS between 0 and 100
  rs = max(0, min(100, rs))
  set_reputation(source_ip, rs)
  apply_qos_policy(source_ip, rs)
end function
