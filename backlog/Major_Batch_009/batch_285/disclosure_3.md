## Adaptive Edge Resource Allocation via Predictive Handover & Dynamic Application Partitioning

**System Overview:**

This system builds upon the patent's core concept of mobile device handover between edge devices, but extends it with predictive handover capabilities & dynamic application partitioning to maximize resource utilization and user experience. The core innovation is a resource allocation engine that *proactively* shifts application components based on predicted mobility & edge capacity.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Mobility Prediction Engine:**
    *   **Data Sources:** GPS data from mobile devices, historical movement patterns (aggregated & anonymized), real-time network congestion data, time of day, day of week, event schedules (e.g., concerts, sporting events).
    *   **Algorithm:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, trained on the aggregated mobility data. Output: Probability distribution of the mobile device’s location at *t+n* minutes, where *n* is a configurable prediction horizon.
    *   **Output:** A “heat map” of likely future locations for each mobile device, with associated confidence levels.

2.  **Edge Capacity Monitoring:**
    *   **Metrics:** CPU utilization, memory usage, network bandwidth, application latency, number of active connections.
    *   **Collection Frequency:** 5-second intervals.
    *   **Aggregation:** Distributed aggregation across all edge devices. Centralized monitoring dashboard for system administrators.

3.  **Application Partitioning Framework:**
    *   **Application Decomposition:** Applications are designed (or dynamically analyzed) to be decomposable into modular components (e.g., UI, business logic, data access).
    *   **Component Mapping:** A policy engine determines the optimal mapping of application components to edge devices based on:
        *   Component resource requirements.
        *   Edge device capacity.
        *   Predicted mobility (to minimize handover disruption).
        *   Network latency between edge devices.
    *   **Communication Protocol:** gRPC with Protocol Buffers for efficient inter-component communication.

4.  **Dynamic Resource Allocation Engine:**

```pseudocode
function allocateResources(mobileDevice, application) {
  // 1. Predict mobile device’s future location
  predictedLocations = mobilityPredictionEngine.predict(mobileDevice)

  // 2. Evaluate edge device capacity
  edgeDeviceStats = edgeCapacityMonitoring.getStats()

  // 3. Determine optimal component mapping
  componentMapping = policyEngine.mapComponents(application, predictedLocations, edgeDeviceStats)

  // 4. Migrate components (if necessary)
  if (componentMapping != currentMapping) {
    migrateComponents(currentMapping, componentMapping)
    currentMapping = componentMapping
  }

  // 5. Monitor performance & adjust mapping
  monitorPerformance(mobileDevice, application, currentMapping)
}

function migrateComponents(oldMapping, newMapping) {
  for each component in oldMapping {
    stopComponent(component)
    transferState(component, newMapping[component])
    startComponent(newMapping[component])
  }
}

function transferState(oldComponent, newComponent) {
  // Serialize session state (e.g., user data, in-memory caches)
  serializedState = serializeSessionState(oldComponent)
  // Transfer serialized state to new component
  transferData(serializedState, newComponent)
  // Deserialize session state
  deserializeSessionState(newComponent, serializedState)
}
```

5.  **Handover Optimization:**
    *   **Pre-fetching:** During predicted handover, pre-fetch critical application data to the target edge device.
    *   **Session Replication:** Replicate application session state to the target edge device *before* the handover occurs.
    *   **Seamless Switchover:** Ensure a seamless switchover to the target edge device without interrupting the user experience.

6.  **Policy Engine Configuration:**
    *   **Resource Priority:** Define priorities for different application components.
    *   **Latency Constraints:** Set maximum acceptable latency for critical components.
    *   **Geographic Restrictions:** Enforce geographic restrictions on application usage.
    *   **Security Policies:** Implement security policies to protect sensitive data.
