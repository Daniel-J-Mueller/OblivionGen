## Dynamic Microservice Composition via Predicted Dependency Shifts

**Concept:** Extend the isolated node detection to *predict* future dependency shifts and proactively compose microservices based on those predictions. Rather than simply extracting existing isolated nodes, this system anticipates *where* isolation will be beneficial and creates microservices *before* refactoring is strictly necessary, minimizing disruption.

**Specs:**

*   **Component:** Predictive Dependency Analysis Module
*   **Input:** Source code/bytecode, runtime metrics (as per existing patent), historical code change data (version control logs).
*   **Process:**
    1.  **Dependency Graph Construction:** Build a dependency graph of the application, similar to the existing system.
    2.  **Historical Pattern Identification:** Analyze historical code changes to identify patterns of dependency shifts.  For example: "Component X's dependency on Component Y typically decreases after feature release Z." Utilize time-series analysis and potentially machine learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to model these patterns.
    3.  **Dependency Shift Prediction:**  Based on the current state of the application, recent changes, and historical patterns, predict which dependencies are likely to weaken or disappear in the near future. Assign a "decoupling score" to each dependency, representing the likelihood of future isolation.
    4.  **Proactive Microservice Candidate Identification:** Identify components that are likely to become isolated *based on the decoupling score*.  This goes beyond current isolated node detection; it looks at *potential* isolation.
    5.  **Microservice Blueprint Generation:**  Automatically generate a blueprint for a new microservice based on the candidate component. This includes defining the API contract, data schemas, and initial configuration.
    6.  **Staged Deployment & A/B Testing:** Deploy the newly created microservice in a staged environment alongside the monolith. Route a small percentage of traffic to the new microservice and compare its performance and behavior to the monolith.
    7.  **Dynamic Routing Adjustment:** Based on the A/B testing results, dynamically adjust the routing rules to increase or decrease the traffic to the new microservice.
    8.  **Continuous Monitoring & Refinement:** Continuously monitor the performance of the new microservice and refine its API contract and data schemas based on real-world usage.

*   **Data Structures:**
    *   `DependencyGraphNode`: Represents an application component. Attributes: `componentName`, `dependencies` (list of `DependencyGraphNode`), `decouplingScore`.
    *   `HistoricalChangeLog`: Stores records of code changes with timestamps, affected components, and dependency modifications.

*   **Pseudocode (Core Logic):**

```pseudocode
function predict_microservice_candidates(source_code, runtime_metrics, change_log):
  graph = build_dependency_graph(source_code)
  for node in graph.nodes:
    node.decoupling_score = calculate_decoupling_score(node, runtime_metrics, change_log)

  candidate_nodes = filter_nodes_by_decoupling_score(graph.nodes, threshold=0.7) # Adjust threshold

  return candidate_nodes

function calculate_decoupling_score(node, runtime_metrics, change_log):
  # Combine runtime metrics (e.g., low utilization, minimal cross-component calls)
  runtime_score = calculate_runtime_score(node, runtime_metrics)
  # Analyze historical change log for dependency weakening trends
  history_score = analyze_change_log(node, change_log)
  # Combine scores with weighted averaging
  decoupling_score = (0.6 * history_score) + (0.4 * runtime_score)
  return decoupling_score
```

*   **UI Enhancements:**
    *   Display predicted decoupling scores on the dependency graph.
    *   Allow users to configure the weighting of runtime metrics and historical data.
    *   Visualize the potential benefits of extracting a microservice (e.g., reduced deployment time, improved scalability).
