## Adaptive Phantom Load System for Grid Stability

**Concept:** Extend the 'load injection' aspect of the patent beyond simple signature creation and into an active grid stabilization system. Instead of *measuring* the response to a load, dynamically *inject* a precisely calculated phantom load to counteract grid fluctuations and improve power quality.

**Specifications:**

**1. Hardware Components:**

*   **Smart Plug Unit:** Housing containing all electronics. Similar physical form factor to existing plug-in energy sensors.
*   **Microcontroller (MCU):** High-speed MCU (e.g., ARM Cortex-M7) for real-time processing.
*   **Analog Front-End (AFE):** High-resolution, multi-channel AFE to precisely measure voltage and current on all phases (Line, Neutral, Ground).  Must handle fast transient events.
*   **Programmable AC Load:** Solid-state AC load capable of dynamically adjusting resistance, inductance, and capacitance (R, L, C).  Utilize IGBTs or similar high-power switching devices. Minimum 10A continuous, 20A peak.
*   **Communication Module:** Wi-Fi/Bluetooth module for communication with a central control system/cloud.
*   **Power Supply:** Robust power supply to handle wide voltage ranges and transient spikes.
*   **Isolation Barrier:** Galvanic isolation between AC mains and control circuitry for safety.

**2. Software & Algorithms:**

*   **Real-Time Grid Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of voltage and current waveforms.  Employ Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for harmonic analysis and identification of voltage sags/swells.
*   **Predictive Algorithm:** Utilize a predictive model (e.g., Kalman Filter, Recurrent Neural Network) trained on historical grid data to anticipate voltage fluctuations *before* they occur.
*   **Phantom Load Calculation:** Based on the predictive model, calculate the optimal R, L, and C values to inject a phantom load that counteracts the predicted voltage fluctuation. This load should be *precisely* timed and scaled to minimize impact on connected appliances while maximizing grid stabilization.
*   **Adaptive Control Loop:** Implement an adaptive control loop that continuously adjusts the phantom load based on real-time grid measurements and feedback.
*   **Distributed Coordination:** Multiple Smart Plug Units should communicate with each other and a central control system to coordinate their phantom load injection and maximize grid-wide stability.  Employ a consensus algorithm (e.g., Raft, Paxos) to ensure robust and reliable coordination.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Algorithms to detect unusual or malicious grid behavior (e.g., cyberattacks) and trigger appropriate safety measures.
*    **Signature Matching Module:** Retain the ability to generate the signature data of devices, and feed this into the coordination and anomaly detection modules.

**3. Operational Modes:**

*   **Stabilization Mode:** Continuously monitor and stabilize the grid voltage.
*   **Signature Learning Mode:** Learn the signature of connected devices.
*   **Diagnostic Mode:** Run self-tests and report any hardware/software issues.
*    **Bypass Mode:** Disable phantom load injection for direct power delivery.

**4. Pseudocode (simplified):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // 1. Measure Voltage & Current
  voltage = readVoltage();
  current = readCurrent();

  // 2. Predict Future Voltage
  predictedVoltage = predictVoltage(voltage, current);

  // 3. Calculate Phantom Load
  phantomLoad = calculatePhantomLoad(predictedVoltage);

  // 4. Inject Phantom Load
  injectPhantomLoad(phantomLoad);

  // 5. Analyze Signature Data
  signatureData = analyzeDeviceSignature();

  // 6. Transmit Data to Cloud (optional)
  transmitData(voltage, current, phantomLoad, signatureData);
}

//Function to determine phantom load
function calculatePhantomLoad(predictedVoltage){
    error = targetVoltage - predictedVoltage;
    R = Kp * error; //Proportional Control
    L = Ki * error; //Integral Control
    C = Kd * error; //Derivative Control
    return (R, L, C);
}

```

**5. Future Considerations:**

*   Integration with smart grid infrastructure (e.g., IEEE 2030.5).
*   Development of advanced control algorithms (e.g., Model Predictive Control).
*   Implementation of machine learning techniques for improved prediction and control.
*   Exploration of distributed energy storage integration.
