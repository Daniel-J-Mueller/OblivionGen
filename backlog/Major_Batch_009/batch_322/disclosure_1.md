## Adaptive Spatial Audio Beaconing

**Concept:** Augment the acoustic echo cancellation system with a spatial audio beaconing system to preemptively identify and mitigate echo before it occurs, leveraging multiple microphones and directional audio transmission. This shifts the approach from *reacting* to echo to *preventing* it.

**Specs:**

*   **Microphone Array:** Integrate a circular array of six high-sensitivity microphones around the audio device. Microphone placement should prioritize capturing a 360-degree soundscape.
*   **Directional Audio Transmission:** Equip the wireless loudspeaker with an array of small, digitally controlled directional speakers. These speakers can focus audio towards specific locations.
*   **Spatial Localization Engine:** Develop a real-time spatial localization engine. This engine uses the microphone array to identify the location of sound sources (e.g., human voice, other audio sources) within the environment. It will output coordinates (azimuth, elevation, distance) for each identified sound source.
*   **Echo Prediction Algorithm:**  A core algorithm that predicts potential echo pathways.  This takes into account the spatial location of sound sources, the geometry of the room (user-defined or estimated via ultrasonic sensors, see 'Room Mapping' below), and the direction of audio transmission from the loudspeaker. The algorithm calculates the expected time of arrival for reflected sound waves (echoes).
*   **Preemptive Beamforming:**  Before audio is played from the loudspeaker, the system calculates the optimal beamforming parameters for the directional speakers.  This focuses the audio towards the intended listener, minimizing reflections off walls and other surfaces.
*   **Dynamic Echo Cancellation Adjustment:**  The AEC component remains active, but its aggressiveness is dynamically adjusted based on the output of the Echo Prediction Algorithm and the effectiveness of the Preemptive Beamforming.  If the system successfully minimizes reflections, the AEC can operate at a lower level, reducing distortion.
*   **Room Mapping (Optional):** Incorporate ultrasonic sensors (or utilize camera-based 3D reconstruction) to create a basic 3D map of the room.  This improves the accuracy of the Echo Prediction Algorithm and allows for more sophisticated beamforming.
*   **User Interface:** A simple user interface to calibrate the microphone array, define the listening zone, and adjust the sensitivity of the system.

**Pseudocode (Echo Prediction & Beamforming):**

```pseudocode
// Global Variables
roomMap: 3D map of room (optional)
microphoneArrayData: Data from microphone array
audioSourceLocation: Location of audio source (determined by spatial localization)
listenerLocation: Defined listening zone

// Function: PredictEchoPathways()
function PredictEchoPathways(audioSourceLocation, listenerLocation, roomMap) {
    // Calculate potential reflection points based on audioSourceLocation, listenerLocation, and roomMap
    reflectionPoints = CalculateReflectionPoints(audioSourceLocation, listenerLocation, roomMap)

    // Calculate the expected time of arrival for echoes from each reflection point
    echoArrivalTimes = CalculateEchoArrivalTimes(reflectionPoints)

    return echoArrivalTimes
}

// Function: CalculateBeamformingParameters()
function CalculateBeamformingParameters(audioSourceLocation, listenerLocation, echoArrivalTimes) {
    // Determine the optimal beamforming parameters to focus audio towards the listener
    // and minimize reflections from the calculated echo pathways

    beamformingParameters = OptimizeBeamforming(audioSourceLocation, listenerLocation, echoArrivalTimes)

    return beamformingParameters
}

// Main Loop
while (audioPlaying) {
    // Get audio data
    audioData = GetAudioData()

    // Perform spatial localization to determine audio source location
    audioSourceLocation = PerformSpatialLocalization(microphoneArrayData)

    // Predict echo pathways
    echoArrivalTimes = PredictEchoPathways(audioSourceLocation, listenerLocation, roomMap)

    // Calculate beamforming parameters
    beamformingParameters = CalculateBeamformingParameters(audioSourceLocation, listenerLocation, echoArrivalTimes)

    // Apply beamforming to audio data
    beamformedAudio = ApplyBeamforming(audioData, beamformingParameters)

    // Send beamformed audio to loudspeaker
    SendAudioToLoudspeaker(beamformedAudio)

    // Update microphone array data
    microphoneArrayData = GetMicrophoneArrayData()
}
```

This system aims to *proactively* shape the audio environment, reducing the need for aggressive post-processing via acoustic echo cancellation, resulting in a cleaner, more natural audio experience. The spatial component introduces a level of intelligence beyond traditional AEC systems.
