## Dynamic Resource Prediction & Prefetching

**Specification:** A system for predicting resource needs *before* a request is fully processed, and proactively prefetching consolidated resources based on predicted need and network conditions. This builds on the consolidation idea, but flips the timing – instead of optimizing *after* a request, it anticipates *before*.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Profiler:** Monitors client request patterns – not just the resources *in* a request, but the *sequence* of requests.  Tracks common sequences (e.g., page A -> page B -> component C).  Uses Markov models or similar techniques to predict the next likely resource need.

2.  **Network Condition Monitor:** Continuously assesses network latency, bandwidth, and packet loss to the client.  This isn’t a global metric, but a per-client measurement.

3.  **Prediction Engine:** Combines the Behavioral Profiler's predictions with the Network Condition Monitor's data.  This engine calculates a “Prefetch Score” – a value representing the likelihood that a resource will be needed soon, *and* that prefetching it will actually improve performance.

4.  **Prefetch Coordinator:** Based on the Prefetch Score, the Coordinator initiates the prefetching of consolidated resource bundles.  It utilizes the consolidation techniques outlined in the referenced patent, but proactively. It can also dynamically adjust the degree of consolidation (e.g., prefetch larger bundles if bandwidth is high, smaller bundles if latency is high).

5.  **Cache & Prioritization:** A tiered caching system. Prefetched resources are stored in a fast, local cache. The system prioritizes prefetching based on a combination of the Prefetch Score and the resource's size (smaller, high-probability resources are prioritized).

**Pseudocode (Prediction Engine):**

```
function calculatePrefetchScore(client_id, resource_id):
  behavioral_probability = getBehavioralProbability(client_id, resource_id)
  network_latency = getNetworkLatency(client_id)
  network_bandwidth = getNetworkBandwidth(client_id)
  resource_size = getResourceSize(resource_id)

  //Weighting factors - tunable parameters
  behavior_weight = 0.6
  network_weight = 0.4

  //Combine the data to produce a score, scaling appropriately
  prefetch_score = (behavior_weight * behavioral_probability) + (network_weight * (1 / network_latency) * network_bandwidth / resource_size)

  return prefetch_score
```

**Operation:**

1.  The Behavioral Profiler continuously monitors client requests and builds predictive models.
2.  As a client is processing a request, the Prediction Engine calculates a Prefetch Score for potential resources.
3.  If the Prefetch Score exceeds a threshold, the Prefetch Coordinator initiates the prefetching of a consolidated bundle containing the predicted resources.
4.  Prefetched resources are stored in the cache.
5.  When the client subsequently requests a resource, the system first checks the cache. If the resource is present, it is served immediately, avoiding a network request.
