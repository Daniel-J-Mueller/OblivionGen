## Dynamic Mitigation Profiles & Predictive Null Routing

**Specification:** A system for dynamically creating and applying mitigation profiles to network traffic, combined with predictive null routing based on behavioral analysis.

**Concept:** The core idea builds on the patent's null routing but moves beyond reactive mitigation to *anticipatory* defense. Instead of only null routing known command and control nodes, the system *predicts* potential C&C nodes based on anomalous network behavior and proactively applies mitigated routing *before* malicious activity is confirmed.  This is achieved through dynamically generated mitigation profiles tailored to observed behavioral patterns.

**Components:**

1.  **Behavioral Analytics Engine (BAE):**  Continuously monitors network traffic, focusing on attribute deviations from established baselines. Attributes include:
    *   Request frequency/volume
    *   Payload size distribution
    *   Destination port diversity
    *   Geographic location of requests
    *   TLS/SSL certificate characteristics
    *   DNS query patterns

2.  **Mitigation Profile Generator (MPG):**  Receives anomaly data from the BAE. It then generates *Mitigation Profiles* which define a set of routing instructions – beyond simple null routing – including:
    *   **Traffic Shaping:** Rate limiting specific traffic types.
    *   **Geo-Fencing:** Restricting traffic from specific geographic regions.
    *   **Challenge-Response:** Triggering CAPTCHAs or other authentication challenges.
    *   **Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) Rules:** Identifying and blocking malicious payloads.
    *   **Null Route Probability:**  Dynamically adjusts the probability of applying a null route, increasing the likelihood as anomaly scores increase.

3.  **Predictive Routing Controller (PRC):**  This is the central component, receiving both anomaly data and generated Mitigation Profiles. It employs a machine learning model to predict potential C&C nodes based on observed behavioral trends.  The model outputs a ‘risk score’ for each network endpoint.

4.  **Dynamic Routing Infrastructure (DRI):**  Interacts with network routing devices (routers, switches, firewalls) to implement the mitigation profiles and null routing instructions.

**Pseudocode (PRC - Core Logic):**

```
function process_network_event(event):
  anomaly_score = BAE.calculate_anomaly_score(event)

  if anomaly_score > threshold:
    risk_score = ML_Model.predict_risk(event, anomaly_score)

    if risk_score > risk_threshold:
      mitigation_profile = MPG.generate_profile(event, risk_score)
      DRI.apply_mitigation(event.source_ip, mitigation_profile)
      log_event("Mitigation applied to " + event.source_ip)
    else:
      DRI.monitor_endpoint(event.source_ip) #Enhanced monitoring
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive Mitigation:** Moves beyond reactive null routing to anticipate and prevent attacks.
*   **Dynamic Profiles:** Tailors mitigation strategies to specific anomalous behaviors.
*   **ML-Driven Prediction:** Employs machine learning to identify potential C&C nodes with greater accuracy.
*   **Granular Control:** Enables fine-grained control over traffic shaping, geo-fencing, and DPI.
*    **Adaptive Thresholds:** Dynamically adjusts anomaly/risk thresholds based on network conditions and historical data.

**Deployment Considerations:**

*   Requires significant computational resources for real-time analysis and prediction.
*   Needs careful tuning to minimize false positives.
*   Integration with existing network infrastructure may be complex.
*   Data privacy considerations must be addressed.
