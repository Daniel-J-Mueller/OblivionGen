## Dynamic Predictive Capacity Shifting

**Concept:** Proactively shift capacity *between* POPs based on predicted traffic surges, not just reacting to detected surges. This moves beyond simply routing *to* available capacity and aims to *create* available capacity where it’s needed *before* the surge hits.

**Specifications:**

**1. Predictive Model:**

*   **Data Inputs:** Historical traffic patterns (by resource/target group), real-time traffic telemetry (latency, error rates), external event data (social media trends, news alerts, scheduled events – concerts, product launches).
*   **Model Type:** Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers to capture temporal dependencies.  A separate model instance per target group/resource.
*   **Output:**  Probability distribution of future traffic volume for each POP, and prediction confidence score.  Output horizon: 5-30 minutes.
*   **Training:** Continuous retraining using a rolling window of historical data.  Model weights updated daily, or more frequently if significant shifts in traffic patterns are detected.

**2. Capacity Shifting Mechanism:**

*   **Resource Pool:** Define a pool of “shiftable” resources (CPU, memory, bandwidth) within each POP. These resources are designated as available for temporary redistribution.
*   **Shifting Algorithm:**
    1.  For each POP, compare predicted incoming traffic volume with current resource allocation.
    2.  If predicted volume exceeds a threshold (based on resource utilization targets), initiate a request to *borrow* resources from neighboring POPs with predicted surplus capacity.
    3.  Resource requests prioritized based on predicted surge magnitude and prediction confidence.
    4.  Resource *transfer* implemented using containerization (Docker, Kubernetes).  Application instances migrated to POPs with increased capacity.
    5.  Reverse the process when traffic subsides – migrate applications back to original POPs, releasing borrowed resources.
*   **Capacity Adjustment Granularity:**  Fine-grained allocation of resources (e.g., individual application instances, virtual machines) to minimize disruption.
*   **Resource Prioritization:** Define prioritization levels for different resource types (e.g., prioritize bandwidth over CPU for video streaming).

**3.  Control Plane & API:**

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/predict_traffic`:  Submit traffic telemetry and request traffic predictions.
    *   `/request_resources`:  Request resources from neighboring POPs.
    *   `/release_resources`: Release borrowed resources.
    *   `/status`:  Retrieve status of resource allocation and prediction models.
*   **Control Plane Architecture:** Microservices-based architecture with a central orchestrator responsible for managing resource allocation and prediction model updates.
*   **Monitoring & Alerting:** Real-time monitoring of resource utilization, prediction accuracy, and system health.  Alerts triggered for anomalous behavior or prediction failures.

**4.  Pseudocode (Resource Allocation Orchestrator):**

```
function allocate_resources(POP, target_group):
  prediction = get_traffic_prediction(POP, target_group)
  if prediction.volume > POP.capacity * threshold:
    surplus_POPs = find_surplus_POPs(POP, target_group)
    for surplus_POP in surplus_POPs:
      amount = min(prediction.volume - POP.capacity, surplus_POP.available_capacity)
      request_resource_transfer(surplus_POP, POP, amount)
      # Update available capacity tracking for both POPs
  # Repeat allocation cycle every X minutes
```

**Novelty:** This design proactively *shapes* capacity to meet anticipated demand, rather than simply reacting to detected surges. This reduces latency, improves user experience, and minimizes the need for over-provisioning. The predictive model and automated resource transfer mechanism represent a significant advancement over existing traffic surge management systems.
