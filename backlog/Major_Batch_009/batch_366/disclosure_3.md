**Dynamic Product Ecosystem Mapping & Proactive Suggestion**

**Specification:**

**I. Core Concept:** Expand beyond simple accessory/substitute suggestions to create a dynamic, interconnected "product ecosystem" map based on user reviews *and* external data sources (social media trends, expert reviews, repair data, seasonal demands).  This map isn't static; it evolves based on collective user interactions and real-world events.

**II. Data Ingestion & Processing:**

*   **Review Data:** Existing system for capturing customer reviews (favorable/unfavorable).
*   **External Data Feeds:**
    *   **Social Media APIs:** Track mentions of products, related terms, and sentiment.  Emphasis on identifying emerging use cases or pain points.
    *   **Expert/Professional Reviews:** Integrate data from sites like Wirecutter, Consumer Reports, iFixit (repair data).  Categorize based on expertise and bias.
    *   **Sales Data (Internal & Public):** Track sales trends to identify complementary products.  Focus on co-purchasing patterns.
    *   **Repair/Failure Rate Data:**  Identify products with common issues.  Suggest preventative maintenance items or more reliable alternatives.
    *   **Seasonal/Event-Based Data:**  Adjust recommendations based on time of year, holidays, or trending events.

*   **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Utilize a graph database to represent products as nodes and relationships as edges.  Relationships include:
    *   `is_accessory_of`
    *   `is_substitute_for`
    *   `is_frequently_used_with`
    *   `solves_problem_caused_by`
    *   `is_expert_recommended_alternative_to`
    *   `has_high_failure_rate` (flagged with severity)
    *   `is_trending_with` (based on social data)

**III. Proactive Suggestion Engine:**

1.  **Review Analysis:** Determine sentiment and identify key themes within the review text.
2.  **Ecosystem Traversal:** Based on the reviewed product and the identified themes, traverse the knowledge graph to identify relevant products.  Prioritize paths based on:
    *   **Relevance Score:** Calculated based on the strength of the relationships and the alignment with the review themes.
    *   **Diversity:**  Encourage exploration of less obvious but potentially valuable suggestions.  Avoid repeatedly suggesting the same products.
    *   **User Profile:**  Incorporate user purchase history and browsing behavior.
3.  **Proactive Suggestion Delivery:**
    *   **Tiered Suggestions:**  Present suggestions in tiers based on relevance and confidence.  e.g., "Highly Recommended," "Consider Also," "You Might Be Interested In."
    *   **Explanatory Text:**  Provide a brief explanation of *why* a product is being suggested.  e.g., "Based on your review of the camera, other users who have similar experiences also purchased this external battery."
    *   **Real-Time Adaptation:**  Adjust suggestions based on user interactions (clicks, purchases, dismissals).

**IV. Pseudocode (Suggestion Engine):**

```
FUNCTION generate_suggestions(product_id, review_text, user_profile)

    // 1. Analyze Review & Extract Themes
    themes = analyze_review(review_text)

    // 2. Traverse Knowledge Graph
    related_products = traverse_graph(product_id, themes, user_profile)

    // 3. Rank & Filter Results
    ranked_products = rank_products(related_products, themes)
    filtered_products = filter_products(ranked_products, user_profile)

    // 4. Generate Tiered Suggestions
    suggestions = create_tiered_suggestions(filtered_products)

    RETURN suggestions
END FUNCTION
```

**V. Innovation:**

The key innovation is shifting from reactive (suggesting based solely on the reviewed product) to *proactive* (anticipating user needs based on a holistic view of the product ecosystem and external factors).  This creates a more engaging and valuable experience for the customer, potentially leading to increased sales and brand loyalty. This isn't about just finding alternatives, but *foreseeing* complementary needs.
