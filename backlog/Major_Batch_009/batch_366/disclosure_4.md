**Adaptive Environmental Mapping via RF Signal Disruption Analysis**

**Concept:** Utilize the described RF signal disruption detection to create a dynamic, localized environmental map. Instead of merely identifying *presence*, build a constantly updating model of object positions and movements within a defined space.

**Specs:**

1.  **Sensor Network:** Deploy a network of low-power “RF listeners” throughout the environment (rooms, hallways, etc.). These don’t transmit, only receive and analyze the 802.11 signals. Each listener has a timestamp and location coordinate.
2.  **Baseline Calibration:** During initial setup, establish a baseline RF “fingerprint” of the environment. This involves recording signal strength, phase, and CSI data from multiple known locations. This creates a “clean” environmental profile.
3.  **Disruption Vector Analysis:** When a device (the primary detection unit) observes a variance in CSI data (magnitude and phase) across multiple communication links, it doesn't just register ‘presence’. It calculates a “disruption vector.” This vector represents the direction and magnitude of the signal disruption. The direction is calculated by triangulating the signal variance across multiple receiving devices.
4.  **Mapping Algorithm:**
    *   A central processing unit receives disruption vectors from each primary detection unit.
    *   The algorithm compares current disruption vectors to the baseline fingerprint.
    *   Significant deviations trigger a mapping update.
    *   The algorithm uses a Kalman filter or particle filter to predict object trajectory and refine object position estimates.
    *   A 3D map of the environment is constructed, representing object positions as volumetric data.
5.  **Object Identification (Optional):**
    *   Integrate with device fingerprinting to attempt to identify the disrupting object (e.g., phone, laptop).
    *   If successful, tag the object on the 3D map.
6.  **Data Smoothing/Filtering:** Implement a rolling average filter to smooth out positional data, reducing noise and improving accuracy.
7.  **Communication Protocol:** Define a lightweight communication protocol for sending disruption vectors to the central processing unit. Minimize bandwidth usage.
8.  **Coordinate System:** Establish a local coordinate system for the environment to provide precise positioning.
9.  **Power Management:** Implement low-power modes for the RF listeners to extend battery life.

**Pseudocode (Disruption Vector Calculation):**

```
FUNCTION calculateDisruptionVector(CSI_data_link1, CSI_data_link2, baseline_CSI_link1, baseline_CSI_link2, device_location):
    variance_link1 = calculateVariance(CSI_data_link1, baseline_CSI_link1)
    variance_link2 = calculateVariance(CSI_data_link2, baseline_CSI_link2)

    // Calculate direction based on variance differences
    direction_x = variance_link2.x - variance_link1.x
    direction_y = variance_link2.y - variance_link1.y
    direction_z = variance_link2.z - variance_link1.z

    magnitude = sqrt(direction_x^2 + direction_y^2 + direction_z^2)

    disruption_vector = (direction_x, direction_y, direction_z, magnitude)

    RETURN disruption_vector
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION calculateVariance(current_CSI, baseline_CSI):
  variance_x = current_CSI.x - baseline_CSI.x
  variance_y = current_CSI.y - baseline_CSI.y
  variance_z = current_CSI.z - baseline_CSI.z
  RETURN (variance_x, variance_y, variance_z)
END FUNCTION
```
