## Dynamic Action Mapping via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Extend the automated actionable element discovery to incorporate real-time user biofeedback (e.g., EEG, GSR) to dynamically map actions to content elements *during* interaction. This moves beyond pre-defined schemes and creates truly personalized, adaptive navigation.

**Specs:**

1.  **Biofeedback Sensor Integration:**
    *   Support for multiple biofeedback sensors (EEG headsets, GSR wristbands, heart rate monitors).
    *   Sensor data ingestion module with noise filtering and signal processing.
    *   Calibration routine for each user to establish baseline biofeedback signatures.

2.  **Real-time Biofeedback Analysis:**
    *   Algorithm to detect user cognitive load, emotional state (engagement, frustration), and intent based on biofeedback data.
    *   Mapping of biofeedback signatures to probable user actions (e.g., high cognitive load -> need for simplified navigation, frustration -> suggest alternative actions).

3.  **Dynamic Action Mapping Engine:**
    *   Modifies the navigation scheme *during* user interaction.
    *   Uses biofeedback-derived probabilities to re-weight or re-map actionable elements.
    *   Prioritizes elements based on predicted user intent, making them more prominent or accessible.
    *   Can create *temporary* virtual elements based on biofeedback, offering contextual assistance (e.g., "Help" button appears when frustration is detected).

4.  **Actionable Element Discovery Enhancement:**
    *   Integrate biofeedback data into the initial actionable element discovery process (patent process).
    *   Weight potential elements based on anticipated user preferences (derived from biofeedback during a training phase).
    *   Filter out elements that consistently elicit negative biofeedback responses.

5.  **User Profile and Learning:**
    *   Store user biofeedback data and interaction history to create personalized profiles.
    *   Machine learning algorithms to refine action mapping over time, adapting to individual user preferences and behavior.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// During content rendering/interaction loop:

captureBiofeedbackData()
processBiofeedbackData() -> {cognitiveLoad, emotionalState, predictedIntent}

// Update action weights based on biofeedback
for each actionableElement:
    weight = baseWeight + (cognitiveLoad * cognitiveWeightFactor) + (emotionalState * emotionalWeightFactor) + (predictedIntent * intentWeightFactor)
    actionableElement.weight = weight

// Re-sort actionable elements based on updated weights
sortActionableElementsByWeight()

// Adjust navigation scheme visualization based on sorted weights (e.g., highlighting, reordering)
updateNavigationSchemeVisualization()

// Potentially create/remove virtual elements based on biofeedback criteria
if (frustrationLevel > threshold):
    createVirtualElement("Help", actionableElementWithHighestWeight)

// Send updated navigation scheme to client device
transmitNavigationScheme()
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Compatible biofeedback sensors (EEG, GSR, etc.)
*   Processing unit capable of real-time biofeedback analysis and navigation scheme modification.
*   Network connectivity to transmit updated schemes to client devices.

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   Adaptive gaming interfaces
*   Personalized educational platforms
*   Assistive technology for users with disabilities
*   Enhanced user experience for complex software applications.
