## Adaptive Distillation Granularity

**Concept:** Extend the distillation process to operate at varying granularities – not just feature-level, but also at the level of *sub-features* or even individual neuron activations. This allows for a more nuanced and targeted diversification of learned representations within the ensemble.

**Specs:**

1.  **Granularity Map:** Introduce a “Granularity Map” – a dynamically adjusted weighting scheme that determines the level of detail at which distillation occurs for each feature (or sub-feature) during training of subsequent models.
2.  **Activation Sensitivity Analysis:** Implement an Activation Sensitivity Analysis module. This analyzes the gradients and activations of neurons within the first trained model. Neurons with high impact on classification decisions or those consistently activated across a wide range of inputs are flagged as “critical.”
3.  **Dynamic Granularity Adjustment:** During training of the second (and subsequent) models, the Granularity Map dynamically adjusts based on the Activation Sensitivity Analysis.
    *   Critical neurons/features have *low* granularity – meaning distillation targets a broader, more generalized representation.  The aim is to force the subsequent model to learn *different* ways to achieve the same outcome without directly copying specific activations.
    *   Non-critical neurons/features have *high* granularity – enabling precise distillation and knowledge transfer for less important aspects of the representation.
4.  **Distillation Loss Component:**  Modify the existing feature-based diversification loss to incorporate a Granularity Weighting.  The loss applied to each distilled feature will be scaled by its corresponding Granularity Weight.
5.  **Sub-Feature Extraction:** Develop a method for identifying and extracting “sub-features” within existing features. This could involve applying dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, autoencoders) or analyzing the weights of intermediate layers.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
# Training loop for subsequent models (model_i)

def train_model_i(model_i, training_data, model_i_1, granularity_map):
    for batch in training_data:
        # Forward pass through model_i_1 (previous model)
        activations_i_1 = model_i_1(batch)

        # Forward pass through model_i
        activations_i = model_i(batch)

        # Calculate distillation loss
        distillation_loss = 0
        for feature_index in range(num_features):
            granularity_weight = granularity_map[feature_index]
            distillation_loss += granularity_weight * loss_function(activations_i[feature_index], activations_i_1[feature_index])

        # Combine distillation loss with standard loss
        total_loss = distillation_loss + standard_loss(model_i(batch), labels)

        # Backpropagate and update weights
```

**Activation Sensitivity Analysis (Pseudocode):**

```python
def analyze_activation_sensitivity(model, training_data):
    gradients = []
    activations = []
    for batch in training_data:
        # Calculate gradients of output with respect to activations
        gradients_batch = calculate_gradients(model(batch))

        # Store average gradients and activations for each neuron
        gradients.append(np.mean(gradients_batch, axis=0))
        activations.append(np.mean(model(batch), axis=0))

    # Calculate sensitivity score
    sensitivity_score = np.std(gradients, axis=0) # Standard deviation of gradients
    # Normalize Sensitivity scores
    sensitivity_score = (sensitivity_score - np.min(sensitivity_score)) / (np.max(sensitivity_score) - np.min(sensitivity_score))

    return sensitivity_score
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Enhanced Diversification:**  More granular control over distillation allows for a more nuanced and effective diversification of learned representations.
*   **Improved Robustness:** By forcing subsequent models to learn different strategies for handling critical features, the ensemble can become more robust to noise and adversarial attacks.
*   **Increased Efficiency:** Focusing distillation on non-critical features can reduce computational cost and improve training speed.
