## Adaptive Health Check Granularity & Predictive Scaling

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on reactive health checks – identifying *unhealthy* servers. This design extends that by introducing granular health checks *before* failure, coupled with predictive scaling based on health trend analysis. It moves beyond simple up/down status to a spectrum of server ‘wellness’, and proactively adjusts resource allocation.

**Specs:**

*   **Health Check Profiles:** Each server (or group of servers) will be assigned a configurable 'Health Profile'. This profile defines:
    *   **Check Frequency:** Baseline frequency of health checks.
    *   **Check Depth:** A tiered system of checks, ranging from simple ping to complex application-level transactions. Higher tiers consume more resources but provide more detailed insights.
    *   **Thresholds:**  Ranges for each metric (response time, CPU load, memory utilization, error rates). These thresholds define 'healthy', 'warning', and 'critical' states.
    *   **Metric Weighting:**  Assign weights to different metrics, reflecting their importance to overall service health.
*   **Dynamic Check Adjustment:**
    *   A 'Health Trend Analyzer' monitors metric values over time.
    *   If a server enters a ‘warning’ state (approaching a threshold), the Check Depth *increases* (more intensive checks).  Frequency may also increase.
    *   If a server remains healthy and stable, the Check Depth *decreases* (less intensive checks). Frequency may decrease.
    *   This adjustment is automatic and proportional to the severity of the trend.
*   **Predictive Scaling Integration:**
    *   The Health Trend Analyzer feeds data to a 'Predictive Scaling Engine'.
    *   This engine employs time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to forecast future server load and potential failures.
    *   Based on the forecast, it proactively scales resources (e.g., adding more servers, increasing CPU/memory allocation) *before* performance degrades or failures occur.  This is achieved via integration with the hosting system described in the parent patent.
*   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement machine learning models to detect unusual patterns in health check data. These anomalies could indicate underlying issues not captured by standard thresholds.
*   **Self-Learning Thresholds:** Implement a reinforcement learning system that automatically adjusts health check thresholds based on historical data and observed service behavior.  The system can learn optimal thresholds that minimize false positives and false negatives.

**Pseudocode (Health Trend Analyzer):**

```
function analyze_health_trend(server_id, metric_data):
  current_value = metric_data.value
  thresholds = get_thresholds(server_id, metric_data.name)
  
  if current_value > thresholds.critical:
    state = "critical"
  elif current_value > thresholds.warning:
    state = "warning"
  else:
    state = "healthy"
  
  historical_data = get_historical_data(server_id, metric_data.name)
  
  trend = calculate_trend(historical_data) // Linear regression, moving average, etc.
  
  if trend > 0 and state == "warning":
    increase_check_depth(server_id, metric_data.name)
  elif trend < 0 and state == "healthy":
    decrease_check_depth(server_id, metric_data.name)
  
  return state
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **ServerProfile:**  { server_id, health_profile, metric_weights }
*   **MetricData:** { server_id, metric_name, value, timestamp }
*   **HistoricalData:**  [ { timestamp, value }, ... ]
*   **Thresholds:** { healthy, warning, critical }
