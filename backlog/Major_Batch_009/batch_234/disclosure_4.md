**Dynamic Wavelength Allocation & Polarization Multiplexing for Enhanced Fiber Ring Storage**

**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Component:**  A Polarization-Maintaining Optical Fiber (PMF) Ring system.  The ring utilizes PMF to preserve polarization states, crucial for advanced modulation.
*   **Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) Grid:**  A dynamically allocated WDM grid operating across C-band (1530-1565 nm).  Minimum channel spacing: 25 GHz.  Total usable bandwidth: ~9 THz.
*   **Polarization Multiplexing (PolMux):** Each WDM channel utilizes PolMux, effectively doubling the data capacity per wavelength.  This requires polarization beam splitters/combiners at ingress/egress points.
*   **Dynamic Allocation Controller (DAC):** A software-defined controller responsible for:
    *   Assigning wavelengths to data streams based on priority and bandwidth demand.
    *   Monitoring Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and adjusting power levels per wavelength.
    *   Implementing a “Wavelength Hopping” algorithm to distribute wear and tear across the fiber and mitigate non-linear effects.
    *   Monitoring Polarization Drift and applying real-time polarization compensation.
*   **Optical Circulators:**  Placed at multiple points around the ring to allow for signal monitoring, amplification, and switching without disrupting the main data flow.
*   **Optical Add/Drop Multiplexers (OADMs):** OADMs dynamically add or drop specific wavelengths at designated nodes for data access and processing.
*   **Edge Computing Nodes:** Distributed around the ring, integrating with OADMs.  These nodes perform pre-processing (e.g., compression, encryption) and initial analytics on data before it's transferred to central storage.
*   **Data Encoding Scheme:**  Higher-order modulation formats (e.g., 16-QAM, 64-QAM) will be employed to maximize spectral efficiency.  Adaptive modulation based on SNR.
*   **Redundancy:** Multiple fiber rings, with automated failover mechanisms.

// Data Ingestion
function ingest_data(data_stream, priority):
    wavelength = DAC.allocate_wavelength(priority)
    if wavelength == NULL:
        // Handle wavelength allocation failure (e.g., queue data)
        return ERROR

    wavelength.set_data_stream(data_stream)
    fiber_ring.inject_signal(wavelength)
    return SUCCESS

    wavelength = DAC.find_wavelength(request_id)
    if wavelength == NULL:
        // Handle data not found
        return ERROR
    DAC.set_extraction_flag(wavelength)
    fiber_ring.extract_signal(wavelength)
    return wavelength.data

// Wavelength Hopping Algorithm (Background Process)
function wavelength_hopping():
    while (true):
        for each wavelength in fiber_ring:
            if (time since last hop > hopping_interval):
                new_wavelength = DAC.find_available_wavelength()
                if (new_wavelength != NULL):
                    DAC.swap_wavelengths(wavelength, new_wavelength)
                hopping_interval = random(min_hopping_interval, max_hopping_interval)

// Polarization Drift Compensation (Background Process)
function compensate_polarization_drift():
    while(true):
        for each wavelength in fiber_ring:
            current_polarization = measure_polarization(wavelength)
            target_polarization = wavelength.target_polarization
            adjustment = calculate_polarization_adjustment(current_polarization, target_polarization)

**Innovation Rationale:**

This system aims to move beyond simple data-in-motion storage to create a dynamic, high-bandwidth, and resilient optical storage network. By combining WDM, PolMux, and dynamic allocation, it maximizes data capacity and minimizes latency. The incorporation of edge computing nodes distributes processing load and enhances real-time analytics. The background processes for wavelength hopping and polarization drift compensation ensure long-term stability and performance.  The use of PMF is key to maintaining signal integrity over extended circulation times. This differs from the base patent by adding significantly increased bandwidth through advanced modulation and multiplexing. It's no longer simply about keeping data *in motion*, but about maximizing the *rate* of data flow within the system while guaranteeing data fidelity.
