## Electrowetting Acoustic Focusing Array

**Concept:** Leveraging electrowetting to dynamically shape a fluidic lens for precise acoustic beamforming and focusing.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A microfluidic chip containing an array of individually addressable electrowetting cells. Each cell encapsulates a small volume of a high-density fluid (e.g., perfluorocarbon).
*   **Array Geometry:**  Cells arranged in a 2D grid (e.g., 64x64). The density of cells will be adjustable based on desired frequency range and focal resolution.
*   **Electrode Structure:** Each cell has multiple (e.g., 8) independently controlled electrodes. These electrodes aren't simply planar; theyâ€™re micro-fabricated 3D structures (think tiny pillars or fins) within the fluid volume. This allows for non-planar deformation of the fluid interface.
*   **Fluid Interface:** The high-density fluid is immiscible with a surrounding lower-density fluid (e.g., water). The electrowetting effect controls the curvature of the interface between these fluids *in 3D*, creating a dynamic lens.
*   **Acoustic Transducer Integration:** A piezoelectric transducer (or array) is positioned adjacent to the microfluidic chip. This transducer generates the initial acoustic wave. The fluidic lens then focuses and steers this wave.
*   **Control System:**
    *   A dedicated microcontroller manages voltage application to each electrode.
    *   A feedback loop incorporating a micro-fabricated acoustic sensor (e.g., MEMS microphone) monitors the focal point and corrects for aberrations.
    *   Software algorithms translate desired beamforming parameters (focus location, beam width, steering angle) into specific voltage patterns for the electrodes.
*   **Materials:**
    *   Microfluidic Chip: PDMS or glass.
    *   Electrodes: Platinum, gold, or ITO.
    *   High-Density Fluid: Perfluorocarbon liquid.
    *   Low-Density Fluid: Deionized Water.
*   **Dimensions:** Chip size: 2cm x 2cm. Cell size: 50-100 microns. Electrode height: 20-50 microns.
*   **Power Requirements:** 5V DC, <100mA.

**Operation:**

1.  Initial State: All electrodes are at zero voltage. The fluid interface is relatively flat, resulting in a broad acoustic beam.
2.  Beamforming: The control system applies voltages to specific electrodes. This creates localized electrowetting effects, deforming the fluid interface and creating a focusing lens.
3.  Steering: By dynamically adjusting the voltage patterns, the focal point can be scanned across a volume.
4.  Adaptive Optics: The feedback loop continuously monitors the acoustic field and corrects for aberrations caused by manufacturing imperfections or environmental factors.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```
// Define array dimensions
int arrayWidth = 64;
int arrayHeight = 64;

// Define voltage array
float voltageArray[arrayWidth][arrayHeight];

// Function to calculate voltage pattern for desired focus location
void calculateVoltagePattern(float x, float y, float z) {
  // Calculate optimal electrode voltages based on desired focus coordinates
  // using ray tracing or finite element analysis
  // ...

  // Apply calculated voltages to voltageArray
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Get desired focus coordinates from user or external sensor
  float x = ...;
  float y = ...;
  float z = ...;

  // Calculate voltage pattern
  calculateVoltagePattern(x, y, z);

  // Apply voltages to electrodes
  for (int i = 0; i < arrayWidth; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < arrayHeight; j++) {
      setElectrodeVoltage(i, j, voltageArray[i][j]);
    }
  }

  // Read acoustic sensor data
  // ...

  // Adjust voltage pattern based on sensor feedback (adaptive optics)
  // ...
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Non-destructive testing
*   Medical imaging
*   Underwater sonar
*   Particle manipulation
*   High-resolution microscopy.
