**Adaptive Multi-Resolution Time-Series Cubes**

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic data format selection to operate on multi-dimensional time-series data represented as data cubes. Instead of just switching *formats*, dynamically adjust the *resolution* of different dimensions within the cube based on query patterns and data density.

**Specifications:**

*   **Data Structure:** N-dimensional time-series data cube. Each dimension represents a variable/attribute. Data is stored in cells representing values at specific points in time and across all dimensions.
*   **Resolution Levels:** Each dimension can have multiple resolution levels (e.g., coarse, medium, fine). Higher resolution means more data points/granularity along that dimension.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment Module:** A dedicated module monitors query patterns across all dimensions. It analyzes:
    *   **Query Frequency:** How often each dimension is used in queries.
    *   **Aggregation Level:** The level of aggregation requested (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly).
    *   **Dimensional Sparsity:** The proportion of missing or irrelevant data points in each dimension.
*   **Resolution Control Algorithm:**
    1.  **Initialization:** Start with a base resolution for all dimensions.
    2.  **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor query patterns and data sparsity.
    3.  **Resolution Adjustment:**
        *   **High Query Frequency + Low Sparsity:** Increase resolution for that dimension.
        *   **Low Query Frequency + High Sparsity:** Decrease resolution for that dimension.
        *   **Adaptive Granularity:**  Instead of fixed resolution levels, utilize variable granularity.  For example, a dimension could have 1-day resolution for recent data, 7-day resolution for data from the last month, and monthly resolution for older data.
    4.  **Data Migration:** Efficiently migrate data between resolution levels. This could involve:
        *   **Aggregation/Disaggregation:** Calculate aggregated/disaggregated values on-the-fly or pre-compute them and store them in a separate layer.
        *   **Data Compression:** Utilize data compression techniques to reduce storage space.
*   **Query Processing:** A query optimizer takes into account the resolution of each dimension and dynamically adjusts the query plan to retrieve data efficiently.

**Pseudocode (Query Processing):**

```
function processQuery(query):
  dimensions = query.getDimensions()
  for dimension in dimensions:
    resolution = getDimensionResolution(dimension) // Retrieves current resolution
    if resolution > query.requiredResolution(dimension):
      // Downsample data: Apply aggregation/filtering
      downsampleData(data, dimension, query.requiredResolution(dimension))
    else if resolution < query.requiredResolution(dimension):
      //Upsample data. (requires interpolation/approximation)
      upsampleData(data, dimension, query.requiredResolution(dimension))
  result = executeQuery(data)
  return result
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   **Optimized Storage:** Reduce storage space by storing less detailed data for dimensions that are rarely queried.
*   **Improved Query Performance:** Speed up queries by retrieving only the necessary data.
*   **Adaptive to Changing Patterns:** Dynamically adjust data resolution to accommodate changing query patterns.
*   **Scalability:** Enables efficient storage and retrieval of massive multi-dimensional time-series data.
