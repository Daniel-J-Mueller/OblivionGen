## Dynamic Key Orchestration via Biofeedback

**Concept:** Integrate real-time biometric data from the client device (heart rate variability, skin conductance, subtle muscle movements) into the key generation process, creating a continuously evolving and highly personalized encryption key. This goes beyond static CAPTCHA solutions by incorporating a continuous authentication layer *within* the encryption itself.

**Specifications:**

**1. Biofeedback Acquisition Module:**

*   **Sensors:** Utilize existing client device sensors (camera for facial micro-expressions/heart rate via photoplethysmography, microphone for vocal stress analysis, accelerometer/gyroscope for subtle movement detection, capacitive sensors if present)
*   **Data Stream:** Establish a secure, low-bandwidth data stream conveying raw sensor data or pre-processed biometric features to the server. Prioritize privacy – minimal data transmission.
*   **Calibration:** Implement a brief initial calibration phase to establish a baseline biometric profile for the user. This establishes a ‘normal’ state for deviation detection.

**2. Key Generation Engine (Server-Side):**

*   **Input Parameters:**
    *   Baseline Biometric Profile (from calibration)
    *   Real-time Biometric Data Stream
    *   CAPTCHA Solution (initial seed)
    *   Pre-master Secret (from TLS handshake - optional)
    *   Random Number Generator (RNG) seed.
*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **Deviation Calculation:** Quantify the deviation of real-time biometric data from the baseline profile.  Utilize statistical methods (e.g., standard deviation, entropy).
    2.  **Deviation Mapping:** Map the quantified deviation into a range of values suitable for key material (e.g., 0-255).
    3.  **Key Mixing:**
        *   Combine the CAPTCHA solution, pre-master secret (if used), and RNG seed.
        *   XOR the mixed values with the deviation mapped values.
        *   Apply a Key Derivation Function (KDF) such as Argon2 or scrypt to generate the final cryptographic key. KDF parameters are dynamically adjusted based on the strength of biometric deviation - higher deviation = stronger KDF parameters.
*   **Key Refresh Rate:**  The key is refreshed at a configurable interval (e.g., every 5-30 seconds) by repeating the deviation calculation, mixing, and KDF process.  A sliding window of biometric data is used to mitigate short-term fluctuations.

**3. Client-Side Integration:**

*   **Secure Data Transmission:**  Encrypt the biometric data stream using TLS or a similar protocol.
*   **Adaptive CAPTCHA:**  Adjust the difficulty of the initial CAPTCHA based on the client’s device capabilities and network conditions.
*   **Monitoring:** Monitor the biometric data stream for anomalies that may indicate a compromised system or malicious activity.

**Pseudocode (Key Generation Loop - Server Side):**

```
function generateKey(baselineProfile, biometricData, captchaSolution, preMasterSecret, rngSeed):
  deviation = calculateDeviation(biometricData, baselineProfile)
  mappedDeviation = mapDeviationToKeyMaterial(deviation)
  mixedValues = combine(captchaSolution, preMasterSecret, rngSeed, mappedDeviation)
  kdfParameters = determineKdfParameters(deviation) // Adjust parameters based on deviation strength
  cryptographicKey = applyKdf(mixedValues, kdfParameters)
  return cryptographicKey
```

**Innovation:** The system isn’t just verifying *that* a human is present; it’s constantly verifying *who* is present and incorporating that identity into the encryption process. This creates a highly dynamic and personalized encryption layer that is significantly more resilient to man-in-the-middle attacks and key compromise. By relying on a continuous stream of biometric data, the system can detect changes in the user's state and proactively adjust the encryption parameters.
