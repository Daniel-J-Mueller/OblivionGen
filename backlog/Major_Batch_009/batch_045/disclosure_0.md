## Multi-Spectral Propeller Blades for Environmental Sensing

**Concept:** Integrate micro-spectrometers and LED arrays directly into propeller blades to create a mobile environmental sensing platform during flight.

**Specifications:**

*   **Blade Material:** Transparent or translucent polymer composite (e.g., acrylic, polycarbonate) with high optical clarity.
*   **Micro-Spectrometer Integration:**
    *   Array of miniature spectrometers embedded within the blade structure, spaced along the blade length.
    *   Spectrometer resolution: 5-10 nm (visible and near-infrared spectrum).
    *   Data transmission: Wireless communication (Bluetooth/Wi-Fi) to onboard processing unit.
*   **LED Array Integration:**
    *   Array of multi-spectral LEDs (visible, near-infrared, potentially UV) integrated alongside spectrometers.
    *   LEDs serve as active illumination sources for improved signal-to-noise ratio and for targeted spectral analysis.
    *   Controllable intensity and wavelength selection for each LED.
*   **Power Supply:**
    *   Wireless power transfer from the main UAV power system to the propeller hub.
    *   Alternatively, miniature energy harvesting devices (piezoelectric or thermoelectric) embedded in the blades to supplement power.
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   Onboard processing unit to receive data from spectrometers, perform calibration, and generate environmental maps (e.g., vegetation health, pollution levels, mineral composition).
    *   Real-time data visualization and transmission to ground station.
*   **Blade Design:**
    *   Aerodynamic profiling maintained despite sensor integration.
    *   Protective coatings to prevent sensor damage from environmental factors (dust, moisture, UV radiation).
    *   Modular blade design for easy sensor replacement and maintenance.
*   **Software:**
    *   Proprietary software for sensor calibration, data acquisition, processing, and visualization.
    *   Integration with GIS software for environmental mapping and analysis.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Initialize Sensors()
Calibrate Sensors()

// Flight Loop
While (FlightActive) {
    // Data Acquisition
    SensorData = ReadSensors()

    // Data Processing
    ProcessedData = ProcessSensorData(SensorData)

    // Environmental Map Generation
    GenerateEnvironmentalMap(ProcessedData)

    // Data Transmission
    TransmitDataToGroundStation()

    // Adjust LED wavelengths and intensities based on target analysis
    AdjustLEDs(targetSpectrum)
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Precision agriculture: Monitor crop health, detect nutrient deficiencies, and optimize irrigation.
*   Environmental monitoring: Map pollution levels, assess forest health, and track wildlife populations.
*   Geological surveys: Identify mineral deposits, map geological formations, and assess land stability.
*   Search and rescue: Detect heat signatures, locate missing persons, and assess disaster damage.
