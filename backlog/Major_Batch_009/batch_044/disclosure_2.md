## Dynamic Constellation Shadowing & Predictive UI

**Concept:** Extend the collaborative interface to allow operators to “shadow” each other's actions in a delayed, predictive manner. This creates a powerful training and verification system, and enables proactive issue identification.

**Specs:**

*   **System Component:** "Shadow Controller" – a software module integrated within the existing computer system.
*   **Data Capture:** The Shadow Controller logs operator input (commands, selections, data entries) and resulting system outputs (satellite status, telemetry, UI changes) for selected operators. This is done in near real-time, with configurable logging granularity (e.g., full data, command summaries, UI diffs).
*   **Time-Shifted Playback:** Operators can select another operator's "shadow" to view a time-shifted replay of their session. This replay isn't a simple recording; it’s an *interactive* simulation.
*   **Predictive UI Rendering:** As the shadow session replays, the system *predicts* the resulting UI changes based on the logged actions. This predictive UI is displayed alongside the live operator’s interface. Discrepancies between the predicted UI and the live UI are highlighted.
*   **Action Branching:** At key decision points in the shadow session, the shadowing operator can “branch” the simulation.  They can input alternate commands and observe the predicted outcomes *without* impacting the live operator’s session. This is crucial for "what if" analysis and preventative troubleshooting.
*   **UI Differencing Algorithm:** A dedicated algorithm identifies and highlights UI differences between the live view and the predicted view. This could range from simple element highlighting to more sophisticated visual diffs (e.g., color overlays showing changed values).
*   **Permission-Based Shadowing:** Shadowing access is governed by the same permission system as the core collaborative interface. Operators can only shadow sessions for which they have appropriate authorization.
*   **Session Recording Storage:** Session recordings are stored with timestamps and operator IDs. A storage quota system is implemented to manage disk space usage.
*   **Metadata Association:** Each session recording includes metadata about the constellation configuration, satellite health, and operator experience level. This metadata is used to filter and search for relevant recordings.

**Pseudocode (Shadow Controller - Key Functions):**

```pseudocode
function LogOperatorAction(operatorID, inputData, systemOutput):
    record = {
        timestamp: currentTime(),
        operatorID: operatorID,
        inputData: inputData,
        systemOutput: systemOutput
    }
    storeRecord(record)

function ReplaySession(shadowingOperatorID, targetOperatorID, playbackSpeed):
    records = retrieveRecords(targetOperatorID)
    for record in records:
        applyInput(record.inputData) // Simulate input
        predictedOutput = getSystemOutput()
        displayPredictedOutput(shadowingOperatorID, predictedOutput)
        sleep(1 / playbackSpeed)

function ApplyInput(inputData):
    // Simulate the system's response to the input
    // This will require a model of the constellation management system
    // The level of fidelity of this model will determine the accuracy of the prediction
    // Consider using machine learning to train a model based on historical data
    systemState = updateSystemState(systemState, inputData)
    return systemState

function UpdateSystemState(systemState, inputData):
    //Placeholder. Actual implementation will depend on system complexity
    return systemState

function BranchSimulation(branchPoint, alternateInput):
  //Pause current replay at a selected branch point
  //Reset system to the system state at that branch point
  //Apply the alternate input to the simulated system
  //Run the simulation forward from the point of divergence
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced Operator Training
*   Improved Constellation Reliability
*   Proactive Issue Detection and Resolution
*   Facilitated Knowledge Sharing among Operators
*   Automated System Testing and Validation
