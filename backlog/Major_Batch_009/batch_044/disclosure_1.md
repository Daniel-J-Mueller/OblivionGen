## Dynamic Category Weighting via User Interaction

**Concept:** Expand the categorization system to incorporate real-time user feedback, dynamically adjusting category weights based on observed user behavior and preference. This moves beyond static hierarchical structures to create a personalized and evolving categorization engine.

**Specifications:**

1.  **User Interaction Logging:**
    *   Implement a logging system to track user interactions with categorized items. This includes:
        *   Clicks/Views: Track which items a user views or clicks on within a given category.
        *   Purchase History: Record purchases made within specific categories.
        *   Explicit Feedback:  Allow users to provide direct feedback on category relevance (e.g., "This item doesn't belong in this category," or a simple upvote/downvote system for category assignments).
        *   Dwell Time: Measure how long a user spends viewing an item after clicking on it from a specific category. Longer dwell times suggest a stronger connection between the user, the item, and the category.

2.  **Dynamic Weight Adjustment Algorithm:**
    *   **Initial Weights:** Assign initial weights to all categories (equal distribution or based on pre-defined metrics).
    *   **Weight Update Frequency:** Define a frequency for updating category weights (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly).
    *   **Weight Calculation:**  Implement an algorithm to adjust category weights based on logged user interactions.  Pseudocode:

```
    FOR each category:
        interaction_score = 0

        FOR each user:
            IF user has interacted with items in this category:
                click_weight = 0.2
                purchase_weight = 0.5
                feedback_weight = 0.3
                
                interaction_score += (num_clicks * click_weight) + (num_purchases * purchase_weight) + (num_feedback * feedback_weight)

        # Normalize interaction score to between 0 and 1
        normalized_score = interaction_score / total_interactions  #Where total interactions is the sum of interactions across *all* categories for that user

        #Adjust Category Weight
        category_weight = base_category_weight + (normalized_score * learning_rate)
        category_weight = MAX(category_weight, 0) # Ensure weight doesn't go below 0
        category_weight = MIN(category_weight, 1) # Ensure weight doesn't exceed 1
    END
```

    *   `learning_rate`: A tunable parameter controlling the speed at which weights are adjusted.
    *   The algorithm should account for both positive and negative interactions. Negative feedback should *decrease* the category weight.

3.  **Personalized Category Ranking:**
    *   When presenting items to a user, rank categories based on their *personalized* weights. This means each user will see a different order of categories, tailored to their preferences.
    *   Categories with higher weights are displayed more prominently.

4.  **Hierarchical Weight Propagation:**
    *   The weight adjustment should *propagate* up the category hierarchy.  If a sub-category receives a high weight, its parent categories should also receive a slight increase in weight, reflecting the increased relevance of the broader category.
    *   This ensures that the entire hierarchy adapts to user preferences, not just individual sub-categories.

5.  **A/B Testing Framework:**
    *   Implement an A/B testing framework to evaluate the effectiveness of the dynamic weight adjustment algorithm.
    *   Compare metrics such as click-through rates, purchase conversions, and user engagement between users exposed to the dynamic system and a control group using the static category hierarchy.

6.  **Cold Start Problem Mitigation:**
    *   For new users with no interaction history, use pre-defined category weights based on overall item popularity or demographic data.
    *   As the user interacts with the system, their personalized weights will gradually override the default values.
