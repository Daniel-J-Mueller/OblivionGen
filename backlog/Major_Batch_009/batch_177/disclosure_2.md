## Personalized Query Expansion via Temporal Decay & Semantic Drift

**Concept:** Enhance query expansion beyond simple related query datasets by incorporating a time-sensitive semantic understanding of query relationships. Traditional 'related queries' treat all historical data equally, ignoring how language and user intent evolve. This system aims to create a dynamic query expansion engine that adapts to changing semantic landscapes and individual user behavior over time.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Ingestion & Preprocessing:**

*   **Event Data:** Continue receiving event data as per the original patent (search queries, item selections, user IDs, timestamps).
*   **External Semantic Data:** Integrate access to large language models (LLMs) via API. This is crucial for measuring semantic similarity *and* drift.
*   **Time-Windowing:**  Divide historical data into discrete time windows (e.g., weekly, monthly). Finer granularity may be beneficial, but introduces complexity.
*   **Semantic Embedding Generation:** For each time window, generate semantic embeddings for all search queries and selected items using an LLM. These embeddings represent the *meaning* of the queries/items within that specific time context.

**2.  Temporal Relationship Modeling:**

*   **Similarity Matrix Generation:**  Within each time window, calculate a similarity matrix between all search queries and selected items based on their semantic embeddings. Use cosine similarity or a similar metric.
*   **Temporal Decay Function:** Implement a decay function that reduces the weight of similarity scores from older time windows.  This models the idea that relationships become less relevant over time.  Example:  `Weight = e^(-λ * Δt)`, where `λ` is a decay constant and `Δt` is the time difference between the current time and the time window. The decay constant should be tunable.
*   **Weighted Similarity Aggregation:**  Aggregate the similarity scores across all time windows, weighting them by the temporal decay function. This creates a time-sensitive similarity score for each query-item pair.
*   **User-Specific Weighting:** Introduce user-specific weighting.  Queries and items associated with a user’s *recent* activity receive higher weight in the similarity calculations. This personalization adds a layer of relevance.

**3. Query Expansion Engine:**

*   **Expansion Request:** When a user submits a query, the system retrieves the time-weighted similarity scores for that query.
*   **Candidate Generation:** Identify the top-N most similar queries based on the aggregated scores.
*   **Semantic Filtering:** Use an LLM to assess the semantic coherence between the original query and the candidate expansion queries.  Filter out candidates that are semantically dissimilar or irrelevant.  This prevents the introduction of noise.
*   **Output:** Return the filtered list of expansion queries as suggestions to the user.

**4. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservice Architecture:**  Implement as a set of microservices:
    *   *Data Ingestion Service:* Handles event data ingestion and preprocessing.
    *   *Semantic Embedding Service:*  Generates semantic embeddings using an LLM.
    *   *Temporal Relationship Service:* Calculates time-weighted similarity scores.
    *   *Query Expansion Service:*  Handles query expansion requests and returns suggestions.
*   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to reduce LLM API calls and improve response times.

**Pseudocode (Query Expansion Service):**

```
function expandQuery(userQuery, userId):
  candidateQueries = []
  // Retrieve time-weighted similarity scores
  similarityScores = TemporalRelationshipService.getSimilarityScores(userQuery)

  // Select top-N candidates
  topNCandidates = similarityScores.sortDescending().take(N)

  // Semantic filtering
  for candidate in topNCandidates:
    semanticScore = LLM.getSemanticSimilarity(userQuery, candidate)
    if semanticScore > threshold:
      candidateQueries.append(candidate)

  return candidateQueries
```

**Tunable Parameters:**

*   `λ` (decay constant)
*   `N` (number of candidate queries)
*   `threshold` (semantic similarity threshold)
*   Time window size
*   User activity decay rate (for user-specific weighting)

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Concept Drift Detection:**  Implement algorithms to detect concept drift (sudden changes in query meaning) and automatically adjust the decay constant.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** Extend the system to support multiple languages.
*   **A/B Testing:** Conduct A/B testing to evaluate the effectiveness of different parameters and algorithms.
