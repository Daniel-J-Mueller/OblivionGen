## Dynamic Spectral Reconstruction for UAV Imagery

**Concept:** Expand beyond RGB color reconstruction using selective filters to capture hyperspectral data via rapid, sequential filter wheel operation combined with image stabilization and computational reconstruction. Instead of just capturing R, G, and B, capture a much broader spectrum of light â€“ essentially creating a miniature hyperspectral imager.

**Specs:**

*   **Filter Wheel:** High-speed rotating filter wheel with at least 30 narrow-band filters, each centered on a different wavelength within the visible and near-infrared spectrum (400nm - 1000nm).  Filters constructed from dielectric thin-film stacks for high transmission and narrow bandwidth.  Wheel material: carbon fiber reinforced polymer for lightweight operation.
*   **Image Sensor:**  High-resolution (minimum 64MP) monochrome CMOS sensor with global shutter.  Sensor must have high quantum efficiency across the 400-1000nm range.  Sensor readout speed must be sufficient to capture images at a rate exceeding 30 frames per second.
*   **Stabilization System:** 6-axis gimbal stabilization system with integrated Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and angular velocity sensors.  The gimbal must compensate for UAV movement during filter wheel operation to minimize motion blur. Stabilization accuracy: < 0.01 degrees.
*   **Actuation:** Brushless DC motor driving the filter wheel, controlled by a closed-loop feedback system for precise positioning and speed control. Target rotation speed: 60 RPM.
*   **Processing Unit:** Embedded GPU with dedicated hardware for image processing and computational reconstruction. Minimum specifications: NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX or equivalent.
*   **Data Storage:** High-speed solid-state drive (SSD) with a minimum capacity of 1TB for storing raw hyperspectral data. Write speed > 500 MB/s.

**Operation:**

1.  The UAV initiates a data acquisition sequence.
2.  The filter wheel begins rotating, sequentially positioning each filter in the optical path.
3.  The image sensor captures an image through each filter.
4.  The stabilization system actively compensates for UAV movement during capture.
5.  Raw images are streamed to the processing unit.
6.  **Computational Reconstruction Algorithm:**
    *   **Geometric Correction:** Images are geometrically corrected to remove distortion and align them to a common reference frame.
    *   **Radiometric Calibration:** Raw pixel values are converted to reflectance values using a calibrated reflectance target.
    *   **Spectral Reconstruction:** A spectral reconstruction algorithm (e.g., polynomial interpolation, Gaussian process regression) is used to estimate the full spectral signature for each pixel based on the captured narrowband images.
    *   **Output:**  A hyperspectral data cube is created, representing the spatial and spectral information of the scene.

**Pseudocode (Spectral Reconstruction Algorithm):**

```pseudocode
function reconstruct_spectrum(pixel_data, calibration_data):
  // pixel_data: Array of pixel values from each narrowband filter
  // calibration_data: Reflectance values for known targets at different wavelengths

  // 1. Apply radiometric calibration to pixel data using calibration_data

  // 2. Define a spectral basis function (e.g., polynomial, Gaussian)

  // 3. Fit the spectral basis function to the calibrated pixel data using regression

  // 4. Use the fitted basis function to estimate the full spectrum at each wavelength

  return estimated_spectrum
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Precision agriculture (crop health monitoring)
*   Environmental monitoring (vegetation mapping, water quality assessment)
*   Security and surveillance (target identification)
*   Geological surveys (mineral mapping)
*   Archaeological site investigation (feature detection)
