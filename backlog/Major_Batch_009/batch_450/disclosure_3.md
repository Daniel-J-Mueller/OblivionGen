## Adaptive Mesh for Dynamic Environments

**Concept:** Extend the bridging concept to proactively adapt mesh network topology based on real-time signal strength, device mobility, and network congestion – going beyond static relay assignments. This creates a self-healing, self-optimizing mesh capable of maintaining connectivity in highly dynamic scenarios.

**Specifications:**

**1. Device Roles & Capabilities:**

*   **Node Types:** Define three node types:
    *   *Anchor Nodes:* Stationary, high-power nodes forming the backbone of the mesh.  Prioritize stable connections.
    *   *Relay Nodes:* Mobile or semi-mobile nodes responsible for extending network reach. Adaptive routing is primary function.
    *   *Client Nodes:* End-user devices with limited processing/power.
*   **Proactive Probing:** Each node continuously broadcasts 'heartbeat' signals with RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator) data and estimated mobility vectors (derived from consecutive signal reports).
*   **Neighbor Awareness:** Nodes maintain a dynamic neighbor table, ranked by signal strength, mobility prediction, and link quality (packet loss, latency).

**2. Dynamic Topology Management:**

*   **Centralized Coordinator (Optional):** A designated (or elected) coordinator node analyzes heartbeat data from all nodes. This could be a particularly robust Anchor Node. *Alternative: Distributed Algorithm (see section 3).*
*   **Path Calculation:**
    *   The coordinator (or each node in a distributed system) calculates multiple potential paths between each client node and the network gateway (home AP router).
    *   Path scoring considers: RSSI, estimated link stability (based on mobility vectors), hop count, current network congestion (estimated by monitoring packet loss).
*   **Adaptive Relay Assignment:** Based on path scoring, the system dynamically assigns relay nodes for each client.  Relay assignments are updated at regular intervals (e.g., 1-5 seconds) or triggered by significant changes in network conditions.

**3. Distributed Algorithm (Alternative to Centralized Coordinator):**

*   **Gossip Protocol:** Nodes periodically exchange neighbor information (RSSI, mobility estimates) with a small subset of their neighbors.
*   **Local Path Calculation:** Each node calculates potential paths to the gateway based on the information received from its neighbors.
*   **Consensus Mechanism:** A lightweight consensus protocol (e.g., a form of weighted voting) is used to determine the optimal relay assignments. Nodes prioritize paths recommended by their most trusted neighbors (based on historical reliability).

**4.  Congestion Management:**

*   **QoS Prioritization:** Implement Quality of Service (QoS) prioritization based on application type (e.g., prioritizing voice/video traffic).
*   **Traffic Shaping:**  Dynamically adjust transmission rates and packet scheduling to avoid congestion on critical links.
*   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple available paths to reduce load on individual links.

**5. Implementation Details:**

*   **Network Layer:** Leverage IPv6 for seamless integration with existing networks.
*   **MAC Layer:** Utilize existing 802.11 protocols for wireless communication.
*   **Software Architecture:** Implement a modular software architecture with well-defined interfaces between components.
*   **Programming Languages:** C++, Python.
*   **Pseudocode (Relay Assignment – Simplified):**

```
// Node: RelayNode
// Input: Heartbeat Data from Neighbors
// Output: Assigned Relay Node (or direct connection to gateway)

function assignRelay() {
  bestRelay = null
  bestScore = -1

  for each neighbor in neighbors {
    score = calculateScore(neighbor) // Based on RSSI, mobility, link quality, congestion

    if (score > bestScore) {
      bestScore = score
      bestRelay = neighbor
    }
  }

  if (bestRelay != null && bestScore > threshold) {
    assignRelayNode(bestRelay)
  } else {
    connectDirectlyToGateway()
  }
}

function calculateScore(neighbor) {
  // Combine RSSI, mobility, link quality, and congestion estimates
  // Weighting factors can be tuned to optimize performance
  score = (RSSI_Weight * RSSI) + (Mobility_Weight * (1 - Mobility_Estimate)) + (LinkQuality_Weight * LinkQuality) + (Congestion_Weight * (1 - Congestion_Estimate))
  return score
}
```

**6.  Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Powered Prediction:** Utilize machine learning to predict node mobility and network congestion with greater accuracy.
*   **Beamforming:** Implement beamforming techniques to improve signal strength and reduce interference.
*   **Multi-Radio Support:**  Utilize multiple radios to increase network capacity and improve reliability.
