## Bioacoustic Molecular Profiling - Wearable Ultrasound Array

**Concept:** Shift from radio frequency to focused ultrasound for molecular detection, creating a non-invasive wearable device for continuous, real-time bioacoustic molecular profiling.

**Specs:**

*   **Array Configuration:** 64-element phased array ultrasound transducer, conformable to skin (flexible PCB substrate). Element spacing: 2mm. Frequency range: 5-10 MHz. Each element individually addressable.
*   **Waveform Control:** Custom waveform generation (chirp, coded pulses) for enhanced signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution. Digital beamforming capabilities.
*   **Substrate:** Biocompatible, flexible polymer (e.g., silicone or polyurethane) with integrated microfluidic channels. Channels facilitate contact with skin and potentially local delivery of contrast agents.
*   **Signal Processing Unit:** Integrated ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) for real-time beamforming, signal amplification, and feature extraction.  Data compression and wireless transmission (Bluetooth Low Energy or similar).
*   **Contrast Agents:** Microbubbles functionalized with antibodies or aptamers specific to target molecules (e.g., glucose, lactate, specific proteins, cancer biomarkers).  Concentration of contrast agent would be minimal.
*   **Acoustic Lens:** Integrated micro-acoustic lens to focus ultrasound beam and enhance signal strength. Lens material: biocompatible polymer with high acoustic impedance.

**Operation:**

1.  The phased array transmits focused ultrasound pulses into tissue.
2.  Target molecules, tagged with functionalized microbubbles, resonate at specific frequencies or exhibit unique scattering patterns when interrogated with ultrasound.
3.  The reflected ultrasound signal is received by the phased array.
4.  The ASIC performs beamforming to focus the received signal and extracts features related to the concentration of target molecules.
5.  Features are transmitted wirelessly to a processing unit (smartphone, computer) for analysis and display.

**Pseudocode (Signal Processing):**

```
// Initialize parameters
frequency = 5 MHz;
pulse_duration = 100 ns;
sampling_rate = 50 MHz;

// Acquire raw ultrasound data
raw_data = acquire_ultrasound_data();

// Apply digital beamforming
focused_signal = beamform(raw_data, frequency, element_positions);

// Extract spectral features
power_spectrum = FFT(focused_signal);
resonant_frequencies = identify_resonant_frequencies(power_spectrum);

// Determine molecular concentration
concentration = calculate_concentration(resonant_frequencies, calibration_curve);

// Transmit data
transmit_data(concentration);
```

**Novelty:**

This departs from RF impedance matching and utilizes acoustic impedance & resonance for molecular detection. The system focuses on direct acoustic detection rather than relying on signal phase shifts induced by molecular presence. The wearable array configuration enables continuous, real-time monitoring. Combining microfluidics and functionalized microbubbles allows targeted detection of specific molecules.
