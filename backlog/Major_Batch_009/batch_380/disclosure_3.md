## Communal Device Persona Switching & Predictive Communication

**Concept:** Extend sender/recipient profile disambiguation to enable dynamic "persona" assignment to a communal device. This moves beyond simple identification and allows the device to *adapt* its communication style and content based on inferred user state and predicted needs.

**Specifications:**

**I. Hardware Requirements:**

*   Enhanced microphone array (existing)
*   Low-power auxiliary speaker (for contextual prompts/feedback)
*   Ambient sensor suite (temperature, light, motion – for state inference)
*   Increased onboard processing capability (for real-time analysis & prediction)

**II. Software Modules:**

*   **State Inference Engine:** Analyzes data from the microphone array (speech content, prosody), ambient sensors, and device usage patterns to infer the current "state" of the user. States could include: "focused," "relaxed," "commuting," "presenting," "collaborating," "private time," etc.
*   **Persona Library:** A database containing pre-defined communication "personas." Each persona specifies:
    *   Preferred communication channels (e.g., voice, text, email).
    *   Communication style (e.g., formal, informal, concise, detailed).
    *   Content filtering rules (e.g., prioritize work notifications during “focused” state, suppress social media updates during “private time”).
    *   Automated response templates.
    *   Voice modulation profiles (slight adjustments to tone and cadence).
*   **Predictive Communication Engine:** Leverages user history, scheduling data, and contextual information to *anticipate* communication needs. Examples:
    *   Automatically composing a "running late" message based on calendar events and traffic data.
    *   Proactively surfacing relevant documents or information based on meeting context.
    *   Suggesting potential replies to incoming messages.
*   **Dynamic Persona Assignment Module:**  Selects the most appropriate persona based on the inferred user state and predicted communication needs.  This module manages the seamless switching between personas.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Monitors user interactions (e.g., manual overrides, message edits) to refine the accuracy of state inference and persona selection.

**III. Pseudocode - Dynamic Persona Assignment**

```
FUNCTION AssignPersona(audioData, sensorData, scheduleData, userHistory)

    // 1. State Inference
    userState = InferUserState(audioData, sensorData, userHistory)

    // 2. Predict Communication Need
    predictedNeed = PredictCommunicationNeed(scheduleData, userHistory)

    // 3. Persona Selection
    bestPersona = SelectBestPersona(userState, predictedNeed)

    // 4. Apply Persona
    ApplyPersonaSettings(bestPersona)

    RETURN bestPersona

FUNCTION InferUserState(audioData, sensorData, userHistory)
    // Analyze audio for keywords, sentiment, prosody
    // Analyze sensor data (temperature, light, motion)
    // Analyze past device usage patterns
    // Combine data to infer user state (focused, relaxed, commuting, etc.)
    RETURN inferredState

FUNCTION PredictCommunicationNeed(scheduleData, userHistory)
    // Check calendar for upcoming events
    // Analyze recent communication patterns
    // Anticipate potential communication needs (e.g., reminders, confirmations)
    RETURN predictedNeed

FUNCTION SelectBestPersona(userState, predictedNeed)
    // Iterate through Persona Library
    // Evaluate each Persona based on its suitability for the current userState and predictedNeed
    // Select the Persona with the highest score
    RETURN bestPersona

FUNCTION ApplyPersonaSettings(bestPersona)
    // Configure communication channels (voice, text, email)
    // Adjust communication style (formal, informal, concise, detailed)
    // Apply content filtering rules
    // Load automated response templates
    // Activate voice modulation profile
```

**IV. Novelty:**

This expands beyond simple sender/recipient identification to create a *proactive* and *adaptive* communication experience. It moves the communal device from a passive tool to an intelligent assistant that anticipates user needs and tailors its communication accordingly. The combination of state inference, predictive communication, and dynamic persona assignment is a significant departure from existing technologies.
