## Adaptive Contextual Overlay System

**Concept:** Extend the supplemental information system to become a dynamic, spatially aware overlay projected *onto* the media itself (or its immediate surroundings). Instead of simply *providing* information, the system *integrates* it directly into the user's perception of the content.

**Specs:**

1.  **Hardware:**
    *   Miniature, high-resolution pico-projector integrated into a wearable (glasses, headband, clip-on device).
    *   Wide-angle camera for scene/media capture and spatial mapping.
    *   Depth sensor (LiDAR or similar) for accurate 3D environment reconstruction.
    *   Processing unit (SoC) for real-time image/depth processing, supplemental data retrieval, and projection control.
    *   Wireless communication module (WiFi, Bluetooth) for data access and control.

2.  **Software:**
    *   **Scene Understanding Module:** Analyzes camera feed to identify media (print, screen, physical objects) and its spatial orientation. Utilizes object recognition, edge detection, and feature matching.
    *   **Content Recognition Module:** Leverages OCR, image analysis, and audio fingerprinting to identify specific content *within* the identified media.  This could also include identifying unique identifiers/watermarks.
    *   **Contextual Data Retrieval:**  Accesses supplemental information databases (as in the original patent) *and* external data sources (web APIs, real-time data feeds) based on recognized content.
    *   **Dynamic Overlay Generation:**  Creates a visual overlay that is spatially aligned with the content. This overlay can include:
        *   Textual annotations (definitions, translations, facts).
        *   Graphical elements (charts, diagrams, illustrations).
        *   Interactive elements (buttons, links).
        *   Augmented reality enhancements (3D models, animations).
    *   **Spatial Mapping & Projection Control:**  Uses depth sensor data to create a 3D map of the environment.  Adjusts the projection to compensate for surface irregularities and viewing angles, ensuring accurate alignment of the overlay.
    *   **User Interface (UI):**
        *   Voice control for commands (e.g., "Show me more about this author").
        *   Gesture recognition for interaction with the overlay.
        *   Customization options for overlay appearance and content.
    * **Predictive Information Module:** Analyzes user behavior (gaze tracking, interaction history) to predict what supplemental information the user might be interested in, proactively displaying it.

**Pseudocode (Core Loop):**

```
LOOP:
    CAPTURE_IMAGE_AND_DEPTH_DATA()
    IDENTIFY_MEDIA_TYPE(image_data)
    IF media_type == "print" OR "screen" OR "object":
        RECOGNIZE_CONTENT(image_data)
        GET_SUPPLEMENTAL_DATA(recognized_content)
        GENERATE_OVERLAY(supplemental_data, depth_data)
        PROJECT_OVERLAY()
    ELSE:
        DISPLAY_DEFAULT_INTERFACE()
    MONITOR_USER_INTERACTION()
    UPDATE_CONTEXT_BASED_ON_INTERACTION()
END LOOP
```

**Innovation:**  The system moves beyond simply *providing* information to *augmenting* the user's reality.  The dynamic, spatially aware overlay creates a more immersive and intuitive experience.  The predictive information module enhances usability and anticipates user needs. This differs from the initial patent by being a projection system *onto* the media rather than simply providing supplemental data.
