## Personalized Acoustic Scene Profiles

**Concept:** Expand wakeword detection beyond simple command execution by integrating acoustic scene profiling with user-specific behavioral models. The system learns and anticipates user needs based on *where* and *how* they typically interact with devices, proactively adjusting responsiveness and even suggesting actions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:** Existing microphone array, processor, memory. Addition of a low-power ambient sound sensor (detecting general environment – home, office, car etc.).
*   **Software Modules:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Analyzer:**  Processes ambient sound sensor data and audio input to categorize the current acoustic environment (e.g., ‘quiet office’, ‘busy street’, ‘living room with TV’). Uses a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction and classification.  Output: Scene label with confidence score.
    *   **Behavioral Modeler:** Tracks user interactions (wakeword activations, commands issued, time of day, location data if available).  Employs a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to predict likely user intents based on historical data, current acoustic scene, and time of day.  Stores data in a user profile.
    *   **Adaptive Wakeword Sensitivity:** Dynamically adjusts the wakeword detection threshold based on the Behavioral Model's prediction and the Acoustic Scene Analyzer's output. Higher sensitivity in predicted intent scenarios, lower sensitivity in noisy environments or when intent is unlikely.
    *   **Proactive Suggestion Engine:** Based on the Behavioral Model's prediction, proactively displays relevant suggestions on a connected display or through voice output *before* the user initiates a command. For example, in a 'car' scene and at 8:00 AM, suggest "Navigate to Work?" or "Play Morning Playlist?".
    *   **Contextual Command Expansion:**  Expands simple commands based on context. "Turn on the lights" in a 'living room' scene automatically activates the living room lights; in a 'bedroom' scene, activates bedroom lights.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Wakeword Sensitivity):**

```
function adjust_wakeword_sensitivity(acoustic_scene, predicted_intent, current_sensitivity):
    # Weights can be tuned based on testing.
    scene_weight = 0.2
    intent_weight = 0.6
    base_weight = 0.2

    # Lookup scene modifier
    if acoustic_scene == "noisy_environment":
        scene_modifier = -0.3  # Reduce sensitivity
    else:
        scene_modifier = 0.1   # Slight increase

    # Lookup intent modifier
    if predicted_intent == "high_probability":
        intent_modifier = 0.4  # Increase sensitivity
    else:
        intent_modifier = -0.2 # Decrease

    new_sensitivity = current_sensitivity * (1 + (scene_weight * scene_modifier) + (intent_weight * intent_modifier) + base_weight)

    #Clamp values
    if new_sensitivity > 1.0:
       new_sensitivity = 1.0
    if new_sensitivity < 0.1:
       new_sensitivity = 0.1

    return new_sensitivity
```

**Data Storage:**

*   User Profiles: Store historical interaction data, preferred settings, and learned behavioral patterns.
*   Acoustic Scene Database: Pre-recorded sound samples for various environments to train the Acoustic Scene Analyzer.
*   Command-Context Mappings: Database mapping commands to specific contexts (e.g., “lights on” -> “living room”, “bedroom”).
