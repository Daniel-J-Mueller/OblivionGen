**Holographic Gesture Mapping with Dynamic Focal Planes**

**System Specs:**

*   **Display:** Passive display medium as described in patent 9195127.
*   **IR Emitters:** Array of micro-IR LED projectors. Each LED has individually controllable intensity and focal length. Resolution: 2000 LEDs per square meter. Wavelength: 850nm.
*   **IR Cameras:** Array of high-speed, low-light IR cameras. Resolution: 2048x1536 pixels. Frame rate: 240Hz. Synchronized with IR emitters. Minimum 6 cameras.
*   **Depth Sensor:** Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor integrated with the IR camera array for coarse depth mapping.
*   **Processing Unit:** High-performance GPU and CPU cluster for real-time image processing and gesture recognition.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Calibration Module:** Automatically calibrates the IR emitter/camera array and the display medium.
    *   **Gesture Recognition Engine:** Deep learning model trained on a vast dataset of hand gestures and facial expressions. Supports custom gesture definitions.
    *   **Holographic Projection Engine:** Renders virtual objects and interfaces based on detected gestures and depth data.
    *   **Dynamic Focal Plane Control:** Algorithm to adjust the focal length of individual IR LEDs based on the distance to the user’s hands/face, creating a sharp holographic projection.

**Innovation Description:**

This system expands upon the core concept of infrared-based gesture recognition by incorporating holographic projection. Instead of simply detecting gestures and triggering actions, this system *projects* interactive holographic interfaces directly into the space in front of the display medium.

**Operational Sequence:**

1.  **Depth Mapping:** The ToF sensor provides a coarse depth map of the area in front of the display.
2.  **Hand/Face Tracking:** IR cameras track the user’s hands and/or face, precisely mapping their position and orientation.
3.  **Dynamic IR Projection:** The system calculates the optimal focal length for each IR LED to project a focused holographic image onto the user’s hands/face or into the space around them. This allows for the creation of "floating" holographic buttons, sliders, or other interactive elements.
4.  **Gesture Recognition:** The gesture recognition engine analyzes the user’s hand movements and/or facial expressions.
5.  **Holographic Interface Update:** Based on the recognized gesture, the system updates the holographic interface in real-time, providing visual feedback to the user.
6.  **Action Execution:** The system executes the corresponding action based on the recognized gesture and the context of the holographic interface.

**Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization
CalibrateIRArray()
LoadGestureModel()

//Main Loop
CaptureIRImages()
GetDepthMap()
TrackHands()
TrackFace()

Gesture = RecognizeGesture(HandData, FaceData)

If Gesture == "OpenHand":
    ProjectHolographicButton(HandPosition)
Else If Gesture == "SwipeLeft":
    MoveHolographicSlider(HandPosition)
Else If Gesture == "Smile":
    AuthenticateUser()

UpdateHolographicInterface(Gesture)

RenderHolographicInterface()
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Immersive gaming and entertainment
*   Interactive education and training
*   Advanced user interfaces for smart homes and vehicles
*   Remote collaboration and telepresence
*   Accessibility solutions for people with disabilities.
