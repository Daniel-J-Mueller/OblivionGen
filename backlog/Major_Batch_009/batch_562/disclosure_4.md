**Dynamic In-Game Item "Echo" System**

**Concept:** Extend the spectating system to allow viewers to temporarily "echo" in-game items onto the broadcaster's screen, creating visual and potentially minor gameplay effects. This isn't *giving* the item, but projecting a temporary, ghostly version of it into the broadcaster's reality.

**Specs:**

*   **Item Database Integration:** The spectating system accesses a detailed database of all in-game items, including 3D models, visual effects, and associated gameplay data (even if the effects are minimal in this echo state).
*   **Echo Request Mechanism:** Spectator UI provides an "Echo" button/interface for selectable items (filtered by game context/broadcaster preference settings).  Cost associated with echoing item (virtual currency, watch time commitment, etc.).
*   **Echo Projection System:**  Upon request, the system sends data to the broadcaster's game client to render a semi-transparent, ghostly version of the selected item.  Rendering priority is low to avoid impacting performance.
*   **Broadcaster Control:**  Broadcaster has settings to:
    *   Enable/disable "Echo" requests.
    *   Filter which items can be echoed.
    *   Adjust the visual prominence of echoed items (transparency, scale, glow).
    *   Set a cooldown period for echo requests.
*   **Echo Effects:** The echo item has limited interaction.
    *   Visual only: Primarily a cosmetic effect.
    *   Minor Physics:  Echo items might have very basic physics (float, bounce) but cannot significantly obstruct gameplay.
    *   Visual Feedback:  Echo item emits a faint glow or particle effect visible to both broadcaster and spectators.
*   **Echo Duration & Decay:** Echo items have a defined duration (e.g., 5-15 seconds). After duration, item fades out smoothly.
*   **Spectator Visualization:** Spectators see the echoed item rendered *on the broadcaster’s screen* from the broadcaster’s perspective. This creates a shared visual experience.
*   **Echo "Stacking" Limit:** Limit the number of simultaneously active echoed items to prevent visual clutter.
*   **API Integration:** Extend existing API to allow game developers to define echo-specific properties for items (e.g., echo color, particle effects, allowable physics interactions).

**Pseudocode (Spectator Side):**

```
function onItemEchoRequest(itemID):
  if (hasSufficientFunds() && !isEchoOnCooldown()):
    sendEchoRequestToSpectatingSystem(itemID)
    startEchoCooldownTimer()

function onEchoRequestConfirmation(itemID):
  //Visual feedback for successful request

function onEchoExpired(itemID):
  //Remove visual echo from spectator view
```

**Pseudocode (Broadcaster Side - Game Client):**

```
function onReceiveEchoRequest(itemID):
  if (isValidEchoRequest(itemID)):
    createEchoItemInstance(itemID)
    //Render the echo item with low priority

function updateEchoItems():
  //Update position/rotation of active echo items
  //Check for echo item expiry and remove if necessary
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple item display or virtual gifting. It creates a direct, visual interaction between spectators and the broadcaster’s gameplay, adding a layer of shared experience and potentially new forms of entertainment or even strategic gameplay. It's not *changing* the game for the broadcaster, it's augmenting their view *with* spectator input.
