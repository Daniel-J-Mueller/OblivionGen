## Automated Query Mutation via Generative Grammars

**Specification:** A system to automatically generate semantically valid, yet structurally diverse, database queries for fuzz testing, leveraging generative grammars and reinforcement learning.

**Core Concept:** Instead of randomly mutating existing queries (as the provided patent suggests), the system *constructs* queries from scratch, guided by a generative grammar specific to the target database query language (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).  This allows for a wider exploration of the query space and creation of queries that might not be reachable through simple mutation.

**Components:**

1.  **Query Language Grammar:** A formal grammar (e.g., Backus-Naur Form) defining the syntax of the target query language. This serves as the blueprint for query generation.

2.  **Generative Model:** A probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) or a more advanced generative model (e.g., Transformer-based) trained on a corpus of valid queries.  This model learns the probability distribution of different query structures and elements.

3.  **Reinforcement Learning Agent:** An agent that interacts with the database and receives rewards/penalties based on the database's behavior. The agent’s objective is to maximize the database’s exposure to edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.

4.  **Test Data Generator:**  A module to generate test data that serves as input to the generated queries.  This could leverage the randomization techniques described in the provided patent but should be decoupled from the query generation process.

**Workflow:**

1.  **Initialization:** The system is initialized with the query language grammar, the generative model, and a set of initial test data.

2.  **Query Generation:** The reinforcement learning agent uses the generative model to construct a new query.  The agent can influence the query generation process by adjusting the probabilities in the generative model.

3.  **Execution and Monitoring:** The generated query is executed against the database using the generated test data. The system monitors the database's behavior for errors, performance bottlenecks, or unexpected results.

4.  **Reward Assignment:** A reward signal is assigned to the agent based on the database's behavior. Rewards could be assigned for:
    *   Discovering new code paths in the database.
    *   Triggering exceptions or errors.
    *   Causing performance degradation.
    *   Exposing inconsistencies in the data.

5.  **Model Update:** The reinforcement learning agent updates the generative model based on the received reward signal. This allows the agent to learn which query structures are most effective at exposing vulnerabilities.

6.  **Iteration:** Steps 2-5 are repeated iteratively to generate a diverse set of queries and maximize the database’s exposure to edge cases.



**Pseudocode (Agent Query Generation):**

```
function generate_query(state, generative_model):
  query_tree = generative_model.sample(state) // Sample a query structure
  populate_query_tree(query_tree, test_data) // Fill the tree with data
  query = convert_tree_to_query_string(query_tree) // Convert to a valid query
  return query

function populate_query_tree(tree, test_data):
  // Recursively populate the tree nodes with values from test_data
  // Example: Replace placeholders like {column_name} with actual column names
  // and {value} with values from the test data.

function convert_tree_to_query_string(tree):
  // Traverse the tree and construct a valid query string.
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond simple mutation of existing queries to *construct* queries from scratch, allowing for a much wider exploration of the query space. The use of reinforcement learning to guide the query generation process enables the system to adapt and learn which query structures are most effective at exposing vulnerabilities.  The generative grammar ensures the creation of syntactically valid, yet structurally diverse, queries. This differs from the provided patent by *creating* queries rather than simply modifying them, and employing machine learning to guide query construction instead of relying solely on randomization.
