## Dynamic Content-Aware Encoding Profiles

**Concept:** Extend the dynamic compute allocation to also dynamically adjust encoding *profiles* (codec, bitrate ladder, resolution scaling) *per rendition* based on real-time content analysis and predicted viewer engagement. This goes beyond simply shifting compute *within* a fixed set of profiles; it actively *creates* and optimizes profiles on the fly.

**Specs:**

**1. Content Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Live video stream.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Scene Detection:** Identify scene changes, shot types (static, pan, zoom), and motion vectors.
    *   **Object Recognition:** Detect prominent objects and activities within the frame (people, cars, text, etc.). Utilize a pre-trained (but adaptable) neural network.
    *   **Content Complexity Metric:** Calculate a “complexity score” based on the above.  Higher scores indicate more visually complex scenes, requiring higher bitrates for acceptable quality.
    *   **Audio Analysis:** Analyze audio for speech, music, silence, and sound events. Associate audio complexity with visual complexity.
*   **Output:**  Real-time content complexity score and associated metadata.

**2. Viewer Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Content complexity score, historical viewer engagement data (watch time, skip rate, resolution preference) for similar content, current time of day/week, viewer location (coarse-grained).
*   **Process:** Employ a machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network) to predict viewer engagement for each rendition (resolution/bitrate) based on input data.  Specifically, predict:
    *   **Optimal Resolution:**  The resolution most likely to maximize engagement.
    *   **Bitrate Ladder Preference:**  The preferred bitrate range for the predicted resolution.
*   **Output:**  Predicted optimal resolution and bitrate preferences for each rendition.

**3. Dynamic Profile Generation Module:**

*   **Input:** Predicted optimal resolution/bitrate preferences, content complexity score, available compute resources.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Profile Creation:** Generate a unique encoding profile for each rendition based on predicted preferences and content complexity.  This includes:
        *   **Codec Selection:** (e.g., AV1, H.265, H.264) based on device compatibility and bandwidth constraints.
        *   **Resolution Scaling:** Apply appropriate scaling algorithms to achieve target resolutions.
        *   **Bitrate Ladder:** Construct a bitrate ladder tailored to the content and predicted engagement.
        *   **GOP Structure:** Dynamically adjust GOP size based on scene changes and motion.
        *   **Quantization Parameters:** Fine-tune quantization parameters to balance quality and bitrate.
    *   **Compute Allocation:** Allocate compute resources to each encoder based on the complexity of the assigned rendition profile. More complex profiles require more compute.
*   **Output:**  Optimized encoding profiles and allocated compute resources for each rendition.

**4. Encoding & Transmission:**

*   Parallel real-time encoding using generated profiles.
*   Transmission of encoded renditions to viewer devices.
*   **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor viewer behavior (resolution switching, buffering) and adjust profiles/compute allocation in real-time to optimize engagement.



**Pseudocode (Dynamic Profile Generation):**

```
function generateProfile(contentComplexity, predictedPreferences, availableCompute):
  codec = selectCodec(predictedPreferences.deviceCompatibility)
  resolution = predictedPreferences.optimalResolution
  bitrateLadder = constructBitrateLadder(predictedPreferences.bitratePreferences, contentComplexity)
  gopSize = calculateGopSize(contentComplexity)
  quantizationParams = tuneQuantization(contentComplexity)

  profile = {
    codec: codec,
    resolution: resolution,
    bitrateLadder: bitrateLadder,
    gopSize: gopSize,
    quantizationParams: quantizationParams
  }
  computeAllocation = calculateCompute(profile.resolution, profile.bitrateLadder, profile.gopSize)
  return profile, computeAllocation
```
