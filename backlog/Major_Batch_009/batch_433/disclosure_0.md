## Adaptive Resource Claiming with Predictive Failure Analysis

**System Specifications:**

*   **Components:** Control Plane, Resource Hosts (compute, storage, network), Predictive Failure Analysis (PFA) Module, Dynamic Claim Adjustment (DCA) Module, Monitoring Agent (on each Resource Host).
*   **Data Stores:** Permission Store (as in the provided patent), Resource Host Health Store, Historical Failure Data, Workload Profiles.

**Innovation Description:**

The core idea is to augment the optimistic permission granting system with *proactive* failure prediction. Instead of simply granting permission and reacting to failures, this system anticipates potential resource host issues and dynamically adjusts claims *before* they impact workload availability.

**Detailed Specifications:**

1.  **PFA Module:**
    *   Continuously monitors Resource Host Health Store data (CPU load, memory utilization, disk I/O, network latency, error logs).
    *   Employs machine learning models (time series analysis, anomaly detection) trained on Historical Failure Data to predict potential resource host failures with a confidence score.  The models will be workload-aware, factoring in the type of workload currently hosted.
    *   Outputs a "Failure Risk Score" for each resource host.

2.  **Dynamic Claim Adjustment (DCA) Module:**
    *   Listens for Failure Risk Scores from the PFA Module.
    *   If a resource host’s Failure Risk Score exceeds a configurable threshold:
        *   **Proactive Claim Transfer:** The DCA module initiates a transfer of permission for any hosted computing resources to another available resource host.  This happens *before* an actual failure occurs.
        *   **Workload Migration:**  The DCA coordinates the migration of workloads from the at-risk host to the new host.  This will employ a 'live migration' strategy where possible.
        *   **Permission Update:** The Permission Store is updated to reflect the new host's permission.
        *   **Monitoring Agent Integration:** The Monitoring Agent on the at-risk host signals a 'preparing for shutdown' state, allowing for graceful workload unloading.

3.  **Permission Store Enhancement:**
    *   Add a "Failure Risk Score" attribute to each resource host entry.
    *   Include a "Preferred Migration Target" attribute – pre-configured based on network proximity, capacity, and workload compatibility.

4.  **Control Plane Integration:**
    *   The Control Plane must incorporate logic to prioritize permission granting based on Failure Risk Score.  Hosts with lower risk scores are preferred.
    *   The Control Plane needs to manage the increased complexity of dynamic claim adjustments, ensuring consistency and avoiding conflicts.

**Pseudocode (DCA Module):**

```
function assess_resource_risk(resource_host):
    risk_score = get_failure_risk_score(resource_host)
    if risk_score > risk_threshold:
        return True
    else:
        return False

function migrate_workload(resource_host):
    preferred_target = get_preferred_migration_target(resource_host)
    if preferred_target is available:
        transfer_permission(resource_host, preferred_target)
        live_migrate_workloads(resource_host, preferred_target)
        update_permission_store(resource_host, preferred_target)
        signal_shutdown_prep(resource_host)
    else:
        log_migration_failure(resource_host)

function main_loop():
    for each resource_host in resource_host_list:
        if assess_resource_risk(resource_host):
            migrate_workload(resource_host)
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced downtime due to proactive failure mitigation.
*   Improved workload availability and resilience.
*   Optimized resource utilization – avoids wasting resources on potentially failing hosts.
*   Increased automation – reduces the need for manual intervention in failure scenarios.
