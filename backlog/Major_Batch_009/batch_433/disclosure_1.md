## Dynamic Authentication via Bioacoustic Signature

**Concept:** Expand the ‘secure network’ component of the patent beyond telephone keypads to incorporate real-time bioacoustic authentication layered *within* the existing phone call. Instead of *just* verifying the full credit card number, verify *who* is speaking.

**Specs:**

1.  **Bioacoustic Profile Creation:** Upon initial account setup, the system prompts the customer to record a short phrase (“My account is secure,” for example) three times.  A dedicated algorithm analyzes these recordings for unique vocal characteristics (pitch, timbre, speech patterns, micro-pauses). This creates a baseline ‘bioacoustic signature’ stored securely.
2.  **Real-time Analysis Module:** Integrated within the automated attendant system (44), a real-time audio analysis module constantly monitors the incoming audio stream during the credit card verification call.
3.  **Feature Extraction:** The module extracts the same vocal characteristics used for profile creation (pitch, timbre, speech patterns) from the live audio.
4.  **Signature Comparison:** A similarity score is calculated by comparing the live audio features to the stored bioacoustic signature.  This comparison must exceed a pre-defined threshold to proceed.
5.  **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment:** The similarity threshold isn’t static.  It dynamically adjusts based on factors like background noise, call quality, and the age of the stored bioacoustic signature (signatures degrade over time). Machine learning algorithms analyze past successful and failed authentications to refine the threshold.
6.  **Multi-Factor Integration:**  Bioacoustic authentication acts as *one* factor.  It’s combined with the credit card number verification.  Successful bioacoustic verification lowers the required accuracy for credit card number matching (allowing for minor errors), and vice versa.
7.  **Challenge-Response Protocol:** If the initial bioacoustic verification score is marginal, the system initiates a challenge-response sequence. It asks the customer to repeat a randomly generated phrase (“Confirm code 729”). The system analyzes the response for consistency with the stored signature.
8.  **Anomaly Detection:** The system actively monitors for anomalies in the audio stream—unusual pauses, changes in voice characteristics—that might indicate fraud.
9.  **Fallback Mechanism:** If bioacoustic verification fails, the system seamlessly falls back to the existing keypad-based authentication.
10. **Optional Integration with Voice Assistants:**  Extend the system to allow bioacoustic verification through voice assistants (Alexa, Google Assistant).  The customer could initiate the verification process through the assistant, providing an additional layer of security.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Upon Account Creation
function createBioacousticProfile(audioRecordings) {
  features = extractVocalFeatures(audioRecordings);
  storeProfile(features);
}

// During Verification Call
function verifyCaller(audioStream) {
  features = extractVocalFeatures(audioStream);
  similarityScore = compareFeatures(features, storedProfile);

  if (similarityScore > threshold) {
    return true; // Authentication successful
  } else {
    // Challenge-Response
    challengePhrase = generateRandomPhrase();
    promptCaller(challengePhrase);
    challengeAudio = receiveAudio();
    challengeFeatures = extractVocalFeatures(challengeAudio);
    challengeSimilarity = compareFeatures(challengeFeatures, storedProfile);

    if (challengeSimilarity > challengeThreshold) {
        return true;
    }
  }
  return false; // Authentication failed
}
