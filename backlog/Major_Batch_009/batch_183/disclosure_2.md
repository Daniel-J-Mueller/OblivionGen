## Acoustic Scene Composition

**Concept:** Expand the audio-triggered command system to not just *respond* to sounds, but to *compose* acoustic scenes based on detected sounds, creating dynamic, responsive environments. Think beyond single commands to layered auditory experiences.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** Acoustic Scene Engine (ASE) – Software module responsible for scene composition and management.
*   **Input:** Microphone array (similar to patent's beamforming focus).
*   **Sound Profile Database:** Expansive library of sound events categorized by type (ambient, transient, alert, musical).  Includes metadata: volume, frequency range, spatial characteristics, and ‘emotional’ tagging (calm, urgent, playful).  Database is user-customizable and expandable.
*   **Scene Templates:** Pre-defined or user-created scene templates.  A template defines a set of sound events and their relationships (e.g., “Forest Ambience” – birdsong, wind rustling leaves, distant stream).  Templates also define rules for sound event layering and spatialization.
*   **Trigger Sounds:**  As in the patent, specific sounds initiate actions. However, instead of executing a single command, trigger sounds *select* and *layer* scene templates.
*   **Dynamic Layering:**  The ASE manages multiple audio layers. Trigger sounds add, remove, or modify layers based on the trigger sound and pre-defined rules.  Layers are spatialized using beamforming data for realistic soundscapes.
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Integrate with external data sources (time of day, weather, user activity, smart home sensors). This data modifies scene composition (e.g., rain sounds intensify during actual rain, ambient sounds change based on time of day).
*   **User Profiles & Personalization:**  User profiles store preferences for scene templates, trigger sounds, and volume levels.  The ASE adapts to individual user preferences.
*   **Sound Event Synthesis:**  Ability to synthesize missing sound events using text-to-speech or generative audio models. This allows for greater customization and dynamic scene creation.
*   **Spatial Audio Rendering:**  Employ advanced spatial audio rendering techniques (Ambisonics, HRTF) for immersive 3D soundscapes.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialize ASE with sound profile database, scene templates, user profiles

function processAudio(audioData, direction) {

    // Detect dominant sound event using acoustic signature matching

    dominantSound = detectSound(audioData)

    if (dominantSound == "birdsong") {

        // Select "Forest Ambience" scene template

        activateScene("Forest Ambience", direction)

    } else if (dominantSound == "doorbell") {

        // Add "Alert" layer to current scene

        addLayer("Alert", direction)

    } else if (dominantSound == "speech") {

        // Analyze speech for intent using NLP

        intent = analyzeSpeech(audioData)

        if (intent == "play music") {

            // Add "Music" layer to current scene

            addLayer("Music", direction)

        }

    }

    // Adjust layer volumes and spatialization based on context

    adjustSceneContext()

    // Render and output audio

    renderAudio()

}
```

**Possible Applications:**

*   **Smart Homes:** Create immersive and responsive home environments.
*   **Gaming:** Enhance game audio with dynamic soundscapes.
*   **Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality:** Create realistic and engaging audio experiences.
*   **Therapeutic Environments:** Design calming or stimulating soundscapes for therapy or relaxation.
*   **Accessibility:**  Provide auditory cues and information for visually impaired users.
