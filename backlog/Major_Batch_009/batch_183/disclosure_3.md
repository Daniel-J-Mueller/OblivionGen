## Adaptive Ultrasonic Phasing for Targeted Presence Detection

**Concept:** Instead of relying solely on Doppler shift analysis of reflected ultrasonic signals, this system dynamically phases the emitted ultrasonic signal to create constructive and destructive interference patterns. This allows for *targeted* presence detection – not just detecting *that* something is moving, but *where* it is moving within the detection volume.

**Specs:**

*   **Ultrasonic Array:** Utilize a phased array of ultrasonic transducers (minimum 16, optimally 64+) instead of a single loudspeaker. Each transducer should be individually addressable. Frequency range: 20kHz - 96kHz.
*   **Microphone Array:** Implement a corresponding microphone array (minimum 8, optimally 32+) positioned to capture reflected signals. Array geometry should mirror, but not perfectly overlap, the ultrasonic transducer array.
*   **Signal Processing Unit:** High-performance processor with dedicated DSP capabilities.
*   **Real-Time Beamforming:** Software algorithms to perform real-time beamforming on both the transmitted and received ultrasonic signals.  Algorithms prioritize spatial resolution over maximum range.
*   **Phase Modulation:**  Employ a rapid, cyclical phase modulation scheme for the transmitted ultrasonic signal. Modulation frequency adjustable between 100Hz and 1kHz.
*   **Interference Mapping:**  Software algorithms to analyze the received signal and construct an ‘interference map’ representing the relative signal strength at different points in the detection volume. Constructive interference peaks indicate potential object locations.
*   **Movement Tracking:** Utilize Kalman filtering or similar tracking algorithms to smooth the interference map and predict object trajectories.
*   **Adaptive Phase Shifting:** Implement an algorithm which adjusts the phase of the ultrasonic array in response to detected movement. The goal is to maintain consistent constructive/destructive interference, sharpening the resolution and tracking accuracy.

**Pseudocode (Core Algorithm):**

```
//Initialization
Define Array Geometry (Transducers, Microphones)
Set Initial Phase Shifts (evenly distributed)
Set Modulation Frequency

//Main Loop
For Each Time Step:
    //Transmit
    Apply Phase Modulation to Transmit Array
    Emit Ultrasonic Signal

    //Receive
    Capture Signal from Microphone Array

    //Process
    Calculate Interference Map (based on signal strength)
    Identify Potential Object Locations (peaks in Interference Map)

    //Track
    Apply Kalman Filter to Predicted Object Trajectories

    //Adapt
    Calculate Phase Shift Corrections (based on tracked movement)
    Apply Corrections to Transmit Array Phase Shifts

    Output Object Locations and Trajectories
```

**Innovation Details:**

This moves beyond simple presence detection by creating a 'spatial fingerprint' of the environment. The adaptive phasing dynamically adjusts the ultrasonic beams, improving tracking accuracy and reducing false positives. The system could potentially "see" around obstacles by intelligently steering the ultrasonic beams.  The interference map creates a visual representation of object locations which can be interpreted by the system, or presented to a user.
