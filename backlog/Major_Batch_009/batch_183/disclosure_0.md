## Key Fob - Biofeedback Integration

**Concept:** Integrate biometric sensors into the key fob to personalize vehicle access and settings based on driver state.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Maintain approximate size/shape of standard key fob (5cm x 3cm x 1.5cm). Housing material: Durable polycarbonate with textured grip.
*   **Sensors:**
    *   Capacitive Stress Sensor (integrated into grip area): Detects grip pressure – indicative of stress/anxiety levels. Resolution: +/- 1g force. Sampling Rate: 10Hz.
    *   Photoplethysmography (PPG) Sensor (contact points on side of fob, activated by thumb/finger contact): Measures heart rate variability (HRV). Wavelength: 525nm (Green). Sampling Rate: 50Hz.
    *   Temperature Sensor (integrated into fob housing): Detects skin temperature – contributes to stress/health assessment. Resolution: +/- 0.1°C.
*   **Microcontroller:** Low-power ARM Cortex-M4 with integrated Bluetooth 5.0. Flash Memory: 256KB. RAM: 64KB.
*   **Communication:** Secure Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connection to vehicle’s central computer. Encrypted communication protocol.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable Li-Po battery (100mAh). Wireless charging capability (Qi standard). Estimated battery life: 7 days (typical use).
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   Real-time data processing of sensor readings.
    *   Stress/Anxiety Level Calculation: Algorithm based on grip pressure, HRV, and skin temperature. Scale: 1-10 (1=Relaxed, 10=Highly Stressed).
    *   Personalized Vehicle Settings Adjustment:
        *   If Stress Level > 7: Adjust cabin lighting to calming colors, activate ambient noise cancellation, reduce HVAC fan speed, and suggest relaxing music playlist.
        *   If Stress Level < 3: Increase cabin temperature, activate invigorating music playlist.
    *   Driver Authentication: Combine biometric data with key fob’s existing security features for enhanced access control.
    *   Data Logging (optional): Securely store biometric data for trend analysis (user-controlled privacy settings).
*   **User Interface:** Single multi-color LED indicator for status (pairing, battery level, stress level). Haptic feedback for confirmation of actions.
*   **Security:** Secure bootloader. Data encryption. Tamper detection.



**Pseudocode (Vehicle Integration - simplified):**

```
// Vehicle receives data from key fob via BLE

function receiveKeyFobData(data) {
  stressLevel = data.stressLevel;
  heartRate = data.heartRate;

  if (stressLevel > 7) {
    setCalmingCabinMode(); //Dim lights, reduce fan speed, play calming music
  } else if (stressLevel < 3) {
    setInvigoratingCabinMode(); //Increase temperature, play upbeat music
  }

  //Validate key fob data with existing security systems

  if (data.keyFobID == validKeyFobID && data.encryption == validEncryption) {
    unlockVehicle();
  } else {
    displayError("Invalid Key Fob");
  }
}
