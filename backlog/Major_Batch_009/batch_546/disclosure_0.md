## Dynamic Knowledge Graph Enrichment via Temporal Reasoning

**Concept:** Extend the entity and relationship detection system with a dynamic knowledge graph (DKG) that incorporates temporal reasoning. The system will not only *detect* entities and relationships, but also *evolve* its understanding of them over time based on incoming unstructured text.

**Specifications:**

**1. Temporal Data Structure:**

*   **DKG Node:** Each entity in the DKG will have a “validity period” attribute (start timestamp, end timestamp). If no explicit end timestamp is present, assume “present”.
*   **DKG Edge:** Relationships between entities will also have validity periods.  A relationship can be *established*, *modified*, or *revoked* over time.
*   **Version Control:** All DKG updates (node/edge creation, modification, revocation) are versioned. This allows for audit trails and rollback capabilities.

**2. Temporal Reasoning Module:**

*   **TimeML Integration:**  Parse unstructured text using TimeML (or a similar temporal annotation framework) to extract temporal expressions (dates, durations, events).
*   **Event Sequencing:** Identify event sequences within the text.  For example, "Patient took medication X on Monday, and symptoms improved on Wednesday." This establishes a temporal precedence relationship.
*   **Hypothetical Reasoning:**  Handle conditional statements.  "If the patient experiences fever, administer drug Y."  This creates a hypothetical relationship within the DKG.
*   **Causality Detection:** Utilize statistical methods (e.g., Granger causality) on the temporal data to identify potential causal relationships between entities.  *Note:  Correlation does not equal causation, and this module should only provide *potential* causal links for human review.*

**3.  Integration with Existing System:**

*   **Modified Request Flow:**  The service receives unstructured text and sends it to the standard entity/relationship detection pipeline.  *Additionally*, the text is sent to the Temporal Reasoning Module.
*   **DKG Update API:** The Temporal Reasoning Module generates DKG update requests (create, modify, revoke) based on the extracted temporal information.
*   **DKG Storage:** A dedicated graph database (e.g., Neo4j, JanusGraph) stores the DKG.
*   **Result Enhancement:** The service enriches the results with temporal information from the DKG.  For example:
    *   “Medication X was prescribed to Patient Y from 2023-01-15 to 2023-06-30.”
    *   “Symptom Z was reported by Patient Y on 2023-05-20 and resolved on 2023-05-25.”
    *   Confidence scores for temporal accuracy.

**4. Pseudocode - Temporal Reasoning Module:**

```pseudocode
function process_text(text):
  temporal_expressions = extract_temporal_expressions(text) // Using TimeML or similar
  events = extract_events(text)

  for event in events:
    event_timestamp = resolve_event_timestamp(event, temporal_expressions)
    entity1 = event.subject
    relation = event.predicate
    entity2 = event.object

    // Check if the relation already exists in the DKG
    existing_relation = find_relation(entity1, relation, entity2)

    if existing_relation:
      // Update the validity period if necessary
      if event_timestamp > existing_relation.end_timestamp:
        existing_relation.end_timestamp = event_timestamp
    else:
      // Create a new relation in the DKG
      create_relation(entity1, relation, entity2, event_timestamp)
```

**5.  Output Format (Enhanced Result):**

```json
{
  "entities": [
    {"name": "Medication X", "type": "Medication"},
    {"name": "Patient Y", "type": "Patient"}
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {
      "type": "prescribed",
      "subject": "Patient Y",
      "object": "Medication X",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "validity_start": "2023-01-15",
      "validity_end": "2023-06-30"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Novelty:**  This approach goes beyond static entity and relationship detection by introducing a *temporal dimension*.  The dynamic knowledge graph allows the system to track changes in entities and relationships over time, providing a more complete and accurate understanding of the unstructured text. This opens up possibilities for trend analysis, predictive modeling, and personalized healthcare.
