## Dynamic Acoustic Scene Reconstruction & Predictive Filtering

**Concept:** Expand noise suppression beyond reactive filtering to *proactive* filtering by reconstructing the acoustic environment in real-time and predicting future noise sources. This leverages spatial audio rendering techniques and machine learning to create a "virtual soundscape" which is then used to anticipate and suppress interfering sounds *before* they reach the microphone.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Minimum 4-microphone array (spatial positioning crucial).
    *   Dedicated Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for real-time scene reconstruction and prediction.
    *   High-bandwidth data connection for potential cloud-based model updates and training.

*   **Software:**
    *   **Acoustic Scene Reconstruction Module:**
        *   Input: Raw microphone array data.
        *   Process: Utilizes beamforming, sound source localization (SSL), and machine learning (Convolutional Neural Networks – CNNs – preferred) to build a 3D map of the acoustic environment. This map includes identified sound sources (speech, music, traffic, etc.), their location, and estimated intensity.  The map isn't just static; it tracks movement and changes over time.
        *   Output: Dynamic 3D acoustic scene map.
    *   **Predictive Filtering Module:**
        *   Input: Dynamic 3D acoustic scene map, historical acoustic data, and user-defined preferences (e.g., prioritize speech, suppress traffic).
        *   Process: Uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN – LSTM or GRU) to predict the future state of the acoustic scene. This prediction includes anticipating the movement of sound sources, the appearance of new sources, and changes in intensity. The system calculates a "noise anticipation profile" representing the predicted noise levels at each microphone.  A spatial filter is then designed *proactively* based on this anticipation profile. This proactive filter is applied *before* the predicted noise arrives.
        *   Output:  Proactive spatial filter coefficients.
    *   **Adaptive Hybrid Filter:**
        *   Input: Raw microphone data, proactive spatial filter coefficients, and residual noise.
        *   Process: Combines the proactive filter with a traditional adaptive filter (e.g., Least Mean Squares – LMS).  The LMS filter handles unexpected noise or inaccuracies in the prediction. The weighting between the proactive and reactive filters is dynamically adjusted based on the confidence level of the prediction.
        *   Output: Clean audio data.

*   **Data Requirements:**
    *   Large dataset of acoustic scenes with labeled sound sources and their movements.
    *   Real-time data logging to continuously refine the prediction model.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Filtering Module):**

```
function predict_future_scene(current_scene_map, historical_data):
  // Analyze historical acoustic data (e.g., sound source trajectories,
  // recurring patterns).
  past_trends = analyze_historical_data(historical_data)

  // Predict future sound source positions and intensities based on
  // current scene map and past trends.
  predicted_sources = predict_sound_sources(current_scene_map, past_trends)

  // Create a "noise anticipation profile" representing predicted noise
  // levels at each microphone.
  noise_anticipation_profile = generate_noise_profile(predicted_sources)

  return noise_anticipation_profile

function generate_noise_profile(predicted_sources):
  // For each microphone:
  for each microphone in microphone_array:
    // Calculate the expected noise level from each predicted source
    // based on its distance and intensity.
    predicted_noise_level = calculate_noise_level(microphone, predicted_source)

    // Sum the noise levels from all predicted sources.
    total_noise_level = sum(predicted_noise_level)

    // Store the total noise level for this microphone.
    store_noise_level(microphone, total_noise_level)
```

**Novelty:** This moves beyond reactive noise suppression to *anticipatory* suppression. Traditional systems respond *after* noise is detected. This system attempts to suppress noise *before* it reaches the microphone, resulting in a potentially more seamless and natural listening experience. The combination of spatial audio rendering, machine learning, and adaptive filtering creates a powerful new approach to noise control.
