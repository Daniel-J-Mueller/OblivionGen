## Adaptive Query ‘Shadowing’ and Predictive Cost Adjustment

**Concept:** Extend the cost-based optimization by introducing ‘query shadowing’ – running lightweight, statistically insignificant ‘shadow’ executions of query plans on different nodes *before* full execution. This allows for real-time, node-specific cost refinement, beyond static characteristics or prior statistics.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Shadow Execution Module:**  A component integrated within the query optimizer. This module, when enabled (configurable per query or globally), initiates ‘shadow’ query executions. Shadow executions use a significantly reduced resource allocation (e.g., 1% of typical resources, limited row sampling). The results aren’t used for the actual query output.

2.  **Resource Allocation Control:**  The Shadow Execution Module must be configurable for resource limits. Parameters include:
    *   `max_cpu_percent`: Maximum CPU percentage allocated to shadow executions.
    *   `max_memory_mb`: Maximum memory allocated to shadow executions.
    *   `sample_rate`: Percentage of rows to sample during shadow execution.
    *   `shadow_nodes`: List of nodes to execute shadow queries on (can be all nodes or a subset).

3.  **Cost Refinement Engine:**  This module receives timing and resource usage data from shadow executions. It calculates a ‘shadow cost’ for each query plan on each node.

4.  **Dynamic Cost Adjustment:** The Cost Refinement Engine uses a weighted average of:
    *   Static node characteristics (from system catalog).
    *   Prior execution statistics (if available).
    *   Shadow cost (calculated from real-time shadow executions).
    *   A ‘recency factor’ – giving more weight to recent shadow executions.

    The formula:

    `Adjusted Cost = (Weight_Static * Static_Cost) + (Weight_Prior * Prior_Cost) + (Weight_Shadow * Shadow_Cost)`

    Where:

    *   `Weight_Static + Weight_Prior + Weight_Shadow = 1`
    *   Weights are configurable.
    *   `Prior_Cost` is 0 if no prior execution data exists.

5.  **Plan Selection Logic:** The query optimizer uses the `Adjusted Cost` to select the optimal query plan and execution node.

6.  **Adaptive Learning:** The system logs `Adjusted Cost` and actual execution cost. A machine learning model (e.g., linear regression) can be trained to refine the weights (`Weight_Static`, `Weight_Prior`, `Weight_Shadow`) over time, improving the accuracy of cost predictions.

**Pseudocode (Cost Refinement Engine):**

```
FUNCTION CalculateAdjustedCost(node, queryPlan)
    staticCost = GetStaticCost(node, queryPlan)
    priorCost = GetPriorCost(node, queryPlan) //From query history
    shadowCost = GetShadowCost(node, queryPlan) //From shadow execution

    weightStatic = 0.4
    weightPrior = 0.3
    weightShadow = 0.3

    adjustedCost = (weightStatic * staticCost) + (weightPrior * priorCost) + (weightShadow * shadowCost)

    RETURN adjustedCost
END FUNCTION
```

**Implementation Notes:**

*   Shadow executions should be non-blocking and have minimal impact on production queries.
*   The system needs mechanisms to handle errors and failures during shadow executions.
*   Monitoring and logging of shadow execution statistics are crucial for performance analysis and tuning.
*   Consider using a distributed queueing system to manage shadow executions across multiple nodes.
*   The ML model training process should be automated and performed offline to avoid performance overhead.
