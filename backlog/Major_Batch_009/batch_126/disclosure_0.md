## Adaptive Acoustic Zones & Predictive Device Handoff

**Concept:** Extend the device arbitration beyond simple 'who heard it best' to create dynamically adjusting acoustic zones within a physical space. Implement predictive device handoff based on user movement and anticipated interactions.

**Specifications:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of low-power, wide-aperture microphones distributed throughout the monitored space (e.g., a room, open office). Minimum density: 1 microphone per 100 sq ft.
    *   Each microphone node equipped with a localized processing unit (edge compute) capable of beamforming, noise reduction, and basic speech activity detection.
    *   Each device (speaker, display, etc.) capable of broadcasting a low-power beacon signal indicating its position and capabilities.
    *   Central server or cloud instance for zone management, intent recognition, and command execution.

*   **Software Modules:**

    *   **Acoustic Zone Mapping:**
        *   Real-time triangulation of sound source (speech utterance) using microphone array data.
        *   Dynamic zone creation: automatically define acoustic zones centered on the sound source. Zone size adjusts based on signal strength and environmental noise.
        *   Zone overlap management: Handle scenarios where multiple users are speaking simultaneously by creating/adjusting zones to isolate each userâ€™s speech.

    *   **User Tracking & Prediction:**
        *   Utilize device proximity data (Bluetooth, UWB, WiFi) to track user movement within the space.
        *   Implement a movement prediction algorithm (Kalman filter or similar) to anticipate the user's next location.

    *   **Device Arbitration & Handoff:**
        *   Prioritize devices within the user's current/predicted acoustic zone.
        *   Handoff logic: Seamlessly transfer control of the speech session from one device to another as the user moves, ensuring continuous interaction.
        *   Contextual awareness: Consider device capabilities and user preferences when selecting the target device.  Example:  If the user is near a display, prioritize visual responses. If near a smart speaker, prioritize audio responses.

    *   **Intent Recognition & Command Execution:**  (Integrate existing speech recognition pipeline)

*   **Pseudocode (Handoff Logic):**

```
FUNCTION DetermineTargetDevice(userID, speechUtterance, currentDeviceID, predictedNextLocation)

    // 1. Get Devices within range of predictedNextLocation
    candidateDevices = GetDevicesInRange(predictedNextLocation)

    // 2. Filter based on capability (e.g., visual, audio, both)
    filteredDevices = FilterDevicesByCapability(candidateDevices, speechUtterance)

    // 3. Score devices based on:
    //    - Proximity to user (higher score for closer devices)
    //    - User preference (if available)
    //    - Device capability matching intent
    deviceScores = CalculateDeviceScores(deviceScores, filteredDevices)

    // 4. Select device with highest score
    targetDeviceID = SelectDeviceWithHighestScore(deviceScores)

    // 5. If targetDeviceID is different from currentDeviceID, initiate handoff sequence
    IF targetDeviceID != currentDeviceID THEN
        InitiateHandoffSequence(currentDeviceID, targetDeviceID, speechUtterance)
    ENDIF

    RETURN targetDeviceID

END FUNCTION
```

*   **Handoff Sequence:**  (Simplified)
    1.  Send a 'handoff' signal to the current device.
    2.  The current device stops processing audio and sends the current speech context (intent, partial transcript, etc.) to the target device.
    3.  The target device begins processing audio and continues the interaction seamlessly.

*   **Potential Applications:** Smart homes, conference rooms, open-plan offices, retail spaces, assisted living facilities.
