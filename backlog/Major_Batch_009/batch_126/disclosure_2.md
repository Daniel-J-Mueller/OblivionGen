## Predictive Prefetching based on User Task Analysis

**System Overview:**

This system extends client-side caching by proactively identifying *what a user is attempting to accomplish* and prefetching resources *related to the task*, not just based on past requests. It moves beyond “what they asked for before” to “what are they *likely trying to do now*?” 

**Components:**

1.  **Task Inference Engine (Client-Side):** A small, locally-run AI model.  This model observes user interactions (clicks, scrolls, typing, app switching, time spent on pages, etc.) to infer the user's current *task*. Tasks are defined as high-level goals (e.g., "planning a vacation to Hawaii", "writing a report on renewable energy", "comparing prices for a new laptop").
2.  **Task-Resource Mapping Database (Cloud-Based):** A database associating tasks with a ranked list of potentially useful resources. This database is populated through a combination of:
    *   **Crowdsourced Data:**  Aggregated, anonymized data from many users performing similar tasks.
    *   **Expert Curation:**  Human experts define common tasks and associate relevant resources.
    *   **Machine Learning:**  An AI model learns task-resource associations from usage patterns.
3.  **Prefetching Service (Cloud-Based):** A service responsible for receiving task predictions from the client and prefetching the top-ranked resources from the Task-Resource Mapping Database.
4.  **Client Cache Manager:** Existing cache manager, now augmented with pre-fetched content.

**Workflow:**

1.  The Task Inference Engine continuously analyzes user interactions.
2.  When the engine is confident about the user's task (above a threshold), it sends a task prediction (e.g., "planning a vacation to Hawaii") to the Prefetching Service.
3.  The Prefetching Service looks up the task in the Task-Resource Mapping Database.
4.  The service sends the top-N ranked resources (URLs, files, etc.) to the client's Cache Manager.
5.  The Cache Manager downloads and caches the resources, making them instantly available to the user.

**Pseudocode (Client-Side - Task Inference Engine):**

```
// Data Structures
task_probabilities = dictionary(task_name : probability)
user_interaction_features = list of features (clicks, scrolls, time spent, etc.)

// Initialization
initialize_task_probabilities() // Assign initial probabilities to all known tasks

// Main Loop
while (user is active):
    capture_user_interaction_features()
    update_task_probabilities(user_interaction_features)

    if (max(task_probabilities.values()) > confidence_threshold):
        predicted_task = key with max value in task_probabilities
        send_task_to_prefetching_service(predicted_task)
        reset_task_probabilities() // Reset to allow for new task prediction
```

**Pseudocode (Cloud-Side - Prefetching Service):**

```
// Data Structures
task_resource_map = dictionary(task_name : list of resource URLs)

// Main Function
receive_task_prediction(task_name)
if (task_name in task_resource_map):
    resource_list = task_resource_map[task_name]
    send_resources_to_client(resource_list)
else:
    // Task not found, perhaps return a general set of resources
    // or log the unknown task for future data collection
    log_unknown_task(task_name)
```

**Innovations:**

*   **Task-centric prefetching:**  Moves beyond content-based prefetching to predict user intent.
*   **Dynamic task prediction:**  Uses local AI to adapt to changing user behavior.
*   **Crowdsourced task-resource mapping:**  Leverages collective intelligence to improve resource recommendations.
*   **Privacy-preserving:** The Task Inference Engine runs locally, minimizing data sent to the cloud.
