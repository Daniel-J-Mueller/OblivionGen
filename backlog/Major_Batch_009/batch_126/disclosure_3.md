## Dynamic Memory Object Coalescing for Systolic Array Dataflow

**Concept:** Extend the memory dependency sorting to proactively coalesce multiple small memory objects into larger, contiguous blocks *before* scheduling, specifically targeting systolic array dataflow architectures. This reduces memory access overhead and improves data reuse within the array.

**Specification:**

**1. Dataflow Graph Analysis Module:**

*   **Input:** Set of instructions operating on memory objects, dependency graph.
*   **Process:**
    *   Analyze the instruction set and dependency graph to identify memory objects frequently accessed by the systolic array.
    *   Identify memory objects with lifetimes that overlap or are adjacent in the dataflow graph.
    *   Calculate the total size required to store all coalesced memory objects.
*   **Output:** A list of memory objects suitable for coalescing, and the total required size.

**2. Coalescing Allocator:**

*   **Input:** List of memory objects, total size, and memory map constraints (e.g., available memory regions, alignment requirements).
*   **Process:**
    *   Attempt to allocate a contiguous memory block large enough to hold all coalesced memory objects.
    *   If successful, map each original memory object to a sub-region within the contiguous block.
    *   If allocation fails (due to fragmentation or size limitations), fall back to the original allocation strategy.
*   **Output:** Mapping of original memory objects to locations within the coalesced block, or indication of failure.

**3. Instruction Rewriter:**

*   **Input:** Original instruction set, memory object mapping.
*   **Process:**
    *   Rewrite all memory access instructions to use the new locations within the coalesced block. This involves updating memory addresses and potentially re-ordering access patterns to optimize for locality.
*   **Output:** Rewritten instruction set with updated memory addresses.

**4. Scheduler Integration:**

*   Integrate the coalescing allocator and instruction rewriter into the existing instruction scheduler.
*   The scheduler will first attempt to coalesce memory objects before sorting and scheduling instructions.
*   The sorted instruction sequence will then operate on the coalesced memory blocks.

**Pseudocode (Illustrative):**

```pseudocode
function coalesce_memory(instructions, dependency_graph):
  coalescable_objects = identify_coalescable_objects(instructions, dependency_graph)
  total_size = calculate_total_size(coalescable_objects)

  allocation_result = allocate_contiguous_block(total_size)

  if allocation_result.success:
    mapping = create_memory_mapping(coalescable_objects, allocation_result.address)
    rewritten_instructions = rewrite_instructions(instructions, mapping)
    return rewritten_instructions, mapping
  else:
    return instructions, null  // Use original allocation
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Reduced memory access latency for systolic arrays.
*   Improved data reuse within the array.
*   Lower memory bandwidth requirements.
*   Simplified memory management.
*   Potential for increased performance and energy efficiency.
