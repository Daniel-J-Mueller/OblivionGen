## Temporal Data Shadows - Predictive Forensic Volumes

**Concept:** Extend the block-level capture system to not just *record* past states, but *predict* likely future states based on observed patterns. Create “shadow volumes” that evolve alongside the primary volume, branching into probable futures.

**Specification:**

1.  **Pattern Observation Module:** A dedicated process continuously monitors write patterns to the primary storage volume. This isn't merely logging write operations, but analyzing *what* is being changed, *when*, and *how frequently*. Statistical models (Markov Chains, Recurrent Neural Networks) will be employed to identify recurring sequences and predict future modifications.
2.  **Shadow Volume Generation:** Multiple shadow volumes are created, each representing a probabilistic future. The number of shadow volumes and their divergence from the primary volume is configurable.  Initially, they are clones of the primary volume.
3.  **Probabilistic Write Application:** When a write operation occurs on the primary volume:
    *   The operation is applied to the primary volume as usual.
    *   The operation is *also* applied to each shadow volume, but with a probability weighting derived from the pattern observation module.  If the pattern analysis indicates a high likelihood the change would occur in that shadow volume's predicted future, the probability is high (near 1.0). If the change is unexpected, the probability is low (e.g., 0.1).  This creates branching futures.
4.  **Delta Compression & Storage:**  Shadow volumes don’t store full copies of changed blocks. Instead, a delta compression scheme is used, storing only the differences from the last common state (the point at which the shadow volume branched).
5.  **Forensic Access Interface:**  Investigators can access any shadow volume at any point in time, effectively "rewinding" the data and exploring alternative scenarios.  A visual interface will display the "decision tree" of shadow volume divergence, showing the probability paths taken.
6.  **Anomaly Detection:**  If the primary volume deviates significantly from *all* predicted shadow volumes, it triggers an alert, indicating a potentially malicious or unusual event.

**Pseudocode (Simplified Forensic Access):**

```
function accessForensicVolume(primaryVolume, captureTime, scenarioProbability):
  // Find the most likely shadow volume corresponding to captureTime and scenarioProbability
  shadowVolume = findShadowVolume(captureTime, scenarioProbability)

  if shadowVolume == null:
    // Handle case where no suitable shadow volume exists (e.g., revert to primary or nearest available)
    return primaryVolume

  // Reconfigure a forensic volume using the selected shadow volume data
  reconfigureForensicVolume(shadowVolume)

  return forensicVolume
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   High-performance storage for shadow volume creation and maintenance.
*   Dedicated processing power for pattern analysis and probabilistic write application.
*   Scalable storage architecture to accommodate a growing number of shadow volumes.
