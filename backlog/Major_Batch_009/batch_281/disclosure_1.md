**Dynamic Content Weaving – Personalized Narrative Generation**

**Concept:** Expand beyond merely measuring consumption of content *features* to dynamically generate entirely new content segments, woven into the existing flow, based on inferred user narrative preferences. The existing patent focuses on understanding *what* is consumed. This system attempts to predict *what should be consumed next* to maximize engagement and create a uniquely tailored experience.

**Specs:**

1.  **Narrative Profile Creation:**
    *   **Data Inputs:** Event data (scrolling, clicks, dwell time, dimension changes, focus), layout data (content structure, feature types), and optional user profile data (demographics, stated interests).
    *   **Preference Vectors:** Construct a multi-dimensional “narrative preference vector” for each user. Dimensions could include:
        *   *Emotional Tone:* (Positive, Negative, Neutral, Suspenseful, Humorous) – inferred from content consumed.
        *   *Complexity:* (Simple, Moderate, Complex) – determined by reading level, sentence structure, and topic depth.
        *   *Subject Matter Focus:* (Technology, Politics, Lifestyle, Sports, etc.) – identified via keyword analysis.
        *   *Narrative Structure:* (Linear, Non-Linear, Episodic, etc.) – determined by content format and sequencing.
    *   **Weighting Algorithm:**  Implement a dynamic weighting algorithm that adjusts the importance of each dimension based on recent user behavior. (e.g., a sudden increase in consumption of humorous content increases the weighting of the "Humorous" dimension).

2.  **Content Fragment Repository:**
    *   **Modular Content Units:**  Develop a library of short, self-contained content fragments (text blocks, images, videos, interactive elements) tagged with metadata corresponding to the dimensions in the narrative preference vector.
    *   **Fragment Generation:** Employ AI tools (large language models, image generation) to dynamically generate new content fragments on demand.

3.  **Dynamic Content Weaving Engine:**
    *   **Real-Time Analysis:** Continuously analyze user event data to update the narrative preference vector.
    *   **Fragment Selection:** Based on the updated preference vector, select the most relevant content fragment from the repository. (Use a similarity metric to compare the fragment’s metadata to the user’s preference vector).
    *   **Seamless Insertion:**  Insert the selected fragment into the existing content flow *without* disrupting the overall user experience. Strategies include:
        *   *Contextual Bridging:* Write short “bridging” sentences to smoothly connect the inserted fragment to the surrounding content.
        *   *Visual Integration:* Match the visual style of the fragment to the surrounding content.
        *   *Adaptive Layout:* Adjust the layout of the content to accommodate the inserted fragment without causing reflow or distortion.

4.  **Feedback Loop & Optimization:**
    *   **Engagement Metrics:** Track user engagement with the inserted fragments (dwell time, click-through rates, completion rates).
    *   **A/B Testing:**  Conduct A/B testing with different fragment selection algorithms and insertion strategies.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the fragment selection algorithm over time, maximizing user engagement and creating a more personalized experience.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function weaveContent(user, currentContent, eventData):
  userProfile = getUserProfile(user)
  narrativeVector = buildNarrativeVector(userProfile, eventData)
  suitableFragments = findSuitableFragments(narrativeVector)
  selectedFragment = chooseBestFragment(suitableFragments)
  bridgingText = generateBridgingText(currentContent, selectedFragment)
  newContent = insertFragment(currentContent, selectedFragment, bridgingText)
  return newContent
```
