## Adaptive Acoustic Beaming for Granular Sharing

**Concept:** Extend proximity-based sharing by replacing broad transmission strength adjustments with dynamically focused acoustic beams. Instead of simply limiting transmission range, actively *steer* the audio signal containing the security code directly towards identified receiving devices. This enables sharing in dense environments and offers a greater degree of privacy.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Microphone Array: Integrated into the 'sharing' device â€“ minimum 8-element array optimized for directional audio transmission.
    *   Digital Signal Processor (DSP): High-performance DSP capable of real-time beamforming calculations.
    *   Wireless Communication Module: Standard Wi-Fi/Bluetooth for initial device discovery and data transmission.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    *   Device Discovery:  Utilize existing Wi-Fi/Bluetooth scanning to identify nearby devices.
    *   Spatial Mapping: Implement a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based triangulation algorithm to estimate the 3D location of each discovered device.  Supplement with optional visual input (camera) for improved accuracy.  Location data is stored locally.
    *   Beamforming Algorithm: Utilize a delay-and-sum beamforming approach. Calculate the appropriate delays for each microphone element in the array to constructively interfere at the target device's location and destructively interfere in other directions.  Employ adaptive beamforming techniques to compensate for environmental noise and reflections.
    *   Security Code Modulation: Encapsulate the security code into the audio signal. Modulate the audio carrier frequency with the code.
    *   Dynamic Adjustment: Continuously monitor the relative position of receiving devices. Update beamforming weights in real-time to track movement and maintain accurate targeting.
    *   User Interface (Optional): Allow users to visually select target devices in a spatial map for sharing.
*   **Operational Flow:**
    1.  Device broadcasts a discovery signal via Wi-Fi/Bluetooth.
    2.  Nearby receiving devices respond.
    3.  Sharing device calculates the 3D location of each responding device.
    4.  User selects target devices, or the system defaults to all detected devices within a specified radius.
    5.  DSP calculates beamforming weights for each target device.
    6.  Audio signal containing the security code is transmitted through the microphone array, shaped into focused acoustic beams directed at each target.
    7.  Receiving devices detect the security code.
    8.  If the security code is verified, a secure connection is established for content sharing.
    9.  System continuously monitors the relative position of receiving devices and adjusts beamforming weights accordingly.
*   **Pseudocode (Beamforming Update):**

    ```
    FOR each target_device IN target_devices:
        // Calculate distance and angle to target_device
        distance = calculate_distance(sharing_device_location, target_device_location)
        angle = calculate_angle(sharing_device_location, target_device_location)

        // Calculate delay for each microphone element
        FOR each microphone IN microphone_array:
            delay = (distance_to_microphone - distance) * speed_of_sound

        // Calculate phase shift for each microphone element
        phase_shift = 2 * pi * frequency * delay

        // Apply phase shift to microphone signal
        microphone_signal = apply_phase_shift(microphone_signal, phase_shift)

    // Sum microphone signals to create focused beam
    focused_beam = sum(microphone_signals)
    ```

*   **Potential Extensions:**
    *   Multi-User Sharing:  Simultaneously create multiple focused beams to share with multiple devices.
    *   Directional Audio Conferencing: Utilize beamforming to create a private audio conference within a physical space.
    *   Obstacle Avoidance: Implement algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles in the path of the acoustic beam.
    *   Integration with Augmented Reality:  Visually display the direction and intensity of the acoustic beam in an AR environment.
