## Dynamic Dependency Visualization & Automated Micro-Service Choreography

**Concept:** Extend the graph model concept to facilitate *live* dependency analysis and automate the creation of orchestrated micro-services, going beyond static extraction. This moves from identifying independently deployable components to *actively managing* their interaction.

**Specifications:**

**1. Live Dependency Graph (LDG) Module:**

*   **Input:** Source code, bytecode, running application telemetry (request/response times, resource usage, error logs).
*   **Process:**  Dynamically construct and update the graph model *during* application runtime. This differs from the patentâ€™s static analysis.  The LDG includes:
    *   Nodes: Application Components (package, class, method, data object).
    *   Edges:  Dependencies *and* runtime interaction frequencies/latencies. Edge weight corresponds to the observed runtime interaction data.
    *   Color Coding:  Nodes and edges dynamically change color based on performance metrics (e.g., red = high latency, green = healthy, grey = infrequently used).
*   **Output:** A continuously updated LDG accessible through a visual interface.

**2. Automated Choreography Engine:**

*   **Input:** LDG, user-defined service level objectives (SLOs) for key application features, cost constraints.
*   **Process:**
    *   **Service Partitioning:** Algorithmically identify potential micro-service boundaries based on LDG characteristics:
        *   Low edge weight between node clusters suggests potential separation.
        *   Nodes violating SLOs are strong candidates for isolation/scaling.
        *   Cost optimization is factored into the decision (e.g., avoid excessive inter-service communication).
    *   **API Generation:** Automatically generate REST or gRPC APIs for each identified micro-service. The APIs are based on the observed runtime interactions in the LDG.
    *   **Orchestration Logic:** Generate orchestration logic (e.g., using Kubernetes, serverless functions) to manage the interactions between the micro-services. This includes handling requests, routing data, and managing state.
*   **Output:** Deployment manifests (Kubernetes YAML, serverless function definitions), API specifications (OpenAPI/Swagger), and orchestration code.

**3. Runtime Feedback Loop:**

*   **Process:** Monitor the performance of the deployed micro-services and feed the data back into the LDG. This allows the system to adapt to changing workloads and optimize the micro-service architecture in real-time.
*   **Features:**
    *   **Auto-Scaling:** Dynamically scale micro-services based on observed traffic patterns.
    *   **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
    *   **A/B Testing:**  Enable A/B testing of different micro-service configurations.

**Pseudocode (Automated Choreography Engine):**

```
function generateMicroservices(LDG, SLOs, costConstraints):
  microservices = []
  clusters = findConnectedClusters(LDG) // Algorithm to identify potential service boundaries

  for cluster in clusters:
    if calculateClusterScore(cluster, SLOs, costConstraints) > threshold:
      service = createMicroservice(cluster)
      api = generateAPI(cluster) // Based on observed interactions
      manifest = createDeploymentManifest(service, api)
      microservices.append(manifest)

  return microservices
```

**Novelty:** This approach moves beyond static extraction to a dynamic, self-optimizing micro-service architecture. The runtime feedback loop and automated choreography are key differentiators, allowing the system to adapt to changing conditions and optimize performance without manual intervention.  It is a system for *managing* microservices, not just creating them.
