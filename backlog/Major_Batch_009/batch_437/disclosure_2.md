## Adaptive Resonance Shelf System - ARSS

**Concept:** Extend the weight/capacitance sensing to create a self-learning, adaptive shelf system capable of identifying *how* an item is being handled – not just *that* an item is being handled. This goes beyond simple pick/place detection to analyze user interaction patterns for enhanced inventory management, loss prevention, and even predictive restocking.

**Specs:**

*   **Sensor Suite:**
    *   High-resolution weight sensors (as per patent) – sensitivity to +/- 1 gram.
    *   Capacitive sensors – multi-electrode array for spatial mapping of object proximity and hand gestures.
    *   Micro-Doppler Radar – positioned above/below shelves to detect motion vectors and differentiate between picking, reaching, and accidental disturbances. Range: 0-50cm.
    *   Ambient Light Sensor – Detect changes in illumination, potentially indicating a user is actively looking at/reaching for an item.

*   **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**
    *   Sampling Rate: Weight & Capacitance – 100Hz, Radar – 25Hz, Light – 1Hz.
    *   Noise Filtering: Kalman filter applied to weight and radar data. Capacitance data smoothed using a Savitzky-Golay filter.
    *   Feature Extraction:
        *   Weight Profile: Rate of change of weight, duration of weight change, maximum weight change.
        *   Capacitance Map:  Spatial distribution of capacitance changes, gesture recognition (e.g., grasp, reach, wave).
        *   Radar Velocity:  Magnitude and direction of motion vectors.
        *   Light Change: Delta of luminance

*   **Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) Network:**
    *   Implementation:  Fuzzy ART network trained on a dataset of labeled interaction patterns.
    *   Training Data:  Collected through initial calibration phase and ongoing user interactions. Labelled actions include "quick pick", "slow browse", "accidental bump", "attempted theft", "re-stocking gesture", etc.
    *   Vigilance Parameter: Dynamically adjusted based on shelf location and item type. (High vigilance for high-value items, lower vigilance for fast-moving items).
    *   Category Creation: ART network automatically creates categories of interaction patterns.
    *   Anomaly Detection: Deviation from learned patterns flagged as potential anomalies.

*   **System Architecture:**
    *   Edge Computing:  All data processing performed locally on a shelf-mounted processor.
    *   Wireless Communication:  Data transmitted to central server via secure WiFi.
    *   Central Server:  Responsible for data storage, system monitoring, and model updates.
    *   API: Allows integration with existing inventory management systems.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection):**

```
FUNCTION DetectAnomaly(weightData, capacitanceData, radarData, lightData):
  //Preprocess Data
  preprocessedWeight = KalmanFilter(weightData)
  preprocessedCapacitance = SavitzkyGolayFilter(capacitanceData)
  preprocessedRadar = ProcessRadarData(radarData)
  preprocessedLight = ProcessLightData(lightData)

  //Feature Extraction
  features = ExtractFeatures(preprocessedWeight, preprocessedCapacitance, preprocessedRadar, preprocessedLight)

  //ART Network Prediction
  prediction = ARTNetwork.Predict(features)

  //Calculate Confidence Score
  confidence = ARTNetwork.GetConfidence(prediction)

  //Anomaly Threshold
  anomalyThreshold = 0.7

  //Anomaly Detection
  IF confidence < anomalyThreshold THEN
      RETURN True //Anomaly Detected
  ELSE
      RETURN False //No Anomaly
  ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Loss Prevention: Identify and alert security personnel to potential theft attempts.
*   Automated Restocking: Trigger automatic replenishment orders based on detected removal patterns.
*   Customer Behavior Analysis: Understand how customers interact with products on shelves.
*   Optimized Shelf Placement: Improve product visibility and sales by analyzing interaction patterns.
*   Robotics Integration: Provide robots with more detailed information about shelf contents and user intentions.
