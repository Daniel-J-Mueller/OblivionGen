**Dynamic Skill Chaining with Predictive Proactivity**

**Concept:** Extend the existing system's contextual awareness to *proactively* suggest and initiate chained skill executions *before* the user explicitly requests them, based on learned behavior and predicted needs.  Instead of just reacting to user input and deciding *which* skill to run, the system anticipates *what* the user will need *next* and begins pre-loading or partially executing related skills.

**Specs:**

1.  **Behavioral Profile Construction:** 
    *   Maintain a detailed behavioral profile for each user, tracking skill usage frequency, sequence of skill invocations, time spent in each skill, and implicit feedback (e.g., skill abandonment, re-invocation of the same skill shortly after exiting).
    *   Profiles are built using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to capture sequential dependencies in skill usage.

2.  **Predictive Skill Model:**
    *   Train a separate model (e.g., a transformer network) on the behavioral profiles to predict the probability of the user invoking a particular skill given their current context (current skill, time of day, location, recent interactions).
    *   The model outputs a ranked list of predicted skills, along with confidence scores.

3.  **Proactive Skill Pre-loading:**
    *   In the background, pre-load the top N predicted skills (configurable parameter) based on the predictive model's output. This involves:
        *   Downloading necessary code and data.
        *   Initializing the skill's runtime environment.
        *   Pre-fetching relevant data (e.g., user preferences, account information).

4.  **Contextual Interruption & Skill Chain Initiation:**
    *   While the user is interacting with a current skill, continuously monitor the predictive model’s output.
    *   If a predicted skill’s confidence score exceeds a threshold (configurable), trigger a non-intrusive interruption (e.g., a subtle visual cue or a brief audio chime).
    *   Present the user with a prompt: "Would you like me to [predicted skill]?".  Provide options to accept, decline, or postpone.
    *   Upon acceptance, seamlessly initiate the predicted skill, passing relevant context from the current skill (e.g., current search query, selected item).

5.  **Adaptive Thresholding:**
    *   Dynamically adjust the confidence score threshold based on user feedback. 
    *   If the user frequently declines suggested skills, increase the threshold. 
    *   If the user consistently accepts suggested skills, decrease the threshold.

6.  **Skill Dependency Graph:**
    *   Maintain a graph representing skill dependencies. This graph specifies which skills can be seamlessly chained together and what data can be passed between them.
    *   The system uses this graph to ensure that predicted skills are compatible with the current skill and that data transfer is handled correctly.

**Pseudocode (Skill Prediction & Interruption):**

```
// Assuming 'currentSkill' is the currently active skill

function predictNextSkill(userProfile, currentSkill):
  // Use trained predictive model to get ranked list of predicted skills
  predictedSkills = predictiveModel.predict(userProfile, currentSkill)
  return predictedSkills

function interruptWithSuggestion(predictedSkill):
  // Display non-intrusive prompt to user
  displayPrompt("Would you like me to " + predictedSkill.name + "?")
  // Get user response (accept, decline, postpone)
  response = getUserResponse()
  if response == "accept":
    // Initiate predicted skill with relevant context
    initiateSkill(predictedSkill, getContextFromCurrentSkill())
  else if response == "postpone":
      //Add predicted skill to a queue for later consideration.

// Main loop
while user is interacting with currentSkill:
  predictedSkills = predictNextSkill(userProfile, currentSkill)
  if predictedSkills[0].confidence > threshold:
    interruptWithSuggestion(predictedSkills[0])
```
