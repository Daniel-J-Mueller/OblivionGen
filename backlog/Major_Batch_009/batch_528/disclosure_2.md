## Dynamic Attribute Weighting Based on Affective State

**Concept:** Extend the attribute prediction model to incorporate real-time affective state detection from the user (via webcam, wearable, or even typing patterns) and dynamically adjust attribute weighting during the shopping mission.  This moves beyond *predicting* preference to *responding* to evolving emotional needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Affective Input Module:**
    *   Input: Webcam feed, wearable sensor data (heart rate variability, skin conductance), typing patterns (speed, force, error rate).
    *   Processing:  Employ a pre-trained affective computing model (e.g., based on facial expression recognition, physiological signal analysis, or linguistic analysis) to estimate user's current emotional state. Output a vector representing valence (positive/negative), arousal (high/low), and dominance (control/submission).
    *   Output:  Affective State Vector (Valence, Arousal, Dominance).
*   **Attribute-Emotion Mapping Table:**
    *   A configurable lookup table defining the correlation between specific item attributes and emotional states.  Example:
        *   High Arousal + Positive Valence ->  "Bold", "Vibrant", "High-Performance" attributes weighted higher.
        *   Low Arousal + Negative Valence -> "Comforting", "Relaxing", "Soothing" attributes weighted higher.
        *   The table will be initially populated with generalized correlations (based on psychological studies) and refined over time based on user data (see Learning Module below).
*   **Dynamic Weighting Engine:**
    *   Input:  Affective State Vector, Attribute-Emotion Mapping Table, Current Attribute Weights (from existing attribute prediction model).
    *   Processing:  Scale the existing attribute weights based on the correlation defined in the mapping table and the current affective state. A simple approach is to multiply the existing weight by a factor derived from the correlation.
    *   Output:  Dynamically adjusted attribute weights.
*   **Learning Module:**
    *   Collect data on user interactions (clicks, purchases, time spent viewing items) along with the corresponding affective state at the time of the interaction.
    *   Employ a reinforcement learning algorithm (e.g., Q-learning) to refine the Attribute-Emotion Mapping Table.  Reward signals are based on positive user interactions and penalties for negative interactions.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** The Dynamic Weighting Engine sits *between* the attribute prediction model and the item ranking/presentation layer. It receives the initial attribute weights from the prediction model, modifies them based on the user's affective state, and passes the adjusted weights to the presentation layer.

**Pseudocode:**

```
function calculate_adjusted_weights(predicted_weights, affective_state, emotion_mapping_table):
    adjusted_weights = []
    for attribute in predicted_weights:
        correlation = emotion_mapping_table[attribute][affective_state]  // Get correlation
        adjusted_weight = predicted_weight * correlation    // Apply correlation
        adjusted_weights.append(adjusted_weight)
    return adjusted_weights
```

**Example Scenario:**

User is browsing running shoes. The initial attribute prediction model suggests "lightweight" and "cushioned" are important. The webcam detects the user appears frustrated (negative valence, high arousal). The system checks the mapping table and finds that "durable" and "supportive" attributes are positively correlated with frustration. The Dynamic Weighting Engine increases the weights of "durable" and "supportive" attributes, causing the system to prioritize shoes with those features in the presented results.
