## Dynamic Zone Prioritization & Predictive Routing

**Concept:** Augment the existing traffic control system with a dynamic prioritization layer for traffic control policy areas (TCPA) and a predictive routing component leveraging short-term demand forecasting. This moves beyond reactive congestion avoidance toward proactive traffic shaping.

**Specs:**

**1. Demand Forecasting Module:**

*   **Input:** Historical travel request data (origin, destination, timestamps), real-time request streams, facility operational schedule (e.g., shift changes, known peak times).
*   **Algorithm:** Time series forecasting (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) combined with machine learning (e.g., Gradient Boosting) to predict request density within each TCPA for the next 5-15 minutes. The model should be trained and updated continuously.
*   **Output:** Predicted request density score (0-100) for each TCPA, updated every minute.

**2. Dynamic TCPA Prioritization:**

*   **Priority Levels:** Define three priority levels: High, Medium, Low.
*   **Assignment Logic:** Based on the demand forecast, assign each TCPA a priority level.
    *   High (Score 75-100): Strict access control, prioritizing perpendicular traffic and delaying intersecting routes.
    *   Medium (Score 40-74): Balanced access control, favoring perpendicular traffic but allowing some intersecting routes with increased delay.
    *   Low (Score 0-39): Minimal access control, allowing most routes with minimal delay.
*   **Re-evaluation Frequency:** Re-evaluate and adjust TCPA priorities every 2 minutes based on updated demand forecasts.

**3. Predictive Routing Algorithm:**

*   **Input:** Travel request (origin, destination), current TCPA priorities, predicted request density.
*   **Route Generation:** Generate multiple potential routes, considering TCPA priorities and predicted congestion.
*   **Cost Function:** Assign a cost to each route based on:
    *   Travel distance
    *   TCPA priority (higher priority = higher cost)
    *   Predicted congestion (based on predicted request density in traversed TPCAs)
*   **Route Selection:** Select the route with the lowest total cost.

**4. System Integration:**

*   The Demand Forecasting Module and Predictive Routing Algorithm should integrate seamlessly with the existing traffic control system.
*   The existing controller should receive updated TCPA priorities and route recommendations.
*   The controller should use this information to grant or delay travel requests, as before, but now guided by predictive traffic shaping.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Routing Algorithm):**

```
function findBestRoute(origin, destination, tcpaPriorities, predictedDensity):
  potentialRoutes = generateRoutes(origin, destination)
  for route in potentialRoutes:
    cost = 0
    for tcpa in route.traversedTcpas:
      priority = tcpaPriorities[tcpa]
      density = predictedDensity[tcpa]
      cost += priority * density  //Weighted score
      cost += route.distance //Add distance 
    route.totalCost = cost
  
  bestRoute = min(potentialRoutes, key=lambda x: x.totalCost)
  return bestRoute
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   Increased processing power for the Demand Forecasting Module and Predictive Routing Algorithm.
*   Real-time data streaming capabilities for receiving travel request data.
*   Secure communication channels for data transfer.
