## Dynamic Authentication Protocol Negotiation via Blockchain

**Concept:** Extend the single sign-on configuration process to incorporate a blockchain-based protocol negotiation system. This allows for a more secure and auditable method for determining compatible authentication protocols and exchanging configuration data. It moves beyond a simple compatibility check to a dynamic, verifiable agreement.

**Specs:**

**1. Blockchain Integration:**

*   **Blockchain Type:** Permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric or similar). This ensures control over participating identity and service providers.
*   **Smart Contract:** A central "Authentication Protocol Registry" smart contract. This contract stores:
    *   List of supported authentication protocols (SAML, OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, etc.) with versioning.
    *   Metadata for each protocol, including security certifications, supported features, and known vulnerabilities.
    *   Identities of registered Identity Providers (IdPs) and Service Providers (SPs).
    *   Audit trail of all protocol negotiations.

**2. Negotiation Flow:**

1.  **IdP initiates Negotiation:** When an SP requests SSO configuration, the IdP doesn't immediately check for compatibility. Instead, it initiates a negotiation request on the blockchain. This request includes:
    *   SP identifier.
    *   Desired authentication strength (e.g., MFA required, passwordless only).
    *   List of protocols the IdP *can* support.
2.  **SP Responds:** The SP responds to the negotiation request on the blockchain, indicating its supported protocols and preferences.
3.  **Protocol Selection:** A smart contract algorithm determines the optimal protocol based on both IdP and SP capabilities, security requirements, and potential interoperability. Factors include:
    *   Mutual support for key features (e.g., attribute exchange).
    *   Security certification levels.
    *   Network latency and bandwidth.
4.  **Configuration Exchange:**  Configuration data (metadata endpoints, client IDs, scopes) is *not* directly exchanged. Instead, the smart contract generates a cryptographically signed "configuration pointer". This pointer references a secure, decentralized storage location (IPFS, Filecoin) where the configuration data resides. Access to this data is governed by blockchain-based access control.
5.  **Audit Trail:** All negotiation steps, protocol selections, and configuration data access are immutably recorded on the blockchain, providing a complete audit trail for security and compliance.

**3.  Pseudocode:**

```
// IdP: Initiate Negotiation
function initiateNegotiation(spID, desiredStrength, supportedProtocols) {
  blockchain.submitTransaction("Negotiate", spID, desiredStrength, supportedProtocols);
}

// SP: Respond to Negotiation
function respondToNegotiation(negotiationID, supportedProtocols) {
  blockchain.submitTransaction("Respond", negotiationID, supportedProtocols);
}

// Smart Contract: Determine Protocol
function determineProtocol(spSupported, idpSupported) {
  // Algorithm to select optimal protocol based on capabilities, security, etc.
  protocol = selectBestProtocol(spSupported, idpSupported);
  return protocol;
}

// Smart Contract: Generate Configuration Pointer
function generateConfigPointer(protocol, spID, idpID) {
  // Store config data in decentralized storage
  configData = fetchConfigData(protocol, spID, idpID);
  storageURL = uploadToDecentralizedStorage(configData);
  // Sign the URL with digital signatures from both IdP and SP
  signedURL = signURL(storageURL, idpID, spID);
  return signedURL;
}
```

**4.  Data Structures:**

*   `AuthenticationProtocol`: { name: string, version: string, securityCertifications: array, supportedFeatures: array }
*   `NegotiationRequest`: { spID: string, desiredStrength: string, supportedProtocols: array }
*   `NegotiationResponse`: { negotiationID: string, supportedProtocols: array }
*   `ConfigPointer`: { url: string, signatures: array }
