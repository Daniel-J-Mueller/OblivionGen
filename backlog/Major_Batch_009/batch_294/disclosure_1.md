## Dynamic Computational Shadowing with Predictive Resource Allocation

**Concept:** Extend the repeatable computation framework to *proactively* shadow running computations, not just archive states for replay. This allows for real-time analysis, anomaly detection, and predictive scaling of resources *during* computation, not just after or for repeated executions.

**Specifications:**

**1. Shadow Instance Creation:**

*   Upon initiating a repeatable computation, automatically create a ‘shadow instance’ mirroring the primary computation. This instance runs concurrently, receiving a stream of data representing the primary instance’s state.
*   Data stream encompasses: CPU registers, memory contents (sampled), I/O operations, network traffic, disk access patterns.  Sampling frequency is configurable based on computation criticality.
*   Shadow instance utilizes a separate, isolated virtual machine or container to avoid interference.

**2. Predictive Resource Modeling:**

*   Within the shadow instance, implement a predictive model (e.g., recurrent neural network, time series analysis) trained on historical data of similar computations.
*   The model analyzes the incoming data stream to forecast future resource demands (CPU, memory, I/O, network bandwidth).
*   Model outputs a probability distribution of resource needs over a defined time horizon.

**3. Dynamic Resource Allocation & ‘Pre-Provisioning’**

*   A resource manager monitors the predictive model’s output.
*   Based on the predicted resource needs, the resource manager *proactively* allocates resources to the primary computation *before* they are actually required. This is ‘pre-provisioning’.
*   Resource allocation is done through the underlying virtualization or container orchestration platform (e.g., Kubernetes, VMware vSphere).
*   A 'confidence threshold' dictates how aggressively resources are pre-provisioned. Higher confidence = more pre-provisioning.

**4.  Anomaly Detection:**

*   The shadow instance also monitors the primary instance for anomalous behavior.
*   Anomaly detection is performed by comparing the primary instance’s observed behavior against the predictive model’s expected behavior.
*   Deviations exceeding a defined threshold trigger alerts and/or corrective actions (e.g., rollback to a previous state, scaling up resources).

**5.  Checkpointing & Rollback:**

*   The shadow instance periodically checkpoints the primary instance’s state.
*   In case of anomalies or failures, the system can quickly rollback the primary instance to a known good state based on the latest checkpoint.

**Pseudocode (Resource Manager):**

```
while (computation_running):
    resource_predictions = shadow_instance.get_resource_predictions()
    current_resources = get_current_resource_allocation()

    resource_diff = resource_predictions - current_resources

    if (resource_diff > 0 && resource_predictions.confidence > threshold):
        allocate_resources(resource_diff)

    anomaly_detected = shadow_instance.detect_anomaly()

    if (anomaly_detected):
        rollback_to_checkpoint()
        alert_administrators()
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Sufficient processing power to run both the primary and shadow instances concurrently.
*   High-speed network connectivity for data streaming.
*   Sufficient memory and storage to accommodate the shadow instance's data and checkpoints.

**Software Requirements:**

*   Virtualization or container orchestration platform.
*   Machine learning library for predictive modeling.
*   Monitoring and alerting tools.
*   Data streaming framework.
