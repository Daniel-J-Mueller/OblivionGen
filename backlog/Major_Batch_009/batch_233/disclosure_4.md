## Haptic Sound Mapping for Augmented Reality

**Concept:** Extend the sound-based content sharing to include localized haptic feedback overlaid onto the audio signal, creating a spatially aware augmented reality experience *without* requiring visual displays.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Array of micro-haptic actuators integrated into wearable devices (wristbands, gloves, vests). Minimum actuator density: 1 actuator per 5cm².
    *   High-bandwidth, low-latency wireless communication between source device and wearable. Bluetooth 5.2 or Wi-Fi 6E recommended.
    *   Miniature directional microphone array on the wearable to enhance sound source localization.
    *   Processing unit on the wearable for real-time sound analysis and haptic pattern generation.
*   **Software/Algorithm:**
    1.  **Sound Source Localization:** The source device (emitting the "content key" audio signal) transmits not just the audio, but also metadata regarding its position (GPS, triangulation via nearby devices).
    2.  **Haptic Mapping Profile:**  A system-level profile defines how different audio frequencies and amplitudes map to specific haptic patterns (vibration intensity, frequency, location on the wearable).  Example:  High frequencies = sharper, localized vibrations; low frequencies = broader, pulsating vibrations.  This profile is customizable by the user/developer.
    3.  **Spatial Audio Rendering:**  The wearable’s processing unit analyzes incoming audio (content key + content audio) to determine the direction and distance of the sound source.
    4.  **Haptic Pattern Generation:**  Based on the spatial audio rendering and the haptic mapping profile, the processing unit generates a haptic pattern for each identified sound source.  The pattern is then sent to the appropriate actuators on the wearable.
    5.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously adjusts the haptic patterns based on the user’s movement and the changing soundscape.  This could involve Doppler effect simulation or sound occlusion modeling.
    6.  **Content Metadata Integration:** Content providers can embed haptic metadata within the audio stream (or alongside it) to specify custom haptic experiences.

*   **Pseudocode (Wearable Processing Unit):**

    ```
    function processAudio(audioStream, metadata) {
      soundSource = localizeSound(audioStream); // returns direction & distance
      if (metadata.hapticProfile) {
          hapticPattern = generateHapticPattern(soundSource, metadata.hapticProfile);
      } else {
          hapticPattern = generateDefaultHapticPattern(soundSource);
      }
      activateActuators(hapticPattern);
    }

    function activateActuators(pattern) {
        for (each element in pattern) {
            actuator[element.id].vibrate(element.intensity, element.frequency);
        }
    }

    function generateHapticPattern(soundSource, hapticProfile) {
      //Logic to convert spatial audio data into haptic output based on user/content creator settings
      //Uses sound direction and distance to choose actuators to activate
      //Intensity is based on volume, frequency on pitch
    }
    ```

*   **Use Cases:**
    *   **Navigation:** Haptic cues guide users to destinations without requiring them to look at a screen.
    *   **Accessibility:** Provides a non-visual way for visually impaired individuals to experience multimedia content.
    *   **Gaming/Entertainment:** Creates immersive haptic experiences that enhance gameplay or storytelling.
    *   **Remote Collaboration:** Allows users to "feel" the presence of remote collaborators through localized haptic feedback.
