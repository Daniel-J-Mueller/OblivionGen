## Dynamic Feature Degradation & Adaptive Reconstruction

**Concept:** Extend the idea of mediating service access based on health/importance to *proactively* degrade feature functionality when a service is unhealthy, and then *adaptively reconstruct* those features as service health improves, prioritizing reconstruction based on user segment impact. This goes beyond simply limiting access; it changes *what* is presented to the user.

**Specs:**

*   **Feature Dependency Graph:** Maintain a graph representing dependencies between web page features and backend services.  Each feature node lists the services it requires.  Weight edges based on criticality (e.g., a core search function has a higher weight than a rarely used recommendation).
*   **Degradation Profiles:** Define 'degradation profiles' for each feature. These profiles outline how the feature's functionality should be reduced as service health declines.  Examples:
    *   **Search:** Reduce the number of search results displayed.  Disable advanced filtering options.  Increase search latency.
    *   **Recommendations:** Switch from personalized recommendations to popular/trending items.  Reduce the number of recommendations shown.
    *   **Image Loading:** Display lower-resolution images.  Use placeholder images.
*   **Segment-Aware Impact Scoring:** Associate each user segment with an 'impact score' for each feature. This score estimates how much degradation of a feature will affect that segment's experience (e.g., power users might be more impacted by a degraded search function than casual visitors).
*   **Health Monitoring & Triggering:** Continuously monitor service health metrics (latency, error rate, etc.). When a service's health falls below a threshold, trigger the degradation process.
*   **Adaptive Reconstruction:** As service health improves, *adaptively reconstruct* degraded features, prioritizing reconstruction based on:
    *   Impact Score (highest impact features for the current segment are reconstructed first).
    *   Service Health (reconstruct features only for services with sufficient health).
    *   Resource Availability (limit reconstruction to prevent overloading the system).

**Pseudocode (Feature Degradation/Reconstruction Loop):**

```
function degrade_feature(feature, service_health, user_segment) {
  // Get degradation profile for the feature
  profile = get_degradation_profile(feature)

  // Calculate degradation level based on service health and profile
  degradation_level = calculate_degradation_level(service_health, profile)

  // Apply degradation to the feature
  apply_degradation(feature, degradation_level)
}

function reconstruct_feature(feature, service_health, user_segment) {
  // Calculate reconstruction priority based on impact score, health, and resources
  priority = calculate_reconstruction_priority(feature.impact_score, service_health, available_resources)

  // If priority is high enough, reconstruct the feature
  if (priority > threshold) {
    reconstruct_feature_fully(feature)
  }
}

// Main Loop
while (true) {
  for each service {
    health = monitor_service_health(service)
    for each feature dependent on service {
      user_segment = get_user_segment()

      if (health < threshold) {
        degrade_feature(feature, health, user_segment)
      } else {
        reconstruct_feature(feature, health, user_segment)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Key Innovations:**

*   **Proactive, Granular Degradation:**  Moves beyond simply blocking access. Degrades *specific* feature aspects, preserving core functionality.
*   **Segment-Awareness:**  Prioritizes feature reconstruction based on user segment impact, optimizing experience for key user groups.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:**  Continually adjusts feature presentation based on *real-time* service health and user context.
