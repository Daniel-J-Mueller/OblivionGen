## Adaptive Sensory Augmentation System

**Concept:** Expand the contextual awareness framework to *actively* influence the user's sensory experience – beyond audio responses – based on analyzed context queues. This goes beyond simply responding to a request; it proactively prepares the user's senses *before* a request is even formulated, or in anticipation of likely actions.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Integration with existing wearable devices (smartwatches, AR glasses, earbuds) to control haptic feedback, subtle visual cues (AR overlays), and binaural audio manipulation.
    *   Biofeedback sensors (heart rate, skin conductance) to gauge user state and calibrate sensory augmentation levels.
*   **Software – Core Module: Predictive Sensory Engine (PSE)**
    *   **Context Queue Extension:**  Expand the context queue to include not just application data (URLs, OCR), but also environmental data (location, ambient sound, time of day) and user state data (biofeedback, calendar events).
    *   **Predictive Modeling:** Employ machine learning algorithms (LSTM, Transformers) to predict likely user intentions *before* explicit voice requests. Model trained on historical user interaction data.
    *   **Sensory Mapping:** Define a configurable mapping between predicted intentions/context and specific sensory outputs.  Examples:
        *   If user is browsing a recipe website & PSE predicts they will ask "What are the ingredients?", subtly highlight key ingredient areas in AR glasses.
        *   If PSE predicts a purchase based on browsing history, activate a haptic ‘confirmation’ pulse on smartwatch *before* the voice command is given.
        *   When receiving a calendar event about a meeting, subtly shift ambient audio to a 'focus' soundscape.
    *   **Dynamic Calibration:** Continuously adjust sensory output intensity based on user biofeedback.  If user shows signs of stress, reduce sensory stimulation.
*   **Pseudocode (Simplified PSE Flow):**

```
FUNCTION ProcessContextQueue(contextQueue, userState)
  //Analyze contextQueue and userState
  predictedIntent = PredictIntent(contextQueue, userState)

  IF predictedIntent != "No Prediction" THEN
    sensoryOutput = GenerateSensoryOutput(predictedIntent)
    ActivateSensoryOutput(sensoryOutput)
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION GenerateSensoryOutput(predictedIntent)
  //Lookup sensory output from a predefined map (or generated dynamically)
  IF predictedIntent == "View Recipe Ingredients" THEN
    RETURN "AR Highlight Ingredients"
  ELSE IF predictedIntent == "Initiate Purchase" THEN
    RETURN "Haptic Confirmation Pulse"
  // ... other cases ...
  ELSE
    RETURN "No Output"
  ENDIF
END FUNCTION
```

*   **Security:**  Implement robust authentication and data privacy measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized sensory manipulation.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to fully customize sensory mappings, intensity levels, and opt-out of specific features.
