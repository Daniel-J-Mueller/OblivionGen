## Adaptive Haptic Texture Streaming

**Concept:** Expand the remote application experience by streaming not just video and input translation, but *haptic texture data* to a locally connected haptic surface. This creates a more immersive and realistic interaction, especially for applications involving manipulation of virtual objects (CAD, surgical simulation, artistic creation).

**Specs:**

*   **Haptic Surface:** Locally connected high-resolution haptic surface (e.g., array of micro-actuators) capable of rendering a variety of textures and forces. Resolution minimum 100x100 actuators.
*   **Texture Data Encoding:**  A compression algorithm optimized for haptic texture data.  Prioritize spatial frequency and magnitude of vibration/texture. Algorithm must allow for variable levels of detail (LoD) based on bandwidth and processing power.  Data format: Hierarchical Texture Maps (HTM).
*   **Streaming Protocol:** Real-time streaming protocol over a low-latency network connection (UDP/QUIC preferred).  Protocol includes error correction and resynchronization mechanisms. Packet loss must not manifest as 'jolts' but as smoothing of texture.
*   **Remote Application Integration:**  The remote application (running in the hosted environment) must be modified to:
    *   Extract surface normal data, material properties (friction, elasticity) and intended interaction forces for each rendered object.
    *   Generate HTM data based on this information.
    *   Send HTM data alongside the video stream.
*   **Local Client Processing:** The local client receives HTM data and uses it to control the haptic surface.  The client must:
    *   Decompress HTM data.
    *   Map the decompressed texture data to the haptic surface array.
    *   Synchronize haptic rendering with video rendering to maintain visual-haptic consistency.
*   **Adaptive Streaming:** Implement an adaptive streaming algorithm that adjusts the level of detail (LoD) of the haptic texture data based on network bandwidth, CPU/GPU load, and user preference.  LoD scaling should be smooth to avoid jarring transitions. Prioritize maintaining consistent spatial detail before sacrificing resolution.
*   **Interaction Force Modeling:** Include a physics engine on the local client side to model interaction forces between the user’s hand/finger and the virtual object. This allows for realistic tactile feedback.
*   **Calibration Procedure:** A user-initiated calibration routine to map the physical position of the user’s hand to the virtual object and to adjust haptic feedback intensity.
*   **API:** A public API allowing developers to integrate haptic texture streaming into their applications.

**Pseudocode (Local Client - Haptic Rendering):**

```
function RenderHapticFrame(videoFrame, hapticData) {
  if (hapticData != null) {
    decompressedTextureMap = Decompress(hapticData);
    hapticSurfaceArray = MapTextureMapToSurface(decompressedTextureMap);
    interactionForce = CalculateInteractionForce(userHandPosition, virtualObjectPosition);
    ApplyForceToSurface(hapticSurfaceArray, interactionForce);
    RenderHapticSurface(hapticSurfaceArray); // Activate actuators
  }
  RenderVideoFrame(videoFrame); // Render video
}

function CalculateInteractionForce(userHandPosition, virtualObjectPosition) {
  // Implement physics engine to calculate force based on
  // virtual object material properties, collision detection, etc.
  // Return force vector
}

function ApplyForceToSurface(surfaceArray, forceVector) {
  // Apply force vector to each actuator in the surface array
  // Adjust actuator activation level based on force magnitude
}
```
