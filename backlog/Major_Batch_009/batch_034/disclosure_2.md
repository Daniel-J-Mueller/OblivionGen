## Dynamic Tile Granularity & Predictive Prefetching

**Concept:** The existing patent focuses on segmented tile rendering and memory management. This builds upon that by introducing *dynamic* tile granularity and a predictive prefetching system based on user interaction patterns and content analysis. Instead of fixed tile sizes, the system analyzes content complexity and user viewport proximity to adjust tile size *on the fly*. This is coupled with a predictive prefetching system that anticipates viewport movement and content loading needs.

**Specs:**

*   **Content Complexity Analysis Module:**
    *   Input: Raw web content (HTML, CSS, images, video).
    *   Process: Analyzes content to determine visual complexity within defined regions. Metrics include:
        *   Image density/resolution.
        *   Number of DOM elements.
        *   Gradient complexity.
        *   Video/animation presence.
    *   Output: Complexity map overlaid on content. Regions are assigned a ‘complexity score’.

*   **Dynamic Tile Generator:**
    *   Input: Content, Complexity Map, User Viewport.
    *   Process:
        1.  Initial Tile Grid:  Creates a base grid of tiles (e.g., 256x256 pixels).
        2.  Adaptive Subdivision:
            *   Tiles with high complexity scores are recursively subdivided into smaller tiles (e.g., 128x128, 64x64).  Subdivision continues until the complexity score within the tile falls below a threshold, or a minimum tile size is reached.
            *   Tiles with low complexity scores remain at the base size.
        3.  Viewport Priority: Tiles intersecting or near the viewport are given higher priority for rendering.
        4.  Output: Variable-sized tile grid optimized for content complexity and viewport proximity.

*   **Predictive Prefetching Engine:**
    *   Input: User Interaction Data (mouse movements, scrolling speed, viewport position), Content Complexity Map, Rendering Pipeline Status.
    *   Process:
        1.  Interaction Pattern Analysis: Tracks user interaction patterns to predict viewport movement. Algorithms include:
            *   Linear extrapolation of scrolling velocity.
            *   Heatmap-based analysis of frequently viewed content.
            *   Gaze tracking (if available).
        2.  Content Dependency Graph: Builds a graph of content dependencies (e.g., images, videos, linked resources).
        3.  Prefetch Queue:  Based on predicted viewport movement and content dependencies, a prefetch queue is generated.  Tiles and resources needed for upcoming viewport sections are added to the queue.
        4.  Asynchronous Resource Loading: Resources in the prefetch queue are loaded asynchronously in the background.
        5.  Output: Prefetched tiles and resources ready for immediate rendering.

*   **Memory Management:**
    *   Utilizes a tiered memory system (RAM, SSD) to store tiles.
    *   Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction policy for cached tiles.
    *   Automatic tile compression/decompression based on available memory.

**Pseudocode (Prefetching Engine):**

```
function predictNextViewport(user_interaction_data):
    // Analyze scrolling speed, mouse movements, etc.
    predicted_viewport = extrapolate_viewport_position(user_interaction_data)
    return predicted_viewport

function generatePrefetchQueue(predicted_viewport, content_dependency_graph):
    prefetch_queue = []
    // Identify tiles within/near predicted viewport
    candidate_tiles = findTilesWithinViewport(predicted_viewport)
    // Add dependent resources to queue
    for tile in candidate_tiles:
        for resource in getTileResources(tile):
            if resource not in prefetch_queue:
                prefetch_queue.append(resource)
    return prefetch_queue

function asynchronousLoadResources(prefetch_queue):
    // Load resources in parallel
    for resource in prefetch_queue:
        loadResource(resource) // Load asynchronously
```

**Benefits:**

*   Reduced latency and improved perceived performance.
*   Optimized memory usage.
*   Adaptable to varying content complexity and user behavior.
*   More fluid user experience.
