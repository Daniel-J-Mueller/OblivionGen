## Multi-Band Metamaterial Lens Integration

**Concept:** Integrate a dynamically configurable metamaterial lens *above* the overlaid phased array antennas to beamform and steer signals in both frequency bands â€“ but also to create dynamically shaped beam patterns not possible with phased arrays alone. This moves beyond simple beam steering to true beam *shaping*.

**Specs:**

*   **Metamaterial Lens Composition:** Array of individually addressable sub-wavelength resonant structures (split ring resonators, cut wires, or similar) fabricated on a dielectric substrate. Materials: high-permittivity dielectric (e.g., strontium titanate) for increased sensitivity and lower loss.
*   **Lens Geometry:** Planar, conformal to the overlaid antenna structure. Dimensions: Scalable, matching the active area of the combined phased arrays. Target dimensions: 50mm x 50mm for initial prototype.
*   **Addressing Scheme:** Each metamaterial element is connected to a micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) switch or a low-voltage transistor network enabling dynamic control of its resonance frequency and phase shift.
*   **Control System:** A dedicated FPGA-based controller manages the addressing of individual metamaterial elements. Input: Beam steering angles, desired beam shape parameters (e.g., width, sidelobe level), and frequency band. Output: Control signals for the MEMS switches/transistors.
*   **Frequency Range:** Designed to operate across both frequency bands of the underlying phased arrays (18.3-19.3 GHz and 28.5-29.1 GHz).
*   **Integration Method:** Low-profile integration *above* the existing antenna arrays, minimizing interference and maintaining a compact form factor. Potential methods: Adhesive bonding or a micro-pin connector interface.

**Operation:**

1.  The control system receives the desired beam steering angles and beam shape parameters.
2.  Based on these parameters, the control system calculates the required phase shifts for each metamaterial element.
3.  The control system sends control signals to the MEMS switches/transistors, adjusting the resonance frequency and phase shift of each element.
4.  The metamaterial lens acts as a spatial filter, shaping the radiated beam from the underlying phased arrays. This enables:
    *   **Enhanced Beam Steering:** Precise steering of the beam in both frequency bands.
    *   **Dynamic Beam Shaping:** Creation of arbitrary beam patterns, including wide beams, narrow beams, and beams with nulls in specific directions.
    *   **Polarization Control:** Manipulation of the polarization of the radiated signal.
5.  The phased array antenna and metamaterial lens operate in conjunction to provide a highly flexible and adaptable communication system.

**Pseudocode (Control Algorithm):**

```
// Input: Desired beam steering angles (theta, phi), beam shape parameters (width, sidelobe level), frequency band
// Output: Control signals for metamaterial elements

function calculate_control_signals(theta, phi, width, sidelobe_level, frequency_band) {
    // 1. Calculate desired phase shift profile for the desired beam shape and steering angles
    phase_shift_profile = calculate_phase_shift(theta, phi, width, sidelobe_level);

    // 2. Map the phase shift profile to the metamaterial element control signals
    //    This requires calibration data to account for element characteristics and coupling effects.
    control_signals = map_phase_to_control(phase_shift_profile, calibration_data);

    // 3. Account for frequency-dependent effects.  Calibrate for each band.
    if (frequency_band == "high") {
        // Apply high-frequency calibration
    } else {
        // Apply low-frequency calibration
    }

    return control_signals;
}
```

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Significantly improved beamforming capabilities.
*   Enhanced signal quality and reliability.
*   Increased communication range.
*   Greater flexibility and adaptability.
*   Potential for advanced applications such as beam division multiple access (BDMA).
