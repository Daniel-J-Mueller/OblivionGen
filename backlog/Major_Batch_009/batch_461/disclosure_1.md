## Modular Rack Cooling System with Integrated Power & Data

**Concept:** A rack-level cooling system that integrates power delivery, data connections, and active cooling into a modular, easily replaceable unit that mounts within standard server rack bays. This shifts cooling from room-level to rack-level and enables targeted cooling of high-density components.

**Specs:**

*   **Module Dimensions:** 4U (standard rack unit height) x 19” (standard rack width) x variable depth (based on cooling capacity - 6", 9", 12" options)
*   **Cooling Method:** Liquid cooling via microchannel heat exchangers. Sealed, self-contained loop with redundant pumps & fans.  Dielectric fluid (e.g., Fluorinert) for electrical safety.
*   **Heat Exchanger Capacity:** Modules rated for 5kW, 10kW, 15kW, and 20kW heat dissipation.
*   **Power Delivery:** Integrated Power Distribution Units (PDUs) within each module. Support for both AC and DC power inputs.  Redundant power feeds.  Hot-swappable power supplies. Output: 12V, 48V, configurable per port.
*   **Data Connectivity:** Integrated high-density data connectors (QSFP+, SFP+, RJ45) on the module's front panel.  Direct connection to server NICs.  Passthrough cabling to adjacent racks.
*   **Monitoring & Control:**  Each module equipped with sensors for temperature, flow rate, power consumption, and fan speed.  Remote monitoring and control via a dedicated management interface (REST API). Predictive failure analysis.
*   **Modularity:** Modules designed for easy insertion and removal.  Hot-swappable.  No tools required.  Standardized mounting rails.
*   **Redundancy:** Dual pumps, fans, and power supplies. Automatic failover.
*   **Material:** Lightweight aluminum alloy chassis. Durable plastic components.

**Pseudocode (Module Control Logic):**

```
// Main Loop
while (true) {
  // Read sensor data
  temperature = readTemperatureSensor();
  flowRate = readFlowRateSensor();
  powerConsumption = readPowerConsumptionSensor();
  fanSpeed = readFanSpeedSensor();

  // Calculate optimal fan speed based on temperature & flow rate
  optimalFanSpeed = calculateOptimalFanSpeed(temperature, flowRate);

  // Adjust fan speed
  setFanSpeed(optimalFanSpeed);

  // Check for pump failures
  if (pump1Failed() || pump2Failed()) {
    activateBackupPump();
    sendAlert("Pump Failure Detected");
  }

  // Check for overheating
  if (temperature > threshold) {
    sendAlert("Overheating Detected");
    // Initiate emergency shutdown if necessary
  }

  // Log data
  logData(temperature, flowRate, powerConsumption, fanSpeed);

  sleep(1 second);
}
```

**Innovation:** This system moves the cooling loop directly to the rack level, reducing dependency on room-level cooling, improving efficiency, and allowing for targeted cooling. The integration of power and data connections into the same modular unit simplifies rack infrastructure and reduces cabling clutter. This design is particularly suited for high-density computing environments like data centers and edge computing deployments.
