## Dynamic Dimensional Swapping with Adaptive Granularity

**Concept:** Expand upon the matrix transposition concept by introducing *dynamic* and *adaptive* dimensional swapping, going beyond simple row/column transformations. The system will allow swapping of *any* dimensions of multi-dimensional arrays, and the granularity of the swap (block size) will be determined *during* runtime based on data characteristics. This aims to optimize data flow for diverse neural network architectures and data types.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Representation:** Input data is represented as N-dimensional arrays (tensors). The system must support arbitrary dimensionality (N >= 2).
*   **Dimensionality Map:** Maintain a ‘Dimensionality Map’ representing the current ordering of dimensions. Example: [0, 1, 2, 3] means the original data is accessed in that order. This map is dynamically updated during operations.
*   **Swap Operation:** A ‘Swap’ operation takes as input:
    *   Dimension Index 1 (d1)
    *   Dimension Index 2 (d2)
    *   Block Size (bs) – The size of data blocks to be swapped along the dimensions.
*   **Adaptive Block Size Determination:** Implement a runtime analysis module to determine the optimal block size for swaps. This module considers:
    *   Data distribution along the swapped dimensions (e.g., variance, entropy).
    *   Hardware characteristics (cache sizes, memory bandwidth).
    *   Target neural network layer’s input requirements.
*   **Memory Management:** Utilize a tiered memory system:
    *   **Scratchpad Memory:** Small, fast memory for frequently accessed blocks.
    *   **Main Memory:** Larger capacity, slower access.
    *   **Persistent Storage:** For large datasets exceeding main memory.
*   **Parallel Processing:** Leverage data parallelism to perform swap operations concurrently across multiple processing units (cores, GPUs).
*   **Data Flow Graph:** Construct a data flow graph representing the sequence of swap operations required for a given neural network layer.

**Pseudocode (Swap Operation):**

```
function SwapDimensions(data, d1, d2, bs):
  // data: N-dimensional array
  // d1, d2: Indices of dimensions to swap
  // bs: Block size

  // 1. Calculate indices for the block to be swapped
  start_index = [0] * N
  end_index = [0] * N

  // 2. Iterate through blocks along the dimensions
  while (true):
    // 3. Extract the block of data from the input array
    block = ExtractBlock(data, start_index, end_index)

    // 4. Transpose the block along d1 and d2
    transposed_block = TransposeBlock(block, d1, d2)

    // 5. Write the transposed block back to the input array
    WriteBlock(data, start_index, end_index, transposed_block)

    // 6. Increment indices to move to the next block
    //    (handle boundary conditions)

    if (reached end of data):
      break
```

**Hardware Considerations:**

*   **Configurable Interconnect:** A flexible interconnect network allowing data to be routed dynamically between processing units and memory banks.
*   **Local Scratchpad Memory:** Each processing unit should have access to local scratchpad memory for caching frequently accessed data blocks.
*   **High-Bandwidth Memory Interface:** A fast memory interface (e.g., HBM) to minimize memory access latency.
