## Autonomous Container Repositioning with Dynamic Stability Adjustment

**System Overview:**

A system designed to proactively identify and correct minor instabilities *during* the stacking process, not just confirm placement *after* stacking. This goes beyond simple confirmation of position and weight and actively adjusts the stacking configuration in real-time.

**Core Components:**

*   **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) on Containers:** Each container is fitted with a tri-axis IMU (accelerometer & gyroscope) to measure its real-time orientation and movement. These units communicate wirelessly with a central processing unit.
*   **Micro-Actuators Integrated into Transportation Unit:** The bed of the transportation unit (truck, ship, train) is equipped with a network of low-profile, high-precision micro-actuators – essentially miniature hydraulic or pneumatic pistons.  These actuators are positioned to exert localized force on the base of each container.
*   **Central Processing Unit (CPU) & Algorithm:** The CPU receives data from the container IMUs and utilizes a predictive stability algorithm. This algorithm analyzes the combined center of gravity, potential sway, and external factors (road grade, turning, wind gusts) to anticipate and counteract instability.
*   **Wireless Communication Network:** A robust, low-latency wireless network connecting the container IMUs, micro-actuators, and CPU.
*   **Projection System Integration:** Utilizes the existing projection system (from the provided patent) not just for *initial* guidance, but for continuous feedback. The projection displays real-time stability metrics & ‘corrective action’ indicators for the stacking agent.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```
//Initialization

  for each container in containerList {
    readIMUData(container)
    calculateContainerOrientation(container)
    calculateCombinedCenterOfGravity()
    predictStability(combinedCenterOfGravity, externalFactors)

    if (predictedInstability > threshold) {
      calculateCorrectiveForce(container)
      activateMicroActuators(container, correctiveForce)
      updateProjectionSystem(container, correctiveForce) // Visual cue for operator
    }
  }
}
```
