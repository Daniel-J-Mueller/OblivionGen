## Adaptive Acoustic Camouflage System

**System Overview:** A system utilizing phased ultrasonic arrays to actively create “acoustic shadows” and redirect sound waves around an object, effectively rendering it less detectable via sound-based detection methods. This builds on the patent's use of ultrasonic signals but moves beyond simple presence detection towards active manipulation of the acoustic environment.

**Core Components:**

*   **Ultrasonic Transducer Array:** A dense array of individually controlled ultrasonic transducers (minimum 1000 elements) arranged in a configurable surface. The array will be flexible and conformable to various object shapes.
*   **Microphone Array:** High-sensitivity microphone array (minimum 64 elements) for capturing ambient sound and the object’s acoustic signature.
*   **Signal Processing Unit:** Dedicated processing unit (FPGA/ASIC) for real-time signal analysis, phase/amplitude control of transducers, and adaptive algorithm execution.
*   **Power Supply:** High-capacity power supply capable of driving the transducer array.
*   **Object Mapping System:**  A system to initially map the geometry of the object to be concealed. This can be done via laser scanning, structured light, or user input.
*   **Environmental Analysis Module:** A module to analyze the environment surrounding the object, identifying potential sound sources and reflective surfaces.

**Operational Specs:**

1.  **Initial Calibration:** The Object Mapping System scans the object to create a 3D model. The Environmental Analysis Module analyzes the surrounding environment.
2.  **Acoustic Signature Capture:** The Microphone Array captures the object’s inherent acoustic signature (sound it emits).
3.  **Phase/Amplitude Calculation:** The Signal Processing Unit calculates the necessary phase and amplitude for each transducer element in the array, to create destructive interference patterns around the object. This calculation accounts for:
    *   Object geometry
    *   Object acoustic signature
    *   Environmental sound sources (identified by the microphone array)
    *   Frequency characteristics of incoming sounds
4.  **Transducer Activation:** The Signal Processing Unit activates the transducer array, emitting ultrasonic signals with the calculated phase and amplitude for each element.
5.  **Adaptive Adjustment:** The Microphone Array continuously monitors the sound field around the object. The Signal Processing Unit analyzes the sound field and adjusts the phase/amplitude of the transducer elements in real-time to maintain the acoustic shadow. This operates on a millisecond timescale.
6.  **Frequency Sweeping:** Implement a frequency sweep (similar to claim 3, but extended range) to optimize acoustic cancellation across a wider range of frequencies. The sweep range: 20 kHz - 80 kHz.
7.  **Directional Focusing:** The array can be programmed to focus acoustic energy in a specific direction, creating a localized "quiet zone" or distorting sound perceived by observers.

**Algorithm Pseudocode (Adaptive Cancellation):**

```
// Inputs: Microphone array data (m), Object geometry (o), Environmental sound data (e)
// Outputs: Transducer array control signals (t)

function adaptive_cancellation(m, o, e):
  // 1. Frequency Transform
  m_fft = FFT(m)
  e_fft = FFT(e)

  // 2. Error Calculation (Difference between received sound and environmental sound)
  error_fft = m_fft - e_fft

  // 3. Filter Design (Based on object geometry and error signal)
  filter = design_filter(o, error_fft)

  // 4. Transducer Control Signal Calculation
  t = apply_filter(filter, error_fft)

  // 5. Inverse Frequency Transform
  t_signal = IFFT(t)

  return t_signal
```

**Power Requirements:**  Minimum 500W peak power for the transducer array.  Efficient power amplification is critical.

**Materials:**  Flexible PCB material for the transducer array.  Lightweight, durable housing for the electronics.

**Potential Applications:** Stealth technology, noise cancellation, acoustic cloaking, advanced sonar countermeasures.
