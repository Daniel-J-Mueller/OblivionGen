## Modular Haptic Interface Shell

**Concept:** A portable input/output device shell designed around modular haptic feedback. The core idea is to move beyond simple vibration and offer localized, dynamic tactile sensations across the device's surface. This isn’t about *replacing* a screen, but *augmenting* interaction, providing confirmation, texture, and even rudimentary shape-rendering.

**Specs:**

*   **Form Factor:** Ergonomic shell, approximately 150mm x 70mm x 20mm. Constructed from a durable, slightly flexible polymer. Modular design allowing for swappable panels.
*   **Haptic Actuator Matrix:** The shell will house an array of micro-actuators – piezoelectric benders, shape memory alloys, or microfluidic systems – arranged in a dense grid beneath each swappable panel. Resolution target: 50 actuators per square centimeter.
*   **Swappable Panels:**
    *   **Material Variety:** Panels constructed from diverse materials (smooth plastic, textured rubber, brushed metal, woven fabric) to alter tactile sensation.
    *   **Panel Dimensions:** Standardized dimensions (e.g., 30mm x 30mm) for easy swapping.
    *   **Magnetic Attachment:** Secure, yet easily removable, magnetic attachment mechanism.
*   **Connectivity:**
    *   Bluetooth 5.2 for wireless connection to host device (smartphone, computer).
    *   USB-C for charging and data transfer.
*   **Software Interface:** SDK for developers to define haptic patterns and associate them with on-screen events or application states.  API for controlling actuator matrix.
*   **Power:** Rechargeable lithium-ion battery (approximately 2000mAh) providing 8+ hours of continuous use.
*   **Sensors:** Integrated pressure sensors within each swappable panel to detect user touch and apply haptic feedback accordingly.

**Pseudocode (Haptic Pattern Generation):**

```
function generateHapticPattern(event_type, intensity):
  // event_type: String (e.g., "button_press", "notification", "texture_simulate")
  // intensity: Float (0.0 - 1.0)

  if event_type == "button_press":
    // Activate a localized pulse pattern on the panel corresponding to the button.
    for i in range(panel_width):
      for j in range(panel_height):
        if (i, j) == button_coordinates:
          actuator_matrix[i][j] = intensity * pulse_amplitude
        else:
          actuator_matrix[i][j] = 0

  elif event_type == "notification":
    // Generate a wave pattern across the device.
    for frame in range(wave_duration):
      for i in range(panel_width):
        actuator_matrix[i][frame % panel_height] = intensity * wave_amplitude

  elif event_type == "texture_simulate":
    // Load texture data (heightmap)
    texture_data = load_texture(texture_file)
    for i in range(panel_width):
      for j in range(panel_height):
        actuator_matrix[i][j] = intensity * texture_data[i][j]

  else:
    // Default: Simple vibration
    for i in range(panel_width):
      for j in range(panel_height):
        actuator_matrix[i][j] = intensity * vibration_amplitude
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced mobile gaming experience.
*   Tactile feedback for virtual reality and augmented reality applications.
*   Accessibility tool for visually impaired users.
*   Improved user interface for mobile devices.
*   Haptic communication for remote collaboration.
