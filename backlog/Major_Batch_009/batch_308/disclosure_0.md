## Dynamic Method Migration based on Real-Time Resource Availability

**Concept:** Extend the affinity-based package deployment by incorporating real-time resource availability data and dynamically migrating method executions *during* runtime to optimize performance and resource utilization. The original patent focuses on *static* affinity at deployment. This expands to *dynamic* affinity *during* execution.

**Specs:**

1.  **Resource Monitoring Agent:**
    *   Continuously monitors resource metrics (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, latency) for each available host.
    *   Emits resource availability scores.
    *   Communicates with the Affinity Manager.

2.  **Affinity Manager:**
    *   Receives initial affinity scores from the package deployment stage (as defined in the original patent).
    *   Receives real-time resource availability scores from the Resource Monitoring Agent.
    *   Calculates a *dynamic* affinity score based on a weighted combination of:
        *   Original affinity score (static)
        *   Current resource availability (dynamic)
        *   Method execution cost (estimated cycles, memory footprint)
    *   Implements a migration threshold. If the dynamic affinity score falls below this threshold for a method execution, a migration request is initiated.

3.  **Migration Executor:**
    *   Receives migration requests from the Affinity Manager.
    *   Serializes the execution state of the target method (including local variables, stack frame, etc.).
    *   Transports the serialized state to the target host.
    *   Deserializes the state and resumes execution on the target host.
    *   Handles inter-process communication (IPC) to maintain data consistency.

4.  **Method Instrumentation:**
    *   Methods are instrumented with lightweight tracing code.
    *   Tracing data is used to calculate method execution costs and refine affinity scores.
    *   Tracing data is also used to detect performance anomalies and trigger migration.

**Pseudocode (Affinity Manager):**

```
function calculateDynamicAffinity(originalAffinity, resourceAvailability, executionCost):
    weightOriginal = 0.6
    weightResource = 0.3
    weightCost = 0.1

    dynamicAffinity = (weightOriginal * originalAffinity) +
                      (weightResource * resourceAvailability) +
                      (weightCost * executionCost)

    return dynamicAffinity

function monitorAndMigrate(methodExecution, migrationThreshold):
    dynamicAffinity = calculateDynamicAffinity(methodExecution.originalAffinity,
                                                getHostResourceAvailability(methodExecution.host),
                                                estimateExecutionCost(methodExecution))

    if dynamicAffinity < migrationThreshold:
        requestMigration(methodExecution)
```

**Data Structures:**

*   `MethodExecution`:  (methodId, host, originalAffinity, executionCost, currentHost)
*   `HostResource`: (hostId, cpuLoad, memoryUsage, networkBandwidth, latency)
*   `MigrationRequest`: (methodExecution, targetHost)

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved performance through load balancing.
*   Increased resource utilization.
*   Enhanced system resilience.
*   Adaptive response to changing workloads.
