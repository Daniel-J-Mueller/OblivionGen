## Dynamic Tray Morphology & Item Redirection

**Concept:** Integrate shape-memory alloys (SMAs) into the tray design to dynamically alter the tray’s internal geometry *during* the unloading process, not just pre- or post-. This creates a more targeted ‘kick’ to items, allowing for greater precision in sorting and potentially eliminating the need for a receiving container in some scenarios.

**Specs:**

*   **Tray Material:** Primarily high-impact polymer (ABS or Polycarbonate) with embedded SMA ‘ribs’ or wires forming adjustable internal channels.
*   **SMA Configuration:** SMA elements arranged in a grid pattern along the tray bottom and sides, controlled by individual microcontrollers. Each microcontroller receives signals from the central system based on item identification (camera/sensor).
*   **Channel Formation:** SMAs contract upon electrical stimulation, raising or lowering sections of the tray bottom to form temporary channels. These channels guide the item *laterally* as well as downwards.
*   **Item Detection:**  A camera system (or array of sensors) mounted above the tray conveyor identifies the item’s dimensions and material properties. This data is fed into the controller.
*   **Control Algorithm:** Pseudocode:

```
// Item enters detection zone
ItemData = DetectItem() //Returns item dimensions, material, and desired destination

// Calculate SMA Activation Pattern
ActivationPattern = CalculatePattern(ItemData) //Determines which SMAs to activate and to what degree

// Activate SMAs
ActivateSMAs(ActivationPattern)

// Convey item through unloading station
ConveyItem()

// Deactivate SMAs
DeactivateSMAs()
```

*   **Unloading Precision:** Instead of relying solely on gravity and a ‘kick’ from the tine, the dynamically formed channels guide the item *directly* to the designated output lane.
*   **Output Lanes:** Multiple output lanes, potentially configurable, can receive items sorted by the dynamic tray morphology.
*   **Power Supply:** Low-voltage DC power supplied to each tray via conductive rails or inductive coupling.
*   **Safety Features:** Current limiting circuits to prevent SMA overheating. Emergency shutdown mechanism.
*   **Tray Dimensions:** Standardized dimensions to integrate with existing conveyor systems. Variable depths to accommodate different item sizes.
*   **Integration with Existing System:** Replace existing trays with smart trays. Modify controller software to integrate item detection and SMA control.

**Potential Outcomes:**

*   High-speed, precise sorting without the need for complex robotic arms.
*   Reduced reliance on containers, potentially eliminating container handling costs.
*   Sorting of fragile items without damage.
*   Adaptive sorting capabilities – system can learn and optimize sorting patterns based on item characteristics.
*   Support for ‘just-in-time’ manufacturing processes.
