**Proximity-Based Augmented Reality ‘Memory’ System**

**System Specs:**

*   **Core Component:** A mobile application (iOS and Android) integrated with the core networking system described in the referenced patent.
*   **Data Storage:** Utilizes the existing user relationship and location data infrastructure. Augments it with a new “Memory Anchor” data type.
*   **Memory Anchor:** A user-defined digital ‘marker’ tied to a specific geographic location (lat/long with radius).  Can include text, images, video, audio recordings, or links to external content.  Privacy settings determine who can view/contribute to a Memory Anchor.
*   **AR Engine:** Integrates with ARKit (iOS) and ARCore (Android) for spatial anchoring and overlay.
*   **Proximity Trigger:** When a user (and their contact, as per permissions established in the original patent) enters the proximity radius of a Memory Anchor created by another user, the AR engine overlays the associated content onto the user’s camera view.
*   **Content Types:**
    *   **Static Overlay:** Text or images fixed in the AR space.
    *   **Dynamic Content:** Short video or audio clips triggered by proximity.
    *   **Interactive Elements:** AR-based buttons or links that allow users to engage with the content.
*   **Permission Control:**  Leverages the existing permission system.  A user can grant specific contacts permission to *view* their Memory Anchors, *contribute* to them (add content), or both.
*   **“Ephemeral” Anchors:** Option to create Anchors with a time limit. After the time expires, the Anchor is automatically deleted.
*   **Anchor ‘Layers’:** Users can categorize Memory Anchors into layers (e.g., “Personal,” “Work,” “Historical”).  Users can choose which layers are visible.
*   **Privacy Mode:** User-controlled option to temporarily disable Memory Anchor visibility for privacy.
*   **Social Feed Integration:** A dedicated feed within the app showcasing Memory Anchors created by contacts (based on permission settings).

**Pseudocode (Notification & AR Trigger):**

```
// Server-Side
function processLocationUpdate(userLocation) {
  // 1. Query database for Memory Anchors within proximity of userLocation
  anchors = queryMemoryAnchors(userLocation, proximityRadius)

  // 2. Filter Anchors based on user's permissions and contact relationships
  visibleAnchors = filterAnchors(anchors, user, permissions)

  // 3. If visible Anchors exist, send AR trigger notification to user's device
  if (visibleAnchors.length > 0) {
    sendARNotification(user.deviceId, visibleAnchors)
  }
}

// Client-Side (AR Engine)
function handleARNotification(anchorData) {
  // 1. Decode anchorData (location, content type, content URL/data)
  decodedData = decodeAnchorData(anchorData)

  // 2. Use ARKit/ARCore to anchor content to the specified location
  anchorContent(decodedData.location, decodedData.contentType, decodedData.content)

  // 3. Display content in user’s camera view
}
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Location-Based Reminders:** Leave yourself a reminder at a specific location (e.g., "Pick up dry cleaning" at the dry cleaner's).
*   **Shared Memories:** Friends can leave virtual "tags" at places they've visited together, creating a shared AR scrapbook.
*   **Historical Information:** Museums or historical sites can create AR overlays that provide information about specific landmarks.
*   **Gamification:**  AR-based treasure hunts or location-based challenges.
*   **Event Markers:**  Tag locations for ongoing or past events.
*   **Personal Storytelling:** Construct AR tours of significant places in your life.
