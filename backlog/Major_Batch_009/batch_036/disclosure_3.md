## Dynamic Event Payload Augmentation

**Specification:** A system to dynamically augment event payloads with contextual data derived from real-time data streams *before* message delivery to the virtual compute system. This is an extension to the described event-driven architecture.

**Concept:** The existing system delivers event messages triggering code execution. This builds on that by adding a layer that enriches those messages with dynamic, streaming data *before* they reach the compute system. This allows the executed code to operate with a more comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of the environment.

**Components:**

*   **Event Interception Module:** Sits between the event triggering computing system (e.g., storage system, database) and the message queue. Intercepts event messages.
*   **Contextual Data Stream Connectors:** A configurable set of connectors to various real-time data streams. Examples:
    *   Geolocation Services (IP address to location)
    *   Market Data Feeds (stock prices, cryptocurrency rates)
    *   Social Media Trends (trending topics, sentiment analysis)
    *   IoT Sensor Data (temperature, humidity, pressure)
    *   User Profile Data (from a CRM or user database)
*   **Data Enrichment Engine:**  Responsible for:
    *   Identifying relevant data streams for a specific event. (Configured via rules or ML)
    *   Querying the identified data streams.
    *   Formatting the retrieved data into a structured format.
    *   Appending the formatted data to the original event message.
*   **Message Queue System:** Receives the augmented event message.
*   **Virtual Compute System:** Executes the code based on the augmented event.

**Workflow:**

1.  An event occurs on the event triggering computing system.
2.  The event message is sent to the Event Interception Module.
3.  The Event Interception Module consults a configuration (or ML model) to determine which data streams are relevant to the event.
4.  The Data Enrichment Engine queries the relevant data streams and retrieves the necessary data.
5.  The Data Enrichment Engine formats the retrieved data and appends it to the event message.
6.  The augmented event message is sent to the Message Queue System.
7.  The Virtual Compute System receives the augmented event message and executes the code.

**Pseudocode (Data Enrichment Engine):**

```
function enrichEvent(eventMessage):
    relevantDataStreams = getRelevantDataStreams(eventMessage.eventType)
    enrichedData = {}
    for stream in relevantDataStreams:
        streamData = queryStream(stream, eventMessage) // Stream specific query
        enrichedData.update(streamData)
    eventMessage.addData(enrichedData)
    return eventMessage
```

**Example:**

Event: File uploaded to remote storage.

Augmentation:  Geolocate the uploader's IP address. Retrieve the uploader’s user profile data (e.g., subscription level, preferred language).  Append this data to the event message. The code executed on the virtual compute system can now tailor its response based on the uploader’s location and profile.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Enhanced code functionality: Code can react to real-time conditions and user context.
*   Personalization: Enable highly personalized experiences.
*   Dynamic pricing and promotions: Adjust pricing based on location, demand, or user behavior.
*   Fraud detection: Identify potentially fraudulent activity based on real-time data.
*   Proactive decision-making:  Trigger actions based on predicted outcomes.
