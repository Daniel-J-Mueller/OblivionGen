## Dynamic Contextual Audio Layers

**Concept:** Extend the arc gesture navigation system to support layered audio contexts, allowing users to progressively reveal more detailed information about secondary content *without* interrupting the primary audio stream. Think of it like peeling back layers of an onion, each layer adding depth.

**Specs:**

*   **Core Functionality:** Build upon the existing arc gesture detection. Introduce a 'hold duration' parameter for arc gestures. Short holds trigger basic supplemental audio (as per the patent). Longer holds initiate a 'context layer' sequence.
*   **Context Layers:** Define 'context layers' associated with each secondary content item (footnotes, definitions, etc.). These layers contain progressively detailed information – a short summary, a more detailed explanation, examples, related concepts, and potentially even interactive elements (e.g., a link to a relevant online resource).
*   **Audio Modulation:** Implement dynamic audio modulation. When a user performs a long-hold arc gesture, the primary audio stream *slightly* reduces in volume (e.g., -3dB) to highlight the supplemental audio layer.  Subsequent long holds cycle through the available context layers, adjusting audio levels accordingly.
*   **Gesture Variation:** Introduce 'sweep direction' as a modifier.  A left-to-right sweep during a long hold advances to the next context layer. A right-to-left sweep reverts to the previous layer. Upward/downward sweeps could control audio volume of the layer or activate specific layer features (e.g., pausing/playing examples).
*   **Visual Feedback:**  Provide visual feedback on the current context layer. This could be a simple numerical indicator ("Layer 2 of 4") or a more sophisticated graphical representation of the layer’s content.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Variables
currentLayer = 0;
maxLayers = 4;  // Define maximum layers per secondary content item
primaryAudioVolume = 1.0;
layerVolume = 0.7;

// Event: Arc Gesture Detected
function onArcGesture(gestureDuration, sweepDirection) {

  if (gestureDuration < shortHoldThreshold) {
    // Trigger basic supplemental audio (as per the patent)
    playSupplementalAudio();
  } else {
    if (sweepDirection == "left") {
      currentLayer = (currentLayer + 1) % maxLayers;  // Advance layer
    } else if (sweepDirection == "right") {
      currentLayer = (currentLayer - 1 + maxLayers) % maxLayers; // Revert layer
    }

    // Adjust audio volumes
    primaryAudioVolume = 0.7;
    layerVolume = 1.0;

    // Play audio for current layer
    playLayerAudio(currentLayer);

  }
}
```

**Hardware Implications:**

*   Requires a touch-sensitive input device capable of accurately detecting gesture duration and direction.
*   A robust audio processing engine to handle dynamic volume adjustments and layer mixing.
*   Sufficient memory to store multiple audio layers for each secondary content item.
