## Dynamic Behavioral Sandboxing with AI-Driven Anomaly Prediction

**Concept:** Extend the frequency-of-use monitoring to create a dynamic behavioral sandbox. Instead of just flagging deviations from established frequency, actively *predict* future behavior based on learned patterns and then constrain execution outside those predicted bounds.

**Specifications:**

**1. Core Monitoring & Prediction Engine:**

*   **Data Collection:** Monitor all invoked portions of a software package (classes, methods, functions – per patent).  Record invocation frequency *and* the sequence of invocations (execution trace).  Include contextual data: time of day, user/process initiating the call, data passed as arguments.
*   **Model Training:** Employ a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) – specifically, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network – to learn the normal behavioral patterns.  Train the LSTM on the collected execution traces.  The LSTM will predict the *probability* of the next invoked portion of the software given the current execution state.  Separate models can be trained for different users or roles, improving accuracy.
*   **Anomaly Scoring:**  For each new invocation, the LSTM predicts the probability of that invocation occurring given the execution history.  An anomaly score is calculated based on the inverse of this probability.  Higher scores indicate greater deviation from the learned baseline.
*   **Thresholding & Adaptation:**  Dynamically adjust anomaly score thresholds based on a rolling average of recent scores.  This accounts for legitimate, albeit infrequent, behavior changes.  Implement a feedback loop where flagged anomalies (validated by a security analyst) are used to retrain the LSTM, improving its accuracy over time.

**2. Dynamic Sandboxing Constraints:**

*   **Granular Control:** Implement multiple levels of sandboxing constraint based on anomaly score:
    *   **Low Anomaly:**  Allow execution with detailed logging.
    *   **Medium Anomaly:**  Restrict access to sensitive resources (network, file system, memory regions).  Virtualize the execution environment – limit its impact on the host system.
    *   **High Anomaly:**  Immediately terminate the process. Isolate the process entirely. Trigger an automated security response (e.g., malware scan).
*   **Resource Allocation:**  Dynamic resource allocation to sandboxed processes based on anomaly score.  Constrain CPU, memory, and network bandwidth.
*   **Input/Output Monitoring:**  Monitor all input and output operations of sandboxed processes.  Detect and block malicious data transfers.
*   **API Interception:** Intercept API calls made by the sandboxed process.  Validate arguments and return values.  Simulate API behavior to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.

**3.  System Architecture:**

*   **Agent:** A lightweight agent deployed on the target system to monitor software execution and collect data.
*   **Centralized Prediction Server:** A server hosting the LSTM models and responsible for anomaly scoring.  Scalable architecture to handle a large number of agents.
*   **Policy Engine:** Defines the sandboxing constraints and actions to take based on anomaly scores.  Configurable via a user interface or API.
*   **Data Store:** Stores execution traces, anomaly scores, and policy configurations.
*   **API:** Allows integration with other security tools and systems.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Scoring):**

```
function calculateAnomalyScore(executionHistory, currentInvocation):
  predictedProbability = LSTM_Model.predictNextInvocation(executionHistory, currentInvocation)
  if predictedProbability == 0:
    anomalyScore = 1.0 //Maximum anomaly
  else:
    anomalyScore = 1.0 / predictedProbability
  return anomalyScore
```

**Enhancements:**

*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Use GANs to generate synthetic execution traces for training the LSTM, augmenting limited real-world data.
*   **Federated Learning:** Train the LSTM models in a decentralized manner across multiple systems, preserving privacy and improving scalability.
*   **Reinforcement Learning:** Use reinforcement learning to optimize the sandboxing constraints and actions based on the observed behavior of sandboxed processes.
*   **Cross-Process Behavioral Analysis:** Correlate behavior across multiple processes to detect coordinated attacks.
