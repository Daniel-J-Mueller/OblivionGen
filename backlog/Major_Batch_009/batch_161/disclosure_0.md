## Dynamic Load Balancing with Predictive Failure Mitigation – Data Center Rack Level

**Concept:** Implement a rack-level power distribution system that *predicts* component failures within the dual-corded power supply system *before* they occur, dynamically shifting load *proactively* to healthy components, and minimizing downtime.  This goes beyond the reactive failure handling described in the patent by introducing a predictive element and finer-grained load control.

**Specs:**

*   **Rack Power Distribution Units (PDUs) – Enhanced:** PDUs will be equipped with individual outlet current sensing (accurate to ±0.1A), voltage monitoring, and temperature sensors.  Each outlet will be independently controllable via a solid-state switch (MOSFET based).
*   **Real-Time Data Acquisition & Analysis:** A rack-level controller (microcontroller or embedded system) will collect data from all PDU outlets, environmental sensors (temperature, humidity), and potentially even the power supplies themselves (if they expose relevant telemetry – voltage, current, internal temperature).
*   **Predictive Failure Modeling:** Implement a machine learning model (running on the rack controller or a central server) trained on historical power supply failure data, current draw patterns, temperature readings, and voltage fluctuations. The model will predict the *probability of failure* for each power supply inlet. Algorithms to consider include:
    *   **Time-Series Forecasting:**  Using algorithms like ARIMA or LSTM to detect anomalies in current draw that indicate potential failure.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Using algorithms like Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM to identify unusual operating conditions.
    *   **Regression Models:** Predicting remaining useful life based on current stress factors.
*   **Dynamic Load Balancing Algorithm:**
    ```pseudocode
    // Inputs:
    //   power_supply_a_failure_probability: Probability of failure for power supply inlet A
    //   power_supply_b_failure_probability: Probability of failure for power supply inlet B
    //   current_draw_a: Current draw on inlet A
    //   current_draw_b: Current draw on inlet B
    //   max_current_per_inlet: Maximum current capacity of each inlet
    //   target_load_balance: Desired load balance ratio (e.g., 50/50)

    function adjust_load(ps_a_prob, ps_b_prob, current_a, current_b, max_current, target_balance):
      // Calculate risk-adjusted load factor
      risk_a = ps_a_prob  //Higher prob, higher risk
      risk_b = ps_b_prob
      
      //Calculate overall load differential
      load_differential = (current_a - current_b) / (max_current * 2) // Normalized to between -1 to +1

      // Adjust load based on risk and differential
      adjustment_factor = (risk_a - risk_b) + load_differential //Combine risk and load

      //Cap the adjustment factor for stability (e.g. limit to +/- 0.2 of max current)
      max_adjustment = max_current * 0.2

      if adjustment_factor > max_adjustment:
          adjustment_factor = max_adjustment
      if adjustment_factor < -max_adjustment:
          adjustment_factor = -max_adjustment
      
      //Shift load from one supply to the other
      new_current_a = current_a - adjustment_factor
      new_current_b = current_b + adjustment_factor

      //Ensure current limits are not exceeded
      if new_current_a > max_current:
          new_current_a = max_current
      if new_current_b > max_current:
          new_current_b = max_current
          
      //Apply the adjusted current via PDU outlet control (solid state switches)
      control_pdu_outlets(new_current_a, new_current_b)

      return new_current_a, new_current_b
    ```
*   **Redundancy & Failover:** If a power supply *does* fail, the system seamlessly shifts the entire load to the remaining healthy inlet.
*   **Communication:** Rack controllers communicate with a central management system for monitoring, data aggregation, and model retraining.
* **Data Logging**: All sensor data, predictive model outputs, and load adjustments will be logged for historical analysis and model improvement.

**Innovation:** This system moves beyond *reacting* to failures, to *anticipating* them and proactively shifting load, extending the lifespan of power supplies, and maximizing uptime.  The rack-level granularity allows for much finer-grained control than traditional PDU-level balancing.  The predictive model, constantly refined with historical data, will become more accurate over time.
