## Automated Quality Control & Dynamic Pricing via Multi-Spectral Imaging & AI

**Concept:** Integrate multi-spectral imaging with the item detection system to assess item quality in real-time and dynamically adjust pricing *at the point of transition*. This goes beyond simple item identification to evaluate attributes like ripeness (produce), damage (fragile goods), or authenticity (branded items).

**System Components:**

*   **Multi-Spectral Camera Array:** Positioned within the transition area (ceiling/wall mounted), capturing images across a wider spectrum than standard RGB. Minimum 6 bands (UV, Blue, Green, Red, Near-Infrared, Thermal).
*   **High-Speed Processing Unit:** Dedicated hardware for real-time image processing and analysis.
*   **AI/Machine Learning Models:** Pre-trained models for quality assessment of various item categories. Models continuously refined with data from the system.
*   **Dynamic Pricing Engine:** Integrates quality assessment data with inventory levels, demand, and pre-defined pricing rules.
*   **User Interface (Display/Mobile App):** Presents adjusted pricing and quality information to the user. Optionally, provides visual feedback on quality assessment (e.g., highlighting blemishes).
*   **Weight Sensor Integration:** Confirms weight aligns with expected quality (e.g. a ‘bad’ apple will likely be lighter than a good one)

**Operational Flow:**

1.  User enters the transition area with items.
2.  The antenna detects the user/tote.
3.  The multi-spectral camera array captures images of the items.
4.  The high-speed processing unit analyzes the images using the AI/ML models to assess quality.
5.  The dynamic pricing engine calculates the adjusted price based on quality, demand, and inventory.
6.  The adjusted price is displayed to the user.
7.  The system records the quality data and pricing information.
8.  Transaction completes, updating inventory and quality logs.

**Pseudocode (Quality Assessment & Pricing):**

```
// Function: AssessItemQuality(image_data, item_category)
// Input: image_data (multi-spectral image), item_category (string)
// Output: quality_score (float, 0.0 - 1.0), defect_data (array of defect locations/types)
function AssessItemQuality(image_data, item_category) {
  // Load appropriate ML model for item_category
  model = LoadModel(item_category);

  // Process image data with model
  results = model.Predict(image_data);

  // Extract quality score and defect data
  quality_score = results.quality;
  defect_data = results.defects;

  return {quality_score, defect_data};
}

// Function: CalculateAdjustedPrice(base_price, quality_score)
// Input: base_price (float), quality_score (float)
// Output: adjusted_price (float)
function CalculateAdjustedPrice(base_price, quality_score) {
  // Define price adjustment tiers
  if (quality_score >= 0.9) {
    adjustment = 0.0; // No adjustment for premium quality
  } else if (quality_score >= 0.7) {
    adjustment = -0.10; // 10% discount for good quality
  } else if (quality_score >= 0.5) {
    adjustment = -0.25; // 25% discount for acceptable quality
  } else {
    adjustment = -0.50; // 50% discount for poor quality
  }

  adjusted_price = base_price * (1 + adjustment);
  return adjusted_price;
}

// Main Loop:
while (true) {
  // Detect user/tote
  user = DetectUser();

  // Identify items
  items = IdentifyItems(user);

  for (item in items) {
    // Get base price
    base_price = GetBasePrice(item.id);

    // Assess quality
    quality_data = AssessItemQuality(item.image_data, item.category);

    // Calculate adjusted price
    adjusted_price = CalculateAdjustedPrice(base_price, quality_data.quality);

    // Display price to user
    DisplayPrice(user, item, adjusted_price);
  }
}
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   **Automated Rejection:** System automatically rejects items below a certain quality threshold.
*   **Customer Preference Learning:**  System learns individual customer preferences for quality vs. price.
*   **Supply Chain Optimization:**  Quality data shared with suppliers to improve product quality at the source.
*   **Integration with Robotics:** Robotic arms selectively pick ‘good’ items for the user.
