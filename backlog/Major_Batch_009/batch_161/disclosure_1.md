## Adaptive Network Topology via Distributed AI Agents

**Concept:** Implement a self-healing, dynamically reconfigurable network topology using distributed AI agents embedded within both network switches *and* optical modules. This moves beyond simple failure detection and remediation to *proactive* network optimization based on predicted traffic patterns and component health.

**Specs:**

*   **Agent Distribution:** Each network switch and optical module will house a lightweight AI agent. Agents communicate via a dedicated, low-latency side channel separate from the primary data path.
*   **Data Collection:** Agents collect data beyond traditional performance metrics. This includes:
    *   Real-time traffic flow analysis (source/destination, bandwidth usage, application type).
    *   Component health data (DSP temperature, laser bias current, switch ASIC utilization).
    *   Environmental data (temperature, humidity - from sensors integrated into the hardware).
    *   Predictive data (forecasted bandwidth needs based on historical patterns and known events).
*   **AI Model:** Utilize a federated learning approach. Each agent maintains a local model trained on its own data. Models are periodically aggregated (securely) to create a global model, improving overall network awareness. The base model is a Graph Neural Network (GNN) capable of representing the network topology and predicting link congestion/failure.
*   **Topology Control:** Agents collaborate to propose and enact network topology changes. These changes can include:
    *   Dynamic rerouting of traffic around congested or failing links.
    *   Activation of redundant paths.
    *   Adjustment of optical module transmit power to optimize signal quality.
    *   Micro-segmentation of network traffic based on application priority.
*   **Control Protocol:** A custom control protocol operates on the side channel. This protocol prioritizes rapid response times and includes mechanisms for:
    *   Agent discovery and registration.
    *   Topology information exchange.
    *   Proposal submission and voting.
    *   Policy enforcement (e.g., preventing routing loops).
*   **Hardware Integration:**
    *   Optical modules require a microcontroller with sufficient processing power and memory to host the AI agent and execute model inference.
    *   Network switches need dedicated hardware acceleration for AI inference to minimize latency.
    *   A secure element within each device protects the AI model and control protocol from tampering.
*   **Learning Phases**:
    *   **Initial Training**: A centralized system provides initial training data to all edge AI agents.
    *   **Federated Learning**: Each agent continuously learns from local data and participates in global model updates.
    *   **Reinforcement Learning**: An RL agent monitors network performance and rewards actions that improve key metrics.

**Pseudocode (Agent Collaboration â€“ Failure Remediation)**

```
// Agent on Switch S detects link failure to Optical Module O
function onLinkFailure(link, opticalModule) {
  broadcastFailureNotification(link, opticalModule);
  requestAlternativePaths(opticalModule);
}

// Agent on Optical Module receives failure notification
function onReceiveFailureNotification(switch, link) {
  evaluateAlternativePaths(switch);
  proposeNewRoute(switch);
}

function evaluateAlternativePaths(switch) {
  // Access local GNN model
  // Query model with current network state and requested destination
  // Return list of potential alternative routes with associated costs (latency, bandwidth, congestion)
}

function proposeNewRoute(switch) {
  // Select best route from list of alternatives
  // Send route proposal to switch
}

// Switch receives route proposal
function onReceiveRouteProposal(opticalModule, proposedRoute) {
  // Validate proposed route
  // If valid, update routing table
  // Redirect traffic to new route
}
