## Dynamic Intent Weaving for Proactive User Guidance

**Concept:** Expand upon the intent grouping by not just *detecting* unexpected behavior, but proactively *weaving* user intent in real-time to guide them toward expected, successful outcomes. This moves beyond reactive fraud detection to an assistive, personalized user experience.

**Specifications:**

**I. Core Data Structures:**

*   `UserIntentProfile`: Stores a user’s historical path data, weighted intent groupings (from the existing patent), and a “drift score” representing deviation from expected behavior.
*   `IntentWeave`: A dynamic graph representing potential paths aligned with high-probability intent groupings. Nodes represent page/content states, edges represent user actions (clicks, form submissions, etc.). Edge weights represent action probability based on historical data.
*   `GuidanceModule`:  A set of configurable rules that define how to subtly influence user behavior toward desired paths (e.g., highlighting relevant links, pre-populating forms, suggesting alternative content).

**II.  System Components:**

1.  **Intent Profiler:**
    *   Input: User path data (content requests, topology info).
    *   Function:  Creates/updates `UserIntentProfile`, calculating intent grouping weights and drift score.
    *   Output: Updated `UserIntentProfile`.

2.  **Intent Weaver:**
    *   Input: `UserIntentProfile`, Site Topology.
    *   Function: Dynamically generates/updates `IntentWeave` graph, prioritizing edges based on intent grouping weights.  Handles edge decay over time to reflect evolving user behavior.
    *   Output: `IntentWeave` graph.

3.  **Path Deviation Analyzer:**
    *   Input: Current user path, `IntentWeave` graph, `UserIntentProfile`.
    *   Function:  Compares the current path to the `IntentWeave`. Calculates a “deviation distance” representing how far the user has strayed from expected paths.  Triggers Guidance Module if deviation distance exceeds a threshold.
    *   Output: Deviation distance, trigger signal for Guidance Module.

4.  **Guidance Module:**
    *   Input: Deviation distance, `UserIntentProfile`, Site Topology.
    *   Function:  Selects and applies subtle guidance interventions based on the deviation distance and user profile. Examples:
        *   *Highlighting relevant links:*  Increase the visual prominence of links that align with the preferred intent path.
        *   *Personalized content suggestions:* Recommend content that is likely to steer the user toward a successful outcome.
        *   *Proactive form pre-population:* Automatically fill in form fields based on the user's historical data.
        *   *Dynamic FAQ display:* Show relevant FAQs to address potential points of confusion.
    *   Output:  Modified content/UI presented to the user.

**III. Pseudocode (Path Deviation Analyzer & Guidance Module interaction):**

```
function analyzePath(userPath, intentWeave, userIntentProfile):
  deviationDistance = calculateDeviation(userPath, intentWeave)
  if deviationDistance > threshold:
    guidanceIntervention = selectIntervention(deviationDistance, userIntentProfile)
    applyIntervention(guidanceIntervention)
  return

function selectIntervention(deviationDistance, userIntentProfile):
  # Simple example: higher deviation = more aggressive intervention
  if deviationDistance > 0.75:
    return "HighlightRelevantLinks"
  elif deviationDistance > 0.5:
    return "PersonalizedContentSuggestion"
  else:
    return "DynamicFAQDisplay"

function applyIntervention(interventionType):
  # Modify the UI/Content to apply the selected intervention.
  # (Implementation details depend on the specific intervention type)
```

**IV. Novelty/Differentiation:**

This approach goes beyond simply identifying *unexpected* behavior; it actively attempts to *influence* behavior toward desired outcomes, creating a more proactive and personalized user experience.  It's a shift from reactive fraud detection to assistive guidance.  The dynamic intent weaving and adjustable intervention levels allow for fine-grained control and optimization. This also has potential applications beyond fraud detection – improved user onboarding, increased conversion rates, and personalized support.
