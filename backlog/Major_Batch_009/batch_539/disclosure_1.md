## Dynamic Session Credential 'Scoring' & Adaptive Trust

**Concept:** Augment session credentials with a dynamic 'trust score' that adapts *during* a session, influencing resource access in real-time. This moves beyond initial authentication to continuous risk assessment.

**Specifications:**

**1. Trust Score Components:**

*   **Behavioral Biometrics:** Continuously monitor user interaction – keystroke dynamics, mouse movements, scroll speed, application switching patterns. Deviations from established baselines contribute to score adjustments.
*   **Geo-Fencing & Movement Analysis:** Track device location and movement patterns.  Sudden, unexpected location changes or rapid movement raise score penalties.
*   **Data Access Patterns:** Analyze *what* data is being accessed, *when*, and *how*.  Accessing sensitive data outside of typical working hours, or accessing an unusually large amount of data, lowers the score.
*   **Network Analysis:**  Monitor network characteristics – IP address changes, unusual traffic patterns, connections from Tor or VPNs – and adjust the score accordingly.
*   **Resource Usage:** Track CPU, memory, and bandwidth usage. Spikes or unusual patterns can indicate compromise.

**2. Credential Augmentation:**

*   The initial session credential (token) includes a base trust score (e.g., 100).
*   Each trust component (listed above) contributes to a weighted score adjustment.
*   The current trust score is digitally signed and embedded *within* the session credential.  This ensures integrity and prevents tampering.

**3. Adaptive Access Control:**

*   Resource access control policies are redefined to incorporate the trust score.  Example:
    *   Access to Tier 1 data requires a trust score >= 90.
    *   Access to Tier 2 data requires a trust score >= 70.
    *   Access to Tier 3 data requires a trust score >= 50.
*   If the trust score drops below a threshold, access is automatically restricted or requires re-authentication.
*   The trust score is re-evaluated continuously (e.g., every 5-10 seconds).

**4. Scoring Engine Pseudocode:**

```
function calculateTrustScore(sessionToken, userBehaviorData, locationData, networkData, resourceAccessData):
  baseScore = sessionToken.baseTrustScore

  behaviorScore = analyzeUserBehavior(userBehaviorData) // Returns a score between -20 and +20
  locationScore = analyzeLocation(locationData)        // Returns a score between -15 and +15
  networkScore = analyzeNetwork(networkData)          // Returns a score between -10 and +10
  accessScore = analyzeResourceAccess(resourceAccessData) // Returns a score between -5 and +5

  weightedScore = (behaviorScore * 0.4) + (locationScore * 0.3) + (networkScore * 0.2) + (accessScore * 0.1)

  currentTrustScore = baseScore + weightedScore

  //Clamp score between 0 and 100
  currentTrustScore = max(0, min(100, currentTrustScore))

  return currentTrustScore
```

**5. Credential Update Mechanism:**

*   The scoring engine periodically updates the trust score *within* the session credential.
*   A cryptographic signing mechanism ensures the integrity of the updated credential.
*   Resources verify the signature before honoring the credential.

**6.  Anomaly Detection & Alerting:**

*   Significant drops in the trust score trigger automated alerts to security administrators.
*   The system logs all trust score changes and related events for auditing purposes.



This system creates a 'living' session credential that constantly adapts to the user's behavior and environment, providing a more granular and dynamic level of access control. It moves beyond static authentication to continuous risk assessment, reducing the attack surface and improving overall security.
