## Dynamic Focal Plane Array for Volumetric Capture

**Concept:** Expanding on the idea of depth mapping through light source/reflector manipulation, we can create a system capable of *volumetric* capture – not just a depth map of a surface, but a full 3D reconstruction of a scene in real-time. This leverages a dynamic array of micro-reflectors/lenses and a time-of-flight sensor.

**System Specs:**

*   **Light Source:** High-frequency pulsed laser array (potentially VCSELs). The pulsing is critical for Time-of-Flight (ToF) calculations. Wavelength chosen based on sensor sensitivity and material reflectivity characteristics (850nm or 940nm are potential candidates).
*   **Micro-Reflector/Lens Array:** A 2D array (e.g., 64x64 or higher resolution) of individually addressable micro-mirrors or micro-lenses, each capable of steering or focusing a laser pulse. These are controlled via a dedicated microcontroller.  Each element acts as a 'virtual light source'.
*   **Time-of-Flight (ToF) Sensor:** A high-resolution ToF sensor array synchronized with the laser array and micro-reflector array. This sensor measures the time it takes for each laser pulse to return after reflecting off an object.
*   **Control System:** A high-performance processor (FPGA preferred for parallel processing) that orchestrates the laser firing sequence, micro-reflector steering, and data acquisition from the ToF sensor.
*   **Synchronization:** Precise hardware synchronization between the laser array, micro-reflector array, and ToF sensor is essential.
*   **Cooling System:**  High-power laser and processing elements require effective cooling to maintain stable operation.

**Operational Procedure:**

1.  **Scanning Pattern:** The control system directs each micro-reflector/lens to sequentially aim a laser pulse at a specific point in the scene. This creates a virtual scanning pattern. The scanning isn’t limited to raster – complex 3D scanning patterns are possible.
2.  **Pulse Emission & Reflection:** The laser array emits a short pulse. The micro-reflector/lens directs this pulse towards a target.
3.  **Time-of-Flight Measurement:** The ToF sensor measures the time it takes for the reflected pulse to return. This time is directly proportional to the distance between the sensor and the object.
4.  **Point Cloud Generation:** The control system combines the distance measurements from each micro-reflector/lens element to create a dense point cloud representing the 3D geometry of the scene.
5.  **Volumetric Reconstruction:** The point cloud is processed to create a volumetric reconstruction of the scene – effectively a 3D model.
6. **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system dynamically adjusts the scanning pattern based on the point cloud data, focusing on areas with high detail or complex geometry.

**Pseudocode (Control System):**

```pseudocode
Initialize LaserArray, MicroReflectorArray, ToFArray

FOR each element in MicroReflectorArray DO
    Set element angle (x, y, z) – based on scan pattern
END FOR

FOR each element in LaserArray DO
    Emit pulse
END FOR

Capture data from ToFArray

Calculate distance for each element based on time-of-flight

Create point cloud data structure

Populate point cloud with distance and angle data

Apply filtering and noise reduction to point cloud

Generate 3D model from point cloud

REPEAT
    Analyze point cloud for areas of interest
    Adjust scan pattern to focus on those areas
END REPEAT
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Real-time 3D scanning and modeling
*   Autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance
*   Volumetric video capture
*   Medical imaging
*   Industrial inspection

**Novelty:** The combination of a dynamically controlled micro-reflector/lens array with a high-resolution ToF sensor enables real-time volumetric capture, far exceeding the capabilities of existing depth mapping systems. It moves beyond surface reconstruction to true 3D scene understanding.
