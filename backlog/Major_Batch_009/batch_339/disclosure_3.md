## Adaptive Workflow Sharding with Predictive Failure Mitigation

**Concept:** Extend the remote repository/orchestration framework to dynamically adjust workflow sharding (division into smaller tasks) *during* execution, based on real-time host performance and *predicted* failure rates for specific task subsets. This isnâ€™t just about retrying failed tasks; it's proactively re-architecting the workflow *while it's running* to maximize throughput and minimize overall failure probability.

**Specification:**

**1. Performance Monitoring & Prediction Module:**

*   **Data Collection:** Each host reports resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O, network) at a configurable granularity (e.g., 500ms).  Also reports task completion times and any error/exception details.
*   **Historical Data Storage:**  A time-series database stores historical performance data for each host, tagged with the specific workflow task being executed.
*   **Predictive Model:** A machine learning model (e.g., a recurrent neural network or a gradient boosting machine) is trained on the historical data.  The model predicts the probability of failure for a given task on a given host, *before* the task begins. Input features include host resource utilization, task characteristics (estimated execution time, input data size), and recent task history on that host.
*   **Failure Cost:** Each task is assigned a "failure cost" based on its criticality and the effort required to retry it. This informs sharding decisions.

**2. Dynamic Sharding Engine:**

*   **Initial Sharding:** The workflow is initially divided into tasks based on dependencies and data partitioning.
*   **Real-time Assessment:** As tasks are assigned to hosts, the Predictive Model calculates the failure probability for each task/host combination.
*   **Sharding Adjustment:**
    *   If the predicted failure probability for a task on its assigned host exceeds a threshold, the Dynamic Sharding Engine re-assigns the task to a different host with a lower predicted failure probability.
    *   If a host is consistently exhibiting high failure rates, the Engine dynamically reduces the number of tasks assigned to that host, redistributing the load to healthier hosts.
    *   The Engine can *split* large tasks into smaller subtasks and distribute them across multiple hosts, even if it increases the total number of tasks. This reduces the impact of individual task failures.
*   **Dependencies:**  The Engine maintains a dependency graph of tasks and ensures that any sharding adjustments do not violate these dependencies.  A task cannot be moved to a host until all of its input dependencies are available on that host.

**3. Repository Integration:**

*   **Task Metadata:** The remote repository stores metadata about each task, including its dependencies, input data location, estimated execution time, and failure cost.
*   **Dynamic Task Allocation:** The orchestration layer retrieves task metadata from the repository and uses it to make sharding decisions.
*   **State Management:** The repository stores the current state of the workflow, including which tasks have been completed, which are in progress, and which have failed.

**Pseudocode (Sharding Adjustment Logic):**

```
function adjust_sharding(task, assigned_host):
  failure_probability = predict_failure_probability(task, assigned_host)
  if failure_probability > FAILURE_THRESHOLD:
    candidate_hosts = find_candidate_hosts(task) // Hosts with sufficient resources and low predicted failure rate
    if candidate_hosts:
      best_host = select_best_host(candidate_hosts) // Based on predicted failure rate, resource availability, and network latency
      move_task_to_host(task, best_host)
      return True  // Sharding adjusted
    else:
      // No suitable alternative host found
      log_warning("No alternative host found for task")
      return False // Sharding not adjusted
  return False // Sharding not adjusted
```

**4. Containerization:**

Each task is executed within a container to provide isolation and reproducibility.

**Potential Benefits:**

*   Improved workflow throughput and reliability.
*   Reduced overall failure probability.
*   Adaptive to changing host conditions and workload patterns.
*   Better resource utilization.
*   Proactive failure mitigation.
