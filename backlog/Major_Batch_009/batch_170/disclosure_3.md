## Dynamic Narrative Camera System

**Concept:** Extend the server-rendered camera views beyond simple observation. Integrate dynamic narrative elements directly into the camera feeds, creating a layered viewing experience. Imagine a battlefield viewed through a security camera, but with contextual information *painted* onto the feed – highlighting enemy movements, predicted trajectories, resource locations, or even story-driven visual effects.

**Specifications:**

*   **Core System:** Build upon the existing server-rendered camera infrastructure. Each camera view (security camera) is assigned a “Narrative Profile.”
*   **Narrative Profiles:** These profiles are configurable data sets defining the types of dynamic elements to be overlaid on the video feed. Example profiles:
    *   *Tactical*: Highlights enemy units, displays health bars, indicates line-of-sight, and predicts movement paths.
    *   *Resource*: Overlays icons indicating resource nodes, displays collection rates, and highlights areas of high concentration.
    *   *Story*: Triggers visual effects (e.g., ghostly apparitions, environmental changes) based on in-game events or player proximity.
*   **Event Triggers:** Define events that activate or modify narrative elements. Events can be:
    *   *Proximity-Based*: Triggers activate when a player or object enters a defined area.
    *   *State-Based*: Triggers activate based on in-game states (e.g., low health, critical objective captured).
    *   *Time-Based*: Triggers activate at specific times or intervals.
*   **Rendering Pipeline Modification:**  The server-side rendering pipeline needs to be modified to:
    1.  Fetch the Narrative Profile associated with the camera view.
    2.  Monitor for Event Triggers.
    3.  Dynamically generate and composite overlay elements onto the video frame.  These overlays *must* be rendered server-side and streamed as part of the video feed. This avoids client-side modifications and ensures consistency.
*   **Client-Side Control:** The client application should allow users to:
    *   Select different Narrative Profiles for each camera view.
    *   Adjust the opacity and size of overlay elements.
    *   Enable/disable specific overlay types.

**Pseudocode (Server-Side):**

```
function RenderCameraFrame(cameraView, frameData) {
  narrativeProfile = GetNarrativeProfile(cameraView)
  eventTriggers = narrativeProfile.eventTriggers

  for each eventTrigger in eventTriggers {
    if (EventTriggerConditionMet(eventTrigger, frameData)) {
      overlayElement = GenerateOverlayElement(eventTrigger.type, eventTrigger.parameters, frameData)
      frameData = CompositeOverlay(frameData, overlayElement)
    }
  }

  return frameData
}
```

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **AI-Driven Narrative Generation:** Utilize AI to dynamically generate narrative elements based on player behavior and in-game events. For example, the AI could highlight strategic opportunities or predict enemy tactics.
*   **User-Created Narrative Profiles:** Allow users to create and share their own Narrative Profiles, fostering a community-driven content creation ecosystem.
*   **Integration with Voice Acting:** Trigger voiceover commentary based on narrative events, further immersing players in the experience.
