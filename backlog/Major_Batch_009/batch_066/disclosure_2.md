## Dynamic Network Topology Mirroring

**Concept:** Extend the virtual network capabilities by dynamically mirroring network topology across virtual networks, allowing for automated disaster recovery, testing, and isolated development environments with production-like configurations.

**Specs:**

*   **Topology Definition Language (TDL):** A declarative language for defining network topology, including nodes (virtual machines, containers, services), connections (protocols, ports, bandwidth), and security policies. TDL should be human-readable and machine-parsable. Example:

    ```tdl
    network: production_us_east
    nodes:
      web_server_1:
        type: vm
        image: ubuntu_latest
        cpu: 4
        memory: 8GB
        ports: [80, 443]
      db_server_1:
        type: container
        image: postgres:latest
        ports: [5432]
    connections:
      web_server_1 <-> db_server_1:
        protocol: tcp
        port: 5432
    security:
      web_server_1 <-> db_server_1:
        firewall_rule: allow_tcp_5432
    ```

*   **Mirroring Service:** A centralized service responsible for receiving TDL definitions, creating mirrored virtual networks, and maintaining synchronization between source and destination networks.

*   **Synchronization Mechanism:** Utilize a combination of techniques for maintaining synchronization:
    *   **Configuration Drift Detection:** Regularly scan source and destination networks for configuration discrepancies (e.g., firewall rules, routing tables, service configurations).
    *   **State Replication:** Replicate critical state information (e.g., session data, database snapshots) between source and destination networks.
    *   **Event-Driven Synchronization:** Monitor for events in the source network (e.g., VM creation, service restart) and automatically propagate changes to the destination network.

*   **Network Virtualization Integration:** Integrate with existing network virtualization technologies (e.g., VLANs, VXLANs, SDN controllers) to create and manage mirrored networks.

*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /networks/mirror`:  Create a mirrored network. Request body: `TDL` definition, destination network ID.
    *   `GET /networks/{network_id}/status`:  Get the synchronization status of a mirrored network.
    *   `DELETE /networks/{network_id}`:  Delete a mirrored network.

**Pseudocode (Mirroring Service - Simplified):**

```python
def create_mirrored_network(tdl_definition, destination_network_id):
    # Parse TDL definition
    network_definition = parse_tdl(tdl_definition)

    # Create virtual network in destination
    destination_network = create_virtual_network(destination_network_id, network_definition)

    # Configure network devices
    configure_network_devices(destination_network, network_definition)

    # Start synchronization process
    start_synchronization(source_network, destination_network)

def start_synchronization(source_network, destination_network):
    # Periodic configuration drift detection
    while True:
        drift_detected = detect_configuration_drift(source_network, destination_network)
        if drift_detected:
            apply_changes_to_destination(source_network, destination_network)

        # State replication (e.g., database snapshots)
        replicate_state(source_network, destination_network)

        # Sleep for a specified interval
        time.sleep(60)
```

**Novelty:**  This extends the basic concept of virtual networking by adding *dynamic* mirroring with continuous synchronization.  This isnâ€™t just about creating a static copy of a network; it's about maintaining a live, up-to-date replica that can be used for disaster recovery, testing, or development without impacting the production environment. The automated synchronization and drift detection are key differentiators. It builds on the communication manager concept, by abstracting topology instead of just individual communication packets.
