## Dynamic Multi-Modal Agent Coaching System

**Concept:** Extend the agent sentiment and emotion analysis to *real-time coaching* during a customer interaction. Not just scoring, but actively providing the agent with immediate, actionable feedback delivered via subtle, non-intrusive cues.

**Specs:**

**1. Core Modules:**

*   **Multi-Modal Input:**
    *   Audio stream from agent & customer.
    *   Text transcript (STT) of both streams.
    *   Agent’s webcam feed (optional – for micro-expression analysis).
*   **Feature Extraction:**
    *   Sentiment Analysis (as per patent – customer & agent).
    *   Emotion Detection (as per patent – customer & agent).
    *   *Agent Speech Analysis:*  Pace, tone, volume, pauses, filler words ("um", "ah").
    *   *Agent Visual Analysis (if webcam enabled):* Micro-expression detection (anger, frustration, boredom), eye gaze direction, head pose.
    *   *Customer Interaction History:* Access to CRM data – past interactions, known issues, customer lifetime value.
*   **Coaching Engine:**
    *   **Rule-Based System:** Defines thresholds for sentiment, emotion, speech patterns.  (e.g., “If customer frustration exceeds 7/10 AND agent pace is above 200WPM, trigger ‘Slow Down’ cue”).
    *   **Reinforcement Learning Agent:**  Trained on successful/unsuccessful customer interactions.  Learns to predict the optimal coaching cue to maximize customer satisfaction.
*   **Output/Cue Delivery:**
    *   *Haptic Feedback:*  Subtle vibrations in the agent’s headset (intensity & pattern represent coaching cue).
    *   *Visual Cues:*  Subtle changes in the agent’s monitor display (e.g., color shift, icon highlighting – designed to be peripheral vision only).
    *   *Audio Cues:*  Very subtle changes in the background noise in the agent’s headset (e.g., gentle chime, white noise modulation).
    *   *Real-time Transcript Highlighting:*  Highlights keywords or phrases in the transcript to draw the agent’s attention. (e.g. "customer expressing confusion").

**2. Operational Flow:**

1.  Contact begins. Audio streams & (optionally) video feed are captured.
2.  Feature Extraction module processes the data in real-time.
3.  Coaching Engine analyzes the features and generates a coaching cue (if necessary).
4.  Cue is delivered to the agent via haptic, visual, or audio channels.
5.  System logs the cue, the context, and the subsequent customer response.
6.  Data is used to continuously train the Reinforcement Learning Agent.

**3. Pseudocode (Coaching Engine – simplified):**

```
FUNCTION GenerateCoachingCue(customer_sentiment, customer_emotion, agent_sentiment, agent_emotion, agent_pace, interaction_history):

  IF customer_sentiment < 3 AND customer_emotion == "anger":
    RETURN "Empathize" // Haptic: Slow, pulsing vibration
  ELSE IF customer_sentiment < 5 AND agent_pace > 180:
    RETURN "SlowDown" // Visual: Subtle blue tint on screen edge
  ELSE IF agent_sentiment < 4 AND customer_emotion == "frustration":
    RETURN "PositiveReframing" // Audio: Gentle chime
  ELSE IF interaction_history.issue_complexity > 7 AND agent_pace < 120:
    RETURN "Clarify" // Visual: Highlight key phrases in transcript
  ELSE:
    RETURN "NoCue"
```

**4. Hardware/Software Requirements:**

*   High-quality headsets with haptic feedback capability.
*   Agent workstation with multi-monitor setup.
*   Real-time audio processing library.
*   Machine learning framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch).
*   Cloud-based data storage & processing.
*   API integration with CRM systems.
