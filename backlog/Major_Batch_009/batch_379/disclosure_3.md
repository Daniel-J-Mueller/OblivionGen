## Dynamic Region-of-Interest (ROI) Emphasis with Per-Region AI Style Transfer

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple emphasis data (scalability, quality) by integrating AI-powered style transfer *per region* of the combined video stream. This allows for highly customized visual highlighting of individual participant feeds, going beyond brightness/contrast adjustments.

**Specs:**

*   **Input:** Multiple independently encoded video streams, individual stream metadata.
*   **AI Model:** A suite of pre-trained AI style transfer models (or a dynamically trainable model) capable of applying diverse visual styles to video frames. Styles range from subtle aesthetic shifts to pronounced visual effects (e.g., watercolor, sketch, thermal vision). Models must support real-time or near-real-time processing.
*   **ROI Definition:** The combined stream metadata defines regions corresponding to each participant's video feed, as in the original patent.
*   **Style Mapping:** A user-definable (or AI-driven) mapping between participants and specific AI style transfer models. A central server manages this mapping, allowing for dynamic style assignment during a multi-party session. This is critical, and allows for things like ‘highlighting the speaker’.
*   **Per-Region Processing Pipeline:**
    1.  Extract each regional frame from the combined stream.
    2.  Apply the assigned AI style transfer model to the extracted frame.
    3.  Re-integrate the stylized frame into the combined video stream.
*   **Metadata Extension:** Add metadata to the combined stream indicating the applied style transfer model for each region, enabling client-side rendering adjustments or post-processing. This allows for things like ‘low bandwidth mode’ which swaps models for more performant ones.
*   **Bandwidth Considerations:** Implement a tiered system of style transfer models – high-quality, computationally intensive models for high-bandwidth connections, and lighter-weight models for low-bandwidth connections. The system dynamically selects the appropriate model based on network conditions.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// Server-Side Processing
function combineVideoStreams(streams, styleMapping, bandwidth) {
  combinedStream = new VideoStream()
  for (region in streams) {
    frame = streams[region].getFrame()
    styleModel = styleMapping[region] // Get pre-defined or AI selected model
    if (bandwidth == "low") {
        styleModel = selectLightweightModel(styleModel)
    }
    styledFrame = applyStyleTransfer(frame, styleModel)
    combinedStream.addRegion(styledFrame, region)
  }
  return combinedStream
}

// Client-Side Processing
function renderCombinedStream(stream) {
    for (region in stream.regions) {
        frame = stream.regions[region]
        styleModel = stream.getStyleModel(region) // retrieve for post processing
        // optional post-processing or adjustment
        displayFrame(frame)
    }
}
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   Enhanced multi-party communication: Visually highlight the active speaker, emphasize important visual cues, or create a more engaging and personalized experience.
*   Interactive presentations: Allow presenters to dynamically adjust the visual style of different regions to draw attention to specific content.
*   Remote collaboration: Create a more immersive and collaborative environment by visually emphasizing contributions from different participants.
*   Accessibility features: Apply visual styles that improve clarity for users with visual impairments.
