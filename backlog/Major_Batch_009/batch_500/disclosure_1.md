## Dynamic Poll Context & Predictive Response Options

**Concept:** Expand beyond simple question/answer polls. Utilize real-time contextual data and predictive algorithms to dynamically adjust poll options *during* the response phase, increasing engagement and relevance.

**Specs:**

**1. Contextual Data Acquisition Module:**

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   User device sensors (location, motion, ambient sound, time of day).
    *   Active application data (if permission granted - e.g., music playing, navigation active, calendar events).
    *   External APIs (weather, news, trending topics - opt-in).
*   **Data Processing:**
    *   Sensor fusion to create a contextual profile.
    *   Privacy filtering/anonymization – all data is handled with strict user consent and privacy controls.
    *   Real-time data stream processing.

**2. Predictive Response Algorithm:**

*   **Model:** Utilize a recurrent neural network (RNN) trained on historical poll data, contextual data, and user profiles.
*   **Functionality:**
    *   Predict the most likely response options given the current context and user.
    *   Calculate a "relevance score" for each potential response option.
*   **Dynamic Adjustment:**
    *   If a user hesitates or shows indecision (detected via ASR analysis of ‘umms’ and ‘ahhs’ or inactivity), the system can dynamically suggest alternative, highly relevant options.
    *   Real-time adaptation of options based on aggregate responses – if a certain option becomes clearly dominant, the system can introduce counter-options or nuances.

**3. ASR & NLU Enhancement:**

*   **Intent Disambiguation:**  Expand NLU to recognize implicit intents beyond simple question answering.  e.g., "I'm not sure" or "What do *others* think?".
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyze voice tone and phrasing to gauge user confidence and adapt the poll experience accordingly.
*   **Micro-expression Detection:** Integrate with device cameras (with permission) to detect subtle facial expressions indicating indecision or confusion.

**4.  Interactive Presentation Layer:**

*   **Visual Cues:**  Highlight dynamically suggested options with subtle animations or color changes.
*   **Contextual Information:** Display relevant contextual data alongside the poll options (e.g., “Based on your location, people nearby are leaning towards…”).
*   **Adaptive Difficulty:** Adjust the complexity of poll questions based on user interaction and engagement levels.
*   **Branching Polls:** Incorporate branching logic – based on user responses, the poll can dynamically navigate to different question paths.

**Pseudocode (Response Handling):**

```
// User receives poll question and initial options

while (response_received == false) {

  if (user_hesitation_detected() || inactivity_timeout()) {
    predicted_options = predict_response_options(user_context, poll_data, historical_data);
    display_dynamic_options(predicted_options); // Highlight/suggest options
  }

  if (response_received()) {
    process_response(response, poll_identifier);
    break;
  }

  // Check if time window expires
  if (time_window_expired()) {
      close_poll();
      break;
  }
}
```

**Novelty:** This expands beyond static polls to a dynamic, adaptive experience. It’s about understanding the user’s *context* and providing options that are not just relevant, but *predictively* relevant.  The branching poll functionality allows for significantly more nuanced data collection.
