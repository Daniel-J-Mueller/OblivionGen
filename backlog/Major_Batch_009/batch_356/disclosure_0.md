## Automated Environmental Impact Assessment via UAV Swarm & Spectral Analysis

**System Overview:** A distributed UAV swarm equipped with hyperspectral imaging sensors, operating in conjunction with a ground-based processing unit. This system is designed to automatically assess environmental changes and potential impacts within a designated area, going beyond simple visual surveillance.

**Hardware Specifications:**

*   **UAV Platform:** Small, agile multi-rotor drones (minimum 10-unit swarm capability). Payload capacity: 1.5kg. Flight time: 30 minutes minimum. Equipped with obstacle avoidance systems (LiDAR & visual).
*   **Sensor Payload:** Hyperspectral imager (400-1000nm range, 20nm spectral resolution). Integrated with a high-resolution RGB camera for visual context.
*   **Ground Station:** High-performance computing server with GPU acceleration for image processing. Secure data storage with scalability.
*   **Communication:** Secure, encrypted wireless communication network linking UAVs to ground station, supporting real-time data transmission.

**Software Specifications:**

*   **Swarm Coordination Module:** Algorithms for decentralized swarm control. Features include:
    *   Dynamic task allocation based on area coverage & data needs.
    *   Collision avoidance & path planning.
    *   Automated recharging/docking routines.
    *   Fault tolerance – ability to continue operation with drone failures.
*   **Image Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Geometric Correction:** Orthorectification & georeferencing of hyperspectral imagery.
    *   **Atmospheric Correction:** Removal of atmospheric effects to obtain accurate surface reflectance values.
    *   **Spectral Analysis:** Implementation of algorithms for identifying vegetation species, assessing plant health (NDVI, EVI), detecting water stress, and mapping soil composition.  Uses machine learning models trained on a comprehensive spectral library.
    *   **Change Detection:** Algorithms for automatically identifying changes in land cover, vegetation health, or water resources over time. Compares current imagery to historical data.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identification of unusual spectral signatures that may indicate pollution, disease outbreaks, or other environmental anomalies.
*   **Geo-Fencing Integration:** The system will integrate with existing geo-fence technology, allowing for precise control over the UAV swarm’s operational area. The system will dynamically adjust flight paths to remain within designated boundaries.
*   **Alerting System:** Real-time alerts triggered by detected anomalies or significant changes in environmental conditions.  Alerts include geographic location, visual imagery, spectral data, and severity level.

**Operational Procedure (Pseudocode):**

```
INITIATE_SWARM(area_polygon, sensor_settings)

FOR each drone IN swarm:
    ASSIGN_TASK(drone, area_segment)
    LAUNCH_DRONE(drone)

WHILE all drones are active:
    FOR each drone:
        CAPTURE_IMAGE(drone)
        TRANSMIT_IMAGE(drone)
        PROCESS_IMAGE(image)
            APPLY geometric and atmospheric corrections
            EXTRACT spectral features
            COMPARE features to baseline data
            DETECT anomalies or changes
            GENERATE alert IF significant change detected
            UPDATE environmental map
        NAVIGATE to next area segment

IF drone failure:
    REASSIGN tasks to remaining drones
    INITIATE backup drone launch IF available

END
```

**Data Outputs:**

*   High-resolution orthomosaic imagery with spectral information.
*   Environmental maps showing vegetation types, plant health, soil composition, and water resources.
*   Change detection maps highlighting areas of environmental change.
*   Real-time alerts triggered by detected anomalies or significant changes.
*   Historical data archive for long-term environmental monitoring.
