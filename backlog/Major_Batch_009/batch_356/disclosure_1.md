**System Specifications:**

*   **Core Components:** Active Stylus, Mobile Computing Device (with display), Haptic Actuator Array (integrated into display), Predictive Algorithm Module (software).
*   **Sensors:**
    *   High-Resolution Accelerometer (stylus) - measures stylus orientation and velocity.
    *   Pressure Sensor (stylus tip) – detects contact force.
    *   Micro-Camera (stylus tip) – captures high-resolution image of surface directly under the tip (texture, material).
    *   Barometer (stylus) - altitude/proximity detection.
*   **Communication:** Bluetooth 5.0 (stylus to device).
*   **Power:** Rechargeable Lithium-Ion battery (stylus).

**Functional Description:**

The system aims to simulate realistic textures on a flat touchscreen display by combining visual feedback with localized haptic stimulation. 

1.  **Texture Capture:** As the stylus approaches the screen, the micro-camera captures a high-resolution image of the underlying surface (e.g., a photograph of wood grain, fabric, metal). This image is transmitted to the mobile computing device.
2.  **Texture Analysis & Prediction:** The Predictive Algorithm Module analyzes the captured image to identify texture characteristics (roughness, bumpiness, directionality). It then *predicts* the optimal haptic stimulation pattern needed to simulate that texture. This prediction goes beyond simple grayscale mapping. The algorithm should consider aspects like scale, frequency, and anisotropy.
3.  **Haptic Actuator Control:** The device controls the Haptic Actuator Array to generate a localized haptic pattern corresponding to the predicted texture. The array consists of numerous micro-actuators (e.g., piezoelectric elements, electroactive polymers) capable of individually modulating the surface tension or vibration of the display screen.
4.  **Dynamic Adjustment:** The system continuously monitors stylus position, orientation, and pressure, adjusting the haptic pattern in real-time to maintain a consistent and realistic simulation.  Velocity and acceleration of the stylus should affect the 'feel' of the texture – faster strokes should create the sensation of gliding over a smoother surface.
5. **Predictive Modelling**: The system builds a library of known textures. When a new texture is encountered, the algorithm can leverage the library for partial emulation, combined with the direct capture.
6. **Multi-Modal Integration**: The system can integrate with image and video editing software to allow the creation of haptic overlays for digital content.

**Pseudocode (Prediction Algorithm):**

```
function predictHapticPattern(image):
    textureFeatures = analyzeTexture(image) // extract roughness, directionality, scale
    knownTexture = findClosestMatch(textureFeatures, textureLibrary)

    if knownTexture exists:
        hapticPattern = knownTexture.hapticPattern
        //apply minor adjustments based on current stylus speed and pressure
    else:
        //generate hapticPattern based on textureFeatures using procedural generation
        hapticPattern = generateProceduralHapticPattern(textureFeatures)

    return hapticPattern
```

**Novelty:**

Existing haptic systems typically rely on pre-defined textures or simple grayscale mapping. This system moves beyond that by dynamically generating haptic patterns based on real-time image analysis and predictive algorithms. The use of procedural generation allows the simulation of a wider range of textures, including those not pre-defined in a library. Additionally, integrating stylus velocity and pressure into the haptic feedback loop adds a new dimension to the user experience.
