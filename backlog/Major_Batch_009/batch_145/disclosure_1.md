## Dynamic Preference Weighting via Predicted Link State

**Concept:** Extend the routing capacity assessment by integrating *predicted* link state into preference weighting, moving beyond simple active path counts. This allows for proactive adjustment based on anticipated network conditions, improving resilience and performance.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Collection & Prediction Module:**

*   **Input:** Real-time link state data (bandwidth, latency, packet loss) from network devices. Historical link state data (time series). Predicted network event data (scheduled maintenance, anticipated congestion based on time of day/week, etc.).
*   **Processing:** Employ time series analysis (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future link state for each link in the network. Incorporate predicted network event data into the prediction model. Generate a 'link health score' for each link, reflecting predicted future performance.
*   **Output:**  Time-stamped 'link health scores' for each link. Confidence intervals for each prediction.

**2.  Augmented Routing Capacity Assessment:**

*   **Input:** Active path count (as defined in the original patent). 'Link health scores' for all links along those paths.
*   **Processing:**  Calculate a 'weighted path capacity' for each path. This is achieved by multiplying the 'link health score' of each link in the path. Sum the weighted path capacities for all paths to a given routing prefix.
*   **Output:** 'Weighted path capacity' for each routing prefix.

**3. Dynamic Preference Weighting Module:**

*   **Input:** 'Weighted path capacity' for each routing prefix. Threshold values for 'weighted path capacity' (configurable).
*   **Processing:**
    *   If 'weighted path capacity' exceeds a high threshold, *decrease* the preference weight for the paths towards that prefix. This prevents over-utilization and encourages load balancing.
    *   If 'weighted path capacity' falls below a low threshold, *increase* the preference weight for the paths towards that prefix. This prioritizes traffic to prefixes experiencing degraded performance.
    *   Implement a hysteresis mechanism to prevent rapid oscillation of preference weights.
*   **Output:** Adjusted preference weight for each routing prefix.

**4. Update Packet Transmission:**

*   Transmit update packets (e.g., BGP updates) containing the adjusted preference weights to peer network devices.

**Pseudocode (Dynamic Preference Weighting Module):**

```
function adjust_preference_weight(weighted_path_capacity, high_threshold, low_threshold, current_weight, hysteresis):
  if weighted_path_capacity > high_threshold:
    new_weight = current_weight - adjustment_step
    if new_weight > min_weight:
      return new_weight
    else:
      return min_weight
  else if weighted_path_capacity < low_threshold:
    new_weight = current_weight + adjustment_step
    if new_weight < max_weight:
      return new_weight
    else:
      return max_weight
  else:
    // Within acceptable range â€“ maintain current weight
    return current_weight
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Confidence Intervals:** Incorporate the confidence intervals from the prediction module into the weighting process. Lower confidence should result in more conservative adjustments.
*   **Machine Learning:** Utilize machine learning to dynamically adjust the high/low thresholds and the adjustment step based on network performance.
*   **Scalability:** Design the prediction and weighting modules to scale to large networks.
