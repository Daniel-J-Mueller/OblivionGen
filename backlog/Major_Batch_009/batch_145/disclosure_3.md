## Haptic Command Confirmation System

**Core Concept:** Integrate localized haptic feedback into the device housing to provide users with tactile confirmation of voice commands *before* audible output, enhancing accessibility and reducing ambiguity.

**Specifications:**

*   **Haptic Actuator Array:** Implement an array of small, high-precision linear resonant actuators (LRAs) embedded within the device housing. Density: 20 actuators per 100 square centimeters. Placement: Concentric rings around the base of a cylindrical device, or distributed across the top surface of a rectangular device.
*   **Command Mapping:** Develop a system to map distinct voice commands to unique haptic patterns.
    *   Example: "Play Music" – Rapid, pulsing vibration in a clockwise direction. "Set Timer" – Three distinct taps. "Increase Volume" – Gradual increase in vibration intensity.
    *   Pattern Library: A library of at least 50 distinct haptic patterns.
*   **Proximity Sensor Integration:** Include an infrared proximity sensor to detect user hand position relative to the housing. The haptic feedback intensity should scale with proximity - closer hand = stronger vibration.
*   **Microprocessor Control:** Utilize a dedicated low-power microprocessor to manage haptic pattern generation and proximity sensor data.
*   **Voice Activity Detection (VAD):** Implement VAD to trigger the haptic feedback *immediately* after the system recognizes a complete command, *before* any audible response.
*   **User Customization:** Allow users to customize haptic patterns for frequently used commands via a companion app.
*    **Emergency Override**: A distinct, high-intensity haptic pattern (e.g., rapid, irregular pulsing) to indicate an emergency alert or critical system notification.

**Pseudocode:**

```
// On voice command detection:
function onCommandDetected(command) {
  // Get haptic pattern associated with command
  hapticPattern = getHapticPattern(command);

  // Get user proximity
  proximity = readProximitySensor();

  // Adjust haptic intensity based on proximity
  intensity = map(proximity, 0, 10, 30, 100);

  // Activate haptic actuators with adjusted intensity
  activateHapticArray(hapticPattern, intensity);

  // Initiate audible output after a short delay
  delay(200); //0.2 seconds
  playAudio(command);
}
```

**Materials:**

*   Housing: High-density polymer or aluminum alloy.
*   Actuators: Linear Resonant Actuators (LRAs) – small size, low power consumption.
*   Microprocessor: ARM Cortex-M series.
*   Proximity Sensor: Infrared Reflective Sensor.
*   Wiring: Flexible printed circuit (FPC) for actuator connections.
