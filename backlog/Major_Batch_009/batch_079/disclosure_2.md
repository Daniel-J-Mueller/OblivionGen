## Seed Tree Delegation with Dynamic Key Aging

**Concept:** Extend the seed tree delegation concept to incorporate a dynamic key aging system. Instead of static one-time-use keys derived directly from subordinate seeds, introduce a time-based decay mechanism. This allows for a degree of re-use, with diminishing security over time, offering a trade-off between key generation overhead and security. This would be useful in environments where continuous operation is critical, and occasional key compromise is acceptable within defined boundaries.

**Specifications:**

**1. Seed Tree Generation - Modified:**

*   Standard seed tree generation as per the core patent, establishing the root and subordinate nodes.
*   Each subordinate seed node is tagged with an 'Epoch Value'. The Epoch represents a time window for key validity.
*   A ‘Decay Factor’ is associated with each Epoch. This value dictates the rate at which keys derived from that Epoch lose security over time.  Higher decay factors mean faster security degradation.

**2. Key Derivation – Enhanced:**

*   Key generators receive not only the subordinate seed value but also the associated Epoch Value and Decay Factor.
*   The key derivation function now incorporates a timestamp.
*   The derived key is a function of:  `Key = Hash(SubordinateSeed, Timestamp, EpochValue, DecayFactor)`.
*   The Decay Factor influences the hash function – increasing its entropy over time. This can be achieved by iteratively applying a simple cryptographic transformation to the seed value based on elapsed time since the Epoch began. For example: `Seed_Aged = Hash(Seed, ElapsedTimeSinceEpochStart, DecayFactor)`.

**3. Master Hash Tree Integration - Modified:**

*   The Master Hash Tree includes not only the root hashes of key generator hash trees but also the Epoch Value and Decay Factor for each set of derived keys.
*   This allows the signature authority to track the age and security level of keys in use.
*   A ‘Security Threshold’ can be set. Keys below this threshold are automatically revoked or flagged for increased monitoring.

**4. Revocation Mechanism - Added:**

*   A ‘Revocation List’ is maintained, listing Epoch Values that have exceeded the Security Threshold.
*   The Master Hash Tree contains a pointer to the Revocation List.
*   Verifiers check the Revocation List to ensure keys used for signature verification are still valid.

**Pseudocode (Key Derivation):**

```
function DeriveKey(SubordinateSeed, Timestamp, EpochValue, DecayFactor):
  ElapsedTime = Timestamp - EpochValue
  AgedSeed = Hash(SubordinateSeed, ElapsedTime, DecayFactor)
  DerivedKey = Hash(AgedSeed, RandomSalt) // Standard key derivation with salt
  return DerivedKey
```

**System Components:**

*   **Seed Authority:**  Manages seed tree generation, epoch values, and decay factors.
*   **Key Generators:** Derive keys from subordinate seeds, incorporating timestamps and decay factors.
*   **Signature Authority:** Generates the Master Hash Tree and maintains the Revocation List.
*   **Verifiers:** Validate signatures, check the Master Hash Tree, and consult the Revocation List.

**Security Considerations:**

*   Careful selection of Decay Factors is critical. Too low, and keys remain valid for too long. Too high, and the system becomes impractical due to frequent key rotation.
*   Timestamps must be synchronized across all system components to prevent time-based attacks.
*   The Revocation List must be protected from tampering.
