## Dynamic Reconfigurable Interconnect for FPGA Partition Debug

**Specification:** A system enabling dynamically reconfigurable communication pathways *between* FPGA partitions, specifically aimed at facilitating advanced debugging scenarios beyond simple data transmission to host processes.

**Concept:** The provided patent details isolated accelerator partitions with dedicated debug data pathways. This design expands on that by creating a mesh-like interconnect *within* the FPGA fabric, allowing debug data from one partition to be routed to another partition’s debug tools – or even to a dedicated ‘debug partition’.

**Hardware Components:**

*   **Reconfigurable Interconnect Fabric:**  A network of programmable switches and routing channels within the FPGA, separate from the primary application logic. This is not a general-purpose interconnect; it's optimized for low-latency, high-bandwidth debug data transfer.  Utilizes dedicated LUTs and routing resources.
*   **Debug Partition:** A small, dedicated FPGA partition containing advanced debug tools: waveform viewers, logic analyzers, performance counters, and potentially even a simplified emulation environment.
*   **Partition Interface Modules (PIMs):** Each accelerator (and host) partition includes a PIM.  The PIM handles data packaging/unpacking for the interconnect, address translation, and access control.
*   **Debug Request/Response Protocol:** A lightweight protocol for partitions to request debug data from other partitions, and for the requested data to be routed through the interconnect.

**Software/Firmware Components:**

*   **Debug Manager:** A process running on the host (or potentially within the host partition) that manages debug requests, routes data, and controls the debug tools within the debug partition.
*   **Partition Debug Agents:** Small firmware modules within each accelerator partition that respond to debug requests and provide access to internal signals.
*   **Dynamic Routing Engine:**  Firmware that configures the reconfigurable interconnect based on debug requests and routing policies.

**Operational Pseudocode:**

```pseudocode
// Host Debug Manager
function initiate_debug_session(source_partition, target_partition, debug_request):
    debug_request_id = generate_unique_id()
    send_debug_request(source_partition, target_partition, debug_request_id, debug_request)
    route_interconnect(source_partition, target_partition, debug_request_id) //Configure interconnect paths

// Accelerator Partition (receiving request)
on receive_debug_request(debug_request_id, debug_request):
    data = execute_debug_request(debug_request)  // Capture data
    send_debug_data(debug_request_id, data)

// Interconnect Routing (executed by host/dedicated partition)
function route_interconnect(source, destination, request_id):
    //Algorithm to find best path through interconnect fabric
    //Considers bandwidth, latency, and contention
    configure_switches(path, request_id)  //Program interconnect for data flow
```

**Innovation Highlights:**

*   **Cross-Partition Debugging:** Allows in-situ debugging of interactions between different FPGA partitions.
*   **Advanced Debug Scenarios:** Enables complex debugging workflows, such as tracing data flow across multiple partitions or comparing signals in real-time.
*   **Dynamic Debug Infrastructure:** The reconfigurable interconnect can be adapted to different debug scenarios without requiring hardware modifications.
*   **Reduced Host Load:** By offloading debug processing to the debug partition, the host computer is freed up to perform other tasks.

**Potential Applications:**

*   High-performance computing
*   Network processing
*   Image and video processing
*   Artificial intelligence
*   Security applications
