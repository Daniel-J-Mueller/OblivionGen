## Dynamic Operation Cost Modulation

**Concept:** Extend the tag-based authorization to dynamically modulate the cost (compute, network, etc.) of invoking an operation, based on real-time system load and semantic similarity to authorized operations.  This isn’t just *can* you do it, but *how much* it costs to do it, tying authorization to resource consumption.

**Specifications:**

**1. Operation Cost Profile Database:**

*   **Data Structure:** Key-Value store.
    *   **Key:** Operation Tag (as defined in the provided patent).
    *   **Value:** Cost Profile object.
        *   `base_cost`:  Integer.  Base resource units (e.g., CPU cycles, network bandwidth) required for operation execution.
        *   `load_multiplier_function`:  Function pointer/reference.  Accepts system load (float 0-1) as input and returns a multiplier (float). Example: `f(load) = 1 + (load * 0.5)` –  increases cost by 50% at 100% load.
        *   `similarity_discount_function`: Function pointer/reference. Accepts a similarity score (float 0-1) to authorized operations, and returns a discount factor (float 0-1).  Example: `f(similarity) = similarity * 0.2` – applies up to a 20% discount if the operation is highly similar to previously authorized ones.
        *   `time_of_day_modulation`: Array of tuples representing time windows and corresponding cost multipliers. Useful for off-peak pricing.

**2. Authorization & Cost Calculation Module:**

*   **Input:** Security Principal, Operation Tag, System Load (reported by system monitoring service), Operation Semantic Profile (described below).
*   **Process:**
    1.  Retrieve Cost Profile associated with Operation Tag.
    2.  Calculate Load Multiplier using `load_multiplier_function` and System Load.
    3.  Calculate Similarity Score between requested operation and authorized operations. This requires the "Operation Semantic Profile" (see below).
    4.  Calculate Discount Factor using `similarity_discount_function` and Similarity Score.
    5.  Calculate Final Operation Cost: `Final Cost = base_cost * Load Multiplier * (1 - Discount Factor)`
    6.  If the Security Principal has sufficient resource allocation/budget, authorize the operation.  Return the Final Cost.
    7.  If insufficient resources, deny the operation and return an error.

**3. Operation Semantic Profile Generation:**

*   **Method:**  Employ a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to generate a vector embedding representing the semantic meaning of the operation.  This embedding captures the operation’s intent and effects.
*   **Input:** Operation Description (text), Input Parameters (data types and values).
*   **Output:** Vector Embedding (e.g., a 512-dimensional float array).
*   **Storage:** Store the Vector Embedding alongside the Operation Tag.  Use a vector database for efficient similarity searching.

**4. Similarity Calculation:**

*   **Method:**  Use cosine similarity to compare the Vector Embedding of the requested operation with the Vector Embeddings of the Security Principal's authorized operations.
*   **Input:** Vector Embedding of requested operation, Vector Embeddings of authorized operations.
*   **Output:** Similarity Score (float 0-1).

**Pseudocode:**

```
function authorize_operation(security_principal, operation_tag, system_load, operation_semantic_profile):
  cost_profile = get_cost_profile(operation_tag)
  load_multiplier = cost_profile.load_multiplier_function(system_load)
  similarity_score = calculate_similarity(operation_semantic_profile, security_principal.authorized_operations)
  discount_factor = cost_profile.similarity_discount_function(similarity_score)
  final_cost = cost_profile.base_cost * load_multiplier * (1 - discount_factor)

  if security_principal.resource_allocation >= final_cost:
    security_principal.resource_allocation -= final_cost
    return final_cost  // Operation authorized
  else:
    return ERROR // Operation denied
```

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Dynamic Cost Profile Updates:**  Automatically adjust Cost Profiles based on real-time system performance and usage patterns.
*   **Resource Quotas:** Implement resource quotas for Security Principals to prevent abuse and ensure fair access.
*   **Cost Visualization:** Provide a dashboard for Security Principals to monitor their resource consumption and costs.
*   **Integration with Budgeting Tools:** Integrate with existing budgeting and cost management tools.
