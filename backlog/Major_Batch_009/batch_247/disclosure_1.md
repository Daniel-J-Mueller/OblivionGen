## Adaptive Beacon Constellation for Subterranean Navigation

**Concept:** Expand beacon deployment beyond simple localization for lost UAVs to proactive, adaptive mapping and navigation *within* complex, GPS-denied environments like caves, mines, or collapsed structures. The system will use varied beacon types, deployment strategies, and dynamic network formation for robust, high-resolution 3D mapping and path planning.

**System Specs:**

*   **Beacon Types:**
    *   *Anchor Beacons:* High-power, long-range radio/acoustic beacons. Minimal onboard processing. Deployed strategically (manually or via secondary UAV) *before* primary mission. Act as fixed reference points.
    *   *Relay Beacons:* Medium-power, short-range radio/acoustic/visual beacons. Equipped with basic processing and mesh networking capability. Deployed *during* primary mission (from main UAV or dropped in clusters). Extend range and fill gaps in coverage.
    *   *Mapping Beacons:* Low-power, visual/inertial beacons. Equipped with miniature LiDAR/stereo vision and IMU. Primarily for localized, high-resolution mapping. Deployed in a ‘swarm’ pattern.

*   **Deployment Mechanism:**
    *   Modular bay system allowing for mixed beacon payloads.
    *   Variable drop patterns (linear, radial, swarm).
    *   Trajectory prediction for optimal beacon dispersion given wind/air currents.
    *   Small catapult/compressed air launching system for individual beacon deployment.

*   **UAV Integration:**
    *   Multi-spectral camera (visual, infrared, LiDAR) for initial environment assessment.
    *   Onboard processing for beacon signal triangulation, map building, and path planning.
    *   Mesh network communication protocols for beacon-to-beacon and beacon-to-UAV communication.
    *   Dynamic beacon network configuration based on signal strength, battery life, and location.

*   **Software/Algorithms:**
    *   **Adaptive Network Topology:** Algorithm to automatically configure beacon network based on environmental conditions and UAV position. Prioritizes robust connectivity and minimizes latency.
    *   **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) with Beacon Fusion:** Integrates beacon data (range, angle, visual features) with onboard sensors for accurate 3D map creation.
    *   **Path Planning with Beacon Constraints:** Generates optimal flight paths considering beacon coverage, obstacle avoidance, and power consumption.
    *   **Beacon Health Monitoring:** Tracks beacon battery life, signal strength, and position. Automatically adjusts network topology and deploys replacement beacons as needed.
    *   **‘Beacon Shadow’ Prediction:** Predicts areas with poor beacon coverage and proactively deploys beacons to fill gaps.

**Pseudocode (Adaptive Network Topology Algorithm):**

```
// Input: List of active beacons, UAV position, signal strength data
// Output: Optimized beacon network topology

function optimizeNetwork(beacons, uavPosition, signalData):
  // Calculate connectivity graph based on signal strength thresholds
  connectivityGraph = buildConnectivityGraph(signalData)

  // Calculate shortest paths between UAV and each beacon
  shortestPaths = calculateShortestPaths(connectivityGraph, uavPosition)

  // Identify critical beacons (high degree, central location)
  criticalBeacons = identifyCriticalBeacons(connectivityGraph)

  // Prioritize critical beacons in network topology
  // Ensure robust connectivity to critical beacons
  // Adjust beacon transmission power/frequency for optimal performance

  optimizedTopology = adjustNetworkTopology(optimizedTopology, criticalBeacons)

  return optimizedTopology
```

**Novelty:** This system moves beyond simple beacon localization for emergency recovery to proactive, dynamic mapping and navigation in complex, GPS-denied environments. The combination of varied beacon types, adaptive network topology, and intelligent algorithms enables robust and reliable autonomous operation in challenging scenarios.
