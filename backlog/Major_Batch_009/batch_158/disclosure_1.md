## Dynamic Bundle Composition with Predictive Availability

**Concept:** Extend the item group availability system to *dynamically* adjust bundle composition based on predicted item availability, proactively offering alternative bundles to customers *before* availability issues impact their experience.

**Specification:**

**1. Predictive Availability Engine:**

*   **Data Sources:** Integrate with historical sales data, supply chain forecasts, trending social media data (indicating potential demand surges), and real-time inventory levels.
*   **Model:** Employ a time-series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet, LSTM) to predict the probability of each item being available within a defined timeframe (e.g., 24-72 hours).  Model outputs a "Availability Confidence Score" (ACS) for each item.
*   **Thresholds:** Define configurable ACS thresholds (High, Medium, Low).  Thresholds determine the level of risk considered acceptable for bundle fulfillment.

**2. Dynamic Bundle Builder:**

*   **Bundle Definition:**  Bundles are defined not only by their core components, but also by *acceptable alternative* components for each item.  These alternatives are ranked by customer preference (derived from historical purchases/ratings) and cost.
*   **Real-Time Evaluation:**  Continuously monitor ACS for all items within defined bundles.
*   **Proactive Adjustment:** If the ACS for a core item falls below a defined threshold (e.g., Medium), the system automatically evaluates alternative components.
*   **Bundle Variant Creation:**  If a suitable alternative is found, a new *bundle variant* is created. This variant maintains the core bundle functionality but uses the alternative component.
*   **Customer Presentation:** The system presents the original bundle and the newly created variant to the customer *before* the original item goes out of stock.  The presentation highlights the benefits of the alternative (e.g., "Similar features," "Faster shipping").  The customer has the option to choose either bundle.

**3. System Architecture:**

*   **Microservices:** Implement the Predictive Availability Engine and Dynamic Bundle Builder as independent microservices.
*   **Message Queue:** Utilize a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) for asynchronous communication between the availability engine, bundle builder, and the e-commerce platform.  Events include:
    *   `InventoryChange`: Signals an update to item inventory.
    *   `AvailabilityPrediction`:  Contains predicted availability scores.
    *   `BundleVariantCreated`:  Indicates a new bundle variant is available.
*   **API Endpoints:**
    *   `/bundles/{bundle_id}/variants`:  Returns available variants for a given bundle.
    *   `/availability/{item_id}`:  Returns the current availability confidence score for an item.

**Pseudocode (Bundle Variant Creation):**

```
function createBundleVariants(bundle_id):
  bundle = getBundleDetails(bundle_id)
  for item in bundle.items:
    availability_score = getAvailabilityScore(item.item_id)
    if availability_score < MEDIUM_THRESHOLD:
      alternatives = getAlternativeItems(item.item_id)
      if alternatives:
        best_alternative = selectBestAlternative(alternatives, customer_preferences)
        new_bundle = createNewBundle(bundle)
        replaceItemInBundle(new_bundle, item, best_alternative)
        saveBundle(new_bundle)
        publishEvent("BundleVariantCreated", new_bundle)
```

**Further Considerations:**

*   **Personalization:**  Customize alternative item selection based on customer purchase history, browsing behavior, and demographics.
*   **Pricing:**  Dynamically adjust bundle pricing to reflect the cost of alternative items.
*   **A/B Testing:**  Conduct A/B tests to optimize alternative item selection and bundle presentation strategies.
*   **Supply Chain Integration:**  Directly integrate with supply chain systems to receive real-time inventory updates and improve forecast accuracy.
