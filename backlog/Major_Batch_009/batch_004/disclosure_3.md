## Dynamic Contextual Model Composition with Generative Pre-training

**Concept:** Extend the contextual model set with models *generated* using a pre-trained generative AI, allowing for adaptive specialization beyond predefined stationary states. This allows for exploration of novel user behaviors without explicit feature engineering or lengthy training periods.

**Specifications:**

**1. Generative Model Integration:**

*   **Model Type:** Utilize a large language model (LLM) – specifically, a variant fine-tuned on user interaction data (clickstream, viewing history, preferences). This LLM becomes the “Context Generator”.
*   **Input:** The Context Generator receives a condensed representation of the current user context (recent interactions, device info, time of day, etc.). This is represented as a vector embedding.
*   **Output:** The Context Generator outputs a set of model parameters (weights, biases) for a simple contextual model – a linear Thompson Sampling bandit, for example.  The output is constrained to be compatible with the existing bandit framework.
*   **Batch Generation:** Generate multiple candidate models in parallel.

**2. Model Evaluation & Selection:**

*   **Simulation Environment:** Before deployment, evaluate each generated model within a simulated environment. Simulate user interactions based on historical data or synthetic users.
*   **Reward Metric:**  Evaluate the generated models on a reward metric aligned with business goals (e.g., click-through rate, conversion rate, session length).
*   **Top-K Selection:** Select the top-K performing models based on the simulation results. K is a hyperparameter.

**3. Dynamic Composition & Blending:**

*   **Ensemble Approach:** Maintain an ensemble of contextual models: the original pre-defined models *and* the dynamically generated models.
*   **Weighting Mechanism:** Assign weights to each model in the ensemble based on its recent performance (e.g., using a decaying average reward).
*   **Adaptive Blending:**  Combine the recommendations from each model using the assigned weights. This allows the system to leverage both stable, well-understood user behaviors and emerging, novel patterns.

**4. Continuous Learning & Refinement:**

*   **Feedback Loop:** Continuously monitor the performance of each model in the ensemble.
*   **Model Replacement:** Replace underperforming models with newly generated models.
*   **Generative Model Fine-tuning:** Periodically fine-tune the generative model itself using data collected from the deployed system. This ensures that the generated models remain relevant and effective.



**Pseudocode:**

```
// Initialization
Predefined_Models = [Model_1, Model_2, ...]
Generative_Model = Load_Pretrained_LLM()
K = 10 // Number of models to generate/maintain

// Main Loop
while True:
    User_Context = Get_User_Context()
    Generated_Models = Generate_Models(Generative_Model, User_Context, K)

    //Evaluate Models in Simulation
    Simulated_Rewards = Simulate_Models(Generated_Models, Historical_Data)

    //Select Top K models.
    Top_K_Models = Select_Top_K(Generated_Models, Simulated_Rewards, K)

    //Combine models with predefined
    All_Models = Predefined_Models + Top_K_Models

    //Calculate Weights
    Weights = Calculate_Weights(All_Models, Recent_Performance)

    //Get recommendations
    Recommendations = Generate_Recommendations(All_Models, User_Context, Weights)

    //Provide recommendation
    Provide_Recommendation(Recommendations)

    //Update performance metrics
    Update_Performance_Metrics(Recommendations, User_Feedback)

    //Fine-tune generative model (periodically)
    if (Time % FineTuneInterval == 0):
        FineTuneGenerativeModel(Generative_Model, User_Feedback)
