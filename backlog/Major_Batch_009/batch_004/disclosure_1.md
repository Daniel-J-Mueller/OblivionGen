**Dynamic Affinity Mapping with Multi-Modal Input**

**Core Concept:** Extend product relationship identification beyond browsing history to incorporate real-time sensor data and user-expressed sentiment, creating a dynamic, context-aware affinity map.

**Specifications:**

1.  **Data Acquisition Modules:**
    *   **Browsing History:** Existing system as outlined in the patent.
    *   **Real-Time Sensor Input:** Integrate data streams from:
        *   **Device Motion:** Accelerometer/Gyroscope data from user devices (phones, tablets) to infer user activity (walking, running, stationary).
        *   **Ambient Audio:** Microphone input to analyze environmental sounds (e.g., gym, coffee shop, home).
        *   **Geolocation:** GPS/Wi-Fi data for location context.
        *   **Biometric Data (Optional):** Heart rate, skin conductance (with user consent) to gauge emotional arousal.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis Module:**
        *   **Text Input:** Analyze user text input (search queries, reviews, social media posts) for sentiment.
        *   **Voice Analysis:** Analyze voice input (voice search, voice commands) for sentiment and emotion.

2.  **Data Processing Pipeline:**
    *   **Sensor Fusion:** Combine data from multiple sensors into a unified context vector.  Weighted averaging or Kalman filtering to account for sensor noise and uncertainty.
    *   **Feature Extraction:** Extract relevant features from sensor data (e.g., activity level, location type, environmental sounds, sentiment scores).
    *   **Contextual Embedding:**  Map features into a high-dimensional embedding space, representing the user's current context.
    *   **Affinity Scoring:**
        *   Calculate affinity scores between products based on:
            *   Co-occurrence in browsing history (as in the original patent).
            *   Similarity of contextual embeddings (products frequently viewed in similar contexts have higher affinity).
            *   Sentiment alignment (products associated with positive sentiment have higher affinity when the user expresses positive sentiment).

3.  **Dynamic Affinity Map:**
    *   Maintain a graph database where:
        *   Nodes represent products.
        *   Edges represent affinity scores.
        *   Affinity scores are dynamically updated based on real-time data.

4.  **Recommendation Engine:**
    *   Leverage the dynamic affinity map to provide personalized recommendations.
    *   Consider the user's current context (derived from sensor data and sentiment analysis) when selecting recommendations.
    *   Implement a hybrid approach combining:
        *   Content-based filtering (recommend products similar to those the user has viewed).
        *   Collaborative filtering (recommend products viewed by users with similar interests).
        *   Contextual recommendations (recommend products relevant to the user's current context).

**Pseudocode (Recommendation Engine):**

```
function recommend_products(user_id, current_context):
  user_history = get_user_browsing_history(user_id)
  candidate_products = get_candidate_products(user_history)

  for product in candidate_products:
    affinity_score = calculate_affinity(product, user_history, current_context)
    product.score = affinity_score

  sorted_products = sort_products_by_score(candidate_products)
  recommended_products = get_top_n_products(sorted_products, n=10)

  return recommended_products
```

**Hardware Requirements:**

*   Edge computing devices (e.g., smartphones, smartwatches) for real-time sensor data acquisition and processing.
*   Cloud-based servers for data storage, model training, and recommendation serving.

**Novelty:**

This approach moves beyond static browsing history to incorporate real-time contextual data and sentiment analysis, resulting in a more dynamic and personalized recommendation experience. The integration of multi-modal input provides a richer understanding of user preferences and intent.
