## Adaptive Frequency Masking & Predictive Roaming

**Concept:**  Leveraging user behavioral patterns *and* real-time network congestion data to proactively 'mask' unused frequency bands and predictively roam to optimal connections *before* signal degradation occurs.  This moves beyond simply *scanning* frequencies to actively shaping the radio environment the device interacts with.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Collection Module:**
    *   Tracks application usage patterns (data type, frequency, duration).
    *   Monitors device location history and movement prediction (using sensor fusion: GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope).
    *   Collects real-time network performance data (signal strength, latency, throughput) for *all* visible frequencies, even those currently unused. This uses a passive listening mode – minimal transmission.
    *   User-defined priority profiles (e.g., "Gaming", "Video Streaming", "Battery Saver").
*   **Behavioral & Congestion Modeling Engine:**
    *   Employs a recurrent neural network (RNN) to predict future application usage based on historical data.
    *   Utilizes a separate, geographically-aware model to predict network congestion based on time of day, location, and historical congestion data. Combines crowdsourced data with local measurements.
    *   Creates a “Frequency Usage Probability Map” - a heatmap indicating the likelihood of each frequency being needed in the near future (based on predicted app usage and network congestion).
*   **Adaptive Frequency Masking System:**
    *   Based on the Frequency Usage Probability Map, dynamically masks (disables radio access for) frequencies with a low probability of being used. This reduces power consumption and interference.
    *   Masking is *granular* – operates at the band level, and potentially even at carrier frequency level.
    *   Allows for a 'safe buffer' – a minimum number of frequencies always remain active to ensure connectivity.
*   **Predictive Roaming Algorithm:**
    *   Constantly monitors signal quality on all active frequencies.
    *   When the predicted signal degradation on the current frequency falls below a threshold (based on user profile and app requirements), the algorithm proactively scans for alternative frequencies *before* the connection is lost.
    *   Prioritizes frequencies based on predicted signal quality, latency, and congestion.
    *   Seamlessly roams to the optimal frequency with minimal interruption.
*   **Hardware Interface:**
    *   Requires a multi-band, multi-mode radio transceiver.
    *   Utilizes a software-defined radio (SDR) architecture to enable dynamic frequency masking and roaming.
    *   Optimized power management circuitry to minimize power consumption.

**Pseudocode (Predictive Roaming):**

```
// Global Variables:
currentFrequency: frequency
signalStrengthThreshold: int
scanInterval: int

// Function: Predictive Roaming
function predictiveRoaming() {
  signalStrength = getSignalStrength(currentFrequency)

  if (signalStrength < signalStrengthThreshold) {
    // Initiate Scan
    scanResults = scanFrequencies() // Returns list of frequencies with signal strength, latency etc.

    // Filter Results:
    viableFrequencies = filterFrequencies(scanResults, minimumSignalStrength, maximumLatency)

    // Prioritize Results:
    prioritizedFrequencies = prioritizeFrequencies(viableFrequencies, userProfile, applicationRequirements)

    // Select Best Frequency:
    bestFrequency = prioritizedFrequencies[0]

    // Roam to Best Frequency:
    roamToFrequency(bestFrequency)

    currentFrequency = bestFrequency
  }
}

// Execute every scanInterval milliseconds
setInterval(predictiveRoaming, scanInterval)
```

**Innovation:**  This moves beyond reactive network selection to *proactive* network shaping and optimization.  By predicting user needs and network conditions, the device can optimize its radio performance *before* problems occur, resulting in a smoother, more reliable connection and reduced power consumption. The combination of behavioral modeling, congestion prediction, and adaptive frequency masking is novel.
