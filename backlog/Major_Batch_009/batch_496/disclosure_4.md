## Dynamic Light Source Mapping & Projection

**Concept:** Instead of *reducing* specular reflections, actively *mask* them with projected light, creating a visually consistent surface regardless of lighting conditions. This expands on the idea of detecting light source direction, but shifts the goal from avoidance to controlled manipulation.

**Specs:**

*   **Hardware:**
    *   Multi-camera array (minimum 3, optimally 4+) -  Similar to patent, but with wider baseline for robust 3D reconstruction *and* high frame rate (60fps+).
    *   Micro-projector array (integrated with or closely coupled to camera array). Projectors must have high contrast ratios and be capable of dynamic color/intensity adjustment.  Resolution sufficient for pixel-level masking of specular highlights (target: at least 720p per projector).
    *   Processing Unit: High-performance embedded system (e.g., NVIDIA Jetson class) with dedicated image processing and projection control hardware.
    *   Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU): For accurate device orientation and motion tracking, even with rapid movements.
*   **Software:**
    *   **Real-time 3D Reconstruction:**  Utilize Structure from Motion (SfM) or SLAM algorithms to create a dense 3D model of the target surface. Update rate: minimum 30 Hz.
    *   **Specular Highlight Detection:**  Image processing algorithms to identify regions exceeding intensity thresholds, with emphasis on identifying the *shape* and *movement* of the highlight.  Algorithm should differentiate specular highlights from other bright areas (e.g., direct light sources).
    *   **Light Source Direction Estimation:**  Similar to patent's method, but focused on *continuous* tracking of the light source’s direction and intensity. Utilize multi-camera data for improved accuracy.
    *   **Dynamic Projection Mapping:**
        *   Algorithm to warp and blend projected light onto the target surface, *precisely matching* the shape and location of the detected specular highlights.
        *   Projection data dynamically adjusted based on:
            *   Light source direction/intensity.
            *   Target surface geometry.
            *   Device motion.
        *   The goal is to project light that *fills in* the highlight, making it appear as a consistent part of the surface.
        *   Implement color and intensity blending to seamlessly integrate the projected light with the existing surface texture.
    *   **Calibration Routine:** Automated calibration procedure to synchronize cameras, projectors, and IMU, and to map the projector's output to the target surface.
    *   **User Interface:** Simple interface for adjusting projection parameters (e.g., brightness, contrast, color) and calibration settings.

**Pseudocode (Projection Mapping Algorithm):**

```
For each frame:
    1.  Capture images from camera array.
    2.  Generate 3D model of target surface.
    3.  Detect specular highlights in images.
    4.  Estimate light source direction.
    5.  For each detected highlight:
        a. Project highlight’s geometry onto 3D model.
        b. Calculate the necessary projection transformation (warp, blend).
        c. Generate the projection data (color, intensity).
        d. Send projection data to projector array.
    6. Repeat.
```

**Use Cases:**

*   **Product Photography/Videography:** Eliminate glare and highlights, creating a consistent product appearance regardless of lighting.
*   **Augmented Reality:** Seamlessly overlay AR content onto reflective surfaces.
*   **Robotics/Computer Vision:** Improve object recognition and tracking in challenging lighting conditions.
*   **Medical Imaging:** Reduce glare and reflections in endoscopic or microscopic images.
*   **Artistic Applications:** Create dynamic light effects and interactive installations.
