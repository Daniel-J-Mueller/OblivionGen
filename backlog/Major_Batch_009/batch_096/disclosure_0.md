## Protein Dynamics Prediction via Multi-Scale Temporal Graph Networks

**Concept:** Extend static protein structure prediction to *dynamic* modeling, predicting conformational changes over time. This builds on the patent’s sequence/structure prediction, adding a temporal dimension.

**Specifications:**

**1. Data Input:**

*   **Input:** Protein sequence (as in the patent), initial 3D structure, and a short “seed” trajectory – a few frames of molecular dynamics simulation or experimental data (e.g., from cryo-EM) representing initial motion.
*   **Data Preprocessing:**
    *   Sequence encoded as in the patent.
    *   3D structure converted to a graph representation. Nodes represent atoms/residues. Edges represent covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces (calculated based on distance). Edge weights represent interaction strengths.
    *   Seed trajectory sampled at regular intervals to create a sequence of 3D graphs.

**2. Model Architecture: Multi-Scale Temporal Graph Network (MSTGN)**

*   **Graph Convolutional Layers (GCL):** Multiple GCLs applied to the input graph at various resolutions (coarse-grained residue level, atom level).  Each GCL learns node embeddings capturing local structural information.  Employ attention mechanisms within GCLs to focus on important interactions.
*   **Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN):** A TCN processes the sequence of node embeddings (from GCLs) over time.  Dilated convolutions within the TCN capture long-range temporal dependencies.
*   **Graph Update Module:** This module combines information from the TCN with the original graph structure. The TCN’s output predicts changes to edge weights and potentially node positions.
*   **Multi-Scale Aggregation:**  Information from different resolution levels (residue, atom) is aggregated using attention mechanisms. This enables the model to capture both large-scale conformational changes and fine-grained dynamics.

**3. Training Procedure:**

*   **Loss Function:**  Combined loss function:
    *   **Structure Loss:**  Difference between predicted and actual 3D structure (RMSD).
    *   **Dynamics Loss:**  Difference between predicted and actual dynamics (e.g., using a metric based on the rate of change of distances between atoms).
    *   **Regularization Loss:** Prevent overfitting.
*   **Training Data:** Large-scale molecular dynamics simulations or experimental data.
*   **Optimization:** Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.

**4. Output:**

*   Predicted protein trajectory – a sequence of 3D structures over time.
*   Confidence scores for each frame of the predicted trajectory.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
def predict_trajectory(protein_sequence, initial_structure, seed_trajectory, model):
  # Encode sequence, convert structure to graph, prepare seed trajectory
  encoded_sequence = encode_sequence(protein_sequence)
  graph = build_graph(initial_structure)
  seed_graphs = prepare_seed_graphs(seed_trajectory)

  # Process seed graphs through MSTGN
  predicted_graphs = model.process_seed(seed_graphs)

  # Iteratively predict next graph frame
  trajectory = [initial_structure]
  for i in range(prediction_length):
    predicted_graph = model.predict_next(predicted_graph) #MSTGN
    next_structure = graph_to_structure(predicted_graph)
    trajectory.append(next_structure)
  return trajectory
```

**Potential Extensions:**

*   Incorporate experimental data (e.g., from cryo-EM) as constraints during prediction.
*   Predict ligand binding dynamics.
*   Model protein-protein interactions.
*   Develop a reinforcement learning framework to optimize protein folding pathways.
