## Adaptive Permission Drift Baseline – System-Wide Behavioral Profiling

**Concept:** Expand the baseline access data beyond role type averages to incorporate individual user behavioral patterns. The existing patent focuses on deviations *from* a baseline. This system creates a dynamic, individualized baseline and flags anomalies *within* established user behavior, even if those actions aren't outside the standard role permissions. This aims to detect compromised accounts or insider threats exhibiting subtle, learned behaviors.

**Specs:**

*   **Data Inputs:**
    *   User Access Logs: Detailed logs of every application/system access, including timestamps, resources accessed, data transferred, commands executed.
    *   Keystroke Dynamics: Capture and analyze keystroke timing patterns (typing rhythm, pause duration).
    *   Mouse Movement Data: Track mouse movement speed, acceleration, common paths.
    *   Time-of-Day Access Patterns: Record when a user typically accesses specific resources.
    *   Network Traffic Analysis: Monitor typical data transfer sizes, destinations, protocols used by the user.
*   **Baseline Creation Phase (Initial 30-60 days):**
    *   Behavioral Profile Builder: A machine learning module that constructs an individualized behavioral profile for each user.
    *   Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the data inputs listed above (e.g., average command execution time, typical data transfer size, common application access sequences, keystroke rhythm stats).
    *   Profile Storage: Store the user's behavioral profile in a secure database, associating it with the user ID.  Profiles must be versioned to allow for learning over time.
*   **Anomaly Detection Phase (Continuous):**
    *   Real-time Data Ingestion: Continuously ingest real-time user access data.
    *   Feature Calculation: Calculate the same features extracted during baseline creation for the real-time data.
    *   Deviation Scoring: Compare real-time features to the user's established baseline using a statistical anomaly detection algorithm (e.g., Z-score, Isolation Forest).  Each feature deviation receives a score.
    *   Weighted Summation: Combine the individual feature deviation scores into a single “Behavioral Anomaly Score” using a weighted sum. Weights are assigned based on the importance of each feature (determined through analysis of false positives/negatives during training).
*   **Alerting and Response:**
    *   Threshold Configuration: Define a threshold for the Behavioral Anomaly Score.
    *   Alert Generation: Generate an alert when the Behavioral Anomaly Score exceeds the threshold.
    *   Alert Prioritization: Prioritize alerts based on the severity of the anomaly, the user's role, and the sensitivity of the resources accessed.
    *   Automated Response (Optional): Trigger automated responses, such as:
        *   Multi-Factor Authentication Challenge
        *   Session Termination
        *   Temporary Account Lockout
        *   Logging increased scrutiny.

**Pseudocode (Anomaly Detection Phase):**

```
FOR each user access event:
    Extract features from event (e.g., command execution time, data transfer size)
    Retrieve user's baseline profile from database
    Calculate deviation score for each feature (FeatureValue - BaselineValue) / BaselineStandardDeviation
    Calculate weighted sum of deviation scores = BehavioralAnomalyScore
    IF BehavioralAnomalyScore > Threshold:
        Generate Alert
        Log Event
        Trigger Automated Response (optional)
    ENDIF
ENDFOR
```

**Novelty:**  This shifts from *what* a user is accessing (permissions) to *how* they are accessing it (behavior). Traditional methods focus on policy violations; this anticipates compromise by detecting deviations from established norms – even if the actions *appear* legitimate from a permission standpoint. This dramatically reduces the 'false negative' rate.
