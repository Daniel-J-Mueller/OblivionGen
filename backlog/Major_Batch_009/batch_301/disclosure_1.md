## Real-Time Proximity-Based Skill Broadcasting & Request System

**Concept:** Extend location-based specialist routing to a dynamic, broadcast system where individuals can *advertise* their skills/expertise in real-time, and others nearby can request assistance. This moves beyond pre-defined specialists to include ad-hoc, immediate skill-sharing. Imagine a bustling convention or large campus.

**System Components:**

*   **User App (Mobile):**
    *   **Skill Advertisement:** Users designate skills (e.g., “Python Debugging,” “Spanish Translation,” “Valve Replacement”) and a proximity radius (e.g., 50 meters, 200 meters). Skills are categorized.
    *   **Skill Request:** Users post requests for help, specifying the required skill and a brief description. Requests include an urgency level (Low, Medium, High).
    *   **Proximity Mapping:** Continuously broadcasts location and advertised skills. Receives skill requests.
    *   **Communication Module:** Facilitates voice/video/text communication between requester and responder.
*   **Central Server:**
    *   **Skill/Request Database:** Stores user skills, requests, and associated data.
    *   **Proximity Algorithm:** Matches requests to nearby users with relevant skills. Considers urgency level and skill ranking (see below).
    *   **Skill Ranking:** Users can 'endorse' each other's skills. A reputation score for each skill is calculated.
    *   **Notification System:** Sends push notifications to potential responders based on proximity and skill match.
*   **Optional Augmented Reality (AR) Overlay:**  Displays skill advertisements as visual markers on a camera view, indicating the distance and skill of nearby users.

**Pseudocode (Proximity Algorithm - Server Side):**

```
function find_responders(request):
  location = request.location
  required_skill = request.skill
  radius = request.radius  //default value if not specified.

  potential_responders = []
  for user in user_database:
    distance = calculate_distance(location, user.location)
    if distance <= radius and user.has_skill(required_skill):
      responder_score = user.skill_ranking[required_skill] * (1 / distance) // Higher ranking/closer distance = higher score
      potential_responders.append((user, responder_score))

  #Sort by score (descending)
  potential_responders.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)

  #Return top N responders (e.g., top 3)
  return [responder[0] for responder in potential_responders[:3]]
```

**Data Structures:**

*   **User Object:** {user_id, location (lat/long), skills (list of skill_id), skill_ranking (dictionary: {skill_id: score})}
*   **Request Object:** {request_id, requester_id, location (lat/long), skill_id, description, urgency, radius}

**Potential Use Cases:**

*   **Conferences/Tradeshows:** Locate experts on specific technologies.
*   **University Campuses:** Peer-to-peer tutoring and assistance.
*   **Large Retail Stores:** Immediate product support from knowledgeable staff or other customers.
*   **Emergency Situations:**  Connect individuals with relevant skills (e.g., first aid, CPR) to those in need.
