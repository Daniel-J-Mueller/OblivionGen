## Variable Geometry Ducted Fan System

**Concept:** Extend the pivot assembly concept to encompass fully variable geometry ducted fan systems, allowing for optimized thrust vectoring *and* aerodynamic efficiency across various flight regimes. Instead of simply pivoting a motor for lift/thrust, the entire ducted fan unit rotates and morphs.

**Specs:**

*   **Ducted Fan Unit:** Each unit consists of a multi-blade fan within a variable-geometry duct. Duct composed of interlocking, flexible segments constructed from a shape-memory alloy (e.g., Nitinol) covered in a durable, lightweight polymer.
*   **Pivot Mechanism:** A central, high-torque servo motor controls the rotation of the entire ducted fan unit around a multi-axis gimbal. Gimbal allows for pitch, yaw, and roll adjustments *in addition* to the main rotational axis.
*   **Duct Morphing:** Shape-memory alloy segments within the duct can expand or contract based on electrical current, altering the ductâ€™s cross-sectional area and shape. Controlled by a dedicated microcontroller. 
    *   **Lift Mode:** Expanded, circular duct for maximum airflow and static thrust.
    *   **Cruise Mode:** Elongated, elliptical duct to reduce drag and increase forward thrust.
    *   **Maneuver Mode:** Asymmetric duct shaping for advanced thrust vectoring and agile flight.
*   **Control System:** A central flight controller integrates data from IMU, GPS, and airflow sensors to dynamically adjust duct geometry and thrust vectoring.  Utilizes a model predictive control algorithm to anticipate and respond to changing flight conditions.
*   **Redundancy:** Each ducted fan unit incorporates redundant actuators and sensors to ensure continued operation in the event of a component failure.

**Pseudocode (Control Loop):**

```
// Initialize sensors, actuators, and control parameters

loop:
    // Read sensor data (IMU, GPS, airflow sensors)
    sensorData = readSensors()

    // Calculate desired thrust and thrust vector
    desiredThrust, desiredThrustVector = calculateDesiredThrust(sensorData)

    // Calculate duct geometry parameters
    ductGeometry = calculateDuctGeometry(desiredThrust, desiredThrustVector)

    // Control duct geometry
    actuateDuctGeometry(ductGeometry)

    // Control fan speed
    setFanSpeed(desiredThrust)

    // Estimate current state
    currentState = estimateState()

    // Calculate control error
    error = desiredState - currentState

    // Apply control algorithm (Model Predictive Control)
    controlSignal = applyMPC(error)

    // Actuate control signal
    actuateControlSignal(controlSignal)

    delay(controlLoopInterval)
end loop
```

**Potential Advantages:**

*   Enhanced aerodynamic efficiency across a wider range of speeds and flight conditions.
*   Increased maneuverability and agility.
*   Reduced noise signature due to optimized airflow.
*   Potential for vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities.
