## Digital Item "Provenance" & Collaborative Annotation Layers

**Concept:** Expand the annotation system beyond simple user notes *during* a loan period. Introduce a persistent "provenance" layer attached to each digital item, accumulating annotations and modifications across *all* borrowers and lenders, creating a collaboratively evolving digital artifact.  This moves beyond temporary highlighting and creates a historical record *of* engagement with the content.

**Specifications:**

**1. Provenance Layer Data Structure:**

*   Each digital item (ebook, audio file, video) will have an associated "Provenance Layer" stored separately from the core item data.
*   Provenance Layer is a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each node represents a "Provenance Event".
*   Provenance Event Data:
    *   `EventID`: Unique identifier for the event.
    *   `Timestamp`:  Time of the event.
    *   `UserID`:  User who generated the event.
    *   `EventType`:  Categorization of the event (e.g., "Highlight", "Note", "Translation", "Correction", "Expansion", "DerivativeWork").
    *   `Content`:  The actual annotation, correction, or derivative content. (Text, audio, video, etc.)
    *   `Range`:  The section of the digital item the event pertains to (start/end offsets, chapter/verse, timestamp).
    *   `ParentEventID`:  ID of the event this event builds upon (for corrections, expansions, etc. – creates a lineage).
    *   `Visibility`: Setting controlling who can see this event (Public, LenderOnly, BorrowerOnly, UserSpecific, Group).
*   Digital item metadata will include a pointer to its associated Provenance Layer.

**2.  Lending System Integration:**

*   When a digital item is lent, the system grants the borrower write access to a branch of the Provenance Layer dedicated to their loan period. (This branch merges with the main provenance layer upon item return.)
*   Borrower access is governed by the `Visibility` settings of existing events.
*   A “Revision History” interface displays all events relevant to a selected range of the digital item, showing the lineage of changes.
*   Lender settings will allow control over the types of contributions a borrower can make (e.g., disable correction/expansion features).

**3.  Annotation Tools:**

*   Enhanced annotation tools:  Beyond basic highlighting/notes, provide:
    *   **Correction Mode:**  Borrowers can propose corrections to errors in the digital item.  Corrections are flagged and subject to review/approval by the lender (or a designated authority).
    *   **Expansion Mode:**  Borrowers can add supplemental content (e.g., historical context, alternative interpretations) linked to specific sections of the item.
    *   **Translation Mode:**  Allow users to contribute translations of portions of the item.
    *   **Derivative Work Mode**: Enable users to create small derivative works based on existing content (e.g. character sketches, musical arrangements).
*   All annotation tools automatically generate a Provenance Event.

**4.  Access & Discovery:**

*   Readers can toggle the visibility of Provenance Events.
*   A “Provenance View” displays the digital item with all visible annotations overlaid.
*   Search functionality allows users to find Provenance Events based on user, event type, keywords, or range.
*   "Trust Scores" will be applied to each user contribution, based on community feedback and moderation.

**5.  Pseudocode (Simplified Example - Adding a Highlight):**

```
function addHighlight(itemID, userID, content, range):
  //Create a new Provenance Event
  newEventID = generateUniqueId()
  newEvent = {
    EventID: newEventID,
    Timestamp: getCurrentTimestamp(),
    UserID: userID,
    EventType: "Highlight",
    Content: content,
    Range: range,
    ParentEventID: null // No parent for a new event
  }

  //Retrieve Provenance Layer for itemID
  provenanceLayer = getProvenanceLayer(itemID)

  //Append newEvent to provenanceLayer (potentially creating a branch)
  appendEvent(provenanceLayer, newEvent)

  //Save Provenance Layer
  saveProvenanceLayer(itemID, provenanceLayer)

  return newEventID
```

**Potential Applications:**

*   **Collaborative Scholarship:** Enables scholars to collectively annotate and expand upon digital texts.
*   **Enhanced Learning:** Students can contribute annotations and insights to educational materials.
*   **Community-Driven Content Creation:**  Allows communities to collaboratively improve and expand upon digital content.
*   **Living Documents:** Digital items evolve over time with the contributions of their readers.
